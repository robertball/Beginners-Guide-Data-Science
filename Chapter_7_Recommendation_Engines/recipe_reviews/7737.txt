Perfect.  Some tips: beat the cream cheese and butter together until light, fluffy and free of lumps.  Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder together before adding - again, to ensure no lumps or bumps.  Finally, I'd suggest not adding ANY milk until the end, and then do so little by little!  Particularly if you're going to pipe this frosting, as I did, you won't want to use the full amount!  I wanted a pure chocolate frosting so I didn't add the cinnamon and this is exactly what I was looking for.  Smooth, richly chocolate, and the cream cheese makes this a not-too-sweet frosting.  I used this to frost "Lori's White Bread Cake," also from this site (a little plug for that lonely but exceptional recipe!) and it was like gilding the lily!

This is an excellent frosting and I have made it a few times in the last few months before writing this review (wanted to give it a fair shake).  I have found that if you eat it the same day you make it, the flavors have not had time to "blend," and the powdered sugar can destinctly be tasted. So, frost and wait a day to allow the cream cheese and sugar to meld together.  A lovely, rather expensive-tasting (so be sure the cake deserves it!) frosting.

YUM! YUM!  YUMMY!!!  I was tempted to just eat this out of the bowl!  Tangy, sweet, and awe-inspiring. I used it to frost the "Deep Dark Chocolate Cake," and the combo was amazing!  I did tweak it a bit though:  Only 3 cups of powdered sugar (4 seemed like too much), and I ditched the cinnamon completely.  It's a good recipe that can be adjusted to suit your personal taste.

Very good recipe, but agree with previous reviewer that it is important to let the frosting set for a bit.  I made this recipe with a little added melted semisweet chocolate and slightly less sugar than called for.  I tried it about an hour after I made it and hated it - the flavors didn't go well and the sugar stood out.  About 5 hours later guests started eating the cake and raving about the frosting.  The bowl with the extra frosting was the most popular item in the kitchen.  I tried the frosting again and agreed it was actually very good - so make sure that you plan ahead when making this.

Excellent recipe I used for a base. I omitted one cup of sugar and the cinnamon - I then added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I then let it sit overnight and WOW! Throw away the cake and eat this frosting!

AMAZING. The texture and consistency of this frosting is incredible! It is dense, thick and creamy which makes it a breeze to frost a cake. The taste is amazing; not too sweet and perfect on a dark chocolate cake. I would recomend using half the required sugar and then tasting it before adding the rest, as i found it to be perfect with only 2 cups sugar. My new favorite!

I love this frosting.  I mixed together 
everything except the cocoa at first 
and took out a portion of the white 
frosting then mixed the cocoa into the 
remainder.  I then used it to frost a 
marble cake by putting on the layer of 
chocolate and dropping bits of the 
white on top and swirling it with a 
knife.  I was quite beautiful and a 
huge hit.

The taste was both satisfying and intriguing; *chocolate* cream cheese was new to me! I used both the cinnamon as well as 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and only 3 cups sugar as opposed to 4 and only 3 T milk. I whipped the cream cheese, butter and vanilla first, per folks' suggestion.  My disappointment came with the texture, which is really just personal preference and not anything the recipe ever promised to be: thick, sticky and a bit too cocoa-powdery, even after 12 hours. I haven't made too many homemade icings in my time so wasn't sure what to expect and had hoped for a little more fluffiness. I think next go I would whip some heavy cream first into soft peaks and try folding it in. The recipe produces plenty -- I had about 3/4-1 cup left after icing a 9*13.

I really enjoyed this frosting.  The cinnamon was a subtle but great addition that I definitely recommend trying.  I needed to use close to the 4 cups of powdered sugar to achieve the consistency of the frosting I wanted.  Delicious.  Thanks!

Amazing! This is my new favorite chocolate frosting. The hint of cinnamon is unexpected and delicious with the cocoa. I have used this several times on a two layer yellow cake (9" pans) and there is always enough. Yellow cake with chocolate frosting is my father's favorite, and the whole family looks forward to it with this frosting.  Highly recommended.

Sets up nicely.  Definitely sweet! Creamed the butter/cheese first, added 1 tsp of vanilla, then added the pre-sifted dry ingredients.  2 tbsp of half and half did the trick to loosen it up.  Enough icing to pipe 24 cupcakes.

Tried Cream Cheese topping before but never a chocolate one. Have used it on Hersheys' Deep Dark Chocolate Cake/Dark Chocolate Cake I & II. It was all HEAVENLY!! Out of the fridge it tasted like a rich chocolate ice cream..mmmm. But 1 1/2 cup of the sugar was just enough for me though, to get that sourish cheese taste I love

I left out one cup of powdered sugar and added a cup of peanut butter instead.  Oh so good! Makes less sugar but so much flavor.

First time making homemade frosting and I'm glad I picked this one. I impressed myself lol :) I added the 4th tbsp of milk and it made a LOT, like enough to frost maybe even TWO 9 x 13s. I used it on Grandpops chocolate cake from this site and it went very well together!

This recipe was very easy to work with,  piped beautifully onto cupcakes and tastes fantastic. I did make some slight modifications. As others recommended I started with room temp cream cheese and butter and whipped them first. Then I added dutch cocoa, powdered sugar and also added one 3.5 ounce bar of melted Valrhona 71% chocolate. I started with 3 cups of confectioner's sugar and felt like the sweetness to tang level and consistency were just right at that point,  so skipped the 4th cup.  As they were blending I then added in the milk (all 4 TB) and a generous pour of Penzey's double strength vanilla.  I used a sprinkle of cinnamon,  but not the full amount.  It had a wonderful flavor  and texture without being overly sweet,  so am curious to see if it tastes even better after sitting overnight.

Loved this recipe! I substituted almond extract for the vanilla extract. It changed the flavor significantly - almost tasted like I added a liquor. I omitted the cinnamon this time - but will definitely try it the next time around. I received rave reviews!

Pure perfection. This went onto a chocolate fudge cake mix and it sure didn't taste out of the box at all.  As far as the "most helpful critical review" .... you have no right to change a recipe that much and then give it three stars, much less give a review at all.

This was the perfect frosting for the Dark Chocolate Cake, another recipe on this site by Carol.  I used 1/3 reduced fat neufchatel cheese & added some extra cocoa powder for a deeper flavor.  The only ingredient I omitted was the cinnamon.  There was exactly enough frosting made for the 3-layer cake!

This frosting is incredibly luscious. But it is a LIGHT, not dark-colored chocolate. But that's good because it contrasts so wonderfully with a dark chocolate cake. This frosting is super easy to make, and even easier to frost with. Because it is fluffy and creamy, not dense and sticky like most buttercreams (which I wouldn't dream of making again now), it just glides and swirls on the cooled cake, without stirring a crumb. This frosting could actually be made 5 minutes before serving, because all you have to do is mix everything together, and it only takes two minutes to swirl it over your cake. I left out the cinammon, because I don't want that flavor in the cream cheese frosting. But please try it. It looks fabulous, and tastes even better.

As a few suggested I whipped the cream cheese and butter together before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This is a great tasting frosting that gets better the longer it sits so I make this one up the day before serving.

I made this, followed the recipe before reading some of the reviews. It tasted amazing but was very runny. I should have left the milk out until the end like some reviewers suggested. I had to add more icing sugar, I couldn`t taste the cream cheese.

So good. I used buttermilk instead of milk and it made it extra tangy.  I think next time I'll stick with the milk.  Otherwise ended up with MORE than enough to frost 2 9 in cakes (even in between) with tons left over.

Not sure what I did wrong because this was sour & even with extra sugar was inedible. I did like the slight cinnamon taste.

Excellent frosting and super easy to make. I didn't use all of the sugar that the recipe called for just to cut down on sweetness and it was still wonderful. Also looks beautiful after piping!

Wow - I am so glad I tried this. I am guessing the person who didn't understand the combination of "chocolate and cheese"  doesn't like cheesecake. Give me a chocolate cheesecake any day! I have made a LOT of different frostings, and one thing I love about this one is that it actually brings something different to the table. The flavor, the sweetness, the tang, the beautiful creamy consistency and finish - it's just excellent. Sweet, but not sickly sweet -  it's not what you would expect from a frosting that uses 4 cups of powdered sugar.  I tasted it at 2, 3, and 4 cups of powdered sugar, and each was delicious, just with different consistencies. You can easily alter it to suit your needs. Per the advice of past reviewers, I waited until the end to add any milk and didn't wind up using any at all. I am definitely going to use this recipe often. Oh, and I omitted the cinnamon, but only because it would have clashed with this certain cake's flavor. Yummy.

hmmm, after reading all the great reviews I thought I had found "the one"..well, it isnt.. in fact, its like eating chocolate and cheese together.. I thought the flavors would blend or something, I love cream cheese frosting but I dont know what happens to it when you add the cocoa.. I think cheese frostings have to be used in certain cakes, like carrot cake.. but chocolate cheese frosting? no NO AND NO! I couldnt even use this... and sorry for the bad review, not trying to insult the chef! Just saying it must go good on something but not on a regular kid friendly cake! maybe I myself am too much of a kid and cant understand this flavor??

This was a good frosting paired with Dark Chocolate Cake II. A pretty, easy-to-spread texture that is almost fluffy. I had to use 5 ounces of melted Guittard dark semisweet chocolate to get it to the level of chocolaty-ness I wanted. I also omitted the cinnamon. I used less than 4 cups of powdered sugar, and maybe 2-3 T. milk. Still, I would have preferred a more fudge-like frosting.

I loved the ease and flavor of this frosting. I made the frosting for Kelly Smith's Dark chocolate Cake II that I found here on Allrecipes. The flavors went together incredibley well! The cream cheese balanced well with the moist and sweet chocolate cake. This was such a quick recipe to make. I dumped all the ingredients in the mixer at once and it came out perfect. I frosted the top and sides of a 9x13 cake and eight cupcakes.

Fantastic!  I didn't add the cinnamon and I used cold coffee in place of milk to thin the frosting a little at a time.  I used it between the layers of Hershey's Best Chocolate Cake (on this site) and frosted the outside with the chocolate frosting from that same recipe.  It was a big hit for Father's Day!  Like having chocolate cake, fudge and cheesecake all at the same time!

Really good frosting. I did make some changes to the recipe based on personal preference, but as written it'd probably still be 5 stars. 
What I changed:
-omitted the cinnamon
- only used 3 1/2 cups of sugar
- used 1 full cup of cocoa (Droste Cacao) 

The recipe made enough to generously frost a bundt cake with a good amount left over.  Would probably be a perfect amount for a 2 or even 3 layer cake. 

Mixed all the ingredients together in mixer and it came together in a snap. 
As for the taste? Delicious, creamy, and chocolaty.  I think next time I may put a shot of espresso (cold) instead of some of the milk but other than that, perfection.

I wanted a good chocolate frosting recipe that I could flavor for a dark chocolate cake, and this was it! I flavored mine orange. Roll a fresh orange on the counter with some pressure to get the juices nice and loose. Zest the entire orange into your frosting. Slice orange in half and squeeze over mesh strainer, add the juice from the entire orange, then mix the frosting again, well. For a less intense orange flavor cut back on the amount of zest you add. With the addition of the fresh orange juice, omit the milk all together for a more stiff, pipe-able, frosting...for spreadable use a tablespoon or two depending on how large your orange was.

Superb! I tasted mine right after I mixed it and it was perfect! It was very smooth and not nearly as sweet as that nasty store bought stuff I'm usually stuck with. I didn't have any vanilla though, so I had to omit that, neither did I add the cinnamon, but it was amazing all the same.

Yum. This frosting has a great texture. It's very creamy and smooth. It was very easy to make too and uses 1 box of powdered sugar which is perfect so I don't have to keep a half a box in the cupboard! The only downfall is that cocoa taste and lack of cream cheese flavor. I would have liked a more cream cheese flavor and perhaps different type of chocolate.

The frosting was pretty good. It just seemed to be lacking something though...more butter maybe? I left out the cinnamon, maybe that would have added some complexity?

First off we personally don't care for over-sweet icing in any flavor. So as it stands I'll give this a 4 Star. But I only added 2 cups of sugar and for us it's perfect. Started w/ whipping the butter, cream cheese and vanilla. Slowly added the cocoa and sugar. 1/2'd the recipe added cinnamon to one batch it's excellent. As is the other just w/ a different finish. More cocoa flavor in the second.

Great frosting recipe!  I did reduce the sugar to 3 cups and only added enough milk to slightly thin it.   I put in on Chocolate Zucchini Bars from this site and everyone loved it.

This is by far the best and easiest frosting I have made in a long time.  I creamed the cream cheese, vanilla and butter till fluffy, sifted the sugar and cocoa to remove lumps adding in 1 cup increments.  I only needed 2 tablespoons of milk to get the perfect consistancy for cupcakes.  This is a keeper.

Not great.  Very runny, even when kept in the fridge.  Thankfully, I didn't frost the cupcakes and just frosted each one before eating it.  Usually, 24 cupcakes wouldn't last a week in my house.  I've had mine around for at least a month in the fridge and they are not going fast.  The "tang" people talk about is not a good thing.  I'm not sure if it's the cinnamon or what, but the frosting does not taste good and it leaves a bad aftertaste.  I made it exactly according to the directions.

We loved this frosting!  Two of my kids, plus my husband, have April birthdays, and this frosting was a hit with them all.  I used only 3 cups of powdered sugar, and 2 Tbsp. milk.  The frosting will stay fluffy and easily spreadable in the fridge for days- I still have some in a container from a week ago, and it's just as delicious as the day I made it.

i used 3 cups of confectionery sugar and it still turned out fine. this frosting was amazing when paired with the Dark Chocolate Cake II recipe from this site. it's even better when the frosting is allowed to sit overnight in the fridge.

I love this recipe. It's easy to make and tastes awesome. I would suggest refrigerating it before use because it becomes uh sturdier and easier to ice with.

My husband LOVED it, and I thought it was very good.  I used extra cocoa powder, and per the reviews, I left out the cinnamon.  We do not eat sweets on a regular basis, so we felt it was perfectly sweet enough with half the sugar.  I used it to frost a cake I made using my great-grandmother's recipe.  Yummy!

I am not very good at making frosting, but this was the best!!  I didn't add in the cinnamon, but followed the rest of the recipe, it is wonderful.  I planned on making a cake with this frosting, but instead my husband and I ate most of the frosting out of the bowl.  Excellent!! I won't buy the canned stuff anymore!!

Very creamy and tasty.  No sour flavor from the cream cheese.  It was an easy icing to work with both to frost and decorate.  I don't think that the cinnamon will appeal to everyone but it is easy enough to leave out or replace.

Very easy to make, and so yummy!
I'd did make a lot of frosting, but works out perfect. When we take the seran wrap off of the cake to eat it we have extra to put back on. Lol
Me and my 7yr old niece made this with the one bowl chocolate cake III submitted by Shirley. 
It was wonderful...Thank you for sharing

This frosting has an unusual taste, I'm sure it was the cinnamon.  I didn't really care for that, but it could easily be left out.  Also I made the ~mistake~ of using reduced fat cream cheese--don't do this.  It won't thicken.  I wish I had kept track of how much powdered sugar I put in trying to get it thick enough to spread rather than pour.  That's my fault though, I think.  Obviously  many like this recipe, I'm afraid I'm not really one of them, though.  Sorry.

Very good and easy to make.  I used Ghiradeli cocoa.  At the last minute I didn't think I'd have enough frosting for the cakes I was making, so I added an extra 4 oz. of cream cheese and no additional sugar.  Tasted great.  Omitted the cinnamon.

Soooo good! I used this on Carol's Dark Chocolate Cake, and it was perfect. If you are a chocolate purist, you may want to leave out the cinnamon or cut the amount in half, but my husband and I both thought it was wonderful. Made enough to frost layers, top and sides of a 9" 3-layer cake.

I added I extra tsp cocoa powder and I sifted it with the powdered sugar, 1tablespoon of vanilla.  Instead of butter I used butter flavored Crisco.  I live in the desert, butter doesn't always hold up in the heat.  All in all this is the best non cooked chocolate icing I have used.

I cut back on the powdered sugar (as mentioned in another review). Started with 2c, and just added 1/2c at a time until the consistency was just right. This is such a tasty frosting! Will make it again and again!

This is my first time making the Frosting and it was delicious. I would recommend blending the cream cheese and butter together before adding in anything else because the frosting was a little chunky. Also I would recommend adding in only  2 or 3 cups of powder sugar because with 3 it's very sweet.( In a good way)

Followed advice and slowly added powder sugar and ended up dropping the amount to 3 cups.  Omitted cinnamon as to not compete with my flavor profile of the cupcakes I was making.  Can see where this would be flexible enough of a base to add espresso, orange, or the cinnamon.  Also I,d commend going slow with milk to ensure you get the consistency you want.  Very good base - and what I liked most is it required ingredients most baking households would have on hand.  A keeper!

So I have to say I made this recipe for first time. Modified a little and added a little and came out absolutely amazing. I'd recommend adding some strong brewed coffee and a whole cup of cocoa. It's a must try. I don't rate a lot and I had to rate this one. My girlfriend wanted to put Nutella on a chocolate cake I made. When she tried this frosting she had deaert before we started dinner. :-) have fun and bake with love it's what it's about.

Sickly sweet with only a hint of chocolate. I chose to add more cocoa powder, which improved the flavor marginally.  While the cream cheese added a slight silky texture, I was disappointed that I couldn't taste it in the final product.  The search continues for the ideal chocolate frosting.

Disgustingly sweet. I think maybe 1.5 cups of sugar will do - a whole package is just ridiculous. Also, adding the cinnamon really ruined it for me. As a cinnamon frosting, it'd be good but it just totally took away from the chocolate flavor. I am going to try this again but heavily modify it.

I do a lot of baking, and while frostings are fairly simple, it's hard to find a good recipe for a frosting that's firm enough to pipe, holding its shape without refrigeration, that doesn't taste sickeningly sweet. This recipe is a perfect base. I did change it slightly, cutting back on the powdered sugar (a good deal) & cocoa powder (a little bit), adding between 3-4 oz melted chocolate, and added just a splash of corn syrup for a little smoothness. I also replaced the milk with half and half for extra richness. This frosting is soft, silky, and rich without being heavy. It holds its shape perfectly, too. Be -sure- to mix on medium-high speeds for several minutes. If you have problems with lumps in the frosting, make sure your cream cheese is warm enough, and mix with butter before adding the other ingredients.

I followed this recipe as close as possible. I thought I had enough powder sugar but as it turned out I only had a cup and by happy accident it turned out to be just perfect. Not overly sweet and the consistency was fantastic. I used this frosting for a black forrest cake and it worked out very nicely. 
I just went back over the recipe and realized that I forgot to add the milk DOH! Well ..whatever it worked out and I will be definetly be using this recipe again. 
We are not overly sweet frosting eaters in fact, if we order carrot cake we usually will request it without hte frosting...yeah imagine the looks we get..anyway this frosting is perfect for those of who are not into sweet frosting its tangy and thick but could stand to be just a tad more chocolatey was more milk chocolate than anything else. Nothing that can't be played with :)

Great recipe but took the advice of others reviews & only added 2 cups of sugar. I also didn't use the cinnamon, and added 2 ounce of semi sweet chocolate to help deepen the color next time I'll use 4 oz. Excellent recipe. THanks

This recipe is just so delicious.  I used at least 3/4 of an 8 0z. cream cheese package, left out the cinnamon and only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. I took the advice of other reviews w/the confectioner's sugar and it worked out perfectly.   I only used two tablespoons of milk because I was going to pipe my frosting on some cupcakes.  If you add all the milk you might end up w/some "runny or too soft" frosting.  I also took some good advice/tips from naples34102 and everything worked out well.  Thank you too, naples34102 for your tips!!

I made cupcakes yesterday for my son who today turned 5 and he said to me "mommy, this is the best chocolate frosting ever"!  Even he gave it 5 stars.  Thank, you Carol for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was a great recipe! I made it as the recipe said and it was very good! My advice is to let the frosting sit for a day or two to let the flavors develop.  I tasted it after I made it and it was not great.  The next day it was phenomenal!! It was more like a creamy icing for me.  I was not able to get it into a "frosting" consistency but it was perfect for my Valentine's day chocolate cake.

very good!  i made this to top cupcakes and everyone raved! :)  keep in mind that this frosting is heat sensitive so it's not the best for a picnic or outdoor events on a hot day (mine melted a little while traveling but luckily there was a fridge when i arrived to my destination).  will definitely make this again... a great frosting that isn't sickening sweet.

Delicious! I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of using melted unsweetened chocolate chips instead of powder. It made it a hundred times more firmer than I would have liked but it also came out pretty delicious and worked excellent with the cake I was making!  Great :)

This was amazing! I am throwing away my old chocolate cream cheese icing recipe. I would recommend starting with three cups of the sugar and two tbsp of milk so you can adjust it to your liking. SO smooth and delicious with the Dark Chocolate Cake. I coated the cake with mini chocolate chips too. WONDERFUL!

This frosting is great. It definitely does have a tangy flavor because of the cream cheese which I like, but not everyone probably would. I used almost the whole four cups of confectioner's sugar because the 4 T. of milk was too much. I wasn't planning to use more than three cups of sugar! Next time, I might stop at 2 T. of milk and see how that turns out. The birthday girl loved the taste of cinnamon in this recipe :o) I loved that it was one of the easiest chocolate frosting recipes I have ever made! PS: It's a lovely medium brown color so I made a dark chocolate glaze to drizzle all over the cake as contrast. So pretty!

This was a really good frosting. I loved to subtle sourness the cheese gave the frosting. It was absolutely delicious paired with dark chocolate cake.Only used 2.5 C of sugar though. 4 C seemed like a bit too much. Also didnt add the cinnamon. Will defintely make again.

This frosting is awesome!  It will definitely be the chocolate frosting I make from here on out...it's really good on graham crackers if you have leftovers after frosting the cake!  It makes a huge batch...I frosted a three layer cake and still had a lot leftover.

YUM! This frosting is SO good. We love the combination of chocolate and cream cheese. In fact after my son's birthday party tonight, my husband asked if there was any leftover frosting from the cake.  He's sitting on the sofa now eating it with a spoon.

OMG!!! This is the best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted. I left out the cinnamon, and used Hersheys special dark cocoa powder. It was sooooo yummy. I just put it in the fridge in a tupperware bowl to use the next day, and it was sooo easy to use. Definately a keeper.

This is the best chocolate frosting I've ever made.  The cream cheese really gives it a great taste.  I added a tad bit more cocoa to  make it more chocolately.  When I use it for layer cakes I just increase the sugar a little to thicken it up.

I needed to frost a rich, dense devil's food cake, and this turned out to be just right. It's a wonderful, creamy chocolate frosting that enhances the flavor of the cake without overwhelming it, as some tend to do. I used more cocoa powder (2 heaping tablespoons) and left out the cinnamon, as it didn't seem to need it. I used this on a layer cake, and would recommend refrigerating the frosted cake for a few hours before serving. This helped the frosting to firm up, making it easier to cut and serve. Thank you so much! I think I have a new favorite chocolate frosting!

This was a wonderful change from regular cream cheese frostings.  I loved it.  I didn't use the cinnamon though.  Maybe next time I will try that.  But it was very good without it!

This frosting was just what I needed!  Quick and easy to make, I had everything on hand, and it turned out perfectly!  (I hate to say it, but I left out the cinnamon, too.)  I was sure to add each cup of powdered sugar and tablespoon of milk one at a time to avoid consistency problems.  I added a bit of extra cocoa as the recipe suggests, and it is wonderful!  Reminds me of mousse.  Mmmm!

I halved this recipe except for the butter, I also omitted the cinnamon{just wasn't what I was looking for} and it is divine, not too sweet, nice chocolate flavor with just a hint of sour, reminds me of chocolate and sour cream, yummy. Really good, quick to whip up and perfect for just about any chocolate cake out there. I think it would be excellant on a nice moist yellow cake too. Thanx for the great recipe!

Great chocolate frosting recipe.  I wasn't sure about adding cinnamon, so I just added a sprinkle.  That seemed to be enough cinnamon flavor...it seems to compliment the chocolate, without being too cinnanmon-y.  I liked the consistancy of this frosting, and everyone seemed to love it.

Excellent! Very good flavor if you like cream cheese.  The cinnamon added a really nice spiciness! It complimented the "dark chocolate cake 1" (from this site) wonderfully!

Very good.  I thought the frosting was a little tangy at first but once it went on the cake, the tanginess really toned down and it was perfect.  I halfed the recipe and it covered a 9 by 13 cake easily.  I did add a little extra cocoa too.

I really like this recipe becuase its not as sickingly sweet as other frosting recipes becuase of the cream cheese.  Its got a more complex flavor than just overpowering sugar.

This frosting is amazing!!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but as many others did I left out the cinnamon.  I also used Orange Extract instead of Vanilla.  One last adjustment, I only used 2 tbsp of milk and added an extra 1/2 tbsp towards the end since some people said it was a bit thin.  For me, this was good enough to eat right out of the bowl.  I paired it with a chocolate cake that has cranberries and walnuts.  The real test will be this afternoon when everyone eats it!!!

This frosting is so amazing.  I had it with the "Dark Chocolate Cake II".  What a perfect combination.  I will never buy store bought frosting again and this will be the only frosting I make from here on out.  It just doesn't get any better.

I made this frosting for work, and it got rave reviews!  As one reviewer suggested, I mixed the frosting and let it sit for a day before using it.  The flavor was great!  I added extra cinnamon and cocoa, and used the frosting on Triple-Chocolate Cupcakes (from meals.com).  Great frosting!

Very good with the Dark Chocolate cake. I only used three cups of powdered sugar. It was a little thin, for this reason, but I do not care for thick/sweet frosting. I crushed five pieces of Almond Roca into the frosting before spreading; this gave it a nice crunch.

This is a chocoholics dream frosting. So rich and creamy. The best frosting I have tasted yet. I frosted Carols chocolate cake recipe with this and it was a perfect dessert. My neighbor keeps bringing me cream cheese to get me to make more. It was a hit with my family and friends.

So delicious! Just perfect for cupcakes, piped pretty well and held up. Cream cheese flavor comes through just enough.

Used caramel flavouring instead of vanilla.  Had to add a little more powdered sugar as the icing was thin, but that could have been because of warm weather.
Very good tasting frosting, am saving the recipe!

I’ve been looking for a chocolate cream cheese frosting for sometime now and I have finally found it. 1st time making it was last week and it was a big hit with the family. Creamy, rich and not to sweat. Taste sooo much better than store bought and very easy to make

I made this frosting for my birthday cake last year and it tasted really good. I didn't even double the recipe but it still made enough for the cake and still had a little bit left over but I couldn't save the extra frosting because I didn't have room in my fridge.

This was a really good and easy frosting.  I didnt use the cinnamon.  Also, I think it was a little too sweet.  Next time I will try with less sugar.

Such a decadent frosting that spreads like a dream! I made it exactly as described, minus the cinnamon. Tips: sift cocoa and powdered sugar for lump-free frosting. Also, add milk slowly till your frosting is the desired thickness (may not need all of it). 

For variety, I might try cutting back on the sugar (and milk) for a darker, richer version. When made according to the recipe, there was plenty for filling and frosting the top and sides of a 9" round 2-layer cake, so I think it would still be OK using less sugar. I didn't notice an extra tang, but in no way did that diminish the amazing flavor and texture of this frosting. Will most definitely make again!

I followed one suggestion to add the milk at the end to judge the consistency. I didn't have to add any milk at all because the consistency was perfect for decorating. I was somewhat surprised, however, at how sweet it was . . . Too much icing sugar. Next time I'll try less sugar. So consistency was great, taste much too sweet for a cake that's already on the sweet side.

This frosting is eat-from-the-bowl-with-a-spoon delicious! Smooth and creamy, not overly sweet, and the little hint of cinnamon sends it over the top. I served it on a dark chocolate cake, which was delicious, and the leftover frosting was equally delicious spread on graham crackers.

I can't say enough about this frosting! It is sooooooo good! I usually find frosting way too sweet for my taste (and I love sugar), usually scraping most of it off the cake. This frosting is superb! Everyone loved it!

Not bad, not bad at all!  Made this in a pinch whilst in need of chocolate frosting.   These ingredients are usually found in my kitchen so this all worked out well!  I think I used a cup less confectioners sugar but I also don’t mind it being less sweet.  Saving this one :)

Fabulous recipe. I used this recipe for red velvet cupcakes and it worked out perfectly! The frosting was a little thick and the recipe suggested using four tablespoons of milk to help thin it out and that worked great the texture was spot on.

YUM
Definitely something missing that I couldn't quite place. But its still delicious. 
Possibility that the "missing" flavor is that there's too little cream cheese (or too much confectioner's sugar). Next time I'll try doing one of those.

This was yum yum yummy!! I used one less cup of powdered sugar, just sweet enough. Of course it was too much for the cake, two layer 9 in. I took the left over, added peanut butter, about one to one, omg, really yummy!! Don't know what I am going to put it on yet, maybe ice some peanut butter cookies..

I was looking for a really nice icing to spruce up a plain yellow cake & settled on this one. I did add a bit more cinnamon and about 3/4t of cayenne pepper for a little more kick - ran a little short on the powdered sugar (I had about 3c) but for our taste it was plenty sweet. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is amazing! Depending on the consistency, you could use this as filling. Has almost a chocolate custardy taste, which I was pleased with. Easy too!

Easy to make. I always have cocoa, but sometimes don't have unsweetened chocolate, so glad to have this recipe. Others are correct - it wasn't great when I first made it, but after letting it sit overnight, it was wonderful. I used much less sugar than called for.

Good recipe but next time I would cut the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp.  Even my 11 yr old son asked me if I put cinnamon in it.   Way too overpowering.

We followed the instructions exactly and we liked it. It taste good, but next time we'll leave out the cinnamon. One problem is, it's not easy to spread. It'd probably be better used for piping. But, It was delicious on devils food cake! Everyone seemed to enjoy it, no sourness like some of the other comments state. All the ingredients mixed very well with an immersion blender.

i made this for dark chocolate cake (also found here) and it is fabulous!  the frosting is easy and scrumptious.  this was the first time I made both the frosting and the cake, so I left the cinnamon out, but next time I will definitely add it.

This is a great recipe, it is very chocolaty and yummy! I made it for cupcakes and, I had 22 to frost, and it only frosted about 18-19 of them. I was also using piping bag to frost it so if you are just spreading the frosting on with a knife, I think it will frost more than I was able to frost.

This frosting is excellent, the cream cheese does act to cut the sweetness which can be so overwhelming with a simple confectioner's sugar frosting. I omitted the cinnamon but may try adding a little cayenne next time.  This is my new go-to frosting recipe!

I was determined to use only what i had in the house, so i halved the recipe. i only had 3 oz of cream cheese so i subbed butter for the other ounce. the rest was exactly to the recipe except i saved the milk for the end and added it as needed (about 1tsp). The result was a nice velvety icing that wasn't overly sweet. Will definitely make again

I just made this and it is easy and delicious, but I did modify the sugar content substantially. I used Dutch baking cocoa, which is just 100% cocoa powder - no added sugar. The idea of putting 4 cups of sugar into this recipe though just struck me as way more than I wanted. I put in 1-1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar. I used the amounts directed for everything else. It came out plenty sweet and creamy. I put it on a depression-era chocolate Crazy Cake, and then sprinkled walnuts on top.
I had so much left over after icing a 9x9 cake (liberally) that I blended in even more walnuts, a bunch of flaked coconut, dropped it by the spoonful onto parchment paper and stuck them in the freezer to have as bonbons.

Made this tonight and LOVED IT! I made a few adjustments to my liking. Less powdered sugar, more cocoa powder, less milk. I just eyed it until it looked thick enough to pipe. And it turned out delicious. It turned out close to how store bought is instead of that awful sweet that most homemade buttercreams end up being. And I had enough left over to store in the fridge.

Extremely smooth frosting. I used my kitchenaid mixer and blended for about 2 minutes until nice and smooth. I piped it in a circular motion in cupcakes.  So good.

This frosting was delicious however I only used 2 cups icing sugar and it was plenty sweet! Adding two more cups would have been INSANELY sweet!! I had already added the 4 Tbs milk and it was fine, however next time I will reduce it to 2 or 3 since I am adding less sugar. I took another users advice and took out half before adding about 1/4 c. cocoa powder. I put a little cinnamon in the chocolate and it was amazing! Thanks! P.S. I had quite a bit left over after icing 12 large cupcakes.

First, you can't go wrong with cream cheese.  Then you add chocolate!!!  OMG!!!  I made this to go with the Black Magic Cake from this site and it was amazing!!!!!!  I did, however, leave out the cinnamon.  I start with 2 cups of powdered sugar and then increase as I need; you can always add but you can't take out.  This is my favorite chocolate frosting!

Whip it with my Kitchen Aid but gradually added dry to cream cheese and added drops of milk as needed. Must be patient its not a hurry up frosting. When mixed really turn up the number on your mixer and let it whip this is what infuses the sugar and cocoa to a velvety decadent frosting.

If you want a complimentary frosting, this is classy and sublime. It is sweet, but not like so  many modern buttercreams that are so sweet they detratact from the cake which should be the star! Just about the perfect frosting. Also...we did not taste it as being a cream cheese frosting...that component was very subtle in the flavor.

I added the full recommended amount of milk yet only 3 cups of sugar. My goodness it is amazing , not overly sweet or no Tanginess from cream cheese. If I had to describe my dream chocolate frosting this is it!!

I didn't use any milk because it looked really soft, although it firmed up a lot in the fridge. Skipping the milk helped with piping. I also skipped about 1/2 cup of the icing sugar because although I liked the cream cheese flavour, I still would've preferred a less sweet and deeper chocolate flavour. I used dutch processed cocoa for a richer colour and flavour.

Greatest chocolate frosting I've tried so far... I omitted one cup of sugar and the cinnamon and added chili powder instead (NOT the smoky tasting kind)... Used it on a wedding cake (choc&raspberry flavours) - and it was DELISH!!!!!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I doubled it to frost 24 cupcakes but only used 6 (instead of 8) cups of powdered sugar and not a single drop of milk and it was the PERFECT consistancy for piping.

Great tasting icing. Not overly sweet.  I did sift dry ingredients into creamed mixture to ensure no lumps.  I also added milk at the end to get the right consistency. I will use this recipe again. My family loved it.

I thought this would be really sweet and planned on using only 2 cups of confectioners sugar, but the cream cheese and chocolate really do balance out everything. Except for leaving out the cinnamon, I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED IT!

Quite good, not my favorite but I dig it.  For better results sift the confectioner's sugar twice, and if you do not want it this sweet, you can cut from 4 cups to 3 with no problem at all.  Like other reviews: measure the milk to your taste.

I liked this recipe. I beat the butter and cream cheese as another poster suggested then added the cocoa powder and sugar. I kept looking at the 4 cups of sugar and thinking, wow that is a lot of sugar. I used one cup and that was plenty. I also added about a 1/4 sour cream. I also let it sit a while after mixing and it really smoothed out. Nice recipe with modifications.

I loved this frosting!  I forgot to add the cinnamon and I used only 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I wanted more tangy than sweet. I will have to try the cinnamon next time! It was perfect with my chocolate cupcakes and I still have so much leftover...  Bring on the graham crackers!

LOVED THIS! It came out absolutely perfect. I didn't add the cinnamon (not a fan) but it still came out amazing. I think the problem people are having with the frosting becoming runny is because they're adding the full 4 tbsp. I alternated a tbsp. of milk with a cup of sugar. I only used three cups of sugar because I was afraid it would be too sugary. Next time I'll try it with special dark cocoa and see how it turns out.

I blended the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and 3 tbs of milk. Then I added the cocoa powder and confectioners sugar (I did a little extra sugar so it would be thicker to pipe). I left out the cinnamon. DELICIOUS on yellow cake.

This is a nice, creamy frosting, and I love the zip that the cinnamon added.  If you plan to pipe the frosting, add the milk at the end, otherwise it may be a little too loose to pipe.

If you love chocolate cheesecake, you're going to love this frosting.  I did not have any confectioner's sugar but used white sugar ground finely and it turned out ok.  The cream cheese did not dominate the chocolate flavor.  It was enough to satisfy any chocolate lover. So delicious!

This recipe is divine. I only used 3 tbsp of milk and listened to other reviewers and mixed the cream cheese and bitter together first and adding the milk last. I'm taking it to a Christmas party tonight, I'm sure everyone will love it! I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. I excluded the milk and the cinnamon, just treated it like a regular cream cheese frosting.  Creamed the butter and the cream cheese first to get it fully mixed and then added the vanilla. I alternated the icing sugar and the cocoa until the cocoa was used up and then put in enough icing sugar to my taste.  I also added 3 ounces of melted semi-sweet chocolate in the double recipe I made.  Will use this over and over again. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Could eat this by itself out of the bowl.  update : I used cold butter and whipped it by itself before adding the cream cheese and used heavy cream instead of milk and whipped it again.  In the end it after the icing sugar was incorporated and whipping it longer, it was fluffier.

Not as chocolatey as I hoped, but still a good change up from basic chocolate buttercream frosting.  I had no problems with texture (beat the cream cheese and butter for several minutes in a Kitchen Aide before adding other ingredients) and used all 4 cups of sugar but only 3 T of milk. After setting up, the outside of the frosting hardens a bit but the inside is still wonderfully soft and gooey.

This frosting tasted delicious. The cream cheese made it not too sugary-sweet, which is what I usually can't stand about most frosting. Based on other reviews, I added the sugar 1 c. at a time so it wouldn't be too sweet & I ended up only using 3 c. of sugar. My main complaints are that it was hard to get the frosting completely smooth & it was a bit too runny so I would probably use less milk next time.

This was my first attempt at a chocolate cream cheese frosting and it was a hit with the chocolate zuchini cake from this site. I only used 3 cups of the powdered sugar, used reduced fat cream cheese, and skim milk. I used only 1/2 the coco powder that it called for because I am not one for extremely chocolately frostings. It was perfect. Used the left overs to dip our strawberries in! MMMMMMM. I think the cinnamon definitely added to the flavor. It never hurts to add cinnamon if you like it because it is good for you.

This is an awesome recipe!  I have tried several other chocolate frosting recipes and they were either too sugary or bitter.  The cream cheese keeps it from being too sweet (doesn't taste like confectioners sugar) and gives it an amazing texture.  I used melted baker's chocolate, and it was great in this recipe.  I'll be using this for many cakes to come.

This was really good except I would definitely leave out the cinnamon next time.  Chocolate doesn't need any help with flavoring!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe...but in fairness I think I might have messed it up.  I added some more milk because it was too stiff to mix, then I had to add a lot more powdered sugar.  And that skewed the results. I will have to try again to be sure.

Excellent taste and consistency. Based on other reviews, I cut back the sugar to 3 c and used just 3 tbsp of milk (actually I used cream in lieu of milk).  I used it on Dark Chocolate Cake II.  Also added a pinch of salt.  Will keep for next time!

Delicious!!  I used melted semi-sweet baking chocolate, and i added less sugar and less butter.  It went GREAT with "Simple White Cake"  From this site.   It also sets up well when put into the fridge.

This is a great recipe.  I used 3 cups of sugar instead of the 4 and it still turned out great.  Although, I think you can still use the 4 cups and have a great frosting.  I will never use store bought again.

This is a great recipe as is!  Don't be afraid to use the cinnamon.  I used this and Dark Chocolate Cake II to win a dorky little chocolate cake bake off at my work.  It's definately great for people not too found of overly sweet frostings.

Simple to make and tastes great. I frosted "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" with this frosting and then drizzled Chocolate Ganache over the top.  The cake got rave reviews from everyone and there wasn't one bite left.

Very good recipe!  In addition to the cocoa I added 1 cup of melted dark chocolate because the frosting did not look too "chocolaty."  It tasted really good.  I left out the cinnamon because my husband's not a big fan, and I added a little more powdered sugar because the frosting was not thick enough--probably because I added the chocolate.  I especially loved the smooth texture of the frosting after it was whipped for about 8 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

Delish! Made with "Too much Chocolate Cake" on this website. I only needed 2 cups of the sugar for our taste, and it was plenty sweet! It was also enough to ice a 2-layer 9" round cake.

GREAT!!  I did make a few changes.  I used 2 sticks of butter, and a teaspoon of chocolate extract(which may be hard to find for some), and no cinnamon. I also used about 2 1/2 cups of sifted confectioners sugar. Oh my gosh, the extra butter and sifting the sugar gives these a wonderful taste and texture. I frosted dark chocolate cupcakes and served them at a recent gathering at my home. They were a real hit!! Not too sweet.  This is a definate keeper!

Excellent frosting!  Especially for those who generally think frosting is too sweet or rich: I used this on a cake for a friend, and she and her boyfriend said it was the best frosting they had ever tasted!  Just sweet enough without making your face burn!  Will definitely use this again.

Delicious, glossy and lighter brown in color.  I disagree that it is a "dark" chocolate frosting with a "tangy" flavor.  Rather, it is a balanced, super-smooth, moderately-sweet chocolate frosting that will not overpower your cake.  I omitted the cinnamon and kept the frosted cake in the fridge.  The frosting stayed smooth and creamy.

I wasnt crazy about this recipe. The cream cheese was good but the cinnamon added a strange flavor. I will try it again without it. Also I added extra cocoa powder to cut some of the cinnamon flavor. This definately helped.

This frosting was so tasty. I made a few changes, because I wanted to make a chocolate snickerdoodle cake (plain chocolate cake in the middle with chocolate cinnamon frosting on the outside). I therefore added about 1 1/2 extra tsps of cinnamon. I also personally don't like super sweet frosting so I cut down on the sugar to about 3 cups and added 4 ounces of melted chocolate like the recipe suggested. The result is truly amazing.

I added 3 squares of melted semi-sweet chocolate, and halved the cinnamon to 1/4 t.  I agree with alot of other reviewers that the frosting is much better the next day,and it also tasted better on the cake than in the bowl.

I followed this recipe exactly, although next time I'd like to try adding the 4 ounces melted chocolate for a darker flavor and appearance. I also whipped the frosting to get a lighter texture. I loved it! Probably will be my "keeper" for chocolate frosting.

I used this on a Red Velvet cake, and it worked pretty well. I made it for a birthday, and everyone kept saying "there is something different about this icing" as they gobbled it up. It was that cream cheese flavor... I did not use all the sugar - measured out 4 cups, and added it little by little until I had the sweetness I wanted. And yes, the flavor got much better after time.

I loved this frosting!!!!!!  I didn't add the cinnamon though. Very creamy, not too sweet.  Nice.

Great recipe!  Will definitely use again.  My only problem was putting in a couple extra teaspoons of milk and getting a frosting that was a little too thin.  I used this on the Hershey's best chocolate cake and it was wonderful!

My family didn't like the tanginess of the cream cheese -- the most common comment was "it tastes sour". However, the consistency and colour was wonderful. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who is tired of those way-too-sweet chocolate icings.

I made this to frost the "Dark Chocolate Cake"- which is an excellent cake recipe- but the flavor of this frosting was horrible. - sorry next time will frost the cake with regular chocolate frosting.

This was very easy to whip up with my hand mixer, and came out delicious.  I HATE icing and never eat it, but I do like cream cheese so I figured I'd try this instead of buttercream.  Yum!  I will be using it henceforth.

If you are looking for a chocolate frosting recipe, look no further!  This frosting beats the store
bought tub frostings on both taste and consistency, and it's so easy, it's just as convenient
as buying frosting off the shelf.  If you make this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

This is now my favorite frosting. It's easy and tastes divine! Makes a bunch so be prepared to store the leftovers in the fridge. My hubby likes to just take a spoonful whenever the chocolate cravings hit.

Very tasty frosting.  I will try it on different cakes, but of course it was perfect on the dark chocolate cake.  Not too heavy, nice and creamy.

I added almost twice the amount of cinnamon than the recipe originally called for, and it turned out pretty good.  Unusual; an almost coffee taste.  Used with Dark Chocolate Cake recipe, with which it went well.

This is a great icing.  It is a very sweet icing.  Perfect compliment for a denser, not as sweet, cake.

This is the best chocolate frosting I have ever made and have ever tasted.  Carol is so right that it goes perfect with the Dark Chocolate Cake.  I will never make another chocolate cake frosting.
