The Canadian Allrecipes Allstars were asked to make a pie for Pi Day. March 14, 2015 is a special pi day being 3.1415!
I choose this recipe because it had no photo or reviews and I had all the ingredients.
I used my food processor to slice the carrots thinly and to puree the pie mixture after the carrots were cooked.
I steamed the carrots with 2 tbsps of water in the microwave instead of boiling to maintain the nutrients.
I halved the milk as I was concerned it was too liquidy, omitted the salt and used 1.5 tsps of pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed.
45 minutes baking time was perfect for my oven.
When my kids came home and smelled the pie, my son asked if I was making carrot cake, I think the name should be changed to Carrot Cake Pie as that is what it tastes like, there is no way anyone is going to think this is pumpkin as the texture is totally different.
I served with cinnamon whipped cream. We enjoyed the pie but I don't think I would make again as the texture was odd.
