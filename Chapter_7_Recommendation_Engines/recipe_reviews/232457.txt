Excellent Chicken Parmesan. Crust was great. But I did change how the pie was made a bit. I substituted fresh mushrooms for the black beans and grilled them with the chicken, onion, and spices as the recipe suggested, and placed the meat mixture on the bottom of the pie pan. I also made my own spicy marinara sauce and then poured it on top of the chicken. I layered the mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce and chicken, and topped it off with the batter and cooked as directed. Thanks for the recipe Acahewowow. It's a keeper.

I did almost everything this recipe said except I added a little more milk and used a mixer to beat the batter. This meal was a pleasent surprise. I took my first bite and was shocked at the amount of flavor. My husband also loved this meal and complimented my cooking the whole time he was eating it! This was something different, fairly simple, and really yummy. I definitely recommend adding the beans, it seems odd but they do work really well in this. Give this recipe a shot, it's SO good!

This was AMAZING!This was my first time ever using fresh mozzarella...and let's just say from now on I will ONLY buy fresh mozzarella cheese. I changed it up just a tad, and only because I didn't have all the required ingredients. Instead of using the canned tomatoes, the tomato paste, onions, basil, garlic, onions, and oregano.... I just used used a jar or Spaghetti sauce (Ragu Sauteed Onion and Garlic). I also used milk instead of almond milk. And I took the advice of another reviewer and i layered the fresh mozzarella on top of the chicken mixture. I served with a side of linguine and peas. This will become my new way of making chicken Parmesan!

This is great! I don't use the butter to try to save on calories, and it is still yummy. I add some extra red pepper flakes, because my husband and I love spicy! Can't recommend this enough..it also is great as leftovers.

I'm going to have to try this one again. The juice of the diced tomatoes made the dish more like soup than pot pie. It was tasty though.

I used regular milk instead of almond milk, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It needed more sauce, seasoning and cheese... then it was 5 stars!

I wanted chicken pot pie (for Pi Day), and my friend wanted chicken parmesan.  This was perfect.  I only made some minor swaps because of what I had in the house.  I will definitely make it again.
