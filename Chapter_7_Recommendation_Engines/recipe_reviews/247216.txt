I used the Ghirardelli Double Chocolate brownie mix, it's a great way to use up the instant coffee in your pantry, but the kahlua would best be served in something else.

I don't normally buy brownie mixes so the reason I didn't like it as much as I had hoped may be  because of the quality of the brownie mix I had used.   The brownie was flat and the flavor was just OK.   I used it as a base for a brownie sundae which worked out well.
