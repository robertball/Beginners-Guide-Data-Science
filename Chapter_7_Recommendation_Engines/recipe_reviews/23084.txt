Yummmmy!  I made cookie bars instead of cookies.  Very moist!  I cut the butter in half and used about 3/4 c applesauce.  I added raisins and omitted the sunflower seeds (only cause I didn't have any in the house).  I used flax seed meal instead of the seeds and used about 3 T.  My husband, who is use to me baking all sorts of goodies on the weekends, lovessss these (he recently changed his diet due to high cholesterol, so I have been looking for a tasty baked good that is lower in fat).  Definitly a keeper...thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I did not have any wheat germ so I substituted more oatmeal and they turned out just fine.  It is nice to find a healthy recipe that still tates great.  I will definitely be making these cookies often!

With all the sugar, butter and white processed flour, I wouldn't really consider this a healthy cookie.  I gave them a try with some changes...applesauce for 1/2 the butter, cutting back on the sugar by half and using spelt flour (whole wheat flour would be a good alternative, too).  I'm not sure how different they tasted from the original but  they were much healthier and they tasted really good.  I only gave it 3 stars because I had to make changes to really make them a healthy snack.

Used half the butter amount, and added 3/4 cup applesauce.  1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of blue agave nectar.  Whole wheat flour.  Chopped walnuts instead of hazelnuts.  Almond meal instead of wheat germ.  Added a dash of almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract.  They are very moist and delicious.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

Yummy :)  I also replaced 1/2 of the butter with applesauce, and they turned out fine.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added a bit of cinnamon and omitted the salt (i was using dry roasted sunflower seeds which were already plenty salty).  I also omitted the hazelnuts (husband doesn't like) and flax seeds (almost $8.00 at my local store for the amount needed!).  Tasty cookie.  If you don't particularly like the taste of nutmeg, I would suggest reducing it by at least 1/2, as these are very nutmeggy cookies.  I like the flavor, though, so thought they were delicious.

Delicious & nutty!  Few changes:  subbed about 1/3 of butter with applesauce (hence "healthnut"), chopped pecans in place of hazelnuts and sesame nuts.  Made some with raisins and some with choc. chips, but we thought tastiest without.  Tried putting 1/2 wheat flour, but texture was not as nice.  Can reduce sugar by about 1/4 with almost the same results, did this along with butter reduction mentioned above.

These were really good! I used 1/3 c. butter and 1/3 c. applesauce.  I ground my flaxseed and did a generous 1/4 c.  I added about 2 T. water and omitted the egg (b/c of the extra flax) and we didn't miss it at all.  I used whole wheat flour, a VERY loose 1/2 c. brown sugar + 1/4 c. honey.  I didn't realize I was out of nutmeg till I was already committed to making these, but we didn't miss it at all.  These are very versatile - dried fruit would be nice, particularly apples I think.  We added about 1 c. chocolate chips at the end and gobbled them up!  Yum!  Will make again!

These cookies are simply great. I used one stick of butter + a few Tbsp of applesauce instead of the full amt of butter...my family loved them, as did all my friends! A true guilt-free treat :)

Excellent recipe. I didn't change a thing. Even my husband likes the cookies, and he's not much into "health" foods.

These cookies didn't do too much for me.  Kind of bland and boring.  Maybe with some dried fruit they would be better.  I appreciate the attempt at being healthy - and the hazelnuts were a nice twist.  I just didn't enjoy them, neither did my fiance.

These are delicious! The only changes I made were to use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. I also omitted the sunflower seeds and added some raisins. I don't how healthy these are with all the butter, but they are good!

SO GOOD! Made these today and my roommates couldn't keep their hands off! Made a few changes though; used 2 cups minute oats, subbed the butter for 1/3 butter + 1/3 unsweetened applesauce. Cut half the sugar and split into 2 batches (one with raisins and one with choco chips and chopped walnuts.) Came out the PERFECT texture; crisp on the outside with almost a cakey soft inside. Will defff make again!

Wow!  These are so darn good!  I subbed in whole wheat flour for white and cut the butter in half and subbed in 1/3 cup applesauce.  I made them for my 14 month old daughter for a special treat.  With so much good stuff packed in there they are shockingly good!

Very good. More like a breakfast cookie. I added raisins, used 1/2 the butter plus applesauce, and used whole wheat flour. My family really enjoyed them.

Yum!  Made a few changes, like others suggested... decreased the butter to 1/2c and the nutmeg to 1/2tsp, and substituted more oats for the wheat germ. Came out tasting great!  Will definetely make these again.

I LOVE this recipe! I've tried a few variations. Once I added dried cranberries, and most recently I added walnuts and dark chocolate chips (which sort of detracts from the healthiness factor, but very yummy). I also add a little less nutmeg and add a bit of cinnamon. Great recipe!!

While there is no mistaking these for the ooey-gooey cookies that we are used to, they are very good and they are so healthy that they make you feel like you are really doing something good for your sweet tooth. I grinded up all of the seeds into a meal before adding to the mix, and added raisins for sweetness and moisture. Yum!

The taste of these cookies isn't overly sweet, but they have very good flavor! I used chopped dates instead of the sunflower seeds. Next time I may use raisins. I also used real butter and whipped it for a long time with the sugar. Great to find a cookie with flax and oats in them...my new husband loves them too (though he seems to like everything I make)! Oh, and I may add cinnamon next time too. Yum!
