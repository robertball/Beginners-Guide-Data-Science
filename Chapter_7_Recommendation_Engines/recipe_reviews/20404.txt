Not a good recipe.  Tasted nothing like real fudge.  I tried making it the way it says and 2 other ways thinking maybe I could make it better but all three were not something I would eat myself much less feed to anyone else.  I agree with previous review a WASTE OF INGREDIENTS

It was very dry before I put it into the microwave, and when I microwaved it, it became a sticky solid ball of chewy goo. It was impossible to work with.

I found this recipe easy, delicious and very forgiving.  I made it twice substituting canned table (light) cream the first time and double strength instant milk the second. (I don't do heavy cream.) I took some to work and some of my co-workers asked for the recipe.  My husband and his co-workers liked it, too.  It wasn't like "real fudge" but what do you want for something that takes ten minutes to make?  Plus, with the pudding you could make lots of different flavors of "fudge."

I used coconut pudding and added 2Tblsp cocoa. Very sweet, but my favorite fudge has always been "Santa's Fudge" From "Better Homes and Gardens- Cookies and Candies" cook book, which is also very sweet.
