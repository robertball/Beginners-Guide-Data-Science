very yummy. i made a few changes...i substituted 2 cloves of fresh garlic chopped instead of garlic powder and i used brown sugar instead of white.  i added a few teaspoons of cornstarch and cooked until thick and bubbly (just a few minutes) to make it more of a sauce consistency. when cooled i marinated my chicken and it turned out wonderful. you need to marinate for a few hours at least to get the flavor into the chicken, but it was good to used some of the reserved marinade (not used on the chicken) for your rice or a dipping sauce for egg rolls!! i will definately make again!!

I substituted onion powder for the flakes and left out the ginger as I didn't have any.  The sauce/marinade tasted just like the kind you can buy in the supermarket.  I only used half of the marinade and stored the rest in the fridge with no problems.  Great recipe!

At last... a replacement for those expensive store-bought sauces!  Like other reviewers, I thickened with corn starch.  It makes a lot, so I only used a small amount of the (unthickened) sauce to marinate chicken, then added the rest (with cornstarch mixed in) to the stir fry, just before it was done.  Then simmered a minute, or two, to thicken and remove the corn starch taste.  Yummy; thanks!

Loved this marinade - used it on chicken drumsticks and then put it on the grill.  I used onion powder instead of onion flakes..Nice and Easy!

This is great stuff. I also use it for stir-fry sauce for beef-broccoli and chicken-broccoli dishes. I just thicken a bit at the end of cook time. I have also used splenda and it works fine! Thanks Mary~

Best steak marinade I have ever tried.  On tougher meats I try to let them marinade for 48 hours.

This recipe is great!  Its my go-to for teriyaki especially with boneless, skinless chicken thighs on the grill, delish!!  I usually use less sugar but thats just our taste.  And I've made it with fresh and dried of the garlic, onion and ginger, depending on what I had on hand, it was great with all (just be sure to use more fresh or less dried/ground since the dried is more potent).  This also freezes fabulously, I'll take a large amount of chicken (or another meat) and combine this marinade with the meat in a freezer bag and then freeze it until I need it.  The marinade prevents freezer burn and really develops a nice flavor.

This was good, but could use a little tweaking. I really didn't have time to mess with it this morning though I did use brown sugar and I used fresh chopped green onion and fresh minced garlic. I think that made a huge difference.

This marinade was ok.  I used it for pork chops and let them marinate for 3 hours.  While the marinade smelled good and made a nice coating on the meat when grilled, I didn't feel the meat had soaked up much of the flavor.  The chops were about 1/2 inch thick so maybe they should have marinated longer.  Anyway, it was easy to put together and my husband liked it alright.  Would probably not try this again on pork chops.

Good marinade.  I made it with salmon.  I only marinated the fish for about 2 hours before grilling on a Forman grill.  There was not enough flavor on the fish, so after I put the fish on the plates, I poured some of the marinade over it.  It tasted much better.  In the future, I will marinate the meat or fish longer.  I used Kikkoman Soy Sauce and did not have onion flakes so finely diced a vidalia onion which worked just fine.  I also did not have garlic powder, so I put a large clove of garlic in a garlic press and then scraped the garlic off the press and finely diced it more before putting it in the marinade.  I did the same thing with the fresh ginger rather than grating it.  The taste of the sauce was excellent.  I agree that you might want to thicken the sauce a bit with corn starch.  I think it would cling to the meat/fish a little better -- but if you marinate overnight, that would probably take care of the problem.

Quick, easy, already have the ingredients on hand. I bottle it and refrigerate the bottles full and add to sauces, meatloafs and stirfries. A keeper!

Loved it I only had time to marinade for 6 hours next time Ill do it over night.  I heated the marinade a bit so the sugar melted.  I also used a small fresh onion and 4 cloves of garlic chopped instead of dried and instead of water I used orange juice...it was fantastic better than that stuff I have been paying big bucks for.

Love, love, love this marinade!!!!  Tastes just like the store bought but without the high fructose corn syrup!  I read through the other reviews and substituted brown sugar for the white and used 3 teaspoons of onion powder instead of the onion flakes.  This was a HUGE hit with my family!

FINALLY!  A good chicken marinade.  I didn't have onion powder or flakes, but added extra garlic powder and added a lot of fresh ginger.  SO delicious--my chicken breasts were moist and wonderful even after being on the grill for a while.  YUM!!!

Excellent! This marinade had an unbelieveable taste, despite my forgetting to add onion flakes. Other changes made were reducing the amount of vinegar (I do this with all sauces and marinades as I am rather sensitive to the taste,) I used roughly three times the amount of ginger, simply because I grated too much and didn't want to waste the excess. I also used fresh garlic and tossed in some turmeric. Wonderful recipe that will be made many times in the future.

Wonderful for my chicken & veggie shish kebobs! I used real garlic in place of the powder, and threw in a little pineapple juice as well.  Let it marinade for about 8 hours and VOILA! delicious grilled teriaki chicken kebobs.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a fantastic marinade!  And it does make a lot, so you can marinade not only chicken but also pork and still have some left over.  The only substitution I made was onion powder for onion flakes.

Easy, excellent marinade... I marinated 2" sirloin chunks in a baggy for a few hours and then shish-kabob'd them.  I basted my kabobs during grilling for extra flavor (and smell!).  Very highly rated.

Wow!  Loved this marinade!  I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar like someone else said they did also.  I cut the recipe in half and marinated two KC Strip Steaks in it.  Yum!  I love sweet teriyaki marinades.  I cooked the steaks on the grill and basted them a couple of times with the extra marinade, making sure they cooked some after putting on the baste(because the steaks had been marinating in it).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It wasn't horrible - just not that good. I was expecting it to be better considering the rating and all of the reviews.  I used this marinade with steak and found it to be too vinegary and not sweet enough.  Next time I'll just buy it from the store.

Really tasty!  

I used it for beef shish kabobs.  It doesn't need overnight marinading but I did it overnight anyway and the meat was flavored and tender.

I think in the future I would use a more saucy, thicker kind of marinade to marinate overnight but this was very good anyway.  Will definitely be using this recipe for other meats.

Good basic recipe but needed more falvour. I added more onion and more  garlic powder, I love garlic. More spices would kick it up a bit. But overall it was tastey.

This was a very good sauce! I added a bit more sugar, probably about 1/3 cup, but all the other stayed the same. I did add some corn starch to thicken it up also. Made for a great teriyaki chicken and rice!

This was really good. I used it to marinate steak tips. I actually used a combination of white and brown sugar because I didn't have enough white. Marinated it overnight and it was great. Good flavor without being too sweet. Definitely will use on steak again but next time I will try it with chicken.

Very good, used this marinade for both tofu and beef tips. Excellent with both. Used some fresh diced red onion instead of flakes, dash of ground ginger instead of fresh and a minced garlic clove instead of garlic powder...because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.

I also tried this recipe and substituted OJ for the water. It was good, but the next time I tried substituting pineapple juice for the water and deleted the Worcestershire. This was excellent.

Great marinade!  I used real onion and garlic chopped fine.  I cooked it on the stove till the onions were soft.  Then cooled and marniated the meat.  Then used what was left to put on top of chicken after grilling.  Yummy....I would thicken the sauce next time.  Great tasting. Thanks.

Very good. I used half teriyaki sauce and half soy sauce for the soy sauce in the recipe and marinated chicken in it over night. We grilled it on the BBQ grill. Great flavor and guests seemed impressed.

This made some delicious marinade!  I went by the recipe except used olive oil and apple cider vinegar instead.  I also halved the recipe and it makes a bunch!  It was enough for at least 5 medium to larger chicken breasts.  I marinated my chicken for around 4-5 hours and OMG they had sooo much flavor.  This marinade does make the chicken cook up faster.  I had 3 larger breasts and they cooked at around 12 -13 min. on the grill on low heat around 350 degrees.  If you wanted this as a sauce, I would put it on the stove top and simmer until it reduces and thickens.  Otherwise it is too thin to use as a sauce, but is perfect as a marinade.  Thank you for this recipe, I will be using many  more times!

I did it very close to the recipe the first time, except onion powder instead of flakes. I found it a bit too salty and a bit too sweet for oven baked skinless boneless chicken thighs. 
 Second time, I reduced the soy sauce by a quarter cup and the sugar by a quarter cup, and subbed the vegetable oil for olive oil. Also, I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so I went without. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of Coleman's mustard powder for a little extra bite. The chicken breast slices are still marinating, and I set some of the sauce aside for when I combine the vegetables with the chicken for the stir fry.
 This is a great baseline recipe, and I will add and subtract things from it as the mood strikes me. But I will return to it as my go-to recipe for teriyaki that has ingredients most of us already have in our kitchen.
 I give it 4 stars.

This was so easy and so tasty!  I used organic tamari instead of soy sauce, and because I didn't have onion flakes I replaced it with 1 tsp of onion powder.  I poured 2 cups over the chicken in a bag, let it marinade for 6 hours (overnight would be good), and put the other cup in the fridge.  When ready to grill I put the extra cup of sauce in a pan and heated until sugar crystallized and thickened up. Then used it to brush on the chicken as it was grilling.  Turned out great.

My family gobbled up the chicken I made with this recipe.  I used 1/3 of this for the chicken and stored the rest for immediate future use. It's healthier than the marinades at the store, not to mention cheaper.

TO MAKE THIS MORE SCRUMPTIOUS, ADD SEVERAL HEAPING TBS. RAW SESAME SEEDS, AND A LOT OF MINCED GARLIC AS OPPOSED TO POWDER. I ALSO ADDED A BIT OF SHERRY AND USED OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE OIL.  AS THIS IS NOT THICK, YOU WILL GET THE BEST RESULTS BY BASTING YOUR FOOD WITH IT'S OWN COOKING JUICES ALONG WITH MORE MARINADE. THE LONGER YOU MARINADE THE BETTER, I THINK.  ANYWAY, IT'S A GREAT RECIPE!/arnetage68

We cut the recipe in half (and it still almost filled a salad bottle) to marinate our beef round sirloin tip steak.  Our family is not into really salty or sweet foods. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and maybe 1/8 cup sugar.  I added some marinade to the pan to simmer the steaks then mixed in a little corn starch to help thicken the gravy.  It was very salty for our taste.  Next time, (because I still have quite a lot left), I'm going to marinate the meat then grill it instead soaking it in the sauce.  Maybe then it won't be so salty.

I really don't like to leave a so-so review, but in this situation, it is all I can do.  It's not so bad if you don't expect teriyaki.  But my family loves teriyaki marinades, sauces, and glazes, and we just didn't really like this.  My only changes were to omit the ginger (it gives me headaches) and sub a small minced onion for the dried flakes, as I didn't have any flakes.  The flavors didn't really incorporate well, I didn't see the use for the vegetable oil, and it didn't taste like teriyaki.  It did tenderize the meat and give it a great color, but I will continue to search elsewhere for a fabulous teriyaki marinade.

I used this marinade on tri-tip steaks, marinaded for about 4 hours.  I was looking for something with a little more zip, maybe next time I won't add the water.  After trying my steak, I still added seasonings, which you shouldn't have to do w/ a marinade.  Guess I'll keep looking...

I've made this several times and have always been pleased. It's a very forgiving recipe as substitutions can be used and results still will produce a very nice teriyaki even if it has a slightly different flavor. For example, fresh garlic for garlic powder, omitting ginger for someone who doesn't care for it, adding a few dashes of black pepper for someone who is a pepper fanatic, etc. However, I have come to appreciate the flavor of certain ingredients above others: I tend to prefer brown sugar instead of white, I like fresh or minced garlic better than powder, and I think that the ginger really makes the marinade that much better.  I also make more than what I need, reserve some (bring the reserved amount to a boil and add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit) and serve it with dinner to drizzle on rice or veggies. When grilling, I use some of the marinade to brush on the chicken. By brushing light layers of the marinade onto the chicken every few minutes, the chicken ends up with a thick layer of this marinade and people LOVE it. If you do this just make sure that you remember safe food practices and don't mix raw with cooked.

I was looking for a teriyaki marinade recipe that was similar to my mom's, but with more depth. This recipe is excellent!
I did make some modifications to add some depth to the flavour. I substituted brown sugar for white, and rice wine vinegar for the distilled white. I on;y had about 3tbsp. of onion flakes so I added that amount. I also added 1 tsp. dried mustard powder, which was both for flavour and emulsifying the oil to make a nice, homogeneous marinade.
This recipe makes a lot, so I used half for marinating the meat, and to the other half I made a nice glaze on the stove top. Put reserved marinade in a saucepan, simmer, and add 1 tbsp. corn starch dissolved in 1/4 cup of cold water. Return to simmer for a minute or two, and you'll have a nice finishing sauce for your teriyaki dish.
I think this recipe wouldn't suffer from using a little less sugar. The stove top sauce was a tad on the sweet side.

Used fresh garlic and onion.  1/2 C of brown sugar. No white sugar.  Marinaded pork chops.  They were a hit!

Used this on asteak yesterday.  I substituted honey for the sugar...I just like honey better with soy sauce and I didn't have any dried onion flakes so I added some onion powder.  Really liked it, wish I would have left the steak marinade even more to soak up that wonderful flavor.

Loved it, and it's so simple!  I mixed this marinade up before leaving on a 4-day camping trip, where I packed frozen chicken breasts.  On the last day, I mixed the two together in the morning, so the chicken marinated for about 12 hours.  YUM.  Hubby says I could have let the chicken marinate for the entire 4 days; I may test him on that next time.  The only changes I made was to use onion powder instead of flakes (all I keep) and used ginger powder instead of fresh (that one was simplicity).

This recipe was awesome!  I made it as written except a tad less sugar and I added some minced garlic.  I think it would be good with a bit of honey in it, but I didn't add any this time.  Before marinading my steak, I put this teriyaki on the stovetop and added some corn starch so it was nice and thick.  Then I added my meat and marinaded for the day.  (I left it sit on the counter for about an hour first because I don't like to put piping hot food in the fridge).  This tasted delicious, used ingredients I had on hand, and saved me a trip to the store to buy generic bottled marinade.  I will use this recipe again and again.

This is an excellent marinade -- I used it on flank steak and marinated it for about six hours.  I did use 3/4 cup of Splenda (in the bag) instead of sugar and thought it worked fine. 

I look forward to trying it on pork tenderloins, chicken breasts and sirloin steak.  It makes a lot, so for a one or one-and-a-half pound steak, I would cut the recipe in half.

Amazingly good! Like others, I substituted brown sugar for the white and thickened my leftover sauce with cornstarch on the stove. I grilled marinated chicken, then served it over rice and steamed veggies with the thickened sauce to make really great teriyaki chicken bowls.

I made teriyaki kabobs often and didn't have any of the store bought marinade so I decided to give this a try.  My husband loved this!  The only thing i did different was i cut down on the garlic powder, used ground ginger and onion powder instead and added a drizzle of honey to it.  Fantastic!!  So easy, all stuff i had in my cupboards already,  i will never use the bottle marinades again!

Great recipe! I used this for steak and chicken kabobs when we had guests and it was a hit for everyone. Only adjustment I made was that I left out the ginger because I didn't have any. Definitely keeping this recipe!

I have used this three times over the past two weeks for marinating steaks and chicken.  It is very easy and made from ingredients I generally have on hand anyway.  My entire family loves the flavor it lends to the meat.  I add a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of the onion flakes.  I also 1/2 cup pineapple juice and cut water to 1/2 cup the last time I made this and it was very goo that way too!!!  The longer you can soak the meat the better the flavor!!!

Tasty. What amazed me the most was my EXTREMELY picky bf actually said " mmm what sauce is this, its good" That makes this a keeper. I cut the recipe to make 4 servings(plenty of sauce for 2-3 chicken breast) and didn't add very much water. thank you

This was okay. Nothing memorable though. This actually marinated overnight due to a change in dinner plans. We thought it was weak tasting and we just expected more flavor, I suppose. Thanks though.

I used this recipe on shish kabobs made with sirloin steak, green peppers, red onions, fresh mushrooms, new potatoes, and pineapple chunks.  I marinated the meat for 24 hrs. prior to grilling the kabobs on a charcoal grill.  My wife and I were attending an outside music festival with another couple, and this was the main course for the afternoon.  Everyone thought the kabobs were fantastic.  This will be the only recipe  I use in the future!

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers and used balsamic vinegar instead of white and also used brown sugar instead of white.  I halved the recipe for 4 bone in pork chops and there was plenty of marinade.  After we ate dinner I looked over the recipe and realized I forgot to put the worcestershire sauce in.  It was delicious without, but next time I will try it with to see if it makes a difference.  I also only used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce and the other 1/2 I used teriyaki sauce. Probably would be delicious on chicken also. Definitely a keeper.

Simple and delicious, I let the chicken soak in it for about 3 hours and baked, very nice. The sugar can be cut down by at least a couple of teaspoons if you wish and in order to get the sugar to dissolve I usually find I have to nuke it for a minute in the microwave to heat up the liquids or I'm stirring forever.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, but I would rather buy ready-made from the grocery store if it is going to taste the same. Good thought, and fun to try on my own, but just not that different from store-bought to merit the trouble.

I have been using this marinade recipe for several years because it is awesome!  It's great with pork, but EXCELLENT with chicken!  Grilled or broiled chicken made with this marinade is delicious by itself, but also fantastic in Chicken Salad a la Barbara (also from All Recipes.)  It makes quite a lot, so I usually only make 1/2 for a pound and a half of meat.

This is a very good marinade.  I made a few changes.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. (It's better for you.)   I used balsamic vinegar instead of white and brown sugar instead of granulated. I also added fresh rosemary and 1/8 of tsp of crushed red pepper to give it a little zing.  I used it for beef kabobs and it gave the meat a great flavor.

I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 3 hours and cooked in the oven.  It was very tasty!  The chicken was moist and tender.

A very good basic terriyaki marinade. It has a flavor similar to Yoshida's sauce.

I just made this steak again for some friends of ours and they liked it just as much as we did. One of the guys asked if I'd dip his burger in the marinade before I cooked it. He raved about his hamburger so much that everyone else wanted their burgers like that as well.  Now everyone jokes about us having the best burgers in town.

Whilst mixing the ingredients, I mixed the sugar with hot water, which dissolved the sugar quickly, added the other ingredients, let it sit for about 30 minutes to give the dried onion chips  a chance to soften in the liquid. Marinated boneless chicken thighs, cooked them on charcoal grill with mesquite chips. Trying to not eat them all right now.

This is amazing! I made it exactly as instructed. it's probably enough marinade for 6-8 chicken breasts but the flavor is great. Cooked on the stove (just be careful not to burn the minced onions) but this is the best teriyaki chicken I've ever made!!!

I made it 7/29/19 and haven't cooked the chicken yet.  More later.  I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, brown sugar, and fresh garlic thru a press.  It does taste good if  you try it before pouring on the chicken.

Great recipe! If I may, I always omit vegetable oil, that’s so 30 years ago, Peanut works great with a splash of toasted sesame oil for fun. Also try with pineapple juice instead of water and cut the sugar in half with a touch of plum purée to kick it up a little. Really liked the base recipe though. Good one!

Awesome taste, used all fresh Ginger, White Onion and Garlic. I let sit and blend for a couple of hours then added to boneless skinless chicken thighs for Teriyaki Sandwiches. I also used brown sugar and xtra virgin olive oil and 3 tbsps of Sambal Oelek Chili paste.

Its great, have made it twice, will certainly do so again. First time was chicken on the grill in skewer form, second time it was raining so the meat and veggies all went on a tray in the oven for 15 min on 400 and turned out great. The fresh ginger is key in this, don't ignore it. I'm sure we'll use it on beef or salmon in the future.

This was very delicious! I made a few changes I replaced white sugar with brown and added pineapple chunks. I also used fresh smashed garlic instead of garlic powder. The pineapple chunks with the juice makes it so much better! I used it as a marinade then made extra and added cornstarch for thicker consistency to pour on top of the chicken

It was ok. I cut recipe in half because I was only using it for a pound of chicken. I used a fork and put many holes on the chicken thinking not would make chicken beyond delicious, but it fell flat. I marinated in fridge for 6-7 hrs and felt it slightly tasted like teriyaki, but it wasn't amazing. It was a simple recipe, so I'm not sure what happened.

I stuck to the recipe except for ingredients I didn't have on hand.  E.G. I used onion powder. also didn't taste it until i used it in my final dish which was 'slow cooker teriyaki pork tenderloin' also from allrecipes.  that called for the teriyaki sauce plus chicken broth and more aromatics .  Wasn't too  concerned about saltiness ( i am southern after all)  but after the additional ingredients and a few hours in the slow cooker it was fabulous.  my whole family said this is a keeper.

The marinade itself is great, but I gotta say...next time I'm just buying a store-bought marinade due to the time this took and cost. It got expensive buying all the ingredients.

This turned out very good.  The only change I made was substituting coconut sugar for the white sugar.  Yum!

Excellent marinade! I used brown sugar in place of white sugar, and I add a little toasted sesame oil, which gives it a sightly smokey flavor that I like. I've used white vinegar and rice vinegar, both a great. I've also used fresh or powdered onion/garlic/ginger, which all tastes great too. Have tried several other teriyaki marinades, but this is the one I'm sticking with.

I did about 1/4 of the recipe for 2 large chicken breast.  I used a meat hammer to get the chicken breasts to cook evenly .  I did not have fresh ginger so I used ginger seasoning (1/4-1/2 of a tsp as I'm not the biggest ginger fan).  I put in some dehydrated garlic in addition to the garlic powder as I like garlic.  Let it sit overnight in the fridge before cooking them quick on the stovetop.  Very juice and flavorful!  Next time I will try them on the grill.

It makes plenty and I will cut the recipe in half. Another review used brown sugar instead of the white, which I will try a second time. For marinating it was fine in consistency, but would have liked it to be a little thicker. Maybe sticky. Thinking of thickening it up to a sauce. Flavor was good. It takes me three times to get a recipe the way I like it. I will definitely do this recipe again for it is worth the tweak.

Love this recipe! Soo good we might make it in bulk and can it. Used 1/4 cup white sugar and the rest brown sugar. Didn't use ginger. Smells wonderful!

Followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of adding two cloves crushed fresh garlic and green onion powder. Because I wanted a saucier sauce, I added cornstarch slurry and simmered for a few minutes to thicken. I marinated half a pork loin for almost 24 hours. It smelled heavenly. Sadly, the flavor did not penetrate the meat and the sugars caused it to burn on the grill (prolly our bad--should have baked). IMHO this would be much better to use as a sauce instead of marinade.

I marinated a couple steaks exactly as described. The steaks turned out great and the flavor was really good. It felt like something was missing from the marinade though...maybe using honey instead of sugar, or brown sugar...something to add a little more body.

I made this to marinade chicken.  It has great flavor.  I saved some back and used it to top the chicken after grilling.  I'll make this again, perhaps trying shrimp next time.

This is a good basis for teriyaki marinade, but I felt it needed the benefit of freshening up a bit. I used 3 minced garlic cloves, substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the vinegar, and green onion for the onion flakes. I also used molasses instead of the white sugar. I know it's a change from the original recipe, but when you can use fresh ingredients, instead of non fresh, your food always taste better.

I had to substitute Lime Ponzu for soy and onion powder for onion flakes.   I used chopped garlic instead of powdered and marinated 3.5 pounds of chicken for 8-9 hours, grilled and it was very tasty. I also left out the sugar completely

Tasty stuff. I used fresh minced red onion and garlic instead of dried and powder, peanut oil instead of vegetable, and apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar to suit my own taste. It came out great. Thanks for the easy delicious recipe.

This was an easy marinate with most ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have onion flakes, so I used onion powder and it still tastes great! We grilled our chicken, but I'm sure baked would be great too. I'll definitely use it again!

This was good for something quick. Works GREAT on Salmon!! This recipe is salty from the soy sauce but helps the salmon with flavor. Almost like I cured it first. I split the recipe after making it,used half on boneless skinless chicken breast for 5hr. then BBQ.  I use the other half on salmon the next night 5hr.then BBQ.
I also used onion powered (i didn't have the flakes). I prefer to use all fresh and I'll use low sodium soy next time if I'm not doing Salmon.

Excellent for chicken and you don't need to marinate for very long to get the flavor. I didn't have fresh ginger so used powdered and used red wine vinegar as that's what I had. Didn't even use exact measurements and it turned out great! The Worcestershire sauce made all the difference!

Very tasty. Substituted brown for white sugar. Only 1/2 cup soy sauce, EVOO for vegetable oil, and used rice wine vinegar. Maybe try honey next time. Threw the marinade into my stir fry once the chicken was cooked, excellent!

This was Yummy!  I used it to overnight marinade a boneless pork sirloin roast.  It was soo tender and moist and the flavor was great.  No salt or pepper needed! Using it for a beef roast next.

I realized that I had not marinated the beef strips I intended to use in a stir fry for tonight's dinner, so I halved the recipe and added a cornstarch slurry to thicken into a sauce. It went over fabulously with the family and I will definitely be using it as a marinade or reducing it to a sauce again. The only change I made to the halved recipe was to use minced garlic in place of the powder, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and rice vinegar in place of white. I also used a little less soy sauce to make sure it wouldn't be too salty when I reduced it. This was a good jumping point to make something with the ingredients I already had on hand. For those curious, my stir fry consisted of chopped broccoli, diced portabella mushrooms, julienned carrots, diced celery, sliced onions, and diced green peppers with thinly sliced stir fry beef that I got on manager's special at my local grocery store. Super delish!

Loved it. Used real onions and garlic and it was even better. Just threw them in a food processor with a cup of the liquid. Great for grilling.

I've made dozens if teriyaki marinades, sauces, and glazes, but unfortunately this one ends up on my black list. I think the vinegar ruined it for me. I like the idea of an acid to break down the meat, but I think citrus works better and doesnt affect the flavor as much. To each their own!

I am planning on using this whenever I need teriyaki. It's very close to store bought. Perhaps it needs a dash of salt ... I added garlic.

DELICIOUS!  This marinade was so easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used chicken thighs which I marinated for about 6 hours.  I am going to try this with flank steak next time.  The only change I might make is to switch out the onion flakes for onion powder.  Thank you Mary Savard for sharing your DELICIOUS recipe!

I used this marinade on a large package of chicken drumsticks, and let it sit overnight. In the morning I turned them all over before church. When I got home, all I had to do was light the grill! It was delicious!

Made the marinade (cut recipe in half) in my over-sized wok, added strips of boneless skinless chicken breast (5 breasts), let it cook for 10 minutes, added in fresh broccoli, and some frozen stir-fry veggies. It was a hit!!

Super recipe! I needed something quick to throw together for dinner for the family and had nearly all of the ingredients on hand. This is a VERY forgiving recipe and even with a few ingredients missing and by just throwing in the things I had we had a terrific meal of chicken, veggies, and noodles stir-fry on the table in less than 20 minutes. Thanks for an awesome weeknight meal keeper!

Awesome marinade.  I didn't change a thing except used dried ginger as I didn't have any fresh. I used it on chicken, marinated it for about 4 hours and it kept it juicy and gave it great flavor.

This is absolutely wonderful! I halved the recipe, and used this to marinate pork chops to make fried rice with (using my own recipe), and it turned out perfect! I even used some of the leftover marinade as the flavouring sauce in the rice itself, instead of my usual recipe, and it was great!

This marinade is very good.  I didn't have ginger the first time I made it and left it out.  My husband was afraid it was going to be too sweet (which he dislikes) but he liked it very much.  My 6 year old finnicky eater told me it was delicious.  Tonight I am making it and adding a little ginger, just a few shakes, to see if we like it.

This is now our go-to marinade for chicken. We just made it again last night and i think we should cut it down by half. We generally cook two big breasts that have been sliced thinner length wise. We end up pouring out more than half the marinade.

This was delicious!  There was plenty of flavor, but nothing was too overpowering.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I pounded down just a little.  I also used fresh garlic.  I marinated for 3 hours.  Thank you!  This will be added as one of our regulars!

Yummy! This is really good. I was out of onion powder so had to substitute minced onions...still great! I didnt have time to marinate the complete time...maybe only an hour, so I just continued basting while it cooked in the oven until carmelized and browned.

It's a pretty good marinade, but I didn't find it as good as store bought. I used chicken breast and marinaded the meat for five bours. I'll probably make it again.

Followed the recipe except I did not have garlic powder so I used minced garlic instead and it worked great. I marinated for about 24 hours. Will use this again for sure.

Tasty!  I don't measure spices, but went lighter on the garlic and minced onion & heavier on the fresh ginger.  Marinated chicken tenders about 20h and grilled (done fast!  basted, too) for Father's Day along with baby red potatoes & asparagus (olive oil, salt, pepper).  Daddy loved it and toddlers ate it all up!

This was pretty good. I used it for thighs (marinated for about 6 hours), and breasts (marinated for about 2 h ours), and it made them very juicy and tender.  My only complaint would be I thought it would be..more substantial, and give it a stronger flavour.  Everyone else raved about it though, so maybe I am just being too critical of my own cooking. I wish I would have read the other reviews closer and tried it with brown sugar, instead of the white. I am going to try that next time I make it.

This recipe has great teriyaki flavour - I use it in my stir-frys all the time.  Just thicken it with a little bit of cornstarch.

This was a very good marinade. I had to make it without ginger but it was still very delicious.

Delicious! I let it sit for a couple of hours before I used it and it was great. Also, I used olive oil instead of peanut oil since I didnt have any and it was still very tasty.

This is a great recipe for marinating tougher cuts of meat.  I used this for beef short ribs (aka Maui ribs) and it turned out very tender.  The store bought version tastes horrible.  To enhance the flavour, use fresh garlic, ginger and onions!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The flavor was good, but I used a very thick (about 2 inch) piece of steak, (The store called it "london broil", but I think it was probably bottom round)and marinated it for 3 days. The marinade didn't penetrate very far into the meat, although I probably should have poked holes in it. I'll try this again, possibly with chicken or pork, or a thinner cut of steak.

This is an exceptional marinade.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe except a longer marinade time (overnight, so about 16 hours total).  I did ribeye steaks in this as well as chicken breasts and then put them on the grill, and they were fabulous.  Our guests asked for a copy of the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.
