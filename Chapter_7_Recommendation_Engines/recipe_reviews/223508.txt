Used the change servings feature and scaled down to 3 (for us, it was more than 4 servings), and followed the recipe to the letter.  Only thing I did differently was leave off the avocado simply because I didn't have one on hand, however, I think that would be a nice topper to this gazpacho.  We like gazpacho, and although this definitely is a sweeter version, the veggie flavor comes through nicely.  It has a good balance of sweet versus spicy.  As we all know, we "eat with our eyes," and for me, that was a negative about this cold soup...it just doesn't present itself great.  For us, any gazpacho or cold soup is something that's a little outside the box and maybe just a little elegant, so that drab color was a downer.  I think all of the parsley and cilantro darkened it, and you lose that vibrant and bright red color of the strawberries.  Do give it some chilling time in the fridge, as the flavor definitely improves.  A long ingredient list and lots of chopping, but I would make this again.

My daughter and I loved this. Mom liked it. Daughter's [picky] bf only took a couple bites. Daughter's client couldn't quite get the concept of a cold soup, so he put it on a chicken taco and his cauliflower - like a salsa (= Slightly tweaked . . .  I left out the tarragon and parsley, and I threw everything, except about half a pint of strawberries, about 1/3 the cucumber, and the avocado, in my food processor. Simple and yummy. Not sure I would make this version often - simply because I think I can get the grape tomatoes that I love at less cost than strawberries - but I would make it again (=
