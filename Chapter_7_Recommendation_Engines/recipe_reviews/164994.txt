Here's how to turn this 4 star recipe into a 5 star:  1) Don't cook the tortillas for 8 minutes-probably just 4 or 5.  You just want them a little crispy-not burnt. 2) Add 1 pkg of taco seasoning mix to the ground beef, once its cooked. 3) Top with Tex Mex Cheese, chopped tomatoes, green onions, (black olives, if you wish), and a dollop of sour cream. 4) Voila!! You've automatically added an extra star!  Enjoy!  I made these for "Cinco De Mayo".  They were a big hit: Even with my picky 4 year old niece!

These were good, but took some time.
(I made a number of changes.)
I used picante sauce instead of pizza sauce & added chopped black olives & green chiles to give more flavor. I also added taco seasoning to the ground beef & used refried black beans. I left out the onions & tomatoes but added shredded lettuce. My family loved these & said that they were so much better than Taco Bell (thank goodness!)

I used salsa instead of tomato sauce.  I also added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I topped the 'pizza' with chopped onion, chopped tomatoes, and cheese.  After baking I sprinkled with chopped scallions instead of cilantro.  Also made guacamole and served it with sour cream and rice.  Really quite tasty!!

I thought this was very good.  I gave 4 stars because I feel it needed a few changes.  I used enchilada sauce in place of the pizza sauce.  Also, I cooked the ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning, to add flavor.  It turned out great!

THIS WAS GREAT!  "Better than Taco Bell," said my son!  Now, that's a compliment!  I used some of the ideas from others, based on what I knew my kids would like.  First off, I cooked my ground beef just like I would do for tacos (that includes lots of seasonings and salsa).  I did have to heat the tortillas for 8 minutes to get them just right.  Instead of pizza sauce, I combined a can of Hatch green chili enchilada sauce and Hatch Tex-Mex enchilada sauce and used that instead. I left off the tomatoes and cilantro.  So, I know what you're thinking--it was basically just a taco.  I will disagree, though.  It is the baked flour tortillas that make this so good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Being a vegetarian, I used SOYrizo instead of ground beef. It comes packaged and seasoned like regular chorizo and it was actually quite delicious. i also sprinkled a little bit of cotija on top adding a great flavor and it doesn't melt! it was great!

As written, this is a 4 star recipe at most, but with simple modifications it is easily deserving of 5 stars. I browned the meat (I used ground turkey) as directed, with just a little salt and pepper, but after tasting it, I knew that wasn't going to cut it. After browning, I added a package of taco seasoning. I also used hot taco sauce on top instead of pizza sauce for more Mexican flavor. We really enjoyed these and they were really quick to prepare, will make again. Thank you :)

Yum! It was very good. We also used salsa instead of pizza sauce. I did slightly burn the tortillas so make sure you watch them. I don't think you quite need eight minutes.

Fast & easy!  Substituted salsa on top instead of pizza sauce, and it was a huge hit with my kids.  Nice change from the usual tacos & burritos fare . . . Can be done with just refrieds (instead of beef) for lower fat content.

another average recipe! I made this as directed and my family was not happy (teenage boys too!) I will go back to my old recipe which is similar and slow cooks in the crock pot.

I tweaked this a bit, but it turned out great! I fried the tortillas for a minute or so on each side. Then, I layered chili on top of the the first tortilla, since the chili has beans and beef in it. Then, I topped the other tortilla, and spread salsa on top of that. I used dried cilantro (had it on hand), added chopped green onion, a dash of garlic powder and oregano, and served it with a side of sour cream.

I followed the review tips (thanks everyone) and  used the taco seasoning for the meat which I think made a huge difference.   I also put finely chopped onions in the meat.  To make it a little lighter I used fat-free refried beans, wheat tortillas and I topped it with olives and light sour cream.  My teenage daughter's favorite thing is Taco Bell's mexican pizza. She thought even the lighter version was better!  I will be making this again.  Definitely follow the review tips on this recipe, that's why it only got 4 stars for me.

This is very good! And so fast and easy to make. From over reviews I added taco seasoning to the beef for my falvour. I put cheese in the tortilla sandwich as well. On the top tortilla I just put salsa and cheese! Will keep and make this recipe again!

This is a great alternative to regular tacos. We did chicken because we prefer it to beef and I topped it off with sauce. I think we'll do this once in a while instead of tacos to switch things up!

I thought this was wonderful.  Very similar to Taco Bell (I refuse to eat fast food anymore, so I missed this!)  I did make the changes that most people suggest:  I used taco seasoning and salsa instead of pizza sauce.

These were ok for a quick meal, but we definitely weren't impressed.  Not sure if I'll ever make them again, but if I do, I'll probably change the recipe up a bit and make it more to our tastes.

As other reviewers suggested, I added taco seasoning to the beef, and used salsa instead of pizza sauce. My kid, who seems to get pickier every day, gobbled it up... so that's good enough for me! This one's going into regular rotation.

Good, everyone liked. Learned from my mistakes though, you don't need to cook the tortillas until they are hard.

Not totally to my tastes as written, plain ground beef with only salt and pepper as seasoning is pretty unappetizing, I used a packet of taco seasoning on mine. And pizza sauce hits a wrong note too, salsa or enchilada sauce is a much better option. Top with a dab of sour cream!

Followed this almost exactly, except for using canned diced tomatoes on top, 1 can of refried beans and 1 cup of homemade black beans mixed together and no cilantro, since that is a personal preference. Made a double recipe, and it was plenty for 8 adults. Baked 20 tortillas on the shelves in my oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees to get them really crispy- worked so well! Was a hit for my daughter's birthday meal. Disclaimer: her favorite restaurant is Taco Bell, so this was a mimic of their Mexican pizza. Was okay, but top tortilla did not "stick" to bottom, so some people flipped the top upside down to make a Mexican pizza tortilla sandwich.

5.9.18  I did add some taco seasoning to the ground beef and just couldn’t see pizza sauce on this, so I sub’d picante sauce. Also, I baked the tortillas only 5 minutes, concerned about them turning out like a tortilla chip if cooked for 8 minutes and then back into the oven for the cheese to melt later.  This takes no time at all to prepare, and was pretty darn good for a weeknight dinner.

Only changes were to season the beef with taco seasoning and used enchilada sauce in place of pizza sauce.

My fam really loved this. I used chicken instead of beef and didn`t have any beans.
I made a pizza sauce from this site and we all loved it!
