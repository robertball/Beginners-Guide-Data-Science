How disappointing! I followed the recipe and the cake was flat! What a waste of money as it went in the garbage. Missing ingredients are the eggs - amount from the cake mix directions and use either oil (or) applesauce - not both.

This cake recipe failed for me. I followed it just as written and it came out of the oven flat.

I am FURIOUS!! Recipe has a mistake (as others note)! I was in a huge rush to find a "RED Cake" (as my son requested for his 5th birthday). I had no time to spare and copied this recipe and quickly made it. As soon as I put it in the oven I had the feeling something was wrong. So I came back and read the other reviews. However (after discarding the first cake) I re-made the cake WITH 3 EGGS and added 3 tablespoons of Chambord and it was very tasty. The center still didn't rise as much as the edges but it was usable when eggs are included.

Same thing happened to me......my son requested a red cake for his birthday so I quickly made this recipe without reading the reviews. Cake was flat & had a very odd texture. Oddly enough half the cake still was eaten just not by me. Will never bother with this one again. I wish I didn't even have to give it 1 star.

This tasted really good. It was moist and sweet, and it reminded me of when I eat cherry jello with whipped cream(yes, I actually do! What a coincidence).
