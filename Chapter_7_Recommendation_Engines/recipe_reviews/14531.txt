I have made a version of this recipe for several years and have some suggestions, mix 6 tablespoons McCormick Ckicken seasoning with 1 tablespoon garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, Accent (optional) and 1/2 teaspoon Cayenne pepper. Loosen skin and spread 1/2 of mixture under skin, dont miss the legs, rub remaining mixture on outside of chicken. Let sit in fridge overnight. Use a 16 oz. can of beer so that a couple of inches stick out the bottom to grab with the tongs after cooking, very important, spray the can with Pam to make removal much easier. put a tablespoon of garlic and onion powder in beer to season. 
Fill smoker box with hickory chips and cook chicken at 350 for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours for 5 lb. bird. Skin will be a deep mahogany and it will taste fantastic

Gotta love this recipe. I have made this quite a few times on the grill AND in the oven (350 degress for about 1 1/2 hours). There are stands "chickcan rack" on the market that make this quite easy too. I add a "montreal chicken blend" to the recipe and a small potato or onion in the neck cavity to hold in the vapors. Thanks for sharing.

MAAAVELOUS DAHLING!!!  Make SURE you don't overcook this baby (devastating!!!) Guaranteed to be the most delicious chicken you've ever tasted!  Also most of the fun of this is DRINKING HALF THE BEER!!! (Discard???--whatever there, chief!)  No grill?--bakes easily at 350 for about 15 minutes per pound--if ya lather the ole' girl up with dijon and honey as one member recommended it's even better (if that's possible?) OH YEAH--forget that flimsy foil cookie sheet--basic physics here folks...just doesn't have the tensile strength to handle a 7lb. roaster carried from the counter to the oven or grill--especially when precariously perched on top of a partial can o' brew! Regarding that--you can position the legs forward in tripod formation for better balance.  Use a glass baking dish--a bit more cleanup but you won't look like the village idiot when you have to lift it!  Try this recipe with any fowl--you'll be glad you did!!!  (Use fruit preserves of choice on the outside of a duck--yeah baby!!!)

The first time I tried this - I did it on the grill. I have a very small grill and did not realize it should be covered. I could not do it on my grill because I could not close the lid - The chicken was too tall and well it never cooked. Now I make Beer Butt Chicken in the oven. I put it in my roasing pan, Bake it for  1 1/2 - 2 hours at 350 (don't need to cover it) lol. I also Put in some Potatoes (huge bakers) at the same time (Not in the roasting pan - on the oven rack). I use a funnel to add the butter and spices to the beer in the can. It is better to use warm beer - because when adding melted butter to cold beer it foams up.  I bought the can holder for beer butt chicken - It makes it stand up alot easier and stays in place when you Take it out to transport it to the cutting board.  YUMM !!! The chicken is browned to perfection and So tender the meat just falls off the bone. It is Awesome!!!! Thankyou so much for the recipe.

Ok!  Here's the trick to getting the can off/out of the bird.  Spray the beer can top and sides (Not bottom) with non-stick cooking spray before placing the chicken on it.  The can simply slides right off! :-)

Love the recipe!  We always add more spice, and you can also maranade the chicken in a bag beforehand insted of th rub.

This is one fantastic chicken recipe... it comes out extremely moist and flavorful. Have done this recipe many different ways. You can use half a can of ginger ale if you're out of beer. I usually add some BBQ sauce to the half can of liquid, and rub spices (garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt) into the bird. Have made it on the grill but I really think the oven is easier. Just set the chicken in a 13x9 pan and bake in a 350 oven for about 1hr 30min. Comes out delicious every time!

I have made this a number of times over the years and this is my favorite way to prepare grilled chicken.  Few words of advice: invest in a beer butt chicken holder (makes it much more stable and less likely to tip off making a huge mess), spray the can and/or holder with non-stick spray for easy removal, put a drip pan under the chicken to avoid nasty flare-ups.  For best flavor, rub the chicken with the seasonings the night before and let rest in the fridge.  I have also done this with a brined chicken which is extremely juicy and tender.

This is incredible!  My 18" Weber was too small, so I cooked it indoors at 350 for about 1-1 1/2 hours.  Also, I didn't have beer handy, so I used an empty Coke can that I filled half-way up with some wine & threw some garlic and basil leaves into the mix.  This is the best chicken ever - with the upright posture, the fat drains off and if you line the roasting pan with foil, cleanup is so easy. This is how we're making chicken from now on!

We've been doing this method for a while on a gas grill -and with superb results each time.  We have tried garlic and herb spices, lemon pepper, BBQ, blackening seasoning, you name it we've tried it.  Don't worry - beer isn't needed really.  ANY liquid works and same goes for your taste of seasonings.  Recently I tried using hickory chips to smoke the chicken.  It was simply awesome.

If you want a world class meal, and one which will impress friends and family this is it.  It's EASY and AWESOME.

Best of all it's delicious, and healthy!

***PERSONAL NOTE - the chicken thigh should be at 170 degrees when it's done...never hurts to rely on a visual check of the juices, but temperature is important.

This chicken is awesome!  Next time, I will rub
the spices in and marinate in a zip-lock bag overnight.  I used a gas grill with both burners
on low heat (with the lid closed) and basted it a
few times.  Used a disposable roasting pan with
a cookie sheet underneath because I was cooking 2
chickens.  When I tasted the wonderful drippings
collecting in the pan, I decided to throw in sliced onions and potatoes.  Amazing flavor!  In my family, I've never seen an entire chicken get eaten with no leftovers.  Even the wings were crispy and delicious.

I would have gave 5 stars, but the one I have been making for years is much better.  It's like this, In the beer can add half an onion, 2 garlic cloves, 3 - 4 peppercorns, then for the chicken 1/2 stick butter melted add 1 tsp garlic power 1 tsp paprika 1/2 tsp salt and pepper and 1/2 thyme mix with butter, loosen skin on chicken breast, add 1/4 of mix under the skin and rub the rest witht he seasong.  This makes for juicy flavorful chicken.  enjoy

Oooooh, this one's a keeper.  The name amuses me each time I make it and my kids love it.  What more could  you want?   Couple of notes:  I think you could get by with less butter in the can; might try that next time.  Don't try to omit the butter in the can and just use the spices...I did that and it foamed all over the place when I put them in.    Also, don't try smearing unmelted butter/spice mixture on the bird...I tried that but it congealed on the cold bird and was not an improvement.  Aren't you glad I tried those bonehead moves so you don't have to?  ha ha.  Just make it and ENJOY!!!!!

Great recipe, I have been making this for years and love it! It always comes out very flavorful and juicy. Make sure you add some liquid smoke and garlic powder to the half beer and also poke a few extra holes in the top of the can(this allows the flavors to basically steam the bird. I always rub the chicken with the following seasoning before hand( cayenne,garlic,paprika,salt&pepper)and plug the neck cavity with a small apple or onion.Throw it in the fridge for a few hours or longer if time allows. Tastes equally as good in the oven as on thebbq in my opinion.1 1/2 hours@350  Guaranteed every time!

This chicken is kick  - or should I say kick Butt! I only have one problem w/ the Recipe "Discard 1/2 the beer"? No Friggin way! Drink the Beer... in fact drink several beers while you wait. U got 3hrs before it's done! I slamed down a bunch and was Really Ready for that Chicken. I pulled out my knife, slit the breast after 3hrs - no tmp probe. That was the best chicken I ever had! There was chicken debris from my eye-brows to the end of my beard! I'll make it again this weekend after I pick up a case of Beer!

Melt in your mouth DELICIOUS!  The temp here in the "Windy City" is just about 60 degrees, so I decided to uncover the grill and make this morbid, but delicious recipe (although it didn't fit on my grill, so I had to bake it on the bottom rack in the oven).  To my dismay, I only had 1/2 Tbsp. of paprika, so I used 1 1/2 Tbsp. of McCormick Montreal Chicken seasoning.  Oh, by the way step #3 of the directions is backwards, I'm sure it should be: baste the chicken with the melted butter and THEN to add the remaining butter etc. to the beer.  Great recipe, thanks Barrie!!

A wonderfuly moist chicken!  I've used many of the other reviewers suggestions and they are all great.  When I bake the chicken in my indoor oven I have always added 1 tablespoon liquid smoke to the can, to achieve that outdoor grill flavor.  (Just one time, my smoke alarm did not like that idea! It's never been a problem again.  I guess it was either feeling unusually testy, or super-alert that day!)

I've used this method for years with wonderful results. My chicken is generally done in about 1 1/2 hours rather than the 3 stated. I always stuff a small potato or onion into the neck opening and close the skin with toothpicks. This keeps the moisture inside the chicken. Delicious!

This is great.  We did two roasting chickens on our gas grill using indirect heat and they turned out great.  I used a BBQ dry rub on the inside and oil and rub on the outside.  Getting them to stand was a little tricky, but adjusting the legs and can like a tripod worked well.  It took about 2 hrs for both chickens. No peaking, it takes longer for it to cook if you let the heat out. Also oil the can for easier removal.

I have made a recipe similar to this for years, and everyone raves about it. My changes are: Add chopped onion and garlic to the beer - nothing else. If you can't use beer, use a soda can filled with chicken broth and onion/garlic. Greasing the outside of the can will make it easier to remove from the chicken after it is cooked! (I spray mine with PAM) I lightly oil the outside of the chicken, and then use a rub of brown sugar - chili powder - pepper - salt - garlic powder & onion powder; mixed to your taste. This adds flavor and crisps the skin nicely.  Keeping your grill at around 300 - 350 works best, and IMO smaller chickens cook quicker (obviously) and have more flavor. Leftovers are great for chicken salad or quesadillas. (I always cook an extra chicken to insure I have leftovers.)  For a special dinner, use cornish hens and small juice cans...each guest gets their own!

Ok it was different, but just not to my taste. I did it twice to be sure I hadn't done it wrong the first time. I can get a crispy-skinned tastier chicken roasting it the traditional way. And have additional bonuses therefrom of tasty stuffings and great gravies. This was too much faffing around for me and I found it unecessarily messy.

Great recipe! One tip - never "discard" half of the beer when you could DRINK IT! :) hehe Just my two cents...

This was great and meat fell off the bones!  Didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and some seasoned salt.  I baked it, didn't grill.  As others have written, 30 min @ 350 for every pound is perfection!

My big plans to this on the grill were spoiled by rain, but it was still great from the oven.  I did two, side by side in a foil lined roasting pan.  I rubbed the skin with the seasonings and then brushed on the butter.  It took about 1 hour 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Everyone loved it- we ate one for dinner and the other will be great in a chicken salad for lunch today.  Thanks for this!  The chickens stood fine without a fancy holder- I was a little worried that I didn't have one.  Very easy and soso yummy!

wow, I have making this recipe for a couple of years now and didn't realize I never reviewed it.  This is a great recipe to use on the grill and also in the oven at 350 for close to 2 hours.  I bought 2 holders at the store that holds the cans and then place the chicken on top.  I rub spices on chicken skin and roll up balls of tin foil to stuff into the opening on top of the chicken.  My family loves this chicken.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Been doing this for well over 10 years.  I have always done this with indirect heat never direct heat on the grill.

This is fantastically moist. Everyone must try this recipe. It is a no fail beer can chicken. I gave it a dry rub and started it on this pit that way. Everyone loved it but the one comment they all said was it isn't seasoned as good as your chicken normally is. This time I have let it marinated in my usual Italian dressing, mustard, season all, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. This chicken will melt in your mouth. FYI the mustard makes steaks and chicken all that much more moist and tender.

This is an easy, great tasting, and fun recipe.  My fiancee likes fancy fixins, but I do more of a "home style" approach.  Anyway, this suited us both.  I made this in the oven, in a rectangular pan, since it's winter in Chicago.  Three words for simplifying the balancing problem others have complained about: Heineken keg cans.  They have a nice wide base and short profile.  I had no problem getting the 5lb bird to stand at attenion.  Try it!

Fun recipe and it is very moist - so moist I wasn't sure it was cooked all the way, but it was!  I made sure to baste it a few times, but that's all.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  Don't forget to line your pan w/ foil for easier clean up!

nice & moist  "delicious"  Purchased a rack that holds the can at walmart  {$5.00} so no worry about toppling over.  Also put a small potato or wad of foil in the neck while cooking this helps to steam the chicken from the inside and keeps the chicken nice and moist.  APRIL 29,2010  Learned something new for those of you that don't have a rack.  When using a beer can, use a 24 oz. can to insure that the ckn won't topple over.  7/11/2010  correction that's a 16 oz can.

A fantastic recipe that we thoroughly enjoyed!  Like other reviewers, we made a rub of rosemary, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika.  I plan on using the remains of the chicken to make an awesome chicken soup!  This will be a family favorite for a long time!

I have made this in the oven many times and have found a few helpful hints along the way.  1st for a normal size chicken, bake it for almost an hour at 350.  Make sure your rack is low enough.  Use empty soup cans, they are much more sturdy than the beer cans, and put it in/on a shallow glass dish (I noticed the metal cookie sheet would warp).  Put some of the dry seasonings under the skin for extra flavor.  Baste chicken often but fast to ensure the flavor.  I haven't tried other spices, the garlic salt and paprika are perfect!  Careful not to burn the butter mixture when heating. Enjoy!

This chicken was so juicy.  I was really surprised.  We made it in the oven (roughly 2 hours @ 350), I'm anxious to try it on the grill.  I tried to grab the chicken to put it on a plate and the juices were literally squirting out of it.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sprayed the beer can with Pam before cooking, but I still had a difficult time getting it out of the chicken.  Next time I guess I'll have to really coat it.  

The only thing about this chicken was that the insides weren't as flavorful as the top layers of meat, but dipping it in the sauce made with the butter made it taste great.

McCormicks puts out a Rotisserie chicken seasoning in a plastic jar(located in spice section of store} Just sprinkle it all over chicken inside and outside. Wrap chicken in plastic wrap, or zip bag and put in fridge for at least 4 hours remove from plastic and set on beer can. Follow Barries cooking time.You can also put herbs in the can.Also an important step, put a small potato, lemon half, or small onion in neck cavity to trap the vapor.I'm going to do one of my Thanksgiving turkeys this way. I'll use a tall boy beer and some wood chips on grill.

Wow guys I made this on 9/3/06 for labor day cookout, my family love this, they also got a kick out of how I sat the chicken on the beer can and fed it beer during the cooking process. We started calling it drunken chicken. I use the rub from the (Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style) recipe on this site, I lifted the skin and used rub there too. I stuff half of an onion in the bird, filled my can with part water, beer, butter and fed the chicken beer through out the cooking, my chicken came out a dark golden brown and was very very moist with wonderful flavor. A MUST TRY FOR ANY DAY!!!!.... Also if using a small grill and top will not fit because of beer can you can wrap your grill in foil over chicken to seal, can't beat that grill taste.

Chicken to die for! I know it sounds weird but I used a lemon-pepper infused chicken and it turned out AMAZING! Moist, flavorful, and for the most part, easy to make. I plan to bring this to upcoming family holidays and functions...it's that good! Thank you Barrie! I'll never use another recipe!

This was a good recipe that turned out very moist. If I cook it again, I will marinate the chicken overnight for more flavor.  I baked the chicken in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  I used the bottom of a broiler pan which I sprayed with Pam and lined with foil for easier cleaning.  Be prepared for the smell as the drippings and butter burn on the pan as the chicken bakes.

Well,if you were a chicken that size sitting on a can of beer, you'd be falling over too! lol!  Try a 16 ounce can instead.  I have come across other recipes where this helped with that problem.  Also, for those worried about paint from can coming off onto the chicken cavity, cover can with foil:)

I was skeptical about this.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written except I used a poultry rub I had handy with the butter.  My chicken was a little bigger than the four pounds the submitter recommends – I would make sure you stick with one that’s four pounds or less or you might have trouble getting the lid on the grill!   Finally, be sure to check the temperature of the chicken often.  I was way short of the recommended cooking time and upon checking the temperature, found it registered anywhere between 180-200 degrees.  I thought it was overcooked and ruined.  That’s when this skeptic became a believer.  In spite of apparently being overcooked, it was tender, moist and extremely flavorful.  My only criticism is you would think the skin would become a golden brown.  It really doesn’t, which is likely a function of the beer steaming the meat.  I look forward to experimenting with this and perfecting it in the future.

Loved the flavour of this chicken and it was soooo moist.  I recommend buying the actual "beer butt" metal stand that you can get at kitchen stores though.  My chicken kept falling over on the pan and made quite a mess.  Hopefully the stand will prevent this from happening.

absolutely delicious!  You can get the beer holders @ walmart for $3.  I think I'm going to buy one b/c the can fell over near the end of cooking (and of course the chicken went w/ it).  Still turned out great.

DELICIOUS!! The meat falls off the bones and it is very moist.I would definetely recommend, however....the chicken is hot and the beer is boiling in the can when you remove the chicken from the grill.  It's a challenge to get the can out of the chicken, you'll need extra hands.

This is a fantastic recipe. We are on a low fat, low sodium diet, so instead of butter I used olive oil and instead of garlic salt i used garlic powder. I also closed the skin around neck and secured it with a tooth pick. This really intensified the flavor and moisture!!! Awesome no matter how you cook it!!!

Very tasty indeed. You may also cut off the top of the beer can and add in slices of onions and bell peppers for a savoring taste!!! For those of you that would not like to use beer, a can of sprite or 7up will work just the same. Enjoy!

We loved this chicken! I think you really can play with the spices you use. I used garlic, onion powder, cayenne, old bay seasoning, thyme, sage and I didn't use the whole cup of butter(1/2 cup) and it still came out Amazing! I really think it helped the flavor by rubbing the chicken with the spices and letting it marinade overnight. I rubbed the spices underneath the skin and on top of the skin. I cooked the chicken in the oven @ 350 for 1 1/2 hours and put some chicken broth, beer and water in the pan the chicken sat in. The drippings made a wonderful gravy! My husband woke up this morning thinking about the chicken we had for dinner the night before :)

This was a very moist tender chicken which I baked in the oven.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe.  Delicious.  The second time I made a rub of 1 teaspoon each garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and fresh ground black pepper.  I then added 1 heaping tablespoon each of finely minced fresh oregano and sage from my garden.  I loosened the skin and slathered the rub all over the meat of the chicken under the skin as well as the inside of the chicken.  I even made sure to get the rub down into the leg and thigh meat (under the skin).   Finally I oiled the outside of the chicken with olive oil and rubbed the last of the rub all over.  I added a few crushed garlic cloves to the beer and roasted it in the the oven at 350 degrees until the dark meat registered 180 degrees.  If you like a milder  tasting chicken the original recipe is marvelous.  If you like more flavor this rub adds outstanding taste.

I follow the premise of this recipe, but adjust the seasoning mixture to my taste (i.e. smoked paprika, garlic salt, chili powder etc.  I have my own seasoning mix I make that I use in my cooking) - make no mistake about it - cooking a chicken with this method produces and incredibly juicy, flavorful bird.  (don't be stingy with the seasining mixture) Don't forget to season the INSIDE of the bird.  I don't go to the trouble of loosening the skin to season between - I just season the inside and outside of the chicken and it's absolutely fantastic!  I periodically baste the chicken with the drippings and seasoned butter.  Folks...this melts in your mouth!!  Be sure not to under-cook...if you get impatient, you might end up with a chicken that isn't as tender.  I cook mine for at least 3 hours on indirect heat.  YUMMO!!

We have made this recipe a lot on the grill but the last time it scared me a little.  There is a great potential for fire so please be careful.  I guess some folks have a stand for the bird, but I was just using the can.  It tastes great but from now on I will have extra water on hand so the bird does not charr.  And I will make a mental note that I will smell like smoke for the rest of the evening.  Everyone looked it though!

chicken very juicy - used center burner after 30 minutes and turned other two off - temp a little above low - got cooked in about two to two and a half hours - also made potatoes in a packed on the other side.  flavor doesn't get all the way in but still very good.

Sensational!   Truly the juiciest chicken I have ever roasted.   I did mine in the oven for 1.5 hours at 350 as others suggested.   I followed others advice as well in putting some of the seasoned butter under the skin too.   Not sure if it's really the beer in the can or the 1 CUP of butter that makes this so yummy but WOW.

AWESOME! Followed recipe exactly except for the time... we did a 4 1/2 lb. chicken on the gas grill for about 2 hrs. and 20 min. Checked internal temp with a meat thermometer and it was PERFECT! Moist & flavorful on the inside; and much to my surprise, the skin crisped up very nicely. I will most definitely be making this again & again! Anxious to experiment with other ingredients such as Worcestershire, liquid smoke or hot sauce. Very tasty chicken indeed!

Have always cooked it in the oven. Make sure your chicken is defrosted. Takes at least 1.5 hours. Gotta use the butter in the recipe. I have made it and left it off and the rating drops down to 3 stars. Dont use light beer, no taste.

I could eat this everyday! It's THAT GOOD! I like the fact I can put it on the grill(or in the oven) in the afternoon while the kids are at school then it's ready just as the kids are finishing up their homework.

This was amazing!  I brought it to a friend's house for the 4th of July and it was eaten up even before ribs that someone else brought!  I rubbed some of the butter mixture all over the chicken & under the skin then let it sit overnight in the fridge.  I didn't want to use up all the propane on the grill so I cooked it in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes on 325 then I put it on the grill for another 15 minutes to crisp up the skin.  To serve it I cut it up & poured all the juices from the bottom of the roasting pan all over the chicken.  I will make this again.  My husband told me that he has been dreaming about this chicken since I made it!

A very interesting take on making chicken! I love the idea and love using beer in cooking. Standing the chicken, pulling out the can (butter the can!) was all easier than I thought. The chicken came out very tender but it was too bland for my tastes. I would say definitely make some adjustments to the spice blend and put some outside and inside - don't rely on the can to make the chicken tasty/salty.

I have been cooking beer butt chicken on my charcoal grill for years, though simplified.  I use a can rack, slide the chicken over the 1/2 full can of beer, rub the chicken with olive oil, then sprinkle with Emeril's Chicken Rub. The final touch is to place an onion (or apple) wedge in the neck hole to keep the steam from escaping from the cavity, resulting in a VERY moist chicken. The chicken is usually done in 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  This dish disappears like magic EVERY time!

This recipe has one major flaw in it.  In Wisconsin we NEVER DISCARD BEER!  You drink it! Hence only 4 stars.

The novelty of this makes it worth a try.  I used a 4-lb chicken and used a dry rub and let it set overnight.  I then cooked on the BBQ.  The chicken was extremely moist.  However, I felt it lacked in flavor.  Next time I would use much stronger seasonings.  Edit:  I just made this again.  This time I brined over night, using the Citrus Turkey Brine recipe on this site.  I used two 4-lb. chickens.  The following morning I drained and rinsed them, then used a spicy dry rub on them.  I let them sit in the fridge for 6 hours, then grilled them.  They were done in 2 hours.  The meat was SO unbelievably moist it was incredible.  I will definitely brine the chickens anytime I use this recipe in the future.

Probably the best beer butt chicken I've ever had.  Moist and juicy and soooo good!  I made two of them for a party and EVERYONE RAVED about them!! I cooked them for about an hour and forty five to fifty minutes.  I basted every thirty and I rubbed it with a stick of butter before putting on the seasonings.  I put a little chicken broth and some beer that wasn't being used at the bottom. It helps make a really good gravy too. :)  I love this recipe. :D

This is an awsome recipe!!! My kids love it and can't get enough. They like it better than the chicken my wife makes. My daughter makes it impossible to have leftovers the next day. She just keeps picking off the carcass in an endless eating frenzy!!! Thanks for submitting this winner Barrie!!!   New note on this recipe. Lately I have been adding the excess beer from the can to the butter mix for basting. It seems to add a bit more flavor.

My husband surprised me with this for dinner.  At first, I was a little leery - I prefer my chicken boneless and skinless - but after only one bite I was HOOKED!  He made this recipe his own by rubbing the bird inside and out with cajun seasoning.  Delicious!!  Fun presentation too.

What a delicious recipe!  My whole family loved it--it was so tender and moist.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours in a 350 degree oven, based on other poster's advice, and also added a little liquid smoke, also per another poster's advice.  Just amazing!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  There is no beer taste at all, just a slightly smoky, spicy, buttery sauce.

My husband told me to KEEP this one!  My almost 5 yr old daughter practically inhaled the skin.  A huge hit for the whole family, ages 1yr old to 35!!!!  I grilled it at a constant 250 degrees, basting every half hr. for 3 1/2 hrs.  Delicious.

After reading all of the reviews I was excited - I made it and the smell was wonderful (it took much longer to cook then I expected) we sat down to eat it & we were very disappointed, it had no flavor at all?

This recipe is so much fun and easy to make.  When completed I pull the meat off of the bone, place in a turkey bag, pour juices left in beer can over the top, and place in the oven at 180 degrees.  This gives me time to finish up last minute things for the dinner and also adds great flavor and juice to the meat.  I will never look for another beer butt chicken recipe.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone that I share this recipe with gets such a kick from it.  I will never look at a chicken the same way again.  This is the best tasting chicken we have ever had.  I find that it takes much less time to cook on my grill (about an hour and a half).  I always use a chicken with a pop-up timer so that I know exactly when it is done.   When cooked at a higher heat it does just fine. It smells great.. looks great.. and best of all taste awesome !!!

This was sooooo moist and delish! I did soak the bird in beer and onion and garlic all day. Then stuck it up there on that beer can to cook in the stove @ 350. Basted it once with a mixture of melted butter and honey mustard. Juice was dripping from the breast meat! Keeper!!!

Beer butt chicken is hard to mess up!  I changed a few things about this recipe--couldn't imagine using a cup of butter so I rubbed with olive oil instead.  I also seasoned with my favorite roasted chicken seasonings--garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, salt, paprika (for color), and thyme.  I used a larger beer and recommend buying a beer you actually like as opposed to whatever single can you can find.  You may use something that you don't like the taste of, which kinda ruins the dish.  I use grass fed chickens and they never take 3 hours.  For even more juiceness,  consider brining before putting on the grill.  Like I said, this is hard to mess up and truly a treat!

I have made alot of beer butt chicken and this recipe is the bomb! I used garlic powder and seasoning salt in the melted butter and slathered that all over the bird. I also put some smashed garlic in the beer and cooked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes per pound. Excellent flavor and fall off the bone delicious. Also very easy. I highly recommend this recipe!

delicious.  I tried with Dijon, honey and butter on the skin and some peppercorns, butter, rosemary, fresh crushed garlic with the beer.  I think I could have done without any butter.  I also cooked in the oven at 350 for 1:15 (15 minutes per lb)

Try a bit of bourbon in the can as well. Baste the chicken in a mix of half apple cider vinegar/bourbon with a dash of lemon pepper. It makes the skin brown great. Also rub the inside cavity of the chicken with garlic powder and basil.

I first did this for a "beer" theme dinner. Later on I made 4 at once for 15 people for ski weekend. You really can't mess this up! Only thing i suggest is don't go easy on the spices, the more the better! Try to get them under the skin, and boil down the juices at the end to make a sauce.

Made this for the 3rd time, it still is the best way to grill chicken ( I think!). Ive used beer, and a can of coke for a sweeter taste. Different rubs make different chicken, all good! Soak the chicken overnight in brine or buttermilk, add some spices( I used bay and rosemary) Oh my god....heaven! My friends here in Holland have never seen it before,and were shocked how good it was! Import to grill the chicken on one side of the grill with no heat under it, and on the other side a pan with water, this keeps your chicken very moist, and cooks your chicken without over-cooking it! Add some water soaked wood chips wrapped in foil with holes next to the pan with water and you get a nice smokey taste.

I think the results are perfectly edible, and even tasty. I am not convinced that this method is an improvement upon any other methods I already know. I would back a traditionally roasted chicken against this any day.

Very Good. I cooked in the oven (350) for about 2 hours. I also stuffed the neck with foil and sprayed the can with non-stick spray. I will definitely make again and will try with different spices as well. Thanks

Great way to make chicken! Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside! I used olive oil and my own mix of spices. But the idea is the same. I have a Weber gas grill and cooked a 4 ½ lb. bird over indirect medium heat for an hour and a half. Temperature at the thigh was over 180, and it was definitely done. With the chicken cooking upright like this, all the meat is able to be used. It just pulls off of the bone. They sell beer can holders at Lowe’s for $4. It makes it so the chicken won’t fall over while cooking. I didn’t use a drip pan either, since I was cooking over indirect heat. One last suggestion, use Icehouse 16 oz. cans. It is cheap beer that actually tastes like beer. (Not good beer, but beer) and the tall cans work better to hold the bird upright.

Although I have made this type of chicken for several years, I had never considered adding butter and seasonings to the beer can. The results, tender, moist, flavorful chicken.  This recipe is open to quite a few different variations from the beverage to the seasonings. Thanks for the awesome recipe, Barrie!

I was so excited to make this recipe. I cook whole chickens in the oven all the time but had never tried the beer can. I tried it with the rack and was so VERY disappointed in the lack of flavor. I will try again and make using the can only put Rosemary under the skin. Stuff the chicken with fresh rosemary, lemon slices and sliced onion. I do this on a broiler pan in the oven and it is the best chicken ever. Use the beer can but spray the outside of the chicken with cooking spray and season with seasoning salt and dried rosemary. Stuff as I indicated before. Will get 10 times the flavor and is always a crowd pleaser. I have made this dish over 100 times and everyone has raved over it.

I've used this method for years but I keep it simple.  #1 Do NOT "discard" half a can of beer!!! After drinking half a can I simple mix BBQ sauce in the remaining half and grill it.

I have made Beer Butt Chicken so many times...and each time a little differently.  One of the improvements is to pour the remaining beer (or a new one if you drink the balance) into a roasting pan in which the chicken(s) will sit while cooking.  Add the juice of two lemons, two limes, and a 1/4 cup of sea salt.  As the chickens cook, the aromatic vapors from the mixture 'self-baste' the chicken.  Also, try one of the Budweiser Clamato beers, it makes for an interesting variation.

My family loves this  using the method of baking in the oven at 350.  I have found one little trick which makes it even easier.  Open the can of beer with a can opener.  Pour out half of the beer.  Put in the stick of butter unmelted and paprika and garlic salt.  Much easier than trying to pour melted butter, paprika and garlic salt into the small opening at the top of the can.

This was one some of the best chicken we've ever made. We used a lager for the type of beer and basted it with seasoned butter every 15 minutes or so during cooking.  It was so tender and juicy.  We bought the stand to hold the beer can which we would highly recommend - they're cheap and can be found at Wal-Mart. We will definitely be making this again!

Love it.  It's a most-requested dish.  I brine the chicken first and then bake it in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours and let it sit on the counter for about 15 minutes before cutting into it.

I love this !! It helps to marinate the outside first as it makes the chicken tastier, just with barbeque sauce, ranch dressing, etc. Also, you don't need to use beer for the main base; it's just for moisture. Cola and orange juice work just as well from experience, even though beer tastes the best.

Ohhh my gosh!  This is some incredible chicken!! The only thing we changed is we rubbed our chicken with a "chicken rub" seasoning the night before, put it in a gallon size bag, and put it in the fridge. WOW!! The most tender, moist chicken ever!

This recipe was so much fun to make, and the result was wonderful!  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  I baked the chicken in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Make sure you line your baking pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is delicious.  Hubby got a new grill for his birthday and wanted to try it out.  This was perfect for our first meal.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Thanks for the post.

Used soda instead of beer and corked the top of the chicken with an onion.  Very moist chicken.

This is what my friend said about this chicken (made verbatim):  "I should kill you for making skin this good!".  I guess that says it all, but this will help, if you're still not convinced...I made 2 birds for a BBQ and before I finished putting the rest of the buffet out, they were gone!  I guess that means these'll do for appetizers as well :)  Thanks so much!!!!!!

I was a little scared because I had to cook this in the oven.  However, it was fine.  350* for 1.5-2 hours until the thigh measured 180* and it was terrific!!  Also I thought the paprika would be all you could taste, but that was not the case.  I used a thing from Walmart clled Beer Butt Chicken and it could not have been easier, just don't try to melt all the butter and add half of it to the can!  Oops, red, greasy beer explosion! Very important to add cold butter to beer.  No one could believe how moist it all was! I am ooking forward to trying this on the grill as well (hubby's turn to cook)

Excellent recipe!  If you're using a charcoal grill, make sure you cover it.  Maybe I'm an idiot when it comes to grilling, but I didn't know by the instructions whether or not to cover the grill for 3 hours.  You should.  The result is great!

We had this for dinner last night and it was fantastic!!!  Boston Market has nothing on this chicken, very similar taste at a fraction of the cost and with very little labor.  I too cooked a 4lb chicken in the oven on 350 for two hours and it came out perfect.

This is the only way we will cook chicken ever again!!!  It was unbelievably moist and tender!
I did not use cheap beer(if that makes a difference or not)and on the gas grill it only took 1-1/2 hours! Thanks! Gina

Great recipe!!!  I actually made this with Mountain Dew instead of Beer and it turned out YUMMY!  I also made it in the oven at 350 degrees.  I love this recipe because the entire skin gets nice and crispy.  Don't forget to season the bird!  Happy cooking and thanks for the great idea!

Love chicken done this way, I call it Beer Butt chicken.  I've not tried it with butter, but will.  I rub it with a bit of oil, then use Keg Steak spice under the skin on the breast and thigh area and a bit shaken on the skin. So moist and good with nice crispy skin when it's done.  Thanks for sharing, can't wait to try it this way.

Loved this chicken. Moist, flavorful, EASY! I used only half the called for butter. You should be aware that when adding the melted butter and spices to the can, the beer tends to foam out of the can.

To keep flare-ups down, reduce the amount of time I had to spend watching the chicken so it didn't catch fire from the flare-ups and to ease grill clean-up, I put a piece of heavy duty foil under the can holder I have. Worked perfectly. Chicken skin crisped nicely, while remaining uncharred.

Great flavor and very moist!  I didn't have a disposable baking sheet, so I placed a layer of foil on the half of the grill under the chicken and it worked fairly well (sticked a little).

This has been one of my favorites for a long time. I have done this one the grill and it comes out great. Walmart sells chicken stands that hold the beer can and makes it much more stable. I take an onion and push it as far into the neck cavity as I can to seal off the top. This allows the beer to steam the chicken from the inside out. I also have a solution for the height of the Weber Kettle...see pics . Place the coals around the outside edges of the grill and place a drip pan in the center. Keep water in the drip pan to prevent grease from causing flare ups. Best chicken ever...

This is was prettty good! I followed the ingredients to a tee...However cooked mine in the oven instead. Word of caution...if you put hot butter in a cold beer can be ready for some fizz! I should have read more reviews on that part! Otherwise, the chicken was very tasty and juicy!

I have been making this recipe at least once a week for the last month and I am rating it 5*s because I love the idea and I use the ingredients and directions as stated. I cook on our outdoor grill at 350 for an hour and a half for a five pound bird. One thing that I added last time is mix about a cup of beer half a cup butter and a packet of ranch seasoning and melted it all together and injected it the bird. I turned out really good but next time I may try a brine...

Very moist and yummy. My little chicken sat up perfectly on its beer can roost! I sat it in a 9x13 pan covered with foil and baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. Other than that I didn't change anything.

I have a new name for this recipe.......OMG Chicken! Because that was the first word out of everyone's mouth who tasted it! The butter/spice infusion made the chickens skin so crispy and beautiful golden brownish red, Looked like a real rotisserie chicken, but even better! I would love to do a small turkey this way for Thanksgiving, I used a 24 oz beer can w awesome results! Thank you so much Barrie

This chicken is absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was to put an onion or potato in the neck of the chicken to hold in some moisture. Another delicious addition to the chicken is to cook it in a foil roasting pan, cut up potatoes and onions and place around the chicken and let them cook in the juices that run off the chicken. Stir occasionally. Add a little butter salt and pepper to the potatoes and onions and....man oh man.....delicious!!!! We cooked it on a gas grill over indirect heat. Having it again this weekend and can't wait!!

First time I've tried this method of cooking chicken.  I really liked the moistness of the chicken - very very tender.  It was even moist and tender the next day for leftover chicken salad.  Next time I will experiment with the seasonings though because although the chicken had a beautiful color, it was a little bland for my taste.  Usually when I roast a chicken I make an herb butter and rub under the skin.  I will probably do this next time.  Definitely will be making this again.

This recipe is good, but I found it slightly lacking in flavor.  The breast in particular was a bit bland, although it was quite moist.  I prepared the recipe almost exactly as written, with a few exceptions.  First, I cooked it in the oven instead of the grill.  I roasted it at 350 for an hour and 20 minutes; it registered 170 on the instead-read thermometer.  Also, I used Spanish Smoked Paprika instead of regular because I enjoy its smokey flavor.  Like most posters, I sprayed the can with non-stick cooking oil for easy removal.  I would make this again, but I would make a few modifications.  First, I would drastically cut down on the amount of butter.  The recipe calls for a full two sticks, but I found that I only used about half that to baste the entire chicken.  Next time I'll just melt down a single stick, baste the chicken, and then use the remainder for the beer can.  Like some posters have already suggested, I would try and get the spices really rubbed under the breast skin prior to basting in an effort to increase the amount of flavor.  I would also add some other seasonings and herbs, such as cayenne pepper and rosemary, for a little extra flavor.

This was very juicy- I made two chickens; one as posted and one lemon pepper- the lemon pepper was the Family favorite.  I placed a garlic clove in the beer with a splash of olive oil.  Put half and onion and two cloves of garlic in the cavity.  Mixed about 1/4 cup of olive oil and 3 tbls of lemon pepper seasoning in a bowl; let it sit for about 10 minutes and rubbed on the chicken.  Both were very good- my guys liked the lemon pepper version better.  Both are worth trying. Oh, if you use a pan to catch the drippings make it a high sided one- my cookie sheet made a big mess when I took it off the grill.  Low heat on the sides;  no heat where the cookie sheet was- 3 hours.  YUM

This recipe was incredibly simple yet very very tasty and wonderfully juicy.  A gas grill is much easier to control the temp and roasting times.  I turned one burner on low heat and put the chicken on the opposite side of the grill.  I just kept an eye on the grill temp to keep it around 275-300 degrees.  This is definitely a must-try recipe!

I made this and following other reviewers advice I seasoned it under and on the skin. It was the same as my normal roasted chicken. I don't think that it was worth the extra effort; however; I did it in the oven and I may try it on the grill this summer.

This was good, but kinda bland. Next time I will add a rub under the skin, and put either an apple or onion in the top, I used a foil ball this time and the chicken needed more flavor. I did use a stand and it turned out moist and good. I cooked a 5+ lb. bird at around 350 on the grill using the indrict method, and masquite chips for 2 hrs. I will make this again.

I roasted this in the oven, and it was very good and the chicken was moist and juicy. However, I don't think the beer added much, since it turned out very similar to my regular roasted chicken recipe that doesn't use beer. I only had a 24-oz. can of beer, but per the recommendations of some folks on the recipe exchange, just added the required beer amount to an empty soda can. Although the meat itself was not as flavorful as I would have guessed, this was a well liked chicken, and I will probably make this again.

Very good, very creative! I added thyme to the butter mixture, which tasted great with this. I mixed up another 1/2 cup of butter (yeah, this was NOT a lowfat dinner!) with some garlic powder in it and basted the chicken every 1/2 hour or so. I used a 4 lb chicken and it was done in just over 2 hours. Next time I might just rub the chicken down with olive oil and spices... might as well at least attempt to cut the calories down! :) Very tasty, thank you!

I know additional reviews aren't necessary, but I just tried this on the grill last night and it was AWESOME.  Took various review suggestions --- 1/2 c. butter with garlic powder & Cajun seasonings; sprayed outside & sprinkled with garlic powder and Cajun seasonings; stuffed neck with 1/2 lime.  WONDERFULLY CRISP and MOIST.  Took 1-1/2 hrs on lowest grill setting.  THANKS BARRIE!

I've used this method for quite a while and is always a hit!  The only changes I make is to rub w/olive oil then with a mix of onion & garlic powder, salt, pepper & paprika.  Then in 1/2 can of beer I add fresh parsley, oregano, thyme,etc. and set it directly on the grate.  Good stuff!!

WOW!!! It is recipes like this, that makes everyone think I can cook. I used Miller lite beer and I cooked (2) 4lbs whole chickens at the same time on my gas grill. I did not double the ingredients. I cooked it for about 1 and 1/2 hours. It so good. It is NOT time consuming at all. I put it on my gas grill and closed the lid and checked on it every 30 minutes. If you are new to cooking, trust me, you can not mess this up. If you do mess this up, then you may need to stick with take out!! Happy Eating, MMMMM.

This is a GREAT recipe, and I think it was the most fun I have had cooking dinner in a LONG time.  I did chop up 2 cloves of garlic and stuff that under the skin and it turned out fantastic. I put it in the oven at 360 for exactly 2 hours for a 5 lb. bird.  Beautiful.  Oh, and I used one of those racks from the store that holds the beer can.  My mom uses root beer and loves it, and I will try that next. You must try this!

Excellent. Any recipe that starts with me drinking half a can of beer has my vote! Plus, the meat was falling off the bone and the chicken had great coloring due to the paprika.

I only write ratings for 5+ star recipes. This is the WAY chicken should taste, and the only WAY it should be cooked. The very best, moist and flavorful chicken I have ever tasted. I did have to adapt alot, as I did not have everything on hand. I did'nt have beer on hand, and I knew I was going to have peas with dinner, so I emptied the can into a pan and rinsed out the can. I filled it with sprite and some sliced onions, rosemary, garlic powder and thyme. Then put that in the chicken, which solved the delicate "tip-over" problem because of the bigger can. I rubbed the outside with paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Put it in the oven about 1.5 to 2 hours. YUM. Moist, tender chicken. Crispy, tasty skin. You have to try this one. Experiment and have so much fun with it. Easy and well worth it. Thanks so much

I gave this 5 stars because it gave us a great starting place for our own version.  Like other reviewers, we used the oven instead of the grill. However, at my father's paranoid insistance, we wrapped the beer cans in tinfoil. We rubbed the outside with "montreal chicken seasoning" and put butter, FRESH chopped garlic, rosemary and paprika. The chicken was moist and delicious!  I highly recommend this cooking method!

I followed TNT1's advice and seasoned it with a dry rub. It was fantastic. My children were talking about it for days. I used some of the the left over butter mixture to brush on the chicken as it cooked. The drippings made an excellent sauce for dipping!

I cooked this on my electric smoker and it took quite a while longer - I let it smoke for 7 hours!!  Even after all that time, it was still very moist and flavorful.  I will try this again, except next time, I will use the grill!  I also rubbed the dry spices into the skin and injected it with the melted butter and spice mixture and let it marinate overnight.  We liked it!!

My family loved this. Followed recipe and found it very easy. Chicken is so moist. I had a 5 lb. one and it was done in 2 hours in the oven. Will make again for sure. Can't wait to use the grill when the snow melts and we can find it! Thanks Barrie

Awesome chicken! My husband loved it and wants to make this all the time now. Sounds silly and looks funny sitting on the can, but this recipe is truly worthy of a try!

Great!  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  It was a bit messy and awkward to handle the 6 pound roasters I used when taking the beer can out before serving.  I will offer this tip...take care to wash the beer can before opening and inserting into the cavity.  You never know where that can has been...lol.

The chicken breast was the moistest every - just like a steamed chicken but better!  
I've made it two times now.  The second time I anded more salt and pepper in the can and for basting.  I also used margarine instead of butter.  The additional salt and pepper helped with the flavoring.  

I still didn't get a crispy skin though.  Next time I may cook it uncovered for most of the time and see if that makes a difference.  I may also just use a premixed spice like McCormick's Roasted Garlic Seasoning for the skin.

All I can say is, "WOW!"  What a tender, moist chicken!  I don't want to think about the fat with all of that butter, but I am sure that can be adjusted.  I used different spices and baked it in the oven for about 2 hours (at 350), as it is 20 degrees outside, and found it to be very moist and delicious!  Great meal and provides leftovers for other meals!

Perfection! This is a great way to grill a chicken. I add honey for sweetness. And the kind of beer is not really important unless you want a deep stout flavor.

I had to laugh when I was reading the instructions. Discard half the beer? Thats a sin in my house. (Down the hatchmayb , but dont discard!) ;) Otherwise,  this is a great recipe.  The recommendation of other to spray the beer can beforehand helped a lot. Thanks for a great recipe.

Works perfectly every time.  My kids love it!  I make it weekly.  Thursday night is Beer Butt Chicken.  I use Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of just plain old salt and pepper.  I sprinkle it on the inside of the cavity as well as the outside.  You can't beat this recipe for roasted chicken.

I haven't tried this as yet, but one thing, DO NOT DISCARD the beer. Drink it. No sense in wasting beer.. . . It looks very good and I will have to get a chicken, already have the beer. . . .Ha      Howard

The beer mostly adds moisture. If your bird was dry you cooked it too long. Not enough flavor add your favorite seasonings, inside, outside, and under the skin. Best way to cook a bird!!

This is a fab method for roasted chicken. I upped the seasoning big time and stuffed the neck of the bird with a head of garlic. Two hours was just perfect on an indirect grill heat. Forgot to grease the beer can, but it still slid out easily with the help of some tongs. Very yummy and now a regular on our table :)

This came out awesome.  The meat was very tender and moist.  I cooked it in the oven; it was hard to get it to stand and it actually tipped over at one point.  Fortunately, it was in a pan so there wan't a huge mess.  Also, I was using a frozen roaster chicken.  I let it thaw in the fridge for 3 days and it was still partially frozen, so give it longer.

WONDERFUL flavor!!  I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour and 45 minutes (it was a 5 lb roaster).  The instant I cut it, I could tell it was extremely moist!  I'll definitely be making this again soon!  Thank you!

This meal is delicious!  Based on other reviews, I let the chicken sit overnight with half of the ingredients spread over and under the skin.  I added some Montreal Chicken seasoning and old bay.  I cooked the chicken at 350 for about 1hr 45 min (I  cooked 2 simultaneously and wasn't sure about the time).  The chicken came out moist and delicious.

The chicken ended up very moist, but could have used more flavor. Cooked a 5lb chicken in the oven at 350 for 2 hrs. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and basted it a few times while cooking. Not bad for my first try, I will definitely attempt this again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except i put some of the butter mixture under the skin as well.  It was very juicy but waaaayyyyy too salty.  I made gravy from the drippings and had to throw it out.  I will try it again but with garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Fun to do and kids got a kick at seeing the bird inside the OVEN. Used a 16 oz. can but only kept half of the beer inside; punctured the skin in several places to drain fat while baking; added water when needed to the pan to prevent scorching the drippings; basted after an hour of cooking at 325F with a maple glaze for color and turned up the heat to 500F for the last 20 min. or so to crisp the skin. So juicy and delicious. Don´t forget to make gravy from the drippings and leftover glaze.

This was the best grilled chicken I've ever had!  It was so easy.  I made two chickens and had plenty of leftovers.  My neighbor, who is a chef, really enjoyed it and plans to make it for her husband.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I will definetly add this recipe to my list.

My husband, who is a true blue red meat man, says that chicken this good should be illegal!  All I did last night was add some Montreal Seasoning to the butter. I have used beer, ginger ale and regular cola and it didn't make a difference - it's the moisture that counts. A very versatile recipe that turns out a chicken to die for!

You have to make it on the grill with a can in the butt pour beer on it and in can otherwise it will not have much flavor, I have made this before, it was great.

I just made this tonight on my grill and it was pretty good. I cooked it on Low (300) for 2.5 hrs. I didnt use butter to lower the fat content and subed olive oil. I mixed 1 tbsp of garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and 1 tsp salt. Rubbed it under the skin of the chicken (realized tonight to focus on the under side of the chicken where all the meat is..) this was noticed with a lack of flavor. I then rubbed 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 tbsp lemon pepper over the chicken and let it rest in the fridge for a few hours. Then added the spices to 1/2 the can of beer and roastd. Overall taste was moist and delish, but could use a little more seasonings. So DONT be afraid to season the heck outt of your bird.....!!

So delicious and so moist!  I baked at 380 (that is my oven's temp for 350) for about an 1 hour and 20 minutes and it was PERFECT!  I lifted the skin off the chicken with the end of a butter knife and put soft butter and herbs between the skin and meat and then rubbed it all on the outside of the skin.  It truly couldn't have been better!

I tried this on the weekend for the first time and we and our company LOVED it, better than the roasted-nicely browned chickens I had in the oven. The only change I made was that I only used 1/2 cup butter in total and 2 fresh garlic cloves in each of the places called for. YUMMY is all I can say! It smelled soooo good every time I went out to the bbq! Thanks for a very delish recipe, I'll be making this again and again.

Finally decided to try this! Glad I did! I melted the butter in the microwave and used 2 Tbsp Montreal Seasoning Roasted Garlic Chicken Seasoning, 3 Tbsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. I also baked mine in the oven for 1 1/2 hr at 350, placing it in a shallow broiler pan minus the broiler rack. I had no problem with it standing and did not use a special store-bought stand. I came out perfect and flavorful. The one down-side, I wish it had more skin because that was the bomb!

Super moist and tasty chicken! We made the mistake of forgetting to use a pan to catch the drippings and lets just say that we almost burnt the house down...We ended up transferring the chicken in the oven at 400 degrees and cooking it for an hour. It was the most moist chicken we ever had. For those that do not like beer and are afraid the chicken will taste only like beer, it just had the scent of beer but did not taste like it at all. We seasoned the chicken in and out with a package of prepared Lawry's chicken taco seasoning. We served it with a side of bbq'd caesar salad and bread and it was great.

I've been making this for years...to change it up pour out most of a can of sprite, add white wine to make a half can and season to taste.  Lemon/pepper, a thyme rub or rosemary/garlic are all great with the wine

Have been making this for years...one big tip, fill the neck cavity with something savory, a half lemon, lime, onion, whatever you have on hand.  Without doing this, I ended up with dry chicken, all the savory goodness and flavor went out the top.  I put some chopped onion, garlic and herbs (fresh in summer, dried in winter) in the can with the beer.  Also, I have never used butter, just rubbed the skin with a dry rub, seasoned salt or something similar.  We love this!!!

Tried for the first time today for Father's day and the hubby loved it as well as the kids!  Followed recommendation of others and added rosemary to the beer and montreal chicken seasoning to the butter, otherwise followed as written.  It took a little less than two hours on our grill.  I served it with Foil Wrapped Veggies from this site.  Great complimentary flavors!!

LOVE this CHICKEN!! These are the variations I have tried with Great Success. Give 1/2 of beer to husband, followed by more! Add 1 T Rosemary to the beer can, instead of butter rub the entire bird with olive oil.  Use white wine in the can instead.  Take a whole head of garlic, separate and peel the cloves, make slits in the skin and place underneath, fill the top cavity with the leftover cloves. Serve with grill roasted vegetables or potatoes and a green salad.

This turned out great! I made this for the first time and I was amazed! The white meat was never juicier! I made my own dry rub using season salt,white pepper,cummin and because I like a bit of heat I also added some cajun pepper. I would like to suggest buying a chicken stand. I went to our local Walmart and bought one for five bucks, not a bad investment for making your life a little bit easier!

My son makes this quite often.  I  don't like beer but I love the chicken cooked this way. He pushes a whole head of garlic in the top and it roasts while it is grilling. I've never made it myself but am very happy whenever he invites me for dinner.

It's hot down South; so cooking outside is good for me and my A/C bill. This chicken was hands down the best I have ever cooked. Like everyone else, I spice according to my taste. I used a dry rub under the skin with 1 tsp sage, 1/2tsp each of garlic salt, black pepper, paprika. I also put rub on the outside dry, then (on the outside) I added about 3T butter (olive oil next time) to the rub for basting. Beautiful brown. Apple slice in the neck and inside the cavity with the can. Apples in the dripping pan with a splash of beer to get the liquid started. After that drippings do the work. Basted every 30 min. Cooked @ 300deg on indirect heat grill for 2 hours for 4# chicken. Kids almost ate the bones. Using bones to make broth for Chicken and dumplings. Mmmmmm.

I thought this was ok. Not nearly as good as the Cajun roasted chicken on this site. I think making the chicken in a roaster in the oven is much, much better. Comes out more tender. Also I only had to cook for 2 hours. Three hours would of been way too long.

Such a great way to make a moist chicken. Slight modifications, used 1/2 the butter and added olive oil. Added a bit more crushed garlic and some rosemary.
Next time I think I would marinate overnight with a bit of a spice rub. 1 Chicken took about 1 1/2 hour on the propane bbq. I used a glass baking dish, with foil under to collect drippings, which I then used for a gravy.

Don't know what this does on the Grill, but in the Oven it was Fantastic! Be liberal with seasoning mix,  350 for 90 minutes in dutch oven or roaster!  AWesome!.  Pair with Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings, It's a can't miss dinner!

Chicken just doesn't get any better than this. I purchased a chicken stand for this recipe and it really does make it easier and much more stable. Added all different types of seasonings and gave the bird an evoo massage. Delicious, moist and very flavorful. Thanks Barrie!

The only adjustment I made was to use a 14 oz can of chicken broth instead of beer.  The end result was increadibly moist and delicious chicken!

I mixed 3 Tblsp McCormick Ckicken seasoning,  1/2 tsp Accent, 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to taste. Also, I used a 7lb roaster so I used an extra stick of butter.

What a fun recipe. I am an amature griller & found this to be not as scary as I thought it would be. This kind of cooking is out of my comfort zone but now I feel confident in my grilling abilities. I used 2 chickens but forgot to double the other ingredients but it still worked out great. Chick. was done in 2 hrs, almost overdone. One chicken was dry, the other semi-moist. I will decrease cooking time next time. I also tucked a little onion in the end of the chick. to keep the steam in. I used a charcoal Weber & the lid would not fit on tightly until the chick. shrunk a little(lid was resting on chick.) Will for sure make again & again!!

Beer Butt Chicken is one of my favorite foods ever. I have made it before with family members who introduced me to this wonderful way of making chicken. This recipe is the closest to the way I have made it before. I add BBQ sauce to the beer though, gives it more flavor. I also add a squirt of lime juice and some cayenne pepper for added flavor. Yummy!

This chicken is awesome! I had planned on doing it in the oven, but it was in the 90's here today so off to the grill! Exellent results! We will definately be making this again. I think I had heard talk on the exchange that you could sub soda for the beer, and I think I may try that next time! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

Very good, Target has a chicken stand for the oven or grill.  It was fun to prep and tasted great.

This is always good and very versital. We use fruit juice instead of beer. I add garlic and onion to the can. My husband is actually the one who cooks the chicken and as he is grilling it he sprays it every 15 mins or so with a mixture of vinegar and water. This keeps the chicken moist and makes it golden brown.

Amazing chicken!! First, I didn't have any beer racks to hold the chickens upright and I didn't use the grill. I used two chickens. Added melted butter (to warm beer) plus paprika and garlic in the beer. I did not measure, but just went by eye. I then used salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika on the chicken and poured more melted butter over the chicken. I put the chickens over the cans (on a foiled, baking dish). Remember to use cooking spray on the beer cans for an easy removal. The chickens leaned against each other and never fell. I basted with melted butter one more time during baking. My chickens took 2 hours at 350 degrees. I used the drippings for gravy. Great chicken recipe. The chicken fell off the bone and the cans came out very easily. We will certainly make this again, and we'll try them on the grill but out of the oven, they were wonderful!

This is great way to make chicken.  You really don't even need the butter.  Just season the chicken (lots), put some chopped garlic in the beer.  Bake @ 350 for 1.45.  I haven't even tried it on the grill yet.  But I will.

I used a dry rub from this site, All-Purpose Rub for Meat, and allowed the birds to sit for 30min. Then I put my BBQ on low, sat them on the beer cans and let them cook for 1hr and a bit. So moist and delicious. Went over well with everyone.

Excellent....makes one of the juiciest birds I have ever eaten.  We did use olive oil on the outside but did follow the recipe beyond that....just didn't have enough butter for the whole thing!  Delicious, thanks!

This was great. Totally weirded us out at first, but ended up being very tasty. We started off in the grill but it kept on starting on fire! So we moved it over into the oven, baked for another hour, and it was perfect. Thanks!

Now I didn't change a thing and I loved this recipe. It can be a bit tricky to get off the can without spilling everything all over so I'll use the idea to spray the can with non-stick spray before cooking. However, the flavor and moistness of this chicken is unsurpassed and I've tried SO many recipes hoping to get THIS result. It really is DELICIOUS!!!

Nothing special. I noticed that many of the five star reviews include "added grill seasoning, added this or that", which to me would make it hard to rate the recipe itself. Anyway. I like the beer can idea, but my chicken kept falling over. I would buy the stand and also consider many other seasonings if I were to try this again.

Such a great way manage a cookout party so that you are not a slave to the grill during the party.  I used two 4lb chicks cooked side by side, no baking sheet needed they were pretty stable. They cooked to amazing juicy roasted perfection in only 90 minutes. Next time I will put the rub under and over the skin. Make sure your propane tank is full!

I’ve made this chicken quite a few times over the summer and we love it.  I have tried several seasoning on it like poultry seasoning, sage, savory, paprika but our favorite is BBQ chicken seasoning. I always put an onion in the cavity of chicken and lots of chopped garlic in the beer can.

I usually take half the beer and pour it in a glass to drink while cooking and add about a teaspoon or two of liquid smoke. This give a different taste all together. Enjoy and remember don't think about drinking the beer that was used to flavor the chicken!!!

This was fantastic and simple!  The chicken was so moist!  I made this for a dozen people, and everyone raved.  Instead of the spices listed, I used spanish paprika and Paula Deen's house seasoning.  YUM!  It smelled almost as good as it tasted.  I also used less butter than it called for.  This was a good choice as there were flames at the beginning due to all the oil.  Just put down some foil, and the flames under control.

This is a classic recipe but, just a note to all you cooks out there. There are a lot of people that use "garlic salt" as opposed to "granulated garlic". For those that are watching their sodium intake, using garlic salt and salt too, is just kicking up that sodium content redundantly. Better to use granulated garlic/garlic powder then add salt to taste as needed.

Awesome.  I used about a 6 pound chicken and cooked it on a charcoal grill.  It took a little less than two hours to cook.  It was perfectly tender - enough that it was a snap to carve but not so much so that it fell apart. 

I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I used a commercial rottissere rub.  I did not use oil or butter nor did I add any additional spice to the beer.  I will add spice to the beer next time (I was just in a hurry and didn't read the recipe carefully enough).

Keep in mind that it is the method of cooking that makes this recipe so good.  So don't be afraid to play around with the spices.  What a great, no fuss, recipe.  There is definately no better way to make use of a whole chicken.  I can't wait until summer as these will make the perfect cookout fare!

Have several really good beer butt chic recipes but none are as easy and great as this one. Skin is crispy and 1 1/2 hours on the grill is all thats needed.

Thank you Barrie, for a wonderful recipe. I've been wanting to try this for over a year, and I'm glad I finally did! It only needed to cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and it was delicious....truly wonderful! Changes...I used a package of italian garlic poultry seasoning instead of salk and paprika and garlic salt. I also dusted the whole chicken with it. I served it with pesto Quinoa and a tomato salad. YUM!!

The chicken was very moist but in the final analysis, still tasted like chiken. I might try it again utilizing more spices and herbs.

Wow! What a fun recipe! This did beautifully. I made this exactly to recipe ; the only thing I did differently is double the recipe and my chickens weighed 4.91 lbs. each. I definitely recommend a meat thermometer. Fyi - our 2 chicks were done on a gas grill on medium (350) in 3 hours 45 minutes. I purchased a beer butt chicken holder at Wal Mart for each and those really helped with this! Definitely line your cookie sheet with foil if you aren't using a disposable tray. The chicken was very moist and the skin was absolutely delicious! Thank you for posting such a fun recipe!

This is the best chicken I have ever had!  I did cook mine in the oven, in my pie plate, @ 350 for an hour and a half.  My boyfriend would have eaten the whole chicken if he could have.  We loved it, and will be making this on a regular basis.

I have been making this for quite some time and I find the butter to be unnecessary.  I use homemade rib rub (Texas pork rib rub from this site is my favorite) or Big Bubba's Rubba chipotle rub.  I coat the outside of the chicken and throw some in the cavity.  I usually refrigerate it for a few hours, but that is not necessary.  Then I put the chicken on the can and put the chicken directly on the grill, using the indirect heat method.  A 3-pound chicken takes about an hour and 15 minutes, but I find that you really have to use a meat thermometer, as grill temps can vary so widely.

Excellent. I followed the recipe except I roasted in my convection oven for 30 at 450 degrees and 1 hour at 400. Delicious. Made only half the basting marinade and it was sufficient for one chicken. Will definitely make again.

Perfect, delicious, and easy!  I bought a can/chicken holder at Wal-mart for about 3 dollars and didn't have topple problems.  I found it near the cold beer displays...

Another 5 star!!!  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  I did set up my baking sheet and beer can on the grill before I added the butter/spices to the beer in case it was a mess...it wasn't, but then it was really easy to just carry the chicken to the grill and plop it on the can.  My chicken was very coordinated and had no trouble balancing in a tripod stand on the baking sheet.  I would recommend turning your chicken 180 degrees, half way through the cooking process, if you are using a gas grill and have a left/right burner set up.  One side of my chicken was definitely more done than the other.  No trouble removing from the can either...I just carved the thighs/legs and wings off, then grabbed the chicken and inverted it over the sink to dump out what was left in the can...then easily pulled it out and threw it away.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I have made this twice and it is the most delicious, flavorful chicken I've ever tasted. I cooked it in the oven though - it's too cold for grilling. It is hard to get the piping hot can out of the chicken when it's done. If anyone has a secret, please do tell. I would definitely recommend you give this a try!

This was great! I cooked three 5# chickens and basted them throughout with the pan drippings. Took about 2 1/2 hours over low heat on the gas grill and they were great!!  I used disposable cake pans as the cookie sheets seemed a bit flimsy. Will cook again.

Fabulous!  This was such a fun recipe to try.  We'll be having it again soon.  The chicken was deliciously moist and flavorful...however I found the skin to be a bit too salty for my taste.  When I make it again, I'll probably do as some others suggested and use garlic cloves or maybe even powder instead of so much garlic salt.  Great recipe though!  We ate the leftovers shredded on a salad with vegetables.  It was a big hit at my house!!

This is very good chicken done in this way, and the family enjoyed it alot.
I read several of the reviews before beginning.  Also, took some of the suggestions for the Drunken Chicken recipe on this site.
The changes I made were I used Italian dressing instead of the butter in the beer.  Also, rubbed the chicken down with seasoning salt, celery salt and pepper.
Will certainly make this again as my hubby isn't overly fond of roasted chicken,really liked this.  Half of the fun is the presentation.

This is fun recipe to make.  My only complaint is the last few times I have made it, the chicken fell over, everything got scorched or the heat of the grill burns the outside and doesn't cook the inside that well.  I also only do this on the grill for about 1 hour 45 minutes and it is cooked throughly.  I am going to try it another time, balancing the chicken on something and doing indirect heat for the  3 hours and see if that solves the burning problem.  Up until recently though this was a sure fire recipe that cooked in less than  2 hours.

I used a 5.5lb chicken and my grill is nowhere near this big so I followed a previous reviewer's advice and cooked at 350 degrees...although I rarely cook whole birds..following the advice, I estimated that it would be done about 2 hours later (assuming that 350 for 15 min per pound = about 1.5 hrs but chicken always take longer so I came up with 2 hours). I planned my "sides" around that time. WRONG! My chicken, for whatever reason, took much longer to be fully cooked. ALMOST 3 hours...oh well. I reheated the potatoes in the mirowave and the bird was indeed delicious! It smelled great cooking the entire time I was salivating while waiting. Will definately try this again...hopefully on my "almost inlaws" grill (I'll borrow it).  Thanks so much Barrie!

Did anybody else see this recipe with Matthew McConaughey on the Rosie O'Donnell show?  I tried it just because Matthew sounded so sexy saying "The liquid in the budweiser starts boilin'" but it's so good, and a little weird if you're into cooking different things.  Luv it.

This is a wonderful way to prepare chicken.  I only used half the butter called for and rubbed Emeril's bayou blast seasoning on the outside. It was also done in 2 hrs.

Nice moist chicken but lacking a little in flavour.  Next time will add more salt and pepper, and cook at higher heat to try and get a crisper skin.

Very juicy chicken!  I can say it's a success because my 13, 8, 6, and 1 year old all said it's good!!  Check out recipe for "drunken chicken" below.  Uses dijon mustard instead of all the butter (alot less fat).

Skin was very crisp. Meat very tender. Great chicken. I cooked a four pounder as directed. It did not need the full three hours. Start checking at two and a quarter hours.

This is the best barbequed chicken I have ever cooked or eated.  Four adults and even a child are raving about how good this is.  It is tender, juicy and very flavorful.  I used real garlic instead of garlic salt which added even more flavor.  Plus it's so easy to cook.  Just put it on the grill and baste a few times.  And try the grilled vegetables with it for even more good food.

I was leery of cooking with a metal can, so I simply poured half the mixture into the chicken, basted with the other half, then cooked it at 350 for a little over an hour (it was a 3 lb. chicken). Very moist and flavourful. Glad I used garlic powder (1/2 tsp) and not garlic salt - a substitution I always make when a recipe calls for garlic salt.

This is great.  The only way to fix chicken.  My kids beg me for Holidays to just make this instead of turkey.  I also add some lemon juice to the beer can and put a half of a lemon in the neck to seal everything in.  Give's it a great flavor.

We cook this on our Treager grill and you do not have to use beer, any liquid will do such as 7-up. A lot of beer cans are too tall so if you have the problem of not being able to close the lid pour the beer into another empty, shorter can such as a clean vegetable can you've saved.  Make sure you use a pot holder when removing the chicken....those cans really get hot.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out to be very plain. My guest could not even eat it after tasting the first bite. There was no flavor what so ever. I thought maybe I missed something in the directions but after checking several times, I have not missed anything. I will no be making this again.

I bought one of those stands that hold the beer can and it works well. Just to be on the safe side I found a small glass jar that fits where the beer can rests, the reason why is the aluminum can has paint on the outside and the inside from what I understand is coated with a plastic and its possible the heat might create a small reaction and impart something toxic. I know this sounds like a bit of a stretch but I read this info from a gentleman familiar with the beverage business and he warned people to take this into consideration, makes sense to me. Adios n' Bon Appetite!

This was alright. Both my hubs and I agree that with a bit of tweaking, this has great potential (at least for us). Although SUPER moist, the meat itself had very little flavor. All of the seasoning is in the skin (duh). I don't care for the skin so this was a real let down for me. :( I think rubbing the butter / herb mixture UNDER the skin would help impart much needed flavor. I will definitely make this change next time around. NOTE: It is not necessary to grease your can of beer. While this may make removal a *tad* easier, it isn't a must. I am happy to report that my hubs and I easily removed our bird from our 12 oz. can of Busch beer with no spillage, burning or heartache! If you can find one, use a stand made specifically for this purpose (it will make your life MUCH easier!). I picked up a beer can chicken stand at my local grocer for a mere $5.00. Grilled corn on the cob and baked potatoes rounded out our easy, summer meal. Thanks for sharing your unique and unorthodox method for preparing chicken, Barrie! :-)

Loved this recipe!  The chicken came out moist and flavorful, it was falling off the bone.  I made it as is and it was great, but now I want to mess around with the ingredients and maybe add some rosemary of some thyme to the seasoning.  I will be making this again!

Delicious!!  I made this on the grill & followed the recipe pretty closely.  The only thing was that I decided to check it at 1.5 hours & it was already done & slightly overcooked.  Next time we'll know to check it earlier.  But it was still really good.

I skipped the butter and did a dry rub of paprika, chili powder, ground cumin, Old Bay seasoning, onion flakes,  ( 1-2 TBL each) fresh ground pepper and salt. put lots of Dry rub on outside and inside of chicken and remaining in can of beer. Put wet wood chips on foil near heat to smoke chicken as well. Adds great flavor. Don't overcook I rotated the chicken every 1/2 hour.  , 3 pound chicken 1 1/2 hour tops  Let rest for 10 min.

Wonderful!  I have tried many whole grilled chicken recipes and I think I have found the one to keep.  I did use half butter and half EVOO, also rubbed the marinade under the skin before cooking.  We grilled tons of stuff - the chicken was what everybody kept going back to.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

We have been using this method for years. It has never failed! The only difference is that we inject the bird with a mixture of a small amount of lemon juice, orange juice and zesty italian dressing. So moist and so tasty! Thanks for sharing.

We cook this very often and absolutely love it. We season the chicken very well and insert can and onto BBQ pit. This is very easy b/c it doesn't take alot of attention while cooking. And the end result is very moist, delicious chicken.

This is an awesome recipe, I have always prepared it as it is with the exception of adding an onion to the neck.  This last time I cooked it I added 2 Tablespoons chili powder with the other spices and butter.  It was a huge hit.

My husband and I have experimented w/ many versions of beer-butt chicken, and as long as you use seasonings and beer that you like it will be awesome. But I would like to say that when it says to discard of half the beer, that would be "alcohol abuse" and you should definitely just drink it... =)

Great Recipe thank you!!! I made a few minor changes and it was perfect. I melted all of the butter & seasonings except the paprika and I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt. I then poured half into the beer can and inserted in the chicken. Next time I will take the advice of spraying the can with a nonstick spray as it was a little hard getting it out of the chicken. I also used a small glass Pyrex dish and the chicken stood up perfectly. I poured the remaining butter (I like margarine) mixture over the chicken and baked at 350 in the oven for about 1.5hrs basting every 25 mins or so. Some little changes but again a GREAT super easy recipe. Thanks!!

I must have done something wrong.  I made this in the oven at 350. It's probably better on the grill, like the recipe calls for. I followed the directions exactly, but the chicken didn't have much flavor. I should have marinated overnight. I had high expectations, both my husband and I were disappointed.

This is a great way to "roast" a chicken and keep it moist and flavorful while getting that wonderful browned skin all over the bird.  I found that 3 hours on our grill was a little long, usually 2 is sufficient and I used Lawry's season salt instead of the other seasonings and only a half a stick of butter(basting about every 30 minutes).  I also love adding fresh herbs to the beer (rosemary especially because the scent permeates the whole chicken).  I plan to try this in the oven after reading the other reviews.  Wonderful recipe that never disappoints.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The chicken was moist and the skin was really flavorful and crispy.  It smelled so good while it was cooking on the grill and couple of neighbors came over to see what I was cooking!  Thanks for the great recipe, it really is a keeper!

I have made the "beer can chicken" before by simply seasoning and dumping out half the beer. The butter in the can and on the outside of the chicken really does something wonderful for the bird! It was the best one I have ever made. Thanks so much for sharing!

WOW! This was awesome!! Entire family loved this, even my husband whom said he would not eat it while I was making it. He couldn't believe how much flavor it had. When I added the butter-spice mixture to the beer mine too fizzed out. I did read to use warm beer and this will not happen. I added a little lemon pepper to this spice mixture. I also added some lemon wedges into the neck of the chicken and put in some rosemary under the skin of the chicken. When I basted the chicken I basted under the skin as well. I also sprayed the beer can with Pam as suggested by others for easy removal when done. I cooked it in a pie glass baking dish on the grill. I have a charcoal grill so I can not control the heat. My 4 1/2lb bird cooked in 1 1/2 hours. I started testing the temp after 1 hour. The skin was crispy and full of flavor! The inside was super juicy and also full of flavor! Even the white meat. By far the best chicken I haave ever made. My husband, whom was skeptical, LOVED it!! I'm making this again this week!!

Been cooking beer can chicken for years.  I use 5-7 lb oven stuffer and bake it in the oven @350 till the pop up timer pops.  I just use any can filled 1/2 w/water, I also add about 1/2 tspn liquid smoke.  You can use any spice combination you prefer.

Don't let the blackened skin scare you---the meat in this chicken is very moist and flavorful! I followed the directions for the beer, and I would also suggest using warm beer to keep it from foaming. I also added some rosemary to the beer & butter mixture. I took another user's suggestion and lifted the skin before cooking and rubbed the breast with spices--I used lemon pepper and basil. I took a quarter of an onion and popped it down into the top of the chicken after I placed it on the can. I have a double chicken-roasting rack for the grill, so I did two birds. I just popped them on the grill and relaxed! No need to baste or anything.

I have made this many times and most name it "Beer Can Chicken". All are right in using different spices and other fluids can be used instead of beer..coke is one of the best if you dislike the flavor of beer...I have found that making a garlic and butter rub under and in the cavity and on the skin makes the meat very juicy, and season of your choice on the skin and then shake some sea salt on the skin for that crunch....For you smokers..use hickory.

This is a great way to eat chicken - I added 1 cup of mayonnaise to the rub and insured that some of the beer was out of the can before its' insertion...............rave reviews - every time - rememeber to use real mayonnaise vs. salad dressing for best results.

I thought this tasted great!  Have made it twice now since finding this recipe on here.  The second time, I omitted the melted butter in the can of beer and it came out just as good without wasting the other stick of butter.  I also found that the leftover chicken made an excelllent chicken salad the next day!  This was my first beer butt chicken experience and I liked it so much, I went out and bought a beer butt roasting pan.  So great!

This was pretty bland.  I don't understand how putting a can of beer and spices inside of a chicken is supposed to permeate the meat at all. I prefer basting a chicken and roasting it in the oven, ya'll!  Juicier and more delish.

I have been making this for year. Instead of using melted butter to baste, I use a large bag filled with crumbs and spices. Shake the chicken in the bag to coat. I also fill the can with garlic & onions. Great flavor

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out great. Very moist, perfectly browned skin. After reading some of the reviews I decided to make it in the oven. The house smelled so good while it was roasting. Everyone really liked it. I will definately be making this again this summer on the grill.  :)

Really good chicken.  You can switch up the spices/rub to whatever you want it to be.  I didn't have the special rack so I just stuffed the can in and put it on a glass baking dish and slid it on the grill.....good stuff.

We love this chicken!!! Don't overcook though - the white meat will dry out - 3 hours at 325 on my gas grill was too long (thermometer broke - ugh). Usually about 2 hours is good for my grill.

This chicken was amazing.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  I did baste it several times while it was cooking.  I will definitely be making it again.

My family loves this chicken. I also put about 1/3 cup italian dressing in the beer and it is really good.

I roasted mine in the oven 350 for almost 2 hours (no grill). I also used my own seasonings and only 1/2 stick of melted butter = plenty! Rubbed the melted butter and herbs all over chicken and under skin. I used half an apple to plug up the neck opening to hold in aromatic steam (I'm sure an onion or 1/2 lemon would be fine also). Pulling the legs to the front helped to stabilize/support the squatting chicken. I pammed the outside of the beer can but it was still pretty tricky coaxing it out of the cooked chicken. I like the idea of using a 16 oz beer can to make it easier to pull out after -- maybe I'll try that next. The chicken itself was good but not above what I would expect for a good roasted chicken. The drippings, however, made for the most flavorful and complex gravy I've ever made -- wow! And chicken always smells good in the oven but this one definitely had us counting minutes until dinner. Delicious! Thank you!

The chicken was so moist.  We served this to some friends, and even the extremely picky wife liked it!  I will definitely be making this again.

I make this all the time, but go to a Green Egg dealer and purchase a ceramic (stand/beer holder), much better than a can.  Chicken comes off easily and you can slide a heavy spatula under the holder to lift from the grill and place on a cutting board to transport from grill to the table.  I also cook mine on a Green Egg grill @300 for around 4 hours for a 5 pound chicken.  Try rubbing olive oil on the skin and then the rub of your choice.  I like to use a cajun rub to add a little spice to the chicken.  As a matter of fact, I put a 5 pounder on the grill this morning, (Thanksgiving) and will add some sweet potatos to the grill at 10:00 for our Thanksgiving dinner.

All I can say is WOW!!!  Although the name originally struck me as a bit crude, I couldn't wait to give this baby a try, and boy am I gald I did!  This was amazing.  My boyfried and son cleaned their plates before I even had a chance to make mine and join them at the table.  Although I strayed from the original recipe somewhat, I think that's where the beauty and simplicity of the recipe shines through.  You can add whatever spices you favor and you're still going to get a great end result.  I rubbed the chicken with half the spices and some extras (love the Weber Kickin' Chicken), put it in a large ziplock bag and let it sit overnight.  In the morning, used a pop can filled with half a bottle of Fat Tire along with the remainder of the spices, butter, a bit of cayanne pepper and some additional minced garlic.  Threw the bird on the grill with the center burner off.  About three hours later I turned the center burner on and the skin browned to perfection in about 30 min.  You don't need a fancy stand to pull this off, just make sure you spray the can with a non stick cooking spray before inserting it in to the bird, use any pan you don't mind throwing on the grill to catch drippings, baste with the drippings about every hour and viola.  Perfecto!!!

I have only one crticism of this recipes and one suggestion. The criticism: DISCARD THE BEER???? Drink it!

I have found wht I think is the best flavor: I add a use a red lager or ale as the beer. Most don't come it cans so I have a couple of empties arounf so I can use a good beer when I want it

I first saw this done in Boy Scout Camp many years ago.  I made two small chickens in the oven rather than the grill.  There is only one proper way to “disposed” of half the beer, Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great.  The kids loved it.  I will be trying this on the grill soon.

This is a great recipe - I'm a little nervous about the paint on a beer can to do it (call me a parinoid mom) so I substitute a mason medium tall jar filled 1/2 with beer (be sure to grease the jar as it sticks when coming out) added some garlic, onion slices, rosemary and thyme then rubbed olive oil on the outside of the chicken (with a few herbs under the skin, the meat falls of the bone... family LOVES it! I have also tried it with fruit juice - very good as well...

Too salty.  Use just garlic POWDER and add salt as you like.  The outside was dried out, even though I basted and covered with foil.  Cook at a higher temp for shorter time.

Awesome Chicken! I cooked in the oven, due to my not being home to grill. I brushed the chicken with butter, and seasoned with sea salt, parsley, basil and paprika. I filled the bottom of a roasting pan with water, then set the uprighted chicken in the pan; cooked on 325 for 3 hours. The meat was amazingly tender and fell off the bone. I look forward to grilling the next time I fix this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is the best, I will never just bake a chicken again.  I used Dr. Pepper instead of beer and changed the seasonings to meet my taste.  Baked in the oven at 350 for about 2 hours in a special pan designed to cook the chicken like the recipe.  You must try this.

Didn't make this "as is" (I seem to never do!!). Used just minced garlic in a 1/2 can of beer. For the outside, I rubbed the chicken with a little olive oil. Then rubbed on some of Emeril's Essence (recipe found on Foodnetwork, sorry allrecipes... and the result was outstanding. I had a 7-8 pound chicken, cooked it on the grill for 2 hours at a temp of 400, cooked internally to 180. Very good. Thanks!!!

I agree with the person who said it sound just a tad more appealing to call this 'beer can chicken'.  I have also tried variations of this with other beverages such as cola.  I don't find that the beer and/or beverage really does anything for the flavor.  Rather, I think it is the idea that the chicken is held upright and cooks more evenly, particular when cooked outside on a bar-b-que which tends to burn foods due to high temperature.  Use whatever combination of seasonings you like for chicken and I think you will get acceptable results.  I don't use anywhere near that much butter (just melt 1-2T) or even use olive/vegetable oil to achieve crispy skin.

Who would of thought sticking a beer can up a chicken's butt would create something so delicious.  I felt like my chicken was giving birth when I pulled the can out..LOL!  So good and yummy.  I did put mine in a 8x8 glass dish and only melted half the butter to put in the beer can and the other half I softened and smeared over and under the skin and rubbed all my favorite spices all over that to give it a nice stick.  I baked like others 350 for approx 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Basting every 1/2 hour.  I did add in a splash of water to the dish bottom because when the butter started melting it did brown up the bottom of the dish.  Perfecto.

ALWAYS great.  The moistest chicken you will EVER eat.  We don't add anything to the beer can though, we just rub the chicken with olive oil and our own blend of spices, then pull back the skin and rub underneath.  We also cut one large onion in half and insert it into the neck cavity.  Usually do it on the grill and use the liver and gizzard to make giblet gravy.

This is good.  It takes quite a while for the chicken to cook completely.  Make sure you chicken is done.  I made it once and it wasn't completly cooked and it kind of went down hill from there,

Great recipe!  I had heard about beer chicken but had never tried. I did change the spices a little bit...I melted the butter and added fresh rosemary,garlic and garlic salt and brushed the chicken with that throughout the cooking time.  The only thing that I think I would change is putting the oven up to 350, and cooking for a shorter time. It seemed to get a little tough around the edges cooking that long.  Just a thought...

This was absolutely delicious!  I am a bit of a "roasted chicken" conniseur, and I have to say this was the best whole (albeit not roasted) chicken I've ever had.  It was crispy on the outside, extremely juicy on the inside, and so EASY to prepare.  AWESOME!

This is a great recipe for beer can chicken.  I made two 5 lb chickens.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe other than using beer can chicken stands and then placing them on a grill topper used for veggies or fish for stability. The temperature was 200 degrees (F) and took a little over 3 hours to finish.  I covered them with foil for about 30 minutes while the rest of my dinner finished cooking.  Tender, juicy and tasty.  I am using the leftover chicken for chicken enchiladas tomorrow.   Thanks!

Really good, we enjoyed it very much.  I didn't add the paprika however because I wasn't sure how it would taste.  I always add extra garlic to everything.  Family loved it and would make it again.  Tricky to get it on the can and on the bbq but once there all was good.

Everybody was picking the pieces off the cutting board as it was being carved just like the Thanksgiving turkey.  Lots of "Mmmm's". Basted breasts by seperating skin and brushing inside like we do with garlic/herbs.Mmmmm...
Hint:  Make two and use leftovers with the Chicken Enchiladas II recipe...if there are leftovers!

We have made this many time and always loved it. I have tried many different ways of making it.  Placing bacon and onions under the skin or sliced lemons.  Always great chicken

Awesome recipe! Just the right spices! Tip- Start with a clean empty can. Use a funnel, add the melted butter mixture, then slowly add the beer. I don't know how you all can do it without a a rack to hold the can!!

This was by far the most amusing recipe I have made. I convection baked it for at 275 for 1.5 hours, and we couldn't stop laughing at the chicken 'standing' in the oven. I deviated from the recipe quite a bit, I didn't have any beer so used 1/2 can coke (it works on the Cola Pot Roast recipe from this site) and rubbed the chx with olive oil then seasoned well with rotisseri chx seasoning. It was by far the best chicken, moist and flavorful. I know I will make this comical 'coke butt' chicken again.

This is an easy and wonderful recipe. I have found several variations that work well by substituting other canned beverages and seasonings. My favorite is probably V8 juice in the can, and an onion in the neck to keep steam in. Root beer and lemon-lime sodas with a lemon in the neck is just another option. Experiment and enjoy!

Really, really good.  We've done a lot of beer butt recipes but this one is the best.  The only things we did different was cooking the chicken in the oven as there's way too much snow outside to grill right now.  It took about 1 hr. and 15 min. at 350. We also added a bit of poultry seasoning to the baste.  I can't wait till it's warmer to do this on the grill.

Very Good!  Only problem - the beer will expand and start flowing out of the top of the beer when you add hot butter.  I use this recipe but put most of the butter in the can without melting first.

Turned out very pretty, but the seasonings are very bland.  Needed garlic, rosemary, thyme and parsely.  To get the beer can off, using a piece of foil, wrap around the can while someone else holds the chicken.

Really easy to prepare and the bird looks great coming off the grill - made this for company and everyone was impressed.  We did puchase a beer can holder for the chicken which made it especially easy.

Everyone love this one. The meat was tender and juicy.  Wonderful flavor. I cooked mine in the oven in a throw away pan and put it on the lowest rack. I cooked it about 3 hours - used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.

This was a very good recipe. The chicken was extremely moist and flavorful. I lifted skin and placed on a poultry rub. For the butter mixture I used fresh minced garlic in leiu of garlic salt, and added a bit of oregano. Finally, I somehow missed the part about using a baking sheet and just placed the chicken on a beer-can stand, set it on the grill and cooked it on low for about 1 1/2 hrs, and it was done to perfection. Definitely a keeper, this one.

Delicious.  I bought one of those beer racks, which helps a lot.  On the instructions for those racks, it also suggests either stuffing a potato or onion in the bird's neck to keep the vapors inside I guess.  I did that and followed this recipe exactly.  It was the juiciest, most tender chicken I have ever had.  I definitely will serve this next time I have company.

This was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and juicy and I kicked up the bbq to medium  to lessen the cooking time. I didn't change the recipe much but I did add fresh chopped garlic to the melted butter I dont know if it made a difference but the chicken sure was delicious!

Perfect chicken in every way!  I served it with a garlic sauce:  12 cloves of garlic whipped up in a food processor with the juice of 1/2 a lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a bit of mashed potato (amount varies depending on how garlicky you want your sauce). Mmmmmmmmmm......

I've come across a lot of chicken recipes here-NEVER have I come across one so JUICY!  The smell is fabulous while it's cooking.  The colouring of the paprika makes it look professionally done.  The first time I made it-it sat on low on the BBQ for 2-3 hours, just used small bird with a "silver bullet" small can up it's butt.  It sat fine-no issues-and we ended up turning off the BBQ after 2.5 hours, because we weren't done having fun at the neighbours yet.  I honestly thought it would be ruined, sitting in an unlit BBQ for about 2 hours.  Then I was scared when I invited the neighbours over to partake in our Butt Chicken... In the end, I wanted them to go home because I wanted to eat more chicken!  Delicious-one of the best found recipes yet!
Thank you. 
I'm making it again tonight = despite the really cold weather out there... it's worth it!

Excellent! I've made chicken like this before and it wasn't very good.  This recipe showed me the secret is adding seasonings to the beer. I cooked without the butter and had the grill on medium heat-it only took 1 hour despite the 25 F temperature outside. Fabulous!! My daughter thought the chicken sitting on the can was hysterical.

A weekly must-have in the summer when it's too hot to bake, and excellent any other time we feel like grilling.

Very good!  Very easy!  Followed the recipe completely, but got some imput along the way.  Here's what the nice man at Kroger said:  He just takes any old empty can and fill it with a ready-made marinade.  In his opinion, this makes it more flavorful!  Next time, I plan to fill a can with chicken broth, garlic and other spices.  Hope it's as delicious!!!

This is great and so easy.  I've made this two or three times now and every time it has been great.  Everyone loves how moist and flavorful it is.  And it's a hoot to see that chicken sitting on that beer can.  We bought a holder for the beer can so it doesn't tip over.  However, there is never much left over.  I need to find a bigger chicken so we could have some leftovers for chicken sandwiches the next day.

We love this!!!It was so easy. I used a fryer for a speedy dinner. I also used olive oil and Penzy's Old World seasonings and lot's of garlic powder. I will make this again and again.

I loved this.  The meat stayed incredibly moist.  I used a fryer chicken, and only grilled it for about 1 hour, much less time than the recipe calls for.  My husband thought the meat had a funny taste, but he still ate it.

I wasn't sure if we had enough propane so I cooked it in the oven at 325 for about 2 and 1/2 hours. I made it for company and we all thought it was excellent. I can't wait to try it on the grill!!!

This chicken is absolutely delicious...and very easy to prepare.  I saw a variation on the Food network which was listed as a favorite BBQ recipe.  I am so glad I found it!

Considering myself as the worst bbq cook I tried this chicken today..... all meats turn our dry unfortunately. I somewhat changed the recipe a little by using half bbq seasoning and half cajun seasoning instead of the other spices. The chicken turned out to be absolutely delicious and moist. My guests loved it so much that they will be making some next weekend.  The next time I will try  the original recipe.......mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm can't even nibble on anything  no leftover.  Also instead of using a disposable cookie sheet I used a pirex dish....worked perfectly....but you must spray it with Pam first.....

Awesome flavor. Used Chicken breasts. fryed in spices for about 5 minutes to marinate in the flavor then grilled on the barbeque and further basted chicken in sauce.

We didn't think this was anything spectacular.  Actually, I made a better one in the oven last week.  I guess it's nice not to heat up the oven in summer but otherwise I'll stick to my old recipe.

Seriously tender and juicey, and my husband loved preparing and grilling it. He thought it was funny, and a great novelty for backyard BBQs. We used Heineken beer and grilled it on low for 4 hours. Wow!!!

Great recipe. I let the chickens sit overnight in the dry rib rub. The only change i made was to eliminate the salt and pepper from the baste and can. The rub had enough to go around. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Boston chicken has nothing on this recipe. Nothing like grilling in new england in the winter when the results are this fabulous.  I cooked two chickens in two hours on low on the grill.

There were many great reviews about how good this chicken was either on the grill or in the oven. But I was not impressed. I cooked my chicken in the oven at 350 for almost two hours and I ended up with just a typical baked chicken. The skin wasn't crispy at all. The meat was very good but boy, did I end up with a mess in my stove. I wont use this recipe again. If I want to cook a whole chicken there are simpler ways of doing it. I love the roasted chicken recipes from this site.

This is an amazing Chicken dish. I usually only cook parts but decided to give this a try. I followed another reviewers advice and used the spices from Texas Pork Ribs. I coated the chicken with it and then put about 2 tablespoons in the can with 1/2 C Butter. I had it last night and that's all I've been able to think about today. I truly have never had such a tender, juicy and moist chicken. I cooked two 4 lb chickens for 10 people and there was nothing left over.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I would have given it five stars, but I felt I couldn't because I made so many substitutions to the recipe - the biggest of which was to use the dry rub recipe on this website for the Texas Pork Ribs.  I use it on everything - it's a little sweet, a little spicy and gives a great crust when you roast.  I also tossed in about 1/4 a bottle of chipotle Tabasco into the beer can.  I cooked two 4-lb. chickens and they came out glorious in less than 90 minutes on my grill.  I also used a cheap tin roasting pan and it worked just fine.  The chicken skin was amazing!

I make this using a garlic-olive oil rub instead of butter (healthier!). Try it with lemon slices in between the skin and breasts, and experiment with different spices. Next time I'll try it sprinkled with paprika, yum! The chicken comes out incredibly moist and tasty and it's so easy to just let it go on the grill instead of basting in the oven. Perfect for spring and summer dinners. I will definately look into the Chicken Bistro - the first time I made this, my chicken "hit the deck". (We still ate it sans-skin and it was great...)

For those of you who had problems with the chicken falling over - I purchased an item at Home Depot called Chicken Bistro made by Char Grill. It is basically a base,  and a pan with holes where you attach metal "spikes " that form an arch onto which you place the chicken standing up. the pan serves the same purpose of the beer can - it holds the marinade for the chicken. This made cooking the chicken effortless with no spillage, toppling or mess. The base also has four smaller '"spikes" on which you can cook whole potatoes or other vegetable along with the chicken.  Hope this helps!

It was okay...I didn't really taste the difference between this and a slow roasted chicken.  It was tender and juicy, but no real added flavor. Probably will just stick with my good old fashioned slow raosted chicken in a roasting pan in the oven.

My chicken didn't turn out as good as I had hoped, but it was definitely my fault.  We were running short on time and so we weren't able to cook the chicken as long as the recipe instructed. It didn't turn out as juicy or flavorful as intended. Our chicken also fell over during the last few minutes, but I don't think that effected anything.  Would definitely try again, but I'll make sure I have plenty of time.

Wow is this good and sooooo easy!  I cut the garlic salt and paprika in half - seemed like too much.  Be prepared to fight over who gets to eat the skin!

This was GREAT!!!!!  Fun, easy and the end result was scrumptious!!!  Will make again and again.  I did make mine in the oven and it did tip over towards the end of cooking, but we dipped the chicken in the spilled seasoned butter.

What a RIOT this was to make!  My husband and I made it together on a Saturday afternoon.  I must say it was one of the moistest chickens I have ever eaten.  Keep in mind that the breast is the most difficult area to add flavor.   You need to inject a brine solution into it if you wanted more.  Thanks for sharing.  We're bring this to our next Redskin tailgate!

The chicken was very juicy, although next time I think I will try injecting it with some seasoning for a bit more flavor.  It was fun to make for guests, but it did take much longer than I expected (about 2 1/2 hours for a 6 pound chicken).  Our oven is old though, which probably contributes to some of the time.   I highly recommend using a sturdy roasting pan since this creates a lot of drippings and can be heavy.  
This recipe is great on the grill!  Store-bought chicken holders really help a lot with carrying from the grill to the house too.

I agree with almost everyone else who reviewed this recipe.....it is FUN and it is DELICIOUS!  The chicken comes out so moist and even though I rarely touch the skin, I had to eat some of the crunchy, tasty parts.   I will definitely make this again, especially with the grilling season starting, but I will cook at least 2 at a time!
Oh, it took mine a little longer to cook also, but I used a 5 pound chicken....   This was Terrific!

The chicken did come out nice and moist, but even though I went by the recipe it was WAY too salty!! If I make this again, I will probably use my own blend of seasonings. I also used Vanilla Coke instead of beer, and it worked just fine. I admit, I did have fun with the idea of it.

After reading all the great reviews I just had to try this recipe. Sorry to say I was not impressed at all.  Although the chicken was very moist it had little to no flavor so I won't be making this again.

This is great, I took KEN-N-STEPHS advise and drank up that beer, (could that be any funnier).  I'm lucky enough to have a giant grill, so this worked out, although it looked very strange.  Thanks Barrie!

I am so glad that I tried this!  The chicken smelled heavenly while cooking, and turned out so moist inside, and made a delicious, crispy skin.  My 2 yr old son gobbled it up, and my 6 yr old son asked for seconds!  They are the pickiest eaters I know, so I was thrilled.  The whole family is requesting it again!

I bought a chicken that was too big to fit on my grill standing up..... So I cooked it on the grill lying down and it was terrific.  My 4 and 1 year old kids loved it.  Can't wait to buy the size chicken called for in the recipe and see if it is even better when it works right.

FANTASTIC!  This was by far one of the juiciest, most flavorful chickens I had ever tasted, and the VERY first time I'd ever put a beer up a chicken's butt - I promise!  :)  This recipe is easy and FUN to make, and turns the chicken skin golden brown and delicious.  I made it for guests the first time for an outdoor bbq, and it was not only mouth-watering delicious, but made for great party conversation.  My guests said I had found the secret to the Colonel's secret recipe!  Everyone fought over the skin and demanded the recipe.  PERFECT!

As everyone has said, outstanding flavor!!! Will definately do again, how about doing several at a time in a roaster pan on the grill?  Think I will try that next time I have a group for dinner.

This is really good.  I had made it several times using "Mrs. Dash" as the seasoning and it is wonderful.  I use a foil pan to catch the drippings and this makes cleanup very easy, too.

Listen yall, I have VERY finiky eaters in my family. They LOVED it! Very strange I admit, with the beer can thingy--BUT! Try it, you will love this. It is winter here in NY, so of course I can't 'grill out', so I stuck it in my oven. Totally Awesome!

I tried this with both beer and cola.  I think the cola was better, I think that you really don't get the flavor with beer as you do with cola.  But friends loved both.  It is a really easy BBQ dish that you can start way ahead and enjoy the party.

This was the most tender chicken I've ever had!  Next time I will cut down on the cooking time - 2 hours was good for my propane grill, and I'll use less salt (maybe try garlic powder instead of salt).  Yummmmmmmy!

Have used this recipe for several years now.  I thought as most people do, that
 this recipe was absurd.  But after sampling the crispy seasoned skin and moist 
and delicious meat, it will become one of your favorite grill recipes. 
Note:  
  Do not pour out the beer from the can...Drink it!!!

I wanted to try this recipe but didn't have a whole chicken.  I used two cornish game hens instead.  I reduced the amount of beer to about 1/4 can for each bird.  I also had to increase the basting mixture a bit.  It wasn't hard.  The birds were great--but next time I use game hens, I will reduce the cooking time to about 45 minutes.  It was fun!

I tried this on my grill, but it was not big enough to fit the whole chicken.  My grill has a top tier to it and it just didn't work on the grill with everything trying to fit.  So instead I cooked the chicken in the oven and basted the chicken in the beer and all of the other ingredients.  I am not sure how it would have tasted on the grill, but it was delicious baked in the oven.  All of the different flavors gave the chicken a great taste and it was very moist.  If I ever have a grill big enough, I will definitely try it again.

I really enjoyed the chicken and my kids loved it too, but next time I would not use garlic salt but switch to real garlic like some of the other testors did.  It was too salty with the amount called for in recipe.

My friends thought I was crazy cooking chicken like this until it was time to eat, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used real garlic for extra flavor. I love it.

Would have gave this 5 stars but found it almost too salty to eat and my chicken was close to 6 pounds as opposed to the suggested 4 pound chicken. I will definitely make this again but might use ground garlic instead of garlic salt.

This recipe is a keeper! I made it as written, but my 5 lb chicken was done in about 75-90 minutes- I did stand it in a cast iron skillet on the grill- not sure if that made a difference in cooking time.  Regardless, the skin was beautifully brown and crisp, and the meat was super moist and flavorful. I can’t wait to try it again using some suggestions from other reviewers (Dijon & Honey). Thank you

*TIP: When time to get beer can out, have another person stay can with a knife to hold it in place 
*Added onion, garlic and some cold butter, along with the  seasonings into the beer can.  DO NOT ADD hot butter the cold beer.  You'll have a mess.
      I baked mine in the oven, I just knew it was not dry having left it uncovered. It was so juicy.   1 hour in, I rebasted it.  I made it as directions except I added (see above) to the beer can). 
* Make sure you added some liquid too the pan so drippings do not burn.

This is a great recipe for I guess a how to for beer butt chicken. I thought it lacked in flavor and spice the first time I made it like this. I then saw a recipe of Bobby Flay's for beer butt chicken where he used taco seasoning to season the chicken and he even put some in the can. I made my own taco seasoning and added tons of spices to it. Rubbed the chicken down with olive oil then rubbed the seasoning on it, and let it sit while the oven was preheating. And don't forget to put some in the can. Once the chicken is on the can, i took some lime quarters and stuffed them through the top however many would fit. We thought this way, the chicken was so flavorful from the spices and seasonings, with a hint of lime.

This recipe has been a regular in my household and it never fails me, super juicy breast meat & wonderful crispy skin with just enough salty/rotisserie flavor! remember to spray your beer can with cooking spray where the chicken touches as it can get stuck after baking hehe! Makes excellent chicken soup/stock leftovers.

The chicken came out incredibly moist and tender... literally falling off the bone.  It was a little too salty though... next time I'll use unsalted butter.

I shredded the leftovers the next day.  Heated them up and mixed with bbq sauce... excellent.

Question...I tried this recipe before and it's amazing.  Could someone not how much salt and pepper they exactly use?

I like to have exact measurements because it allows for optimal results each time I make the recipe...:)

I tried the suggestion of putting the spices under the skin and letting it sit in the frig for several hours.  I also only used 1/2 cup butter and it was EXCELLENT.  My husband raved about it.  I used an oven "drunken chicken" dish where there is a place that holds the beer can and it catches all the juices around the dish.  I added onions in the dish just because we love onions. The skin was crispy and delicious.  This is a keeper and will definitely be making it again.

This chicken was unbelievably good.  My 11-year old couldn't get enough and I caught my husband having the one remaining piece for breakfast!  Excellent flavor and couldn't have been more moist.  Family is already asking me when we are going to have it again!

The seasoning in this recipe is DELICIOUS. I however cook mine in the oven instead of on the grill - 350 for about 1h15. Delicious!

I've made this recipe for a few years in almost exactly the same way as this recipe.  I turns out great every time, I just prepare as instructed with half under the skin and some out the outside and then the rest in the cup up the butt.  Put it on the grill for 1 1/2 hours and it's done and delicious.  I often put potatoes around the base of the pan, they get to cook in the juices and are fabulous too!

Oh MY GOSH! This was phenomenal! I used boneless skinless chicken breast since we dont ever buy whole chickens. And ended up doing the recipe as follows:

1 c butter
2 Tbsp garlic powder
2 Tbsp paprika
1 - 12 oz can of beer (used the whole thing)
1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast
1.5 tsp italian seasoning
.5 tsp onion powder

I melted the butter and added all the seasonings and beer to make it into a marinade and then marinated the chicken in the fridge for about 2 1/2 hrs. Took it out and grilled in on medium- high heat. IT WAS SOOOO moist! I kept checking it, and when it was all white i took a bite and almost thought it was not cooked all the way! NOPE! It was COMPLETELY done. I have NEVER had chicken breast so juicy in my LIFE. Just WOW. I know that i havent necessarily a true 5-star based on the recipe as written, but what i did was AMAZING. the only part i will probably do differently next time is use 1.5T garlic salt as it was a little on the salty side. I boiled the marinade while the chicken was cooking and then strained out the solid parts and had an amazing sauce to drizzle on the chicken and polenta. not that it was needed though!

Wow! I am new to cooking and tried this.  Read the reviews and took some suggestions. #1 make sure your grill is big enough to stand up a chicken.  We ended up making it in the oven.  350 as suggested by another reviewer.  I coated the outside with the seasoning before cooking, added to the beer (used the Pam trick on the outside of the can) and  Basted maybe 2x.  Outside was crispy, inside was moist.  It is a definite have again at my house!

Delicious, moist and tender, and so so easy!  Tasted like a rotisserie chicken from the deli counter but fresh and using only the ingredients we wanted!  We rubbed the chicken down with a blend of: smoked hickory himalayan sea salt, chipotle tobasco, grapeseed oil, white truffle oil, paprika, pepper, rosemary and garlic.  Delicious!!  We served this with the Quinoa Spinach pilaf recipe found on this site (but subbed out Kale for the spinach).  Highly recommend this well-rounded meal!

This was fabulous!  Just the aroma while it was cooking had us salivating.  The tip others have noted regarding spraying the tops of the cans with cooking spray was very much appreciated.  I combined several of the seasoning suggestions from other reviewers, but I don't think you can go wrong improvising with your favorite seasonings.  My sons love the slightly naughty recipe name - it's a "guy" thing, I guess!

This is so good and pretty easy and cheap too.  I use smaller chickens and bake them in the oven. I son't always use butter and it's still just as good.  I use sea salt and have used pabst and even miller lite and it's been perfect each time.  Another review said to stuff the neck cavity with foil so the moisture wouln't escape and I always do that.  I used a potato once too and that worked.

Chicken doesn't get much better than this.  If you're a kitchen gadget lover like I am, there are stands for preparing this on the grill to set the beer can in, and place the chicken on.  If you use this, then the cavity of the chicken will still be open to stuff with celery, onions, and carrots for even more flavor! The flavor is excellent, I also like to put parsley and a little chicken grill seasoning on mine.

So good!  Skin was packed with flavor, and surprisingly crisp, and flesh was plump and juicy.  Added a couple of sprigs fresh rosemary to neck cavity, which didn't impart any flavor.  Would like to add that it'd be easier to melt both sticks of butter, take off the heat, add spices.  Pour half into can, leave half out for basting.  this may be common sense for most folks, but I was left scratching my head.  Only thing missing was a better flavor in the latter; will try marinating or rubbing down (or both) the night before.  Thanks for great base recipe.

This chicken was so good.  I followed the directions except coated the chicken a few hours before cooking, put it in ziplock bags and refrigerated. I also added a little onion powder and cheyenne pepper to the coating.  Everyone loved this chicken.  It was a great way to make chicken without heating up the house.

This was so good!  I made it in the oven in a dish that has a raised well in it so I was able to still make it like the can idea. I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. The seasoning and beer method was wonderful and so moist. Will make for sure again.

SOOO good, but made a few changes.  I used used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, didn't use paprika, and added lime juice into the butter.  I also added honey into the butter I basted the chicken with and basted every 30 mins. Last but not least, I used the remaing lime to stuff in the neck opening.  This was so moist and flavorful!!!  Will definatly do it again!

Awesome!  I cooked this on the bbq on low, and it took about 2 hours. We used our leftover chicken to make chicken tortillas the next day. I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely wonderful...so moist and flavorful! It took less than 2 hours in a 275 degree gas grill to cook and was PERFECT! Hubby said this is a "keeper" and I totally agree.

Very good and easy! I wasn't able to get my grill below 300 degrees so cooked at half the time(1 1/2 hrs) and turned out perfect.

Turned out great.  Didn't have a throw away pan so used a corningware dish lined with a foil oven bag.  I read reviews first before making.  Cooked it on a 3 burner gas grill, turned the middle burner off and used indirect heat.  I did spray the beer can with olive oil.  The chicken was crispy and tender with just the right combination of seasonings and hardly any cleanup.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe.  Can't wait to make this again when we have guests.

I never knew chicken could taste this good.  We actually put an onion in the neck to seal in the moisture and smoked the chicken with hickory chips on our grill.  I bought a larger chicken so we'd have leftovers and we almost ate it all!  Highly recommended.

This was excellent, I cooked it on the BBQ with the holder that I have specifically to hold the can of beer, It cooked for 1 hour instead of 3 and was still infused with the garlic flavor, great recipe, thanks

Delicious & moist.  I used budweiser and rubbed the chicken skin with hiney mustard first. A few unexpected things happened though when making this recipe, when I added the spices & butter to the can, it caused the beer to fiz out, I assume that was supposed to happen inside the oven into the chicken cavity. And after cooking for over 1.5 hrs (5.5 lb chicken), it still appeared red inside. I don't know if it was the paprika or it wasn't fully cooked, but it was annoying to finish the cut meat in the microwave just to be sure. The skin was flavorful and crispy. Will make again!

This was good, but mine did not pick up as much flavor as I expected.  NOTE: a previous reviewer recommended a 16 oz can of beer - DON'T do that, it won't go all the way in and the whole thing is very wobbly.  They also recommended using a glass (pyrex) baking dish.  Mine cracked completely in half.  Gas grill, low heat, 4 burners.  Ready in 2 hours and had to cover it with foil because it was burning.  I'm only rating on the flavor, not on my "mechanical" mistakes.  Did everything according to recipe.

Ok I will admit i was skeptical of this recipe. I made this for my husband for Father's Day Dinner. While he always eats what I cook, this was the first time he commented without me asking him what he thought. His exact words were "Wow, this one gets an A+++". This recipe allows for so many different ways to do it, it's amazing.  The meat was very tender and yes I am talking about the white meat. Thanks Barrie for  an outstanding idea!!!!!!!!!! Oh and P.S. get the chicken stand, it will make cooking it much simpler, or cook two so they lean against each other. Thanks Again!!!!!!!!!!

Holy cow...er, chicken, this was GREAT!  So unbelievably EZ; clean chicken, mix up basting sauce & brush it on, put it on the grill, closed the lid and come back in 3-hours!  I did put in a remote thermometer and we were actually able to pull it off the grill in 2-1/2 hours (i.e. 180-degrees).  We'll be putting many of these on the grill come 4th of July and future 'anydays'!  Thanks for great recipe, and "EZ"!  :-)

This recipe is excellent - a definite keeper! I cooked it in the oven, and after the chicken was cooked, I emptied the liquid in the can into the pan drippings to loosen the stuff on the bottom of the Pyrex dish. I defatted the liquid using a defatter and made gravy. It was rich and delicious! I honestly don't know if I'll ever make chicken the way I used to.

I have made this numerous times on a vertical roaster sitting in a glass brownie pan rather than the beer can, and roasted it in the oven. I rubbed it with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and then put Old Bay Seasoning all over it. It can also be done with Lawry's Season Salt.

This is a great recipe.  I usually add fresh herbs from the garden and lots of garlic to the beer can and stuff the neck cavity as well.  For George in Wisconsin, in British Columbia we give our hubbies the discarded beer while enjoying a fresh one.

The seasonings did not give the chicken much flavor. The cooking method worked well for me but 3 hours was too long, my chicken was about 3.5 lbs and would have been done at about 2 hours. It still tasted good but was dry. I put a catch under the chicken for the grease and was able to make a gravy out of it.

We have made our chicken like this on the grill for YEARS!!  It's the only way to grill chicken. We've experimented adding different liquids to the beer, like crab boil, teriyaki, hot sauce or worscestershire(sp?) sauce. It's always good.

My chicken turned out very moist and flavorful.  I did add some generic seasoning for Chicken to the spices to add a little more flavor. I used a large can of Miller Lite from the convenience store.  The larger can seemed to hold it pretty steady.  Using a disposable aluminum pan made clean up a cinch.  I used a thermometer to make sure it was cooked to the right temp on the grill.  Used leftover chicken to make chicken salad sandwiches the next day. Will make again!  Thanks.   2nd try 9/4/15 So this time I tried to use the large beer can again and my new grill would not close!  So, in the oven at 350 degrees it went and about 1.5 hrs later it was done.  I added cut up potatoes, onion, and carrot during the last hour and it was perfect.  Putting the disposable  pan inside a sturdier broiler pan for the oven made it more steady and easy to clean up.

It works everytime.  I grill mine on outside.  You don't have to plug the neck cavity as long as you pull the skin over it.  I follow the recipe to a T.  My husband usually doesn't eat anything with bones, but he loves this recipe. Tender and moist like you wouldn't believe.  Cook 2 at a time and use the other for soup, sandwhiches, or salads you won't regret it.

Oh my goodness I cannot express my love for this chicken.  Tender, moist, flavorful...mmmm.  Make sure to peel the skin up and get some of that buttery spicy goodness under it- you won't be sorry.  I used some sage as well as the recommended spices and put it in my 350 degree oven for two hours.  It was falling apart tender and I could hardly stop eating it Yum!

This recipe is AMAZING! The flavors are wonderful and the meat is so tender. I made this the other day and didn't have a can of beer on hand, but had a can of cider instead, so I used that, and it came out soo tasty! This one is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious! We make this nearly once a week - we can eat some that night and use the remainder in other meals. I'll probably never buy rotisserie chicken again. This is too easy. I like trying different herbs in the liquid, too.

We make this all of the time except we take the skin off of the chicken.  Then we rub it lightly with canola oil and cover it with Lawry's.  Even without the skin it stays very moist because of the beer. My brother does the same except he covers his chicken with rosemary.

I have made chicken this way numerous time. One thing I do is buy those cheap aluminum pies pans in like the dollar stores. I set the chicken on the beer holder rack thing in that, on the grate of a charcoal grille. I also pour some beer in the pan just enough to keep some fluid in it while chicken cooks. Also I think something that is important. On a charcoal grille get the coals good and hot, only around the outside perimeter of the grille. Leave the coals on the outside so that the chicken sets in the pan in the middle. That way it does not get over done. I have found at least an hour cooking this way for each lb. chicken you cook. Seasoning is up to what you like, me the more the better. I coat the chick in olive olive then softened butter and season it up. Fridge it for a while, then stick it on the grille and walk away, of course with the lid on..if it will fit. Gotta be careful your chicken isnt too big. Then when it looks done just check it with a meat thermometer,to be safe. Good stuff!

Followed recipe exactly and it was excellent.  Keep in mind that it dosen't take 3 hours to cook if the chicken is smaller.  Absolutely the best way to cook chicken.  I used to plunk the chicken on the grill but it always caught on file.  Placing the chicken/beer can or holder on a tin pie plate catches all the drippings and no fat fires.  Thank you for excellent recipe.

Um, it was pretty good.  I used a soda can that I filled w/ half beer and then the butter.  I roasted a 6.5lb perdue oven stuffer for 1.5 hrs at 400 and 30 mins at 375.  I used my own seasoning mix (throw everything in my spice rack on it basically).  When I removed the chicken, and tried to pull out the can, beer/butter/juices went everywhere.  What a mess.  It didn't evaporate fully.  However, the chicken was very very juicy.  Almost unbelievably juicy.  And the bird being propped up like that ensures a nice even roast.  Still - not worth the mess, I'll stick with regular roast chicken and maybe just pour seem beer/butter into the cavity next time.  Thanks for the fun attempt, though!

We made this in the oven like some people had suggested and it was moist and great.  The rack to hold the can made it really easy too.  We didn't have canned beer so we emptied a diet coke can and filled it with the bottled beer we already had at home.

I have been making this chicken for years. I rub the chicken with olive oil then use lemon pepper all over the out side. I also Put either garlic , an onion or I have even used an apple cut up in the top where the neck is. it gives it great flavor. I have used soda and even apple juice.(in a can) I'm not sure if the herbs in the beer make a different but i ALWAYS ADD A LITTLE Thyme AND GARLIC  and season salt in the can. I think it is mainly the steaming of the substance in the can but who knows it is really a great way for making chicken. I have the stand that they make for it... much easier.

Wow what great flavor!! And so easy to make!! I added all the butter and spices together in the pan and just put half in the beer can and spread the rest over the chicken. Unfortuanally my grill ran out of fuel so I broke the chicken up and broiled the rest of the time. So moist and yummy!! Going to make great sandwiches tomorrow!!

Great tasting chicken although I used the oven, next time I will use the grill. The receipe sounds weird but tastes great! I didn't have a can of beer so I emptied out a soda and opened a bottle of beer and poured it into the can and drank the rest! Cheers!

It was raining hard outside so I cooked in the oven (as another member suggested) at 350 for a little over 2 hours - I cooked two smaller ones as I was pressed for time.   Excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken is fabulous and the recipe is great as is.  One tip, however, is to make the seasoning mixture in two batches.  One half to pour into the beer can and the other half to reserve and use as baste.  This allows the seasonings that sink to the bottom of the mixture to flavor both inside and out!  Yummy!

Best chicken ever!!! I made these just like the recipe stated, except I added 10 minced cloves of garlic to the beer/butter mixture and baked them in the oven at 350 for 2 hours - the tip about spraying the cans first by the previous reviewer is key! Also make sure you let them rest for 10 or 15 minutes after cooking to retain all of the fantastic juices! YUM!

The chicken is now a staple in my kitchen!  I made the mistake of making only one chicken and it was easily devoured by my four little girls.  They could not get enough of this and keep asking for me to make it every night!

Very tender but I don't think this requires the beer. A rack and good seasonings gets the same flavor and the issue of getting that can out of a hot, juicy chicken wouldn't be a problem.

I've made this twice now and everyone raves about it.  The second time I made two chickens like some of the reviewers said with the intentions of taking some to work the next day for lunch... well... it was gone!!!  I made two 5lbs chickens and had NOTHING leftover from 3 adults and one teenage boy...  So I guess I'll  have to make three next time ..  Thank you for such a GREAt recipe!

REALLY yummy but my husband and I thought we could get away with half the amount of baste because we thought it was a little on the salty side. I think I'll cut the mixture in half next time and try. Other than that, EXCELLENT.

This was so AWESOME!!!  I followed the directions and it came out great.  I had a 4 1/2lb. bird and it cooked in 2 1/2 hrs rather than 3.  I mixed some Montreal grill seasoning into the melted butter and added it to the can as well.  I took some x-tra melted butter and seasonings and basted it every 1/2 hour.  The skin was golden and crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.  I used what was left over (pretty much just the bones) and simmered it the next day for a small pot of chicken soup.  The broth had great flavor!  Will make this part of our regular meal rotation.

Awesome! I bought a beer can chicken holder for a couple of bucks and it worked out really nice. Especially when rubbing the chicken with the spices. I added a few more spices but, I don't think you really need to. The chicken broke right in half when pulling it off the holder. It was very moist too! Will make again and again for sure!

AMAZING!  So simple yet such flavor!  We made 2 to feed to large families.  I must say they were really cute sitting in the grill together, facing each other...so much so, that my 6 yr old DD said "It looks like they're having a tea party!".  Summertime favorite!!

I skipped melting the butter in a skillet part and just melted the butter and poured on the chicken after putting the rub in, cooked on low on a grill for about 2 hrs (3.5 lb chicken). Let the chicken rest 20 minutes and it was so juicy and the skin was nice and crispy.  This was a no brainer and needed little attention.  Everyone loved this.

Chicken turned out very good. I baked it in the oven considering it is winter, but I think it would be better on the grill. I also seasoned the chicken with Garlic Pepper. Turned out very juicy. I might leave it in a little longer to dry it out a bit next time, but none the less very good.

I never laughed so hard while preparing dinner!  My husband had to help me "sit" the chickens on the beer cans as they were slippery and bulky.  (We were having company so I was making 2).  We were BOTH laughing getting these ready for the grill!  I must say, this was the BEST chicken I have EVER made on the grill!  So tender,juicy and FULL of flavor!  Everyone loved it and most had seconds.  I will make this again and again!  It didn"t take as long as the recipe stated so check the bird's temperature when you think it might be ready, because it probably will be!  Thanks for this great recipe!  What fun!

I sent this to my brother a long time ago and he said he loved it. I just tried on a camping trip and boy was it good. The Chicken was so tender and tasty. I'm not a fan of beer so I was surprised at the good taste. Thanks for the Recipe!

This is really good. I just made it tonight and it took about 2 1/2 hours over low heat. It really tasted like something at a restaurant - so good! I recommend making the Zucchini Boats on the Grill on this site as a side dish.

I have been making this chicken for years, and it is delicious.  I decided not add the butter to the can of beer to help with the fat and calories and I don't really know what it would have added as the beer addes moisture to the chicken.  I did however make the butter basting sauce but changed it up a bit (added hot sauce and seasoning salt); it was delicious.  The only other change I made was to seal up with neck of the bird so moisture could not escape - great suggestion.

This was just delicious!  I used a 4 pound bird and cooked it for about an hour and a half.  I think it was done in about an hour and fifteen minutes though.  Still - very good - will definitely make again!

Tender and moist, I used lemon pepper and garlic on one chicken and Penzey's Northwoods seasoning on another.  They were both awesome!

We made it just as the recipie said and it turned out so good!  We had a gas grill and a 4 pound bird.  Even on low, it only took about an hour.  Definately a keeper!

I changed this recipe a bit, added fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and substituted cajun seasonings for the paprika.  I also added a tsp of tabasco to the butter mixture.  I had a 4 lb chicken and he took about 1 1/2 hours to cook and was amazingly moist and juicy.  Recipe is a definite keeper, will make again and again, expiramenting with the spice combinations each time!  Thanks!

Okay, I tried this last night.  I roasted it in the oven and stayed with the recipe.  First of all I should have cooked it a bit longer but that had nothing to do with the recipe.  I do think this recipe has huge potential as the chicken was moist and tender. Husband loved it.  I will work with the seasonings a bit and see if that helps knock my socks off a bit more.  I also think if it were made on the grill the taste would be outstanding.

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and VERY easy. I made mine in the oven along with some seasoned potatoes and everything turned out perfect. My boyfriend and his roommates had seconds- and they never eat what I make! God Bless whoever came up with this recipe!

My family loves this chicken.  I have made it in the past by just rubbing the chicken with paprika, salt, pepper.  I thought it was good that way until I added the butter.  It really kept the chicken moist inside.  Great for summer cookouts when there are a few people or for a crowd you can cook several.

This chicken isn't just for summer anymore.  My family loves it so much I make it during the winter in the oven using a rack that holds the beer can and an open roasting pan.  We've changed the seasonings to experiment & haven't had a bad combination yet.

It was really good, the chicken was really moist and tender but didn't absorb much of the flavor, as I thought it would.  Iwould reccommend rubbing some of the seasoned butter between the skin and the breast- and possibly even marinating overnight.

The most EXCELLENT whole roasted/grilled chicken I have ever had!! My family LOVED it. So juicy and moist, will never cook a whole chicken any other way from now on. I am trying to think of a way to do my Thanksgiving Turkey this way, but not sure if it will work. Please post if anyone has tried it before. Thanks Again for the most delicious chicken ever!!

This was very good, but I was not blown away by it.  I was expecting something great after reading all the reviews, but it was just good.  Very moist meat, crispy skin.  The paprika was a little overwhelming.  I used a gas grill and it only took 1.5 hours for a 4 pound bird.

This was a great recipe and when in the mood for a whole fryer chicken this is wonderful but I do tend to like the boneless and skinless better since carving can be messy. Nice in the summer. I used leftovers for chicken salad sandwiches.

We made this for our family.  The chicken actually cooked in 1 and half hours.  A meat thermometer is critical.  It also tastes great with rosemary instead of paprika.

Very moist and yummy indeed!  I was worried at first that we had to lay the chicken on its side (it wouldn't stand upright), but it still turnout out moist and delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews I decided to omit the butter altogether, so I oiled the hens, sprinkled with Cavender's Greek seasoning (salt-free/Wal-Mart carries), Fiesta Fajita seasoning (salt-free/Wal-Mart carries), and garlic salt.  To each beer I added 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and smoked them for 3 hours.  I didn’t baste at all.  The skin was crispy and the chicken was full of flavor.

This was definitely a five star recipe!  The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and flavourful, it positively just fell off the bones, yum!  I also made some minor changes:  I added some Italian seasoning to the basting mixture as well as the seasoning in the can, and I pushed some fresh herbs (thyme, sage, and rosemary) underneath the skin of the chicken.  I also found that it only took about two hours to cook thoroughly, as opposed to three.  Thanks, Barrie, for the fabulous recipe! :)

I must have done something totally wrong, the chicken was dry and all the juices that I put in the can in the beginning, stayed in the can.  I actually dumped a full can of juices out wondering why they hadn't infused into the chicken.  I am sure this is at leadt a 4 star recipie and I must have done something wrong.  I followed the direction EXACTLY.  I probably wont try this again, unless I get one of those special chicken grillers from the home depot.

This was incredible!  I am very new to barbequing in general, and had never made anything like this before. It turned out perfect - it was so easy.  Very tasty I must say. My family adored it, and I will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe!  We've been making Beer Butt Chicken for years now and prefer to marinade the chicken in some Honey Dijon 20 min. marinade.  You can also mix it in with the garlic and butter mixture for basting.  It's SUPER moist and SO YUMMY!!!!

We substituted coke for beer (there was only one beer left in the fridge and hubby didn't want to sacrifice it!).  It smelled so good cooking.  The chicken was very moist and held a lot of flavor.

I love this recipe.  The secret is to use beer - it can be n/a beer, micro beer or whatever is on sale.  I have tried it  with different liquids.  Anything of a fermented base works well.  Even wine but not as good as beer.  The malt or the hops do something to the chicken.  I also have tried a variation where the chicken is brined in a cinnamon, garlic peppercorn marinade for 24 hours. KILLER!  I put a brown sugar cayenne rub on the chicken for a beautiful color and flavor.

I cooked this chicken in the oven instead of the grill, and it was my first kitchen disaster!  I cooked it at 325, cooked a 7lb. chicken and it didn't cook all the way...The bottom was uncooked and the top was burnt.  I took it out because the temp of the breast was 175, and red juice ran out when I cut it.  I returned it to the oven, spilled some juice in the oven, filled up the house with smoke and set the smoke detectors off.  Next time, I will try a tall can of beer (I never cook less than a 7 lb chicken) and will definately try again on the grill.  The legs were dry because when I tried to turn the chicken around to cook the bottom, the legs fell off.  It was very tasty though!  Thanks for the fun!

I wasn't happy with this recipe...as it didn't lend itself to a beer substitutions.  I however, didn't want to skew the ratings since i didn't follow the recipe exactly but wanted to offer my experience.  I subbed Seirra Mist and added extra spices (cumin and curry) even with the addition of spices...the meat wasn't very flavorful but was quite moist due to the exorbent amount of butter.  The only thing i can figure is ppl are drinking more than their share of the beer and writing happy reviews.  ;)  jk.  kim

We didn't have any beer so I used Dr. Pepper. It worked great and we only used half the butter called for. I have made it twice and gotten rave reviews from all family members each time. We are taking it to grill at our friend's Forth of July party where it will be sure to be a hit!!!(I put tin foil under it for a quick and easy clean up. No mess on the grill)

I tried this recipe and fed it to my father.  He is a picky eater and enjoyed the meal greatly.  It was quick and easy to prepare.  It allowed me to spend time with my guests while preparing this meal.

It is great and everyone should give it a try.

Tender and moist chicken but considering the 2 sticks of butter used, I find this recipe a bit costly and high in calories.  Still, it was very flavorful and I used the carcass to make a spicy chicken soup.

Fun, easy, moist.  I didn't think it was that flavorful though, but I didn't use the garlic SALT, just garlic powder.

Pour out half the beer?! Are you crazy??  This is perfect for a get together with friends.  It gets everyone out on the deck to see the chicken and it leaves plenty of time to enjoy your favorite beverages.  Once again, I continue my reign as GRILL MASTER.

I used this idea to raost the chicken in the oven. I am still unclear on how the chicken is supposed to stand on its own over the beer can, but I used a roasting utensil& it worked fine. I used my own type of spices, but i have to say that this was the best roast chicken I have ever had! It was even amazing cold, I will definitely do this over & over again!

Everyone at our house loved it, even picky eaters.  It was so moist & tender, & I even let what was left of it sit out for a bit as I knew a couple of people were coming by.  They thought it was excellent!!

My chicken fell over. And I wasn't sure if the grill was open or closed. It was still yummy though.

A winner: moist, tender and flavorful. Everyone loved it. I substituted real garlic. 3 hours on Low was perfect for an 8+ lb. chicken on a Weber Genesis Silver grill. Enjoy!

Simple?..Yes.   Unorthodox?..Definetly!!   Delicious?...I thought so.  My entire family loved it, and once it's on the grill, your bird is on automatic pilot, with the exception of an occasional basting.  We'll be making it again.  In fact, the recipe's been passed to a neighbor who's making it this weekend.

ooohh man, that's good chicken.  I don't put my in a baking pan I just sit it on the grill.  Since I only use a charcoal grill (flavour, flavour, flavour) I just make sure there's no coals right under the chicken.  It cooks in 1 1/2 hour this way.

THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!The chicken was so moist and tender inside and crispy outside.  Everyone was fighting for the skin, it was so tasty!  I made it a couple of times already and for our Memorial Day cookout.  It was so easy and a great conversation piece.  My mother in law could not imagine what a beer but chicken was and laughed  but asked me for the recipe afterwards!  Everyone loved this!!!  Thank you!!! :)

This is simply one of the best grilled chicken recipes I've ever had!  I made it last night for a couple of friends and we all chuckled at the look of it on the grill! But, the laughter soon died down to some serious eating!!! Thanks for submitting it!!!

My boyfriend and I made this together and had a blast!  We only used about a teaspoon of paprika and
we used about 1/ tablespoon of Lawry's Garlic Salt. We both agree that it's the best chicken we have
ever had!  It fell right off the bone, and was juicy, and succulent!  We can't wait to grill this for 
our friends and family!  They thought we were crazy when we said we were cooking Beer Butt Chicken,
but now their curiosity is up since we did nothing but rave about it!  I can't wait to turn my 
trail-riding friends on to it.  It will be easy to make during our weekend horse-back rides, and ATV rides!

I thought it was great.  It almost tastes like rotissiere. It was very juicy and when I tell people about it they think I am crazy, sticking it up a chickens cavity.
