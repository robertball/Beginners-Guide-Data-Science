I haven't tried this particular recipe, but I made 1 similar to this- actually this recipe sounds closer w/ my substitutions than the one 1 made.....I also added a pound of fresh mushrooms sliced in half, thyme, and old bay seasoning. I omitted the potatoes- trying to do the low carb diet:) Really really good! I also added carrots chunks since I did not have any celery- I will make this often! It might also be good w/ a can of creamed corn or frozen corn it it.

Instead of flour and cornstarch, try adding gluten free Idahoan potato flakes until just shy of desired consistency as it thickens a bit more.  Also used canned milk in place of cream.

Could have used more seasoning and thickness according to my husband.  I liked it as it was.

Use No Fat Half & Half and another tablespoon of cornstarch to make it thicker.
