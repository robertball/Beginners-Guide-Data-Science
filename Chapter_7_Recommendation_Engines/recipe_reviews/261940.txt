This turned out pretty good. I did make one substitution which was to use a shredded mexi-blend instead of American slices. I was a little confused in the directions. It says to serve with tortilla chips in 2 different places yet step 3 says to layer them in the actual dip? I didn't know if that was a typo or not so I left them out and just used them to dip with. I may not have made as the recipe submitter intended but it turned out good and if I were to make this again, I'd do it the same way I did it.
