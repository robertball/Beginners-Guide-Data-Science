Pretty good and hearty soup. I added garlic and more oregano, as well as a little mozarella cheese. I served it with sour cream on top, which was delicious. A good vegetarian main or regular side dish with good taste and unique texture. May be good cold as well, I plan to try it with broccoli instead of zucchini and see how that goes.

Very good, but WAY WAY WAY too much crushed red pepper.  It totally overwhelmed the flavor.

Fabulous recipe! I love spicy food so the red pepper flakes were just my style. Anybody sensitive to spicy foods should leave the pepper flakes out.

It's a great soup! I added a dollop of sour cream with the cottage cheese. I plan to thicken it up to drizzle over steamed or cold veggies! 

I forgot...I'm on a diet, so I used Pam instead of butter. I also used just 1/4 cup of low fat cottage cheese and a small dollop of low fat sour cream.

This is really good.  I just added more spice and grated zucchini to put in the soup and make it thicker.  But nice and low cal.

I loved this soup. It can be a meal all on its own. I did add a chicken thigh and carrot to it with the broth and blended it altogether at the end.

I just tried it yesterday, really good.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable and in the beginning fried some bacon strips and then fried the onion and the rest in the oil that came out of the bacon.  Will definately do it again!

If your garden over produced zucchini you need to make this great tasting soup.  Even my husband, who doesn't like green things, liked it very much.  Maybe because it is a little spicy.

I LOVE spice, but 2 tsp of red pepper rendered the soup practically inedible.  Even with a reduced amount of red pepper, there still would have been "something" missing in the flavor.  I give this 2-stars as written; it has possibilities, but definitely needs to be doctored for more flavor.

Delicious! I also only used half the red pepper. Sour cream on top is nice but good without it too. I used 4 zucchini's - seemed to be the right amount. This is great with cheese and crackers for a light meal. Even my 1 year old enjoyed it with chunks of tofu.

This great little soup is perfect for those days when I’m eating light but still want sufficient protein. I added a teaspoon of miso to the hot soup and enjoyed fresh ground Himalayan salt on top. I backed down on the red pepper flakes by half. To make it vegan: no butter, substitute non-dairy yogurt for cottage cheese or flinders another way to make it creamy. I’ll make this again.

This is an excellent cream, however, cut the red pepper down to.....1/4 teaspoon or maybe 1/2. I even think that the author probably meant 1/2 and typed 2.  With even 1 teaspoon, the red pepper overpowers what is otherwise a wonderful cream.

Really yummy and healthy.  I took some advice from other reviews.  I cut the red peppers down to 1 teaspoon and added garlic and fresh herbs (parsley and chives).  I won't tell my hubby it has tofu in it.  You can't tell.  It's just creamy and good.

Pretty good.  The majority of my family cannot handle spice, so I (unfortunately) had to omit most of the red pepper flakes while I cooked it.  Like this, I would have only given it 3 stars.  My serving tasted MUCH better with the red pepper, so I imagine that made as directed, it would have been 4 star quality.  Served sour cream and cheese, with crackers on the side. Not bad, and a good way to use up all of the extra zucchini we have lying around.

This was a good use for zucchini from the garden. We added garlic salt, dried chilies and lots of herbs.

This was easy, tasty, and nutritious.  I like how the recipe includes good protein from tofu and cottage cheese.  I used a hand blender which made things very easy.  I also used more oregano than it called for and I skipped the red pepper since I don't like spicy food.

I like it, but the other reviews about too much spice are right.  My family, didn't go for it.  Next time, I'll use less chili.

I served this cold with a dollop of sour cream and it was delicious.  I chilled it overnight and actually liked the flavor better chilled than when it was hot.  It did need a little 'something', think I will add garlic next time also.  Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again, a nice way to use all the zuchinni in the summer.

A very good soup! Nice and tasty and full of healthy things.. I tend to agree with other raters that the red pepper is not necessary in that volume... I used half a teaspoon and it had a good kick. thanks annabanana for your yummy soup!

This soup was very good, although I messed up the recipe and had to fix it. I read the comments about using less red pepper flakes, so, luckily, I only used 1/2 tsp of *ground* red pepper! Oops, apparently it's not a 1:1 substitute for flakes, who knew?!? It was very spicy, so I added more zucchini, about 5 carrots, more than double the cottage cheese, more broth and a large chunk of Velveeta.  I cooked it all up and blended it with my immersion blender and it's really good and very creamy!

Love this soup exactly as written! We made it twice in a row using up our summer zucchini, and found it savory enough that we are going to serve it at our annual holiday dinner.

I was expecting great things from this recipe because I LOVE succhini. This recipe is ok.
