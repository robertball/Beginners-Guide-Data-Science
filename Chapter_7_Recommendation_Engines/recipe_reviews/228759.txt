I made this dip for breakfast. I used a greek vanilla yogurt, I cut the cinnamon back to a scant teaspoon (was that a typo asking for a full tablespoon?) and I served it with homemade waffle sticks, sliced apples and chunked bananas. The kids ate every bite.

W-A-A-A-Y too much cinnamon.  I agree with the other reviewers, cut back to a "maximum" of 1 tsp or less to start and adjust according to your taste preference.  Also, I think the dip's texture would be greatly enhanced by using vanilla Greek yogurt with a denser consistency, since this was a little on the runny side.

Perfect recipe for a quick fruit dip!  I got the task of making a fruit tray for my daughter's first grade class, and while most kids will eat fruit, I wanted to give them a slightly sweet tasty dip that didn't use confectioners sugar or whipped cream.  So good.  I used a half tbsp of cinnamon and local tangerine honey.  It is being served with fresh pineapple, blueberries, seedless red grapes, kiwi and strawberries.

I was looking for a dip that would be similar to the one wendy's used to serve along with their sweet potato fries. This is not it.  But it was still very good! It was a bit too much cinnamon for my tastes.  I will tone it down the next time I make this.  Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

I used a cup of Fage greek yogurt, added a scant 1/8 tsp of vanilla extract, about one tbs of Stevia In The Raw (granulated like sugar), and a heaping tsp of cinnamon and it was nom-tastic. Used it for grapes and honeydew melon but it's great to eat straight like for a flavored breakfast yogurt (so long as you use a tsp and not a tbs of cinnamon). ;)

Really good and so easy.  It's great along side sweet potato chips.  It would make a great fruit dip as well.  I'll definitely make this one again.  I didn't have honey on hand, so I substituted about 3/4 the amount of agave.  Next time I'd cut down the cinnamon a lot.  I'm wondering if the recipe intended to call for a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon.  It's still tasty, but all the cinnamon added a slightly weird texture.

I was pleasantly surprised with this dip! I wanted something that was somewhat healthy on my appetizer table for Easter.  I made this, using vanilla greek yogurt.  Like most others, I cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp. only and that was plenty.  I served this with strawberries, sliced apples, 'Nilla wafers, and graham crackers.  Everyone loved it!

Too much cinnamon? No way! This dip is packed with flavor, I'm just sad I didn't find this recipe a long time ago. I found this is great to make for parties, for a late night snack ('cause it satisfies my sweet tooth), a breakfast side, and best yet for my daughter lunch with apples! I made the recipe as written.

this was a nice way to dress up plain greek yogurt for me.. i reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp as everyone else suggested.. i didn't feel the need to add the brown sugar.. but i'm not a big sweets person anyway.. i added just a bit of vanilla extract like faithchops.. bf said it was weird but in a tasty way.. i topped with slivered almonds.. so yummy.. wish i would have had granola.. ty for the recipe

As written, I think the cinnamon would have been too much.  Like others suggested, I cut it down to 1 teaspoon, and it was fabulous!  It was a touch too sweet as well, so I may reduce the sugar/honey if I continue to use regular vanilla yogurt, although it would probably counter the greek yogurt's richness should I try that next time.  Can't wait to experiment though!  Never thought about putting these ingredients together but they were wonderful!  :)

I really want to give this 5 stars but can't because of the amount of cinnamon called for. Surely, it's too much, and I love cinnamon! I cut the recipe in half and used only 1/2 tsp. cinnamon (should have been 1.5 tsp.) However, play with the amount to suit your own taste because this cinnamon yogurt dip is delicious on fruit and makes a wonderful snack or even healthy dessert for after dinner.

I agree with some of the other reviewers... a bit on the too cinnamony side for me.  I didn't have Greek yogurt available so i did use normal yogurt.  I think i would have preferred the texture of the Greek yogurt more.  All that being said, it's a good recipe and one could manipulate it easily to your own taste buds.

This tasted okay, but I won't be making it again. I thought it had a little too much cinnamon. But my main issue was how thin and sweet it was--too much honey and brown sugar.

I followed this recipe to a tee.  I thought there was too much of a cinnamon taste and would cut it back the next time.  It also became very runny over time.  I will cut the recipe in half next time and cut way back on the cinnamon.

I made this for a fruit tray that I took to a baby shower.  It was a huge hit, and most people raved about the cinnamon in it.  One  of my friends said she would even consider sitting down with just a bowl and a spoon of it!  I'll definitely be making this dip again.

I make this with plain Greek yogurt, omit the brown sugar and increase the honey to 3 tablespoons. ALWAYS gets rave reviews with a plate of fruit.

I also used low fat Greek vanilla yogurt and cut the cinnamon down to a teaspoon. Very delicious and worked well with the apples, orange slices, red grapes and pineapple I served for a brunch.

I loved this dip! I take it in my lunch every once in a while and I love it! For an extra healthy boost I used fat free yogurt with no added sugar and it tasted just as good. I added just a little bit more honey to thicken the dip. Overall, I really love this recipe!

As written this recipe would have to be a two star, maybe even the dreaded one star because the large amount of cinnamon would be inedible to me.  I decreased the cinnamon by half (used a half tablespoon) and it was still overpowering and left an unpleasant "dry" feeling in my mouth.  I should also perhaps mention I am an avid lover of cinnamon, but not like this!  I think if I were to try this again, I would use only a teaspoon or so of cinnamon and also use greek yogurt as the regular kind was somewhat thin for a dip.

If you follow this recipe with the amount of cinnamon, you totally have added way to much, as I found out. There is soo much cinnamon in such a small batch of dip, that we found our selves saying the dip was drying our palates. I made it twice and the 2nd batch at half the required amount of cinnamon...way way much better. And enjoyable.
