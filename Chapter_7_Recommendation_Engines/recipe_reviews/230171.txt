My sons love thumbprint cookies and peanut butter so I decided to try this recipe. The dough is very dry and crumbly, chilling made it worse. I added more peanut butter by hand until the dough came together properly. Next time I would use 1 cup of peanut butter and add another egg. I used my 1 tbsp scoop and got 51 cookies that baked in 16 minutes on Silpat lined sheets. I used homemade strawberry jam as that is what we like.

I followed the recipe as is, except that I skipped the 4hr chilling step and went straight into the oven. The cookies turned out amazing!

Made these family loved them. I only changed a few things. Instead of 1/4 tsp salt I put 1/8 tsp. Only because the butter i used was salted. Made a few different kinds. Used the same dough. Rolled the dough in crushed almonds. And baked for the time it says. One batch was done with the jam. And another I added Reese cup to the center. And made some with snickers in center. My husband doesn't like jelly so did some plain Will make again

This isn't so much a review as a report of changes I made and the results in case anybody else wants to try.  Swaps: gluten free flour blend, re-hydrated PB2 and home-canned hot fudge/plum sauce instead of jam.  I needed to do some pantry use-ups as well as make this something a Celiac could safely eat.  Other than not being as pretty as the original and having so much less fat it worked out great!  Also, I tried the two-tablespoon size and that has to be a typo so I halved all the balls and it worked out fine.  Thank you for the recipe!

Dough was way too dry. Would have needed a dough hook to get it to come together. Added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter to salvage it.

Submitter here.  

 - You can swap in Wow Butter for the PB 1:1 with no real noticeable difference.  I have been making these for years until my son was diagnosed with a peanut allergy, and just tried them with wow butter and my husband has no idea.

 - a medium cookie scoop is 1.5tb (mine measured out to 2tb, I guess it's older).  that's the size the cookie dough should be.

 - Unforunately, Allrecipes doesn't give you the option of updating the picture (or responding to comments without leaving a review), but if you look for the picture posted by Grace of these cookies, that's how the cookies will look if you use the medium scoop.

Oh these are so good.  I had picked wild blackberries today and cooked them down and added sugar and vanilla to make a thick sauce.  Decided thumbprint cookies would be perfect.  And these are perfect.  I followed directions exactly.  I see others said they came out dry and crumbly and had to add more peanut butter, but my dough was super moist.  So I am not sure what went wrong for them?  Anyway super duper good and easy.  Didn't refrigerate either, works perfect.

Made the cookie part just like the recipe said.  I used black raspberry preserves for the jam.  If you like PBJ, then this cookie is the one for you!  Everyone who ate one made the "yum" sound.

Made these today after cleaning the fridge/pantry and finding 3 half-used jars of grape jelly and 2 half-used jars of peanut butter.  I did not chill the dough and they turned out fine, so that's an unnecessary step.  The direction to "Scoop dough into 2 table-spoon sized balls," I assume is a typo?  They're very good but a little on the too-sweet side for me.  I think if I make them again I may cut down on the amount of sugar.
