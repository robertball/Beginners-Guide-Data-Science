My husband and I really liked this.  I used cumin in my meat while it cooked.  I added a heaping tsp of chilli powder and Spanish paprika.  I also used black beans.

This is great for a base recipe. I used Ro Tel tomatoes with peppers and beef broth in place of plain water. I also added a few generous shakes of chili powder. It ended up being a lot more flavorful than I think it would have otherwise been.

I followed the recipe to the tee, excited to have found a new recipe to try with our annual freezer filled with venison, but when my husband took his first bite he kindly replied, "This hardly has any taste. I mean it is okay to eat, but it is really bland. Have you tasted it yet?" I was shocked as all the previous reviews said it was an excellent recipe. I took a taste and completely agreed with him. With all the ingredients in it I was amazed at the lack of taste. I used Zataran Spanish rice mix, which I feared may be too spicy, and deli style salsa not jarred. I don't know if that had anything to do with the final results. I saved the dish by adding a lot of chili powder, a good dusting of Goya seasoning and some cumin. I also mixed in a few slices American cheese till it was melted through. I hate giving a recipe such a low rating, but I cannot rate it high if the flavor is flat and bland.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did have to improvise some because my cupboard was bare! I used black beans, diced tomatoes with green chilies (yum) and creamed corn.  Otherwise, I prepared as directed.  I would say it serves a lot more than 6, though; more like 8 to 10.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I have an abundance of venison sausage - i used one link, with casing removed, and altered the spices slightly so it wouldn't be too salty or spicy.  It was hearty,  filling, and didn't break my diet.

As far as the recipe states, I give a 4. But, it easily turned to a 5 with some extra spices.  After cooking and right before the corn, I noticed it was a little bland.  As some of the others did, I added some cumin and chili powder.  This really helped, plus I added a 2nd can of tomatoes, but this time I added a can of Rotel.  (for the spice, extra tomato and extra liquid)

I made this last night with some ground venison we had lying around and it turned out delicious!  It makes a wonderfully simple dinner for those "bottom of the freezer can't make it to the store" nights lol. My only addition was to serve the portions in "cups" of fresh iceburg lettuce, with a little sour cream & salsa on top. The cold lettuce gives it this wonderfully refreshing crunch when paired with the hot meaty rice mixture. Yum yum!

The whole family enjoyed this dish!  I used white rice and rotell and it was still good!  I didn't really taste the deer, which is always a good thing!  Would definitely make this again.

Very good use of ground venison.  I also used can of Rotel as well as stewed tomatoes.  Added paprika for color, cummin, a dash of cayenne for heat.  Beef boullon for richness.  Will make again.

Made it with fresh elk. Made a double batch with home made Spanish rice. Came out excellent. Thanks for the recipe.  We go through about 300 lbs of elk and deer a year. Always looking for something different to try.

As is it is a little bland but still has a lot of potential. I added the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this website and it was delicious!!  Thank you so much for giving a good venison recipe.  It's kinda like goulash, a little bit of everything and you can't taste the venison.

I read the reviews saying it was bland, but since I was feeding a 3 and 1 year old, I left it as was. I thought it was fine. I'm always looking for a way to hide the taste of venison, since I don't like the gamey taste, and this worked.

This recipe is very tasty! I didn't have salsa on hand, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with chilies for the stewed tomatoes and added 1/2 packed of chili seasoning. We like it with sour cream and cheese on top - yum!

I played around with this and cooked the rice separately, substituted kidney with Lima beans, and added a red bell pepper. Spices added were , Tony Chacherie’s creole seasoning, cumin , ancho chili powder and cayenne pepper. There was nothing left over !!! Everyone had seconds .

I added chili powder, salt & pepper reduced the onion, increased the garlic, and tossed in some Mexican blend shredded cheese at the end. I served it with corn chip scoops and also wrapped some in a tortilla.

Recipe was good.  I added cumin, white pepper, black pepper and green chiles to the recipe.  I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to each serving and it turned out amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.  It went over with the wife, kids and even those picky in-laws

I made this for DH and DS, so this review is based on their opinions as I did not try it.  Thought it was good, but could tell that I used a ‘boxed Spanish rice mix’ rather than making homemade rice.   It was better the second day when the flavors had time to meld.

This recipe was really good! Even people who don't like venison will like this recipe. I made it for my parents and my sister, and they loved it. Very satisfying, and I will use ground beef with this recipe since I don't have any more venison.

This was tasty but I changed a few things.  I used ground bison and Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes and salsa.

My first recipe ever using Venison.  My husband, the boys and I absolutely loved this meal!  I would recommend this to everyone.  
Only thing I did differently was to omit the corn.

Very Good!! I used Rice a Roni spanish rice and had to modify a good bit. After adding everything I put in the spice packet and then covered the pot for about 20 min. It worked like a charm! The dinner had great texture, color and flavor! My 3 year old picky eater had 2 helpings! Thanks a lot, I highly recommend!!

This was fine on its own, but added to a taco salad bowl with sour cream and some other goodies, this was much better.

The recipe-changer strikes again! I had about half a pound of grilled kielbasa that I wanted to use, somehow, with a Spanish rice mix, so I gave this a try. I pan-fried the diced kielbasa with the onions and then went onto step 2. I followed that step (except for substituting a can of diced tomatoes for the stewed ones and adding a few shakes of garlic powder instead of the minced garlic). It ended up a little wet, but I'm certain that was due to my using kielbasa instead of venison. After sitting for a little bit, it sucked up most of the extra liquid. It was really good! Thanks for sharing, VTQK!
