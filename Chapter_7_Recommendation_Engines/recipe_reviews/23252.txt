Apparently these were not for us.  I didn't read the reviews before making, and I think that I should have.  I thought they were way too spicy and I honestly couldn't eat them.  They just didn't suit our tastes.  Sorry, still thank you for posting.

This recipe is a winner.  My family is fond of spicy foods and I made them in place of the usual spanish rice with our burrito dinner.  I will definitely make these again.  I used Yukon gold potatoes and substituted the onion salt for onion powder and kosher salt (what I had on hand).  They were perfect.  We had a few left over and they quickly went the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are really good - but my daughter found them to be too spicy. I used onion powder instead of onion salt (only b/c if salt is needed - I let us add to our individual servings) and I stirred the oil/spices in the shallow casserole dish I used until all the potatoes were coated well before popping this in the oven.  Went great with our pork dinner and I'll make this again - perhaps playing with the amt of spices a tad until my daughter's tastebuds can handle this spicier sidedish. Thanks a bunch Krista!

Yum.  I loved this recipe.  My husband supposedly doesn't like red potatoes, but he couldn't get enough of these.  I changed the recipe a bit by mixing the oil and spices and then coating the boiled potatoes in the mixture before roasting.

Spicy (even for my stepson) so knocking down the "hot" level a few notches. Otherwise, we all had seconds because we wanted to not because we had to eat the dish or throw it out. Not bad.

My husband and I both really enjoyed these potatoes. The spices were perfect. We dipped them in a buttermilk ranch dressing. Also, we paired these potatoes with Candied Salmon (this recipe can be found on this website) because they go well with the sweetness on the salmon. Thank you!

Great spices in this recipe. My time saving change worked nicely. I didn't par boil them as it was another pot to wash. My coated potatoes were baked on a foil lined baking sheet, using a 425 oven (rather than 350) for 20 minutes, then I turned and baked another 10 minutes. The higher heat crisps and browns the outsides allowing the inside to remain soft. Perfect!!  Some were saying it was too spicy. I suggest leaving out the cayenne. Again, great spices.

Very tasty. I added some chopped onion to the potatoes.  For those that these were too spicy cut back on the spices up front.  You can always add as you serve them.  Unlike baking cooking is not an exact science i.e. you can adjust the ingredients to suit your tastes/.

We thought these were great. I used this seasoning mix but not this method of cooking because it seemed like more hassle than my usual way. (Bag the cut up raw potatoes with the oil and seasonings, dump the bag onto a baking sheet, roast at 400 degrees for 50 minutes or until tender). I did add dehydrated onion to the mixture because I never miss a chance to add those. This was pretty spicy, very tasty, but I have a decent tolerance for heat and I did find myself being very glad my main dish had a cooling property! Thanks for the recipe, we'll use this again :)

I like spicy stuff, but this just really wasn't the best to me.  Unlike others, I had no problem with the level of cayenne & chili powder -- I think it was more the paprika.  Not that I would have said this myself, but somehow I understand L Deville's comment that they were way too spicy but at the same time bland.  Like somehow the combo didn't come together and make a good flavor or something.  I love potatoes and have made a lot of different potato dishes, and sorry, but there's just other things I'd rather make - this was just OK.

My children thought these were too spicy (although they are not potato fans anyway, so who knows, they might not even have eaten them with less spice), but my husband *loved* them.  I thought they were great too.  I did substitute one tsp Italian seasoning for the parsley, since I didn't have any dried parsley on hand.  I will definitely be making these again, thanks!

The cayenne pepper overpowers all the other spices, and make these potatoes inedible.

We liked these! I cooked them differently-raw, cubed red potatoes convection roasted @ 450' for 20 min. Reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. and next time it will be 1/8 tsp. I also reduced the chili powder to 1/2 tsp. and that was just about the right amt. They cooked up perfectly brown and crunchy. Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this recipe was really good, I doubled the amount as we're a big family.  I can understand some reviewers comments mentioning that the potatoes are REALLY hot, and you're probably going to enjoy them once they cool down for a few minutes after coming out of the oven.

Made this as-written: very yummy! I crave a lot of spice and flavor in my food, and this combination of spices works quite well. The spice mix is fairly flexible, and I'm looking forward to experimenting to give the potatoes different kinds of flavors.

Very good and easy. After reading reviews I cut the Cayenne in half and didn't find it spicy at all, next time I'll try it as written. I also didn't have onion salt so I used garlic salt in place of garlic powder and onion powder in place of onion salt, otherwise exactly as written and they were great!

These were really good, although i didn't use them as a side dish. With the reviews stating that they were really spicy, i followed the seasoning portion exactly , but i used regular potatoes. When they were done, i covered them in a layer of shredded chedder and smothered them with Chili and then another layer of cheese. With this combination it was really good. My hubby went back for seconds then finished mine. Thanks

It was a nice spice blend for sure.  I LOVE spicy spicy spicy foods so for me, I really didn't think it was even all that spicy.  But it was nice.  I think I'll change it up next time for myself.

I just zapped the potatoes in the microwave for 4 minutes. Threw the spices in a plastic bag and shook...sprayed the baking pan with olive oil...put the potatoes in the pan and sprayed them with olive oil...saved pans and oil.....this recipe is for anyone who likes food with a kick! Thank You!

My husband loved these and he's not a potato person at all, so that says alot. They were a tad too spicy for me so I will halve the cayenne pepper and chili powder next time I make these.

These potatoes were great, the spices were really nice and flavourful. Althought the potatoes didn't crisp up well for me, so I'd recommend an increase in temp near the end to brown them up a bit more. Other than that great recipe!

This was wonderful. I made it with our meat loaf. I had to make two different batches. One for myself as I love spicy food and One for the rest of the family. I cut the spices in half they loved it. Thanks so much for the great recipe. It is a huge success.

Due to the other reviewers comments I used half the amount of spices and they were still pretty spicy for our taste.  Okay flavor.  I won't be making these again.

I used baking potatoes and skipped the par-boil step, baking at 325 for about 1-hr.  Then I turned up the heat to 400 for 15-min to get the crispy outside. Not too spicy, but rather too oily! Great for breakfast with salsa and a dash of sour cream.

I liked these but, those who don't like spicy food should avoid them.  I doubled the spices in the recipe.  They were good, but time consuming to make.  Mine didn't get crispy as mentioned in the recipe but, still something I'll make again but, a little milder for those at home that are faint of taste buds.

The potatoes didn't crisp up enough for us (I had to remove the dish from the oven when the herbs and spices started to turn black).  But the flavor was really good.  Definitely spicy!

We like spicey foods so the heat issue was fine for us. Kids and hubby thought these were really good, however, the next time I make them I'm going to add parm cheese to the mixture and just eliminate the salt. Thanks Krista!
