This recipe is so versatile. Not fancy but very tasty! I've also made it with ground sausage (breakfast, and sweet italian). I like to add a bit (1 tsp?) chili powder, and fresh 2 cloves garlic when cooking the meat. I cook the noodles almost as directed but I generally don't add much water, actually usually use beef or veggie broth. Use enough liquid to barely cover and with a little creative poking you can get all the noodles in the liquid. I then cover with foil (or lid) and bake about 30-40 minutes. I also mix half the cheese in the mixture and sprinkle the remaining on top toward the end. My children HATE orange cheese so I general end up using mozzerella unless I luck out and find white cheddar. I use whole wheat elbow noodles and low fat cheese to make this a nice healthy meal.

My husband and I really liked this, although my picky three-year-old did not.  I added a little garlic powder and some italian seasoning for extra flavor.  Next time, I think I'll use a little more beef, a little more corn, and a little less noodles.  I'm also going to try cooking the noodles separately, then adding them to the mix when it's time to transfer it to the baking dish; it seems you throw out a lot of flavoring with the excess water you have to drain after cooking the noodles as described in the recipe.  I wonder how this would be using Mexican stewed tomatoes and adding a little taco seasoning to the beef.  It seems there are endless ways to "tweak" this to suit your family's tastes.  Thanks a bunch, Dawn and Dawn's grandma!

I loved this and I was actually how great it was! It seems too simple! I did some small variations so I could use up some ingredients I already had on hand. Here's what I did...used ground turkey instead of beef, added 1 clove minced garlic, a can of tomato sauce, deiced tomatoes instead of stewed, celery salt, pepper & also cooked the noodles on the side. Next time I think  I will ad the corn & black olives though.

Dawn, I can't thank you enough! My Grandma used to make this huge family favorite and the recipe was lost.  She used to call it "Idiot's Delight" because she could never figure out what the fuss was about.  It was always a hit at pot-luck parties and with the family.  We add garlic and sliced black olives and we cook the noodles separately (so as not to loose the seasoning).  My Dad will be thrilled when I surprise him with this at Sunday dinner!

My family liked this dish and it was pretty simple to make.  I cut down on the salt and pepper, added some black olives, and took out the corn.  I followed some reviewer's suggestion to cook the noodles separately so as to keep much of the sauce.

I used kluski noodles (all I had @ the time )precooked them, combined everything ,adding a little crushed garlic , and running short on time , stirred in the cheese & finished heating on the stove top . I wasnt real impressed with the appearance but found it tasted better than I expected ,however my picky husband & 5 boys loved it ! They gave it the 5 star rating , mine would be a 4 . Next time I will try Rotel tomatoes or maybe just diced tomatoes with jalapenos . I've promised to make it again .

This meal was EXCELLENT!! Thank you Dawn.  I served it with garlic toast. I will use it forever.  I added more seasonings: seasoning salt (instead of regular salt), onion powder, Italian seasonings, garlic powder and a lot more cheese on top.  It was delicious.

Good casserole dish; easy to fix and get on with other things.  Somewhat dry, but maybe I cooked it a bit longer than needed.  Next time I might add a small can of tomato sauce and some italian seasoning....it wasn't quite as 'saucy' as I thought it might be.  But it sure made alot!! Enough for dinner for three...and leftovers for lunch twice!

This is a great base recipe to use up odds and ends in your fridge. I added mushrooms, carrots, and peppers. Also added some sour cream to the sauce before baking. Followed advice of reviewers and parboiled the egg noodles so they didn't get mushy and only added a small amount of beef broth instead of water. Loved the corn in this. If I make this again I will make it the same way but add the optional black olives if I have them on hand. Served with a green salad with creamy Italian dressing and garlic bread. Great comfort food for a cold autumn evening!

I did a combination of this and the "Husband's delight" dish also posted here.  I added 16 oz of sour cream, and about 5 oz of cream cheese, 1 can of diced tomaotes. I also added bell pepper, minced garlic, and chili powder.  I boiled the noodles separately and then mixed everything together and poured into a casserol dish and baked for 30 min.  I will use taco seasoning next time.  I may also try this with left over chicken one night.  The family loved it and scarfed up the left overs right quick.  Thahks for sharing.

This has become a family favourite!  I add fresh chopped garlic and a diced carrot.  For full flavour DEFINITELY cook the noodles SEPARATELY, and don't add water! In a hurry I skip the oven part; I just stir the noodles into the sauce and serve with grated cheese on top.  This is excellent for camping or hiking - make the sauce ahead and freeze; cook the noodles on the camping stove & stir the sauce in; serve with cheese.  (It even tastes good with instant noodles!)

The recipe was so easy. My husband loved it, said that it reminded him of fond childhood home-cooked meals.  We also cooked the noodles first, but next time I might add a bit of tomato sauce because ours ended up a bit dry.

I didn't like this dish at all.  The uncooked noodles turned to mush when baked.  With all of the great ingredients it should have been wondnerful.  My husband tried but couldn't eat it.  It might have been better if the noodles were cooked.

I made this last night for a covered dish dinner and it was a hit.  Next time I am going to bake it for only 20 minutes or less.  It seemed to be a little dry.  I did take the advice and cook the noodles seperately.  Will definately serve this again!

This was OK for us. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I thought 1 tablespoon of salt seemed like way too much so I only used 1 teaspoon and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. We thought it was more then enough of each. I used a 13 ounce box of dreamfield pasta. I added two cups of water and two cups of beef broth and I didn't drain it. We all ate it but it isn't something I would make again.

Sorry, but I didn't think this recipe was all that. It is a very average casserole dish. Nothing special, very forgettable. I won't make it again.

Made this for a "test kitchen" project with my seniors class. They LOVED it! This was easy to make and delicious. Could be used in a commercial kitchen easily. Does anyone know the history of this recipe?

A pretty good meal to throw together quickly on a busy night.  I added fresh minced garlic to the meat, cooked the noodles separately and then combined and put in the oven.  It was pretty good, but a little peppery for my taste.  Will reduce the salt and pepper next time.

Like some other reviewers, I didn't taste what all the fuss was about.  It was simple and quick, but pretty bland.  It needs a lot of seasoning or something to bring it up a notch.

I took others suggestions and cut way back on the salt. I added garlic to the meat while frying for extra flavor. I also cooked the noodles separately so I would not have to add water to decrease the flavor in this dish. While it is a fairly decent casserole there are better ones on this site that are similar.

This recipe is plain, but very versatile.  Easy to see how you can change it up any way you want.  We used pasta, not noodles. Only a 3 star rating as I have other "basic" cassarole recipes that are more flavorful.

This dish was made all the time when i was a kid.  Although we had a few changed made to it over time that proved to be tasty.  instead of frozen cord, we used can corn with the juice. Added 1 can medium Black olives - sliced, 1 medium sized green pepper-chopped, and cooked the egg noddle separately and cooked for 1hour in oven.  The only thing that was cooked on the stove was the ground beef.

I gave it a five because I adjusted it from the original with the guidance from other reviewers. I did cook the noodles ahead of time to save the broth; added a layer of sliced green olives under the cheese, which I doubled to two cups and I used canned whole kernel as I didn't have frozen.It turned out really scrumptious on the first day and increasingly so every day thereafter.
   A real keeper. Thanx, Dawn...

I decided to make this recipe more Mexican by adding a little chili powder, garlic, black olives, and a can of green chilis.  I did pre-cook the pasta, but next time may try adding some extra liquid and cooking it in the pan with the meat.  Over all, this was an easy and tasty dish that is easy to tailor to your family's preferences.  It really is worth a try.

I thought this recipe was overly salty. I did add the layer of sliced green olives on top. My boyfriend liked it though. I thought that I might try it again; only I would use less salt, add some basil or other seasonings, and maybe use black olives and mushrooms instead of the sliced green olives.

This recipe was good, but the noodles were too mushy for me. I like mine al dente. SO next time I will cook pasta instead of noodles so they don't overcook in oven.

I am sorry to say--I thought this dish was awful. The only thing I enjoyed were the olives and cheese on the top. My egg noodles turned to mush and the dish was just disgusting. My husband is very kind and still ate some, but I will not be making this again. I will however use the olive trick--that is very tasty. :)

I did not care for this recipe, but my husband liked it so it gets three stars.  I think the recipe was good for what it was - I just did not like the corn with the egg noodles.

This recipe was a little bland.  My husband spiced it up with habenaro pepper sauce.  I thought using slice american cheese might also give it some more flavor and maybe even using mixed veggies instead of just corn.
