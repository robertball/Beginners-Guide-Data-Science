My ten year old daughter thinks it's not Christmas without Spinach Balls.  My original recipe called for a dash of fresh cayanne pepper which is very tasty with the combination of flavors.  I always have to double this recipe and this year I should have tripled it.  I had a lot of visitors this holiday season and even those that don't care for spinach tried and liked this appetizer.  I baked these for 13 minutes; cooled completely; stored in an air tight container and refrigerated.  When I wanted to serve, I baked spinach balls on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 350 and served warm.  Perfect!

I have made these for years and they are always a big hit! These can be prepared days ahead and frozen. On the day of your party, just pull them out of the freezer and bake. I freeze them in the aluminum foil type pans, so they are ready to go right in the oven.

Yum! These are similar to the breaded spinach bites I got from Costco but with WAY less sodium. I just made my own bread crumbs from the heels of whole grain bread and added extra dried oregano & basil. I also added a handful of toasted and ground pecans which gave a nice flavor and some extra protein. I used less melted butter and added some olive oil instead. Next time I will throw in a handful of wheat germ also. I used them as faux meatballs with spaghetti. I will make these again!

These freeze beautifully before they are baked to have on hand as needed. Just thaw for 30 minutes and bake as directed. 
I have always doubled the recipe but only use 3/4 cup butter rather than a full cup.

I added onion and 1/2 parmesian, 1/2 feta cheese. They were delicious! Even people who don't normally like spinach enjoyed them.

Had lost my original recipe for Spinach Balls and made this recipe for a wedding this past weekend.  I was in Oklahoma and many thought they were sausage balls. However, they were a big hit!  I didn't change any of the ingredients.

I strongly agree with the previous 5* ratings.  

FYI:  For 150 people, we made the used 12 boxes of spinach.  Definitely plan on 3 bites per person, many had more.  We made them on Wednesday, cooled and stored them in large zip lock bags. We thawed and reheated them for the wedding on Saturday night. No problem!!

Delish!!!  I like making these with other cheeses like cheddar and mozzarella too.  I put all the ingredients into the food processor and whir them together - super fast, super easy, and super yummy!

Good but was lacking something.  I altered recipe to include 1/2 chopped and saut√©ed onion, dash cayenne pepper, 1 clove of minced garlic and 1/2 cup of feta cheese.  Took the recipe to 5 stars then.  I served with another reviewers suggestion of: mustard sauce    1/2 c sour cream, 1 tsp yellow mustard, dash of worcestershire and 1 tsp soy sauce.  Good.

I make this recipe all the time.  Today I used the mix to stuff mini pumpkins.  Baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  It turned out great and looked amazing.  I added the picture.

This recipe is very forgiving.  Realized I had no spinach, so I subsituted frozen broccoli instead.  So good!  I recommend making the balls bigger though, the small ones come out too crispy.  Will make again and try with fresh broccoli.

Made a healthy version:

1 10oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach thawed and drained
2 cups of Italian Style Panko
3/4 cup of reduced fat Sharp Cheddar Cheese
2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp Italian Seasoning
2 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 Eggs
2 tbsp of Bragg's Amino Acid (or Tamari)

This was so delicious without the butter and the panko is made with wheat flour instead of white!

I have made these before, and really liked them.  I think the problem some people are having is using breadcrumbs instead of stuffing mix.  I think the breadcrumbs compact too much, and when I use stuffing mix, I actually use the 1 cup of water and make the stuffing.  My spinach balls are tender and soft, and absolutely delicious.  I also tweak the recipe, and add different cheeses etc. I DO NOT add any butter or oil, and they are fine.  I use a one inch ice cream scoop and it works perfectly for the 20 minutes at 350, and use silicone aluminum foil, so they do not stick. I also have made broccoli balls, and they are great too.  Am now thinking about cauliflower balls, lord help me.

I made these last night, but I had to adjust the recipe quiet a bit. First I scaled the recipe to make about 30 spinach balls. I used three 10 oz packages of spinach. About 2 cups of Italian bread crumbs instead of the 5 cups it said. I also adjusted the butter and eggs. Otherwise it would have been too mushy. Even with less butter it still was a bit too much. The way I made them they turned out perfect. The prep and cooking time was longer though. I put the spinach in the toaster oven to dry it out easier and I ended up baking these for about 30 minutes instead of 20. This recipe is a good guide though.

Wow! I had never heard of spinach balls, but had to use up some fresh spinach, so I thought I would try these. These are really good! I didn't have stuffing, so I used italian style bread crumbs. I added garlic and white onion cooked in EVOO, then added the spinach in and added just 2 tbsp of butter at the end, then added to the dry ingredients, plus a little cayenne. I used shredded parmesan (didn't have any grated) and the result was sooo yummy. Even my super picky 5 year old, and my non-spinach loving hubby liked them! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I found these quite bland - definitely use sharp cheese and don't be afraid to spice them up a bit more - I'll put in crushed garlic and a heap more herbs next time.

I made these twice over the Mardi Gras season, the first time using co-workers as my testers and next for a Lundi Gras party with minor changes. The first batch dripped butter after baking, but co-workers loved them. I thought it wouldn't hurt to reduce the butter to about 2 tablespoons. Then I added about a half cup of finely chopped walnuts (I like crunch!). Pecans or pine nuts would be good too. Shorter baking time - about 12 to 15 minutes - less butter and the addition of nuts really enhanced the balls. I also made them a little smaller - about 3/4" in diameter, and got about 4 dozen. My friend's husband had the leftovers over spaghetti sauce and loved them even more! Thanks!

Fantastic however that is my opinion.  For  whatever strange reason was not a hit with my extended family when I made them a few Christmas's in a row!!   Try dipping them in a little green Tabasco sauce for a kick.   My opinion is they are Super tasty & very easy.  Definately Superior to the breadcrumb version on this site.  I think my family who didn't like them are nuts.

LOVE these!! I followed the recipe exact and they're just delicious.  Everyone liked them but my son & I really loved them and (DON'T TELL HIM) he hates stuffing, he hasn't had any of any kind in years - he's refused to eat any since he was little so needless to say I didn't tell him that these are made with stuffing mix lol and he said quote "the spinach balls were a lot better than I thought they would be!" I'm so happy about that - we'll definitely have these regularly :)

These are PERFECT for Thanksgiving and Christmas appetizers, we make them every year! My personal recipe, which I got from somewhere else, requires 2 packages of spinach and also half of an onion, chopped. I think that helps with the dryness. Also substituted garlic salt for powder, and made them even tastier!

These are fantastic!  I brought them to a party, and people loved them!  I think I'll try subbing some of the bread crumbs with ground oatmeal, and using some olive oil in place of some of the butter.

Wow!  I just made them and followed the recipe almost exactly, except for putting in slightly less butter.  I am typing this as my two kids, ages 2 and 4, are stuffing their mouths.  Phenomenal!  My kids haven't touched spinach for quite some time.  I love this recipe, it's a keeper!!!  UPDATED:  Spinach-hating hubby loved it too!

I have been making this recipe for years. I freeze them in a container lined with wax paper and bake when needed. I keep them on hand for last minute party guests. These always go quickly even with the youngsters.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep them warm after you remove them from the oven.  They became cold very quickly.

These were delicious!! I added a lot more cheese.  Any kind of cheese can be used.  Served with a spicy marinara sauce.  Will def be making again!

These are a great nutritious snack to have on hand or for a party. Instead of stuffing I used what I had, which meant a mix of quinoa, chopped walnuts, and breadcrumbs. And cheddar cheese instead of parm. They're like spinach cookies haha!

These are easy and outstanding!  Now if you want to take it into another stratosphere, serve with this easy but AMAZING sauce (so not kidding) that I found when making appetizers for our NY eve party:  http://hostthetoast.com/crab-cakes/#comment-191639

These were good, these were okay, nothing too spectacular.  I followed the recipe except I added more spices to try and get more flavor into these balls.  I baked for 17 mins.  I served with a marinara sauce.  Again, these were good, just don't expect greatness.

If you chop the spinach up really really fine in the food processer, they look much better when they are done baking.  They are best dipped in marinara sauce. Super good!

Absolutely delectable!!! I make these for every party and they are gone in seconds.  I have had to photocopy the recipe a million times for friends.  Preparation is quick and easy and most people have the ingredients on hand.  It's just a great recipe.

Very good! I have friends that don't eat meat and I have been looking for a good appetizer for them and this turned out PERFECT!  I froze the left overs and reheated them a week later and they were still very good!  I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Deliciously moist. My 3 year old just entered the "veggies are yucky" phase and these fooled her into thinking that they're regular meatballs. I melted some mozzarella on top and she loved it.

Wow!  These exceeded my expectations by far!  I made them to add a vegetarian option for a party, and they ended up being the most popular dish of all.  So quick and easy to mix in the stand mixer, then portioned out with a cookie scoop.  These are going to become a standard for us...and I didn't change the recipe a bit.  Thanks for sharing!!!

super easy! you can keep ingredients on hand so you can make as a last minute appetizer  (or even side dish)

mine came out a little dry. I think I let them cook to long (25 mins) because they didn't look golden. but I fixed it by dipping them in pizza sauce (or marinara). 

I think this could be really good as an appetizer or as a side dish with pasta (in place of garlic bread) 

good as is but now that I have tried it I can see how the other suggestions  with cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper would be delicious  too

Watch out - these little guys are lethal.

My husband came home late from a flight and he ended up eating half the batch, just standing and chatting.  I've started the second go-around now.  

I used fresh spinach on hand, boiled it down.  I'd use some Pam spray on the pan, they sorta stuck.

Dipped in homemade marinara sauce - yum!!!!

I was looking for vegetarian appetizers and found this.  They were very good.  I sub-ed a can of artichoke hearts for one of the packages of spinach. (Just because) Just drained and chopped them. Also saut√©ed onions and garlic in the butter.  And used bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix, so I upped the Italian seasoning a bit.  Served with Marinara sauce and there were none left!

Made this as an hors d'oeuvre for Thanksgiving and they flew off the plate. I took the advice of some reviewers and added a pinch of cayenne.  Served with marinara sauce for dipping.  This recipe is a winner!

I make these all the time and almost never get any because they are gone before I have a chance. The only thing I do different is season the mixture with minced garlic, garlic powder pepper. I also sautee bacon and onions then mix them in the mixture. It comes out awesome. One time I also added ground beef and that turned out well too.

This recipe isn't bad, but it was better when I made the changes recommended by previous posters. I reduced the garlic and the butter, just slightly; but I increased the spinach to 12 oz. I also added one third of an onion, diced and saut√©ed. They were great!

I *love* this recipe.  This is a very easy recipe to bring to holidays or office parties.  They're almost as good cold as they were warm.  They go great with a rich sauce or dip like a hollendaise as well.  Next time I'm adding some chopped up broccoli form a little more texture.  Delicious.

I doubled the recipe and I debated about the amount of bread crumbs and I was right, 4cups was way too much.  So watch out even on doing it single.

I used fresh spinach and a food processor just on pulse / chop. Baked the balls as a side to my tilapia dish. Everyone loves them! So simple!

My spinach balls were too moist and tasted heavy with butter. I first measured out my stuffing to 2 cups BEFORE crushing them so I might have had too little stuffing to soak up the butter. Still delicious however. Served it with marinara sauce. Added 2 teaspoons of chili flakes b/c I like things hot.

I was looking for a vegetarian app and am so glad I found these.  They flew off the plate at the party I attended!  The only adjustment I made was adding about a quarter of an onion, sauteed. I make them often now due to request.  Dee-licious!

Love this idea! I turned this into my new favorite veggie burger to pack for my work lunches.  I used my food processor to speed up prep time.  I don't buy stuffing mix so I started with a few slices of whole wheat bread, then added a tsp of poultry seasoning, threw in a small onion, used fresh garlic, and omitted the butter altogether.  Made 4 large patties out of this, and topped it with a little mayo and spicy mustard on a whole wheat bagel.

I just love these. I basically made them the same except I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and didnt add the Italian seasoning. I kept them after cooking in the fridge. I am a vegetarian and I found the consistency of these remarkably like meatballs I had while growing up. So I tried a batch using basil, oregano, and marjoram. I cooked up some pasta about a day later (because the consistency of meatballs comes after a day or so in the refrigerator) and used these as meatballs. I no longer miss meatballs with my pasta. They were fantastic. So from now on along with the forty I make that are a little over an inch in diameter, I will make some larger ones, maybe twenty or thirty, for meatballs. Thank you for this recipe that I will be sharing with friends. I know even my non vegetarian friends and relatives will enjoy them.

I was very disappointed with these. I love spinach and I love stuffing, but these were not enjoyable.  I was looking for a fun way to add veggies to my family's diet, but these struck out with everyone.  Just not tasty.

Super easy & very good...but using that much butter and the high sodium kind of negates the healthy spinach.  If I were to make them again I'd use 2 packs of spinach & cut the butter to 1/4 cup.  They are dry, so marinara sauce is a plus.

Made these for Christmas eve and they were great...fastest thing to go by far.  I made them exactly as the recipe calls for, and served them with hot marinara sauce, which I think was a good touch.

Wonderful recipe...very similar to my grandma's.  I would recommend using unseasoned stuffing mix or omitting Italian seasoning...it can be a bit overpowering.  Great way to get kids to eat spinach, my 5yr old loves them.  Also great for vegetarians...use as a replacement for meatballs in spaghetti :)

Not very spinachy tasting.  Bland.  And very dry (even though I took them out of the oven prior to the 20 minutes listed in the directions).

If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would. These were just a little dry for my taste. I think if I made them again I would reduce the amount of stuffing.

The taste was pretty good, but no other family member wanted them.  They smelled great cooking, but definitely cooled off too quickly for my little ones.  They wouldn't touch them unless they were warm.  I tried them because I needed some vegetarian apt. for Thanksgiving...will keep looking.

My Gram always makes these for christmas and thanksgiving. I made them to take to a picnic this summer. Everyone thought they were delicious (even the kids). I enjoy any way to get the kids to eat spinach. Also they were good for a picnic because leaving them sit out for the afternoon didn't affect them at all.

Loved these, so easy to make and very tasty. Followed recipe exactly and came out with perfect results. Used a small cookie scoop to make the spinach balls. My family and company raved over these little appys. Perfect to make up, freeze and store in a zip lock bag and cook when you want. Will make again. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

These are an excellent appetizer for any event. I love making them when it's convenient and then popping them in the freezer in a plastic bag. I pull out as many or as few as I need to serve myself or guests.

oh my gosh...these were such a big hit. I cut the recipe in half to start off. I did make some changes though, which i thought would be for the best. I used hard crutons instead of stuffing mix, cheese & garlic and restaurant style---3:1 ratio. I also put in  handful of pine nuts for some added protein, since we're vegetarian. hmm i think that was it...oh yeah i flipped em half way through. They were great by themselves and with spaghetti noodles and sauce. YUMMY will do again real soon!!!

I liked these, although bf didn't, so I'll give them a 3 to be fair.  I had about 2/3 cup of butter so I just used that.  I also used about 1/2 cup less of the stuffing mix, although I didn't use stuffing mix--used seasoned breadcrumbs that I had.  I mixed the breadcrumbs in  a 1/2 c at a time until it seemed the right consistency.  I also used fresh spinach, as I didn't have frozen, and I think that might have changed the amount of breadcrumbs needed since fresh is much less wet that frozen. I used the food processor to cut up the spinach so that it was cut very finely.   Mine were perfect at 20 minutes in the oven.

I was pleasantly surprised by these!  I really just wanted to use up some stuffing mix but these were so easy and tasted really good, considering the simple ingredients! I let the stuffing mix soak in the beaten egg (used egg substitute, actually) until it was mushy, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I think that might have helped them stay moist.  I used melted non-hydrogenated butter spread to make it a little healthier, and fresh spinach.   If you do use fresh, make sure to chop it very finely or else you'll end up with ugly spinach balls - next time I might even whip it up a bit in the food processor.

I tested these out on my picky 8-year-old (who refuses to eat meat) and her two friends.  They looked at them kind of funny at first, but then grabbed them and ran outside.  Five minutes later they came running in for more.  Next time I might use unsalted butter to cut down on sodium.

Very easy and tasty! I added mushrooms and cayenne pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I served them over spaghetti with marinara sauce for a simple, fast dinner.

Wonderful! I made these as a side dish for dinner today following the recipe exactly, only cutting back a bit on the bread crumbs. My husband flipped for these and between the two of us, we ate all but three of them! I am going to love adding these to my menu as an appetizer for my next party!

This is one of my favorite snacks! I used a combo of fresh/frozen spinach. I prefer less breading, so I ended up picked a lot of it out and throwing it away. But the flavors are great. Excellent substitute for french fries or other starchy foods. Thanks!

They tasted good, had good potential, but were dry.  Probably won't make again unless I can come up with a way to make them a bit more moist.

I didn't care for these.  The flavor of the stuffing mix overpowered the spinach -- couldn't even taste the spinach. 2 cups of crushed stuffing mix is way too much - maybe should have been 2 cups measured out THEN crushed??  These just tasted like stuffing balls.  I may try again but use entire 16 oz bag of spinach and measure the 2 cups of stuffing then crush. I gave it 2 stars because my husband liked them.

I have also made these for years, and they are always popular.  I recommend a tangy sauce to dip them in-- I have used a dijon sauce and a mustardcranberry sauce that both went very well with the spinach balls.

I made this to take to a dinner party. Everyone loved them until I told them they were made with spinach. Even though they "hated" spinach, they loved these balls. They disappeared quickly and quite a few even asked for the recipe!

I love to cook. I had to check the recipe a few times to see if I did something wrong.  I baked for the amount of time in recipe.They were hard and I ended up tossing them. I was supposed to bring to a party . very disappointed.

They were very well received. I have someone in the family who doesn't like cheese, so I subbed silken tofu, added a little salt for flavor, and it worked just fine.

I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix. They turned out really good but I did have to cook them about 10 more minutes to get them to brown a little. I will make them again and try the stuffing mix instead.

There seemed to be too  much bread crumbs for me.  Later saw parmesan spinach ball recipe on your site with 2 cups of bread crumbs to two boxes of spinach rather than one box.  Will try that one next time.

These are so yummy! And I feel healthy eating them! I was able to make them GlutenFree for someone who has Celiacs Disease. I just made sure the Parmesan cheese was GF, the bacon GF, and use a GF stuffing mix, or crumble your own GF bread loaf (that's what I did). They taste the same! I have made them both ways. My mother used to make them for Christmas and I ate so many! My all time favorite appetizer or snack!

I always use the ingredients as stated but added more Parmesan cheese and parsley flakes. Also added a little more garlic and some Mrs. Dash seasoning as a personal touch. I was able to make 12 medium large balls. They were all gone within 15 minutes of making them. :) Family and friends LOVE them! Definitely a keeper!

These were great, everyone loved them and couldn't stop eating them!  Great appetizer for being on a boat.

 The first time I made them, I got 30 from this recipe and the second time I actually was able to get 60!  

Also, I used the entire package of 16 ounce package of frozen spinach (that was all they had in my supermarket). 

They were delicious, great warm or room temperature.  Next time I may add some shredded mozzarella, also.

***Update - I have made these with the mozzarella, both alone and mixed with the Parmesan cheese.  SO GOOD!!

Novice cook and first time making these, so probably wouldn't be the best anyways. 

It was really delicious. A little too salty for my taste, but that varies from person to person (my friends all loved them).

I found that if you don't bake them long enough they fall apart really easily and if you bake them enough so they don't fall apart the outside is a little too crunchy.  

I found putting the mix in the fridge or freezer helped a lot before rolling them into balls. When I didn't do that I had a hard time getting them to form and not mush out of my hands. 

Changes I want to make in the future:

-a little less garlic powder/salt
-freeze before rolling balls
-more spinach

Made recipe as written and they ended up being too salty for my tastes, I'm assuming it was the stuffing mix crumbs.  May try again with some Italian style panko breadcrumbs.

These are awesome!  I tripled the recipe for a party, made the mixture in the morning and baked them in the afternoon and they were wonderful!  If time allows, make the mixture in advance.  It gives the ingredients time to soak and soften, and makes it easier to shape into balls and stay together during  baking.  I used a combination of parmesan mozzarella cheese  and added some diced onion.  I used 2 tsp. of garlic powder for a triple recipe since I was adding the onion.  They were really buttery, so I  may decrease the butter next time by a stick.

Fantastic--even my teen and tween girls ate it and they avoid spinach like homework...!  I did add a bit of cayenne, just because I love it in everything.  Thanks so much.

I have made these as is which is a five!  Now for playing... I substituted spinach for frozen kale and used stove top stuffing.  Took out the butter and added 2tbsp of olive oil then a pound of ground chicken. These were good as well! This recipe as written is awesome and it also leaves room for a cook to play. Thank you for submitting it!!

Very good results!!  I'm rating 4 stars bc next time I'd punch up with more spices, probably cayenne as others have suggested.  In my first batch I did a few substitutions: fresh spinach (turned out great), I cut out 3 tbsp of butter and used olive oil instead (this was slightly challenging and required adding in extra olive oil later to congeal the balls), and I sauted finely chopped onion with garlic in place of garlic powder (delicious).

My friends didn't like this at all, neither do I.  We are a healthy bunch, with me on the fringes (I give in to fried food every now and then).  I don't think I'll even try it a second time with different recipe, it just didn't go over well enough.

Not having stuffing mix on hand, I used Italian bread crumbs instead.  Also used liquid eggs and low fat butter (made with yogurt) to lower the cholesterol and fat even more. And for a kick, added some sliced almonds. The spinach balls were delish!  I can see trying this recipe using cooked flavored quinoa as well.

SO good! These are quite heavy so beware but absolutely tasty. I served them at a fondue party and they went over great! I think a spicy sour-cream based dip would be great with these.

I made this with fresh garden spinach and unseasoned bread crumbs. I used fresh herbs from the garden (basil, rosemary, thyme & oregano) and blended them with the eggs and butter in our nutri-bullet blender. It was a hit and we will be making this again!

I absolutely love these! A client gave me the recipe and I "doctored" it up a bit as I'm notoriously known to do. I added cheddar cheese, extra garlic and shrimp!  Everyone loved them at the party.

Tried this recipe this morning. Sorry but they came out terrible.  I don't find that the recipe calls for enough seasonings.  They turned out very dry and bland.  I will definitely have to tweak this recipe till I come up with something much more tasty and moist.   I've made these in the past and decided to try a different recipe this time.  Sorry that I did.

Amazing! Unfortunately, I had to change a few ingredients (which I hate doing on a first trial) but they turned out wonderfully! The parents and children in my playgroup raved and I had to give them a link to this recipe! 
Nice recipe that you can adjust to what you have in the pantry and fridge.

i made this today 3-29-13, to bring to a crawfish boil, everyone LOVED them... i did make some changes... i used Stove Top Savory Herb instead of bread crumbs.. also added feta cheese flavored tomato & basil kind..i think next time i make these, i will add artichoke hearts and use Italian mix cheese with the Philly cheese in it.. also i thought that   by just using parmesian cheese, made these a little salty to me.

I made these for a Christmas appetizer & most people seemed to enjoy them, even the ones that don't like spinach.  I forgot to add the garlic powder & I can see where it would add the kick they were missing.  I used the stove top stuffing for chicken bread crumbs so there was a good seasoned taste to the balls.  We used the leftovers in spaghetti with a tomato sauce 3 days later.  They absorbed a lot of the moisture from the sauce & were better then they were the first time around.  I will make these again & get all the ingredients in!

This recipe needs a lot of work. As is, it is very bland. I decreased the amount of bread crumbs by a cup and added a ton and it came out very dry and bland. I had only baked 10 to test so with the remaining spinach mixture, I added garlic sauteed in oil, a little vegetable bullion cube and more garlic powder. It still came out bland and dry! I won't be making this again but I suggest sauteeing the spinach and adding all the flavoring and THEN adding it to the bread crumbs. Frozen whole cut spinach works better than chopped and consider covering the spinach balls with foil towards the end of baking to keep in some of the moisture.

i've made this a couple of times now; most recently i didn't add any butter or substitute, and i really don't think they need it. try rolling the balls in panko crumbs before putting them in the oven, it's so good!

This is a cool little appetizer.  Except for adding about half-a-cup of feta, I made them as directed.  This appetizer is reminiscent of stuffing, so if your buffet table includes stuffing as a dish, you might not want to serve these little goodies.  Other than that, I think they're perfect.

Made these with a box of chicken stuffing that had been lurking in my cabinet for a year. They were so good I caught my cat eating one, but since she's gluten-intolerant I had to tear it away from her. Very nice.

I would make the balls a bit smaller than walnut size - perhaps hazelnut and bake them for about 10 -13 minutes.

Wow, these were incredible! I made a double batch hoping to get some green leafy vegetables into my 2 yr old daughter. No luck with that, but boy did my husband and I enjoy them! In fact, I hesitate to make them again because I could not stop popping them. They are somewhat time-intensive in that you have to get all the liquid out of the spinach, which is a pain, and then there's the rolling. But, oh, the finished result is worth it!

I thought these were ok. I tried to use bread crumbs instead since no stuffing, only used 1 cup and 2 eggs. My 1 year old ate a few and my 3 year old didn't want to try them (which happens with everything). I will try it again, but with changes from other reviews.

My family loves this recipe and I have to make it every Thanksgiving.  Some put turkey gravy on them and some like them with my homemade spaghetti sauce.  I like them just by themselves.  So many ways to enjoy them!

These are excellent.  My mother-in-law has a recipe but it is very salty.  These aren't salty and have received rave reviews.  The first time I made them I doubled the batch and immediately had to make another double batch since my husband said they wouldn't last long.  On the second batch, I didn't have butter in the house so I used light butter and they came out just as good but a little less greasy.

I made these for Christmas dinner.  They were just okay.  We could really only taste the stuffing.  If I were to ever make them again, I would use either more spinach or less stuffing, I would increase the amount of parmesan cheese, and I would add a little kosher salt.

I thought they were a little dry and needed a sauce.  We ended up dipping them in tahini, then they tasted like spinach falafel.  Probably would have been better as an appetizer at a party than as a side dish for dinner.

I've never made any thing like these before but the recipe was so simple my 3 year old and I whipped them up in no time! I used cornbread stuffing so the herbs mixed in well...go easy on the garlic powder tho. I'll prob use garlic salt next time. The only turn off is they look like baby poo :) maybe cause I have a 7 month old...

I carried these to a party and they didn't last long!  Many ladies asked for the recipe.  They couldn't believe that they didn't have meat in them....I guess this was due to my using chicken flavored stuffing mix??   Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome!  I brought them to a family gathering and they were gone in 5 minutes!  I had planned to make a single batch but decided to double it halfway through, so I made a few modifications.  I added chopped broccoli for the 2nd half as I didn't have any more spinach, and used 1 package of chicken stuffing mix for the 2nd half as that was all I had.  I also added some minced garlic for more flavor.  I have been asked to bring these to every gathering we have!  Thanks for the great recipe!!  :-)

Love this easy appetizer recipe!  Great to make, freeze and have on hand for unexpected company.  Just pop 'em in the oven, and you look so prepared!  I like to add fresh minced garlic, minced onions, minced mushrooms, and a can of crabmeat to mine. They're awesome, and everyone wants the recipe!  I omit the italian seasonings, but that's just my preference.  These are a must try!

'Fabulous recipe.  I made my own stuffing--with bread crumbs, sage, salt and pepper--rather than use the stuffing mix called for.  I also added minced mushrooms and onions, and skipped the Italian seasoning.  There are infinite variations on this, I'm sure, and most any of them would be great.  :)  I made these almost muffin-size--as a side dish--, but for appetizers, I'd make them samller.  Be sure to grease the pan, these stick.  :)  'Great recipe.

I've never made spinach balls but last night I decided to try this recipe for a New Years Eve snack. I can't tell you how easy they were and how delicious. There were none left after the party! I cut back on the stuffing a little (after reading some of the reviews) but other than that it remained the same. My 4 year old daughter really had a great time helping. They turned out great!

I got this recipe from my mother in law years ago and I make them for almost every get-together.  I use a bit less bread crumbs (1 1/2 c to a pkg of spinach).  They are always a hit, especially with my 5 year old nephew!

These didn't taste bad exactly, but neither were they very good.  Very dry!  They needed....something....maybe feta or cream cheese?  Thank God they were cheap to make because no one ate more than one.

These were very tasty; too bad more people don't like spinach.  I reduced the breadcrumbs just a tad, because of other reviews and could have reduced a little bit more; I will next time.  I made these for a girl's get-together and rolled 'em up and put them in disposable aluminum pie pans for transport and then baked them when we decided to get the food out.  This worked just fine.  They taste good warmed up the next day too.

this was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and all my guests loved it.  THe only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I personally found them to be just a bit dry.  I will def. make this again, but maybe add a little less dry stuffing mix, or maybe just serve it with a dipping sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved these.  They were easy and turned out crispy and delicious.  Next time i'll try it with less butter.  A lot seemed to cook off.
