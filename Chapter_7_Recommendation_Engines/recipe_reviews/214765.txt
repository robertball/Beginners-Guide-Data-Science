I'm the submitter of this recipe and I'd like to note that when you stir in the mushroom soup and the stuffing into the "creamy gravy"...you cannot simmer this. Just cook it for a few min. I wish I had more control over the editing process of my father's recipe as some things have been changed (like words and time). This really is a recipe that you just eye ball as it cooks. For example it may take less than 10 min for your pan drippings to reduce by half.;) Otherwise a big thanks to the AR staff for publishing my father's recipe!!:D

I made these for supper last night, and I thought they were, in fact, CRAZY good. Based on what I had on-hand, I had to rearrange things a little, but I tried to keep as close to the recipe as I could. I browned the chops first, then made the sauce and stuffing mixture. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand, so I nearly tripled the sauce recipe (actually used 1/3 cup sherry, 1/3 cup flour, and about 3 cups milk), and seasoned with No-Salt Seasoning, also from this site, plus a little salt and pepper. I removed about 1 1/2 cups of the sauce from the pan before stirring in the stuffing mix. Topped the chops with the stuffing mixture, one slice of provolone cheese, and the remaining gravy. It was absolutely WONDERFUL, and as much as I hated to deviate from your father's recipe, I'm so glad you shared it, and I'm glad it led to such a great meal for us. Can't wait to try the original version, too - hopefully next time I'll be better prepared and have all the stuff ready! Thanks for sharing, Pam!

The stuffing was amazing! I used bone in chops because that was all I had...not the best thing to do. We had to scrape the stuffing off so we could see where to cut the chop. Very tasty though...I will make again with boneless chops as the recipe calls for.

This was an instant hit! Classic comfort food at its best. The only changes I made: an 8 oz package of stuffing mix was plenty and I added some black olives to the stuffing. I served it with mashed potatoes= killer! My husband was in heaven! My 16-month old who is quite picky gobbled it up too! Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty darned good! I did play with this some but the recipe and its directions are fine too just as is. This is an ideal dish for you to put your own spin on and I'll bet the same cook probably wouldn't make this the same way twice! In my case I did NOT brown the chops first. These boneless chops are so lean I didn't want to risk overcooking them. I put them in a foil-lined plan for easy clean up that I had oiled lightly with olive oil. I seasoned the chops with salt pepper and poultry seasoning (a good place for your own spin here in terms of seasonings!) To the stuffing itself I added chopped celery cuz Hubs likes it. I found it kind of drab looking and seriously in need of some color easily rectified with a little chopped parsley. To the sauce I added a good glug of white wine (Chardonnay) as well as a couple of shakes of Worcestershire sauce. Perfectly baked juicy and tender after 30 minutes and like meatloaf good comfort food. Bonus for calling for boneless chops good clean eatin with no bone to have to work around!

Thanks Pam's dad for an outstanding recipe! Even my picky 22 month-old loved this. Next time I'll try this recipe with chicken breasts. I'm sure it's excellent that way as well but delicious as-is.

This dish just didn't come together for me. The cream of mushroom soup was far too overpowering. Also combined with the fact that I usually don't like pan-fried meat it bombed on me. The stuffing had surprisingly little flavor. As I was eating my pork chop I pondered what a homemade mushroom sauce would do to the overall quality of the recipe.

We loved this recipe. At first I thought it was way too much stuffing but it really wasn't. We love fresh mushrooms so next time I think I'll add more but we gave it a 2 thumb up. It was even better as leftovers!! The only thing different I did was not add the sherry because I ddn't have any. Believe it or not I just poured in a little half & half for moisture.

Yum. Followed the recipe except that I used 1 can regular cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup because that is all I had.

Not impressed. So sorry to say this Pam. I'm not sure why this has all the rave reviews. The pork had no flavor (should have guessed this considering it's not seasoned at all) and the whole meal tasted like box/bag stuffing with flavorless pork and cream of mushroom soup. To me it was too much work when all I really had to do was make the 5 min. stuffing and throw some cream of mushroom soup on it and I'd get the same effect. Sorry!

We absolutely love this recipe. It's moist the chops are tender. I have even served it for company. And it's so easy to throw together.

It was a dud at my house. It turned out with juicy chops and the stuffing was okay in flavor but it was a bit boring for my adventurous eaters.

I found that this recipe left the pork chops nice and tender when baked for 20-25 minutes at 375. I did brown them first in a bit of olive oil instead of butter. Then just melted butter to add to the stuffing later. Please be sure to season the chops first...even if it's only with salt and pepper. The stuffing I found to be just ok. I also used a bit of butter to saute the mushrooms and onions. It is a great base though. Depending on what brand of stuffing mix you used (I used Pepperidge Farms Herb stuffing mix in the bag) you may need to add some seasonings to the stuffing mixture as well. I added dried thyme salt pepper and parsley. I think the two cans of soup and all the milk is a bit much. Next time I would sub out some of the milk for some chicken broth or white wine and split one can of cream of mushroom between both the stuffing and the topping. I used a large ice cream scoop to mound up the stuffing on top of the chops. I then added the soup topping and sprinkled them with some paprika for color. My family enjoyed this but like I said it needed some tweaking for our liking...so I'm only giving it a 3. Good base recipe though.

My husband gives it 5 stars! Great comfort food and it is certainly a heavy meal so be prepared to relax afterward! I used fileted chops shallots instead of onions and port instead of sherry since it's what I had on hand. Will make again.

This recipe turned out very well. It was quite flavorful. I did substitute Marsala wine for Sherry just because I didn't have any Sherry in the house. I also used Cream of Celery soup instead of mushroom just because my husband doesn't care for mushrooms. That being the case I also skipped using mushrooms. My husband really enjoyed it. I cut the recipe down for two chops. That still ended up making about four servings of stuffing. I'll serve the leftover stuffing with chicken. It's a good recipe and I'll make it again.

I made this last night and followed the recipe to the letter. It was very tasty and well-received by my family. The only thing I would do next time is to use only ONE can of soup dividing it in half and adjusting the amount of milk accordingly. The sauce was extremely rich and a bit too "gloppy" for my taste. Otherwise though it was good and I will be making it again. Thank you Pam and Pam's dad.

Mixing 2 cans of mushroom soup in this recipe was too much salt for me. It made the stove top box of cornbread dressing (which is pretty salty to begin with)a gooey mess and the flavor of the cornbread all but disappeared. I would use one can of mushroom soup split between the dressing and the sauce and make up the liquid difference in milk or make up the cornbread recipe as written on the package make the delicious mushroom/sherry sauce and pour over the chops and spoon the cornbread mix on the top. Cover and bake.

This is pure comfort food! This gravy was amazing! I did like other reviewers suggested and browned the chops first and set aside then added the mushrooms and onions. Hubby is already asking me to make this again! This is a keeper!
