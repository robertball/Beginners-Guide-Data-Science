Wonderful Recipe! I did add 3 cloves of fresh garlic minced (I LOVE Garlic). Used 1 Red & 1 Green Pepper, 1 Red Onion, fresh ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon or to taste, 4 Red potatoes (sliced like potato chips but thicker, and added 1 1/2 tsp Mrs. Dash Italian Medley, 2tsp Parsley (freshly chopped). I did with these specs but times 3 as I needed bigger serving size. I used cast iron skillets and it came out wonderful and very colorful. I recommend changing up the peppers to red, green, yellow, and orange. Not only for color but some peppers are sweeter than others if you want something along the lines of sweetness. Next time I will be cutting back on the oil beings that much oil was not needed, due to the fact that kielbasa is naturally greasy anyhow. If you decide to add the fresh garlic and parsley add with the onions and oil. :)

I got a little creative. I added red, green, and yellow peppers, asparagus, mushrooms and of course garlic. I added all of the veggies in the w/ onions. Other than that I followed directions and ingredients. Was very good! Would make a great breakfast dish with a tortilla, maybe even as a buritto.

I've heard so many good things about this recipe, but we don't like Kielbasa.So I went ahead  and used Spicy Italian Sausage in it's place.My other changes to the basic recipe were in adding 2 cloves garlic to the onion saute,adding an extra potato, using 3 peppers (green, red and orange), and adding about 2 Tbsp. fresh parsley just before serving. We really enjoyed this dish... and even though I may have changed it up a bit to suit our particular tastes, I'm still rating it a 5*. This recipe is highly recommended, no matter what kind of sausage you choose to use.

I finally tried this....it has come highly recommended by my Quality Cook friends.  Thanks guys, the family really liked it.  I did have to cut the peppers into smaller pieces so my oldest would eat them.  I used a red and orange pepper and I added some  Roasted Garlic & Bell Pepper Seasoning and it was great.  I will make this often...thanks Christopher for the yummy recipe.

This is wonderful. By placing the kielbasa on top of the potato onion mixture, the juices are flowing down into the other ingredients, giving them a tasty flavor. I cut the green pepper to one rather than two for personal preference. Thanks for sharing Christopher.

I pretty much followed this recipe to a T and it came out great (I added 2 tbspns of garlic)...the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of oil which I would still use for the cooking of the potatoes, but I drained the grease out before letting the dish cool and set in the skillet.  Another suggestion is to add the peppers a little later in the cooking process since they got very mushy, but overall this recipe is a 5 ya'll!!!!

OK, this was fab and so easy!  I used turkey kielbasa and one each of green and red peppers.  I also seasoned a little with garlic salt. I fried everything as directed for 13 minutes and then added about 1/2 a bottle of beer and boiled for another 10 minutes.  The potatoes were nice and tender and I think the beer added some good flavor.  I highly recommend this!

Great for a cold New England night.   Some would call it comfort food.   I did use bacon grease instead of oil.   It flavored the potatoes wonderfully.  About 2 tablespoons.   I used sliced baby carrots and celery also.  This recipe will be used often.  Thanks

Excellent!!!  I used turkey kielbasa and quite a bit less oil (just over a tablespoon) and it turned out so yummy.  The kielbasa really seasons the potato/onion/green pepper mixture.  The only thing I would do differently with this one would be to add the peppers during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  They really get pretty soggy and I guess it's just a personal preference to have a more crisp green pepper.  Thanks much - this recipe is great!

I made it for my husband and did not try it as I do not like potatoes or kielbasa, followe all direction yet my my husband found it bland. I added minced garlic to the onions as they sauteed and added thyme, rosemary, and basil but he still found it tastleless...sorry. He is not a fussy man so I assume it needs more.

Absolutly fantastic!! I used 1 green, 1/2 red, and 1/2 yellow bell peppers and added them in before the final step. I also cut down on the oil and added 2 cloves of garlic. I used 1.25 of red potatoes (left the skin on) plus one regular potato. Next time I think I'll add more.

This was very well received by my boys. I only used one orange bell pepper (they won't eat them, but I will), and I added two large smashed cloves of garlic. The potatoes and pepper were pretty mushy, but still tasted great. Next time I make this, I'll fiddle with the cooking time a little bit, and I won't use extra oil since the kielbasa definitely has enough grease for the entire meal. We will definitely be having this again!

This was tasty and very good for a weeknight dinner of this working mom.  I came home, chopped up onion and threw it into my cast iron skillet and peeled and cubed yukon gold (yellow) potatoes, while my onions were stewing in the olive oil.  Paid attention to the directions and added everything  when it said I should, except the green peppers. I took the casing off the kielbasa and added the green peppers when I added the meat.  I did add garlic powder (at the end because it didn't have that much flavor) but all in all, this was a great recipe.  Using the cast iron helped with the oil issue that everyone else seemed to complain about.

I made this for dinner last night and my fiance and I loved it. I added red peppers as well and cook the potatoes separately. I toasted some french bread hoagies and we put the sausage and peppers on the roll with some spicy mustard. It was delicious.

I've been wanting to make this for quite awhile now, but just kept forgetting about it. Hubster brought home kielbasa Friday night but never ate it, so I figured this would be a good time to try this. Using my mandolin, I sliced my potatoes thinly but I felt the cooking time was off being that it took much longer for them to become tender. Because the recipe sounded a little dry, I decided to put my own twist on it. I used fresh green bell pepper, but used jarred roasted red peppers and added a bit of the brine along with more seasonings minus the salt. I also added some beer during the cooking process and because my Scottish husband loves the German food I grew up with, I threw in some caraway seeds and a small can of sauerkraut. I had a nice little sauce going and he gave this dish his stamp of approval. Drew really loved your recipe Christopher and thanks so much!!

My husband loved this.  He actually had thirds!!  I made the recipe as is and I think the only change I will make next time is to cut back on the oil.  I don't usually use all the oil called for in a recipe, but wanted to try this as written first.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one is a keeper.

Good fast meal to prepare for dinner. And leftovers in a flour tortilla with some hot sauce take care of any left overs.

I like that it was cheap and easy, tastes alright.  Nothing special though - would make again in a pinch.  I thought everything turned out too mushy and I even added the peppers during the last five minutes.  Tastes like breakfast, might make some scrambled eggs to go with the leftovers and top with cheese like a skillet.

First time I made it and it all went!  Fantastic recipe.  I did add a couple banana pepper and that was the only comment I hear, "more pepper still."  But that is all personal preferance and we love peppers.  I would also suggest as many others did, start by browning down your potatoes first.

This has become a family favorite!  I use whatever peppers I have on hand and it always turns out wonderfully delicious.  Even frozen peppers from the summer garden work well.  Wouldn't change a thing!!!!

This recipe was so easy to prepare. It was also quite tasty considering that it doesn't require much seasonings! I added water to the pan after the potatoes were added, and it made a really nice subtle sauce. I then served it in a deep bowl. A really great quick meal for anyone who likes basic meals. If you have a preference for finer foods, it may not be a big hit for you.  Otherwise, it's certainly worth a try.

This was very good.  Not a drop left over!  I made a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used red potatoes leaving the skin on, and I used one green & one red pepper.  Oh and I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  This will definitely be a repeat in my house.  Thank you for sharing.

WOW!  I made this recipe for the guy's Poker night!  This was a great hit!  May I suggest you use ony the best kielbasa (I go to a Polish provisions store where it's made fresh daily).  I also added a little chopped garlic (1 TBS) and minced jalapenos (1 tsp).  I think the next time I make this, I will use a mix of red, green, and yellow peppers for a nicer presentation.  YUMMY!

This is a very simple yet tasty recipe. It smells and tastes great. It is very homey and great with a side of corn bread. I've made this many times , always with success.

A+++++ The whole family LOVED this!  Made it last week, and it has been requested again this week.  I only used 2 potatoes and cut them into 1/2" cubes.  Cooked quickly this way - done in about 25 minutes.   Served it with a green salad.  It was perfect!

This recipe was fantastic. I didn't do much different and my husband and I ate almost all of it. I did use the lite turkey kielbasa. I also only used one green pepper. Turned out great! I will definitely make this again.

Loved this! I did change a couple things. First, I used bacon fat I save when I cook bacon , so had it on hand. Lightly fried the potatoes sliced in the bacon fat. Took potatoes out and set aside; then fried the kielbasa a bit, then added the peppers, onion, 2 cloves of garlic. Cook 5 mins. Then return the potatoes to the pepper onion kielbasa combination; cook until the potatoes are tender. I added 4 good shakes of Louisiana hot sauce. Turn off heat and let the flavored meld! Wonderful w/ rice, or w/ eggs, or as a taco or burrito! Voila!

This recipe is easy to put together and turned out delicious.  I had yellow potatoes, that have soft skins, so I did not peel the potatoes.  Because the dish is covered for most of the cooking time, the potatoes will get soft, and not crispy.  They worked well in this dish.  I served 'KISS: Keep it Simple (Brussels) Sprouts' from AR, homemade applesauce and bread sticks with this meal.  This meal would work well to prep ahead and cook later.

Peppers were too soggy but, the flavor was awesome. I wish there was a way to get the flavor of the peppers without actually using peppers. maybe if I dont slice them up and just quarter them. this way, I could remove them when the dish is done. It definitely needs the peppers.

This was sooooo good. I have fixed dishes like this before, but the particular instructions make for a great reduction in the starch of the potatoes, and a verrrrry good sauce. I used chicken sausage. We ate the leftovers in the morning in a tortilla, with hot sauce. THANK YOU!

This was SO SO SO good.  Mine cooked much faster than the recipes indicates, but maybe because I used Yukon Gold potatoes??  Either way it was very good and very satisfying!

After eating this the day I made it, I rated it 4 stars. I had to come back today to rate it 5!  The flavors melded together overnight and made the most delicious filling for burritos!  I just wrapped up the mixture in a tortilla with some cheese and sour cream.  Here's my original review:  turned out yummy! made without peppers, just potatoes onions and kielbasa.  made rice but that was dumb- it was a carbfest. This can stand alone, maybe with a salad. A great one pot comfort meal.  I think it makes enough to feed at least 6- and cheaply! Thanks!

I loved this - I only used one green pepper, but added one red pepper. I also used two cloves of garlic, and next time I will cut back on the oil. I added parsley and a bit more salt. I will make this again!

This was a basic quick dinner for those busy nights. I  used red potatoes and left the skin on and microwaved them first to cut down on the cooking time. I  used less oil and turkey Kielbasa. I also added frozen  peas just before turning off the heat and letting it sit for a few minutes covered before serving. I did not find it amazing- just a simple dinner or lunch.

Thanks for a new way to use kielbasa.  My husband called it "Good German food".  I liked it for a salty dish, and since it was easy and quick to make.

I wasn't expecting anything great and just chose this because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Was I surprised!!! It is absolutely delicious and the leftovers were even better.  I also only used 1 green pepper.

This recipe is pretty good!  I made it step for step the first time and made a few changes after that, just because I'm not much of a fan of kielbasa.  I used Italian sausage instead (removed the links and just let it cook ground) and added chopped red potatoes with the onion and green peppers.  I also fixed rice cooked with beef broth on the side and it definitely made a very filling dish (not carb friendly but who cares? ;-)  Overall a very good dish :-)

This was great!!!! I left out the bell peppers. Cooked a long time and the sausage was so tender (and the potatoes too)! Will definetly double next time. We were all fighting over the last serving. Great easy recipe! Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I used turkey sausage and one green pepper as recommended by other reviewers. I started the ingredients in a large skillet early in the day, then I transferred everything to the slow cooker and set the temp. at low. It was the perfect dinner for cold night.  I might double this next time---I can't believe we ate the whole thing!

I ended up making this recipe completely by accident since I was actually looking to make sausage and potato soup but I didn't read far enough ahead to realize this wasn't soup!  I am so glad I tried it though because this recipe is great!!  I didn't add the green peppers because my husband doesn't like them, but I did add whole uncooked green beans.  The first time I made them I added the green beans when I added the sausage.  Now I add them after the onion has been frying for a few minutes.  Great recipe Christopher!

Great recipe for a cold evening.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used turkey sausage, only 1 pepper and new red potatoes.  The recipe says it serves 4 but my husband and I ate the entire pan full.

Excellent flavor.  My son asked me to use more kielbasa next time, but I like the idea of cutting the green pepper to one.  I also used red potatoes and didn't bother peeling them.  Everybody loved it.  Thanks Christopher for sharing Mimi's recipe.

I made this with regular pork kielbasa and it was wonderful!  Next time I will make it with the beef keilbasa, and I will add 1 more potato and maybe more onion.  Nonetheless, it was excellent!

I have been this for years and it has always been a hit.  Sometimes I make this for breakfast, adding  2 - 4 eggs at the end, either stirring them into the sausage mixture (like scrambled eggs) or just letting  the eggs sit on top of the sausage mixture (like fried eggs), covered, til the eggs are cooked through.  Top it all off with some shredded cheddar cheese and you've got one hearty stick-to-your ribs breakfast!  The boys like to douse it all with salsa or siracha sauce.

Really yummy! I wanted a simple, fast meal that used some of the kielbasa from our freezer, and this was it.

Like other reviewers, I used bacon grease instead of oil (maple flavored, which added a nice note), chopped some garlic to cook with the onion, and flavored with a little Italian Seasoning from Mrs. Dash. I added some snap peas we had left in the fridge to supplement our one sad potato, and held off on adding the bell pepper until the last 5 minutes. I can see myself eating this for breakfast and will try that for a weekend brunch soon. This time I served it with some honey-sweetened cornbread muffins (from a box-
 gotta keep it simple!) Thanks for the great recipe!

A really good base recipe!  The only thing I did different is roast my potatoes (I always find that they don't cook evenly..and always stick to the pan, when I make them on the stove). I also used roasted garlic keilbasa ...added lots of flavor. And a few shakes of cajun seasoning. This is a little bland otherwise, so needs some garlic flavor!

My family enjoyed this. I did add 2 cloves of garlic to oil with the onions. We  love garlic. For color I added one red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper. The rest was as the recipe called for.  Very east to make.

I added mushrooms, fresh green beans, garlic, red and yellow peppers (along with what it was called for). I had a lot of things in the fridge that was ready to spoil in a couple of days so I threw it in! My seasonings consisted of: a dash of red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, S&P, rosemary and parsley (I didn't measure it, just tossed some in to my liking). I started with sautéing the onions in oil, added the garlic and seasonings. Then threw in the cubed potatoes. Realized the potatoes weren't cooking at all (and I ran out of skillet room) so I threw in the peppers, mushrooms, green beans and sausage into my cast iron skillet while the potatoes finished cooking. I have made something similar before and thought it was too dry so I added a can of chicken broth to the potatoes to make a gravy. Once everything was finished cooking, I threw it all together into the cast iron skillet and BAM! One of the best dinners I've made (according to my husband!) I highly recommend this changes if you are looking for a more gravy type of dinner. Def comfort food!

I was looking for something different tonight to make with sausage.  This was super fantastic!  I actually had all of the ingredients!  My children eat very well!  I did not have bell pepper but I had mini sweet peppers in red, yellow, and orange that I used in it.  This will definitely be made in my house again!!!!

So I tried this recipe tonight but changed it up a little and used what I had in the kitchen.  I used Turkey Kielbasa, 1 red pepper, 1 onion, and 1 Zucchini also added 1 sweet potato.  Then for seasoning I used a roasted garlic and herb seasoning along with garlic pepper and my non dairy stick butter and it came out awesome will make it again.

I made this last night and it was a big hit with me, husband and son.  Son does not like onions or peppers but he loved this.  I also added two stalks of celery chopped, 4 roma tomatoes chopped and a bunch of garlic granules.  Will make this often.

I liked this one-pot meal combining several of my favorite foods. I steamed the carrots & potatoes separately (in the mwo) for a few minutes, then sautéed the meat and onions before adding them. I added the bell peppers last, as I like them with some crunch. I cut the pieces into a large dice like hash & served with sunny side up eggs on top & Sriracha biscuits on the side. Very satisfying & will be making it again - maybe with different meats and adding mushrooms & cabbage.

I really like this dish.  The potatoes get cooked really nicely with almost a crisp outside.  I really like the combo of the potatoes and peppers with the meat.  And I usually use turkey kielbasa instead of the beer.  I have made this a couple of times and it's a hit with my husband!

The only change I made was less oil and multi colored peppers.  I used 4 tablespoons of olive oil and I believe I could have used less. Both my husband and I loved it.  So flavorful!!  I served buttered cabbage with it.  Yum!!  A definite make-again and again dish!  Thank you!

This is just like my mom used to make.  Husband and picky 3 year old loved it too.(Although 3 year old left the peppers on her plate, as i always did as a kid) I used one red and one green. Had a little trouble getting the potatoes to cook without burning everything, i put in a little water and covered the pan worked great and the dish was not runny. I also did not use all of the oil, just a table spoon of olive oil. I too followed advice of others and boiled the kielbasa for 30-40 minutes.  Will make again.

I added the peppers in after the potatoes had had some time to color. Like everyone else I used garlic at the initial saute stage.

My peppers are still a little overcooked, but I was using frozen veggies. Still, a definite repeat! Get creative with veggies and seasonings.

Wonderful winter favorite. Entire family loved it. Suggestion: Put the bell peppers in the last 20 min. Because they were in there so long, the skin became stringy.

This is almost the exact same recipe as Kielbasa with Peppers & Potatoes on this site.  I'm giving it  5 stars, as with the other receipe, this is a really quick & easy meal to prepare.  I used Turkey Kielbasa to save on the calories & fat.

I made this last week and thought it was very good.  I added garlic with the onions (red onion).  I cut back on the oil as the keilbasa is greasy enough.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I as well as my kids love this. I sub the vegetable oil for olive. The only other change I would make to this recipe is to add the pepper and onion in the last step They do tend to get mushy as others have posted.

This was a nice stew, but everything was left a little mushy at the end.  I think it would be better to brown the sausage a bit before letting it all cook together.

This was good and easy to make. Followed directions and ingredients but I only had 1/2 a package of beef kielbasa.

I followed hreed's suggestion and browned the kielbasa and potatos seperately before adding the the rest of the ingrediants to prevent "mushyness" and it came out good. My husband and father-in-law loved it, I wasn't quite as impressed. I'll probably make again as a fall back.

This really wasn't anything to brag about. I made it for a diner and I think it would be a better breakfast. Also I would recommend browning the potatoes and kielbasa and then adding the other stuff. It was just all too mushy.

This was very tastey, inexpensive, and quick and easy to prepare.  I found this recipe and it reminded me of something dad used to make with leftovers but he called it slop.  This was much prettier than dad's "slop".  I agree with other reviewers that the recommended amounts of salt and oil should be reduced.

This is definitely a man's meal. My husband enjoyed it although he said he would have preferred the sausage grilled first. Don't use very much oil to saute onions because the sausage is really greasy and you won't want any extra! It was good and something I might make again if I don't have much at the house, but not something to go out of my way to make.

I love this recipe! Very hearty and very filling. I have a very similiar version of this recipe that I've been making for years! Sometimes I make a breakfast version and add scrambled eggs and use red potatoes. YUMMY=) I even sometimes make without potatoes and serve over rice!!! Also very yummy=)

Wonderful! It was filling, flavorfull and easy to make. I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic just to kick up the flavor. It was great with a few drips of tobasco sauce after I plated it- that was just a personal preference though, it was fine the way it was. My husband told me to make sure I tagged this one. Thank You!

Great recipe and easy to make too!  This also doubles or triples quite easily.  The only thing I would recommend is putting the green and red bell peppers in towards the end as the got mushy and nasty the first time I followed the directions.  This recipe has become permanent in my recipe box.  Thanks Mimi!!

Wow! this was great. I in the past have been hesitant of sausage(probably because I never know how to cook it) This recipe was not only good but easy! I just added asparagus cause i needed to finish it up!  Thank you

Not a bad taste but the photo and directions do not match.  The photo appears that the dish calls for red peppers while the ingredients do not call for them.  Also, the instructions are not clear as they ask you to add the kielbasa on two separate occasions.  A little confusing, but easy to figure out.  The taste is pretty plain and certainly is not anything special.  But, if you want to make a very quick and easy meal, I say go ahead.  We will try this one with the family over Xmas and see what they think.

As a single male, I often prepare many recipes off of this website.  This particular recipe was simple to prepare and a joy to eat.  I used Beef kielbasa which came out to be very delicious.  I reduced the green bell peppers to 1 instead of 2, added about 3/4 cup of fresh sliced mushroom, and my favorite seasonings.  This dish will be added to archive of first-date dishes (LOL).  Very delicious dish.  Congrats to the uploader.  Thank you.

I've made this a few times, and I've loved it every time.  I also use low-fat kielbasa.  You can't tell the difference and it cuts down on the fat.  Be sure to use a big frying pan; the first time I made this I could barely fit the lid on the one I used.

What a name! This was very good. Took longer than I thought, the reviews are varied about that, I guess it just depends on how thick you cut the potatoes. I added garlic and some of a dry packet of italian dressing. Based on reviews I waited to add the peppers but I cut them so small I don't think it mattered. Next time I will probably cut them a little thicker. To make it lower in fat I used only a little olive oil, about 1 1/2 TBS and turkey kielbasa. Was very good, I will absolutely make again.

This is one of my favorite sausage recipes. My mom use to make it all the time using either turkey sausage or lite smoked sausage to save on the fat. Yummy!

Very good and very easy to make! I did what others had said and added some garlic and italian seasoning. I only had green peppers on hand, but next time I think I will add some red pepper as well seeing as those are my favorite!

This was god, and hubby loved it, but I felt it lacked something.  (Not sure what!)  I like my potatoes nice and crisp, and they turned out pretty soggy, although tasty.  Not quite sure if I'l try this again, though I'll keep the recipe just because hubby liked it so much.

Very good. I would not use a lot of oil to cook the onions because the smoked sausage(I used lite) gives off a lot of grease. I added a little chopped garlic to the onions. I would also watch the cook times since I used yukon gold potatoes and diced them it didn't take as long to cook. By the time I got to the end cook time my peppers and potatoes were overdone - mushy-didn't need to sit w/lid on. Everyone liked it & was good the next day w/scrambled eggs. I will make again.

My daughter called raving to me about this recipe. I tried it the next week and my husband and I loved it, too.  I did find that it took a little longer than I expected to cook the potatoes, so the next time I made it I used frozen hash brown potatoes.  It cooked fast and we liked it that way as well. Great recipe.

This is a family favorite, often requested by my picky teens...there are never leftovers because it disappears.  I always add a little garlic to this recipe for a little punch.  It's easy & extremely fast to prepare.  You can't beat it for a busy night or when you're lacking the energy to cook for the hungry natives!!

Great recipe, I will definitely make again. I followed instructions exactly except used less oil. The sausage really flavors the other ingredients really well. Next time I might use light sausage because it was a little greasy for my taste. Also, make sure to check the potatoes for doneness because may not need to cook the whole amount of time listed. Great recipe for a quick meal!

Ok, so the name isn't particularly appetizing (my audience wrinkled their noses upon hearing it), but you can't argue with the flavor. I really liked it though it was a bit on the greasy side. The overall mix of potatoes with sausage and peppers worked very well together.

This turned out to be very good!! I was a little skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised. I did change a few things...I used one red and one green pepper. I also sliced the potatoes and used red so I didn't peel. I also used 2 bratwurst and 4 hot links that were left over in the fridge. I will definitely make this again!

Hubby and I both thought this was really good!  I used one red and one green pepper, otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  I do think the cook time is off a little though, or maybe I just had the heat up too high.  The potatoes got a little mushy. Hubby also said he thought the kielbasa should have been browned up a little more. I think next time I'll add that before the potatoes.  Great flavor, though!  Thanks for the recipe Christopher, I can't wait to have the leftovers.

This was really good, and so simple!  The only changed I made was adding a spoonful of minced garlic.  It's a delicous, hardy meal.

This was great.  I used a small amount of oil in a black iron skillet. Diced red potatoes (peeling on), added onion to this and cooked until the potatoes were almost tender.  I added green pepper (1), and the sausage.  We loved it and it was really easy.

What a nice surprise!  We make kielbasa and potatoes fairly often, but this put a nice twist to it.  Loved the peppers.  Hubby made this and added some garlic powder and grill seasoning that he puts on everything.  Very comforting winter supper although it was just two of us and we have hardly any leftover!

Liked the taste of this recipe very much, but I only gave it 4 stars because it was very oily. Perhaps that's because I used a non-stick pan?? Next time I make this I'm going to use less oil and cook in a cast iron pan to see   if it makes a difference.

Excellent. I used olive oil and one red and one green pepper. I took other reviewers advice and added in the pepper when I stirred in the sausage. Thanks.

Yum, yum!  This is a simple, tasty recipe.  My family has enjoyed it twice now.  I would suggest leaving out the salt and pepper -- the sausage gives it plenty of salt and seasonings.  I also like my peppers to be a little less mushy than the recipe calls for cooking them, so I go along with the advice to add them just before the sausage.

This was extremely delicious. My husband and I both loved it and are looking forward to taking it for lunch tomorrow. I added a FINELY diced habanero pepper for spice when I browned the onion. Also, I added the bell peppers right before the kielbasa which left them still a little crisp which I loved. All in all, wonderful, cheap to make, and will be a repeat in my household. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Loved this one!  I relied on the advice of Chikee and Mandy Sue - used olive oil and less of it.  Also I let the potatoes cook a little bet before adding the green peppers.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will be making this one again and again.

This was tasty.  I used 1 red and 1 orange pepper.  I think a red and a green would be the way to go for appearance.   I'd count on at least 1 to 1.25 hours to make this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Terrific!  I used two green peppers, sliced thin, and 1/2 onion, plus the smoked turkey kielbasa.  I thought I made enough to have leftovers, but my husband had seconds and thirds!  Thanks for sharing.

This was great. It took more like an hour from start to finish, but it was worth it. I used only maybe 2 tablespoons of oil, ½ an onion, 5 potatoes, and I substituted peas for the peppers as suggested by a previous reviewer. I also added one minced clove of garlic. Turned out great! I loved it, and my daughter inhaled the sausage. My husband was so-so, but he complains about chunks of potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy to make, affordable, filling and tasty! I threw in a little garlic and used freshly ground pepper to add a bit more flavor. It was a big hit with the family and I will definitely make it again.

I combined both of Christopher's recipes (this + Polish Meat and Potatoes) and added my own touch (2t chopped garlic instead of the powder, and lite kielbasa).  Just spray the pan lightly rather than using the amount of oil called for.  After cooking the onions slightly, I added everything else and tossed every 5 minutes until the potatoes (which I microwaved for 5min first) were done.

Tasty :) I probably would have rated it a 4 but my bf really loved it. Some parts were a little burnt so I'll make sure to add more liquid to the recipe next time. But overall, a good flavor; thanks!

My husband and I both love this dish.  It tastes a lot like scalloped potatos and ham, but takes half the time to cook and prepare.  It is also great for lunch the next day!

My husband and my two picky boys LOVED this recipe!  Anything that those three will all eat is a KEEPER recipe!!!!  I sauted the onions and bell pepper long enough so that I would be sure it was nice and soft.  I used 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt instead of regular salt, only used 1/4 tsp of pepper and added 1/2 tsp of garlic pwdr and a couple of splashes of a good german beer.  Oh, and I only used about 2 tbs of oil instead of 1/4 cup.  YUM!!!!!

EXCELLENT! This was a great meal for my husband and I.  I followed the recipe mostly, except for using smoked sausage, cooking it much longer to make sure the potatoes were really done, and half way through the cooking process I felt I needed more liquid and poured a dark beer into the concoction. I omitted the green pepper entirely and added granulated garlic.  This recipe is going straight into my recipe box to make again and again.  Thank you!

This was sooo good--I didn't make that many changes to it either (I did follow the advice to cut down on the pepppers, I used 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 a red pepper. I also used only 3 medium red potatoes).  We were fighting over leftovers! I served this with rice. I also ate it for breakfast with some toast!

After reading all the great reviews, I doubled the recipe right away.  That was a mistake because my one son hated the potatoes and the rest of us thought it was just okay.  The flavor was good but it was not anything special.

This recipe is SUPER easy and SUPER good!  Both my kids scarfed it up!  I did add minced garlic in with the onions to add a little more flavor because I was afraid it would be bland.  But thanks for the great recipe!  It is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was so easy to follow and so easy to make. My husband couldn't wait until it was ready - it smelled great while cooking. I used the Lite Turkey kielbasa and it still tasted great. This is a definite keeper!!
