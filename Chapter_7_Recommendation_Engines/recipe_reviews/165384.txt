ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  I followed the recipe as stated except I was out of rum extract so I used double the amount of pure madagascar vanilla extract.  These waffles were so tasty!  I will replace my regular waffle recipe with this one.  For the pancake syrup used in this, I used the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup recipe (love) from this site.  Thanks, Prell2k4 for a great recipe!

Excellent. I'm going to use this as a dessert if I ever have people over again. I followed this recipe exactly, except that I got lazy and time-crunched at the end and used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream. The waffles alone are fantastic, I served some with strawberries and Absolute Best Pancake Syrup for the fools that didn't want Bananas Foster. Thanks, Prell - another hit! ;)

This was awesome!!!  I only used the sauce part of the recipe as a I had a craving for pancakes,  Wow was it ever good.  I  did do things a little different,  I doubled the recipe but I didn't double the pancake syrup.  I also omitted the rum extract and added more vanilla.  I wasn't too sweet and the taste of bananas was through out the sauce, I'm thinking when we make this again I want to try it with mashed bananas instead. thanks

I made the bananas foster topping according to the recipe and used it on top of pancakes.  Added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was better than what you get at IHOP!  Delicious!!

I tried this reciepe for my Bed and Breakfast and would make a few changes.  I would not put the pecans in the sauce, I think it would be better to chop and toast the pecans, then sprinkle on top.  I would also reduce the rum extract to 1 tsp. I agree with another review regarding the waffle, a bit to eggie...  I think once tweeked a bit, this receipe would make it to my bed and breakfast table.

I'm giving this 4 stars for the sauce. I thought the waffles tasted too much like egg. The sauce was amazing!!! And very easy! Will use for french toast, pancakes, or even vanilla ice cream.

I only tried the waffle recipe- didn't make the banana topping.  The waffles are very easy to make!  They do have a very eggy flavor to them.... almost like french toast.  Next time I will add some cinnamon to the mix to try that.  They are also very heavy and I found leaving them in the waffle maker a little longer made them more crispy so they didn't get soggy quickly.

Super easy, super fast.  I didn't even make the waffle part of the recipe, using a commercial mix instead.  The banana sauce was delicious.  (Though didn't have any rum extract, but the vanilla was enough.)  Next time I might halve the pecans, and perhaps even toast them first.
Really liked that part of the recipe.  Will make again.
Probably taste good on pancakes too!

The basic waffle recipe is very quick and easy.    Most belgium waffle recipes that I've made in the past require you to whip up the egg whites seperately and then fold them into the batter... not so with this recipe.  Even without this step, the end product was still light, fluffy and very tastey.  The only modification I made to the recipe was to add cinnamon to the batter.    The recipes says that this serves 4... I have the standard size square belgium waffle maker and I was able to make at least 8 big waffles.   I did not make the banana foster sauce part but will try it next time.

I tried this recipe this morning and it was delicious. One warning though...it is one of those sweet, heavy breakfasts that puts you straight to sleep after. My husband, baby and I were knocked out for 2 hours after eating this. Good thing it is the long weekend.  A couple substitutions I made in the syrup: I used blueberry juice instead of rum extract (as I hate the taste of rum), and maple syrup instead of the Mrs. Butterworths, and omitted the nuts.   I also skipped on the whipped cream, and used Breyers double churned cookies and cream ice cream instead.

The recipe that came with my waffle maker was terrible, so I tried this one with 2 twists: I substituted buttermilk for the milk and rum for the rum extract. My kids LOVE the waffles and I make them without the sauce, but sometimes add just fresh bananas and whip cream.  In my Belgian machine, this recipe barely makes 4, so I usually triple the recipe & freeze the leftovers.

I managed to stop eating this long enough to write this review...I wish I could have recorded the look on my hubby and sons face when they took their first bite, it was priceless! This recipe is a KEEPER! I served this with the banana foster sauce, I had no pecans so I used peanuts which was very yummy with the bananas, and a dollop of home made whipped cream! Very good! Excellent Dessert! 500 million stars for you, thank you for sharing this, I am now hailed queen of the waffles in my house:)

For us, this recipe was way too sweet and the taste of rum/vanilla in the sauce was way too strong. If I could go back, I would cut the rum, vanilla and brown sugar in half. It is a little frustrating to go back and read the reviews only to discover that people made changes to the recipe, then gave their own recipe 5 stars.

I made this as written and it was very good.  The waffles were quite light.  Next time I will increase the flour a little. The sauce was good, but excessively sweet. I probably will cut down on the addition of syrup next time. That being said, my husbannd loved them.

Liked the idea of the recipe, but the waffles were too soggy and "eggy" like.  Otherwise, would be fabulous. Next time I will make the sauce with my own waffle recipe.  Had for dinner and it was a nice change.

Followed waffle recipe verbatim but they came out having a chewy texture- not crisp with a soft inside. (I've altered cooking times, temperatures, and flour in order to remedy the chewy phenomenon- did not help)

Good, easy waffle recipe. The only problem I had with them is they got fairly soggy as soon as I took them out. I didn't make the "bananas foster" part but they were pretty good with just butter and syrup. May try a different recipe before coming back to this one.

couldnt sleep one morning so got up and made this recipe. None of us like bananas, so I skipped that step and was not planning on making the syrup, but my husband walked in, read the recipe and said he would like to try it... boy were we glad we did, it is so much better than the regular maple. I also subbed almond essence for the rum, and almonds for pecans.

I'm giving this 5 stars b/c the sauce is excellent.  Will make again and again and will use on ice cream, pancakes and whatever else I can think of as well.  I personally thought the waffles were too eggy for my tastes and would give the waffles a 3.5 if I could.  I did not have rum extract for the sauce so I used 3 tsp vanilla (for the entire amount of extract in the sauce).  The sauce was just amazing.

This was a huge hit!  Made it for Fathers Day and hubby (who is a Bananas Foster fan anyways) LOVED it.  As govdivagirl suggested, I also made the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup.  I also did not have any rum extract, so used Creme de Banana liquor instead.  Hubby was just glad that there was enough syrup left over so he can use it for topping icecream later.

The bananas foster syrup and the whipped cream topping were great. I will use a different waffle recipe next time. This batter is too thin and the waffles were limp; making them difficult to remove from the waffle maker without them tearing or breaking, also the waffles tasted too eggy.

These waffles turned out perfect. Only made the waffles. This was the first time I made Belgian waffles. My british spouse thought they were perfect, too. A very easy recipe that I will use again! Took one point away as they were a little eggy as others mentioned.

best thing ever!  If you really want to splurge, use vanilla ice cream or butter pecan ice cream instead of whipped cream.

Ran out of pecans and used almonds instead.  No Rum extract so I used Malibu Rum.  My boyfriend said these were the best waffles he's ever had.

These were SO AWESOME. My boyfriend's mom made these for us when we visited and I told her about the recipe. She used maple syrup instead of regular pancake syrup. But they turned out great! I cannot wait to have these again.

Very good recipe. I am not a big fan of rum, so no extract for me.  To lessen the sweetness next time I will omit the syrup. I also thing toasting the pecans slightly brings out some more flavor.One thing that I will add next time is a scoop of vanilla ice cream ontop of the waffle and then the banana mixture. Even though I would make a slight change to the recipe next time, it is still a 5 star breakfast/desert...thanks

Followed the recipe! Oh my goodness theses are great waffles. Cook time for me was 3 minutes and the waffle came out awesome! Depending on how sweet you like things be careful with sauce as it is very sweet. This is my go to for waffles from now on! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! This was so good! The only complaint from the family was that the waffles weren't as crispy as we like them. Will probably use a different waffle recipe and then make this banana sauce to go over them.

These were so delicious!! I followed the recipe to a "T" except that I didn't cook the pecans and waited to sprinkle them on at the end. Definitely a dessert for breakfast treat, and one that I will make again and again. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I think the rum extract measurement may be a bit off, or what I had was really strong because it over powered everything. Probably would have been 5 stars with half the rum extract, but as it all you could taste was the rum extract which smells awful and doesn't taste much better.

I picked up some prepare mix, which didn't make a difference. The sauce with the bananas were out of this world, and the whipped cream was a nice addition. Made this for the Queen on Mother's Day. It was a huge hit. I forgot the pecans.

I made this for my dad for his birthday. He loved them! I used slightly green bananas so they wouldn't break down and get smooshy-- this ended up being the right choice. I used half white whole wheat flour to give the pancake a little more body against all the sweet.  I would probably increase that next time, or even use a heartier grain/flour blend.

Sensational. Absolutely tasty. I used walnuts as that's what i had on hand, otherwise made as stated. Tried the waffle by itself, could definately see how others said it was "eggy". But with the topping, it was amazing. However, I must say that it was very rich and filling, 3/4 of one waffle was plenty serving for each of us. Made four waffles total. Might make it again because so yummy, but it was more of a special treat than a normal rotation.

So happy I found this recipe. I wanted a recipe for my Belgian waffle maker but didn't want one that required me to whip egg whites into peaks. I wanted something similar to a regular waffle but made in a belgian waffle machine. This fit the bill & was so excited to try it. I only made the waffle part, not bananas foster but will try it sometime. Made as written & waffles were perfect! Picky hubby & kids loved it too! It's a keeper & my go to recipe now. Highly recommend it, nice vanilla flavor.

Just made this to go over waffles I'd made yesterday (from a mix)  and frozen to save time. I altered it (no nuts, no rum extract, no cream), so that's why four stars. My hubby said when I served it that it looked like it could have been a picture in a menu, and it tasted great! I appreciate the fact that this makes restaurant quality food without all the artificial stuff.  I like to know what I'm eating.

Really sweet but my children loved it. Next time I would like to decrease or omit the rum extract since I'm not a big fan.

My grandson wanted waffles this morning and I found this recipe.  I only made the waffles and they were great! I have some left to pop in the toaster this week for breakfast.  I served them with sweetened triple berry mix from CostCo and whipped cream.  YUM!

Tastes awesome but it's a little rich for breakfast.  Would make a good dessert
