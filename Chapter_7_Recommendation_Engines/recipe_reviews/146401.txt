The cookies were great!  My husband totally ate three before they cooled off. I changed the recipe just a little by putting 3 cups of flour instead of 4 cups and used raisins instead of the paste.  They are a keeper  and will make them again .

WHOA! Making my own raisin paste in the blender was totally worth it! These things are the bomb--their consistency reminds me of my recipe for pumpkin cookies, but the flavor is totally different--sweet, fruity and I love it! I substituted the shortening w/ 1/2 coconut oil half vegan butter and it worked out fine. Great way to use my persimmons that were getting old :) thx!

THESE COOKIES ARE A LITTLE TASTE OF HEAVEN! I HAVE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE THEM BEFORE! I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE ALMOST EXACTLY, BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CHANGES. I USED MOSTLY ALL ORGANIC INGREDIENTS, INCLUDING THE PERSIMMONS AND RAISINS. I ALSO USED BROWN RICE FLOUR INSTEAD OF ALL PURPOSE. WHEN I MIXED EVERYTHING UP, THE DOUGH LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT NEED MORE FLOUR, SO I ADDED ABOUT 1/2 CUP OF ALL PURPOSE FLOUR AND ANOTHER 1/2 CUP OF BROWN RICE FLOUR. THE DOUGH WILL BE VERY STICKY. I ALSO ADDED ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF CHOPPED CANDIED GINGER. OH MY GOSH... YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THESE! THE FLAVOR IS INDESCRIBABLY GOOD, BUT I'LL TRY. I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE MILDLY SWEET WITH A LITTLE SPICY KICK TO THEM. THIS RECIPE IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

I used butter instead of shortening; 1/2 Brown Sugar and 1/2 molasses instead of white sugar, and added dried cranberries, substituted sesame seeds for walnuts, and added 2TBSP ginger.  Frosted with creme cheese frosting (1 brick of creme cheese, 1/2 cup of Amaretto, 3TBSp molasses, and 1/2 cup of powdered coconut milk.  VERY good.

I made these with very ripe Fuyu persimmons( 3Cups  total increased by 1C). I substituted brown sugar  for the white sugar,  used butter for shortening,made my own raisin paste (1 recipe of 1 1/2 C of rains soaked in boiling hot water, drain water after 10 min, pureed in mini-chopper- yields 1 C of raisin paste )  used only one cup of raisin paste. Subbed chopped pecans for walnuts, increased amount to 3C. I also added 1 tsp. of cloves along with other spices. Added 2C of dried cranberries. They turned out fabulous, the recipe has been shared with many!

I followed the recipe exactly except  used half the white sugar - it was perfect. Didn't think I needed so much sugar with the persimmons being sweet and then especially the raisin paste. I always cut sugar in half in all recipes as my husband and I do not like really sweet desserts. These cookies are really good and I will make them again. They are not a crisp cookie but more like a muffin texture, but excellent!

This recipe definitely deserves all the good ratings!  The only change I made was to swap raisins for white chocolate chips.  The cookie flavor was very good, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I was a little nervous while mixing in the dry ingredients, because it was extremely dry.  However, once I mixed in the persimmon, it suddenly became cookie dough.  Now I can't decide if I am willing to share!

Loved this recipe.  I replaced 1/2 c of the sugar with brown sugar and just used whole raisins.  I sprinkle them with powdered sugar while still warm!  Pecans instead of walnuts if you have them on hand.

These are so good.  My grandkids LOVE them.  ( but I have to admit, as picky as they are, they don’t know they are persimmon cookies.  We call them orange raisin cookies.

They took a lot longer to cook more like 18 to 20 minutes. They came out well, however if I were to make this recipe again I would add the persimmon pulp in with the wet ingredients and then add the dry ingredients. It was extremely difficult to mix up these cookies the way that it is written. I exchanged half of the white sugar with brown sugar and left out the raisins.

This truly is an old recipe, for it doesn’t have any commercial leavening agents. And it’s fantastic! I used unsalted butter and cut the sugar in half (the raisin paste makes them PLENTY sweet). They were a smash at the coffee klatch where I served them—the flavor is just amazing.

I used raisins instead of paste, though I am sure that the paste maybe better. I used half white sugar and the other half molasses and they were delicious!

Great recipe. Wasn't able to find raisin paste so I hydrated some raisins and chopped them up in a food processor.  I may try one less cup of flour to see if it will make a crisp cookie.

This was a very tasty cookie!  I made a couple of changes out of necessity:  I used raisins vs. raisin paste.   I also substituted 1 Cup of apple sauce for 1 Cup of the persimmons and increased the flour by 1/2 cup to compensate.  The result was a flavorfilled cakey cookie that was perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee!  My husband took a batch to work and told me they were such a hit, the plate was empty within minutes!

I followed the recipe except I made HIGH ALTITUDE changes.  I decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cup and upped the four to 2 1/4 cup.  Plus I added 1 T of water.  For the nuts i used a mixture of pecans and walnuts because that is what I had on hand.  Realy a cake like cookie.  Very good!  I will make again.  It took 5 persimmons to get the 2 cups of puree.

Used brown sugar instead of white and didn't put any nuts in (fiance had oral surgery recently so nuts are a no-go) and they turned out delicious! Will definitely make again and add the nuts in.

I am going to base my rating on my kids: One kid liked them, the other kid didn't. I couldn't eat them because I am gluten-free, but they sure smelled good. My daughter said they taste like fall. My son didn't like the walnuts, and I even made a batch without walnuts, and he didn't like those either.

These cookies are sooo good!  I made a huge batch before Christmas, mailed some to family then  put them in the freezer and forgot about them.  I found them in March took them to the office and I don't think I've ever had so many compliments on a batch of cookies!  Definitely will make some next time I am given persimmons!
