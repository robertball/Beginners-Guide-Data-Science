OH MY GOSH!! Bubba, you rocked my world.  This is sooo yummy, and very easy.  Remember to cook slowly, and be patient - it will get thick.  I took it to a family BBQ (of native Texans, no less) and everyone raved.  Can't wait to cook ribs with it.  This is my new favorite sauce!!

My God this sauce is fantastic!!  I followed the recipe with only one change...used fresh onion instead of onion powder. I used this sauce with the Amazing Ribs recipe from this site (as did many of my fellow reviewers) and have gained major status in my family....all of whom love BBQ. Thank you Bubba for one of the BEST recipes I've found here yet.

Very good I only made a couple of changes I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and chopped oinon for onion powder( I like the flavor of fresh onions and the longer the simmering the better. A real winner

Oooooooohhhhhh Bubba!!! This was everything I want a barbeque sauce to be. I used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt, and dried onion flakes instead of the onion powder, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I also simmered it on the stove for about 3 hours so it was nice and thick. I will be making this over and over and will probably not buy bottled sauce again. Thanks so much for a fine recipe!

I'm only giving this recipe a three, because I found it to be strangely sweet, but some of the folks I served it to said they really enjoyed it and like their sauce sweet.  If you like sweet bbq sauce, this is a good one.  This recipe is also heavy on ingredients, I had to thicken it with cornstarch.  I'm thinking a sauce with coca-cola in it isn't for me.  Worth a shot if you're a fan of sweet, not spicy bbq.

My adult family did not like this sauce.  At least, the way I used it.  I put it in a crockpot with a boneless chuck roast and cooked it on low for 12 hours.  No one liked it (my 31-yr. old son said it smelled like dog meat).  I wouldn't even make this for a grill.  I tried the crockpot because it's just too hot to BBQ outside and the store purchased sauces work well with slow cookers.

Great Recipe! Followed the recipe with two minor changes. 1. did not have savory so I left it out. 2. used Dr Pepper for the cola. For the hot sauce I used Srirachi. Turned out great!! Thanks Bubba!

This is the best BBQ sauce ever.  The only thing I change is I don't add the cider vinegar and I add a little honey to taste.  My husband and I NEVER buy BBQ sauce from the store.  This is too easy and all supplies are staples from the pantry.  You will never go wrong with this!

Hey, Bubba, you've got a winner here.  This is an absolute-best barbeque sauce!  I haven't found anything better---and I've been cooking for 55 years!  Though it might not be to some folks tastes, it fits us to a "T".  Thanks so much!

Great BBQ sauce Bubba!  I used this in my crockpot with Amazing Ribs (from this site) and it made them soo tasty!  My husband commented that the ribs turned out "the best ever" this time.  Thanks for a great & easy recipe!

VERY good sauce!! I scaled to 12 servings to try out. I cut back on the chili powder by 1/4 teaspoon. I did not have savory so I did not add it.  I cooked on low for 12 minutes. This sauce thickens up nicely when slightly cooled! Sweet, smoky and mild heat.  I'm partial to Big Al's BBQ sauce recipe, but this is a nice alternative.

Made it the first time exactly as written. To the first batch I had to add more brown sugar, salt and pepper to tame the vinegar. I skipped the Savory. On the second batch I made the following revisions for my own tastes:  Cut back on the cider vinegar from 1/2 to 1/4 c. You can always add more, but can't take away.... I ran out of molasses after the first batch but still had a bit left, and added some honey. Added 1 t. Paprika, some hot sauce and a few shakes of ground Black Pepper. This is a great basic recipe to create your own personalized version. Keep in mind that hot sauces contain vinegar as a main ingredient. Worchestershire is also mainly vinegar and there's a lot of it in this recipe, so start on the small side and add as needed ~ Thanks for the basic ingredients to make a great recipe!

This was really good and very simple!  I tasted it, and added the whole can of cola and just simmered it a bit longer.  It got rave reviews on the pulled pork and pulled elk sandwiches I made for a BBQ last night.

Thank you so much for posting this AWESOME recipe! This sauce is soooo much better than thing bottled. I had to make a few substitutions, but still FANTASTIC! As for making it in a crockpot I doubt I would try it that way, but rather cook my ingredients in the crockpot and the last hour add the sauce. Again, thanks for posting this recipe!

This sauce is fabulous!  Hot~sweet is a very good way to describe it.  I cooked my sauce for about 2 hrs. over low heat to reduce and thicken to my liking.  I used it on an already cooked pork roast and broiled it for about 15-20 min. turning and brushing with sauce frequently.  My husband and I absolutely loved it!  We thought it was better than the sauce used at one of our favorite Barbeque restaurants, Famous Dave's.

Excellent BBQ Sauce, I make as directed but omit the steak sauce and hot sauce.  The chili powder adds some heat and the steak sauce seems redundant with the 1/2 cup of worcestershire sauce.  I served this sauce along side a pig at a pig roast and recieved several compliments.

Spectacular. I used this recipe as part of a slow cooker recipe with chicken thighs and it was awesome. No doubt, it would work well with just about any meat. It never did get quite as thick as I like, but I may not have cooked it long enough. I could also have used a thickening agent like corn starch too. Addendum from 6/4/2011: I used this sauce for BBQ pork for sandwiches. I turned the heat down to below medium low and it finally thickened up, but took at least a couple of hours. Worth waiting for!

A little too tangy for me, but my family really liked it.  Next time I would cut back some of the vinegar.  I also didn't have any cola on hand, so I used beer.

I need the sauce ASAP, so I boiled it down until it was reduced and thicker- about 30 minutes.  

Perfect on my crock-pot ribs!

The only sub I made was liquid smoke for the mustard and a whole can of tomatoes for the sauce (about 1 and a half cups, not 1). This sauce benefits from a long slow reduction.  If you taste before you get it nice and thick it will not impress, but after.  Divine.

My variation of this sauce is still simmering on the stove, but having tasted it, I can already tell it's going to be wonderful.  I left most proportions as directed except for sweeteners.  Didn't have any steak sauce or savory, so made do with some crushed marjoram and a splash of orange juice.  Used dijon mustard instead of yellow, and 1/4 c. honey instead of the brown sugar; I'll check for sweetness later, and it's easier to add more than take it away.    This seems to have just the right amount of kick, so far seems to have just enough sweetness but not too much, and great depth of flavor.  Looks like a winner!  Thanks Bubba.

This is the best BBQ sauce I ever made, and I made hundreds trying to find one that my picky hubby likes. He just loves it. I did not have enough molasses, so I made up the difference with Karo syrup. I also used cherry Coke and added some liquid smoke. After making BBQ sauces for 20 years, I finally found a keeper. Hats off to Bubba.

Wow, this is fantastic!   I prefer a sweet/spicy rather than tangy, and I didn't have some ingredients so I made some changes.  Used a 15-oz can of tomatoes, drained and pureed instead of sauce, used no molasses, omitted chili pdr, hot pepper sauce, ground mustard and cider vinegar.  Added 2TB jalepeno jelly, pinch of inst coffee grounds,  3TB spicy mustard, 1 ts cayenne, 1/3 c. sugar and increased brown sugar to 3/4 c.
This sauce is hard to beat.

GREAT HOMEADE SAUCE. MAKES ABOUT 5 CUPS SO CUT IN HALF IF YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH.  HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SAVORY IS SO OMITTED, DIDN'T THINK IT WAS "HOT" JUST SWEET AND TANGY.

Wonderful sauce...I made a double batch and kicked it up a notch by adding a bottle of chili sauce instead of the 2nd cup of tomato sauce then I added 3/4 cup of Jack Daniels Old No. 7 Whiskey.  Also doubled the Hot sauce amount as I like my sauce spicy.  Fresh minced onion & garlic in place of powder & salt  make it a chunkier sauce.  I now call it "Bubba's Best Jack & Coke BBQ Sauce".

I used honey instead of molasses and 1/2 as much cayenne pepper instead of chili powder.  I also used fresh pressed garlic and minced sauteed onions instead.   Best sauce ever!!  Going to go great on my ribs tomorrow.  I let it simmer for a couple hours and is deliciously think!!  With my changes it's perfection.

Hey!! A while back I was cookin up a batch of ribs, and was lookin for  a great sauce! Lemme tell ya , this is it! Great combination of sweet and hot, and the Carbonated Beverage added a nice touch...I however never used as much of the Beverage that the recipe called for....But the sauce was awesome.

This is the best BBQ sauce.  My family just loves it.  I have made it so many times, I can't count.  You can take it up a notch by adding more hot sauce, if it is not hot enough.

This is an awesome recipe. I made ribs for my husbands birthday party and even people that said they didn't like beef ribs loved mine. I used the "Dry rub for ribs" recipe before BBQin', then added the BBQ sauce to last 10 minutes of grilling. Perfection, if I do say so myself.

This reminded me of KC Masterpiece but a bit sweeter.  I am not a huge fan of KC.  This sauce was okay.  It makes a canning jar full plus a little.  I will keep on looking.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars.

The best sauce ever!!! Not hot at all just a good mild sauce. Just go strictly by the cooking directions and you will be fine. To the lady that gave a bad rating saying that it was horrible. The recipe doesn't say pour over raw meat in a crock pot and expect the ingredients to just come together and taste right with raw meat  and blood cooking together. You ate a ding dong! No wonder! 
Anyways like I said go by instructions and you will love it! Also I couldn't find dried savory so I used italian seasoning in its place e because that's what it is really. Enjoy!!

I didn't know what SAVORY was? I went to three different stores and all three managers of those stores didn't know what it was either. I did find FRESH Savory in the produce department of Gelsons. It's next to the fresh herbs. www.gelsons.com

The sauce was great, we put it on babyback ribs!

Loved it! I used it with the top secret rub from this site as well. We try a variety of rubs and sauces, then smoke them and it tops my list. My hubby has other preferences though. He thought the sauce was good, but not his favorite.

One of the best BBQ sauce recipes ever.  I also add liquid smoke and select hot sauces to turn up the heat a tad.

I made the sauce in order to complement a pork shoulder. I usually like to try different sauces but this one grab my  eye because of the quick time to prepare. Most chefs will have all of the ingredients on hand,  I did not have any "steak sauce" so I did technically deviated from the recipe. My only subtle complaint is that in order to get the sauce to thicken up to a level that I like , I ended up simmering  closer to 40 minutes.   Some people would advocate for the addition of other thickeners such as corn starch or gelatin, but I was willing to leave it on the stove for twice the time recommended with excellent results. The biggest critics, my two, six and eight-year-old all enjoyed the sauce because it was not too spicy.

This is a really tasty sauce and easy to make. I baked my baby back ribs with salt and pepper and a little garlic powder very slowly on low for a couple hours then finished them off on the the grill adding the sauce toward the end. I used poultry seasoning instead of savory which I did not have, chopped onion and garlic powder. I added more hot sauce (Cho lu la)
And a touch of cayenne. Really good! Family loved it:-)

It has a nice sweet taste but needs more heat.  I simmered it down to a nice consistency but it came out with very dry taste.  I'm not sure how to cut out the dryness.

A great bbq sauce! Thick and sweet with a little heat. My family really liked it. It tastes like a sauce we had at a favorite bbq place. I will definitely will make it again.

Very good but I did change it up, substituted real maple syrup for cola, added fresh chopped onion, garlic instead of powder and salts, added a Serano pepper in place of Cayan pepper and chilli powder.  Outcome is fantastic, sweet at first then a little heat

For some reason mine wasn't sweet at all, okay a little bit, but more tangy than anything else. I added an extra 1/2 cup of molassis and some brown sugar and only slightly altered the taste. Perhaps next time I will reduce the vinegar and see if it is any better. Making crockpot rips it is just too entirely expensive to buy that much bbq sauce from the store, so I will keep an eye out for a new one, but use this in the mean time.

Holy moly! Was this good!!! I've never made my own BBQ sauce before, and now I don't think I will ever buy it again! Soooooo good! I had to thicken it with a little water and corn starch at the end. This will be my go to BBQ sauce from now on. Thanks Bubba! :)
