My boyfriend and I love this dish.  I make a little differently though, I subsituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom, and I mix in a bit of sour cream to the soup mixture instead of wine, it makes it a bit creamier.

I made this recipe for Christmas for a guest who only eats chicken. I made a few modifications and it was great. First I rubbed each chicken breast with a tablesoon of dijon mustard. This gave it so much flavor. Then after 40 minutes of baking I poured a small can of chicken broth over the whole dish. Then finished off the baking. There was still crunchy stuffing but it made it less like croutons. It was so good. You really don't taste the cheese so next time I will either use more or just leave it out.

It actually was very good - although I had hoped that the stuffing would soften up. I might have preferred it if it was soft as opposed to crunchy.  Maybe I'll try it again with the stuffing "made".

Not bad, just not really good either. I stayed very close to the recipe only switching out chicken broth for the wine. My husbad and I thought it was alright but my 3 little ones would hardly eat any of it. For that reason, I won't be making it again.

My husband likes stuffing a little crunchy and it turned out that way but if you prefer mushy stuffing just mix everything right after you pull it out of the oven and it will soften in no time.

This recipe did not work out well for me.  The stuffing was too hard and dry.  I would prefer to pour the sauce over the stuffing instead of over the chicken.

Okay, I bought the stuffing mix but no seasoning packet, bought Stove Top Stuff, low sodium. With the cheese, canned soup and stuffing, there was plenty of salt, very good flavor, used part cr/chick soup along with cr/mush, very good. I would rate it comfort food on a cold day.

I would make this again.  I might try cooking it at 350 instead of 325 as it took 1hr 15 min to cook fully at 325.  Also I mixed the stuffing into the soup/wine at the 1hr mark as it looked very dry & this worked perfectly.  I didn't find it oo salty with all the seasoning either.

This was good - I wanted a reason to use up my extra box of stuffing in the pantry. I didn't find it too salty. We used one chicken thigh and three breast halves and had great success.

This is a "right quick and down" way to come up with a filling, satisfying and welcome mealyour qhole family will savour and request again. Pay special attention to the Sodium content of the flavouring packets. Bobbi is correct, too much salt means a really nasty course on the table.

CM

This was a good dish. My family enjoyed it. But, the stuffing mix that was on the top didn't soften very much. So we just kind of scraped it off the top and ate the rest. Of course that might have been my fault...

I found this works perfect in the crock pot.  Just put the chicken, cream of chicken,and wine in the crock pot.  I added pepper, garlic and onion powder into the pot as well and then left it on low for 8 hours.  I added the stuffing (stove top) an hour before dinner.  I stirred it twice in that hour, add a little more liquid if stove top is dry.

I too bought Stove Top and it did not come with a seasoning packet. So I sauteed onions, celery and sage in butter and mixed it with the stuffing and 1/2 can of chicken broth instead of wine. I cut the chicken in bite size pieces and mixed with a can of cream of chicken and 1 cup milk. I put the chicken mixture in an 8 x 8 casserole, sprinkled the grated cheese and topped with the stuffing mixture. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Stuffing was golden brown and crunchy, just the way DH likes it. Will make again.

I made this for my family for the first time and even the kids ate it.  I did add fresh mushrooms and seasoned the chicken breast.  I did have to cook it a little longer as the chicken breast were fairly good sized.
