I've made this many times and have tried with different cheese combinations.  Last Thanksgiving I made it and no one could tell I used Barillo GF pasta.  Dish always empty (even when other mac and cheese dishes offered at pot lucks).  I always hear raves.   My crowd loves it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Blue ribbon! Very tasty mix of cheeses and I just loved the bacon...so much I doubled it. I used corn based elbows and they were perfect. The pasta didn't turn to mush holding its shape just like regular pasta. Only thing I did not follow was that I cheated and mixed up the cheese sauce in the microwave. I think I'll add jalapeños next time. Thank you TRH333 for your recipe.

I couldn't find the cheeses it required so I improvised and used shredded cheese pepperjack, cheddar, and 5cheese blend. It was awesome!!!

I was drawn to this recipe because of the fact it’s gluten free. I followed the recipe with similar cheeses ( I used what I had) and I didn’t use bacon. I used 16 oz pkg if Tinkyada elbow pasta and rinsed in cold water as the directions indicate. This turned out wonderfully and I would make again. I’ve tried many gluten free Mac and cheeses and this is very straight forward and was the best I’ve made. The guinea pigs in my fam who don’t follow GF were very happy.

This was my first attempt at a gluten free macaroni and cheese.  Was cutting recipe in half and did not use enough liquid. I should have used more than half of the whipping cream.  Now I've learned a lot.  The flavor was the best with the bacon added in.  I did use the full amount of cheese for just 8 oz of pasta.  I would recommend this recipe even if gluten was not a concern.  Just wished it was a little creamer.  Did not realize gluten free pasta would absorb as much cream.  Next time I will add milk to this recipe.

It was good. We are new to gf recipes so getting use to the noodle consistency is difficult. Very cheesy sure.  Just remember gluten free doesn’t always mean healthy

The only thing I changed was using a mix of evaporated milk & coconut milk instead of half & half (it's what I had on hand), cooked the organic bronze-cut, pipe rigate pasta, al dente, allowing it to soak up the excess liquid. Topped with buttered homemade gluten free breadcrumbs and baked 30 minutes. The mixture of these cheeses is superb! My go to for those guilty cravings from now on!! Wonderful!

Followed the recipe exactly. Way too fattening and not very healthy with all that whipping cream and bacon. With all those different cheeses the sodium content is through the roof. Will not be making this again.

Made this for my mom who is gluten free. My husband and boys loved it and they normally hate gluten free recipes. I did not make any changes to the recipe except I could not find macaroni at the store and so I used rotini which was perfect! Often baked macaroni is not my kids favorite because it ends up being more condensed without any cheese sauce. This recipe, although baked, has a lovely consistency. Very rich, saucy and flavorful. It would still be excellent with a regular pasta.

This is a hit every time I make it !  Old, young, men, women, children...there's never any leftovers, even when I double it.  Fool-proof and delicious.  After making it once I tried adding an extra cup of cream and a few more slices (I used 10 thick cut slices) of bacon.  I also sprinkled a little (about 1-2 tsp) of dried oregano.

Fantastic. My family loved it and and my men did not even realize I used brown rice based gluten free elbow macaroni. I used corn free Simply Heinze Ketchup but otherwise a definite "DO-OVER" in my household.

We used cavatappi pasta instead of elbow. It was a great recipe. It takes some work if you shred your own cheese. It was a big hit for Thanksgiving dinner.

Very good macaroni and cheese recipe. I loved it and I dont like regular macaroni and cheese. We used the gluten free noodles to make this a gluten free recipe.

Great base recipe. My husband and I made this together. The only change we made was using a four cheese blend instead of the three individual types of cheese, as it's what we had on hand. I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll add more cheese to the cream sauce and use less for the topping.
