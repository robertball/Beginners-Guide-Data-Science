This was awesome. I combined this recipe with some from other sites. I omitted the Fontina used fresh grated Parmesan. I also added sun-dried tomatoes, which I feel really added to the taste. I used Pillsbury ready-made dough, which made it really easy and made the cornmeal unnecessary. Next time I might add some mushrooms and/or red pepper flakes. So good!

DELICIOUS! I had baby red potatoes on hand, so I used those and an Italian cheese blend instead og the Fontina. I made grilled dough, so when it was done, I placed it on a cookie sheet and topped it w/ the toppings and then baked until done. Oh, and I used homemade peasto and I think that makes a huge difference... Great flavors! I made small pizzas and that worked out well. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum! I followed his direction but I didn't have feta so I went ahead without it. It was a crispy delicious recipe.
