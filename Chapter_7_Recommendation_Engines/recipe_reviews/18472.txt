Great, but without the extra pineapple on top, too. That makes it a little too much. Very good with a shortbread crust instead of graham cracker.

This is a summertime favorite! Quick and easy to prepare.  I like to dress it up with mandarin orange slices and marashchino cherries on top.  I also have made this with low fat cream cheese and splenda (no one knew the difference...sssshhh)  I have also added coconut.... every time it comes out wonderful!!

Very easy and very tasty. I didn't have any crushed pineapple so I used a can of chunk pineapple...threw it in the food processor. It amounted to a very tiny amount of pineapple after I squeezed out all the water, so I used a second can of chunk pineapple thrown in the food processor. The key is to squeeze the pineapple so you have as little liquid as possible. It turned out great, and I made no changes to the recipe.

I made this for my dad on Father's Day. I got 3 calls to tell me how great this recipe was. It was so super easy too. This one is definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for sharing! Update- I offered to make my Mom her favorite cake for her birthday which just past. Instead she ask for this! My whole family raves about this one. So easy and yummy! Thanks again!

This can be made (and not much notice taken, I may add) with reduced fat or fat free cream cheese, Splenda, and "free" whipped topping. This is also good with a half cup or so of toasted coconut sprinkled over the top. Excellent dessert for a Girls Night In!

I made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  All the previous comments were helpful.  

I made the following changes:
Used 2 - 8 oz. packages cream cheese
Reduced the sugar slightly
Used 1 - 20 oz. can crushed pineapple - very well drained
Used 1 - 12 oz. container Cool Whip, thawed
Added 1 cup coconut
Used a prepared shortbread crust

Didn't put the crushed pineapple on top but did serve the pie with fresh pineaple and strawberries in the side.

The mixture was very thick so I was able to mount it high in the crust.  I would really call this a Pineapple Cheesecake Pie.

This looks very pretty when done and holds together fine... I did use a bit extra cream cheese. (If you have trouble getting it to stay firm enough... be sure to drain your pineapple REALLY well.) Has a very sweet taste though, not what we expected. Not sure if I'll make this again, wasn't really what I was looking for. (BUT as a side note... think it would be great as a square instead of cake.)

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not come out runny at all.  It would be a perfect dessert for a summer occassion as it is so light and fruity. Will definitely make this one again.

My guests loved this easy dessert.  I only used one can of crushed pineapple, but I used an additional 8oz package of cream cheese.  I used the 1/3 fat cream cheese as well and it set up beautifully.  Next time I think I might use cherries instead of pineapple.

Great taste! I used 12 oz of lite cream cheese, 1/2 cup Splenda, and I squeezed the pineapple in a piece of cheesecloth to drain it!

This was not very good as far as a cheesecake.  I only used one can of pineapples and mine did not set like a cheesecake.  It came out looking and tasting more like pineapple coolwhip with a crust.  Don't think I will make again.

I crushed 1 & 1/2 packs of graham crackers & mixed with 1/2 stick melted butter for patting into a no-stick sprayed 13" x 9" casserole dish. Then, I replaced the sugar with a large box of sugar-fee vanilla pudding, & mixed the juice right into the batter. I then folded in an 8 oz. tub of whipped cream. It could have used some shredded coconut, but it still passed. ;~)

The flavor is good, but I wouldn't call it a cheese cake because it is too runny.  I had a deep dish pie plate so I used two packages of cream cheese and made my own whipped cream which was nice and stiff, but it was still very soft. I will make it again, but with less whipped topping.

I only gave 4 stars because it actually makes 2 pies not one and I had too much left over. I substituted for fat free cream cheese and fat free cool whip. it tastes awesome and is a little runny, but not too bad. will buy 2 crusts next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe - thanks so much for sharing.  He is very picky about his cheescake and loved this.  I used powdered sugar and left off the extra pineapple as some suggested.  Just an extra scoop of whipped topping.

My husband really enjoyed this but I thought this cheesecake was a little too sweet and it was kind of runny as well. I couldn't get much of any kind of firmness out of it. My husband agrees with the runniness but loves the flavor so I decided to give it 3 stars.

This recipe came out really good. I didn't have graham cracker crust, so I took someone else's advice and used a shortbread cookie recipe. I changed up the pineapple part just a bit. Instead of using two 15 oz. cans of crushed pineapple, I used only one 20 oz. can. I added the entire can in the cheesecake mixture and it came out amazing! I didn't use any extra for garnish. 

The secret to not have a runny cheesecake mix is to drain the pineapple EXTREMELY well. I even went so far as to push clean hands into the pineapple, against the strainer, to squeeze even more juice out of the pineapple. I saved the juice; I will make fruit smoothies out of it :)

My Mother has been making this recipe since the 1970's.  She drains the pineapple really well and uses only one can of pineapple and Dream Whip.  She then puts it in the freezer after making it for an hour to really get it cold.  It is our families favorite dessert!

For the same great taste, but with only 209 calories per serving (8 servings per pie) I used fat free cream cheese, fat free whipped topping, and splenda rather than the listed full fat counterparts and it still came out great! I also added one sliced banana to the top for a great combo. (Without the banana it's about 196 calories). I also did not use the second can of pineapple and think I will add another half of cream cheese to make it less runny. Lastly I drained the pineapple before adding it and recommend blending the sugar, cream cheese, and whip topping until smooth before adding the pineapple.

Easy, peazy. Used small tub cool whip with 1/2+ folded in and the test on top. I used only 1 can very well drained pineapple in pie.

I made this according to the recipe and it is very good, so in MY opinion the recipe stands on it's own as written. However, I was wanting something more so I added some coconut and pecans. I would be happy to eat this cheese pie with or without my additions.

I needed to use up a couple cans of chunk pineapple that were taking up room in my pantry so I decided to try this recipe. Instead of a prepared crust I made my own; I mixed a couple packages of crushed graham crackers with butter, pressed into a square springform and baked for about 10mins. When making the cream cheese mixture, I used a blender to chop up the pineapple and then a cheesecloth to squeeze out all the liquid. The mixture turned out beautiful-pretty firm even before refrigeration. Very simple and delicious recipe.

I took the advice of the comments and did not buy an extra can of pineapple as topping. However, I used 2 cups of Cool Whip to help combat the juice in the can of pineapple. (let's face it, we can't drain it all). I also topped the cake with toasted coconut, and a pinch of leftover pineapple in the very center.

This is the fastes and easiet cheese cake to make and it taste wonderful.  So light and airy. I use a twenty once can of pineapples put most in filling and used rest on top.  Make sure you drain pinepples good because it will make cake runny.

I made this based on review and did not use the 2 cans of drained crushed pineapple. Not enough pineapple flavor! Good creaminess and texture but needed more flavor. Will make again but use the 2 cans pineapple suggested.
