I always feel bad rating things that I changed, but since there was only one rating I thought I would give my two cents. 
Only two changes: I used cherries instead of raspberries so it wouldn't be too tart. I also sprinkled a bit of flour and cinnamon with the fruit to make it thicker.  
It was yummy! The top didn't get crispy at all, but was still good.

The crumble topping is amazing and I would give five stars to the crumble alone!  The filling is where I had some problems.   The raspberries and nectarines are slightly tart, so, only using 2 tbsp. of sugar left for a more tart filling that I would have preferred.  There is also no thickener in the filling other than the natural pectin in the fruit.  The filling was very runny.  I would have preferred a thicker sauce with the fruit. 7/7/18 My review above was based on when we ate the dessert the same day we made it. Today I upped it from 3 to 4 stars.  The flavors melded together and wasnâ€™t nearly as tart as it was yesterday.  I do still think the sauce is a little thin for us and I would add a little thickner.
