This is not  your ordinary strawberry-banana smoothie (and I've had my  share of them).  The addition of orange juice really complemented the berries and banana, and the yogurt made it creamy without having excess tang, as yogurt often does to a smoothie.  It was a little thin after blending, so I did add more ice to reach the consistency I like and bumped up just a bit the amount of strawberries and banana.  This is my first time using Truvia, and what a pleasant surprise to find no aftertaste as you often have with reduced-calorie sweeteners.  Florida's peak strawberry crop will be in season very soon, and I feel certain many of these smoothies will be made during the next few months. This is a star nutritionally, but it's going into my Favorites folder simply because it's awesome tasting!

The orange juice was a bit overwhelming so I used 3 bananas and 2 cups of strawberries.  My family liked it but next time I would also decrease the orange juice to half a cup as well as triple the fruit.   Overall a great recipe and I would definitely make this again!!!

I made this with frozen fruit, so I didn't need the ice. Also, it was plenty sweet, so I didn't use the Truvia either. Delicious and refreshing! The orange juice seemed to "brighten" the taste and make it more refreshing than most smoothies I have had.

I loved this. I used vanilla Greek yogurt and skipped the sugar substitute. It was wonderful, my kids loved it!

Good smoothie. Left out OJ as that would have too sweet. Added 3-4 packs of Truvia.
