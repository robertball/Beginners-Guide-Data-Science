I made this recipe in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I let the yeast bloom with the warm liquids and sugar in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the other ingredients. I accidentally omitted the baking soda only because I overlooked it. This dough needed an additional 1/4 cup flour to form into a solid ball. I then kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. After the second rise, I rolled the dough into heaping 1/4 cup balls and plopped them into the greased cast iron skillet. I did not use the cornmeal only because I didn't have any. I got TEN rolls out of one recipe, not 24. This was my first time baking rolls in a cast iron skillet and they turned out FABULOUSLY. I was telling my husband these rolls reminded me of the school cafeteria rolls we got with our lunches when I was in grade school. They were light and fluffy and just wonderful. This absolutely was a success. Now I know how easy it is, this is a recipe I will use on a regular basis. I feel like a cooking rockstar!

This is my go-to rolls recipe now, the recipe is very flexible. I've made it a couple of times and it hasn't failed. The first time I made them I stuck to the recipe. Second time around, I didn't have enough all-purpose flour so I used about 1/4C all purpose and cake flour for the rest, this yielded a much softer roll. I made them today again, and I used 2C all purpose, 1 1/2C cake flour and 1C whole wheat flour I whipped the egg-buttermilk mixture until it had increased in volume slighty and the result was again a very soft tender roll.
They don't have to be done in the skillet (I did mine in a 9x13) and you can vary the size, I did 16 today and those are big enough to maybe make a sandwich.
Deeeeeelllliiiccciioouusss!!!

Great recipe--these rolls rose beautifully, have a wonderfully moist, tender texture, and are very flavorful. I used a Kitchenaid to mix the dough, which was very elastic--a joy to knead! I used less salt, but did not change another thing about the recipe. I could only get 19 rolls in my 12 inch cast-iron skillet, so I made the rest of the dough into a dozen small cinnamon rolls. I forgot to put cornmeal in the pan, but they were fine without it. I waited till they were baked before I drizzled butter. These go into the 5-star folder of my recipe box! Thanks Susan!

These rolls were really good! I would, however, change a couple of things next time I make them. 1) To me, they were a bit too sweet, so I would cut the amount of sugar in half next time, and 2) more flour was needed during the kneading process than what the recipe mentions. I ended up using quite a bit more flour by the time the kneading process was over, due to the stickiness of the dough. Otherwise, these were really, really wonderful.

Wonderful recipe!  I had no trouble with them rising and they cooked perfectly in my cast iron skillet.  Paired with a bowl of homemade soup, it was a nice wholesome supper.  Ate the rest for breakfast in the morning with jelly.

This recipe was a huge hit in my house on Thanksgiving day!  I have only baked with yeast a few times so I was nervous about how well I would do with these.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was extremely easy!  The flavor was wonderful and my family told me this recipe is now expected on all holidays!  Thanks so much for sharing!

These look awesome and I am anxious to try them, however the time does not seem to jive with the direction.  Total time is 45 minutes but rise time alone is "about an hour."  Look out dinner!

I just love these rolls. I did "cheat" when making the dough. I put all the dough ingredients in my bread machine and used the dough cycle, then formed into 16 rolls. Used a cast iron skillet and let rise as directed and baked 20 minutes. These were easy to make and very tasty. I will definitly make again. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I make rolls all the time and lost my usual recipe so I tried this. I followed the recipe to the T. They were not awful but they weren't good either. Yes they were soft but the flavor was not good at all. I would only recommend making these if you are using them to "sop" up something with flavor or using jam.

I just took these out of the oven and they are fabulous - so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of not doing the cornmal thing, and got about 12 rolls into my cast iron skillet, plus a small loaf on the side.  These are my new 'go-to' rolls.

I loved these rolls. Next time I make them I am going to leave out the corn meal on the bottom of the pan My husband suggested we put some cheese in the center of each dough ball for a cheesey center

These were great and loved the crunchy cornmeal bottom. Easy to make and my kids ate them up. Would make again.

Absolutely beautiful dough and a true pleasure to work with.  Unfortunately, as noted by Libertybelle, they had no flavor.  Period.  And I mean *no* flavor.  Huge, soft, fluffy, lovely texture, but there was nothing there !?!  I've never tasted anything like them before.  We did smother with butter & jam and as submitter noted - they were fine then, but only as a vessel to carry the taste of butter & jam.  Will diligently search for someway of making these tastier as I've never worked with such a beautiful dough before.  So so sorry.  Note to self, I did make 10 3oz balls ... too large;  cut in half next time.  Maybe that will make a difference...
