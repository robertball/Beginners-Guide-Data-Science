These muffins are sooooo good!  I took everyones advice and added 1/4 cup more sugar and left out the lemon zest and used frozen blueberries.  I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking for 20 min.  They came out so moist and delicious.  My son and I ate 8 of them as soon as they were done baking.  I kept burning my mouth on them.  LOL.  They were still moist the next day.  I can't wait to make them again since there are none left.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I doubled the sugar (and used honey instead), added some vanilla extract and used whole wheat flour instead of white as well as soy milk instead of regular
I also left out the lemon zest.

We ate the entire pan of them within the evening!!!! They were great and easy to make.

I made these this morning, and they turned out really good. I used the splenda baking sugar, so I kept it to a half cup. If I used regular sugar, I'd probably increase it to 3/4 cup. I also used a tsp of vanilla extract instead of lemon zest, and took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top before baking. Turned out delicious!

Very nice. In consideration of other reviews stating that more sugar was needed, I substituted 1 cup of vanilla yogurt for the milk. I also added a couple of tablespoons of milk as I mixed up the batter just to get to a workable consistency. The flavor and sugar in the yogurt was just the right touch.

Incredibly quick and easy to make, and wonderful taste!!! Everybody loves them from the first bite! the only thing I changed was double amount of sugar, a bit of vanilla and no lemon zest. It works out every time, delicious with cherries as well :) Thanks to this recipe I became a queen of muffins :)

I found these muffins to be a little bit on the dry side.  I added some cinnamon to them and it added a nice flavor.  These are best when served warm out of the oven.  Nice when accompanied by a cup of coffee or tea.

This was my first time making blueberry muffins from scratch :) I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the amount of sugar. I also left in the lemon zest, which I think added some brightness to the flavour. I also used a whole pint of blueberries. Overall, a simple and flavourful recipe which I will use again and again :)

great muffins. I added extra blueberry's, and used about 3/4 a cup brown sugar because I didn't have white sugar, and I didn't do the lemon zest. still awesome. I'll definitely make again.

I tried several Blueberry Muffin recipes from All Recipes and these were by FAR the best ones.  I did not add more sugar like a lot of people did and I thought they were sweet enough.  Thanks for a great muffin.

Perfect, old fashioned muffins! I am gobbling them down as we speak, with a mug of hot tea! I use spelt - no problem! Mixed frozen berries - still fab! I even finished them the way we did in 'home ec' (does anybody know what that means? ;) )  once baked, I dipped them in melted butter, than granulated sugar. MMmmmmm!

These turned out so good! The only things that I did different were to use a few squirts of lemon juice instead of lemon zest (Didn't have any) and I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on half of the muffins prior to baking. They turned out fantastic! Definitely a keeper.

I found this recipe VERY dry.  I used the other peoples comments.  I added 1/4 cup more sugar, i reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cups and i added one more egg.  after that, the recipe turned out fine.  Maybe its just me because everyone else enjoyed them, but i felt like my adjustment worked out much better.

I followed some advice and changed a few things myself.   I used 3/4 cup sugar and also added 1/4 brown sugar. I used vanilla instead of lemon zest, but added 2 teaspoons. I added a little cinnamon to the recipe as well as on top. I also wait till the end to add the blueberries and used a mixer for the rest of it. I cooked them at 375 like someone had suggested, cooked them just till they were golden brown! They are AMAZING!! First time making blueberry muffins and glad I found such an easy recipe!! This one will definitely go in my cook book to make again! Just pop them in the microwave for 20 second and heat them up again and they are wonderful!! Thank you to everyone!

Simply Outstanding! As with everyone else, I added the extra sugar... I also used frozen berry mix, thawed and drained, but not rinsed. That made them extra moist!  I didn't add the zest, but did add a teaspoon of cinnamon. Very easy to make, even in a very small kitchen by an absolute rookie.

Use the lemon zest! It's an excellent contrast in taste to the blueberries. I don't know why anyone would want to leave them out. I also added a bit more sugar; more than 1/4 of a cup would give it more of a cake consistency, which I don't like. I like muffins to be muffins!

I really loved this recipe, eventhough I was kinda confuse as if I was gonna use a mixer or not. Well I just stirred all liquids in  a bowl ...had my brother stir all dry ingredients w blueberries w his hands, then I just poured teh wet ingredients and used a spatula to mix all together. I used 2/3 c of sugar , oh yeah and added vanilla, which i put just a bit too much which the wet ingredients looked liek chocolate but still the muffins came out delicioius...the sweetness was just perfect.. when I filled teh baking cups I sprinkled sugar on top so they would come out crunchy!!! Which that was very tasty ...I recommend you baking this recipe, dont be afraid!!!! Have Fun !!! :)

I also increased sugar and blueberries to 1 cup.  These are very easy to make and taste great.  I also topped with raw sugar before baking.  Will definitely keep this recipe for the next time I make Blueberry Muffins.  Will never use boxed mix again!

These muffins are fantastic!! I added orange zest instead. I also allowed frozen berries to thaw first and discarded excess juice before adding to the mix.

This recipe is a keeper in my house. As another reviewer suggested, I added an extra 1/4 cup sugar. The muffins were moist and delicious!

i doubled the recipe and found it to be great as we loved it the first time i made it. however i had to make following adjustments:  -frozen mini blueberries (worked great lotsa berries in each muffin!)  -in doubled recipe extra 1 cup milk (batter would not mix unless i added it!)  -added streusel to top of muffins  -left out lemon as no lemon in house  also i would not recommend muffin cups as muffin stuck to cups when you peeled them off while warm you had to let them get cold first and microwave to have a whole muffin  all in all i loved this recipe it was sweet and moist like i get from cake and that was without the extra sugar! (with and without the streusel!)  give it a try!

Used frozen mixed berries instead of just blueberries and they turned out great! The only other change was I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, thats just my taste preference. Unlike other reviewers, I did not add more sugar, because I do not like sweet things, so these were perfect for me. However, I can see why people would double the sugar if they prefer more sweetness. What a great and easy recipe!!!

I changed the recipe a little bit by adding a cup a milk instead of 3/4 c, 3/4 c sugar, extra berries, tsp cinnamon, tsp of vanilla and definitly add the lemon zest! Slightly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Bake for 20 min. at 390degrees!

I don't get it?  Maybe I did something wrong, or just expected different than others but I followed the recipe EXACTLY and in my opinion they were strange.  To be honest the consistency was more of a 'biscuit' than a muffin (super thick batter, and more ‘flaky’ than moist).  They tasted alright, however definitely need more sugar as others suggested.  Obviously others loved them so it must jut be a matter of taste.  I just thought it was weird that they turned out like they did, was expecting much better.

I thought these muffins were very moist and tasty. I doubled the recipe, skipped the lemon zest, and topped each one with a little cinnamon and sugar before putting into the oven. They turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent muffins! Very moist and delicious, even for the next two days. I also froze some and they thawed beautifully. I increased sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1 cup frozen assorted berries (raspberries, blueberries, blackberries).

I made this recipe last night.  let them sit in the pan overnight, and had them in the morning when my wife came home from working a twelve hour shift.  Even she said they were "Really, really GOOD!"

Theny were easy to make.  I had no trouble making them, with one hand holding a squirming 14 month old baby.

They were quite bland, they need more sugar, however they had a good texture and I used a 1/2 cup more blueberries and left out the lemon zest.

I love these muffins!  This recipe is good the way it’s written, and it can easily be altered for personal preference. I’ve made them several times with a little vanilla, with  and without the lemon zest, and with and without extra sugar. My husband prefers them without lemon zest and no extra sugar.  I prefer them with an extra 1/4 cup sugar, with the lemon zest.  Sometimes I juice the leftover lemon, add powdered sugar to the juice, and glaze the muffins when they’ve cooled a bit.

Great recipe .. Very easy to make. As per other suggestions, I added more sugar. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, also tossed the berries in white sugar to help them keep their shape. Also left out the lemon zest, and overfilled the cups [made 10 instead of 12]

I just loved this recipe!  I've tried many blueberry muffin recipes only to be disappointed. I love the way they bake high on top and just the right amount of crispiness outside and moist on the inside.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.

I was dissappointed.  I didn't have lemon zest, so I used a dash of lemon juice instead and DID NOT, as other reviewers have recommended, use double the amount of sugar.  I should have though.  These muffins are bland.  I also used frozen blueberries.  I recommend fresh ones.

These were SO good! My family and I gobbled up all 12 in no time! They were moist on the inside and crispy on top. I was worried when I saw that other reviewers doubled the sugar, thinking they would be too sweet, but I did double it and the muffins were the perfect sweetness. Definitely do NOT leave out the lemon zest; the tang balances the sweetness of the blueberries and gives the muffins an extra something!

i love this recipe! i made slight changes to suit my taste. i used frozen blackberries.i put 1 cup of sugar over a 12 oz bag. let them sit in fridge for a day. when i made the batter i cut down on the milk by a 1/4 cup. i emptied blackberries, juice and all. added 1/4 tsp of vanilla.it adds depth to taste.and to those who dont like this recipe because the muffins burned, you need to watch what your cooking. ovens dont always heat the same.

Good blueberry muffins. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and sucanat instead of sugar for a healthier version of a morning classic, and they were yummy. I also had little bits of different frozen berries left, so they were "mixed berry" rather than just blueberry. Any berry substitution will work well here.

I loved this easy recipe.  I must have thrown my muffin pan out.  So I used (4)small loaf pans.  Worked great. I did add 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon instead of the lemon zest. Also the fresh blueberries I used were hugh, next time I will only need 1/2 cup of the berries. I will make these again and again! Thank you for this fine recipe!

very easy, quick and simple. I would however add more sugar as 1/2cup was not sweet enough really. blueberries worked great but cranberries were even better! use dried apricots and cranberries for lots of flavor and smiles too.

Awesome and eZ!! I used almond milk instead of regular, no lemon zest, a pinch of cinnamon,  cooked for 25 minutes. These are perfect if your not a super sweet person but still want a little bit of sweetness! An after school delight to make with friends or on your own to enjoy with family! I do recommend if you’re a normal person to add a 1/4 cup more sugar if you want a muffin because it tastes like more of a blueberry 
scone to me. 100 percent recommend!! Easy as making eggs!!!!! 
Try it for yourself!

Definitely going to remake these again! I loved it as it was. I unfortunately did not have lemons for zesting, but i did have lemon juice. So i added a small splash of it, as i know the acidity of lemons compliments blueberry muffins really well. I found it the perfect sweetness. Only other difference was that i had frozen blueberries (which make no difference other than cooking time). 
Kid approved, most of the muffins are already gone before cooled.

This is a wonderful recipe to make with any kind of fruit. I used 1/2 cup white and a 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added atsp vanilla and because I made it with finely diced apples, a tsp cinnamon. I used four apples and processed them into very fine pieces. I baked them at 375 f for twenty minutes and they turned out perfect. I got twelve big muffins from it. I will definitely make these again.

This has become my go to blueberry muffin recipe. All I change is I use whole wheat pastry flour, half-and-half instead of milk, and light brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it perfect.
I did not find it dry as others reported.  I know some cooks added sugar and more blueberries - but those are not needed.
If you are a fan of the big, extremely moist, overly sweet muffins found in the typical grocery store bakery, this recipe is not for you!

As is it's okay. They cook nicely but I was in a rush so I didnt read the comments as usually so didnt add the extra sugar, which would have made them more like muffins. As is they are more like scones, but still good!

So moist and yummy!! I used frozen blueberries as that's what I had. I tossed them in the flour right before mixing into the wet ingredients so they didn't thaw out and turn my batter purple. I sprinkle a little sugar on the top before baking to give them a sweet crunchy muffin top! Definitely keeping this recipe as it is also a great versatile recipe to use any berries or additions to change it up!

Perfect! Notes: I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice for added flavor and subbed in Truvia instead of sugar - follow the conversion chart on the Truvia package. I used fresh blueberries. I baked these in mini muffin tins. Adjust baking time to 15 minutes.

I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup per recipe of each macadamia nuts and dried blueberries. I used lemon extract instead off zest. 
Next time I will use HALF as much nuts and fruit and definitely use zest. I kept the sugar amt the same.

These blueberry muffins turned out light and fluffy!  They were certainly a hit with my family and I've made them twice in less than a week!  The only change I made was to leave out the lemon zest, which was just a personal preference.

Muffins were dry and didn't have enough flavor. 
I would suggest double or triple the amount of sugar, adding in another egg, and maybe add another 1/2 tsp of salt.

I love these muffins and maybe 1/4 cup more sugar should be added if you want A sweeter muffin I preferred not to add any other ingredients but the ones that were in the recipe however I did add a little more milk for consistency and I use fresh berries I think these muffins are perfect for someone who has a diabetic diet or someone who doesn’t want that high sugar content.

Wonderful! My changes were made for necessity but were good. I used heavy cream instead of milk and the oil ended up being a combination of vegetable oil,corn oil, and melted butter.

I made these blueberry muffins and they are wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly.  It helped that I had some really good store bought berries and I sprinkled some coarse sugar on the tops before they went into the oven.  Too bad I have to take them to a church bake sale and could only have one to taste.  Maybe I'll buy them back.

Loved them!  My 21 year old daughter said that they needed more sugar but I thought that they were just fine.  I did not add the lemon zest, it seemed unnecessary to me.  Will definitely make these again!

These turned out great! My husband is lactose intolerant so I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup and I used blueberries I’d frozen yesterday. I put a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar on the top of four of them and I preferred these ones because it made a nice crunchy topping.

I tried this recipe this evening as my husband and I were in the mood for a freshly baked treat.  I had read some reviews regarding the muffins not being sweet enough so I added 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup, and they still were not overly sweet so I'm glad I did.  I always have organic wild blueberries i the freezer so I thawed the on paper toweling on a plate in the microwave and when they were thawed in 5 minutes on defrost, I drained the excess juice and before mixing them into the flour mixture bowl,  I added a heaping tablespoon of the flour mixture to them in a small bowl and when they were all coated, I mixed them into the flour mixture bowl.  This way, the batter would not turn all blue.  I know that lemon with blueberries is a lovely flavor enhancement so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract  into the milk, egg, oil bowl and mixed in all together well.   I added a sugar-cinnamon sprinkling to the top before baking them and they were very delicious indeed.

I tripled the recipe because muffins don't yield a lot and I had a lot of blueberries. I ALWAYS ALWAYS add more berries to my muffins and breads that call for berries! Never disappointing! :) I had orange zest on hand and added it! Added more sugar and added vanilla. It was wierd that the sugar was not mixed with the wet ingredients. If I make it next time, I will do that. But I followed the recipe except I folded in the berries LAST. If you are using fresh- you cannot possibly add the berries during the mixing phase as stated in the recipe! They will turn to mush and you will have blue mush. lol. They are good. They are more cake-like than some of the other recipes- but I would make this again. It's a nice simple one!

These are delicious.  There wasn't enough lemon zest for me so i added quite a bit more, about 2 to 3 tsp.

I made a couple of changes due to food allergies in my home, but they still came out great!  I used almond milk in place of milk, coconut sugar in place of sugar and orange zest because I didn't have a lemon.  These muffins are perfect and my 14 month old daughter and her 18 month old friend couldn't get enough!!

Made this recipe exactly as described (except added a little more than 2 cups of berries since I didn't want any leftover blueberries) and the muffins came out perfectly.  Alternating the dry ingredients and the sour cream was not as tedious as I thought it'd be.  I used a handheld electric mixer throughout which made combining ingredients very easy.  One reviewer suggested that the batter shouldn't be over-mixed, but I mixed it pretty thoroughly and the muffins came out great.  My family LOVED them.  This was a super easy recipe, even for someone who has only made muffins from a premix box, and was also very forgiving to someone who isn't very precise with measurements.

These were very good for a quick muffin. I used buttermilk instead of plain milk, just because I always use buttermilk in baked goods. I liked that they weren't horribley sweet, which is a pet peeve of mine with muffin recipes.

These muffins were so moist and delicious, even the next day.  I added a pinch of sugar to the tops of each muffin prior to baking for a crunchier top.  Definitely will be making these again.

Not too sweet, and just a subtle lemon flavor - which I liked. I used almond milk (because I have a half gallon I'm trying to use up), and that was the only change I made. I baked mine for 23 minutes, and they were still very light in color (not brown at all), so I was afraid they weren't done, but when I did the toothpick test, they were done. Some of the other photos show them as being pretty brown in color, so don't let that fool you. Everyone's ovens cook differently, as was my case.

Good, easy recipe.  Made exactly as directed except I didn't have the lemon zest. Maybe our blueberries were sweeter than others' because we thought the sweetness was just right.

I should've known to add the blueberries at the end...I followed the recipe to a T, folded the blueberries very gently and it still turned the batter blue. Hope they taste good!

Actually I'd give this between 4 and 5 stars. It's a very good and very easy recipe. I added the ingredients times one and a half (one and a half times the recipe) since I had more than a cup of fresh blueberries. I used a pint. This worked perfectly. I also added a half a cup of sugar as some other cooks suggested. I added a dash of real vanilla. I froze some of these. They freeze very well.

Perfect, everyone loved it was soft and flavorful. I didn't use any lemon rind because I didn't have any, but it didn't seem to miss anything. I used the extra sugar and sprinkled the muffins with the cinnamon and sugar. Everyone wants to know when they're getting again.

The texture of these muffins was perfect, but mine turned out bland. As per the reviews, I doubled the amount of sugar, substituted lemon juice for lemon zest, and added two teaspoons of vanilla extract. However, the finished product had no lemon flavour, and the only prevalent taste was blueberry. Next time, I will add more lemon juice, and maybe keep the lemon zest in as well!

This recipe is perfect. I've made it exactly as written, I add lemon zest because it adds the perfect touch to balancing the flavor. I also use this as my base recipe and add different fruits and flavors depending on what I have on hand. The muffins turn out awesome each time. Thank you for a great master recipe!

This was my first time baking ever so feel free to take my rating with a grain of salt. 

I followed the recipe to the letter because I wanted to make sure I got a good impression of the recipe as is. 

While the muffins looked amazing they came out a bit dry. I'm wondering if my oven just got a bit too hot or something. They're definitely still edible and tasty. The lemon was a bit too strong for my liking so I'll go without that in the future (as others have suggested) and likely add the sugar as well per others recommendations. Overall I'm chalking it up as a success. Just gotta learn what I did wrong or what I can do to make the more moist :). Finally - I was suprised to see some of the blueberries burst and ooze down from the top of the muffin! I've never seen something like that before. It was cool :).

These are so good and so easy to make!! I used organic vanilla Greek yogurt instead of milk ( same amount), and used frozen blueberries. It is a great basic recipe since you can add anything else you crave to have on these muffins. I put them in the mixer, which I would not do again. Next time, I would do it manually. I wished I could give them more than five stars because they were truly delicious.

Really liked these bit I adjusted the recipe a bit according to others' reviews. Only used 1.5 c of flour and kept the sugar the same. Used melted butter instead of vegetable oil, and added vanilla. My daughter loves them so I'll make them more often.

Used raw sugar and added 1/4 more cup of it. Came out better than I expected since the batter was really thick (tripled recipe to use whole bag of frozen blueberries).

Very good, simple recipe. I added cinnamon, allspice, mace, & vanilla. I added lemon extract instead of zest.

These muffins are very tasty.  Thank goodness I doubled the sugar as shared by other reviewers.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour to give the muffins a bit of fibre.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and the same with vanilla to the liquid ingredients.  Because of the added sugar, I increased the milk to 1 cup.  I omitted the lemon.  I deducted a star because the muffins do not have a nice brown colour.  They were cooked through at 22 minutes but I left them in the oven for 2 more minutes to see if the tops would brown.  I can see now why other reviewers sprinkled cinnamon on their muffins before baking.  It would hide the doughy colour of the baked muffin.  I also lined my muffin tins with leftover cupcake liners which made cleanup a breeze.

As others suggested I added more sugar and a little more milk as my batter looked too dry. Followed the recipe otherwise...I enjoyed the hint of lemon.

I made these without changing anything, and they were pretty good, but could be much better. Next time i would add double the blueberries and use berry sugar instead of regular sugar. Also, i would add in a splash of vanilla extract, and possibly switch lemon zest with lemon extract, or, double the amount of lemon zest.

The blueberry muffins were made with butter milk instead of milk. I also baked them and then changed to broil to give a little extra color and crisp. They are excellent.

These are Fabulous!!! very moist and fluffy!! I did use a full cup of sugar. I had no lemon zest so mine turned out a little bland I think next time im going to use butter instead of oil and the zest and see if that helps!

We even used a toaster oven so it took less time and used all the given advice from "snowy," it turned out pretty good! We put the sugar and cinnamon on as well! We found it easy and fun to make together! Can't wait to make more sometime! Super moist too! :)

This recipe was simple and delicious! I replaced the blueberries with pumpkin puree and chocolate chips. Either way, the muffin were delicious and are now something I make every Saturday morning. This recipe is awesome!!

I made a few changes to this recipe and they were great.  I used 1.5 cups of Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Pastry Flour and 1/2 a cup of white unbleached flour. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I did not have a lemon so I used McNess Lemon oil.  My family loved them.

Wonderful recipe!  If you're looking for a moist muffin (and who isn't?), this is perfect.  Like practically everyone else, I doubled the sugar - and since I didn't have lemons on hand, I didn't use the zest though I'm sure it could only help (not necessary though).    These are sensational right out of the oven - especially the crusty tops! - but surprisingly, keep fresh and tasty for days.  Delicious!

My first try at muffins and they turned out well.  Almost burned..reduce baking time by at least 5 minutes and check them.  I added dried cranberries to the batter and it was just the zing I craved.

Very good. My 5 year old boy love blueberries, and he became a huge fan of these muffins. My little girl hates blueberries so, since I was in a hurry and didn't have time to find another recipe of muffins, instead of adding blueberries I added chocolate in powder. It was yummy! Very very delicious!

I thought they were great! I took some advice and did the cinnamon instead of the lemon, very good.
