Ahhh greens.  My favorite are mustards, but they are difficult to find.  My cooking background is eclectic.  My mother moved to Florida from Japan when she was 28 yrs old.  Japanese don't really own ovens so American food and grocery stores were fairly intimidating.  Our African-American maid taught her how to cook American food, and by American food I mean traditional Southern soul food.  So growing up, I always had a saide of rice and soy sauce with my fried gizzard.  I have never wanted to cook greens because my mom makes such excellent greens that I don't think I can compare.  I remember my mother telling a bunch of African-American co-workers that she made excellent greens and they handily dismissed this 5 ft tall Japanese woman as delusional.  Until they had her greens and then begged her to make them at every work pot-luck.  There are some changed I made to this recipe according to my mom's recipe.  Firstly, you must add brown sugar.  This masks the bitterness of the greens.  A splash of apple cider vinegar helps too.  You've gotta increase the bacon in this recipe.  Please.  Three slices?  Try 8 or more.  Cook for a few hours.  The longer, the better, but make sure your bacon doesn't start disintegrating.  Cook the onion and garlic in the bacon grease and nix the oil.  Bacon grease makes everything taste better.  And lastly, the weird secret from Mom:  These can be made in a rice cooker without the inner rice container.  it will boil the broth and then keep it simmeri

I have been voted as the chair person for the vegetable dish for Black History month at work, and needed a recipe.  I am a true collard fan, and have always tried the five star recipes and have never been disappointed.     WHOA! Best greens I have had and can't believe I cooked them. Only made a couple of changes which include I cut out the olive oil and used the bacon grease.  I also used plenty of bacon (about a pound, as I love the flavor) and although skeptical, I added about 1 TBS.  of brown sugar. These greens are wonderful--I can hardly wait to cook them for my workgroup!  THANKS for SHARING.

OK! never made collard greens in my life.  This review is for all the novices out there that are scared to make this recipe.  This was wonderful!!  I used frozen collards, so I can't imagine how fresh would taste!  I slow cooked mine all day in the crock pot.  I also used 3 thick slices of salted pork and only used one cup of chicken broth for fear of being too salty.  I also added one and a half cups of water.  I didn't have onions on hand so I added 1/2 of a jalapeno, defnitely added some kick to it!  I, too added brown sugar, like I read in previous reviews, also added a dash of apple cider vinegar.  This is absolutely delicious!  Served with black eyed peas, mac and cheese, corn bread and blackened tilapia, it was a yummy start to the New Year.

If you like greens, you're gonna LOVE this recipe! The only change I made was to add more bacon... only 3 slices of bacon??? Are you kidding me??? I think I at least doubled that!!! I let mine simmer for nearly an hour and they came out perfect! This recipe works just as well with turnip greens or mustard greens too. Whatever is fresh at your grocery that day will do just fine. I could seriously eat these once or twice a week and not get tired of it... Soooo Good!!

Outstanding!- very flavorful! (Very peppery though... I'll cut some out the next time).  For all ya'll who have referred to the soupy nature of the cooked greens... that's the "pot likker", the liquid that remains after you cook your seasoned greens!  Many Southerners prize this flavorful watery liquid, and reserve it to dunk their cornbread in. It is messy but common thing to do after making collard or turnip greens. There are various ways you can do this:  Some folks serve the greens somewhat soupy. But we like our greens strained, and on the same plate as our blackeyed peas and ham. So before we serve greens, we ladle some of the pot likker off the collards and put a little in a small bowl next to each plate for dunking.  Then we use a slotted spoon to strain and remove the collards to a serving bowl. A different thing some people do is to ladle the pot likker, often with a splash of Hot Sauce, onto their cornbread... but I think that makes it too soggy.

I'm from the South and these are THE BEST collards.  I've impressed both of my Southern grandmothers with this recipe and have even impressed a few Yankees :-).  The only change I would make is to cook the collards a bit longer.  I sometimes will start them on the stove, then move them to the crock pot for several hours.  To me, the longer collards cook - the better.

No sense in hiding it: I'm really impressed with myself right now. I want to give me a pat on the back. But most of all, I want to go in there and eat that whole pot of collard greens I just made. All thanks to this recipe! Somehow, born and raised in Georgia....this is my first time making collard greens. Didn't like them for a long time, but I'm coming around now. And WOW are these good. In addition to upping the (reduced sodium) bacon to 8 strips, I added a little more salt, a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar, and probably two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per reviews. That totally pushed these over the edge for me. I could hardly give them the 45 minute minimum to simmer....once I did a taste test, it was all over. In summary: MAKE. THESE. COLLARD GREENS.

This was just ok for me, I am from North Carolina, and my roots are from Eastern N.C. So maybe that's why this was just ok for me. I am use to (country ham hocks not to be confused with smoked ham hocks) there is a difference. We boil our greens with the country hocks and fried meat grease, such as fat back ect ect. I had never had greens with onions, garlic and olive oil before. And while I love all the ingredients and it smelled really great while cooking. With collards this was just not for me.

I just cooked these greens with black eyed peas, cornbread and pork chops.  We're in the South and my husband has eaten ALOT of collards.  He's over there raving right now.  Luckily we bought enough that I can make it tomorrow night too.  I think he's about to finish them off....I followed the recipe to a "T".  Wonderful;  Thank you!

this is a standard southern way of making collards. for those who don't know (if u get them fresh) take the stems out, stack the collards on top of each other, then roll them, then cut. for sure, more bacon and brown sugar is needed.

Excellent. Just the right balance of flavors. The only variations I made were more bacon and onions, and a dash of apple cider vinegar. I don't think
I'll ever prepare these any other way. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe works for kale also. DOUBLE the bacon you won't regret it.  Adding 2 teas. cider vinegar and 2 Tbls. brown sugar removes the bitterness that is in greens. I also cook for about 1 1/2 hrs. or until the greens are tender. If you are looking for a "healthy" way to cook greens look elsewhere and don't comment on this recipe. It is about taste.

Yes yes yesssss.  Used 3 pounds collards, 3/4 pound of bacon, 6 cups broth, 2 onions, lots of garlic.  No oil.  Browned the bacon, kept the grease, cooked the onions and garlic in the grease and then proceeded as per the recipe.  T of granulated brown sugar and splash of apple cider vinegar as per previous reviewers.  Simmered them for 3-4 hours.  HOLY COW these are GOOD.

The best collard greens ever! (sorry grandma). I could never figure out how to get my collards to taste like my grandmother's so I decided to look for something else. Stumbled across this recipe, cooked it exactly as directed (except I added lots of bacon).  I let it slow cooked all day in a crock pot and it was the best. I made it for my aunt's b-day cookout party and they loved it! There was none left over! Thank you thank you thank you ken so much!

We loved this dish, however with a few minor additions. We took the advice of some of the reviewers and added a few key ingredients. This is what we did: Being Southern, collard greens and bacon are a match made in heaven. It is a must to have enough bacon grease to fry the collards, and give it an amazing taste. Many would use ham hocks for the base, but substituting bacon to get that flavor, we added extra bacon, to the tone of 10 slices. So if you're on a health kick, this isn't necessarily healthy. We skipped the olive oil, and cooked with the bacon grease. We cooked the bacon, partially, took it out, added the onion to the grease, and cooked until soft, but you can caramelize if you would like, then we added the garlic and cooked until fragrant. Next, we added the chopped collards, and cooked until well wilted, added the bacon back, added the chicken broth, salt, pepper, and substituted hot sauce "Tabasco Sauce" in place of the red pepper flakes. This adds a little vinegar without giving it a vinegary flavor. On a side note, the recipe does not call for vinegar, we were confused by all the bad reviews that said it did! We cooked for a good hour, and then felt it needed a little something, so we added 2 TBSP of brown sugar, and this was perfect. We cooked for an additional hour, to soften the collards, because this is a must. These are absolutely delicious, and will definitely be a staple in the household. PS: Be sure to WASH your collards! E Coli is very dangerous!

I love to cook and had a huge family function coming up where my new fiance family was coming over to meet mine. His side is white, mine mixed. I wanted them to try this as it is my favorite. I tripled the recipe. THEY LOVED IT. Some have never had greens ever. Now at every get together they still talk about this. Thank you so much for putting this on here. I thought I would have some leftovers, but his family took some home.
I enjoyed making these before but this added  a whole new kick to them. everything blended together nicely.

Tons of flavor!  Used a mixture of collards and other greens.  Omitted the red pepper flakes and olive oil (used only bacon grease).  So easy and so good!

Fry greens in bacon fat - Check.
Careful with the salt because it's easy to overdo it - Check.
A spoonful of brown sugar to counteract the bitterness and a shot of cider vinegar for twang - Check. Check.
Now add a splash of that wonderful Chinese hot sauce you see at the market (no me gustan RPF) and you turn a vegetable most people would run from into a dish worth writing home about. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and helpful comments.

While I've never put garlic in my collards and DO add some vinegar..............this is the way I cook them.  UPDATE:  try cooking them for 10 minutes at full pressure in your pressure cooker.  Tried this recently when I didn't have 45 minutes to cook them.  Hubby said: "best yet".  If you'll remove that barky center part of the stem they'll cook up more tender.

Kickin' is right! These greens are great! I've made them twice in two weeks and my family loves them. For anyone that is nervous about making greens this recipe is for you, it's definitely very easy and VERY tasty!

 I follow the recipe to a tee except for the spices. I add seasoned salt instead of regular salt, cajun seasoning instead of red pepper flakes and I also added a little sugar to offset the natural bitterness of the collards. I buy the already washed and cut greens from the grocery store to eliminate some of the work, but they come in 2 pound bags so if you're going to go this route you'll have to double the recipe.

TRY THIS RECIPE, YOU WON"T BE DISAPPOINTED!

These were very good but I found that 3 cups of broth was a bit much for the pound of greens and made them a little soupy, requiring some draining.  I also took the advice of others and added some brown sugar to take away the bitterness and added a splash of cider vinegar.

WONDERFUL balance. Hint: a great way to 'tenderize' greens is to pop them into the freezer. Once frozen, they are very easy to chop and cook up more quickly

Let me start by saying this is the first time I've ever cooked collards...  I pretty much stuck with the recipe, but used approximately 8 oz of chopped salt pork instead of the bacon, and added about 2 Tbsps of apple cider vinegar.  Once the chicken broth and seasonings were added, I transferred everything to a crock pot to simmer for 6 hours.  The result was fantastic - the greens were flavorful and tender.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on, and I will no longer be hesitant to cook greens!

Excellent recipe.  I also added the brown sugar and cider vinegar as recommended.  For those of you who don't have chicken stock on hand, are vegetarians, or prefer not to use the red pepper flakes for children, here's a couple of tips.  Save the ends as you are cooking other meals from your carrots, onions, and celery.  Wash them, pat them dry and put them in a freezer bag.  You can add more as you are cooking throughout the week.  I use 1 qt. bags, and when one is full I start a new one.  Then, add them to water (5-8 qt. pot), bring to a boil, and simmer for about an hour.  Strain out the ends, and toss those.  You will always have *free* homemade veggie stock on hand!  For the heat... When you make your stock, add 3-5 whole, dried red chile peppers, and strain those out with the veggie ends.  It will give it a slight *kick*, without the actual flakes in there that may be too hot for children if they bite them.  My very picky daughter loves it this way and it's not too hot for her.  Great for anytime stock is called for.  Just don't add any more heat (peppers), and plan to add salt to taste, as the broth is homemade.

this is an excellent recipe. when frost has fallen on the collard plants several times (especially big frosts) they will be tender. cook these too long and you won't have to chew them. if frost has not fallen, put them in freezer just till frozen, then cook.

Fabulous!!! This reminds me of  home! Based on the recommendations of others, I add a ham hock and cook in the broth for 30 minutes first ( I just used a crock pot on high to heat broth and hock while prepping everything) I also added 1T brown sugar, a few pickled jalapenos. I cook onions, garlic, then greens in pan until greens are nice and wilted and then throw it all in the crock pot on high for around 4 hours. The length of time is up to you, I usually try it to see if it's good. I think the longer it cooks the better!

I really liked this recipe. I am a newly wed and am just now starting to cook "real" food. So this was my first time making them. People really really liked it... I like bacon so used the bacon grease and about 8-10 pieces of bacon. Made 2 pots. One for my house and another for Easter dinner. I did add apple cider vinegar. Husband ate so many bowls... YUMMY

never made Collard Greens before in my life, but I liked them.  I made these for the first time and they were a hit!  Even my child asked for seconds and has requested them on other occasion's. and of course I won't say no to that request!  I did use brown sugar...

After seeing an article which claims collard greens can reduce cholesterol 13% more than prescription drugs, have been wanting to try cooking some.  Of course, with the bacon used for seasoning, not sure how much good remains but these are really great - the additions of some of the reviewers are necessary to make it so.  No olive oil - with all the wonderful bacon drippings (used 6 slices), why?  Sauteed the onion and added the garlic in the drippings before adding the bacon back in.  Used water and a cube of chicken bouillon in place of broth, as that was on hand.  Did not add salt, as there is plenty in the bouillon.  Did add about a tablespoon of sugar (mix of white and brown).  Cooked all afternoon on low heat, barely simmering.  Yummmeee!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is ok but it's missing a few things for my taste. Chicken stock? I like to make my own pork stock if I have time. First you gotta have ham hocks! Some recipes say boil them for 30 minutes and thats ok if you want to use the meat. I like to boil my for over 8 hours to make a stock breaking down the collagen so you get all that amazing pork flavor. Start with 3 qts of water, 1 1/2 lbs of ham hocks, salt & pepper to taste, bring to a boil and then simmer. You will have to add water from time to time but in the end it makes for better greens. This recipe contains no sugar or vinegar for that bite. Some people use brown sugar I prefer to use orange juice you get the sugar plus a little acid which most food needs. I add some white vinegar (also acid) and my favorite hot sauce for kick. Greens need to cook for at least 2 hours so they are nice and super tender. Not to knock this recipe it is a good, simple base recipe but for traditional "southern" collards don't forget the hocks, a little sugar and vinegar!

Amazing!  These were the best greens I ever made.  I did add about 1/4 tspn. cayenne pepper and 3 tbspns of apple cider vinegar.  Gave it the perfect acidity.  All of my guests loved it and even drank the juice at the bottom.  I know!

I've been making greens for years but something was missing. I defaulted to canned brand "Glory Mixed Greens" as they were pretty good (for canned) and quick.   Then I found this recipe, tried it, loved it and made it again within a week. Easy, fairly quick (cooking time is somewhat lengthy) and tasty. Same flavors or at least pretty darn close to the canned but can't beat these fresh collards.  The only change was I cooked them for about 1 1/4 hrs. Second time I made them I added a can of cannelloni beans. Pass the Red Rice and cornbread!

I'm not normally a fan of collard greens, but I loved this recipe and really easy to make.  I made it last night for a group of people, one from Louisiana who grew up on collards - and loved this version!  Another friend would never eat collards, and she too loved these!

Mine turned out extremely bitter, so I had to add at least 1/4 cup sugar.  I also cooked them for over 2 hours. They finally turned out good.

YUMMY!  This was my first attempt at making greens and it was a success.  I did make a few substitutions using the fresh mixed greens bag from Trader Joe's (mustard, collard, and turnip greens) beef bacon, vegetable broth (rather than chicken broth), and a little more than a pinch of red pepper flakes.  They were spicy but not overbearing.  They were not too salty either.  My kids loved them.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is the bomb! I make as written except for tons more bacon and I cook way longer. I've used frozen but didn't care for them, fresh is the way to go, it's worth the extra time for prep. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

I've never made collard greens before but thought I would give it a try after having them at a wonderful local restaurant.  Took previous readers' advice by upping the slices of bacon a little, adding a "splash" of cider vinegar, adding a tablespoon of brown sugar and simmering for a couple of hours.  My 15 year old son gobbled them up as did my husband who never had collard greens before.  Great / easy recipe!

Delicious greens! I just started cooking greens this year and can't believe I never tried them before. I did double the bacon as others recommended, but I thought it was actually too much. I think the original recipe would have been better, so I think I'll stick with it from now on, although I did use the bacon drippings for cooking instead of the olive oil.

This recipe is fantastic.  Just cooked them for dinner (along with some corn bread and sweet potato casserole) and my husband, a self-proclaimed "southern food critic" loved them and wants me to make them again tomorrow.  Per the suggestions of others I used 6 slices of bacon (brown sugar cured) and also added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and bit more red pepper flakes as we like a little kick.  I used 1 can of chicken broth as that is what I had but it seemed just right for us.  Also, I did not cook the greens for 45 mins after adding the broth, probably only about 15 to 20, just til they reached the consistency that we like, which is tender but definetly not mushy.  Great flavor and simple to prepare.

I add a capful of cider ving. and also a few pinches of brown sugar. In addition to the red pepper flakes I usually add some hot sauce (especially if I am making the dish sans bacon, which I do for my vegetarian friends)

Mmmmmm.  Love these.  The only thing I do different, is add seasoning salt, hot sauce, and apple cider vinegar.  That's just what I prefer, though.  Also, the more bacon, the better...believe me on this one!  Thanks for posting....this is one of those recipes that makes me look good...thanks for all the brownie points! Lol.

Delicious!  This is my first time cooking with collard greens; I didn't realize they took so long to cook down, and the longer they cook, the more they melt in your mouth.  Mmmmm.  I made this vegetarian by omitting the bacon and adding some liquid smoke to the onions. I also used veg broth instead of chicken.  I added a pinch of brown sugar and a bit of apple cider vinegar, as suggested by other reviewers.  I used Cholulua hot sauce instead of pepper flakes and I also added some dried minced onions.  Thanks for the great recipe, I WILL be making this again!!

Very good Collard green recipe!  I used low salt broth and reduced salt bacon.  I also used 5 slices of bacon instead of 2.  Served with cornbread!

I followed the recipe just as it read.  I've never made collard greens before.  The recipe does not tell how to cut the greens.  I took the stems off all the way up the leaves.  This was a very time consuming recipe and not worth the time.  I should have listened to the reviews about the salt.  They were very salty.  We did not like this recipe at all.  It went in the garbage disposal.

Oh, these were really good.  I used twice as much bacon called for and did not need the full amount of broth.  I probably only used about a cup, and there was plenty of pot liquor at the end. My family is big on "greens" and these did not disappoint. I'm from the south, so these were right up my ally. Great recipe.

I grew up in the south and ate my fair share of collard greens and these are the best I've ever had. The recipe was easy to follow and the results were awesome. I changed peoples minds about eating greens.

Way too much pepper for me. I did add a splash of apple cider vinegar & 1 tbs of brown sugar. Added another tsp to make it edible bc didn't want to throw out whole batch. I've been looking for collard green recipe: love them when made elsewhere. So dissappointed. I see others triple bacon. Maybe the extra bacon grease masks pepper. I'd also completely destem them in future

This recipe inspired me to grow my own collards!!!  My kids, hubby, and some very good friends love this recipe.  I do add more bacon and a lot more pepper flakes.  If I'm out of chicken broth, I use beef broth.  So yummy, especially with my own home-grown collards. They are really easy to grow!  Thank you for sharing all the reviews.  I don't add sugar or vinegar and they are scrumptious!

I prepared Collard Greens tonight for our supper using this recipe and it was over the top!  The flavors that came together were awesome!  My 53 y/0 hubby had never even tried them and fell in love.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!!  I thought nothing could beat the recipe I had been using (a traditional one involving making a "pot liquor" with ham hocks and chicken broth that has to cook a couple hours before even adding the greens...then after adding the greens it would take forever to get them soft....PLUS there's all that fat from the ham hocks....not healthy!).  So anyway back to this recipe!  Like others, I added MORE BACON (I used about 6 or 7 slices)...all I had was red onion which was fine.  A few minor changes: reduced salt to 1/4 tsp (for chicken broth I use "Better Than Bouillon" which is already salty enough), reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp sugar, added 2 TBS cider vinegar, and added an undrained can of mild Rotel (so I omitted the red pepper flakes too b/c Rotel has a little kick already).  I think the step of sautéing the greens first is pure genius!  I sautéed mine for about 20 minutes though, so they were nice and wilted!  I also simmered them longer than suggested (probably about 2 hours).  Yummy yummy yummy!!!!!

This was delicious and easy, and I will definitely try it again.  The only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  This recipe was incredibly salty.  If you try this recipe, save the salt for the very end and add just to taste.

We'd never had collards before.  Based on the reviews, I decided to try this recipe when I found them on sale at the grocery store.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed them!  I used real bacon bits instead of sliced bacon since that's what I had on hand.  My husband, who avoids anything green, went for seconds!

This was a good recipe, but I made a few tweaks. For one, I skipped the oil and sauteed the onion and garlic in bacon grease. While that was cooking, I boiled the chicken broth with a smoked ham hock and later added the rest of the ingredients. I think the ham hock provides a lot more traditional flavor than bacon. I also added a pinch of brown sugar and a splash of apple cider vinegar like other posters suggested.

This was the first time I ever made collard greens and it came out great! The only change I will make is using less salt. After adding the amount indicated plus the chicken broth and bacon, it was a little too salty for my taste, but otherwise it was wonderful. We used cornbread to sop up the juice, it was delicious!

I have a love/hate relationship with collard greens! I love them when they are made by my neighbor and have always dislike them when I cooked them. This recipe made me happy, the whole family enjoyed them! I saw some reviews complaining of them being 'way too vinegary' but there is no vinegar in the recipe! I do agree that 3 cups of broth is about a cup too much. Just keep an eye on them and add more if needed. I cooked mine a full hour and they were tender.

Greens are a favorite at our house.  If we have a ham for Sunday dinner, I use left over ham bits instead of bacon for this and I let them simmer for 1 hour on low heat.  I also add 2 tablespoons brown sugar to the chicken stock before I add the collards.  If you can not find all collards or mustards, I simple mix what I can find and it works out great. As my hubby says"Yum-O"

This is my 2nd review.  Been making this this since 2011 & I THINK I figured out why  people are saying its too soupy.  My opinion is you need to use 2 lbs. of greens because a lot of the weight is lost when the stalks & veins are removed.  Make sense?  It does to me.  This recipe is so good I've never tried a different one for collard greens.

OMG this was fantastic!!!  The three cups of chicken broth didn't simmer away, so next time, I'll only add two.  Nixed the oil and just sprinkled on salt and pepper.  Yum yum yum!  This was my first time eating and cooking collards!

I'd never eaten or cooked collard greens and was hesitant to do so!  This recipe made those collards so unbelievably delicious I took it the produce manager at my super market so he could share it with his customers!  The whole family loved it!

My first attempt at greens. My daughter is the greens maker and does a fantastic job, but I thought I would try my hand at it with this recipe and I was not disappointed. The only thing I did differently was I used a slow cooker and cooked them all night on low, otherwise I followed the recipe and was thrilled at how great they turned out. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

The name says it all!  These were awesome.  I altered a little by adding a tbsp brown sugar and vinegar and I also tripled the bacon.  This will now become a staple veggie in my household.

Great starter recipe, but WAY too salty for my taste. I make with a half-pound of collards, but I use 3 bacon slices anyway so that may have contributed. Try cutting the bacon up raw with kitchen shears instead of cooking then crumbling -- much easier! After omitting the salt, using low-sodium broth and adding a splash of lemon juice, it was great.

Awesome recipe!  I am not a good cook at all and this recipe came out GREAT!  I did not have any chicken broth so I used water, more bacon, and salt to taste.  I also added vinegar which really brought out the flavor.  Throw in some neckbones and Mmmm...Mmmm...Mmm!  :)

Very good. Not much you can do wrong with greens, but the addition of broth & spices makes this recipe pop. I've always found the suggested simmer time to be a bit short. 1-2 hours is not overdoing it - reduce the liqued and you get a more intense flavour - better for dipping cornbread, and a little sugar doesn't hurt.

Excellent!  This was my first attempt at making collards grees and it turned out so well.  I would just recommend letting it cook longer.  It heats up wonderfully the next day for leftovers.

I'm rating this higher than I would if I was just rating on taste.  I think this is a great way to prepare greens- but if you don't like greens in the first place don't expect a miracle like I did! I liked them OK, my green-hating BF did not.  Not a big surprise.  Thanks for getting me to try something new though! :)

I have made in the past Greens for my Southern husband.  They were horrible!!!  This is a terrific recipe and the Greens were so delicious that the following week we went to the Farmers Market and got more Greens for me to cook.  The only change that I did make was I used far more bacon, a 12oz package to be exact, I also adding 1 tbsp of Brown Sugar that I incorporated from another recipe that I had looked over and the last change I made was adding 1/4 C of Apple cider vinegar.  The Brown Sugar sounded a bit strange, but it really made a difference to the fresh Kale I used.  Great recipe.

Delicious!  I am a Southerner and these are some good greens!  I will be using this recipe again.  I followed the original recipe, except I didn't use olive oil or red pepper flakes.  Yummy!  Even my 5 year old and 1 year old loved them!!

No kick to these collards. Followed the recipe exactly. I love collards and this is my second recipe to try making them at home. It is too plain for me. Edible but if your looking for collards with a kick...this is not it. Edit- I tried it again using twice as much pepper flakes (1 teaspoon), cooked the onions till almost carmelized and added a tablespoon of white distilled vinegar with the chicken stock- better. I pair it up with blackened catfish; together they fit the bill.

Very good!  I transfer mine after the 45 min to the slow cooker on low for an additional couple hours.  This softens them up and soakes up all the flavor. YUM!!

this is a good recipe.  I think it needs to cook longer, the greens were still pretty crisp after the prescribed time.  I added a little vinegar and hotsauce.

My daughter and I loved this recipe!  We are not Southern, although we live in NC now... I have seen "greens" at many restaurants but never had the guts to eat them.

I joined a farm CSA and got a while pile of collard greens, so it was now or never to cook them.  This recipe seemed easiest and I had everything in the house for it.  Awesome.  Made as is except I chopped my bacon before frying it and just threw in the onions with it.  To everyone saying they are not healthy... it's 3 (!) pieces of bacon divided among a whole family's worth of greens.  Not too terrible.

I'm a Southern girl, born and raised on southern cuisine.  They ARE good but they are NOT your grandma's greens. =) These are a variation from the more traditional Southern collard greens. I tend to put a spin on the more traditional recipes over the holidays so that every meal is not the same. This recipe is perfect for adding that "twist."

Really good and easy to make. I let it simmer uncovered though so that some of the excess liquid would evaporate and so the vegetables wouldn't be so soupy.

Very tasty with Parmesan Crusted Catfish and Macaroni and Cheese!  I hate to disappoint my fellow Southerners but I left out the bacon, cut back on the salt, and only cooked them for 30 minutes rather than 45. (I'm not a true Southerner, in case you can't tell.)

This was a great recipe for delicious collard greens I bought from a local farmer. I used low sodium chicken broth and added water to help with the sodium, and I doubled the garlic and used turkey bacon to make it a little healthier. I prefer my collard greens a little spicier, so I added quite a bit more red pepper flakes and some hot sauce. Yum! Thanks for this delicious recipe.

These were tasty, but like so many other recipes for collards, too salty. I'd suggest trying it with water instead of broth, because you just can't leave out the bacon.

Being from the north, I had no idea what to even *do* with collard greens.  I used this recipe and found out that not only are they easy to prepare, I like collard greens!  This was a great recipe - I used turkey bacon chopped up and cooking spray instead of the olive oil to lessen the calories, but it was still delicious.  I'm now a collard green fan!

Very good!  I swapped the collard greens for spinach because that’s what I had.  I didn’t cook it very long either.  I also added all the spices at the same time as the garlic. 
I will make it again!

Great flavour & very quick and easy to make! Would have probably turned out better with actual bacon (I used Maple Leaf ready to use bacon pieces) and less broth. I will definitely make this again. My husband enjoyed it, that’s a first for collard greens! Great side dish; I served it with oven fried haddock.

This is a very good recipe, but I believe it is missing a key ingredient for my taste, and that's white vinegar. I also prefer smoked ham hocks for the rich smoky meat flavor it offers to the dish.

Won a greens contest with this recipe!  I doubled the bacon and added a tbsp of brown sugar and a tbsp of apple cider vinegar for each pound of collards as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I had a small cayenne pepper from my garden, so I split in to remove the seeds and tossed that in instead of the pepper flakes.  Finally, I let it cook for about a half hour more than suggested. Yum!

I only rated this 4 stars, because like others, found that the amount of bacon was a bit lacking.  I used twice the bacon and additional bacon grease instead of the oil.  I also added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar and a couple Tbsp of cider vinegar after the onion had carmelized.  This works with any type of greens in season.

Amazing! I did make a few changes after reading what the other reviewers said. 1.) I cut up the bacon before cooking so I wouldn't need to crumble it later 2.) Omitted the Olive Oil - why do you need that when cooking bacon? 3.) After removing the bacon I poured off a good amount of the grease, and left about 1-2 TBSP to cook my onions and garlic in 4.) I cooked them a VERY long time -the longer the better. Mine were on the stove for about 2.5 hours the night I cooked them and then about another 3 hours the day of the event I was cooking them for.

These were hands down the best greens I have ever had. One of the girls at work told me she didn't even like collard greens but she liked mine! I made some cornbread too to dip in the collard juice. YUM!

I have prepared these collards fresh and frozen and they are wonderful!  I have migraines so I use chicken broth with no MSG and Open Nature bacon that is wonderful to be a non-cured bacon!!!  I like the idea of reading the reviewer that says she used 1 tsp of vinegar and and sugar (I did add this last time I prepared)!  I will continue to use this recipe!!!!  Fabulous! Miss Ann

I've made this recipe twice with my home-grown collards, and both times it was fantastic! I add in diced turnips with the onions. Other than that, I follow the recipe as written. Nom!

I chop bacon and fry. Safe a step and leave bacon in pan and add onions then garlic to saute. I use 2 cups of chicken broth adding the seasonings called for to the broth along with a tablespoon each of apple cider vinegar and sugar.  These collards are excellent!

Loved it.  I had chard and used that and it was yummy.  I used less broth though and cooked it for a little less time.  I also added a bit of brown sugar. It was superb.  A few days later I made it with brussel sprouts from the garden (which are similar in flavor to collard greens).  I used more broth and cooked them longer.  A winner!!

Never made collard greens before; this recipe turned out fantastic. BTW 1 serving size = about 2/3 cup. I followed the recipe exactly and it created about 4 cups of delicious collard greens in the broth.

No need to improve it. What's that about?  It is awesome!  Best sauce. (I used low sodium veg broth.) and frozen organic collard greens. Also 3 slices of Canadian bacon. 1st time in years I've used ONE PAN!

This was my first time making greens. I adjusted the recipe for 40 people for a pot luck. I followed the recipe exactly except I mixed mustard, collard and turnip greens and substituted onion powder for the fresh onions. I also added just a bit of old bay seasoning. These were fantastic. There were no leftovers. I'm looking forward to making these again. YUM!

For so many of my cooking years I avoided making collard greens.  Don’t get me wrong, with collards it was love at first bite.   I just thought that not being a southerner mine would never be as good as those I had while traveling.  Made as written, these are as good as any I have ever had.

Maybe I needed to cook them longer and use malt vinegar?  I don't know, this dish fell short.

I made this exactly to the recipe with Maple smoked bacon to add sweetness and it was perfect, so so good, just sorry my dear departed Southern Belle mom couldn't taste them, I was so proud of myself. It was my first time to cook the dinner myself, to celebrate the New Year's Eve with applewood smoked ham, black eyed peas and collard greens, all fresh made by me. This will always be my go-to recipe.

With my few minor changes, this recipe is a solid 5.  First, I skipped the olive oil and just cooked the garlic and onion in the bacon grease. I chopped the bacon up first, then cooked in the pot and then tossed in the onions and garlic. I also used twice as much bacon. Instead of pepper flakes, I used several dashes of tobasco sauce, I think this adds a much better flavor than the flakes. To the broth, I added a few splashes of cider vinegar as well as 1 tbs brown sugar, both help get rid of the bitterness. Let it simmer for about 3 hours, and yumm! Absolutely wonderful.

I've never cooked collards in my life before. Now, I'm going to make them on a regular basis. I actually added the onion and garlic at the same time. And I had a small red jalapeno pepper that I chopped up and added to it. It was so delish, I can't wait to make for a potluck this weekend.

I have tons of collards this year and I am always looking for something to do with them. This is now my favorite way to make them. I cook them closer to an hour, and added more than a pinch of the red pepper because I love them HOT!

These rock!  I had never cooked collard greens before and these were a real hit. Love the subtle kick these greens have and the bacon flavor was great.  Even better left over and reheated perfectly.

My niece sent me this last year and I have made it numerous times since. I did as one reviewer suggested and added about 1 tbls of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and 1-2 tbls of apple cider vinegar.  I didn't grow up with collards but they are a staple now. More bacon, too.  Just yummy!

This was my first brush with collard greens and OMG!  I loved them. This recipe made a convert out of me!  I did make the minor changes that were suggested:  more bacon, little brown sugar, splash of vinegar and a longer cooking time! Amazing!

Loved this recipe.  That being said, my only experience with collard greens is the local fried chicken place that has them on the menu.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except as soon as I added the broth, I transferred everything to a pressure cooker and cooked the greens on high for about 7 minutes in the pressure cooker since I didn't have time to wait.  Turned out nice and tender and tasty.

I cook often but I’m a novice when it comes to cooking collard greens. I hardly write reviews but this time I had to. I made these greens recently they were delicious! Everyone loved them perfectly seasoned. I made the following modifications (cider, and brown sugar, an cooked the meet longer and sautéed the meat with the onions and bacon grease) as noted by previous reviewers and one of my own (turkey ham chopped into small pieces instead of using bacon, but I did use bacon grease I had form a previous dish and cut out the olive oil). I’ve looked at other recipes and I gave this one 5 stars because of the technique and with very little modifications these greens are AMAZING!

I wasn't too big on collard greens until I tried these.  I didn't buy fresh ones, but they still turned out very very good. I added a little bit of sugar near the end of simmering.  I will defiantly make these again!

Great recipe, but requires a little modification for my tastes. First, use less or no added salt unless you have low sodium chicken broth.  It came too salty and salt can always be added at the table.  Second, cut down on the black pepper a little.  And lastly, I used some leftover ham from Easter dinner instead of the bacon.  I cut it up finely and used some of the fattier areas of the ham, and it came out great.  Good luck!

WOW! This is my first time cooking with collard greens and I will definitely be making this again. 
I changed a few things by doubling the bacon, using yellow and red onions, substituted the olive oil for butter and used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. It turned out fantastic and even my husband who is a REALLY picky eater loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I have been craving greens and tried this recipe last night.... I am not a spice fan, but decided to follow as written, except I omitted the bacon (vegetarian), They were delicious! I prepared the leftovers for lunch today as a soup, with croutons and romano cheese and fresh italian bread! Almost like spicy wedding soup! Hit the spot 2 days in a row! Loved it!!

My husband is a picky eater, especially about healthy foods. He HATES greens and really liked the way this recipe turned out. He usually says even really good recipes are just ok, and this recipe got three "pretty good" remarks including surprise at how much better they were than previous tries at other recipes. I used a pre-cut bag of mixed greens (collard, mustard and turnip) Other than that everything was the same, so thank you for finally giving me a healthy recipe my husband will eat!!! Yes some may say bacon makes this unhealthy but I'm on the low carb, high fiber lifestyle, where fat is low on other parts of the meal, and this is a perfect for me. Besides, each serving has less than one piece of bacon, this is pretty much health food!

Excellent.  I lot the recipe I had been making for years.  This tasted very similar.  As one reviewer suggested, I cooked salt pork with chicken broth in the slow cooker before making recipe as written.

First time ever making collard greens.  I used 6 slices of bacon, chopped it and left it all in the pot with onion and garlic, draining some of the fat.  Added a couple splashes of apple cider vinegar and a bit of brown sugar.  Delicious!  We loved it and the house smelled great!  Thank you!!

I used bacon grease vs. olive oil. I sauted the onion and garlic then added two pounds of collard greens. I used a dandoodle, water, and red pepper flakes. After 45 minutes on the stove, the greens were bitter so I added 1T. brown sugar and 1 T. apple cider vinegar. I transferred the greens to a slow cooker and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I cooked the greens on low for 4-6 hours and kept adding brown sugar to eliminate the bitterness. Overall, I probably added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 2 T. apple cider vinegar. My BIL uses honey vs. brown sugar. Definitely a keeper! Delicious!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. This is my first review, my husband and I do not eat collards but because we had grown some to share with other I decided to cook some as well and I am happy to say they were the best I have ever had. I did not change anything and I can say that I love collards.

This was the very first time I ever cooked Collard Greens. My son made a mistake at the store in picked  them up instead of Turnips. With Thanksgiving right around the corner and no time to go back to the store, I came to my favorite site and found this recipe. I followed the ingredients as listed just making one addition, one jalapeno quartered. We like our greens with a kick. They can out amazing!! My family loved them. I had none left over. This recipe add been added to my rotation of side dishes.

Great!  I used Franks Red Hot in place of the crushed red pepper and crumble bacon to help reduce the fat.  Also omitted the olive oil and used pam instead which still turned out just fine.  Very flavorful and good!

Delicious! Great mouth feel. Get really good smoked bacon from the butcher for extra great flavour. Used a smoke finishing salt and lemon spritz at the end before serving. Love this one!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I was so happy with how this turned out.  I did make a couple changes as suggested by others who have tried this recipe before. I added a pound of bacon instead of 3 pieces of bacon and a tbl of brown sugar. I also simmered it for an extra hour. This was very very yummy.

I followed this recipe to make my first batch of greens. I combined it with some tips from my mother and made my own substitutions and additions (vinegar, turkey bacon, little olive oil in the water) and cooked it twice as long and they turned out to be, honestly, some of the best greens I've ever had.

Husband wanted collards. I'm not a fan...BUT even I enjoyed these!! I will definitey fix again. I simmered greens with the onion/bacon mix (doubled bacon) tossed them in a crock pot then added broth. Cooking on low for a few hours frees up my stove. :) Plan to heat up and serve tomorrow for Easter..if hubbie will stay out of them!

Love prepared collard greens but find ones I like  seem so hard to find. This is the first time I tried cooking them at home but couldn't resist given all the rave reviews ...& I absolutely have to agree with everyone who loves this recipe. I added two extra strips of bacon (just because I had the extra in the fridge) & it was delicious!  Thank you for sharing!! I look forward to the left overs & definitely plan on making these again.

I have always eaten Greens when I was a little girl but have always been scared to try cooking them myself..Until now! DELICIOUS...I followed the reviews and added more bacon, apple cider, and brown sugar...YUMMY. I made mine with Buttermilk Sage pork chops, and sweet potatoes and corn bread. Def saving this one : )

These were tasty. Greens are my favorite food and I was raised in a Spanish household so I was looking for a more southern way to make them. Will make again.

Delicious! These were a hit. I used about 7 slices of bacon. Forgot to add brown sugar as others suggested but they were still awesome.

These were delicious! Most of my family had never tried greens, including me, but they'll be a regular veggie on our table now.

ha ha! I use this same recipe. The only thing different I do is use beef broth and use cayenne instead of pepper flakes. Yummy! I'm hungry now.

My family and I have never been a fan of Collards, but these are wonderful!  I even made a second batch, the next day.  I did make a few changes to the recipe, I used an entire pound of bacon, no oil, one X- large onion, fresh ground pequin pepper instead of pepper flakes, and did not have chicken broth, so substituted white wine instead (As with many of my recipes I use a bottle of 2Buck Chuck Chardonnay instead of chicken broth or 2buck chuck cabernet instead of beef broth.  The Trader Joe's wine is cheaper than the broth too).  Added  some brown sugar and cider vinegar as others suggested and YUMMY!

Pretty standard yet delicious treatment for collard greens.  Collards are one thing that Joy of Cooking doesn't cover well, and this is the type of recipe that I prefer. They're even better with smoked ham bone or hocks, but I don't often have those around when I decide to make collards.  Thanks!

I eat greens on a regular basis and LOVE collard greens, but wanted to try a different recipe.  This one just didn't do it for me.  Although I am not used to putting onions and garlic in my greens, it really wasn't bad but it didn't seem to enhance the flavor, either.  I followed the recipe to a tee at first (minus the red pepper flakes because I didn't want them in the greens), then after cooking them down and finding they were bland I added:  a few slices of chopped jalapeno pepper, about a tablespoon of white distilled vinegar and a dash of sugar (I usually use a pinch of sugar in my greens to cut the bitterness).  The overall product was just bland to me.  There was something missing and it's hard to put my finger on what it was.  I probably wouldn't make these again.

This is a basic greens recipe. Cut the leaves of the greens off of the tough stems to make them more tender (this should decrease your cooking time) but if you leave the stems on, just make sure you cook them until they're nice and tender. I can get by with about a cup of broth, not 3. Also, the red pepper intensifies in flavor while the greens cook, so a little goes a long way. Serve with Tabasco sauce and vinegar for a really yummy treat. And as a side note, you can make them vegetarian by omitting the bacon and using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, still delicious, and healthier too!

Being from the MN, I had never had collard greens before.  I think this would have been a great recipe if I had used a different green.  It was just too strong of a flavor for me I guess.

This was my first experience with collard greens being a yankee and all. They were really good. Served it with busy day chicken. Modifications: I used turkey bacon and no oil. I simmered the greens for 1.5 hours as per another reviewer's suggestion which made the stems much more edible and the greens were not smushy. My only complaint was similar to another reviewer's that the 3 cups of chicken broth made it a little too salty. Would use half chix broth and half water next time. Will definetly make it again.

Awesome recipe.  I have been searching for years and have frequently "tried" different versions of recipes from people who claim to know how to make them.  I do not have to look any further!!  I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of cider vinegar.  I extended the simmering time to about 2-2 1/2 hours for a more tender green.  HEAVENLY!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Good recipe.  Next time will use 6 slices of bacon, no olive oil because I will not need it with the bacon grease.  Will add a bit more garlic and cook in my slow cooker all day, 45 minutes just was not enough for the texture we prefer.

WOW!  I love collard greens, but I had never made them myself.  This recipe is nearly PERFECT!  I made a few small changes:  I used a whole 12-ounce package of bacon, to encourage my kids to eat the greens (anything with bacon is a kid-magnet in my house).  Because I used so much bacon, I omitted the olive oil and just used the bacon grease.  I also added about a Tbs of honey and about 2 Tbs of apple cider vinegar to help cut the bitterness of the greens.  After heating the liquid to a simmer, I transferred everything to my crock pot and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  These greens are AMAZING!  Thank you for making this California girl successful at cooking good Southern comfort food!

Fabulous recipe... we all loved it, including the kids.  The olive oil added a nice taste... I used some frozen broth I make and freeze without salt... used both chicken and turkey... as this is what I had on hand...but ran a cup short so added a chicken bouillon cube + a cup of hot water to make up the difference since I didn't want to defrost another whole container...I reduced the salt by 1/2 tsp because of the bouillon. I meant to add the red pepper, but decided not to until everyone tried the black eyed peas I served on the side which were loaded with jalapeno and cayenne... thought it would be just too much... so wound up leaving that out.... but the next time, we will definitely add it. EXCELLENT recipe!  And very flexible.  Thanks for sharing such a great idea!

MMMM.... this was so good!  I used turkey bacon instead or regular bacon and I used low sodium chicken broth.  I think I may have gone a little overboard with the cayenne and red pepper flakes because the collards came out pretty spicy!  However, they had a great flavor.  I even got my husband to eat one tiny piece!  This was delicious and I plan to make it again.

We made this for new years 2008 and it was such an easy and tasty recipe.  I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar like the other reviews mentioned but everything else I did exact.  I also strained the greens before serving and kept the juice for dippin! Awesome recipe!

They were too shiny for my family. Maybe I put too much oil in the pan along with the bacon??? The taste was good but I would make some adjustments on the oil next time.

I am from Canada and most people I talk to have never even heard of Collards. I swear I was a southern gal in a past life. I normally make these with a couple of ham hocks and liquid smoke. This version was quite tasty and oh so easy. I am the only one in my house that likes these but when I make them I make a lot therefore I doubled the recipe. I just finished the last of them for breakfast unconventional I know. Normally like my version with hot sauce however didn't like it on these. Will be definatly making them again.

Yumm! I wanted to thank Ken Adams for this recipe. I live in the south and these greens tasted just like what I was looking for, even better! I served them at a family Christmas party last week and people were impressed. I let them simmer in the crock pot. I only had a small bowl left over and two days later I ate them, and I couldn't believe that they tasted even better! I made them again for a family Christmas gathering today. I actually cooked them two days ago. People went on and on about them and told me it was the best greens they had ever tasted. I was very, very proud of this dish! Ten Stars!!

I would give it five stars after my modifications.  I blanched the greens in the chicken broth rather than slow-cooking them in it.  I also sauteed the onions and garlic in bacon grease, then added the greens for another minute or two and seasoned with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.  This way you don't boil out all of the nutrients, and the green will stay a little crisper and not get too soggy.  Good recipe, thank you.

This was my first time making greens (Westerner).  My husband loves his Louisiana's mothers recipe and was very scepitcal about making "different" greens.  He loved these.  He didn't eat anyting else but these.  I did add 1/4 syrup for sweetness and served over cornbread

Mr. Ken Adams, I couldn't wait until tomorrow to review this fabulous recipe of yours! I made this tonight for tomorrow and just had to take a taste. Sensational! This is coming from someone who's never cooked or even eaten collard's before. The only thing I did was to add a few more pieces of bacon and eliminate the evoo. This is so great that I'm questioning whether a pound is going to be enough for my gang. It may not because although it's midnight now, I'm so tempted to finish it off myself. I can't thank you enough for turning me on to this great dish of yours.

I made this exactly as it's written and it was fantastic. It was a bit spicy for the younger kids so I will have to cut back or omit the red pepper next time. The rest of us loved the spicy taste. This is how I will make my greens for now on! Thanks!

I made this for my sons high school class assignment which was to bring in and share a southern dish with his English class. I am from New England and this was a first for me.  The collards came out so good and was very easy.  I added another clove or 2 of minced garlic, used 3 bunches of organic collards sliced fine, 1tsp. of sugar and  Cambells chicken broth with a can of water along with the other necessary ingredients.  It turned out so good the teacher snagged the leftovers and just gave my son back the containers with a guilty look on her face.  I see she was as pleased as I was with the results.

These are very good. I was trying to duplicate greens I had on vacation. These are very close. I will add a tbsp of red wine vinegar next time I make them. Even my husband liked these and he is a picky eater. Served with ribs and baked beans. Great meal.

I enjoyed these very much, so did my boyfriend who had never had collard greens before. Next time though I think I will add some brown sugar to help with the bitter taste of the greens. Also more garlic (I can never get enough) and an double the bacon. When I was cooking I brought the broth to a boil before adding the green and reducing the heat, just to get things off to a hot start. Overall this was a very good recipe!!!

actually I think there is too much liquid in the recipe and the garlic is introduced too early. also I substituted a 1/2 jalapena lengthwise, seeds included....and no salt.

the heat remained regardless of the number of reheats...the collards retained their integrity and the heat was subtle.

and instead of throwing all the ingredients in at once, I added in accordance with their aromatic import, ingredients as I went along.

when I tried this recipe the first time, it tasted like anyone's collards. but with the improvements, it tasted much differently.

This is my go-to collard greens recipe. I do add other ingredients such as honey and brown sugar. I add extra red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. This makes them sweet and spicy, but the original recipe is my base recipe. I only make these greens once a year and have been doing it for years. I felt it was time to rate and review

Having never had collard greens before, I was looking for a simple recipe to try out to add more greens to my diet. Not only was it easy, it was delish! The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the T, using a high quality, nitrate-free bacon. It had a little too much pepper for my liking and was a bit too salty (never thought I’d ever say those words). Because this makes a nice amount of liquid, the next time I decided to make it more of a soup by adding a can of white beans (navy). Wow! It was exactly what I needed to balance out the salt and pepper. Now I need to find a good gluten-free cornbread recipe to round out the meal.

No more excuses for avoiding collard greens when lightly wilted in bacon fat and grape oil and then completed in your own chicken stock.

It was delicious. So easy! I made collard greens for the first time in my life a month or two ago, and they tasted just like the ones I had in New Orleans (the first time I ever tasted them was 3 years ago). I'm glad I found this recipe because it'll be my go-to. Once I had everything in the pot it was easy to let it just sit and simmer, and the flavor was fantastic. Like with all greens, it got better when adding a little bit of hot sauce when it was time to eat! I like that this recipe used bacon, because I don't like ham as much, and the flavor it imparts is essential to having great tasting greens.

Delish, and I'm southern :-)  I used smoked turkey and fatback instead of bacon and just added 1 tsp of baking soda at end and cooked for 15 min longer to soften further

First time making collards, even though I’m born and raised in the south. My husband didn’t know what a traditional New Years dinner was (collards, hoppin john) so that’s  what inspired me. Made this recipe for a group of 8, and almost everyone got seconds. Thumbs up.

I’m usually not a lover of greens because they’re too soupy for me I typically like to sauté them on the stove top until the juice runs dry or illuminated all together. However I plan to make this dish this weekend the ingredients seems quite tasty thanks for sharing.

The very best, but I add brown sugar to cut the bitterness out of the collard greens. My soul sister told me, I must have soul blood in me to be able to cook these so good!

Everybody in the South has their own way of fixing collards and turnips.  They are all different, but are all the same.  Everyone's recipes include greens and pork!  After that come the differences! If you are fortunate enough to have fresh bunches of greens available, be SURE to wash them well and trim them.  I do this by running the sink full of cold water and swishing the greens around (several leaves at a time) until the sand/grit is washed off.  Then cut the thickest part of the stems out.  Stack several leaves on top of each other, roll up lengthwise and cut crosswise making a bunch of "strands" of greens.  Then run the knife lengthwise down each roll to cut the "strands" into shorter pieces.  Size will be perfect.  If you are able to find fresh washed and chopped greens...go for it.  If frozen is all you can find, well, sorry!

I use bacon for mine.  No need for olive or other oil.  For two pounds of greens, I'll use about 4 strips bacon, cooked fairly crispy.  More bacon is NEVER bad, so feel free to use as much as you like.  I drain off (and save for other uses!) all but a TBSP or so of the grease.  Add the greens to the pot and crumble the bacon in.  You don't need much liquid because FRESH greens will release alot.  I use a quart or less of chicken broth for two pounds of greens.  Don't be afraid of how a pound or two of greens will barely fit into a good sized pot.  They WILL cook down.  I use a 4 1/2 quart cast iron Dutch oven (THE best cooking vessel ever invent

I love  this recipe.  The collards are super flavorful. When I make it again, I'll either omit the salt or reduce it, as the bacon and homemade chicken stock I use provides enough salt. Adding salt makes it too salty for my taste.

Fantastic. The bacon I used was very thick and it worked beautifully. I had to cook it for about an hour after I added the greens, as my stove's simmer is quite low. I like heat, so I upped the red pepper flakes. Otherwise, it's perfect written.

Wonderful recipe! Like others suggested, I doubled the bacon, added a shot of apple cider vinegar and a handful of brown sugar. Mine ended up simmering for about three hours before we were ready to eat dinner. My husband said they were the best he's ever had. They were amazing, thank you!

This year I decided to grow Collard Greens in my garden.  What hearty vegetables they are!!  No matter how often I pick them, they just keep growing and growning.  I love this recipe.  We don't eat pork so I substituted deli corn beef.  Crisped it up the same way you would do with bacon.  Added about a tsp of liquid smoke for that smokey flavor.  Also, per other reviewer suggestions, I added a splash of apple cider vinegar towards the end two tablespoons of brown sugar.  Served this with Mississippi Pot Roast ad Mashed Potatoes.  Awesome!

My husband won't eat ANYTHING green but somehow I convinced him to try these greens. He loved them!!! I added a tad more red pepper flakes for heat, but this recipe would have been just as good without the addition. This is my go to recipe.

This is my families favorite side dish. I have to make at least 2 pounds but usually four pounds of Collards! My 6 year old grand son LOVES these. Sometimes I add more bacon if I have extra. They are perfect.

I wasn't prepared to like this recipe, but we got a pound of collard greens at the farmer's market. I usually like my greens, like spinach, raw vs cooked.  Soggy greens just don't appeal to me. But I LOVED this recipe, it was so tasty! I followed the recipe as-is, however, as other have suggested, I added 1 Tbl of brown sugar and increased the bacon to 8 strips. Its fabulous, so glad I tried it. ***Also followed a suggestion from another reviewer: When finished cooking, strain the greens for serving, but save the juices for dipping corn bread in.  We served little bowls of the juices with each place setting. Oh my goodness, so good!

Five stars?  Absolutely!  Having had no previous experience cooking collard greens, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I see that the most helpful review mentions adding brown sugar to counterbalance bitter greens.  I didn't notice this info until later but I found it unnecessary  as I detected no bitterness in the finished dish.  The only thing I did differently was to add a few mushrooms browned in butter, solely for the purpose of using them up. Awesome recipe!

This Pacific NW girl had never had collards before and thought they were really good.  I choose this recipe because I could use turkey bacon instead of using pork.

The best collard greens! I could eat these everyday! The only thing I would change is to add jalapeños or Serrano peppers for a nice kick. But of course, that is a personal preference.

I loved this! I've never cooked collard greens before. In the past, I'd only had them prepared (dreadfully) by my folks growing up. So I made these, with a bit of trepidation. Shouldn't have worried, though. Really yummy. I swapped out the regular bacon for turkey bacon (but that added a lot of salt, I think). I used reduced sodium better than bouillon for the chicken broth. I also used garlic scapes (5 long ones) in place of the garlic cloves. (Same flavor, just the green portion-- much harder to burn, and I had them from the local CSA.) In the future, I'm going to omit the added teaspoon of salt, because my other subs made it land on the salty side. I might also reduce the amount of broth in favor of water, again to adjust the saltiness of my substitutions.

Thank you, so much, to everybody who rated this and to the original submitter! :D You made me love collard greens!

This recipe makes the best greens I have ever had!  I used to make with ham hocks and the greens were "ok" but using the bacon fat to saute and flavor the greens themselves adds a "pow" factor!  I double the bacon and increase the garlic too because I literally cram my pot full to the top with greens (4 bags).

Delicious! My method: Microwaved bacon on a paper towel lined plate until crisp 5/6 mins. Threw a ready washed and cut bag of mixed turnip and collard greens into my slow cooker raw. Didn't measure anything. Just threw in the cooked and chopped bacon, chicken broth, crushed red pepper, raw minced garlic,raw chopped Vidalia onion, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. Cooked on low all day while I was at work. Came home to the best tasting greens I've ever had. Served with blackened catfish and cheesy onion rice. This is my new favorite side dish!!!

OMG! I consider myself a collard greens connoisseur (family from the south) & I am known for my kick butt collard greens....but this recipe is TO DIE FOR!!! I took the advice of others and used more bacon & left out the olive oil and just used the bacon grease. Added 1 tblsp of brown sugar & a dash of apple cider vinegar & BOOM BABY!!! PERFECTO!!! Can't wait for everyone to get home for dinner tonight.I'm positive I will have to make more tomorrow.

This was my first time trying collards. I made the recipe as written, just slightly scaled down to the amount of collards I had on hand. Normally when I make wilted spinach or kale, I cook it with bacon, so the ingredient list is pretty standard for me. The greens were good, with a nice kick of spice from the red pepper. Maybe next time I'll cook them longer and add the brown sugar that other reviewers mentioned.

I've never cooked, nor eaten collard greens.  This recipe is perfect as is. I watched the video and didn't change a thing!  Of course, bacon, garlic, and onions make anything taste great.  Will make it again with black-eyed peas and cornbread for a true southern treat.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add a lb of bacon. When I serve it to my kids, I sprinkle a little sugar on it.

First time ever making greens.  These were amazing. I added extra bacon, because everyone loves bacon. I did everything else exactly like the recipe said.

I made this recipe for New Years dinner and was wary because it was my first time making collards. They were a huge hit! Out of the park. There was only 5 of us and we emptied the pot. Those who love collards and have eaten them for years were thoroughly impressed and went back for seconds and thirds. Like a lot of Southerners we like to add some hot sauce, but even without it, these were delicious. My only modification was I cut down on the black pepper.

Turned out great! I like a bit of tang in mine so after the 45 min cook time, I added 1/3 cup vinegar. I also added a couple more slices of bacon.

This was wonderful, and easy to make.  The collards transform from bitter to tender and mild once cooked.  I used a brand of natural bacon called Applewood, which is quite lean and tasty.  Used less broth than this, and add a splash of lemon juice or white vinegar at the end. Making them again for a dinner party tonight.  Collards cook down - may not serve 6, if you love them as we did.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year.  Since moving to Montana, I have not been able to find greens so as nervous as I was, I tried this recipe.  It was SO easy and SO good!  I confess I added more bacon than called for, but I pretty much followed the recipe.  If you want to try to make your own, use this recipe. Loved it!

Great!  I added a dash of cider vinegar and a tsp. of brown sugar as suggested.  I worked with a smaller amount of greens, I think, so I only used 1 cup of broth.

Very good greens recipe. I made it a little easier and faster by using real bacon bits instead of cooking mine before. I also put in some Louisiana hot sauce instead of the pepper flakes.

Good.  Even better the next day, and then even better after that.  I forgot to use the olive oil.  But used thick cut bacon.  It still turned out perfect.

My Wife used this recipe with turnip greens and they were wonderful. I am not a big greens eater but I had seconds on these. She did not have olive oil so she used regular oil. Try them, you will love them.

Being raised in the mid-late 50's into the 60's, I never experienced Collard Greens. Actually, probably wouldn't have eaten them anyway. I've tried and enjoyed other "unique" to me greens...hence my first time with Collard's. I used homemade chicken stock, but otherwise followed the recipe. I paired it with Fried Chicken Liver from this site. My sister thinks I've gone nuts. Cooking for one...doesn't hardly matters. I personally like this, especially with 8 oz of bacon. The stock plus aromatics etc are reducing now...I need to get my SNL inspired "spittle bucket" out.

I thought these were a little salty, but otherwise good. I would omit the extra salt since the bacon, chicken broth and red pepper flakes give it enough seasoning.

Loved this recipe. This was my first experience with collard greens and the recipe was easy to make and very tasty. I used two pieces of extra thick bacon instead of three pieces and the bacon flavor was perfect. I did not add the salt and pepper as I felt there was enough of that in the chicken broth.

This recipe is easy to make and is delicious!! I love a good pot of collard green and never would have thought to cook them in chicken broth. It tastes just as good if not better than greens that have been cooking for a few hours. I made these for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and would recommend this recipe to anyone. Hats off to the chef!!

These are amazing, I think these are the best greens I've ever made! I had a 2lb bag of cut collard greens, so I doubled the recipe.  I have a cold and these really helped open my sinuses.  They have a kick but a good one.  I think I may have put a pinch or two more crushed pepper flakes then called for but these are wonderful.

Alright so I used turnip greens first off. I also added a whole pound of bacon (only because I am military and my commissary doesn't sell ham hocks).  My family loves spicy so I added more of the pepper flakes and a splash of hot sauce. I also added mustard.. yes just plain yellow mustard I would say about 1/3 cup. I made everything originally according to the recipe (except the bacon part) and decided it needed a little bit more. Overall this is a good staple recipe. Very good for a beginner to use, it has very nice flavor.

Best greens ever. Used two bacon ends from butcher, 8 slices of bacon, brown sugar (at least 2 tablespoons), splash of apple cider. Used three bunches of greens (doubled the recipe). Fried bacon and ends. Sauteed onion in bacon fat, then wilted greens in frying pan. Then moved to crock pot and slow cooked till tender.

i've been getting collard greens from my csa all summer and I had not found a great way to prepare them. i finally tried this recipe and they were delicious. the chicken broth and bacon gave the greens a lot of flavor.  i will definitely be making this again next time i get a big bunch of collard greens.

This was my first time having collard greens.  For a side dish that stars a green, leafy vegetable, this turned out quite good.  I could come up with other side dishes that I would prefer, but everyone needs greens in their diet and I would rather have this than some boring salad that offers little nutritional value.

I've never had collard greens before, so I went in search of a recipe and found this.  I cut out the bacon altogether and used Knorr chicken homestyle stock diluted in 1/4 cup water, instead of the chicken broth.  I didn't want it soupy, so that worked out great.  I eliminated the salt (since the broth already had it concentrated in there)and left out red pepper flakes because my kids don't like things spicy.  It was terrific!  I served it up with steak on the BBQ.  I will definitely make this again.

I choose a lot of the 4.5 and 5 star recipes on this site and have never been disappointed.  This recipe is a good base, but for those of us who don't eat pork, the three bacon slices posed a problem.  My solution was to use the meat and broth from a smoked turkey leg.  (I boil two at a time, divide the meat and broth into 6 portions and seal them in freezer bags for future use).  For this recipe, I used 2 cups smoke turkey broth mixture and one bullion cube. I didn't use any sugar, but I will next time. Either way, it's a great recipe.

It's just me and the Mrs at home for supper these days.  We had leftover greens every night for about a week with no complaints.  We both loved them. These will be added to our rotation for sure. Thanks for posting!

I love collard greens and so does my husband. However, this recipe lacked something in the taste. It was too bland. I did omit the olive oil and used the bacon grease and I did add some vinegar in hopes it would give it more taste and added more garlic and red pepper flakes but it still lacked something.  If I make this recipe again I will try adding more bacon and some brown sugar as one person suggested but I don't know if I will make it again.

My husband loves collard greens, my daughter tolerates them, and I never eat them by choice.  I made this recipe as written except that I used about 1 tsp of chili oil as well as the olive oil for cooking the greens.  I actually ate a small serving as did my daughter, and my husband ate all the rest and proclaimed them delicious!  Something I'll definitely fix again.

We recently received some collard greens in a local organic produce box that we have delivered weekly. We live in Texas where greens reign supreme, but I have never, ever tasted collard greens that I actually enjoyed, so I had never tried making them. This recipe changed my mind about greens! They were soooo good! I followed the recipe, only adding a bit of apple cider vinegar and a bit of brown sugar. I cooked them for about an hour. Everyone loved!

So good, I had never had collard greens before, but it turns out I love them - well, this recipe at least!  Followed all directions except I had no red pepper flakes so I used a small pinch of cayanee pepper instead.  Loved it!

Oh...my....goodness. First time collard green cooker; first time collard green TRYER! I got a wild hair while in the grocery store and decided I want to make collard greens. Searched for a 5 star recipe and came across this one. Heaven in my mouth. Seriously. I followed the instructions exactly until the simmering part and I listened to others and added a little brown sugar and a little cider vinegar. To die for. A MUST try recipe. Thanks!!

I never thought of this as actually being a recipe to share. I fix my collards this way minus the bacon and boil a couple of boneless chicken breasts in the same pot with the greens. One of our family friends doesn't eat red meat so I did this for her and actually liked it better!

Every time I've made these collards for friends and family, they've raved on and on about how good they are. I have to make plenty of it because people always want some to go! Greens to go? Crazy ain't it. I could eat this as a stand alone I love it so much. Delicious!!

@sailshonan - I've been making this recipe for a while now and thought I was making it my own until I read your review. I never saw your review until just now and laughed out loud because that is JUST how I altered it (without the vinegar)!! I don't think it needs it. I love that your mom is from Japan and had an African-American woman teach her this VERY SOUTHERN recipe. The extra bacon and little bit of brown sugar make all of the difference. I omitted the oil as well. The bacon fat makes up for it. I have had nothing but rave reviews from Southerners to Northerners (I live in GA). This is the only recipe I use for collards now.

I LOVE greens! I must admit I was kind of skeptical as I read this recipe because I cannot imagine greens without ham hocks. I was pleasantly surprised. It was DELICIOUS! I also use Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt. Next time, however, I will definitely incorporate ham hocks into this dish. What can I say? I am set in my ways...this recipe is a keeper!

I love this recipe! The red pepper flakes give it just the right amount of heat/flavor. The broth could be cut back a cup or so, even after simmering it for 45 min, there was still a lot of broth. We like to serve them over brown rice with a protein on the side!

Omitted the bacon... Made a few changes. I used kale, vegetable broth, added mushrooms and a serrano pepper. It is fantastic and spicy. Yum!

Best ever collard greens.  I took them to a reunion and I had aunts and uncles that haven't ate collards in years that ate this batch right up.  Chicken stock is key.  As well as cooking down the collards and getting them to wilt before they simmer.

The kids fought over the last bit of this. The main thing I changed was putting it in the crock pot on high for several hours.

I made this recipe last night, and OH MY! This was delicious!! Five starts. I cant wait to make it again. The only thing I did different was, I used 6 pieces of bacon and only used a half of onion. Thanks for sharing!

These were quick and simple to make but....did not like the bacon  too much. Next Time I will omit this step and add a bit of balsamic vinegar to heighten flavour. Husband liked it .

I made this for Easter (we had a mock Thanksgiving). My 8 year old said this was her favorite dish. I cooked just as the recipe said, but next time I might drain the bacon fat before adding the collard greens. Great flavor overall, a keeper!

These collard greens are wonderful.  I used this recipe the first time I made greens for my mother and father-in-law (who are from Kentucky and Arkansas). They said these were the best collard greens they ever had.  I saved the stock and made soup with the leftover greens, pork roast, potatoes, carrots.  We called it Red Neck wedding soup. lol.  Everytime I make these for people they rave about them.  Best collard green recipe!!!

Delicious!  I used regular turkey necks instead of bacon.  I also added brown sugar and apple cider vinegar as others suggested.  This recipe is nice bc even with minor changes here and there, it is wonderful.

I have made this several times now and my family loves it.  Thank you for posting.  Things that work for us: no olive oil just a TBS of extra bacon grease and I omit the red pepper so the kids don't whine about it being spicy.

I made this for a new year's get together I've tried collard green before but did not like them on three different occasions because of the bitter taste, but this recipe is fantastic... great flavor. I loved it and so did the guests they all had more than one helping of the greens.

My first time ever making Collard Greens & this was fantastic!! The only problem I had was listening to other reviewers and added extra bacon. It was too much, next time I follow the recipe direct & use a small amount of bacon. Also, I added a few dashed of Frank's Hot Sauce to give an extra spice! Turned out great!!!

Delicioso! After days of rich Holidy foods, this was the PERFECT way to ring in 2012! I've eaten, but never prepared collard greens...until now.  I belong to a Greener Grocers program at work and had collard greens and black-eyed peas in my basket last week.  I use allrecipes.com as my primary resource for new (and familiar) ingredientds...and I have NEVER been disappointed with the creativity I have found!  
Back to the 'Kickin' Collard Greens, they were absolutely flippin-fantastic!  I did, however, add cooked black-eyed peas at the end and served as a soup.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Ken!

This was close to another recipe I've used, just missing a few ingredients. I substitued little smokies for the bacon and used fresh red pepper instead of the red pepper flakes. The rest was added ingredients and my family loved it. I made it spicy!

Simply delicious. I'm a Canadian girl who wanted to try something new so I picked up a bunch of collards from the store. I tweaked the recipe a little bit -- I used 5 slices of turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, used reduced-sodium chicken broth and only 1/2 of the salt and about 3/4 of the called-for pepper. Simply delicious!

You know... I just couldn't resist writing ANOTHER review for this recipe. This is one of my Favorites! I never cooked any of those huge green leaves you always see at a farmer's market, or in the produce section of the grocery store until my daughter-in-law prepared them and used THIS recipe, exactly as written. YUM! No one in my family ever made Greens, so I didn't grow up with them. Wow, they didn't know what they were missing!  EVERYONE Loves this dish...I brought a big pot to a family gathering, set the pot on the bar and the chatter started flowing... "This is SO good, What IS this?, I need the recipe, etc." It is incredibly easy. The prep time is 5 minutes tops. I will say that I only use 1/2 of the pepper flakes and if this is your first time preparing Greens and you're not quite sure about the amount of "kick" you want, then use only a few, or leave them out entirely. It is still delicious without the "kick". Other "tweaks" I sometimes do is to leave out the bacon and instead, use smoked pork chops or neck bones to make it more of a hearty, one-pot meal. I've also left the meat out entirely and it is still extremely delicious. I use this same recipe for ALL Greens, Swiss Chard, Collard Greens, Turnip Greens. Don't hesitate!

I made this yesterday and my fiancé was overwhelmed with how delicious they came out. This is an excellent recipe. Thank you very much. I have to say I only used 2 cups of chicken broth and added a little red crushed peppers to make it a little spicy.

Easy to make and my main two food critics(heath food nuts no less) leved them.  They even had seconds.  I left the bacon out for the vegetarians in the crowd and the red pepper spice kicked up the taste just fine.

This Southern Belle gives this recipe a 5 star rating.  I used frozen collard greens and have to admit this recipe is delicious.   Highly recommend it!  Fixed as stated.

Used smoked turkey leg instead of bacon, sauteed in water rather than olive oil, and added extra red pepper flakes. I love this dish & prepare it often. Healthy and MMMM good.

Great, easy recipe!  We left out the bacon and used Chalula instead of red pepper flakes and it turned out great.  If you have the option of low sodium chicken/vegetable broth, I highly recommend that - otherwise these greens are suuuuper salty.

Absolutely the best greens I've had!  Skipped the olive oil & used 1 lb of bacon (too much - will cut back to about 1/2 lb) and added the brown sugar that so many others recommended.  AWESOME!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This recipe is, by far, the very best greens recipe EVER!  I do not change it in any way and it's perfect every single time and everyone asks when I'm going to make more!  By the way, this recipe works just as well with turnip greens (they don't cook as long).  Delicious!!  Thanks for sharing, Ken!

Excellent recipe. I added just a little vinegar. Also made it with a smoked ham hock. Little harder to find the ham hock but worth the effort. I'll still make it with bacon sometimes but you just can't get the same flavor as with a ham hock.

These were great for my southern style BBQ. I used two huge bundles of collards greens, a whole pack of bacon & 6 cups of broth. Simmered for 3-4 hours. Everyone loved them. I never had them before so had nothing to compare to but the reviews were great "best greens I ever had" from a southern boy!

I had never cooked collard greens before, and while this recipe was good, I think it did not cut the bitterness of the greens and 3 cups of liquid was way too much. Next time I make less liquid and I will think about something that might balance the bitterness.

Great recipe.  The only deviations I made were adding an extra slice of bacon, a bit of sugar, and half a red bell pepper.   Also, I agree with some other reviewers that 45 minutes is too long.  I would say 30 minutes max.

I made this on New Years and I am in love with this recipe.  I added a little more bacon but other that that followed the directions exactly.  I had never made collards before and this was easy and mouth watering!

Fabulous! This changed our perception of what can be done with greens. My husband and I were speculating after dinner about whether we'd have liked greens as children if we could have had them prepared like this. We are both transplants to the south and neither of us come from a home where a recipe called for anything more than boiling greens till they were dead. I made many changes, but they were all subtle, I think. I have faith that this would still have turned out perfectly even if I'd had all the proper ingredients on hand. For the record, I used kale instead of collards, pork jowl instead of bacon, and a combination of leeks, chives, and a small onion where it called for a large onion.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I usually on't even like collards, and my husband is SUPER picky and we both could not stop eating these collards.  I used low-fat turkey bacon, but that is the only substitution I made.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

This recipe is great!  I did adjust it slightly, though.  I removed the olive oil, tripled the amount of bacon, used cocktail onions, beef broth instead of chicken and chopped-up jalapeno in place of the flakes.  I also used turnip greens instead and added a bit of dark brown sugar (3/4 TBS).  YUMMY!

I bought some collards for a good price so decided to try this recipe. I made it just as written except I left out the salt (cause the chicken broth all ready had it) and it was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!! I served it with a pot roast and both of us went back for seconds... of the collards.  This went immediately into my "use often" file!

These greens were really great!  I omitted the olive oil and used 8 slices of bacon.  I used 1 TBS of reserved bacon grease to cook the onions.  I cooked them on low for about 3 hours.  The longer the better!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  My husband said these were the best collards he has ever had, and we live in Charleston where you can get some really great collards in local restaurants.  I really couldn't believe I made them.  I didn't have any broth on hand, so I just used water and they turned out great!  I also only used 2 slices of bacon, because that was all I had...still excellent, with less fat!

Loved this recipe!!  I did add a few shakes of red wine vinegar in at the end, but otherwise followed it exactly.  The heat level is excellent- you can definitely notice it, but not too overpowering.

These were good! I actually prefer the tasty collard greens from this site but I have all the ingredients for this one more often. It can be on the salty side so you may want to use low sodium broth. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely great!! I also omitted the olive oil and just fried the greens in the bacon grease.  I think the altitude where you live may have an effect on how long it takes some things to cook, because I live in a low altitude area in the "desert" and these greens cooked alot quicker than stated in the recipe.  I also boiled some small red potatoes, cut them in chunks, added them to the greens and then heated through.  Talk about good eatin' !!

SO good.  I love this recipe for collard greens--I also use it for brussel sprouts, just cut them in half and cook in the same way (though not for as long).  I sometimes add extra hot sauce in addition to the pepper flakes because I like it HOT!

This recipe would have been perfect if it called for more bacon. I added 7 slices of bacon to mine and it turned out very good.

I'm a Louisiana girl and these are my go to collards. I don't use olive oil, I just fry the bacon. and use those drippings. I usually have a couple of ham hocks already boiling to tender and add  a little vinegar and brown sugar. Oh and maybe a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes, we like it spicy. Thanks for making me look good.

I used turkey bacon, but other than that stuck to the original recipe. Family & guest loved it. In fact our guest wanted the recipe. It was a hit.

These are hands down the best collards I've ever made or had.I got this recipe a few years ago off of here and have been making them the same since.I normally double the recipe except the onion,and use enough chicken broth to cover collards.Thank you for the recipe.

Everyone at Christmas thought that these collard greens were delicious.  I thought that they could have had 1/2 the salt.  I used the leftovers in quesadillas, pasta, and soup.

Wonderful! This was my first experience with collard greens, and they turned out great. I'm having my Dad over for Thanksgiving, for the first time since my mom passed away. I want to do a completely different dinner than Mom used to do, because Dad has been so sad. Instead of our traditional Italian antipasto and wedding soup followed by manicotti (and everyone is stuffed when the turkey is served)...I decided to make rosemary turkey, cranberry and apple stuffing, baked sweet potatoes, cornbread and collard greens! I gave the collard greens a test run tonight. I love them and will be making them often, not just for holidays. Thank you Ken for the excellent recipe.

These were awesome!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  My husband said they were the best greens he's ever eaten and we're southerners... that speaks volumes!!!  I also increased the bacon and added some brown sugar but kept the rest the same!  I'm making it again with the remainder of the greens for a family cookout in a few days!

first let me start off by stating i have never had collard greens in my life nor has my husband.  we followed the recipe to a t.  the base of this is very very very tasty.  we were kinda concerned by the texture of the greens but that is probably because we have never had them before. we simmered them for maybe an hour and they seemed ??? not crunchy but kinda tough but kinda tender ?? stem???? i gave it 2 stars because we are going to use the base sauce minus the collard greens for maybe spinach.  thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! This is the easiest recipe I have found for cooking collard greens and it turned out great. I did use more bacon and it was thick cut from the butcher. My husband and I both loved it and enjoyed the spicy 'kick'.

I am definately NOT impressed with this recipe. The taste of vinegar overwhelms the taste of pretty much everything else, and it took A LOT longer to cook than that little amount of time given.

These we amazing!  So delish.  An hour is sufficient but the longer you cook these the better.  I just used left over bacon grease, which I always keep around and I used a few tablespoons.  I too added a bit of brown sugar which I think did a great job of balancing the greasiness and the spice from the red pepper flakes, all the flavors worked perfectly together.

I cooked this and followed several of the suggestions in the reviews. The only problem I had is the greens didn't get as soft as I would like. I cooked it on the stove top for 50 minutes at a simmer then I put it in a slow cooker for another 3.5 hours. If anyone has any ideas please let me know. The flavor of these Greens was great!

YUMMY! I made this yesterday and it turned out great.  I skipped the oil and used prewashed/precut mixed greens (mustard, collard and turnip).  The only drawback is now my friends won't bring me any of theirs because they know I can make my own :)

These collards were DELICIOUS - such wonderful flavor!  I doubled the recipe for New Year's lunch and everyone loved them!  I did add a few more strips of bacon and cooked the collards for about 2 hours.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the lead of a couple other reviews and changed a few things. I added a tbsp of brown sugar, a splash of apple cider vinegar, and used some of the grease from a lb. of fried bacon. Chopped the bacon up and after frying it all up together I put it all in my slow cooker for about 4 hours.  I was magnificent.  I only wished I had cooked more.  My friends and family ranted and raved about it!

My first time cooking collard greens - and I picked an amazing recipe!!  Definitely needs more bacon - I used 1/2 pound of thick cut pepper bacon for 1 pound of collard greens.  Also they needed to cook longer - I cooked mine for about 1 hour and 15 mins before they were soft enough.  I didn't have chili flakes so I used just a pinch of cayenne pepper and also used about 2 tbpns of brown sugar to cut the acidity. Great taste!

I've never had collard greens before, so I was a little nervous about trying them, but this was delicious! I halved the recipe but still used the 3 pieces of bacon. Even my husband, who cringes at the thought of eating almost anything green, said they were "not that bad," which to me was a victory. :)

DELICIOUS! I omitted the red pepper flakes and used regular black pepper (same amount as salt) but it came out too peppery - had a bit of a bite to it. I will use black pepper again but suggest using less. I also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This was outstanding! Will definitely be making this again - thanks for sharing.

So happy I found this recipe.  A batch of this doesnt last longer than 10 minutes in my house.  My children are very picky eaters but they love these greens.  My entire family begs me to make it for every holiday.  I use ALOT more bacon, sometimes the entire pound, and I use hot sauce instead of red pepper flakes. I also add a couple dashes of vinegar.  Thank you for this spectacular recipe.

This is a WORLD CLASS recipe.  I only changed one thing and that was I used 2 smoked Turkey legs instead of Bacon.  I let the Turkey legs boil in water for about 20 minutes. In a separate stock pot I do exactly as the recipe called for (except for the bacon part) and after frying the greens up I add the water and turkey legs and a few Chicken Bouillon cube.  I let simmer for the 45 minute and Delicious…..I NEVER have Left over’s with this one!!!!!

Was my first time making collard greens...and I was NERVOUS since I was cooking them for my significant other.   

GREAT recipe.   One thing...I cooked them much longer than the recommended 45 minutes....I ended up simmering them gently for about 90 minutes to really get the flavor and tenderness I wanted.

Give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed.

To be fair, it's possible that I just don't like collard greens. But, mine turned out a little sour and not as flavorful as I've had in the past.

Neither my husband nor I typically like collard greens, so I had never cooked them before, but when we got a bunch of collards from our CSA, I thought I'd give it a try. WOW were these good!! We both went back for seconds, and I'll definitely make them again.

I make this recipe at least once each month. It's easy to assemble. The hardest part is waiting with the aroma!

This was pretty good, for having collard greens as the main ingredient.  THe greens were the perfect texture, with a soup like characteristic.  It's good to make if you have extra vegetables.

Delicious!  I've lived in the south for 20 years but this was the first time I ever cooked greens.  Very easy and adaptable.  I used turnip greens instead of collards (forgot which one I needed when I went to the store), and added extra bacon.  I tasted it after letting it simmer for a good long time...and didn't need to add any vinegar or sweetner of any kind.  Ate them with Frank's Hot Sauce and cornbread...YUM!  Next time I am going to try to season with smoked turkey necks instead of bacon to cut some calories.  Thanks for sharing.

I skipped the olive oil but followed the recipe otherwise. These were great! I like to cook them just until they are very bright green, but not bitter. Delicious!

These are excellent.  I love collard greens and this recipe is the best I've tried.  Same recipe works well for any green, try using turnip greens and adding a chopped turnip or two, yum!

I love collard greens and I was so happy to  have found this recipe that calls for olive oil, both my husband and I have high cholesterol, and by replacing some good fat for the bad fat, satisfied my taste for this dish. I've had collard greens made with ham hocks or tons of bacon, but this recipe taste just as good to me. Even my husband who didn't care for collard greens before said that this recipe was a keeper. I did however, add a tsp of garlic pwdr and a dash of apple cider vinegar...other than that, I followed the recipe as stated. Thanks Mr. Adams for sharing a wonderful recipe!

These were delicious...they(in my opinion, at least) need more than an hour, but no big deal, next time I will cook them for at least 30 minutes longer...maybe even throw them in the slow cooker...

These were sensational!  This is the first time I've eaten collard greens and actually gone back for seconds.  I didn't use olive oil at all, just the bacon grease, and I definitely added more bacon.  Also- I found that my cook time was only about 25 minutes.  I loved the red pepper flakes in them!  A great recipe!

Mmm mmm mmm!  These were great... made a Southern girl living in the North very happy!  The only change I would make is that there was a little too much bacon in every bite for me... I like my greens fairly pure.  I think I'll just leave the bacon strips whole so all that good flavor gets in there but I don't have to let the pieces interfere with my greens :)

These are really good! My mother and grandmother were both from the south and made the best greens ever. I accidentally misplaced their recipe and in a panic to find a greens recipe, found this one. It comes pretty close to theirs and tastes great! I serve mine with vinegar and Louisiana hot sauce. I will be making them on New Years day with black eyed peas.

if you're cooking for someone that's never had collard greens, you can have confidence that these will have them hooked!  a very, very good dish!  it's been a while since we've had it and we keep talking about how we can't wait to cook them again.  it's even good as a side for fried eggs and sausage.  try it.  it'll make you want to grow greens in your backyard just so you can have them on hand at all times.

I first made this dish "as is" and it was wonderful! The second time I tried using a chipotle in adobo sauce minced up in stead of red pepper flakes and threw in a couple splashes of apple cider vinegar cause I like my greens spicy! I also used bacon ends and pieces which are cheaper to buy and you don't have to crumble them. The extra fat makes the collards really delicious and quie sinful!

Delicious! My first time trying and making collard greens and was not disappointed.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added some brown sugar to cut the green's bitterness.

This is a great recipe!  I make it with frozen chopped collard greens usually.  I usually cut down on the chicken broth by half.  If there is too much broth before serving just drain it a little.  Great taste!

This is about as close as I have found to a true Southern Collard Greens recipe.  This was my first time making collards and they turned out pretty good.  I'll have to keep looking since I got mixed reviews about them.  The flavor was not overpowering, but I like it a bit more spiced up.

Totally loved these!!  My husband who is a BIG collard greens fan said these were just as good, if not better, than any he's ever tried.  I did add 2 tsp of red wine vinegar though and a dash of hot sauce once plated.  Will definitely make again and again!!

When you can impress Southerners with a collard green recipe you know it's the best.  This recipe has gotten knee-slaps and numerous demands for more.  I will make it often for my friends.  I add a little bacon and meat from smoked hocks to give the finished product more of that "down home" flavor.

Excellent!  Next time I'll plan to cook mine for at least an hour, they were still a little undone by dinner time.  I'll also maybe double up on the bacon.  The red pepper really makes the entire recipe!

We're vegetarians so I used tofu instead of bacon and they were very tasty. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I gave my sister this recipe for Thanksgiving.  She used turnip greens, unable to find collard greens.  She as well as everyone else was surprised at how good they were.  Simple to make with excellent flavor.  Will use again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awsome recipe...I'm on the second stage of a low carb diet and made the following changes.  Used Turkey Bacon (4 slices crisped), 1 frozen package of collard greens and 1 of mustard greens, three cloves of garlic and low sodium chicken broth, about 1 cup.  I can't wait to get some fresh greens.

I'm a New Englander and this is my first time trying collard greens.  Not bad, I'm sure if I was more use to this green I would like it more.  I chopped up the bacon before cooking to skip the slower method of frying then crumbling.

I bought a package of greens because they are a great anti-inflammatory food. This recipe was great! I didn't use the chili flakes, but still there was enough flavor to supply a tasty, healthful vegetable

Great recipe!  I added some brown sugar to it to help some of the bitter taste--just my personal preference, I'm more sensitive to the bitter taste of greens.  My husband loved it!

These greens were really good. A bit different from what I grew up with, but a welcome change.  My mom always put a hamhock in the water for cooking,and I think I recall a vinegar taste in hers as well, but I no longer eat pork and had been looking for a way to still be able to make tasty greens, while incorporating my family's eating style.  I substituted the pork bacon for twice the amount of turkey bacon, and my family loved it, I made it for thanksgiving for my hubby's family who'd never had greens before, and they loved it.

This is absolutely delicious. I added another bacon slice because I love bacon. 

I also signed up just to say this, about 10 minutes before it's done, I tossed in a lot of grape tomatoes, they were amazing bursts of delicate citrus. 

Just be careful don't eat too quickly because they do get hot.

We loved these greens! I’m reducing my review to four stars because I found the recipe a little greasy. But since I only had thick-cut bacon in the house, I probably used the equivalent of six regular strips of bacon. That may have been the problem. Other than that, wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again.

Okay. I have long seen these very beautiful greens in my grock store. However, they resembled weeds, and seemed like a cabbage family critter. That is what intrigged, the cabbage connect. I bought my first bale. I went to my favourite food site and found this recipe. Bacon...,I am in. I used a little more bacon, and then fried in some sliced cremini shrooms. I like to deviate.  I had a little bit too much moisture, so I thickened with a little corn starch and MILK (cream would be great!) 
DELICIOUS! My wife and 14 yr old boy  ate it up. My first collards, were beauty! Definitely I wil do it again, but I have some ideas.....ooh baby!

My favorite collard greens recipe. I’ve been making this one for the past four years or so, and the greens turn out perfect every time. I make it exactly as written, except I add a touch of apple cider vinegar at the end for some acid.

I made it just as the recipe called for!  I made it New Year’s Eve for New Year’s Day and I finally had to stop cooking them because I kept taste testing they were so good!  Luckily, I didn’t eat them all and looking forward to warming them up after sitting over night!  I would totally make this again!  Yum!

This was just what I was looking for.  
I used most of the bacon grease for another dish I was doing and am trying to cut down on fats. 
I used a bit of unsalted butter to make up for lack of bacon fat, used no olive oil, I was out.  Ooops.. 
I used two cups of an inexpensive organic low sodium chicken stock and 1 cup of water. 
Also did the 1Tbl of brown sugar. 
1 Yellow  onion.
Cooked at a low simmer for about an hour and the color and taste were just what I had hoped for.  

Be sure not to cut the collard greens down too small.

This recipe is a keeper. I would recommend using the fresh big leaf collards over the bagged variety. The time it takes to remove the stems defeats the purpose of convenience. Allowing the greens to begin the wilting process in the bacon grease and sautéed onions delivers a rich smoky flavor to this dish. I prefer spicy food and this does have a kick. However, the next time I make it, I think I’ll use a diced habanero pepper (with seeds). Thanks for adding this.

I followed the recipe except I used half the black pepper because my wife doesn't like strong pepper flavor.  It was very tasty, and there wasn't any left.

First Thanksgiving with me doing ALL the cooking. No family visit to help or teach me the recipes. Cooked these greens and they are delicious! Taste just like my family’s recipe. Added 1lb of bacon, brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.

My southern husband cooked his greens with salt pork or ham hocks. In the last 20 min. he added a bit of sorghum syrup. Made a big difference. Sometimes I use a pork chop.....

Awesome flavor and easy too! Made it as directed other than with more bacon and the bacon grease. Thank you for introducing me to the world of collard greens yum!

I’ve been making this recipe for about four years and my family absolutely loves it. The first year I made it they kind of gave me the side eye because I got a collar greens recipe off the Internet. But it’s delicious and now people call me asking for the recipe.

The only change is that I do use a full package of bacon and I use the bacon grease instead of olive oil. I also use a little bit of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar as recommended by one of the most helpful reviews for this recipe.

This is a HUGE hit during the holiday season for me. I must've shared this recipe at least 10 times and I have someone that specially requests these greens on a regular basis. The only thing that I do a little different is I cook the bacon in the microwave (I cannot, for the life of me, cook bacon on the stove) and then pour all of that good ol' bacon grease into the pot to saute the onions and garlic. I don't use the olive oil. Then I wait for the bacon to cool a bit and crumble it over the greens right before the recipe says to let it simmer. Depending on the bacon used, I may add a dash more salt, but that's about it. It's definitely a winner every time!

This was my first time making greens. I like a lot of heat so I added one jalapeno pepper along with the red pepper flakes. I will definitely make this again using thick cut bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not add the extra oil, used half the salt and about 1/4 tsp of the black pepper.
My reasoning is bacon has salt and so does the chicken broth.  As for the black pepper, red pepper flakes add a big punch!

This dish was fantastic!  The collards were extremely flavorful and tender, and the resulting broth was a salty delight.  I followed the recipe as written and served it in separate  bowls so that the broth wouldn't overwhelm the pasta I made as a main course.  The timing and ingredient mix were both perfect.  We have a share at a CSA, and I often take something over collards when they are in a choice group.  Not anymore.

I am not a fan of cooked vegetables, especially greens, but my husband and grown children are. When I was looking for a New Year's greens recipe I saw this and went with it because of the spice. It has been a staple of our New Year's dinner for over 10 years!  I'm still not a fan of cooked greens, but I have a few bites of these for luck every year. My boys are now making this themselves throughout the year!

This is a good base recipe. I used smoked turkey instead of bacon. I also added a little apple cider vinegar, sugar, and homemade hot pepper sauce. Tastes even better the next day!

Fantastic! I didn't have bacon on hand, but I had leftover bacon grease from a prior bacon. Used approximately 2T grease to saute. I also added a splash of apple cider vinegar and brown sugar per other's recommendations. I only have stock concentrate on hand so I used a tub (good for 3.5 cups of standard broth) with only 2 cups of water, 3 seemed like too much liquid, for the amount of stuff in the pan. This was the first time I made greens but it was already better than any restaurant.

Very, very  good! This was my first time making collard greens and I grew up in the South! I also omitted the olive oil. The only reason I can think of for someone adding it is if they are cooking with a non seasoned pan and then their bacon could stick. I followed the suggestions of others and added the brown sugar and splash of cider vinegar. I also added 5 more strips of  bacon.  It turned out  brilliant! Family is happy and I will try this again. Note: my father used to put a piece of white bread on his plate and spoon the pot likker over it, and then added a splash of vinegar. I've tried it, not bad!

Yum this came out SO good! I made a few additions, based on other reviews. I added a splash of apple cider vinegar, some brown sugar to balance the bitterness, and poured a little bacon fat in as well. Other than that, I followed the recipe as my base. I also let it simmer for several hours. So good and my husband loved it!

This is the recipe I usually use to make kale. I always thought collards we're so much harder/time consuming to make, but these were SO good....though I followed the advise of others and added a Tbsp of brown sugar, a big squeeze of siracha and a couple Tbsp of red wine vinegar and simmered it for a couple of hours. DELICIOUS!!!
 Even my picky eater (who hates kale) loved it!

This was a very yummy recipe! I did follow the suggestions of the other reviewers and omitted the olive oil,  doubled the bacon, added a splash of apple cider vinegar and a tablespoon of brown sugar. This packed a very nice punch and came out terrific! Even my 5 year old, who is a picky eater,  loved it and asked for seconds and thirds! I definitely recommend this recipe with those added adjustments...sure to please!

I think this recipe is awesome! It’s very easy and my family loves it! My family likes things a bit spicy, so I added a chopped fresh jalapeño and a little more red pepper flakes. I also added a couple pieces of bacon extra because I had them and needed to use them. In a nutshell, this is an easy, delicious, recipe and my family already wants me to make it again!

Amazing.  Just what I would expect from any southern greens recipe with bacon and exactly what I wanted.  I like to add some extra bacon sometimes  as we are bacon lovers. Thank you!

I grew up in the south but this was my first time actually making collard greens. I really loved the flavor, the only thing I changed was a recommendation in the comments to add a bit of brown sugar and apple cider. My NJ husband wasn’t a huge fan but I’ll definitely be making this for my southern parents.

This is an outstanding recipe that even the non-greens fan in my family liked. To add a little more kick, I drizzled malt vinegar over my serving. Perfect.

I had never tried collards in my life. They don’t even sell them in Puerto Rico. That said I moved to Florida and soon saw those in stores and asked myself what they were. I’m an adventurous person when it comes to food so sure enough I wanted to try them. Found this recipe and said to myself.. “it’s easy enough”. I have no words to describe how delicious I found this to be... the flavor is out of this world. I’ve never had greens this tasty! So I make this at least once or twice a month now and I never get tired of it!

Family enjoyed these. Did not add salt and pepper, but did use 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and used low sodium chicken broth still could taste salt from bacon. Good recipe, thanks for sharing!

Best collards! The only change I made was to cut the fat by preparing the crispy bacon by itself in the microwave, crumbling it and adding it to the ‘mix.’ FYI for folks new to collards - prep the leaves by removing either all of the stem or at least up to the base of the leaf.

I grew up on collard greens but hadn't had them for many years. Found some in a local produce market and had to bring them home! This recipe was very good, but agree with other reviewers that using ham hocks may be more authentic.

These were great collard greens.  I added sliced red and yellow peppers at the end and cooked until just tender.  They added nice color to the greens.  Cooked this for a pot luck and everyone devoured them.  Thanks, Ken.

I doubled the recipe.  I added  1-lb ham slice, cubed. It made the greens more salty than most people like, but I loved them, and so did my dinner guest. I used five collard bunches grown in my own back yard, too!  A friend who is an Arkansas native thought it was sacrilege that I added onion and garlic, but that made them delicious in my opinion!!

I love this and make it all the time.  I have made it exactly as the recipe instructs, and also made it using "power greens" instead of collard greens which I like a little more.  From time to time I will use garlic and onion powder which my kids prefer to the dices of onion.

I am so glad I found this recipe!  Delicious!

Tastes fantastic, perfect touch of heat. Only thing I did differently was cook them just a tad longer, just out of preference.

I followed the recipe, but added 3 extra slices of bacon and used 2 bunches of greens. Who doesn't like more smokey bacon?  It came out a little salty with the extra bacon.  Next time I'll omit the added salt, and salt to taste at the end, or at the table.  Good recipe for 4 hungry people.

Made it exactly as directed— and it was great!  This was our family’s first time trying collard greens, and even my SUPER picky 6 year old son gave it 2 thumbs up!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was fantastic! I added an extra slice of bacon and used tbsp on bacon grease instead of oil to sauté the onions and garlic but changed nothing else. Perfect recipe.

The best! I’ve made these many times and my man will do ANYTHING for these greens. Substituted smoked turkey leg for the bacon and added a bit of sugar and a splash of vinegar to take off the bite.

I just finished a 3-day water fast before returning to my usual targeted keto diet after carb-binging for the holidays. It’s recommended not to eat meat to break a fast, so decided to have 2 servings of this and a side of eggs as my first meal. This was my first time cooking collard greens and it turned out excellent and had a surprising kick to it. I made 3 minor substitutions: (1) I used avocado oil instead of olive oil (with which I don’t cook above medium heat due to the smoke point), (2) I finished off a carton of chicken bone broth instead of plain broth (because I drank some before eating to warm up my stomach), and (3) I added an extra tsp of salt (because the broth was unsalted). This dish was surprisingly delicious and easy on the stomach. Never thought I’d be excited to eat collard greens, let alone leftover collard greens. Thanks!

So delicious! We could have eaten this for dinner! I omitted the oil and cook the whole pound of bacon. Prior to cooking the bacon, I used scissors to cut the bacon into the heated pot. Then there is no back and forth with the bacon. Make sure you have some crusty bread for the left over broth! Oh so delicious!

Very good, easy with a bit of a kick.  Did add a little more bacon and used beef broth instead of chicken.  Came out perfect using cast iron pan.

Easy and delicious-  leave the lid off at the end if you like less fluid but the broth is delish !  Make sure you  over cook the bacon so it totally crumbles back I —. otherwise  it will be rubbery with less taste.  I also removed the hard stems - however it cooks  long enough that you could leave them in for more texture.  Either way the leaves become very tender.

Great except cooking it fir that long overlooks the collards. I blanched them in boiling water for 5 minutes, then added to the pan and fried it another 5 minutes. No need for chicken stock. Perfect!

First time ever making collard greens and we both enjoyed them.  The only change I made was to use a lot more bacon than called for and more greens.  It will be on regular menu from now on.

I’ve been looking to find an approximation of my former mother-in-laws greens for ages.  This nailed it.  She was an old southern Louisana cook we called Big Mama.   These taste most like the memories....thank you someone for the post.

Not a greens person, but this was fantastic.  My hubby, a southern boy, says they were the best he ever tasted.  I added the apple cider vinegar and brown sugar like suggested.  The next time I make them, I will cut the salt to 1/2 t and then salt at the table.  Too salty for me.

I added this recipe to my collection. I reduced the pepper to 1/2 t and did not use pepper flakes as I can't eat spicy foods due stomach issues. I also used 4 cups chicken broth as a box has 4 cups in it and it made it easier as I had nothing else to cook to use up the other cup.  As another reviewer mentioned adding brown sugar I also took that recommendation and added 1T, next time I'll try 2T.  I cooked this for 2.5 hours as they were not done at 45 minutes.  I thought it was very good.

I made this only making 2 modifications - I cooked 5 instead of 3 slices of bacon.  Also I bypassed the olive oil and cooked the onions in the bacon grease.  It tastes REALLY good and the broth made with the chicken stock is delicious!  I would say 3 slices of bacon is not nearly enough - the 5 i put isn't enough, if you want bacon in every bite then I'd do 8-10 slices of bacon.  That's what I'm going to do next time.

I followed the recipe the first time. Oh! I actually sautéed the onion in a couple table spoons of bacon grease. Other than that I followed it completely. They were delicious!

This Yankee had never made (or eaten) collard greens before. Making this recipe was like tasting ice cream for the first time. I'm not saying I'd rather have greens than ice cream, but these veggies blew me away. All family members approved and asked to have them in regular rotation. Of course, I did triple the bacon, which tends to make everything better; added a T of brown sugar and a couple teaspoonsish of apple cider vinegar per other reviewers; and cooked way longer, maybe an hour and a half.

One thing is missing from this recipe, you must look over fresh greens for bugs  and you have to wash the leaves to be sure any dirt is gone. I feel bottom of sink for dirt after letting water out and then I wash 2 more times.

I would give this a five star rating, but it was too salty. With bacon and chicken broth, it would have been more than salty enough without adding any salt.

First time eating collards and it was delicious! I used about 5 slices of bacon and that was plenty. Left out the oil - however in my stainless steel pan the bacon did start to stick until I turned it so I can see spraying the pan at least might help. Just used garlic salt for minced garlic and didn't use the  red pepper. I salted it before serving and I shouldn't have bothered. Was very salty from broth. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was my  first time to make collard greens.  Per my very Southern mother, these were the best greens she has ever eaten! I stayed pretty true to the recipe making only the following changes:  I used Tony Cachere's instead of salt (always); I did not have garlic so I used garlic powder instead; and, I followed the reviews to add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  I did not have apple cider vinegar as recommended in the reviews so I substituted with a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also did not have 3 cups of chicken stock so I diluted 2 cups with 1 cup of water.  I'm patting myself on the back for this one because Mom said they were better than even her mother's or grandmother's.  Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions in the reviews.

Very tasty side dish; enjoyed by all - including my 3 year-old granddaughter!  For those who need to watch their salt intake, I recommend using low-sodium chicken broth and skip the added teaspoon of salt too. Bon appetite!

My family loves vegetables of almost any kind, but we had never tried collard green. When I found out how healthy they are,  I had my husband buy some. I followed this recipe to the letter, except that I used 1 1/2 times everything since my husband bought 1 1/2  pounds of collard greens. I didn't add the olive oil to cook the bacon in since bacon produces plenty of grease. The recipe didn't specify to dump the bacon grease, so I left it in the pan to cook the onions and garlic.  All of us loved this recipe, and I will definitely make it again. Half of what I made was enough for 3 of us, so I froze the other half for another meal. Since it takes a bit of time to make this, I plan to make at least 2 or 3 times the recipe to have enough to freeze for later.

These are really good.  Reminds me of my grandmother's green beans with bacon grease...If you do cook more bacon to add to these, you will have much more grease when you add in the onions/garlic/greens, which may turn off some folks.  You can always pour some out too, but goodness it's good!

This is my second time doing this recipe. Four stars for it on its own, if you follow these directions. Five stars if you double the bacon, add 1/3rd cup apple cider vinegar (cutting down the chicken broth a bit), and one heaping tablespoon of brown sugar.

Best greens I've had in a long time. First time I've made them myself and loved these. Modified from other reviews. Cooked for an hour, used 6 slices of bacon, half large onion, tablespoon of brown sugar, at least 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. I couldn't get a whole 2lbs of greens at my local store, used just a pound. Wish I had more.

AMAZING!!! Terrific flavor. I used beef broth and brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. I stuck with 3 strips of bacon and used turkey bacon which still tasted great! I cooked them in an Instant Pot, sautéing the bacon with the onions and garlic then wilting the greens as instructed. I pressure cooked them on low for 40 minutes, next time I’ll do 35 as they were a little too mushy. I’ll be making these regularly, wonderful recipe!

This is my now go-to recipe for collard greens!! My family raves about it! The ONLY thing I did was add more bacon. Only because you can never have enough bacon. Sooo good!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Tasty but  fairly salty as written.  If I make this again I'll either cut the salt in half or use low sodium chicken broth.

I had no idea what this was supposed to taste like never having had it before but it  came out so delicious and my home smells GREAT.  I'm trying to add new veggies and collared greens was this months choice.  After reading a lot of the reviews I added extra bacon, 2 tbs. brown sugar and 1 tbs. of apple cider vinegar. I don't think I had a lb. of greens so I only used 2 cups of chicken broth. I served it on top of a heated knish and it was crazy good.  Thank you all so much for your input, it really helped.

Had to make a change because I didn't have chicken broth. Instead used a cup of leftover onion soup and water to make up the 3 cups. Otherwise, it was the same and we really liked the results. Thanks!

So, I used this recipe as an idea starter, I never follow recipes as written and what I made was absolutley delicious.

First, I tripled the amount of bacon, cut it into bite size pieces, and fried it in a pan with the onions and garlic until carmelized. I removed the broth from the recipe as I don't want soupy greens, I want FRIED greens. I then added the rest of the ingredients cooking the greens to wilted but tender and not overcooked. For a delicious finishing touch, I added some butter and shrimp and cooked to opaque.

These were the best greens I had ever tasted.

It did not make us lovers of greens, but they were enjoyable.  I would make it again if I had collards to use up.

The Collard Greens were a perfect side for our roast chicken dinner.  I modified the recipe a bit by using just 2 cups of bone broth instead and added 1/4 cup of organic apple cider vinegar.

This was good for New Year's Day.  A little too much broth though - wound up pouring some of the broth down the drain at the end of the batch.  Good flavor though.

Delicious. Like other reviewers I doubled the bacon and used only the bacon grease (no olive oil). Added 1 tsp brown sugar when adding broth. Simmered longer for extra tender greens (personal preference)

One of the best, quickest, and easiest ways to make collards! I had always let them simmer with a knuckle (still my favorite) for hours. Now I can whip them up in half the time! CHANGE NOTHING!! This recipe is perfect the way it is!

Surprisingly good. My wife loves it just the way it is but not everyone is a fan. After making this a couple of times, I started adding some BBQ sauce and now it is more popular.

I used this recipe as a guide for cooking rainbow chard (collard greens were sold out at the store) Used bacon grease instead of olive oil (in addition to grease from bacon slices). Doubled bacon slice amounts. Used black peppercorns and mustard seed, as well as chopped fresh red jalapeño.

This was a hit! I followed the recipe and some reviews add ins. I added 1tbs of  Brown sugar, 2 tsp of apple vinegar, and 1/2 a fresh sliced jalapeño. I’ve been trying for years with different recipes to get the Greens close to what my mother in law made for my husband growing up and this was the closest and a hit.

I made this for my wife and In-laws for Thanksgiving. My in-laws had never had collard greens before. I used everything in the recipe list minus the crushed red pepper flakes as my mom in-laws doesn't like spicy food. They loved it!! I had a couple of shots of the pot liquor after dinner. I would definitely make these again.

Perfect as is!  Thank you for posting a simple recipe that omits the apple-cider vinegar during the cooking process.  We thoroughly enjoyed your recipe.  It works equally well with mixed greens such as collards, turnips, mustard, and Swiss chard.
Taste like my mother and aunts used to make.

I really enjoyed this recipe & will make it again. One minor change I did make was to add 1 cube of chicken bouillon (knor) and no salt to the 3cups of water before adding to the collard greens. Tks for sharing this recipe!

Skip the olive oil, it's not needed.  Why cook bacon in oil?  I chop up the bacon and fry it in the dry pot, stirring it often.  When it's crisp, add the onions.  When they're translucent, add the garlic and pepper flakes.  Then add the greens, broth and salt.  The bacon leaves a lot of flavor on the bottom that will deglaze as the greens cook.  Oil would prevent that.  This makes the best greens I've ever tasted.  And, no sugar.

It’s easy to make and tastes wonderful. I don’t like many cooked vegetables but this will get me eating greens! I added more garlic and chile flakes for more spice.

Very good recipe but a bit heavy on the salt and broth.  Cut the salt in half and maybe 2.5 cups of broth.  Add a few shots of Mclhenny.

I’ve never made more had greens before, so I have nothing to compare them to, but I did like these a lot and will make them again. I made them exactly as written only used a little extra bacon and didn’t have any onion so I used dehydrated onion pieces.

This is the best collard greens I've ever had, and I was raised on southern collards and cornbread. Just amazing. No additions needed. It's perfect. Family ate it all and used cornbread to soak up the pot likker.

Used this recipe last week, goes great with a pot of beans and fried catfish. I did add more bacon, ham hocks, and carrots. The carrots were a last minute addition, had some that needed to be used. They did give the greens a nice texture. I also increased the cooking time, cooked on med for about 2 hours, then covered and simmered on low for about 1-2 hours. While simmering I did serve. The addition of ham hocks with the bacon was great, allot of flavor! I also used all fresh ingredients, and used chicken stock from a meal the day before. Will surely use this again!

This is a similar recipe on a bag of collard greens I purchased from the grocery store. I also add 1 TB brown sugar and a dash of white vinegar along with red pepper flakes to taste. This is my favorite collard greens recipe and not as much fat as cooking with a ham hock yet very flavorful.

This was my first time cooking fresh collard greens.  I didn't have 45 minutes to simmer them, so I took a short-cut, steaming them in the microwave for 8-10 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written, with plenty of red pepper flakes. It was delicious! We like braised kale and swiss chard, and found the collard greens to be very flavorful with great texture. Will be making these often.

I don't love collard greens, and while I didn't love this recipe either, I liked it more than other collard greens recipes I've tried!  So for collard greens, it gets 5 stars. :)  I did sub liquid smoke for the bacon only because it was a weeknight and saved me the time and mess of bacon.  I used 1/4 tsp.  Could probably increase to 1/2 tsp.  Cheers.

This is a good staple side for me.  My kids like anything with bacon (I use a whole package for 2 lbs. of greens), so a pile of vegetables disappears a lot easier and with out any fussing :)

One tip that makes prep a little more work, but I think improves the overall taste is that I cut the ribs out of the greens.  I think I make ~2lbs (de-ribbed) at a time, and probably only use 4 cups of chicken stock.  I also only use one onion for the whole (2lb) thing.  I think one (assuming its a fairly large one) would be much to much for a single lb. of greens.

Great recipe however I did need to make a few modifications. I also made it with kale as opposed to traditional collard greens. And instead of bacon I used liquid smoke!

My family and friends said it was the 'best collard greens ever!'  Will definitely make them again - one addition I made was I added a cup of Apple Cider Vinegar - about 15 minutes before the greens were down simmering.....

SO good! If you're a fan of the famous Sylvia's brand collard greens, you'll love this recipe, and it's great for Paleo/Atkins followers.  Based on other reviews, I made the following adjustments: I omitted the olive oil and doubled the amount of bacon. The oil is unnecessary as you have plenty of bacon fat in the pan to cook the onions later. I doubled the garlic, and if you have to ask why, I'm sorry, we can't be friends. (Always double the garlic. Always.)  I added 2 TBSP of Apple Cider Vinegar, which definitely added a nice flavor, but I did not follow the suggestions of other posters and add any brown sugar, because I'm cutting carbs right now.  I didn't miss it, and the greens were not bitter in any way. Last but not least, I used 2 cups of Turkey Stock and 1 cup of Chicken Stock because that's what I had in the house and needed to use it up.  The turkey stock added a richness that put this recipe over the top.  Once I'd added everything in, I put it all in the crockpot on low for a couple of hours to really let it cook down, and it was fantastic.  I've read that the longer it sits, the better, so you could throw this together in the morning and leave it simmering in the crockpot all day, if you choose.   I left the other spices "as written" and didn 't have to make any other adjustments.  Try this one and enjoy!

I tried it because it was a different take on greens. It was good. I have never used olive oil for greens. I would make this again, might try bacon with peppercorns.

1) Make sure you get GOOD bacon. That's the biggest secret to my list of tweaks. If there is a store that does housemade bacon or a deli that makes it direct, buy it! You won't regret it. 
2) After you fry up the bacon to release all the good bacon fat, remove it from the pan and set it aside. Do not add it to the collard greens until you've got 15 minutes left before serving. 
3) I added at least 1 tbsp of the chili flakes because helloo don't be afraid of seasoning and spice! 
4) When you saute the collard greens, I let mine sit a little and get 'smoky' to get that smoky taste. 

5) There's no need to fry the minced garlic - it burns really easily so just add to the collard greens as they're simmering
6) I added 1/2 - 1 tbsp of brown sugar to rid the greens of their bitter edge
7) Make sure you simmer on medium-low heat for at least 45 minutes - ideally an hour
8) Last tweak : I used 2 Rapunzel vegetable broth cubes with sea salt. There's no need for all the extra msg and salt in chicken broth - you should really be able to get the taste of meat and smoke from your wilted greens and the GOOD bacon.

Buy good bacon, use better than bullion instead of stock, more flavor! 

First time ever making greens. It seems like you should know this, but the flavor comes from the bacon, I par cooked mine, so good! I've been using this stuff called better than bullion (don't have a lot of storage space for cartons of stock) the flavor was so delicious, more concentrated than a stock would be.

If I remember, I made it according to the recipe. First experience with collard greens, and it was SO worth it! Now spinach is not the only cooked greens I will eat. Making again tomorrow for my son, the chef.

Adding brown sugar and apple cider vinegar is a must.  The longer this cooks, the better.  Fresh collards are much better than the bagged kind and don't take as long too cook.  Very good!

Yes, I will make it again but I had hoped that the stock would have been absorbed into the greens. I did not waste the stock/juices that were left. It did take additional 20 minutes for my greens to soften but overall a very tasty dish that my husband appreciated.

Made it, loved it, slight variations due to my lack of ingredients per recipe....used ham instead of bacon & used green onion bottoms (white part) since I was out of yellow/white onions. Best greens I've ever tasted so far & such a simple recipe!

I have never prepared collards before, but grew some in my garden this year.  This recipe was excellent.  The only change I made was to follow a suggestion by another reviewer and use 6 slices of bacon.  I will make this again.  My wife who is from the South really loved it.

This is slap-your-face GOOD. All ingredients exactly by the recipe, except cut the olive oil and just use the bacon fat. I found three thick-cut slices quite adequate. I just want the flavor and enough fat for the initial sauté to get the aromatics going. You get all that without sacrificing arterial health with a reasonable and moderate 3-slice limit. The use of a maple cured bacon provided the slightest touch of sweetness to the bitter greens — proof positive that great southern-stye greens do NOT need added sugar for excellent balance. Give the greens their full 45 mins simmer. (They do not need hours! They'll be great after the cooking time specified, but it won't harm them to simmer longer either.) Mellow, substantial flavors are perfect when served immediately, and leftovers age well when covered in the refrigerator, and are even more delicious after a day or even a week or two. Pour them into a pot and bring to a simmer to reheat. EASY! So make a lot for take-and-heat lunches or an encore side dish at another simple supper in a week or 10 days. That is, if they aren't devoured before that!

Made this according to directions and it turned out great.  My husband thought it looked questionable but once he tasted it he definitely liked it.  Will make this again for sure.

This is undoubtedly the best recipe for collards. I made 'as is' and everyone loved them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I actually substituted turnips for the collards and it was AMAZING! I did 1 tsp of red pepper flakes because we like more spicy/hot flavor on our greens.

Wonderful!  So full of flavor!  It was my first attempt at greens and this recipe was easy to follow. My husband declared that these were better than a lot of greens that he gets at restaurants. Yay!

Easy, great recipe. Used about twice the amount of bacon called for and also added a few 1/2" pieces of smoked sausage. Turned out wonderful and will definitely  cook again!

One major modification I made was preparing the bacon in a separate pan and only using about a tablespoon of bacon grease for sautéing. I also omitted the olive oil. I can't imagine cooking greens in 4 pieces of bacons worth of grease!! No. I also added more than a pinch of red pepper flakes and made it with mustard greens instead.

Really good collard greens...instead of red pepper flakes I added a dash of hot sauce and also added a tablespoon of cider vinegar. Delicious!

We decided to try our hand at traditional Southern food, so this was on the menu.  It was my favorite part of the meal.  My only change was to leave out the crushed red pepper because we don't care for spice.

Loved it.  Second time makin it but first time using the bacon. And yes I used a pound of bacon and two pounds of greens. Came out awesome.  I used chicken stock and really didn't do anything different to the recipe. I love it bc it's easy and fast. I did let them cook simmer for about two hours on a very low setting since they were for dinner the next day annnnd I started cooking them at 11:30 pm. Yes I'm a night owl ????

I used mustard greens (about 2-2.5lbs with stems cut out) and followed others suggestions to use 8 slices of bacon, used about half a package of bacon.  My mother-in-law loved my mustard greens and stated that she liked them better than hers! I was so honored - she loves to cook. I would definitely make this again.

it's really sad, I'm not use to measuring out my food because I've always cooked for too many people. I used the recipe (as far as supplies) and eyed all the measurements. let me explain it's nothing wrong with the recipe I'm just a lil challenged in that department. I ended up using 2 packs of bacon, X-D poured in the oil by eye, chopped up some jalapeño (4) sprinkled the pepper flakes in for taste and salt and pepper, and used 6 bags of collards because they always shrivel up to nothing. my husband told his mom that i can make the greens because he likes mines, but it's honestly your recipe, and my mom's sense of eyeing food hahas. it was delicious!

I get asked to make this recipe often by family and friends.  It is very simple to make yet it is full of flavor and the collards have a    firm delightful texture.  This recipe is delicious as is and I also enjoy it with the addition of Trader Joe's South African Smoke seasoning.  Yummy.

Delicious!  Made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Sauteed a shallot, 4 cloves garlic and 1/4 chopped jalapeno in oil with red pepper flakes.  Used vegetable broth, and added 6 slices chopped bacon, 1 tsp of cajun seasoning, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp brown sugar and 2 tsp apple cider vinegar with the greens as per recommendations.  Will definitely make again.

This was the first time I had cooked collard greens and my native South Texan husband said that they were good..and they were.  I had some frozen bacon, so I sliced off pieces to equal probably 2 bacon strips, used about half the collards we had, diced up an onion.  I started the bacon in the pot, and got it separated and tossed the onions and garlic in (lots of garlic), got the onions translucent, the bacon pieces all looking cooked, and threw the collards in.  Added the chicken broth, and added Penzy's Florida pepper blend.  There were NONE left, and my husband said I can do them again with this recipe.

Fantastic recipe, and easy to make. I added a little apple cider vinegar after tasting, but that is a personal preference. My kids prefer it without the vinegar, and it is great without too. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband won't eat greens so my opportunities to enjoy them don't come often. I across this recipe and tried it and my taste buds are dazzled! When I was growing up in the south my grandmother made them but she never added bacon. If she had my grandfather would have had his potion and ours too! It makes such a difference in the flavor. I made them today, just for me ;-)

Have made this at least 4 times.  I omit the olive oil, use 3 or 4 strips of bacon, and add 1 T of cider vinegar (or sherry vinegar) and sometimes 1 T of brown sugar.  My only critique of the main recipe is that it calls for way too much broth.  For 1 lb. collards (weighed before trimming) I think only 1 to 1 1/2 cups broth are needed.  Simmer on low for around 40 min. and can add a little more liquid if needed.  Tonight I served it as a side to shrimp and grits.  This NY gal needs a trip South!

This is an excellent receive as is, however, I added about 1/2 cup corn.  I saluted the corn with the bacon before adding the onions.  I also shredded the greens in the food processor.
    I got raves on this dish because the flavor was perfect and the corn added a little color and crunch that is missing in cooked greens.

Guilty.
I ate the whole thing.  I took a bite, and one thing led to another, and suddenly there were no more Kickin' Collards left in my pan.  See, I'm new to the whole collard greens scene.  I love vegetables, and real good down-home cooking, and this.. Whoa nelly, this is something I'll be making frequently.  I did follow other suggestions by reviewers and used a packed TB of brown sugar and a splash of cider vinegar.  I also cooked them longer than suggested (a few hours), cooked them in 2 TBs of bacon grease instead of oil, and added one extra slice of bacon.  I love the bacon, but I didn't want it to overthrow the greens.  Truly a work of art, and thank you all so much.  
Maybe I'll make that second # of greens I have in the fridge....

I had the best collard greens in a restaurant in Savannah Georgia that were phenomenal.  Had never made them, but after trying this recipe, and I followed the recipe exactly as written, they tasted just as good!  Have made this recipe twice and will continue to use this recipe whenever I make greens again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was delicious with just the right amount of heat.  I used turkey bacon to be a little healthy.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this with a side of cornbread.  I will definitely make this again!!

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I do make a few changes. As others noted, more bacon is good, and I use bacon grease to saute the veggies in. And I add a tablespoon of brown sugar. But the thing that really puts this over the top is using beef broth instead of chicken broth. I accidentally grabbed beef broth once when making this, and could not BELIEVE the difference. I'll never go back.

Great recipe. I didn't use oil. I also used veal bacon instead of pork and vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I let it simmer for an extra 15 min. It came out amazing, but a bit too salty for my palette. The bacon is pretty salty so I think next time I won't add a pinch of salt.

Thank you for this recipe!  I made a few changes only because of my personal preference and I had two pounds of greens.  I only used salt and pepper for seasoning. Also, I added a chicken bullion cube (I did use chicken broth), a whole pack of bacon, touch of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Oh, and a half TBS of butter.  These are the best greens ever and they cooked quickly!

Porcini mushrooms cooked down very little and absorbed all the flavors. Were still slightly firm and gave an interesting added texture!

The stuff I made from this recipe tasted wonderful!  Instead of "collard" greens, I used a bag of mixed greens that I bought at the grocery store.  I forgot to put in the onion, though!  For the bacon, I fried it in the same pan I made the greens in, but I REMOVED the bacon and just added the broth and greens to the bacon grease that was in the bottom of the pan.  Once everything was cooked, the last thing I did was add the bacon back in so it wouldn't get too soggy.  I must say, I really outdid myself tonight!  I highly recommend this to anyone . . . it's great stuff!

I haven't made greens much and only a few times have I had great greens. This recipe definitely produces some good greens. I think it would benefit from something smokier than bacon but the flavor overall was good. And the recipe is so easy to make!

Surprisingly easy! Delicious! I cut out the stems from my collard greens, lay the leaves on top of each other and roll them up to cut them up. I've made this recipe several times for multiple people and they always love them. Thank you for this recipe.

First time cooking collard greens and used some of the tips.   Absolutely recommend more bacon, cooking w the grease, brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.  Delicious!!

amazing, my fiances friend from the south said they were better than his grandmas..this was my first time making collard greens, and wont be the last. I put in 7 pieces of bacon, no onions, no peppers. I wont use as much bacon next time, too many chunks of it...3 is enough. Great recipe

I used three large bunches of collards and 10 oz of uncured hickory bacon.  I increased the onion and garlic and used generous amounts of red pepper as well.  A splash of apple cider vinegar and the lemon juice at the end are a must.   After eating a bowl of the greens, I drink the pot liquor -- it is so good!

Never made these before and this was soooo good that everytime I make it, I follow this recipe. Minus the oil, I just use the bacon grease. It is super tasty and has just enough of a spice to it, not too hot ;-)

I've made this several times with  a few different changes each time depending on available ingredients.  Tonight I added smoked turkey neck instead of bacon,  a few extra garlic cloves, green and red peppers and kale.  I put everything in my pressure cooker for 25 minutes.  It was soooo goooood!

I have tried so many different recipes to make collards and now that I've found this one I will use it from now own. I think sautéing the greens with the bacon made all the difference. I take these to my inlaws ever new years and these got eaten up!

This was my first time to eat collard greens ever...in over 50+ years. I was always skeptical, but this recipe was really good! 
I DID add my own touch , to reduce the slightly bitter aftertaste of the collards. Halfway through the slow simmer, I added Granny Smith chopped apple and about a half cup of raw organic apple juice. Tastes wonderful !!

This was yummy but too spicy.  I think it has way too much pepper.  I will cut in half (or maybe a quarter) next time I make it.

Yum Yum!  I used 2 pounds of Turnip Greens and a whole pound of bacon.  Don't need the olive oil, use the bacon grease!
Used one whole onion as the recipe stated. One 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth was plenty for 2 lbs. of greens.  As others suggested, I added 1 TBS brown sugar and 1 TBS cider vinegar. 
After greens were wilted, I transferred to crock pot and cooked on low for 3 - 4 hours.  Yum Yum.

This has been my go-to recipe for collards for a couple years now.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  I use beef broth instead of chicken broth though.   Beef broth is much better for my taste.

We all really loved it, but I made many changes to the recipe.  I used .5 pound plus of bacon. I added an extra pinch of red pepper flakes,  added 1 heaping tbsp of brown sugar, and a couple of dashes of apple cider vinegar.  I also removed most of the stems from the greens.    After cooking it as shown, I put it all in a slow cooker for a couple of hours while waiting to take it to a friend's house.  This is hard to overcook.

I had never made collard greens before and decided to do so for my New Year's Day dinner. Unknown to me to cut the stems out I cooked them with the stems any way but this flavorful recipe made no difference. I did also simmer them with pieces of ham hock only because it seemed like the natural thing to do. :)' My family loved them! They were shocked they came out so good being my first time. The pot was empty!!!

I only had 2 cups of chicken broth so I added a cup of water and a beef bouillon cube along with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, a teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of garlic salt. I also used salt pork instead of bacon. My family absolutely loved the outcome and this has become the family's annual recipe. I have lived in the south my whole life so collard greens are gospel in these parts and making them wrong could have family splitting devastating effects. this recipe is great. My own tweaks are taken from other long used recipes that I find give a real southern balance to this recipe.

I used spinach, instead of collard greens.  It took a fourth of the chicken broth and it only needed to cook for 5-10 minutes to soften.  The rest of the directions are the same.  It was very well received and loved by all at my party.

This is my go-to greens recipe!   Works for kale too. I typically chop the bacon first and add a little apple cider vinegar (a capful) near the end of cooking. 
I'm trying to lose  weight now, so I need a no-bacon option. Any ideas?

I've tried a few recipes  and this one's the best. Instead of bacon, I added turkey bacon and smoked turkey.  I almost ate the whole pot and had to make more to ensure I had enough for my guests.

Amazing!   I used a mixture of collards and kale and followed the instructions exactly except cooked them a couple hours simmering on the stove.   Highly recommend!

Went to our local fresh market this morning for the first time and figured heck I'll buy some of these beautiful collards.  I have never made them myself, but oh my WORD!! This is just remarkably good. I might reduce the pepper a bit for myself next time (only cause I'm a wuss), but otherwise, these taste perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe and for not adding sugar! Its perfect for ketogenic veggie side :)

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, using prewashed and bagged collard greens in the grocery aisle. It was delicious! I served it as a side dish to a group of friends at a Mardi Gras themed murder mystery dinner party and didn't have any leftovers.

LOL I literally just freaked out because I googled "kickass collard greens" and couldn't find this beloved recipe, and thought it was gone from the internet.  I've been making this for a couple of years now, and always throw in a splash of apple cider vinegar like one reviewer suggested.  SO GOOD!!! I also only use 1/2 an onion, and since I'm vegetarian leave out the bacon & use vegetable broth.

So tasty! I made a few changes though—no olive oil used (not needed for the bacon), used 4 cloves minces garlic and omitted the onions, and probably used 1/2 tsp of fresh ground black pepper instead of a full tsp.

This was my first time making greens and they were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly however I added a few more slices of bacon and it was great. I think I may have used too much salt because they were initially very salty, so I added some brown sugar at the end like some other reviewers did and that helped cut the saltiness down. Very good recipe

This was fantastic!! My only addition was cannellini (white kidney beans). They added a wonderful creaminess to an already awesome recipe. I will absolutely be making this again!

I did everything except for adding bacon instead I used a pork neck bone and added the broth to it until it came to a boil on medium-high heat.I also like my food a little tangy so in the greens I add 2 tablespoon of vinegar.these were AMAZING

Great receipe, the only change I made was substituting smoked turkey for the bacon. Saute the smoke turkey wings with the onions and garlic, once the onions are translucent add enough water to cover the turkey (I didn't use the chicken broth, the smoke turkey will create its own). Cover and cook until meat is falling off the bone. Add Collards, cook until desired texture...YUM! Such flavor!

Have had and made greens for a long time and this straight forward recipe absolutely rocks!  Have made with Collards and Kale (together and separately) and it always delivers.  Only difference - more bacon, but we're a meat eating family :).

This is my go-to recipe for collard greens. I absolutely love collard greens, and this recipe has them turn out so tasty every time! And the bit of red pepper flake gives it the perfect kick. I put a little extra bacon (4 slices), reduce salt to 1/2 tsp, and a add 1/8 tsp of red pepper flake for a little extra kick. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

More bacon, use the bacon fat once bacon is crisp, add butter not oil, double the onions and I used 10 lrg cloves garlic, can't remember if the receipt called for apple cider vinegar but I added a quarter cup. I also added cayenne pepper. Delicious!!!

These are absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I made them almost exactly as instructed. I did add a little more meat than was called for and they were so good! My 7 year old son ate them and LOVED them. Cook them just like the recipe says and you will love them!

Edit: The only thing I do different now is double the recipe!! I've tried this recipe with turnip, mustard, and collard greens and all are SO GOOD!!! Make these! Like, right now!!!

This was very good. I thought it was a little bit on the salty side though, but my husband didn't think so. I would omit the extra salt and look for a lower sodium chicken broth next time. But overall it was delicious and will be made again with slight alterations!

We liked this very much I didn't make any big changes, it was slightly bland in flavor but I'm sure a little more salt and some hot sauce would do the trick also I didn't use a lot of bacon fat so I would use more bacon next time or smoked turkey, it cooked very tender in 20 mins or so. If you get tender young collards it will cook fast and almost melt in your mouth. I think the chicken broth is a must for flavor.

I am not a fan of Collard greens and normally do not eat them, but WOW!  Absolutely delicious!  Made this for my family of 3 and there just wasn't enough.  The only change I made was to toss in some Kale with the Greens and added an extra slice or 2 of bacon.  I also didn't over cook them into mush, just right.  But it still takes a lot of cooking.  First time I ever made Greens and I will search no further for a recipe.  This one is perfect!  Yummy!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much.  I didn't have bacon so it didn't have that flavor.  I added 1/4 each of red wine and vinegar, gnocchi for an added dimension.  I'll definitely make this recipe again, trying bacon once.

Although I have been exploring recipes from allrecipes.com for years now, this is my very first review! I grew up in the northeast and currently live in California, but my paternal grandmother was (God rest her soul) from North Carolina. She fostered in me an appreciation for southern cooking. As such I came to love dishes like this - collard greens. Let me tell you: this recipe is AMAZING!! I did add 2 tpsp of brown sugar and 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar, but nonetheless this recipe was heaven in my mouth!!

I needed a recipe for the collards that came in our CSA box, and this recipe was great!  It's easy and delicious.  I made it with vegetable stock so that I could add my own amount of salt, but followed everything else. Very happy and we'll make it again!

I doubled the ingredients but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing!  

My family has been in Florida for many generations and I like to think that we are experts when it comes to collard greens.  I used to love those my grandmother grew in her garden and cooked up for Sunday dinner.  This recipe is at least as good as those she grew and made many years ago.  I highly recommend this recipe and I will definitely be making it again.  

The recipe doesn't list salt as an ingredient, but you will need plenty.  Accordingly, you probably shouldn't bother with using Low-Sodium Chicken Broth.  Just use the regular version and then add more salt.

The recipe calls for pinches of red pepper flakes and those weren't noticeable to me.  I think the red pepper could be doubled or tripled without problem.

An excellent recipe!

These turned out so yummy!  I read it was best to use smoked meats for collards, so I used 4 slices of a thick-cut, smoked bacon.  I also used 1 bunch of collards (not sure if it was a pound).  Honestly, these were the best collards I have ever had!  I was skeptical being that the recipe didn't call for sugar or vinegar...which I've heard are "secret ingredients" when it comes to collards, and they are so not necessary!  They were so delicious,  I made them the following night as well.  I will use this recipe often :)

I have made this multiple times.  I have no point of reference for what greens are supposed to taste like, but there was a very pleasurable look on my North Carolina boyfriend's face that said these lived up to anything he has ever had before. I do like to double the bacon from the original recipe, but it is not necessary.

Great recipe! Made it twice in 2 weeks. I did double the bacon to 6 slices and added a splash of cider vinegar and about a tablespoon and a half of brown sugar. Started on the stove first time and transferred to slow cooker for about 5 hours on high. Second time, did the same thing but forgot to plug cooker in, so I simmered on the stove top for about 2 1/2 hours. Both times they were wonderful.

My go-to recipe. Brother in law said "this is the way greens are made" after I served them. I occasionally tweak the recipe but not much. It's a winner.

I love the texture of collards that have been simmered a long time.  45 minutes was just right, they were tender but not mushy.  I added a splash of apple cider vinegar.

My husband grew up eating black eyed peas and collard greens for New Years.  We eat the greens all the time since we found this recipe.  When we visited his mom recently, she made some greens.  He whispered to me, "You need to tell her about that recipe you found."  Haha!  This recipe is perfection for us!

This recipe turns out the most delicious collard greens I have ever eaten. If you don't make them correctly, they are bitter to the point where you don't want to eat them. I've tried other recipes, but this one works perfectly. The generous amount of black pepper and pinch of red pepper gives this dish a bit of liveliness. I made one change: I put in half the salt because I felt the bacon added enough salt that a teaspoon seemed like too much. My husband, who usually notices when there is not enough salt, made no comment, so I consider half a teaspoon sufficient.

As this is the first time I have ever made collards from the garden, it was great for a beginner!! I didn't use the red pepper flakes at all and I used onion powder since I forgot to buy the onion. I used bacon bits as the bacon that I had was bad so even with the substitutions it still turned out great!! My husband and daughter both enjoyed them.

We loved it!  I just did one extra thing and sprinkled some brown sugar in after pouring in the chicken broth.  We live in Canada and were thrilled to find the collard greens but had no idea how old they were, so after reading other reviews sprinkled the brown sugar.

I come from a Southern family- but I was raised in Colorado. In the past I wasn't a really big fan of collard greens but these were out of this world good! I made them last night 5/11/2015, I omitted the olive oil and just used the bacon greased...Simply fantastic, so good I kept getting one more serving. Thank you for the recipe.

Great simple recipe. I didn't have bacon and my husband is vegan anyway so we (me and 7yo daughter) used liquid smoke to give the meaty flavor. THE BOMB! We ate the entire pot that was meant for left overs in ONE NIGHT!!!

YUM. Second time making this. The only thing I did differently was no additional oil-used bacon drippings-and doubled bacon 'cuz I only had 6 strips bacon handy. I would have used more bacon if available.

Amazing best collard greens ever spicy and sweet! This must be cooked for atleast 3 hours like some of the other reviewers suggested. Also dont remove the bacon from the pot use that grease for the greens it makes it so much more tender.

Easy recipe! The collard greens came out delicious. I am a vegetarian so I skipped the bacon and added extra red pepper flakes. I also added a teaspoon of brown sugar. I will make this recipe again and again!

I used the bag of collards greens that have the greens pretty cut. My husband doesn't care because they taste sooo good. I used a little more bacon but other than that I followed the instructions.  Oh  the second time I added a little a little brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer. This is my third time making these greens =)

Excellent! I made this for New Year's Day and it was easy and came out so well. The only changes; I used a smoked pork jowl instead of bacon and omitted adding salt because of that. It also simmered for a few hours. I had bought the jowl prior to finding this recipe. I will use bacon next time for sure.

I doubled this recipe using a lb. of turnip greens and a lb. collard greens.  It was wonderful. Guests said they were the best they had ever had.

This is my  first time cooking collard greens or any green for that matter.  I researched this recipe on a whim while at the market trying to plan a NYE dinner.  OMG!!! This recipe is kick a$$.  I loved it, my husband loved it, as well as my guests.  Never could I imagine that cooking collard greens would be this simple, easy, and quick.  Growing up, cooking greens seemed to be an all day event.  Thank you very much for sharing.

Amazing!! I used twice the amount of bacon though just is I could use up the bacon. This is simple to make and delicious. I'm so happy no one else in the house likes collard greens. I get to have them all to myself.

This is an awesome recipe to play around with!  I personally use the whole package of bacon and it's a definite on adding the brown sugar and vinegar.   I also cut  up mushrooms in tiny pieces for flavor savors and add stick of butter and two cans of well rinsed great northern beans.  People can't get enough!

Great recipe! Based on others' reviews, I added the apple cider vinegar but not the brown sugar, used the bacon fat to fry the onions and garlic. I also used some applewood smoked sea salt and that was a nice addition of flavor. I simmered for a couple hours on the stove and added the bacon itself later in the cooking. Delicious!!

These Collards have got soul, true southern tasting, soul food! This to me is by far the best collard recipe that I have ever tried. Even cooking them, the aroma was wonderful, and didn't stink the house up, the way collards & turnips often do. These were not bitter at all, just perfect!

Fantastic!
I made it as noted.
Tried, liked it, but thought, eh,
a little Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ couldn't hurt.
It didn't, at all.
Added a tbsp to the pan, cooked a lil longer
and voila` EXCELLENT.
I'll be making this again and again and again.
Thanks so much, Ken!!

Great recipe!! I took these to work and was told they were "SLAMMIN'!"
I added about 1 tbsp of brown sugar, 1-2 tbsps of apple cider vinegar, and instead of bacon I use 2 smoked turkey legs.

Follow this recipe just about spot on. We do make it a bit spicier and cook the stock with a ham hock that I mince and put back in at the end. But, its basically how I have always cooked and enjoyed collards.

I tried collard greens in a restaurant in St. Augustine Florida.  They were great and I wanted to try to make them.  This recipe was really great.  I followed it as stated and we loved them.  Now making them for my Canadian family, who by the way loved them as well.
Thank you

I absolutely love this dish.  I first tasted this in Juniors Restaurant in Bklyn and went home and searched for a way to make it.  Based on the reviews, I tried it out and was not disappointed.  I did not have chicken broth so I substituted for bouillon, only one, since the bacon has enough salt added to the mixture.   I must admit I have not tried other recipes so I can't be sure it's the best but it's the only one I have used and plan to use and I have made it at least 4 times already.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions by skipping the oil, increasing the bacon, and simmering for a lot longer.  The greens definitely got better the longer they cooked.  Unfortunately, I didn't have brown sugar to combat the bitterness of the greens.  I don't think I would bother making it again though.

I have made hundreds of collard greens.  This one I couldn't get enough of.  All my family are native Florida's and that pot was all gone.  Might have to double recipe next time.  Easy to make and just might be the best greens I have ever had.

Yummy! We loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except for just a pinch less red pepper and added a tbsp of brown sugar. The longer it simmers the better! I served with ham and mashed potatoes. It was a hit!

Fabulous!  Everyone loved it!  This was the first time I've cooked fresh collards, but it tasted like I've been cooking them for years!  I used 5 slices of thick peppercorn bacon.  So very flavorful!

I love collard greens but never knew how to make them. I used this recipe for my first attempt and they came out so good. The only change I made was adding a little vingear besides that I made the recipe as is. Will definitely use this recipe again. Will probably experiment with different meats. Thank you for sharing.

This was the BEST!  I have four kids and a husband who won't hardly eat anything green.  They all took one bite and said it was delicious.  My husband asked for seconds.  I omitted the pepper flakes because it would too spicy for my kids. And I didn't have bacon so I used salt pork, which is close to the same thing.  Other than those two things I followed the recipe and it was great!

I made this recipe (well, with some modification) for New Year's day and it got rave reviews!  And this from southerners who don't usually like greens very much. How I changed it: I omitted the onion and used canola oil instead of olive.  I remember my father saying that my grandmother said you should cook greens in only the water that clings to their leaves.  I didn't have the guts to try that, so I used some vegetable broth I had left over and I used only enough to barely cover the greens and cooked it over low heat so as not to burn it. It was a little "dark" tasting so I added a spoonful of sugar (for 3 bunches of greens) and the juice from half a lemon and cooked it about 15 minutes more.  Very happy with the result.  Thanks!

I have never cooked collard greens before, but because this recipe got such good reviews AND I wanted to make a traditional New Years Day menu, I decided to give this dish a shot AND AM SO GLAD I DID!  My Southern boyfriend and his family literally said this was the best greens dish they'd had in years and couldn't believe the recipe was so simple.  Just fabulous!  I used salt pork instead of bacon, withheld the olive oil, and drained about half the grease before adding in the onions and garlic.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.

I did make a few changes I did not use the olive oil.    I cooked 4 pieces of bacon instead of 3.  I followed the rest of the recipe as it was written  and I thought the collards turned out great.     Even my 15 year old daughter liked them.

Excellent recipe!  I upped the garlic and used Kale and something that looked like Bok Choy (CSA mystery greens), cooked for about 20 min, and it was delicious.  Probably the tastiest I've ever had Kale.

I'm from the north and had never made collards before. I took this to a Southern family get-together and they were raved about. I think this had too much salt and pepper and not enough bacon. I used half a pound of bacon or about 8 slices. I would recommend using 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper or season to taste. I also followed the advice of other reviews and added a spoonful of brown sugar and some vinegar. Not sure the brown sugar did much but I recommend the vinegar.

I must admit, it turned out better than I expected.  My man is a vegetarian, therefore I did not use any meat for flavoring.  The only adjustment I used from a different greens recipe was liquid smoke.  My man is a VERY critical & picker eater and I noticed he made two helpings!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and even my 6 year old loved them. The red pepper flakes really give a kick, but adding apple cider vinegar balances the taste out. These were amazing !!!!

Awesome recipe. Simple and easy to make yet tastes like it was labored over. I used powdered chicken broth, it was bit salty. Next time I will repeat recipe without the 1 teaspoon salt.

I think this recipe would have been better had I drained the fat from the pan after cooking the bacon.

yum! My boyfriend said that they were so good he would eat them once a week! I made them with turkey bacon to slim them down. I am sure they are better with real bacon (sigh) but still really really good!.

My husband is from the South and I never had collards before meeting him. He made collards and I would "eat them"..or would I say choke them down. Even tried them at local bbq resturants to appease him. Eww! But since this recipe I LOVE THEM!! This recipe rocks! Even better if you get your greens from your local CSA!

Made this dish and the wife loved it! If you combine it with any kind of baked meat such as meatloaf, seasoned baked chicken, or a roasted beef with flavored mashed potatoes will make a very tasty meal. Use your imagination and it will combine very well.

Excellent recipe!  Even though I used only 1 TBSP of bacon bits (real), 1.5 cups of broth.  I used 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.  It was KICKIN delicious!  Even the broth that was leftover after we finished the greens tasted great the next day, heated up as a soup!  I tried this recipe 3 weeks ago and am making it again tonight.

Yummy! But hold up to all those that want to nix the olive oil.  You almost had me convinced but not for long.  It's really just a smidgen in the grand scheme of things and I noticed right away that not using it makes the bacon more difficult to work with.  I chopped a whole pound of bacon before cooking it up (I'm making a lot of this) and adding the olive oil helped separate it and cook up evenly.  So the olive oil lends more to the method of making this scrumptiousness more than anything else. This is a great recipe as is!!

this is the kind of recipe that can turn a greens hater into a greens lover - of course, that could also be the magic of bacon so use more.

These are absolutely delicious. I used to boil my greens in plain water and were not flavorful at all. I used turkey bacon because I do not eat pork and doubled the amount. I will always make my greens this way from now on. Yummy!

Prep time is more.  Cleaning and peeling collards takes a while.  However, I received this recipe from a friend who sells produce and it is pretty awesome. The only thing I do different is, after the bacon fries and is removed, I add spare ribs and cook them for 45 minutes, remove debris, and then continue.  Soooo gooood!

I have used this recipe to make these collards and everytime I make them they are devoured. I used to add more than the suggested amount of bacon-which is the shazaam of the recipe. I've used pork bacon as well as turkey bacon; which are both good. The pork bacon version gets eaten up faster though. Nowadays, I leave the meat out completely and they are still delicious.  I also use vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Yummy!

My mother and grandfather would cook collard greens often when I was growing up, but I never wanted to try them.  I don't know my mother's recipe, but this recipe is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and when the greens finished simmering, the aroma took me back to my childhood at home and when visiting my grandfather's house.  I know greens are sooo good for you, and since this recipe is delicious, it's definitely one fore the recipe box!  Thank you for posting it.

Excellent recipe.  It does not disappoint!  But after having made it a few times, I tweaked it to my liking:  substitute broth with veggie stock, & use ham hocks.

this was my first time cooking Collard Greens and they were super tasty. I am about to cook them for dinner tonight and this time I am going to cook them on low heat for 3 hours which I think will make the dish even better!

I really liked them and I'm not a greens person.  This is the first time I've made them.  I don't know that I would make them again-no one in my family eats veggies at all, although my daughter did try them.  If I had some random collard greens laying around I would for sure make this again!

YUM!  The whole family enjoyed these kickin' greens!  Recipe turned out perfectly as written.  If your greens seem dry, just add a bit more broth or water to the pot.

At 55 I have never made greens in my life, but wanted to make some for my familys after church sunday dinner, sand I used this recipe.These were the best greens my family said they have ever had. I did make some changes by adding 1/2 cup of green pepper and a 1/2 cup of red bell pepper, I also used about 1 pound of bacon and used the bacon grease and omitted the bacon but added 2 smoked turky tails.I will be making these for all family gatherings.

Excellent dish! I replaced bacon slices with bacon pieces that come in a bag (or jar) from the store and the taste was still great. I've also added mushrooms to the dish with great success as well! Thank you for the super recipe! :)

This was the first time i've made collared greens but it certainly won't be the last.  My friend from Mississippi was over and she said they weren't what she had grown up with, but that they were just as delicious anyway.  Those that are particular about veges in my family weren't as fond of these, but i think for those who like collared greens, this is an excellent way to prepare them.

I had never made collards before and these were super easy and turned out delicious! I followed some of the other reviews and added more bacon and finished it off with some brown sugar and a splash of apple cider vinegar. I love the little kick you get from the red pepper flakes. I also wanted my flavors to steel together longer so instead of simmering for 45 minutes, I transferred to the crock pot for about 4 hours. They were so tender and all the flavors blended together so well. My husband, who diesnt care for collards, ate them up and said they were the best he has ever had! We ate them with black eyed peas, cornbread, and a pan fried pork chop for New Years! Thanks for this recipe!

I've never had collard greens before, nor has my family.  I made this recipe and everyone including my kids were asking for more helpings.  We ate this up so quickly that next time I will triple the recipe!!!   Slight change is I wouldn't add the salt because there was enough salt in the chicken broth.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!!!!!

These are some of the best and easiest collard greens I have ever made. I followed the recipe except for two minor adjustments: I chopped the bacon before I cooked it and didn't add the olive oil until I was ready to add the onions. Also, only used one can (14.5oz) of chicken broth.

I love this recipe!! I made it for thanksgiving and it was a very big hit!! My husband's mother, who recently passed away, usually made really good collards so I wanted to try making them myself!! And they were definately kickin'!!! I used a little bit of everyone's advice that I had read.   I changed the servings to 10 and used a whole 12 oz package of bacon... instead of the olive oil I used 1 1/2 T bacon grease, just a tiny bit of salt and also seasoning salt... then added about a T of brown sugar, 2 capfuls of vinegar and 2-3 shakes of texas pete hot sauce.  I still used everything else the same and also simmered them for about an hour and a half.  They came out wonderful! They had a very nice kick to them as well! I've already gotten requests to make them for my husband's Christmas party for his job!!! And I can't wait to make them/eat them again!

FINALLY cooked a pot of collards that came close to my moms----it would have made her proud!  I used a small slice of ham steak rather than bacon.  Otherwise, followed recipe pretty closely. Loved the recipe----thanks!

Double the bacon, added brown sugar (1T), a little bit of apple cider vinegar and a fair amount of red pepper flakes.  I didn't expect to like these but yum!

These are great! Taste just like the ones I used to eat when I lived in Kentucky.  Made a couple of slight changes based on other reviews and personal preference: doubled the bacon but drained off all but maybe 2 Tbsp of the grease before adding the onion.  Doubled the garlic and added a bit of honey and a splash of vinegar.

Added a little extra bacon and a tablespoon of brown sugar to it. Very very good. This may very well become a regular veggie dish on our menu.

I made this Sunday night  and it turned out great- the change I made was using the bacon grease in place of the olive oil and used mustard greens since there were no collards in stock.  My grocery store sells smoked turkey drumsticks which I shredded and added to the greens.  Excellent reviews from family.  Oh - I also cooked and simmered the greens in a rice cooker as someone else had suggested.

I've been craving greens and this hit the spot. I usually make greens similar to this but followed the recipe pretty close. I didn't bother cooking the bacon separately. I just cooked the onion in with the bacon. I had roasted/grilled a few heads of garlic earlier in the day and used 3-4 cloves of that. I couldn't find my low-sodium chicken broth so had to use the regular stuff which made it plenty salty enough along with the bacon. I will have to try my kale from the garden prepared this way. I really liked the "kiss" of spice from the red pepper flakes. Thanks Ken for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I did three things differently -- I put 1 Tbsp. Hormel real bacon bits in with the onion and garlic instead of using bacon strips.  Cut down tremendously on the fat, and still tasted great!  I used frozen collard greens instead of fresh.  Also, forgot to put the red pepper flakes in, but the amount of black pepper made it nice and spicy!  We didn't miss it, but I'll try it next time!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This has become a standard, go-to recipe when we want to impress guests. It has enough spice to make it "Kickin'" but not so much that it overpowers. We make it as written and love it!  It is quite easy to make and can sit a while after it is done if you have other dishes cooking. You can even buy pre-cut/pre-washed collards to save a bit of time/work.  It is especially good as leftovers! This is our new Thanksgiving traditions. It's that good.

Excellent collards!  Made as directed, but added a splash of apple cider vinegar, poured out half the bacon grease, and halved the pepper.  Tasted even better the next day.

I'm just learning to love collard greens for health reasons.  This recipe was easy to love. Second time around I added a tablespoon of mild sweet chili sauce; that was a nice twist, too.

These are excellent.  My husband and I do not usually eat collards, but it is a tradition in both of our families.  The in-laws were visiting for New Year's, so I tried out this recipe.  EVERYONE loved it.  I will use this recipe every year.  My mother-in-law said these were better than her mama's collards!

I cannot say enough about this recipe. My boyfriend is hard-pressed to eat vegetables so when he said he liked collard greens I looked up this recipe. It was a smash hit. I said I was glad he liked it and he replied, "Really? It's cooked in bacon. You can't go wrong with bacon." I wanted mine to be a little healthier so I cooked a separate pan using just olive oil instead of bacon grease. Mine turned out excellent as well.

I loved this dish... First time I ever cooked greens. I did change a couple things... I had some ham that needed to be used so instead of bacon i added cubed ham and I also added a can of diced tomatoes... will make again and I plan on trying it with bacon next time.

These collards are delicious! Do only use a pinch of red pepper flakes, I used two pinches and it was almost too spicy.

This was excellent! The only ingredient change I made because I didn't have onion on hand was I added onion powder instead. (my kids don't like onions anyway!) And, I let the greens wilt in a crockpot for 5 hours. The flavor was incredible!!!

This is such an easy, flavorful recipe. My husband is from the south, and I never made greens until I found this recipe. He was so impressed! He said it trumped his momma's! I'm always looking to do that!

Awesome!! It was my first time ever cooking greens.  I got thumbs up from everyone and my husband said they were right up there with the best greens he's ever had. I used extra bacon, but next time i might use ham or a hock or something.  This is my green recipe.  I'm done looking.

These are very good.  They are best with fresh greens.  However I have made them with frozen and they are still excellent. Thanks for sharing.  On the holidays my daughter sneaks in the pot and eats them before the meal is served.  She even dunks her cornbread in the leftover juices.  She is a hot mess.

Awesome way to use collards from my CSA share- it was the first time I've ever made them.  I made the leftovers into a potato soup w/ collards which was great, too!  Thank you!

Wow.. delish!!  Okay.. I did substitute quite a bit.  I had a can of collard greens.. didn't have the fresh so I had to improvise.  Used at least 6 slices of bacon. Sauted the onion and garlic in bac grease.  Added greens.  Didn't need broth because they were canned.  Added S&P.  These were GREAT!!

I have made collard greens many times before but have always had a problem with them being too salty. This recipe finally solved my problem. Using chicken broth I was able to omit the salt all together and the flavor turned out perfect. I also omitted the red pepper because I've used it before and didn't like it. I will definatley make my collards this way going forward. Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe! We almost licked the pot clean it was so good. I did not use the olive oil, just doubled the bacon and only used 1/2 tsp of black pepper.

These were great!  All of my seven children loved them and my 2 year old kept screaming for more.  The first time I made them, I had a bag of "mystery" greens someone had given me from a CSA.  3/4 of the way through cutting them up and adding to the pot, I figured out some of it was actually cabbage with very loose leaves. That was our favorite version and I have cooked them many times since then with just collards.

I LOVE this recipe,..I cook outside on my grill in a large cast iron skillet when it's too hot to cook inside. Use turkey bacon instead, add a little additional olive oil to compensate. Yum-

So good! I lost my memom this year she made the best greens in Texas. I made these last week and my girls said they tasted just like Memmoms. That really made my day. May change the bacon to salt pork since that is what my grandmother used.

This was fantastic! I've never made collard greens before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but my family gobbled these up. I did cook them for longer than the recipe indicated (just let them simmer until the rest of dinner was reaady) and they turned out wonderful.

I sort of incorporated another recipe for Drunken Greens into this one and had rave reviews from my neighbors and friends.  I added more bacon and 1 btl of dark beer and cut back on the chicken broth.  Used fresh mustard greens.  Only put 1 Tbl of brown sugar in and otherwise followed the recipe.  Outstanding.

Kickin' all the other greens to the curb, is what you'll be doing after trying these. I used 2 pre-washed bags, and doubled all ingredients, except used 1 lb. of bacon. My guests were taking home left overs and talking about my "kickin' pot of greens" for a long time after.

These are the best!  My father is known for his collard greens and is always asked to make them for EVERYTHING....As a result I have always been hesitant to make collards because from the great cooks we come from, his are the best.  I made these according to the recipe, only adding a couple more strips of bacon and sent some to his house.  He made a point to call me and tell me how great these were!  This is a rare occasion!  Everyone who has eaten these have commented on how different they were and how great they are.  This is my first attempt and is a keeper!

Excellent as is, but, being adventurous, on the 2nd go 'round, I made a change. Usually adding the proverbial "pinch" of sweetener to heighten flavors, this time I made very thin slices of apples and cooked those into the mix. Also added "Better Than Broth" Ham flavor instead of chicken broth.  Just wonderful!

I am from the south and have always eaten "mush greens" slathered in sausage grease and I was so excited to see this recipe! I have fixed these every thanksgiving for years and EVERYBODY loves them! I buy the pre cut greens in a bag and its easy as pie! So much better than what the " old timers" cook down here!

So good. I would give it more stars if I could. Every time someone went to get seconds I really wanted to slap their hands away and say mine! They were that good. I did use the bacon grease to wilt the greens and did not use any olive oil. Also used 8 pieces of bacon for 1 1/2 pounds of greens. Will make this again.

I used 6 pieces of bacon and set them aside to crumble on top of individual servings for a nice bit of crunchy texture. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar to offset any bitterness and a touch of apple cider vinegar to make the flavor pop. Definitely let these cook as long as you can, the longer the better. And I let guests customize the level of heat with Tabasco.
SO GOOD!!

We had never had collards before and thought this recipe was great!  We used turkey bacon to cut the fat and left out the oil in the beginning.  We also used more bacon since my husband loves the flavor.  Other than that - followed the recipe and loved it.  We're making this again this week!

Personally, I'm ALL ABOUT BACON, so I use 5-6 thick strips for 1 lb of collards. My hubbie likes it that way.  I also simmer them kind of high to get them to finish faster and that works fine as long as I wilt them well.  One time we added a bit of brown sugar and that provided a nice contrast.

This was my first experience cooking collards, and they were great!  I'll be making these again, as they all disappeared.  Next time I think I'll try the slow cooker to make it even easier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never cooked greens in chicken broth before - WONDERFUL.  It adds great flavor.  Instead of pepper flakes I added our favorite brand of hot sauce.  I also used a mixture of fresh mustard greens, collard greens and turnip greens.  Excellent flavor.  Many thanks for this recipe!!

We were given a whole turkey for thanksgiving and had no idea what to do with it. My husband loves greens, so I decided to mix it up. Instead of bacon I boiled the leg of the turkey till the meat fell off the bone. I used ready to use chicken broth (bought accidentally)so I didn't have to add salt, and I didn't skimp on the pepper flakes. My husband moaned through the entire meal.

All I can say is that I have never made collard greens but this recipe is "da bomb!"  I made it exactly as it is written. The red pepper flakes give it that extra "oomph!"  I love it!

I've never had collards but found the pre-washed bag at the store so I decided to find a recipe. WIth nothing to compare to, I would say it was pretty good.Lots of flavor. I would recommend adding a little brown sugar to cut the bitterness. And simmer at least an hour for more tender greens. I would make again.

I really dislike the taste of Collard Greens.  But since I am dieting I decided to try them again.  Yuk!  So I found this recipe, I took what was left and added bacon bits, minced onion, chicken bullion, the red pepper and added just a bit of brown sugar. I then microwaved the "canned" greens.  WOW!  What a difference!  I can only immagine what they would taste like with all the correct "fresh" ingredients.  
I can't wait to give it a try.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this the other day and it was excellent! As some of the others have done I added brown sugar, turkey hams, and 1/4 cup whiskey (cooked this in the bacon and onion on stove top). After this I let it sit on the crock pot for 6 hours and it was so good.

Great recipe!  I've never made collards before and it was so easy with this recipe.  I found prepackaged collard greens ready to cook at our local grocery store (Food Lion) which made this dish even easier to fix.  Added 1 tablespoon brown sugar and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Love dipping cornbread in the sauce!******Update 1/24/2012****** I make this dish often.  Organic fresh collards are the best.  I add at least 1 tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar with the mother (it tastes totally different than the regular cheap brand of apple cider vinegar) and a tablespoon or so of brown sugar.  I always forget to add the red pepper flakes but never miss it.  Made this dish for my mom for Thanksgiving and she loved it.  She swore up and down that cooking collards would stink up my house but these do not.  No smell at all besides the onion, garlic, and bacon cooking.

These were great for my first time making greens, but I found they would have needed to simmer much longer than 45 mins. to become tender. They were still pretty chewy. Easily, fixed, though, so still 4 stars!

Wonderful.  I receive rave reviews every time I make this.  It is extremely user friendly, as I always add a "pinch of this" or a "pinch more of that."  Can't rave enough about this---my father, growing up on southern food being from WAAY southern Alabama and growing up on his mothers serious home cooking, had nothing but wonderful things to say about this.  Thanks ken. This is the type of recipe I remember by heart and use as an old standbye.  I have turned many a collard green hater into lovers simply by using this recipe.

I used 1 cup mushroom broth, 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, and a few splashes of red wine vinegar. I cooked them on low just over 35 minutes and enjoyed them quite a bit.

I've never had collards.This was ok, but seems like a long cooking time when you could get similar taste from spinach. Probably wont make again.

I had never made "greens" before. OMgosh. So good. Everyone, including my Long Island Yankee hubby, raved. I did the New Year's Day Southern feast for my (extended) family this Jan 1, and got all my recipes from ALLRECIPES. Go 5 stars and you can't go wrong!

My first time making collard greens they were wonderful!  I used 4 slices of thick, good-quality bacon and the flavor was outstanding.  I will definitely be making these again.

I'm a diabetic,  Our Dr. say we have to go on a low calorie diet. I'm a lover of collard greens, my husband is not. He'll only eat alittle bit of them. I'm use to cooking them with ham hock, or smoked necked bones. I new I had to find a new Healthy way of fixing them.  Then I tried these. Wow My husban loved them and so do I. I just remove some of the bacon fat.Thank you. this recipe pleases both of us.

These collards are delicious the second day.  I recommend making them a day in advance so the flavors have a chance to soak through.

My husband is from Georgia and collard greens are a holiday dinner MUST for him. The canned greens I've served him for a couple years made him an unhappy camper, so I gave this a try over the holidays... And it was awesome! I understand why the liquid is prized, I could drink that stuff up! I added a couple extra slices of bacon (we love our pork), maybe 2 tsp brown sugar, and I omitted the red pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for our daughter. Oh, and I picked up two bunches of fresh collard greens at Wal-Mart for 97 cents each, so it was more like 1½ pounds total... But it was excellent. The canned greens taste NOTHING like what real collard greens do! I'll definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing, Ken!

These greens were awesome!  Like most people, I did alter the recipe a bit but not much!  I think it is safe to say I used more bacon then was called for - probably more like 6 slices of bacon.  I was a little stumped with how many greens to use.  Our store sold them in huge bunches which ended up being more like 3 pounds vs the 1 pound called for.  Also, I know that you can buy greens pre-washed and pre-chopped which would be a huge time saver, but I couldn't find those in our store and it worked fine.  Leave yourself some extra prep time if you have to clean and chop your greens.  I don't recall using more chicken broth but probably had extra on hand and might have added a little more then the recipe called for.  Basically followed the recipe from that point on and the greens turned out excellent.  We served around 8-10 people and there was only a few greens left!  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone wanting to taste some great greens.

i think this is a great recipe although i fudged it a little bit by burning the bacon (i used turkey bacon).  still had good flavor, though i think it would have been fantastic without the burned element!  i also added hot sauce to taste and a splash of vinegar to cut the bitterness.

Without a doubt 5 Stars!!!!!  The only changes that I made was double the bacon.  Also, I made this once using fresh collard and once using frozen.  When I used the fresh collards they turn out perfect.  When I used the bagged frozen collards it did turn out a little salty, they were still good though.   In the future I will only use fresh collards and double the bacon.

This was my first time cooking greens because I don't eat them, but when I sampled at the end to see if they were tender enough, they were, and the taste actually wasn't gross to me, which must mean they're delicious.  The family loved them at the Thanksgiving table!  (Being a real Southerner, I doubled the bacon per other reviews.)

This recipe is REALLY good. I liked how much liquid it used. They turned out really tender. I didn't use bacon, but put extra olive oil and salt before adding onions. I did add a splash of vinegar at the end. I followed everything else to the 'T' and they turned out great. The only thing I would do next time would be to follow one reviewer's advice and add 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to make them a little less bitter. Otherwise, really really good and easy!!

Enjoyed these for a change from the normal vegetables we eat.  I would make 2 changes next time:  1) omit the salt - they were WAY too salty by the time I added salt and bacon and broth and 2) add  maybe 2 cups of broth instead of 3 - they were very watery and I hated to waste all that good broth.  I also omitted the oil and just fried the bacon in its own fat.  I will make this again.

Great!  Planted collards for the first time in our garden and searched for recipes to use.  This was just great.  I love it!  Made pretty much as stated but probably used more garlic and red pepper...didn't measure..

This was an absolute wonderful recipe.
The only change I made was to add a splash of vinegar at the end of the cooking time, It really makes a differance.

I've never had collard greens before, so I had no idea what to expect. These were good! I love greens, and I had a hunch that I would like these as well. I would add less chicken stock next time, as in the end I had very soupy greens (although I have read previous reviews in which cooks dunk their cornbread). These were *slightly* bitter to me, and maybe that's just the nature of the vegetable, but I may add some brown sugar to counteract the bitterness next time.

I never thought I'd like collard greens, but my hubby asked for them for New Year's Day dinner.  This recipe is awesome!  I've always been a spinach girl, but I've switched over to collards.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the chicken broth.  I didn't want to open a second can, so I just used one (a little over 2 cups).  It still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have just started eating these greens.  They are fabulous.  I was kinda hesitant about using garlic and only 3 pieces of bacon(from Va. and we use smoked ham hocks). I followed the recipe(this first time) to a tee except, I did use bacon grease instead of oil to fry the bacon.  I didn't know I could cook greens.  Boy! this recipe hits the spot. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  I'd wanted to try a different collard recipe, and I was glad I picked this one.  My husband almost ate the whole pot full, and said they were the best collards he'd ever had.  Being Southern, I'm picky about my greens, and I was extremely pleased with the outcome of this recipe.

Perfect!  However, I didn't have any garlic cloves, so I used 1 1/2 TBSP of garlic powder.  They still turned out great.

I made these this weekend and had rave reviews on them.  A lady said that they tasted like her mom's greens.  To me that made me feel better about what I did.  I actually added more red pepper flakes than called for because you know how people down in the south like spicy cooking.  Even though I am from the North I cook like I am from the South.  Thank you for this recipe.  Will make then again!!

I've enoyed collards  but didn't know how to cook them.  This recipe was dead simple and turned out great.  I left out the salt as the bacon would be plenty salty.   I forgot to add the pepper flakes, but there was plenty of  flavor from bacon and Vidalias.  Used just half the chicken broth and didn't miss it at all.

Scrumptious recipe!!I had never made greens before, but have tasted them out of a can.(Mixed greens) I wasn't sure how much to buy, so I bought two bunches of greens, mustard and collards. I did as suggested and chopped the bacon before frying, it was so quick and neat. I used less broth as well as suggested. I'LL NEVER GO BACK TO CANNED! My kids ate this heartily, we nearly finished the whole pot between the five of us!

Very good recipe.  I used a pressure cooker and cooked them in 7 min.  I have made them with and without bacon (when I did not have any).  Definitely better with the bacon but still good without it

Whoa!  We all LOVED these greens.  In fact, I have found a dish that will be gracing our Thanksgiving table from now on.  My southern-gentleman husband couldn't wait for these to be done; he kept commenting on how good they smelled.  We've been married almost two decades, but I didn't realize before tonight that he likes greens so much, "done right", of course.  According to my guy, these were done right!

The title says it all!  These collard's are kickin'!  The only change we made was to chop & add 3 or 4 of our homegrown tabasco peppers when we added the garlic.  They were so good that my honey was drinking the juice out of the pan after all the greens were gone!  Thanks so much for a quick and easy way to make GREAT collards!

Best greens this Kentucky dweller has ever tasted. I made mine with frozen, chopped, turnip greens cooked with less broth, a bit of white vinegar, and lots of extra pepper flakes. Can't wait to try it with fresh greens. Cook with Vidalia Onion, if possible!

This is a 5 star recipe! It was inexpensive and easy to make and also EXTREMELY DELICIOUS! This recipe was the truest form I could find to the collard greens you can find in the best of kitchens of the South!
