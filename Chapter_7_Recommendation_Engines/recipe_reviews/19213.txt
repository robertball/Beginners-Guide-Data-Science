Okay, here's what I did to combat the "flat" problem:  used 3/4Cup of both sugars instead of a full cup, used 1 egg plus one yolk, increased vanilla to 2 teaspoons (just cause I like them flavorful) increased temp to 375 for 8-9 mins. and wha lah!  PERFECTION!  DELICIOUS cookies will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this cookie recipe for 35 years with the only difference being we use a whole bag 12oz. of semisweet chocolate chips.  My mom made them for 20 years before me.  They are the best chocolate chip cookies you will find.  Why people change the recipe is beyond me!  They are not even the same cookie if you change them...so why?  Anyway, they are delicious and I don't know one person who does not love them in all my years of baking them.

Loved the cookies, and so did the rest of the family. Followed suggestions (sort by "most helpful") and baked at 375 F for 8-9 minutes, used 2 tsp. vanilla, decreased sugar to 3/4 c. EACH, used 1.5 sticks of Nucoa margarine (same thing as 3/4 c.) Shaped fairly large, oversized, round balls of dough, and used Ghiradelli and Tropical Souce brand chocolate chips. In place of the two eggs, I used a total of 1/4 c. water. (1 egg = 2 Tbs. water) If mixture is still a bit dry, add just enough water for it to come together. This way, even those with dairy/egg allergies can have some! Baked on parchment paper, and also added small dashes of ginger and cinnamon to half the batch. Have already made two batches since discovering them a month ago. My mum makes the exact same recipe--but with eggs, and people don't know the difference. :o)

Super Yummy!  I made a few adjustments.  I used 3/4c. each of the sugars, 2tsp. vanilla, added in 1c. of raisins, 1tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2c. chopped pecans.  I baked them at 375 for 9 minutes on an air-bake cookie sheet.  The cookies are soft and chewy not flat at all. I ended up with 4 dozen not 5 dozen. My two boys ages 2yrs. and 4yrs. love to help make and eat these cookies!  I think I figured the WW points to be 3pts. per cookie.  I'm definately keeping this recipe!!

Wonderful cookies.  Best cookies I have ever made.  They are so soft and chewy.  I used 3/4c of both sugars and 3/4c butter, and since I am a chocolate addict, I used 2c of chocolate chips.  I don't have a nice cookie sheet.  I think it is older than me, and these treats turned out perfect.  I used a little more dough than a teaspoon full and I baked them for 10 minutes.  Thank you for this great recipe.  I will for sure make this treat in the near future.

Fantastic!  I used only 1.5 sticks of butter and 3/4 c sugar and it worked out great!  Chewy in the middle and crisp on the edges! Yummy!

Want to know the trick to these fantastic cookies?? FOLLOW THE RECIPE!! 
Drives me UP THE FLIPPIN WALL when people rate/review and change the whole  thing! UGH.. These cookies were fantastic! I am using them for the teachers as an end of the year gift with the 'I'm a smart cookie' quote :) 
Seriously, follow this recipe, exactly and it's fine. It's supposed to be a flat, chewy, delicious cookie! If you want a cakey blob, then this is not the cookie for you. 
These are a keeper, thanks so much for sharing! Oh, and I just love how many cookies it makes. Although there aren't many left now!

These cookies are very good but I did make a few changes to the basic recipe. I cut the sugars down to 3/4 cup of each (brown and white). I also added 1 more cup of chocolate chips to make a total of 2 cups. I needed to bake them for 12 minutes to get them golden brown. I always use a timer when baking cookies.

this could be my favourite cookie recipe yet! where has it been all my life? reading about the flat issue, instead of making "ball" shapes, i made taller columns of dough and this worked perfectly. the key is in the baking time as well. wait till the edges go golden and although they might look undercooked in the middle, once they cool they arent. they are perfectly soft, chewy and deliciously amazing! I used 1 package milk chocolate chips and 1 package of butterscotch chips. next time i will try a chocolate/raisin combo -my favourite!

These cookies were fabulous. I always have difficulty with flat cookies so I used 1 egg and 1 yolk. I also increased flour to 2 and a half cups and decreased the oats to 1 and a half cups. Before baking I refrigerated for an hour and they turned out just the right combination of soft and chewy. Wonderful!

My husband loves these cookies. I made a few changes. I chop the oatmeal in the blender before mixing it in. My hubby likes a smooth cookie. Also , I don't add nuts. My daughter has an allergy. And finally , I freeze the dough before cooking. This makes the cookies ooey gooey in the middle and crisp on the outside.

Flat vs. Fluffy! I learned the real problem with flat cookies last year while watching a cooking show. Real butter causes the cookies to spread out and flatten. I used to combat this by adding an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup of flour to all my cookie recipes. Now I just use butter-flavor shortening and they are perfect every time. These have always been my favorite cookies, with any kind of chips. Yum!

These cookies are great! Exactly what I was looking for: right in between a typical chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal chip cookie. I followed the reviewers suggestions and the cookies came out thick and chewy and stayed that way for days (they were gone after that). Here is what I did: I reduced the butter and both sugars to 3/4 cup each. Make sure you cream them well! Also be sure to whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together before adding to the rest of the ingredients.  I used 2 cups of chocolate (I'm a chocoholic). Once the ingredients were combined, I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour. I used parchment paper instead of butter on the pan, and the bottoms hardly even browned (and I often burn the bottom of my cookies!).  Oven temp of 375 was perfect and I left them in for 9 min. Result: chewy gooey goodness!

These were awesome! To avoid "flat" cookies, I used 3/4 cup white and brown sugar as others had suggested and I baked on parchment paper. I also increased the cookie size to a little more than a tablespoonfull and baked them for 10 - 11 minutes. Delicious!!

Made as written, with only two minor changes. I subbed margarine for half the butter, as I knew this would help with the flattening of which many have complained. Also, part margarine will contribute a chewier texture, and this is exactly what I got. The second change was to double the chocolate chips, ensuring abundant distribution throughout. Superb recipe for a hearty, satisfying cookie. Rolled oats, as opposed to quick oats, ensure a nice, chewy texture, as well. With a couple of these in one hand, an ice cold glass of milk in the other, life is absolutely wonderful!

PHENOMINAL!! To ensure perfect cookies with correct plumpness use 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening also ensure the butter is room temp soft. I also doubled the vanilla and used 1.5 times the chocolate chips. Also used quick oats they were just as good as rolled. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup for each sugar amount. Baked for 10 min exactly these were perfect soft ratio. BF said these were the best oatmeal chip cookies and he is a critic! Thanks for a superb recipe I will always use this one.

These are my husbands favorite cookies. I use 3/4 cup of each sugar and 1/2 Cup butter 1/2 Cup shortening + 1Tblsp water. & 2tsp of vanilla. I added coconut and used 2 kinds of chocolate, milk and semi-sweet and chopped pecans. I  set my oven to 375 although I suspect it is a bit cooler than that, more like 365 so I had to cook them for 15 minutes. I used a small scoop that is approximately a full Tblsp. The cookies came out perfectly. Not flat at all. I had lost my recipe for these so was very happy to find this one. Thanks for posting it!

I followed other reviewers' suggestion of reducing sugar; used a mixture of dark and milk chocolate chips, and added some chopped walnuts. Fantastic! **Update: I've made these again with choc chips and pecans. Some of the best cookies EVER**

I didn't have any chocolate chips so i added a bit of cocoa to the dry ingredients and then added white chocolate chips at the end. Turned out fabulous. My daughter couldn't wait to dip them in a glass of milk and i have to admit...I joined her!  Moist and delicious.

These were good but I would recommend the Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies instead.

This was my favorite recipe when growing up and still is.  My mom's recipe called for Crisco instead of butter, a whole package of chocolate chips and only 1/2 tsp. of baking powder.  I also add 1 cup of chopped nuts.  Make a double batch as they will go fast - but unless you have an industrial size mixer you'll need to make two separate batches.

This recipe also makes a FANTASTIC COOKIE BAR! I have no cookie sheet and was craving an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.  I put the whole recipe into a greased 13 by 9 inch pan and they came out GREAT! I also was out of vanilla and low on sugar so I put in a  quarter cup less sugar. I had no brown sugar, so I substituted white and added a teaspoon of mollassas to it. They still came out DELISH!! Next time, I'm gonna follow the whole recipe and use nuts as well! THANKS FOR SHARING THE GREAT RECIPE!!

If you are having a problem with the cookies flattening too much it is because there is not enough flour or oatmeal. After reading the reviews I added an additional 1/4 cup flour and about 3/4 cup oatmeal. I had no problems with the cookies being too flat.
I also made half of the recipe with raisins instead of chocolate chips - just added about 1 tsp of cinnamon in the batter.

These were awesome, the only thing I would have changed would have been to decrease the amount of oats.  There were a ton left on the bottom of the bowl that I couldnt get mixed in.

This cookie is almost perfect. I make a few changes but not because it needs it. It's just personal preference. I and about 1tbsp. Vietnamese Cinnamon and about 1/2tsp. Nutmeg. I mix together in a separate bowl, Raisins, Sunflower Seeds and Toasted Coconut. I mix these in instead of the Chocolate Chips.

I have an ancient Cowboy Cookie recipe which has been a family fave for several generations.  As it has shortening, I opted to try this recipe, many of the ingredients are on target.  I used the recommendations of many and increased the vanilla to 2 t., reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. and increased the choc chips to 2 c. (no brainer here) also cooked at 375.  A bit disappointed in the results, but will try again as I think the oatmeal I used really took over the recipe. (Coachs Oats, 100% whole grain oatmeal)  In days of old, I used the classic quick oatmeal found in most markets.  My old recipe differed this way: 1/2 c shortening, 1/2 c. oleo (margarine), 1.5 C. flour, 3 cups quick oatmeal.  All other ingredients are the same.  Just didn't get the texture and flavor that made these cookies our family fave for so long.  Also, I only was able to get 4 dozen cookies of this recipe, but I use 2 ice teaspoons and made good sized cookies.

YUM, YUM, YUMMY!  These cookies were a huge hit with my family.  My 14 yr old daughter picked the recipe and made them herself a few days ago and then made them again a few days later.  I have never seen cookies go that quick in my home...WOW.  I did add an extra half cup of chocolate chips to the ingredients but thats only because I have chocolate lovers here and were extra gooey.  This recipe will take place of my own recipe for now on.  Thanks so much for sharing it with all of us.

I should have read the other reviews before cooking these. I found the first batch flat so I added a tsp of baking powder and some shredded coconut. They tasted great, but I'd look for other recipes before using this one again.

These are the best cookies!! I make them all the time. It is my only chocolate chip cookie I use now. The only thing I change is that I found if I use half butter and half shortening, they come out just the right thicmness. I also use this recipe when I want oatmeal raisin cookies too. I use raisins in place of the chocolate chips and I add cinnamon and cloves to the batter! They are delicious and I always get rave reviews!

Nice cookies! If you follow the recipe closely, the cookies come out really chewy. I tried modifying it a little to make it "healthier". Followed one of the reviewer's recommendations to substitute the 2 eggs with 1/4 cup water and reduced the butter to 2/3 cup. Came out great as well, and not as flat. :)

Very good.
I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter, and chilled the dough before dropping on to the pan with a cookie scoop.  I pulled them out while they were set on the outside but still a little raw on the inside, so they became wonderfully chewy after they cooled.

Well, I had the problem with them spreading out too, but my husband didn't care because they tasted so good and were chewy, not crunchy or cake-like.  I added some more flour after the 1st and 2nd batches, and then they didn't spread out so much.  So, with probably 1/4 cup extra flour, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Pretty tasty!!  I used "old-fashioned oats" and the cookies turned out just fine.  They do need to be chilled before baking, otherwise they will spread out very flat.  Mine were great!!  Thanks!!

Awesome.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  They do spread a bit, and are pretty thin, but the flavor is outstanding.  Five stars definitely!

I was short on some ingredients, put a bit too much of other ones by accident & they still turned out FABULOUS!! I used a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and decreased the sugars too 3/4 cup, and butter to 1.5 sticks. I loved the delicate texture and abundace of flavor. An absolute keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly except I added some walnuts.  My husband, who never met a cookie he wouldn't taste, has rated this the BEST cookie he has ever tasted. These are at their best when fully cooled, so resist the temptation to eat them warm from the oven.

These were so tasty. I reduced the sugars to 3/4 cup of each , instead of the full cup and had no trouble with flat cookies at all. I baked for the time stated in the recipe at the temperature stated. The cookies looked underbaked to me, but I forced myself to NOT put them in for a longer time. They cooled and were chewy, delicious and completely cooked. I brought these into work and everyone loved them. I didn't add any nuts as I didn't have any, but I think those would be tasty too.. even diced up dried fruit.

This recipe was fair at best.  I agree with some of the other comments regarding the lacey consistency.  I think the original description says it well, IF you can get them to bake just right.  I tried several different times, with no luck.  After two batches, I hadn't the energy for a third.

I took SVROSS's tips for "unflattening" the cookies(reduced sugar, increased oven temp to 375 and 2 teaspoons of vanilla for flavour). I adjusted the recipe a bit after reading the reviews to lighten it just a tad because I was afraid I would eat a lot!
  I used one cup of all purpose white flour and one cup of King Arthur white whole wheat flour. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of Sunsweet Lighter Bake (prune puree). I used 2 whole eggs because studies show yolks alone without the whites increase cholesterol, but not whole eggs. I used 3/4 cup of both sugars and after all that, I added 3/4 of shredded coconut. The cookies did not come out flat, but normal cookie shaped and sooo delicious!!!

I followed the recipe, except for using only margerine and no oil... the dough was too sticky/wet so I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, 1 cup toasted coconut, and 1 cup cashews (beaten into chunks). 
I nuked my margerine and the cookies baked a little flat. Next time I will try using chilled margerine or butter. Also add a pinch of cinnamon and maybe and extra cup of oats. Or try reducing the butter/margerine by a 1/4 cup. 
I baked at 350 for 10min and cookies were golden brown on edges and still raw looking in middle. I let them cool anyways and they solidified as they cooled, producing chewy perfect cookies!! So delicious!

When I made this cookie they were so thin and hard to get off the cookie sheet even though i greased the sheet it was crazy i only managed to get 3 cookies off without breaking them. That being said they tasted wonderful but i think that adding less sugar would make them better.

I just made these cookies.  Other than adding some pecans, I followed the original recipe.  They were wonderful!

Easy and delicious, i cut out 1/2cup sugar, used 1/2 whole whole wheat flour and omitted the salt as I have made these a couple times and found them a bit salty and sweet as is but still good.

This is the yummiest cookie I've gotten on this site, I'm in loooove.

Since most other users cut the sugar, I did cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup. I also added a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa, just cause I wanted mine extra chocolatey. 

I did not have any problem with them baking flat, in fact my first batch didn't bake through, but that could be my cruddy oven. In any event, these came out as the writer said........melt-in-your-mouth. Absolutely wonderful.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it word for word and the cookies came out extremly flat and thin, breaking easily. The next time I followed the advice from other contributers and reduced the two sugars and it came out perfectly.

Excellent cookie! I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also only used 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) of butter and 3/4 cup of the sugars. I made sure my butter and the cookie dough was cold and none of the cookies turned out flat! I also used 1 cup semisweet chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips.   Be sure to not overbake these as they will be hard (7-8 minutes at 375 degrees worked for my oven). Everyone loved these cookies! I am for sure keeping this recipe!

I baked these today. I followed the recipe except I added almond extract instead of vanilla and stirred in dried cherries and almonds with the chocolate chips. They spread on me a bit but came out very delicous. I will defintely make these again.

The texture on these is amazing.  Slightly crispy on the outside, mouth watering chewy on the inside.  I replaced one cup of all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flower, plus 1/4 cup ground flaxseed meal and 1/4 cup toasted wheat germ.  I also replaced the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.  I think these are the best cookies I've ever made.

I was one of the ones that DID NOT get the right result.  I was lookng for FLAT AND SOFT and got thick and crunchy. But they were so good!  YUMMY! Part of my problem was that I didn't realize that we didn't have eggs- I subbed 2 TBLS Milk and 1 TBLS olive oil.  THESE COOKIES WERE GONE THE NEXT DAY- really good.

Followed some suggestions by other reviewers and added a little less sugar and they're beautiful. Added extra vanilla and double the chocolate chips because - well, I like chocolate! Also added pecans and these cookies are AWESOME. They will be a repeat customer in my house and will make an appearance on my Christmas cookie tray.

well, i took some suggestions of others and used only 3/4 c of both sugars, 2 tsp vanilla, 1egg + 1 yolk. I didnt have a sifter so I could sift the dry ingredients and they never spread. i thought the dough looked dry but i tried anyway. in the oven after 10 minutes i attempted to flatten them, they were in there for about 20 minutes and they are really cakey and crumbly. i'll try again though..

My family thought these cookies were good, not great.  

Interestingly, I used two different baking sheets when making the cookies so I could have one batch in the oven & one ready to go in the oven.  One bakng sheet is air insulated and one is just a flat cookie sheet.  The cookies came out nicely shapped on the regular cookie sheet but they came out flat every time on the air insulated baking sheet.

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I mix it up a bit with the chocolate chips - mix in some mint or white chocolate and without nuts and it tastes great.

I FIGURED IT OUT!!  The best cowboy cookie in the world!  Like others have said...use 3/4 cups of both white and brown sugar, then use 2 teaspoons of vanilla, add 1/2 cup of peanut butter to butter/sugar mixture, 16oz. of chocolate chips and chopped walnuts as you like (I used 1 cup).  OH MY DEAR LORD....they were FANTASTIC!!!  I have tried MANY different cowboy cookie recipes trying to find "the perfect one"...This is it.  Not flat, but not cake like either...perfectly gooey/chewy.  You've got try these!  Oh...and make sure you have like 2 gallons of milk...you're gonna need it. :)

I say YUM! I read some reviews and decided to tweak it a little-I used half butter-half shortening and I used and extra 1/2 t. baking powder (which I don't think it needed). I also decreased the sugars to 3/4 c each and used Splenda in place of the white sugar.  They were really good.  Next time I wouldn't add the additional baking powder b/c I don't think it needed it.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Note:  The baking sheet you make these on makes a difference in the way the cookie bakes:  I liked using the dark coated pans the best b/c it browned the bottom while the rest of the cookie remained nice and moist.

Man, you guys weren't kidding about these coming out flat!  They come out more like discs than cookies, fortunately it was exactly what I was looking for!  I was looking for a recipe that baked flatter, and chewy.  I couldn't have asked for anything more! Easy recipe, great flavor!  These cookies are THE BEST COOKIES EVER!  They stayed chewy and soft for weeks!

I made this last night (after it was a featured recipe) and I'm so glad I did - rave reviews all around! my only change was substituting earth balance (vegan) "butter" with regular butter. They still came out very chewy.

These turned out to be great cookies, but I made some changes.  I added almost a cup of extra oatmeal and a bit of extra flour.   I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the white flour.  I also used about 3 Tbsp less butter than called for, and I only used 3/4 cup of white and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I doubled the chocolate chips and the vanilla.  My cookies were plump and moist and flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I get request from coworkers to bring these in. The first time I made them, I thought they were a little flat. So the next time I made them, I used 2/3 cup of melted butter and 1/3 cup of milk. Fluffs up the cookies without taking anything out of the taste.

I was looking for a quick cookie to make today and I found it! It was easy to put these together because you could do everything using one measuring cup and one measuring spoon. My 2 year old loved helping me dump the ingredients into the Kitchenaid and in a short time we had really yummy, soft and chewy cookies...perfect! Too bad we have to ruin the fun and do dishes now:(

Everytime I make these I have to make a double batch because otherwise I would not get any.... just a tip don't overcook these. They actually don't look done usually when I take them out but this keeps them chewy. Love this recipe.

Awesome. I was a little nervous reading others complaints of the spreading so I started out only putting two per sheet but these didn't spread alot at all. They also didn't come out hard and tasteless like some others noted. These are just wonderful. Make sure the butter is just softened and not melted. Melted butter will make them spread.

Well Bonnie Smith a great big THANK YOU to you. These cookies are nothing less than delicious. Mine did not spread out like others. As soon as they turned golden all over I removed them from the oven. They immediately sank, so to speak, and crackled. Cooked perfectly and are chewy and a terrific flavor. My boyfriend is out in a cold snow storm on a tractor plowing our driveways, when he comes in my cookie monster will be thrilled with these. I am going to share these with my neighbors also. I will bake these cookies again, many times I am sure. Oatmeal is Garry's favorate cookie. It is so nice to have another version. They turned out exactly like Laura's photo.

GREAT Reacipe, It is simple (To me) and it is so great that I had to keep my little brothers from eating the dough (they took a sample when i was distracted). It is a good recipe and I don't think I would change the recipe to make it taste good becuase even though it was dry (Might be from accidentally putting it in the oven a bit too long). But there is one thing I would change is the amount of oats becuase when I took a bite all I can taste is oats IT IS LOADED!

Great Recipe!

This is a great recipe!!  I made them and took them to a family get together and everyone loved them!!  They went really fast.  We couldn't stop eating them.  I also cut down on the sugars and it turned out good.  I have found a new chocolate chip oatmeal recipe.

Very tasty cookies, but they were not chewy the next day.  Very dry and crunchy.  Any suggestions on how to keep them chewy longer?

These cookies were pretty good, but I was expecting a lot more from them with all the hype.  I wouldn't say that they're anything out of the ordinary.

I have been making these cookies over the past six months and they have gotten RAVE reviews! They are my own favorite and several friends have asked for the recipe. I now add several things to this recipe to make for even more flavor! Try using spelt flour if trying to get away from white flour and also, I always include ground flax seed for a nice nutty flavor. I also always use the traditional large (not quick) oats that make for more texture and a bit more "crunch"... we love these cookies in our house!

My kids beg me to make these cookies.  I searched for the perfect oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and these are the closest to perfect I've made. Try them, you won't be disappointed.  Make sure your dough is chilled so the cookies don't over-crisp in the oven.

These cookies are absolutely amazing.  They stay soft days after being made.  The trick is to flatten them with a fork, and bake them no longer than 8 minutes.  They will look undercooked, but if you bake them too long they will be hard!

Although I LOVE chocolate, this recipe is actually better without it.  Ran out of chips one day and substituted 1 cup of rough-chopped pecans.  Fabulous!!

Yummy!!!  I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening instead of all butter (seems to help with flattening??), and I 'hid' 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in the 2 cups of flour.  Otherwise, made according to recipe.  Excellent flavor and texture!!  Will make again... and again...

These cookies were delicious, however, I made a few changes. I felt two cups of sugar was a lot. So, I only added 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown. In replacement, I added 1/2 cup of Craisins (dried cranberries) and 1/2 cup of Raisins. If I were to make these in the future, I'd add 3/4 cup shredded Coconut, instead of Chocolate chips. Also, Roasted Peanuts would be delicious to add a 'crunch factor' (1/2 cup would be plenty). Hope this helps! -ShoeGal

Super good!  I increased the flour by 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cup chocolate chips instead of 1/2 cup.  Also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine.  They turned out perfect!  Crispy and Chewy at the same time.

Tasty cookies!  My husband was a little sad because he likes more chocolate in his cookies, but I thought they were good.  Mine were flat, but I liked that about them.  I like them most when they are still just a little frozen!

I also used 3/4 c each of the sugars....more than sweet enough. I also used 1 1/4 c all purpose flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour. Added 1/2 c finely chopped pecans and had a very good cookie that is a tad healthier than the original version.

These cookies taste great!  As the recipe is written, the cookies fall completely flat, though.  I usually don't have this problem but did with this recipe for some reason.  When I make these again I will try some alterations to see if I can combat that issue.  Otherwise, very yummy!

Outstanding!  Loved these cookies.  Only change I made was to add a cup of cinnamon chips in addition to the chocolate chips.  The cinnamon & chocolate were awesome together!  They turned out slightly crispy around the edges but nice and chewy in the center.  Yum!!

Fantastic recipe as is. Only alterations I made were a little less salt since I used salted butter and I used an entire 10oz bag of chocalte chunks instead of chips. I made rounded teaspoon sized (almost ball shaped) mounds which made exaclty 4 dozen typical sized cookies. They came out nice, round, and chewy. Mine took about 10 mins to cook. THANKS!!!

These cookies are so good!  I really like them a lot.  They aren't too sweet which is good for me.  I did use 3/4 cup of brown and white sugars and 1tsp. salt and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Other than that I didn't make any other changes.  These cookies rock!

Wonderful! I made a few very small modifications - I added a pinch of cinnamon and slightly more vanilla & chocolate than the recipe called for. I also rolled the dough into balls and cooked them like that, so the cookies were even and not flat at all. They came out PERFECTLY - light & crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  I love these cookies and I will definitely make them again. All the ingredients are things I nearly always have in my kitchen, and they're super easy to make.

These were some of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tried. I used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate (because I wanted to use them up)and they tasted fantastic! The only problem I had was that the cookies spread a little more than I liked, so I added another handful of oatmeal to the rest of the dough, and the were perfect! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I have spent the last 3 days searching for a great recipe - this is it!  I tried 4 others and they all came out flat - boo!  I read tons of reviews and followed the great advice.  Here's what I did:  2 1/2cups flour, 3/4 cups (both sugars), 1/4 tbsp salt, 2tbsp vanilla, 1 egg & 1 yolk, 1 1/4 cups choco chips.  Bake 10min @ 350. I did not refrigerate - this mixture gives the cookies a thick doughy texture.  Mix the chips by hand - very important.  2 cups of chips are far too many.  After 1 cup my husband said that was enough and he's a chocoholic!  I have found another staple for our home.

I made these cookies for my daughter's class and they turned out great.  I made medium size cookies and found that I had to bake a little longer, maybe 11-12 minutes or so.  I followed some of the reviews and also used 3/4 cup of each sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  The cookies had great flavor.

HELP!  I have made these cookies 2 times and both times they spread out and are way too thin.  They break into pieces and I can't get them to stay whole.  The crumbs taste good, but that doesn't really help.  I am a decent baker, but I don't know what I am doing wrong!

I made a few changes, used only 1/2 cup white sugar which is plenty! Used 1 egg & 1 egg white, which makes them chewy. Milk Chocolate chips instead of semi sweet, And added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. This = PERFECT cookies! :)

Okay, I have made these several times now. My husband keeps telling me not to, because we're all going to gain weight. I used 3/4 c. of both brown and white sugar, as well as 2 tsp. of vanilla. I also added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. The cookies were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. I think these were even better on the second day! 
 I originally gave this 4 stars because the cookies were flat, but I tried the 1 egg and 1 yolk vs. 2 eggs and it worked perfectly, except that you have to redue the bake the time to 375 degrees @ 8 minutes or they will be much crispier than you probably want. My son who has eaten LOTS of these cookies tasted the difference between the ones that were overbaked at 9-10 minutes. I get requests for this recipe every time I make it. DELICIOUS!!!

Fabulous cookies! I made them exactly as the recipe said, except I increased the oven temp to 375degrees and cooked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect!!! Not flat at all, perfectly chewy and crunchy. I will definitely make these again!

Absolutely Fabulous!  My hubby loves them.  I made a change and took the advice of others by using 3/4c. brown and white sugar.  I also cut the rolled oats by a half of a cup and added 3/4 c. coconut flakes.  We love coconut and they turned out great.  The only trouble I had was getting them baked before my hubby ate all the dough!

Finally, a chocolate chip cookie recipe that worked with my Norwegian ingredients!  Normally they are too cakey.
I follwed earlier advice and used 3/4c. each of light brown sugar and regular refined sugar.  I also used one egg and one egg yolk.  I didn't measure the butter, and I think I might have been a bit less than 1c.  I also just ran out of white flour, so I used 1 1/2 c. white flour and 1/2 c. havre (wheat) flour.
These turned out perfect, a little bit browned on the bottom, but fat and gooey on the inside!  Thanks!

AMAZING!  My family has been enjoying these cookies all month!  I made a batch, cutting down on the sugars--3/4 cup each and then I scooped them out onto a baking pan and froze them and them threw them in a ziploc.    
Now I can just take out a few at time and have fresh baked cookies any time!

Changed the recipe (less sugar, more vanilla, less salt) and it came out well, but not as fantastic as I had hoped with all the hype. Im also a chocolate chip  so I put in the whole bag..definately needed in my opinion.

while the cookies came out great, i'm only rating this four stars because i made quite a few adjustments to the recipe. first of all, i followed other reviewers' advice and only used 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugar. i also threw in an extra teaspoon of vanilla. i used 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/2 cup shortening and 3 tablespoons of water. i cut the rolled outs down to 1 cup and added a cup of shredded coconut. i baked at 375 for about 8-9 minutes and the cookies came out beautifully! the shortening kept them nice and tall and they were the perfectly soft and chewy. definitely recommend!

They tasted much better if you baked them just until they are done but not golden.  I added 1/2 c. peanut butter and they were very tasty.

I've made these many many times. They are my most requested recipe. I've landed on the addition of one cup of cranberries, 1/2 cup white chocolate, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and sometimes I add 1 cup of cornflakes (they add a nice crunch to an otherwise soft cookie.) I also found that decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cups of white and 3/4 cups brown is PLENTY sweet.

Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for.  The cookies turned out   super flat just the way I like them.  I'll be making them again.

These are chewy and wonderful! I put in half a bag of semi-sweet and half a bag of white chocolate chips and they were very yummy! Thanks for sharing!

These are great. I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 margerine so they don't spread too much. They have become my standard chocolate chip recipe. For a treat lightly toast the oats before you add them.

I've been making these cookies for a while now.  They are wonderfully and tasty.  I cut the butter, white and brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and I don't add nuts.  Enjoy!

Very, very good.  The perfect mix of crunchy 'round the edges, chewy and gooey in the middle.  They spread quite a bit, which was a pleasant surprise as I like big, flat cookies.  My family gave them two blazing thumbs up!

These cookies are now the family favorite! Kids, hubby, and all our friends beg for cowboy cookies. Didn't change a thing and they turn out great everytime! I've been making these for over a year now and I wanted to add that they have been asked for by friends as Christmas presents. These cookies are the BEST!

I thought these cookies were amazing. I made the full batch and they're almost gone! I followed the recipe exactly except I used chipits milk chocolate chips, I cooked them for about 11 minutes, and I used quick cooking oats instead of rolled oats. They're excellant, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. I highly recommend these cookies to everyone.

This recipe is amazing.  My husband is not a lover of cookies with chocolate chips but these even he loved.  The first time I made them I reduced the sugar as other reviews has said, I also put 3/4 cup or semi-sweet chocolate chip and 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips.  I didn't find they spread out as so many others had said.  They were just fine.  Next time I made them I did the regular amounts of sugar, I put semi-sweet chocolate chips, raisins and coconut.  These are definately keepers.  Not only are they the best looking cookies I've seen, they taste is just as great.  One last tip.  I made the cookies extra large.   I have an ice cream/cookie scoop that I use so that they are all uniform.  Give this recipe a try, I promise it is worth it.

These were very good, the only problem is that they spread out SO MUCH when you bake them! I put 12 cookies one one sheet and by the time they came out of the oven they were one giant blob. I had to use a knife to cut them apart into square-ish cookies, and then they had no crusts so they just fell apart. I ruined half of them when I tried to scoop them off the sheets (even though I did wait the whole five minutes for them to cool). Even after the good cookies were cooled you couldn't hold one up without supporting the whole cookie because it would just fall in half. I suggest you read other reviews to find out how to make them keep their shape. Overall a very floppy cookie. Tasted great though.

These tasted allright, but do NOT grease your cookie sheets.  I greased the first two and the edges burnt and the insides were raw.  I didn't grease the last one and they came out perfect.

These cookies got huge and flattened out.    They don't have much body to them- very doughy even when I cooked them longer.

I've made these cookies three times since I found it. I used two cups of chocolate chips instead of one and I used the mini chips. I love how chewy they stay even days after you make them. Great recipe!

This recipe is very easy to follow and the cookies turned out beautiful and delicious. I added another half cup of chocolate chips just because I thought it could use more (what's the harm of another handful of chocolate, right?). The cookies were a bit too sweet for my taste so I think I will halve the amount of sugar used next time. Other than that, the cookie's texture is perfect: crisp on the outside and chewy inside.

now i consider myself somewhat of a cookie connoisseur and these were quite up to par.  i like the chocolate chips to be a bit melty before adding them into the batter.  also, the bigger the cookie the better!!!  these taste like mrs. field's cookies!  oh and also, add a pinch of cinnamon.

Awesome cookies.  My whole family loved them.  I'll be sure to make them again.  Probably the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had or ever will have.  If you want them chewy, cook them for the minimum time.  Awesome!

A very good cookie. I did add coconut for a different twist. Even with the addition they turned out just as the recipe implied, chewy and  bit crispy. Thanks for the submission.

The flavor in these cookies is fantastic, however I found that the cooking time and temperature were not accurate, and the cookies became much too flat. I had better luck with my 3rd  cookie sheet (only 2 fit in my oven at a time!) increasing the cooking temperature to 425 and cooking about 12 minutes. Even then, I think I'll add a bit more flour next time because they're still flatter than I like. More chocolate chips would be good too! I also measured the cookies with a tablespoon rather than a teaspoon and I still got 3 dozen from the recipe. Overall a great recipe we'll be using again with a few changes.

This recipe made a huge bunch of the most wonderful, delicious, slightly chewy cookies!  So easy, too!
I refridgerated the dough about half an hour, and made medium-small cookies, and had no problem with spreading, and the thickness was perfect.
This recipe is going into my permanent file; I can recommend it enough!

Very yummy cookies, but I would say that my batch came out to more like 45 cookies, not the 60 listed.  And mine were not made big either. Great recipe!

This is the same recipe that I grew up with my mom making, she would often have to triple the recipe to have them, last for a few days with all her little cowboys running around playing cowboys and indians.

These cookies are really delicious, and a nice, subtle change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie.  The texture was melt-in-your mouth.  They were gone in about two days, and then my kids asked me to make more.

I used regular butter instead of shortening and increased the chocolate chips to an entire bag (didn’t want leftovers). This recipe was just what I wanted. I’ll make it again.

This recipe is way too sweet as is (and I say this as someone with a serious sweet tooth). The only change I made to the recipe was to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine, since other reviewers mentioned that it might help avoid the flattening/spreading problem. Next time, I'll use 3/4 c of each sugar, as others recommended. I might also add chopped walnuts...

I made this recipe exactly as written and ended up with flat greasy cookies. I added about 1/4 cup of flour and bumped the temperature to 375. Also, i refridgerator the dough.... all of which fixed that issue. Then I decided I wanted a but more cruch, so added a cup if chopped walnuts and a cup of unsweetened shredded coconut. With all of these modifications , these were some of the best cookies I've ever made. But... can't give 5 stars, because when it all came down to it... I didn't really follow the recipe, but my own instincts.

I halved the recipe and used 1/3c of each sugar. I then added 1/4 c of each chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, PB chips, shredded coconut, and pecans. I also toasted the oats for a few min on a frying pan. My cookies are always flat but these ones were nice and fluffy. I did sift the flour mixture.

These cookies are delicious! Only thing I changed was added another teaspoon of vanilla and a tad bit more salt.  Think sweet and salty...Mmmm! To solve the flat cookie problem: cream the wet ingredients well with a 2 beater mixer. The air pockets allow the baking powder and baking soda to do its magic and “support” the cookies. Google it. There are people who’ve done experimenting on varying amounts of baking powder and baking soda. They all said the same thing...the key is to cream the wet ingredients to avoid flat cookies.

I loved this recipe!!! I did add a cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of coconut....next time I think I'll adda full cup of coconut. Never had an issue with the "flat" problem...I think its cause I live in Spokane Wa and the higher elevation from say Calif or Oregon lets them rise nicely. Very good... I also increased temp to 375 and cooked 7 to 8 minutes....:)

It was AMAZING. Added some unsweetened coconut flakes and chopped pecans, and they're literally the best cookies I've ever made. Moist, just the right amount of chewy, and just all around perfect.

The trick:  cold dough & cold cookie sheets.
Put dough & cookie sheets in freezer for 15 - 20 min.    (Air bake cookie sheets are the best) 
Bake one batch at a time,  alternating the cold cookie sheets & keeping dough in freezer.  
The cold dough doesn't melt into a flat blob when you put it in the oven. The cookies are moist & chewy & fat. .  Also, add walnuts.

I'm very happy with how these turned out. I used the tip to use only 3/4C of each type of sugar. I also used one egg and one egg   yolk. I added a cup of toasted walnuts.

I make these several times a year and they always get rave reviews. Sometimes I make them without the chips and sometimes I use a mixture of chocolate and butterscotch. Everyone I make them for likes them crunchy, so I bake at 325 degrees for 14 minutes.

I made these exactly as the recipe was written.  I baked for 8 minutes and they cooked up perfectly.  They were all the rave at my Granddaughter's 2nd "Cowgirl" birthday party.  Will make these often.

Tasted good in the end, but would recommend putting the batter/dough in the fridge because  it's very sticky and hard to handle other wise.

This is my grandmas's recipe except instead of butter, she used Crisco.  She's been gone  for almost forty years now, but her fabulous cookies are still here.  The only recipe of hers I got....I think it was a good one!

This is a fabulous cookie! I changed and added a few things: I decreased both sugars to 3/4 cups like others suggested, and I added 1c chopped pecans and 1/2c shredded coconut. Baked @ 375° for 8 minutes. They turned out amazing! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

After reading other reviews about the cookies coming out flat, I used 1/4 c butter & 3/4 c shortening (in place of all butter). Also added 1/2 c each of pecan pieces and shredded coconut (because I know cowboy cookies as having lots of stuff in them, not just oatmeal choc chip). I formed the dough into balls and baked on parchment paper at 350F for 11-12 minutes.
They were perfect when warm, not flat, but a little crisp for my liking when cooled.

Made it with three cups of oats instead of two. Might try walnuts and or cranberries next time.  Made this for my wonderful co workers and got great reviews.  I used Splenda for the white and brown sugar parts.  It was a hit my first time trying it.

WOW!  Very good cookie.  Someone on Facebook recommended them.  Glad I took them up on the suggestion.  Enjoyed by all.  I adjusted the sugars to 3/4 cup and used one egg plus one egg yolk as someone else suggested.  Perfect!

I reduced amount of white flour by 1/3 and replaced it with whole whetat flour.  Gave them a delish nutty taste, almost like you added coconut to the batter.  Crazy good!  I also reduced the sugar bit.  The cowboys cookies I remember had walnuts and raisins, so I added those as well.  Perfect cookies!

As another said, I reduced the butter and sugars to 3/4 c and doubled the vanilla to 2 t.  Baked at 375.  Turned out great.  Kind of an earthy flavor to them.

Halved the recipe, then followed it exactly.  Took the cookies out of the oven a little early because they continue to cook afterward.  They turned out great! Very moist & soft in the middle with a little crunch on the edge.  Yumm.  I have since made this recipe 6 times with the same results.  Will continue using this recipe!! Love.

I have made these cookie a lot for my family !
They tasted good,   cookies flattened out and got crispy on the edges and the middle was soft. the only thing that browned was the bottom. I followed the directions. I will make this recipe again.
add some pecans 9/9/14 I made theses again and used a table spoon more of flour and they came out just wonderful.

These are my family's favorite cookie, bar nun. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I used the suggestion for 3/4 cups for sugar, 1 egg/1 egg yolk plus 2 tsp vanilla - it was my favorite Christmas cookie on the platter!! I think I will try it with raisins to see if it could satisfy my husbands oatmeal raisin cookie craving. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I don't know where I went wrong but these turned our horribly for me! The only change I made to the recipe was that I altered the number of servings from 60 to 36 (using the "Change Servings" tool on allrecipes), otherwise I followed everything to a tee. For whatever reason these were WAY too dry. I formed medium sized balls and when the timer was done they were still in the same shape, they hadn't flattened at all. I've read and re-read the recipe over again to be sure I didn't miss anything and it appears that I didn't. Not sure I'll try these again...

These were really good.  They were soft and chewy, if you do not overbake them like I did on the first sheet.  I did double up the chocolate chips and cut down a little on both of the sugars.  Will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe and my husband loved them.  I did cut the sugars to 3/4 c each.  I have found that in most cookies that tend to spread if the only add half the butter and the rest shortening the cookies stay nice and plump but you don't lose anything on taste!  The cookies are going to be gone by the end of the day.

I triple checked the recipe, and you were definetly suppose to bake them at 350 but mine seemed to never get done! For the second batch I cooked them at 375 and had better results. Not the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe.

One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made. I did take the advice of using 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk. My cookies turned out perfect, crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside! Great recipe!

I thought these would be SUPER chewy, given all the reviews.  They were less chewy than I expected, but still good.  Mine turned out a little crunchy on the outside, but chewy on the inside.

These turned out so well, I only made a change with the type of chips I used. I used 1 cup butterscoth chips and 1 cup 1 cup milk chocolate chips. Other than that I followed the recipe. I also used a 1/4 cup measure in making the cookies I rolled them into balls, baked them and was a happy camper!! They were big, tasty and did not last long thanks for the recipe I will make these again! It's easy to play around with the types of chips used next time I will try white chocolate:-)

I was extremely disappointed with how these cookies turned out.  For some reason, I didn't read the reviews and followed this recipe as is.  BIG mistake.  They were very flat, not a bit chewy.  I will give the recipe another try following the suggestions only because I like the combination of oatmeal with the traditional chocolat chip cookies.  The dough was delicious.  I've definitely learned my lesson...read the reviews.  So that's why i have to rate this low...I was very disappointed when I followed the recipe exactly.

These are awesome!!!  I also cut the recipe in half and added craisins.  YUMMY!!!  Mine were very flat but were still great! Next time I'll try another reviewer suggestion to make them a little fluffier.

I just pulled these out of the oven and I tested on and they are so yummy! My beagle also came running into the kitchen when I pulled them out, so they must smell pretty good too! :) I cut the recipe in half, since it is just my husband and I, but I didn't change anything. Yum. Just want this pregnant lady needed!

Halved the recipe and here are my changes: added a trail mix of nuts/raisins/M & M's to it, also added some coconut, and some chunky peanut butter. Hubby and I LOVE them and the recipe is a keeper. Our local store, Publix, used to make Cowboy Cookies and I have been trying to come up with something as satisfying and think I found it - thanks!

I made a few changes to make the recipe a little healthier. I substituted all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and substituted the white sugar with Splenda. I also used only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and added a 1/2 cup of raisens. Turned out great!

Worked perfectly for me.  Very similar to cowboy cookies my mother made in the 50's.  I think her recipe was from a magazine clipping that got lost long ago.

These are the best cookies ever if you cook them 'just' right. The trick to this is cook it for 15 minutes and and after the timer goes off if they are a little bit golden around the edges then take them out even if they don't look cooked all the way and let them cool then eat them with a glass of milk.

Delicious, chewy cookies. Like other reviewers have mentioned, they are kind of flat, but that doesn't seem to negatively affect the texture. I will make again with modifications suggested by others to combat flatness. Thanks!

i'm not sure WHY i made this recipe--i think because it had so many ratings. i sure am glad i did! although time consuming (the rest on the cookie sheet before removal) they came out looking like perfection itself! thank you for sharing!

So good!  I made these on Saturday but followed some people's suggestion and did 3/4 cup of both sugars and about 2 tsp of vanilla.  They turned out great!  I brought some to work and they're still chewy and they aren't TOO sweet.  An easy recipe that got rave reviews from my co-workers and friends!  Thanks!

These weren't my favorite oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I tend to like a gooey center and these were more cake like. But they still went over well at a party. The only thing I changed in the recipe was I added cinnamon.

These cookies are fantastic!  Sometimes I cut the sugars by 1/4 cup and add some chopped peanut butter cups.  As for the "flatness" problem, I drop the dough into "high" rounded spoonfuls and they turn out perfect.

These cookies are abslutely delicious! I followed the tips from the other reviews. I cut down the sugar to 3/4 of a cup each and I used 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I also cooked them at 375 degrees but only for about 7 minutes. This made them softer when they cooled so they will hopefully last a little bit longer without getting hard.

These cookies are really melt-in-your-mouth yummy. I made a few subs to make them a bit healthier. I reduced the white and brown sugars to 2/3 cups each, cut the butter to 3/4 cups, used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and used only 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. My advice is to mix the dry and wet ingredients well separately and expect lots of stickiness.

I love these cookies. I finally have found a flat, crispy oatmeal cookie. I made the recipe exactly as it is written.

Husband LOVED them!  Not crispy at all!  Nice and chewy :-)  I doubled the chips and added a cup of pecans too.

These were very good!  We had a cookie exchange at work and I made these.  They were a hit.  They came out soft and chewy even though I had to bake them for a little bit longer than the recipe says.

I am a cookie fiend and this sounded good. As suggested I added the extra baking powder and did 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 reg b/c I like more of a crunch to my cookie. The cookies were more gooey than chewy and were really frustrating to get off the cookie sheet which is why I gave it 3 stars.  Good flavor, just hard to remove from the sheet in one piece or if I waited too long I would have 
to chip it off!:(

Perfect! Mine came out chewy and crispy. I used 1/2 ww flour. I'm a bit confused though.....what are rolled oats? Are they old fashioned or quick cook? I googled and I'm still confused. Hmmmmm

The taste was good on these. But as another reviewer mentioned, these came out too flat. I would not use this recipe again.

These are super yum! I took some suggestions and used butter-flavored shortening instead of butter, and added butterscotch chips to the mix as well. I think the butterscotch makes them a little too sweet, so maybe next time Ill decrease the sugar just a bit.

The cookies were okay, but not great.  They were really flat.  I tried adding milk to the second batch as someone suggested and it made them even more flat.  Would not use this recipe again.

These are good. Followed SVROSS's advice(minus the egg yolk) and did not have a flat cookie. Could use just a little spice to it. It's definitly a cross between a chocolate chip and an oatmeal cookie.

these cookies are okay. Not bad, not really good either. My husband thought there was something missing there in the texture. I also was little dissappointed with the flat appearance. It was way too flat. Over all, it's just a pretty good cookie, but I will try another oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe.

LOVE these cookes! They are our new fave for sure! I've made them a couple times now, and the only thing I do differently is I use 1 cup white flour, and 1 cup whole wheat. They've turned out great each time :)

I made these for a crowded cottage and they were gone within hours. My uncle and friend were huge fans, as well as everyone else. Instead of chocolate chips though I used about 3/4c raisins and 3/4c craisins. They're delicious =)

I don't like to rate recipes poorly, but these were not good. They didn't cook right at all, and I had to throw them all out. These were a waste of time, and ingredients. I won't be making these again, sorry!

This is so heavenly, one of my best cookie recipes, I halved it without a problem, except the dough seemed a tad dry, although I think that was due to a mistake on my part. I reduced the sugar and used margarine. But the best thing is, they are crunchy and crisp on the outside with just the right amount of chewiness in the middle, even after a day! If you want them to remain this way, store it in a metal cookie can, like one of those Danish butter cookie cans, those are perfect for storing homemade cookies. Beautiful cookies. Thanks.

These cookies were delicious!  I needed to bake them for about fifteen minutes, but other than adding a few more chocolate chips, the recipe was perfect.  The cookies were moist but had a crunchy outside.  Absolutely wonderful!  I will most definitely make them again!

I added instant vanilla pudding to the mix (from another recipe on this site) and also milk chocolate and cinnamon chips. Delicious. Bake until just lightly browned and they will set up nice and still remain chewy.

Great cookies!  I cut down the sugar to 3/4c as advised by some of the reviews.  Just follow the cooking time!  Even if it looks overcooked it will turn out great once they cool.  Will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing

Great cookies. We used slightly less sugar. The key to avoiding flat cookies is to use half shortening and half real butter. That's how I made this recipe and the cookies were delightfully plump.

These cookies are the best.  I added raisins and butterscotch chips along with the chocolate. I cooked them about 9 min.  They looked soft in the middle but once they cooled were perfectly chewy.  I think this is my favorite cookie recipe yet!

Very, very good!  Just the right consistency...chewy with the choclate chips melting in your mouth. YUM! They didn't spread at all, like many oatmeal cookies.  They were just right and a big hit at our house.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great cookie.  The first batch I baked for 8 minutes and was not thrilled.  The second batch I baked for 7 minutes and what a difference a minute made.  (ovens do vary)  The whole family enjoyed.  Thanks

Excellent cookies!!  I just took them out of the oven and all turned out nice and golden.  They are nice and chewy with the outside of the cookie crisp ( if that makes any sense).  I cooked mine for 12 minutes.  I put in 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  I also made one pan with no chocolate chips thus decreasing the amount of chocolate chips to 3/4 cup also.

Yummy! Mine didn't flatten out at all. I used 2tsp vanilla and also 3/4 cups white and brown sugar. Make sure you sift the flour and you cream the butter/sugar mixture. Maybe this is why people's cookies didn't turn. EDIT: After one day these cookies started to harden and taste bland...not as great as I first thought...will continue my search for a better coookie.

I don't know what happened, but my cookies flattened out and were a little too greasy for me. After the second batch like that I added about 1/2 cup more flour, and that seemed to help. The taste was great - I added 1/2 teaspoon of both cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. These cookies are good, but something about the recipe isn't right. Oven rack issue? Try it and see.

These cookies were fabulous! I used 1 1/3 cups whole wheat flour and 2/3 cup all-purpose flour, reduced sugars to 3/4 cup each, reduced margarine just slightly, to about 4/5 cup.  Turned out great!

This one is a good one. I baked these for a friend as a birthday gift. She shared them with her staff and they all raved!  If you are looking for a cross between oatmeal cookies and choc. chip, this is a fine middle-ground!

I love this one except I replace the vanilla with almond extract it gives the cookies a great twist, and mimics a bakery that made them like that when I was a kid.

These are really, really good cookies! If you are looking for a plain oatmeal, these aren't it. They are best with the chocolate chips. I wouldn't make this and omit those. I make these all the time for my husband, kids, and his coworkers!

These cookies were delicious.  In our family we lost our favorite oatmeal chocolate chip recipe so I decided to find a temporary substitute.  This recipe may no longer be a substitute.  They were awesome. I also reduced both sugars to 3/4cup.  In order to make sure the cookies stayed chewy the day after, I took them out of the oven when they were a tad bit doughy. They were just as delicious on the 2nd and 3rd day.  Thank you for this recipe!

Wonderful recipe -- I did as others recommended and used 3/4 cups brown and white sugar.  I made the cookies a bit larger, too.  They were superb and passed the ultimate test...my husbands and three daughters gobbled them up!

Yummy! I did like everyone suggested and decreased both sugars to 3/4 c and increased the amount of chips. My husband said he didn't like them THAT much, but 24 hours after I made them, there were only 3 left. Yum!!

I also cut the butter and sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I added half a cup of walnuts for kicks, and they turned out great.  They don't flatten out for me at all though.  They freeze great.

FINALLY!! A great oatmeal cookie recipe that my husband AND kids love. I split the recipe in half and made choc chip (for the kids) and raisin. Thanks for the great recipe Bonnie!!  P.S. I also did as some suggested and only used 3/4 cups when it came to the sugar.

Although I have a HUGE collection of cookie recipes, something about this recipe jumped out at me, so I thought I would try it. Boy am I glad I did! I made it for the first time while making up my usual 'cookie plates' for neighbors and family and this one received the most compliments! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

My boyfriend and I loved this cookies.  He couldn't stop eating them! To make them chewy i used two egg yolks, and removed the egg white. I also added chopped walnuts in mine. I'll absolutely make these again.

I added 1 cup of raisins to the dough along with the chocolate chips and rolled oats and they were absolutely sensational !  This is a cookie recipe that gets requested over and over again in our house.

I gave this exceptionally delicious recipe 5's across the board. I used to be a dessert tester for a dessert shop and these are by far the best cowboy cookies I have ever tried. They were not too flat or too sweet. This is a incredible cookie recipe.

This is the first time for me on this site.  I wanted a recipe for oatmeal cookies.  In the morning I found this recipe.  In the afternoon I bought the ingredients.  And in the evening I was enjoying these delicious cookies.  I gave it 5 stars, but my only "gripe" is that they didn't have enough oatmeal or oatmeal flavor in them.  But I still give them an A+

Excellent!!!  Chewy and crispy all at the same time.  However, I did not get anywhere close to 60 cookies.  Perhaps some went missing before I could get them into the tin?

This recipe is terrific.  The cookies are crisp at the edge but wonderfully chewy in the middle.  I used chopped dark chocolate bars instead of chips which makes a beautiful cookie.

I just started baking again, after a couple of year with little time on my hands, and this recipe was so good, and easy to make, I don't think I will look for another Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookie recipe ever again.

GREAT recipe! My kids aren't crazy about oatmeal so I put the oatmeal in a blender and processed to a finer texture before adding it to the dough-turned out perfect-wonderful taste. This cookie is also good with raisins and/or nuts.I'll be making this again!!
