This recipe is fabulous! I toyed with it a little bit based on what other reviewers had to say, and it came out perfect. I sauteed fresh spinach with the onions, as well as with minced garlic and sundried tomatoes in butter, and I used fresh plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise. I also used a combination of cheddar cheese and feta cheese, which was good for the texture of the quiche. And, because everyone seemed to stress this, I used an extra egg. I also definitely used some salt :) Anyway, this is a great recipe, and it even yielded two quiches, which were both gone almost instantaneously! Wonderful.

Super! I used a deep dish crust and added an extra egg. I filled my quiche with every veggie I had in the fridge: onion, red peppers, chopped broccoli, garlic. Saute over medium heat until nearly soft. Instead of frozen spinach, I layered fresh on the bottom of my pie shell, spooned sauteed veggies on top, layered with cheese - I added feta as well as cheddar, and top with egg mixture. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes covered with foil, remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes. Perfect!

This was amazing! Based on other reviews I cut the mayo back to 1/3 cup, left the milk at 1/2 cup and added an egg (to total 5). Also added 1/2 tsp of salt to the egg mixture, and layered the spinach as well as some chopped sundried tomatoes with cheddar AND feta cheese. Instead of squeezing the spinach dry, I thawed it in a skillet and sauted it with onions and a few frozen diced green peppers I had on hand. I used a deep dish pie crust and it filled it perfectly. I tried 3 new breakfast recipes for a brunch for 20 and this was by far the best!!!

The crowd goes wild!!
My first quiche ever, and what a hit! I used other suggestions i.e. Sauted onions and spinach (used frozen spinach, thawed and drained really well). Also added some feta with the chedddar. Did not add any extra egg, and no salt (cheese is salty enough.) I used a frozen deep dish 9" pie crust, so it all fit into the crust. Baked it for 50 min. covered then uncovered about 10 min. until crust nice and golden. 
They were begging for more!!

This was great-tasting and easy to make.  Luckily, I bought a package of 2 pie shells and ended up using both of them.  I got regular nine inch shells and there was not enough room in one for all the ingredients.  I will make this again.

This recipe was fab-u-lous!!  Only changed a few things:  used only half of the spinach (that's alot of spinach!!) added a handful of fresh diced tomatoes, some diced ham and added salt, pepper and garlic salt.  Used a deep dish pie plate, so it yielded only one pie.  Very, very tastey.  Thanks!!

I loved this recipe! My Husband who turns his nose up at Quiche had 2 Large helpings and then asked when could I make it again. I added mushrooms to the quich at the last minute and more shredded cheese on top. I easily doubled the recipe and froze the extra quiche for lunches at work and they reheated up great in the microwave.

This was excellent.  I added a tiny bit of minced garlic, and a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, and both were excellent.  The baked quiche did not set as solidly as I normally like, so next time I would add an egg and cut back a bit on the milk/mayo mixture.  Otherwise, this was a great treat.

Not impressed. WAY TOO much spinach, it was overpowering! If I make this again (probably won't) I will use 1/2 the spinach.

Thought this was great WITH changes:

Sauteed onions and 2 cloves of garlic with fresh spinach for filling.  Reduced mayo to 1/3 cup and used 5 eggs (after reading other reviews).  With these changes 5 STARS!

This was my very first quiche so it took me a little longer to put it together.  It turned out scrumptious.  I only had regular mayonnaise so I used 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup of plain yogurt.  I used 4 oz of cheddar cheese and 4 oz of 3-cheese Italian...very nice combination.  I used fresh spinach, but didn't see any reports saying how much to use when using fresh so I used a whole bag of baby spinach.  That was a little too much so the next time I will use about 3/4 bag and also chop the spinach.  We have always bought quiche's from supermarket deli's, but will make my own from now on.  My husband loved it and the only tiny issue was to chop the spinach next time.  Lovely recipe.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 extra egg, sauteed the onion and spinach first, used yogurt instead of mayo, and added some feta.  Excellent.

This recipe calls for too much spinach. I only used 5 ounces of fresh organic spinach, and I still felt this was too much spinach. I would probably use only 3-4 ounces next time. I sauteed the spinach with garlic powder and onions. I also had 2 ounces of left over deli ham that I added to the quiche. I totally recommend adding the ham because the taste of the ham added a delicious flavor. I also added an extra egg. My last critique is the cooking time. Because I added the extra egg, it took longer to cook. I cooked it on 45 minutes on 400 and saw that it needed a lot more time because the center was wet. I end up taking the foil off to cook. I recommend taking the foil off maybe at 30 minutes cooking time and cook the remaining 15 minutes with the foil off.

The 4 stars is for the original recipe. Needed salt and a few spices, but otherwise good. But tonight I made changes. Used half light mayo, half light sour cream. For those saying the mayo imparts a sweet flavor, be sure it's mayo and not miracle whip or the really cheap mayo, both of which are much sweeter. For the cheese I added half feta and half low fat shredded Mexican. Used half a box of frozen spinach along with red bell peppers and zucchini, though the first time I used a whole box of spinach  and did not find it at all too much. Used shallots and garlic vs onion and sautéed them with all the veggies first. Lastly, I didn't use crust this time. Cuts way down on the fat and calories. Just spray a 9 inch pie pan with cooking spray and follow the recipe. Both times I used just 4 eggs and found it to be enough. Added a little salt, pepper and basil as well. This basic recipe is so versatile and so light and fluffy! Make it with the same basic ingredients and add your own flair. Delicious, fun and even an easy clean up. Thanks Kristin!

After reading several reviews, I made the following changes to the recipe.  I used fresh spinach (the salad bag b/c I had it leftover), and sauteed it with the onions and garlic.  Also used leftover sauteed veggies that I had from making fajitas (onions, red/green peppers, mushrooms, corn)  Didn't saute the leftover veggies -- just added them into the pie crust.  Also used a combination of feta and chedder cheese, and two extra eggs (most people suggested adding one extra, but b/c I made two quiches with this recipe, I used 6 eggs.  I also added a little extra milk and only used 1/3 cup of olive oil mayonnaise.  It was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this quiche day before yesterday and followed the recipe to the T.  I, personally didnt' think there was too much spinach BUT...my quiche was definitely NOT light and fluffy.  More dense and heavy but GREAT TASTE. The density may have been due to using the full amount of spinach called for so next time I'll try it with maybe 1/2 or 3/4 spinach.  Mine cooked fully in the first 45 minutes of time indicated.  Thanks Kristinjoni...good one.

Super yummy and super easy! Like others, I added an egg and sauteed the spinach and onion (with a bit of fresh garlic) before layering with cheese and egg mixture.  Set up beautifully and was a hit with the family -- even the kids!  Next time, I'll add a little salt, but otherwise a great recipe!

Best Quiche I've had! I've made this countless times - always get rave reviews! I follow the recipe exactly, the only exception is that I saute the onions till they are lightly brown (otherwise they come out crunchy.. not good!).

I added the extra egg, reduced the mayo a bit and sauteed fresh spinach with the onion. Fabulous! And SO easy! My in-laws were impressed and we had the leftovers for dinner.

This was very good for such a simple recipe.  The only thing I did different from the instructions was to add a little salt and pepper to the filling; and I stirred all the ingredients together before pouring the filling into the crust, instead of layering them.  One note--this makes a very full 9" pie, so next time a might use a deep-dish crust.

This was my first Quiche.  I made it for a brunch and it was amazing.  It was gone quickly.  I went with the 5 eggs.  I used frozen broccoli (thawed and squeeze dried), a little leftover Christmas ham, 1/2 lite cheddar cheese and 1/2 fat free feta cheese.  I only used 1/3 cup mayonnaise  I sauteed the onions, broccoli and ham in a little olive oil before I started the layering.  I also used a frozen deep dish pie crust.  Can't wait to make it again and neither can my family.

Great no fail for me, and versatile, but the rest of the family says not enough substance, too light and fluffy. I haved added shredded veggies, spinach, various cheeses, etc.

I substituted yogurt for the mayonnaise to make it healthier, and it turned out great- the fluffiest quiche I have ever tried.  I only had vanilla flavored yogurt on hand, and it did not make it taste strange, but I would have used plain if I'd planned ahead!  I reduced the oven temperature to 375 after awhile since the outside was getting brown too quickly.

very good -- will keep as base recipe and change up filling if necessary!  

i did not want 2 quiches, so i did my best to adjust.  i sauteed 1 bunch fresh spinach, 1/4 onion and scoop of minced garlic and put it in the bottom of my "deep dish" shell.  covered with 3/4 c. shredded cheese.  topped with mix of 4 eggs, 1/4 c. plain yogurt and 1/4 c. milk, pepper.  baked as specified.  great, thank you!

Yummy.  I sauted the onion and fresh spinach (it was what I had on hand).  I reduced the mayo to 1/3 of a cup.  I also added ham as it was for dinner and my husband likes meat.  Four eggs worked great in a regular pie crust.  Wonderful flavor for such an easy recipe.  Next time I might add some sliced mushrooms to the mix.

This was good. I sauted the onions and used fresh spinach which I sauted before adding it to the egg mixture. A very filling and delicious breakfast.

This was excellent!  My husband ate 1/2 of the quiche in one sitting!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out so well and is a delicious light quiche.. (of course the next day after all that cheese and mayo and scrumptious crust we had to run for an hour!)  Will definitely make this again and share this recipe with friends.

EDITED TO ADD: 6/8/15 - I have been using this recipe for nearly 8 years now and STILL love it.... I always add extra onion and feta cheese for extra flavor.  Funny reading my original "rating" of this recipe (and othersI have reviewed) as I always mention my boyfriend who became my husband and now I"m serving this quiche (and other staples that I found/love from allrecipes.com) to our kiddos! ;)

My family really enjoyed this quiche.  I added a jar of artichoke hearts and fresh mushrooms plus chives.  Very good! Addendum: 5/10/09:  Making again today for a Mothers Day get together.  I wanted to add that I mixed all ingredients together and did so again today (I did not layer).  My granddaughter and daughter have also made this recipe and love it.  I, too double the recipe using 3 (very full)deep dish pie crusts.  YUM!

A little trick I learnt. To get all the liquid out of the spinach use a potatoe ricer if you have one. It is the greatest tool I have in my kitchen when a recipe calls for spinach. Just put the spinach in the ricer and press down, it gets rid of all that extra liquid! I also use it for Swiss Chard after cooking it. I can't rate this just yet because I am still baking it but I am sure it will be great!

This was my first time making quiche. It turned out well. I made it with Greek yogurt as other reviews suggested. I also added a dash of salt and pepper. It turned out great, even hubby went for seconds (after balking at the idea of quiche). I would recommend however the deep dish pie crust as mine overflowed and killed my drip tray. Also rather than layering all the ingredients I just mixed them together in the bowl, and then poured into the crust.

Used less mayo, a deep dish pie shell, and fresh spinach. Also added some diced bell pepper and baby portabello mushrooms in with the layers. It turned out amazing! Made it twice already and just found this recipe 2 weeks ago :)

My family loved this recipe! I changed it up based on other posters' recommendations. I used fresh spinach, and added other sauteed veggies. I also put tarragon and thyme in with the veggies, & it was good. My kids (ages 10 & 7) plowed through it.

Very easy with a nice taste.  I omitted the pie crust (to save on calories) and it was delicious!  The whole family loved it even the kids!

Best simple quiche recipe I've found.  I added a pinch of nutmeg, salt and garlic powder and it turned out really good.  I've tried more sophisticated recipes and they weren't as good as this simple one.  Will make this my go-to quiche recipe!

I made some changes, like sauteed onion and diced red pepper strips, also added red pepper flakes for a bit of heat....Deliciously yummy.  Makes a enough for 2 regular or one deep dish quiche!  Excellent basic recipe, with enough potential to make it your own, with your favorite add ins.

I add sundried tomatoes, feta and garlic. I saute the spinach, onion, garlic and sundried tomatoes before adding to the pie.  I use 1/3 cup of mayo and add a 5th egg per everyone's suggestions.  Best quiche I've ever had!  It does make too much so I either use two 9" pie crusts or use one and make the other one crust-less.  (I may love the crust-less one more!)

So I made this, following the recipe as best I could while adding a few extras (one extra egg, tomato, a bit of yellow pepper, a bit of shredded carrot, chunks of left over ham)  And it turned out pretty darn good!  I ended up with far too much for my little pie pan so I made 2, one with crust and one without.  They were both delicious!  :)  Yum!   I especially like that it's basically a whole wholesome meal all in one.  I served it with french fries and ketchup.

Delicious!  I sauted mushrooms and garlic and added to the egg mixture.  Added a little salt and pepper. Added one extra egg (to make 5) like others suggested, was the perfect amount for one pie.  Only needed 4 oz. cheese for one though. Was a huge hit at a potluck, was gone in seconds!

I used swiss instead of cheddar and threw in a couple ounces of feta.  I sauteed/carmelized the onions with butter and sauteed a bag of fresh spinach with them.  I also added a 5th egg.  Made two quiches.  Topped each with tomato slices.  It was unbelievably delicious!

Really good! I mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering them. I also used 1 cup reduced fat cheddar and 1/3 cup feta cheese, just because I had it and wanted to use it up. I'll definitely make this again.

I offered to a quiche dish for an office party. So, I searched for recipes for quiche dishes and came across this one. I did "a little" modifying and had rave reviews.  The amount I used unfortnately was not measured but made two helpings of the rectangular baking trays.  I used a only a table spoon of mayo, about 2cups of fat free half and half, added dijon mustard, spinach, cheese, a scoop of sour cream, and turkey sausages.  The turkey sausages flavored the dish, so I did not need to add any other salt or seasoning except pepper.  This was a great simple "guide" to base off my quiche. I plan to make this again for my family. THANKS!!!

This was my first quiche that I had ever made, but it was relatively easy....a bit time consuming, but it wasn't hard at all. I followed the reviews of others....only used 1/2 bag of FRESH spinach and sauteed that in a pan with the amount of onion in the original recipe, and garlic (1 clove) and red pepper (1/4 of a red pepper). Additionally, I split the cheese amount so it was 1/2 cheddar (freshly grated) and 1/2 feta. I also used less mayo as directed in this and I used an extra egg (totaling 5 eggs). I also sprinkled a little extra cheese on top. Took the foil off the top at the very end adn cooked 20 minutes (after the 45 minutes)iwthouth the foil until it looked solid. LOVED IT and so did my boyfriend who never had a quiche before.

Great recipe! I forgot to buy spinach at the store so I used broccoli instead. It was still fabulous. I followed advice and used an extra egg and also used feta cheese. I served it at book club and it was a hit!

my boyfriend and i loved this recipe. i took rockkitten's advice left in her comment on this page to use plain yogurt instead of mayo and adding some feta with the cheddar for texture (i used 3/4 cup cheddar and 1/4 feta). good suggestions, it came out great! i also included red bell pepper and crimini mushrooms and as a finishing touch placed a sprig of rosemary in the center. bon appetit!

Great Recipe!  I modified this recipe a bit. I used frozen spinach and dried it after draining. I took the advice from others and added an extra egg to make it more fluffy. I used regular mayo. Instead of onion, I subtituted bacon bits. I used the four cheese shredded blend from the grocey store.  For spices I added a about a tsp of salt and black pepper and 1/2 tsp of onion salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I mixed all the ingredients together and poured into a Pillsbury deep dish pie crust. I added a bit more cheese on top the last minutes of cooking.  It turned out so yummy! I will be making this a lot.  My husband even loved it and he never eats vegtables. He finished it all.

I didn't rate this because I changed it so much it's not the same recipe. I used pilsbury crecent roll dough for the crust and it made it too rich- I peeled the crust off of it and it was soooo good. I used half reduced fat cheddar, half part skim mozzarella and part reduced fat feta. MMMMM Also added a clove of garlic and used plain yogurt instead of mayo. I didn't add that extra egg, but I will next time. It also took a long time to cook but I think that's because I didn't cut the spinach small enough. ANYWAY, a GREAT recipe. loved it

this was also my first attempt at quiche.  my husband and i are trying the low carb kick, so i too made it crustless.  just well greased a 9 inch pie plate. since we are more worried about carbs than fat, i used real heavy cream and full fat mayo. the only other additions i made were to add a half a handful of fresh chopped dill, and a few pinches of nutmeg and fresh ground pepper.  it was so delicious we could barely save 2 pieces to eat for breakfast this morning!

This recipe was very good!  Even my kids liked it.  My son invited the neighbor boy over for dinner and I chucked and said, "sure!".  HE even ate it.  I doubt they would ever ask for it, but at least they ate it...without even complaining.

Definitely not for the fat or cholesterol conscious...but a fabulous tasting recipe!  I was surprised that there were not any spices in the recipe, but it was very flavorful without them.

This Quiche recipe was great and pretty easy to make.  Would also be good with other veggies or meat in it, such as sausage or ground beef, broccoli, or green beans.

Absolutely fantastic ,,,like others who followed the recipe I added an egg and cut the mayo in half There was enough for 2 pies. I added some ham, bacon broccoli and tomatoes in one, and just cheese and spinach in the other,,,Looks like this will make it into the weekly dinner roster!

I thought this tasted alright. My only real complaint is that despite cooking it an extra 8 minutes covered and chopping the onion small, some of them were still a little crunchy. I would sweat the onions before adding them to this. I used a bag of fresh spinach, cleaned it, de-stemmed it, and cooked it in the microwave for 2 minutes to squeeze the excess water out. I did half swiss and half cheddar. The swiss cheese worked well in this, and I recommend it for extra flavor. I thought the onion taste was just a bit too strong.

I love this recipe! I also love being able to read all the input from other users so I can tweak it to my liking. I noticed when I used greek yogurt instead of the mayo, the quiche is lighter and fluffier. I usually add spinach, broccoli, onions, salt, pepper, cheddar cheese, and I'm going to try black olives this time! A friend asked me for a good quiche recipe and I sent him straight to this one and he loves it so much he makes it once a week, experimenting with different mixes! This recipe is a great base to start with, especially if you've never made quiche before.

I used lowfat plain yogurt instead of mayo, added 1 egg, and substituted fresh kale for spinach. Most importantly, I used a homemade whole wheat crust made with 1 stick of unsalted butter cut into 1 t sugar, 1.5 c whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/2 t salt, plus enough milk to moisten (about 4 T). The quiche was very fluffy and full of flavor, and the crust was delicious!

This was pretty good. My first time cooking Quiche second time eating it. I liked that this was lighter and less calories than the one my friend cooked although next time I will probably add some extra veggies to it. Made two pies since I had a package that came with two and they weren't deep dish. Layered cheese on the top of one and spinach on the top of the other, the one with spinach on top was better.

First time I've ever made quiche and it came out perfect.  I used 5 eggs and less mayo, as suggested in other reviews.  By far the simplest recipe.  Huge crowd pleaser.  I use the recipe as a base and add different veggies each time.

This was great.  I made one w turkey sausage (as is the life of a vegetarian w a meat eating family) and one without. I'd DEFINITELY encourage you to lessen the mayo (I barely used any) and compensated and bit with milk. I added an extra egg and made 2 quiches. I also decided to make it more filling with shredded potatoes (hashbrowns) in there. It was a success!

This was excellent! I looked over the other reviews and took them into consideration while following the original recipe and this is the FIRST quiche of many that came out beautiful, fluffy, and fully COOKED when it was time to come out of the oven! Thank you so much for sharing! I'll turn to this recipe time and again, I'm sure!!

I used the basis ingredients and added my own vegies (fresh spinach, onion and mushrooms), feta along with the cheddar, some garlic powder and salt and followed others advice of 5 eggs and 1/3c mayo, and I topped it with fresh tomato slices,  it was delicious!  I use pillsbury roll out crust, which is also as good as homemade.

Made this for weekend guests and they loved it.  I used fresh spinach, half feta cheese and half cheddar cheese.  Made it with both bought and homemade pie crust and both were exceptional. Even gave recipe to one of the guests so she could make it herself.  Husband ate it and he is picky eater!  A Keeper!

I just made this simple healthy spinach quiche recipe. And it takes GREAT!  I added a few extras to the recipe. I added 3 cloves garlic, 2 scallions, parsley flakes, instead of regular milk, I used evaporated milk, black pepper and salt and other spices of my choice. I thought it needed a few extras. I would recommend adding other things that appeal to your taste. I am going to definitely make this pie again but I am going to add other veggies to see what flavors it brings. And this is a very fluffy quiche which I like. Good luck preparing and enjoy.

We make Quiche at least once a month, and I'm always looking for a few new tricks. This recipe had it. I was skeptical of the mayo, but it ended up being great. Fluffy, but still had a nice firmness. I did add an extra egg and cut back on the mayo (olive oil mayo) to 1/3 c. I also sauteed fresh spinach, onion and garlic first. I really think that is the way to go. Great flavor and texture. Love it! One suggestion: for those feeling the need to add salt...the salt from the cheese is just right for us, when we added a just pinch to the mix it was too much.

This was delicious I was surprised that my husband loved it (I was hoping he wouldn't=more for me)  The only thing I would do different would be to make it in a larger pie crust.  Rather  than that I only used 7 oz of spinach and less cheese.after making a few times I found it better to mix all ingredients instead of layering. Easier and it was great.

I make this without a crust, and it is perfect every time. This recipe is great as it is, or with additional veggies added. I add some crumbled feta and cherry tomatoes, and I saute the onion first then the spinach until it is wilted (I use fresh). I have also used mushrooms before, cooking them with the onion. You can essentially add whatever extra vegetables you like! Love it!

Mine turned out really well.  I used less spinach than the recipe called for because it was all I had in the house, and I added an extra egg, as some other reviewers had suggested.  It turned out perfectly.  Yum!

Very easy. I used fresh spinach and added some crumbled bacon. My picky 4-year-old even enjoyed it.

Super easy to make, and delicious. It was a huge hit with my family. It tastes even better the second day. I used fresh spinach, and green onions. Absolutely delicious, and will use this recipe from now on. Only thing is that it takes a lot longer to cook than the directions state.

I was going to make this quiche as written, however I didn't have the spinach or onion in my pantry like I thought. The great thing about this recipe is that the base ingredients make a terrific quiche even if you substitute things you have on hand.  I had some diced ham left over so I put a couple handfulls of diced ham, added 3/4 can of chopped artichokes, a handful of sliced black olives and voila I had a very tasty quiche that my husband gobbled up and then asked for seconds.  I will use this recipe whenever I have eggs and some left over veggies/meat in the fridge! Thanks for the great quiche!

This was very tasty. Much tastier than store bought quiches. I followed the cooking instructions exactly but ended up putting it back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes because I thought that would firm it up a little more.  
I also added mushrooms and I think that really added to the nice flavour. My boyfriend loved it too. By the way, I used frozen pastry shells, as I have never made pastry before, and they were good enough for me.

used the "best pie crust" on this site. Very easy to make and really tasty. Not too many eggs, and the kids loved it! It does make a lot, so make sure to place the pie on a cookie sheet (preferably covered with foil for easy cleanup!) to avoid messy spills!I also sauteed the onions until transluscent which made them even more tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe, will wanna do it again!

I guess I'm just rating the mayo, milk and egg mixture.  I used sauteed onion, red pepper and steamed brocolli for the filling and skipped the pie crust.  It baked up very nicely and didn't get brown on the bottom.  I did spray the pan with Pam first.  I never salt any thing, but this needed salt.  It tasted slightly sweet, due to the mayo.  Next time I make it, I'll be sure to add some cayanne pepper and some salt to counter act the sweet, which was rather unappealing.  It is definately worth altering though, since my dad and stepmother raved over it and begged to be given the left overs.  (They are both big fans of salt and added it at the table.)  I had hoped to have enough egg for two frittatas but had just enough for one even though I used jumbo eggs.  (Could be due to the lack of crust I guess.)  All in all, it was nice and fluffy, not too brown and crusty, but entirely too sweet for a savory egg dish.  Don't forget the salt and spices.

Yummy! We had this for supper tonight. I used regular mayo and cheese since that's what I had and I made my own crust. Followed instructions exactly. Hubby and 6 yr. old daughter loved it. Wonderful flavor, bakes up perfectly to a nice, golden brown. I've made quiches before but none were so tasty. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!
Note: I've also made this sans crust since I'm the only one who likes crust in our family and it turns out just fine that way too.

Very good base recipe!  You could use almost any type of cheese and filling.  It really is light and fluffy in those amounts.  I used chopped ham and partly steamed broccoli that I had on hand.  I'll use this recipe often.

Who needs the fat of heavy cream as in other recipes? This is healthier and tastes great. I ran short on spinach, so I added frozen chopped broccoli. I'll definitely make this again.

Amazing! I made this for a neighbor's first wedding anniversary brunch and they became our best friends! They couldn't say enough about it. I used sharp Cheddar cheese to give it some bite and added crumbled bacon to the layers with the rest of the ingredients. Next time, I'll try a pepper jack cheese, one with jalapenos. Ham would be a nice addition as well if bacon is too fattening. I doubled the recipe and made one for my husband and I. We ate it 3 mornings in a row. This is a hit.

I used a deep-dish pie crust, blind-baked it for 10 minutes as another reviewer suggested, and added some crumbled bacon.  I sauteed the onion in some butter and added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and I also mixed everything together in a big bowl. Great recipe to have on hand for a simple supper.

I added an additional egg because people seemed to think it needed it in other reviews. This was the BEST quiche I have ever made! I used regular mayo because that's all I had and bought the low fat cheese feeling skeptical, but it was perfect! I thought the amount of spinach was perfect too. I used a frozen crust in a tin. The preparation was super fast and I had to make myself stop eating it! I will make this over and over again.

edit: I should add, be careful when covering with the foil. My foil stuck to the top of it, so leave some space maybe.

Update: This time I made this with egg beaters and canola mayo (both no cholesterol) and it was STILL perfect!

use only 1/3 c. light mayo and I spin out the liquid in the spinach with my lettuce spinner then squeeze out the rest in paper towels, thats the trick if using frozen spinach you must remove most of the liquid...

Really liked this recipe, and also thanks to other readers suggestions to substitute plain yogurt for mayo and use plain cooked brown rice as a crust, to make it healthier.  I also added lots of spices including garlic pepper, curry powder, oregano.  Most great dishes need added spices to your personal taste.

I've made this Quiche several times and it is the best.  Sautee'ing the onions is not necessary, they are a perfect consistency after the hour long baking.  I always use Fresh Spinach, but beware of overloading the heaping fresh spinach in the pie plate, it makes it tricky to pour the egg mixture of the top, but it is worth it!  You may have to seal the foil down around the pie plate to press it down, the spinach will wilt down and cook beautifully.  IMPORTANT NOTE, put a piece of Parchment Paper inbetween the Foil and the Quiche, to prevent Sticking and getting that icky brown discoloration from the Foil on the quiche.

Today I topped it with about 1/4 cup of pre-cooked bacon crumbles.  YUM!

Wonderful! My hubby almost balked at the mayonnaise, but I assured him it would be an asset. The crust was a bit moist (my fault... didn't get the spinach dry enough), and we sliced the onion, rather than chop. Next time, we'll add some sliced mushrooms and garlic.

This quiche came out fabulous and was a big hit at Christmas. I skipped the onion and just added a little onion powder in for flavor. I definitely did NOT use a whole package of spinach either - about half the package was more than enough. It turned out great and was even better for breakfast!

This recipe was so easy and tasted great.  I used 1¾ cup chopped fresh spinach in place of the of the frozen spinach and added ¼ cup of ham, cubed (preheated to cook off some of the water).  The quiche is very light and fluffy, which my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed but was not to the liking of our kids, they would have preferred a more solid texture.

Delicious! I reduced the mayo since I just didn't have enough for my double batch. Probably had about 1/3 cup, then filled the rest of the way with milk. Added some seasoned salt/pepper too. Made one with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, spinach and asiago, and a plain co-jack version for the picky eaters. Both got rave reviews! Think post-Thanksgiving brunch will have to be a new tradition now!

this was so easy to make and it taste so good! I did use 5 eggs and added salt,pepper and garlic powder to taste. I follwed the directions exactly. This is going to be a regular meal for my family. I served at a brunch with a side of fresh fruit.

To be fair, I never had Quiche before, but I thought I would like it. Unfortunately, I didn't. It was just gross, and the mayo never dissolved completely.

Instead of spinach, I chopped 1 cluster of broccoli, 1/2 a red pepper, 1/4 yellow onion, 6 pieces of turkey bacon (cooked, then chopped and placed in pie pan), and sprinkled mozzarella cheese along with some sharp cheddar. Then I poured the egg mixture (with mayo & milk) on top. I also used 5 eggs instead of 4. Baked for 45 covered...took cover off for last 15 min. Its delish!!

I hadn't had a quiche in so long!  This was a great one.  I sauteed my onions and added some chopped deli turkey and cooked until it started to brown.  I added this to the egg and cheese mix and used this as a breakfast quiche.

My mayo got all clumpy, so I ended up just pouring the egg/milk mixture through a sieve and filtered out the little bits of mayo. But still, it was delicious!  I only had an 8-inch pan, skipped the crust, and sauteed the onion with the spinach (I used a little less, around 6-ounces) and didn't layer. I still used 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk and I didn't get any extra.

Surprisingly easy, even for my first-ever quiche! I changed it a bit based on the other reviews as well. Used 1/3 cup mayo, 6 eggs, (filled 2, 9 in. crusts perfectly) only 6 oz. of spinach, and added a little sauteed garlic and tomato/basil feta as well. I found it didn't take quite as long to bake, only around 55 min. total, as it "cooked" a bit after I took it out of the oven as well. Absolutely delicious!  Took them to a party and we ate them up happily!

Quick, easy, and good.  I added some bacon.  Also, I didn't layer the ingredients.  I was in a hurry, so I just mixed everything together.  Came out great.

This is by far the best quiche that I've ever made.  Very easy to cook.  I have made it a few times for my friends and have gotten a lot of compliments.  I used 5 eggs instead of sick and added more milk.

DELICOUS! I make it without a crust sometimes and it is just as good. Even my 10 month old baby gobbles it down.  I do saute the onions and garlic.

wow, wow, wow! So super yummy.  half family can't have cheese so i omitted it from the interior of the quiche and sprinkled it on half and it totally rocked!  I think the mayo made the recipe - I have used another quiche recipe from a food network star and this one blew that one out of the water.

Did as suggested in the other reviews - reduced mayo, added a little salt, pepper and fresh basil for seasoning, added sundried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Excellent!  Thank you!

I used sauteed spinach/shallots instead of frozen spinach and onions. Also used 4 oz of feta and 4 oz of shredded medium cheddar cheese. It was excellent and i'll definitely make it again.

The only ingredients I followed exactly were the mayo, milk and eggs.  I modified everything else by adding additional ingredients (bacon, mushrooms).  Great taste.  Not too heavy.  Even though the pie was baked through after 45 min when I cut into the quiche I noticed the bottom of my crust was not :(   Although I'm not sure how it would work, I may pre-bake my crust for a bit before adding the egg mixture next time I make it.

This was great!  I made it for my in-laws, and my father-in-law, who hates quiche, thought this was amazing.  The only changes I made were to add an extra egg, saute the onions before adding to the batter, and I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the egg mixture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Based on other reviewers, I added one more egg and sauteed the onion and spinach with garlic in butter.  I do agree that it is to much spinach as others have said.  I used a deep dish pie plate and there was plenty of room to hold it.  I thought it was pretty good but not sure I'll make it again.

What a hit!!! Made two for a mother's day brunch. One with spinach, mushrooms and onions and the other with broccoli and cheese. Much like other reviewers, I suggest sauting the veggies prior to adding to pie shells. I replaced the mayo with plain yogurt. Made it so fully and moist. This was my first time making a quiche - couldn't have been easier! Thanks for sharing!

This dish is a favourite at my house and my go-to for potlucks. As others suggest, I use 5 eggs. I also sautee whatever fresh veggies I have on hand (usually peppers, mushrooms, etc) with the onion and spinach, and I add some fresh garlic. This fills two pie shells for me every time. I've also tried a few different cheeses and swapped in and out veggies for varied flavours. The quiche is truly delicious topped with a bit of feta.

I have made this recipie at least a dozen times. I leave it as is or tweek it and its always great. Dont forget to mix the mayo and milk until smooth before adding your eggs or else it wont mix nice. Try it with broccli and provolone its super good.

I made a few variations...Saute the onion with about 6 slices of pre-cooked bacon, added a little salt and pepper.  Added a handful of chopped tomato, used monterey jack instead of cheddar and only used about half of the box of spinach.  It was Delicious!!!! My fiance who went to culinary school was even impressed and we agreed it came out better than his quiche ever has:) With my variations, I give it 5 stars!!! Very easy to make.  Also, I only used 4 eggs and it made one deep dish 9" pie.  Yummy!!!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!! This was an excellent spinach quiche with some really great flavors.  I used a whole wheat crust that I made and it was delicious.  I took the advice of others and reduced the mayo to 1/3c. and added one more egg (to make 5 eggs total).  I also reduced the cheese to 5oz. and added 3 tablespoons of shredded parmesan, which gave it a nice rich flavor.  I sauteed the spinach with the onion and added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  This will definitely be a popular dish in my house for years to come.

Great recipe!! i think that if you use the amount of spinach called for you will have to fill 2 pie shells. I made this with the butter flaky pie crust from this site. I used about 1 cup sauteed spinach with mushrooms and the onion.. (about 2 cups fresh spinach).. since my brothers dont like spinach I prefered this amount. I used 4 large eggs, 6 tablespoons mayo and 1/2 cup milk.. i think that if its watery for you its not about the amount of eggs, its how long you baked it. it has to be baked the full amount of time called for. I used half cheddar/ half mozarrella but I think it would be great with only cheddar. I also added a pinch of salt to the sauteed spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper to the eggs. I think that if you like spinach, you could use the amount called for.. all the changes I made were because of personal taste, but i think this would be great as written

This has quickly become a favorite in our household.  I have made it with and without the mayonnaise and it turns out wonderfully every time.  The mayo gives it a fluffy texture that is unique and very tasty!

This quiche was amazing! I brought it to a potluck and it was the most popular dish! I made quite a few changes though...I added shredded mozzarella/cheddar, ricotta cheese, light cream instead of mayo, garlic, arugula, roasted red pepper, carmelized onion, olive oil, fresh basil, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, and salt/pepper

Made this last year for a Christmas brunch and I thought it was great! Definitely get all the water out of the spinach (maybe a salad spinner?).  I'm looking for an excuse to make it again...

I used 2 boxes of frozen spinach and substituted low-fat cottage cheese for the mayonaisse. I also used mozarella cheese in place of the cheddar. I poured the quiche filling into a pre-baked "oil pie crust" from this website. UPDATE - I made this again - This time i left out the mayo and used more skim milk (1 cup altogether). I cut low carb wraps into 4 pieces and pressed it into muffin tins. I filled it with this quiche mixture and baked for about 20-25 minutes. I sprinkles some shredded cheese on the top during the last 2 minutes of baking so that it would be bubbly and not burned. Very good!

Delicious. This is what I changed/added...1 more egg. Sauteed chopped onions & chopped scallions & minced garlic. Less spinach, added canned mushrooms. Everything else was as the original recipe indicated. Definately worth making.

I use this as a base and add whatever vegetables I have on hand in frozen bags.  I just steam them up a bit and use in place of the spinach.  Yummy!  One of our favorites!

Wow.  The best quiche ever.  Very simple too.  I substituted some feta cheese for part of the cheddar and it added some extra zing.  I will definitely make this one again.

Excellent recipe. I've made this twice already.  I changed a few things as suggested by the other members. I sauteed the onions first and put in 5 eggs instead of 4.  I also decreased the amount of frozen spinach by 1/2. I used marble cheese. I think next time I will use a deep dish pie crust because it was quite full after putting everything in. 
Yummy.

Definitely the best quiche I've made so far. I used 1/2 a package of spinach (I think a full package would be waaay too much), sour cream instead of milk, added an extra egg, and I sauteed the onions and the spinach. I used a ready-made Pillsbury pie crust rolled into my deep-dish pie plate. I'm going to make it again using broccoli, and possibly add some more seasonings. A good base recipe!

I made this for my bridal party luncheon along with two other quiches from this site (Tomato & Basil Quiche and Quick Crab Quiche) and this was everyone's favorite. I followed the directions exactly as written and it came out very light and fluffy. The only thing I would change for next time is to saute/soften the onion.

This was absolutely delicious!  It was easy to prepare, and turned out beautifully as well.  It was so good that my husband said he'd even ask for it again, which is the highest compliment he'll give food! This also dispels the myth that "real men don't eat quiche", because he sure enjoyed it!  It was great leftover and re-heated in the microwave also.  He liked it with a little dab of hot sauce, so next time I might add a bit to it before baking, but other than that it was perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! I used canned spinach (what I had on hand), doubled the onion, added some herbs, and used slightly less shredded cheese (fom a 4-cheese mixture). I cooked it the day before, and the next morning topped with remaining cheese to re-heat. Because some guests were vegetarian and some not, on the side I served crumbled bacon, sour cream, and hot sauce to add as guests pleased. Everyone raved! Thanks!!

I love this!  This is the best quiche I have ever had.  I made the mini tarts instead of one big one and took them to a appetizer/potluck.  I just reduced the cooking time and watched them.  Everyone loved them, even the ones that didn't think they liked spinach.

Really light and fluffy like the title. However, there was too much filling and it overfilled. Not sure how to improve on this.

This quiche was simple, easy, and tasty!  I used 1/2 mozzerella and 1/2 swiss.  I didn't cook the onions first on the stove, but probably will next time.  The first time I made quiche it didn't set when I followed the recipe, but this recipe was perfect.  I followed it and everything turned out exactly right!

There was only one thing wrong with this recipe....  It was too good and I ate too much!  :)~

I also added one extra egg, and I was really pleased with this easy-to-make (but doesn't taste that way!) quiche.  Thanks for sharing!

As named, this quiche is light, fluffy and delicious!  For such a nice taste, this was incredibly easy to make.  I, too, used a deep dish pie crust, sauteed the onions first, and added a touch of pepper, parmesan cheese (2 tsp), and garlic.  One previous reviewer questioned why all the ingredients couldn't be mixed together.  I mixed the onions in with the spinach-egg mixture, and layered the heavy ingredients on the bottom (cheese, m'shrooms, meat, etc.), so they wouldn't weigh down the quiche mixture; keeping it light and fluffly.  A+++ Kristin!

I've made this recipe twice, once with cheddar cheese- as the recipe suggests- and once with Sargento's mozzarella & asiago with roasted garlic blend, and personally I preferred the mozzarella blend.  But it's a great quick and easy recipe.  I also added mushrooms and loved it.

This quiche is lovely, but next time I would exclude the mayo because it gave the quiche a really weird sweet flavour.  I didn't have spinach so I used mushrooms, green capsicum and fried ham.  Ten minutes before it finished in the oven, I sprinkled grated cheese and Kraft grated parmesan over the top.
It turned out perfect, but like I say.  No Mayo.

Dare I say, better than Mom's! :-) Anyhow, the recipe is great. Followed it (almost) exactly, but sauteed the onions- thankfully- added packaged bacon bits, and used 4 oz. feta and 2 oz. cheddar. TIP: use a DEEP DISH pie crust (if you buy from the store, like me- I hate baking). Excellent recipe. Use whatever you have on hand, it'll be great!

I made this quiche last weekend for brunch. I used low-fat mayo, a little less cheese, and more onion. I also added some bacon-flavored bits. It was delicious. I cut the leftovers into slices and froze them. This quiche freezes beautifully- I've taken out two pieces so far, microwaved them to defrost, then reheated in the oven. You would NEVER know they're leftovers! Thanks for this recipe-

I actually made a few changes to this recipe, but the basic idea of this recipe is great.  Just the fact that it is so easy to make changes makes the recipe a great one.  I subed a cup of cottage cheese for the mayo & milk.  You could also sub a cup of plain yogurt.  I used swiss cheese instead of cheddar and I also sauteed the onions.  I just mixed everything together and poured it in the pie shell.  WONDERFUL!  I also reccomend baking your pieshell, wrapped in foil, for 5 minutes and then with the foil off for 5 more minutes at about 350 unitl it is very light brown.  I found that the quiche took about 30 minutes, maybe because of my modification.  Make sure to really squeeze out the spinach or the water will come out in baking.  Worth adding to your favorites.

This was my first attempt at making quiche, and it turned out great! I am in agreement with the others who said it needed salt, but other than that minor detail it was very tasty. My daughter even asked me where I bought it, since I "couldn't have made something that tastes this good" Thanks Kristin for this easy family pleaser!

I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the egg mixture, it turned out excellent!  Very attractive, too.  I will definitely make this again, and won't hesitate to make it for company.  Thank you, Kristin!

Great recipe. Be sure to tent foil loosely over quiche because it expands and foil will stick right to it, crust and all. I followed the recipe exactly but next time would add a little pepper.  I definitely will make it again!

It is not easy to squeeze out all the moisture from the spinach.

What i suggest (& i do it for other  spinach recipes too) is to squeeze out as much liquid as i can, then throw in a pan (on top of the stove top)  & over medium heat, & evaporate the excess moister out of the spinach. (stirring often)
Let cool before adding to recipe.
This helps to not add un-needed moister to the recipe.

BYW KRISTINJONI,
excellent recipe... would not change anything

This dish earned me some real appreciation from my wife when I made it! I made a few adjustments... added an extra egg, used 5oz of fresh chopped spinach instead of 10oz frozen, and sauteed it with a clove of minced garlic and the finely chopped onion. I used 4oz of sharp cheddar plus 5oz of crumbled feta in the filling. At 45 minutes, after removing the foil, I added another 1 oz of shredded cheddar on top. No need to add salt given the salty cheeses. With a scratch butter-based crust it was fantastic!

Easy and healthier than most quiches - I baked the crust in the oven for a little bit first, and I just put everything inside without layering it. I also added a little salt. Perfect. The only downside is having to wait for an hour to eat it!

This was an excellent recipe.  Very impressed!  Had never heard of a quiche made with mayo.  After reading several reviews, I used a little butter and sautéed 2 cloves crushed garlic, onion, 1/2 chopped red pepper and 3-4 ounces of chopped fresh spinach.  I used one additional egg and a mixture of 1/2 crumbled feta and 1/2 shredded cheddar.  Added black pepper only, did not require any salt.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe, will make again and again!

This is my go-to quiche recipe and I have been using it for several years now. Do not feel like you need to follow the recipe exactly! Add whatever vegetables or protein you would like. It is VERY important to follow the directions on preparing the pan by lining with foil, your crust will be perfect and crunchy and never soggy. I fixed this for my boyfriend recently and he said it was the best quiche he has ever tasted, and then hurried to beg me not to tell his mother he said that!! The mayonnaise may be swapped out with plain greek yogurt and the flavor and texture is still wonderful. I would recommend avoiding high-moisture vegetables like tomatoes and mushrooms because my experience with those hasn't been as good as with other veggie selections. YUM.

This is the easiest and one of the tastiest quiche recipes I've found. And I make a lot of quiches! I was skeptical at first about adding the mayo but it made the quiche especially creamy and tasty.  One reviewer mentioned that the recipe calls for too much spinach and she's right.  I used about 1/2 the recommended spinach, added some green onions and finely chopped red bell pepper.  I've also made this with asparagus (chopped into 1/2 inch pieces), broccoli floretts and chopped zuchini (also in small bits).  I've made this recipe about a dozen times, comes out perfectly every time.  The other thing I do is use a silicon crust protector (foil works) and remove it for the last 15 minutes of baking.

Great when served with a few slices of tomatoes. Used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust (baked shell 10 mins prior to filling) and it worked out perfectly.

Basically I liked the recipe.  Ideal for a brunch or late breakfast. It contains mostly healthy ingredients and is relatively easy to prepare.  As other reviewers have done, I may tweak the ingredients with my next attempt.  I will use maybe 2/3 of the spinach and mix it into the milk and egg mixture so that it will be more evenly distributed.  It was clumpy and hard to layer evenly in my first quiche.  I will add a little more cheese, since that flavor wasn't as prominent as I would have liked.

I doubled the recipe to make two quiches from this recipe.  The layering didn't sound good to me.  So, I reduced the mayo to 2/3 for the two quiches and used 10 eggs, mixed all of the ingredients together and added pepper.  Then, put the mixture in the two 9 inch pie crusts.  Perfection.

Replaced mayo with buttermilk. Used fresh spinach sautéed with spring onion in olive oil rather than frozen spinach.  Used my own crust recipe. It was scrumptious! We loved this recipe. Will use it again and add asiago cheese and tomatoes .

Wonderful quiche.  My husband LOVES spinach but commented that he thought there was too much in this dish. It overpowered the other flavors.  I used the 9 oz. frozen Green Giant package.  Next time I'll reduce the spinach by half.

This quiche is delightfully light and fluffy.  I made it in a 9-inch deep dish pie shell, added an extra jumbo egg, substituted light sour cream for most of the mayonnaise, and chopped a whole medium onion and sautéed it with a clove of minced garlic.  I thought it needed a bit of seasoning, so to the spinach/onion/garlic mixture (I mixed them all), I added 1/2 tsp. of dried dill weed, 1/4 tsp. of dried oregano and a pinch each of kosher salt and cayenne pepper.  Because I increased the volume of the pie, I needed to bake it about 15 minutes longer.

I saw this recipe and just had to try it.  Only problem was, I didn't have the right cheese.  Bottom line I followed this recipe to the letter but had to use half Swiss and half Mozzarella cheese.  I will make this again using the cheese in this recipe.  

In any event...I had to come here and say....It's marvelous. Such an easy, beautiful looking, delightful tasting quiche that will have me adding quiche to our recipe rotation.  Thank you Kris

This quiche turned out great, I made it on Christmas morning. I put the empty pie crust in the oven for 20mins and it turned out perfectly in the end. I also followed another user's suggestion and replaced the mayo with plain yogurt. The mayo idea just grossed me out! I added an extra egg & also added some American cheese in addition to the cheddar. It would be very easy to add other veggies or meat if desired. Yummy, simple recipe. It was a hit!

My first time at making quiche and it was excellent! The recipe is forgiving and you can add all kinds of things. The next time I gave the onions a light sauté with garlic and added salt and pepper. It's great with Swiss and bacon, too!

I use this quiche recipe, with a few changes, as my first-ever quiche from scratch.... wow!
Added an extra egg to make 5, used both onion and garlic, chopped, and added sun-dried tomatoes to the spinach, all of which I sauteed over medium heat. Finally, added feta to the cheddar cheese mix to enhance the consistency, flavor, and appearance. Oh, yes... forget the salt... there's enough flavor from the cheeses to suffice. I used a 10-inch deep dish for baking which held the additional ingredients without the appearance of over filling. I served this recipe for an after-church brunch on Easter Sunday... it was a great hit with everyone!

Success! The hubs and the 16 yo daughter both loved it. Made it according to the recipe although I mixed it all together rather than layering.

This is my go-to quiche recipe. I tried a few to find one that gets consistently good reviews at events, and this is it!  Only thing I adjust is that I steam fresh spinach and chop it. I HATE the texture and stringiness of frozen spinach. I also always make 2 at a time since the crust generally comes in a 2-pack. Just freeze one for use at another time!

Very good basic quiche recipe. Great for adding too. Must include salt and pepper. I added mushrooms and ham and it was great.

Loved this!!!! I followed previous suggestions of only 1/3 c mayo and also substitute egg whites for two of the eggs (so 4 egg whites and two eggs). The result was awesome!!!!

So yummy! I made 2 quiches. I used 5 egg whites and 5 eggs. I split the amt of spinach ad cheese listed above between the 2 quiches. Also used skim milk. Turned out great! Delish!

Really good. I just cut in half the mayonese. I used swiss chard instead of spinach because that is what I grow in my garden. Also, I saute the onion. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe and I will have to agree with some of the other reviews. There was too much spinach. Using 1/2 the amount like Mjhutch suggested seems like a proper amount. Other than that, this recipe was okay.

This was my first quiche and I have made it four times now. Love others' suggestions to sub half feta cheese - gives it more texture and a richer flavor profile... and I normally can't stand feta! I also sub mostly egg beaters + 1 regular egg to lower cholesterol a bit. And fat free Greek yogurt instead of mayo.

Also tried adding other ingredients (sun dried tomatoes, ham chunks, chopped broccoli). It all seems to work out, so this is a great base recipe for quiche. :-)

I tweaked the receipe to add more veggies and reduce one egg(3). Came out really nice. I added aspagrus, bell peppers, onion and mushroom. My fussy eaters also ate it and it was a hit!

Very good.  Tried other reviewers' suggestions and added an extra egg (egg beaters), two cloves of garlic, and nonfat plain yogurt instead of mayo.  People went back for seconds!

I like this recipe a lot, but can't give it 5 stars because of the amount I change to get it just right.  If it was just the veggie and cheese choice (basic taste substitution), fine, but I really feel like this NEEDS that extra egg.  Otherwise, it's a great recipe that's turned out wonderfully on plenty of occasions.  As others have also suggested, the onion should be sauteed, which I generally do if chopped onion is called for in a recipe regardless.  Also, I use a deep-dish pie crust, which I've also seen others mention with this recipe.

My personal favorite for veggies and cheese in this is mushroom and swiss (with the mushrooms sauteed with the onion and some soy sauce and sake), but my wife made it with mixed veggies and mozzarella one time and that was really good, too!

Very tastey!  I added a little crushed garlic and fresh mushrooms.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I used Mexican 4 Cheese.  The extra ingredients make a deep dish pie pan a must. This has quickly become a family favorite.

Fabulous! I've made this several times now.  I've never had a quiche come out right until now. Minor changes for us were no onions, sour cream in place of mayo a few times, added ham and used deep dish shells. Adjusted the cooking time bit. This is on our regular menus options. Even put my sister onto it.

I, like others, tweaked the recipe a bit. Substituted the mayo with fat-free Greek yogurt and used red onion as it's what I had on hand. Added salt, pepper and garlic powder, to taste. In addition, I saved a bit of the cheese to sprinkle over the top of quiche for the last 15 minutes of baking. Was super easy!

Very good. My husband had 3 servings at least! I also only used 1/3 cup light mayo and added an additional egg. I used fresh chopped spinach. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped red and yellow bell pepper each. And about 1/4 cup chopped deli ham. I was a bit worried that it was over cooked when I took it out of the oven because the top looked darker than I expected, but it was perfect. the texture and flavor was excellent.

This was wonderful.  Very light and fluffy, just like the name says.  I added ham and only used 1/2 the box of frozen spinach and it was perfect.  Next time I think I will also add mushrooms.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

The spinach was a little over powering. Next time I will use half the spinach called for in the recipe. Otherwise it was very good.

I followed other advice and added less milk and mayo and more eggs.  I think you can add any ingredient to make this great.  I used roasted red pepper, smoked mozz. and mushrooms.... yummy!

This is delicious. I used fresh spinach that I sauted with some onions and garlic. I added some bacon and a can of mushrooms. I used a mix of real eggs and beaters and left out the mayo. YUM!!

Sauteed mushrooms with the onion and made a layer at the bottom.  Made 2 one with Spinach and one with frozen broccoli.  The broccoli was better.  Next time I  think I will mix the broccoli with the egg mixture rather than pouring it on top

Very good and easy to make! I added 3 cloves of garlic, paprika, salt, an additional egg and mushrooms. I also sauteed all the veggies first because I didn't want any added liquid. I used regular sized (not deep dish) pie crusts and it was ther perfect amount for two of them. Yummy! I'll make this one again.

Our 1st quiche. So easy, and you can mix and match what you put in for something different every time. We made it exactly as is 1st time and it was delicious. We've chaged it up some since & it's always a hit. You can even make it & freeze for later.

Great! I added the 5th egg just in case reviews were correct, but that is all I did differently.  It came out beautiful.  My husband didn't know he liked quiche until this recipe.  With a vegetarian daughter, I am always trying to find something that appeals to all.  Very good!

Recipe is fluffy indeed! Overall is a good balance of egg, onion, cheese and spinach. As previous guests suggested, I added an egg and substituted the half cup of mayo with plain yogurt. Because I lacked the appropriate cheese and someone had mentioned using another kind of cheese to help with texture, I used 1/4 cottage cheese, 1/4 parmesan, 1/4 mexican, and 1/4 mozerella - sounds a little crazy, I know, but I didn't really want any one strong cheese flavor. I think it worked! I also sauteed my onions prior to mixing with spinach to let them "sweat" a little - hoping to make them a little sweeter and a little less potent. I guess I made a lot of changes, but this is my favorite quiche recipe I've tried so far. Great flavor!

This recipe was delicious & easy! I used fresh spin & sauted it in butter with red onion. For the cheese I used a combination of mozzarella, parmesan & asiago. I think sauteing mushrooms with the spin & onion would be a good addition. Everyone in our group LOVED it!

I get a lot of compliments on this quiche.  I double the recipe and make two pie shells.  This helps it not be too full of spinach.  I also use less mayo.

Turned out very well. I added about 1/2 a cup more cheese and then topped it with some extra since it seemed like way too much spinach. I also added chopped red pepper. Next time I will reduce the spinach by almost half and keep the rest of the ingredients as listed here (apart from cheese topping & red peppers). Very good, and even my son who does not like eggs loves this! Excellent base recipe.

This recipe is fantastic. It is less expensive to make than many others.  I chose to use sour cream instead of milk and used both cheddar and swiss cheese.

Not bad, but not great either. Seemed to be missing something; lacks a bit flavor and saltiness. Maybe more cheese or throwing in some ham or bacon would help?

I used a whole wheat crust recipe, fat free mayo, egg substitute, and reduced fat colby/cheddar.  Then I baked it with all the ingredients mixed together (not layered) and poured into the unbaked pie crust.  Yummy and easy!

Very good recipe!  My husband and I made this together.  I made the pie crust while he prepared the "insides".  We didn't have quite enough cheddar so we added a soft garlic and herb cheese that we had.  We also added blue cheese and bacon.  It was delicious!

This is the easiest quiche recipe I have come across. Not only was it quick and easy but it was absolutely amazing. Everything went together so well, especially the spinach, onions and cheddar cheese. Next time I will use the same basic recipe, but perhaps vary it with different vegetables and cheeses. Overall, amazing!

This was just ok.  I didn't put as much cheese as the recipe called for because it seemed like a lot.  I added an extra egg the the recipe as well.  The quiche was a little bland but not bad.... just not great.

This was the first quiche I have ever attempted.  I brought it to a brunch baby shower and the girls loved it!  I added a small can of mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and about 1 clove of garlic.  I only used 1/4 mayo.  
This would also be good with some ham or sausage - you could really play around with it to your taste.  Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it was pretty basic taste wise, but still very yummy.

This had a great taste and consitence.  I added minced garlic, sea salt, some sliced ham, for the cheese I used half mozzarella and half shredded blend of cheddar with monteray jack along with parmesan cheese and a little basil.  I placed bread crumbs on the top. I will definetley make this again.

We had a four-generation Mother's Day brunch, and everyone raved about this quiche.  I used an extra egg, only 3/4 of the spinach and some green onions. I also used a deep dish pie plate.  It was deeeee-lish!

This dish was a hit at breakfast today.  I doubled the eggs, used asparagus and german sausages, and instead of a pie crust I poured the ingredients on top of a layer of cooked hash browns in a 13x9 pan. All I can say is YUM!
Thank you Kristin for a great recipe, will definetely use again.

A very tasty and flexible recipe. My proportions were all off because I read the "add an egg" and "makes too much for one quiche" hints. Also ran out of milk, so I used a water/mayo/egg mixture instead. I added broccoli along with spinach, and used a cheddar/swiss mix for the cheese.

Be sure to season it a bit - a few dashes of salt plus another basic spice (I used black pepper) brings out the flavors nicely. This probably also counterbalances any sweetness from the mayo.

My parents both enjoyed this a lot (Dad even took two slices, and he's not a quiche fan!). I'll definitely make this again, likely with a whole new set of measurements...and it'll probably come out great too.

I used fresh spinach which I wilted first. I made a mistake and instead of combining the milk and mayo and then adding the eggs I put them all in together which meant I had lumps of mayo. This disappeared after cooking though. My guests enjoyed this. Thankyou.

This was a great quiche. My husband who normally hates quiches actually enjoyed this one, so I will definitly be doing this one again! I think I'll add some bacon or ham next time just to add a little more meatiness to it and I'll make my own crust. Store bought unbaked crusts just aren't very good to me. Thanks for this delicions recipe.

Ok, my plan was to make another quiche, and I had to do a quick save since I
already thawed the spinach. This quiche was so delicious that I gave one to my Mother and made another for my house.  I made a couple of changes,(like others of you) I sauteed the onion, and then added crushed pepper flakes.  I love to cook and I couldn't be happier with this recipe.   This ia a keeper!

Sorry, didn't think this recipe was any better than my usual quiche which doesn't call for mayo nor covering the quiche with foil.  I didn't really like the consistency of the filling which was basically steamed eggs.  I added mushrooms sauteed in butter, raw green onions, salt, pepper, dash of nutmeg and a sprinkling of paprika.  My standard spinach quiche calls for a slightly pre-baked shell and baked uncovered at 350 degrees F for about an hour.  For me at least, this has resulted in a better quiche.

Very nice Kristin! I used asiago cheese and made this into an appetizer by cutting small rounds of pie pastry and placing into my mini muffin pan. Never thought of using mayo but now that many of us know about Bills scrambled eggs on this site, I'm no longer surprised! During the last few minutes of baking, I topped the quiche's with some shredded cheese. Very delicious and thanks so much!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I made some variations as far as the vegetables to suit my tastes and added an extra egg to balance it out.  (I learned that the more veggies that were added the longer it took to cook and it made it a little dryer by the time it was set in the middle.)

Excellent!  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe for the crust, and added 1/2  pound mushrooms (sautéed with the onion in 1 Tbsp margarine).  I also used fat-free mayo.  To make it perfect, I substituted sharp cheddar for the reduced-fat cheddar, substituted red onion for regular onion, and added a little parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp powdered garlic, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1 tsp of dill weed and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  Remember that the center of the quiche should still be a little bit soft when you take it out!

I what a wonderful light dinner!  My 6 year old promised to taste spinach for the first time.  He loved it!  I anxiously awaited my husband's arrival home.  I was so proud of how beautiful it looked, I refused to cut into it before he got home.  I realized too late when I went back on line to see serve-with ideas for the next time we make the quiche--I could have taken and submitted a photo for all to see how great it looks!

this was really good for my first time preparing quiche. I didnt have an onion on hand (go figure) so i sprinkled a bit of onion powder to the layers of spinach and cheese.  I also added cheddar and swiss cheese for additional flavor.  I am definitely going to prepare this for me and my fiance again. I only did one because i was unsure of the outcome but in the future I will definitely prepare two (as it was great for dinner with a salad, and even better for breakfast).  Next time I will probably try adding some chicken breast for a delicious chicken, cheddar, swiss & spinach quiche!

Update:  Still making this recipe regularly with great results.  I've tried it a few times with egg substitute and it works fine.  Delicious!

This is the first Quiche I have ever attempted on my own.  It was so easy, so delicious... I made it twice in the same weekend.  First time by the recipe with a little extra cook time added, the second time I threw in mushrooms and pepperoni for a divine dinner. (And my mother-in-law thought I'd been making them for years.) Thank you so much!

Delicious!  A new classic in my home. So so so fabulous.  I added 2 oz feta cheese, and a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms, and made my own crust.

I'd never made quiche before and always wanted too.  This was super easy and very tasty.  I was so worried that I didn't have enough spinach, and that I didn't dry it enough, but everything turned out great!  I'd definitely use this recipe as a starter to any kind of quiche I'll make from now on.

This quiche is fabulous! I used fresh baby spinach and it was perfect. It also slices beautifully. I will definitely add this one to my recipe file.

This quiche is excellent and very easy to make.  To give it additional flavor I added bacon bits to it and placed sliced tomatoes on top.  I received a lot of compliments when I made this

I used about a half of a bag of fresh baby spinach. (no weird moisture problems) Delicious!  I also used jack cheese instead of cheddar. Turned out beautifully.

Be certain to squeeze the spinach well, or there will be fluid on the bottom of the pie.  I would prefer just one more egg to make it more quiche like. I wouldnt describe it as fluffy or light.  Dense and rich are more appropriate.

I used 3 eggs and 1/2 pkg of frozen chopped spinach as my 9" pie plate didn't appear to be deep enough.  Nice idea to put foil on cookie sheet - no mess (just a couple of drips). The Quiche set well and presentation was wonderful with a golden crust.  My husband said "it's the best".  Thanks Kristen.

The quiche was a hit. I made it for friends who just had a baby. I did use heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and added 1/2 tea. salt and chopped tomatos. I also topped it off with tomato slices.

I liked this more than my husband did.  I made it crustless and used a ten inch pie dish.  It didn't stick even though I didn't bother to use any cooking spray on it.  I also sauteed the onion in a little olive oil first and added 1/2 a teaspoon of salt to the recipe as some reviewers had recommended.  I think it was salty enough due to the cheese.  You may want to add just a sprinkle of salt.  I'm not sure why the recipe called for layering some of the ingredients, rather than just mixing everything together and pouring it into the pie dish.

So delicious! I used 1% milk & extra sharp cheddar. The cooking method was excellent: I baked using the exact specifications (did 15 minutes without the foil) and the quiche turned out perfectly. No matter the ingredients I use in the future, I'll use these baking specifications.

I make this All the time! I prepare it exactly per receipe. Well almost. I do change up the add- ins, such as onion, mushrooms, tomatoes.
Sometimes use Swiss cheese. The base receipe is solid! If you're thinking about making this, DO IT! you will not be disappointed.

I really like this recipe, but it does need two more eggs if you're using a prepared pie dough you put it in a regular pie pan, like I did, instead of the frozen pie crust. I also used fresh baby spinach I had on hand, reconstituted whole milk, a pinch of nutmeg (saw this in other spinach quiche recipes), and chopped cheddar cheese slices. I love spinach so it still wasn't too much spinach but it would've been perfect with two extra eggs! Very tasty indeed! I want to add bacon and other veggies next time.

I did a couple things differently.. I mixed the mayo, milk, 5 eggs, cheddar and a little feta all together. Sauteed fresh spinach, onion, garlic, mushrooms and diced tomatoes.  Mixed all together and then put into 2 pie crust. Bake as noted. Absolutely delicious!  Thank you

Really happy with how this came out. I used 5 eggs and added a carrot when I sauteed the onion to add color & another veggie. I thought the mayo would be weird but you don't notice it. This recipe made enough for two frozen pie crusts. One to give and one to keep. Yum!

This is so quick and easy to make especially for those late night dinners after a long day of work. Be sure to use a deep dish pie crust so the filling doesn't run over.

It wasn't quite as dense as I like my meatloaf, so it wasn't really sliceable, but the taste was stellar!  Second time I've made this and I love the addition of the carrots in this!

I loved this easy receipe.  Easy to make. Some slight changes:
1. Pre fry veg, baby leaf spinach, spring onions, onion, red peper, baby tomatoes, oegano seasoning , seasoned salt. let cool
2. pre make base: flour (sived), pork lard 1/4, butter 1/4, seasoned salt, praprika, rub together with 1/4 milk. make in a dough, cover with celephane.Fridge set for 20 mins.  Then after roll out to shape,  bake dough for 20 mins.
3. the egg mix (5 eggs serves 2 people), mix with mayo, cream cheese, whisk, then add grated cheese (add pepper to flavour).
4. add veg to base then pour over egg mix and cook for 35 mins medium oven temp.

Why do you call this quiche light and fluffy? It's not as dense as traditional quiche, but I've had awesome fluffy quiche and this recipe is no match. Tasted good though

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever made. So easy. I used fresh spinach though and used about half of what the recipe called for. Sauted it with the onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Delish!!!

It was sooooo yummy! The crust was slightly over cooked so maybe don’t cook it as long or cover with foil. We didn’t put mayonnaise in so we just added extra milk and one extra egg! Overall it was delicious!,

This is a keeper!  

I have been making quiche for a long time but was never happy with the denseness results.  I made this with fluffiness in mind and it was amazing!  

I used olive oil mayo (that was all I had) and 2% milk and 5 eggs.  

Because I didn't have any spinach, I used green chilies, sliced olives and tomatoes.   

Best I ever made!  Can't wait to invite some friends over for brunch!

I just wrote a two-star review on this - it's about 10 minutes later and I had to come back and go down to one star. Not only was the amount of spinach totally overwhelming, making this bitter and drowning out the other ingredients (I added small bits of ham but otherwise stuck to the recipe), but it also literally made me ill - and I like spinach!

That was delicious. I used fresh spinach which I chopped. I ended up needing less than 10 oz. I of course added salt and pepper to the egg mixture along with some dried herbs. But overall, I followed the recipe exactly and the result was phenomenal. This is a really easy recipe that I will do again.

This was very yummy.  I think I will add more cheese next time.  I used a 9.5 pie pan and added an extra egg and a bit more milk.  But I really like cheese and couldn't taste it much.

My family really enjoyed the quiche. It was easy and quick. I used a Marie Calendar's pie shell and that just added to the 
deliciousness of this recipe. I had some mushrooms on hand and decided to add them to the recipe. I have made this several times and every time it comes out great.

I used fresh spinach, sautéed with onion, butter, fresh garlic and a big tomato. Used 5 eggs and a cup of blend cream and some fresh thyme. Shredded Italiano cheese. Maple flavoured bacon. This recipe formed the basis of my quiche,  but I modified it a bit and it was delicious!

I have been making this for years and have converted many "I don't like quiche" people with it. I do always get 2 pies out of it because I DEFINITELY over do my veggies and cheese, I'll toss pretty much anything that sounds good in it. My son prefers bacon and cheddar whereas my daughter and I love some feta with the spinach. I have recently started a keto diet to help with some issues I'm having and using avocado mayo and no crust will be a perfect breakfast, lunch or anytime meal.

This is a great base quiche recipe. The mayo, milk, egg, and cheese ratio is perfect. I have made a variety of different quiches with this base (i.e. using: deli ham, cooked bacon, scallions, minced garlic, a can of small diced mushrooms drained, different mixed shredded cheese bags) and other fridge and pantry items in my home. I also added different dried and fresh herbs, depending on the flavor profile I wanted (i.e. chopped dill, Cajon seasoning, lemon pepper, Italian seasoning).

I doubled the amount of onion and also sautéed it in some butter to add a little more flavor. Also added some salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Delicious and very quick and easy to make. Served with salad greens with a lemon vinaigrette.

Came out amazing! I followed what the other reviewers said and sauted the spinach with the onions to remove the extra water. I did add a pinch of nutmeg as well. It really goes well with spinach. It was much appreciated!

Good dish. I added some Cayenne Pepper, garlic granules and onion powder for added flavor. Not much of a crust maker so I used a frozen one (or two actually). Added the extra egg and made both. The second one reheated from the cooked state easily at 325 for 30 minutes.

I have made this several times and love this quiche! I use frozen chopped onions to save time and I make a double batch when ever I make it and I like to add extra egg whites to the recipe because my pie dishes are so large. I also tend to add extra onion and spinach, if I have it. This is really excellent quiche. Easy to make and delicious!

I’ve used this recipe several times, always great, EXCEPT when I added broccoli—-that became dog food. Every other time it was fantastic, so must have been the broccoli. Turned me off so much that I had to make another to erase that memory!  Note to self: you don’t like broccoli in a quiche. I’ve always loved how you can put almost anything in a good quiche, and this is a really good quiche! The secret is the mayo (I always use the light mayo) that makes it extra Light and fluffy, even when reheated the next day. This time, I did my usual sautéed onions and mushrooms with bacon, using some swiss and cheddar cheese. The point of this review is the custard—that egg, mayo, milk combo is awesome!!! Gotta admit, I used 5 eggs, I like my pie crust really filled. But I kept the milk and mayo measurements the same. It was delicious!!! Thanks so much for that mayo tip—my quiches have been good but not as good as they are now—-restaurant quality, for sure! Keeper deluxe!

added leeks, onion, mushroom.  Cooked those in bacon grease and added bacon too.  Subbed milk for canned, unsweetened coconut milk for milk allergic family.  Skipped the cheese. fresh spinach not frozen. 
 Still rich and delicious.

This is an excellent and tasty recipe! I added the extra egg other reviewers recommended and that is the only change I made to the ingredients.  However,  I did use regular store bought pie crusts and I spread the ingredients out between the two to make two thinner quiches.  I think had I used one crust it would have needed to be a deep dish pie crust.  I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious.  I too added the extra egg.  I love cheese so extra cheese was added.  I used fresh spinach.  Sauted spinach with diced onion and garlic.  Saute the spinach until just wilted.

This is the only quiche that I have ever made that turned out actually light and fluffy as advertized.  Based on earlier reviews,I did add one extra egg to make it set up better.. I also used fresh spinach, which I sautéed along with the onions and I added some chopped, cooked bacon.  I had to let it cook 1:18 for it to get perfectly firm in the middle, but it turned out great!

Instead of layering the ingredients in the pie shell and then pouring the mix over it, I mixed it all together then poured it into the pie shell, and it turned out very well. Next time I will use a pie shell using regular flour mix rather one using gram cracker mix. The sweet taste didn't mix well with the spinach mix.

Today was the second time I have made this quiche. The first time I followed the directions to a T and my husband LOVED it. The second time I added some mushrooms and tomatoes. Still, so good! I will make this in a deep dish pie crust next time.

Just pulled it out of the oven and it is awesome. I chose to cook the crust first and it seemed to work well for me. I also added precooked mushrooms, bacon and chives. I’m just sorry I forgot to add fresh tomatoes from my garden.

I've  made this twice now, the first time I didn't cook the onions, the second time I did, much better.  I also used my cream cheese and butter crust recipe.  This really works great for quiche.  I have a couple of elderly neighbors and I often take them prepared food.  They just flipped over this one.  Makes me feel good when somebody else likes my cooking too.

I did not make any changes except I did not use low fat cheese. I used regular cheddar and it turned out wonderful. I only got 2 layers where it said to do several layers but it was very good.

I had to try this recipe based on all the glowing reviews and was not disapointed. I followed some recommendations of some reviewers and added some chopped garlic and mushrooms with fresh spinach which i sauteed, and 1 more egg. I also used half Cheddar and Feta cheese. I used a regular 9 inch pie plate and it filled it up perfectly and followed the recommended cooking times. My husband and I loved it. Will definitely make again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent. I made the recipe as written with the only addition of fried bacon cut into small pieces. Will definitely make this again.

I made the recipe as is and honestly it was very good. I don't think I would change anything. I will make this again and probably if having more time, I will make my homemade quiche crust. As is, it is fast and tasty. One thing though be careful with the baking time so it does not brown too much.

This is REALLY good...I did use 5 eggs as suggested several times, didn't have mayo of any kind so used reduced fat sour creme and some milk.  Mexican cheese is what was in my fridge.  I added a 4 oz. can (drained) mushrooms and liked the feel of them in the quiche.   I'd love to make it with leftover ham.  Bacon would be another good addition.

Just had skim milk, so I used half and half, dividing it with the milk I had.

Delicious !  Followed suggestions from other reviewers by decreasing mayo, adding 1 egg, sautéed fresh spinach with onion and garlic, added sun-dried tomatoes, and did half cheddar/ half feta.  Absolutely loved it!

Really good base recipe.  I had to add seasonings to my spinach.  I used a frozen onion, green and red bell pepper mix.  Other than those slight preference changes, it turned out really well.
A great way to get veggies in your diet.

This is an easy recipe and very delicious. I doubled the recipe and made two quiche. One I added bacon bits in addition to the ingredients given and the other I added cooked mushrooms. After reading another review, I too used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise. They were both delicious and my family loved them!

Great quiche, but the first time I made it, I forgot to cover it with foil before putting it in the oven, so I just did it during the last 15 minutes of cooking. This time, I put the foil on before cooking, and when I took it off as directed, some of the top of the quiche came off on the foil, spoiling the appearance. It was loosely  covered, and still stuck. Next time, I'll wait and do it during the last few minutes of cooking!

I added salt and pepper to the egg mixture before adding  it to the spinach, cheese and onion layers.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk because  I had some on hand in my fridge that I wanted to use up. I also substituted fresh chopped spinach for the frozen spinach.  It was delicious!

I used this recipe as the base for several varieties of quiche including one with sausage, one with broccoli, and I added mushrooms to the spinach one. They were all very well received at the shower I made them for and I was asked for the recipe several times. Told everyone about my favorite recipe website and where to find the quiche recipe I used.

This was so delicious and was devoured at the brunch I was at. The only thing I did differently was add 1 egg and omit the onions.  I suppose I also changed the cheese as I didn't have enough mild cheddar so I added monterey jack.

This is my favorite quiche recipe. I love how you can change up the veggies. Used half the spinach called for and used peas and broccoli to make up for the other half. Also added crisped bacon.  I love the mayo/ milk combo, but didn't have enough mayo this time so subbed with 1/4 cup greek yogurt and 1/4 cup ranch light ranch dressing added to the milk.  This is a fabulous recipe!

This was my first quiche and I made it exactly as the recipe stated, minus the onions because my family doesn't like them.  Even my pickiest eater liked it!  I can definitely see why other reviewers doctored the recipe - it could use some extra flavor so next time I will try different cheeses, etc. As is, this is a really good recipe and a great base for a quiche.

Great basic Quiche recipe.....very adaptable. I did pre-bake my store bought 9" deep dish  crust first. I find it keeps the crust from getting soggy. Added just a little dill, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Used the ingredients listed but used Swiss cheese, half the spinach, and some shredded smoke ham when layering. I topped with some sliced grape tomatoes and some grated Pecorino Romano. It looked wonderful and tasted great.

Totally AWESOME. I usually put in some leftover ham, but it's not necessary.  I use the regular frozen pie crusts (not the deep dish) and make two pies from this one recipe, because I'm cooking for two people. I freeze one. Very easy to pull together when you don't know what to have for dinner. I keep frozen spinach in stock just in case I need to make this!  I have also used fresh spinach, which I sauté a bit before adding to the pie.  I have not noticed a difference between frozen and fresh spinach.  Play around all you want with the filling, but follow the baking directions.  I hope lots of people try this. Thanks so much for this recipe it is perfect.

I've made this thing about a dozen times. Each time, I add something different like broccoli instead of spinach, maybe add some corn, or put in some kielbasa. And each and everytime, my friends go crazy over it. This is a recipe to be reckoned with!

Delicious! I've made this countless times when I've had an unexpected guest but nothing to serve them. It's super easy, and always comes out perfect! I add an extra egg and pour it into two pwhole grain crusts

i made a quiche because I had a frozen 10 0z. package of creamed spinach and 8 slices of cooked bacon which I crumbled.  as always, I used half and half for the liquid.   I always add nutmeg and pepper.  I used shredded swiss cheese  and put it all in a pre-baked Pillsbury crust.  Yummy !

I used a 16 oz package of spinach, and a bit more cheese.  It is fast and turned out really good both times.  All gone in a day and a half.

On my first go I made several adjustments I used one and a quarter cup of packed fresh spinach which is about 10 ounces I used 1/4 teaspoon of  minced garlic kept the onions the same and sauteed them all together And using a frozen crust I par baked the crust for 5 minutes so It wasn't raw and I also added about 1/4 teaspoon salt.

This is a great recipe and I have used it on three different occasions.  The mayonnaise makes the filling light and fluffy.  I tweaked the recipe, somewhat, and add swiss cheese, along with sharp cheddar.  Instead of using frozen spinach, I steam fresh spinach.

I used unsweetened Silk Almond Milk because that's what I had.  I had regular Kraft Mild cheddar cheese instead of the reduced fat type.  My husband and I both liked it very much. I will be making this several times in the future.

Love it! I used a little less mayo and an extra egg,  though it did not take all of the mix. I kind of eyeballed the spinach too, since i used fresh instead of frozen. Very easy and I'll definitely make is again!

Using 1 cup of egg whites with 1 cup milk and no mayo this turned out great!!!! I used low fat mozzarella cheese and left out the ham . I sautéed 5oz of fresh Spinach, onion, garlic, and baby Bella mushrooms. This total quiche is 1110 calories so only 137 calories a piece!!!! I enjoyed 2 great pieces for dinner!!!

I love that this is easily made with ingredients in my refrigerator and WITHOUT cream! I actually used broccoli instead of spinach and added ham. A deep dish crust was necessary! A squeeze of Dijon mustard was nice too.

Yum!
This was really good. Both my husband and I loved it. I followed others'  advice and used 1/3 cup of mayonnaise and an extra egg.   I baked it covered for 55 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes.

Made this recipe and turned out delish!!  I followed it as directed with a few tweaks.  I did not squeeze spinach dry...in a bowl I mixed the spinach, onion, and cheese and added about a quarter cup feta.  Added this to my milk/mayo mixture and sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder. Poured everything into pie shell.  Yes everything fit.  I recommend spraying the foil cover with Pam.  This was really delicious!!

This recipe was great!  So much so in fact, that I am making another one add I write this!  add usual,  I never follow a recipe to the "T" so here are my revisions,  additions to it.  

I used 6 others of shredded Colby/Jack cheese instead of just cheddar.  (2 oz.  less and the jack gives it a creamier flavor).
I replaced the frozen spinach with one package of creamed spinach, added 1 tsp. of minced garlic.  (this instantly turned it into a quiche Florentine) 

I also wished the eggs completely before adding it to the milk/mayo mixture. this gave it an even fluffier quiche.  

I cooked uncovered 20 minute afterwards for a more golden look.

Superb!  Cut the mayo(gf doesn't like it), added an extra egg(5 total), salt and pepper to egg mixture, boiled potato, then sauteed in butter with onion before adding in freshly chopped spinach. 45 min covered at 400 F and 15 uncovered - wham! Delicious.  Other reviews were helpful for this recipe.

This really is fabu!! I accidentally cooked it in a Keebler's  pie crust. Surprisingly, it added a slightly sweet kick which, of course, the teens were all over:) Quiche and soup for a quick dinner!

This quiche was fantastic. I took the advice of the other cooks and added an egg, and took the mayo down to 1/3 cup. Next time I make it I'm going to try it with low-fat yogurt and see how it goes. 
I used frozen spinach, but sauteed it with onion and a green bell pepper. It was great! I also substituted some of the cheddar for goat cheese. Will definitely be making this again!

A little bland. Next time, use less onions - maybe replace its shallots.  Maybe also add mushrooms or ham to build up the taste.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I thought there may have been a little too much spinach for my taste. The second time I substituted a small can (4.5 oz) of sliced mushrooms. I used about half of the can, finely chopped, during layering the dish. It turned out to be a great Vegetarian dish!

So easy to make! Aluminum foil was great--quiche was moist and after baking the last 15 minutes, it was a beautiful toasty brown dish coming out of the oven. 
Tasty and will make often.

This was my first time making a quiche and my friends raved about it. I did make my own crust but used all the other ingredients exactly as listed. I baked it for about 30 minutes and then another 10 as I had concerns about the cheese burning. It was perfect!!

This is a great base but needs some flavor.  I added garlic as many suggested, also used Herbes De Provence.. For the mix I also added a bit of chilli oil and salt to taste.
I served with a dollop of sour cream. Yum!

A simple recipe for a tasty dish. If I change anything the next time, it might be to cut back on the spinach, perhaps 7.5 ounces rather than 10. The recipe is such that a person can add other ingredients (such as bacon bits, etc.) to their liking. I like broccoli so I may substitute it for spinach.

This really was fluffy and well textured. I did cook the onions with bacon and garlic then mixed with spinach and also mixed cheese in with the egg mix.

This recipe was excellent as written. I did take the advice of another member and covered it for the first 45 minutes and then uncovered and baked an additional 15 minutes. This helped the pie set up nicely. It wasn't runny at all!

Loved it!  Easy to make too.  Reheats in microwave well.
Just have to wait 1 hour for it to cook.

Also followed many reviewers' advice & cut the mayo in half & added an egg.  Though why some thought that 10 oz of spinach  was too much surprises me: the amount of spinach--according to my family--was perfect!

I substituted the mayo for Philadelphia Cooking cream Italian Three Cheese flavor and added  thyme and rosemary and one more egg. I skipped the cheese part bc I didn't have any atm. Tastes really good this way. I made my own pie crust. Mine took a total of 1 hr and 15 min. I recommend it if you're in a rush and have veggies in your fridge. You won't be disappointed

Definitely a keeper. I added chopped spicy sausage and sautéed the onions first with some fresh mushrooms to make this a whole meal. It was awesome and very easy.

Quiche doesn't get much easier than this. I used 5 eggs as others suggested. It really was light and fluffy. Could jazz it up with mushrooms but still enjoyed just as is. MADE AGAIN: still yummy! 3RD TRY: used defrosted broccoli instead of spinach, it's a hit!

Quiche is nothing more that an egg custard pie and is so... forgiving of ingredients. Always sauté onion and garlic to remove raw taste and be sure that all veggies are squeezed or patted dry. a bit of S+P and you're ready to bake. I've made them with ham, shrimp, chorizo, cooked bacon, green pepper, asparagus,broccoli, you name it….yum!

I went ahead and followed the original recipe.  The only thing I may have done differently is used maybe a little less spinach or cheese initially, and maybe a little more onion - I just eyeballed everything.  I actually watched the video for this recipe, so I knew what to do.  I had a container of previously chopped onions, and a huge bag of frozen spinach that I just broke a big hunk off of and defrosted, then hand-squeezed before just layering like the video showed.  My shredded cheese was a fatter shred, so I didn't completely cover the other layer with cheese.

What I did wrong: I forgot to grease the foil I covered the quiches with ahhhhh!  So, come time to remove it, it stuck to the quiche, leaving the quiche with a little crust missing, and the top looking like craters of the moon.  So, I just covered the quiche with more shredded cheese to hide the craters and stuck it back in the oven for 10 mins.  

I doubled the recipe and made two pies, and the pies were just regular shallow ones, and the amount of eggs, etc., was perfect.

What I didn't see anyone else mention, is that this quiche puffs way up, then settles to be level with the crust after awhile.

I'm glad I went ahead and used a full 1/2 cup of (real) mayo, and 1/2 cup of low-fat milk (all I had or I would have went for the full fat he he).  The quiche turned out moist but firm, not sloppy.  I like my scrambled eggs moist, so the original recipe was perfect for me. Thanks KristinJoni for a great EASY recipe!

Very good. My daughter who doesn't like spinach quiche raved about it. I altered the recipe just a little. Used the plain non fat Greek yogurt and I sautéed sweet onions with my chopped spinach. I also dried the spinach with paper towels. And I varied the cheeses by adding a little have try and Colby jack.

Christmas brunch was a hit with this fabulous recipe! I made similar adjustments and was so pleased with it! I added one egg, used almond milk instead of regular milk, sautéed the onions and spinach together and added diced cherry tomatoes I had on hand. I also used half the amount of cheese, and added 1/2 cup of feta instead. It was perfect! I had enough to make 2 quiches and made one with crust, and one without. Both were perfect! I cooked the crustless version for ten minutes less. Divine!

This was really delicious.  My husband kept calling it gourmet.  I used fresh spinach (for quantity, I just layered as much on as what seemed right, probably about 2 -3 cups.  I also added cremini mushrooms, which were really good in this and about 1-2 tsps of garlic salt.  I didn't use the extra egg added by other reviewers and it turned out great (maybe b/c I used fresh spinach), but it wouldn't have hurt it to add another egg either.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Like other reviewers I added an additional egg, added Feta, sauteed fresh spinach in garlic.  I also added bacon and cut up pepperoni slices and added that to the mix to please the family.  Topped it with sliced tomatoes and covered it with aluminum foil for 45 minutes and then removed the foil and backed another 15-20.  Also, I used one deep dish pie pan.  My family (just 3 of us) ate it all that night.  Rave reviews - very versatile!!

This was good.  I thought it was a little heavy on the spinach, maybe 3/4 of a package would be good, or even try to spread one package across two quiches.  Would need to make up the volume with some other veggies.  It also could have used a pinch of salt.

Wonderful! Per other reviews: sautéed onion, garlic and one shredded carrot; layered fresh spinach in store-bought pie crust with onion mixture and cheese; used 1/4 c each milk and light mayo with 5 eggs; and baked per directions. YUMMY!

This was easy and delish!  I used fresh spinach that I'd chopped, washed and spin dried.  Sauteed spinach with onion and threw in about 6 chopped asparagus speers, too.  I took the other reviewers' advice and added an egg and used 1/3 cup lite mayo, and used 1/2 chedder & 1/2 swiss, with some feta thrown in.  I cooked it covered for 50 min but it was not nearly done yet, very soupy on top still, so I uncovered and cooked another 20 min.  Then I left it in the "off" oven for a couple hours after letting some heat escape first, and it was actually perfect when I got home.  I was worried about it turning out bland because there were no spices (other than a lil salt & pepper on the sauteed veges), but it was tasty!  Oh, in the last 15 min I placed 4 fresh tomato slices on top of the almost done quiche, and it really added to the visual appeal--plus tasted great.

I made this recipe and it turned out amazing - got rave reviews at a party. But I have to admit that I embellished it a bit and it was not low fat. I added an extra egg, substituted half and half for milk, regular mayonnaise for the lite, and regular sharp cheddar in place of light. To the filling I added chopped broccoli to the spinach and besides the onion, I added crumbled feta and bacon. I also used a deep dish pie crust. There was nothing light in the recipe but it was so good. I will definitely make it like this again!

I used Bob's Red Mill Oat Flour Crust recipe.  I used less than half of a one pound bag of  frozen spinach, four eggs, about 6 oz of cheese.  Slightly less mayo and milk.  I had dehydrated chopped onions.  Mixed all the filling ingredients instead of layering.  Easier.  Did not put it on a cookie sheet, since my ceramic pie pan was not filled to capacity.  Also added a shake of garlic powder.  Good luncheon dish.

I made this recipe for a Christmas brunch this year and my family loved it. I left out the onion (by accident)and added diced grape tomatoes. Before pouring in my filling, I poked holes in my pie crust with a fork and baked it for about 10 minutes ("blind baking"). After letting it cool for a few minutes, I then poured in my filling. This prevents a soggy shell. Overall this was a great recipe. The filling was tender, moist and flavorful. Don't leave out the mayo, I believe that's what sets this recipe apart from other quiches I've made.

I made this exactly to the recipe as I did not have time to read reviews.  It is very yummy as is...I could not fit all the liquid in the pie, but no big deal.  Next time, I will sauté the onions.  I will make two next time...it's going fast!

This could be the best quiche recipe that I have tried from this site (and I have tried several). My combination was some crumbled bacon, green onion, a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach and cheddar. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Quick and delicious and even looked great.

The filling as prepared in the recipe is enough for 2 pie shells. The extra egg is a good idea. I use mushrooms, broccoli, onion, spinach, cheddar and goat or feta cheese. Delicious!

I make this often, first few times followed the recipe exactly, then started using different vegetables, or adding ham.  Really, really good quiche! Make sure to leave space between the top of the quiche and the foil before putting in the oven, sticks badly otherwise.

I also added an extra egg.  I'm not sure about all of the comments on it having too much spinach - we thought the exact opposite.  I'm trying it again tonight with broccoli instead.  Fingers crossed!

I actually didn't use spinach, as I didn't have any on hand.  So I substituted the spinach with canned asparagus (something I usually reserve for soup only).  It turned out wonderfully and my family loved it!

This is a great quiche. I used half mayo and half plain fat free yogurt and you couldnt even tell. I used the Butter Flakey Crust recipe and  that just made the recipe in my opinion. It would not have been as good with a store bought crust-well worth the little effort. I want to add chopped tomatoes next time- it would be a good compliment to the other flavors.

Easy to make, easy to remember, fabulous recipe.  I use fresh spinach and whatever cheese we have on hand, though cheddar is the most flavorful.  Love this recipe.  People think making quiche is hard... not with this recipe!

This is a great recipe. I followed the basic guidlines and added sautéed roma tomatoes, mushrooms and capers to the spinach/onion/garlic mix.  I also added several dashes of red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor a notch. I opted for a combination of parm. and moz. cheeses rather than cheddar.  This was a very good, well-set, filling quiche.  In hindsight, I would not use as much mayo and would have added another egg--as other reviewers recommeded.  The mayo flavor was a little weird when the leftovers were reheated. It was lovely cold though! (Note: this recipe pairs well with the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe on this site.)

This was pretty good. I followed it exactly as written except I omitted the onions (don't like egg and onion mixed). Next time I would use less spinach and more egg, and maybe add some feta cheese since it goes so well with spinach.

Yummy quiche! I added in some fresh, sliced mushrooms and subbed in mozarella cheese instead of the cheddar, since that what was in my fridge.  I also decreased the temp to 375 and baked until it was set. At 400, it seemed that the crust would darken too fast. My husband and daughter who don't normally eat quiche liked it alot and asked for seconds!

Very light and fluffy. I used sour cream instead of mayo, sauteed the veggies (which was a good thing because there was tons of water in them). I also added about 6 baby portabello mushrooms sliced and chopped up some pepperoni (they gave it a pop). A whole range of veggies would go in here. But if they are really crunchy veggies, they should be sauteed. Not my favorite recipe ever but is a good dependable one.

This was amazing! I did use 5 eggs after reading reviews.  I did sautee the onion a bit with a few slices of chopped bacon.  I used a mix of cheddar cheese and shredded parmasean cheese and it was so tasty! I made this for a houseguest and my husband who "hates" quiche, and he said that "this" kind of quiche is awesome.  Oh, and I used the kind of crust that rolls out, but I only own a rectangle baking dish, so the extra crust got tucked in the sides and made it extra crispy - the pieces with the extra crust were the best! Very quick, too. I'll make it again.

We loved it!!  I, like others, did make a couple modifications...I sauted my onions with some left over ham I had, added the extra egg others recommended & cut back, just a bit, w/the mayo.  I also made a crust (I learned from pelicangal!) and it was GREAT. Thanx for the recipe, I'll make all my future quiche's w/your ingredients!

I just fed this to my family and three of their teenage friends and we all loved it....the pan was empty! The only changes I made was omitting the onion (you know how kids are!) and added a bit of chopped ham.
It was great, will definately be making again!

This quiche was exceptional.  Easy to assemble, done on time and the mayo adds a different kick to a rather simple dish. Made it for a brunch and all the moms raved over how good it was.  Definitely a must try!

Delicious! One of the best spinach quiches I've ever made. I made a few changes based on prior reviews: Used 1/3c mayo instead of 1/2c and used 5 eggs instead of 4. I made it crustless in a 9" glass baking dish, and it was divine. We will definitely put this into our dinner menu rotation.

A delicious quiche, that I would have given five stars to, four from my husband who said he would prefer more egg and less spinach. So, four and a half really. Served with Rachel's Tomato Basil Soup, also from this site, for a wonderful and easy supper. Thanks!

I added sundried tomatoes (not the ones packed in oil) and subbed sundried tomato & basil feta for half the cheese.

Very nice consistency.  I made two of them and the second one was refrigerated overnight and served at room temp the next day and was still very tasty.

Good, but wasn't really wowed.  I eye-balled the spinach and only got one quiche, unlike many reviewers who were able to create two.  I also added an additional egg and did not include the onions.  Might make again.

Very much enjoyed the 2 quiches this recipe made.  I had a little difficulty in layering the thawed chopped spinach.  Maybe there's an alternative to using it from a box.  But held together very well, tasted delicious and even had one to send home to my Sister-in-Law (which they loved for Breakfast the next morning)

A great quiche.  I overslept and was able to whip it up in 10 minutes!  I used an extra egg and the filling was overflowing out of the pie crust.  My reason for giving 4 stars is that is wasn't as fluffy as the some of the quiche I've had at restaurants.

SOOO good and easy.  I've never made quiche before, and this was very flavorful, light and absolutely delicious.  I did cut back on the spinach to about 3/4 a pack, and cooked it with some onion.  Perfect!

I made my own pie shell, the problem was it seemed to have an overbearing flavor of spinach. My husband and myself did not like it. My 2 year old nephew loved it. He went home and told his mom "Uncle and Aunty fed me something beautiful".. I sent the rest home with him..

Soooo yummy and easy to make.  I followed another review and added another egg and cut the spinach in half.  I also added some smoked ham.  I think I'll try goat cheese and artichokes next time.  This base is wonderful!!

I'm a young cook and tried this recipe for my first quiche ever and it turned out wonderfully! Both my parents and my boyfriend loved it! I loved it too, but I think I will try adding crumbled bacon next time.  Great recipe!

Personally I loved it, though I love spinach. I think if your not a big spinach fan, cut it back to 1/2 - 3/4 of a box. I too sautead  the spinach and onions with a can of mushrooms. I used a deep dish frozen pie crust and accidently bought low fat(low taste) cheese. but it was very good. Next time I'll use good old high fat cheese and have a heavenly meal :o)

My first quiche ever, and it was great! I followed the suggestion of adding an egg, but my friends & I agreed that it was a little too fluffy for our liking.  I also used what cheese I had (2/3 c Italian blend + 1 1/3 c cheddar) and green onions -- great, though I think I'll not saute the green onions next time :D I used a tad more spinach since I used whatever was left of my partially used 16 oz. bag -- still great, perhaps because I followed other suggestions about leaving in longer: 50 minutes covered, then 12 ½ minutes uncovered.  Also, to cover my unfoiling snafu, I sprinkled cheese on top – beautiful!

We served a brunch recently and this was one of several items on the buffet.  It also happens to be the recipe that has been most requested since the event.  So, I guess that means it should get multiple 5-stars.  As to alterations, I did add 1/8 tsp of Paula Dean's house seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe - I've added it to my recipe box.

It was my first time making quiche and you made it so easy for me.  I sauteed the onions and spinach together and that was about the only difference.  It turned out spectacular.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is excellent.  It's very delcious and easy to make.  My whole family loves it.  My changes - use swiss and provolone instead of cheddar, increase onion to 1/2 cup, use sweet onion cooked in butter first.  I like to serve hash brown potato on the side.  I will try this for Easter brunch and fill it with sausage, bacon and cheddar.

Delicious and easy!  The only thing I may do next time is cook the onions before adding them because they were still raw.

We liked this recipe very much.  I used my favorite whole wheat frozen pie crust, 1 can of spinach, and added some sun dried tomatos and shallots.  I substitued a little bit of organice plain yogurt for the milk.  My husband requested more shallots next time.

I sauted the onions before adding to the recipe. I also added mushrooms, bacon and doubled the cheese. (I used what I had on hand at home, 1/2 Norvegia and 1/2 Gulost). It was both beautiful and delicious. Everyone loved it!

My first quiche ever made especially for a diabetic co-worker who LOVED it!  There was too much quiche for the pie shell, but would probably fit if I purchased a crust and placed in my own deep dish pie shell.  Either way, this was a hit.  Very easy, nobody could believe I made it!

Very easy and delicous. This was my first time making a quiche. I didn't have frozen spinach, but I had fresh spinach. It worked out well. I added mushrooms and an extra egg and it turned out delicous. This is indeed a light and fluffy quiche!

Great, easy recipe.  Only cooking for myself, because my husband doesn't eat spinach.  I bet I could put some bacon in it and he would eat it.  I could see me making a few of these in advance and freezing them, since I am home with a newborn!  Easy & quick lunch.  THANKS!

Thumbs up.  How up you ask?  Way higher than any quiche I've ever had.  Beat out Nancy's Quiches!  Two drawbacks...too moist with frozen spinach and too many onions.  Those two adjustments should elevate this recipe to PERFECT status!  Fresh baby spinach is purrrfect!

I prepared it for some teachers at School and it was praised by everyone that taste it!  The most important thing is that it so easy to prepare and is so fluffy.  I substituted egg whites for eggs and used fresh spinach.  GREAT RESULTS!  Thank you I will continue to enjoy this recipe.
