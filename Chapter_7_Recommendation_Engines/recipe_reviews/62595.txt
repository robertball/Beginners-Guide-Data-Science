I used sharp white cheddar cheese, Granny Smith apples, and leeks instead of onions. I did not need to steam the leeks first, just sliced crosswise into 1/8" pieces. This is a great recipe, a very nice use of "nontraditional" root vegetables, and with the apple and cheese, it is also "sweet and savory". Thanks!

Mmmm!  We followed this recipe pretty closely.  The only changes were that we accidentally left the foil off, and added a touch of nutmeg.  We had the oven at 350, moving it up to 400 for the last few minutes to brown the cheese.  It was delicious!  Sweet, savory, rich.  Went wonderfully as a side dish to pork chops.

This recipe is a good idea, but I think it needs some texture help. I cooked it, uncovered, and it came out watery. The cream got chunky.

I followed this recipe as it was written with the exception of using Gruyere instead of cheddar.  While the flavor was okay, the cream became thinner instead of reducing to a thicker consistancy.  Maybe it would have helped if I had baked the casserole uncovered.  The recipe neglected to state oven temperature so I baked it at 375.

This was my first time cooking Fennel and Celery Root.  It tasted delicious!  I forgot to steam the onion with the other veggies but it was still wonderful.  I used Parmesan cheese.

I would definitely just make a roux next time - the whipping cream was too heavy, and it was liquid-y, as someone else mentioned. Also, cooked at 375 for 40 minutes, but the temp isn't listed. I'm sure there's a better way to cook these lovely veggies that doesn't take the good stuff out of them like this one seems to.

We enjoyed this casserole and will make it again. The only change we would make is to somehow thicken up the heavy cream sauce. It was kind of soupy but overall very tasty! Cook time was fairly accurate. We left it in a little longer (6 min.) trying to thicken it. Didn't work but didn't hurt it.

This was a nice, subtle change-up from the typical au gratin root dish. I made one casserole as a side dish and four of us almost finished it off--even one of my pickiest eaters enjoyed it. It was that good. I used sharp cheddar and shaved Parmesano Reggiano. Instead of heavy whipping cream, I used goat milk with a tablespoon of sorghum flour whisked into it. I will make this again!

This was my first time ever seeing, making, eating fennel. This recipe came out great! I made a couple of the modifications other reviewers had suggested as well as a couple of my own. First, I didn't have, nor could I find, any celery root so I sliced up a large russet potato. Second, I used cream of celery instead of the heavy whipping cream. If I ever get fennel again this will definitely be the recipe I make!

Flavors came together well!

We substituted
1 small apple & 1 medium pear in place of the large apple
1 can cream of chicken soup in place of the whipping cream

Cooked it uncovered and it was nicely creamy and browned on top.
