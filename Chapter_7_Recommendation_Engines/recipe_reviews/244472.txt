I tripled the recipe, used an electric mixer, and followed directions. I had no idea whether this would work, but it did! And it was great! Will be making this again!

I really liked it, the downside is that I'm underage and couldn't get any coffee liqueur so I just used coffee. I tried it once using whole eggs to get the custard but it just didn't work so I separated the eggs. I whipped the whites and turned the yolk into the custard. I ended up getting a lighter and fluffier texture that a semifreddo should be.

Made with lemon liqueur (30% alc) and lime zest, also added a bit more sugar. It was awsome! Great consistency!

This was awesome! Definitely a keeper. I used Bailey's Irish cream instead of Kahula and it tasted great! 10 out of 10

I enjoyed trying this but I never quite achieved the "ribbon stage" while whisking.

I highly suggest watching the video. I'm not sure what happened during the egg step on my first try, but I got some solids of what I am guessing are scrambled eggs haha. SO I scrapped that, used C&H instead of my "natural" sugar, and "borrowed" two of my roommate's higher quality eggs, and kept heat lower. It took a LONG time (15+ min of egg whipping and heat adjustment) but eventually got to the ribbon stage. The rest was straight forward, and I excitedly tried a spoon this morning, smooth, sweet n delicious!

This is my fourth try. The main problem has been getting the eggs to thicken. Tonight I resolved to either thicken them, scramble them or break something, I did not follow the instructions exactly anymore. I simmered water in a skillet, and placed a pyrex bowl in that, and whisked, and whisked.  Not much happened for 20 minutes, until I turned it up to high, getting a full boil, and even then it took another 5 minutes or so to thicken. I expect this batch will be good. The first batches tasted great, but without thickened eggs they had poor texture, not airy at all, not much fun to eat. I would make this again if I could get it right, and into the freezer within 20 minutes or so. But it took about an hour altogether tonight to do that.
