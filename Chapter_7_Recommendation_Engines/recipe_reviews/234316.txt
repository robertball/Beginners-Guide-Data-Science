Based on both the title and the description, I expected corn in a curry-flavored creamy sauce (or curry-flavored corn in a creamy sauce, either would be fine).  The result tasted only barely, if at all, of curry, and was not even remotely creamy.

The first problem is that the yogurt curdled.  If you look at the recipe photo, you'll see that this has happened there as well.  In retrospect, this isn't surprising.  Yogurt (even full-fat yogurt) doesn't have much fat, and will curdle when added to a hot pan if not properly prepared.  Adding some starch (flour or cornstarch) to the yogurt beforehand can prevent this.

The second problem is that the corn tasted primarily of garlic.  I don't have a problem with garlic, but this recipe is called "curried corn", not "garlic corn".

I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I substituted red pepper flake for the cayenne, and I omitted the chives.

The flavor profile was really good however, I'm struggling to understand why it's called "curried" because there is absolutely no curry in this dish.  Adding garam masala and coconut milk do not make this dish a curry.  I find the title most misleading.

I used this recipe as a guidance for cream curry corn. I didn't have the yogurt and the grama. Instead I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/3 cup of cream cheese. since I wanted curry I added about a teaspoon of curry power. turned out amazing!

I used 3 cans of yellow and white del Monte corn since on the cob is out of season.  I assumed 2 ears of corn/ can.  I trebled all three slices but jacked up the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  and used 1 5 oz. cup of  Chobani plain yogurt because our seemed too dry.   Served warm,  the same day.  Well received, but I'll bet it's better fresh.  Oh, and I added 2tbsp regular yellow curry powder since it did not smell pre taste curried right off the stove.

This was good, but nothing amazingly special.  It ended up tasting plainer than I expected.

We had this with Christmas dinner and it did not disappoint! I did use a bag of frozen sweet corn because I didn't have fresh corn and the proportions of the other ingredients were just right. Nice to have a lighter side dish since we had a creamy potato dish. Thanks, Chef John, for another great recipe.

This was absolutely great!!  I didn't have any garam masala, but found recipe on this site. I also didn't have any yogurt..... so left it out..... and it was still great.  Will make again and again.
