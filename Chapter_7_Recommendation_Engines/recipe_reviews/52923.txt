This was ok.  Not something that would tickle my tastebuds but we might have it down the road.  Using the coffee grinder for the seeds was a must.  An easy meal to prepare though.

This resipe has been a favorite of my family's since we found it last year. Even my picky 9 year old loves it. We can hardly get him to eat meat. I like to serve this with wild rice and winter squash. Very tasty, nutritious, and flavorful combination.

We were NOT fans of this recipe at all.  The fennel seed did not work with the chicken at all and gave it a funny flavor.  We were almost unable to finish our dinner.
