These turned out really good. A little heavy on the tomato paste flavor but still good. I will double the spices next time but other than that I wouldn't change anything.

These came out really good my son asked me to make them again.. this is the first Enchilada recipe I found that didn’t use milk or cream of some sort as I am lactose intolerant the only changed I made was to use lactose free Cheese. Delicious!!

Really good. I did add more spices to the sauce, that’s the only thing I changed. 
Hubby liked it too...

These are absolutely delicious! My children request it almost weekly. The recipe states it serves 4 but it easily serves 8 at my house. Nobody can eat more than one even though they may wish they could hold more! Excellent recipe.

This recipe was excellent, I did not change any of the ingredients. Dressed it with Guacamole and Sour Cream. Thanks for sharing!

These were good, would have liked more sauce and a little bit more spice.

Really good! I made these yesterday. Left out the chilis because I didn't have any but added more chili powder and some hot sauce. Used about 4 oz of shredded jack cheese and cheddar on top. Delicious! Will certainly make again....and soon!

Will make again.  They seemed sweeter than I expected.  Maybe the tomato paste in the sauce?  Very tasty though!  And filling!!
