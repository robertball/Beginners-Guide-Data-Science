Flavour is good but the method does not work.  Instead skip the foil and bake wings in the sauce in an open pan.  This will thicken the sauce and improve the colour of the wings.

We made this 2 times now. The 1st time was as directed in foil, on the grill. The skin was soggy & not crispy as we like & the wings were very pale looking. We tried again for super bowl & didn't use the foil so it came out better but not much flavor. Asked hubby if we should try a 3rd time & marinate in sauce over night, but he doesn't want to. I think we'll look for something else in the future.  We really like hoisin & honey flavors so was very disappointed.

The flavor on these was amazing. I used a pound of boneless tenders and doubled the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

I have made these several times and each time I get made for not making more.  So so good!
