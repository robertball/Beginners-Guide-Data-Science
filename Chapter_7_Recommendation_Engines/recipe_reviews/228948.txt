Excellent on pork chops! This is a really tasty barbeque sauce, but burns easily so delay brushing on meat until 1-2 minutes prior to turning or removing from grill. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of maple syrup because I didn't have any. I also used white pepper because I love it. I ended up with a deliciously thick amazing sauce.

I didn't put in the full onion amount because we don't like heavy onion taste...but that could have made a difference with making it taste more like bbq sauce, because it was very mild in that regard. Still very good though. Will make again and play around with the ingredients.

A very solid use for blueberries. In case anyone wants to know, this recipe makes very precisely 1 pint of sauce, which means....drum roll....it can be canned for future use easily, albeit I am putting it in half-pint jars.

Very nice.  I agree that it doesn't come out tasting especially like blueberries, but it tastes very good indeed. I subbed chipotle powder for the chili powder, which makes it substantially spicier, which I like.  And I wanted it just a bit sweeter, so I added about a tablespoon of pomegranate syrup (a.k.a. pomegranate molasses), which I have around the house because I do Middle Eastern dishes occasionally; another bit of maple syrup would probably have accomplished the same thing, but the pomegranate syrup is just perfect.  And I omitted the lemon juice.

This sounded like the perfect way to use some extra bluedberries, but this sauce tastes neither like blueberries nor bbq sauce.  We tried it plain as a dipping sauce, baked onto chicken and fish (it was best on chicken) and while we love all the ingrediants it just didn't live up to the flavor profile I thought it would have

This didn’t go over well with my family when I served it with pulled pork bbq, which was a shame since this recipe has a lot less added sugar compared to the honey bourbon bbq sauce I usually make. I’m muddling through using it up as a dressing on grilled chicken/salads. It didn’t have a strong blueberry flavor, or a strong barbecue flavor, so winds up a mediocre pairing with the foods I’ve tried so far.

I just finished whirling this up in the food processer and I have to say WOW!  I love it!  It has a great consistency, beautiful color, and I just love the flavor.  The only things I did different was to add a little more maple syrup to taste, and since I didn't have any smoked paprika I added a couple of dashes of liquid smoke.  My friends and I BBQ every Sunday and I can't wait to break this out!

Different but pretty good.  Cut the W. Sauce in half tho.  I also just added a couple shakes of cinnamon and couple shakes of red pepper flakes as we like spicy.   I used my stick blender to whip it up and covered wings on the grill.  Very good.  Oh and I forgot the lemon.
