I took note of the other reviews the 2nd time making this.  I recommend steaming the kale first, set it aside, and then proceed with the recipe.  I never found a good use for kale, and I enjoy this recipe, but kale does taste better a bit more cooked than if stir frying raw.

While the flavors were incredible, the texture of the Kale is not at its best when stir-fried. Next time I make this, I will steam the Kale and stir fry the broccoli. Keep in mind: kale takes a while to wilt and the garlic will burn and taste nasty long before the kale is wilted via stir fry.

HOLY MOLY! This was TAS-TEE!!!!! And SO incredibly healthy! I left out the chile pepper and used fresh marinated sundried tomatoes, which I got from an old-world Italian meat market.I also added feta cheese to the mix for that extra flavor/texture. WOW, this was GOOD. Will definitely make again. And again. And again.

This was pretty good. I've never used kale in cooking before so it was a new taste for me. Definitely make sure that you have all the veggies chopped before you begin cooking because everything cooks quickly. I'm definitely going to make this again.

I got kale and broccoli in my weekly organic vegi pack and tried them in this recipe.  The taste is unique but I do like it.  Will definitely make again the next time I have broccoli and kale both at the same time.

The  last time I ate kale was over 50 years ago. My mther grew it in her garden. I always keep broccoli on hand. My grocery store doesn't sell kale. I got it at the " Whole Foods " store. I used a very large pan and left the  kale and broccoli in  bite size chunks. Cooking time is a little longer. I used lots of slivered garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Love both. We have a big lemon tree, so I used the juice of a large lemon instead of limes. This is an adult vegetable dish, I don't think that children would like it. I found it very, very interesting and very tasty.  I will definitely make this again

In the opinion of a first time kale eater, this wasn't a bad dish.  I actually prefer cooked kale over cooked spinach (although I love raw spinach) because the kale doesn't become so wilted and mushy.  It's a pretty dish, especially with the sun dried tomatoes.  My only complaint -- kind of sour and I would cut back on the lime juice next time.  I also like the suggestion of including feta cheese...maybe even instead of the lime juice.  Easy to make!  Kids wouldn't eat it though.

This was a lot better than I expected. It is always great to find a healthy dish that is also full of flavor. I think the tomatoes made this dish. This was my first time trying kale and I will definitely have it again in this recipe and others. After reading other's suggestions this is what I decided to do with the recipe and I loved it. I steamed the kale first, and only use 1/2 of a lime. I grilled a marinated chicken breast and corsley chopped a few cashews. I topped the kale and broccoli dish with slices of the chicken and sprinkled  the chopped cashews over the top. Yum!

I really loved this recipe!  A great way to serve Kale to people who've never tried it.  The breadcrumbs really help cut the bitterness of the Kale.  I did end up using an extra tablespoon or so of olive oil to prevent the bread crumbs from burning and to coat the Kale.  Will definitely make again!

This is a great combination of flavors. The lime gives it a nice bite without being too tart, and the chile pepper provides just the right amount of heat without being overpowering. It's a beautiful dish, with the bright red of the sundried tomatoes complementing the vivid greens. I made this as a main dish with the Cherry Tomato Salad as a side, and everything went together nicely. I'd like to try this with red bell peppers.

This is awesome!!  So healthy and delicious. I didn't have a chili pepper so I added red pepper flakes instead and I added juice of about half a lemon (I didn't have any limes)

I love this recipe!  I steamed the broccoli and kale before stir-frying so they would be a little more cooked (personal preference).  This way the garlic wouldn't brown too much while waiting for the veggies to cook.  I added about 1/8 tsp. salt to the oil and only used about 3 Tbsp. lime juice which I think was perfect.  The lime juice and the sun-dried tomatoes are really what make this recipe outstanding!  I enjoyed the kale so much, next time I will double the kale and just leave out the broccoli.

I added Organic Chicken Broth to help cook the greens (b/c the temp is very high and everything was burning!) and I also added fresh mushrooms and onions.  Delicious!!!

Fantastic! Healthy, delicious, fast! I added diced red onions with the garlic in the fry stage. That was nice. I also added more after the kale was 3/4 done. It added a nice texture. Yummy!

This is now one of my boyfriend's and my favorite veggie dishes! I followed the other reviews and steamed the kale first, which makes all the difference. I also added a few red pepper flakes b/c we like spicy foods. I also put a dash of balsamic vinegar to cut the lime. I've made it with and without the feta cheese another reviewer suggested, and we prefer with. It's delicious!!

WAY TOO MUCH LIME JUICE!  I cant understand why more people haven't commented on this. I used ONE lime and even spilled some on the stove and the lime was still a bit heavy.  It is a delicious recipe but I'd recommend 1/2 a lime or about 2 TBS of lime juice.  This would have been delicious with lemon as well or maybe even a splash of wine-vinegar.  

This was also heavy on the garlic.  Was the goal to mask the flavor of the kale and broccoli?  I cut the recipe back to 4 1/2 cloves (minced)  because I did not want to taste garlic for 3 days.  I didnt need any salt with all the garlic and lime juice so it was a low sodium dish.

Instead of steaming the kale separately (like many have suggested)  I put about  2 TBS of low sodium chicken broth in my pan and heated it.  Next I added the kale and let it simmer for about a minute or two.  Then I added the garlic and peppers and so on. By the time i added the broccoli, most of the broth had steamed off.  Adding the kale FIRST to the broth or water to steam cook made it  perfect and uses the same pan for everything.

I too found kale and broccoli in my weekly organic vegetable and fruit share.  I found, as usual the other reviews help me refine the recipe.  I cut back on the lime, steamed the kale before combining with the broccoli.  Used hot chili flakes and added goat cheese.  A very delicous combination of flavours that adult and child diners both enjoyed.

I've always been afraid of kale.  Yeesh!  It's been in my head that kale was a decoration, not a yummy vegetable.  So... I was perusing recipes and decided these ingredients were simple enough, so I was brave and tossed this together, and was amazed at how yummy it was!  I've made it without the broccoli and just the kale, and made it with all different types of kale.  Blanch purple kale first because it's pretty tough otherwise.  I always add more garlic, salt and lime to taste.  If I don't have fresh chili peppers on hand, I use dried red pepper from the pantry.

My mom made this for dinner tonight, and it was just great!  We all agreed that we would love to make it again.  We added feta cheese, and it really gave to dish a good tinge of sweetness!  It was quite beautiful too.  i can't wait until we make this again.

DELICIOUS!!! I have never tried Kale before and this was great. I took the advice of others and steamed the Kale first. I didn't have tomatos or lime but did put in some bread crumbs and a little sharp cheddar cheese. My 18 month old even ate some.

It was decent, but a bit bitter. Too much lime juice in recipe. I would recommend adding extra sun-dried tomatos to counteract the bitterness of the kale, and steam the kales beforehand (which I did).

Really, really good. Would be 5 stars except I tweaked it at the suggestion of other posters.  -One lime was -enough-...could potentially be good with only half too.  -Steam the kale first!  Didn't have any a pepper to spare so I used a dash of cayenne pepper.

I have never had Kale before but thought this was a very nice dish.  I did steam the kale ahead of time but just until it started wilting then I put it in with the rest of the ingredients and let them finish cooking together.  I forgot to add the lime while cooking and only had lemons so I just drizzled a little lemon on after plating it, I felt the lemon was a much needed flavor. I also did not have a chili pepper so I used dried red pepper flakes and it worked very well.  All in all a recipe I will use again and to boot, my 8, 7, and 6 year old girls all asked to try it and liked it although they did not prefer the sundried tomatoes much so scooted them to the side.

This recipe was awesome. My boyfriend WON'T EVER eat kale, and he ate it up and said we should make it more often. I used a little less lime juice, but other than that, no changes were made :)

This was a great recipe, and was the first time I've cooked kale. I did not include the chile, and put in less garlic, but found it to be delicious. I think it would be even better if you added some toasted pine nuts, though I haven't tried that yet. Enjoy!

Very tasty, quick, and easy! I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes, but it still came out well--I'll definitely make this again.

This was so GOOD!! Easy to make and a great side!
We complimented it with grilled chicken, but I think it would go well with many proteins!

Even though I did not use chili peppers or tomatoes, this dish turned out great!  I've never eaten or cooked kale before, so I was glad to find this recipe, and my whole family really enjoyed it and requested I make it again in the future.  Thanks!!

I've been a fan of kale for a while and have been looking for a different way to prepare it. I followed the suggestion of simmering the kale in a little chicken broth while I chopped the broccoli.  Next, I added the garlic, oil and broccoli, 1 T lime juice and a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes.  A splash of balsamic vinegar and a handful of feta cheese made for an out-of-this-world dish.  I agree with the other person who said that this recipe would not be near enough to feed 6 people.  I ate half for dinner and saved the other half for another meal.

Still chewing and had to write a review.  Loved it!!!!!  I steamed the kale for 3min in the microwave first.  I tossed in some grilled chicken.  I think next time I will throw in some pine nuts.

My hubby and I love kale, and this recipe is great.  I would differ from other reviews, however, in that I would steam the broccoli first and let the kale cook itself in the stir-fry.  Also less lime juice is a must!  I used garlic scapes instead of garlic and it was a nice, subtle garlic flavor rather than overpowering--very tasty!  The only other problem with the recipe is that there is NO WAY you could feed 6 people with the amount it makes.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself!  Yum!

Excellent recipe, I tweaked it a little and used ranch dressing and bacon bits. I chop the stems and leaves both, boil for a minute or two and it's done. Kale is the most underrated fountain of health in the produce section, and is the best and cheapest health insurance there is. I eat it three or four times a week.

Don't, don't don't add all the lime in recipe.  Only put in a table spoon until you taste it.  I halved the recipe amount to one lime and it over powered the whole dish. I will make again because it could work with less lime.

You are NEVER supposed to cook extra virgin olive oil on high heat because of the low smoke point. Use canola or some veg oil that will not scorch on a higher heat than it is made for... rated in the middle since recipe is good.

NUMM!! I never cooked with kale before, so I was timid and did more of a saute than a stir-fry. Was afraid of burning the garlic since I didn't know how long the kale would take to cook. I saw the previous reviews about pre-steaming but didn't want to bother. I also only used 1 lime, next time I will use two, and used broccoflower instead of broccoli. Turned out fabulous!! Nutritious, pretty and delicious.

I used a fresh diced chile pepper as well as red pepper flakes. I also added a little bit of salt juice and just a dash of black pepper. Not a bad way to use up the extra kale and broccoli I had. It was quick and easy to make.

Attempting to eat healthier...this recipe is a winner! After reading reviews, I opted to steam the broccoli and kale for about 5 minutes. Used onions, fresh mushrooms and sauteed till tender, then added the garlic, kale and broccoli. We really liked this recipe!

O! M! G! I can't stop eating!!
As a  tip, really remove all the stems, not just the end of them, tear off the leafy part from the center, this allows to skip the steaming somebody suggested and it cooks very fast. 
I used small kidney tomatoes, fresh, their flavor is strong and they're a great substitute for sun dried. 
Also, I "cheated " a little bit and added about une half cup of crumbled bacon (I fried it myself). 
And as I did this in Mexico City, where I'm from, I used an organic deliciously spicy "chile de arbol" from Xochimilco town producers and I came out with a super gourmet side dish that EVERYBODY loved, even little kids!

Lime was a tiny bit too much for me, I only did 1 lime. Overall it was a nice side dish.

This was very tasty. I didn't use all the lime though by a long shot, just a sprinkling of juice was enough. And I used red pepper flakes instead of chiles. I took the recipe as a challenge for my kids since several people said kids wouldn't eat this, they (3 and 4 years old) both ate it :) I'm taking off a star because I don't think it would be as good if you followed the recipe exactly and used that much lime juice.

I did not care for this recipe.  My recommendation, don't make it, find some other recipe that incorporates kale.

We were not impressed with this recipe. I only used the juice from one lime and it was still way too over powering. In fact we couldn't even taste all that garlic! I generally enjoy  sun-dried tomatoes but mixing the tart tomatoes with the sour lime was too much for me. I bet adding cheese, as others have suggested, would help balance out this dish.

this was the best kale that i have ever had in my entire life.  

fact.

(i liked it more than the broccoli, and broccoli is my favorite veggie)

i did steam the kale first.

Maybe I just don't like the taste of kale, but the whole dish had a very bitter taste.  I do not recomend it unless you're desperate for form greens.
