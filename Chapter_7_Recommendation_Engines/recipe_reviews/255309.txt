I had this for lunch today.. I liked it.  I shredded the apple and did not use the optional cocoa and butter.  I had this with some salty bacon and it was a nice contrast to this sweet  dish

This was . . . "interesting". I scaled this down to 1 serving, and cut the cinnamon back to about 1/2 tablespoon. I did add the optional cocoa powder.  I added more milk in order to be able to keep cooking it (otherwise it would have just been a burnt mess). It looks absolutely terrible, but once I tasted it, it wasn't that bad. Not something I'd make again, but it did fill my stomach and keep me full until lunch.
