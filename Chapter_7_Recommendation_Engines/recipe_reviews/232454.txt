I used ground chicken instead of ground beef, red pepper instead of green pepper and homemade taco seasoning. To fill the meal out a bit, I served it with my Take-Out Fake-Out Mexican Rice and homemade refried beans. NO leftovers. We ate every bit of this until it was gone. Very economical meal to make.

It's really hard to rate a taco that uses a basic taco filling.   I mean a taco is a taco.   For creativity, I give it 5 stars.  The shape of the romaine leaf, along with its sturdiness makes a perfect substitute for the carb watchers that don't want a tortilla shell.  I'm not sure why the peppers and onions are sauteed and served as a topping other than to please a picky eater.  I'd much rather save a step and cook them in with the meat.

Lettuce Leaf Taco Haiku: "No surprise, they're great! 5-star reviews in order. Fun and colorful!" Only very minor changes that I made were using 4 TB of AR's "Taco Seasoning I" instead of 3, and not adding the optional chicken broth to the veggie saute. (Alot of the reviews mention this being an "April 2015 Recipe Group Selection" - what does that mean?)

I made these for recipe group this week. We liked the idea and I would consider it a good replacement on the day I feel the need to cut carbs or just find myself without shells unexpectedly. I used homemade taco seasoning and added toppings of guacamole and FF Greek yogurt.

Recipe Group Selection:  18, April 2015 ~ Great recipe - I loved it.  Hubs asked "Where in the heck is the taco shell?" He ate four on the lettuce shell, so I don't think he really missed the flour tortilla!  This came together quickly and was super easy to make. I liked the less calories without the shell, but added them to the meal with the side dishes! It was served with 'Quick and Easy Guacamole', 'Refried Beans Without the Refry' from AR and fresh fruit.

Made this for Recipe Group...These were a HIT (and healthy too)! I did mess up and cooked the meat w/ the peppers and onions, so I just added the taco seasoning to that mixture. It didn't specify if you should add the water that you usually add w/ the taco seasoning, but I did add a bit just to loosen everything up and get it combined well. The romaine lettuce at the store didn't look too good, so I subbed some beautiful butter lettuce instead, which worked out great! Served with 'Easy Refried Black Beans' and Copycat Chipotle(R) Cilantro-Lime Brown Rice', both from this site. I will def be making tacos like this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This came out great! I did make some changes. Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey.  To the onion, which I had white instead of yellow, I  also added zucchini and red pepper. This was great!

It's easy to do and delicious. I feel a little bit healthy because I know I'm eating a lettuce. Lol. I cooked this for my mama's birthday and one of the guests said she'll copy it and do it at home. Also, my sister said she likes it better than with taco shell. Way to go! Thank you for sharing the recipe. We obviously loved it!

2 thumbs up from everyone in the family. I simplified the cooking directions. After I sauteed the onion and pepper, I added the ground beef and browned it in the same skillet. I, then,  added taco seasoning to taste and little bit of cumin.
I washed the lettuce leaves and dried with paper towels ( the whole leaves were too big for my salad spinner ). We skipped the tomatoes but served with a dollop of homemade guacamole, Cheddar cheese and chopped cilantro.

Definitely a good option if you're trying to reduce carb intake, but still want tacos!  They are a little tricky/messy to eat, but aren't all tacos?

I've been attempting to stay low carb but REALLY like my tacos and had a craving. I found this recipe and tweeked it just a bit to make it even faster. I bought 1 pound of ground beef, had the romaine leaves home already, bought a taco seasoning mix packet, a can of seasoned chopped tomatoes (seasoned with oregano and other relevant seasonings), and shredded cheese. It came out great! Didn't miss the flour tortillas at all. Great recipe and idea.

My husband and I both loved the taco filling.  He put his filling on the leaf and used a knife and fork to eat.  I wrapped mine and ate out of hand.  I might try iceberg next time and I know I will make it again especially as our tomatoes ripen.

Ingredients taste good together but the lettuce in place of a real taco was no fun to try to eat. My husband opted out and had tortilla chips and I ended up cutting up the lettuce and turned this dish into a taco salad.

Even adding a half of a jalapeno pepper I still found this a bit bland and not spicy enough. It is a good base though so I may play around with it. Love the lettuce leaves instead of tacos or tortillas to switch it up.

Recipe Group: This was yummy! I was feeling cheap so I subbed ground turkey for the beef. I loved the salt on the tomatoes :) The romaine didn't look so good at the store, so we used green leaf lettuce. Turned out messy but a fun and tasty take on taco night, thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was soo good my kids (ages 6 and 10) asked me to make it next week! This is a first.
