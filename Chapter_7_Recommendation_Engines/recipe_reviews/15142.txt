Absolutely great dessert. I have made this four times and am ALWAYS asked for the recipe.  Though on a side note, I always use 1.5 times the amount of peaches the recipe calls for.  It's pretty darn fabulous.  Definitely a keeper!!!

This was fabulous!  I call it my second best find so far on this site, with the first one being the recipe for "Clone of a Cinnabon".  I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass 9 x 13 pan.  I then chilled it over night and brought it to work.  Everyone loved it!  I also would agree that it's not really a pie, but more like a peaches and cream dessert.  I didn't find it too sweet at all and I like that it calls for canned peaches, so I can make it any time of year.  Will definately make this again.

I liked this pie a lot. It is pretty easy to make too. I have following suggestions for improvising it:

1. Bake the crust for 10 min before adding peaches to avoid making it chewy

2. Make sure you drain the peaches well or the pie will be soggy

3. Do not forget to add cream cheese mixture leaving 1" space from the edge of the pan (I forgot to do this and it spilled over during baking)

4. Perhaps add only 1/2 cup flour to the crust mix (not absolutely necessary but this is something I might try the next time)

5. You might want to add 1 1/2 can peaches instead of just one 29 oz can ( again, this is not absolutely necessary)

6. In the reviews some people have suggested to use spingform pan instead of pie plate - that might be necessary if you add more peaches.

After spending considerable time reading other reviews, I adjusted the recipe to suit our needs.  I doubled the recipe, added an extra can of peaches, and used a 9x13 pan.  I baked the crust ten minutes and then added peaches, etc. and returned to the oven for an additional 35 minutes.  The cinnamon sugar topping looked like it was going to be too much, but I threw caution to the wind and used it all.  I'm very glad that I did because it enhanced the flavor tremendously. I would advise using a strong, sweet cinnamon such as Chinese cassia. Everyone enjoyed this and asked for the recipe.

It's amazing. I've made the peach version and loved it. I recently made a "Strawberries and Cream" version. It was just as good. Nice alternative to strawberry shortcake. If you use strawberries you'll need 32 oz. frozen, sweetened, sliced strawberries. Thaw and drain well! The cream cheese topping will be pink and very cute:) Soon, I'll try raspberry and blueberry.

If you use a smaller pan than 10 inches your crust will be soggy/runny. If you want to use a 9 or 9 1/2 inch pie pan and don't want to spend 30 bucks getting a 10 inch pie pan shipped to you and/or you don't want to worry about soggy crust do this: Mix the crust as directed. If using a 9 or 9 1/2 pie pan dump 80% of the mixture into the pie pan (100% if you have a 10 inch pan). Cook for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Brush with egg whites until coated and then cook for 5 minutes more. This makes sure your crust is completely cooked and the egg white makes a protein barrier so that your crust does not get soggy from the peaches while cooking or standing. Follow the rest of the directions for the pie. All in all this was pretty good. The next time I will cut the pieces of peach up and mix with the cream cheese.

Alright here goes... I am 24.  I dont cook.  I dont bake.  It is just not my forte.  I work at a hospital in Medical Records where they were having their annual bake off and the 1st prize was a 50$ gift certificate and 2nd prize was a 25$ gift certificate.  I just love gift certificates and was so inspired to bake something to win one of these.  So every year, a doctor comes in to taste test the goodies and award the prizes on tastefullness and presentation.  I didnt dress my pie up or anything, just took it as is, and it looked pitiful... not very pretty.  The cinamon had baked up on the sides, etc.  After all the taste tests were done, he awarded 3rd prize, then 2nd.  Then he says, "in all my years, i have judged pies on a combination of taste and presentation, but this year's 1st prize lacks presentation but was the most delicious pie!"  And I won the 50$ gift certificate... I never won anything in my life.  I was so happy.  I was also kind of nervous about it because I had never tried this recipe before and being that I dont cook, it made me a little worried, but all turned out good.  So many complimented me on the pie.  It felt so good.  Maybe this will be the beginning of my baking career!  It also helped that there were a lot of reviews to read.  I really wanted something that would win and when I read everyone's reviews and they won something, all the better.  Thanks!!!

DON'T change anything from the original recipe.  The original recipe won the BLUE RIBBON for me today in the pie contest at my church.  

I previously made this recipe using others suggestions, such as baking crust before putting in peaches, etc.  BIG MISTAKE.  

FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS IS and you will get exactly what the recipe states "AWARD WINNING".  This is like a peach cobbler and a cheesecake, but much better.  

I really don't like making pies, but this is definitely one that I will make again and again because not only is it absolutely delicious, BUT SUPER EASY!!

I made this recipe and read some of the reviews first. I found this recipe should only be baked for the time said, 30 -35 min. as it will harden off after it cools because of the pudding and flour in the recipe. Also, make sure you buy the cook and serve pudding mix and not the instant. I used the remaining peach juice and made a sauce and poured it over the top immediately after removing from the oven and added ground walnuts on top. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

This was really good and not overly sweet.  I didn't have a pie plate on hand so I baked this in a casserole dish.  I was asked for the recipe and people didn't even know it was supposed to be a pie. It was more like a Peaches & Cream Dessert. For those of you who are not fond of overly sweet desserts, this one if for you!!

This pie is so easy to make and very tasty.  I baked mine in a Pampered Chef 10" deep dish and it turns out great every time.  I add an extra 15 oz. can of peaches along with the 29 oz. can and it is the perfect combination.  Maybe I'm different, but I think this pie looks great too!  You won't be sorry you made this one.  One of my top finds at AllRecipes!

I do like reading the written reviews especially from those who are kind enough to talk about what worked as well as what didn't-I hope I can return the favor as I may have one solution for the problem of the undecooked crust.  I used a 10' springform pan instead of a pie plate.  Not only did the straight sides of the pan seem to make everything cook evenly but I didn't even need to refrigerate it as I wanted to serve it warm with ice cream. It looked like a fruit torte-solving the 'pretty' problem, set up beautifully without refrigeration,, and was as delicious as everyone said it would be.  Perhaps using a 91/2" springform pan might make the layers a little thicker if anyone wished....Hope this helps.

I doubled this recipe and put it in a 9 x 11, cooked it 35 minutes and chilled it overnite. Came out perfectly. Everyone thought it tasted great and many had seconds.  I would call it more of a peach cream cake however.

I used a 10" springform pan, and baked the "crust" by itself for 10 minutes as recommended by other reviewers.  I think I'd try baking it in a 10" quiche pan next time just for a prettier presentation than a springform pan.  Followed everything else as written in the recipe.  Doesn't really qualify as a pie, but it is a nice dessert; very cobbler-esque or shortcake-like with a good cream-cheese topping (sort of a cheesecake flavor); the cinnamon/sugar really adds.  We're trying it out warm now as I type; it's ok chilled too, but the leftovers aren't as appealing; we liked it fresh-out-of-the-oven-warm better.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've made this recipe as is, no changes needed, several times in the past ten years and it has never failed me! I am always asked for this recipe and it is most requested! The bottom cake like crust is just like a sponge cake, it bakes up and over the peaches. And the cream cheese sets up just like a cheesecake, so let it set up in the fridge for at least 4 hours! I have to shake my head at some of the changes people made in the reviews, please don't change a thing! Bake it in a glass or ceramic dish, near to the bottom rack to insure the cake portion cooks. If you use a springform or metal pan you'll have to cook it for 10-20 minutes longer. And drain the peaches well and pat dry on paper towel to avoid the soggy bottom!

Ok, here's the deal - I did not want to rate or review this recipe until I tried it a few times.  1st time I used an aluminum pie tin, and cooked it for the 35 minutes - it didn't cook all the way, and was very runny.  Then I used a glass pie plate the 2nd time and (due to my high altitude, cooked it for 55 minutes) it came out perfect!  Tonight, I used a 16 oz can of OregoN blueberries, leaving in a tiny bit of juice, and using the blueberry juice with the cream cheese mixture, and HOLY COW - it was even better!!  This also helped the "pretty" problem - I left out the cinnamon sugar on top, and it was very smooth looking.  It tasted kind of like a "blueberry cream cheese muffin" thing, VERY VERY tasty!!! I would recommend this substitute to anyone who likes berries!  I will also try the other varieties of the canned OregoN fruits.  Thanks Deb for sharing, this will be a definite addition to our family cookbook!

I totally adore this recipe! It is soooo good, and so very sinful! It is more of a cobbler than a pie, but the "crust" is really delish. I always replace about 1/3 to 1/2 of the cream cheese with sour cream, and add a bit more sugar, and it is really good! I made this with fresh-picked apricots (home grown) for a party once and that was totally out of this world. The guests practically licked their plates! The pies were almost gone before I could get any.. When I saw how fast it was dissapearing, and tasted how good it was, I picked up the last pie and hid it! It was awesome for using up all that extra fruit! The canned is really good too. Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!!

I did the unthinkable and tried this out for the first time on a large group at a bbq - it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 disposable aluminum baking pan. I baked it for 35 minutes and then turned off the oven and opened the door to let it cool that way.  It was really really good and I got lots of compliments. I will definitely make this again.***Update 8/23/11 - I made it again already, this time with apple pie filling instead of peaches.  OMG so wonderful!  It's really like a pastry more so than a pie. I decreased the sugar by half because of the sugar in the apple pie filling, some of which was mixed in with the cream cheese & sugar.  Soo soo good. I baked it in a 9-1/2" springform pan.  Maybe because of the extra gooeyness from the apple pie filling, I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes.  Then I let it cool the same was as before, turn off the heat and leave it in the oven with the door cracked open.  Yum Yum Yum, try it!

I had fresh peaches from here in East Texas.  I put a little sugar over sliced peaches and made the syrup needed to add with cream cheese.  Delicious!!

This has been our family's "spring pie" for the last 7 years, I make it every Easter.  I've made it according to instructions and have tinkered with it-it always turns out best when I make it according to the recipe.  I've tried using splenda in place of the sugar-it's okay, but the flavor is better with the bad stuff.  Let's face it, if you are going to be evil and eat pie, you might as well go all the way on down with it!  Also, it seems that the consistency of the cream topping is a bit runnier when I use Splenda.  Next, I've tried doubling up to make TWO pies. DO. NOT. DO THIS.  Unless you are mixing it with a stand mixer.  Because the crust piece is so thick, it will twirl up the beaters on your hand mixer and create an unholy mess.  Mix the crusts pie at at a time for the best, least messy, easiest to operate result.  And finally, I have on a few occaisions, gotten lazy and zapped the cream cheese in the microwave to "soften" it.  If you do this and over soften, then the cream will be runny.  If you like the cream topping to be more substantial and formed, allow the cream cheese to soften naturally.  This really is an excellent pie-again, it has always turned out best for me when I follow the recipe as written, and it's my family's most requested pie when I crash their parties in the spring and summer.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I love this recipe. I have made several times.  I believe the crust problem has to do with the size of the pan you use. I have found that if made in a pie plate the crust is goopy.  When I make in my 10 inch spring form pan it comes out perfect.

Very tasty and easy enough to make. I doubled the batch and followed other reviewers advice of baking the cake batter 10 minutes before adding peaches. I found doing this dried the cake out a bit. I think I'll try it without prebaking next time. Definately a keeper. I made peach sauce with the juice in case people wanted to drizzle some on the pie, but it didn't need it. The sauce will be great over ice cream :)

I gave 4 stars cause I think it would have turned out better had I followed the recipe correctly. DO NOT, under ANY circumstances use instant pudding for this crust!

Bake the crust for 10 mins before putting peaches and stuff on top. Need more than 1 can of peaches.. need like 2-3 cans/jars. Optional: use peaches and cream cream cheese! use splenda and less of it, because this comes out very sweet. When putting cinnamon and sugar on top, swirl it INTo the cream cheese topping to make it extra pretty!

This was unbelievable. As suggested in other reviews, draind the peaches very, very well and cook the crust for 10 min before adding the peaches. I used brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg for the topping. Chill over night.
Great warm weather dessert. A million  & one thanks.

I made this with fresh strawberries sliced and lightly sweetened with sugar.  Otherwise made as written and it turned out very well.  I wasn't expecting a "pie crust" so I wasn't disappointed.  I like that the whole pie wasn't too sweet, and the cream cheese topping did the trick.  Very good, easy, recipe. Will try my other favorite fruits.  Next summer if I can get my hands on some black raspberries, I think they will be the ultimate!  Thanks for a great recipe!
*** NOTE***  I suspect that the folks who had trouble with the bottom layer being tough or rubbery may have overbeaten the batter.  Being somewhat old-school, I stirred mine by hand and with a sturdy whisk, and the crust was fine, yes a bit cake-like but that's what the recipe is.  If you expected a real pie crust without making one...you are being unrealistic.

I tried this out on our monthly Family Night and everyone loved it! I took the suggestions of others and baked the "crust" for 10 minutes or more, and once it had firmed up a bit, took it out of the oven and after it had cooled off (about 5 minutes) I brushed egg on top to create a barrier between the crust and the peaches. I put it back in the oven for another five minutes and took it out again and followed the rest of the recipe as indicated. Once it was done, I let it cool off and refrigerated it overnight with awesome results. The crust was tasty, not too sweet, and the combination of peaches with the cream cheese was a big hit. A bit time consuming but the results are worth it.

This is a wonderful recipe that i now get asked to bring to every get together.  I use a 10 in springform pan, i do not recommend cooking the cake part for a few minutes before adding the peaches if you use this size pan. I have tried it both ways and like it better when the peaches get a chance to fall down in the cake part of the dessert.  If you use a smaller pan i can see how you would need to cook it first to make sure it is done.

I used a 10' springform pan for this recipe, not a pie pan. Turned out very well! Followed recipe exactly, except I doubled the peaches, using two (2) 29 oz. cans of peaches. It is actually a very pretty dessert - don't know what other reviewers are talking about! The only thing I would change is I would add some sugar to the "crust". I think it needed to be a little sweeter. Topped with fresh whipped cream - very good! Would like to try this with strawberries or cherries. This has to be one of the easiest desserts I've ever made.

Will certainly make again ! Next time I will decrease sugar in cream cheese..a bit sweet.  I used 3 tbsp of peach schnapps instead of peach juice for more flavour

I absolutely LOVED this pie!! I would definitely make it again - I look forward to using blueberries and strawberries. I pretty much shot the fat in the butt by substituting the butter for 3 tbsp. applesauce and using half lowfat and half nonfat cream cheese. I also used less sugar and whole-wheat flour. You couldn't tell the difference! I would just add more fruit. My favorite part was the cream cheese topping - just like cheesecake!!

5 stars for sure-I put this recipe aside thinking how good could a dessert taste with canned peaches...Well I'm so glad I gave it a try because it is to die for.  What a treat to find a not so average dessert that tastes so fabulous.  I used a can of diced peaches instead of sliced(all I had) and only sprinkled maybe half the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top and baked for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I'm not sure why others crust didn't turn out right because mine was perfect without pre-baking.  It's not suppose to be like a standard pie crust.  Also make sure to use a 10 inch pie plate because I think most standard pie plates they make now are 9 inch and that could be why the crusts are not coming out so great.  Leave out some of the crust mixture if that's the case.
You will love this-don't pass it up like I did!

This was very unique.  I think I would have enjoyed it fresh out of the oven, though, rather than chilled.  It smelled so good!  I also baked the "crust" for 10 minutes before putting fresh peaches on.  I only needed about 3 peaches to cover the pan, but they were very large peaches!  I used 3 tbsp. peach jam instead of the canned juice.  Yum!

I found this recipe on your site by searching for award winning pies, our church was having a pie contest. So I made the pie, I didn't think it turned out good, it was not solid and looked underdone. But I was running out of time, so I took the pie to church. The judges had about 10 pies to judge, I knew it was an award winning pie but I didn't think it turned out good. To my surprise I came in first, with OVERWHELMING comments from the judges and many others. They wanted to know who made that FANTASTIC pie. I followed the recipe to the T. I didn't change a thing. The only thing I would add is " serve the pie warm". They just loved it. WOW. Thanks for a fantastic pie. But it tends to look like a cake, but it's a pie. Again, WOW WOW WOW.

This recipe is essentially a cheesecake with a self-making crust.  That is why it may still be runny after 1/2 hr. in the oven.  I continued baking for a total of one hour, until it no longer jiggled when shaken.  If you leave off the cinnamon topping, you can monitor the doneness by the color of the surface.  I did add a little sour cream to the cream cheese, which made it even more like a cheesecake.  It continues to firm up as it cools.

This is an excellent recipe! My son didn't care for the peaches so I made another one with pineapple chunks and it was just as great..kind of like a pineapple upside down cake with a twist! I will try the advice of doubling this recipe and baking in a 13x9 pan cuz one round pie is definitely not enough for us.  Thanks for a great recipe...a definite keeper!!!!

I just made this pie for the second time, I bake the pudding mixture for about 15 minutes then add the peaches and cream cheese on top, then bake for another 30 or more minutes. It was best pie at Thanksgiving dinner! If you want, you should add another small can of drained peaches to fill the top of the "crust". I used a glass pie dish and it came out just the same. Very pleased with the results, and it is delicious.

I was apprehensive about making this after reading most of the reviews but overall it was successful.  I bought whole peaches in juice from Trader Joes so I was able to slice them very thinly, which complimented the assembly.  I also was short on flour by 1/4 c so I substituted an equivalent amount of powdered sugar.  That made the base just the right amount of sweet and I think may have helped avoid the problem of gooeyness because of the cornstarch in the sugar.  I also used much more cinnamon sugar mixture to cover the entire top of the pie.  Baking in an aluminum cake pan I let it go until the top was completely browned, about an hour.  My boyfriend loved it but it wasn't a personal favorite for me.

Have made this many times. One of my families favorites, especially with fresh peaches from our tree. With fresh peaches, I put a little sugar on them and wait a little while for some juice to drain out. I save the juice I don't mix with the cream cheese for pancake syrup. SO GOOD!

I used a spring form pan per the recommendations of other users and it turned out amazing!  After running an edge around the outside of the pan, I removed the outside of the pan and the pie was beautiful!  Great presentation!  The taste was equally as impressive and I'm already thinking about when I can make it again!  Thanks for sharing Debbi!  I made no changes to the recipe because it's perfect as-is.

Absolutely delicious and made with canned peaches! I doubled the recipe for 9x13 and took advice of others to use more peaches, used 3 large cans of generic peaches and it was outstanding!!  Tried it warm - yummy, room temp - very good, cold - perfect!!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

My boyfriend loved this, and asked me to come up with a red velvet strawberry version. I think it would be possible to do. I also really liked it, but it was more of a cheesecake than a pie, and I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake. But that's a personal preference, and overall, this was a really good recipe.

I would rate this one ten stars if I could!!  So delicious and so easy.  I read some of the other reviews oh how the pie comes out kind of mushy...I simply cooked it at 360 instead of 350 and left it in the over for about ten minutes longer and it came out perfect.  Some ovens may be different though...so pay close attention so it doesn't burn.  Will definitely make this one many more times in the future.

I have made this desert for many years, and it has always been a big hit. Everybody wants the recipe, everybody! There is nothing I would change,  and never have.  It's very,very easy to make, and looks very nice. I use a clear glass 
10 inch pie dish and that is just fine.

Amazing dessert!!!! I get asked for this recipe EVERY time I bring it somewhere. You must follow this recipe exactly. I bake it in a springform pan for easy removal after it has cooled in the refrigerator. THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!!

This was very good - actually tasted more like a peach cobbler.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and 2 16 oz bags of frozen peaches in a deep dish pie crust.  I brushed the crust with egg white before filling.  I baked the pie for 15 mins at 400 and then 45 mins at 350.  The last 20 minutes I sprinkled (1/4  C brown sugar, 1 Tbsp softened butter and 1/2 tsp cinnamon) on top, and then some glazed pecans.

This was award worthy!!! I didn't have a deep dish pie pan, so I used a springform pan and it worked great. Followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1/4 tea of peach extract to the peach juice, and boy was that a good idea. Really added extra peach flavor.

I made this last night for some guys helping out around the house.  They seemed to like it.  I only had instant pudding and that seemed to only matter in the consistancy of the crust.  It was not pourable like the instructions say.  Anyone else used both and know the difference?

The first time I made this pie, I felt like something was lacking with the top part, it didn't taste right, and I cooked it too long and the bottom crust was a little dry.  The second time I made it, I used two (8 oz)cream cheeses instead of one, and checked it after 25 minutes, and boy did that make all the difference!!  Even my stepfather, who absolutely hates sweets, had two huge pieces!!

This is an amazingly delicious dish!  We ALL loved it!!  I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the peaches ... what a yummy addition!  I also made the dessert in an 8x8 square, glass pan and baked it for nearly 45 minutes ... it was done perfectly in the middle!  We're anxious to try it with fresh blueberries!

Pretty presentation on this one. Tasted alot like peach shortcake. My hubby loved this, but I wasn't too crazy about it. It comes out like peaches on top of a sweet shortcake with a creamy topping. By the way,to Tina: put the pudding in dry. Thanks, Debbi. Guess I was expecting a knock-my-sox-off dessert. ;0

I used a 2.5quart casserole dish for mine and it turned out just fine -- like a cobbler.  Also, I used an extra can of peaches plus the larger size box of vanilla pudding and it still made a pretty small dessert- will definitely double ingredients when I make it again.  I baked then chilled overnight before taking to our Trivial Pursuit potluck party.  Within minutes of setting it on the table it was gone and compliments were flowing, so I'd have to say it's a success! Thanks Debbi for posting the recipe!

This is AMAZING! 
I made this exactly as written, but did cook the pudding base for 15 minutes until firm, hoping that it would come out less mushy- as per reviews. 
I also used a 9" stoneware pie pan, and used only  80% of the pudding batter.
It was perfect. almost the entire pie was eaten within an hour. I'm making another today. :)
I could easily see how interchangeable the peaches are. It would be great with blueberries, strawberries, pineapple. Possibilities are endless.  This is easily my personal best find on allrecipes.com
Good luck & I hope yours comes out as good as mine.

This was a great recipe. The only thing I changed was I used a spring pan, cooked the flour mix for 10 min., then pushed some of the mix up the side of the pan to make a well. Then cooked it for 5 min. more. Add the peaches and the cream cheese mix. This way the cream cheese mix can be pushed to the flour mix. will make again.

I was disappointed in this recipe after I read all the rave reviews it got.  I did take the advice of others by doubling the recipe and baking the crust 10 minutes before adding the peaches.  I even chilled it a couple of days in advance.  It didn't look appealing when it came out of the oven (cinnamon/sugar topping), so I spread real whipping cream on the top.  The crust tasted doughy even though I baked it the required time.  I was somewhat embarrassed that I served it at a 4th of July party even though most people said they liked it.  I think they were just being nice though!  I probably won't make this again.

I used fresh peaches (so I didnt have the Peach sauce to add to the cream cheese) and it was amazing!  We loved everything about it.  I also only had tapioca pudding mix- I was afraid that that would cause problems- not at all!

Easy suggestion-  try mixing some chopped pecans into the 'crust' mixture.   Great addition!

Wow! This dessert was really good! I doubled it using a 9x13 pan and it came out great. My husband who's not even a big sweets eater couldn't get enough and made me promise to make it again soon!

My husband and I love this recipe, but we like the crust a bit sweeter, so I use a large box of instant pudding.  It's great.  I also only use about 2 tablespoons of the peach syrup to make the cream cheese topping.  It sets a bit easier that way.

Man, is this a good recipe.  It's deceptively easy, uses basic ingredients, and tastes great.  The end result is almost like a peach shortcake with cream cheese frosting on top.  Definitely give this one a try.

I thought this recipe was wonderful as did my family. I thought it was a
pretty pie. I did every thig by the recipe and baked it just like it said and I had 
no problems at all. I wonder if some of the others maybe mixed the pudding to 
the box directions? I added it dry to the mix. I was VERY pleased with mine. I cant
wait to share it with others.

Can we give a higher rating??  This recipe was outstanding!  I followed previous reviewers' advice and doubled the recipe, and baked in a 9X13 pan.  It was very loose at 35 minutes, so I baked another 10.  I chilled it for roughly 5 hours, so it was nice and cold when I served it.  It was so fantastic, that my husband and I took second helpings when the kids were in bed.  I think it would really wonderful using a variety of different fruit, but the peaches were perfect!

I thought this pie was great, but I think I would add more peaches next time.  Maybe it was that I thought of it as a peach pie.  So next time I may double the recipe and put in 3 cans of peaches.

This is by far the best pie/cake recipe I have ever found in my 50 years of cooking. I usually make it in an 8 by 8" Pyrex dish but have made in 9 by 13" cake pan, cheesecake pan, 9" pie plate, just about anything you could think of. Sometimes doubling the recipe sometimes not. Since discovering this recipe I have made it at least 100 times. Everyone LOVES it. The original recipe is fail safe and easy for any level of cooking experience. I've made it with other fruits as well but I must admit the canned peaches and original recipe is the best way to go. I'm so happy and thankful that Debbi Borsic  submitted it. I can't wait for a pie contest to enter it in. It's defiantly a blue ribbon desert.

I tried this recipe late yesterday night to serve for family.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it, and asked for second helpings. I did not have a 10" pie pan though, so I used  my 13x9 glass pan.  Cooked for 30 min exactly (probably because it was shallower than being in a 10" pie pan).  I might have been able to pull it a minute or two before and just let it sit.  We ate it warm - didn't wait for it too cool.  
For people who want to know: THERE IS NO PIE CRUST.  The cream cheese topping is the 'crust'.  
Method: I put the batter in the pan and carefully laid out the peaches side by side - three rows of peaches.  Then, I dolloped as much of the cream cheese mixture as I could (left a 1" border around the end).  Used a spatula to grab it all.  Then, I carefully spread it over the peaches.  Last, I dusted the cinnamon sugar mixture.  That made the whole house smell GREAT.  
I'll make this recipe again for my next family event.  Super easy.

what a mess!  after baking for the requisite 30 min. using my convection oven and adding layers of foil to a lower rack to catch the never ending drips, i scooped the goop into a glass pie pan.  i nuked the goop for more than 15 minutes and determined i will NOT use this recipe again.  it just wasn't worth the mess and the flavor of the "crust" was artificial.  (i followed the recipe and my ingredients were all good,

This dish reminded me of a cheese danish with peaches instead of a pie. I used fresh peaches and cooked in a springform pan. we tasted it both hot and cold. It tasted great either way but was easier to eat chilled. Everyone loved it so Ill keep this recipe and make again. :)

Thought it was good - seemed like a little too much cinnamon for the topping. Did as another reviewer suggested and made it in a 9x13 pan. Family liked - leftovers from fridge had the consitancy of cheesecake. Will make again. If you don't like sweet desserts, this one is for you.

I prebaked the crust and didn't like its flavor. Next time, I'll use a tart crust. On the other hand, the cream and peaches part was yummy. Btw, I used fresh peaches. Thanks for sharing.

Very good "pie" that is almost more like a cobbler on the bottom.  I had a small taste right after it came out of the oven before chilling as the recipe directed.  I think it was much better warm than chilled.  However, both ways were very yummy.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Five stars for flavor, four for directions. I had some trouble with this recipe, my "crust" was like cake batter and never fully cooked, even though I cooked it for 15 minutes before assembling the peaches and cream. It tasted absolutely wonderful anyways! I'll have to read more reviews on how others dealt with this.

Great find!  Made this for a family cookout and got rave reviews from everyone.  Didn't have a deep dish pie plate, so I made this in a 9x9 pan.  Turned out really good, and will definitely be making this one again!

Very easy to put together, and the taste is exceptional!  The only thing I did differently was to use a 10-inch springform pan and I also used a sugar and cinnamon mix that was already purchased.  I would like to try this with blueberries next!

This is more of a cake than a pie, I usually double up the recipe and put in the in glass baking pan.  Regardless, I've made it on several occasions and it always gets rave reviews.  I follow the recipe almost exactly, the only difference is that if I double up I use the 4.6oz vanilla pudding as opposed to two 3oz ones.  I've never had the problem that the others mentioned about soggy cake.  Overall a really good recipe and I highly recommend it! Easy and looks great.

This was great!  We ate it warm because we just could not resist waiting to let it chill as the recipe suggest, delicious. I made a mistake and realized after I had already prepared half the recipe that it called for 'non-instant' vanilla pudding mix, well I used instant pudding anyways and it was great, I am not sure of what the difference would have been. Great recipe, it is going into my personal stash!

Fabulous!  I used very juicy, fresh peaches (5 large) and found I had to add an extra 20 minutes to the 35 min baking time.

eh.  Not as great as everyone is saying.  Crust was mushy as well.  Cream cheese topping came out well.  Used fresh peaches so I didn't have the syrup so I added a splash of pomegranate blueberry juice.  mmm.

Wow.  I wanted to try this recipe when a few of the gals were coming over for the evening.  I knew serving a non-chocolate dessert to this group might be risky, so I made a very chocolaty cake along with this recipe.  My chocolate loving friends were converted!  This cake (not a pie in my book) was wonderful.  I baked it in a 9 inch springform pan instead of a pie dish and it came out wonderfully.  It was easy AND it tasted good - all of the choc-o-holics asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

This was ok. My family loved it, but I thought that it was boring. I was expecting something more like fresh peach pie with a cream cheese accent. It was not.

I had some peaches to use up, so I decided to make this for a potluck dinner.  I used most of two large fresh peaches, and added about 3/4 cup of blueberries, turned the cream top purple, but it was actually pretty attractive.  To compensate for the sweetness of canned fruit and syrup in the original recipe, I added two tablespoons of sugar to the crust, sprinkled about a tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon on the fruit before topping it with the cream topping, and I added 3 tablespoons of apricot preserves, a splash of lemon juice, and about a tablespoon of maple syrup to the cream topping.  As others suggested, I baked the crust/cake layer for 10 min, brushed it with an egg white wash, and then baked it for another 5 min.  Honestly, if I make the cake again, I won't do the egg wash.  I think if the fruit sinks into the cake layer, it might make it a little softer and the cream layer might sit on top a bit more.  I didn't get the mushy result some people complained about, but I thought the crust was a little bit gummy and after baking, the cream cheese/fruit layer sunk and wasn't as light and fluffy as I would have liked.  General consensus from the potluck was that it was "something different," "not overly sweet," "decadent," "much better than traditional peach pie," etc. and it disappeared quickly as lots of people went back for seconds.  But I'm not sure I liked it enough to make it again.

Just loved this!  I did not beat the cream cheese long enough, but it still came out very nice...next time I will try to stay out of it until it is cold!  I had to try it warm!  After it had cooled in the refrigerator, it was quite fun.  Thanx for a great one.  It reminded me of peach cobbler with cream.

Great recipe!! Very different. I'm from the Netherlands so it is always hard to find good substitutes for some ingredients. We used 'monchou' creemcheese and it worked out fine. My boyfriend made this recipe two times and although he is not an experienced cook, the pie was wonderful.

I didn't really like this recipe. It wasn't very peachy tasting even though there were peaches in it, the "crust" was more like cake than anything else, and the top layer with cream cheese, though delicious, was very very very rich. I was expecting something more pie-like and got something more deep-dish-cake like. I probably won't make it again.

Definately tasty.  A great change from your average pie or cake for dessert.  Very refreshing with your summer BBQ.  Who likes hot cobbler on a sunny day?  Chilled peaches & Cream Pie hits the spot.  VERY easy.  Great to make in advance (you know that's my favorite thing) for that summer party.

Made this is a spring form pan. Doubled the peaches and cream cheese mixtures only. Garnished with strawberrys and served this on pedestal cake plate. Served at at Mother's Day  brunch and everyone claimed to loved it. Presentation was very nice---do not know why every one is complaining about the appearance of this dessert. More like a cheese cake.

This was very good.  I used a 10" springform pan, and used about 5 fresh peeled peaches.  I also cooked it for about 45 minutes, and then cooled it for a few hours.  When it came out of the oven, it looked a little runny, but it firmed up after chilling.

I used frozen peaches (thawed) for this recipe and it worked quite nicely.  This is kind of a cross between, cobbler, cheesecake and pie.  Bottom line it was not complicated and very tasty.

This recipe is fantastic!  I don't know what anyone was talking about- mine turned out beautiful (I used a springform pan!) and the consistency was perfect!  I made it for a BBQ and my friends and family loved it!  They all tried to take it home!  I used fat free cream cheese and no one could tell the difference (one person even commented on how the pie was a perfect example of why you have to use regular cream cheese if you want it to taste right! haha!!)  I will certainly make this again!!!!!

This recipe was good and easy, but I was expecting more with all the stars, it deserves 3 stars, but no more. I used fresh peaches and it was very good.

We had this dessert with friends last night-  nobody liked it very much!  I was disappointed.  It is easy to make but I wouldn't try it again.  I think it was the cream cheese- it just wasn't something we liked & there were 4 of us with very different tastes, so... take it for what it's worth.

Loved this recipe too, as has everyone we fed it to.  It is more like a cake/cheesecake than pie.  I wonder if the reviewer who said it was "rubbery" used instant pudding by mistake - I started to because my eye caught the word "instant" in haste (makes waste) so sent my husband to the store and started over. I did bake the bad crust too -  had to see what would happen and the result could be called rubbery.   4/4-I did make this, as one reviewer suggested, with 1/2 W.W. flour, 1/2 light cr. cheese and 1/2 regular, and substituted applesauce for the butter and used blueberries.  Results were quite acceptable and you feel better about it because its healthier!

This was "just okay"-- too gloopy, gooey, sweet, and moist (too moist to be a true pie).  Would not make again.

Wonderful, and very fast to put together.
So far, I have made this with, peaches, raspberries,and mandarin oranges. Going to try cherries or maybe blueberries next.
Always comes out great, and no pie crust to make!!!

My family loved this recipe. it turned out perfect in a 10 inch disposable aluminum pie plate. I did bake it about 10min more than recipe stated. It was light and delicious.

Although it comes out looking like a pie it tasted more like a cake.  I was not too happy with the taste, but my husband seemed to enjoy it.  I think I will try it with a different fruit - although the taste I didn't care for seemed to come from the cake itself.  This was a very easy dish.

I didn't have any baking powder so I substituted self rising flour for the salt flour and baking powder.  I didn't have any vanilla cook and serve pudding mix but I did have a box of pistachio instant pudding mix. I did have to use  a couple tablespoons more milk cause it was way too thick.  I didn't have enough butter so used just a tablespoon .  I didn't have peaches so I used a 20 oz can of chunk pineapple. The cream cheese was cold so I put that in the microwave with the right amt of pineapple juice.  I didn't have enough cinnamon so only used a 1/4 teaspoon with the sugar for the topping.  I used a 9x3 inch cake pan and clumped and spread in the pistachio mess in the bottom I then spread over the pineapple chunks and then  literally poured the cream cheese mixture  over the top and then sprinkled the sugar mixture and tossed it in the oven.  I literally did everything wrong to this recipe...  IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL! THIS IS A TOTAL WINNER.  My sister used mango instead of the peaches. She followed directions...lol.. and was the hit of her potluck.  500 stars!!

This was just ok.  It took almost an hour to brown and it did not start to rise until after 45 minutes.  I don't know if it was something I did but mine was rather flat in height. I did bake the 'crust' 10 minutes prior to adding the peaches and I used a 10" pie pan.  I also agree with a lot or the reviewers that the peaches should be doubled.

I followed the recipe as written, but my cream cheese topping was like liquid when I cut into it. It chilled in the fridge all day too. I cannot figure out what went wrong. No one liked it. They all complained it was too sweet.

All can say is OMgosh, this is AWESOME! I could eat the entire pie by myself!  I did as some other reviewers suggested, and baked the crust for a few minutes first. I realized that may have been a mistake later on, because the topping didn't extend to the edges, and the top and bottom didn't really came together like it looked in the picture. But my oh my, this is so delicious!  Next time I'm not going to prebake and see what happens.

Did not care for this too much. Just was't very good to me. The fillin was too custardy, and Even though I baked it untl the top was a nice golden brown, and seemed done, the filling oozed out as soon as I cut into it. And the crust was more like cake, then an actual pie crust.

This is very good!  Since I had so many people to feed I doubled the recipe and made a 11x13.  Everyone loved it!  It's not very sweet, so even my non dessert friends really like it.  I tried the strawberry version as one reviewer suggested and it was good but I used frozen strawberries as the other reviewer did and it turned out way too runny!  Use only fresh!  It turned out tasty, but I think everyone liked the peach version better.

This was good. I followed others advice and cooked the crust for 10 minutes prior to adding peaches.  I think this worked out well.  I would have preferred a little extra flavor throughout the dessert though, like possibly some cinnamon in the peaches.  It was light and easy to make.  I had doubled the batch like others had recommended and it made a lot.  Would be perfect for a potluck.

This was good, but I thought there was WAY too much cream cheese topping. In fairness, I used a 9 x13 oval casserole dish (because I doubled the recipe) which probably wasn't the best in hindsight. It made the toppings pile onto each other in bigger layers rather than have nice, thinner layers that run into each other. Next time, I will use a 9x13 rectangular dish. Also, I used fresh peaches, which was delish, however next time I will use more. I used 3 cups sliced fresh peaches for a double batch but I'd recommend using about 5 cups. 

I followed other reviewers advice and baked the "crust" for 10 minutes before adding the peaches - which turned out great. But when I doubled the cream cheese mixture and put it on, it was so thick it was almost like a merengue! Maybe this was just because of my dish - but next time I'll probably use about half of the cream cheese that's called for.

Everyone liked it, both warm and cold. I preferred it warm. I also thought the cream cheese flavor was a bit overpowering. Would make again if I could find a way to take the cream cheese edge off a little.

This pie is to die for.  I have made it as written and it is so yummy.  I have also done with fresh peaches which is best in my opinion.  I added about 1/4 cup very ripe peaches to the cream cheese mixture and blended until smooth and just chopped about 5 or 6 peaches for the rest of the recipe.  AMAZING!  Surprisingly easy to make as well.  THANKS for sharing!

Made this yesterday. It's delicious! It is really "crustless", so if you want, pour into a crust then bake. We thought it would work well with cherries too.

What a phenomenal recipe!My family really enjoyed every bite.I added a 1/2 c. sugar to the crust the second time I made it and it was absolutely even more scrumptious!We liked it warm,but so much better chilled.Crust is like a cobbler,but slices up nice like a pie.Will be making this for all my luncheons....thx!

This is really GOOD.  I've made it twice now as birthday pie.  Both were received with strong approval.  The second pie I used sliced and sugared fresh peaches.  That really put it over the top.  Serve with vanilla ice cream for that extra treat.

I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9x13 glass dish.  Ended up with far too much cake on the bottom.  Next time I will make 1 1/2 recipe of the crust, 3 cans of peaches & double the topping.

Very nice.  Made in the 9x13 with 3 29oz cans of peaches and doubled everything else.  Would not have ever been able to guess the crust ingredients from taste - it is great.  Thanks for sharing!

This pie is absolutely amazing!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated but I baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the peaches and it wasn't soggy at all.  I also made it in a springform pan instead of a pie pan. Next time I make this I am going to use a can and a half of peaches, but it was delicious with just a can of peaches, so it really comes down to personal preference.

OH My !! This is YUMMY.....I tried it both warm and chilled. And it definately was better chilled:)I know it may be hard baking something so scrumptious and then having to wait to chill it. But... it's definately worth the wait!

Wonderful! I took some advice from the other reviews and pre baked the crust for 10 min brushed with egg whites and baked for 5 more. I also didn't use all of the crust mixture thinking it would be too thick for my 9.5in pan. I also added a tbs of brown sugar to sweeten it and a tsp of ginger. With the cream cheese topping i added a tsp of vanilla. Wonderful Wonderful pie!

OMG, this was sooo delicious. I followed the recipe just as it called for.  It turned out good. I think it's more like a cake cobbler though. Any way call it what you like. It's good! We ate the entire pie in one night!

I've made this recipe several times and it is always received well.  I find that the pie "sets" better when it has been chilled.  I've tried serving as it cooled from coming out of the oven, and although it was yummy and loved, it had not had time to form well so was not very pretty for presentation purposes.  Will definately continue to make as it is a family favorite.

If I would have rated this the first day, I would have only given it a 3, maybe 4 stars. It's really not a true pie, it's more of a sloppy coffee cake or a torte. The cake part, the "crust", was not sweet enough for me and tasted really strange. I did use butter pecan instant pudding and maybe that had something to do with the off taste, though the texture of the "crust" was fine. So anyway, at first my thought was, "it's ok, but I wouldn't make it again". However, after letting it sit overnight and having a piece the next morning, it was better. Then, I covered it and put it in the fridge and didn't have any until the next day. After 2 days in the fridge, it was FABULOUS! The flavors all blended, the crust didn't taste funny anymore, and I probably ate 1/4 (of the double recipe I made in 9x13) myself. Then the rest of the family finished it off after my raving about how good it was. Most baked things taste best fresh and quality goes down with age. This one does the exact opposite and gets better. It's a strange dessert, but DEFINITELY worth making.

I think I figured it out.  I did not use a 10 inch pan(My fault)- I used a 9 inch deep dish. What a disaster.  After 35 minuted I could tell the middle was still extremely soupy so I ended up baking for a total of 50 minutes and it did not burn but was still completely gushy in the middle.  I figured maybe it needed to cool and "set" over night in the fridge or something.  Nope. Still liqiudy 10 hours later.  I followed EXACT I thought.  Didn't realize the pan size.  My ovens are accurate and I've been baking since I was 9.  I know what I'm doing.  I'll give it two stars hoping it was just the pan size confusion but I doubt it.

This is a great recipe - company loved it and requested the recipe. * I did use a springform pan - and a bit more peaches. * I used a combo of peaches from the frozen fruit section and canned.  The frozen ones were a bit more tart, but tasty in this. * Worked well with packaged pudding with splenda as well as splenda for baking substituting for sugar as a few in the crowd were diabetic * I also used reduced fat cream cheese without a problem * Next time I would like to make it with apples. I think it would work very well.

I don't care whether you call it a pie or not.  I just call it good and I don't care much for canned peaches!  I used instant pudding (all I had) and added it after I had mixed all the other ing together for the 2 min.  I also threw the sugar and juice in with the cream cheese before I whipped the cream cheese (not paying attention, but I don't think it made a difference).  Can't imagine what it would of been like if I followed the recipe.  The only change I will make the next time is to cut the peaches up first, or I might just use another fruit instead.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe was just okay.  I baked it in a tart pan and it made a very pretty presentation.  I did not like the flavor of the bottom crust and I thought the cinnamon/sugar mixture clashed with the flavor of the peaches.

I think the first thing I'd say about this is that it shouldn't have "pie" in the title - that made my family (and me) expect a pie-like crust. The crust reminded me of a custard-y or bread pudding texture and by itself, it simply wasn't very tasty. I also noticed that some pieces had thicker sections of crust vs. filling and that also wasn't tasty. I would say that the cream cheese inside part was pretty good. So all this said, don't expect this to be like a pie but rather a custardy bread pudding. If I make this again, I will halve the crust and double the filling part and call it a cheesecake-like dessert thingy :)

Very impressive. "I've thinked I'ved died and gone to heaven", were my mom-in-laws words. Used a 9 1/2 glass pie die and this came out just like the picture. I just left out about 1/3 cup of the crust batter and pre-baked it close to 10 minuetes. Everything else I kept the same.

Mmmmm. Puts peach cobblers to shame, haha. The crust is uniqe, cakey-pudding-y, and envelopes the peaches. The cream cheese topping is perfect: you get the fabulous flavor without it overwhelming the whole pie. I'd love to try this with mandarin oranges/pineapple, and topped with toasted coconut, but this pie needs no changes for a first-rate dessert. Thank you very much for sharing :)

This recipe was fabulous! I followed some suggestions and pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes and drained the peaches thoroughly. We ate this dessert warm. Amazing! One day if I'm patient I may try it chilled! Excellent! Thank you!

Turned out well, made it as recipe was written and didn't feel the crust needed to be pre-cooked.  A bit too much cinnamon and sugar on the top- I really liked it, but I'd probably reduce it by half.  Also I needed to cook it the full length of the cooking time for the center of the cream cheese to set.

This is my favorite dessert recipe so far! I was worried the cream cheese mix wasn't going to set but after about an hour and a half in the fridge it was PERFECT! I used about 3 small fresh peaches and mixed the cream cheese with peach preserves instead of syrup. VERY RICH! Very sweet. More like a peach cake with cream cheese frosting/cheesecake. Not a "pie". AMAZING! I want to eat the entire thing right now. Will make again. Might try with apple as hubby is not a huge cooked peach fan. THANKS!

Pretty good but not what I was looking for.  The "crust" was too cakey. I will probably make the filling again and try it in a regular pie crust.

Kind of an interesting recipe, I don't think I'd win any blue ribbons with it though. I decided to make this to use up some spiced peaches that got bought by accident instead of plain, I figured the cinnamon topping would go with the spiced peaches. This definitely reminds me of cobbler when I'm eating the "crust" part (the dough isn't very sweet) and cheesecake when I'm eating the middle (the cream cheese part is *very* sweet, my teeth hurt). I don't hate it but I'm not sure I'll make it again. It would probably be a good potluck dish.

MMMMM! I used fresh peaches and sprinkled extra sugar and cinnamon on them before I spread on the cream cheese layer. I live at 7000 feet and usually have problems with baked recipes but this turned out perfect. Maybe next time I will double the cream cheese mixture...just because I love it. Also, I used a springform cheesecake pan as I didn't have a big enough pie pan, worked great and set up very well.

Great taste, not so pretty.  Wish I'd read the reviews first.  Next time will bake the "crust" for 10 min before adding toppings, then maybe add a few more peaches to completely cover the diameter.  I will add another 1/2 or whole package of cream cheese in order to cover the peaches (and adjust it's sugar accordingly).  I would also use only half a teaspoon of cinnamon for the topping.

We thought this recipe was okay - not really good, but not really bad, either.  The cream cheese mixture with the peaches tasted wonderful; it was the crust we didn't care for.  I think it would taste alot better in a traditional pie crust.

I have been making this pie for over a year and it is  a huge hit everytime.  My hushand who doesn't even care for peaches LOVES this pie. My mother who is a great southern cook and is known for her fruit pies and cobblers request that I make this at family gatherings. This is a fantastic pie!! Give it a try you will not be disappointed.

Well this definately was NOT a pie but it was tasty. It wasn't as great as some are rating. I'm glad I read the other reviews as I got some tips. I used a spring form pan and baked the crust for 10 minutes. It looked really nice though some others said it didn't look appealing. My husband loves pie..and he rated this 3 stars. I think I will try again this summer with some fresh blueberries.

Granted i am still learning to baker harder and more challenging desserts and whatnot, however it would have been helpful if she would have told you that you needed a crust for this pie to begin with - even though I did use one, the recipe does not call for it.  I found that the crust did not bake thoroughly and when it comes from the oven or frig. the pie just falls apart.  I had to scrabble it up and put it in a casserole dish and rebake it to get anyone to eat it.  It has awesome ingredients though and think that it can be rewritten to better produce a PIE not cobbler/cake mess.

Very good.  I used 5 fresh peaches and 3 Tbs of peach jam instead of canning juice.  I also used light cream cheese.  My family enjoyed this recipe.

Oh my goodness... this was a hit! I made this for friends coming over for dinner... used thinly sliced real peaches (even left the skin on). I did use peach juice from the can. Let the crust bake 10 mins and then put everything else on. Everyone loved it, esp the guys.. they went back for seconds. Thank you!

This is so darned good, I can't even describe it! It's really more of a cobbler than a pie, and the word here is scrumptious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I made mine in a 9x9" square baking dish. I did bake it longer than directed, about 45 minutes because some reviewers said the batter wasn't done in the middle. Wonderful recipe. I am going to try it with fresh peaches when they come in season.

This was good, a little sweet for my taste, but everone else finished theirs.  I had even cut down on the sugar by about 1/8th cup. My picky husband said it was "REALLY GOOD".  I think it would be great with a tangier fruit, rasberries or blackberries perhaps.  Great crust, I can use that for a lot of different desserts.  Thanks!  (Ooopps!  Tried it with frozen (thawed and drained) fruit and it was really soggy - watch that variation!)

This was nice but i had the same mushy crust problem as some others.  I used the instant pudding mix.  A couple reviewers say to be sure and use NON instant.    AH HA! I just double checked the recipe...which states NON INSTANT mix.
HOWEVER, if you have purchased and are using the TNT allrecipes cookbook it lists INSTANT pudding mix in the ingredients.  I will try again and see if this remedies the problem.

This was a pretty good recipe, I'd give it 31/2 stars actually, but I don't think it's a five-star recipe.  I followed the advice of baking the crust for ten minutes before pouring in the filliing, and everything turned out perfect.  A bit bland for my taste, it needs something extra.

This isn't really a pie, it's more like a cake. This is an ok recipe, but not terribley impressive. I would definatly make this again for my family at home, but not something I would take to work or have at a party. This tastes good, but not impressive.

This recipe was simply delicious!  It tastes just like the cobbler that my grandmother used to make.  Very rich and very tasty.

I did, however, make one change to it.  I cooked it in a casserole dish and served it as a casserole.  It was excellent!

This pie is wonderful! I can see why it has won awards. Seven of us tried it and all of us loved it. One person thought it would be excellent if only it had whipped cream on top. This is a great pie to take to a pot luck, I'm sure you will get rave reviews from most people. Take a can of whip cream for those who think it would be better with it.

Great tasting pie and easy to make. Unfortunately my family had the same complaint as many other reviewers...they didn't care for the texture. I baked the pie according to directions and refrigerated it for four hours before serving. It was still a little "goopy" though. I'm not sure how the problem can be corrected.

Definitely would not make again. I had all the ingredients, followed every direction. Pie looked okay, just thought there was no reason to put cream cheese on top of the peaches. Killed the sweetness quotient.

My family LOVES this pie.  I had to make five of them in a two week period.  Definitely a favorite in our house.

made this for my husbands birthday. good, not knock your socks off good, but just good. i think this recipe would be really good with cherries instead of peaches. i accidently added a whole stick of butter rather then the 3 tablespoons, and it didn't hurt it a bit. I did cook it for 20 minutes longer then called for, after noting that other people had done the same. I would also reccomend that if you make it, use more peaches, this didn't seem to have enough.

This recipe passed the "picky husband test". It's easy to prepare and I love the batter-style crust. The only change I made was an increase in the baking time(45 min. as opposed to the 35min. recommendation). Thanks for a great dessert.

Oh, yeah.  This was good.  It really didn't seem like a "pie" to me, so I made it in an 8 x 8 square pan...but its a crime for this dessert to be so small.  It needs to be doubled in a 9 x 11.  This is a definite keeper.

Giiirrrrlll! I am mad at you:) This dessert is the BOMB!  It was easy to make. I basically just followed the recipe.  I read some of the reviews about the gummy crust-the crust was soft in the middle but done. I did have to cook it longer(20 mins?) but I used a 9.5" deep dish pan and it turned out nicely.I added vanilla to the cream cheese and pinches of cinn. nutmeg, and ginger to the peaches. I was looking for the ugly but it didn't turn out badly at all.  This is a definite keeper.

This is a wonderful cross between a cobbler and a cake.  This will be a hit for those who are not fond of traditional pie crust.  I noticed some complaints in the reviews about the time it takes, but I thought it was pretty quick compared to making and rolling out my own crust.  I don't see how this could possibly fit in a standard pie pan.  I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 9X13 pan plus a small individual serving casserole dish.  As forthe concerns about the appearance, I found that it looked nicer when I put some of the sugar-cinnamon mix over the peaches before putting the cream cheese on and then sprinkled it evenly across the top as well.  It gave it a nice, even color.  That took about twice the amount of cinnamon/sugar combo that the recipe called for.  This is a keeper!

This was a wonderful dessert. I brought it to work and the girls enjoyed it. The second time I used chocolate pudding mix, frozen raspberries, and raspberry cream cheese (leaving out the cinnamin/sugar topping). That adaptation was also a hit. I'm looking forward to trying different combinations of fruit and pudding flavors.

My wife and I made this together cutting prep time in half and also using a 10 INCH DEEP DISH PIE PAN.  This is very important as the crust came out absolutely perfect, not runny like others have said.  Everyone thought this was the best pie they have had in quite some time at our July 4th gathering.  We are going to try other fruit such as pears, apples, strawberries, or blueberries for our next attempts.  Fabulous recipe!!!

The first time I made this, I made it in a 9 1/2 inch standard pie pan. It came out with a real thick gummy crust but the filling was real good.  I went out and bought a 10 inch deep dish pie pan and it came out spectacular! You have to make it in the 10 inch DEEP DISH pie pan.  It has become a favorite recipe for my family now.

mmmmmmmmmmm Yummy!!! Made this pie for Christmas.... my family "gulped" it down.  So easy to make; "crust" was delicious - could really taste the vanilla pudding.. Just the greatest.... Now when asked to bring a dessert to any event.... I know what I'll be taking.  Thanks so much for sharing...

the first time I made this I was unsure if I should use a crust so I poured everything into a crust, After baking the pie I realized that the pudding and flour made the crust for you.  Great pie I have made four since thnaksgiving and plan on making more for Christmas

This recipe is wonderful! I took it to a dinner party and was asked by all for the recipe.  I added a tsp. of vanilla to the creamed cheese mixture,served it with vanilla ice cream and drizzled raspberry sauce over the top.  Can't beat this one...Jeanne P.

Wow...this is sensational. I used fresh,
in season peaches from Niagara, Ontario
and it turned out fabulous. It's not only
easy and wonderful to eat, but I'm sure
it would also impress your guests. Do
you have any more recipes like this one
hidden away somewhere? Wow, just great!!

#1 - Do **NOT** use a 9x13" dish; there's not *NEARLY* enough ingredients to make more than a thin pastry, even increasing peach filling 50+%.
#2 - I made this with fresh, locally-picked, fruit. Without the  sugary syrup, the filling was less sweet; if this should be unwelcome, adding some simple syrup would address this.
#3 - To compensate for the lack of syrup in the cream cheese element, I mixed in 1/2 C of puréed fruit; it was an inspired modification !!

Delicious. I’ve been craving peaches for a while and this hit the spot. I didn’t change a thing other than subbing gluten free flour for regular flour so my step daughter could have it too. She also loved it-we all inhaled it!

It was a great summer for peaches. I went thru my yearly recipe rotation and rather than make them again I tried a few new ones. This recipe was amazing, I loved it, my family loved it. We loved it a second time and if there were more peaches I would have made it again. Here I am, dreaming of 'old fashioned peach cream pie'. Its late December, peach season is 6-7 months away!! THANK YOU DEBBIE!!! Here are my personal notes: used 4 cups fresh. peeled/sliced added sugar. let set - capture and reserve syrup. mixed the syrup into creme cheese topping. baked longer than stated

I was disappointed in this recipe.   based on what other reviewers said and the ingredients list should have turned out a lot better. I followed the directions exactly.  The crust tasted like Bisquick.  This was just a so-so recipe for me.

Don’t change anything! 
I,like so many others, usually change recipes when I make them. I read many of the reviews for this. Some said do a 10 minute pre-bake of the “crust” among other suggestions.
The ONLY change I made was using fresh peaches instead of canned since I had a flat of Costco peaches that needed to be used up. I peeled and sliced them. Put them in a strainer over a measuring cup and added the tiniest bit of sugar to help extract the juice. Everything else was done EXACTLY as the recipe stated and the pie came out beautiful and delicious. My husband said “man,this is good. It’s a keeper!”

This is a lovely pie! It sounds almost too good to be true, but I also won a contest when making this pie for the first time. It was an amateur pie-baking competition for work and I chose this recipe, and was blown away when I actually won! It has just the right amount of sweetness. I followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time because others recommended contradictory changes. I would definitely recommend using a deep dish glass pie pan -- I only had a regular 9 inch and it slightly spilled over the edge. I left an inch at the edge when spreading the cream cheese mix, but it didn't expand, so I think you can spread it to the edge if you want, but it looks nice when you can see the peaches below at the edges. It cooked up really well at 30 minutes -- the bottom layer crust was fully cooked, not over-cooked or blackened in any way. I don't really think the pie can accommodate many more peaches at this size.

This is absolutely as great as everyone says.  I've made it four times now.  First, I made it exactly as directed.  Then I incorporated some of the tips from other users.  

I would recommend the original recipe, with these suggestions:

1.  Cook crust for 8 minutes by itself.  Remove from over and coat with egg whites.  Then cook for another five minutes.  As pointed out by others, this will help prevent a soggy crust.

2.  Double the peaches.  (This is a must.  Not 1 1/2 times, but a full double.)

3.  Double the cream cheese mix recipe.  

4.  After the cream cheese mix is very well beaten (I use my KitchenAid stand mixer) lightly toss in the peaches which have been rinsed and dried.  (Again, preventing excess wetness into the crust.)

5.  Add all mix into your half-baked crust.  Then, bake the entire pie for a full 35 minutes.

6.  Remove from the oven and dust with cinnamon and white powdered sugar.

7.  Chill overnight.

To me, these seven slight modifications will turn out the finest version of this pie you can imagine!

Good luck!

I have been making this exact recipe for over 30 years.
It was in a Watsons catalog that came with some pudding, vanilla and cinnamon that I had purchased at a Watkins home party. It is a fantastic recipe and definitely a blue ribbon winner.....for Watkins!

Try this variation of what has become my favorite go-to recipe. Fresh tasting and made of pantry items. What could be better? Try half the peaches and two cups of fresh blueberries sprinkled over them for the fruit layer. Fabulous.

I made this pie for a Labor Day cookout.  I followed the directions to a tee with absolutely no variations, right down to the ten inch pie plate.   I don't like giving someone's creation a poor review, but like one of the reviewers said, I was somewhat embarrassed when I cut it.  First of all, I made it the day before the cookout so it could chill overnight and it took over an hour to cook and my oven bakes perfectly.  Finally, I had to the oven up to 360 to get the cream cheese and sugar topping to brown.  It smelled good and it looked good after baking for that hour.  When I cut into it, it was very "lean" in terms of the filling and the "crust" was like some others have said, gooey.  Every one ate it, but nobody said anything about it.  Thankfully, one of the guests had brought some lemon squares so I put one of  those on each of the dishes of "pie."  If I ever make this again, I will use a standard pie crust and see what happens.  That is if I decide I want to risk it, but it won't be when we're having company until it's been tested by just the two of us.

I made this according to a user review with a doubled recipe and a 9x13 pan and it was AMAZING! It was a huge hit at our summer BBQ and I will definitely make this again!

Not as amazing as I thought it was going to be, but pretty tasty. I listened to some of the reviewers and chopped up (only some) of the peaches and put it in the cream cheese. I would have to say I will do all of them next time. Whole peach slices are just too big. The flavor is pretty good, but maybe add some to the actual pie instead of just on top.

Amazing! Delicious. Made it and cleaned up all while my toddler napped with time to spare. Used a 9 in springform pan. No one mentioned how to spread the crust so I will. Since a springform is much deeper than a deep pie dish just spread the crust batter on the bottom of a greased springform pan and up on the side about 2 inches.

My husband LOVES this! Says it is his favorite dessert. Same way I make it except I use a small can of peaches and substitute fresh, plus I add a little more peaches than the recipe calls for. We like it very "peachy". I highly recommend trying this!

I've made this twice now and both times it was a huge hit! So simple but really flavorful! The first time I ate it warm from the oven. The second time I ate it chilled. I liked it both ways. Will definitely keep this recipe in my weekly rotation. A crowd pleaser. I accidentally put 1 tablespoon cinnamon on top instead 1 teaspoon and my mistake was a pleasant one. I enjoyed the added spice!

Chalk up another award for this recipe. My son and I participated in a "CHOP" type competition where we were given 3 items and told to make any kind of desert. We picked your recipe and we're very glad we did. We won!! And, according to the judge, it was no competition!  We followed the recipe exactly but we had to add animal crackers, so we crushed them and sprinkled them on top. Everyone loved the crunch on top, so I guess that was a good idea. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, which we WILL be making again.

This is a FABULOUS recipe. I would call it a peach buckle rather than a pie, but it is delicious whatever you want to call it!  My changes were extremely minor: I used 1.5 times the peaches called for (so add a small can of peaches to the large), and I added some almond extract to the cream cheese mixture.  That's it..the recipe is perfect other than that.  It is not overly sweet, bakes up to a lovely "buckle" and is my favorite thing to pair with my morning coffee at the moment!  My boyfriend LOVES it and I plan to make it often!

I’ve made this many times now. My husband and I love it and most of all All of my kids love it too! It’s not too sweet and very yummy! I have made this with fresh peaches , canned and canned with extra frozen peaches. I like to add additional peaches and the combo of canned and frozen the best in my opinion. Happy baking!!

Terrific dessert, easy to make, and unusual. A lot of reviewers have had trouble because it's hard to find a 10" deep-dish pie dish, and the pie really doesn't work well in a regular pie dish. I found the recipe works perfectly in one of those pie dishes that is 10" at the top but only 9" at the bottom. So the bottom is just 9" just like regular pie dishes, but it's deep, and the top is 10". I was so worried it wouldn't turn out, but it was truly perfect. I've made it three times now, and it is even better with canned apricots. The only thing is that this pie is a bit sweet for some people, so now I reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. The pudding mix is plenty sweet enough. If you're not a fan of very sweet desserts, you can even reduce to 1/4 cup and it will still be good. But do NOT skip the cinnamon/sugar topping. It is a very important part of the pie.

This was a great recipe. It was simple and came out great! I think it's more cake-like than pie-like though because the "crust" is very fluffy and spongey. I baked it for 34 minutes and I found that it was the perfect amount of time. Great for a light summer dessert!

This would be 6 star in the winter  when I don't have a tree full of fresh peaches I am trying to find good recipes for.  Other reviewers says it is more of a dessert and a pie and I do agree.  It is lovely but I prefer to use canned or home canned peaches in the off season and fresh in the summer

For ease, a 5 star, for taste, a 4 star.  I like a traditional pie a little better-on the other hand two people asked me for the recipe, and when I forgot to send it to them they both emailed asking for it again.

I made this luscious pie tonight but had to use my 9 1/2 inch pie pan since I didn't have a 10 ". I used fresh frozen peaches without any juice, so I pureed a few with a little water to put in the cream cheese mixture. It turned out wonderful. It did run over the dish some but not much. This is a keeper recipe! My guest loved it.

This was a super easy recipe and perfect to make with my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  We added a drop of almond extract to make it a little different.  After they cooled we frosted them and added sprinkles.  We only baked for 8 minutes and they came out soft and buttery!  I will definitely be making these again!

We used a graham cracker crust, and everything turned out delicious. I preferred it chilled, but my friend preferred it at room temperature, so that all depends. Overall, wonderful pie, fantastic recipe; everyone who tried it raved about it!
The second time I made it, I didn't have quite the right ingredients--instead of 3 oz of non-instant vanilla mix, I only had 1 oz of instant vanilla mix. In order to counteract the reactions, I added an additional 1/2 cup milk, and once again, the pie was a hit.

I can see why this is an award winning pie.  I am not a huge fan of canned peaches, but this pie was delicious.  I couldn't even wait for it to cool all the way, and I actually preferred it around room temperature.  I think that this would also work well with apples in the fall as well as raspberries or blueberries right now.  I wil probably try this recipe again soon using a berry combination.  Thanks for posting this - it is fabulous!

Debbi was right; this does win awards.  I was entered into a small piate-baking contest at work - somebody else entered me - and I won!  Since I do a fair amount of baking I usually tinker with recipes but not this one except maybe a tad more cinnamon in the topping.  What I like about this one is the use of canned fruit - I'm no good at picking out good fresh peaches.  Also, this obviously can be made when peaches aren't in season. This one is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Debbi for sharing.  mlwillard

I did not alter the recipe except for using a spring form pan instead of the pie pan.  It was pretty good but we think it would be perfect with apples instead of peaches.  Will try next time.

I like the dessert warm. I didn't like it cold at all. I followed the suggestions of the other users and doubled the recipe. I cooked the crust for 5 mins and then added the peaches. I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 mins. I don't think I'll be making this again. It just didn't tickle my taste buds.

YUMMY for my tummy.  I donated one of these to a Pie Social, they were raising money for a building in our old village..  The ladies who were hosting it, couldn't resist, they bought it and ate it right there!  Just follow the directions very carefully - tried it later with Strawberries, not as good..  I really liked it with peaches!

I've made this three times now and it's gotten rave review from everyone!!  I too have gone a step further and made a strawberries and cream version and I think they liked that just as much if not better than the peach.  I WILL make this again.

This was so easy to make and the flavor was amazing I followed the recipe unchanged except I used fresh peaches instead of canned. For us, the cake like crust with the pie like center and the tasty cream cheese topping made the pie and I will make this to the recipe when I make this pie next time.

We couldn't hold ourselves back and first tasted this while it was still warm from the oven.  I was a little disappointed.  The next night, after it had chilled in the fridge, we ate it again.  Wow, delicious!  As difficult as it is, make sure to let this chill completely!  EDIT: I wanted to make something sweet for my diabetic mother, so I switched in Splenda, sugar free vanilla pudding mix, skim milk, "light" canned peaches, and reduced fat cream cheese.  It was still amazing!  My oldest nephew called it "award-winning," and he didn't even know the name of the recipe!

This is one of the best pie/torte recipes ever! I took this to a family gathering and everyone raved about it, people fought over the last piece. This is a no-fail, very easy recipe, I highly recommend it. Be sure your bottom layer is fully cooked before you add the peaches! It will come out perfectly!

I loved this recipe as did the people who tried it at a recent function.  I received multiple requests for the recipe.  I made the recipe as is except I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan instead only because I didn't have a deep dish 10" pie pan.  I'll definitely make again, no changes needed.  It's easy!

I love this dessert! It is super easy to make and people just eat it up when ever I make. I have in the past doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10x13 glass baking dish. One other thing about this recipe, is all the ingredients are usually stocked in my pantry and refrigerator.

Very tasty, especially while it's still warm from the oven.  I would recommend only making this one if there are enough people to finish off the pie.  Though quite moist the first day, it really dried out over night.

This is a wonerful recipe! I made this for a pie contest and won first place made exactly as the recipe stated. I used fresh Michigan peaches that I had mixed in sugar and froze this summer. I made this again and doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan for dessert at a Craft Bazaar and it was a hit. It was all gone by noon. I added 1/3 c. sugar to the crust mixture and only sprinkled lightly the cinamon suagr mixture on top. I did not prebake it, but just baked it until the center was not jiggly around 55-60 minutes.

Wonderful!  This was very easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I took this to a potluck and got numerous requests for the recipe.  I doubled the original recipe and made it in a 9x13.  There was not a bite left at the potluck!

It's TRUE!  This pie won 2nd place amongst 20 pies at a church cookout!  It was easy and very good.  Perfect for any time of year, thanks to the canned peaches.  Love it!

This pie is a great twist from the normal peach cobbler. It looks and smells great! The only thing I would do differently is cut back on the salt (I used 1/2 tsp. kosher salt instead of regular salt). I could definitely taste the salt in the crust. I followed the recipe exactly and everything else was fine.

Love it! I made it in the springform pan and used fresh peaches. This stuff is so good I could not wait for it to cool all the way I ate it while it was still warm. The best peach cobbler/pie dessert ever!

Wow, what a mess! The crust wouldn't bake all the way through, the cream cheese leaked all over (even though it had the 1-inch space), and it was soggy and goopy in the middle. It was WAY too sweet, and didn't taste much like peaches. I was disappointed because it sounded so good.

This is easily the best peach dessert I've ever had!  I've made it many, many times following the recipe as it is written and it's always fantastic.   I noticed a few reviewers suggest baking the crust before adding the peaches but I don't think that's necessary.  Mine always turns out perfectly!  Next time I'm going to try doubling the recipe and baking in a 9x13 pan because there's never enough :)

What a great pie!  The crust is very different.  I did bake it for 10 minutes before adding the peaches and the filling.  I did not use extra peaches, but I wish I did.  The crust kind of "swallows" them.  I chose this recipe because it uses canned peaches, but this summer I'll try it with one can plus some fresh.  I think it will be even more amazing!

This was FANTASTIC!  I basically followed the instructions as written, though I did as one reviewer suggested and added a few more peaches.  I was going to pre-bake the "crust," but changed my mind at the last minute, and it still came out wonderfully.  The only small issue I had was with the cream cheese--it says to spoon it onto the top, but I found it a bit thick and it just kind of plopped into the pie and didn't spread well.  It was tasty, but still seemed a bit disproportianate with the bulk of the cream cheese mix settled in the center.  I did exactly as the recipe said, so I'm not sure if anyone else has had this issue (haven't seen it in the reviews, so maybe it was just me!), but it's something I'll play with next time.  And there will definitely be a next time!  I chilled it after baking...I warmed mine and it was awesome, and others ate it chilled and loved it just as much.  Added a dollop of Cool Whip...heaven.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I thought it was great. I added 1 tsp. of ginger and that really enhanced the peach flavor. Love the "surprise" crust, too!

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 glass dish. I left out the cinnamon and still...it seemed like too many flavors and not enough texture. The canned peaches weren't a good compliment to the soft crust and gooey topping. It was almost like a "dump cake" to me. The cream cheese layer was good.

My husband really enjoyed this and I thought it was pretty tasty too. I did follow another reviewers advice to put sugar over sliced fresh peaches and then let it sit for a while to make the syrup. Good advice, I like fresh peaches.

I think this was okay as a dessert, but it had a more cake-like than pie-like consistency.  I think it was just that I wasn't expecting the consistency.  Also, I think fresh peaches would improve this.

This is a good pie/cobbler, but I don't think it's deserving of a 5-star rating because the taste just didn't grab me.  I think the canned peaches detracted somewhat, so next time I'll probably use fresh peaches instead.

Caveat: we did the "bake the crust 10 mins first" tip as suggested by many to avoid sogginess, so take this with that grain of salt.  
This recipe was strange.  Certainly not a pie in any regards and the flavor/texture combination was not the best.  My father loved the tangy peach taste to cut the sweetness of the cheesecake part.  The rest of us thought it was okay, but weird. And the bottom was remniscent of cornbread or pound cake.  It just didn't all fit together for me.  Not terrible, but just not what I was expecting at all.

Delicious and perfect the way it is--didn't change a thing.  My family loved it, and said it was even better the next day, after having been refrigerated overnight.  I will make this again for sure!  Thanks for a great and unique recipe.

I made this pie for my dad's birthday. he LOVED it! I will definitely make it again, but next time I think I will try to bake the crust for about 10 to 15 minutes before I put the peaches on top.

I think I baked it a little longer than the recipe called for and drained the peaches overnight, and this turned out really well.  Everyone liked it.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe...so DELICIOUS!!!  I've actually doubled the recipe before and made it in a square pan for a larger group. It is very easy/simple to make and everyone I've made it for so far seems to love it as well.  Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely awesome. I took the advice of another reviewer and used half of the cream cheese and substituted the other half for sour cream. I also used raspberry flavored peaches. The cinnamon didn't brown like others have said, and so it turned out perfect. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe. I can't wait to serve it at my next function!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but to my surprise, the pudding part was very runny even after being chilled overnight (I found this out when I tried to serve it).  Maybe I didn't beat it enough? or maybe because we're getting close to a high altitude here? or maybe I didn't bake it enough? although it was sure golden brown after 35 min., as per the instructions--in fact, the cinnamon/sugar mixture became really dark when it baked and I was afraid it would burn if I left it in any more.  The flavor was good, and everyone liked it, but it was a real mess to serve--just fell apart.

This pie is incredible.  It's awesome.
This is the best I have ever made.  I didn't have a pie plate, so I doubled the recipe and used a baking pan and it was just perfect.  I had company for dinner today and they just raved and raved about it.  I can see how it won an award.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Made me feel proud of myself.  Thanks again.

AWESOME!  I think this is one of the best desserts I've ever had.  I didn't change much except that I used a 9" pie plate instead of a 10" and it still worked great.  Thanks for sharing this!!

I really liked this desert!  I wouldn't call it a pie though!  It was so simple, and delicous, evryone had seconds.  Next time, to make it a bit "prettier" I may use brown sugar sugar instead of white on the top, and reduce the sugar/cinnamon topping, so that the cream cheese layer turns golden and you can see it.  Other than it not being a "jewel" in the beauty department, this was really good!

Wow, this tasted SO good. I made it for Easter and made a bunch of other pies so this didnt get eaten like it would have if i only made this for dessert. The cream cheese tastes SO good. I would omit cinnamon and sugar, i didnt like it on the topping. I made it in a square 8 x 8 pan instead because i ran out of pie pans and it was just as good. I would next time cut the peaches up at least into thirds. The huge peach pieces gross me out, just too big and too much. I also topped it with cool whip topping to make it look prettier, it doesnt look all that great without it. Taste is REALLY unexpected and different. VERY good. 5 Stars and will make it again.

Delicious!  I've made this many times.  I have doubled the recipe and made it in a 9" x 13" pan for a crowd.

Horrid!  I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS RATED 5 stars! 

I love peaches, but the canned peaches in this do not help the flavor here.  Also, the boxed pudding flavor in the crust did not taste correct..very artificial tasting.  This might work out better ONLY with freshly home canned peaches or Lady Alberta peaches, but if you're going to go to the trouble, I'd recommend the Peaches and Cream Pie II by Tara instead...which uses fresh peaches and peach jello and you will come out WAAAAY ahead.

I made this recipue tonight, and although it was not "inedible" for my entire family, I had a hard time choking down one small sliver. The crust/cake tasted like cornbread to me. The topping was very good, thats what made the difference between 1 and 3 stars for me, and my husband said it was good, but "not a 5 star pie".  If I were to make this again, i'd add more sugar to the crust/cake mixture, and double the toppings, peaches included.

This is truly an award winning recipe!  I made this pie for the first time this week, entered it into my company's baking contest (which happens to be the parent company of Food Network & HGTV), & surprisingly, I took home the first place prize!  This is definitely a tried and truly delicious recipe!  My only modifications were an additional tablespoon of peach syrup and less 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

This pie was very good but for some reason came out somewhat unattractive. I guess what I would do next time is double the cheese mixture to ake sure the top is completely covered and snow white (with speckled cinnamon) in appearance.

This pie was ok. The crust gives it a more cakey flavor and texture when I was really expecting a peach pie. The part with the cream topping is ok but the rest is pretty bland. It was easy to make and tasted alright but I probably won't make it again.

hmmmm...I'm very surprised this received such great reviews.  For one, it is absolutely nothing like a pie. Secondly, it just doesn't have a ton of flavor.  Too bad!  I was expecting so much from this.  I didn't even want to bring the leftovers to work.  Sorry.

I just made this and it was easy enough to put together, but maybe it is just me but I found that the cream cheese top was way too sweet for my liking so the next time I make it I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

This is a terrific pie!!!  The only change I made was to substitute half and half for the milk (it was 100 degrees outside and I didn't feel like going to the store).  It turned out great anyway and I may make that a permanent change.  Thank you for submitting this recipe, it is delicious!!

Gosh, this is a blast from the past .... I recognize this as an old recipe, one I used to make frequently when I first started cooking/baking 25+ years ago ........ you can't go wrong with this one! Even though it uses convenience ingredients, it still has a great taste and is so easy to put together. I will be making this again soon ...... thanks for posting!

This is a sinful dessert. Creamy, subtly sweet, and the cakey crust is so moist...I made this twice in the same week! As I've mentioned in other reviews, I have a toddler who refuses to eat his fruits and veggies, and he ate a large serving of the peaches with a tiny bit of the cream and a small amount of cake and didn't mind at all-trust me, that's a triumph. He can sense fruits and veggies in ANYTHING. :) My only complaint is that I do live with two boys and they didn't allow me to get nearly enough of this awesome dessert!

This is good,very tasty.The only thing I have to say negatiwe about this recipe is that you can taste the pudding mix in here(that artificial taste if you know what I mean).But like I said it is not bad.I make it occassionally.

This deserves 10 stars!!!! It was so yummy. I took the advice of others and cooked the bottom crust for 10 minutes and then layered the rest of the ingredients and used my springform pan and it came out perfect. Everyone licked their plates clean! I will be making this one again. Thank you  :)

I don't know what happened with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out odd. The bottom was very dense and almost at a playdough consistency, and I cooked it all the way! But the peaches and cream portion was excellent! I will try this recipe again with some of the tips on this page.

This was just o.k.  I followed advice from others and baked the "crust" for 10 minutes prior to adding the filling.  I was hoping for a cheesecakey-peach-pie flavor and did not get that at all.  Instead, it actually kinda tasted like peach pudding or peach mush when it was all done.  I think fresh peaches would make the recipe better or less sugar if using canned.

I am giving this 5 stars because I truly loved the flavor of this dish but the crust was not what I would have expected.  It had no "rise" to it when it baked and very cake like. Maybe I should double it next time?  I too used a spring form pan and baked the crust alone for about 5 minutes before adding everything else.  I used fresh peaches this really is a very good and EASY dessert.  Thanks!!

This was pretty good, and definetly something I wouldn't usually make. I enjoyed it and might make it again warm with some vanilla ice cream. I used a springform pan and blind baked the crust for about 8 minutes, turned out fine. I recommend it

I made this dessert for a potluck. Like others have mentioned in my "haste" I didn't heed the non-instant pudding. I wondered why it didn't pour! Anyway, followed the diretions correctly the second time in the same night and it came out beautifully. Was worried that there would not be enough cream cheese mix but it spreads when it cooks. I added a pint of Haagen Daas vanilla ice cream for extra "ooomph" to top it off with and this went faster than the chocolate dessert I also made! Thanks for sharing!

I don't like peach pie -- or any fruit pie for that matter, however it was amusing to watch my husband and son fight for the last piece -- especially since the last piece was almost 1/2 the pie and I thought plenty for two! Good thing my daughters were gone at the time, it might have led to an all out brawl! They say it is excellent!

This pie is fabulous.  I make it all the time and my family loves it.  My mother-in-law doesn't care what she eats for dinner on mother's day, but she said I MUST make her this pie for dessert . . . it's her favorite!

Thumbs up on the taste, although it has more of a cakelike consistancy. I will make it again, but perhaps to improve it asthetically I will do it as a "square" instead of a pie and serve with whipping cream. (whipping cream makes everything better IMHO)

I am not a big fan of cream cheese or peaches but this pie was a total surprise! I served for my in-laws and my Mother-in-Law actually asked me for the recipe. It was a hit and it wasn't that hard to make at all. I have made this 2 more times since then and it's always a winner.

Very good COBBLER.  Too ugly to serve w/o ice cream, though, IMHO.  Will experiment with serving it inverted, maybe with a peach glaze or something, in hopes of improving the presentation.

I have made this four times, and it seems to come out differently every time.  I'm not sure what happened the last time I made it, but the crust just would NOT cook.  I kept baking it longer and longer and it still was runny.  I ended up having to throw it out.  The first time I made it, it came out pretty good.  I think I will take some of the advise from the others and bake the crust first and then continue with the recipe as written.  Hopefully, with more trials I can perfect it.

When I searched for this recipe, I was looking for a cream pie with peaches and cream cheese, specificially. I had thought it would be a good combination. When I made it the first time, I didn't have the pudding, so I tried to substitute and it turned out really extremely tasty..but the part that was supposed to have the pudding in it was a little dry. I am going to make it again, though. This time I am going to have the right ingredients, which I am sure will make it even better. This is the best pie I have ever had. It is a little more trouble than a simple apple, but it is so worth it.

I gave this 3 stars, not necesarily on taste, but it does not have a nice presentation and the consistancy is unusual, so I would not feel comfortable serving it to many people.  4 of the 6 friends who ate it said it tasted good, it was just unusual.  If you're up for something different, give it a try.  It does taste pretty good, perhaps better as a light summer dessert.  (I used a casserole dish b/c I don't have a deep dish pie plate & it was fine!)

My family liked it but I don't think it's the best. I used fresh peaches and thought the pie was going to be better than with peaches from a can. In fact, peaches were the best part of this pie.

Great doesn't even begin to describe this.....it was "to die for!"  I used a quiche dish because of the straight sides, cooked it for the 35 minutes and it came out perfect!  Definitely a keeper that I'll use over and over again!

I have found it looks better if you add a extra layer of peaches to the top and sprinkel cinnamon on top. This pie took me some time to perfect  now every one wants me to make it at family B B Q's. They cant get enough of it.

This is really great.  My husband even liked it!  I used the peaches canned in pear juice, so I thought that might be what some others said made it turn out runny.  I micro waved some of the juice with cornstarch and added it to the cream cheese mix...No problem.  This is a great dessert.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family thought this was very yummy.  It didn't remind us of a pie so much, but taste is what counts.  I didn't have an available pie dish, so I used a 10" square corning ware dish and it worked out fine.  And as appearance goes, mine looked very nice!  Thanks Debbi for another great recipe to add to my collection!

Debbie, made this for dessert last night. Turned out great.I used a 9x12 aluminum pan because I didn't have a deep dish pie pan and I baked it about 20 minutes longer. Crust was cooked through, top was a nice light brown and the slices were removed from the pan with no problem of sticking. Only minor change I'm making is to add some sugar to crust, prefer a little sweeter myself. This is definetly a keeper for family dinners and pot lucks. Congrats on winning those ribbons and thanks for sharing this one with us. Lynda

I have tried this recipe twice now, and I do not like it at all.  The crust is way too thick, there are not enough peaches, and the cream cheese mixture does little for the pie.  I definitely would not have won an award for this pie.

This pie tasted very good despite it's presentation. But it was really really good. I used corning ware baking dish because I didnt' have the deep dish pie plate. But I think next time I'll use the deep dish pie plate because its easier to remove.:) 
Thank you..I enjoyed it very much

I was disappointed in this pie.  Maybe I did it wrong, but is it supposed to be THAT runny?  It tasted pretty good, but it was kinda gross.  I'm willing to give it another chance.

I used this recipe for a dessert auction at my husband's company--it was the top seller!  My mother has made this pie for as long as I can remember, I was much more impressed until I found out how easy it is!

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone raved about it, especially my husband!!  My Mom just thought it was sooo special.  It makes a beautiful pie, the filling is creamy and divine, the topping very pretty with the sugar and cinnamon.  It was lots of fun making it as well as eating it!  This will be a keeper at our house, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Debbi!  I can see why it has won awards!!

This was an excellent dessert!  This comes from someone who is not big on fruit pies.  I baked it while my guests were having dinner and served it almost immediately after it got out of the oven.  Some people topped it off with French vanilla ice cream.  I have to say that having this as a warm dessert was VERY delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

I had a hard time finding a 10 inch deep pie pan...but finally found a pretty nice one at Kmart(of all places). The Martha Stewart collection has a nice(really deep) beige colored one that worked pefectly for this pie. Now to the pie, I found it to be a little sweet. I would probably use a tart fruit (like blueberries, as suggested by others)next time I make it. I cooked for 10 minutes extra & it came out perfect. This recipe has potential...but I personally would change the fruit.

I loved this pie and my family did too.  I baked it for Thanksgiving dinner and the pie plate was empty in about 5 minutes.  Out of all the sweets we had to choose from everyone wanted this pie.  It was beautiful and golden brown on top and to me it was like peach cobbler with cheescake on top.  I made a few changes, I baked it in a 10" deep dish stone pie Pan.  The stone made it cook evenly. Because the pie pan was larger, I doubled the recipe except for the peaches, I used about
 1 1/2 can of peaches.  I will be making this a regular on our holiday meals.

I have to admit, I was skeptical.  I had no need to be though, this is the best!!  I'm not a big cream cheese fan, but I can't even tell that it is cream cheese.  My family loved it and my kids are so picky, it was amazing.  Will make this over and over again.  Didn't use all of the sugar/cinnamon mixture on the top and increased the pudding mix for the crust.

I made this pie for the first time last Thanksgiving (2000).  Everyone LOVED it.  I found that I had to bake the pie for almost an hour, though.  Not a pie that would be "quick" to assemble, but well worth it for the taste.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you for giving me something to add to my favorite recipe list!!

Oh my, was this ever good.  I've got a sweet tooth and didn't feel it was sweet enough for me, so I added some extra sugar.  Everyone loved it!!!  We've got ample Apricots available right now, so I thought I would try it with them and again, it turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous!!!  Sort of a cross between cheesecake, cobbler & pie.  I used 4 fresh peaches, that worked fine.  I could not find a 10" deep dish pie plate, so I used a 10" plain one.  It spilled over a tad when I used more than 4 peaches, but otherwise worked great.

Took much longer to cook. The bottom crust was chewey. Maybe I did something wrong. I did make it twice so that I had one to sample before taking it to a 4th party.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I found it by doing a search on the Debbi Borsick, as I had recently tried her amazing recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Debbi, you are wonderful!  I baked it for my ex-coworkers and they loved it.  One note though, I am thankful for all the reviews on this recipe.  If I hadn't read the note about using a 10 inch pan, I would have baked it on a normal 9.5 inch pan.  After baking this pie, I know now what's meant by 'gummy crust' and can see how the size of the pan was a factor.  Still, great recipe!

This was a good recipe.  My kids loved it.  If I make it again I will smooth the first layer (vanilla crust) around the bottom more, and up the sides a bit.  It was a bit thick for my taste. Outstanding flavor.

Very tasty, pretty easy to make....really no downside...it is pretty rich.  It tastes like a peach cheese cake.  My 3 1/2 yr old helped....the stirring is a little thick for little hands (berry pies are more popular) :-)  Well worth the effort though.

I made this as an individual servings using muffin pans.  Works really well (especially as a finger dessert) just make sure you don't fill the muffin pan too full or you'll have burned cream cheese topping on you oven floor..I speak from experience.

I've made this twice now as written... the first time was with peaches, the second time was with yams for Christmas. I can't wait to keep trying it with different fillings! Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it.

Oh, i did make it in a square baking dish instead of a round pie pan... got 9 pieces instead of 8!

I’m a bit old school in that I always make the recipe exactly as written for the first time. Although I must admit I’ve spent  a lot of time reading reviews. I really do need to get a life!!
This recipe has been a home run every time I’ve made it. Even a couple of professional cooks asked for the recipe - High  praise indeed. Thx for all the helpful tips. Draining the peaches on paper towels is the key to a great crust.

I have made this every year, for 10 plus years 
We have always made the pie with instant pudding mix, not sure what the difference is in taste, but it’s a DEVINE dish! 
The crust can be tricky and is definitely a personal preference. My brother requests this for his birthday every year; he likes the crust more doughy, so I cook it for less time. 
It truly depends in the size and type of pan used. Doubling the recipe requires way more oven time.

This was totally not I expected.  Using canned peaches didn't  do the justice.  I think fresh peaches are always good.  My family didn't like it either.

Made it to the letter first time! I found my base a touch thick so I added a tablespoon or two more milk the second time I made it but this but then the crust was too soft. Later found Huckleberries work nicely with the peaches. (But if you add more juicy fruit, might want to reduce milk even a bit more) 40 mins at 250F worked best in my oven. Light cream cheese and light syrup Peaches are OK ... if you must.

I made this as a project for class and got really good feedback from it, but I was kinda unsatisfied with its looks, is there any way I could bake the pie without making the cinnamon/sugar on top look burnt?

Why are people talking about the crust, there is no crust in this recipe... it just says to pour the mixture into a pie dish (doesnt say anything about any crust)

Omg this was so good!  Made it for my sister’s birthday and my dad has already requested it for his birthday.

I did not have baking powder but substituted 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tbs lemon juice.  I also added 2-3 tbs of lemon juice to the cream cheese topping (it seemed a bit thick).

I also baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes before adding the peaches (100% juice) and increasing the peaches by one half, as others have suggested.

Served it warm and the top layer was so creamy.  A new family favorite.

The crust was a dry cake/cookie like and horrible. Filling just ok. I made no changes to the recipe. Would not make again. I will stick to the peach kuchen it’s a much better recipe with the same concept but better crust.

I used fresh peaches mixed with sugar. I've also made it with blueberries, pears, strawberries and bananas. I change the pudding flavor to go with what fruit I use.

This recipe needs a couple more stars!!!  Ive been using the same peach pie recipe for twenty years until now!! This truly is an award winning recipe  and my new go-to!! I used fresh peaches, an unsweetened pudding mix, so I added 1/3 cup of sugar and replaced 2 oz of the cream cheese with Greek yogurt. YUMMY!

I used fresh peaches and prepared a peach puree to replace the fruit juice from the canned version..........just pureed peaches which became a liquid.  Turned out great, will definitely make this again!

GREAT desert.  It was good hot too.  It would be easy to make a kito diet version.  I will make again.  I used fresh peaches and will try next with fresh blueberries.  This rises quite a bit in the oven I will use a pan underneath next time.  Not too sweet.  I also substituted 1/2 the flour with almond flower.

This turned out looking exactly like the photo for me. I made it in a quiche dish and baked it for 35 minutes without pre-baking the crust. I used fresh peaches that I let marinate in ginger syrup and honey for a few hours instead of canned peaches. I didn't change anything else about the recipe. It was delicious, especially for those of us who like cream cheese. We ate about half of it warm from the oven.

I made this Gluten Free since I can't have gluten due to an allergy and lower carb. I substituted an ancient grain gluten free flour mix for the flour.  Instead of the pudding I used 2 eggs, 1/4 cup sugar substitute, 1 Tablespoon vanilla, 2 Tablespoons sour cream and 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of the milk. I used fresh peaches and blueberries and 1/4 cup sugar substitute for the 1/2 cup white sugar in the cream cheese.  I like my desserts not as sweet as most people.  I baked it in my deep dish baker from Pampered Chef and it was the perfect size. I can't say if it is as good as the original since I convert it to gluten free, but it turned out delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe and inspiration. I will be making this again and trying different fruits.

Followed the directions exactly.  I baked it for 35 minutes and it was still very runny. Cooked another 30 minutes and still runny. Baked it another 25 and it was starting to set. Another 10 minutes and it was very yummy. Will make again using half the milk suggested.

I made this pie yesterday, despite some less than favorable reviews because it matched the ingredients I had in house at the time.  I made it tick by tick with the recipe and it came out beautiful!  Wasn’t sure how my husband was going to react but, after his 3rd bite, he informed me that this was the best pie I have ever made him!  New family favorite for all upcoming occasions .  Looked this morning, there are only 2 servings left!  GREAT RECIPE. GREAT PIE!  Forgot to take pic before I sliced but here’s when I remembered

This is probably one of the best fruit desserts I've found. My husband loves peach cobbler but all the recipes I've tried are too similar to one another and they just seem to lack flavor and  consistency. I've made this one twice now and it has turned out perfect both times and everyone really liked it. It's also fairly simple to make which is always a plus!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was wonderful! I did double the recipe and used a 9 x13” pan because I knew one wouldn’t be enough!! But other then that I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it, I wouldn’t change a thing. I served it with a touch of whipped cream and it disappeared!! Thanks for sharing ????

We made it a double then topped it with a swirl of raspberry and then covered it with a lattice top. This one goes in our family's recipe book. Blue ribbon all the way baby.

Oh boy this turned out so yummy! I was looking for a peach related recipe and found this and thought it would be good and it sure is! I was a little concerned at the last step with the sprinkling of 1 tbs of sugar + 1 tsp of cinnamon that it was a little too much, but maybe that is how it is supposed to be.

The top 2 layers were delicious but the crust was awful..didn't cook all the way? are you supposed to cook the crust a bit first? I would make it again but put the peaches and topping in a graham cracker crust..mmmm

Just made this today in my large quiche dish. It turned out great and I made no changes to the recipe. I did keep it in the oven for 37 minutes but I usually bake things a bit longer in my oven. Well, I did make one change...I put vanilla in the base as I put it most of my baking. It may not last too long in our house.

I've made this twice, but had to tweak it to take into account the fresh peaches I used. Some changes to be made since I used fresh peaches:

- Substituted the "peach syrup" by processing a whole peach (I had two boxes of peaches)
- Used up to 5 quartered and thinly sliced peaches for the peach layer
- Cut the cake base, halved the recipe for the initial cake base

I havent had the opportunity to make this with canned peaches, but I feel like the processed peach with the cream cheese was phenomenal.

This is the most delicious peach pie that I have ever eaten.  It’s  also very easy to make.  Make it exactly as directed and you won’t be disappointed.  Do make sure your pie dish is a deep one.

Rated it on the picture and reading the recipe. I have a question. Does anyone know why you do not take the cream mixture all the way to the edge of the pie? Curious.

I've wanted to make this since it was featured in Allrecipes magazine using fresh peaches.  I did cut the recipe in half and made it in a smaller Corningware casserole dish.  Both my hubby and I enjoyed this.  I always peruse the reviews before making a recipe to see if there is a common suggestion that is mentioned.  Many people said to bake the "crust" for 10 minutes before adding the peaches, cream cheese mixture, and the cinnamon & sugar topping.   I was set to do that, but then saw a review that stated the recipe is "award winning" made as the recipe is written.  So, I went with following the recipe as given, without baking the "crust" before hand.  I may try it sometime, baking the "crust" for 10 minutes, but honestly, I don't think you need to at all.  And, if peaches are in-season, make this with fresh peaches...oh my, you won't be disappointed!  (In Allrecipes magazine it featured fresh peaches and just used milk in place of the peach juice/syrup.)  Don't forget to allow enough time to chill the pie, thoroughly, before serving. 
Thanks Debbi for the wonderful recipe!

Turned out extremely wet. Crust was not done either.  I thought the baking time was too short.  Should have trusted my gut.  Have no idea why it's so wet.  Standing in liquid.  :(

Better if you let it chill for 24 hours.  4 stars - it's good, but if you're looking for a true pie flavor, this didn't do it for me.  Followed recipe, except for the tip (which is in the AllRecipe magazine) to back the "crust" for 10 minutes.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would definitely!! It is, as my late father would say, "ambrosial!!" Please do not change or substitute any of the ingredients... I don't have a 10" pie plate so used a 9" and made a 'mini pie' in one of my 3"x3" square  Pyrex dishes... I ate half of it warm from the oven and have refrigerated the 9" pie for guests tomorrow. This pie truly lives up to its name. The cream cheese topping is creamy delicious and I think the star-maker for the peaches! I'm going to make this again and again!!!!

It was very easy.  It tasted to my family like a bread pudding.  We prefer a more cobbler like peachy dessert.  It was worth the effort and really good.  Will i make it again....probably not...I'll stick the peach pie and cobbler.

On my first attempt when the store failed to stock 3oz pudding mix I used 3 1oz big mistake. Redid recipe with the correct amount... on my lord.  Whistles went off rockets burst every color in the sky a choir started singing and my wife would not let me have seconds...i’d Say this recipe is pretty  GOOD
Gonna get up in the middle of the nite and make again, and not tell my wife.  O darn it the odor of it cooking woke her up,she took my pie back to bed with her. She going to stay with her sister next week then I’ll get my pie.??

Wonderful!   I bake mine in a preheated cast iron skillet.   I also substituted soy milk for the milk.

Baked at 360. Precooked crust for 5 minutes then made as directed and baked 30 minutes more. As others have said, not a pretty pie. Cooled for 6 hours. Others liked it more than I did. Had a leftover piece two days later and LOVED IT.  So next time I will make it at least one day in advance.

Ummm....wow. This was FANTASTIC! So light and delicious, but sweet and fruity! I won a pie bake-off I had with friends & family! I made the recipe exact...the only thing I would do different is make it the night before and refrigerate it overnight. I did not have enough time to completely cool but it was still delicious. I did sneak a bite of leftovers the next day and thought it was beyond perfection! Thank you for an easy amazing recipe!

This is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Phenomenal flavor! Very simple recipe and easy to follow.

While it recommends you cool completely,  this dessert is very good fresh from the oven-however, it will not hold it's shape.

This recipe is delicious, quick, easy to make, and has versatility for meals and serving.  It is a light tasting dish and does not leave you feeling so full and bloated.  A perfect dish to prepare for various get to gathers i.e. family reunion, Church dinner, friends, etc.  

I increased the sugar from 3/4 to 1 1/4 cup, poured mixtures in prepared dish, BEFORE adding peaches, baked 10 min.  Removed from oven, add peaches, cream cheese, sugar, remaining ingredients; returned to oven for 10-15 min more.  Do Not Overmix and Do Not over cook.

I'm not a huge fan of fruit pies, but this is amazing! It's not a pretty pie either but don't let that fool you. I made this for my monthly food club and months later they are still asking for it.

I had to wait for years to make this dish because I kept postponing it for one reason or another. Having made I liked it yet decided that next time I shall just make pudding and cover it with peach slices cooked with sugar and then top the dish with whipped cream or cream cheese. Good enough!!! It would be a lazy version.Thanks for the idea however!!!

Made it exactly as written for my Bunco group. Thanks to the video it came out beautifully!   I had this recipe on file for some time but hadn't tried it as I couldn't believe a pie with canned peaches could be as good as it was rated. Used my group as a taste testers and they really liked it. Several asked for the recipe.  Next time I may add more peaches.

It is a really AWESOME recipe that will blow your socks off!! The sweetness was just right. The cream cheese was soft, sugary, and creamy. The crust was soft and chewy like a cake. If you have peaches, we recommend that you make it for any special occasion.

This tastes sooo good!! No wonder it got 5 stars. We really liked the sweet, sugary, and soft cream cheese. The crust was soft and moist. It was soo good that "someone" licked their plate! (She didn't like that the peaches were mushy though.) We believe you should make the recipe for your whole family!

I accidentally used instant vanilla pudding mix and I still thought  it tasted great; instead of peaches I believe strawberries, blueberries and even black  cherries  would work also.

I've made this twice in the past week only because I had an abundance of fresh peaches. I macerated about 3 lbs of sliced peaches with 1/2 cup sugar and teaspoon of cinnamon. The tart/sweet combination of the fresh peaches with the yummy vanilla tasting crust and creamy sweet cream topping is a fabulous combination and just screams 'summer' with every bite. Keeper recipe in my book. BTW, I made it in a 8"x8" pan and it turned out just fine.

Sooo good!  I also doubled the recipe, added another can of peaches, and baked the 'crust' 10 min. before adding peaches, and used a 9x13 pan.  The only minor thing was the cream cheese mixture might have been just a little sweet for me, might reduce the sugar a little next time, but LOVED it!

Followed recipe exactly, was absolutely amazing!  Entire family loved it and have requested it again.  Much lighter than you would expect. I had no problem with mushiness and did not cook the crust first ... perhaps others prepared the pudding before adding to flour mixture?  Recipe states to add pudding mix to dry ingredients which is what I did, finished construction and baked for 35 minutes ... perfection!

This was a delicious recipe.  I had to make it twice in the same week as we could not get enough of it the first time!  As peaches are currently in season I used 6 ripe peaches in the recipe instead of the canned variety.  As there was no syrup from the can I substituted 2 tablespoons of fruit juice for the first pie and then tried 2 tablespoons of maple syrup for the second pie.  I also used a square 8 x 8" glass pan as I did not have a deep dish pie plate.  I cooked it for the full 35 minutes and it turned out great!

Really good and really easy. Any kind of fruit would work with this pie. Next I'll make it with pears and put a little nutmeg in the crust. It's yummy. My husband ate all but one piece. Lasted less than a day.

The recipe is obviously incorrect.  I could not pour the batter into the pan but had to smooth with my spatula and hands.  Please look it over and make corrections.

I made this exactly as directed...it looked absolutely gorgeous when it came out of the oven and the cinnamon made the house smell great! I took it to a friend's house for dinner...and it was just okay. I like the way it was made, and might try that pudding crust with other flavors, but I didn't love it and gave the leftovers to a friend with a teenager who eats everuthing!

This got great reviews from the family. I found it a little too sweet for my taste, so I'd probably cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese, but overal very yummy!

I was so excited for this but it was sort of a let down. I was expecting a very peaches and cream taste but instead all I could smell was canned peaches and the texture wasn't so creamy. Not bad, just was expecting so much better.

SOOOO much yumminess! Thank you SO much for the recipe! I made it almost exactly as written, except I only had butterscotch pudding, which actually gave the crust a great little added depth. Next time (as in two days from now) I make it, I will try to remember to bake the crust a bit first, as the center was a bit mushy (though it didn't detract from the flavor at all). I also used my toaster oven, since it's over 100 degrees these days, and that may have effected the doneness of the center bottom. Overall, incredible dessert. Reminds me of an inverted cobbler, with rich creaminess added. Perfection!

I do not like pies or peaches.  But I have made this for family picnics, close friends, fathers day.  Always a HUGE hit.  I have never had leftovers, I have seen a small but real fight over the rights to the last piece.  I normally follow the directions,   once tried to use fresh peaches, did not work as well.

Yumm-O!!  Fills a 9x9 perfectly.  Easy, delicious and baked up beautifully.  Golden brown outside... warm, creamy, gooey inside.  Adjusted cooking temp to 375 due to the "personality" of our toaster oven and it was perfect in 30 minutes.

Too runny. Too sugary sweet. Didn't taste the peaches.  All we got was a sugar rush. Wouldn't try it again.   Getting it to a 5-star recipes is too much effort.  But for those of you that like a challenge, here ya go!

I was FABULOUS!  I loved it!  The ONLY thing that I would change next time I make it, is to leave out the salt.  It was very salty.  Otherwise...it's perfect!

Hi, I haven't made it yet, I'm in Hong Kong and having a really tough time finding pudding mix which is not instant. 
Any suggestions on an alternative, I saw mango pudding but wasn't sure about the flavour

I read the recipe and reviews and decided to make it exactly as stated. I went to the store, bought what I needed  and was excited to begin. I soon realized after I began that the base was too thick upon mixing and looked at the box of pudding and realized that while no where on the front it said "instant", it was indeed instant pudding.  

I was not pleased since I live no where near a town but up on a mountain pretty far away. I decided to proceed since a few had made the same mistake and still reviewed it positively.  I decided to add a bit more milk to thin the base out a bit so I could still spread it.  I did follow the rest of the directions exactly.  I baked it 35 minutes and it looked perfect.

It was NOT rubbery, was fully set and delicious. I would have to say it is one of my favorite pies even made the wrong way.  It was beautiful the way I arranged the peaches and topping and had a beautiful brown color on top.  I ate the first piece still warm from the oven and imagine that it how I will have going forward as well.  Next time I make it I will do it correctly but am happy that even with my error it was still wonderful.

I may be in the minority here but as a pie snob this one disappoints.  The crust is really just a mushy cake and the cheesecake like topping is one note.  If you want a good peach pie, make it the old fashioned way and with fresh peachs.  The shortcuts make this recipe easy to make but lacks in flavor and texture.

this is fantastic! Its a little different from a traditional pie but still tastes amazing. MAKE SURE YOU GET NON-INSTANT PUDDING! i accidentally grabbed instant and didn't notice, then had to throw out my first batch of crust and run to the store for more pudding. other than that, a very simple and tasty recipe, will definitely make again.

I made it exactly to the recipe.  Used a deep dish pie pan as directed. My 10" deep dish pie pan was a disposable one.  I did not bake the crust first, did not  increase the amount of peaches, didn't change anything, just followed the recipe.   The pie turned out great!  Hubby and I both like it a lot.  I submitted a photo.

I made this recipe exactly as shown quite a few times now, even made it for another family while providing a meal after surgery. Rave reviews all around! I do not bake the crust at all ahead of time and the results have been perfect every time. Love that it calls for canned peaches - that way I can make year-round. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a family that was going through some difficult times. I did not taste it but their reaction to the pie said everything. I am going to a gathering  this weekend and I am going to make it again and hopefully get to taste it this time and see some more positive reactions and smiles. I have to rate it for at least 5 stars.

Amazing! I make this recipe year-round. I double the recipe in a greased 11x15 pan; Follow the recipe, omit the salt, use additional peaches (2 large jars of our homemade canned peaches), bake at 325 in convection for 40-min. Make sure to drain the peaches in a colander (saving the syrup) so there is not excess liquid in the pie. For a double recipe, 1 large box (135g) of non-instant vanilla pudding works. Keep the single-batch amount of sugar/cinnamon topping - it's plenty.

I'm Australian and made this tonight. Followed the recipe as closely as I could (used custard powder in lieu of non-instant pudding mix) and baked according to the timings in a ceramic tart dish. I'm really impressed with how it turned out! I've only eaten it warm, but suspect it may be even  better once it has chilled.  Will definitely make again!

I misplaced my recipe and decided to google it.  Thanks so much...yes, everyone loves it and it smells wonderful baking.
I like it warm best, but it is good cold.  Thanks

Don't change this recipe, I like warm desert in the winter and served at room temperature with vanilla ice-cream. The cream cheese top was soft and creamy just like whip cream.

I would have rated it 5 star were it not for the pudding mix .  When I bake, I prefer to use ingredients without artificial colors and preservatives. However I made my own pudding mix without those unwanted ingredients and used that instead.  The result was a spectacular pie. An absolute winner in my home. Thanks for posting.

Absolutely no changes needed.  Next time I will  make it with strawberries and use chocolate pudding in the crust and make a chocolate cream cheese for the top.

I have this recipe that doubles all the ingredients and it bakes in a 13x9 pan. Large size is good for pot-lucks but nice to find it in a smaller size for family. It is definitely one of our favorites.

I tried this recipe for the first time over the weekend and I thought it was very good and so did my family.  One person has to be gluten free so I used a gluten free flour blend by Pillsbury and was very happy to see it turned out great.  I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't regular flour but the bottom layer which was the thickest layer had a heavy cake texture.
I'll definitely make it again but next time will try it with the regular flour. Other than the flour I made it exactly like the original recipe except used a 12 inch pie plate.  It was a hit with all!

Okay. So at work, they wanted to do a "Pie bake off" contest. I had no real idea what to make- I wanted to be different, no usual apple pie or you know the standards we all see. 
I made this and unanimously WON the contest!!
So excited and thankful for this recipe! 
It was really good!!

I made it exactly as written because I read the review that said it is  this recipe that won the awards. Also I hate when people make changes and then don't think the recipe is good. To me the pie was ok. I thought the crust was kind of dry and that peach cobbler really tastes better. I did cook it about 5 -10 min longer than the 30 but that was because it said until brown and some reviews said it was not cooked enough. If I make this again I would not cook it over 30 and then hope that it firms as it cools.

All I changed was to add more peaches { 1 large and one small can {  plus a little more juice in the batter.  Took it to family gathering Labor day and it was a huge success.

I loved the pie, very easy to make.  Delicious!!
I did cook the crust for 10 min before filling it,
Just based on others recommendation.   Next time I may just follow the recipe as is!!
I used a quiche dish,  it worked very well

I made it exactly as written  in a 10 inch springform pan except I added a few extra peaches till the area on top of the batter was completely filled , then cooked it at 350 degrees but for 40 minutes to be sure and it came out excellent. I refrigerated it for 5 hrs. I used about 1/2 a pkg of 160 gm Dr. Oetker Shirriff pudding and pie filling ( not instant). (160 gm is 5.6 ounces) and the recipe calls for 3 ounces.

WOW!  I had been wanting to make a peach pie all summer, but did not have the time. When I saw the picture of this pie and how quick and simple is was to make, I thought I would give it a try.  So glad I did.  I stuck to the recipe and did not change anything.  My entire family loved it!  I will be making it again this time for my brother and his family and while I am at it, make one for my family  too.  WOW! WOW! WOW!

It was good but, not award winning. I used fresh peaches that I marinated in a little fig jam and sugar overnight. Also used a nine inch spring form pan. The cream cheese topping barely covered it, could maybe add a little more. 
Overall pretty easy and good.

i made this pie this weekend for company.  thinking it was vetted since it was an award winning pie.  it came out a runny mess.  it looked beautiful before it was cut, but once i cut it it was a runny mess.  first of all, i couldn't find a 3oz. non instant puddung, only a 4.6 oz size.  so i weighed out the 3 ounces.  and secondly, the directions say to take it out of the oven when browned?  well, the pie is covered in cinnamon, how are you supposed to know when it is browned???  it had a good flavor, but i will not make it again.  especially when company comes.

I made this as written in a 9.5" deep dish glass pan.  I didn't pre-bake the crust, and it wasn't soggy at all.  It was just a little thicker than the picture.  I wasn't sure about the cinnamon but I added it and was glad I did.  Might try it with strawberries.  Very delicious!  Feels like a taste of summer but from a can, so can make it anytime.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will not make this again.  It is not a pie ; the crust is nothing like a pie crust. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using fresh fruit.  It was mushy  and pudding like.  .The are many better pie recipes than this.

Made it exactly as the recipe states and got rave reviews. I think you have to have the expectation that this is not a typical "pie" and has a more cake-like crust. Wasn't sure about all the cinnamon-sugar on top as I prepared it, but many commented that it took the flavor over the top.

This truly is an award winning and easy pie to bake.   I cut peach slices into chunks as  I prefer bite size pieces for slicing and serving.  I  made two pies so I cut one cube of butter in half which  yielded 4 not 3 tablespoons of butter added to crust.  I baked them in deep-dish glass pie dishes.  Make sure to use Cook & Serve not instant pudding mix. They baked in 35 minutes exactly and set up perfect.  I did refrigerate after cooled overnight then left at room temperature the next day when we got to our BBQ where they were served.  Everyone and I mean everyone loved and the cooks in the group wanted the recipe.  It is not overly sweet however is sweet enough.  I seldom make the same recipe twice unless requested to however I will return to this one for my personal enjoyment.

I have to give it a low rating because if this were to ever be a good dessert it needs alot of alterations not found in the original. I wish I had read some of them bc this ended up being a disappointment. The "crust" was almost chewy. The cream cheese mixture looked alot more fluffy in the picture but just turned out wet-like and too sweet/sugary. The cinnamon topping just layed on top of the wetness and even I someone that loves cinnamon thought it to be too much. I brought it to my family's (none of us picky eaters lol) and only about 1/4 of the "pie" was consumed! It has potential though

Only change I made was baked the crust for 10 minutes as suggested by another reviewer. This is by far the best dessert I have ever had, it tastes like something from a really nice restaurant. I made it for a friends Birthday and everyone that had some absolutely loved it.

Even though I totally bungled the recipe and mixed the two layers together, it totally came out ok. Since I used all my cream cheese, I had to do a makeshift merangue topping. Had a nice custard-like consistency. Used 1/2 tsp vanilla in the topping. The flavor was outstanding.

I made this pie pretty close to the recipe with the exception of adding more peaches. We found that it was much better the next day after it rested in the refrigerator all night.

I made it the other day and with respect to the owner of the recipe made it as she instructed. Only change I made was I used fresh vanilla pudding as the local stores only had pudding mix with partially hydrogenated oils which I will never use at my home, restaurant or TV show we have...Still came out great. Used 10" spring pan also. Thanks

This was delicious! We weren't going to make it because we didn't have any packages of pudding mix. We decided to use a pudding cup already prepared while omitting the milk due to constancy of pudding. We will definitely make this recipe again. We also coated the top with brown sugar and cinnamon. Delicious!!

So rich, but fantastic! Even with a few of my health-related changes. I subbed a third of the flour with whole-grain spelt flour. I subbed the egg (allergy) for a tablespoon of ground chia seeds soaked in warm water for 10 minutes. I baked the crust 10 minutes before adding the peaches as per other reviewers, especially since I only had a 9 inch pan. The thicker crust wasn't soggy at all. Though it could also be because I used fresh peaches (6) instead of canned. Instead of the reserved peach juice in the cream cheese layer I just peeled and tossed in a few slices of the fresh peach. It blended in fine well with my electric beater.

Doubled the recipe and put into a 13x9 for 35 mins. I did bake crust 10 mins before adding peaches. 2 large cans if peaches coved the pie/cake well, also diced some of the peaches and added to the cream cheese mix.

Made in a 9 1/2" glass pie plate exactly as written. Made sure peaches were very dry before adding to pie. It came out beautifully, not soggy  at all and just delicious.  I opened a small can of sliced peaches so I could arrange some on top. Wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I found this recipe to be just okay.  Perhaps I was expecting too much as I was really looking forward to a "knock your socks off" dessert.  It definitely needs to be refrigerated overnight to get a cheesecake flavor.  I did not care for the cake part as I found it strange tasting, maybe too much baking powder.  I followed the recipe with no changes.  Thank you Debbi for sharing your recipe.  I truly wish I had enjoyed it more.

After reading all of the helpful comments, I made this twice - the first with spring form pan, following directions EXCEPT, I used fresh peaches (both times). The second I used a deep dish pie plate and baked the crust for 10 minutes. It was hit both ways. Thinking of using blueberries next time!

A lovely dessert.  I followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully.  (I did increase the amount of peaches and was very careful to blot the syrup off.)  I don't often cook with peaches for dessert but this recipe was a big hit and enjoyed by all.

I did make the pie. Pretty durn good~However---I think it does need the spices upped a tad, A second can of peaches, possibly another cream cheese. I did find a 10 inch 'good cooks' springform pan  at the grocery store for 7 bucks. Wasn't taking any chances and I decided what the heck! I will make the pie again– If for no other reason than to justify the seven dollars I spent on a pan for IT! ; )
I compromised and cooked the batter part for five minutes before adding the peaches – – and the peaches sank into it fine – – but it turned out more cake-like than I think it's supposed to be. We'll see what next time brings!  Anyhow ~ simple to make and tasty though next time I'll  tweak it with my changes ~ THAT will make it a keeper! : )

Made this exactly per recipe.  The crust was too doughy, but will try again using other suggestions to bake it for ten to fifteen minutes and then add toppings.  Ate it for desert this evening and was so much better after chilling for  24 hours.  it did look pretty in a ten inch glass pan just like the photo.

I made this ...twice.  The first time I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it turned out perfect and was absolutely delicious.  It's one of the best recipes for peach pies I now have.  The second time I took the advice of several reviewers and added a extra 15 ounce can of peaches.  Bad decision.  The pie wasn't nearly as good, it took much longer to bake, and the bottom was soggy.  And, it was just too many peaches and not enough cream.  Take my advice and stick to the original recipe.

I made mine in a 10 inch deep glass pie dish letting the "crust" bake 10 minutes before filling with thinly sliced fresh peaches.  I took it to a church potluck & it was an instant hit.  Will definitely make again!

Well what can I say except don't make this unless you have some self control. It's delicious. I thought the batter was too thick for the bottom of the cake since the recipe said pour into a pie pan and mine was too thick so I added a little of the juice to thin it out before adding the peaches. It needs to be thick to keep the peaches moving to the bottom. Keep that in mind. We loved it!

I made this for the family the other night .  And I followed the directions  and ingredients exactly .  The pie turned out beautifully and was absolutely fantastic .  I got great reviews from family and coworkers alike .  There was no need to prebake anything .  I think the reason that it cut so well and was so presentable was because I let it chill overnight before serving . It was so simple to make and so delicious it will be a regular staple at our home.

It turned out beautifully. The only thing I did different was I baked it in an 7"X11" baking dish, and added another 15 ounce can of peaches. And it was oh so good!

I added about a tsp of cinnamon  mixed into the peaches for extra flavor,  Used  canned evaporated milk in place of reg. milk. Once it was good and cold, oh my what a wonderful dessert!!! Thank you so much!!

Did not change a thing! This pie was a big hit around here. I will do it again. I can see this replacing the chocolate fluff my wife always takes to church events.

Incredibly delicious!  Like Crystal S, I packed this with extra peaches, but since it was peach season I used fresh peaches instead of canned.  Turned out moist, rich and dreamy.  I couldn't keep my husband out of it.  Make it again?  Guaranteed.  Thank you for a new favorite dessert.

It was just OK to me.  I followed some of the readers suggestion to cook the bottom for 10 minutes.  It just wasn't the way I was hoping; the crust/bottom was rather soggy and was expecting something crusty like a pie shell.  i wouldn't make it again

Excellent! Easy to make. Everyone wanted the recipe. I doubled the ingredients for a 9 x 12 pan.
 Baked cake for 10 minutes first before adding peaches and cream. Then it baked for 35 minutes.
This is a keeper!

My family really loved it!  However, I think that next time, I will bake the crust a few minutes longer to see if it firms up more...don't over do it.  Also, the cream cheese topping is runnier than I thought it would be.  Perhaps leave entire pie in oven for a couple of extra minutes.
Nonetheless, it was a hit!

If you're afraid of baking this is a must!!! For me, the oven has always been that hole under the stove that stores extra cookware. (Or the place to put a frozen pizza in a moment of desperation) However, this recipe seemed so easy and looked so good that I had to give it a whirl. It really is too good to be true!! Simple. mostly on hand ingredients, easy directions and the most delicious out come. Who can ask for more. I would call it a cross between a pie and a cobbler and it has inspired me to try it with some different fruits. I wanted to scream "I can finally bake"!

I always bake for my co-workers.  As soon as I got this recipe via e-mail, I  knew I had to make it.  I did have to improvise, as I only had one small can of peaches.  I used canned pitted cherries along with the peaches.  Everybody in work raved over the pie.  Thank you for sharing - you deserve 5 ribbons.

This is one of my favorite desserts.  Per the advice of another I sometimes double the recipe and bake in a 9 X 13.  
No other changes.  Perfect recipe as is.  Thank you Debbi.

I have a gift, at least I think, of reading over a recipe and knowing whether or not the flavor profiles will let work. That said, after seeing this recipe,  I wasn't surprised when it turned-out to be  a really good dessert, but, I was surprised that it turned-out to be even better than just a really good dessert. Good job!!

I did not make the crust because I didn't feel like making a pastry. I just baked the pudding mixture and in 5 minute intervals I swirled mixture up the sides of the pie pan and continued to bake - the mixture adhered to the walls and thickened with this step repeated and did form a great crust.

I used the fresh peach filling from Chef John's peach pie and open baked then for 20 minutes.  Then I added the cream cheese topping and baked for another 30 minutes.  It was very well received

Lastly I halved the sugar in the filling and the cream cheese and it was plenty sweet enough.   Hard to imaging that this would be anything other than cloying with full sugar

I normally make the recipe as written first, then make any changes in the second.  in this case I did change out canned peaches for real peaches and made a little peach puree instead of canned juice. I don't feel the changes made altered the recipe since I was substituting canned for fresh, because peaches are in season right now. Next time though I will use more peaches for sure. I didn't have enough but my kids and I loved this!

Wrote a review for peaches and cream pie already.   Same exact recipe.    Don't want to repeat the whole thing.  Basically, too sweet, looked pretty, crust perfect in a 10 in. spring form pan, cooked for 33 minutes.  Used peaches in pear concentrate.  No added sugar to them.  Would use fresh fruit next time, maybe raspberries.   Would also love to have someone do a makeover for the crust so I would not have to use vanilla  puddding from a box.     Don't like processed food.   Easy to make and baked perfectly, just needs a few tweaks to make it more healthy.    Canned peaches not desirable to me either.  Nice idea however.

While making this, I suddenly noticed that the "crust" (on the bottom) contained NO SUGAR. Interesting. Still, it worked out fine because the rest of the pie is so sweet. 
Like many others, I read a lot of the reviews and chose to amend the recipe according to those suggestions. Pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes before introducing the rest of the ingredients. Used a springform pan instead of a pie plate. AND, totally did away with the pudding mix after reading the ACTUAL ingredients on the pudding box. The actual ingredients are simply "a lot of thickeners, some food dyes, and added sugar, labeled as dextrose". Instead, I simply added 2-3 tablespoons of tapioca flour (could've used cornstarch as well)
Pie came out great. VERY tasty. Yes, this is a go-to dessert for any time you need to "bring something to a party".

It's better warm. I found that the next day out of fridge it isn't as good. I think I'll try using more of the reserved peach syrup in the cr. cheese for sweetness.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to double the recipe and follow it exactly as written. Made two of the most beautiful 10" pies I've ever seen. Absolutely delicious and all of my guests asked for the recipe.

I made no changes and it was perfectly delicious.  My husband says it's definitely a keeper.   I have made it several times already.  Our guests have also raved about it.   It's cool and refreshing after refrigeration .  It would keep well in the refrigerator for a few days , EXCEPT for the fact that it is usually quickly consumed.  Try it fr t.yourself.

It is peach season here in Colorado.  There is no way I am using canned peaches let alone vanilla pudding mix!  I make one with fresh peaches and a cornstarch pudding with egg which is even better!

I was excited to see this recipe until I got to the canned peaches. It's peach season here in Michigan. No way canned right now! Any ideas for fresh peaches?

I can see why this pie was award winning the best peaches and cream pie I have tried so far. This will definitely be a keeper for me.  I have tried several other recipes that we did enjoy but  this will be the only one I will make now. Guess loved it and all requested recipe. I also did not change anything followed the recipe to a T  :)

I doubled the recipe and used a spring pan. It turned out fantastic! Everyone loved it. My only suggestion, bake it the day before you want to serve it, to allow proper cooling/ setting time.

This was so wonderful, my family raved! I added pecans on top before baking, and served it with a dollop of  Cool Whip on each slice. Very creamy tasting, with the tang of peaches to set it off.

This is a great recipe! I followed some users' advice and baked the flour mixture for 10 minutes before adding the peaches. Next time, I'm going to use all 2 cans of peaches (and maybe 3) and make more of the cream cheese mixture as well. This is just my personal preference.

Doubled it and put it in a 9x13. Otherwise, followed directions as written. People kept coming back for seconds (and thirds!). I baked it between 45 and 50 minutes and it wasn't overbaked.

The flavor of this is excellent, but the texture is not going to be a hit for everyone.  It is kind of a mix between cake and pudding--definitely not in the pie family at all.  If you don't mind somewhat soggy cake-like dessert then this is a good choice.  Also, the peaches could be cut up smaller.

Make sure the cream cheese is baked well and make sure it is cooled before you cut it. I made that mistake. It tasted ok but not as great as other viewers felt.

It was good, but I'm having troubles with the crust. It is so soupy. I've noticed some people suggested baking the crust for 10 minutes prior to adding peaches, while others suggested not overcooking because the crust hardens as it cools. The only thing I did different from the recipe was adding 1 tablespoon of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture. Of course, that wouldn't affect the crust, but I think I will try pre-cooking the crust next time.

This is a wonderful & unique dessert. My husband is a giant cheesecake fan. I love cheesecakes but don't always want a dessert that's so heavy. This makes a nice compromise. The crust is lovely and cake like. The fruit adds nice flavor and the cream cheese part with the cinnamon topping is heavenly. I didn't alter this or take extra steps with baking the crust. I did drain the fruit and used 2 15 oz cans. I wonder if it would be good with other fruits? Yum!

Absolutely my cowboys favorite desert!  The first time I followed the directions to the tee. It was great!  Next time I doubled, and took advice and baked crust for 10 mins., was much better.  His second favorite is blueberry, so that's the next one I'll be making. It's easy to make, and everyone always wants the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

This was just ok, nothing special and I followed the recipe exactly. The bottom part turns out kind of like dense cake  and I thought it would have been more 'puddingy' so it wasn't really like a pie more reminiscent of an upside-down cake...

This is one of my favorite pie recipes! I have made this several times. This time, however, I accidentally bought instant pudding. It turned out just a delicious as ever! I may actually like the consistency of the bottom better!

Had to put back in the oven after it cooled because the center wasn't done :(have to bake much longer than the 30 to 35 minutes it says to bake . I would make again but bake for 45 to50 minutes.

This makes for a delicious pie, but some tweaking is needed in the execution. I followed the recipe as written and my only problem with the pie was the crust being soggy. Pre-baking the crust would obviously resolve that problem, I just wanted to rate this recipe as written first. I'll make it again for sure, it was a big hit in my house! thanks for sharing :)

my grandmaother makes this on special occcasions but would never give us the recipe. of course i got wise & decided to look it up & i tahnk you so much for having this. i will never tell my grandmother that i can now make my own anytime cause that's her special thing for us. we recently learned my husband is a diabetic so i changed everything to sugar free & substitued the sugar with domino light & it turned out just as good.  perfect surprise for him for Father's Day!

I was so excited to see this recipe on allrecipes!  The cookbook that I had gotten it out of when I was first married has fallen apart and this recipe is now missing.  This is the first pie I made from scratch because I was terrified to make my own pie crust (and this one makes its own).  Always gets rave reviews.  I do make mine using a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple or pineapple tidbits however.

Absolutely wonderful. Made it exactly as written as far as the recipe goes, but I didn't have a 10" deep dish, so I just used a spring form pan.  Worked very well.  Thank for sharing!

Wow!   I'd loved to say that we waited until this creation cooled completely, but truth be told, it was ravaged from the pan while still slightly warm.   We all loved it.   I made it exactly as stated EXCEPT I added another 15 oz. can of peaches.   I used a glass pie pan and baked it for 35 minutes.   No issues with it being soggy, but I did make sure to drain those peaches thoroughly.   I can see this would a great choice to bring to a potluck.   It's super easy to make and would travel well with no maintenance.   This is a keeper!!

I thought this pie was fair. It tasted more like a cake to me, and I think fresh peaches would have been better.

Wow!  Although I doubled the recipe and added an extra small can of peaches and baked in a deep dish 9x13 casserole for almost twice the time, was absolutely fantastic!  Everyone loved it and agreed was not a 'pie'...was more of a moist cake or cobbler.  Would definitely make again.  Would love this instead of a coffee cake since it is not very sweet.

This recipe came in the email update. Decided to try it for a luncheon I was giving. IT WAS A HIT! Soooo yummy and so easy to make. I think prep was 10 minutes + baking time. My hubby keeps asking for it! Might be good with other canned fruits too. Maybe cherries.

Served this as one of 2 deserts for thanksgiving.  Added fresh raspberries to the top.  Didn't care for it at all.  Only a couple of people ate and we didn't eat the rest.  Will not make again.

I don't change anything to this recipe and I really liked it. Good summer dessert. The only complaint is the crust is kind of thick and dense but tasty. I made it twice this summer and everyone enjoyed it.

I tried this pie for my husband only, because I don't like peaches.  But it turned out so pretty I had to try it.  I really liked it.  Of course, all the real whipped cream slathered all over the pie may have drowned out the flavor of the peaches!  A very different kind of pie.  I will make it next time with fresh peaches.

I made this exactly as stated except for baking the crust for 10 mins per another post, in my opinion, that was a mistake. I also added a small can of peaaches and since I don't have a deep pie pan, I followed another reviewer's advice and used a 10" springform pan, which worked great. The taste was excellent, but my husband suggeste using diced peaches and mixing into the crust mixture then adding the topping. Otherwise this is a great recipe..

This is a very rich and yummy dessert! The only thing I would say is maybe undercook it a bit.  Mine didn't look done on top, but the crust was a little too done.  It sets up as it cools, so I'd only cook it for about 25 minutes, so it's not too brown on bottom.  Very good dessert though!  Thanks for the recipe:-)

My family would rate this higher than 5 stars if they could.  I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan - the only thing I did differently was to use peaches that I had canned.  I didn't measure them - just sliced a nice layer over the top of the crust.  Super yummy and easy - we will definitely be making this again in the near future!

Ok, So I tried this out and I loved it so  much that I decided to enter it into a pie contest this week. I did change the top of it because it didn't look appealing. I put on a crumb top instead. So after the pie tasting they announced the top 3 winners. Number one winner was me.....Yay! The Peaches & Cream Pie was everyone's choice even the Judges. Give this pie a try. You will not be disappointed.

OMG!  This dish was SO awesome!!!!  I used a regular 9x9 baking dish because I didn't have a 10-inch pie pan.  If you are looking for a  summer-y dessert treat, this is the one to try!

This was a great pie and it tasted delious. Thanks to the one who suggested using the Pampered Chef deep dish stone. That is what I used and it came out perfect.

WoW!!!!  I've had this recipe for 40 something years.  And yes it is the best recipe on earth.  I've always loved making this "pie"  It is so easy and sooooooo good.  I'm glad that someone else also has it and is enjoying it.  I also like the other reviews that suggest what to use if you don't have a 10 inch pie pan.

This was SO good! Just like my mom used to make! I did double the recipe and baked it in an 8x10 glass pan. I also used peach halves and sliced them thin since I don't care too much for the chunky peaches. Turned out delicious!

This was pretty good! I was looking for a fruit dessert to serve with tonight's Easter dinner. I am picky when it comes to pies, so maybe that's why this appealed to me. I wouldn't consider this a pie. It's more like a shortcake.... the crust is dense & cake-like w/ a thick pudding topping enveloping the peaches. So here's my take on this.... You know those Dole peaches & creme fruit parfait cups near the canned fruits aisle??? Take that, "lace" it w/ a shortcake crust & you've got a good idea of what this pie is like. I usually only make slight modifications the 1st time I try a recipe, but after reading all the reviews on here, I decided to make some add'l. changes. First, I pre-baked my crust for 10 min., then as SAMHOPKINS suggested, I too brushed mine w/ egg white (but be careful as the crust will not be completely set!). I then added almost an entire 29 oz. can of peach slices (I ate the rest!). I used my 8 1/4 x 1 1/2 in. Pampered Chef deep dish pie plate, and despite this, I had no prob. w/ bubbling over, etc. (I did carefully spread my cream cheese mixture to w/in 1 in. of the edge as directed, which no doubt helped with that). I found the 1 T / 1 t sugar to cinnamon ratio to be spot on (don't skimp on this!!!). Since I made my pie one night prior, it had plenty of time to "set up" - and it did perfectly! My parents raved (I sent them home w/ leftovers). I'm not sure I'd make this again for myself, but am glad I tried it nonetheless! Thanks for sharing, Debbie. :)

If you love cream cheese, you'll love this dessert!  I'm not huge on peaches or cream cheese, but everybody else loved it.  It was definitely better the next day as the peach flavor set in.  I would prefer more peaches and less cream cheese though...

Aside from doubling and putting in a 13x9 dish, I made this exactly as written.  This was really pretty good as far as flavor.  However, the crust layer was just way too thick and cakey for my taste.  It didn't taste bad; just overbearing.  I think there's too much crust and not enough peaches.  It did taste better after a couple of days, as some others had noted.  Sitting in the fridge allowed the moisture of the peaches to soften up that thick crust a bit, creating a better texture than it initially had.  Overall, pretty tasty.  I would just prefer something I didn't have to wait three days to truly enjoy.  So maybe next time, I will cut the crust in half or add another can of peaches; maybe both.

For me this was just okay.  I followed the suggestion to pre-bake the crust, but it still seemed like a big pile of mush.  Maybe it would taste better with fresh peaches, but where I live (Guam) you can't get decent peaches.  My husband liked it, as well as a friend of mine, but I wasn't that impressed.  It wasn't terrible, but not worth the effort I went through to make it.  I don't think I'll bother trying it again.

The first time I had this I almost got sick cause I could not get enough. If you are a peach lover as I am this is the pie for you. It hit my taste buds in all the right spots. I do love to try new things a dash here or splash there a personal touch, but I didnt add or take anything way it is perfect.

AMAZING!! I cooked in 10" deep pie dish and baked the bottom layer for 10 min at 350- did egg wash and baked for 5 more min. I used light cream cheese and it was delicious! I chilled the pie for about 2 hours and it was still a bit warm - but sooooo good!  All my friends wanted the recipe!

OH. MY. GOODNESS. This is phenomenal!!! Absolutely addictive!! I used the instant pudding because it's all I had. Didn't seem to be a problem. I used blueberries because I realised I had no canned peaches. I think I will make it with blueberries FOREVER!! It was that amazing! I used a 2 qt Pyrex square, seemed to do the trick. Nothing spilled over. We ate the whole thing in two days! I would suggest small portions, very rich dessert. Keeper!!

Was good but could have been better had I used peaches in heavy syrup and not in pear juice. It wasn't sweet enough for us. Remember when you make it don't try to cut calories as I did. You must use peaches in syrup not pear juice.

This is awesome!!  I did bake the crust for 10min before adding the filling so it wouldn't be soggy.  And I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.

To my taste, this was one of those desserts that would make you say "it's kind of strange. I don't think I'd make again" WHILE you stood over it and ate the whole thing !! It tasted like Bisquick and canned peaches with a creamy (almost pudding-like)topping - not really suitable for company, but for some reason strangely addictive.

This tastes really good.  I agree that it isn't really a pie.  Well it's like custard/pie/cheesecake.  When I cut it it was hard to keep it together.  The ingredients sort of slithered off of the crust.  Maybe I need to let it set longer though.  I also baked the crust for 10 minutes before I added the ingredients.  The recipe calls for too much of the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I didn't put it all on.  I'm gonna experiment with this because despite the problems I had with it, it tasted so dang good!

I followed the recipe exactly in terms of ingredients; I prebaked the pie cake at 350F for 10 min as some reviewers suggested. I regret to say that, despite the rave reviews, I'm not very impressed by this peach cream pie -- I find the cake too salty and tastes generic because of the puddle mix, and even though I prebaked it and drained the peaches VERY well, it was still soggy. Maybe it's just a personal taste.

Huge hit on Thanksgiving! This was so simple to make and it got better reviews from family than the difficult, time-consuming pies that I also made. I followed recipe exactly.

This turned out sooo amazing! Its so dangerous to have in the house because I want to eat the whole thing. My one suggestion for anyone who makes it is, the recipe says to serve it chilled, but it is so delicious right out of the oven. The cream cheese is all gooey and the crust is nice and hot. YUMMMMM! You gotta try this one.

I only gave four stars just because i didnt like the peach and cream cheese combination. However i made a strawberry version of it and won 3rd place in our company bakeoff. Since the cream cheese part set like a cheesecake, the next time i make this i will use a springform pan and double up on the cream cheese mixture and the garnish the top with fresh sliced strawberries. Thanks for the great recipie!

It tasted the best the second day. Baked the 'crust' for 10 minutes before adding peaches as others suggested. Used fresh peaches and thats what made it. I don't think it would taste as good with mushy canned peaches. My husband ate 2/3 of it and loves it. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe!  It tastes like a cross between peach cheesecake and peach cobbler.  I took another member's advice and baked the crust for about 10 minutes before adding the filling, it turned out perfectly!

I got mixed reviews on this one.  As I don't like peaches I went by what others told me.  Some were not too keen on all of the different flavors going on in this pie, ie the cheesecake flavor, cinnamon sugar and peach all together.  Some thought it was lacking peach taste.  I think I might just stick to a real peach pie, something they're used to.

Wow!  I loved this and so did my husband.  It was really easy to make and turned out great.  It was so sweet and yummy.  I wasn't a huge fan of the crust, but the peaches & cream cheese mix made up for that!

Thanks for the recipe.

Well, I'm back.  Not impressed with this.  "Crust" was dry and tough, probably due to the extra flour.  The peaches and cream cheese was good.  People were polite, had left-overs and no one asked for the recipe.  I think this would be better with a regular pie crust.  Sorry, I probably will not make again.

I made this many, many years ago and it was called a "Peaches and Cream Cheesecake" which I think is a more fitting name.  Glad to have found it again.  It's yummy!

FANTASTIC!! Made this pie on Friday.... and it was gone on Friday. The sad part about this is that it's only my husband and myself here at home :) big hit!! Will DEFINITELY make again.. Instead of using vanilla pudding I used the French vanilla since it was what I had at hand. THANKS! Awesome pie!

I made this yesterday exactly according to instructions except used a 9 in pie pan.  I still fit everything in, however.  I was a little worried initially when I was putting the peaches on top of the crust mixture, but it came out looking even better than the picture on the recipe.  I chilled it but thought it was much better when warmed up.  We'll be getting vanilla ice cream tonight to go along with it.  Boyfriend said it was wonderful and he wants to bring some over to a neighbor...and he doesn't even like peaches!

Yummy!  Had a lug of Colorado peaches, and made this treat for children who were home from college, and it was gone in an instant!  I only needed a couple large peaches.  It was easy too!  Great recipe!

This pie is quick and easy to make and it tastes great.  I wouldn't call it the most impressive looking desert but served alongside vanilla ice cream, it is guest worthy.

i thought that the filling of this pie was terrific however i thought that the crust had a  strange texture and taste.   Next time that i bake this dessert i will either incorporate a standard pie crust or nutty crust.  Even a shortbread crust would lend itself to this peaches and cream filling.

YUM-YUM-YUM! I had high expectations for this, due to all of the positive reviews, and this recipe exceeded them. Super easy to make and super delicious! The cinnamon-sugar topping is a complimentary touch!

I'm not sure why it's called a pie, it should be called..well, ok, I'm not sure what it should be called but it's more a cake then pie. Whatever it is, it's fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. I will definately be making this again.

I've doubled this and put it in a glass dish. I might try sour cream either with or by itself instead of cream cheese. My co-workers loved this!

I used cherry pie filling instead of peaches (husband loves cherry pie).  He loved it..  I didn't.  Way too sweet.

This recipe is very good!There is so much you can do with it.The next time I do it I may use different fruit or use more cream cheese!One thing is I suggest to bake the "crust" for 10-15mins before adding fruit and cream cheese mixture!Great recipe!!!

I joined allrecipes.com just to rate this pie.  I liked the pie myself, but my coworkers and roommate LOVED the pie.  I think it made me look like a way better baker than I really am!  I followed the advice to prebake the crust; I think it's key so you don't end up with a goopy mess.  Also, I didn't do the cinnamon sugar topping.  Great recipe.

I can see why this recipe is award-winning. I took this to a church pot-luck and it went FAST! The bottom layer was not too dry, and was very flavorful. The peaches did not make the crust soggy either, which I was concerned about. I also doubled the amount of cream-cheese topping, which just allowed me to cover more of the pie. Overall, this was an excellent choice that I am glad I made!

This is an awesome pie recipe! I can't stand the texture of pastry but I really loved this one. All I've done so far to change it is I added double the amount of cream cheese and tried a grahm crust. I found it fell apart  but I loved the taste.

i'm only giving it 3 stars.  I thought it was too gooey.  maybe i didn't cook it long enough.  I think i'll try it one more time, maybe i'll change my mind.  I am changing my mind on this I will now give it 5 stars.  I made it again and cooked it a little longer and it was delish!!  My family loved it.  I took another viewers advice and doubled the use of the cream cheese and I don't think I'll do that again, it just had a bit to much cream cheese in it but it was still great. but defintly will not double the cream cheese again.

made this for the first time for an office birthday party, had to tell everyone what it was because it was different from anything they were use to eating, that one bite was all it took, they went on and on and want the recipe, i doubled the cream cheese part and made it in a 13X9 casserole dish, next time i will reduce the cinnamon by half and try a different fruit, but the peaches were very good.

IT WAS GOOD, I LOVED THE CRUST AND THE CREAM CHEESE TOPPING, BUT I PERSONALLY DIDNT CARE FOR THE PEACHES.  I THINK THAT IF U SUB. THE PEACHES FOR APPLES THEN IT WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT! ;O)

This was pretty good.  I'm not really a fan of peaches so next time I will try a different fruit.  The rest of the family liked it though.  I love the cream cheese topping.

I was expecting a lot from this recipe by looking at all the 5 stars.. However, I should say it was a dissapointment. First of all, yes, this is not a pie.
Second, when cream cheese cooks it does not look appealing and the taste changes immediately. Tastes somewhat fine but the smell is not that great. Also, 1/2 sugar was too much for the cream cheese mixture even tough I doubled the cream cheese amount. 3 table spoons syrup also made the mixture way too runny that is why I had to add the extra cream cheese. It barely covered the top. Definitely not something that I will be baking again. Now I have doubts on trying her Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe..

This is an incredible dessert.  I first made it for my husband a year and half ago when we were dating and he swears there will never be another peach dessert that can compare (and he's a southern boy that's had many a peach cobbler). 
I made it for him to enjoy after the rehearsal dinner for our wedding - that's how special it is!

Good pie.  Loved the cream cheese filling.  Would be even better with fresh peaches.
8-15-15 - Made it with fresh peaches.  Used 3 Tablespoons of simple syrup in place of canned peach syrup.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the cream cheese layer.

I have a question. I have not made this yet, though it sounds good. I was wondering, are you supposed to put the flour mixture straight into the pan, or are you supposed to make a crust for it? In the recipe it doesnt call for a crust but some reveiwers speak as if you are supposed to use one. Are you?

Amazing!  This receipe is wonderful.  To tell the truth, I only got one small bite that didn't tell much.  I made it for thanksgiving and the crowd ate it so fast, I didn't get to try it.  My brother-in-law loved it and my husband raved about it.  I will make this again for sure!  And maybe next time I'll get to try it!!!!!

This recipe was ok.  It was simple and it tasted fine, but I was expecting alot more because of some of the reviews.  It's definitely not a pie.  I served it to some guests and they said they liked it, but no one took seconds. My family didn't even eat the left overs, I wound up finishing it off.  I won't be making this again.

This is a great dessert, it always goes over well.  I have made it with apple pie filling, cherry pie filling & blackberries.  I cook the crust for 10 min then add the fruit & topping.  I double the cream cheese topping & cook for 45 min.  It always comes out perfect.

This pie is delicious, and super easy to make.  I got many requests for this recipe and look forward to making it again!  I will buy an extra can of peaches next time though, 29 oz. barely covers the width of a 10-inch pie pan.
Go ahead and make this pie, you'll be glad you did.

Incredible!!  Delicious warm right out of the oven as well as chilled overnight, not sure which way I like it more.  I will try with fresh peaches next.  I doubled the recipe and baked 3, 8'' normal depth pies since i could not find a deep 9'' pan.  TRY THIS RECIPE!

This IS a winner!!  I doubled the recipe for a cake pan, and used fresh peaches. (About 6 large was plenty and be sure to dip in boiling water for a minute to remove the skins.) Since no "syrup", I added a bit of peach nectar. Chilled overnite (a MUST) and my coworkers absolutely loved it.  Thank you!

I am always asked to bring this pie to family gatherings or pot lucks and I have never brought leftovers home.  Because I have made this recipe a number of times I have modified it by adding more of the peach reserve to the cream cheese topping (otherwise i found it rather too sweet and heavy to my liken).  You wont be disappointed with recipe.

We loved this pie.  I didn't put all the cinnamon sugar mixture on it.  It just seemed like too much.  I also had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes before the center would set up, but that could have been my oven.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I took this pie to a local contest on the 4th of July and won!  Everybody loved it!  It is so perfect for summer, but I could also see this as a great Thanksgiving treat.

This was excellent and a good use of peaches.  It seems like an old southern recipe I once had on a plantation at a party when I was very young.  Thank you it brought back that sweet memory.

I made this pie for my husband last night, and he said it's the best pie he ever had......I think so too.  That's something, because I am very hard to please.   I cook like a fiend, but don't like to bake much but I'll definately make this again and again...to die for.......

Tastes great!  However, not many people tried this at our cookout.  The appearance could be jazzed up with a can of Redi-Whip or some Cool-Whip and a decorating bag and star tip.  The whipped cream and some fresh peach slices would help and then when people try it, they will love it.

YUM!  Some good friends came over for dinner this weekend, and I thought this would be a nice summer dessert.  We all loved it.  Someone even said, "This is better than chocolate!"  I'm going to visit family this weekend, and I think I'll bring a pie along!

I would like to say that I didn't think that this "cake" was gonna come out as good as it did  (I wouldn't classify this recipe as a pie at all).  The only thing that I would recommend changing is the cream cheese on top to make it a thicker, and taste more like cheesecake.  The topping was not thick at all.  I think that if it were I would have given this recipe 5 stars.  My fiance had a piece and rated it 9 points out of 10.  It's a reall good cake recipe.

Wow!  This pie is heavenly!  I agree that this pie is absolutely delicious when still warm.  Though I refrigerated the leftovers, I still chose to re-heat it.  Thanks for a great recipe Debbi!

This WAS different from any pie I've made before. My husband really likes canned peaches though, so I thought I'd give it a shot. And no suprise,he really liked the pie. For me, it's good for what it is, nothing fabulous, and I probably wouldn't make it for company. It's very obvious that there's canned peaches in it (duh, I know), so don't make it if you're trying to get a fresh peach taste. And on the bake time, I let mine get golden brown on the edges, which seemed to overcook and dry them out, so next time I'm going to cut back a little to keep it more moist.

My family loved this pie.  It was gone in one sitting.  I used vanilla pudding that has to be cooked (not instant) and used light cream cheese.  I chilled in the refrigerator for a few hours because the pie does have to set and had no problems with it being mushy.  I did bake for a few mintues longer but other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Wonderful pie that we will make again and again!

I used non-instant pudding and baked this in a square 8-inch casserole dish.  I cooked an additional ten minutes because of what other reviewers have said about the crust not being done.  Turns out, I think I cooked it TOO LONG because although the crust was good, it was a little dry.  Also I used low-fat cream cheese and 1% milk with still excellent results.  My only gripe is that the recipe calls for chilling.  After waiting all that time for it to chill, I ended up heating up my seconds in the microwave.  I definitely like the warm version better!

Just as good as the reviews say.  Couldn't find non instant pudding so I used instant, and used low fat cream cheese and lite peaches - turned out great regardless of the changes.  I didn't need to cook the crust first either, so maybe these changes helped that too.  Yum!

My husband and I thought this was a great pie.  I love peaches, so I especially liked it.  I cooked it in a springform pan and didn't precook the crust at all.  Everything turned out perfectly.  The crust is different, so if you go into it thinking to bite into your typical pie crust, you may indeed be surprised by the taste.  It's a different recipe, but it is a great pie.

This was easy, and it tasted ok. I followed the directions exactly, and the center of the pie wasn't cooked enough. The bottom was still sticky. If I try this recipe again, I will have to cook it longer. The crust (which was done) tasted great, so the dough was good. I also think this recipe would taste good with other fruits. I will probably try again...thanks.

I didn't really care for this recipe. It doesn't taste like pie at all. I had tasted some right out of the oven, and it kind of tasted like custard which I don't like at all. Then I tried some after it had chilled, and it was a little better, but I definitely won't be making this again.

honestly, i think i'm doing something wrong because it turned out gluey the first time i made it(the custard part). the second time i tried it with baked pudding and it turned out too runny. however it has potential,and i will try it one more time when i feel lucky!

This was delicious!!  AND I even used INSTANT pudding, so I can't wait to make it using non-instant.  My entire family loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely the best dessert recipe I know!  I use instant vanilla pudding and I think it's best warm and some of my friends like it with vanilla ice cream.

I found this recipe to be one of the best I have ever tried for a different peach dessert. It was easy to prepare and my family loved it. I have been asked for the recipe many times.

This seemed more like something I would serve at a brunch than as a dessert.  Not overly sweet, but good. Easy to throw together.

Good, but not as great as I thought it would be.  Not a pretty pie, had to put cool whip on top and that helped it taste better too.  If you're looking for a different or intersting pie though, this would be a good recipe.

THE CRUST TURNED OUT TO BE A CHEWY, RUBBERY TEXTURE.  THREW MOST OF THE PIE AWAY.  I USED THE EXACT INGREDIENTS CALLED FOR AND BAKED 35 MIN. DOES ANYONE HAVE A CLUE WHY THIS HAPPENED.  I USED A CERAMIC DEEP DISH.

I was right!!!!  The finished product is as delicious as the remains on the spatula!!!!  This was great just out of the oven and chilled.  Thank goodness tonight was not a night that we were having company for dessert as I would have had some explaining to do concerning the spoonfulls that were missing from the finished product!!!  Thanks so much!!!

My husband didn't mind it, though.  It wouldn't be one that I'd make again.

Made this for family for dessert. Although it is made in a pie dish, I wouldnt call this a pie. It reminded me of something that would be baked from a packaged dessert box mix.  Good flavor overall, but I probably would not make this again.

Everyone loved it.  So quick and easy and it tasted great.  I thought the appearance was fine, but I did add a little more cinnamon and sugar.  Maybe the people that thought it was a gooey mess really were looking to eat a pie, this is not very pie like.  We didn't care it was wonderful!  I baked in a Stoneware Round Pan and it fit perfect.

Who would have thought to use pudding for the pie dough.  I have used different flavors of pudding with different fruits and never had a failure.

I used a regular baking pan because who can find a 10 inch deep dish? The crean cheese layer didn't cover what it needed to. Next time, I'll compensate for the issue. Overall, it was OK. Maybe I'll change some things and make it again.

This "pie" is so good!  It may not look pretty, but I love the gooey cream cheese layer.  If I didn't have any self control, I would have eaten the whole thing right away.

While everyone else at Easter dinner raved about this pie--it was the only one that got eaten--I must admit I didn't think it was that great. I thought the "crust" could've been sweeter. I thought it tasted more like a coffee cake than a pie.

I brought this pie to a pot luck dinner at my church. Everyone loved it. This is a very good pie. My doctor says I have to start eating less chocolate so I have been looking for good deserts as replacements. This one is a keeper.

I could (almost) eat this all myself! It's that good! My deep dish pan is 9", not 10", so I leave a little batter and topping out and bake it separately in a small custart-type dish. Delicious "pie"!!

Great recipe!  I've used French vanilla pudding instead of plain vanilla, and I double the crust ingredients (LOVE the crust), and bake in a 9x13 baking dish.  Also, I serve it warm instead of chilled.  Everyone gobbles it up and asks for more.

If you're looking for something unusual and delicious, this is the recipe for you!  Next time, I will add more peaches and I will mix the cinnamon and sugar topping in with the peaches.  This pie is best when served ice cold!  A comfort food to end all comfort foods!!!  Awesome!!!

I made this pie for a meeting where my husband works..He called and said I needed to make another one for the picnic two days after.  I found that it need 15 minutes more baking time, but it was a beautiful pie and very good.

I took this to a neighborhood party and it was a huge hit!!!  The only dish that was nearly gone.  I will definitely make again.  I used a 9 inch pie plate instead of a 10 inch and I should have cooked a little longer.  It was awesome!!!!!

My 10 year old daughter made this pie (completely by herself) and won 2nd place in a local youth pie baking contest.  The contest is connected to a charity auction and the winning pies are auctioned off.  Her pie was sold for $1,200!

Not the best LOOKING dessert I've made, but it sure was delicious!  When I first made it and brought it to my friend's house, both my friends looked at it and said "no thank you."  But after I tasted it and told them it was delicious, they had some and agreed.  I will definitely make it again, I'll just have to make it look "pretty".  LOL.

I have been baking this pie for over 20 years and am constantly asked for the recipe.  My husband always wants me to make it.  He especially loves it warm with vanilla ice cream on the side.

Needed just about 5-10 more minutes to bake.  Family and friends definately loved it.  Have tried cheesecake and french vanilla flavor pudding for variations.  Deep dish pie pan really makes the difference in crust.  Also, let cool slowly before chilling it to let layers set up better.

The was THE BEST peaches dessert that I have ever had.  I didn't have a 10" pan, so I used a 9" and didn't put all of the bottom layer in.  There was none left and friends loved it.  I definantley make this one a lot.  Thanks Debbi!!!

a very tasty pie and easy to make...people think you worked all day on it...lots of praise..will make again and again....the recipe clearly states that you should use the pudding that you cook..not instant.....i have a feeling that the ones that failed used instant pudding...give it another try... it is worth it

My husband loved this recipe, he said it was one of the best pies he's ever tasted.  I even used fat-free cream cheese and imitation butter, some whole wheat in the crust.  I did have to bake it a lot longer.  Great recipe!

I cooked this pie at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, took it out and the crust part was somewhat watery.  I put it back in for an additional 30 minutes.  The crust finally cooked.  It was OK, I doubt I'll make it again.

I made this recipe and found it to be quite watery. I checked to make sure I didn't leave out any ingredients or instructions but I had followed it to the letter. Not sure what went wrong, but won't make this one again.

I made this recipe yesterday for Memorial Day Cookout.  It was gone is 10 minutes.  Everyone loved it and 3 people asked for the recipe.  Very easy to make and tasted delicious.  People said he was refreshing and would be great for a summer dessert.

I guess I expected too much.   The bottom pudding crust mix almost appeared underbaked, but wasn't.
Couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be wet, moist or dry.   Cut nicely and hubby loved it.  Was an interesting combination but something was lacking.

Not a traditional pie (soft, thick crust due to the pudding mix) but quite delicious and rich. The unusual addition of cinnamon and sugar on top of the cream cheese mixture was good. I'll definitely be making this again for my family who loved it.

Everyone loved this pie. I think it needs another 10 minutes in the oven. The center was almost runny.

I think this should be called a dessert instead of a pie. The bottom layer is not a true crust. It is more of a summer cobbler.

I made this pie for a dinner party yesterday, someone brought 3 pies from a bakery. Well, after the party was over, my pie was gone and only half of the other pies were eaten.  It's very easy to make and everyone loved it!

This pie was very good. I wish the cream cheese topping would have firmed up a bit more, as it was a little runny. The pie had good flavor.

Awesome instant crust, and very rich. I need to cook mine a little longer next time because the middle ended up a bit doughy.....but it was so good we ate it anyway!

I HAVE to make a second review on this recipe.  I have a new supervisor, and decided to bring him a piece of this pie... well, he LOVED IT!!!  It's a recipe I've printed more than a couple of times to share with friends who do not have Internet.
Debbie, a standing ovation for you and the pie.

This is an awesome recipe!  Sometimes I use neufchantel instead of cream cheese and skim milk in place of two-percent or whole.  When you really want to indulge, it's excellent with french vanilla ice cream.  Once I made them in tart cups.  They're always a hit!
