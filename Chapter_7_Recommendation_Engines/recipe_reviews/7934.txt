Well, I also put some blueberries in the batter -- YUM.  I also used one of the premade crusts.  Well, I didn't realize that a pie crust is half the size of a 9" spring pan, so I had TWO pie sized cakes!  I had to give some away!  I also made some blueberry sauce out of a cup or two of blueberries (frozen or fresh), 1/8 c sugar, and about 2 tsp cornstarch (heated on the stove until thick).  It turned out FABULOUS.

First of all, there are so many different types of cheesecakes out there and they all taste different and have different textures. I did not change anything to the recipe and it was perfect. I made it for a company picnic and everyone loved it! Amazing Recipe!!

As always i took some tips from other reviews and changed a few things in the recipe. First, instead of gramcracker crumbs i used a whole box of (minus 2 or 3) SANDIES shortbread cookies for the crust. Doubled the butter to go with that. I like thick crust. I added 1/2 C. frozen blueberries to the batter. With the rest of the blueberries i combined them with 1/3 C. Red rasberry jam and 1/3 C. sugar. Mix and set aside. I always cook for the amount of time suggested and then turn my oven off and let the cheese cake cool by it self in the oven for 2-4 hours. I don't get any cracks in the top of my cake that way.
Thank you for a differnt idea (Blueberries) for cheesecake. Mrs. Morrison

This recipe came out great!  I made a couple changes though.  I used 1 package regular cream cheese and 1 of low fat instead of both regular.  I also made a sauce out of some extra blueberries instead of using jam.  The only thing is you have to eat it within a day or 2, otherwise the blueberries get a little funky.

Incredibly good!!  I used Peggy Ellender's tips on cheesecake making and NO cracks, amazing crust, and followed recipe as is.  Graham cracker crust is baked for 10 min. @ 350.  Cool before pouring in cheesecake mixture.  For cooking, I didn't try to wrap Springform pan w/foil, I put a cookie sheet with water in it on the bottom rack, and preheated to 350 (same as crust), turn to 250 soon as cheesecake goes in for 1.5 hrs.  Turn off and leave in oven (door closed) for 3 hours for slow cooling.  Refrigerate, then before serving, add blueberries.  I used way more than 1/3 cup jelly! This is an AMAZINGLY good recipe and 3rd time I followed above.  Store bought quality with ALL organic ingredients.  MMMmmm MMM

This recipe doesn't taste good at all!  Maybe it was the frozen blueberries.  The mixture of ingredients is not the consistency that cheesecake is normally.  Fresh blueberries might be helpful -  also, reduce the number of eggs.

Excellent cheescake variety! I prefer to add blueberries IN the batter to have blueberries in every bite, but it is still good. Jam accents the taste. Good deal!

This is a great recipe, however I made a few adjustments and it was delicious!
Instead of adding two packages of regualr cream cheese, I substituted one of them with a light strawberry cream cheese. I added 3 tbsp of fresh lemon juice. I added 3 eggs as apposed to 4, and I used blueberry pie filling rather then the fresh blueberries.  
I kept the same cooking time and let the cake cool off in the oven for a couple hours. Everybody loved this recipe. Thanks!

This came out very tasty but here are some changes I made/will make next time:
1) used 2 cups of graham crackers with correct ratio of butter and sugar. (It would have been way too thin of a crust had I only done the one cup)
2) will use only 3 eggs instead of the 4 so it's less souffley
3) added a little fresh lemon juice to batter but will add some lemon zest to add more flavor
3) placed parchment paper at the bottom so when it cools I placed it on a plate inside a cake cover for easy transport.
4) used (chilled) blueberry pie filling for the topping after it cooled in the fridge and it was quick and yummy!
5)one hour baking made browning on the edges so would probably bake for only 45 minutes next time as it is suppose to be jiggly when out of the oven and the cooling process and chilling will settle and make it dense. 

Enjoy!

This was not good at all.  First of all, I followed this recipe exactly and it sank big time.  Way too many eggs...it tasted more like a souffle than a cheesecake.

A very easy and delicious cheesecake recipe!! I only changed 1 thing in the recipe and that was to double the amount of jelly in order to completely cover all of the frozen blueberries - you need to seal all of the blueberries! I made this for a family birthday party and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely be making this one again!!

This was a delicious and easy recipe.  I used a can of blueberries instead.  I drained them and put 1/2 of them in the cheesecake.  I used the leftover juice to make a compote.  After chilling I added the remaining blueberrie and put them on the top.  Great recipe danube66!

Very good cheesecake recipe. I baked it in a 7x11 dish, used only three eggs, and decorated it with blueberries and strawberries for a 4th of July theme. Definitely would make it again!

Excellent taste. Was a big hit.  Not too sweet, just right.  I used only 3 eggs and put homemade strawberry jam for topping.  Will use blueberries next time.

This was a very easy cheesecake to make.  I think it needs just a touch of lemon rind to give the flavor a boost for our taste buds. Other than that it is perfection. Thank you JJOHN32!

Good but not great.  Will try using lemon juice next time as it was a bit bland.  Best to eat the next day after it's been refrigerated over night or you'll be eating custard.

YUM!!! My only change was, I used 1 whole fat cream cheese and 1 low fat, I also used low fat sour cream. I gotta cut fat where I can. Also, I folded in fresh blueberries and chilled over night. Great recipe!

Fabulous.  Easy.  My first cheesecake and it was wonderful.  I've made it twice and it was a success both times.

I loved this recipe! This is the first time I've ever successfully made a baked cheesecake.  All my other attempts were dismal failures and I had vowed to stick to no-bake forever, until my husband made a request for real cheesecake, so I tried this one.  I just used a blueberry filling recipe to cook my fresh blueberries to put on top instead of jelly.  This is awesome!

I did not like it much.  It did not have that cheesecake taste to me or my family.  It seemed more like a custardy type??  It was my first cheesecake, but I followed the recipe step by step..

This was a good cheesecake, but I like the William Sonoma blueberry cheese cake a lot better. It has less ingredients and tastes AMAZING! With this one I don't like to use the jelly, but instead I like to use only fresh berries. Strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are good as well the blueberries. Sometimes we have a whole bunch of different berries on ours. I also like to use to use shortbread cookie crumbs instead of graham crackers. It think it just takes delicious. But all in all this was a pretty good recipe. I would make it again.

This cheesecake came out great! I was expecting it to have cracks, sink in the middle or brown on top, but it looked perfect! And it was delicious. I also put some pureed frozen blueberries in the batter.

I used a pre-made crust, so I made a half recipe - which was the perfect amount. I also added blueberries to the cheese cake and made a blueberry sauce with about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries, 1/8 cup of sugar, 2 tsp of corn starch and 1 tb of water (as suggested by a previous reveiw). I will make this again, but think it would benefit from some lemon or lime juice in the cheese cake.

I used a pre-made 10" graham cracker crust and still had batter left over to make another pie... I added fresh blueberries to the batter and used blueberry pie filling for the topping instead of the one suggested... It turned out great!! Was told it was the best blueberry cheesecake he had ever had!! Super easy to make too!!

I did not care for this recipe. I bake a lot, but was in a mad rush and couldn't find my go-to recipe, so I chose this one. Firstly, the crust needs to be baked separately for 5 mins. or so, otherwise it just doesn't come together. I also think the cheesecake should be baked in a water bath or something - mine cracked HORRIBLY all the way to the bottom. I will not even touch this recipe again.

I LOVE this recipe!  It's a real favorite for my husband's birthday (and he's really picky when it comes to desserts).  I like to fold a few blueberries into the cream cheese mixture just before pouring it into the pan.

I hate giving negative reviews but I have to on this one.  It didn't have that cheesecake taste to it, like others have said it is more of a custard resemblance. It also fell and broke,  but maybe if adding a water tray underneath would help. I just was not impressed with this one....sorry!!

My 1st attempt at made from scratch cheesecake....WONDERFUL! After reading other reviews I made some changes (their tips and necessity because of what I had available to use)
 Alterations: (I don't own a spring pan)
(1) premade Graham pie crust 
(1) 9" round cake pan with Nabisco Graham    
        Cracket Crumbs pressed into using pie crust 
         recipe on box.
(1) 8 oz Regular cream cheese
(1) 8 oz Neufchatel Low fat cream cheese
(3) eggs, not 4
1/4 cup sugar + 1/2 cup Splenda (ran out of 
        sugar)
Short squirt of lemon juice (maybe could have used a little bit more)
I also added frozen and fresh blueberries to the cheesecake batter. 

Baked as shown but when done I shut off the oven and left it open a little to cool them slowly. No cracks in either cheesecake! Tried to make blueberry topping of my own...laked flavor, but I only put it on one cheesecake. Chilled in frig overnight. The cheesecakes themselves however were FANTASTIC!  Great texture and flavor.

So far, I’ve doubled the recipe and added a large box of vanilla instant pudding. It’s still in the oven...it overflowed. My ovens a mess. I hope it tastes good. I’ve got canned cherry pie filling to top it with. 
Will update....

My family and I loved this cheesecake.  I followed the Recipe exactly but my spring form pan is 10.5 inches so I was a little short on topping.   I did put a pan of water in the bottom shelf of my oven while baking.  No cracks at all.  I will be making this many times in the future.

Flavor was OK but this DEFINITELY needs some changes.  Split severely just five minutes after removing from oven!!

I'd suggest a water bath.

I didn't have a spring form pan but I did have graham cracker crust pie tins, so I used those. I would say for my first time making cheesecake it turned out pretty well. Still doesn't taste like store bought but that's OK. It was much easier than I had expected.  I also didn't have the jelly, the blueberries made their own juice.

Really good. I was able to make it with our smart oven. Will probably make some slight adjustments with the cream cheese and butter next time just to make the cheesecake creamier and the crust more buttery.

Followed the recipe to the T with the exception of the topping. It turned out really well, so delicious. Mine was a bit short, but it was an excellent cheesecake. I would recommend not doing a blueberry jam topping but a proper blueberry sauce though.

I made this but used homemade blueberry preserves on top. Husband doesn't usually like cheese cake, but said this was delicious!

By far the best cheesecake recipe I have tried. Texture was smooth and creamy and the taste was rich and delicious. I only used 3 eggs (was all I had) and it still turned out fantastic. Recipe was easy to follow and had a reasonable amount of ingredients. It cracked a bit on the top -- can someone please tell me what to do to keep that from happening?  Other than that, it was perfect!

I am pretty much a cheesecake novice so I am pleased to say that this turned out exactly as advertised. Blueberry jelly wasn't available at my store so I substituted blueberry jam with no added sugar. This worked except that I should have used maybe half a cup instead of a third.

My family and I agree that it did NOT taste like cheesecake. This had a custard taste to it, and I don't think I will be doing this recipe again unfortunately.

I love this cheesecake! Instead of frozen blueberries and jelly, I used Smuckers blueberry preserves. I just heated it a bit on the stovetop for a spreadable consistency. As with any cheesecake, you need to bake this in a water bath to avoid cracking, even if the recipe doesn't specify that.

This recipe is wonderful, however it is plenty in volume for a 9x13 pan, then topped with sweetened fruit, such as blueberries.  I discovered this when I doubled it for a cake pan.  It is way to tall  and hung over the edges slightly.  It is yummy!!!

Needs to be cheesier. It wasn't very flavorful. Next time I'm going to add more cream cheese.

I made this cake for my uncle because he loves cheesecake and blueberries, and it was a major success! Everyone was very impressed. It had perfect consistency, I wouldn't change a thing! I did have to make an extra bath of the graham cracker bottom though because my pan was a little bigger, but it was absolutely delicious!

The result is a very bland cheesecake with poor texture. Not worth the expense of the ingredients, which was about $9 by my reckoning.

My two year old loves this recipe, and it's even better when you substitute huckleberries for the blueberries.
