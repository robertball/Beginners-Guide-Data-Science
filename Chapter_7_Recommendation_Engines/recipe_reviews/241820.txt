Mom was up for daughter's baby shower, loves a cookie after dinner.   I saw this recipe and felt it was a perfect match (she likes pecan sandies).  The batch came out, taste tested myself before serving and knew I had a winner.  Mom nodded in agreement when I served her.  I think I will replace the pecan topping with  a few mini chocolate chips next time....a personal sweet thing.  Sweet and salty is good!

I'm a little biased here - these cookies are the best I've had.

Nice for a change cookie!  Halved the sugar as I always do and used dark rum instead of extract.

Nice change for a cookie. Tastes alot like french toast. I used 1TBSP of maple syrup instead of rum, & added 1/2 tsp Baking Powder so they didnt flatten out as much as others said they would. Turned out GREAT. Not a very big batch, though. Double the recipe if you have kids, or they're for a crowd. Will definitely make again-Great breakfast cookie!!

My cookies came out flat.  I read on line that adding baking powder would have prevented it from flattening out.  They tasted good but was not visually appealing.  Might try again some other time adding baking powder to see if that fixes it.

Delicious!  Easy to make and smells amazing!  I omitted the 1/2 cup of pecans and it was still delicious and the pecans on top made it seem like a fancy cookie.  I didnâ€™t have any coarse salt but will get some for my next batch- might also try a light chocolate drizzle in the future.  This will become one of my go-to cookie recipes.

Good flavor, easy to make.  Multiple family members say these are a keeper so they will go in the cookie rotation.  I don't think the name fits though, and am trying to come up with a new one.

I followed the recipe and the cookies came out a little flatter then I had expected. My husband liked these cookies more then I did.
