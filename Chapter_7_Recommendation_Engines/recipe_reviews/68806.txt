I'm one of those weird people who don't like their food to touch on their plate, so wasn't sure how I'd like these flavors all mixed together, but it was quite good, just needed a bit of tweaking to get more flavor.  This is how I changed it up the second time to account for our family's taste & we all thought it was OUTSTANDING! I used 2 lb ground turkey which I seasoned w/garlic powder, pepper & cilantro, substituted a can of tomatoes w/green chiles for the diced tomatoes, used 2 packages taco seasoning, omitted the water & used 1/2 cup salsa instead, used 2 packages Jiffy corn muffin mix & mixed the corn in with the mix.  Put a very thin layer of the corn bread mix on the bottom, then layered as directed, throwing in a layer of shredded taco/mexican cheese before topping w/the remainder of the corn bread mix.  Garnished w/fresh chopped tomatoes, green onions, black olives & non-fat sour cream to make it more visually appealing.

Excellent!  This is what I changed and it still turned out great.  I added 1 can of refried beans after I added the taco seasoning & water.  I made up 2 boxes of Jiffy corn muffin mix instead of 1 and I put the black olives under the corn.  I had a nice corn muffin top.  It was very good!  2 of us ate 1/2 of the 9X13 pan (oink oink!)

Absolutely delicious!!! I took it to a potluck and it was a hit. I doubled the corn muffin mix as reviewers had suggested which was perfect - one box would not have been enough to cover. I used 1/2 the water suggested in recipe which was perfect - the amount in recipe seemed like it would make it too watery. I used Mexicorn which was great in it; also put 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese ontop before the cornbread layer. So good!!!

I made this with approx. two pounds of lean turkey burger instead of beef.  Also used two packages of corn bread.  Tasted great, the whole family loved it.  Next time I'll add a bean of some kind and maybe add some cheese under the corn bread too.  I'll make this one again for sure!

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious!  My entire family raved about it.  I made a couple minor changes, most suggested by previous reviewers.  I added black beans over the beef mixture, lots of cheese, and doubled the cornbread topping.  Even my picky eaters loved it, and hubby couldn't get enough!  Thank you, thank you for sharing!

My husband and I thought this was good and I plan on making it again.  I made some changes to the recipe...I added minced garlic to the onion/beef mixture and added a can of kidney beans (which I grounded up in a food processor) to the meat because I didn't have the required amount of beef on hand.  I also used salsa instead of diced tomatoes (as I didn't have diced tomatoes).  I took others' suggestions of adding corn and cheese to the cornbread mixture.  I used an 8X10 inch pan and had just barely enough cornbread mixture to cover the beef.  It was good!

I messed up earlier and gave this sucker a 4 star rating instead of 5.  Half way through, I found I had no cornbread muffin mix so I replaced that layer with a mixture of:
1c Bisquik
1/2c Milk
1/2c Water
4 Crushed Taco Shells
and some Shredded Cheddar Cheese.

Turned out really well, the family thought it was good and the boys actually asked for more.

I would actually cook this upside-down next time so more of the flavor can get into the breading and it can be served as a bowl.

Outstanding! Just the comfort food we needed on this chilly Autumn night! A couple of slight changes though... First, use taco sauce or salsa instead of water, it just adds way more flavor. And second, add a layer of shredded pepper jack cheese over the corn before pouring on the cornbread batter. Also, use a smaller casserole dish than designated so that one package of corn muffin mix will be enough. If you go with the 9x13, you'll need 2 packages for sure. Hubby and I really enjoyed this and will definitely be making it again! Mucho gracias to MICHARD for posting this one!

I added corn to the corn topping and also added some green chiles to both the topping and the beef mixture.  Nice!  Cumin as suggested was a nice addition, also, as well as extra taco seasoning.

I for one, am so happy that you didn't have any potatoes the night you came up with this clever little idea. It was so darn good and everyone loved it! For me it was even quicker to put together because I had leftover taco meat in the freezer. I added salsa in lieu of the tomatoes and because I mistakingly opened a can of C of M soup, I threw that in too. Thanks so much!!

A little bland for me the first time around. Second time though, I used chipotle diced tomatoes, two jalapenos, and a can of kidney beans. Yum.

Based on the other comments and the amount of beef, I used 2 packs of taco seasoning and double the water.  For one batch of cornbread I used a 9x9 pan and am freezing about 1/3 of the beef mix for a smaller batch of this.  We liked it!  This is my hubby's comment "It was a great pie. Not sure if it had anything to do with shepards, though. Mexican or otherwise." lol  Thanks for the recipe, sure makes an easy, cozy dinner!

I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground beef , added a cup of salsa, while it was cooking in addition to a little extra seasoning to kick it up a bit... however, personally felt it was going to be a lil runny, so when I sprayed my pan be fore adding the meat mixute, I added a couple of handfuls of crushed tortilla chips to give it a bottom crust. Everyone tore it up and was scraping the pan for the last bites..saving this one to make more often. served mine with a side of refried beans.

I have made this twice already. Used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix, threw in some black beans, used rotel instead of plain tomatoes because that's what I had. Layered some grated cheese under the cornbread. Made it with beef once, turkey the next. Both tasted great. Comfort food at its' best!

A nice, simple recipe good for a weeknight. Instead of tomatoes, I added 3/4 can of tomato sauce (didn't have tomatoes) and no water. I think the olives and cheese on top did give it a little more visual appeal. If I made it again, I would add 2 boxes of cornbread or make it in a smaller pan, 13x9 was a little too big for the cornbread to cover the pan thoroughly.

5 stars with the changes I made.  1st off, this can totally be a one dish recipe if you have a big enough pan that can go in the oven.  Cooked beef and onion, added tomotoes, green chilies and taco season.  topped with corn, black beans and mexican cheese.  Used 2 boxes of jiff corn mix.  then threw into oven as directed.  YUM!

loved it!  increased meat to 2 lbs and doubled the corn, cornbread, taco seasoning, and tomatoes.  Also added a can of black beans.  Enough to fill a 10x14 in baking dish!

Beginner's tips: (1) I used 1/2 tsp minced garlic with the onions and beef, so it should be about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp garlic powder. (2) 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. (3) You'll need 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk for the muffin mix. (4) It's perfect in an 11x7 pan! There's not enough food for a 9x13. (5) You can start preparing the muffin mix when you add the taco seasoning and water, so the batter can stand for a few minutes. If you follow the recipe to a T, and cook the ingredients over a medium-high heat for the specified times, it won't be too watery. This is delicious! The first time I made it I forgot the corn so I put it on top of the batter before baking it. I had to microwave it for 2 minutes to finish cooking the batter. It looked weird but still was quite tasty. Thanks for a keeper!!

I enjoyed the corn muffin top.  I added the corn to the meat/tomato mixture.  Next time I will also add kidney or black beans.  If you make the recipe as stated it the meat mix and corn only covers the bottom thinly in a 9x13 pan.  Also, to make a decent corn bread topping it requires two packages of corn muffins mix.  I will do that for sure next time.  I would make this again.

Yumm.  I put green chilies in the cornbread like someone suggested and thought it was great.  I only used one box of Jiffy mix and wish I would have used two like many people said.  I also put refried beans in the bottom of my pan to streatch the meal.  Great Dinner.

I use ground turkey and usually add diced onion or pepper or both. This is a great easy and hearty recipe. When I was pregnant I assembled the recipe in small foil bread loaf pans without adding the cornbread mix. I froze them so that when the baby arrived it was easy to defrost on the counter and when my husband got home all he had to do was add water to complete cornbread mix, spread it on and bake it. We had individual hot and filling meals. I did the same for other expectant moms and they all agreed it was a lifesaver. Plus the dads can brag that they "cooked" dinner

This is a very good recipe.  Like others, I doubled the corn muffin mix.   Didn't use the water, added some cilantro paste to the mixture.   Added tomatoes with chilies, and put cheese under the cornbread mix before baking.    There are lots of additions to this that you can try- sour cream, scallions, etc.  Very easy to make and a fast dinner.

Ehh average. The filling was good with addition of fresh minced garlic but the cornbread topping was just alright.

This is very much like a "tamale pie."  I took the advice of several other reviewers and doubled the corn muffin mix which made enough to place a thin layer on the bottom of the baking dish and still plenty to cover the top.  If I make this again I wouldn't use corn muffin mix -- it's too sweet, especially given that the corn is sweet as well.  I'd use a regular cornbread mix instead and use buttermilk instead of sweet milk when mixing.    Instead of spreading the corn between the meat layer and the corn muffin topping I mixed it directly into the muffin batter.  It came out nicely.  I used two cans of Rotel tomatoes (tomatoes with green chiles) in place of the one can of diced tomatoes, and also doubled the taco seasoning.  We like things fairly spicy and this gave the casserole a nice medium heat.

OMG! This was so yummy. I did change the recipe up a whole lot, but most of the ingredients stayed the same. First, I baked 2 boxes of cornbread mix in a 9x13 pan for 20 mins on 400 degrees. When that was done I started browning my onion and beef.  After fully cooked I drained the grease, added the tomatoes, the corn, garlic salt (i didnt have powder and I omitted the salt and pepper all together) and the taco seasoning and let simmer. Then I spread a layer of warmed refried beans on top of the corn bread (there was not enough in one can, but too much in 2 cans, so I used about 1 and 1/2 cans). The beef mixture was done by now and I spread that on top of the beans. Awesome result!!! My oldest daughter added cheese and sour cream to the top. I just added sour cream and my husband ate it without adding anything else. We all loved it and will add to the rotation. I was going to try this again following the direction exactly, but this was so yummy I cant bring myself to changing the way I did it.

This is a simple quick recipe that proved to be great. I tweaked it a little by adding 1 can of black beans and 1 can of chilis and tomatoes. I used 2 cups of cheese since we are cheese lovers in the house. I also made my own cornbread for the topping. My girls loved it. This recipe will be in our dinner rotation for sure.

My family loves this dish.  I don't usually use an entire 1 1/2 lbs of beef; that dilutes the seasoning too much.  The recipe is better with only 1 or 1 1/4 lbs of beef.

Everyone ate this, from the little guys to the old guys, so it is a 5 in my book.  I did make some changes just for personal preference.  I am sure you wouldnt have to.  My tomatoes were garlic & onion, w/juice so I omitted adding the extra water.  Rotel would have been fine also, but I wasnt sure about the little ones.  The taco seasoning was Taco Seasoning I from this site.  I added the corn and black olives to the meat, along with cilantro and red pepper.  I meant to add a cheese layer but forgot, but I am glad because it didnt need it and that saved some calories.  My cornbread mix, I used creamed corn for most of the moisture along with a little milk (and the egg) and I added some cilantro also.  One cornbread would not have covered it but probably could have worked okay as more of a swirl, like in a cobbler.  I had to bake longer but not much.  This one will stay in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This whole pan nearly disappeared in one sitting.  I liked mine with a little sour cream on it.  Followed directions exactly.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this! The only changes I made was to omit the water completely, use a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, put the cheese under the cornbread layer and instead of corn I used diced squash from the garden since we have squash coming out of ears. I thought this was wonderful and will be putting it into our rotation.

This recipe is a good start but I took the suggestions of others... Sauteed onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Added beef and browned. Used just 1 packet of low sodium seasoning but also added 1/4 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili powder to "doctor it up". Added 3/4 cup salsa instead of water and a can of black beans (rinsed). For corn bread mix I combined 2 boxes of Jiffy, 2 eggs, 2/3 cup milk, 2/3 cup frozen fire roasted corn (chopped in food processor for few seconds beforehand) and 1/2 cup mexican cheese.  Assembled dish by spreading very thin layer of corn bread mix on bottom of 9x13 pyrex to start; followed my meat mixture; light sprinkle of more frozen fire roasted corn (left whole this time); light sprinkle of mexican cheese; and finished by spreading the remaing corn bread mix on top.  Since I used a pyrex I baked at 375 (you really shouldn't put in higher than 350 but I've found I can get away with 375 if I don't remove the dish immediately and let sit after I turn oven off...it's all about avoiding sudden temp change) for 30-35 min. Topped with sour cream and green onions.  Served with salad on the side for a delicious and complete meal.

So yummy!!  We altered it slightly and used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos, 1/2 the water called for, a bit more taco seasoning and added a layer of mexi cheese over the meat and corn.  We also topped it with two packages of corn bread (one would never have been enough to cover the dish).  One pkg. plain corn bread mix and one mexi cornbread.  It was awesome!  Might add the black beans and/or kidney beans next time.  Delicious!!

I loved this. I followed some of the adjustments people made. I did 2 pounds of meat and 2 packages of seasoning. I actually forgot to add the can of tomatoes, so will add the next time I make it. I put a good layer of cheese on before I added to 2 boxes of cornbread. I did add a small can of chopped green chiles in with the corn. This is getting added into my rotation for easy dinners.

This was quite good.  I have tried several different Mexican casseroles and this one is one of the better ones.  For our tastes I added a small jar of chopped green chilies with the tomatoes and baked the olives and cheese right in the casserole underneath the corn bread.  I used a smaller but deeper dish than 9x13 and see that if I would have used a 9x13 their would not have been enough corn bread to cover the top like others have mentioned.

HINT: USE CAN OF **HOT** ROTEL in place of the tomatoes.  This is what I changed besides the can of rotel.  Put the corn in with the muffin mix and added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to this mix also.  I used 1 box as that is all I had...IT DOES  **NOT** NEED AN ADDITIONAL BOX.  that would make it way too thick...it was on the verge w/ just the 1 box.  I used a 9x13 glass dish, I did have to bake this an extra 10 minutes.  Even my 18 months old daughter chowed this down.  Very good....a KEEPER!  Thanks!

My hubby liked this dish...said it reminded him of one his mom made when he was growing up.  He wants to add peppers and more onions though.  I had to double the corn bread b/c mine wouldn't spread out to cover the whole dish so it tasted more bready than meaty.  Maybe next time I'll thin down the corn bread so it will spread better.  But hubby said he liked it that way.  Also, I only had 1 lb. hamburger meat.  I will also put cheese IN the dish next time instead of garnish it with the cheese.  It was really yummy...I will definately make it again.

I think I oversalted, forgetting that there's salt in the taco seasoning. But it still came out really good. Next time, I think I'll make it in a 9x9 or 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 so that the layers are thicker.

Giving it 4 stars since I'm sure this is my fault.  I really, really wanted to love this, but had some troubles - the corn bread didn't cook and took forever (I kept having to take it out and sticking a tooth pick in it for an extra 15 minutes - I used Jiffy).  The layer closest to the corn mixture was what didn't cook. Doubled the corn bread as others mentioned but probably would stick to dropping it in spoonfuls and not being so anal about covering every open corner with only 1 box next time.  Also added most of a can of black beans to stretch the recipe further and used a half beef half turkey mix.  The flavor is good but the cornbread just overwhelmed everything, and I love my cornbread!

YUM. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made two batches of corn muffin mix (I use a recipe from this site instead of the box). I omitted the olives because I don't like them. I loved how easy this recipe is.

Fantastic! I doubled the meat and taco seasoning. Cooked till most water was gone. Mixed corn and olives in with meat. I used two smaller pans and divided mix between them. Then I wrapped and froze one for later. The other I added all the cheese to top before adding Muffin mix to top. When I use the frozen one I will top it with same amount of cheese and 1 package muffin mix. Wonderful recipe.

Very tasty. I did make a few adjustments based on other reviews. I used 2lbs ground beef. Instead of regular diced tomatoes, I bought chipotle diced tomatoes. I added a layer of black beans along with a layer of cheese and black olives before the top layer of corn muffin mix. I also used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix instead of just 1 and I'm glad I did. And I mixed in some extra cheese into the muffin mix as well. I'm sure I'll be making this again! Everybody really loved it.

This was a hit at my house, including a picky two and four year old.  I didn't use quite as much ground beef (probably closer to a pound) as the recipe called for and baked it in a 8x8 casserole dish.  Still came out great!

I needed a recipe last minute and thought about a Mexican type casserole and came upon this recipe. I made a few changes. I added re-fried beans and a few corn tortillas to layer it more. I also used corn on the cob that I cut the corn off and cooked it once I added the can of tomatoes. I also chopped my black olives and added them to the layers of meat sauce as I layered with beans, tortillas and cheese. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I added mozzarella and even though the cheese was a little stringy, it tasted good. I only had a can of the chipotle tomatoes in the cabinet and they made a great substitution. I also didn't have any "taco seasoning mix", so I added a little chili powder and cumin in place. I made this for tonight's dinner, middle of summer, so I cooked in the toaster oven. It burnt my bottom corn tortilla and turned it hard, due to it the dish being so close to the heat, but other than that, the rest of the casserole was great. My husband and daughter both commented that they liked it and between the 3 of us, we polished half of it off (and it was pretty big, I made three layers). Thanks for a great idea, we'll have it again!

I LOVE this dish!  It has become a favorite in our house.  I make it with ground turkey and it is fantastic!  I also mix the cheese into the corn bread mix.

Good comfort food with a twist. I used two boxes of corn bread and cut down the water amount as I read in other reviews, but I think I would have preferred a tad more meat and having it be a little more moist. Used lean ground turkey and a little not so lean. Came out great, but maybe next time just go for the less lean turkey.

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written and found the meat filling to be bland, the topping horribly dry and crumbly and tinny tasting.

I had to do a little tweaking with this recipe. Instead of using taco seasoning, I simply used garlic and salt to flavor the ground beef. I also doubled the recipe, using 3 lb of beef with 2 cans each of the veggies. I used 4 boxes of corn muffin mix...but it came out way too "bready" so the next time I only used 3 boxes. Also when doubling this recipe, I have to turn the heat down on the oven and let it cook a little longer to make sure all the corn bread gets cooked through.

Mike, Jess and I quite liked this. Very carbo-y, and spicy, good flavor. Def make again. Too much corn bread to meat ratio, and the corn bread was sweet....didn't like that. Mike wants to try it with mashed tatties on top, and I want to double the amount of meat! Couldn't taste the cheese in the cornbread, probably could leave that out, or melt some on top towards the end of the baking cycle.

Easy recipe.  It's a little mild for our tastes.  Next time I will add jalapenos and some cilantro in the meat mixture.

this was great!! i was skeptical at first, but it turned out really good and my husband and i loved it. very simple and quick to make, using a lot of stuff you probably have on hand. I put cheese on top of the meat mix, and used 2x the amount of cornbread mix as suggested. Definitely keeping this recipe!

Not a wow recipe for us.  The meat portion was a little bland and I believe if I were to make it again I would significantly reduce the amount of water and up the spices by adding green chiles, cumin, etc.  I used Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread in place of the boxed mix and that was the best part of the dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very yummy recipe...my 8 year old had seconds.  I hate to modify recipes the first time I make them but I did make a few changes per the other reviewers suggestions and it turned out great.  I used the canned tomatoes with diced green chili's and spices added.  I also added Mexican blend shredded cheese over the corn/under the corn bread.  I did double the topping which was good but next time I will also use more ground beef...at least 2 pounds.  This didn't quite take 20 minutes to bake in my oven and it was baked all the way through.  I served it with more shredded cheese, sliced olives, tomatoes, and sour cream as toppings.

This was really tasty.  My family totally loved it.  I did double the muffin mix for the top.  I also cooked the beef mixture in an oven-proof skillet, then popped the whole thing in the oven.  One pan cooking always makes me happy!

Really great idea!  Just made this for my 2 teenaged boys who LOVED it!  I modified the recipe by adding some corn and shredded cheddar in the corn muffin mix.  Then I spread  2/3 of the prepared muffin mixture in bottom of pie pan, meat mixture on top, layer of corn on top of that and finally spread remaining muffin mixture around edges of pan, leaving large open circle in middle.  This will be on the regular menu for us!

We loved the idea of a Mexican Shepard's Pie, we made it healthier by reducing the ground meat to 1 lb and using ground turkey instead of beef, then I cooked in two bell peppers (orange & yellow) a finely diced jalapeno, and a can of black beans. We also placed a layer of fat free refried beans over the meat and veggie mixture, placed some low-fat shredded cheese over that and then topped with corn and the cornbread mix. It was DELICIOUS! This is definitely a new family favorite!

The whole family loved this. Quick, easy and satisfying. Used Rotel tomatoes because that's what I had in the house. Also, put the cheese on top of the corn. 1 box of corn mix is plenty, you just need to spread it carefully.

This was really good.  The whole family ate it and liked it.  I did not use a whole onion and added some chopped garlic to the meat.  I added a few tablespoons of salsa when I added the tomatoes.  I also added a can of pinto beans, that I rinsed first, to the meat mixture.  I put the olives on top of the layer of corn.  Like others I used two boxes of cornbread mix, but I added the cheese to the mix instead of putting it on top.  Oh, and for the taco seasoning I used Taco Seasoning I from this site.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

This is really good. So quick and easy to prepare. I mixed the corn right in with the meat mixture. I used an 8X10 pan and the cornbread mix was just enough. Next time I may use salsa and chili beans for something a little different. Thanks for a great recipe!

I hear this is delicious - but all I got back was an empty pyrex dish when I sent it with my husband for a guy's weekend.  They literally called me long distance and raved about it.  My tweaks included:  an additional half cup or so of hot salsa, my own corn bread muffin mix for top, my own taco seasoning blend with lots of it to balance the sweetness of the topping.  A real man pleaser at my house.  I'll have to make it again soon in order to get a taste for myself!

I made this last night for dinner and it was very tasty!! I used Bobs Red Mill stone ground cornmeal muffin mix instead of corn muffin mix and it made plenty for a 9x13 pan.  I used 1/2 c salsa in place of water, mixed in one can of black beans with the cooked meat/onion/tomato/seasoning mixture, added a thin layer of the cornmeal mixture on the bottom of the pan, topped with meat and bean mixture,added a layer of pepperjack cheese and some sharp cheddar then topped with remaining cornmeal mixture.  I topped with the olives the last 15 min of baking time.  I don't know if it's because I used a different cornmeal mix or just more of it but I did have to increase baking time to 45 min and had to drop oven temp to 350 after 30 min to prevent the edges getting to brown.  This was great topped with salsa and sour cream!!

Very good!  My substitutes included using 2/3c of water (as the taco mix suggested) instead of 3/4c and I added 1c of cheese on top of the meat mixture.

I loved this!  I added a can of black beans to the hamburger mixture for extra fiber/protein and use tomato puree instead of diced tomatos because of my picky husband.  I also used 1 lb of hamburger instead of 1.5 lb and baked in a 9x9 pan.  Perfect for just 2 people and you have enough for a little left overs.  Thanks for this recipe, I'll definately be making this again.

This is quite tasty.  Next time, though, I would either use more hamburger and corn, or cook it in an 8" x 8" pan.  The hamburger and corn layers were not thick enough.  This could also be made without the Mexican flare by using dry brown gravy mix instead of taco seasoning.

Way too easy and even my picky eater liked it. Cooked the hamburger in garlic and cilatro and topped the corn layer with cheese. Might try adding a layer of refried beans too.

So incredibly easy, great comfort food.  Greatest part was finding out that it only took 40 minutes total to prepare, not one hour as stated in the recipe, even though I cooked and stripped fresh corn on the cob in place of canned.  This will definitely be in my recipe file - thanks!

made it frequently; lots of shepherd's pie versions here but once I tried this one I quit looking, mainly because of the cornbread and no potatoes. Spice it up a bit Texas style and its a big hit.

If you use ground beef to make this, then it is called Cottage Pie.  Shepard's Pie is made with ground lamb.  Something I learned while living in England.

Mexican Shepherd's Pie Haiku: "This was pretty bland. Even served with 'stuff' on the side. Cornbread needed jazz." We had to serve ours w/ shredded lettuce, salsa, grated Mexican-blend cheese, and tomatoes to enjoy this b/c it was fairly bland. I made it as directed except only used 1 lb. of ground beef, which I found was more than enough for a 9X13 pan. As other reviews have mentioned, one cornbread mix doesn't quite cover the surface, but I only had one, so I transferred half of the taco meat mixture to a round pie-dish, bagged and froze the rest for another random taco dinner night, then proceeded w/ just the one packet of cornbread mix on top. Upon serving it (schlooop! It squishes and doesn't quite come out in any wedge that would resemble pie) we realized that the cornbread was just so ... boring. If I were to make this again, I'd add cheese and jalapenos and additional spices to the cornbread mix, and if using 9X13, double the cornbread top, or I don't know, omit it altogether and use crushed tortilla chips instead, and maybe add a layer of refried beans ... OK, now we're getting into "new recipe" territory.

This was very good, made it exactly as written. Served the olives on the side so everyone could get as much or little as they wanted. Also put out salsa and sour cream for those who wanted it. It was a big hit! A family of 5, and no leftovers!

Wow lots of good reviews. A couple of  things I do to make it yummy for us. I use the recipe for "Taco Seasoning I" by Bill Echols that is on this site as the taco seasoning. Also as I'm on a wheat free diet, once everything (except the muffin mix)is in the casserole I carefully sprinkle a cup of plain old cornmeal on top then use a spoon to softly direct a cup of water over that. It puffs up and make a nice crust. Add grated cheese the last 10 minutes or so. Delicious!!!

Have made this for years, but we've always called it Tamale pie...taste the same and the only thing different was, we added diced green chilies and cumin, and either fresh of frozen corn. Serve it with extra cheese on top and it's a big hit at home, potlucks or guests. We double the recipe of course for 9. =)

Admittedly I did make a few changes so I'm hesitant about how to rate this but my family agrees it's an average of 2.5 stars.  I used some salsa and some canned tomatoes for the meat mixture which did add some flavor.  I also used my own cornbread recipe (from this site), but it proved to be too much cornbread.  Overall this wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It's the sort of dish everyone ate without complaining but chances are the left overs will probably go to waste.

This was surprisingly awesome!!! I did tweak a few things though. I made a jalapeno cheddar corn bread for the top, and I mixed up a batch of Alton Brown's taco potion #19 instead of a seasoning packet.

This was pretty good! Did just as recipe said but added green chilies to the ground beef and added peas. Also didn't have taco seasoning so I used chili seasoning, it turned out yummy! I wanted to put the cheese on then add the cornbread but my husband said to put it on top, well it baked into the cornbread and lost the cheesy goodness, so next time I would defiantly put the cheese on at the end of baking!

Really enjoyed this one. I had leftover taco seasoned ground beef in the freezer that I used. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies, can of corn, a can of drained and rinsed black beans, and also some shredded zucchini just to add extra veg factor. I used a 4 cheese Mexi cheese blend and omitted the olives for the kiddos. This was a very good all in one meal. Thanks!

LOVED this.  I used beef cubes instead of ground beef, fresh garlic, and black beans for some fiber and protein.  It was easy and delicious.  We added some of the cheese into the mix and served with balance of cheese and sour cream.  YUM!

I'd make this again, but you definitely need to go with corn bread mix for the top layer and add something with a kick to punch it up a little.

Sorry but for me and my wife, this is a case of "it looks good on paper." While the corn bread was good on its own and the filling was good on its own, the sweetness of the corn bread just didn't mesh in tandem. We ate the filling with some tortilla chips but basically had to chuck the dish

So tasty!  Like others, ,I substituted a can of Rotel for the tomatoes, and rather than hot water, I'd recommend a can of tomato sauce.  Definitely double the corn muffin mix as other reviewers have suggested.  My kids loved it, and husband and I ate it with sour cream and salsa on top. Definitely making again. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

Came across a recipe like this years ago.  It's excellent served with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream...
Couldn't find the recipe this past week.  Mixed 2 lbs hamburger, lg. can of tomato sauce, taco seasoning, and topped it off with 2 pkg of prepared corn muffin mix, and shredded cheese.  Served with salsa, diced tomatoes and sour cream.  Yumm!

I gave it a 5 but the hubby only gave it a 3...but what does he know? I didn't have canned corn, so I substituted frozen corn added it to the meat while it was simmering also added drained black beans! We don't like olives on mexican food, so we garnished with pickled jalapeños and sour cream! Awesome! Will definitely make again!

Doubled the amount of cornbread, and also the cheese.  Used the second cup of cheese to cover the Mexicorn I used (instead of regular corn), then put cornbread mix on top. Halved the water.
Only put olives on half of the casserole, because I knew some guests wouldn't like olives while others love olives.
Was so easy to make, and so tasty. Served with sour cream. Will definitely make again.

Great taste!  I added green peppers, black beans and a small can of diced chilies. It also needed a little extra chili powder and cumin.

I've made this twice now and both times the cornbread layer is not cooked through.  The top is crusty but underneath the cornbread batter remains uncooked.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong since I'm following the directions exactly.  ??

So delicious! I listened to the other reviews and doubled up on the cornbread and it came out perfectly. Next time I think I'll just one box of corn bread and cut the rest of the ingredients in half because there are only two of us, we had a good amount left over.

So very YUMMY!! I made a coupe of changes to this recipe I used mexican corn bread mix with jalipenos to add more flavor. (don't worry the cornbread is mild and will not make the dish too spicy). I also added fresh cilantro as a topper melted in with the cheese. I will HAVE to make this again!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a great idea, but needs some adjustments.  I used ground turkey to cut down on fat, added 2 cans of kidney beans, an extra package of taco seasoning, and doubled the amount of cornbread topping.  Mine needed 5 minutes more baking time than the recipe called for.  Soooo delicious, filling, and easy!!

My mom always made this for us growing up (but was called "railroad pie" for some odd reason)  I still make it and it's one of my hubby's favorite dishes.  Only change I make is to use a Mexican cornbread mixture for the topping, really kicks it up a notch!

Marvelous!  I tweaked a little...I love "spicy" Mexican, so I followed a previous suggestion about using Rotel tomatoes.  I used one 10oz can Original and one 10 oz can Hot Rotel.  I added a can of Black beans (again, I think this was a previous reviewer suggestion) and omitted the 3/4 cup water.    In the corn muffin mix (used two and I'm glad!) I added a can of creamed corn.  I also baked for 30 - 35 minutes.    I will make this again...soon!  Use the deepest 9X13 pan you have.  I didn't add all the meat mixture and put foil under the pan so I didn't have to worry about run over.  Delish!!!!!!

Wonderful!  The family ate it right up!  I did use two boxes of corn muffin mix and it was "needed"... one would not be enough.  But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Less work than doing up all the fixings for tacos, but all the taste, and the volume of food stretched further than just tacos would have.  I will make this again!

I layered black beans (can rinsed and drained) and the cheese on top of the corn before the corn muffin.  I only used 1 box of corn muffin mix, but 2 are definitely needed for full coverage (if I had another box at home I would have mixed it up--instead I just had corn muffin "blobs" covering the cheese).  I also dumped the whole can of tomatoes in (juice and all) and think I should have used less than 3/4 cup water with doing that, since it took forever to evaporate, and I still had some runny casserole in the end.  Tasted great, though!

This recipe is a keeper, I will be making it again and again.  The only chages I made was I added a can of black beans to the ground beef and let them cook for a little while and I would definately use 2 boxes of cornbread mix.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

This is a great idea. I added a few things to this recipe to make it my own. I used onion soup mix instead of an onion, added kidney beans, Salsa instead of diced tomatoes. Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! Most def use two boxes of corn bread mix. I followed the advice of another user and put a thin layer of the batter on the bottom of the pan before putting in the meat and veggies. I also added black beans to the mix because we like them so much. And to add more flavor I used cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies. It was excellent with sour cream. I'll certainly be making this again.

I used a little more than a pound of ground turkey and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and cilantro.  Then added undrained petite diced tomatoes WITH jalepenos and taco seasoning, I did not add any water, but did add probably, 1/2 cup of medium salsa.  After it boiled off a little I added the olives and corn and cooked a little longer.  I only had 1 box of corn bread mix and after reading reviews was leary about baking in a 9x13 so I poured it all into a deep 8x8 pyrex and spread the corn bread mix on top.  It took about 25 minutes in the oven.  DELICIOUS!!!  I didn't even need cheese, but some liked a little sprinkle on top.  I have also cooked just the ground meat mixture and served over rice and in soft/hard taco shells.  This recipe is so easy and, again, tastes great!

Very yummy! I took this dish to a potluck party and it was a hit...the recipe was very much requested.  I used extra lean ground beef and added kidney beans, corn, mild green chilies, and salsa.  I used a Mexican blend of cheese instead of the Cheddar and layered over the meat then topped it with the corn and the corn bread mixture. In addition to the black olives I added light sour cream, cilantro, green onions, and chopped fresh tomatoes to top it. Left out the cheese.

I thought this was great.  My husband did not. I used about 2 lbs. of beef and added a can of green chilis at the same time I added the tomotoes.  I used one can of corn (per recipe) and added about a cup of frozen corn...to get the effect of thicker corn layer without adding so much sweetness the canned corn provides.  I also add about 1 C. of Cheddar on top of the corn.  Topped with 2 boxes of corn bread...definitely needed both boxes.  A little too spicy for my kids...will try a mild taco packet next time and skip the green chilis to make it more kid friendly.

I made this dish and took a few tips from others.  Added black beans on top of the meat mixture, a layer of cheese over the corn. I used 2 boxes of cornbread mix. 1 I put as a bottom layer and the second I put on the top.  I was not impressed with this at all.  The meat was flavorless, might try a different seasoning packet.  I will give this one a try but stick to the recipe as written so I can give it a fair rating.

Yum! Loved this. I made it in the 9x13 and doubled the cornbread as reviews suggested. Also put 1 1/2 cups cheese on top of meat/corn layers. Next time I may put 2 cans of corn and maybe go with 2 lbs of ground beef. Don't feel like it really needed the black olives.

This is a really easy, great-tasting, all-in-one meal. I added a can of chiles to the cornbread, mixed frozen corn in with the meat mixture, added some hot sauce, and added a thin layer of cheese before the last 5 minutes of cooking. Very tasty!

The whole family loved this! I didn't use any tomatoes, mostly because I didn't have them. Also, instead of boxed cornbread mix, I made a mix from scratch. It was wonderful and we will make it again. Although, I have to say, I did not enjoy it as a leftover...=).

Very good!  One box of cornbread was definitely not enough for the 9x13. (I should have read the reviews more thoroughly before making it) Double the mix or at least use the 10.5 oz mix.  My family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit in my house. The flavors went very well together and it was very easy to prepare. I did however add the cheese to the top of the hamburger before the corn meal. This is definitely a keeper!

This was such a hit.  I added alot of the extra's others had suggested and I used Jalepeno cheese.  I used beans and the same amount of meat so I doubled the cornbread.  My family ate the entire pan.  New favorite!!!!

This was sooo good. The only suggestion I have is to get two boxes of muffin mix. Mine didn't cover the whole top, and also cut down on the water from 3/4 to 1/2 cup. It was a little more watery than I would have prefered. But it was great flavor and I think it will freeze well.

This tastes great out of the oven and also as leftovers. 

It also doubles very well. If you make it as is, then I would use a 9x9 or 8x8 pan. 9x13 works well for doubling it- and you'll have great leftovers for very little extra work. 

will definitely make this again. 

also add shredded cheese to the top during the last 10 mins of baking for extra yumminess.

I liked this and thought the combination of different flavors was very unique.  I wish I had added more spice however, mine was slightly bland, but still very yummy.

My family absolutely devoured this.  I personally would give it 4 1/2 stars, but my Mom asked for the recipe.  I used more beef than called for, and cooked it thoroughly.  I, like other reviewers, included the corn in Jiffy corn muffin mix, and let it settle for 5 minutes before pouring it into the main dish.  Sprinkled with a handful of Montery Jack cheese.  The hotness of the dish depends on your taco seasoning.  The sweetness of the corn muffin mix was very complimentary to the beef.  Will make again- it was soo easy, and so good.

This is one of those recipes that you just have to try friends.  There are many ways to tweek this recipe to taste but this recipe does well.  I sometimes replace the meat with black beans. Don't forget a healthy spoonfull of sour cream on top. MMMMM you will have your warm mouth dancing and your belly to.

This was very good!  But I'll use a smaller pan, or double the recipe, as it was a bit thin.  However, it was very tasty!  It made good leftovers, too!  Will make it again.

I LOVE this. The only change I made was I mixed the corn into the cornbread mix. The last five minutes of baking time I sprinkled on the cheese and olives.

Using several of the suggestions from others to spice it up, I'm rating this 4 because otherwise it wouldn't have been as good. ONE SKILLET MEAL:  I also used a 10" round iron skillet & did EVERYTHING  in it. Added a bit of oil 1st then did everything else in it! I only added 2 T. water. I've never added photos but I'm going to try.

This was easy enough to do but lacked a little flavor. Maybe next time I'll use a different taco seasoning ( Better ). May also add green chilies  and not cut the onions quite so fine-felt the dish needed a bit more substance/ texture. Otherwise. it was quite tasty and satisfying. The cornbread crust was  a marvel.

This has been a go to recipe for my family for years. It's a really filling inexpensive meal and I like the versatility of it. We've tried it with different beans (black, red, pinto-canned or cooked from dried) and different types of tomatos (canned plain, or with all sorts of seasonings, or fresh). We usually use 2 boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, but we've also used others and have made a mix from cornmeal. We usually add the corn (canned or frozen!) to the cornbread mixture. Tonight, we were out of taco seasoning, so we made up a batch of Taco Seasoning I and added some of it to the meat. Not buying that packaged seasoning again! Yumm!! Thank you Allrecipes!

This is amazing! We made it a little different. We added a can of mixed veggies after the diced tomatoes (we used hot rotel) and put homemade mashed potatoes on the bottom (we add cream cheese to our potatoes) then the meat mixture & jiffy on top (two boxes for a 13x9 pan) one box isn’t enough as others said. But it’s a hit! Soooooooooo delicious! Making this again!

Added beans. Did not increase the muffin mix, but used 9in pie plate instead and it was perfect ratio. Didn't have any corn, that would have been yummy, though. Added sharp cheddar under the muffin topping. It was so good! I used taco sauce and a little bit of beer in place of the water. Fantastic

Very tasty! I did tweak a few things:
1) I only had 1lb of ground beef, not 1.5lbs. To make up the difference, I used a can of black beans. 
2) My favorite taco seasoning comes from Trader Joe's, and if you use the whole packet, it is VERY spicy and flavorful. Because of the heat and flavor, I opted to omit the garlic powder and black pepper.
3) When making corn bread I don't use the boxed Jiffy mix. Instead, I made the corn bread from scratch using the recipe from the Fannie Farmer Cookbook. I found 1 normal batch was sufficient for us (I see some people doubling the amount of corn bread).
Overall this was a very easy recipe to make and I plan on adding this to my rotation of meals.

Easy to make and very tasty (topped with olives, cheese, sour cream, and served with Cholupa sauce). I think recipe as is would be better in 8x8 or 9 pan. Too thin for 9x13. Double everything for larger fish.

Since it was just for my husband and me, I cut the recipe in half & used a 11 x 7 dish.  It was a little bit thin but still worked well!  I used all of the cornbread mixture for the top.  We served it with sour cream also.  This is a yummy dish and tasty even the next day.  I will definitely make it again!

This is good but I recommend mixing the cheese in with the corn bread batter and also adding jalepenos to the batter before putting it on the mexican shepherd's pie and baking.

My neighbor really liked this. I added rinsed black beans to the meat mixture and put my cheese on the casserole before adding the cornbread mixture. This makes a lot, but it reheats well. I will make this again as it is simple, inexpensive, and tasty!

Very good recipe.  Easy to make.  I made some minor modifications and turned out great.  Instead of salt/pepper, I used 1/2 tsp of original camp mix.  Instead of garlic powder, I used 4 cloves minced garlic (1/2 tsp x 4).  Instead of can of regular diced tomatoes, use Rotel fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Instead of whole kernel corn used can of mexicorn.  In a 9x13 dish, the layer of corn and the layer of corn bread muffin mix didn't seem to be quite enough.  I would add a few more ounces to each layer.  Excellent recipe.

I am one who takes a recipe and make it my own. I never follow exactly without putting my twist on it. This is how I tweaked it. I added 1 jar of salsa to the meat mixture omitting the water. I also spread 2 cans of refried beans on top of the layer of corn. I then added a layer of Mexican blend cheese on top of the beans. I also topped with 3 boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix. That being said this is a great recipe. Perfect for those on a budget and very filling, tastes great as well.

I added a can of refried beans to the mix.  I thought the taco part was very good, but I did not care for the cornbread on top. Granted, I did not use a wonderful mix, but I still think it was better without the topping.

Followed this recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully! I've made this several times now and everyone that has tried this has loved it. My 21 month old and 3 year old even enjoy this, and they can be picky eaters!

Overall, I liked this.  It's easy and kid friendly.  Few things I would change:   1) for this size pan, it's not enough meat filling -- I would either use a smaller pan so the meat is deeper, or increase the meat mixture.  2) I don't care for boxed cornbread mix but love my own recipe, so I used that.  My recipe makes a 9x9 pan size, so I assumed that if it was spread out to 9x13 it wouldn't be as thick, but I felt the proportion of cornbread to meat was not right.   Not sure how much a boxed cornbread mix makes but if it makes a 9x9 pans worth -- that might be too much  cornbread  for the amount of beef filling as well.  3) I mixed in the cheese into the meat mixture -- it works for tacos no reason why it couldn't work here too.

Made it tonight. Added fresh garlic and green peppers with the onion and hamburger. I added black beans with the tomatoes. Used creamed corn instead of kernel corn. Also used some adobo seasoning and paprika along with other seasonings. Turned out great. Definitely will make it again.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was really good! I did substitute ground turkey for the beef and doubled the amount. Also put in two packets of the taco seasoning and added shredded cheese on top of the corn. It baked up perfectly. Quick and easy weeknight dinner with standard ingredients. Will definitely make this again.

made this for D/N on Feb 8/16...had no taco seasoning, so sprinkled cayenne, chili p, cumin, oregano, pepper.  Mixed some corn, tomatoes and black beans in it.  Added a layer of cheese, then a layer of cornbread mixture.  Didn't think there was much flavour.  Made it with cornbread recipe....Grandma's cornbread.

Very good and easy to make. I find that even just a pound of meat works just as well while following the rest of the recipe to a tee. The flavor seems to be stronger this way as the seasoning packets usually call for 1 pound of beef.

This was a hit at my home! I added corn and black beans before topping off with the muffin mix. Instead of water, I used chicken broth (will buy and try Beef Broth next time) instead of water. I used a little bit of the muffin mix to coat the bottom of the pan and instead of ground beef I over seasoned ground turkey and it turned out wonderful! 25 Minutes in the over vs 20 to let the mix cook to a light golden brown. I garnished with sour cream, green onion, and a side of jalepenos.

The kids really liked this. I added olives to the meat mixture rather than using them as a garnish, and also made with ground turkey rather than beef. The cornbread was tough to spread over the top because the mixture it was spread over was pretty loose and the pan was large. I have another recipe that uses a package of cornbread on a much smaller pan and over a creamier mixture so it is easier.

Super! Used a can of tomatoes with green chiles, instead of regular tomatoes, & hot sauce (salsa), instead of water. Can definitely season it to your own tastes. Added can of black beans, rinsed & drained, on top of meat & used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix.

As my son put it...DANG!  This was an instant hit at my house.  My only changes were that I added about 1/2 cup of chopped green pepper (left over from another recipe so I just tossed them in) and used Cajun Cornbread Mix topping.  Yummy!!!

I made so many changes that I don't want to list them, but the "jist" of my review is that this recipe is so versatile you can play with it all you want and it's still going to be very good. Definitely try it - we're going to have it again and again.

I made this vegetarian. I was not expecting to like this so much. It seemed like a lot of canned food, but it also seemed super easy, which it was. I did not use beef or cheese. I didn't have any beef and I had already snacked on cheese that day, so I didn't want anymore. I used canned kidney beans in place of the ground beef. I didn't miss the cheese at all even though I'm a big cheese lover. I mixed the canned kidney beans, canned corn, canned diced tomatoes, and a large can of whole olives with the taco seasoning and used this as the base. Then I put a layer of raw chopped onion on top of the mix. I didn't pre-cook any part of it because I didn't need to blend the flavors into any meat. I also put a layer of very thinly sliced radishes, four radishes total. I really only did this because I had four radishes and no plans for them. I then put the cornbread mix on top of that. When the dish had cooked for about 5 minutes, I sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro on top of it to make it look pretty. The only thing I would do different if I make it again is to use a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of plain diced tomatoes. It was kind of bland.

Edit: I had to lower this rating from 4 to 3 stars because I was giving it an "I like it" with a shrug, but what I really meant was it was OK.

Delicious & easy!  I used 1 pound of ground turkey and omitted the tomatoes (hubby can't have them).  I added some cooked carrots instead for a pop of color.  I used frozen corn without pre-cooking it.  I added the cheese on top of the cornbread before baking so that it would melt in.  My kids loved it -- will definitely make again!

We just didn't care for this. The bottom meat layer was somewhat bland, and the cornbread layer was too sweet to mesh with the meat, in our opinions. I ended up scraping off most of the cornbread and using the meat/corn mixture in flour tortillas, along with some black beans, as a burrito filling, just to salvage some of my ingredients.

Like Marcy in 2007, i don't like my food touching on my plate either, but this taco shepherd's pie was an exception after i made it a second time. First time, followed recipe to the "T" but we wanted more spice so used a can of Rotel second time around and that pushed it to a 5 star; as is, it's really good, but the Rotel sealed it. Thanks, MICHARD!

I tweaked it a bit. I browned the ground turkey with onions and minced garlic, added diced tomato and green chiles, tossed in a can of cuban sytle black beans (drained) and didn't add any water when I added the taco seasoning. I topped it with corn, 2 cups of cheddar (we love cheese), and added creamed corn to the corn bread topping (used two corn muffin mixes with 2 eggs and 1/2 c milk). It was super yummy.  I will be making it again and again.

great recipe - use a smaller dish or add more corn bread - it does not spread over the entire 9x13 dish.

Very tasty and a keeper for sure. I used ground beef and spicy sausages (casings removed) that I crumbled instead of just ground beef. I added a nice layer of refried beans on top of the meat, before the corn, highly recommended, gives it a nice twist.

Very delicious!!  A little spicy since we make our own taco seasoning.  We also used homemade cornbread since we don't care for Jiffy mix.  Thanks very much!

We loved this. I was looking for a recipe for traditional shepherds pie, when I realized I did not have the correct ingredients, must have been a sign to try this. We lolved it , much more than we would have liked traditional sheperds pei!! So glad I found this!!!

This was so delicious! I would definitely use 2 boxes of corn muffin mix next time, but it was still amazing.  We also added sour cream on top. Huge hit in our house!

The food tasted delicious, but the corn muffin mix wouldn't cover the entire dish no matter how hard I tried.  Other than that it was wonderful.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  This is quick,easy and has nice flavor. The only change I made was to put some of the cheese into the corn muffin mix before I poured it over the meat mixture.  All in all, a very good recipe.

This was so easy and my roomates 2 boys loved it (ages 12 and 17).  I used 1 pound of beef and half an onion.  Also I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies which was smaller then 14.5 ounces cause that is all I had so I did use the 3/4 cup hot water.  I only used 1 box of Jiffy muffin mix which covered most of the 2 qt casserole dish I used and I felt it was enough.  I added the cheese to the beef mixture along with mixing the corn in with it.  I also added some cheese to the corn muffin mix.  I didn't add the olives either cause I do not like them.  Will definately make again!!

An easy and very tasty dish. The only thing I added was a can of pinto beans, otherwise it was great as is. Kids thought it was awesome. This dish will become a regular item in the winter.

This recipe is easy to make - but as far as tastes go, it is nothing that grand.  It is not bad tasting by any means, but not outstanding either - just ok.  I have tried it a couple times, and like it better with a few modifications - but still even with the modifications, its still just ok (but better than as written).  I add fresh sauteed garlic, black beans, and a can of green chiles.  I also mix in the corn instead of layering it.  I add cheese, and cream corn to the cornbread as well.

I used the basic recipe but with some alterations. I used bite size pieces of steak, and I added a can of black beans and a diced fresh jalapeno pepper. I put a crust of crushed taco shells left over from the other night on the bottom. Once I browned the meat with the onion, I threw the tomatoes, water, seasonings, corn, etc all in the skillet and simmered for around 5 minutes. I used 2 boxed cornbread mix as the topping and baked. Topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream and the family ate it up! Thanks for the great idea!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe the way it was.  My family loved it.  The second time I made it, I did change a few things (I usually don't make changes if I am rating a recipe since I feel a recipe should be rated for what it is)  This time I used Mexican Style diced tomatoes, spicy taco seasoning mix, and a sweet cornbread mix for the top.  I preferred this way since the sweet cornbread accented the spicy beef mixture perfectly.  Still an excellent recipe the way it is posted as well.

This was very good. I made just a few changes based on other reviews. I add Rotel tomatoes instead of dices, this added some heat, and I add the cheddar cheese before the corn muffin mix so that it could melt in with the other ingredients. This was a good quick recipe.

This was very good and very flavorful.  I almost followed the recipe.  I added a can of seasoned pinto beans and I added a little cheese to the meat mixture. I also used 2 boxes of the corn muffin mix.  The corn bread part is where this recipe needs so tweeking, for my family. We aren't used to eating sweet cornbread so this was strange for us.  Next time I'm going to make my own cornbread. Also, I used a 13x9 pan and I think 2 boxes was too much.  One box might be too little, I don't know.  We had to scoop the filling out from under the cornbread. We had a lot (of cornbread) left over.

My 2-year old daughter loved this! I did add some stuff to make it more like the tamale pie I remembered as a kid. I added a drained can of kidney beans, and I added an extra cornbread mix because I thought the beans might have beefed it up enough for me to need more cornbread. I thought it was too much cornbread in the end, but my husband said he liked it that way. I also used mexicorn.

This was good but not over the top like I thought it would be.... I used a lb of ground turkey that I cooked with onion and green pepper and two cloves of garlic. After I drained the meat I added a can of undrained diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of drained corn along with the taco seasoning and just a little bit of water. Once that cooked a little while I dumbed it in a greased casserole dish and topped it with one box of cornbread mix. I baked it for about 20 minutes then added cheese to the top and baked another 5 minutes. It was really good topped with red hot. Will make again when I need a quick and easy dinner. Thanks!!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I made it as directed other than the fact that I found I didn't really have enough jiffy mix to cover a 9x13 pan so I made 2 boxes. I also used to cans of corn and this was a meal in it's self. No other sides were needed. I sprinkled a little cheese on the top during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. It turned out great!

I really liked this recipe and my S/O loved it.  I was out of hamburger, so used ground turkey.  I also added two chopped jalapenos when browning the meat.  It was delicious.

I love chili on cornbread, which is what this recipe reminds me of, only reversed.  The cornbread bakes perfectly.  I have also tried this with ground turkey, and with black beans (drained) instead of corn - both good.

I used the Restaurant Style Taco Meat Seasoning recipe instead of the package, and added probably 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper as well.  Added a can of chili beans.  I put half the meat mixture in the pan, then put a layer of shredded cheese, then added the rest of the meat.  I made a recipe for cornbread that called for 1 cup of cornmeal and 1 of flour, I think next time I will do 1.5x of that recipe.  This recipe also reheats very well.

This was delicious. I do add a can of kidney beans to the mixture and then I add corn to the cornbread. Husband loves it.

This was a simple and delicious recipe. I added in black beans and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I did not add any additional water, but it was a bit liquidy anyway.

Goodness, this is tasty!  I used 1 lb ground chicken and a can of ranch style beans, frozen corn.  Used a pastry bag to pipe the corn bread batter out evenly and it "grew together" during baking for the most part.  Very easy and yummy!

Absolutely yummy!  Extremely easy and versatile.  My changes, additions and deletions are almost too few to mention, except I added kidney beans to the meat, and used two boxes of corn bread mix to which I added the corn.  (Good decisions on my part!) My only concern was that a 4"X4" section of the corn bread did not appear to be done. (weird) However, I habitually let casserole-type dishes sit for about 10 minutes before digging in.  Amazingly, that undone section of the cornbread was fine after that.  This one, I'm keepin'.

Great recipe! I was searching for something different when I ran across this recipe. I followed the review below, and it turned out great. I also added some sliced jalapenos to the meat mixture because we enjoy a lot of spice. I also did not have the jiffy cornbread mix, so I used my homemade cornbread recipe. We love this dish and definately will be using it again! Thanks a lot!

This was such a fun dish, and very easy to make.  I give it 4 stars for 2 reasons: first, I followed many reviewer's advice and used 2 packages of jiffy corn mix, which covered the meat perfectly.  However, no one had taken into account that a thicker batter will take longer to bake.  I took my dish out at 20 minutes on the nose, and the top looked perfect - brown and lovely!  But when I served it, the cornbread top wasn't baked all the way through.  Definitely need to use the toothpick test!  Also, the starchy element of the cornbread would certainly tame down a spicy dish, but the meat as prepared is nowhere NEAR spicy (and I had even added a bit of chili powder!).  Next time I will definitely use a teaspoon or 2 of chili powder for a more intense flavor.  All in all, with these minor improvements, I can only imagine how great this will turn out next time.

I actually made this a few weeks ago and my husband keeps asking when are we having it again.  I followed the recipe as written and it was totally awsome. Guess I'd better get the ingredients together and make it for dinner this week.

If you are on a budget, then this is the recipe to make.  No one ingredient cost more than $3.00, and it will probably feed me for most of the week.  I made a few little changes.  I used medium salsa instead of tomatoes, I used double cornbread, and I mixed corn and cheese into the batter.  It turned out great, but the batter needed a bit longer to cook due to my additions.

This is really good!  I added cheese underneath the cornbread mixture and actually added some cheese into the cornbread since we really like it.  Regardless, this is a great recipe that my husband and I both love!

I am forever trying to find recipes that are an unusual twist on some standard/classic recipes so this one piqued my interest. I made it to recipe and everyone really liked it. I liked it but thought it was quite salty so not sure how I will remedy but I will figure it out. Maybe, I will create my own taco seasoning instead of using a recipe from allrecipes.com.

Either way, I will make this again. The saltiness may be a small negative but the tastiness of the recipe would override that.

this is an awesome recipe!  definitely company worthy.  must be done in a 9x13 or the cornbread top will not cook.  first time i tried it in a deep dish pie pan so it would look a little less rustic and the thing just would NOT cook.  9X13 pan never fails though.  excellent taste, excellent idea!

This was yummy!  I doubled the corn bread mix but maybe next time will stick with the one box.  We love cornbread but even after 30 minutes it wasn't cooked all the way thru.  I used meat, onions, rotele, a bit of leftover salsa, taco seasoning and corn all mixed together with a layer of cheese on top...then the corn bread mix with olives stirred in.  Very filling and tasty!  :-)

Great dish !!!!  I added a can of black beans and it was all gone.  Next time i will cut the water in half though as it took a while to boil down.  Don't leave out the olives - a great addition!

My husband would eat it every night.  He likes it best when 2 packets of sweet corn bread mix it used.  I add red kidney beans in it tonight so we will see if that adds to it.  I also used rotel instead of diced tomatoes.

I liked the other reviewer's suggestion of adding beans so I added 2 cups cooked Trader Joe's 17 bean mix to the recipe. Italian style diced tomatoes work well in this dish, too.

Very good and very easy!! I added 1 1/2 tsps. of sugar to the corn mix to make it a bit sweeter, like cornbread.  My husband loved it!!  I'll probably try putting another half box of corn mix next time.  Great with sour cream and some salad.  Thank you!!!

I also added black beans to the mix with tomatos and meat. And always enjoy adding a T of jalepeno juice to zip it up.

This was good. And so easy. I fixed it last week and my family really liked it. We topped ours as we served it with sour cream and salsa. I think next time I'll cahnge it up just a little and not pur but half the cornbread mixture on top and maybe add some refireds beans.

Pretty good and very easy.  If I make this again I will try adding some black beans to the corn and maybe chopped bell peppers to the meat, I also won't omit the cheese and olives (it did say optional:).  Thanks for the interesting recipe!

This is basically a tamale pie. The kids loved this and insisted I give it a 5 star rating. I think it could use a little more kick even though I added some Chipotle Tobasco. I added a can of pinto beans. Next time I think I will put the cheese inside and add some chopped red pepper and a can of green chilies. I didn't have the cornbread mix so I used my own cornbread recipe.

I give this one a HUGE thumbs up.  I'm a social worker, and I help the clients where I work make lunch once per week for all the clients in our partial hospital program.  I look for recipes that are straight forward, easy to understand, and easy to make many portions of (we cook for about 40 people total).  This one TOTALLY fits the bill!  It's easy to make, everyone here loves it, and it fits into my tight non-profit budget!  I haven't tried making it at home yet - but I can't wait!

Our family loved this.  Next time I will use 2 lbs. of meat since I doubled the corn mix like suggested.  Also I will use a generous layer of cheese before before I put the corn muffin mix ontop.

Yum. I added chili beans. It was so good like a chili cornbread casserole. Next time, I think I would add another box of cornbread mix.

Definitely a keeper.  Per other reviews, I used two boxes of corn muffin mix and diced tomatoes with chilis, and also added some kidney beans. Next time I think I will also throw in some salsa for a little more kick, but overall it was easy and delicious.

Rachel Ray makes something very similar, called Meat-zza Pizza, although she uses the cornbread on the bottom (like a pizza crust), and then she tops it with ground beef, cheese and and lots of other Mexican-flavored toppings and spices. Both are super yummy!

This recipe is much easier to execute, but the 30 Minutes Meals recipe is worth checking out, too.

This is a really easy and tasty meal to make. I did double the cornbread and put the cheese on top of the layer of corn. I thought it was pretty good and will make it agian. The reason I did not give it a five because it isn't something I could make all the time! It had a great flavor and texture but, the combination isn't something I could eat often. Great recipe just different. :)

Everyone really liked this and asked for more.  My two year old cleaned her plate!  The only thing that I changed was that I only used 1/2 of an onion and I didn't add the water because there was enough liquid from the diced tomatoes.  This was yummy!

Loved it! I omitted the water too, 1 1/2 times the cornbread mix, shredded cheese before the layer of cornbread mix, and definitely better with creamed corn too (1 1/2 14-oz. cans), since it adds a great layer of "sweet" too!

I didn't love this; the flavor just didn't do it for me. I don't think I liked the combination of the sweet cornbread with the salty/spicy meat. However, my boyfriend ate it up. I did use Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes Also, ittook about 45 minutes for the dough to turn into bread. I turned the oven down to 350 for the last 10 minutes because the top was getting a little brown. I used frozen corn and just simmered it with the meat mixture while I was preparing the dough. I also topped my cornbread with black olive slices before baking, which looked really pretty when it came out of the oven. Thanks :)

This recipe was so very cool!  I might start toppig other casserole dishes with cornbread!  The only reason this isn't a 5 star rating...is because the amounts seemed a little off...I would probably use 2 boxes of cornbread mix for the topping....and less corn than called for.

I was looking for something different, and this fit the bill!  I took other readers' advice, and cut the water down to just under 1/2 cup, and used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix.  It was a big hit, and I will make it again and again!

This was great!!! I used two lbs of beef, two cans of tomatoes, added a half can of chiles (will use more next time) and two packets of taco seasoning. And baked in a 9x13. I will DEFINITELY make this again and again and again!

I tried this recipe out of pure curiosity and now I pretty much make it once a week as the household loves it. The only change I've made is to add a dash of cayenne red pepper to pick up the spice just before adding the tomatoes and I also use diced tomatoes with green peppers.

This is the first recipe I tried and it was spectacular. My husband who is 100% Irish and loves Mexican food couldn't believe how good it was. I did spice it up a bit by using Jalapeno diced tomatoes and sliced Jalapeno's on top of the corn I also served it with Spanish rice and sour cream.

This was yummy. I took other people's advice and added the mexican corn to the cornbread mixture (two boxes of jiffy) before covering the meat mixture. I also put the olives and  cheese layer under the cornbread. YUMMY

Great recipe!!!  I did not double up on the corn bread as did many other reviews and I thought it was just enough.  I did add 1 diced green bell pepper, and used fresh diced tomatos instead of canned.  I also added a layer of cheese before adding the cornbread mixture!  My husband raved about it, this will definately become a regular at our house!

I made this and included taco shells on the side.  The only problem I had was that I should have made more meat (I made it three servings) because the balance of the corn muffin and the meat is good in the right proportion.  Would definitely make again.  Oh, and I used a blend of mexican cheese.

If you love Shepherd's pie this is a great spin off!  Some nice flavour with a spicy taco seasoning and a great mexican dish.

My husbands favorite is shepards pie so I had to try this!  I added pinto beans to the meat because I was short. There is more room in the dish if you want to add another bean...  The cornbread doesn't rise too much.  I loved the double corn effect.  Overall, it tastes like chili and it ensures you don't forget the cornbread!!  Delicious!

I've read the reviews and it seems we're the only ones who didn't like the sweetness of the cornbread.  I think this is a great idea for a recipe and there are so many possible add-ins.  We added diced, fresh jalapeno and a thin layer of shredded co-jack under the cornbread as well as on top when it came out of the oven.  Next time I will try a can of black beans with the meat to bulk up the protein and fiber.  Thank you for the idea, Michard!

This recipe was ok.  It was kinda bland and needed something else.  This is a good base recipe though.

This was a yummy and easy dinner. My 9 year old and 18 month old loved it. I added a small can of mild green chilies to it, but other then that I didn't change a thing.
Thanks!

I absolutely loved this recipe and it was so easy to make. I did use a can of diced tomatoes & chiles instead of plain tomatoes and it was so much better. The mix of spicy & sweet is great! This one is definitely a keeper!

My family loved this recipie!  The only thing that I changed was crunching up tortilia chips to use as the base and mixed a package of mexi blend cheese to the mixture.  Very good and easy.

A great, reasonably quick and easy family dinner.  It is nice because meat, vegetable and bread/starch are included in the one dish.  The cornbread layer kept the meat moist.

I must admit I was a little wary of this as I was assembling it. The only problem was the cornbread didn't cover it completely. But it was very tasty and my husband actually ate three helpings!

I also put the can of corn (I used fiesta corn with peppers) into the cornbread mix.  Turned out great! My husband loved it - he said the the slightly sweet cornbread was a great combination with the spicy meat mixture.  Will make this again.

This recipe is quick, easy and filling. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used diced tomatoes with green chilis. I hot taco seasoning to give it a little kick and also added black beans in with the corn. My husband and I both agree it's a keeper.

first off, i must admit i changed the ingredients a bit.  instead of using ground beef i used one can of black beans and a bowl of leftover taco meat.  overall it is a good recipe for using up leftovers from taco night, but i would not decide to make it just because.  my boyfriend said it tasted "suspicously like beans and cornbread".
