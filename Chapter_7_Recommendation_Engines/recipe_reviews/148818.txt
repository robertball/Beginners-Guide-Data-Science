This is a great beginner recipe, BUT...
Instead of using GARLIC SALT, use fresh garlic. There is enough salt in the shrimp itself. If you need more salt, then add a few twists of the sea salt grinder -to taste (TT).  Also, add a hand full of fresh chopped cilantro and skip the cumin (cumin is over used in a lot of mexican dishes). Cilantro will give a great flavor to the dish and merries well with the lime and tequila. As far as adding more heat...GO FOR IT!!!
I would use fresh serreno or habanera peppers for the connoisseur of hot, but if you like mild heat use the old standards -jalape√±o or cayenne (fresh). If using that powdered cayenne- sprinkle on after grilling as a garnish. Remember, a recipe is only a guide. You can add and subtract from it as much as you want, BUT the intended flavors will change so ...remember to TASTE IT before marinating! Always remember...FRESH is the key ingredient to any marinade!
One last tid bit... yes it is true that the acid will cook meat and fish if left for a period of time (especially fish), but shellfish can stand a little longer. At the most, 1 hour will suffice for this recipe. Any longer, the shrimp will start to take on an unpleasant bitter taste - dont forget to remove any seeds from the lime as this will hasten the bitterness.

Hey 99burners... You over cooked the shrimp! That is why they came out rubbery!  3-4 minutes per side!

I will never know how these tasted, people devoured them at a recent b-day party. I did add shallots and fresh garlic and marinated for 4 hours prior to putting on the grill and brushed with the left over marninade. Be careful when doing this as the olive oil and tequila will cause flare ups on the grill. 
I made enough for 50 people (12 lbs) and served on a cold plate sitting over ice. I never got to have any, they were a hit at the party. You know something is good when there is none left. We will definately be making again only next time just for us!! I'll post pictures soon.

Yummy!! Have made this a few times as written. Always very good. Have found adding pinch of Cayenne improves it for me. The mild undercurrent of hot goes nicely with the tequila and other spices.

Absolutely wonderful marinade! I Used the this recipe and added 1/4 teaspoon ground black peppercorns, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon cummin, DOUBLE the tequila (4 TBLS) and LEAVE the Shell on the Shrimp!! It holds the marinade in. BBQ shrimp till pink in color, do not over cook or will be rubbery and tough. My husband and I are caterers, Love this recipe :)

This is an easy and excellent appie.  I did not grill the shrimp, rather fried them for a few minutes in olive oil and served with toothpicks.  Everyone loved them.

I followed this recipe fairly closely... although as I finished I added about 2 tsp of chili powder for extra flavor.  The final dish was OK -- but seemed to be a little less exciting than I was hoping for...  I only marinaded for about an hour in the fridge, as I believe the citrus cooks the shrimp slightly.  I may make this again, but I would be sure to also add cayenne pepper and more black pepper for a little extra flavor.

This was great.  Marinade didn't overpower the shrimp, but still added a nice flavor.  Great for a light summer bbq, chips and guacamole for an appetiser and a nice margarita on the side to compliment.  I'll be making this again and suspect it will be a frequent meal in the hot summer Texas heat!

An easy fix around the acidity pre-cooking the shrimp is to marinade it with everything but the lime until the end. As other reviewers have suggested, you will need to double the tequila, add cilantro, and use real garlic. Add the lime with 30 min of marinating to go. This tastes incredible in shrimp tacos!

Nice flavor, but would have never known the shrimp was marinated with tequila. Therefore, I'd say make the marinade without the tequila and save it for a margarita to go with the shrimp.

The marinade was not enough for a pound of shrimp. I doubled it and even then it was almost not enough. Marinated for one hour because others had suggested it but it was not enough time as the shrimp did not take on any flavor. I would maybe try this again but would marinate for at least 3 hours.

This recipe was tasty, but I did add cilantro to it.  The marinade seemed very light.  I would have liked a little more flavor.  I made cocktail sauce to go with it to add some more flavor to it.  I would make it again, but tweak it a little.

i dislike it when people don't follow recipes and then review based on their adaptations. however...i planned on making this today, but upon reaching into the freezer to pull out the bottle of tequila that i've had for a decade or longer, i discovered that i actually had two bottles of very cold gin. so, i made it with gin, and got rave reviews. who knew? some day i may have to try it with tequila, but it's pretty darned good with gin!! :-)

I would marinate longer next time.  I was running short on time so only marinated about 20 minutes.  Grumpy still enjoyed it - so it can't be a horrible recipe!

Tasty and very easy.  I left out the tequila but they were still yummy.  Skewered them but put them under the broiler instead of the grill (it's about 20 below here in Chicago this weekend!)

These were very easy to make, and my family enjoyed them a lot. They said there wasn't a strong tequila taste, but that the flavour was good. Grilled on a perforated grill pan to avoid the bother of skewering them. Thanks!

This was alright. You can't marinate it for very long at all or the shrimp will "cook" in the lime/tequila, so those flavors were very subtle. That's OK, it's shrimp & tequila. How can that be bad?:o)

My husband made these for a family BBQ. As suggested he used fresh garlic not the garlic salt. Also added fresh cilantro. There were none left. This is a great recipe for summer. We are looking forward to having these again.

Tried this recipe for the first time yesterday for a party and it was a big hit. The only thing I did different was to let it marinade for about three hours. 
The shrimp were bursting with flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I am sorry to pan this recipe, but it was disappointing.  Unfortunately, the first time I made it I served it for guests as part of a Mexican themed dinner, where I was looking for a seafood appetizer.  I followed suggestions to marinade it for only one hour, and I increased the cumin and added garlic as some suggested.  The flavor was okay, but the texture was not good at all. It was tough and kind of spongy.  I would not make this again.

Pretty darned good, but I could tell it wouldn't be spicy enough for husband and I see no reason not to put fresh garlic in everything! Only changes I made were 1-1/2 lbs of shelled, deveined, headless shrimp; in marinade: NO garlic salt; used 3 fresh cloves of garlic from my crushing press (otherwise I would have used 6 minced); used a teaspoon of cumin rather than a pinch; used 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper in the marinade. Grilled for 2 minutes per side (brushing with leftover marinade) just until they turned pink and took 'em in the house. Sprinkled them with powdered cayenne right before hubby and I consumed every last shrimp. Delicious base recipe!

This was a no go for us.  All we could taste was the lime.  We used fresh garlic but the flavors were bland due to the overwhelming lime.

Marinated over night because I ended up forgetting to grill them.  It did cook the shrimp a bit but I just didn't overcook them on the grill.  I think they would've been a little better spicier but they were pretty good.

We enjoyed these. The only thing I did differently was that I used fresh garlic instead of the salt and I sprinkled paprika over them once they were done. I will make these again.

A big hit with our family.  Only problem was we didn't have any leftovers!  I didn't have any cumin (and I'm not a huge fan of cumin) so I used cilantro and loved it.  I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I was afraid the flavor was going to be too bland after the shrimp were cooked, but it was excellent!

The shrimp was just okay, sort of tasteless though, would marinate longer and add some more spices. I added red chili peppers on the shrimp themselves and that helped.

Not as much flavor as I would have expected. Make 50% more of the marinade and reserve for brushing onto the shrimp (both sides) at the very end of grilling, and for dipping/drizzling during the meal.

We liked it - easy to make and light. I doubled the tequila, used fresh garlic and added a pinch of cayenne as suggested. It was a bit dry so will try reserving some of the liquid before marinading to add just before serving.

We really liked this recipe.  I doubled all of the marinade ingredients, as suggested, and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  We used these for shrimp tacos, topped  with peach mango salsa.  Will definitely make again.

Easy recipe and definitely delivers the perfect flavour for any summer meal. I added garlic and used sea salt. The cumin balanced out the lime and tequila nicely as well. This was part of our BBQ with cilantro lime rice, huli huli chicken and roasted veggie salad.

The only reason that I'm giving this 4 stars is because I changed it slightly and we loved it.  Made it last night for dinner.  I decreased the olive oil to 2T because I thought 1/4 cup was too much for 1 lb. of shrimp.  I also omitted the garlic salt and used one clove of fresh minced garlic, added about 1T freshly chopped cilantro and about 1/8t cayenne pepper.  Very easy to make and will definitely make it again.

These shrimp were excellent! Made them for company on Cinco de Mayo with just a couple adjustments: made 2 1/2 pounds of shrimp so used 5 Tbsp of tequila and 5 Tbsp of lime juice, used 5 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. Also added some chopped cilantro, couple shakes of cumin, pinch of cayenne and a little bit of kosher salt and pepper. Will definately make again !

Great recipe.  I used some fresh garlic because I didn't think the garlic salt would be potent enough.

If half stars were possible I would give this 3.5 stars. These were good but rather bland. I made these exactly as written but next time I am going to add shallots, fresh garlic instead of garlic salt & some fresh cilantro. Overall a quick, easy and tasty grilled shrimp dish.

First time I followed the recipe, it was a tad too bland.  Tonight, Tripled the tequila, quad the lime, doubled cumin, and skewered the shrimp with red onion quarters - FANTASTIC!
Older folks need additional seasonings!

As others suggested, I added cilantro...Plenty of it! I also kept the shell on the shrimp as you should ALWAYS do when you grill shrimp or it'll turn to rubber. I also added the zest of the lime that I juiced which pumped up the lime flavor.  Overall good base recipe but like others mentioned it needs a slight punch of heat so next time I'll add either a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.

Great recipe, bright, fresh flavors, east to prepare.  I thought that 1-4 hours marinading is a bit long.  After about an 1:15 in the acidic mix the shrimp was noticeably softer, but still workable.  I'd keep it under an hour, probably safe to increase if you're using larger shrimp; (I had 26 per pound).

I'll skip the garlic next time and maybe add some cilantro and red pepper to spice it up a bit.

Outstanding.  Let it marinade for about 3 hours.  I sprinkled more than a pinch of the said seasonings because a pinch seemed like too little.  Will def make again!

I agree, I used about 5 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, added fresh chopped cilantro as well as about 1/2tsp of Cajun seasoning, cracked pepper and some sea salt. It was amazing! Great flavor. Will definitely make this again!
