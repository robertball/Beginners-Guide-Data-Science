My son and I made this and it was very good. The chorizo was too salty and spicy though. I would suggest leaving out the extra salt (1 tsp). Next time we will make it with ground beef or turkey instead and some taco seasoning. My son had a ball making the raviolis. We would definitely try this again with the modifications I mentioned.

Absolutely wonderful!! The raviolis are fragile (just as a warning) but the flavor is wonderful. I paired it with portebello mushroom pasta sauce. As a side I had Swiss Chard and Asparagus. One of the best dishes I've made! Boyfriends top five!

This recipe is not the greatest I've tried.  The meat mixture was WONDERFUL!  I didn't have any chorizo, so I used ground beef and added a bunch of seasonings.  Using the wonton wrappers was unappealing. They got slimy after being boiled, and they didn't stay sealed.  I did not use them.  I will definitely use the meat mixture again for something else, but NOT with wonton wrappers.  I think they would be better pan-fried or deep-fried.

Just made these and followed the recipe until it came to the cooking part.  Instead of boiling them, I made them like I normally make potstickers/gyoza.  I put a little oil in a pan and browned the bottoms of them and then added broth (beef was my first choice but I only had chicken) to cover about 1/4 inch of the ravioli and cover them and steam until liquid is gone.  If you don't like Chorizo, taco meat would work great.  I want to try them with ground turkey or chicken taco meat next.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the raviolis fell apart when I was boiling them. The mixture tasted good but didn't stay together. Next time I will either bake them or cook them in a pan. I also made a marinara sauce but I made it more mexican. I added chili's, mexican stewed tomatoes, black beans, corn, cumin and garlic and that was very good!

Not sure if I was just having a slow day, but it took way longer than 20mins to prepare these. Apart from adding a little more ground cumin, I made them as written, and although we did enjoy them, I'm not sure it was really worth the prep time.

I used soy chorizo and tofu instead of chorizo and ricotta cheese to make them vegetarian(can't find vegan wonton wrappers).  Sooo good! I made these for Valentine's Day for my husband, he loves soy chorizo, what a hit!!!  I also used enchilada sauce instead of marinara.  YUM!

My husband and I loved this.  We really like chorizo though.  If you've never had chorizo, it is a bit different.

Call me crazy - or just used to Chorizo - but I love this recipe.  I made this for my husband, cousin, and her husband and I'm making it again tonight.  For people who are not familiar with Chorizo - you should try it in other recipees first before you try it in this meal.  Muy Bien!

Yuck!!!  Although my husband and son were nice enough to eat some of it they said it was the worst meal I have ever made.  I threw mine out after just one bite.

These were delicious. I used soy chorizo to cut back on the calories and grease and used manchego cheese.. Asadero had been in the store every week except when I went to make these!! I cooked these like potstickers since other mentioned them falling apart when boiled. Really enjoyed these.

I used Soyrizo as an alternative for real chorizo. But it did come out a bit too salty. I ended up  adding some pepper and chili powder to give it the spice level I like. Also I added a small slice of avocado to each ravioli  to cut the saltiness a bit more, and it did work!

My daughter and I made this for Christmas dinner today and it was loved by all!!!  We used a cookie cutter to make them cuter shaped but that's just how we do things!  I wish I had taken a picture!  We pan fried them and ate them with queso and salsa and they were excellent!  I did drain the chorizo as it is very greasy of you have never eaten it but it is one of my favorites!   We will definitely be making this again and again!!

These were AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly with the one exception of leaving the salt out of the chorizo/cheese mixture like another reviewer suggested. The result was awesome. If you're looking to make this for four or more I would suggest doubling the recipe as this won't make enough as is. Also, take your time with the wanton wrappers. It takes time to completely seal them, but the end result is so worth it if you're patient with them. Keep your workspace dry and there will be no problem keeping them sealed or sticking to each other. This has been one of my husband's and my favorite recipes from this site so far; will definitely be making again!

I used HOT ground sausage meat and HOT Habonara Mexican Blend cheese otherwise followed recipe.  My hubby said they were too spicy.  If I make this again I will use the Hot sausage meat with plain cheddar.

Made exactly per recipe. Boiling these just turned out okay. Most filling fell out. However, I fried them after and tasted great!!!

The taste of these was okay, the presentation was a little funky with the boiled wrapper.  Would not make again.

My picky daughter loved this. After trying to boil these turned disaterous(they all kept breaking) I sprayed with olive oil and baked them- they were delicious!

I used Salvordian Chorizo in this recipe - had to increase the meat to 4 links instead of 2. I didn't add the extra salt but they came out great!!! I agree that it took WAY longer then 20 minutes to prepare though...
