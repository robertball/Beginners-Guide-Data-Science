I followed this recipe to a T minus the frosting and only the outside of the cake resemble the Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I baked it for the recommended time and it was very soupy in middle, so I baked it for another hour.  After 2 hours and 20 min the inside is still somewhat creamy and could have used another 45 mins to get that cheese cake factory texture.

I made this cheesecake Sunday.  Because I used store bought graham cracker pie crusts, I winded up with 2.  Good thing I did because my 5 year old granddaughter wanted to sneak and  "see" the cheesecake and dropped it on the floor! Anywho, on to the one that survived.....AMAZING!!!!  I made a couple of changes.  First, I winded up using a full cup of sugar because it wasn't sweet enough with the 2/3 cup.  Second, I put in a splash of lemon juice for some acidity. Finally, I used strawberries as a garnish.  I am make some tonight for a funeral and two more this weekend for one of my Easter desserts.
