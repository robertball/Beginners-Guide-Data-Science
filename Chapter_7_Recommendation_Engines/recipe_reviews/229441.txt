I used big chunks of chicken & half the marmalade.  It was a good meal & everyone liked the new twist on leftovers.  In response to another review,er it takes a darn good cook to come us with new ideas for left overs.  Come to think of it, this would probable be good using the left over pork roast.

Sorry but not a hit in this house. Not a good flavor in my opinion
