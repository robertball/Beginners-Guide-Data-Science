I loved this recipe. I didn't know what a maple plank was, so I just baked them for 35-45 min. But I fallowed the recipe for the stuffing to a tee and it turned out great. My boyfriend doesnt even eat stuffing on Thanksgiving and he loved it. I will def make this again!!!

these were pretty good. my husband loved them. the only change i made was i used a cedar plank because our store didn't have maple. also, the mixture was a little wet, so next time i will add the croutons, then slowly add the broth until i get a good consistency.

The stuffing and the pork were awesome, but I had a little trouble grilling on the plank.  Never having grilled on a plank before, I bought a 1/4 inch piece of maple and soaked it for 6 hrs in water.  Either my plank was way too thin, or didn't soak it long enough (maybe it was a combination) but after about 5 minutes the entire piece of wood was on fire!  I prompty removed the pork chops from the fiery plank and put them on the top rack of the grill, where they only 15 more minutes to grill.  they were slightly blackened, but still excellent.  My family's only complaint was that the stuffing might have been a little too miost.  Will definately try again, with a thicker plank, soaked longer and a little less chicken broth in the stufing.  Would have been 5 stars if not for the fire!

This turned out great but I didnt follow the recipe to a tee. I didnt have a maple plank so i used the oven. I used italian flavoured breadcrumbs rather then croutons, and i only had 2 big porkchops so i cut slits in them and stuffed the sauce in there and smeared the remainder on top. I definately think that there is way too much broth in the recipe. i only used about half a cup or so. My toddler liked this too. She said 'delicious!'

Great! This looks difficult but was incredible easy.  I too baked these in the oven and only used about a 1/2 cup of stock.  Definately something to make that would impress your guest.  Side salad and some pinot grigio what a feast

Amazing recipe. Best stuffing for pork chops I have found. I substituted seasoned bread crumbs instead of croutons and it soaked up the broth very well. made dinner for 8 and received nothing but compliments (and my friends are usually mean :) Definitely recommend.

This was a fantastic recipe, I listened to the reviewers about using a bit more croutons and it turned out great. One other comment I have is for the novice grillers out there, I am much more of a griller than an indoor cook, when plank grilling anything you need to have a spray bottle full of water handy to put out those flare ups. They will happen no matter how long you presoak the plank.
