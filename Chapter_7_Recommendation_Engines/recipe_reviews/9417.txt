Great apple pie if you don't especially care for a lot of pastry crust; this one has a tasty crumble topping instead.  
After fumbling with the parchment paper method unsuccessfully (I didn't think of stapling it until after the fact, but just folding it up didn't work), I placed the pie in a brown paper grocery sack, folded the open end down under the sack and it worked great.  Just be careful that the fold doesn't cause your pie to be tilted.  
I researched the paper bag method a bit online and found others who even sell pies made this way.  They mentioned that the bag keeps the apples moist and gives them a chance to fully cook without overcooking the crust.
Next time I may take it out of the bag to brown a bit more at the end of the baking time, but it still had nice color after 1 hour as called for.
I used 6 medium Granny Smith Apples, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon since I think something is missing without cinnamon in an apple pie!
I will make this again since the topping is a nice touch.

This was my first apple pie and it came out exactly the way it should have. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. I even added 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon for my special tastes.

I used this for my very first try at pie making. My husband being gluten free,I substituted a GF ready made pie shell and some GF all purpose flour.Because I have diabetes I substituted agave syrup for the white sugar. The recipe did not suffer at all in fact the pie  came out so delicious that today just two days after my first try, I am making it again just adding a quart of black raspberries I had to use can't wait to taste it Sunday I am trustingly bringing it to a party!

You can't go wrong with recipe.  It turned out great and the parchment papers saves on oven mess.

Instead of using parchment paper, I put the pie in a brown grocery bag.  I sprinkled a bit of water on the top of the bag and baked as directed.  Much less fuss!

I made this pie the other day, as I had some 
apples that needed to be used up. I didn't have
parchment paper but I did have a paper bag, so
I used it. I spritzed the bag with water at the beginning and mid way through the baking. This
pie turned out great being nicely browned on the top and it tasted great as well. Thanks Cathy for a great recipe
