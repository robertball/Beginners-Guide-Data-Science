I was in the midst of making my gingerbread house with another recipe when I ran out of dough for the roof. I decided to make more using this recipe. The dough baked well and looked promising. The next day however, when putting the roof together, the pieces broke into half! I had to use icing to glue them back. It was just too fragile and soft for making a house. But to be fair, the recipe does say 'shoe box size house'. It must be a very small one. In that case, I don't think the pieces would have broke. Also, this is not for eating - doesn't really taste that good.

I used this recipe for my gingerbread houses in Dec. 2003. My family has used the same recipe for the past 35 years and my mother has become a convert since switching to this recipe. I was able to make 25 medium sized houses last year with no problems. the dough was easy to work with and rolled out to an even, smooth texture. The one trick to remember when working with any gingerbread recipe is to bake it long enough (dark, golden brown and firm to the touch) and allow the gingerbread to sit at room temperature for at least a day. This allows the gingerbread to fully solidify making it much easier to handle. The shortening in this recipe makes the gingerbread very firm and smooth unlike recipes that call for oil. Overall, a great recipe for house construction.

This is the same recipe for Gingerbread cookies in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. I have never used it to make a gingerbread house, only to make cookies. It's a fantastic, easy to make recipe, and kids always have fun both decorating and eating these. Not sure why others complain about the taste, I found them great!

Really great dough for making decorations,easy to roll and cut, but doesn't taste good at all.
