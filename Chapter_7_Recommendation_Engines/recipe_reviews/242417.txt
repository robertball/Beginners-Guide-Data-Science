I prepared as written with 1/4c honey bbq sauce and 1/4c spicy bbq sauce. I baked it in the oven at 425 for 10min on each side. These turned out great! Very good flavor!

Very easy to make...the sauce glazes to the pork chops and it's great. My kids loved the sweet aspect to the sauce and devoured the pork chops.

Absolutely delicious. I bought a pork loin and brined using Baking Nana's brine recipe and then sliced to about 1" thick and froze until ready to use. Thawed the pork and followed the recipe as is. Definitely a keeper. So moist and tender and the sauce was delicious. I thought it would be too sweet but it was perfect. I used Bullseye bbq sauce. Thanks for a keeper weldin-an-cookin!

Fantastic!! Guests loved it! I used pear butter instead of apple butter and it turned out really good!

I didn't have any apple butter so I substituted applesauce. I also let these marinate overnite.  Very tender and delicious!

Yummy!  I halved the sauce for just 2 chops, I think that was still a bit too much sauce. I also cut up and apple, skewered it and basted it with the sauce, that was really good with the pork.
Quick and easy week night dinner.

Very delicious. Very small bite to the bbq sauce but I used Jack Daniels  though. Easy to prepare and easy to make. Highly recommend this recipe.

This was amazing. We decreased the amount of pepper considerably and it was superb! This recipe is a keeper.

Make sure grill is not too hot so sauce soaks in rather than burning.  Delicious!

Pretty darn good chops!  I used my favorite BBQ sauce, Sticky Fingers Memphis, my own homemade apple butter, and boneless pork chops.  Marinated them for more than two hours and my husband grilled them to perfection, about three minutes per side. They were flavorful, juicy and tender.  Can't ask for more than that.

This was an easy and tasty marinade. Like reviewer Sugarplum, I subbed applesauce for apple butter. I also added a dash of Tapatio hot sauce for a little extra zing.

This recipe resulted in nice juicy, tender and flavorful chops that were easy to prepare with ingredients I had on hand.  That warrants a definite 5 star rating in my book!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
