This was so easy and very tasty.  I had to substitute pine nuts instead of sunflower seed kernels and I didn't have any flaxseeds and I used a healthy granola mix kind of cereal instead of granola but I am very happy with the result.  It might rate a five star if I had all of the proper ingredients.  I gave it four stars because it was a little soft and sticky but I think that was because of my substitutions.  The flavor is incredible and although soft they held together pretty well.

I think this is a great recipe!   I liked them better the 2nd day as I think they needed to kind of mix together better.  My only substitution was crunchy almond butter for the peanut butter.

The only changes I made were: I used dark brown sugar, creamed peanut butter with chopped peanuts, and my home made granola/muesli.  Was a little dry/crumbly. I think this is a great base, and just have to play with measurements to get the right consistency with my own granola.

This was a quick and easy granola bar recipe and they are great to wrap individually for snacks during a long day!
