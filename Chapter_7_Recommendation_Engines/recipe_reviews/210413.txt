this is a great party dessert! i would recommend to cut the milk/crean in half because it makes it too runny. Large marshmallow, bananas, strawberries and pound cake are good dipping ingredients.

This fondue was tasty but also runny, which most people didn't like. If I make this again, I think I'll cut the milk in half so I can get the thick, creamy consistency that I love in restaurant-style chocolate fondue.

We used Ghirardelli bittersweet and milk chocolate chips rather than bars, as they melt quicker. Ghirardelli melts smoother than Baker's chocolate (which tends to be more grainy) and the taste is richer, so I would opt for Ghirardelli for sure. We skipped the chocolate liquor as we couldn't find it in our grocery store. Nonetheless, everyone loved the smooth, rich taste (served with pound cake bites and fresh fruit). This recipe was the hit of our party! Scrumptious!!!

This was a delicious fondue recipe! I made it for a party, and everyone loved it. I did not use the Ghirardelli chocolate. I used Baker's unsweetened and semi-sweet and added a half cup of sugar and then stirred in milk until it was the right consistency. Very dark and very good.

Best fondue we've tried after many recipes.  I could only find semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips so used those along with the Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate baking bar.  At the recommendation of other reviews, I started with 1/2 the cream and then added a bit more until I reached the desired thickness.   Delicious.  Definitely will be making this again!

Tastes great BUT I would not add butter when I make it again. I had to spoon off the melted butter before we could eat it- gross!

Followed others' suggestion and used 3/14 c. of heavy cream and the consistency was perfect- smooth and fluid. Also, omitted butter and didn't miss it.  I used Bailey's instead of chocolate liquor, but two tbls wasn't enough to taste it. Used Ghirardelli chocolate chips- half semi-sweet, half milk chocolate. To dip, we used pretzels, strawberries, Belgian cookies, marshmallows, and pineapple. Delicious!

Awesome!  Having a fondue party for 16. I used 3 cups of half & half, 4T butter, and 4 bags (10-11.5 ounce) of chips (2 Ghiardelli milk chocolate, 2 of 60% cacao bittersweet)  Makes plenty and it's totally yummy. Don't make it too early in the day, you may not have enough left by the time the guests arrive! ;-)

Yummy!  We all loved it.

I used 3/4 cup of heavy cream and Ghiradelli chips instead of the baking bar.

It was just the right consistency for us.

This fondue was amazing! I substituted Amaretto for the chocolate liquor and it came out wonderfully! My fiancee and I made it for date night and couldn't keep the rest of his family out of it while it was still in the kitchen.

This recipe was amazing! I am not a big fan of chocolate and this recipe even had me going back for more.  It was a hit with me and my friend! I only did 1 cup of milk and 1 1/2 tbsps butter.  I can only imagine how much better it would be with the chocolate liqueur.  I served it with strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, bananas, pound cake, Granny Smith green apples, Oreos, peanuts and Salt and Vinegar chips.  The next time I make it I'm putting bacon on the menu instead of the chips.  The combination of salty and sweet will send you over the edge.

Perfect, quick and easy recipe! Nuked the wet ingredients, added the choc chips, nuked again for about 30 sec, poured into small crockpot to keep warm. Everyone enjoyed every last bit!

Great recipe!  Turned out great, but I indeed change the amount of milk after reading the reviews.  I used half of the servings that the menu called for and it came out perfect. If I had used the amount listed it would have been way too thin.  Other than that.  So easy and delicious!  Thank you!

Very good recipe. A sure fire winner. As some of the other reviewers, I also found the amount of cream to be excessive, so I cut it to 3/4 cups and it turned out a fondue of just the right consistency. I also suggest using Lindt milk chocolate instead, as it is a lot creamier and has a better flavor than Ghirardelli milk chocolate. As far as dark chocolate goes, though... Ghirardelli has one of the best, hands down. Another reviewer suggested using chocolate chips. That is a great idea, as the chocolate melts faster and more evenly and cuts down on the chopping. All in all, a very good recipe!

This recipe gets high marks for its simplicity.  My kids absolutely LOVE it!  There is nothing about the flavor of the chocolate that makes it 'to die for' however, thus only 4 stars.  (I did not, however, make it with chocolate liqueur, as I made it for the whole family, kids included.  Perhaps that would make a difference?)

My guests were RAVING about this for days.  Easy to make. I did cut back heavy cream to 3/4 cup. About half of what was called for.  You can make this ahead and then warm on the stove and but into fondue dish with burner.

This came out great.  I used a bag of 60% cocoa and a bag of milk chocolate Ghiradelli chips and the consistency came out perfect.  I've never had luck making chocolate fondue before, but this recipe was definitely a winner.  I saw some other people had issues with the thickness--I added a bit more chocolate than what it called for.  I also had no issues with the butter pooling.

The flavor of this recipe was real good. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry and since there were so many 5 star reviews I didn't read the reviews resulting in much too thin consistency.

Like the other reviewers, I decreased the amount of cream and butter by half. It was perfect! And of course I added the chocolate liqueur! It was was perfect!

Amazing!  Out of this world! My daughter wanted a chocolate fondue instead of a cake for her birthday.  We used Girardelli 60% cacao (because that's what the store had) with the Girardelli milk chocolate.  PERFECT bittersweet-ness that enhanced rather than overwhelm the flavors of the fruits and cookies served with it.   It was so easy to make--will never do store bought again.  Leftovers keep well in the fridge for later treats. Her friends talked about it for days, she finally packed some of the leftovers for them. WOW!

How can you go too far wrong with chocolate fondue? Per other reviews, I used a bit less milk and I used one bag of semi-sweet chips (12 oz) instead of the bars. Verrry chocolately, but that is the point. bananas and mini cream puffs were the favorite dippers.

Recipe is bang on the money.  The Heavy cream is key., so if you have too much chocolate melted, just add more heavy cream and it’s all good in the hood.

This was part of mine and my fiancé’s New Year’s eve dinner. Yes, it was a little runny however, we had so much food that we were happy for the length it went to. Also we were able to save it for the next day and have a bit more on New Year’s day evening! The recipe also lends it’s self to be made into truffles when completely cooled, or a ganache when semi cooled. ???

Very good and easy recipe that I made in the microwave.  I took the advice of others and used 3/4 cup of cream and omitted the butter.  I will make this recipe again.

Made this as a trial run to see if I would like it to take to my bookclub meeting next week.  Therefore, I only made a small batch.  Just eyeballed the heavy cream and butter and added Bailey's as some others suggested.  Turned out great and will be taking this treasure to my girls.  Will let you know if it was a hit with them after the "meeting".

The first batch had to be thrown away.  We tried to drain the melted butter which floated on the top of the chocolate. 
The second try was much better without the butter and less heavy cream.

Fabulous! I'm not fancy, so I only had Nestles semi sweet chips on hand... and 2% milk. I ended up using 1 cup of the 2% and 5 tablespoons unsalted butter. Maybe sacrilegious, but we all loved it!

Omitted the chocolate liqueur because we didn't have any, it was still fantastic.  We used another type of 70 pct cacao bittersweet chocolate because Ghirardelli wasn't available.  I would go with 70 pct  vs less cacao if you have to make the choice, it was super. We dipped strawberries, marshmallows, pound cake, Pretzel sticks, pineapple, angel food cake which was way too messy, and nutter butter wafers , (OMG!!!). Tip: Do not go for dipping supplies when you are pregnant.

This fondue would have been delicious if you're someone who likes more bitter chocolate.  I even added some sugar, and it didn't really change the taste.  Next time I make it, I will use sweet milk chocolate instead because I'm a sucker for sweetness.  Once again, I used coconut milk instead of cream, and I must say that move was probably a major setback.  But in the end, I was still able to enjoy this fondue with strawberries.

The amount of chocolate is too small. We had chocolate soup.We had to add at least 1/2 cup of chocolate bits and 1 bar of Hershey's bittersweet chocolate to get it to the correct consistency. We did not measure the additions since our guests were waiting. We just added until we got it right.

This is a great recipe. I eyeballed the heavy cream instead of what the recipe called for. To heat up the leftovers, I just added more heavy cream until it had the consistency I was looking for. We served it with marshmellows, Oreao cookies, bananas, strawberries, and granny smith apples.

Yum! Really good and easy. Use about 1/2 the milk amount (like others recommend).  I also used milk chocolate chips, but did use the Ghiradelli baking bar chocolate.
