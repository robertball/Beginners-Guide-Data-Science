After making a few minor changes such as adding a little celery seed and increasing the sour cream to 1 cup and decreasing the dillweed to 1-1/2 TBSP, we found this to be a wonderful potato salad.

Simple and delicious!  If you love the flavor of dill, you'll LOVE this potato salad!  It tastes a little bit like "sour cream and onion" due to the green onion in this.  I followed the recipe exactly, using the optional salt and cracked black pepper.  To lighten it up I used Hellman's lite mayo and light sour cream.  I really wouldn't change much with this except maybe to use a bit less dill  - 1 & 1/2 Tbsp. next time. This is a definite keeper when you want a quick, great tasting potato salad.

Really simple and very tasty.  I added celery which just gave it a nice crunch.

I liked the idea of this for its simplicity but found it pretty tasteless before I did a lot of doctoring.  I added  a lot more dill (I used fresh), celery salt, Jane’s Krazy Mixed Up Salt, and some thinly sliced radishes and celery.  There was also a little too much mayonnaise for my liking, so I mellowed  out the tang with more sour cream.  Basic recipes are nice to build upon, but they should also stand alone on their own merits without tinkering being necessary.

This is very good.  Reminds me of vegetable dip.  A shortcut is to slice your potatoes into bite sized pieces before you boil them.

Even better than what my Mom used to make. I halved the recipe as there was just myself, my Dad, and my boyfriend from England. Served with Roasted Chicken and Creamed Corn. I did the 2 tblsp of dill as we love dill in our house. Also, I served it warm as my Mom used to do. It was creamy and very dilly...just how we like it.

Excellent .....used 3/4c of low fat sour cream, 1/2c low fat mayo made with olive oil, and 1/2c fat free plain yogurt.  Also used fresh dill and more than the recipe calls for. Extremely tasty and sits well in the fridge ad I made this on Friday for Easter Sunday and the flavors melded perfectly.  Thanks!

I think this is my new FAVE potato salad...YUM! I did follow the other reviewers advice (increased sour cream to 1 cup and decreased dill to 1 1/2 TB). I also added a little celery and garlic salt. My sour cream and mayo used were both light, turned out delish!

If you don't like mustard based potato salads, this is the salad for you. I made a 10 lbs salad, and my goodness did it go fast! In fact I'm making it again this weekend, and everyone is chomping at the bit for some more. What a great salad!

I've been trying to find the recipe that is similar to the deli salad I get from Kroger. This is pretty close, but I had to make some changes. I had to use russets, as it was all I had. It was okay, but I'll defnitely use red or yukon gold potatoes next time because the waxy potatoes hold up better. I also upped the sour cream to equal the mayo. I think I'll cut back on the mayo next time because it was way to mayo-tasting. I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic, and I used a LOT more dill weed. I also drizzled a lot of olive oil in it to give it that similar taste to Kroger's. I forgot the green onions, but I have lots left, so I'm definitely going to add it to the salad. I might even try adding a little celery seed like another reviewer suggested. Hubby actually likes this version a lot more than Kroger's version! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as is and thought it was a bit on the boring side.  There just really isn't enough here to give it any good or interesting flavor.  I made it because I like dill, but it just didn't really help it.  It was OK but I don't think I'd want to make it again.

Mmmm, mmmm!  This is delicious!  I must admit, I did use fresh herbs (dill & chives) because my garden is growing, and I like to use it ; ).  I'll definitely make this again, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I was disappointed.  I love all the ingredients, but mixed together seemed heavy and lacked flavor. Will not make again.

This is easy and yummy!  I swapped the quantities of mayonnaise and light sour cream and only used 1T dill, which is plenty (and I love dill).  Then at the last minute I also chopped up some dill pickles to mix in, and garnished it will dill pickle spears.  I'll be making this again!

Very good and exactly what I was looking for.  I needed to double the creamy dressing recipe (use regular mayo not fat free).  I also used other's recommendation and added some celery salt.  Perfect!

I've made this recipe several times. It is very tasty and can be adjusted to your personal preference. Tonight I didn't have sour cream so I used plain Greek yogurt. I did change the ratio to 1 part yogurt to 2 parts mayo since yogurt has a bit more tang.  I also used chopped red onion since I didn't have green onions. It turned out great as usual!

I have been making this recipe for years. The only difference, I add
a couple of spoonfuls of drained dill relish to really accentuate that flavor.

Sauted the green onions, used fresh dill and substituted the mayo and sour cream with plain non-fat yogurt and 1/2 tsp of white cider vingar. Added some celery seed too. Awesome!

Yum! I love this potato salad! My mom used to make it sometimes too. I used fresh dill instead of dried, and I diced up my potatoes before boiling them. Whenever I make tato salad, I always drain the potatoes and then season them generously with salt and pepper while they're still warm. I think maybe it helps to flavor them up a little. Thanks for the great recipe!

I appreciated using this as a guide but I did make a whack of changes as I went, mostly because of what I had on hand and wanted to include.  My family and I are very pleased with the results.  What I did:  - Cut the dill back to 1 1/2 tbsp - Swapped the measures for mayo & sour cream to 3/4 c. & 1 c. respectively and used light versions of both - skipped the green onions and minced a whole med/large yellow onion instead (may try red next time - 3 cloves of garlic, crushed - several hands full of snap peas, chopped - 4 or 5 hard boiled eggs, sliced - several dashes of Hungarian paprika

Terrific recipe! I used low-fat mayo and sour cream, and added a small finely diced red apple for crunch/color, as I am not a celery fan. I also added two diced boiled eggs. As someone mentioned, a good shortcut is to cut the potatoes into at least quarters before boiling.

I really liked this potato salad. The cool crisp flavors of the sour cream and the dill and green onions make this a great summer salad on a hot day.

Very tasty, even my teenaged boy really liked it.  I actually used equal amounts mayo & sour cream, based on what I needed to use up in my fridge & one of the other reviews.  This recipe is a keeper for me!

One of our family's favorite potato salads.  I add about 1 c. whole milk to the dressing to loosen it up a little & make it easier to go all over the potatoes.  Yummy yummy and so easy too!

I never bother with potato salad, since I can’t make my mom’s recipe as good as she can, so I decided to try something different and I absolutely love this recipe most of my family does I have one picky eater who won’t touch it. Otherwise it’s a hit. Thanks I’ve made it a few times already and decided I needed to review it.

I've never seemed to make a good potato salad until this recipe. I used a handful of fresh dill from our garden, white onion and white pepper. It was amazing!! I might add hard boiled eggs and celery salt next time. PRO TIP: Make sure the potatoes are a'dente.

This is AMAZING potato salad! As many others suggested, I increased the sour cream to 1 cup and reduced the dried dill weed to 1 ½ TBSP. I cut the potatoes up into about 3/4" dice before cooking, and cooled them in the ice water bath. Oh, I also sprinkled some pickle juice over the potatoes before adding the dressing, as others suggested. 

This is so good I could eat it every day!! This is my new carry in (pot luck) recipe. Thank you!

Delicious and so quick and easy! Followed suggestions - bumped up the sour cream, used Asian mayo for tartness, reduced dill to 1.5 tbsp, and added finely sliced celery. Will make again!!!

I did make it but only because I did not cut the potatoes before I cooked them some came out less than done than others.  Totally my fault but I did enjoy the recipe and will make it again, this time cutting the potatoes before I boil them.

This was exactly what we were wanting and it turned out amazing!  I used fresh dill from our garden instead of dried dill weed, chives from our garden instead of green onions and a little bit of celery salt and a splash of white vinegar.  All I can say is that one is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!! Made it several times now. This last time my daughter suggested a few dashes of cayenne powder. I think that would be a good addition to an already great recipe.

Good salad in its own, but also a good starting point. I was trying to duplicate the Dill Potato salad that I get at the Delta Skyclubs. This is pretty close. We will definitely be making it again and again.

I've made this twice now and it never fails to please. What I love is how light and bright it is. I think it's ideal for summer and simple enough that it comes out perfect every time. The dill gives it that special spark.

I used a shallot instead of a green onion and it was a strong oniony flavor. If you don't like that, stick to the green onions. 
I liked it.  Next time, I will season the potatoes before adding the dressing, because it was kind of bland.

I liked it very much, as did my wife.  I made it to the recipe and it turned out well.  There was a lot of dressing for the potatoes - maybe slightly too much; next time I will use 3.5 or even 4 lbs of potatoes for the same dressing amounts.  Next time I will also use a full batch of green onions (7-8) rather than just 4.  Some Lawry's Seasoned Salt also was a good addition.  I'll be making this again.

I added egg and next time would add a little horseradish sauce for some zip.

Made exactly to the recipe except subbed 6 tbsp fresh dill for the 2 tbsp dried dill. Best potato salad I’ve ever had! Definitely a keeper.

I made it as stated. It was very creamy borderline to much sauce but since it tasted good I let it slide. I will probably use fresh dill next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Great green onion/dill flavor. Sometimes I add crumbled bacon. It's all good.
