thankfully i tested this recipe before thanksgiving. it wasnt very flavorful, and it was kind of greasy. The chestnut stuffing was average... kind of bland. I will stick to my ususal turkey recipe, but i am glad i gave this one a shot because with some changes, it could be really good.

this was a huge hit I did add fresh herbs instead of dried and was generous also cut the butter in 1/2 and added 2 cans of chicken broth also made my own croutons from 12 grain bread am sure I will be asked to make it again

Using toasted chestnuts might have been a better idea.
