Very, Very good.  The only change I made was to roll the dough out and on each side cut lines/slices two inches from the middle to the end.  This is so I could insert the fruit down the middle and in a criss cross pattern(alternating a strip from the sides) make a lovely braid.  Also, after closing I brushed the dough with an egg wash. For the filling I used the Easy Cream Cheese Danish recipe from this site. The second ball of dough I split in half to have 3 types of danish, in one I added apricot preserves and the other Polander rasberry fruit spread. Yummy!

Easy and yummy! I found them a little messy to put together, but it was worth it in the end.

Alright...I cheated on the dough. I used Pillsbury crescent dough instead with this recipe for the apple filling. Love love love it!

These were a lot easier to make than I thought they would be.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than to add more apples and omit the walnuts in the filling.  I made the dough last night and left in the fridge overnight, then made them for breakfast.  They were a huge hit, the kids thought it was great to have dessert for breakfast :)  The dough was a little sticky going into the fridge, but it was so easy to work with in the morning.  Will definitely make these again, maybe with different fillings next time.

The danish turned out well.  I did substitute blueberry pie filling.  Don't forget to add some sugar to the 1/4 cup of water and yeast like I did.

This turned out great with the cream cheese filling recipe on this site. I used all of the ingredients for the pastry dough but added the sugar, milk, water, and yeast together and left it for about 10 minutes to rise before adding it to the flour, salt, butter mixture. This is my second time making it and was hit, again, in the office and at home!
