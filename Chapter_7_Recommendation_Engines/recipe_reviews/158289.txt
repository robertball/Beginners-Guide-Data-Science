This was good and a little unusual for us.  I used fresh minced ginger instead of ground, and a combination of wild rice and this burgundy rice I found.  The dressing is good and contrasts the sweet/tartness of the dried cherries and the nutty rice flavor nicely, but I thought it needed additional vegetables.  Next time I might try adding some grated carrot, chopped scallions and parsley, and maybe a few slivered almonds for crunch.
