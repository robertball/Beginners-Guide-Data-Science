I don't know why this recipe got so many negative reviews. I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I did make some slight modification to it.  2 TSP of milk I have to assume was a misprint.  I added enough so the batter looked like waffle batter.  I added one Tbs of sugar.  This is important, I let the batter sit for 1/2 hour before I used it.  If fried up perfectly.  My whole family loved it.

Something's wrong or missing from this recipe.  If following these directions, the batter turns into part paste and part powder.  I tried adding more milk, but wonder if dipping the corn in egg/milk then in separate bowl of flour/cornmeal would work better.  This was not as I envisioned it to be.

Overall this was a pain to make, I had to rope my husband in to help out.  The nuggets turned out fine as long as they didn't burst open/break open, if that did happen they got extremly crispy and unedible.  I had to add more liquid to the batter to get it to the right consistancy also.

I love this recipe! I just moved to Texas from Mississippi and all my cookbooks are in storage back home. So this was the only way I could get it. This is one of my favorite things to eat! And now I have it here with me! Thank you so much "jers" for posting this recipe! :)

This recipe was terrible.  My husband is from TX and way dying for me to make some for him.  I tried on three different times, changing everything I could to make it work.  I even went as far as to freeze the corn mixture in ice cube trays.  Nothing worked.  I ended up with ONE good nugget, and a bunch of soggy corn/batter patties.  Oddly enough, he thought those were pretty good, but I have a feeling he was just trying to save my feelings.  I found some pre-made frozen ones at Walmart, so they're just going to have to do.  Please don't waste your time trying this recipe.

For my first attempt not a bad result, but you'd have to try this a few times before you got restaurant quality corn nuggets.

I read all the bad reviews about the batter, so I used a simple beer batter instead. (1/2 cup beer, 1 cup Bisquick, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp salt)

Maybe the liquid measurement is a typo?  2 tbls of milk just doesn't cut it...neither does 1 cup of milk, which is what I ended up using to make the batter liquid enough to coat the frozen corn.  But, that fell apart anyway and just made a complete mess of my deep fryer.    Bummer that it's the only 'corn nugget' recipe on this site..you just can't buy these frozen anymore!

Good start but something was missing. I played around with it and came up with something that works a little better. It should post before too long, being that it is in the review process right now. But over all, this is a good starting point for those wanting to make some of their own, and play around with a recipe.

HELPFUL HINTS TO MAKE WORK!
1) do NOT make the batter. add the milk and eggs whites to one bowl and then mix the corn meal, flour, salt, and pepper in another. Dip in egg/milk then roll in cornmeal/flour. Make sure is completely coated

2) freeze for more than 3 hrs. We froze ours in greased ice cube trays all day. They are big nuggets, but it works.

3) the recipie itself is blan. We to some we added chedder cheese or cream cheese(or both) to the corn mixture before freezing. to the cornmeal/flour mixture we added bay seasoning, cajun seasoning, and even chinese 5 spice to some batches. Some combination eventually worked. But by itself is boring

I did not like this recipe at all. It did not taste anything like what I was looking for. I've had corn nuggets in restaurants and this was not a corn nugget.

I have a lot of questions, First, why did the corn have to be in Liquid, was that suppose to be used in the recipe? The batter was way to thick. I feel that maybe something was left out or the measurements were not right. I used the whole egg and I added 4 more tablespoons of Milk. The batter was right to coat the frozen corn but had really no taste. I will continue to work on this recipe. I see a lot of people want this recipe to work....

I usually don't leave comments about recipes, good or bad but there is definitely something wrong with this recipe.  I kept adding tbsp of milk until it was thin enough to coat the corn. Though it was  still a little thick. Mine did not split open.

I thought this recipe was great. I used the advice of the sugar and added enough milk to get a consistency that looked right. The nuggets stayed together just fine once frozen. They spread out more into patties, so I cut them in half. The ice cube tray sounds like a great idea, too. They were just like the ones I've had in the south. Yum!

I added seasoned salt to the mixture and placed the cream corn mixture in ice trays (greased each individual one first) and placed in freezer. I added vanilla extract to the bread batter. And I used less milk, which makes the batter very thick.  Use a spoon to dip frozen corn into batter and place in hot oil for frying. The option for the beer batter by one reviewer sounds like a great option.  We loved them.

Like most of the other reviewers, mine didn't actually hold together at all. I kept adding milk, and that failed too. This is definitely not a good corn nugget recipe.

Once I figured out how to get the batter and corn to work together, I fried them, but to my dismay, the nuggets were blah to say the least; no flavor what-so-ever.  I wasted time and ingredients on this recipe.  Guess I should have read the reviews first; lesson learned.  Same issues with this one as almost everyone else.

Something is missing or flat out wrong with this recipe.  We saved it by simply mixing the corn mixture with the batter (which was more of a dough) and then dropping spoonfuls into the hot oil.  So there's no need to freeze the corn mixture (since I had to thaw it to mix it with the batter).  they were great like that.

These didn't turn out how I imagined.  The batter didn't stick to the corn very well, so I ended up with balls of batter with the occasional corn kernel in it.  They were still tasty, though.  If you add onions instead of the corn, you'll get some great hushpuppies.

These turned out horrible, they had no flavor this is the same recipe you see all over the internet. The ingredients make a half paste half powder batter. They lack flavor they don’t hold together trying to fry them and they’re just all around horrid to make.  I love corn nuggets and I’m trying the Paula Dean recipe next time it sounds better all around to eat handle and cook.

Well I didn't do what I do with everything else on line, read the reviews first. After reading, I saw many that found the same thing I did, thought an ingredient was missing. The others who found them delicious, modified the recipe in some way to "make it work". In its present form it does not work. I even went to the store to get the ingredients the recipe called for. My wife, who is a great cook and good at  just thinking up things in her head that work and taste good was saying you should have done this or that. I wanted to surprise her with corn nuggets but all it was was a mess. Sounds like the mixtures should have been combined then if need be frozen prior to cooking. The dry mixtures, ,  milk and egg white, when mixed just make a crumbly mess, not a batter that he recipe says to dip the frozen corn into. What can stick to a frozen corn mixture.  The corn although drained as called for still has water content in it which turns to ice within the three hours as called for.  I think the recipe as it stands now should be removed because it doesn't work.

I made this exactly as the recipe. 
1st- when you mix the 2 corns together, it is still too wet ( yes I drained the whole kernel) to hold form while waiting for it to freeze, so it flattens out instead of retaining a nugget shape.
2nd- the amounts for the batter when mixed resembles biscuit dough, very dry ( not enough liquid). 
3rd- when the frozen corn hits hot oil it dissolves instead of holding form.  Was a big mess in fryer.

It  was a bad recipe! We were so excited to make corn nuggets in Home Ec. and we found out that the recipe was so far off! It was wrong because it called for 2 tablespoons of milk until it was creamy but it looked like stuffing for a turkey. It was not edible because when we deep fried it fell apart. We have 40 minute classes and the recipe said it would be ready in 30 minutes. But you must freeze it for 3 hours. So it mislead us too.

Sincerely, 
Four Disappointed Student

Use an entire cup of cornmeal and use quinoa flour so it is gluten free. Use ice cube trays to form the nuggets

Even after adding more milk these corn nuggets tasted awful compared to the ones I've had at restaurants. This is the only recipe I've been able to find on corn nuggets too.

I would defiantly put an exact time to cook in oil instead of just saying cook until golden brown. And I did 1/2 cups of milk. Not 2 tbsp

When I found this recipe, my day was made but after trying it, not so much. I added more milk, that seemed to work. But I did freeze my corn in too big of piles. They looked more like hot cakes when i fried them in the skillet.  Next time I try this, I'm going for the ice cube method, and also dipping my corn in the egg and milk mixture before the dry coating. Salt and pepper with a little sugar are a must also, these have no flavor. But hope is not lost!

Batter was not right! It was impossible to dip the corn nugget. It was still powder. Not sure what I did but I altered the batter and was able to dip by adding one more egg white and a little more milk but the corn made it very watery.

Can honestly say, not a fan.  It is a little time consuming to have to freeze them for hours.  I don't think I will be making them anytime soon.  Going to try the corn fritters and maybe revamp the recipe on them with cornmeal and flour instead of all flour.

When i started off using this recipe i thought there might be something wrong. I believe the egg white and milk were meant to be mixed with the corn. They might have worked a little better that way. Otherwise the recipe didnt turn out very good for me
