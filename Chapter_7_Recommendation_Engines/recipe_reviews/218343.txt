Just for the record -- this is not a traditional Pönnukökur recipe. In Iceland we do not use sour cream or nearly that many eggs. You would need to use a special crepe pan to get the correct thinness (that is key for authenticity). We also do not typically serve it rolled with brown sugar, or icing sugar but it is traditionally served either  regular granulated sugar in the middle and rolled up(for the kids) or with jam and whipped cream, then folded into triangles (served at get-togethers w/coffee). While this recipe is delicious, it is not the same as Icelandic Pönnukökur. A more traditional recipe is more like:
2 c flour, 1 tbsp sugar, 1/8 tsp baking soda, 2 eggs, 1-2 tsp cardamom (or vanilla) 3/4 c margarine (melted) and milk added until it has a somewhat runny consistency. A good Pönnukökur pan is passed down from generations from mother to daughter and is already well "seasoned". If you are starting out with a new one, you may have to go through several pancakes before it forms well. Melt butter on the pan and add to batter before frying. The thinner you can get the pancake to fry without falling apart, or with holes, the more admiration you get ;)

I live at a high altitude so I added quite a bit of water to these to thin them out... I also have a curse of my pancakes being think no matter what I do, but they were still delicious! Served with the sugars as suggested and some fresh blueberries.

YUM!  Very easy to make.  Set out a choice of fruit fillings and there will not be an unhappy person in the bunch.  Kids find these special for some reason.

This is delicious, and very easy to make! We just ate it with some maple syrup. Kind of like a crepe, but very nice flavor. Thanks!

I looked this up after seeing someone mention this on tv and I'm really glad I did. I followed the basic recipe (after re-calculating to 6 servings, which made about 10 12-inch pancakes), although I did add a bit more vanilla, 2T of sugar, and some nutmeg as they did on tv. We ate them for breakfast with fresh strawberries & some strawberry preserves on the side. Yummy!
