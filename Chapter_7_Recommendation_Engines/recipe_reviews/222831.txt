Wow...just wow!  I don't have a grill, so I sliced the zucchini (and a yellow squash I had) into "planks" and lined them up on an oiled cookie sheet.  Then I topped it with my toppings - tomato sauce, green and yellow bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, mushrooms, and red onion.  Then I sprinkled it with feta cheese (all I had on hand) and some grated mozzarella.  Sprinkled the whole thing with salt and pepper, then oregano, and tossed it in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350.  Sprinkled some basil on top and parmesan cheese when it came out and it was absolutely divine.  What a great way to use summer veggies.  Tasty and pretty.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Sliced them 1/4 inch thin, put them on a baking sheet and into a 400 oven for about 12 minutes.  May try a higher temperature next time, but these were delightful!

I recently stopped eating meat and wheat, and this was the perfect substitute for a good pizza! Can make with any sort of topping! It was so quick and simple, will sure to be a favorite around here!

Oh my god these are amazing! I can't eat gluten anymore and never thought I would find a substitute that was equally satisfying. The only thing I did differently is slice the zucchini into long planks and bake them at 400 for about 10 minutes instead of grilling (I don't really understand how they wouldn't fall apart on the grill since the ingredients were all precariously balanced on the raw zucchini). Also used feta because that's what I had. Could not be more thrilled to find this recipe!

A guilt free tasty pizza!!! I added chourico for some meatiness, since I am not a vegetarian but am trying to eat low carb. I baked it at 400 for 12 minutes, then a couple minutes on broil. The goat cheese is amazing. Thanks so much for a great recipe! This is a keeper.

Layered the sliced zucchini in a baking pan and baked in the oven like a casserole as I was concerned about the toppings making a mess on our BBQ grill. Delicious! Baked at 400F for 30 min.

Had a slightly too large striped zucchini from the garden. Sliced it plank style and used standard pizza toppings. Cooked on gas grill 10 minutes indirect and then 5 min high. YUM!!

This was awesome!  Made according to recipe but without garlic due to family allergic to garlic. Substituted shallots for onions.  I baked in oven at 350 for 20-25 min depending on zucchini thickness.  Once I pulled out of oven sprinkled with Parmesan and fresh basil.   Yum!!!

Good idea! I made this over a wood fire while camping. Sliced the zucchini lengthwise into thirds and topped w/sauce, goat cheese, grilled pineapple, black olives, and grated gruyere.

Excellent dish.   I followed the recipe exactly.  One thing I would do next time is to salt the zucchini prior to adding the toppings.  Also, and this isn't the fault of the recipe, but large zucchini isn't available this year yet so I had to use small ones that I split lengthwise.  I would cook them at least an extra 5 minutes next time.

Great recipe! I followed all directions except had a smaller zucchini, so I cut it lengthwise instead of into circles. Made 4 "slices"

Didn't really measure anything, just made sure each round had every topping, even added some fresh basil on top.  Baked them for about 12 minutes so that the zucchini was still firm and they were excellent!
