My family LOVED this recipe! I was really unsure how it would all turn out (will my kids eat the artichokes?  LOL - I had NOTHING to worry about!) It was WONDERFUL! I let my husband read the recipe and he was floored at how simple it was. This is definitely a keeper and will be served at our house on a regular basis. EXCELLENT!

This was better when I finally found the right boxes of pasta (Lipton brand). My regular grocery store is limited in what they offer. Anyway, I didn't add quite the whole package of peas - I think it is too much with all of them. I used red wine vinegar but I think next time I'll leave it out. I may use white wine instead. I thought the flavor was a little bland and tried a bunch of things to add some flavor. I ended up liking some Old Bay seasoning the best. I would probably use 1/2 teaspoon for the whole recipe. I'll make this again just because it's easy and quick.

Ok - so I cheated and made this with canned peas and skipped the artichokes.....but it still tasted great!  The frozen peas will make it look more appealing, I'm sure.  There were quite a few peas...  *UPDATE* This time I made it with the artichokes (although a smaller jar than called for) and frozen peas (no where near as many as called for due to DH being a veggie-phobe).  It was delicious and my picky twins dug in - although the peas remained on their plates.  ={

The ingredients all sounded so good - I was dying to try it.... but YUCK!  Maybe my expectations were too high.
