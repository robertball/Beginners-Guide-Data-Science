We tried this recipe tonight as we are all big Thai and Indian fans - unfortunately none of us really enjoyed this.  It has too much sauce (perhaps it would be better with a lot of rice?), and none of us really liked the addition of cheese (not a traditional curry ingredient!).

this recipe tasted really delicious, but I had to give it four stars because it really needs some rice to go along with it otherwise there's too much starch. I just added some brown rice to the casserole dish before putting it in the oven and it was great. I will definitely make it again.
