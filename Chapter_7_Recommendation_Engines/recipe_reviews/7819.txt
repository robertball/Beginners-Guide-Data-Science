I have made this cake many many times and it has been great.  Last Xmas and again this year the cake failed.  It looks like it has too much liquid or butter... the cake was baked until it was completely done but when I cut into it looks greasy.

This is a good cake, but personally, I wanted it to have more character, to be more like a brandy fruit cake.  So I soaked some dried fruits in the brandy, then chopped them up and added them to the batter and used real lemon and orange zest.  After it baked, I also poured two shots of brandy over the top, and two more after I flipped it.  It got raves after that.

This cake is a fragrant delight!  I made a half-recipe, and cooked it in a 6-cup bundt pan for 50 minutes until a toothpick came out clean.  My house smelled like a beautiful flower after I made this cake.  The texture was at once crumby and velvety-moist.  I added a little bit of extra apricot brandy, and I put the full teaspoon of the lemon and orange extracts even though I halved the recipe in all other respects.  I can totally picture someone like Emily Post serving this cake at a 50's dinner party!  I will definitely make it again!

I used yogurt, no sour cream available. Soaked orange flavor cranberries in brandy. Came out great!

In spite of the fact that it never got completely baked in the middle, has a weird swirl in the center, and fell about an inch after I took it out, the flavor is delicious. It is possible that my subbing 2/3 cup thick eggnog and 1/3 cup butterscotch schnappes for the sour cream added too much moisture to the batter. I also added 1/4 t nutmeg.

I just tried this recipe a couple days ago and family and friends quite enjoyed it.  I made some substitutions - I didn't have sour cream, so I used plain yogurt instead, and I didn't have lemon extract so used grated orange rind for the citrus flavour.  I also realized I forgot to put the salt and baking soda, but it didn't seem to affect the cake at all.  I would make this again!
