it was very good.  the only thing i would change is to add 1 or 2 mins on to the first cook.  i omitted the olives.  chopped onions would be good!

these are great ... good for a quick meal or  game time  snack,.... By experimenting I found it tastes better by putting some cheese and the pepperoni ( along with  peppers or other  extras)  on top of the sauce,  under the hot dog as well as on  top
