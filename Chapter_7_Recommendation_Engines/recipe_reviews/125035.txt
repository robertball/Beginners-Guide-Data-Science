Yum!  I added an extra 8 oz. cream cheese, increased the sugar to 1 1/3 c. & added an extra egg (I like SINFULLY rich cheesecakes!) I baked mine for about an hour and 10 minutes since there was extra batter and I cut the sour cream mixture in half (two cups seemed like a LOT) I took this to work with me today and everyone loved it.  Nice easy recipe and very delicious.  Thanks Evonne!

I love pumpkin cheesecake and the idea to put the sour cream topping back in the oven to set is fantastic as it creates another yummy layer. This weekend I tried this recipe with brown sugar instead of white and I thought the flavor was so much better (I also suggest a pinch of ground cloves both in the filling and topping, as well as a tablespoon or so of rum/bourbon in the topping!)

I recently made this pumpkin cheesecake and it is delicious! although, I wasnt too fond of the sour cream topping. I think it was a bit too tart. I would recommend amaretto instead of vanilla to sweeten it up.

This cheesecake was SO good! My sis and I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. We did omit the sour cream topping and served it with whipped cream or reddi whip. So good, five stars! YUM!

This is a wonderful cheesecake recipe.  My husband and my four year old son made this for me for my birthday.  Their product was a little deflated, (it was their first cheesecake) but for as flat as it looked, it was delicious.  I think that the tartness added by the sour cream topping is very balancing.  They used pureed butternut squash from our garden this summer which worked out delightfully.

I made this for my boyfriend's mother on her birthday, and it was a huge hit!  My boyfriend said that he liked it even better than regular pumpkin pie, and he insists that I make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Wonderful! I make this every time around the holiday season. It's always a big hit and gets me more praise than I deserve. I made a few tasty, easy, and healthy modifications. For the crust, I mixed in 1/4 cup oatmeal + 1/4 cup crushed almonds + splash of milk, omitted the sugar, and used chocolate graham crackers. For the filling, I doubled the spices, and used a simple whipped cream spread on top. Use the regular cream cheese, because the low fat and fat free cream cheeses make the cheesecake more likely to crack before it's done. But don't worry too much about cracks, the cream layer on top covers everything. The cheesecake tips on allrecipes are helpful if things don't turn out as expected. Happy Holidays!

this tastes great. I used some pumkin pie seasoning on top of the spices. although, i think it couldve used a bit more, to bring out the pumpkin flavor. 
I was really concerned that the sour cream topping was going to be too thin, but I put it in the fridge over ngiht and it was just as firm as the cheesecake part! 
The topping is quite tart, which is good, it's just different. So expect a little less pumpkin flavor but a yummy rich taste!

This turned out perfectly.  I left off the sour cream topping and piped on some vanilla flavored whipped cream before serving.  It was a hit!  My husband, who is not a huge sweets fan, finished up the leftovers in 2 days!  Everyone raved about it.  Exceptional flavor!

This was wonderfull! However, I did increse the baking time, put a whole cup of sugar in the cake, and four tablespoons of sugar in the topping. I was pleased with the results. I had to use walnuts, (we didn't have pecans)   and also baked the cake when the topping was on for eight minutes.

Made this for my grandson.  It was delicious.  I put it in a 9-inch spring pan as instructed, but I think it would have fit into an 8-inch pan and been thicker and more attractive. 

Delicious.  Will make it again.

I made this over Thanksgiving with a few alterations.  I made it in individual cupcake liners and left off the sour cream topping. It was SO good and a huge hit!  I baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect!

This turned out great, although I did expect it to be more like a cheesecake rather than pumpkin pie, but irregardless was still delicious.  It turned out beautiful as well.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was a HIT!!!  Everyone loved it.  Although I did omit putting the sour cream topping on it.  Instead I just topped with whipped cream and it was delicious!  Great recipe!

I made this recipe for my family in Iowa while visiting. I wasn't able to taste the recipe for myself, but I could tell as I made it that it was going to be delicious, especially with the sweet sour cream topping. I added some pumpkin spice to the crust and sprinkled extra cinnamon on top of the sour cream layer before serving and my family raved over this recipe. A great addition or alternative to pumpkin pie this fall.

I thought it was amazing, although I should say that I add 1/4 tsp of clove.  Even though I wrapped the bottom of the pan with foil, some of the water accidentally splashed into space between the foil and the pan, making for a soggy crust.  I used gingerbread graham crackers (something available in Nov/Dec) and I could tell the flavor was good, but it seemed like there wasn't enough crust.  But again, perhaps that was because it was soggy.  I think the crust from pumpkin cheesecake with ginger snap crust (this site) would be good too.  This cheesecake is exactly like Libby's pumpkin pie, except substituting cream cheese for the evaporated milk.  Everything else is the same, and it's gorgeous.  My husband didn't like it so much though.  But he's also not a huge fan of pumpkin pie.  I can't get enough of it.

Excellent! I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and it turned out just wonderful!!! I made a few alterations, though. I also added a 1/3 tsp of ground cloves to complete the pumpkin pie taste. And I added 2 tbs of flour, to make sure the cheesecake didn't crack in the oven. I cooked it at 325 for 60 minutes and it was just perfect with no cracks. I also edited the frosting because I didn't have enough sour cream: 8oz/half cup of sour cream, 1 and a half cups of powdered sugar, 3 tbs vanilla and a half a packet of vanilla instant pudding. I let te frosting set in the refrigerator for about an hour, as the cheesecake cooled.

great basic pumpkin cheescake. Even my husband who is not a pumpkin fan liked it. It is a very mild pumpkin flavor. Next time I will play around with the amount of pumpkin in it and add a little extra of the spices in the batter. Great recipe though. EDIT: Ok I've perfected this recipe for my family. While a good recipe it was a little mild/bland so I now do the following: I add 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the crust mixture, use 3-8oz packages of cream cheese, 1-16 oz can of pumpkin plus 1/4 cup (the leftover pumpkin freezes well), 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp nutmeg and 3 eggs.

As almost everyone does, I modified this a bit.  I used gingersnap cookies for the crust and I added some cinnamon and brown sugar to the sour cream topping for more flavor, color and sweetness.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe a "5" is because the crust was too greasy and I like a cheesecake crust to be more substantial, and come up the sides of the pan.  I would add about 50% more crumbs to improve the butter ratio.  Also, because I liked the ginger snap taste, next time I would garnish with some cookie crumbs and/or add ginger to the sour cream as well.  The texture and flavor of the filling was excellent though - not too sweet, and light and airy, for a cheesecake.  If you like your cheescakes more dense though - go for a recipe with more cheese.

really good!!  I used half the pumpkin by accident.  Still really good.  Also only had light sour cream.  Probably would have been better with regular fat.

This was a HIT!  Light, fluffy, just the right amount of pumpkin flavor.  I'm not a pumpkin fan, so I thought I'd try this instead of traditional pumpkin pie at thanksgiving and I really enjoyed it!  Will definitely continue making it!

I agree with Karen, I was kind of disapointed.  With all the great reviews I thought it was sure to be a hit but it was just pretty good.  Needed a bit more flavour, the texture and consistency were good though.

For only using 2 bricks of cream cheese, this rose up more than I expected, which was great.  I've never done the sour cream layer before so after reading reviews I added a touch more sugar.  Yum yum, can't wait to have it after Christmas dinner!

Awesome!  I got rave reviews when I made this.  I didn't bother with the topping figuring it would be rich enough.  Only change I made was upped the sugar to 1 1/3 cups & was glad I did.  It didn't make it overly sweet at all, just right!

Great cheesecake! I made this for my wife the first time this past Thanksgiving and she loved it. She even boasted to her friends and some of them have placed orders! However, I used french vanilla blend vanilla extract in the topping and it turned out awesome. Also, I increased the sugar in the filling to 1 Cup. I like a sweet and tart dessert and the extra sugar made it perfect. One for the Recipe Box for sure!

i made this without the sour cream topping so maybe that's why i didn't LOVE it.. but, yeah.. pretty plain. could've used more sugar actually. unless you were going for a very "healthy taste". i added a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling bc thats how i usually like my pumpkin cheesecakes. the texture was very light and airy and almost dissolved the second you put it in your mouth.

I hardly ever bake because I don't really care for sweets(yeah i'm weird), but this was frickin' awesome in my opinion.  And as for the sour cream topping, I think it really makes the cake.  BUT I did add a touch of the nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon to the topping as well to round out the flavor.  DELICIOUS =)

It is only fair that I mention that I do have a huge sweet tooth and usually make very rich and sweet desserts. The texture and presentation of this is wonderful, but if I were to ever make this recipe again I would double the sugar, especially in the sour cream topping, and add more of the spices. My sister suggested that drizzling it with caramel sauce might help. I agree. But if you don't mind only mildly sweet desserts then this would probably be fine for you, for me it just was not even close to sweet enough.

One word-AMAZING ! I really love pumpkin, and who doesn't like cheescake?? Its perfect! I made some changes for my personal preference and from other users reviews. I used brown sugar instead of white in the filling (like one user), but I used white in the sour cream topping. I also used a few good shakes of cloves in the filling, and i added cloves and ginger to the topping to jazz it up some. For the topping, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of sour cream instead of 2, i used about 6 tbs. of white sugar instead of 2 tbs., and i finally added Frangelico Hazelnut Liquer instead of vanilla because i think it tastes so much better in desserts like these (and I added 2 tsp. of that.) But, this is just how i experimented with my personal tastes; and it came out wonderful.Maybe a little soft in the middle, but hey, it doesn't bother me! Very good! Loved it! Thanks.  :)

I hate pumpkin pie, but this is a GREAT alternative!  It's DELICIOUS...with a few changes.  For the crust, I used about 2 tbsp sugar instead of just 1.  For the filling, I used 1 cup of sugar instead of just 3/4 cup, and I only used about 1/3 of a can of pumpkin.  The first time I made it with a full can and the pumpkin taste was just too strong for me, but if you like pumpkin pie, maybe you would like the entire can of pumpkin in there.  Last, I did not do the topping...just used Cool Whip and it was delicious!

So good and SOOO rich! Made it for christmas yesterday was a hit. Turned out perfect. Used a springform pan, no water bath or anything. After cooking time, I let the cheesecake sit in the oven with the door open for 1 hour, then I cooled on a rack in kitchen for 1.5 hours, then fridge overnight. Served it for dinner next day. It set perfectly!

Really loved the recipe, great flavor and appearance! Everyone raved! Omitted the sour cream topping, added a little pumpkin pie spice, and allspice. Took the advice on the tips page and did use the water bath method and allowed to cool a full hour in the over. Overall, very happy with my first cheese cake experience! Thanks so much guys!

I added the extra brick of cream cheese and the extra egg and sugar as some suggested- so delicious! I also omitted the sour cream topping and used whip cream and a butterscotch sundae sauce on top for a bit of stickiness- I also used the shortbread crust recipe found in this site- made it a little bit more elegant

Great flavor!  The only addition I made was 2 tsp. of flour and cook it at a lower temperature for a bit longer as mine came out not quite done in the center, but still delicious!  Also, I was unable to add the sour cream topping because my cheesecake filled the whole springform pan.

This recipe was a huge success.  I made it for an Autumn holiday party, only all organic.  The only thing I added was MORE Ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I may add more cream cheese in the future, and I want to try doing a pecan/graham crust next time too.  Overall, a great start recipe.

I looove Cheesecake! But I'm not a huge fan of Pumpkin Pie...so I thought this was a great solution!! So I didn't add all the pumpkin suggested. And I added Bourbon to the Sour Cream topping. It was Awesome! I brought some to work and the ladies went nuts! It will be cooked next week for Thanksgiving! Thanks!!

I've been making this cheese cake for the past 3 Thanksgivings and Christmases.  Everyone loves it.  The sour cream topping weirded everyone out the first time, so as requested, I left it off the second time and everyone asked for it back.  It really does add something that cool whip doesn't.  My one big mistake with this recipe was sharing it with friends that don't normally come to dinner.  Now I have to triple it so I have enough for everyone, and I get 2 turkey dinners per holiday instead of just one!

The flavor was great, however the consistancy was not as firm as I would have liked. I also left off the sour cream topping in favor of a new york style cheese cake recipe for the top layer. I would possibly increas baking time or add more cream cheese to get the "cheesecake" texture. My husband loved it!!

This was awesome! I left out the sour cream topping after reading other users comments about it being too tangy for the pumpkin cheesecake.  I used 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  The pumpkin flavor was definitely the most noticeable, with the cheesecake flavor taking a backseat.  This was a great alternative to pumpkin pie. Oh, and I topped it with pumpkin whipped cream (regular recipe for whipped cream with 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice).

My mom made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was wonderful. I made it 2 weeks later for a Christmas party. Always trying to save time, I used a premade graham cracker pie crust and halved the recipe. It turned out perfect. I am not a fan of pumpkin generally, but I love, love this recipe.

Holy Smokes is this ever good! Came out PERFECTLY. Internal temp. for doneness is 150. I had to look this up because this was my 1st cheesecake and I had it in for an hour and it still didn't "look done" AND I used a premade graham cracker crust. Tip: Baking a cheesecake past 160 will cause it to crack. I pulled it at 150 and let it sit overnight in the fridge and it was super, super good. Fancy stuff here! Doesn't really need the sour cream topping but my daughter sure slurped that stuff up. I did not use nuts and only had "pumpkin spice". I stopped when it smelled like a pumpkin pie. Thanks for this recipe.

I hadn't made a cheesecake in years, and decided to try this one.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.   My guests raved about it, and the recipe was passed on.

Finally - a cheesecake that didn't fall within a half hour of taking it out of the oven. I used another reviewers suggestion and opted for Amaretto in the topping instead of vanilla - it was wonderful.  I also mixed about 1/2 cup of ground pecans in the crust. Many compliments on Thanksgiving!

Yum. I made this cheesecake once before Thanksgiving usuing the original recipe,a nd it was good but something about the consistency was a little off for me. So I tried again using the suggestions of using 3 cream cheeses, more butter, and an extra egg. I also cut back the sour cream topping and it was PERFECT! I was so disappointed that we didn't have any left over, but I'm so glad everyone enjoyed it!!!

However I did not use the topping. 
Instead I sprinkled Crushed pecans on the top.

This recipe is great and for the last couple years I've been making it with fresh pumpkin, we paint our pumpkins at Halloween so unless they freeze our pumpkin is still good at Thanksgiving. So at Thanksgiving we cut up and cook our painted pumpkin or as much of it we need and boil it  and mash it like potatoes. We had enough this year to make 5 of these so we made 2 for Thanksgiving and 2 for Christmas, the coloring is lighter but it tastes great. I made a couple changes to it, instead of nutmeg ginger and cinnamon I use 1 1/8 teaspoons of pumpkin spice and all spice. I also use the crust recipe from Chantal's New York Cheesecake with double butter. Other than that this recipe is perfect.

I've made this twice now without the sour cream topping and everyone loves loves loves this cheesecake. The pumpkin is subtle so if you have a cheesecake fan who isn't a pumpkin fan he or she might even like it if you can convince him or her to try it, like my aunt did.

I double-checked the recipe to see if I did something wrong because although this cheesecake was ok, it did not get 4 or 5 stars from anyone who tried it.  As I said it was just ok.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone really liked it.  Mine cracked but this was my first cheesecake and I think I had it in the oven a little too long and that may be why it cracked.  I ran out of time and so just used cool whip for the topping.  Next time I hope to keep it from cracking and try the sour cream topping.

This is a great recipe.  I however did not use the topping.  That is a personal decision based on the fact I amnot a big fan of sour cream flavored topping.  It was very easy to make and IT NEVER FELL!!

Excellent recipe for simple, tradiional cheesecake! I served the sour cream topping on the side, along with cool whip because I like plain cheesecake by itself with nothing on it. Thanks

I'm not a big cheesecake or pumpkin pie fan but enjoyed the combination of flavors. My husband loves cheesecake but when asked commented that it was a bit dry. The sour cream topping was good but I think a powdered sugar/cream cheese/vanilla/whipped cream topping would be better.

This was an absolutely delicious simple cheesecake.  I am normally not a cheesecake lover but this one was perfect.  It was neither too rich or too sweet and the slight tartness from the sour cream topping compliments the cheesecake filling nicely.  I added a little more sugar to the sour cream and just a little less ginger to the filling.  It also makes a beautiful presentation.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Why do I keep trying alternatives to pumpkin pie when nothing is really as good as the real thing?  This recipe is just fine, but mainly it just made me want to make a plain cheesecake and a pumpkin pie separately and have a slice of each.  If I did make this again, I would follow the previous reviewer's suggestion of adding an extra block of cream cheese and cutting the topping in half or skipping it altogether.

I have just made this cheesecake for the Thanksgiving party and it was delicious and a huge hit with the crowd! What sold me on the recipe was the picture with the pecans laid around the cake's edge. What I found out is that it tastes just as great as it looks! Thanks for sharing!
