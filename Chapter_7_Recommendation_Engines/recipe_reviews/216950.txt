Just tried this tonight.  Really very good.  I did modify the recipe a little and used vegetable broth instead of water for a richer flavor.  I've been looking for more nutritious, lower calorie recipes, and this really fits the bill.  We had this soup with fresh pitas and red pepper hummus for a nice light supper.  

Thanks for posting it!  Will definitely make again.

This soup does come out a little bland and there is far more olive oil than needed.  I put the cauliflower in a bowl with garlic cloves, sprayed it and added salt, pepper and some curry powder before roasting.  Then instead of frying onions in oil, I boiled onions, celery and a carrot in vegetable broth.  After that was mainly cooked, I added the roasted cauliflower to the broth for about 10 more minutes to make sure that it was well cooked for blending.  

Added a wee bit of cheddar to each bowl when serving. Yummy.

It doesn't hurt to boil veggies in water, if you are going to eat the water too!!

This is a great recipe as-is. As originally created it is wonderful but a little bland for my taste, so  I did modify the recipe a little to my likes, I added 1 yellow bell pepper, I used white pepper vs black pepper for appearance purposes and I like the taste better of white pepper. I also added some curry powder and celery salt. Instead of using chicken stock I used the water and added chicken granules for the basic same effect. I also added some fried tofu garnishes as well. This put the soup over the top in my book.

I love the base for this recipe and added my touches to make it a little heartier.  
I added broccoli and carrots along with onions and garlic to chicken broth, instead of water.
I'm a garlic lover, so I used garlic in both the broth and the roasted cauliflower.  Once everything was cooked, I saved about 1/3 of the veggies, pureed the rest, chopped the saved veggies and added it to the puree.  Tasty. :)

This was delicious! I didn't use the olive oil and it was still excellent. Adding curry powder, celery salt and using chicken broth instead of water worked magic. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fabulous!  I tossed the cauliflower with good olive oil (instead of spray) and added a red pepper and sautéed it with the onion. I had only one head of cauliflower but added 4 cups of water instead of 3. It was still creamy and tasty. Wow! Thanks for a new favorite recipe! I didn't feel the need to jazz up the recipe with other ingredients. I guess some might not appreciate the subtlety of the favors, but I did and I would definitely not want to change that!

Even with the flavorful substitution of seasoned homemade chicken stock instead of water, I found this soup to lacking in flavor.  Another reviewer mentioned adding curry and that might have just been the ticket to a tastier soup.   I love roasted cauliflower and thought that roasting the cauliflower would bring out a tantalizing nutty flavor.  I did not use olive oil cooking spray but sprayed the cauliflower with pure olive oil before roasting.   Being of the “more is better” school of thought when it comes to garlic, I used more than four cloves.  I roasted them whole with the cauliflower and perhaps sautéing them with the onion as the recipe directed instead of roasting would have boosted the flavor.  The soup was best the day after it was made and gets an extra star for being healthy!

A very good basic recipie from which to develop your own personal favorite.  For example I use 2/3 cauliflower and 1/3 brocolli. I broil them on low for 30 to 45 minutes to let the sugars carmelize which gives more depth of flavor.   Consider replacing the onion with sliced carrots (also broiled).  I like southwestern flavors so add a dash of cumin and a drop of tobasco.  To each his/her own!

I wanted a recipe for my 8 month old son who is not a fan of the single vegetable puree's anymore. This was perfect! I cut the recipe in half, added a yellow bell pepper as some of the other comments suggested and added a dash of curry powder. My son loved it and I liked it too. It freezes well for easy meals.

The soup gets two stars for fast and easy prep as well as its healthiness. I thought it was very bland and my husband complained that it was slightly bitter. I also found the texture to be almost a little greasy feeling on my tongue. I am sure with a few changes it would be tasty, but I don't have that time. We won't be making this again.

I tried this recipe and love the taste of the roasted cauliflower and low-calorie, creaminess of it. Like the other reviewers I found it bland, so I added portobello mushrooms cooked in chicken stock and a dab of butter, with a couple of tablespoons of red wine. Rather than water I added organic chicken stock. One hint for soup makers, is that I make a seasoning base using one green paper, one large onion, 7 cloves of garlic (water,olive oil, or tomato paste to blend)blend well freeze it and then use a couple of tablespoons in your soups. I also make another version using cilantro and add it to my pumpkin soup. I recommend cooking it with olive oil, since it were frozen raw.

It was delicious- perfect! Just what I was looking for. VERY SIMPLE to make and tastes just like a cream of potato soup! I sprinkle bacon bits on the top of each serving.

Very good with alterations. I read the comments about it being bland, so I added some spices.i used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4.  I added parsley, cumin, garlic salt, curry, a pinch of ginger, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I added mushrooms to the onion and 3 beef flavor cubes to the water. Very, Very, delicious! Will be doing again.

The version I made was awesome....will make again in the near future.  I took the suggestions in the reviews and altered the recipe slightly.  

I replaced the water with chicken soup stop.  I replaced 1/3 of the cauliflower with 4 chopped carrots and a red pepper(sliced in half...peeled after roasting).  I roasted them all.  

Then I added a big pinch of each of the following spices:  Cumin, Parsley, Curry powder and Cayenne.  Creamy, buttery...delicious!

This tasted VERY good, and was surprisingly very filling despite the fact that it only contained cauliflower, onions, and garlic. 10/10 :)

This recipe is fantastic as a base!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and spiced it up a bit using turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper.  I also used veggie broth instead of water.  This soup is AMAZING, and guilt free.  Follow these substitutes and you'll be happy!

I made this soup and it was delicious! I’m guilty of never being able to  follow a recipe so naturally I made a few changes: 
-I sautéed garlic and celery with the onion
-I roasted Brussels sprouts as well
-I added Cremini mushrooms to the soup 
-I added Parmesan and parsley as a garnish
-I also added cayenne pepper for some heat 
I realize my palate is unique and my cooking style is unorthodox, but it worked for me. Hope you enjoy it as is or after you make it your own!
Bon appetit.

I am not a cook by nature so all things that I try must be simple. This was simple and delicious. I didnt have an immersion blender so I used a hand mixer to get it to a lumpy chunky state then poured it in our blender a batch at a time and mashed the cream button. It turned out perfect. It makes me feel happy when I eat it :) Also I used half vegetable stock (because that was all I had on hand) and half water.

It comes out extremely creamy, so the consistency is great, but the taste is pretty bland. I added extra garlic the next time that I made it, and used low sodium vegetable broth and curry to zing it up a bit.

I completely abused this recipe because I'm moving and trying to use up all my fresh ingredients. So I didn''t buy onions or garlic for this...I used garlic powder, onion powder,  1/4 tsp of salt  (for half the recipe), and lots of black pepper. Instead of using spray olive oil, I tossed the cauliflower in part olive oil, part canola oil before roasting. (I didn't have a full quarter cup of olive oil.) This still came out really nice. Surprisingly buttery even though there's no butter in it. It would be better with fresh aromatics. I'll make this again.

I used 1 bag of organic frozen cauliflower and used half the liquid. Turned out great.  I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave, drained it, then roasted.  It only took about 15 mins to roast.  I also added mushrooms and green onions to the olive oil.  Like others have done, I strained the onions and mushrooms before pureeing the cauliflower and broth.  For the broth, I used 1 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups organic miso broth. Once well mixed, I returned the vegetables to the soup. It was amazing.

We loved it after following other's suggestions.  I fried 6 pcs of bacon with the onion and a small head of cabbage.  I, also, added 1 tsp. of cumin and did use 4 cups of chicken broth and only 1 cup of water..  It was great with these changes; but would have been bland without additional salt, pepper and above things.  Great base and thanks for submitting; I am always looking for new healthy soups.

After reading a couple of reviews I used vegetable broth in place of the water and cooked the rest per the recipe. I found this to be a little bland but with a few drops of hot sauce it was great.

Delicious and easy to make! I used my Vitamix to mix it and it turned out great. Instead of 6 cups of water, I did 2 cups of water and 2 cups of vegetable stock. Perfect! You can also use extra vegetable stock instead of the olive oil to sauté the onion.

Following the other commenter's advice, I added a tablespoon of curry powder and a tablespoon of better than boullion chicken and it turned out excellent!

Loved the recipe.  I roast cauliflower all the time but always wanted to do a soup.  I modified, using chicken broth, water and a tablespoon or two of cream, and spiced it up by adding a pinch of saffron and some curry powder (for a two head recipe I'd use 2-3 tsp of curry).

I never review a recipe without making it the original way at least once.  So the original recipe only got 4 stars.  But then I added a few sliced of bacon (sliced into 1/2 in pieces then fried with onions)2 carrots and chicken stock in place of the water.  This improved the flavor immensely.

A great way to cook cauliflower.  The garlic started to burn before the cauliflower was done. It was good, though.

Used the big container of chicken broth instead.  Accidently added too much white pepper.  Delicious!  Next time will save some of the cauliflower and add back in at the end just for texture.  One kid loved it, one kid hated it though.

This does make a wonderful creamy soup. However, the flavor just wasn't there. I added some other pureed roasted vegetables (carrots, parsnip, and onion) as others suggested. Adding thyme, curry, a dash of garam masala and sherry finally brought the flavor we were looking for.

This was great after I added altered it a bit. I added 2 veggie bullion cubes, a cup of diced carrots that I sautéed with the onions and garlic and added a garlic powder and a few dashes of ground turmeric to taste. I also added more ground pepper and salt after I blended till smooth on pulse and it was perfection. Smooth creamy and buttery even though there isn't butter. Great gluten free and vegetarian recipe. You could also add bacon or ham to this and I think it would be even better. It would also be good to garnish a pork chop. made enough for 5 days of lunches if you're into meal prepping.

Spritzed 2 heads worth of cauliflower florets with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. Roasted at 425F for 20 minutes. Sauteed 2 medium onions in a tablespoon of olive oil until translucent. Added 4 cloves of garlic (minced), 4 cups chicken broth, and the roasted cauliflower to soup pot. Boiled until everything was completely tender. Blended and ate. Family loved it!!!

This soup is insanely delicious, and everyone can eat it! It’s vegan, gluten free, and you can reduce the amount of salt to make it low sodium. I love this soup so much. It tastes like a thick gravy, but there’s no dairy or flour... and it’s a simple recipe to follow, double bonus!

I'm on a diet and I was looking for a low calorie filling soup. Bingo! This is a very satisfying dish. It is actually a meal replacement. I did make a few small changes. I roasted the cauliflower at 425deg instead of broiling it and I accidentally added a lot of cayenne pepper thinking it was curry. Oops! Good thing I like spicy. I did end up adding some curry too. I'll be making this again even after my diet.

I used chicken broth instead of water.  It made the soup a light tan color and a nice flavor that complemented the cauliflower nicely.

Made this for my daughter-in-law after she came home from having her first baby.  She loved it and it was easy for her to heat up quickly.  It's great that there's no cream in this recipe either since she is lactose intolerant.  Instead of adding six cups of water, I used four cups of low sodium chicken broth and two cups of water.  Excellent flavor!

Based on the reviews I made a few changes to spice it up.  I included a roasted yellow pepper and carrots and blended all of it together.  I also used vegetable broth instead of water and curry powder.  I added green onions on top.  I like it but feel like it still needs more fiddling with to bring out more flavor.

I added my homemade veggie stock as suggested and the flavor was good, the texture was off-putting.  It was not smooth and silky like a butternut quash soup. I attribute this to the texture of the cauliflower.  After eating half of it the rest went into the trash.

I made this soup and added some jalapeno's.  Mine did not look like the photo, as it didn't blend to a smoothness and it was more white and not yellow.   It was kind of creamy but still had pieces of the cauliflower in it.  It was tasty to my surprise. Not sure i will ever made it again.

I loved this recipe even though I did things a little differently. I wanted this to last more than one day so after reading a few reviews, I kept the tomato’s, avocado and dressing in desperate containers and added them to my plate when ready to eat. Instead of using green onions, I used a red onion. I ate this on a bed of spinach but it was also good alone.

This recipe was extremely bland, but it made a great base to add tons of spices to! In the future, here is what I would do:
- Use chicken or veggie broth instead of water. I put in about a teaspoon of chicken boullion after I did the blending, and this added so much flavor.
- Lots and lots of salt. I ate mine with some saltines and it was very yummy, but if you're going solo without crackers I would recommend adding more salt than you think you'll need.
- About a 1/2-1 teaspoon of curry powder made it magical
- I also put in a few shakes of my favorite general seasoning powder--21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joe's. This stuff is mostly black pepper, onion, celery seed, and a bunch of other spices that add some complexity. I'm sure Mrs. Dash or any other seasoning blend you enjoy would work as well!
- Bacon also makes everything better--I didn't have any on hand this time, but I definitely will next time! It would be so delicious!

Excellent soup ! I modified this recipe just a bit, I used vegetable stock instead of water and put in 1 tlb of fresh thyme and a pinch of cayenne pepper . I did not boil cauliflower before roasting in 400 degree oven , i let it simmer for a few mins in the stock after roasting.

I loved it, however I am mostly looking for good gluten and dairy free recipes that my six year old son likes and this one didn't cut it for that. I used it as more of a stew type thing and ate it over rice. I really enjoyed it

This ended up being really yummy. I used 4cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups water and did NOT pre soak the cauliflower in salt water. I also used real olive oil in place of spray. I was pleasantly surprised!

Silly me did not read the entire recipe before starting, and when I got to the part about using the submersible hand mixer I knew I was in trouble.  However, I used a potato masher and did the best I could and although not creamy and smooth, my husband and I both loved the soup.  Will make it again.

Amazing flavor and consistency. I roasted the cauliflower at 400 degrees for half an hour. I used roasted chicken broth instead of water. This soup is amazing! It is giving roasted buttercup squash soup a run for its money!

Super easy to make. Enjoyed the recipe as is the night I made it but enjoyed it even more when we doctored up the leftover soup with curry powder, celery salt, dry mustard and shredded cheddar cheese. My husband insisted on the additions when we had it 2 days later. Will definitely make it again with the changes.

The roasted cauliflower was fantastic -  2 stars awarded for that alone.    Making this soup to recipe though was a mistake - too watery & too bland

If I were to ever attempt this again I would cut the liquid by 1 cup or add a 3rd cauliflower.   Switching from water to vegetable broth may also help with the flavor but it would make a much darker soup

Delicious, thick and creamy.  I did check other reviews so added some savory spice and celery salt ...less olive oil though.  I did use vegetable broth instead of water and added 1/4 cup of cream with shredded cheese to top it off. This is a great low carb choice.

Great basic recipe!  I limited the olive oil, used vegetable broth instead of water, and added a lot more salt and pepper.  However, with these modifications, the soup was amazing.  For my daughter and husband, I added toasted baguette slices and a little grated asiago.  They both loved -- and my daughter is 8, so this is high praise!

I've made this and another version twice now.   The first couple of bites are good, but get's boring after that.   I tried sprucing it up but I just feel cauliflower lacks in flavor too much on it's own.   Tried a mushroom/cauli blend and enjoyed that more but still probably won't make again

I really enjoyed this soup. I used chicken broth in place of some of the water and, after tasting it, threw in some chili pepper flakes. When I poured some into a bowl I laid some sliced Havarti cheese on top. Very nice!

Good recipe, from what everyone says, it needs something extra. I used vegetable broth, 2x onions, and deglazed the onions with wine and balsamic. Served with garlic pita.

I ended up following the most helpful critical review, and added curry powder to the roasting oil and added some more vegetables to the soup. 

I cut up some garlic, a carrot, a few stalks of celery, and the onion and threw it into the broth (which I substituted in place of water) on the stove to simmer while I prepped and roasted the cauliflower. 

The only thing I wish I'd done is reserved some of the super delicious roasted cauliflower pieces to throw back on top of the soup after dishing it out. It was super velvety and creamy but ended up with a texture a bit too much like delicious, warm and savory baby food for me. I added croutons in a last ditch effort to add a bit of texture back in.

The cauliflower  burned a little so the color wasn't that pretty golden in the photo. It was a little bland; could use salt or more seasoning, but not sure which.

I made a few changes based on other reviews, but the base recipe was a great start. I didn't have 2 heads of cauliflower so I used one with a head of broccoli. I added 3 chicken bullion cubes with the water and a seeded and sliced jalapeno pepper into the soup mix. I let the soup cool for 20 minutes and mixed it in a regular blender. It tasted great. Thick and creamy. I could barely taste the jalapeno, but it gave it a tiny zip.

Based on other reviews, I used vegetable broth instead of water for added flavor. I also doubled the garlic.  I used regular sea salt, alderwood smoked salt , and  smoked paprika to finish it. 
Flavor was good but I couldn't get the texture to be smooth as the photo despite using the immersion blender.  I will make again though and try using a food processor for consistency purposes.

Yummy and perfect for those of use that can't tolerate cream. I did use broth and a little curry when toasting the cauliflower per someone's suggestion.

Loved it. Tasted like a heavy potato soup, but healthier with so few calories. I only had 1 head of cauliflower, but kept the proportions of the rest of the recipe, and cut the water to 5 cups. I added a decent amount of fresh ground pepper, salt, and red pepper flake. I don't have an immersion blender so I scooped most of the vegetables out and puréed them in a vitamix, then threw the blend back in the pot. It was nice having some whole pieces left behind to add texture. Will be making again!

As another post mentions, it's amazing how much flavor is in this soup with such few ingredients.  I had some extra broccoli laying around, so during the last 5-10 minutes of boiling I added the broccoli florets.   I used less olive oil than this uses, probably closer to 2 tablespoons.  I also used some good organic veggie stock instead of water.  I've seen other recipes with butter and cream and they just aren't needed here.  Tasty, healthy and filling!

After reading other reviews, I made some changes. I roasted garlic cloves along with the cauliflower, sauteed chopped celery, carrots, more garlic and onion, used vegetable broth base and added turmeric and cumin. It was delicious!

I do not like cooking, and running a bible study for a few weeks needed soups that were easy to put together.  This one is such a soup, easy indigents I usually have on hand. So I give it two stars for simplicity, but one star for taste.  It is bland, and I love bland, but even for me, it was too bland.  I added fresh parsley, hot pepper flakes (which is about all the hotness I can take), and fresh ginger. Kind of added a little pick-up but I don't think I'll make it again, really no taste.

Give it 3 stars as a base for making soup - definitely not a stand alone recipe IMO, much too bland to serve as is - made substantial changes.  Cut Olive Oil to approx 1 t bs.  Roasted cauliflower with a spicy seasoning mix of my own recipe.  Added bell peppers 1/2 each green, red and yellow to onion.  Used 1 tbs granulated garlic powder instead of cloves, added 1 tsp curry powder.  Used 1 box of low sodium chicken stock plus approx 1 cup water.  Served with a substantial helping (didn't measure) of sharp cheddar cheese mixed in and the result was excellent.

This was really bland. Tried pepping it up with vegetable broth, half a yellow pepper, hot sauce, curry.  Nothing really made it great.  In the end I melted cheddar cheese over it in order to avoid wasting the ingredients.

It was simple, quick , nutritious and delicious. Thanks for sharing this.

I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time I make it. People have said this is bland. I disagree. The flavor is in the nicely browned cauliflower. The char and umami really shine if you get it good and brown. I had to roast way longer than they said to get this but it was well worth the time.

Really good recipe! I tossed the florets in oil as others have mentioned, and used chicken broth. I also added dried thyme leaves (~1t) and enough ground pepper to add a little heat to the soup. Delish!

Pretty simple and really creamy and delicious. I added 1-2 dashes of curry powder, garam masala, soy sauce, worcestershire, and 1/3 dried habanero pepper. I felt like it was still missing a little something, so I splashed a little balsamic in my bowl and it was delicious!! Tasted deliciously creamy even though it didn't have any dairy.

I used chicken broth instead of water.  Also added two table spoons of curry with a good dose of salt and pepper.  When sautéd the onions/ oil, I added a tablespoon of butter.  To top off the dish I sprinkled shredded cheese and fresh cilantro.  It turned out great (even though I changed it around for more flavor).

This was amazing!  We're on the Daniel diet for a week and I didn't have any idea what we'd eat - no bread, no dairy, no meat... We will add this to our regular non-diet diet. It was so good.

I chopped and cooked one head of cauliflower on the stove in some olive oil. I added it to the onion, garlic, pepper, and 4 cups chicken stock. I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped celery  as well as some leftover quinoa from the night before and creamed it altogether with a whisk. It was hearty and flavorful! Loved it.

For me, the flavor was extremely bland without adjusting the recipe.  I tried adding basil, parsley, green peppers and celery seed to add flavor, without success.  I finally added cumin and chicken bullion as suggested by other reviewers.  The cumin and chicken bullion really add flavor to the recipe.  I may try the recipe again with homemade chicken broth.  The recipe seems like a good starting point but requires some tweaking to get past bland.

LOVE this recipe. It's very simple , I did add a good amount of Paprika to it while simmering, along with celery salt and a pinch of garlic powder. Other then that I followed the recipe and it was delicious. Definitely worth making again.
