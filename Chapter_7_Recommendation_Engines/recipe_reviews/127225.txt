Very easy, and delicious!  Used pecans instead of almonds.

Yummy!  I had 4 oz of fat free cream cheese that I needed to use up, and I found this recipe, which I cut in half and put in an 8x8 pan.  It was really easy and quick.  I used a processor to mix the crust ingredients, and again to mix the cream cheese (b/c I didn't soften it) with the sugar.

I made this into a decadent chocolate dessert by making a chocolate creme oreo cookie crust and used chocolate fudge pudding and chocolate whip topping.  And then sprinkled crushed oreos on top - my husband couldn't stop eating it!

This receipe is good but the crust need to be more firm.  The cream cheese mixture can be doubled to make it a bigger dessert.  I do not recommend doubling this recipe.

Very good and refreshing, and wouldn't know that the pudding and cool whip were sugar free!  I had a little trouble with the crust, but it was still delicious!

Love this recipe! Mom made it for me growing up and now I make it for my family. :) One fun tip: use different flavors of pudding! It's great with pistachio pudding...and for baby showers I host, I use vanilla pudding and then use food coloring to make it blue or pink depending on the sex of the baby. It's a great, fun "themed" dessert!!
