I've been making Pizzelles for more than 20 years. Storage is the Biggest Issue! Around Christmas, huge humidity issues ... I store my pizzelles in a glass Jar with those little "stay-fresh Silica Gel capsules that come in vitamin/medicine jars & also new shoe boxes". (What a HUGE difference!!!! BEWARE: if you have children that can access cookies, put them high up so they cant access the little chemical packs". Especially helpful for large batches... not that they last very long at all....

No you can't use a wafflle iron!  Butter makes the difference and makes them crisp. Anise oil, lemon oil et. is much better than he extracts in these flavors.  Also, add lemon zest or orange zest to the batter.  I've never heard of using Anise seeds in these...I wouldn't like that and as far as I know th anise oil is authentic not the seeds.

Finally a recipe for Pizzelles that calls for anise oil!  I had one long ago, but lost the recipe.  Thank you so much for posting it.  The anise oil gives a more intense flavor of anise to the cookie, much better than anise extract which is more commonly found.  Love it, Love it, Love it!

This is a great recipe!  Of course you don't HAVE to use anise oil, but why wouldn't you if you really want a good anise flavor!  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

This is my favorite pizzelle recipe as I find that they ship w/o a lot of breakage when when you don't use any butter. I use canola oil. A while back, I bought A LOT of anise extract on sale; I just use twice as much in place of the anise oil. Yum....
