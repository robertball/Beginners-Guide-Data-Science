I just made these for a cookie exchange, and they turned out great!  I had to make 6 doz., so after the first batch I made a few changes.  Instead of putting them in a 13x9 in. pan I used a cookie sheet lined with tinfoil and sprayed with cooking spray.  This made the bars thinner and more like bars than a cake consistency.  I also used a glaze made from powdered sugar instead of just sifting them with the sugar.  They are absolutely delicious!

These were so addicting.  I used 3 tsp. almond extract, next time I will use the 2 1/2 tsp.  Put mini chips on top, will skip next time.  The simple almond flavor is plenty, with just the sugar dusted on top.

Love this recipe!

Super quick to put together and the aroma in the house while it's baking is light and enticing.

The batter was so wonderful I was tempted to leave some for my husband to try, but decided against it (raw eggs and all).

I just took dusted them with the confectioners sugar and they look lovely.  They also taste fabulous.  

A previous review said they were too cake-like, but the summary that accompanied the recipe warned of this and so I was not surprised with the texture.  The top of the bars came out with a nicely light crusty sort of texture that only adds to their appeal.

I did add about 1/4 c. extra flour, but that's just because I live in a high altitude climate.  I don't think you'd need to make that adjustment otherwise.

Enjoy!  I sure will be!

I thought these would be much better than they are. I followed the recipe to a "T" but still didn't fall in love with them or their texture. They don't have enough almond flavor, and they dry out very quickly even when stored in a tight container. The second time I added 1 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 c slivered almonds, and 1/2 C finely chopped candied cherries in an attempt to jazz them up but they weren't any better. These are better on the second or third day, as the flavors seems to develop. But after that, they will be too dry. Just didn't live up to my expectations.

Excellent! I can not tell a lie...I did not make these-but my friend brought these to our cookie exchange and we are both avid Allrecipe users. She told me this was the recipe to her lovely cookie bar.
Wonderful. All I can say. More like a dense piece of cake than a cookie-
just wonderful.
My husband scarffed many down....he is one of "those" who can eat and eat and not gain a pound!

Very simple recipe to follow with a great end result.  These are a huge hit with the hubby.  They have a great almond flavor with a dense cake-ish texture.  I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with other extracts, such as Raspberry or Lemon.

You know what makes recipes like this one so nice?!-is not just it's ease and simplicity-but the base for so many nice touches, like fresh raspberries and rasp. sauce w/sliced almonds, or kiwi and chocolate sauce drizzled on top, just to name a few (all that makes it look like you spent forever on this!) Or, you can make the bar and sell 'em quick! Thanks Sandy-we love almonds here and this is quick and tasty (or gourmet..)!

Sorry, but I thought this recipe was disappointing.  It's more like cake, not dense like bars should be, and it really needs a crust of some sort.  I followed the recipe exactly but found the flavor bland. I baked these to take to a cookie party and will be leaving them at home.

I have mixed-feelings about these "bars". They were easy to make and had a nice subtle, buttery, almond flavor, but they were quite sponge-like and fluffy in texture as opposed to a chewy "bar" like I was hoping for. It was really an almond "cake". I won't be making again, which is probably a good thing for my waistline as it calls for a very large amount of butter/sugar/eggs. Thanks anyhow!

Super easy with few ingredients so it's great.   I accidentally cooked it at 350 deg F instead of the recommended 325 and it turned out perfect - then read some other reviews which actually recomended it should be baked at 350 instead of 325.  The almond flavor is perfect and balances well with the butter flavor.  Very easy to cut the bars.  Or cake.  Or bars.  Whatever, they are tasty.  A nice, light, slightly hard crust on top.  They were a big hit at a holiday party.

Amazing flavor.  Mine had a funny crust on the top, but that didn't affect the taste at all.  Will definitely try again!

I am flummoxed by these. I thought they were awful yesterday when I made them. Bland, dry, unpleasant texture and not sweet enough. I put them in the freezer just in case. Today I nibbled on one straight from the freezer and loved it! Soft, sweet, and nutty with an intense bear claw flavor and "chew". ( I added a tsp each of salt and vanilla and a cup of chopped almonds. )

I had my doubts but this is even BETTER then the Scandinavian Almond cookies I make each year.  Instead of powdered sugar though I did use the cookie icing and them top with slivered almonds as I thought it looked better.  NONE left!  darn it... gotta make some more!

Im giving this recipe 5 stars because i loved the texture, sweetness and how simple and quick this recipe was to make. I am truely not an amaretto/ almond flavoring fan AT ALL but i figured i'd try it out because the reciepe was so simple. I WILL definitely make this again but will use flaoring that i like (vanilla, coconut)and try a glaze instead of the sugar on top. THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

For starters, I added in cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg for seasonal taste. With that said, I love them! Great texture and taste. Will most likely make again.

These are really good!  As another viewer suggested I made a glaze out of powdered sugar and poured it over the top.  Yum!  I think I'm going to use them for my neighborhood cookie exchange this year.

These are delicious!  I have made them twice and generously sprinkled the top of the batter with cinnamon and sugar like a snickerdoodle.  Next time I make them I plan to swirl cinnamon throughout for a bigger cinnamon flavor.

These were good, maybe just a tad too sweet.  I loved how easy they were!  I'll make again, and maybe try cutting down on some of the sugar.

I used lemon extract since I didn't have any almond extract on hand and the flavor was great. I also skipped the powdered sugar step because the plain cake was sweet enough by itself.     I know this is a matter of semantics, but I wouldn't call these "bars." I baked mine in a 13x9 inch pan (as written in recipe) and the final product was 1.5 - 2 inches tall. Definitely more like a dense cake than a brownie in my opinion.

These almond bars are wonderful; they remind me of the rich taste of marzipan.  I kept them sealed airtight and they were excellent each of the 3 days that it took us to eat them.  I enjoyed the contrast between the crispy/chewy crust and the moist center of the bars.

I've made 3 batches of Almond Bars so far, and each one has been perfect.  It's a very easy recipe to follow, and it's very flavorful even though it doesn't have a lot of ingredients or complicated steps to follow.  For one batch, I sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of almonds on top of the batter before baking, and it was just the perfect touch (even though the recipe is wonderful as is).  It's definitely a keeper.

I halved the recipe and used a square baking dish (not sure if it is 8" or 9".)  The lovely texture was a perfect base topped with fresh sliced peaches and a dab of fresh whipped cream and got raves from all.  Thank you, Sandy!

Just made these an hour ago. I added more almond extract since I LOVE almond and also sprinkled some chopped almond pieces on top with the powdered sugar. The flavor is amazing, very addicting, although the bars are very 'cakey' and crumbly. Make sure to grease the pan very well! They weren't amazingly extraordinary, but they were very very good.

These were good, but I was expecting more of a dense bar.  They were more cake-like.  I even made mine in a foil-lined cookie sheet that was slightly larger than 13x9.  But they were still a little thick and spongey.  Having said that, they were SUPER moist & really tasty.

So good but you have to be an almond flavor fan.  My husband is not, so he wouldn't even try them.  Maybe I'll try it with vanilla sometime instead (though I love almond).  The best part about these is that there are so few ingredients & they are all something I always have on hand.  Super easy & quick.

Good recipe, easy and fast, so I jazzed it up a bit swirled some raspberry jam as suggested by another reviewer and covered the top with melted chocolate and toasted almond flakes.  Would have been nice without all the additions it is bar like did not see how it came out cakey for some.

My whole family loves this recipe! I followed it to the letter and did not change a thing.  I was looking for something different to take to holiday potlucks and this is it!  The almond flavoring is a pleasant surprise to those who think this is going to be a plain or lemon cake.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast delicious dessert.

Super easy! I altered this recipe some by cutting the finished product into small "bites"/cubes - and then coating in powdered sugar. Just fill a small bowl with the powdered sugar and toss freshly cut bites in - it coats nicely. Makes a great holiday sweet to give to enjoy!

OMG--- What a quicky recipe to make. Super simple. I couldn't wait to let them cool. It is a cake like recipe when warm. I had to have a peice this morning and it now looks more like a bar type . Great flavor---this is akeeper in my book

These bars are AWESOME! I thought I had almond extract, was out, so I used maple extract instead and I simply didn't have enough of them to go around! People said it reminded them of either french toast (why I'm not sure) or maple scones or maple bars. But they're a hit and simple to make. Next time I'll be adding some walnuts or pecans and maybe a quick icing drizzle instead of the powder sugar topping.

One of my new favorites.  These bars were light and cake like but very moist.  Great flavor and just sweet enough.  I found this recipe when looking for new bar recipes.  I work at a camp in the French Alps and multiplied out the recipe to make the bars for 120.  They still turned out great and the campers LOVED them.

My mom makes the same recipe, except she uses a 8x8 inch pan. The bars bake better if you cook them at 350 degrees for the 13x9 inch pan. They took 30 minutes. I love these bars too...they are so simple but one of my favorite treats!

I loved these. I did do a powdered sugar glaze instead. ( 3 tbl milk to 1/2 cup powdered sugar) and it helped keep it moist! I added sliced almonds on top!

This is excellent! I agree that it is more cakey but the taste is great nevertheless. I think next time I will add a little less of almond extract.

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago and I love it.  Hers is just a little different.  On top she sprinkles a small bag of sliced almonds and colored sugar.  They look and taste very festive!!

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  The only thing I sometimes do differently is dribble raspberry jam onto it before baking -- just to add a little something.
Super easy fast and yummy!  And yes, these do tend to have a more "brownie" like texture.

I would classify this as a cake and not a bar.  It was soft and moist but you really needed a fork to eat it.  Had I not sprinkled the top with sliced almonds and sugar I think it would have been a little bland.  I'm happy with the taste but if I make these again I will definately use a Larger pan so it's more of a traditional bar.

Highly addictive! The batter is sooo yummy, my daughter gets upset when I have to pour it in the pan (she is four and has requested this as her birthday cake next year). We have made this many times since I found the recipe.  The only thing I change is I put 
three tsp. of almond extract and then I glaze the bars right after they get out of the oven with a powdered sugar icing.  If you like the taste of almond you will love this recipe!!!

I love this recipe!  It's great for those last minute needs as I always have the ingredients on hand.  People are often surprised by the wonderful almond taste, expecting lemon bars.  They're always a hit!

I cut down the servings but other than that, I followed the recipe without reading the reviews. These are very good and I LOVE the smell. Nice little snack when you craving for something sweet but not too heavy. Definitely will be making these again!

Delicious! Made them and took them to work for a Monday treat. Everyone loved them and they were gone within no time. That means most had seconds because there were a lot of them and not a lot of people work there! :)

I halved the recipe also and used an 8x8 pan.  They took longer than stated to cook, and were still a little bit gooey in the middle.  Taste was good though.  Will make these again maybe in a larger pan.

I halved the recipe, but it didn't taste right.
The texture was a bit odd and the egg flavor was very strong.

This is absolutely delicious. I tried it two different ways. With Almond extract, and with Lemon extract. The lemon was my favorite. I increased the extract to three and a half teaspoons. This makes up very moist and soft. It's definitely a cake rather than a cookie. They lasted over a week in a ziploc bag. They stayed soft. It takes a lot of will power to get them to last that long, though. I will *definitely* make these again. YUM.

I had mixed feelings about this recipe... The taste was good, but a little strong.. the texture was a little strange to me too.  If I were to try this again, I think I would use maybe a little butter flavored shortening to replace some of the butter (to keep it softer) and only use 1 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring.  It WAS quick and easy... points for that... and it was a quick fix for a sweet tooth attack, with all ingredients easily on hand.  All in all, next time I would probably just make something else, though...

These are absolutely delicious (and easy)! I love marzipan and almonds and these have a wonderful almond taste and texture is perfect. I only hope I can keep avoid eating them before Christmas. Thanks for a wonderful recipe - it's a keeper!

Im not going to rate this as a bad recipe because I suppose it could be something that I did. This was definitely more like a cake in my opinion. It also took about 45 minutes maybe longer to cook!  I was so excited because it was VERY easy prepping but didnt turn out as I had expected.

I was so excited to try these cookies after reading the reviews.  Well I was very dissapointed.  They were way too sweet.  It was like eating sugar.  There are much better recipies out there.

Wow Wow Wow.  Such an easy recipe for such a great dessert.  My husband loved them and he doesn't really like sweets.  So light and clean.  Wonderful with a little jam on top and a nice cup of tea.

These are my family's new favorites!! I followed the recipe exactly except adding sliced almonds on top. I baked them for 35 minutes at 325 in a glass dish. They are light and airy.  Super easy, will make again and again.

Yummy and super easy! Turned out perfectly the first time, baked up fine at 325 for 30 min.  May add chopped or slivered almonds next time around.  Made these for a church reception.

Based on the other reviews, I used just 1 1/2 C sugar and reduced the eggs to 3. I also added blanched almonds on top and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  They came out GREAT! Three days later they are still moist.  I would say they are more like a tea cake than a cookie, but really good!

Wow.  So much flavor for such and easy recipe.  I filled the pan 2/3 full, added alayer of sliced almonds and then topped with remaining batter.  I omitted the powdered sugar, it didn't need it.

These are okay, I messed up and didnt melt the butter it was just softened, so I think that must have made them not bake right, it took about 40 min and they are still doughy. May try them again.

3.5 Stars.  After sitting out and uncovered overnight these did get better, though the sugar could and should be cut significantly. Mine turned out rather bar like - crumbly outer, soft 'n' chewy insides. (Baked at the recommended 325 and for about 15 minutes longer than specified) Sprinkled the top with sliced almonds as opposed to the confectioner's sugar.  These weren't a kid-friendly treat, and I NEEDED coffee with them.

These are sooooo good. I've been making them for a long time, but never got around to reviewing. Follow the recipe exactly, and you'll be a happy camper. However, for even more amazingness I've been using just 1.5 cups of flour, and then adding a cup of ground almond meal.....even better. I also use only brown sugar instead of white. To me, these are more like a tea cake than a bar.

I made these with my daughter because we were studying the letter A - so we made almond bars.  I had no idea what to expect, but figured with that much sugar and butter, it couldn't be bad!  They are a HUGE hit!  Very easy to make.  I used 1Tbsp Almond instead of 2 1/2 tsp. to make it easier on my daughter and drizzled melted chocolate over the top.  Yum yum!

I have been making these for years. The key is to not over cook them. They don't need to be doctored up, they are already perfect. If you cook them just right, they will have the texture of having almond paste. Yum!

Great flavor and easy one bowl prep, although a little sweet and overpowering when finished. I'd cut the sugar and butter a bit. Also, it took about 45 minutes on 325-next time I would do it at 350 for 30 minutes.

I have to admit this was a no brainer bar. THIS IS SO SIMPLE! I cut the bars and sprinkled a little melted chocolate on the top to fancy them up for Christmas. I have to rate it so high because anyone could make it. It is a good recipe for kids to learn how to bake.

These weren't good at all. I tried them because I love almond flavor and thought they would be a nice and easy addition to my Xmas baking. TERRIBLE. They aren't anything like bars but more like a dry cake. The flavor is horrible. The almond flavor is there but I still taste flour. The confectioner's sugar doesn't help but I find it actually makes it worse. I can taste flour and the sugar gives me the powdery texture that makes me feel as though I am eating flour. They are also very unattractive. I don't see how this would sell at a school bake sale. I 've volunteered at my daughter's school bake sales and the goodies that go are the ones with chocolate or sprinkles or colored sugar. These might be good dunked in coffee but since I don't drink coffee I could care less. They might work at a nursing home bake sale. That's how bland they were.

These were very easy to make.  They taste like almond pound cake.  If I made them again, I would probably try to cut back on the butter.

I've made these bars twice and have received compliments on them.  I love almonds!  I put some sliced almonds on top of the batter and generously sprinkle lots of regular sugar on top, all over!  I guess you wouldn't necessarily need to sprinkle powdered sugar on top after baking if you do this.

Really good cookie with a brownie-like texture.  The second time I made them, I sprinkled mini semi-sweet chocolate chips over the batter prior to baking.  I finished them with powdered sugar just as the recipe indicates.  The ones with chips were even better than the basic recipe.  I bet you could top these with just about anything and they would taste good!

This is one of my favorites.  I do add a small bit more almond and top with slivered almonds instead of confectioner's sugar - but - every time I've made it for a public event, there haven't been any leftovers :)

I made a half batch in an 8X8 pan and they worked out great. A simple but amazing recipe. This can be whipped together with pantry staples in just minutes of prep time. If you love almond, these are for you!

This is such a great recipe.  I always have the ingredients on hand and they're very simple to make.  Do not overbake these, as the flavor really seems to depend on the moistness of the bars.  They are a great holiday bar, but we make them year-round.

These have become one of my "go to" recipes when I want to take something sweet for a morning event.  Wonderful with a cup of coffee.  Takes closer to 40 minutes to bake in my oven.

Everyone liked.   Easy and fast.   I had only made half batch and cut the time a bit.

Very easy to make and great taste! I agree with other reviewers that they taste like a bear claw. They were a big hit with the family, I will be making these often! Thanks so much for sharing!

Really tasty once I finally got them completely baked.  I think I might up the almond extract to 3 t.  However, the baking instructions are wildly inaccurate.  After 30 minutes at 325 I took out the bars and tested with a wooden toothpick.  They tested done.  I let them cool for an hour, dusted with the powdered sugar and cut into them.  Instead of a cake like bar I found raw batter. (Apparently the batter doesn't stick to the toothpick enough to see.) I put them back in the oven at 350 for an ADDITIONAL 30 minutes and they finally are done, still a little gooey, but cooked through.  I think I will start at 350 next time.  Tasty and easy.

I have made these for years and they are still a favorite.  The taste is very close to Dutch Banket which is a flaky pastry filled with almond paste.  My Dutch father loves these and they are so much easier to make than Banket!

These were the easiest cookies to make that I've ever made.  For that reason and the fact that my picky husband ate them rather aggresively, I give them 5 stars.  The only change I made was to make a glaze rather than dusting with powdered sugar.  Next time I may try with some different flavorings, not that it's needed.

these are amazing! In fact, so amazing I'm not sure I can make them again, because they're the type of thing you keep going back to the kitchen to get! My husband had 3 big bars. The only request he made after the first one was for a cup of coffee! Perfect combo! Thank you for posting this recipe!!

A very nice, simple recipe. I like it because the ingredients are ones you will always have on hand. Very easy to make. I made a  powdered sugar frosting to make it look pretty and add some moisture. Colored the frosting green for Christmas and they are delicious. Had to add more almond extract than the recipe called for. Very good. Will make again.

These are cake-like bars; like a brownie. They are rich, decadent and buttery. Absolutely a Keeper!

These were delicious and very simple. I made as written but cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 pan. We loved the almond flavor and the great chewy texture.

I made these for a bbq on Memorial Day. I thought they were just ok, but everyone else liked them. I would give them a 3, but everyone said to give it 4.

I loved this recipe! It was incredibly sweet (perhaps too sweet for some people). I cooked it 10 minutes longer than the time indicated and it was still so moist that it seemed barely cooked. Nevertheless, my family and I couldn't stop eating it!

These are good, but not as good as I was expecting according to the other reviews. They are definitley easy enough. I thought they would be chewier. I made them in an 11x14 so that they taste more like a bar than a cake but they are still kinda cake like. Just good for me, not great.

really good, followed another reviewers advice and lined a 11x14 pan with tinfoil, greased that with butter instead of a 9x13.  i wanted them more bar like than cake like.  delicious.

Absolutely out of this world!!  Didn't change a thing.  Great flavor. Nice spongy texture.  As someone else suggested, sprinkle some slivered almonds on top.  Adds to the appearance.  Beware, you can't eat just one!  Make these to share!
