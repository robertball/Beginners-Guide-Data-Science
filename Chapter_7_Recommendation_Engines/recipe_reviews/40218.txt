This recipe was AMAZING!  I used 8 shoulder chops, which were a lot cheaper but supposed to be tougher; however, mine came out extremely tender.  I tripled the recipe, except for the onion, so my chops could literally swim in the marinade.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder. I marinated them for over 5 hours and cooked them on the gas grill (I HIGHLY recommend grilling them).  I seared both sides first on high heat then turned the grill down to low, closed the lid and let them cook for several minutes.  Turned them over for several minutes more.  While cooking I drizzled additional marinade over them.  Let me tell you, these were soooo incredibly good that we couldn't stop eating them!  My husband called them "wonderful" and said that it was like eating at a fine restaurant.  These came out better tasting than the leg of lamb I roast at Easter, which we all love and look forward to.  Next Easter I'm going to marinade my leg of lamb in this overnight and slow roast it in the grill.  I think the key to success with this recipe is a long marinade time.  The longer the better.

This was really good.  I would suggest using red wine instead of white wine, however.  I've made it with both and the red-wine-version was much more tastier.

I made this recipe last night, and it was very good.  I had some dollar-a-pound lamb-shoulder chops, so I marinated them all day (about 8 hours) to tenderize them; then we barbecued them on a charcoal grill.  They were tender and tasty.  I found that they needed a little more cooking than the recipe advises; and, next time, I'll use powdered thyme and fresh rosemary so that the marinade/sauce isn't "gritty."  Also, because I didn't have any wine, I used about 2T of balsamic vinegar, and it worked fine.  Very flavorful recipe.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and even better to eat. The rosemary compliments the mild flavor of the lamb quite nicely. I serve with herbed red potatoes and sauted zuccini. Even my picky 10 year old ate it up.

Delicious!  This was absolutely outstanding.  I must say this is probably one of the best meals I've had. The herbs blend together perfectly to create an excellent taste all around.  The Lamb Chops came out very tender and delicious.  Will make this a winter regular.

These were ok, the dressing on the side was the best.  I think the lamb needed a little more flavor.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats.  Cook time as also off.  I marinated for about 8 hours.  I will make again with some changes, for instance adding salt and pepper to the meat and making more of the marinade to cook on the side.

I made this with shoulder chops instead of loin and I would definately recommend using the loin chops OR removing the meat from the bone beforehand (as another reviewer mentioned) Because I used shoulder chops, I marinated the meat overnight - was tender and delicous.  This recipe is REALLY EASY.

The chops were delicious.  I never knew Lamb could be so good.  I really liked that you didn't have to marinade over night.  The sauce was marvelous.  My chops were about 1" thick and they were cooked to medium with this recipe.  It will become one of my favorites for sure.

I first tried this recipe done in a med hot frying pat, and had mixed feelings about it.....BUT when i did this recipe when i was camping with friends all we had was a Bar-B-Q. Well let me tell you... I kept brushing on some of the marinade while making sure to get some of the onion and herbs to stick to the chops.absolute heaven.I meen I had the whole campground gathering around just from the aroma...Friends of mine from New Zealand have asked for the recipe because it is the best that they have tried...med heat on a small bbq. put all of the olive oil into the marinade when using the bbq. be care full not to over cook

This was an amazing dinner!! The marinade was incredible, I used it on some wedged potatoes that I fried, it worked really well! I didn't have any rosemary so I used italian seasoning, and I didn't have any wine so I used water, and it worked really well! I let the lamb marinade for about 3 hours and it was very tender. It was like something you would get at a restaurant!

I expected more flavor as I marinated the chops over night. A bit bland.  My husband suggests more spices, namely rosemary

I fixed this tonight for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  I had never had lamb, let alone fixed it.  But, I saw this recipe and the reviews and decided to try it.  Out of the twelve I prepared it for, 8 being children, all liked it and came back for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW! This was the first time I ever cooked lamb chops and this marinade was fantastic.  I used freshly chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and red wine instead of white wine. My husband grilled the thick chops for 5 minutes per side.  They came out perfect! If you have never had lamb before, this is a great recipe to try.

I tried this twice.  The first was on pork and I marinated it only for the specified time and while it tasted fine there wasnt much flavour.  The second time I actually went out and bought some lamb, and I marinated it overnight.  Im not sure if it was because it was on lamb or because I marinated it overnight but it tasted great the second time.

On friday nights, I cook for my wife. We try things we never had before - variety is wonderful! We had fresh mixed greens with cherry tomatoes, fresh bean sprouts, almond slices and rasberry vinegarette dressing for starters. Followed with "Rosemary Marinated Lamb Chops" (see posted recipe). Served with pencil asparagus in drawn butter and dill mixture, small red potatoes - halved and coated with olive oil and lightly sprinkled with pepper, seasoning salt and parsley. We had winter squash - cubed, steamed and coated with drawn butter and sprinkled with brown sugar. The wine was Sutter Home White Merlot, served at room temperature. Desert was "Tiramisu II" (see posted recipe). What an evening we had!!!!!

These were surprisingly good, I don't like to use a lot of dried herbs, prefer fresh, but the flavour was good.  Next time though I will use fresh herbs and see what it's like.  Also there wasn't enough marinade so will double the quantity.  I had to add more orange juice at the end to make the sauce.

I didn't get to marinate but for about 5 minutes, and it was still delicious.  Substituted apple cider for white wine.  Great marinade!

These were good, but the seasonings were a little overpowering for the lamb. I liked the way it tasted, but I think next time I make it I'll reduce the amount of rosemary.

A delicious and simple recipe.  I made the original amount of marinade for 4 small lamb chops, which was just enough for 2 persons.  Important to reduce the marinade at the end or the sauce will be taste too strongly of the wine.

I cooked this for my parents and I for dinner tonight.  We all really enjoyed it.  My mum gave it 3 stars and my dad and I both gave it 4.  We thought it was really flavourful.  I asked and no one thought that it was in the least bit sweet due to the orange juice as previous reviewers warned.  I marinated my chops for 24 hours and doubled the marinade recipe as per previous reviewers recommendations.  I cooked the chops in a frying pan on the stove and the family decided that it wasn't something that we would do on the barbeque.  I will cook this again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

What a wonderful recipe!  This is now the only way I prepare lamb.  It is so easy!  I substitute red wine for white and pomegranate juice for orange.  I also use the standard amount of marinade but for only about 2-3 chops to make sure the meat is coated and there is enough for a sauce.  They go great with roasted red potatoes.

A friend brought me some fresh lamb chops after a visit to the family sheep farm, so I thought I would give this a try. It was my first time making lamb chops, and it was the best meal I've eaten in a long time. I let the marinade sit in the fridge for a day to let the flavours mix before adding the lamb, marinaded for 6 hours, then barbqued for a few minutes on each side. I brought the leftover marinade to a boil for a few minutes and added a spoonful to each chop and let sit on the BBQ for a few more minutes to finish cooking.

These were fantastic.  In my opinion, you have to grill them.  Over medium-high heat I kept turning the chops and spooning the marinade over the top.  As they were cooking, I brought the reserve marinade to a boil and let it simmer for a great sauce when serving.  My only change is a bit more salt and to double the amount of marinade for 8 chops.

Very tasty.  I do suggest using fresh herbs and garlic if possible.  Of course if you do, us at least twice as much.  This is the recipe I like to use when introducing lamb to folks who have never eaten it before.

Great recipe!  I recommend marinating it for longer than an hour.  I used fresh, dried herbs, so I added a little bit extra of everything.  The OJ is a nice touch.

This marinade turned out quite tasty.  We grilled them for four minutes on each side and they turned out medium rare, which is just how we like them.  I would add a couple of extra minutes if you like your meat done a bit more.  The only thing I would change with the recipe is to use a mortar and pesel to grind the thyme and rosemary unless you like the "twiggy" texture.

Pretty good, pretty good... Definitely takes longer than 4 minutes per side unless you want your chops still bloody.  I had a teetotaler coming over so I omitted the wine and used water as per another reviewer and it came out just fine.  My chops were from the arm/shoulder so they were very boney, therefore I'd recommend a different cut.  I did not blot the chops dry; not sure what kind of a difference that would have made, but I just didn't have the time!  But a great recipe overall.

This is my first time making lamb chops and this recipe is very easy to follow. Instead of using McCormick dry herbs, i substituted with fresh ones. Next time, i would marinate the chops for a night. Also, i just love the orange marinate!! in fact, i used it this as a sauce for my chicken chops and it went very well too.  You can consider adding some orange zest to your sauce to enhance its flavour.

I marinated these for about 2 hours.  I don't usually care for lamb, but must admit that these were WONDERFUL!  Served them with baked little red potatoes and steamed asparagus.  I'm still getting kudos from my husband!  Will definitely make these again.  I used the loin chops and they're worth the extra money.  Very, very tender and great flavor from the marinade.

This recipe is awesome. The flavors blended well. It took longer to cook than 8 minutes on each side for medium well though.  The only thing I would change is adding meat tenderizer, accent, & season salt to the lamb chops to sit overnight with the mixture as well.  Thank you again for a recipe that I will use over and over.

The dish was soooo easy, the house smelled great and it was delicious. I did take the advice of the other reviewers and used red wine. I also used the rib chops. My husband who wasn't a big lamb fan, loved it.

I used this recipe with 1 lb of meat and half the marinade(since the recipe specifies servings and not the weight, I approximated 1 lb to be 4 servings). There were other modifications I made - didn't have thyme leaves, substituted McCormick Italian Seasoning. I also used kosher lamb meat, not easy to get unless you intend to. I also seared the lamb longer (5-7 min)on each side because I like it well done.

It came out great. You could taste the effect of the marinade and it was just right; I refrigerated it for about 40 min.
Next time though I will make a full amount of marinade even if I have less meat, because when reducing 1/4 cup of marinade in the last step there was nothing left of it in the end.
And next time I will use this recipe for a festive occasion instead of a weeknight dinner; its that good and easy.

I love lamb and these were very yummy. I think I will marinade my lamb chops this way from now on. I omitted the orange juice and onion, but they were still so good.

Loved this recipe, but I actually used veal cutlets instead of the lamb chops! Turned out really great tasting, and did not cost me an arm and a leg! Probably just as good (if not better) with the lamb chops!

My whole family really enjoyed these.  My only complaint was that the onion pieces scorched some during the searing process.  Next time (and there'll certainly be a next time, I'm sure) I think I'll puree the onions with the remaining marinade ingredients and see if that prevents the problem.  An alternative would be to wipe the onion pieces off the meat before cooking.

Great recipe. I took one of the poster's suggestions and used red wine. Turned out awesome. I don't like roasting lamb because of the smell, but the chops work well. Thanks for this recipe!!

This recipe was OK- nothing to write home about- I thought the chops would have a lot more flavor than they did. Not great but not bad either.

This recipe is wonderful! The flavors really bring out the best taste of lamb. My husband raved about the chops and ate them so quickly I barely got one chop.  I will add this to my favorite recipes.

My husband of 10 years said this was the best dinner ever.  He called it EXQUISITE and talked about it for days after.  Super easy, tastes great and my 11 month old loved it, too.  I served it with homemade garlic bread.  Perfect!

Lamb chops were on sale this week at our local grocery store.  I have never tried lamb chops before, found this recipe, and decided to give it a whirl.  WOW!!!  Outstanding.  My husband went NUTS!  He said it was better than going out to dinner.  The chops were 1" thick, so cooked longer on stove.  A great find. Thanks:}

Ya know, I know I wanted lamb for dinner, but I didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. The best part of this recipe was how easy it is. Throw all the ingredents in a bag, shake it up, and let it marinate in the frig for about an hour, and then cook it hot and fast.

What a wonderful flavor! We actually used pinapple/orange juice and had shoulder/neck chops but it worked wonderfully! Delicious!!

Both my husband and I thought this was fabulous!  I cooked three large loin lamb chops rather than eight, but followed the recipe exactly for the marinade. I marinated the chops for about six hours.  The only thing I did differently (which I think made the sauce so wonderful) was to add about 3T of butter and about 1/4C Madeira at the very end and let it cook another minute or two.

I thought this recipe was good but didn't care for the orange juice in the marinade.  It made it on the sweet side.  Next time I might try it with lemon juice as one reviewer suggested.

Really loved this recipe, although I do chuck in far more wine than recommended. Made this for the "mother-in-law" the first time she visited our new home. She was so impressed, she pinched the spare chop out of the fridge before going home the next morning!! ... And the recipe! Earned me a few brownie points methinks! Thankyou!!! xxx

Absolutely wonderful!  I marinated overnight instead of just one hour.  I also used red wine instead of white, and served the same wine at dinner, which complemented the lamb very well.  Everyone loved it!  I tripled the recipe, as I cooked 22 thick lamb chops, and it was perfect.  Thank you!

Wanted something different this year....the marinade was the best part of the whole recipe!  Lamb didn't go over well at our house, except for my son-in-law, who ate 2 chops and took 2 home!  I did grill them and I'm sure they were better than pan fried.  If you grill them and use fresh rosemary, be sure to remove all of the rosemary and any pieces of onion.  I will, however, try the marinade in the future on other meats.

Delicious!!! I used fresh rosemary, thyme & pressed garlic & then grilled them on our BBQ & they were so good! We had guests w/ 2 kids age 13 & they had never tried lamb & they ate a whole chop each & loved it.

Terrific. I ended up marinating this for three days because we had unexpected guests, dinner plans for the next night, blah blah blah. Suffice it to say, it still turned out well. I needed to butterfly the big lamb loin chops I had gotten from Costco...they're about 2.5 inches thick or more. I didn't separate out the marinade, just reduced it with around 1/2 cup of two buck chuck and some Wondra.

I've been making this recipe for at least three years now, so I suppose it's about time I rated it. This is a wonderfully flavorful dish that would perform equally well at home with the family or when entertaining guests. The marinade is quick and easy to prepare, and it cooks up in a jiffy. Enjoy!

I marinated these overnight and then grilled them on the barbecue, rather than the skillet.  The meat came out succulent and very flavorful.  Definitely will add to the barbecue menu roster for future gatherings!

This is one of the better lamb marinades I've tried. I have used it twice now. However both times I've had rather tough cuts of lamb :-(
but the flavour of the marinade is great! and made up for the toughness.

OMG! These were the best lamb chops I've ever had! Used 4 lion chops. Tossed about 1/4 of the marinade over potatoes and roasted them in the oven while chops marinaded. Excellent...And the sauce made with the extra marinade when it deglazed the pan, was to die for!! We'll be eating alot more lamb chops in this house!

Delicious! I prepared everything the night before and then threw in the pan when I got home for work. Along with some other fall treats it made for a easy, but gorgeous quick meal.

I made this for the first time at my in-laws house. We didn't have any white wine open, so used red instead. We also didn't have any thyme so just left it out. We used lamb steaks. This was really good. My fil even said it was delicious. I know that mil and I will both make this again. I can imagine it would be great for beef as well.

Yummy! I am not a fan of lamb, or meat in general, but this was very tasty. ALSO, VERY expensive. For those that aren't looking for the lamb to be anything less than medium, I would recommend 5 to 6 minutes per side.

WOW! First time I ever tried cooking lamb and the flavour of this recipe was fantastic. I didnt have any wine on hand so I just used regular water and it was still delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

This was a fantastic marinade.  After marinating the lamb chops, I grilled them.  I have since used variations of this marinade for other meats.

Yum, yum, yum!  My kids ate this and loved it too.  I recommend loin chops for the most tender cut.

This is the best lamb I ever made, and one of the best I ever had.  It was also very easy.  (I used Red wine instead of white)
