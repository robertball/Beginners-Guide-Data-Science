I wasn't sure if we would like this, but it was surprisingly delicious.  My husband is fussy, but he actually raved about it.  It was nice to try something really different for a change, and I liked the idea of using the healthy garlic, ginger, and curry ingredients.  No changes, except I threw in a handful of frozen peas for some color.  Served with rice, sour cream, and slices of soft tortilla as I had these on hand.

I've been wanting to learn how to make Indian food and this has come close to what I'm used to getting in a nearby restaurant. Next time I make it, I will blend the tomatoes in with the onion/garlic/ginger paste to make it a true red sauce instead of pouring the tomatoes in with the chicken. Think I will like better. 

Warning: If Vindaloo Curry is used instead of Madras Curry (which I couldn't find), go sparingly because it is has a lot of heat. Use 1/4 the amount of curry given in the recipe for mild and 1/2 the amount for medium heat. Vindaloo Curry does give it that nice Indian flavor I was looking for.
