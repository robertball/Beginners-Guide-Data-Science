Absolutely delicious!! Much lighter than a cheesecake but just as tasty, making it a perfect simple summer dessert! Tip: the crust and the raspberry topping both take a while to cool down enough to assemble the pie (a good two hours) so make sure you have enough time on your hands before you start this venture!

This was delicious. I used a store bought crust to save time and it came out just fine. I liked that the raspberry wasn't too sweet.

Quite easy to make.  Best to refrigerate over night to allow cream filling to set.  I added a little more sugar to the raspberry topping to make it a more sweeter for my personal taste.

So simple, and so delicious!  The easy to make raspberry topper is what makes the dessert.

The best.  We used to live near Briermere Farm and this recipe is just as I remember it.  My hat is off to you.

I used fresh raspberries and I should have used a little more sugar in the raspberry topping, but over all it was good.

I made no changes except the second time I made it I put it
in a deep dish pie pan.
This dessert has wonderful contrast between sweet filling
and tart topping.

Filling delicious, pie delicious, but I was wondering:  I had waaaayy too much whip for a regular pie crust, and I didnâ€™t see anything that said use deep dish.  I could have made two pies with what I had.  Anyone else have this issue?  I just put the extra in ramekins and had raspberry whip dessert.
