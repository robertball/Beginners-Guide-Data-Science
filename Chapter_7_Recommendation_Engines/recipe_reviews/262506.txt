I altered it a bit, but we LOVED it! Substituted dill for Italian seasoning and added 1 tbs mayo because it looked a little dry. We devoured it. Thanks for the recipe!

Salmon with a crunchy coating, but the coating doesn't have much flavor. I might try what one of the other reviewers did and add some mayo since it was kind of dry. It needs more spice. I would add dill and forget the Italian seasoning and maybe add some other type of seasoning along with it.

Followed another reviewer’s recommendation to add a tablespoon of mayonnaise. No fresh herbs in the pantry and substituted Italian herb paste. Turns out great!

This one of my favorite ways to cook salmon. I season with lemon pepper and garlic salt because I always have it on hand in place of garlic powder and lemon juice.

This is so terrific! I modify slightly with dairy-free parm to accommodate an allergy in our family. Works great and the taste is incredible. This is a family favorite!

This was so delicious!  I baked it in my convection toaster oven for 16 mts.  It came out really nice.  I'll make it again!

Great weekday night dinner. Easy to make! Have made a recipe similar to this one of my own for years though I use ground up corn flakes as the breading. Food processor works great here. Following the directions the rest of the way, these turned out GREAT! I don’t care for planko and the taste of plain corn flakes gives just a breading taste to the meal without adding in any that takes away from this recipe.
