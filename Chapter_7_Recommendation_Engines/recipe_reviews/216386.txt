I'm NOT a Sweet Potato eater ~ never have been. That said, I came across the Praline Sweet Potato recipe here about 8 years ago and have been making it every Thanksgiving & Christmas until yesterday.  This year I decided to find a recipe not so 'desserty'.  This Apricot-Pecan Sweet Potato recipe fit that need perfectly!!!  I made the sauce the night before to save some time.  I immediately fell in love!!  I got out some vanilla ice cream and poured some on....heaven.  I couldn't wait to try it on the potatoes next day.  There was too much sauce since I don't make much in the way of SPs. So I have more leftover sauce for ice cream~ Yay! I added the pecans after pouring the sauce on the potatoes and popped it in the oven.  So easy!!  So FAST!  So delicious!!  Not overly sweet or heavy.  I'll be making this sauce many times during the year as well!

This review is long over due.  I love sweet potatoes any way they're cooked.  I've eaten & baked sweet potato casseroles most of my adult life, but nothing touches this.  I'm not a fan of marshmellows so decided to give this recipe a try.  I Took it to a pot luck for our square dance club's Christmas dinner.  Wow!  They loved it.  Dish was empty by the time I got to it.  This will be my sweet potato casserole recipe from now on.  
Thank you for sharing.  I prepared the dish exactly as written.

This is sooooo good!!!  My 9 year old daughter took one bite and said "Mom, this sauce would be great on carrots!"  I am excited for leftovers tomorrow, I bet they will be even better!

I have made this every Thanksgiving for many years.  I cut the potatoes into strips and arrange in  the casserole with drained apricot halves and whole pecans (see other photos).  I cut the brown sugar a bit and use one recipe of the sauce for 4 to 5 large potatoes.  This method keeps the sweetness and calories down a bit.  I now also use the drained syrup from the apricots instead of the nectar to make a clearer, shiny glaze.

Instead of the traditional Sweet Potato Casserole, I prepared this dish on Christmas Day.  Everyone thought it was fantastic.  Needless to say, this will be the dish I prepare on holidays from now on.

I made this the other night and my husband, Rick & I liked them. They are very sweet. The next I make them Iâ€™m going to use less brown sugar and use the juice from the orange and cut the apricot juice by the same amount..  We are planning on taking these to our family Thanksgiving get together this week.
Thanks for a great idea. It is always fun to try new recipes.

My husband loved it, he said it tastes like deserty pumpkin dishes. I liked it less, expecting a little more crisp to it. I used only half the brown sugar and it was sweat enough.

I omitted the orange peel and used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I also chopped up 1/4 cup dried apricots and set them in 3/4 cup boiling water while the potatoes were boiling.  When I made the sauce, I added the apricots (with the water they were reconstituted in) after the sauce thickened. I found Jumex apricot nectar in the soft drink section of the grocery store. It comes in a 12-oz. can. I used the entire can and omitted the 1/2 cup water listed in the recipe. This makes a lot of sauce, so sometimes when I take it somewhere I use 6 pounds of potatoes for the same amount of sauce. And every time I take it somewhere, I get multiple requests for the recipe.
