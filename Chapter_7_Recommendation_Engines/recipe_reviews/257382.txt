It was definitely a bit more spicy than anticipated even after reviewing the ingredients but it was delectable! Highly recommend if you're looking for an at home Spicy Pork Bulgogi!

This is so great!  I used thinly sliced pork tenderloin and just regular bbq sauce.  We  had company and everyone  grilled  their own slices at the table on a hot rock that is made for Korean BBQ.  It was delicious.
