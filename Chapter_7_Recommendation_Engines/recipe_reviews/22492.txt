My 5 year old daughter made these for her dad for Father's Day and she had SO much fun!  This is an excellent recipe for children, but more than that, these cookies taste wonderful.  Everyone wants me to make more for all of our family's potlucks!  Definately a good cookie to try.

Very Cute!  Excellent gift for Grandparent or Father's Day.  I chilled the cookie dough for about a half an hour in the frig.  I let the cookies cool completely on the cookie sheet before removing them.  They came off beautifully and easily.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This did not turn out like I had hoped. The cookies were extremely difficult to transfer from the cookie sheet to my cooling rack. Not because they stuck to the pan, but because they just fell apart. I used the largest spatula I have, but I guess it wasn't big enough. I also had problems decorating using a paper cutout of my son's hand. The oil from the cookie and the icing caused the paper to fall apart. Some of the paper stuck to the icing on the cookie. By the time I removed the paper, the decoration was ruined. I was disappointed because I had planned to give these cookies as Father's Day gifts to the grandpas.

These cookies tasted good. Next time I would add chocolate chips to it. My son had a great time making them for Father's Day! Thanks!
