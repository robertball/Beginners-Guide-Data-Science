Didn't bother to strain this.  Skim the foam off the top, pour off all the good, clear yellow stuff, and leave the milk solids behind.  There is some waste of course, although you could use the discarded solids for other things. Point is, if you're making an awesome surf and dinner, it is a treat so worth the effort and anything you have to discard.  And it keeps for a long, long time in the fridge!

It doesn't get any easier than this. Just add some black pepper and lemon juice to make perfect dipping butter for lobster or shrimp.

Just what I needed!  I used a fine soup strainer and it worked perfectly. I also find it work best to heat in a saucepan, not a skillet.

No need to strain ghee if you’re careful and go very slow. Keep the “curds” left over to butter vegetables.  Also, I have never refrigerated ghee, as long as all milk solids are removed.

So easy and super delicious.  We live at the beach and this is just as good as any local restaurant.  Perfect for our  Alaskan crab leg, shrimp, broccoli & hush-puppies we're having tonight.

I "discovered" GHEE about a year ago.  It is so wonderful and this recipe is so easy and fast! Try adding different spices (curry, basil,  tarragon) for great tastes.  Gail

I felt the need to compare these directions with some others because I wasn't about to ruin my butter. I worked with 2 pounds unsalted as directed and will salt when I cook. It turned out so perfect that I really wanted to do shots…is that wrong? This is liquid gold and this will be a staple from now on.

I made this and it was very easy. Patience is key and keep the heat low! I strained it through a fine mesh sieve lined with cheese cloth and still had some solids on top.

Question?   It came to a boil and white solids came up to top but not all?    When I poured it through a sieve most of the white solids went through too.   It was a fine mesh sieve.  I was able to pour off quite a bit of the clarified butter but some remains with the white solids and I can’t seem to separate them.   What should I have done?

Very simple, yet one need to know what to do. I burned my first batch by accident, had to go to allrecipes to check what went wrong, this recipe is the first I read, my second batch seems great. Thanks for the recipe!

I only did 1 lb of salted butter and it turned out really well.  I just finished a snow crab dinner and used this for the dip as well as poured some on the baked potato.  Oh yummm!!!
