I had to try this (frozen) and everyone loved it! I too wondered about the gravy packet but I ran it under cold water a few seconds and it popped right off when I slid a paring knife between the packet and the breast. I also left the string wrap on since it was frozen onto the turkey. The only issue I had was that the seasonings didn't stick to the frozen breast. I rubbed on what I could and dumped the rest in. The gravy was thinner than I like it but when I reheated it the next day, it was thicker. I found the gravy to be very tasty and not too sweet as one reviewer said.

All in all, great recipe without changing a thing. I'm now wondering what to do with the leftover "veggies"--use in soup, maybe?

I made it exactly as written and it was very tasty!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I did allow the turkey breast to defrost just slightly, so it would be moist on the outside.  This allowed the seasoning to stick better.  Will definitely make this again!

For starters I love the idea of cooking turkey in the instant pot, however, I am not sure about cooking frozen turkey or chicken in the instant pot. This is the second time I have cooked frozen poultry in the instant pot and the texture is strange. Is it under cooked? Is it cooked? Overcooked?  My thermometer read a safe temperature but the middle was pink while the ends were dry & over cooked. The flavors were ok. The rosemary overpowered the entire dish, definitely cut that in half. I follow the recipe exactly and for how expensive a boneless butterball turkey is I will not be cooking it in the instant pot again.

well I used the "frozen" turkey and followed the directions, setting the instant pot for 50 mins and it did not cook all the way through.  the ends appeared to be cooked but a couple slices in, it was still raw in the middle.  I put it back in with broth and did it for 15 more mins.  cooked through this time, but the overall taste was a little lacking or maybe that's just how turkey is supposed to be... since we only eat this during holidays... will think twice about doing this one again...

Made according to the recipe. The turkey was fantastic. I added an extra 10 min to the cooking time cause some other reviews said theirs wasn’t done. The gravy was sweet and weird. Didn’t like it at all. Next time I will omit the apple..

My turkey was kind of half frozen and half defrosted so it messed up timing.  I had to put it back on for another 15 minutes.  It turned out great.

Wonderful!    I  removed skin &  used slurry of cornstarch and cold water.  I cooked my 5# bone-in frozen breast  7 minutes per pound with  NPR.  Juicy and tender!

It was just what I needed for a busy night!!! Quick and easy and no defrosting before hand. The turkey was so flavorful with the rub.

Made a 3 pounder and it tasted great! I didnt broil it at the end so presentation wasnt a home run but taste didnt seem to be affected. I did add some carrots at my wifes request. She loved them.

I followed the directions exactly.  Completely raw in the centre when cooked as directed. I have never been dissatisfied with an allrecipes recipe before.

Like the other reviewer, I made this according to instructions and it wasn't done.  So next time I will increase time or defrost slightly.  Also, i would lower the salt amount as it was slightly too salty for my taste.  Otherwise, great flavor.

This made a good turkey. I love that you can cook something from frozen in the Instant Pot! The apple made the gravy oddly sweet, so I will skip that next time.

I have a major problem with the instructions regarding the turkey sauce packet. I cannot determine if the bird is to be defrosted in the refrigerator so that the sauce packet can be easily removed, or run the bird under cold water and fight to get the packet out of the cavity (which I've done twice now). It may be obvious to some cooks, but not to me. This is the second time I've made it; I'd really like to have clear directions so that I might enjoy making it again.
