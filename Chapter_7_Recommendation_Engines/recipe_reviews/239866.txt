It's delicious, but it's to soft, I like a hard fudge you can bite into.

This was interesting.... I used green food coloring instead of the allotted vanilla. The things I liked about this recipe was that it was green... And that's pretty much it. If you like concrete flavored crystal fudge then this is the recipe for you. Make some odd club with it. The last thing i want to say is, Nuclear Fudge.
