This is good and easy; it's a quick substitute for making a more authentic curry, and a good weeknight dinner.  I made the following changes: (1) used regular (not quick) brown rice and cooked it all on the stovetop for about 50 minutes, til the water was absorbed and the rice was soft. I adjusted the water/rice proportions accordingly (3/4c rice and 1 1/2 c water).  It didn't seem necessary to me to turn the oven on when I could do this on the stovetop, though it did mean watching it a bit more closely. (2) Added about 1/8t cayenne since the curry powder I used is quite mild.

I threw this all together, uncooked, into a casserole dish for 75-90 minutes, using 1 cup of regular brown rice,.  Easy and yum!  We'll be making this regularly.

Looks like I am out of the norm compared to the other reviewers.  But I’m sorry, I just didn’t care for this recipe.  I thought it was okay -   nothing special.  I just didn’t care for the flavors.  I love curry recipes too so I was a little disappointed.  I brought some to my mom and she didn’t care for it either.  I would just give this recipe 2 stars however, since it was healthy, easy to make and all of the directions were accurate I will give it 3.

I've made this once and it probably earned 4 stars but 'm rating this a 5 for the potential.  I added about a cup of cauliflower which was a nice addition.  I also added a can of tomato sauce.  I think it needs 2 cubes of chicken bouillon and probably a tbsp of cumin.  I will also add chopped onion next time.  I started it in the skillet and just put the whole skillet in the oven covered in foil to finish it, so I didn't dirty 2 pans.  Do stir it often.  I almost didn't add the raisins since I don't usually like fruit mixed with savory dishes but I wish I had added more, they really do make it special!

This casserole is wonderful! As a curry fan on a weight loss program, this is a PERFECT dinner for me. The raisins (I used golden seedless) really make it special. This one is going into my repertoire!

I am always looking for new dishes to try with my friends... This turned out really good (other than my mistake of using regular brown rice and it didn't get done in the oven, the first time I made it) I made it again today cooking regular brown rice all the way on the top of the stove before mixing it into the rest of the recipe and into the oven... The first time I made it for 9 others and they all liked the flavor... in the future I would always cook the rice on the top of the stove before mixing into the rest... another thing I would do is to mix up the rest of the recipe the night before and let it marinade the chicken... plus makes it so easy to stick in the oven the next day and dinner is done!!! Thanks for the recipe, will use it again in the future!!!

Oh MY!  I am eating leftovers of this right now from last night's dinner and it is STILL divine!  This is comfort food without the guilt!  Rice cooks completely, chicken has great flavor, you don't miss a bit of the fat or calories!  Lemon juice gives it a bright, irresistible flavor!  Will definitely be making this again.  Also thinking of trying it "Cajun Style" with sausage & shrimp or sausage & chicken...  Great method & GREAT taste!!!  Thanks for posting!!!  By the way...served along with some sauteed red bells & onions seasoned with cumin, coriander, S&P, added fresh garlic, chicken stock & lemon juice at the end.  AWESOME complement!

I have to admit, I was surprised with this recipe. I found it using the ingredient search as I was very low on groceries and needed something for supper. I would have hever thought of putting tomatoes, rice, raisins, etc... all in the same dish but it was very tasty. Don't  be afraid to try it!

Yummy!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just plain cinnamon.  Tasty and reheats really well.

I am so happy I found this recipe!  I just typed in "cooked brown rice" and "chicken" in the ingredient search, and this was kind of what I was hoping I'd find!  Since I'm on Weight Watchers, I'm being very careful about what I eat, and make healthy changes wherever I can.  For this one, I used fat-free, sodium-free chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon, but everything else was pretty much the same.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes, so just used canned chopped tomatoes in juice, currants instead of raisins, Penzey's FABULOUS Maharajah curry and skipped the bay leaf.  Since the rice was already cooked, I just combined everything in a skillet and simmered until the chicken was done (about 10 minutes), then added the rice and popped it in the oven for another 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS, and even husband enjoyed it.  Thank you, Isybel, for a really great recipe!

Very good for such a quickly put together casserole. The family really liked this.  I made it on the stove top, next time I will par cook the rice and add more curry as we found it quite sweet.
Delicious.

Excellent recipe that has a regular part in meal rotation.  We usually add extra curry powder, some dried cranberries, and extra raisins.

It was edible, but I just couldn't bear the thought of having to eat it again, so the leftover went down the drain.

I like the complex flavors though simple preparation. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden because we had so much but then had to guess at the liquid. It worked out fine. It's very forgiving as long as the rice is cooked.

This was good and I will probably make it again. I used frozen peas instead of raisins and diced canned tomatoes instead of stewed. My husband really enjoyed it.

This is pretty good -- not great.  Okay for every day.  Not the party fare I was hoping to discover.  I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of water + boullion.  I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, because that is what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup of white rice, as I didn't think the brown would cook quickly enough.  I substituted a 9 oz. package of short cuts already cooked chicken for the raw chicken.

O My Gosh this was SOOOOO good! EVERYONE loved it! My 5 yr old asked for it again the next day, 2 year old asked for more and husband enjoyed it as well!Very delicious. I boiled some leg peices for about an hour, took meat off bone, and added it to rice mixture half way through bake time. Will be making this again.

OK, so I am reviewing the recipe that I tweeked a bit.  I had about 4 cups of leftover brown and wild rice from dinner the night before along with about 2-3 cups of roast chicken thighs and some breast meat from earlier in the week so I omitted the water and chicken bouillon and used a whole 15.5 oz can of Itilian style stewed tomatoes and followed the recipe from there and just cooked the whole thing in the oven for about half an hour until bubbly.  Such a great combination of flavors, my boys were skeptical when they saw the raisins but mmmmmm, so yummy they fought over the last spoonfuls!  Winning recipe.

Made this for dinner last night and my husband and I liked it. I used to make a dish very similar years ago which called for the rice cooked separately and chopped green apple was added to the chicken mixture which I did to this recipe. Husband said he would like this better without apple. Easy and will make again.

This was really really yummy!  And easy.  The only change was I added some diced carrots because I was trying to use them up.  My boyfriend and I loved it - comfort food indeed!  Thank you!

This was delicious!  I used regular brown rice which I soaked for about an hour in water first, and low-sodium chicken broth which I substituted for the water and boullion cube.  Golden raisins looked nice and tasted great.

It was something new for us, since we don't eat curried anything very often.  It tasted fine, but wasn't overly special in any way.  Might make again just because it was so easy to throw together.

I actually have an almost identical recipe in one of my cookbooks, which happens to be a diet cookbook, except that it also calls for 1/2 cup dried apricots (snip them into pieces) which I think makes it even better. It is a good recipe, and healthy. I am adding more raisins and apricots than called for when I make it again. I might try making it with a different type or types of rice, which I think would make it even better, it would just require more cooking time.

This was excellent!  I used regular brown rice and cooked it all on the stovetop in about 55 minutes.  I also had to add another 1/2 cup or so of boiling water near the end of cooking time.  I cooked the chicken seperately in oil and seasoned with salt, pepper and curry powder and then mixed it in once the rice was cooked.  Will definitely make again!

A definite keeper!  Added an onion and some mushrooms and used Brown Basmati Rice,  also used organic chicken stock and fresh tomatoes from my garden.  Easy to make and very tasty especially the next day. Thanks for this !

I wanted to make this casserolle-style in the oven, so as not to dry out the chicken I substituted whole chicken leg pieces for the cut up breast.  I mixed all the ingredients except the water and chicken several hours before to allow for the flavors to combine.  When it was time to bake it, I added the rice and water and poured the entire liquid mix into a greased casserolle dish.  While doing this I seared the chicken in hot olive oil, about 2 min's each side, then pressed them into the dish as well. After spooning a little of the tomatoe liquid over the top of each leg piece I then topped just the pieces with parsley (for looks!).  I covered it and baked it at 350 (180) for double the time (1 1/2 hours).  It looked gorgeous and smelled divine.  I needed to serve 15 men so I quadrupled the recipe.  It got better than rave reviews from the men, they went wild over it.  Thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe, but it just got an "Okay" from my family members.  I've never cooked with curry before and I was eager to try it. Since I'm dieting this healthy and easy recipe was worth a try.  I would definitly make it again, but it won't be in the regular rotation of recipes in my home as the family wasn't raving about it.

Recipe was ok. It was easy to make, however i used regular brown rice instead of quick brown and it took over an hour to cook in the oven. Overall not bad.

I like to look for different meals to spice up the ordinary, and this was perfect!  I work a full day and often need something simple to make for dinner, that is also healthy and tasty.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe that my husband and I will enjoy for years to come!!

I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I cooked it in a cast iron pan and just transferred it straight to the oven.

Good mix of flavors.  Used four fresh roma tomatoes, and also cooked regular brown rice separately, then mixed it with the other ingredients.  Added peas for color. Quick and easy for a cooler winter night!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I'm a big curry fan and make it often.  It's nice to make it all in one pot and MUCH quicker.  I omitted the raisins though.  I used a small cinnamon stick instead of ground (as I use in all my curries) and I added some chili powder for a little kick.

Stupendous!  I'm a complete novice in the kitchen and this was a breeze... and delicious.  It had lots of flavor but wasn't overly spicy (the effect of the cinnamon, I think).
I modified it a bit to increase the proportion of stewed tomatoes and dried fruit. In addition to raisins, I added dried cranraisins and dried cherries.  I suspect it sweetened the overall flavor a fair bit.

This tastes really good, but took WAY longer than 45 minutes to bake.  After 55 minutes, the rice was still crunchy and I had to turn on my convection oven!

This is easy and delicious.  You may be inclined to omit the raisins, but don't!  They add a wonderful dimension to the dish.  This is perfect fall weather food, and I will be making it again!

Made this simple recipe last night. Everyone loved it but we all agreed it could be a bit "wetter" and felt a great addition at the end would have been to stir in some pineapple cubes.

This is a wonderful, quick, easy, very tasty curry dish. I've been craving curry but haven't been in a cooking mood. This looked easy and it was. It satisfied my craving too. Whomever said it was blah must have their tastebuds numbed by processed foods. I did it all on the stovetop like another person did (2 cups water and 1 cup regular brown rice) but other than that everything was the same. Hubby said it needed more heat so he added some hot sauce (he adds that to everything) but I thought it was good as is.

This recipe tasted very good and was real easy to make.  The only thing I have against it is that it's a little dry and don't know how to fix it.  It tasted so good that I know I will make it again.  Thank you for this recipe.

Very poor balance of flavor. Lots of acidity from the tomato and lemon but the sweet of the raisins was not enough to balance it. Won't be making it again

I thought this was good but the flavor lacked something.  I made a lot of changes (such as, substituted quinoa for brown rice so it would cook faster and adding green onions, a carrot, mushrooms and craisons), but this had nothing to do with the spice ratios.  I think next time I will try adding pumpkin pie spice like another reviewer did...

OUTSTANDING!! Every member of my family (7 of us) loved this dish, and my brother who was visiting and disliked raisins couldn't stop raving about this recipe. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis! It's nice to have something be so healthy and yet taste soooo good. Oh, and I used regular brown rice, not the quick cooking rice. I let it cook for 70 mins in the oven. It turned out just perfect!

This wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  I made it exactly as specified - without the optional bay leaf.  The recipe didn't say what type of raisins, so I used golden. They turned out to be the best part of the recipe, adding a bit of sweetness to it.  With all of the spices, I was expecting more flavor, but it was actually a bit bland.  This is an easy recipe to throw together and wasn't bad, but it's not tasty enough to make again.

This was great!  The entire family enjoyed it...this one is a keeper.  My husband, who is definitely not a cook, made this for dinner and said it was "so easy, even I could do it."  I did feel it was a little sweet, next time we will add some frozen peas before it goes into the oven.

Probably not something I'd make again. I like all the ingredients on their own, but not together. The mix of flavors just wasn't very good, and the texture was really mushy.  My husband and son couldn't even finish their plates.  The chicken was the only redeeming quality, as it turned out quite good.  I picked it out and ate it alone as leftovers.

I also found this recipe through the ingredient search for a churc potluck.  I doubled it, using a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes & adding 1/2 tsp of ginger & 2T sugar recommended by another reviewer.  I also used regular brown rice, and just cooked it on the stove for 10 minutes while I cut up the chicken.  Then after adding the chicken, I put it all in a 9x13, covered it, and stuck it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours at 300 and when the church service was over -- it was done. Since I'm not a curry eater, I'm not a good judge of these things.  But others at church who like curry said it was good, and had nice flavor.  So I'm passing along their review to you all!

Very easy to make, and my husband and I both liked it, although it's not a very attractive dish.  Not "to die for" but good if you want a curry dish in hurry.

I made something very similar to this last night, from a different recipe. The ingredients are mostly the same, except: used 15 oz can stewed tomatoes, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, no garlic, no bay leaf, only 1 tsp curry powder and 1 c regular long grain rice (Uncle Ben's white). Was actually quite good. My husband loves spicy, and I enjoy it too, at times, but our 4 year old isn't too hot about it. The 1 tsp curry powder was perfect for us. My son loved the chicken and rice. Only thing I found was that I needed 2 cans of tomatoes and about 2/3 c more water - threw it all in a small stockpot and cooked on the stove. I think I "simmered" at too high heat to get the rice done (20 minutes, just like the box says). All in all, very good. We also decided it needs some sort of vegetable, haven't figured out what yet...

I made a few minor changes, like making the rice in a cooker before adding it to the rest of the mixture.  YUM.  I will make it again

Great but had to cook it another 15 minutes because the brown rice was still hard.

This was a great casserole!  I used farro instead of brown rice and simmered it 10 minutes before baking with the other ingredients.  I didn’t have raisins (we live in our Airstream camper) so I used Craisins— tasty!  This will be one of my go-to oven casseroles to make, especially when it’s chilly.  It warms the trailer and makes it smell wonderful!

I used regular brown rice and baked it longer and turned down temp after 45 min.  Tastes good.  Used chicken leg with thigh attached.  Works great.

I actually like it. I didn't have raisins so I took some from the raisin bread I had and I substituted chicken broth for water. I still added the chicken cube. We all really enjoyed it. I'm glad that I found it!. I also used diced tomatoes from a can. I used chicken drumsticks. In the end i put the rice on plate then drum stick on top and then i poured the tomatoe mix into the entire plate. For the chicken I did do 350 for 45 min then 450 for 20 .it came out crunchy !

SO YUM! We added broccoli and a sliced red bell pepper :) we kept all other ingredients the same as what the recipe called for minus the cup of water and boullion. We went with chicken stock instead. Super duper easy! Transferred the skillet from the stove into the oven. Fool-proof curry.

I followed the instructions to a T. I would make it again, but use more salt and use less curry and less cinnamon. As with any recipe, season to your personal taste.

Edit:  This was great the first day, but when I tried to warm it up the next day it tasted very sour. I think it must have been the lemon juice.  I've been trying to finish it up by eating it cold. I don't like to waste food.

July 23:

This is a great recipe and really simple to make. I replaced the raisins with thinly sliced carrots because I'm not a fan of raisins.  Next time, I might try it with peas.  I'm also thinking that I might omit the oven part and just cook it all on the stove.

Delicious! I didn't have raisins on hand so opted out of putting them in but, followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out amazing. Hubby asked me to definitely make this again, only thing that I will add next time is hot sauce....we're spicy people. Lol Thanks again for this amazing meal idea.

Delicious. We made it exactly as written, and it came out moist and flavorful and there's an added bonus of very little to wash with this recipe. Next time I will hit the stewed tomatoes with my potato masher, as my partner is picky about big chunks, but otherwise we'll definitely be adding this to the rotation.

I made this on the stove top with the rice separate. I couldn't resist adding peppers and onions. I thought the additions of cinnamon, lemon juice,  and raisins elevated this recipe to brilliant. Easy, inexpensive, and healthy make this a regular in the dinner rotation.

The DO loved this.  My 2yr old ate it, but no mmm or yummy from him.  He'll eat as much as a 225lbs man if he likes it enough, so I think he was ok with it.   I thought it had good flavor, but next time I make it I'll definitely season and brown the chicken first as it was somewhat bland when eating a chunk alone.   Also, I think next time I'll serve with sour cream or yogurt as a last minute dolup.

This was really good but I used Ethiopian curry powder.  My face melted.  The next day wasn't too pleasant either.  Next time I'll use regular curry with just a touch of the hot stuff.

I really enjoy the simplicity of this dish. Good flavors, really easy to make.  I use brown rice.  Throw everything in a 13 x 9 and also add some coconut milk. Bake it covered in the oven for about 1.5 hours.  Great as left overs!  I make this at least every 2 weeks.

This is my favorite recipe with curry. It's incredibly easy. I actually use Jamine rice pre cooked in coconut milk and then add it to the curry mixture before baking. This also gives it more liquid to bake with.

We loved it!  I had leftover brown rice and leftover chicken from roasting a couple of chickens.  I used about 6 cups of leftover rice, a 15.5 oz can diced tomatoes (didn't have stewed), and the chicken I had leftover (wished I had had more chicken).  I doubled all the spices for this amount (except only 1 bouillon  cube).  I had to keep adding water to get the right consistency since I was using already cooked rice.  I only wished I had more - we had no leftovers!  I'm going to add it to my regular rotation.

I tried this recipe a few months ago and I have made it at least once a week since. My family loves it. There are a few things I changed. I doubled it up because 4 servings is not enough! I add about half the amount of curry spice. I also boil the chicken (bone in) til it's cooked through, then pull it into chunks instead of cubing raw chicken.  And I just use the broth from the boiled chicken instead of water.

Pronounced a 5* by all who ate it. Made no substantial changes. Might have cooked it 40 instead of 45 min as the chicken might have been a tiny bit dry at 45 min.

by the sounds of the reviews and the ingredients, i thought this recipe would be amazing... It was good, but not as good as it could have been. the chicken needs to be marinated or seasoned or SOMETHING beforehand because it was very bland in the final product. however, the raisins, curry and rice was pretty good. if i tried this again i'd make sure to give the chicken some flavor before mixing it into the casserole. as is, the recipe is very quick and easy.

Added mushrooms and frozen broccoli.  Only added 2 t curry and may only add 1 1/2 next time.  3 is way too much!  My husband said it tasted even better the next day leftover because the flavors had time to meld.  Definitely will make again!

The recipe was easy and it looked very appetizing but the cinnamon flavor was not good at all.  To make it edible, my son and I poured on some hot sauce and some sage, which helped a lot but it was still not very good.

I couldn't believe how easy this was to make, and how well it turned out.  My husband rated it a 4 and-one-half and called it "super".  Will definitely make this again, next time probably for company!

This was awesome. It was a last minute meal, so I didn't have all the right stuff on hand, but I improvised and it turned out really well. I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the boullion. I only had tomato paste, so I used that and added a chopped tomato as well. I also added about 1/3 cup of frozen peas, and half a chopped, sauteed onion. I used white rice since I ran out of brown, and my chicken was already cooked (it was leftovers and was looking pretty dry) so I just shredded it and added it to the mix. I baked it about 35  minutes and voila! It was really delicious and easy. thanks!

I absolutely love this recipe. It does not taste like curry in my opinion, but it's still very good. I do make slight modifications, I omit the boullion (sp?) b/c I try to tightly control the amount of sodium I eat. Also, I don't like raisins so I use dried cranberries instead. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very easy to make. I did have to buy a spice or two that I don't normally have in the house.  Very tasty. Unfortunately, my husband didn't care for it so I won't be able to make it very often.

I made a few alterations ... left out the raisins, used canned diced tomatoes (it's what I had), I also left out the cinnamon, and instead used a curry spice blend that had cinnamon in it (in addition to the curry powder). I added chopped onoins, carrots and potatoes before I baked it. Really good! We will be making this one again!

GREAT recipe!!! So easy and tasted amazing! I substituted curry powder for curry paste, and it worked really well. Even my boyfriend who hates raisins really enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this again!!

Oh my gosh!!  Amazing.  I've never rated a recipe before, but this is truly noteworthy.  So easy, and a great way to use our chicken left from roasting a whole chicken.  I made regular brown rice and added it (1 1/2 c cooked).  This is the best recipe I've ever gotten off of all recipes!!

Awesome!  Added onions and used diced chicken thighs, threw in some extra raisins and almonds at the end - subbed barley for rice for extra fibre.

I was not into the flavor combinations and had to eat it with yogurt to try and tone them down. Sorry, I wont be making this dish again.

It was okay.  I will probably make it again because it's low in fat but full in flavor.  However, it might be too spicy.  The curry overpowers the chicken flavor.  I didn't have any stewed tomatoes on hand (much to my surprise) but i used diced tomatoes instead (which was a 16 oz can), so this might have made a difference.  I also used golden raisins, but I think regular raisins would have been better.  I think it would have provided it w/ a little more of the sweet flavor it needs to counter balance the spicy.  I also would add extra raisins. I still make it occasionally.  I'm always search for low fat spicy dish.
