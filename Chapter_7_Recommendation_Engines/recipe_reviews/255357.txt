I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious! This was my first attempt at making a pie and it was way easier than I thought. I used the premade Marie Calendar's pie crust and used vegan butter and an oil/water wash instead of the egg wash to make it vegan (Marie Calendar's pie crust is vegan as well). I ended up using 3 apples and 2 large pears and I had about half a cup of filling left over. Once everything is peeled and chopped mixing it all up was super easy. I think next time I'll try a crumble on top instead of the pie crust lattice.

All the old-timers say use Granny Smith apples, due to texture and water content.  If you're using what you have, and/or know that it will be too liquid, sift corn starch (1-3 Tablespoons) or add minute Tapioca, to gel.  Berry pie recipes call for 3 Tbsp of either.   Every pie seems to come out different.   This looks like the perfect/traditional apple pie recipe.  But in consideration of everyone's health, less than a cup of sugar is wise.    And avoid crumb toppings on anything, as it is nearly pure sugar.   You don't need it!   Serve the pie warm and put a scoopful of vanilla ice cream (or coconut) instead.    The whole country is becoming Diabetic because we don't watch our sugar intake.    Plus, the lattice looks so great- truly traditional.   The all-American looking pie.

Made the pie for the first time. Followed the directions. Pie tasted great, but much to much liquid when cut into. I would like to make again but need suggestions how to eliminate the liquid the fruit produced.

This was really easy and tastes great!  I bought the pie crusts.   I used 2 Bosc pears and 4-5 small Gala apples, for about 6 cups total.  I added 1/4 tsp allspice.  I covered the top with tinfoil the last 10 minutes of baking, as recommended, as it was starting to burn.  Next time I will cut the sugar back to 3/4 C.    Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious.  I used a premade crust.
