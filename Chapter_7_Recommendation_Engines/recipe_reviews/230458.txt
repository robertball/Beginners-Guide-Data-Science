I was looking for a way to make a baked Monte Cristo as I had an overabundance of deli ham and this fit the bill. I used shredded cheese instead slices as that I'd what I had on hand as well as sprinkled a bit of nutmeg into the  custard base. I served it with a raspberry and maple coulis for dipping. To make it a more authentic Monte Cristo, I may top the ham with deli turkey as well. But this was fantastic, thanks Piques for sharing this recipe!

The only thing I changed was adding in dill instead of mustard powder, which I didn't have. BF liked a lot, and he is picky.

I added a slice of tomato and avocado on top. Will definitely make it again.

I didn't have swiss so I used velveeta. My husband didn't like it but my daughter and I did. I put two pieces together to make a sandwich, sort of stuffed french toast, type. It was a little too cheesy with the velveeta so a white cheese is probably best. May or may not make again.
