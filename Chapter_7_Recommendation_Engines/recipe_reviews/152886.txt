I made this today and it was a HUGE hit!  Followed the recipe exactly... only thing I might change is to add something to spice it up a little just because I like spicy things.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, as I always do the first time I make anything.

For those of us in this house who like onion/green pepper, this was a fabulous dish!  The flavor and texture are wonderful, especially the crispy edges!  Not having creamed corn, I pureed a can of whole corn, drained, and I doubt it made much flavor/texture difference.  I will be making this dish again.

I made this according to the recipe, except I used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup margarine, added 1/4 tsp. pepper, and used 2 cups of cheese instead of 3 cups. It turned out delicious--good flavor, good consistency. We ate it all.

This is a 5 star recipe.   I made it last year for Thanksgiving and I'm being asked to make it again this year.  It's easy to make and if you follow the directions it comes out perfect!

I am nor much of a cook but next time I would like it to be a bit more moist/ fluffy.... it was just a bit dry.  And some jalapeno or at least a can of green chiles might be good in it!

Easy recipe. Great without changes to the recipe. I did add pancetta. Great became greater.

I made this corn casserole as a last minute decision to take to a Thanksgiving potluck. I made as directed except with ready ingredients  I had on hand,such as green onions, 1 can of green chilis,and evaporated milk to which I added 1 teaspoon of white vinegar in substitution of buttermilk and shredded cheddar Monterey Jack cheese. It was well received, even though I felt it needed salt. For my own taste when I make it again for my family Holidays , Iâ€™ll add 1 teaspoon of salt as I thought it was just a tad bland.

Excellent gluten-free option for Thanksgiving and Christmas Day dinner; I have replaced 1/2 of the butter with grapeseed oil to make it a little more heart-healthy and it still tastes great. My family loves this recipe!

Yes I made it this past Thanksgiving and I'm getting ready to make it again to go along with some seasoned pork chops, rice, and green beans with bacon and onions.

I have baked this several times, and it is always requested by my family at the holidays. If you prefer other flavors, add green onions, peppers and even bacon bits. But for us, the original is still the best! Original recipe from Harriet Staley, my school secretary.
