I gave this 3 stars for the recipe as is. But after I added 1/4 teaspoon each of pumpkin spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg I give it 5 stars!! Absolutely scrumptious!!

I doubled this recipe and used it to icing 6 dozen pumpkin cookies I made. The icing was smooth and had great taste. I did add a extra 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. I got the pumpking cookie recipe from this web site.

Delicious Icing!!!  It doesn't take a lot of ingredients and can be used on a number of different baking treats.  I would up the amount of cream cheese depending on which item you're frosting.  I used this for Applesauce Cake V so I used more cream cheese to make it firmer and have more cream cheese taste.

I made this to frost pumpkin pie squares and it was a hit. I added 1 tbsp of milk, to make sure the frosting stayed creamy rather than too firm because I made it the night before.  Was wonderful, I sprinkled orange sugar sprinkles over the top.

If you are looking for cream cheese icing, this isn't it. It's more like cream cheese frosting. I added a lot more cream cheese to make it more like the classic icing your grandma makes.

Yum.  Great on the Pumpkin bars, and I suppose on any other kind of cake.  I followed it as it is printed and it was very tasty.  I added a little tad of 1/2 and 1/2 just to make it easier to mix though.

WOW, thanks sooo much for this recipe.  I was after making a carrot cake when I noticed that I only had about half a container of cream cheese to make the icing.  This recipe made a phenominol cream cheese frosting with very little cream cheese. This will now be the recipe I use all the time :)

This is a very tasty icing.  You can add more cream cheese or more powdered sugar depending on your tastes.  This also works well if you melt the butter and cream cheese and then drizzle over bars or cookies.

Great, easy recipe!  Made this to go with some pumpkin bars I had made and it went with them perfectly.  The only change I did was to use 4 oz of cream cheese instead of the 3.  The icing turns out very smooth and easy to spread.  Thanks!

I used this icing as a filler in between two tiny sugar cookies. This was for a sugar cookie sandwich recipe. For Valentine's Day coming up, I used red food coloring in the icing. I received a lot of compliments on this icing. However, I felt that this icing tasted too much like powdered sugar. This would be a great icing on top of sugar cookes.

I loved this icing!  It came out great, but make sure that you don't add too much water or corn syrup to the mixture.  I put about 10 drops of water in my icing, and the whole thing turned to water, so be very careful.

Used 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese and adjusted the confectionery sugar to make the consistency I like.  Left the butter and vanilla extract amount the same. Also added a little pumpkin spice because I was using it on Pumpkin Bars I. It was delicious.

Delicious! I used this on a Baked Doughnuts recipe to drizzle across the top, and it was scrumptious. I added syrup to half of the batch to give it a different flavor, and it tasted equally delicious. To thin it down enough for drizzling, I added a couple of tablespoons of milk until it reached the desired consistency.

Delicious. I kept sneaking little tastes. Used to top a carrot cake. I actually doubled the recipe, maybe more than doubled since I used an 8-ounce package of cream cheese.

I used Maple extract instead of Vanilla extract, and poured it over the "Pumpkin Cookies V" (which I actually made into a 9x13 cake) recipe on allrecipes.com, and served it for my Dad's birthday cake.  It was like the cake version of a Maple bar.  This amazingly seasonal flavor combination was heavenly perfection!

This was a great frosting for my Applesauce Bars today. I followed the recipe, except I was one ounce short on cream cheese. The icing still turned out excellent & was very smooth & creamy. I will use this often in the future. Thanks.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious!!! As reviewers said before, it does seem like 2 cups of confectioners sugar is going to be too much, but it is perfect! I used real butter and it was so light and fluffy. I used this icing on my pumpkin cupcakes, but this would be great on a variety of things!

Fantastic!

So simple and delicious. I did use a little more powdered sugar, though. 

Goes great with Pumpkin Bars!

I used it to frost gingerbread cookies. Yummy. It reminded me of the frosting used on Cinnabons. Did anyone else think that?

I used this recipe on a carrot cake and put in 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and it was the creamiest, perfect sweetness and flavor icing i've ever had!  I had some leftover icing and used it on cinnamon rolls the next morning for breakfast.  SINFUL!  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was still great.  It does soften up quickly so i wouldn't recommend trying to decorate with it.

Very good on Pumpkin Bars I from this site. I used a 8 oz package but only doubled the other parts so it was a bit cheesier, which went over well in my house. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg - just eyeballed it and tasted it. Very good!!

I too added 1 tsp of milk pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to taste. It was smooth creamy and the perfect  companion to my pumpkin bars. This would be delicious on carrot or spice cake as well.

This was by far the creamiest, most delicious cream cheese icing I've ever made!  So easy to make, and only a few ingredients.  One of the previous reviewers said it is more like a frosting, and they're right.  This is in no way an icing.  Delicious!

Made too go with pumpkin bar recipe from this site.  VERY good, I did use an 8 ounce cream cheese and just a little bit of pumpkin spice coffee creamer, this really added a nice flavor. Thank you
