I found this recipe because I had some frozen shrimp and some frozen, riced cauliflower in the freezer I wanted to use up.  Bingo!

This is a fairly straight-forward recipe, and quick, if you have all the ingredients at hand.  A good mid-week supper.  The recipe says it feeds 4.  My husband and I ate the whole thing as one meal and it was enough.  I think if you were to divide this in 4, you'd need to accompany it with other things (salad, etc...).

I did make a few changes simply because I didn't have all the ingredients it called for -- but it tasted really good.  The changes were minor (didn't have shallot so substituted a small bit of onion).  I think the spices can be increased next time I make it (and yes, there will be next time).  We couldn't taste the paprika at all.  I added what  I thought was plenty of salt and pepper but again, it could use more.  Also more chili flakes if you're into spicy.  I didn't want to overwhelm the shrimp.

For next time, I'll also broil the shrimp/crumb mixture just before serving to crisp up the crumbs a bit.  With al-dente cauliflower and shrimp, having something with a bit of crunch would be nice.

I don't think it needs the extra wedge of lemon -- or only use a small wedge.  

But this is a nice recipe for those who like uncomplicated recipes on a mid-week night when you're tired but want something healthy and comforting to eat!

We didn't make any changes, but might add a little more garlic next time. It was good.
