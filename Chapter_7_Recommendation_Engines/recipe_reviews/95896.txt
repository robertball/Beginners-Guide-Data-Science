My kitchen smelled heavenly while this was roasting, and the flavor did not disappoint!  We had company over and everybody loved it! The only thing I did a little differently was that I added a little oil to the dry rub and made it a paste.  I also found that it took significantly longer than 1 hour 40 minutes to reach the proper internal temperature, but it was worth the wait!

I made this for my in-laws for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was fantastic.  The only thing I did differently, was coat the outside of the roast with Worstershire Sauce, so the rub had something to stick on.

Absolutely wonderful and as Mina stated in the intro.  I sprayed a very light coating of olive oil before applying the rub and let the meat rest about a half hour before putting it in the oven.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so easy. To be honest, I used a variety of herbs, because that's what I had in the pantry(Italian mix-rosemary, thyme, oregano) plus garlic salt, paprika, pepper and a dousing of worcestishire, like another reviwer sugested. It came out perfectly and the herb mixture couting the outside was heavenly. I used the same mixture on some new potatos and roasted them while the roast rested...a perfect and easy meal. Thanks a lot for the recipe, I am no longer afraid I'll ruin a good roast!

This rub was perfect. The rib roast came out tender and juicy. Half of my siblings were dredding the roast, considering that it is usually tough and flavorless, but everyone went back for seconds and said it was delicious!

I made this for Christmas, and everyone enjoyed it.  However, with so much cayenne, this is definitely an adult taste.  You may wish to adjust for younger people, or those that don't go for spicy foods.  The drippings made a fantastic gravy.

OMG this was the PERFECT RIB ROAST! Way better than the one I had at the restaurant the other day! Everyone loved it! THANK YOU! I rubbed it with a little worchestire sauce like another reviewer said, delicious! My brother-in-law who is known as the best cook in the family took home the recipe! Absolutely the best! If I could give this 10 stars I would. Recommend this to all!

I made this tonight for Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING!  I added olive oil as suggested by another reviewer!  My roast was 5.7 lbs and took 2.5 hours to bake in my 2007 Kitchenaid oven.  I served it with sour cream and horseradish - SO good!!!  I may make it again for Christmas! Thank you so much for a new family favorite!

I cooked the rib roast for the first time and I decided to make it for the thanksgiving dinner. My house smelled soooooo gooooooooood for 2 1/2 as the meat was roasting that I started to receive complements from my family before everybody tried it. :) The only things that I changed in the recipe were:
1. 4 pounds of the meat is not enough for 10 servings. So, if you have a large party, buy more meat.
2. I marinated the meat 24 hrs in advance.
3. I added more garlic. 
FIVE STARS! Juicy, Soft, and DELICIOUS!

I must have done something wrong --- roast was tender, however no flavor -- I followed the receipe, but the sauce was unable to get down into the the roast -- it was just a plain roast unless you scooped some of the sauce off the top and ate it with each bite.

This was so easy and very good. Tender, full of flavor. The roast was 3.5 lbs and the hour and 40 was perfect for medium rare (more rare). A huge hit.

This was fantastic! In the mix I added al the ingredients above and the ones I added were Italian, Oregano, Thyme, Rosemary, Marjoram, Anchillo chilli pepper. I lowered the temp after an hour to 300 degrees let it cook for another hour. It was wonderful! The Outer coating had some bite and was delish!

It was wonderful! The aromas in the kitchen were amazing and my husband was drooling looking at the prime rib thru the glass in oven door.  Had an 8.81 lb rib roast and cut off the bones and seasoned them then placed them back under the meat.   Two hole hours after the initial 20 minutes on 500 then lowered temperature to325 to finish cooking. Served with oven roasted smashed fingerling potatoes and a mix if spring peas and asparagus with honey and fresh thyme ! Scrumptious

130 to 140 is medium rare. 140 to 150 is medium. (325 for 17 to 20 mins/lb is my way). It will rise at least another 5 degrees as it rests (15-20)...but put a loose tent of foil on it. The suggested temp. of this recipe yields closer to a well done, drier roast (if you like a beautiful cut that way). Spices are okay for prime rib...but sea salt and cracked pepper are still the best for this naturally, wonderfully tasty cut. If you want spices, omit the cayenne....or better yet...enjoy the roast the way it should be and spice up a sauce to serve on the side for those curious eaters.

I used the spice recipe in this recipe but added oregano and thyme.  I had to double the amount for a 2 bone four pound roast.  I used the left over spice to season potatoes I roasted along with the meat.  This roast turned out delicious!! I cooked my roast differently.  I have a convection oven and I pre-heated my oven to 450 and roasted the meat for 15 min.  I then lowered the temperature to 275 like another commentor recommended.  I cooked it slow until it registered 130 degrees which took about an hour and half.  I let sit tented under aluminum foil for 30 min.  The roast was perfect.  The seasoning perfect!

My 5 stars are for the rub. I made a boneless pork rib roast, but used the recipe for this rub. I first massaged the roast with extra virgin olive oil, and then the rub. The roast was delicious! I will use this rub in different applications from now. Thanks for the recipe!

Too spicey I think some of spices could be cut in half to hot for our pallets, but glad I tried it.
