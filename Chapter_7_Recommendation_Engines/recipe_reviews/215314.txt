I have been making these for years.  Just make sure the potatoes are complety dry, from washing them, before rubbing with oil.  I have used canola oil, as well.  I have never wrapped the potatoes in foil, just rub with oil, salt & pepper and drop them into the crockpot.  Wonderfully fresh smell and taste, so different from oven baked. Thanks for the reminder to make these more often.

Baking potatoes in the slow cooker sounds great!  However, one reviewer said she had a roast in the oven all day, at a low temp.  It is just as easy to add foil wrapped potatoes to the 5-hour oven baking project.  They cook just fine at the lower temp and long baking period.  I'm 74 years old, do it all the time, as did my Mother years ago.  Works great...saves time, space, etc.  You can oil the potatoes before putting in the foil if you wish.

I am known as the queen of crockpot cooking in my family, if it can be done in a crockpot, I will do it.  I have 5 crockpots, and use them all, all the time!  However, I have never tried this recipe, until this past weekend.  And now I am a believer!  I HATE baking potatoes.  They just never come out perfect, so I always end up buying the ones you do in the microwave that are wrapped in plastic.  Not anymore...I loved these!  I scrubbed, let dry, and then rubbed w/ olive oil and kosher salt.  I did not wrap in foil, but they turned out fine.  Cooked on High for 4 1/2 hours then removed the lid and let them cool for a bit, and they were perfect.  Mine weren't "soggy" like some reviewers mentioned, but it might have been b/c I didn't wrap in foil.  Not sure, but I will make my potatoes like this many more times!  Thanks!!!

I also add a butternut squash in the crock pot with a few potatos.  You can just put it in whole, no need to peel it or cut in half and wrap in foil if you have a smaller crockpot.  When it is done, just scoop out seeds, then scoop out all the flesh, add butter, nutmeg and cinnamon.  When I come home I have my potato and vegetable, to me the hard and time consuming parts of preparing supper.

Awesome! Who knew you could make baked potatoes in the slow cooker? These tasted great. I washed my potatoes and let them dry. Then I sprayed my crockpot with cooking spray, rubbed my potatoes down with olive oil, pricked them with a fork, and cooked them for a few hours on low. They were soft but not mushy, and had a much better taste than "baked" potatoes from the microwave.

As with any potato cooked in foil, they are steamed, not baked.   Still a good way to make them while you are away.  But nothing beats baking a potato at 400-425 degrees for an hour unwrapped.....there is a difference in texture.

Good, easy recipe, however I prefer the crispy skin from baking the potatoes-just my personal preference.
Note to prior reviewer "CB"- you'll read plenty about the health benefits of Canola Oil,but FYI: There is no such thing as a "Canola Plant"...so know that Canola oil is processed from rapeseed plants, much the same way margerine is processed. Remember when they said margerine was better for you than butter? I didnt buy that logic then either and now we know that's not true! Olive Oil is healthier. Go natural.

I did this to make Mashed potatoes.After they are done cooking in the crock pot I remove the foil add the milk and butter and mash away. I Personally use a pot to do the mashing in.
 After taking a food science class I learned that you never want to microwave any food and boiling will take most of the nutrient out of the potato and it ends up in the water. I also learned that cooking food at a lower temperature helps to insure that you keep the nutrient from the food in the food. So I got a slow cooker and loving the new way to make Mashed potatoes and other amazing meals.

I don't know what the hype is about these potatoes. I made them today because I was making a slow cooked roast chicken in the oven today that took 5 hours. I figured I could get the potatoes started also. If the potatoes are well wrapped it is very easy clean-up. I do like my restaurant style oven baked potatoes much better! But, this was convenient for my needs today. I used a medium potato, so I cooked 6.5 hours on high. When done I served with a little butter and sour cream. For conveninets sake it would also work well if I had to work all day and put them in in the morning. The interior was a little discolored but was really soft like a mashed potato. The skin though was soggy and not so good. It worked fine for me today, so I might do it again if the oven is being used all day at a lower temperature.

Such a great idea! I followed another reviewer's advice and rubbed the scrubbed potatoes with oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, then placed them in the slow cooker without wrapping in foil. This was great on a day when I knew I was serving steak, but wouldnot be home in time to prep and cook potatoes. I made extra and served home fries with another meal later in the week. Thanks for the greta idea!

Wish I had known about this earlier! They turned out great!!!  I will be making these often, when I have a meat in my second crock pot.....(sometimes the potatoes can absorb too much of the flavor when they are all put in one dish)

Great recipe for classic comfort food! I haven't done this in years, as I'm so used to doing them on the grill, or cheating and doing them in the microwave! But, my husband really wanted that "old school" baked potato so I thought I'd indulge him. And, just as Nurse Ellen states - this was super easy without heating up the kitchen! These were soooo good - especially with all the fixen's: butter, salt, pepper, bacon bits, chives, and a little sour cream! Simply perfect!

This is a great way to do up potatoes... 
first time the potatoes had over cooked
where they touched either the sides or 
bottom of crock pot... now I use a small 
wire rack on the bottom... and for my 
small crock pot... I used a few pieces of 
foil balled up loosely to keep the potatoes 
off the bottom.... worked great! could not
be more pleased... thanx

The potatos turned out perfect cooked this way.  Much better texture than cooked in the microwave.  I used Canola Oil to reduce transfats.  I prefer Canola over Olive oil.

These are great!  I did not cover in foil to have the crispy outside.  I also used both regular and sweet potatoes.  No fuss, all yum.  Thanks for the recipe.  UPDATE:  I used the leftover (next day after being refrigerated) of these - both sweet and regular potatoes - for gnocchi and they worked perfectly!!  15/7/14:  added a few whole, cleaned onions which turned out wonderfully fragrant and with a slightly roasted flavour.  Didn't use foil around them either.

These are wonderful! I'm trying to liven up my packed lunches while saving time in the morning. I put these on the night before and they are perfect grab and go on the way out the door. With just a minute in the microwave and some pre-shredded cheese they make a delicious and filling packed lunch! Next I'll put these on before work and come home to half my dinner ready to go!

Easy Peasy baked potatoes. Moist and cooked through centres. 3.5hrs on high for 6 large potatoes(No foil or piercing). Then under the highest grill setting for 15mins, turning once. Finished them off nicely; giving them a charred and crispy, oven baked outer skin. Yum! Kids loved them, nothing left on the plate; no higher compliment in my house. New to Slow cooker cooking and loving the convenience and versatility of cuisine that can be cooked in these.

I make these every week. So simple and delicious! You really don't even need the salt and oil, if you are in a hurry. If you work all day, buy an outlet timer and you can program it so your crock pot comes on at just the right time, so they won't overcook, but be ready for dinner time.

I was surprised by these after having read the reviews.  I did not think they were as good as a potato out of the oven.  The convience of these, however, was great!
(I personally like how oven baked potatoes give you a very soft inside with a crispy shell)

I didn't really think I'd like these potatoes, but I wanted to try anyway, and I surprised myself--I really like them!  You do not get the crust I like from baking, but I thought they were pretty decent, easy potatoes.  I left off the foil and used some smaller red potatoes, cooked on high for about 2 hours with the crock pot half full, and ended up with nicely steamed, perfectly cooked red potatoes.  Great if I'm out of room in the oven or just feel like steamed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for the first time last night.  They turned out great!
Tips:  Potatoes need to be completely dry ~ Do not wrap in foil ~ Slather in butter &/or olive oil ~ S&P the outsides ~ My potatoes were on the med to smaller side. They were done in 3.5 hours on high ~ The last 30 mins of cooking I took the lid off completely and the potatoes got crispy on the outside (rotating once).
I will be doing this again!  Thank you for  the recipe.  Side note: I have a Hamilton Beach 6qt Programable Cooker.

I was surprised at how good these turned out. I followed the recipe (minus the foil) and used 4 potatoes in a larger (5 qt) crockpot, which is why I think they cooked quicker. I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours and they turned out perfectly. I noticed they were pretty soft after 3 hours so they probably would've been fine if I had taken them out even earlier. I have had problems finding just the right temp and time to cook baked potatoes in both the microwave as well as oven, but the crock pot method seemed to lock the moisture in and cook everything evenly. Once they were done, I added a little extra salt/ pepper, butter, and shredded cheese and they tasted soooo good! I think this is the best basic baked potato recipe I've come across and will definitely try again, with more potatoes next time.

These were super easy and yummy! I did 2 potatoes and 3 sweet potatoes for 7 1/2 hours. Yes, the insides of the potatoe was discolored but it didn't alter the taste. The sweet potatoes were Devine! Thank you so much for the easy, wonderful idea!

I love this method of making baked potatoes! I realize, it isn't that hard to make them in the oven. But this way, they are ready the moment you walk in the door. On my really lazy days, I do a baked potato bar for dinner with these and a few toppings made ahead of time. Yummy! Thanks for sharing, Nurse Ellen!

I make this recipe all the time, but do not use the foil. I put the potatoes on the rack that comes with my slow cooker. The skin is nice and crisp. I use the olive oil with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. I try to keep the spuds all the same size and they are done in 4-4- 1/2 hours on high. Left over spuds make great home fries. Make sure to prick the spuds with a fork.

I have baked unwrapped potatoes for years in a dry crock pot. The dry method seems to concentrate the flavor. Often we will have regular and sweet potatoes or yams for the 'grownups'. Bette gave me the awesome idea of putting a whole winter squash in to bake, as well. 
Once it is done and tender, it's far easier to cut, scoop the seeds and season. you can also peel and dice for a different presentation. I'm going to try roasting whole rutabagas as well.

I do this, and love it. Don't forget that it also works with sweet potatoes. They come out great, and I serve with butter and cinnamon sugar to taste.

Came out perfectly.  I think they're much better than microwave potatoes, but if you're looking for a dry potato with crisp skin stick with oven baked.  I am using these for potato soup so they're perfect.  They also have a more intense potato flavor than baked in the oven.  I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe is genius! I never have time to put baked potatoes in the oven, and the microwave just isn't the same. I rubbed these with EVOO (though I would use a more neutral flavored oil next time since the oil was pretty strong tasting), and didn't wrap them in foil. I cooked on low about 7 hours, and while I couldn't expect the skins to be crispy, they weren't soggy either. The only thing that made this a 4* was the strong EVOO. If I used vegetable oil, or perhaps even skipped the oil next time, it would be a 5* recipe.

This was okay for a busy day as the effort was minimal (I didn't bother with the foil) and my kids and husbands ate their potatoes up. In general, we prefer the crisp, chewy crust and steamy interior of a baked potato, but I would defintely use this method again on a busy day.

.For those debating:
I used the low setting and the 5 medium potatoes were all cooked through. In this methd, the skin  becomes moist and tender and  the interior gets fluffier than a microwaved potato but a more moist and dense than an oven baked potato. The inside also takes on a tanish/light brownish shade which my kids didn't seem to notice. I would definitely recommend trying this on your family before presenting to guests. 

Overall, we weren't wowed by the potatoes, but they were fine for a weeknight dinner.

Have tried this several times.  Each time the potatoes were soggy and tasted steamed.  You get much better results in the microwave.

Great way to not heat up the kitchen in the summer.  I agree that it's just as easy to bake them in the oven with a roast, but if you aren't planning to heat up the oven, this is great!

I have often baked potatoes in my crockpot overnight and did not wrap them in foil...just put them in and slow cooked.  Foil wrap steams the potato so imo it is better to leave off the foil

Please, please, please don't call this a "baked" potato.  It is a cooked/steamed potato & probably is not much worse than a microwaved potato but still a far cry from baking in an oven (or over coals for the adventurous).  "Baking" requires dry & open heat to allow the moisture to escape.  Any time you wrap in foil or cook in a small, enclosed space you are completely changing the texture of the potato (not for the better).

This worked perfectly!  Had some super large bakers and instead of putting in the oven for hours, put in the slow cooker and they came out great.  Just right for the Super Bowl baked potato bar.  Will make baked potatoes this way again.  Saves space in the oven and would be great way to keep the kitchen a little cooler in the Summer. Great idea!

I followed the directions exactly and the potatoes were overcooked.  The skins looked black.  The potatoes were brown in color and not white like when baked another way.  They tasted okay.  I didn't have to throw them out.  Won't do them in the slow cooker again.  They're much better in the microwave or oven.

This is a super easy way to have some nice hot potatoes waiting at home after a long day at work (or, in my case, school). I topped off these potatoes with soy chorizo and light sour cream. This became a delicious, low calorie vegetarian dinner!

What a fantastic idea! No need to change a thing, this worked perfectly as is. I wanted to have my baked potatos ready when I returned from shopping and stumbles across this recipe. My potatos were in the crockpot several hours longer than I had intented and the skins were only a little tough on the bottom. I will definately be doing this again. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

Well, you learn something new everyday!  I've been cooking for over 30 years and have never cooked "baked" potatoes in a crock pot until today.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and included a whole butternut squash and (since I had one) a large, whole beet.  The results were outstanding for all the vegetables.  Great flavor and great texture. (And the aroma in the kitchen was out-of-this-world!)  My family concurred that they preferred the results of these slow-cooked vegetables to oven baked. That was quite a surprise to me -- I didn't think they'd notice.  This recipe is a keeper!  It's wonderful for those days when you're out or when, like today, I was grilling outside and didn't want to run back and forth to fuss with a variety of side dishes.  Thank you, Nurse Ellen, for sharing!!!

I have been cooking potatoes this way for quite a while. I dont wrap them in foil.  Try it with a sweet potato!! They cook faster than potato. Usually 3 hrs. yum yum I use crock pot. I dont put anything on them while they cook. Natural and low calorie.

How have I never known you can cook baked potatoes in the crock and why would I ever cook them any other way?  These turned out wonderfully.  I cooked them on low for about 8 hours.  I used my *normal* sized round crock pot and only 2 potatoes w/no issues.  This WILL get a lot of use in our house.  THANKS for the recipe, Nurse Ellen!

I wrap my potatoes in foil after rinsing, dry off a little, next I take the corn, butter it, wrap in foil, then add potatoes and corn to the crock pot, and cook on high for 3 hours. Delicious!!!

These turn out perfect every time.  Made them again last night and it was requested for today's meal also.  That's awesome coming from a 7 and 4 year old.

These were OK and I'll do them again if I don't have room in the oven. It is convenient to just put them in and not have to think about them. But, the skins were moist, not dry and crispy like we like them to be.

Good but not great...these are essentially STEAMED potatoes rather than BAKED. The best baked potatoes are simply baked in the oven at a high temperature in order to crisp the skin. Wrapping a potato in foil steams them in the first place.

I used new red potatoes, rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with Italian seasonings.  Foil is not necessary.  Potatoes were excellent and everybody loved them. When I make only a few potatoes I use high heat for 2 1/2 hours.  When I have a crockpot full I use high heat for about 4 hours.

Who knew???  Ever since I came accross this recipe, I have been making baked potatoes this way.  Tried them with and without the foil. Much better WITH the foil, although I don't put anything on them when cooking. I cook on high for 5 hours, then the slow cooker automatically goes to warm.  I usually do 4 potatoes at a time, this way we always have some potatoes ready for breakfast that can just be shredded, diced or sliced.

Yes, Yes, Yes...our absolutely favorite way to make potatoes when we are gone all day.  8 0r 9 hours on low, and they are SO tender and tasty.  I do use sea salt, and the kitchen smells so good!

The recipe book that came with my cooker included using it for baked potatoes, so I've been doing that for a while now. But it didn't include the oil and salt. I'm trying it right now. I think using the aluminum foil is a must. Once the potatoes are cooked, the skin is so soft that it's practically falling apart. You need the foil to give it some structure while eating it. And it helps keep the pot clean, as some liquid will weep from the fork piercings.

Easy to make but needed quite a long time in the crockpot to cook all the way through. Some of mine were cold when I served them. I'd use an oven as my first preference unless it's the middle of summer.

I agree with Willie, crock pot cooked taters sound wonderful and I'm going to try it, but I've always foil wrapped my taters with canola margarine instead of oil and baked them right along with the roast.  They always come out great!  I remember my mother had some steel rods she'd poke through the middle of the bigger potatoes to help them cook better.  I was never able to find those potato rods anywhere!  I think my Dad made them for her!

No need to wrap in foil. All I do is wash the potatoes, dry, rub with small amount of  oil,  season, pierce them, bake 4 to 5 hours on low in the crock pot, or until fork tender.

We made these on a camping trip.  Our campsite had electricity so I wanted to make something easy in the crock.  This was perfect with our grilled steaks.

I have done both sweet potatos and regular ones in the crockpot for years.  But do not wrap in foil or rub with oil.  Simply wash well, plop them in, and let it go.  I usually do two for hubby and me and about two to two and a half hours does it.

I cooked three large baking potatoes on low for 7-1/2 hours.  They were cooked perfectly.  Based on other reviews - I decided not to wrap in foil and just rub in the olive oil and salt and put straight into the slow cooker.  The outside had a slight crisp to it that we liked, but, wasn't as crunchy as you get in the regular oven.  This would definitely be a big help if you are cooking something at a different temperature in the oven than the potatoes would need to cook.

What a novel way to make baked potatoes.  Not sure why I never thought of doing this.  Thanks, Nurse Ellen, I’m glad you did and shared how to!  I fixed ‘Country Rib Delight’ from AR and added a salad and these baked potatoes to the meal.  The meal was wonderful and the potato was my favorite part.  Not sure I’ll ever bake potatoes in the oven again.  The skins were so nice and soft and we loved the salt on them.  Thanks again, Nurse Ellen for sharing!! :o)

I made this recipe as is and my potatoes were perfectly cooked and delicious! I was "baking" potatoes in the microwave before and they were ok but I will be slow cooking them from now on. A previous reviewer suggested making mashed potatoes in the slow cooker after baking so I think I will try that next.

Great way to do bake potatoes, but I have never in my life wraped a potato in tin foil, when you do this, you are "steaming" the potatoe, not baking them.I think it makes a difference.

I'm going to give this five stars because I think baked potatoes in the crock are awesome!  Technically they are not baked but oh so good.  I use butter on them instead of the oil.  But, I've done this forever . . . they come out so melt in your mouth good and you can't over do them.  They stay soft and moist; the skin is just as good and easy to eat.  When I do crock potatoes, they are a main dish -- throw whatever bits of leftover, etc on them and ta da!  But, I like like my simple with butter, salt and pepper. Yum!

I LOVE wacky recipes and this caught my attention. I placed the potatoes on their ends and turned them after about 6 hrs to soften the other ends. They were quite large and took 7 hrs. They came out great. Perfect for space and/or heat saving in the kitchen.  I miss them being dry and crispy on the outside so I may experiment with putting them under the broiler for a couple of minutes.

I wanted to have steak and baked potatoes when we got home from church, but didn't want to wait for the oven to preheat and take the time for the potatoes to bake. I also didn't want to heat up the kitchen in the middle of a Phoenix summer. I thought Slow cooker, but didn't know how it would work. I headed for AR. I did 3 potatoes approximately 8oz each. Rubbed them with olive oil and sprinkled with kosher salt. I placed them on crumpled foil, unwrapped, and cooked on high for 4 hours in a 3 quart slow cooker. They were perfectly done when we got home. I placed them in the oven @ 200° long enough to grill the steaks. The skins were not as crispy as totally baking them in the oven but they did dry out a bit more than when I first took them out of the slow cooker. Will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks for the time and settings.

I enjoyed the ease of preparation for this recipe.  It is not my preferred method of doing baked potatoes but I will definitely make it again if.. a) I need a large amount of baked potatoes for a gathering - I have 4 crockpots.  b) if it's too danged hot to bake them in the oven or c) the oven is otherwise occupied.   I should also add that I've done this with sweet potatoes as well.  Definitely worth keeping the recipe on hand for when baking potatoes or sweet potatoes in the oven just isn't ideal.

I followed directions exactly, cooking my potatoes 4 hours on high but they were overcooked. I suppose it depends on how large/small the potato is as to how long they need to cook in the slow cooker. I'm sure with practice these will come out perfectly and be a time saver for busy days. I topped mine with Reduced Fat Yogurt Ranch Salad Dressing instead of butter and sour cream to make them lighter in calories.

Delicious! For times sake I usually make my potatoes in the microwave. But I will use the slow cooker from now on. I sprayed my potatoes with Olive Oil baking spray after washing. I forgot to poke holes in them, but I will try that next time. I did sprinkle sea salt all over, and then wrapped them in aluminum foil. Baked 4 large potatoes for 8 hours on low, and they were great.

I love these potatoes. At our house we like fried potatoes but I do not like to pay the price to get them in a bag. By putting potatoes in the crock pot like this I can have what ever I want for dinner that night whether it be twiced baked fried or just regular baked. I have cooked potatoes on hand all the time. Cut time in half when I am cooking dinner. Not to mention these potatoes make a good quick potato soup when you remebered to put them on but forgot to lay out the meat for dinner that night. This is never fail way to always have cooked potatoes when you need them without the wait.

I tried these potatoes and they were very easy. It freed up my oven which really helped. The only thing I changed was I didn't wrap them in tin foil. They were excellent, but I still like the crispy skin you get from the oven.

These worked well in a pinch if you're really busy and want baked potatoes for supper but they were kind of soft, not like a "baked in the oven" baked potato.

Made these exactly as the recipe instructed and the only thing I would have changed was the cook time (I did 5 hours on high, should have gone to 5 and a half or 6 hours for softer taters). Otherwise these were lovely!

Excellent recipe.  I added a 4” sprig of fresh rosemary, whole, on top of the potatoe before wrapping in foil.  After baking chuck the rosemary as it has done its job of flavoring the potatoe. Great taste without sour cream & extra butter all by itself.

Not at all necessary to wrap in aluminum foil (and I don't like aluminum to touch my food anyway).  I cook mine on low.  If you will be away a longer time, just get bigger potatoes and/or put on a rack in the slow cooker.  Works well for sweet potatoes too.  (and uncut butternut or acorn squash too just stab it like you do the potato).  I baked two of them not long ago and then threw them in my air fryer for a few minutes to crisp up the skin (the best part) - worked great!!!!!! No need to oil and salt either, but it is good that way.

I don't think I'll ever use a microwave to cook my baked potatoes again! We didn't ever use the oven to make baked potatoes and we hated how they came out of the microwave. So, I was excited to see this recipe on the site. I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I needed foil or not and if I should brush them with oil or not. Turns out, I don't think it really matters (at least to us). I used three medium sized red potatoes. I cooked one in foil without oil, one in foil that had been brushed with olive oil and the third was brushed with oil but not covered in foil. When they were done, I couldn't tell the difference. I cooked them on high because I got started late - I think they were cooking for 2.5 - 3 hours on high and then I turned it down to low. Super easy. I did wash them and let them dry before placing in the slow cooker. I forgot to add the salt and pepper, but really, they were cooked perfectly and tasted good. Thanks for the recipe!

Follow the instructions, but forget about the foil.  The reason restaurants use foil is is because potatoes have close to an hour cooking time and they can't be cooked to order. Foil conducts heat, and so it helps keep the potato hotter for longer, meaning they don't have to.  But, foil keeps the heat from penetrating the potato's skin so they don't get crispy and crunchy if they're in the oven, and unnecessary in a slow cooker.

The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because if you're going to bake potatoes in a slow cooker, you don't need foil.  As others have pointed out, potatoes wrapped in foil even when cooked in an oven, are steamed.  You can steam potatoes in a slow cooker without wrapping them in foil , which is what I did and they came out great.  I washed the potatoes and did not dry them, placed them in my slow cooker and followed the rest of the instructions and ended up with delicious moist potatoes. Will make again.

I  didn't make any changes and I will make it again. After the potatoes were done, I scooped out the flesh, added sour cream, butter, salt, pepper, and grated cheese. Stirred the combined ingredients and replace them in the potato skins.  I recovered them with the foil and placed them back in the slow cooker on low for about 30 minutes.  Delicious.

Perfect potatoes every time!  We use this recipe for big family meals at the cabin.  12-14 potatoes for about 7 hours on high is perfect.

I did not make any changes.  I always like to try the recipe first without making any changes.  Second time around I might experiment with one or two of my own ideas.  That's what makes cooking so fun!

So easy, my favorite way to make baked potatoes. If I set it at noon for dinner I feel like I am less antsy for it to be done then when I use an oven for an hour. Plus since its wrapped in tin foil inside the slow cooker it has no clean up. I just wipe it out.

Oh, My GOODNESS, this could not have been any easier  and delicious. I made two large baked potatoes and they were done to perfection. Like many others, I tend to shy away from baking potatoes in the oven, because of the time, temp and heat. And the microwave potatoes just lack that little something. Hands down this a great alternative.
Thank you for sharing.

Love how easy this was. They steam but the skins don't get crunchy so I sautéed them for a few minutes after to get a bit of flavor and on the outside.

keep checking potatoes for done. A smaller potato  will cook much faster than large ones. Other than that, a great recipe.

This recipe was great for its convenience.  They cooked while at church and dinner was ready when we arrived home.  I did not wrap the potatoes in foil but rather just used olive oil, sea salt, and pepper.  The outside was crispy and the inside was cooked well.  The color was a little off but everyone still enjoyed them.  I still prefer baked potatoes in the oven but this works well when you don't want to fuss too much.

Prepared exactly as written and we did not enjoy these. Perhaps I’ll try again in a different slow cooker in case that was the cause of the poor turnout. Although they cooked for the recommended time, they were not cooked through.

My oven door is broken these days and while I am waiting for the new range to be delivered I am learning new ways of using my crock pot and my grill... This recipe  is as simple as baking the potatoes in the oven. I prepared the potatoes as the recipe stated, omitting the foil, sprayed the slow cooker with some avocado oil, put them in and started the timer. My potatoes were medium size so I check on them after 2 h 30 min on Hi and they were done. I switched the setting to warm and left them in till dinner time. It's good to know that if your oven is busy and baked potatoes are part of the menu that you have the alternative of making them in the slow cooker.

either way, slow cooker or oven, use bacon grease instead of oils. after slow cooker put in over to crisp the skin with the broiler on high for a few min per side.

Next time I’ll use smaller potatoes or plan to cook a little longer. I cooked corn on the cob (in the husk, but trimmed on both ends) together with the potatoes and it turned out perfect. I’ll definitely do this again!

Will definitely do this again! Six large potatoes ready after a day out. Zapped some of the toppings, cut up others and ready to eat in no time,  and no heating up the kitchen on a hot summer day.

You really don't need to sprinkle the potatoes with olive oil or put any salt on them....just do what I do and wrap them in foil and throw them in the crock pot. Take one out when it's hot out some butter sour or cheddar cheese on it wrap it back up and let melt. It's very good. ^_^

Potatoes turned out fine but having no liquid in the crockpot caused the crock to crack. So I won’t be doing this again

This is a great recipe for busy evenings. The potatoes come out amazing & I can prep the potatoes the night before & cook them all day & pair them with a main & side in 20 min or make them a main smothered in toppings to suit each family member in less than 20 min. Thanks for sharing!

This  easy recipe makes steamed potatoes with soft, delicious skin. We enjoyed the potatoes and I will make them again and again. It would be easy to change up the taste. Next time I plan to use garlic salt. I've looked at my spice shelf with new eyes! Seasoning blends would work well too.  These potatoes are good, but they don't have the flavor of oven baked potatoes.

Made this last night and the potatoes turned out GREAT!!! I didn't have time to be at home to bake them in the oven, so I looked up this recipe and I'm glad I did. Our company liked them too! I used butter instead of Olive Oil and I didn't wrap them in foil. I did take the advice of some other reviews and crumbled up some foil in the bottom of my crock pot to keep the potatoes from touching the bottom and becoming over done. Worked great! I cooked 8 medium & small potatoes for 4 hours. Thanks for the recipe!!

It was good, but not amazing. The bottom part of all the potatoes ended up becoming stiff and hard to break through. The slow cooker also had a burning smell (I did it on high for 4.5hrs). It still tasted good overall.

I followed the instructions and left these in for 7 hours on low.  They were extremely overcooked and had a flavor and texture that was terrible.  I was so embarrassed as I had made them for a family function.  Will never make again!!

Perfectly done "baked" potatoes. Be careful not to add too much oil when you rub it on or it will drip when you open the foil. Better the first day than the 2nd day. Dried out a little overnight in the fridge (the leftovers).

I liked these a lot. The cooking method and i guess the olive oil gives them a really nice flavor, and wrapping them in foil reduces cleanup to zero (that's my kinda cleanup).

Good if you are gone all day or don't want oven on for just a few potatoes.  Addition of kosher salt was good.

These were just okay... Somewhat dry in the middle and steamed skins. Also, the discoloration of the potato was not just an appearance thing as they tasted very "earthy." It was easy and will probably make the cut for a once in a while thing, but definitely not my favorite way of making "baked" potatoes.

These are probably the best potatoes I have had! The olive oil and salt soak into the potatoes and make them moist with a bit of a taste of saltiness. They are moist, salty and go good with any other potato garnish you choose. Use sour cream, butter, bacon bits, cheese or whatever is to your liking! It is a must try, you will love them!

Loved this! Why have I never thought of cooking potatoes in the micro?! Four stars only because nothing beats a real "baked" potato. Thanks for sharing!

My understanding is you just lay the potatoes in the crockpot without any type of water in the pot. When reading this I was afraid everything would burn without something, like water, in the crockpot with them. I am going to have to try this.

These didn't turn out as good as I had hoped.  They were too soft on the outside and still hard in the middles.
