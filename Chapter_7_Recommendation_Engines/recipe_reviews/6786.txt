I should have paid attention to the other reviews before I attempted this recipe.  Don't yeast doughs usually need "rise time"?  I can not even describe what we pulled out of the oven, needless to say the kids would not touch it.  I have a feeling something was missing from the instructions or maybe left out of the ingredient list.

Glad I read the reviews before attempting this one!

I did read some similar recipes and revised this one so that it would turn out.

Revised to: 2T oil & 1 egg (or eggwhite)!
            Add Cinnimon with dry ingredients!
            After mixing all together, turn out on floured surface and knead for 8-10 min, let rest 15 min.  Then cut into portions.  After bagel shapes are made, let rise 20 min.  Then do the boiling method shown in the other similar recipes, and bake only 30-35 min!

After making many yeast breads, I thought the original of this recipe was way out of line in its ingredients!

HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!  I think something is missing or misprinted in the recipe.  These so-called bagels turned out to be hard, dry,very salty and nonedible.  My kids wanted nothing to do with them & I don't blame them.  I wish I had read the reviews first.

I think this recipe has possibilities. 3 tablespoons of salt just about did us in. Some of us perservered!! An hour is about 30 minutes too long to bake them. Is somebody out there just having fun?

This is not a good recipe for bagels, came out very hard. The 'Bread Machine Bagels' on this site is a good recipe if you want homemade bagels. And waaayyyy too much salt!

Too much salt. You need just one teaspoon. Not enough liquid. In other words liquid=1/2 the weight of the flour.  Example: for 1 lb. flour use 1/2 lb. liquid, approximately.
