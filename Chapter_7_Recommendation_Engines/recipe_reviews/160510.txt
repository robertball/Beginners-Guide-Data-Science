This was a great dip.  I also added 1 tsp of cayenne powder to the sour cream mixture to give it a little more zip.  I added chopped green onions also.  A huge hit!!

This is delicious.  Made this reduced (dramatically) for a quick afternoon snack.  Perfect and tastes exactly as the name implies.  Thanks for the post.
