My family asks for this dish each holiday.  Definitely thaw the frozen hash browns in the fridge the night before.  I've made a double batch using the 'family size' 26 oz can cream of mushroom soup, soup can full of milk and a 30-32 oz bag of hash brown shreds, doubling the other ingredients and baking in two casseroles.  We generally use white or yellow onion instead of green.

As "Jazzy-Girl" stated: this is not for those watching their diet. I made it even worse b/c I had 1/2 cup of half & half I needed to use up and added that in (BUT the rest of the milk I used was skim...come on-I have to justify myself somehow!) Also, I didn't have cheddar crackers so I used "Town House" butter crackers. I did have to bake it a tad longer but very good! We really like this recipe alot. Thanks Mary Ann!!

This recipe is great just as written.  Everyone I served it to could not get enough.  I have substituted both Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken (when I didn't have mushroom in the pantry).  Still tastes great.  Also, I used a white cheddar cracker (Cheese-it brand, mostly) and prefer that over the cheddar cracker myself.  I usually use the recommended 1-1/3 cups of milk but you might want to increase that if you prefer a creamier texture to your dish when finished baking.  THANKS Mary Ann!!

Can you believe this is the first time I've ever had a hash brown casserole?  This is so simple and very good!!  The under five set in the house even ate the green peppers!

This was really good!  My kids picked out the green pepper but otherwise liked it. I didn't cook it in the skillet but mixed it in the casserole dish and baked it.

Super yummy recipe! Fairly easy to make. They paired well with my meatloaf. I was looking for a way to jazz up some potatoes for my grandpa who is having trouble getting motivated to eat since his recent surgery and this recipe did the trick! Thanks a million!

We had these for a family dinner and thought they were very special.  We used red pepper instead of green and they were pretty as well as tasty.

It's hard to give a fair review, since I made so many changes. I used bread crumbs instead of cheese-flavoured crackers, diced fresh potatoes in place of frozen hashbrown, and baked for 50 min to make sure potatoes cooked through. Turned out reasonably ok, although a little bland, but I might only fault the recipe on the flavour point. The potatoes did cook all the way through, though, which suggests it is possible to use fresh ones.

Excellent! Added broccoli florets. Diced, rather than sliced, red bell pepper. Used 1/2 Cheez-Its and 1/2 seasoned breadcrumbs. Also added garlic.  Would be great with diced ham or sausage.

This is a very tasty dish and a different way to fix scalloped potatoes.The only substitution I made was 1/2 cup bread crumbs in the mix, I did not have any cheese flavored crackers on hand,so I used 1/2 cup of crushed potato chips to top the potatoes and mix.  Turned out very good.  Thanx Mary Ann, I will definitely have it again

Have made many times, has become a favorite.
I use a frozen bag of O'Brien hash browns, green peppers ' onion already mixed in.
Also sometimes add chopped roasted red peppers or pimento for a little extra flavor & color.

This is a classic "potluck" comfort food. I have always made this dish by adding a medium container of sour cream and cutting the milk back to about 1/4 cup.

Not bad, just not really good or great. I thought I would love it with the added peppers, onions, and cheese crackers, but the recipe just didn't hit the mark. I much prefer the other hash brown casserole on this site. Now that one I LOVE!

I've made this for company, and they enjoyed the colors and a twist on a traditional dish... I liked the extra vegetables in the dish since it's difficult to get the family to eat enogh veggies. However, i will say the potatoes were sticky/starchy. Nice creamy taste, but I gave a 4 star due to texture/taste. The starhiness will be an issue for some.

This is absolutely delicious to every adult we've served it to.  I accidendentally put all the crackers in the mixture (it was even better) and put lots of grated cheddar cheese on top because we love it so much.

This is a great recipe for potluck dinners or bbq's.  I have made this many times and never had any leftovers.  I usually add more cheese and extra spices but all in all this is a quick and easy recipe that doesn't take any time to make.

This was good.  I added some garlic powder and then put a little more cheese on top before the cracker crumbs.

I made this dish for the Christmas potatoes.  I would make it again, but next time would use half the amount of butter for saute.  The butter seemed to pool at the bottom of the dish.  Also would chop the green pepper instead of cutting in thin strips.  I used shredded hashbrowns and cubed would be a better choice.  Mine took almost an hour to cook completely.

This was allright. I think I would like it with chunkier potatoes. It has the usual 'cambell's mushroom soup recipe' flavor. Not bad.
