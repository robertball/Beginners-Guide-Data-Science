These were super delicious! This will definitely be a regular item on my family's dinner menu. My only gripe about this recipe is the delicacy of the won ton wrapper. It took several tries to prevent tearing and to sufficently seal the edges together. Once mastered though, this recipe rocked!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used a generous amount of cayenne pepper which gave the ravioli a nice kick. In case anyone else doesn't have mascarpone cheese stocked in their fridge, a mixture of 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 1/2 tbs sour cream, and 1/4 c. heavy whipping cream in lieu of the mascarpone cheese works perfectly.

I LOVED this recipe.  It is finally the ravioli I crave from my favorite Italian restaurant.  The brown butter sage sauce is perfect.  I did use acorn squash instead of butternut because that is what I had.  I also made some changes that made this a little healthier.  I used 2 oz. of Neufatel cheese (a lower fat cream cheese) and two tablespoons of Parmesan instead of the cheese suggested.  I also used a teaspoon of maple syrup in the mixture.  Lastly, I topped the ravioli with roasted walnuts and served it with a spinach salad and roasted brussel sprouts.  This takes a little longer than implied, but so worth the time investment.  I great vegetarian dish.

delicious! the cayenne pepper doesn't really do much in terms of heat or flavor, so i either add a big pinch of it or a big pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. didn't do the sage butter sauce, but rather just tossed in butter and topped with freshly grated parmesan. also i hate wasting egg whites so i added a little bit of water to it and beat that to make a "glue" to seal the raviolis. they come out delicate and subtle, with a comforting butternut squash taste. SO good. will definitely make again and again.
oh, also this recipe made a lot so i froze a bunch (laid out on a baking sheet to freeze then threw them all in a bag) and cooked about 3 min, until the raviolis floated to the top.

This recipe was delicious.  The first time you cook something like this is always a learning curve.  So hopefully this will help your first time be perfect.  First, less is more.  Putting more than the teaspoon recommended makes the ravioli too rich.  We all preferred the raviolis with less butternut squash mixture.  Secondly, when you cook the raviolis in butter, do only one layer at a time.  Otherwise the raviolis stick.  I would do two batches with half of the butter in each.  Lastly, I substituted the mascarpone cheese for light cream cheese, and it was delicious!  Thanks for a recipe that we will surely make again - for simple family dinners and important guests alike.

Great recipe!  1 large butternut squash yielded 2 cups and therefore I doubled the filling recipe.  I did not use an egg yolk, but it did not matter.  Added a little extra cayenne just to give it a slight kick.  I was unable to purchase wonton wrappers and instead purchased a 16 oz package of egg roll wrappers.  Cut into quarters and made triangle shaped ravioli.  The doubled filling was perfect for the amount of wrappers I had.  Used about 3/4 of a teaspoon of filling in each wrapper.  The fresh snipped sage and fresh peppered parmesan were elegant.

I tried this out this weekend on my hubby and very picky teenage daughter. This is the first recipe I have rated online; I just HAD to say how fabulous it was and super easy. My daughter had two servings (which she rarely does, especially with new dishes) I made the ravioli as is, but varied the sauce a bit. Browned the butter, added garlic, then a couple dashes of white wine, hot pepper flakes, and cream. Reduced and served on ravioli. WONDERFUL!

Yum yum yum!!!  Fantastic flavors and very easy to make. I too omitted the egg yolk and added extra cayenne pepper. Wonton wrappers are key! I actually have a dumpling press so that little guy made making this dish super easy. My boyfriend LOVED this. It's a perfect seasonal, homey recipe. Thanks Chef John!!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was a little more cayenne pepper (as a spice-junkie, I couldn't help myself) and I diced the garlic clove and threw it in with the butter/sage combination.

I had made a butternut squash lasagne a few months ago and had some frozen leftover roasted butternut squash seasoned with cinnamon, sage, and fennel seeds. I used that in my filling and it was a perfect compliment to this recipe. The wonton wrappers made the recipe easy, but they seemed a bit sticky. I would make the recipe again. The stickiness was irritating but it tasted great!

Love it! I used cottage cheese instead of mascarpone, which was a great alternative. I did have trouble with the won tons clumping, but I attribute this to my over cooking (while boiling). I did double recipe and added more Cayenne as . I will make this again and again. 

I did use the egg white to coat the won ton before placing the filling and that made a huge difference with sealing better plus it wasn't wasted.  Thank you Chef John!

Holy moly these are good! I added a bit more cayenne, per other reviews. I also added about 1/8 - 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and ground sage and a little Asiago cheese. These are great!

WOW!!!  This was an easy (though a little time-conuming) homemade ravioli recipe, and I was more than pleased with the outcome!  I did not want to buy mascarpone cheese because it seemed expensive at my store, so I substituted cream cheese, and the outcome was still amazing.  I froze the extra ravioli as another viewer suggested.  I combined this recipe with the Tomato Vodka Sauce on this site... so, so good.  Thank you for sharing!

Just wonderful! I did ramp up the cayenne pepper to 3/4 tsp  and added an extra tablespoon of Parmesan - soooo good. I really hate recipes that require last minute prep but these are totally worth the fuss. This recipe makes way too much for 2- I have put the extra assembled raviolis on a cookie sheet and will bag when frozen. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I changed a few things with this recipe. I added a couple tbsp. of pumpkin, used laughing cow Swiss cheese and some roasted garlic. It tasted wonderful. I garnished with le gruyere freshly shredded and a sprinkle of dill. I ended up boiling at most 6 at a time, seem to have a good flow going. Prepare 6 then sauté 6 and kept going like that.

I had a butternut ravioli dish at a high end café a few years ago and was thrilled to find this easy recipe!
 
They turned out Awesome! I will make this again. I did modify it slightly by using ingredients I already had at home. 1/2 a block of Cream cheese instead of the mascarpone, I added more red pepper and I sautéed thin sliced white mushrooms in butter to put over the top of the raviolis. A New FAV! THANKS!

I really didn't care for the texture of the wonton wrappers after they were boiled. I also found the sage to over power the squash and parmesan.

What a wonderful recipe this was! However, I made a few alterations. This was my first time buying (and cooking) butternut squash. I replaced the ravioli noodles with spaghetti noodles, and I replaced the Parmesan cheese with shredded marble cheese. I also increased the amount of cayenne pepper because I prefer it to be a little bit spicy. This dish had the perfect amount of sweet and salty flavour. My husband and I both enjoyed it!

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't utilize the butter and sage - I just took them out of the boiling water and sprinkled with fresh parmesan and just a dusting of sage.  My husband, who has declared on more than one occasion that "butternut squash are good for nothing except throwing away" ate one without my knowledge and loved it.  He even took the leftovers with him to work, which is unheard of.  Once I got the hang of stuffing the raviolis, it wasn't too bad, but I found that doing 2 - 3 at once helped with the time management aspect.  These were great and I'm already planning on making some to freeze for a quick, weeknight meal.

This was awesome!!  I made it (and didn't tell my veggie hating boyfriend what was in it at first ha ha) I had him taste it and he loved it and was shocked when I told him it was made with butternut squash.  These tasted amazing!

Very easy to assemble and got rave reviews from the adults!   I added some diced smoked chicken breast leftover from another meal and it combined beautifully with the butternut squash.

I have made these often, sometimes using ricotta cheese mixed with the squash.  I cook them like pot stickers, a little water in a large frying pan, covered, then let water cook off so they get browned on the bottom.  Delicious with a butter sage sauce and toasted pumpkin seeds!

DON'T STACK THEM BEFORE BOILING!! A bunch of them all stuck together and then ripped apart. Total mess. It was so delicious though! Will be making again. Used pumpkin instead of butternut squash and added sautéed spinach. :)

I have to begin this review with the fact that it is the morning after making this recipe for last night's dinner..and as I write this review, I'm thinking about how much I want to make these for breakfast this morning! Wow, just wow! To use my husband's words, "those are f@&$ing goood!" I attempted to use the left over egg white to help seal my raviolis, as one reviewer suggested, but that didn't work even half as well as using just plain water. I also struggled to find a fold that worked, and stayed folded and sealed, but once I mastered that aspect, it went pretty good. I did make a couple changes, but mostly stuck to the recipe. I found that the crispier they are, the better! Seriously good, thanks for the recipe!

These were yummy! I didn't change a thing and they were light, sweet and tasty. I've never used wonton wrappers before and they are easy to use . I started planting butternut squash in my garden just so I could roast it and freeze it in cubes for this fresh and tasty recipe.

Great recipe and  found it pretty straight forward to make. My  very reluctant husband and 11yr old LOVED it!
Another reviewer suggested topping with  toasted nuts  so I tried almonds and my husband thought it was the perfect addition.
The only thing I did different was add the sage to the butter, really added to the flavour. This is  definitely a do again meal!

Delicious. A bit time consuming but worth it. I would suggest tossing a teaspoon of olive oil in the boiling water to help prevent the raviolis from sticking together. Avoid stuffing them too much because they'll fall apart. Also don't have your water as a rolling boil, turn it down the heat once you reach a boil; otherwise the wontons are prone to falling apart. The wonton wrappers do make it easier than rolling out your own dough, but you have to play with the first few to get the hang of it. As for the cayenne pepper, I followed other people's advice and added more...but I went a bit too far so it kind of overpowered the squash flavor. Still delicious, just something I would scale back on for next time. I also love a brown sugar cinnamon sauce with butternut squash so I will be looking for some various sauces to use with my remaining raviolis.

Could not find moscarpone cheese in store so I made my own: 8oz softened (not cold or hard) cream cheese, 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1Tbs full fat sour cream; mix (makes 1 1/4 cups).

Marry me, Chef John!!   These are amazing and using the wonton wrappers is a total game changer!!   I followed the recipe exactly.   The flavor was perfect, seasoning - also perfect and I found the wonton wrappers very simple to work with.     There's an asian market by my house and I found the wrappers in the freezer section, brand:  "Dynasty" and they were labeled "Gyoza/Potsticker Wrappers".   They seemed to be lightly floured and didn't stick together at all until you wet the edge.   Then they stuck beautifully after pressing firmly.   Didn't have even a single one come apart in the boil.   I've ordered this exact meal in many Italian restaurants and these homemade ones were hands down the best I've had.   LOVE THEM.

My entire family (kids included!) love these ravioli! They are time consuming, but well worth the effort. Fresh sage and roasted garlic in the browned (plant-based) butter make this spectacular, as does a sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese on top and the cayenne pepper in the filling.  I increase the cheese a bit, and then I puree my filling in my Ninja. For me, one batch of the filling makes two packs of wonton ravioli, so I usually make a double batch of the filling and use one portion while freezing three in vacuum bags. Then, when I want to make them,  I just defrost the filling and cut the end of the bag so I can pipe it right into the wonton wrapper. I've also frozen the cooked ravioli, vacuum sealed with parchment in between layers, with success. Just pop them into a little brown butter to reheat, add a side salad and you've got a super quick dinner.

This was really good as it, but also makes a great finger food with minor modifications.  I used a small paint brush to brush the water on the edges before sealing.  Keeps things less messy.
Here are some mods:
1. if you want less sweet, substitute ricotta cheese for the marscapone.
2.  If you want to serve as finger food appetizer, put the raviolis on a cookie sheet (cover with foil, light mist of olive oil) and mist with olive oil.  PAM sells olive oil spray or you can use a mister bottle to get a light olive oil spray.  Cook at 350 for about 10 minutes and the raviolis will have a nice crunch.
3.  If you want raviolis baked but not crunchy (to serve on plate with sauce), leave out the spray of olive oil and just cook on cookie sheet with foil and non-stick spray.

Play around with these, they are really delicious.

Used cream cheese, sour cream, whip cream combo as another reviewer suggested in place of mascarpone.  Used cheap grated parm. Recipe was fun and different, but I would have liked the flavor of the squash to come through more. It was cheesy and the butter in the end wasa good compliment. Might make a sweeter version sometime.

One thing to keep in mind, which I am not sure if this is stated in the recipe and I just didn't see it, is that you have to either cook or freeze these right away. The filling was great and the wonton wrappers made this a lot easier than it could have been. I, however, made the mistake of putting some in the fridge to cook the next day and they all stuck to each other and the bowl I put them in. It ended up as more of a mass of noodle and filling instead of individual ravioli. Very tasty though!

Really good, but makes way to much filling.  I used the extra filling as a sauce over pasta.  These freeze well and are tastey in a butter/sage sauce.

When boiling, I definitely only needed to boil for like 30 seconds. Any longer, and they turned to mush.  Other than that, they were really yummy :) Oh, and make sure to keep the heat on medium high when sautéing in garlic butter afterward to give it a somewhat crispy texture. Otherwise, it will be sopping in butter.

Delicous.  Not my favorite filling ever, but still very good.  It was a bit too sweet for my tastes - next time I would play with the spices to enhance the savory flavor rather than let the sweetness of the squash be quite so bold.  I used homemade pasta dough rather than wonton wrappers (although I have done ravioli that was as well and it certainly is a lot quicker!)  All in all, an impressive dinner and people enjoyed it.

Butternut squash ravioli is one of my faves, and this was awesome! I used whipped cream cheese since I didn't have any mascarpone.. In the end, I tossed some diced leftover grilled chicken thighs in the sauce with the raviolis. Scrumptious! Have a few leftover....can't wait to see how they hold up. I used the square wontons which I folded into triangles. The yield was 25 pieces.

Thanks for this recipe! We still have left over winter squash from the fall season and my husband doesn't care for it as much as I do.. but he LOVED this recipe.. he walked by several times stealing some of the pockets.  I replaced the butternut squash with another winter squash (I cooked it down in the microwave) and since I didnt have the marcaspone cheese I used instead some Philadelphia whipped cream cheese.  It made more than enough for two of us and, again, the husband snuck into the fridge and took out some to snack on. Thanks again! I am so happy to get a great recipe for so much squash. I'm tired of making breads.

I used a mascarpone cheese substitute of cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and butter. I am grateful for the wonton wrappers because as an avid DIY enthusiast- I think making my own pasta strips would have been too much. My boyfriend helped with the fillings and we both agreed it is one of the best meals we have ever had!

Great recipe.   Since it's winter, my 'fresh' sage was gone.  I used the sage I dried instead.  To infuse more flavor, I put the dried sage leaves in the pasta water before cooking the ravioli.  Once the water was flavored, I cooked the ravioli as directed.   I added crushed dried sage to the butter sauce as well.  The end result was excellent and very flavorful.

Made the filling as written but did add more cayenne.   Made my own pasta dough and rolled out for ravioli.   They are so delicious that I don't want to share.  Thanks for the amazing recipe.   I doubled the recipe.   Roasted 1 small/medium butternut squash in the oven the day before and put in blender to make it smooth.

Amazing filling. I researched many squash filling recipes and based my recipe on this one but with a few changes. I also omitted the egg due to sensitivities (not allergic, just sensitive so I leave them out of recipes if possible).  I liked the shallots Legasse puts in his so added 1 medium/large shallot, minced, probably about 1/3 cup.  Next time I will add a little more cayenne than a 'pinch'.  I did use homemade pasta but it's nice to know that wonton wrappers will do in a pinch.  Fantastic Chef John, thanks so much!

Delicioso! I added a dollop of fresh, organic basil pesto to the filling, and had to use whole milk ricotta (no mascarpone at my small rural mountain store). I like them best if I fry the ravioli a bit longer.... They get a nice buttery crispyness to them. Yum!

These were easy and fantastic, this week I was a little low on cash but wanted to use my squash as more of a main dish than a side. So I took the advice of other reviews and used cream cheese instead of mascarpone, AWESOME SUBSTITUTE!  Very happy with the outcome, even the squash hating boyfriend ate all of them :)

First off the flavor was amazing! I followed the receipe for the filling exactly as written and it was GOOOOD!  It took about an hour to make the filling and stuff the wonton wrappers. Then cooking the little guys was tricky. They stick if they touch each other after boiling. My first batch turned into ravioli a messy ravioli clump. The next batch went better, but at most I could cook 6 at a time which made it take a long time to cook. Also I would not say the wonton wrappers look tasty; they are wrinkled and sort of messy looking. They fold over and stick to themselves and make it hard to present a beautiful dish. I LOVED the flavor and so will try this again, maybe with eggroll wrappers as I have heard they are a little thicker and may be able to hold up better. I would like to serve this to guests but it needs to be a little better looking first. One more point, I finished the dish with Alfredo sauce and pecans and that tasted great with the butternut squash flavor.

Made this recipe as suggested but left out the sage. It was so delicious and not tough to make. My vegetarian son loved it! Would definitely make it again.

Made these for dinner tonight. This was my first attempt to make ravioli. The main reason is I don't like kneading. I never make pie crust from scratch. So, using wonton wrappers for ravioli is a brilliant idea. My husband said these were better than he had in the restaurants. We love spicy food but I forgot to add cayenne pepper. I can't imagine how delicious they would be with sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Thank you Chef John for the recipe. Will make these again, very soon!

These are so good and easy to make. Subbed w light cream cheese. Took advice from another reviewer & used a small paintbrush to moisten edges of wonton wrappers. Much easier & faster than doing by hand. Thanks Chef John for another fabulous recipe!

I don't like butternut squash but I loved this! I would just change putting the sage in the pan when the ravoli goes in but otherwise it was awesome!

These take a little bit of time and coordination since you're boiling a few at a time and warming in the butter at the same time.  I felt a little like I was on an assembly line but they turned out delicious!  I subbed out the mascarpone for greek yogurt (because I completely glazed over that ingredient while shopping), and it turned out great.  Left out the sage, and probably tripled the cayenne.

My husband absolutely loved this. I had leftover roasted squash & it worked perfectly for this. Did use cream cheese in place of the mascarpone cheese & left out the egg yolk. For the butter, I sauteed 2-3 cloves & didn't use the sage because my husband doesn't care for it. Will definitely be making this again!

I thought I'd really love this but the taste, for me was just the opposite. I found it very easy to make. I did put the squash mix in the refrigerator a bit to set up before filling the wrappers and that worked out like a charm.  They weren't mushy at all like some reviewers, they looked really nice, fried up nice with the garlic. I couldn't get past the floury taste of the wonton and the mascarpone cheese with the butternut squash gave an aftertaste I didn’t care for.  I was surprised as I thought I would LOVE it.

Very good recipe.  Will be having this again.  The only thing I changed is that I used Phillydelphia Cream Cheese, and wonton wraps, as our grocery store didn't carry the ones listed here.

Fabulous, easy!  However, I really cheated .... I didn't have squash on hand, but I had leftover mashed sweet potato from making the delicious sweet potato pie, so I used that instead.  OMG!!  I added some dried sage, upped the cayenne just a smidge and proceeded as directed.  Thought I'd better taste one, and then, two, and eventually about 10.  Froze the rest for company.  These are GOOD! Added bonus is the "roasted garlic clove" you can use in another dish.

The little bit of spice in these is really good. The actual putting together part was a little tedious but worth it. We also tried to freeze some for later, but they stuck together. So, if you try freezing, don't let them touch AT ALL or you will end up with ravioli mush.

I'm a vegetarian so as it this recipe works really well but I am trying to become vegan, right now sort of half and half. I used vegan cream cheese and vegan butter and no egg yolk and it came out delicious. And I can use the filling as a side dish too. This makes a fantastic meal and side dish. BTW

These were delicious and easy! They were not very hard to make and freeze wonderfully. I made a butternut squash sauce from Vegan Chef Chole's website to go on top with some chopped pecans. I also made with pumpkin which were good but the squash was better.

These were really simple and delicious! I used leftover  roasted squash and subbed cottage cheese for the mascarpone ( to cut fat, budget and richness of the meal) and my store only had the square wonton wrappers. * I did add more cayenne for an extra a kick.   I prepared the filling late in the afternoon, then covered it and let it chill in the fridge. When dinner time approached, I heated the oven for the salmon and asparagus (with their seasonings) and started boiling the water for the dumplings. Threw the things in the oven and started filling the pasta. After the dumplings are in the water, when they return to boil, turn the heat on the butter in the skillet....yadda, yadda... less than thirty minutes work and it was a beautiful meal! Will do these again!

Delicate flavor, not over-powering, just creamy yumminess. I didn't have mascarpone cheese, so I used cream cheese with whipping cream as a substitute. Also, these make enough for at least 4 people, and they take a long time to fill/pinch/boil; therefore, I suggest doing what I did--put some olive oil on a couple big plates and after boiling slide them around in the oil, then let them cool. Do not stack (which I did and they stuck together on my first 7), and boil in small batches. After they cooled, I put them on a layer of wax paper over the more cool ones. I let them set until dinner time at which time I warmed them up in the pan with the garlic oil.

Made it tye firt time for some friends.  the6 couldn't believe I had never made this recipe before.

I couldn't find the wonton wrappers in our store, so I made raviolis from scratch, too.  The whole dish was SO GOOD.  Topped with the sage and some shredded parmesan.  Will be making this again.

The flavor was DELICIOUS. I was generous with pepper flakes in the filling, as others have suggested.  The wonton wrappers did make the ravioli a bit of an unpresentable mess at the end, but no one in my family cared. I wasn't able to get them crispy in the butter - again, no one in my family cared.  I will try these with homemade pasta as well, as I think they will hold up a bit better. But this one is a keeper!

I made this recipe with pumpkin and it was awful.  If I had put some sweetener in the filling I know it would have been better.  Ended up adding sugar sub and making pie.  It was very good.  This recipe is just a knock off of the pumpkin one.  Also, if you like these, you can boil them and then fry them in butter like potstickers and they will be good.

These were good,and the filling was tasty. I made pasta dough rather then using won ton wrappers. They remind me of pot stickers rather then ravioli. I used goat cheese in place of the mascarpone  cheese.

I thought these were ok. I added some green onion and garlic powder; instead of sage I used poultry seasoning and added a bit more red pepper. I didn't have any Mascarpone cheese so I used a Mascarpone Substitute from this site. Instead of heavy cream for the cheese, I used plain Greek yougurt. I used potsticker wrappers because I did not have wontons and I steamed them instead of boiling. The wrappers may be why I wasn't crazy about them and also I think sauteing them in the butter makes them too greasy, I would omit that step. My high rating is because instead of preparing them this way I think this would also make an excellent dip but I would leave the egg yolk out. Thanks for sharing!

The chef should be sued for false advertising for titling this recipe "easy" and using the words "incredibly easy" in the description. It is by far the most time-consuming and tedious side-dish I have ever made. After I had spent most of the afternoon mixing up the filling and then making less than half of the raviolis, I was so disappointed to find that the wrappers did not, despite my greatest efforts at sealing them very carefully, survive the dip into the boiling water, that I chose not to even finish the rest. I'll use the filling in a butternut squash lasagna instead. Probably make won tons with the leftover wrappers. Fortunately, despite how awful they looked after the boiling and then frying in butter, they tasted delicious. The part of the filling that didn't escape into the boiling water was perfectly seasoned. Will I ever make this again? Not on your life.  The same delicious flavors will, I'm sure, be present in a different much less time-consuming and frustration-inducing pasta dish. This is the first time I have EVER felt the need to register on a recipe website in order to review a recipe.

I made this a few weeks ago and used homemade pasta, but didn't saute it in the butter.  Regardless,  it was SO delicious.  Making it again tonight - but this time I will saute.  I'll update after trying that.

Wantons did not work- too thin and broke apart when boiled.  Next time would make dough from scratch . However, the flavor and mix of spices was perfect. Added maple sausage and extra cubes of butternut squash to the sauce- worked great

Very good flavor. However, although these are called "easy" (which they pretty much are), they are extremely time consuming to make.  I tried this recipe hoping to make them as a vegetarian option for Thanksgiving but the amount of time it took to assemble them, the problems I had with them sticking together both before and after cooking and my inability to keep them warm once I started putting batches in the butter made me cross them off my menu for that day.  The consistency of dough is like a steamed chinese ravioli (it is a wonton after all) and not an Italian one.

This was absolutely delicious!  With the small amount of filling leftover after all the wrappers were stuffed, I added a little half & half, heated it and served as a little sauce to drizzle onto the ravioli.

Love this!  Better than I've had in restaurants because the wrappers really taste fresh and al dente. I omitted the cayenne  I added a tiny sprinkle of nutmeg. It's a thing I have but no more than one shake.

i would absolutely advise against boiling. The wonton wrappers are soft enough, just saute in the hot garlic and oil and you're set!

Really liked this filling. Rather than use the won ton wrappers, used semolina flour and rolled out the dough in our pasta machine. Used the filling from this recipe. They came out great. Sauted the boiled ravioli in butter and a couple cloves of minced garlic.

Like others, I made a lot of changes to adjust for what I had on hand. The result was fabulous (as I imagine the original recipe is)! I used acorn squash and used goat cheese instead of mascarpone. I increased the squash:cheese ratio a bit since the goat cheese has such a strong tang and could easily overpower the mix. It was delicious! I recommend adding the egg last so you can taste and adjust as needed beforehand. I also made a cream sauce, starting with the butter and smashed garlic, adding a little wine, and then adding half and half. I have also found the secret to any good italian cream sauce is a couple of dashes of nutmeg. You won't be disappointed! Finally, adding a little oil to the boiling water will help prevent the raviolis from sticking together and to the pan. This is certainly a keeper!

Really delicious recipe and easy as well. It was helpful to watch the video. I honestly wouldn't change anything about it except I'd use the whole carton of marscapone and a bit more squash, because it didn't make sense to have that tiny bit left in the container, and there was a lot of squash.  The proportions do not need to be exact as long as they are close.  I smashed the garlic a bit because I did want more garlic flavor. I had square wontons, so I used a round cookie cutter to make them round....but of course if you had to make these square it's no big deal.

I liked the filling quite a bit, the "ravioli" being made from wonton wrappers made them less sturdy than I would have liked. The butter sage sauce was mostly just butter...I'll make the filling again but probably not as ravioli's

The sage was a bit much. Instead try serving on a bed of fresh, raw baby spinach, drizzle generously with some of the garlic butter & sprinkle liberally with coarse salt. The contrast between the sweetness of the squash & the salt is amazing.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare! I could not find wonton wrappers in our supermarket, so I used eggroll wrappers instead. Each sheet yielded 4 or 6 ravioli, depending on how you cut them. I also replaced mascarpone with the combo of neufchatel, sour cream, and a splash of whipping cream and maple syrup recommended by another reviewer. I look forward to making these in the future, and trying the baked recommendation mentioned in one of the reviews. Thank you, Chef John, for a tasty make-at-home treat in keeping with the season!

What a treat!!!!!  I made some ahead today for company and had to try some tonight - testing I call it, and wow, my husband would not stop eating.......I roasted the squash and used my dried sage, reconstituted in the microwave, and it was nice and crunchy in the butter.....really made the ravioli pop......I would not change a thing and will make it again and again......I am sure my company will enjoy tomorrow as well.
Using won ton wrappers was easy peasy and saved a lot of time......Enjoy everyone....I did.!

These were really good but also a lot of work.  If I knew how to make homemade pasta I think that would hold up better than the wonton skins.  I made two different sauces, one the sage brown butter which was way more flavorful than I expected.  The other was a self created sweeter Apple carmalized onion sauce.  Both were good, the Apple one probably healthier but the sage butter was better and easier.  I made all the filling and froze half the raviolis for later.  I think during the boil and frying phase don't be afraid to let them cook awhile.  My first couple were a bit soggier then the last few after I had some practice.  I also substituted the low fat cream cheese for the marscopone cheese because of cost and calories.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I did not use the wonton wrappers. Went straight to our Italian deli where they cut pasta from cappellini to pappardelle.  Purchase two uncut sheets and made traditional ravioli instead. It was amazing!

I usually love Chef John's recipes, but this just did not turn out for me.  I made it to a T, but the wonton wrappers just didn't work.  The first batch the wrappers were clearly too thin, no bite to them and if they stuck to the pot even slightly the wrappers tore.  Then, I tried wetting 2 wrappers together, and doubling the thickness, but the texture of the pasta was just too chewy.  Maybe a different brand or something would work, cause the filling was pretty good.

Made these as described. Flavor was awesome but the wonton wrappers were rather soggy once boiled. They fell apart during the final step of putting them in the pan with the butter.  Made for some pretty nasty looking pasta when all was said and done. These would probably be awesome with some real ravioli dough.

This was good. I wonder if there is another type of sauce I could do for next time other than just pure butter (even though it was really tasty).

OMG this recipe was soooo easy and tasted great.  I have wanted to make Butternut Squash Ravioli for a while I am glad i finally got to try it.  My husband loved it too, this is definitely a keep and will be put into the dinner rotation.  I froze half of it, I hope it cooks up just as good.

I was expecting something very delicious and what I got was a mushy ravioli with literally no type of sauce to it.  I improvised and used a bit of a creamy tomato sauce, but I couldn't save the mushy raviolis.  We ate it but only because there was nothing else!  Thanks for posting, but it wasn't for me!

Tried this recipe tonight and it was great!!! I made a small mistake and bought spaghetti squash and not butternut squash. I stepped out on faith and went for it...the filling was great. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so just used red pepper flakes. Oh...and I put in about 4 cloves of garlic. YUM...umm, umm, good!. Really. Also, what took me the longest was making the ravioli. I don't like the time it takes...but this is a keeper...I will do it.

My go-to recipe for butternut squash ravioli.  I can't seem to find the half moon wrappers though.

The filling is absolutely delicious. I'm hesitant to use wonton wrappers due to the consistency ratings I've read so instead I made gluten free raviolis. This was fantastic. I'd definitely make again!

It was delicious...  but the wontons kept sticking to each other after being cooked. How can I avoid that?

Omitted the sage, just dont' like the flavor. This was very good and easy to prepare. I had a hard time forming ravioli though. I will keep practicing this is a delicious vegeterian meal. Thanks Chef John!

These were definitely easy.  Next time I think I'll make a sauce to go with them, though.
