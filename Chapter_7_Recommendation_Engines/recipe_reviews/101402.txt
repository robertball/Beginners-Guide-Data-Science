WOW! Great recipe for grilled pork - a perfect combination of sweet and slightly spicy! I used a 2 pound pork tenderloin and because my biggest fear is the dreaded "dried out" pork I chose to marinate this first. I mixed together some olive oil, garlic, rosemary, a pinch or two of kosher salt and a few splashes of white wine vinegar. I poked a few holes in the meat, cut it into kabobs (for more even cooking on the grill) and put everything into a ziploc bag. I let that marinate for 6 hours.  I skewered the meat onto kabobs and and started grilling. For the glaze I used 3 Tbsp. of stone ground mustard for every 1/4 cup of apricot preserves (flipping the amounts) I felt the sweetness should come through more than the spicy. I microwaved the preserves for a few seconds in order to mix in the mustard better and reserved a bit of it as a dipping sauce. This turned out oh so good! I served this with "Baked Sweet Potatoes" by JennCook and "Tangy Mango Slaw" from this site.

I made a few changes.  I cooked 2 lbs of tenderloin, used 1/2 c. apricot preserves and 1/2 c. honey dijon mustard.  Cook 8 min. turn over, baste, cook another 8 min., turn over baste and cook another 2 - 3 min. until center is slightly pink and temp reaches 160 degrees.  Fantastic and was a hit with the whole family.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavors went all the way through the meat.  What baste was left over I microwaved to kill any bacteria and put it on the table to spoon over pork.

This is so easy, quick and delicious. I left off the salt, but otherwise made as written. I had a little of the sauce left over that I added honey to and heated. Poured over cut tenderloin. Everyone loved it.  I will be making this again.

We have several regional orchards that make wonderful preserves. Our favorite for this recipe is Raspberry Jalapeno although Apricot is terrific too. I like to use regular Dijon mustard in the mix and setup the charcoal grill for indirect cooking. Sear the tenderloin over the coals, then use indirect the rest of the way brushing the meat with the mixture several times in order to build up a thick glaze. A favorite for sure!

I came across this recipe yesterday when I was looking for a pork tenderloin idea. I decided on a different recipe yesterday, but made this today with ribs in my crockpot - YUM! Great sauce and it went amazingly well with the ribs (which I pre-boiled). I would not change a thing with the sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Easy and tasty.  Had and used apricot juice instead of jelly (supplemented with 2 tbls honey) and had chops so used them.  Adjust grilling to 4-5 mins per side and baste often.  Family says YES, do again.

Loved this! Used 1/2 apricot jam and 1/2 Dijon mustard and made extra to pour on your own serving.  I'm not a fruit with meat fan and neither is my father but we both really enjoyed it.  6 of us polised off one 2 1/2lb tenderloin.  So easy you have to give it a try.

Wonderful! I would not change a thing. The secret to this recipe is to marinade it minumum of 8 hours. My whole family loved it and it's a definite keeper.

Sensational! Easy, delicious. What more can I say? I don't like yellow mustard as a rule, but mixed with the apricot, it was fantastic.

Well, it doesn’t get any easier than this!  As Jillian suggested, I too, reversed the amounts of preserves and mustard, using 1/4 cup preserves and 3 T. Dijon mustard.  Don’t overcook this!  This will not be dry if you take the pork off the grill at 145 degrees, let it rest for 5-10 minutes and then carve.  The residual heat in the tenderloin will continue to cook it.  This was very good, with a nice balance of sweet from the preserves, and tang from the mustard.  I’d be tempted to try other flavors of preserves.  Raspberry comes to mind.

This was a great easy way to get a lot of flavor with out putting in much effort - the whole family enjoyed it.  I've made it several times now including using it on grilled pork chops.  Thanks!

This was good... I marinated the meat prior to the grilling, but still felt like it was missing something.  I did use an indoor grill and didn't have any liquid smoke to give it that smokey favor... that could be what I was missing.

I thought this recipe sounded delicious, but found that all I could taste was the mustard. I used honey-mustard, but event that didn't help it. Will not make again

I think I needed to season my pork a little better but the basting blend was delish.
