My grandmother, Nanny, uses this cole slaw dressing for all her potato salads and uses celery seeds instead of red pepper to give it a tang.  I've made it myself a number of times and usually I'm lucky to get a second helping at picnics!

What a great change from typical potato salad!  It was hard to stay away from the yellow mustard and dill pickles, but I had faith!  I have another Marzetti recipe for stuffed potatoes, it's served warm with balsamic vinegar, I'm sure it's on this site somewhere.  The only substitution I made on this recipe was use pimento instead of red pepper.  We loved it!

After serving many good potato salads, my family prefers this one because of the dressing. I do sweeten the dressing with a little white sugar or splenda and change a couple of the salad's ingredients from time to time, but it's always the dressing that makes the salad.  I love this because it's not only time saving, but delicious.

This is great for people who don't care for mayonnaise. We have friends whose son had never eaten potato salad due to his mayo phobia and I made this for him - voila! A convert. It's an easy, delicious variation.

This is an excellent potato salad.  I did green bell peppers cuz that's what I had, added half of an onion diced and left out the pickle relish. It was wonderful!  Next time I will add some skillet browned chunks of smoked sausage I think.  Yum......
