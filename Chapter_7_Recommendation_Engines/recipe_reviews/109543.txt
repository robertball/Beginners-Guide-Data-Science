There was nothing too exciting about this, very blah.  I made it for lunch and all 3 of us felt the same way

As it this recipe is kinda bland. I like the flavors but it is missing something. I think next time I will add a cheese with some pungency and saltiness to it, perhaps an asagio or a bleu cheese. 

Update: I added bleu cheese this time and it was EXCELLENT!

This is delicious!!  What a welcome change from what people expect!  I used a boxed Hot Roll Mix instead of a ready made Italian crust.  The Brie cheese was awesome!

I thought it was bland... my mom loved it, though. I plan on trying another recipe on this website that has a crescent roll crust.

I think the taste buds of my friends and I are programmed for more zing when we hear the word pizza.  We found this rather bland too.  I will try it again though with a few changes.

Next time I will marinate the chicken in lemon juice then grill it.  I will also add more onion...and will probably use a sweet onion instead of spring to get more zing that way too.

My husband and I thought this recipe was pretty great.  I think the flavor level of this depends on what kind of chicken you use as well as cranberry sauce.  We did take the recommendation of rotisserie chicken and that worked very well.  We usually make our own cranberry sauce, but as we couldn't find any cranberries we picked up some pre-made sauce in a container (not can) from Trader Joe's.  Pretty good stuff.  I think next time I will only use the sauce as the base and not also mix the chicken in it, the cranberries can take over the pizza.  Also, I was conservative and did not use as much brie as suggested.  Next time, more brie!
