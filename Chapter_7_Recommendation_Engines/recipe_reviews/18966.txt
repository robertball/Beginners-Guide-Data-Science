Yummy.  My husband and I have this on birthdays and Christmas.  It's very good, with a nice tang from the raspberry concentrate and sweetness from the ice cream.  I couldn't find any raspberry cream soda, so I just used regular cream soda, which happened to be coloured red.

This was very delicious!  I had a hard time finding these exact ingredients, so I used a combo of raspberry soda  cream soda.  It didn't have a very appetizing appearance, but everyone that tried it loved it!!!

Deeelicious!  I served this with Decadent Chocolate Truffles (recipe on this site), and it was a huge hit.  Used regular cream soda, and for the ice cream I got the sherbet/vanilla swirl.  It was awesome and very pretty.

Family loved this. I halved the recipe. I did have to change the soda I couldn't find raspberry cream soda so I used plain cream soda. Since I was going to be missing the extra flavor I pureed 12oz of raspberries with softened ice cream and the juice concentrate before I added it to the soda. I think the pureeing with the ice cream helped it mix with the soda  a lot better than just dumping the ice cream into the soda/juice mix.

I made this for a cookie swap and all the women loved it.  I couldn't find frozen raspberry concentrate, so I used cranberry concentrate.  I had to buy regular cream soda and added raspberry syrup.  It was deelish!  I will definitely make this again.

This tasted delicious, but didn't look very attractive. I also used regular diet cream soda. Thanks, Joyce!

Couldnâ€™t find the raspberry. Used orange instead. Was amazing!
