These are awesome. Mind you I had lard not shortening. I added 1/2tsp. of cinnamon & my 1yr old kept making "mmm" sounds while eating them. I'll up the cinnamon next time I make'em. With sugar cookies, I usually bake some right away & the rest I usually wrap them into a tube & instead of rolling  & flattening them to cut them into shape, I just slice them & while they're all round I cook every single bit of them. 


The recipe's a keeper.

These cookies are very bland and do not taste good at all.  It is a simple recipe and the cookies are basically fool proof, but they really do taste "empty" and as the other reviewer mentioned, you can taste the shortening.  I like sugar cookies normally, so that is not the issue.  I first baked them without salt as other reviewers recommend and thought perhaps that was why they were flavorless so I did a quick second batch with salt; which were just as bland.  Perhaps almond flavoring or coconut, but then that would not be this recipe.

Love these cookies! I made a few adjustments by substituting White Flour for equal amounts of Gold brand Wheat Flour. (No need to blend the two flours.) I used one whole stick of Crisco butter flavored shortening and left out the regular butter. Then, before baking I rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar. It's a more nutritious cookie - if cookies can be called that.

Almost perfect, I tried with cinnamon and without, bot have a very nice flavor, but I guess I am still not used to using brown sugar instead of white sugar. I feel the brown sugar flavor was a little overpowering.

Well i just made these and i wasn't at all impressed. The recipe was simple enough easy to put together and dough holds up well, however there isn't much flavor here. I feel that the shortening taste is a bit over powering and thought they tasted a bit bland even with additional sugar, all in all I think that this is a good base recipe that can be improved upon.

2-20-2016  ~These cookies are just too good to have been so easy to make.  Thank goodness I at least caught the error, but the fact that I mixed in the Crisco AFTER I thought I was done with the dough tells you how foolproof they are for a great result!  (Please, naples, after decades of baking, you should know to have all of your ingredients out and ready to go before you begin a recipe so you don’t run into this problem!)  I used a 2 T. scoop to make sure each cookie was the same size, then rolled each scoop into balls, then rolled them in sugar.  I flattened them ever so slightly before baking.  I baked them at 375 degrees (I like that better than 350) and because I like my cookies on the crispier side I baked them for 10 minutes.  Those who like them softer may want to go up to a minute less.  This is a good, plain old-fashioned cookie jar type cookie with the perfect sweetness, not bogged down with a lot of extras or embellishments which was nice for a change.  The title is apt, as a sugar cookie with a butterscotch, brown sugar flavor is exactly what they taste like.  For even more of that flavor it might be interesting to try these with dark brown sugar rather than light, but I’m telling you, these are awesome good just as is.

This was a hit with my children.  I read the previous reviews and I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and then for the 1 1/4 cups of brown sugar I used 1/4 cup dark brown and 1 cup light brown.  I will definitely be making this recipe again just next time I will double the recipe.  Thank you.
