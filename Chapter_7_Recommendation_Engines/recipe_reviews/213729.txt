I didn't know whether I should use dill or sweet relish, but I used sweet, so I left the sugar out of the dressing. I thought the sandwich would be dry, but it wasn't. I do however think it should have more flavor, so next time I would put the dressing on both sides, and maybe add a tomato or slice of avocado to the sandwich. thanks!
