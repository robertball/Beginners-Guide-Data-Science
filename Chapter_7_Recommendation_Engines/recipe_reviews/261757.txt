Takes a little extra effort, but is delicious.  I added a little bit of lemon peel to this, because I like my deserts with some extra tartness.  It needs to be eaten while warm, it loses something if eaten left over.

I liked this cake, it was a little dry, but when paired with applesauce it was terrific. When I make it again,  I will try something else.
