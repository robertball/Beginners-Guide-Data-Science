This is a great Easter reciped.  Top with fresh pureed strawberries.  Don't prebake the shells, or you'll end up driving 20 miles into town to pick up fresh ones!

This is an interesting pie - certainly doesn't resemble cheese cake but it's good in it's own right. I did have a little trouble getting the inside of the pie to cook all the way. It definitely didn't look very pretty - I would recommend topping it with something. I topped it with fresh strawberries and blueberries. If you're looking for a lighter dessert this one is a good choice.

Loved it. This is a custard-style pie not the drier ricotta pies I have had from bakeries. I modified the recipe and am happy with my results. The biggest improvement: I used a small whisk to push the custard through a sieve prior to baking. It took away most lumpiness and made a silkier pie. You can still feel the ricotta texture but its blended into the custard. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla was liberal with the lemon and sugar and only lightly beat the whites. I used 1 cup light cream and 1 cup milk (its what i had on hand) and all proportions were great. I know I made a lot of changes - even if you follow it exactly definitely spend the extra 10 minutes to push through a sieve. I topped it with fresh berries and it was a hit for Easter. Another big tip is to cool it thoroughly (several hours or overnight) at room temperature before refrigerating to avoid the 'sweating' effect.

Great. I did it without crust and used Splenda and no sweetened condensed milk for a healthier option and it was Delish!
