This was a very good, easy recipe - my only gripe (therefore 4 stars) is that I had to read all the reviews to get it right b/c the instructions were somewhat lacking.  I added about 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tblsp of sugar to the puff batter, and reduced the eggs to 3 b/c of reviewer's comments about the puff pastry being too eggy.  I think 4 eggs would've been fine, too - I don't mind them being eggy or a bit on the light side flavor-wise since the custard is so sweet.  But it's ESSENTIAL to poke a hole the last couple of mins of baking the puffs so they don't collapse. It's also ESSENTIAL to let the dough cool before adding eggs, otherwise the eggs will start "cooking" in the dough & not mix in. Also ESSENTIAL to beat in as much air as possible when mixing the eggs until the dough is a sticky, elasticky, "chewy"  consistency.  Maybe Shellie could add these important instructions into the recipe?  While experienced bakers may know this as "common knowledge," a lot of new bakers may not.  I made big ones and bite sized ones - even the big ones cooked through in about 25-28 mins.  Just gotta poke that hole.  To cut back on calories in the filling, I just made the pudding recipe as is, with fat-free milk.  Was still delicious.  I plan on making it with heavy cream for guests later this week.

Awesome recipe and so easy with such elegant results.  I've made this recipe more times than I can count, and haven't changed a thing, except making the prep easier.  No need to cool the water/butter mixture.  Put the hot liquid into your mixer bowl and dump all 4 eggs in at once and mix IMMEDIATELY on med. speed. Mix until the dough is tacky and starts sticking to the side of the bowl and you're done - about 2-3 min. (Mixing in one egg at a time makes no difference in dough texture and only allows more time for your eggs to curdle in the hot liquid.) I use a heaping tablespoon of dough for each, bake exactly 20 min and then poke a small hole with a toothpick in the side of each puff.  No need to let it sit in the oven (or it will dry out)or leaving the oven door ajar while cooling. Just let the steam escape with a toothpick and cool.  Forget all the complicated posts on how to prevent deflation.  I make this professionally for a bakery and my easy tips have never failed - try it.***Update- PLEASE use parchment paper to bake or it will stick. Don't grease your cookie sheet, or the bottoms will burn or get too brown.  Also, add one teaspoon vanilla extract. This will help diminish with the 'eggy' taste. Good luck, and keep trying if you fail the first time. This should be a no-fail recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  Very light and delicious.  A tip, though, for this and all cream puff recipes: After baking is finished, turn off the oven, crack the door open with a towel or potholder, and let stand in the oven for about an hour.  This prevents them from sagging!

The ingredients for the recipe were acceptable, it was the directions that lacked proper instructions.  Cream puffs need to be thoroughly dried out or they will fall and be soggy.  After making one batch of soggy puffs I did a little research in order to have success the second time around.  When finished baking, poke a small hole in the side of the puff to let steam escape.  Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes with the door open to continue drying.

Simply delicious.  Very easy to prepare.  To cut down on clean up and to make filling the cream puffs a snap, put the pudding mix, milk and cream in a zip top bag.  Shake and massage the mixture until uniform, then place in the refrigerator to set (this takes about 15 minutes or so).  Once set, cut about 1/8 of an inch off the tip of the bag.  This way, instead of trying to spoon the mixture into the cream puffs by hand, or transfering the mixture to a pastery bag, you can directly pipe the mixture into the puff.  Be sure to cut only an 1/8 of an inch or so off the bag to ensure maximum control of the amount of filling you're putting into the puffs.  Fill the mixture from the bottom of the puff by making a tiny incision (I used the tip of a steak knife), that way the puff will remain whole and look more appetizing when served (as opposed to slicing it in half and filling it like a sandwich).

This recipe is fabulous IF you read the comments of how to successfully make them.  If you don't read the comments you will end up with beautiful cream puffs that deflate while cooling.  Here's how the directions should read:

1. Place the butter and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and with a wooden spoon or spatula, quickly add the flour mixture.  Return to heat and stir constantly until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan and forms a thick smooth ball (about a minute or two).
2. Transfer the dough to your electric mixer and beat on low speed a minute or two to release the steam from the dough.  Once the dough is lukewarm start adding the eggs and continue to mix until you have a smooth thick paste.
3. Spoon or pipe mounds of dough onto the baking sheet spacing them a couple of inches apart.
4. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350.  Bake for a further 30 to 40 minutes or until the shells have browned and are dry inside.
5. PRICK EACH PUFF WITH A TOOTHPICK to allow steam to escape and prevent them from falling.  Turn the oven off and, with the oven door slightly ajar, let the shells dry out for a further 10-15 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.

I hope this helps all new cream puff chefs and prevents you from having your first attempt flop like me.

Well.. all the reviews say its amazing! I'm a good cook but I have no idea what happened. Very disappointed. The puffs turned into mush, they never did puff or dry, instead they fried in the oven. WHAT WENT WRONG?!?! HELP!

I have a comment and a question.  The cream is awesome to say the least, however please tell me where I went wrong.  My shells did not rise much at all so I could not fill them.  I had to use one for the bottom and one for the top.  Also, I baked them on a nonstick cookie sheet and the bottoms stuck to the sheet.  Where did I go wrong?

This was so simple I have to say!  And the cream filling is to die for, I added a little almond extract to mine.  I brought this to work, and boy do they just think I'm the next best thing!  If you've never made these before, a trick I used was to pipe the dough with a star tip into mini muffin tin.  It helped control size and made it so easy to remove them.  Plus the star tip gave them a pretty look!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Simple and spectacular! I've made this recipe more than a half-dozen times so far, and it never fails to garner raves.  A few notes from my kitchen:  Letting the pastries cool slowly in the oven after baking -- I turn the oven off and prop the door ajar by a couple of inches -- keeps them from collapsing before I have a chance to fill them.  A half-teaspoon of vanilla, almond, or orange extract added to the filling erases any processed taste that might linger from the pudding mix.  Also, a drizzle of melted dark chocolate on top adds a scrumptious accent.

These were HEAVENLY! Keep the puffs small or they will not cook all the way through or be soft in the middle. I used a small melon ball scooper and it worked great with the sticky dough. My drops were the size of gumballs, or as big around as a quarter. If you are going to fill the puff using a pastry bag I suggest taking the tip before you put it in the pastry bag and go to each puff and make a hole in the bottom. Make the holes after the puffs cool, but the bottoms can be crisp and hard to get a pretty little circle with if you have filling all over your tip. So make servings small and put your holes in the puffs before you go to fill them. I also used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla like others suggested and it was to die for! I will defiantly make again!

OMG! These are so easy and so delicious that they're aren't enough stars for this one! I had no idea these were so simple to make - had I known that I would have been making these long before now! And what's really great is you can fill them with just about anything and decorate them so they look pretty and very elegant - a real crowd pleaser. You look like some sort of genious without a lot of effort. Heck you'll have people thinkin' your some distant cousin of Martha Stewart wtih these little babies! I followed the advice of "MommyFromSeattle" and had no trouble at all. I filled some with the vanilla pudding and drizzled melted chocolate over top. Others I filled with "Angel Lush" filling from this site and topped with homemade whipped cream and a slice of strawberry. I dusted them all with confectioners' sugar and they looked great and tasted even better! This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is truly a 5 star recipe once you get it down because they are not the easiest thing to make. For those of you that said your puffs did not rise in the oven here is what you need to do: Put the stick of butter and 1 cup of water in a pot. Bring it to a boil with MEDIUM heat. Have your 1 cup of flour and your salt in a bowl next to the pot so that as soon as it starts to boil you can dump it right in. The trick is to get the dough prepared right away as it starts to boil. If too much of the water gets evaporated your dough consistency will be too runny to rise into puffs. Once I dumped my flour in I stirred pretty quickly and as soon as the dough texture formed I dumped it into my mixing bowl and beat in all 4 eggs right away. If you do not do this QUICKLY the eggs will cook inside the hot dough. This is why some of you on here may have said your puffs came out "eggy" tasting. I added 2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp. of sugar to my dough. Once it was all mixed together I used a greased muffin pan to cook my puffs and give them better form. I like mine larger so I used an ice cream scooper to fill the pan with dough. I baked them for exactly 20 minutes then took them out and poked 2 holes in each one with a tooth pick to let the heat escape and keep them from collapsing. They cooled for about 40 minutes. I piped the cream filling mixture into them to get them really full and they also stay cleaner this way. I also used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

Super easy, I first made this as a trial run for a dinner party.  Then as I have been asked to make them more often I started reading through all the reveiws of all the recipes (hundereds!!)  After reading, this is what I found out...  All the cream puff recipes have the same ingredients and measurements. The difference is the baking directions.  I did find a review (by Magique) that said that Cream puffs need a high temperature so they will rise quickly and leave a hollow center and to set the shape of the shells. Then they need a lower temperature to continue baking, which allows the insides to dry out. So, following hers and several others suggestions I started with 450 degrees for 10 minutes, reduced oven to 350 degrees (too low causes the egg or butter not to bake right) and continued to bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden and sound hollow when tapped.  Remove puffs to wire racks to cool. Immediately cut a slit in each for steam to escape (or poke a hole a few minutes before removing from oven, I’ve done both ways, and either way works fine.)  I have never had to “scoop out” soggy dough.  I also have never had too leave in the oven to prevent falling.  Once cooled, I just pipe in some filling (ziplock baggie works great) If I don’t have pudding on hand, sprayed reddi whip into puff, and topped with chocolate, kids loved them.  They are so wonderful, elegant and easy!!!  Also, I sometimes cut the recipe down to 1/4 (so only one egg, "5 servings") and get 6 nice sized p

I have made 4 batches of these over the past few days and here is what did and they turned out perfect.  I made the pudding mixture with white chocolate pudding and after it set, I folded in 1 cup of whipping cream, whipped into stiff peaks.  Cream puffs need a high temperature so they will rise quickly and leave a hollow center and to set the shape of the shells.  Then they need a lower temperature to continue baking, which allows the insides to dry out.  So I started with 450 degrees for 10 minutes, reduced oven to 375 degress and continued to bake for 20-25 minutes.  Then I sliced a small sliver towards the top of each and continued to bake for another 3 minutes.  I immediately removed   them to a wire rack to cool.  I made my puffs very large (using an ice cream scoop) and had no trouble with sinking.  Then I cut just the top off of each one, filled with pudding mixture and replaced the top.  I also drizzled milk chocolate over each one.  When I removed the top, if there was any uncooked dough, I gently removed it, leaving the shell hollow and firm.

this recipe didn't work at all. I followed at the directions as they were written and they came out looking like cookies. Very eggy, too little flour, and not puffy or sweet at all. The cream filling was really good though so I was able to use that for something else.

made this twice and they didn't rise. I checked out Baking 911 on line and they said to continue cooking the dough for approximatly 3 to 5 minutes to alow moisture to evaporate and to allow the dough to cool before you add the eggs because they will break down and not work as an emulisifier. Also bake for 10 minutes at 425 turn down to 350 and bake a additional 25 minutes. I tried this and it worked out fine. Hope this helps anyone else that is having a problem.

OH MY GODS!!! This is absolutely irresistible! It was a bit messy filling the dough into the pastry bag, because I had never done that before, but it was SO worth it.  I also made one with a spoon, just to see how they would come out, but the ones made with the pastry bag are so beautiful in comparison, I'd rather go through the whole ordeal again. ;)  The dough is a little hard to handle, because it is very sticky and pasty, but I think that just takes some practise. Other than that, this is a foolproof recipe and I didn't think making those delicious little treats would be so easy.  I beat the dough with the dough hooks (rather than using the whisk adaptors) on my hand mixer, that way it was easier to scrape off the dough later.  Oh, and I only used half the amount of filling, because I love the unfilled shells with stews and soups instead of rolls or bread - just as a tip.  Considering the length of this review, I hope it was somewhat helpful. :)

This recipe is amazing!  However, If you do not do it right, you will waste a lot of time and money, so follow these instructions EXACTLY:

1)Make sure measurements are EXACT. Too much or little of one ingredient will make the cream puffs too doughy or runny, and the cream puffs will not puff!

2)You MUST bring the water and butter mixture to a boil.  Otherwise, the starch in the flour will not swell.  You will end up with hard, flat bread.

3)Mix the flour in IMMEDIATELY after the water and butter boil, on the stovetop over low heat.  This is important for reason in 2).

4)Let the dough cool until it is warm.  If it is too hot, the eggs will cook.  When it is warm, and the eggs in one a time, and stir.

5)You MUST stir the dough thoroughly (5 minutes).  I used a whisk to beat the dough mixture.  The dough needs to become have air dissolved in it, so mix it throughly to incorporate as much air as possible.  The dough should be elasticy.

6)Put the cream puffs on the bottom of the rack!  The heat from the bottom of the  oven will cause the cream puffs to rise.  The temperature of the oven MUST be a hot 425 so that the cream puffs rise quickly!!

7)NEVER open the oven to check on the status of the cream puffs.  This will lower the oven temperature, and the creams puffs WILL NOT puff up.

8)AFTER the cream puffs have puffed up, slit a hole in them with a sharp knife or toothpick, so it can dry out.  Cook until inside is dry.

9)Add 2 tsp vanilla and 1 TBSP sugar to cream

Delicious! This was a fun recipe -- I had never made cream puffs before. I followed a lot of reviewers' suggestions. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the pudding mix, used white chocolate pudding, an put the pudding mixture into a ziplock bag to mix (less dishes to wash and then cut off a small corner to use as a pastry bag). For the puff shells, I added 1 tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla, let the dough micture cool for about 10 minutes before adding the eggs and mixing in my stand mixer, and then made the dough balls on the baking sheet small (quarter sized). I baked them at 425 degrees for 10 mins., then at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, and then I turned off the oven and cracked the door and let them sit for 5-10 minutes. Thanks for all the great suggestions and a great recipe, they came out perfectly!

These puffs were delicious!  A tip about puffs going flat: cool the puffs on a cookie rack immediately after taking them out of the oven.  Don't let them sit on the hot tray once they're done baking or they'll collapse.

I think some of the reviewers are making this recipe harder than it is... Some people are saying they followed the instructions and it didn't turn out right? I thought this recipe was super, duper easy, it took less than 30 mins including baking time. and required no adjustments. I threw a cup of water and a stick of butter in a pot and turned it on high. took it to a boil, threw in a cup of flour and the salt, mixed well, then took the pot off the stove and beat in eggs one at a time as per recipe instructions. I put the batter in a plastic baggie and dipped it out on a cookie sheet, 1 tbsp servings, and baked for 22 mins at 425. they came out PERFECT!!!
my husband LOOOOOOOOVED THEM!!!
I mixed about half a large package serving of vanilla pudding with a whole container of cool whip. half the mixture I threw in some melted sweetened bakers chocolate (it came out looking like cookies and cream--yum!) and then I put these in two baggies and pipped them onto the cooled puffs... Just punched them down in the center with my fingers to make a little bowl for the cream...

I've been making cream puffs for years and years using this same recipe for the puffs but a pastry cream for the filling, probably because I'm a traditionalist.  For those who have deflating puffs, I would suggest cooking them just a bit longer before removing them from the oven, then cutting a small hole into a more delicate membrane (not crusty) and setting the cookie sheet back in the over for a couple minutes.  If you are getting too much of a toasty look, lower the temperature 25 degrees and give the puffs a longer cooking time, poke the hole and cook for a few more minutes to let the steam to escape.  If you remove the puffs before they are sufficiently cooked, they will deflate.  For large puffs (8) using this same recipe, lower the temperature to 375 and cut the slit after 40 minutes and back into the oven for another 10.  Generally, I find 12 makes a good size, impressive but not overpowering, cooking in a little shorter time. melted chocolate topping (2 oz. semi-sweet, 2 tbs. butter melted together, then add 2 cups 10x sugar and approximately 2 tbs. milk).  Drizzle over filled puffs...absolutely heavenly.

I made this recipe and found that the cream puffs were just excellent.  The filling I thought needed to be lighter so I whipped 1 cup of whipping creme with 2 tablespoons of sugar until firm.  Then I folded it into the pudding mixture and let it firm up overnight.  I made this for a ladies luncheon for 125 ladies and it was a big hit.

These cream puffs were by far the best I've ever tasted.  I think even better than bakery made.  I made 1/2 with white chocolate and 1/2 vanilla.  Everyone liked the white chocolate better.  I suggest cutting the filling ingredients in half, or making double the amount of pastry.  There is always a lot of filling left over, even if you overstuff the pastry.  This is a must try recipe! Thanks Shellie.

Wow I am a total moron and this was easy and fun. My nickname is "laws of physics" because my excuse for all my baking failures is that the laws of physics do not apply in my stove. The real reason is I like to tinker, and doing that with most recipes means it will end up in the trash.

1) Mix in a half teaspoon vanilla in the PUFF dough just before cooking it. When you spoon the dough onto the baking sheet, don't make the tablespoons too heaping.

2) the FILLING was great with the whipped cream. It also came out great when i used a custard recipe that also contained half and half. DO NOT adulterate this recipe with cool whip. FILLING FLAVORINGS: I found that vanilla and almond and combinations thereof are the nicest.

3) Use a pastry bag to put filling in. If you don't have one, just nick the corner off a ziplock bag, and drop an icing tip inside the bag so it is poking out of the nick. Now fill the bag, press out the air, zipper it, and you have a makeshift pastry bag!

4) If you make the custard filling, let it cool completely before filling the puffs

5) Remove the puffs from the tray with a spatula and poke all with holes before filling (its FAR less hassle).

6) Top with powdered sugar for a nice look and a touch of sweetness

I own a bakery in Illinois and could tell from the start the recipe needed a little tweaking per say. The ingredients are perfect, same recipe I got from my gandma forever ago. However, here in the bakery we bake ours larger than normal making 6 out of this recipe. First, spray your pan, it helps a ton, or for an easy clean up lay down a sheet of parchment paper. Second, we bake ours at 425 for 15 minutes exactly then move to an oven set at 325 and bake for 30 minutes. This helps to ensure a dry puff by slow cooking. Since most do not have two ovens you could do the same by immediately dropping the temp in your oven to 325 and cracking the door while it settles. Once they feel almost hollow, very lightweight when held, set them to cool on a counter or cooling rack, slice in half and scoop out any excess dough on the inside with a spoon before filling. Fill with a piping bag or a spoon and top with powdered sugar or chocolate drizzle and enjoy! Hope this helps.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I received rave reviews from my book club.  Some thought that I had bought them and two people told me that they were the best cream puffs that they had ever eaten.  I made them four times in two days so that I could practice.  I followed another's suggestion by poking a hole in the side with a toothpick when the puffs come out of the oven.  I also stirred in all four eggs at once.  I did not wait until the mixture cooled.  I used the suggested vanilla filling and a satiny chocolate glaze (recipe that I found on this site.)  I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets.  This created perfect puffs that fell off of the cookie sheets and did not even think about sticking!  I did learn from the Cooking 911 website that these should be eaten within one hour for best taste.  If they must be stored, you can refrigerate them filled for up to three days.  If you will not be filling within 24 hours, freeze them.  They are good up to three months in the freezer.  These are quite easy and very impressive.  Thank you so much, Shellie!

The recipe is good, but one very important direction is missing.  I have been making these pastry puffs for 30 years.  Your eggs should be room temperature, and when you add the eggs one at a time, make sure you beat each egg in really, really good, until there is no slime, or until the batter is not shiny anymore.  If you do these steps, your puffs will turn out everytime.  I have tried the other way, and it results in flat puffs.  I never added salt either, and still don't.

Perfect baking: Bake at 400 for 20 minutes.  Without opening the oven door (a strict no-no for puffs), turn oven to 350, bake an additional 25 minutes.  (No poking necessary.) I made once as directions suggest; they fell.  I made once using the above baking technique (my mother's in law, the indisputed queen of puffs in our town); they were perfect.   Second suggestion: leave out overnight, uncovered, before filling.  It dries them more thoroughly.

Absolutely love these cream puffs.  Make the day of-not good the day after-they don't hold up well.  I make them all the time.  I do 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream for the pudding filling. To die for-I could eat the whole bowl without the puff shell. After I fill the shells I melt together 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 tsp or so of veg shortening and drizzle over the tops(dunk a spoon in the chocolate and drizzle back and forth over the puffs-better to put on wax paper for easy cleanup) and then sprinkle on conf sugar.  People have questioned if I really got them at some fancy NY bakery (insult to me but proves the recipe great)  You'll get compliments all day long....

I truly loved these puffs. I used w's suggestions of 3 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 TBsp sugar in the dough. I made sure to beat air into the dough and poke a whole after 15 minutes in the other. After 20 they were absolutely perfect and flaky. I tried something new though. I cooked them in a mini muffin pan of 24. They cooked up perfectly, I thought it was a good way to let them rise.  Topped some strawberries on these bad boys and they were fantastic!

This is almost the exact same cream puff recipe that my mother passed down to me years ago, in that it uses the same ingredients, as well as the same amount of ingredients.  The  difference is in the baking process. My mom's recipe states to bake in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn oven down to 325 degrees and bake for an additional 10- 15 minutes. I did try both ways, and I have to say I prefer the two oven temperature method. The initial hot temperature helps the puffs to rise and brown more quickely, the lower temperature slows the browning process as the puffs finish baking. Just a suggestion.  Also, some reviewers recommend adding vanilla and sugar to the puff mixture.  The sweetness will come from the filling and frosting, there is absolutely no need to add these two ingredients to the cream puff dough.  I did try this method though, and thought that the puffs had a very odd flavor and ended up throwing them away. I used the Creamy Vanilla Pudding recipe from this site to fill cream puffs, delicious!

Fabulous!  I added 1/2 tsp. Vanilla and 1/4 tsp. Almond extract to my 4 large eggs.  I put my hot dough in my stand mixer, and slowly added the egg mixture, then mixed on medium speed for 3 min.  I used my small cookie scoop to place them on an ungreased nonstick baking sheet.  I baked at 450 for 10 min. then 365 for 20 min. I then cut holes with a thin knife in the center of each puff, placed them back in the oven with the door slightly open, and turned the oven off. Forty minuets later they were cool to the touch, and perfect.

I have made these several times and have gotten better with each time. Ive also learned that any leftover puffs make great little sandwiches stuffed with tuna or chicken salad! A few tips I've learned, 1)Yes you must poke a hole and let them dry out completely or else they will collapse! 2)Adding 1 tbsp. vanilla or rum extract to the filling and/or the dough mixture improves and impresses. 3)Definitely put a piece of parchment paper on your cookie sheet and prevent sticking or spraying the pan. 4) Use a pastry bag to fill in through that hole you poked, easy and pretty! 5) After moving your dough ball into the mixing bowl, let it cool for 10 minutes before adding eggs (also better if they are room temp). After experimenting with the amount off eggs, I liked best, 3 whole eggs + 1 egg white. 6) Dusting with powdered sugar is a quick way to give them a "ta-dah" look.  These are just so yummy and you can get very creative with the filling-They've become a favorite in our home.

Great simple pastries.  Made about 15 medium sized puffs. I just filled them with instant vanilla pudding and they were delicous. Might consider poking a hole in the top on the last five minutes of cooking to let some of the moisture out and cook the insides a little more.

OK---dont' know what I did wrong, because I have made lots of Cream Puffs using other recipes and never had a problem with the "puffing" up, well I did with these. Don't know why? Will probably go back to my usual recipe....

We love these... and so do our families and friends. I make them often and my husband even takes them to work for coworkers. The filling is awesome (I also use a similar filling in cakes) and this little treat is quick and easy to make. Don't be intimidated by the technique... this is a yummy dessert!!  I've made this at least a hundred times... and my little tip for those whose puff falls... make sure you leave it in the oven long enough to cook thoroughly. I think part of the problem with some disaster puffs here is that people want to have that perfect golden brown appearance and so they take the puff out of the oven too soon. I never have a problem with mine falling and I only sometimes poke a hole with a toothpick (I can tell which ones need a little prick in the puff). If you take the puffs out of the oven before they have fully set up... even with the toothpick trick they will fall because they do not have good stability. Also... I use a pastry bag to make uniform puffs. I then use another pastry bag to fill the puffs once they have finished baking.

I've been making these for years and the list of ways to change it up are endless. I've added orange peel and grand marnier to the cream, I've spread a thin layer of raspberry preserves on the inside of the shell, then filled w/ the vanilla cream mixture blended with raspberry liquor. I've made tiny shells and fille with savory fillings like crabmeat dip or mexican chili inspired beef and cheese. Chocholate pudding and godiva liquor is my husbands favorite...

I have been making cream puffs for 50 years, the pate a choux pastry recipe is the same. Have NEVER had a problem with it. Drying in the oven after it is turned off for about 15 minutes does make them a little crisper. You can use any pastry cream recipe, ice cream, etc. you want to fill them. Be creative. You can also fill them with chicken salad, etc., it is very versatile.

I made this for a party. This recipe came out fabulous. I doubled the recipe.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers: I added the vanilla extract.

I piped in chocolate pudding filling and vanilla pudding filling for variety. I also drizzled a chocolate ganache over the puffs - they looked so professional.

1 Tip - my oven is small and I have only one baking tray so I had to do the puffs in shifts - make sure the tray is not hot - otherwise the puffs will fall (flop is a better word).

I also made tsp drops of the batter rather than tbsp - so the result was near bite sized portions. I did not have ONE puff left!

I made this last night and they were AMAZING! I followed the instruction exactly but did add a dash of vanilla. Also I took everyone suggestions i.e. poking a hole with a toothpick and leaving in shut off/open oven for an hour. I am not sure if it was needed but I didn't want to take a chance and let me tell you they looked as if they should be on the cover of a magazine. They tasted even better. Here is my suggestion: I chose not to use the filling (but I am thinking I might next time) I use Ice Cream and hot fudge. OMG So good! Also don't put un-used puffs in an air tight container. I did and the once crispy puffs turned into a soggy mess. I think it might be becasue they were a tad warm still but tonight when I make them for the family again I am NOT putting them in anything air tight!

I loved this recipe the only thing that the original didn't say to do but is very important is to let the dough cool and rest for 20mins before adding the eggs, I also pull out the gooey stuff from the pastry before filling it to cut the egg flavor and maximize the filling room. Also for the chocolate lovers in my family I used chocolate pudding  It was a hit!!

I made these for the first time tonight and the puffs came out just right. I'd give this one five stars except I feel much of the credit is due to MommyFromSeattle's review for her tips on simplifying the procedure.  Using MFS's tweaks, this recipe is a keeper! I'm going to have fun experimenting with different fillings for these easy and delicious cream puffs.

Before selecting this recipe, I read all the reviews and other on-line information until I felt comfortable with the project.  I also noted that the shells can be made ahead and frozen for up to 3 months.  They are filled before serving. This allows you to be more creative in your presentation by having the messy part done in advance.  I used a cookie scoop ( 1 inch diameter) for the puffs to be uniform.  Be sure you use parchment paper on the cookie sheets.  Allow the dough to cool (5 minutes) before adding the eggs, one at a time.  Watch carefully so you get a uniform mixture. I added 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 Tablespoon sugar as others have suggested.  With care, this can be a spectacular dessert!

I've attempted this recipe twice. The 1st time was a complete flop (pardon the pun - so was the puff!) On the 2nd try, the 1st batch also collapsed on me after I pricked the holes in them & removed them from the oven.  For the 2nd batch, I baked them at 220 deg C for 10 mins and another 10 mins @ 190 deg C.  Just after end of baking, I pricked the holes in them and let them sit for 10 mins with the oven off.  Thank Heavens, these did not collapse on me!  I did follow hints by MommyfromSeattle and some other kind souls. I shall be attempting another batch today until I get them right!  Could not find instant vanilla pudding mix in my area, so did the whipped cream filling.  But I think I Will perhaps do the Pastry Cream thing today per recipe posted on this site and subsequently the custard filling. Keeping my fingers (and toes) crossed this time for actual success!  If you fail, do try again but I would advise reading the reviews as they are truly of enormous help. 
**UPDATE** On my latest attempt, I used a large star tip to pipe the dough.  These baked up very nicely.  However, my tablespoonfuls still collapsed on me! I will try again as I think I need to bake them longer to get them to dry out.  I also did the Pastry cream found of this site and it was really delicious though one must follow the directions carefully.

Great recipe! I did add all four eggs at once , It did not make a difference in adding them one at a time.  After reading other reviews, I did notice some saying the cream was way too thick.  To change this, use 1 cup heavy cream and two cups milk.  Also, MAKE SURE YOU USE PARCHMENT PAPER ON BAKING SHEET BEFORE PLACING IN THE OVEN, also, when you take the puffs out if the oven, USE A TOOTHPICK AND POKE INTO SIDES OF PUFFS TO LET STEAM, this wil prevent deflation.  I did not pipe the filling in, I simply used a small pearing knife and sliced them in half, heaped the cream on and put the top back on.  I also drizzled melted milk chocolate over these. Turned out beautiful.  
Thanks

I had one problems but they were my doing. I stacked the puffs on top of one another to cool down and it made some deflate. So for anyone out there don't do that lol. I had way too much filling left over but it just meant I got to eat it and I put vanilla extract in the filling. Overall easy to make and great tasting. I recommend using an icing bag and for any aussies out there they may struggle like i did to work out what our version of heavy cream is its thick.

These were great but I wanted something different for a luncheon.  So I filled the puffs with egg salad, tuna salad and chicken salad.  I was the hit of the party.  Everyone thought I worked so hard and it was so easy

I made this cream puffs last night and let me tell you what I do. I made the shells as the recipe said. I don't add sugar or vanilla or anything else to flavor my shells as the filling is usually soo sweet. Be carefull not to add your eggs right away. Let the rest of the batter cool down or your eggs will start to cook or "scramble". After the eggs are combined, I spoon the mixture into a freezer bag and cut off one corner and pipe the "dough" onto my cookie sheet. After my cookie sheet is full, I dip my finger in a little water and push down the top just a little (so it doesn't have that hershey's kiss top). Then, I sprinkle a very little sugar on them right befor I bake them. Normally I bake them on the middle rack of my oven and only for about 15 to 20 minutes or untill they are golden brown. Take them off the cookie sheet asap and with a knife, cut a slit into the side of the cream puff. After they are completly cooled, I make up some instant pudding mix (any flavor, and maybe add some cool whip with it if I have it on hand) and spoon the pudding mix into a freezer bag, cut off one side and gently pipe the pudding into the slit I had made earlier to let them cool. And TADAA. You could drizzle some melted chocolate on top if you want or even frost them. but trust me. They are FANTASTIC. You really can't screw up a cream puff. I hope this gave some of you ideas.

Excellent recipe! I wanted a easy but impressive dessert to take to a potluck and this was perfect. Make sure you have the water and butter still boiling when you add the flour, otherwise the puffs won't rise at all. I used more milk and less cream in the filling and it was still great. I melted some semi-sweet chocolate with a little cream and drizzled it over the filled puffs. Yum!

I made these last night for my brother's birthday. They were delicious! I did add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough mixture and followed other comments to bake it @ 425 degrees for 10 minutes then 375 degrees for 15 minutes. After that I turned off the oven and let it set for 5-10 minutes with the door slightly open. Mine did not deflate at all. They were perfect! Make sure you let your dough mixture cool before you add the eggs. I made about 60 mini-puffs. Thank you for such an easy delicious recipe. The pudding was delicious too :)

these are spectacular.  the only modifications i made were to add 1 Tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to the pastry mix.   i also baked for 10 minutes at 425 and then brought the temperature down to 375 for 15 minutes to get the color and the puff right.   keep the puffs small as recommended in other posts.  these are a sure hit.

These are a hit whenever I make them!  Even for picky dessert eaters, this one always get raves!  Although I like the filling in this recipe, I've experimented with several kinds.  I've used different kinds of puddings, like chocolate and banana, I've used a tub of cool whip folded into pre-made vanilla pudding, I've used dream whip, cream cheese and powdered sugar, I've used whipped cream and cocoa powder.  The one that people seem to like the best is when I use a combination of cheesecake-flavored pudding mix, whipped cream cheese, and heavy whipping cream.  I call them my "cheesecake cream puffs".  I know it sounds disgustingly fattening and rich, just don't over-fill the puffs.  And it may be wise to eat you cream puff with a side of Lipitor!!!!!!

These were wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. It is a really good idea to make them small. The dough really expands and a small amount will turn into a large puff. I kept them about the size of a quarter like another reviewer had mentioned. 

There were so many of them I put them in a zip lock bag in the freezer. They are really good frozen too. We have been snacking on them all week. 

I will definately make this again!

TEN STARS!! Excellent results. I used lemon pudding and dusted with powdered sugar for half the batch, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL; and used coconut cream pudding and white choc chips melted with a touch of vegetable oil for the other half... AWESOME. The use of a pastry bag to pipe the filling worked like a charm. Honestly, they look like they came from a bakery and this was my first attempt ever at cream puffs... you won't be sorry. DEFINITELY WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

This recipe was really good. I read some reviews that said they wouldn't dry out but they will if you make them the size the recipe calls for. By the way it works just as well to add the eggs to the pan and wisk them in one at at time (after you remove it from the heat of course) and it saves on dishes!

 fine, I poke a hole, but they always go flat! what am I doing wrong? And I bake them for 25 min, and they still aren't done. They look great in the oven, and right when I pull them out, but then they go flat, and they are gooey inside. What am I doing wrong? Can anybody help?

I LOVE making cream puffs and this recipe is perfect, although I would recommend eliminating the salt if you use salted butter.  After years of making do with collapsing, eggy puffs (still loved them), I came across the cure:  Bake puffs for 20 min at 450, then reduce the heat to 350 and cook for 5 min; reduce heat again to 250 and cook another 5 min; then turn the oven off and let cook another 10 minutes.  I promise this works and it's not nearly as tedious as it sounds.  If you're making small puffs (24-30 from this recipe), cook at 450 for only 15 minutes--the rest is the same, no matter what size. BTW, you can add all those eggs in at once as long as you do it quickly and have that hand mixer already going.  As long as you beat the mixture until it's thick and glossy, you'll be fine.  Trust me - I just did 200 for my niece's wedding reception to stuff with chicken salad and they turned out great!

This recipe is a great recipe. I read a lot of the reviews before I started to see if I should modify anything the first time around. Oh wow are there a lot of modifications people said were necessary or would make these better! I decided I would follow the recipe exactly the first time and then decide for myself, which is what I did. The only thing I did do differently was that I let the dough cool for a little while before I beat in the eggs. It made sense that if you beat in eggs to really hot dough they could curdle. My dough was still very warm and the eggs did fine. I'm not even sure if cooling the dough made any difference at all. So I baked them on an air bake pan you can buy from walmart or target. It is a cookie sheet but it's called "air bake pan". I bake EVERYTHING on these pans, they are great. My puffs were perfect! They didn't stick at all and baked completely hollow which made filling super easy. I did use a different recipe for the filling because this filling was not sweet hardly at all. I found a recipe on this site called "Holland Cream". It was perfect for these!

These were delicious! I used 1 tsp of vanilla that I added when I added the eggs. You don't need to use the mixer either, just mix with a wooden spoon. I used a heaping tsp of better for each one and it made them bite sized, I got 24 out of 1 batch. Definitely line the pan with parchment paper and once they're done cooking poke a hole in each with a toothpick so they don't deflate. These also taste great with chocolate drizzled on top! And if you don't want to make the pastry part then make the cream. It tastes great by itself or with fresh fruit, cookies, etc.

Ok, I LOVE the puffs but the filling? Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT USE INSTANT PUDDING!! Use the kind you have to cook!!!! Let it come to room temp then mix in a few dallops of Cool Whip. The texture,the creamyness, THE TASTE... is SOoooooO much better! =)

The pastry on this is perfect...I have tried several others that called for shortening and they just did not turn out fluffy and puffy.  They were also greasy and I followed the directions to the tee! Now these are perfect, so if you have had problems with other recipes give this one a try!  I made a small batch to be sure they worked.  I got my water butter mixture to a full rolling boil & pored the sifted flour in all at once and just kept stirring & almost instantly had a ball, which I poured into a glass bowl. I stirred my eggs in with a fork stirring very quickly. I did not add salt as I used salted butter. I made a spiced rum whipping cream that was sweetened , with a chocolate cinnamon glaze...They tasted good. I will also use this recipe for savory bites, with a smoked salmon filling. I really love this recipe and am VERY HAPPY I found it. I think to drop these by small teaspoons full is the way to really get a bite sized treat. I also agree with the person who said to use parchment paper. This has been fun and will us this recipe again. Thanks Shellie for submiting it...

this is the exact recipe that I have used for years, a few tips..... before you place them in the oven spray them with a bit of cold water and also as you are placing them in the oven give the oven a light spary of water... I'm not sure what it does but my mother always did it and they always puffed wonderfully... also start them in a hot oven 425 degrees and then lower temp after 15 minutes to 375 if you use these few tips they will never fail.

I've made these for years, but what we do is when they are done, spoon out the soft dough inside, rather than waiting for them to dry out...

This is such an easy and wonderful recipe. For those of you who are having issues with the puffs not rising or puffing, after you form the ball with the butter mixture and flour, let it sit and cool for about five minutes before adding the eggs. If the ball is too hot it will cook the eggs and turn into a ddough vs a puff.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. Luckily, before I started baking I read the comment section to find some tips. The only thing I had to do was make sure all the steam came out of the puffs by poking a small hole in every one. After I let all the steam release from the puffs, I used a piping tool I got from Target. I just looked in the cooking section and found this cylindrical object with a needle-like point to insert the cream into the puffs with. It was perfect! The puffs were delicious and light and the cream was superb. Honestly, I ate too many but my stomach was sore of those delicious bite sized drops of heaven. Needless to say, the recipe was terrific even for the most amateur chef (me).

I made these with sugar free vanilla pudding, and since there is no sugar in the puff recipe, this was a wonderful sugar free treat:-)  I filled them from the top, leaving some pudding sticking out. Looked and tasted yummy:-) I made cream puffs only once before, back when I was around 12 or 13 years old. This is the same recipe as the one in my old cookbook from the 70's. Will definitely make these again very soon. Oh, bye the way, there was absolutely no deflating and I didn't pick holes in them, like other's have done.

These were good... much better than the frozen kind, which always leave a waxy aftertaste in my mouth. I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the flour mixture. They puffed up perfectly and after exactly 20 minutes of bake time, I took them out of the oven and poked each one with a toothpick per the suggestions of other reviewers. I'm not sure how some people are ending up with flat puffs. One only way I'm guessing this could happen is if the dough isn't the right consistency before you start making the balls. The dough should be extremely sticky and like elastic. In fact, I could only achieve the right consistency with a handmixer... just mixing it with a spoon left me with lumpy, unmixed batter. With my handmixer, though, the dough got so sticky that I ended up having to use a spoon to scrape it off the beaters.

These are wonderful. I didn't cool my batter before adding the eggs, I just beat them in on high speed to incorporate them quickly. I had no trouble with deflation, either, so I didn't poke holes. Just make sure you bake them long enough so the insides aren't soggy. For the filling, I mixed two boxes vanilla pudding mix with 2 1/2 cups eggnog, 1 1/2 cups milk and about 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg. Then I whipped the 2 cups of cream separately and folded it into the pudding. Filled the puffs, piled them on a pretty plate, sifted confectioner's sugar over the top and garnished with sprigs of fresh rosemary and sugared cranberries. Lovely recipe!

No mixer, so I followed the instructions exactly (although I DID sieve the flour and salt) with a strong arm and a wooden spoon. Also I ran out of baking sheets, so I used a doubly-folded aluminium foil aheet on top of a tray instead. Puffs turned out perfect - keep in mind that they will swell to three times in size - a heaping tablespoonful will give you a bun-size one-per-person type puff, while a heaping teaspoonful will give you the smaller, French-type profiterole size. I split the puffs and filled them with vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with chocolate before serving (optional). UPDATE - heaping tablespoonfuls bake in 20 minutes exactly, teaspoonfuls in 15 minutes. Used a toothpick to poke a hole in each puff while they cooled on the wire racks. None deflated, all perfect.

I found this recipe looking to replace my old cream puff recipe.  I absolutely love this, I read the tips about keeping the puffs in the oven with the heat off for an hour to prevent sagging.  But I didn't have time, and found that they didn't sag at all!  I used a melon ball scoop to measure out the dough.

The shell was amazing. They had a great texture and they puffed up perfectly. Definitely better when chilled (my brothers couldn't keep their hands off them so we only got to chill half of the batch). It's great with chocolate glaze (I used Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate, butter and milk). I followed some recommendations of the other members -- I left them in the oven for a while longer than prescribed (then again, I'm from a tropical country so I guess adjustments for humidity were in order). Great recipe. I'm making another batch tonight! Cheers!

Very Good.  I kind of freaked out when I saw the batter was so runny, so I added more flour.  As a result, the puffs didn't puff.  But, the pastry was still light and airy and delectable.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and that reduced some of the egginess of my first "tester puff".  Only make as many as your family can eat, because they don't store well in the fridge.

These are so good and easy. I have made cream puff/eclaires many times and they have been good but much more difficult - this was a wonderful find! One helpful hint to prevent deflating, if after you cook the shells, you can turn off the oven and leave the puffs in there for about 5 minutes. They will keep their shape better and cook the insides a little longer without burning!

Awsome! I used my airbake, and they came out beautiful. The only thing you have to remember is to let the dough cool down before you add the eggs. I used 1 pkg. dream whip and 1 pkg. of pudding and mixed them together. I used 1 recipe and got about 60 bite size puffs.

These are delicious, and so easy to make. I would recommend drying the shells in the oven as it cools, otherwise they tend to get a little mushy. I usually drizzle them with melted chocolate for some added taste & pizazz.

I love the puff recipe but instead of the filling recipe listed I used 
1 box of instant vanilla pudding (mixed according to box) with
1/2 tub of Cool Whip and 
a few drops of almond extract.  DELICIOUS!!!

What a great dessert!  I love to bring easy finger foods like this to different events.  People who don't cook, think that you've slaved away in the kitchen to make these (if they only knew how easy they were).  
This recipe doubled beautifully and I used instant cheesecake filling and instant chocolate fudge filling for the centers. Dusted em' with powdered sugar and watched them fly off the platter!!!

Made these for Valentine's Day. Gave some to the neighbors, the UPS driver, the in laws and saved some for home. They were incredible. (I did go with a double batch because they looked so awesome!) Will be making these again.

Yummy!!! Came out perfect my first time! I did add a dab of vanilla & about 1tbsp sugar to the batter. Baked 20min then (after reading reviews) poked a hole with a toothpick, turned off the oven & let them sit in there with the door open for another 10-15min.

Flavor was great.  Cream filling excellent and the texture of the puffs were great.  I loved them and I will definitely be making again....why the 3 star rating, I took other reviewers advice and poked holes into the sides of the puffs 2 minutes before they were done with wooden skewers and they did not deflate.  Out of curiosity I left one puff alone with no holes and it deflated.  That was my only casualty but don't worry it did not get wasted, one must test before serving to make sure they are really good lol.   The writer should include those instructions which is why I only gave 3 stars.

After making this recipe 2 times and it was a flop, tasted good but the shells were terribly floppy, I found out that you have to keep the water, butter, flour mixture over the heat til it forms a nice dough ball. if you don't it will turn into a liquidity mixture, I recommend watching the video to see what the consistency should be.

Not that it needs another rating, but YUM! Fantastic fresh flavor, with the addition of a splash of vanilla. We didn't use parchment paper and they still turned out fine at 21 minutes. Keep the batter balls small - they puff up beautifully.

I have always been a bit scared to make these only to find out it was actually very easy.  And so delicious.  It will be fun to try different flavored fillings.  Followed directions exactly and they turned out beautiful.  I would just add dont forget to dust with powedered sugar...!

These are terrific!  I have made these several times, this time using only 3 eggs bc I didn't have a 4th and they turned out perfect.  I didn't really notice a difference.  I coat my cookie sheet with vegetable oil, lightly so they are easy to remove.  Also, to the reviewer who asked why they were going flat...don't open your oven when you check on them.  The loss of heat in your oven will make them go flat.  I had this problem until a friend going to culinary school told me why.

I tried this recipe with a bunch of high school students in a 2-week international cooking class. I read the reviews first -- all I added was 2 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tbsp. sugar. I kept everything else the same and they were perfect. They stayed nice and puffy, never sagged, and didn't taste too egg-y. :)

This recipe is fantastic!  A major hit at all functions I go to.  I will add though that one review listed here said to set the oven at 425 and bake for 15 minutes, then turn down to 325 and bake for about 10-15 more minutes.  Then turn the oven off and leave it propped with a pot holder for about and hour-helps to dry out the puffs.  I've made these a couple of times now and this has worked both times.  YUM!

My hubby and I are going to a friend's house for an Italian dinner tonight and I said I'd bring dessert. I had considered making cannoli but remembered making Cream puffs years ago and how everyone loves them. This recipe with all the wonderful advice on the reviews is perfect, so give it a try!! Here is my process: I added some vanilla extract to the dough and just dumped in all the eggs, at the end, while mixing with a hand mixer. That's good advice as it turned out great! I used a soup spoon to drop globs on parchment paper. My oven bakes a tad hot so I checked after 10 minutes and turned it down to 400 for the last 13 minutes. I also poked them with a toothpick when finished baking and let them cool in the oven with the door ajar. I only made 1/2 a batch of the filling and it nicely filled 20 of the puffs. For the filling, I put the  milk, whipcream, extract & pudding into a plastic container and shook it up. (I added a dash of almond extract). After the puffs were cooled I sliced off the tops and filled with a spoonful of pudding. I replaced the top and dusted them all with powered sugar. YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!. I think I'll fill the four remaining puffs with some Butter pecan Icecream for a special treat.

I also followed most of the advice that other people gave and the recipe was amazing! One thing I found out was necessary is to add all 4 eggs, not 3. The first time I baked these, the puff pastries turned out flat. Then I read in a book that if there aren't enough eggs, it won't rise enough. The next time when I added the complete amount of eggs, they were perfect!

I was a little disappointed in how "eggy" these turned out.  The filling was GREAT and you'd never know it was pudding from a box, as long as you add 1 t. of vanilla to the filling while you are mixing it.  I threw out the bread part and saved the filling, and I am going to try again with 1 less egg and also adding 1 t. vanilla to the dough.  Take my advice...!

this is sooo easy to make. i'm a total beginner. this was my first time trying out cream puffs and they came out perfect. i didn't have to poke holes in them like some reviews suggested and i didn't have any deflate. this was probably because i wanted bite sized ones so i only dropped 1/2 tsp balls of dough on the pan. i did add a little vanilla to the dough and it tasted great. i don't know what it would have tasted like without the vanilla though... excellent recipe!

Very easy recipe. I accidentlly bought whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream, but it turned out pretty good anyway. Also for an extra touch, I cut up some strawberries and stuffed the shelss before piping in the filling.

Great flavor, but my cream puff mix was too watery. However, I made cream "cakes" because they turned out flat. Still, the vanilla cream topping was delicious!

Not sure what I did wrong.  I made two batches.  I burned the first batch after 10 minutes of being in the oven.  I read all the reviews and followed everything very closely (a little added sugar, poked holes in them after 17 minutes, made sure to beat in lots of air, etc).  They came out slightly puffed but then immediately fell and then looked like little pancakes! I tasted one and it tasted like paper. Guess I'm not cut out for cream puff making...

Delicious! In PR we called these "palitos de jacob" when coated by caramelized sugar. The sugar hardens and gives them a nice crunch. Of course they are awesome without it as well. I filled mine with vanilla pudding. I made the pudding with way less milk than called for in the box so it wouldn't be runny. Next time I'll add some vanilla and sugar to the dough.

Great recipe! I was afraid the cream puffs wouldn't rise because they looked so flat when I put them on the baking sheet, but to my surprise, it did! Oh yes, I read another review stating to leave the cream puffs near the heat after it finishes so the middle won't be wet, and I strongly advise you do that, because the inside of mine were a bit wet, just a little.
Oh, instead of heavy cream, I just used skim milk (to save calories), and it turned out fine, and I also used olive oil instead of butter so I don't get the trans fat and I don't think anything changed. Thanks! Will make again!

I made this recipe for a company potluck and they were a huge hit! I used coconut cream pudding mix and swirled chocolate on the top of each cream puff, then sprinkled powdered sugar. Excellent presentation and they were rich and delicious. Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe!

my bf loved these and had to give some to his grandma. the next time i saw her she giggled and said that they were horrible which means that she liked them a lot and according to my bf she's been trying to figure out how i made the filling. my family loved these i even had my sister shove a pen in my hand and say "if you changed anything...write, before you forget!" i whipped a cup of the cream first then mixed it in with 2 small packages of pudding (one fat free one regular) and substituted the 2nd cup of cream with half and half since its what i had on hand. i looked at a couple other recipes for pate a choux on the foodtv website and decided to add 1 tbs sugar to the flour mixture which i stirred while on the stove to get rid of some excess moisture then let it sit in a mixing bowl for about 5 min before adding the eggs. after taking the shells out of the oven i poked a little hole on the side to let the steam come out.

These creme puffs were simple, but good.  For those of you who like a sweet creme filling, try this:  Combine 1 small pkg. instant french vanilla pudding, 1/4 c. powdered sugar, and 1 c. cold milk.  Beat on low speed for 1 minute.  Fold in 1 8-oz. thawed Cool Whip and refrigerate.  This is a frosting recipe for angel food cakes but is really good in the creme puffs.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top after filling them.  Really good!

THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST ATTEMPT AT CREAM PUFFS.
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY EASIER OR MORE PLEASANT
TO MAKE!  I DID USE A PASTRY BAG WITH A FLUTED
STAR TIP TO MAKE FANCY SHMANCY PUFFS, AND THEY
LOOKED GREAT.  AS FOR THE CUSTARD, I MADE IT FROM
SCRATCH USING GALE GANDS RECIPE FROM FOOD NETWORK.
RAVE REVIEWS FROM ALL AT EASTER, DEFINITELY
"GODDESS APPROVED" !!! XOXOXOXO

Tastes amazing!  My guests wanted to lick the bowl!!  Just beware not to overcook them slightly you will have an issue with getting them off of the pan, and therefore have only half a puff.  If this happens, just turn two "puffs" into a top and bottom...your guests will still love them!!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I have never made cream puffs before and this was so easy.  I didn't have the problem of the inside being too mushy like previous chefs. I accidentally put a teaspoon of salt, I was so afraid they were going to be too salty, but they weren't. They were so amazingly perfect.  They tasted great too!  I can't wait to experiment with different flavors of pudding.  These will definitely be a staple at my house!  The only way they could be any more perfect is if they were guilt free! :)

Great recipe.  I was worried, as previous reviews had stated, about the "eggy" taste, so I used 3 eggs instead of 4.  It worked out beautifully.  They came out nice & high and were a breeze to fill.  Just don't count on the inside being dry -- I doubt that could happen without burning the outside.  Simply pull or cut open and remove moist interior before filling.

Very easy to make and very good. After trying the original recipe, I found the following changes to make this even better. The results taste like a Boston crème donut.
1.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added 1 tbsp. Of sugar and 2 teaspoon of vanilla to batter.  I used a large cookie scoop (about 2 tbsp.) to put onto cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. 
2.  I did use the toothpick to poke a hole after they came out of the oven.
3.  I used 3 cups of light cream instead of 2 cups heavy and 1 cup regular milk. 
4.  I added 1/4 cup or so (didn't measure) of Disarrano Amaretto to the pudding mix at the same time as I added the milk.
5.  I melted Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers and then drizzled the chocolate over the top.

They came out looking like something from the bakery.

Thanks the great recipe.

Excellent and super easy! I added 2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tbl. of sugar to the dough before adding the eggs. Let the dough cool before you add the eggs! I read the reviews and poked a hole  in the puffs 1 min before they were done but my beautiful puffs collapsed! Don't poke a hole in them!  My second batch were nice and puffy.  The filling is wonderful! They were a huge hit!

A couple of things that may help with baking.  Ovens are all different.  Baking times of recipes are estimates, not exact times.  Bake till done, it takes experience and patience to learn.  Eggs come in different sizes.  Large eggs are about 2 ounces per egg.  If you use a different size egg you need to adjust for that.  If you can invest in a scale, weighing ingredients is much more accurate.  Baking is a science, the recipes are formulas.  It is sometimes frustrating for those that love to cook, adding, tasting and creating as they go.  Once baked, there's not much to change, but maybe cover it with chocolate:)

Very tasty! They devoured them at international fiesta today. I don't know if I'm just lucky or I made my puffs a bit smaller but I didn't poke holes and they didn't sink. I used french vanilla and they were sublime. Will try drizzling with chocolate next time.

Some tips - 

a) Let the dough cool before adding eggs.  The eggs will cook/scramble otherwise

b) Poke a hole 2-3 minutes before taking them out of the oven - this lets the heat escape and won't collapse the puffs.

WoW!!! Never made these in my life and they came out Perfect!!  I don't like the custard style cream puffs.  These were amazing!  I followed the recipe to a T but for using cheesecake flavored pudding instead of vanilla, and adding vanilla extract to the dough.  I used a tablespoon to drop the dough (on parchment paper) which obviously made them a little bigger, baked exactly 20 minutes.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar.  My co-workers think I am quite a talented baker (which I am ;-) but in reality, these were sooo quick and easy!  You wont find a better cream puff recipe.

This is the typical pate a choux which works out very well.  The filling, although quick and easy, was too heavy and the taste of the heavy cream was dominant.  I would cut way back on the heavy cream the next time so I’d taste more of the vanilla custard flavor.

These came out bakery perfect! However, I added 1/2 tsp Vanilla extract and rather than waiting 5 minutes to add the eggs one by one, I beat the eggs & tempered them with the hot dough by adding 1 tablespoon of dough into the eggs and beat it like crazy. I did that 4x before adding the eggs to the dough. By tempering the eggs, you don't have to worry about the eggs cooking before it's all blended. After baking, I did poke a hole on the side to release any steam.

These were incredible! I am an average baker, and these turned out perfect and puffed with the recipe just as is. I made half in the recommended tablespoon size, and half extra large. To make them extra special, I melted some dark chocolate and dunked the tops and I also put a thin smear of strawberry rhubarb jam on the inside along with the pudding. Yum! I will definitely be making these again soon.

Absolutly delicious and elegant! I never bought the ones that come frozen from costco, but my mother-in-law did, and I am so against anything frozen, processed, or filled with preservatives therefor I make everything I can at home! SO I finally came around to making these. I had perfect results. I baked them at 400 degrees in my gas convection vs. 425 bc gas usually bakes faster. So 25 min was perfect they were golden brown and the puffed up perfectly as well. I did poke a hole after they came out but it wasnt even necessary bc they had created their own little holes bc they puffed up beautifully. I had no problems whats so ever this is a no fail recipe and easy if u follow. OoO and I filled these beautiful little puffs with lemon pastry cream oooo soo elegant and delish. I will however try the vanilla or white chocolate pudding filling suggested and will drizzle with chocolate next time too. Thanks for a great recipe.

Turned out very well.  Definitely make sure to allow them to bake completely.  My first batch in the oven didn't get to go long enough and fell like others are complaining about.  Second batch...perfect.  I also used the Pro Ganache and the vanilla pudding (mixed with homemade whipped cream) recipes from this site for a filling and chocolate topping.  Yum.

One of my family's favorites.  I've used Vanilla, Chocolate, Coconut Cream & Pistachio pudding mixes as filling.  I've also used "Dad's Pumpkin Chiffon Pie" mix (submitted by Jennifer Powell) for filling for a halloween party.  I have also sprinkled puffs with powdered sugar, used "Chantilly Cake Frosting" submitted by Linda Waddy [omitting macadamia nuts & coconut] & have drizzled melting chocolate as toppers.

Drool......
I added sugar to the mix. no vanilla because I didn't have any and that's the only change I made. Second thought, I put a little bit of chocolate frosting on the tops eclair style and only used 2% milk in the pudding. I want more...

I did not care for this recipe. When putting the ingredients together in the right order and the directed amount, the outcome was as hard as a rock and doughy in the center. I double checked everything, and there were no mistakes made.

GREAT recipe! Very easy to make! I had the best luck filling them with a decorating bag with a fine star tip. Drizzled with melted chocolate...Delicious!

These turned out perfectly.  The pastry itself reminded me of something that one could buy at a bakery and the cream was delicate yet sweet in flavor.  I would definitely make these again.  Perfect for parties and get togethers.

These turned out perfectly.  I made the pudding with half and half (although after filling the cream puffs I had a lot of pudding left over--next time I'll just make one mix).  The dough came together nicely.  I made 16 cream puffs so they're slightly bigger.  They were done in 21 minutes using parchment paper to cover the pan.  I followed another reviewers advice and used a toothpick to poke a hole in the side of each cream puff immediately after pulling them out of the oven.  Then allowed them to cool on the pan.  This worked pretty well, I only had one deflate on me.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

My first time making cream puffs and it was a success!   I didn't have butter so I had to use tub margarine and it surprisingly worked well.  Followed the directions exactly using a stand mixer (no need to cool the dough) and baked at 425 for 20 minutes.  MUST POKE the puffs with a toothpick right out of the oven to let steam out and prevent deflation.  I used Cheesecake jello pudding instead of vanilla for the filling and sprinkled with powdered sugar to finish the look.  Kids and adults devoured these at a party.  I love it when a recipe delivers on the first try! :)

These are very yummy, but only put 2 or 3 eggs in. 4 eggs is way to eggy! I have made them with chocolate pudding too and drizzled choc. sauce on top. Just make sure to poke them when they come out of the oven (20 mins) so they don't fall.  Super easy and really fast to make!

These look and taste great!  My only complaint is the cream filling.  I found that it made way too much.  Next time I would use only one (1.5) oz. box of instant vanilla pudding mix, and mix that with one cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk.  I think I may also try omitting one egg next time, as well.  Overall, an easy and fancy looking treat!

I get so many requests for these its crazy!  I add 1 tbs of sugar to the flour mix before stirring it into the boiling water and butter when I'm making these for dessert. I also always make my puffs a little smaller so they are a two bite treat.

Had leftover heavy cream so I decided to make this. Did not change a thing. The filling taste just like the store bought ones. I give that a 5 but for the pastry dough it's a 4 because it needed just a tad bit of oomph and it was a little eggy...so omit 1 egg and would like to add vanilla and sugar next time and see how it turns out. My daughter gobbled these up!

Being a novice cook, I read ALL reviews before I bake anything. I tried these yesterday as it was my wife's birthday and she loves cream puffs. These were extremely easy to make and were huge hit. I also made the chocolate sauce from this sight and drizzled it on and dusted with powdered sugar. My yield was 27 cream puffs and have ZERO left this morning. I didnt change anything, but did use a toothpick to put a small hole in the side to let the steam escape. My children want me to make them for al the upcoming Holidays. Thank you very much!!!

Mine didn't rise too much, but enough to fill. I also had no parchment paper so had to put them on slightly greased pans. The bottoms did burn, but I was convinced to still bring them to a family event. Sure enough, they were gone in an instant. Even with burnt bottoms! I was thrilled, but will definitely use parchment paper next time.

I've made this recipe several times with excellent results EVERY TIME!  I've never had a problem with the choux being too eggy or collapsing.  As long as the oven temp. is correct (using an oven thermometer) and the directions are followed, the average cook should have no problem making these.  I'm anxious to try different variations - such as a chocolate choux with a peanut butter cream.  MMMMMM! - experimenting will be fun!

This is a great recipe, directions and all!!!!!  I did everything as it was stated with the exception of only using 3 eggs and it turned out great.  After cooking the water, butter and flour/salt misture on the stove I put it in my kitchenaid stand mixer and while it was running added the eggs one at a time and it turned out great.  I did you one reveiwers advice to prop the door open after cooking for an hour and they didn't fall and looked sooooooo perfect.  I think the filling is very forgiving.  I didn't have any of the ingredients that it stating so I made up my own version and they are the best cream puffs I have ever tasted.  This recipe is the best and so easy.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

too much pudding flavor...  I think I might try a lighter filling next time, but the puffs themselves turned out pretty well.  I don't remember exactly what I did, but it seems like with pastries, the less handling, the better.  Also, I cooked one batch longer than the other, and they turned out crispier and poofier.

I tweaked the recipe for the filling, so it was more of an "Eclair" & topped it off with some melted chocolate. Delicious! I entered the recipe into a competition & won a weekly prize, it was great!!  The only thing i would keep in mind is that the dough is a bit bland, I might add some vanilla to it next time.

Wow! These were a BIG HIT at the New Years Eve Party!!!  I even had someone tell me that I should open a business and sell them.  I can't even tell you how big the rave reviews were.  I followed the directions exactly, except I put all the eggs into my kitchenAid, then poured the warm dough on top.  I immediately mixed it until it was well blended.  After baking I also turned off the oven, then opened it, poked a small hole in the puffs, and let them sit until they cooled.  Unbelieveably delicious!!!

I used to make them often before, and when I found this I had to make some. I also change the temp of the oven, baked for 10 min at 450F, then 20-25 min at 400F. Also I make holes with wooden sticks when they're done. I use different creams (from Cream Puffs I, on this site). When I make them small, I bake them for about 20 min at 400F.

Awesome! I added a tbs of vanilla extract to the batter, and cooled it in my kitchenaid mixing bowl for about 10 minutes. I fluffed it up a little by beating it for about 20 seconds on 2. I then added 2 eggs and about 1/3 cup of egg beaters. Dropped about 20 heaping tablespoons of the dough on a large ungreased cookie sheet and baked for 20 minutes. It sounded funny to "poke a hole" into the baked product but once you pull them out of the oven you'll understand- they are light and hollow. I poked the holes, then let the oven cool for about 20 minutes before popping them in for another 10 minutes to dry them out. For the filling, I used 1 box of chocolate pudding and one box of vanilla, prepared seperately with a cup of skim milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream each. I then filled up sandwich size ziplock bags and cut a small hole in the corner to pipe the pudding into the puffs. It will look like you have way too much but these things hold a lot of filling. Just tasted the first one- fabulous!

A better way to bake these is first at 400 until they puff up to full size.  Then lower oven temp to 350 to complete the baking.  This prevents collapsing when you take them out of oven that many are mentioning.  If you bake at only the high temp, the inside will not cook through causing them to collapse.

I have been making this recipe for years and it's always a great success!  I have found that humidity can really affect how "puffy" the puffs get.  I usually cut the puffs open and leave them on the open over door for 10-15 minutes.    These puffs can be used so many ways - for profiteroles, filled with creamed chicken and also for people with diabetes if I make it with sugarfree pudding.

I have been making these pastries since I was a teenager, in my late 50's now, I make the pastries small then slice them and make little sandwiches, out of ham salad, crab salad,shrimp salad,they are always a hit.  People are quite impressed with my culinary abilities.

These were so easy to make. And sooooo good. I got 52 cream puffs using the small cookie scoop from Pampered Chef. I also used parchment paper and they did not stick. Make sure to cook them for the 20-25 minutes and the middles will be hallow. I was told once that the way to test a cream puff to see if they are done is to tap them with the back of a spoon and they should sound hallow and it worked.

These turned out perfectly with no modifications needed.  They didn't stick, or deflate.  Very good and easy.

Tasted great! I cut a small hole at the top of the cream puffs and filled them with instant vanilla pudding. Added a sliced strawberry at the top and drizzled them with strawberry syrup. I also dusted them with powdered sugar. Yummm~ I shared it with my family and Youth Group :D  I added 3 eggs instead of 4 so I wouldn't get the "too eggy" flavor some people are getting. I also added sugar and vanilla extract to give it flavor like another person had reviewed.

Outstanding!  The pudding is what makes this recipe.  I followed the other reviews and poked a small hole in the pastry after taking it out of the oven.  I piped them with the pudding and topped them with a homemade Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce.  I could eat these everyday.

Years ago I made this recipe, always with *success* and raves.  Last night I was *reminded* of this recipe and decided to make another batch for my son's preschool holiday party today.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to use the parchment paper (what a great improvement from my past attempts), which gave me perfect puffs without sticking to the pan or the bottoms burning.  Also, I decided to poke a hole after baking to let the steam escape (great idea by the way).  In the past, my puffs were always a little soggy and deflated, but no more after this "poking a hole" trick.  You also have to return it to the oven for a few minutes after poking the holes to help it dry out a bit.  I was also a little worried when I added my first egg to the hot dough mixture.  The dough was very shining and started to come apart.  I thought "oh no!"  But I started vigorously stirring and it all came back together.  So the lesson here is to keep mixing until you get a ball.  My only complaint and not really a bad thing, is that the recipe makes too much filling.  I could eat the filling by itself... oh so good, but oh so bad for you!  I guess I'll make another batch of puffs to use up the leftover filling.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Anything this simple, yet tasty AND elegant requires five stars! I as well poked holes in them, AND left them in the oven with the oven door open after they were done so they could cool/dry. I'll make these over and over again! Don't forget to drizzle with chocolate and powdered suger for an even more fancy style.
Thanks for the recipe!**I forgot to mention..I was a little sceptical of the dough at first because it was runny and clumpy, but I figured that I would follow through with this recipe to the end. If this happens, fret not! Just whip it with a fork until smooth.. Don't give up too soon!

I baked these for a 4th of July potluck, and everyone gobbled them up. I baked them a day ahead, and I was worried they would deflate, but they were perfect the next day. Everyone loved them, they were gone by the end of the night. I had to make 3 batches before this worked. Like many others, I tried MommyFromSeattle's tips, but for unknown reasons, the dough did not come together. It was thin like cake batter. So I gave up and skipped the short cuts. I would highly recommend following the recipe. Although I did add a tblspoon of sugar to the batter, and I would have added vanilla, but it tasted fine without it. I baked the puffs at 425 for 10 minutes and then turned the heat down to 400 for another 10 mins., I think 375 would be good too, because the last batch came out darker. I also added cool whip to the pudding. I would say, each package of pudding is able to fill 20 puffs. I filled the puffs with lemon and vanilla flavors. A go to recipe!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!  I've gotten the best reviews from friends and family when using cheesecake and white chocolate-flavored puddings (instead of plain or french vanilla), and the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site is absolutely delicious when spread on top.  I also make these with lemon-flavored pudding and sprinkle them with powdered sugar.  For variety, I usually divide the ingredients for the filling in half and mix up two different bowls of filling, using two flavors of pudding.  Adding extra vanilla extract to both the cream puff dough and pudding mixture really helps to get rid of the "eggy" taste and mask the "boxed pudding" flavor so that the filling tastes like it was made from scratch.  Thanks so much, Shellie!

If you've ever been to the Wiconsin State Fair then you've probably had a cream puff.  The puff in this recipe is the same as they use at the fair (puffs are brushed using 1 egg yolk and 2 T milk and baked at 400 degrees for 35 minutes) but the filling is a bit different:  2 C whipping cream (whipped until soft peaks form), gradually adding 1/4 powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla until almost stiff.  Sprinkle puffs with powdered sugar.  (Taken from Taste of Home recipe referencing "The Wisconsin Bakers Association")

Yummy yummy! Easy to make and so tastey!  The filling was too rich for me, so next time I will not use as much pudding mix.  Be sure to use a flat pan, too.  Mine was warped and the puffs cooked unevenly.  Don't worry too much about the flat ones, once they are filled, they still look marvelous. I poked a hole in the side and piped the filling in, it worked great. Use vanilla in the batter too!

My family and friends loved these cream puffs (I literally shouted at my brother to stop eating them) - I'm a relatively new cook, and I managed to make lovely cream puffs - thus, this recipe is quite simple. I give this recipe five stars; however the rating is also based on ammendments I have made to the recipe. First of all, next time I make this, I will ensure that the filling is a bit thinner. I also added about one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the filling. Moreover, next time I may try using white chocolate or coconut pudding instead of vanilla. When the recipe calls to add salt and flour to water/butter mixture, I also added about one tablespoon of vanilla and two tablespoons of sugar. The pastry requires more than two tablespoons of sugar next time. Next, I cooled the recipe in the refrigerated. When the dough was warm (no longer hot), I added 3 eggs (reduced eggs from 4). I beat the dough with a mixture until sticky. I scooped one-tablespoon sized balls onto a wax-paper lined cookie sheet. I baked the pastry at 425 degrees for 13 minutes; then I reduced the temperature to 350 degrees, and baked for another 25 minutes or so (until toothpick comes out almost completely dry). Also, about 3 minutes before they are done baking, I poked each cream puff with several small holes (using toothpick). After removing them from the oven, I placed the cream puffs on cooling sheets. When they cooled, I filled them by making a small incision on the bottom, using a steak knife (the i

Fool your guests into thinking you're an expert pastry maker! Our friends couldn't believe I threw these rich, light, puffs together in less than an hour. I followed the directions exactly, using my Kitchen Aid mixer to ensure a smooth, satiny batter. Also, I made sure the puffs were well browned, though next time I will line the baking sheet with parchment paper so the puffs don't stick. Made as is, the filling is great. But for a lighter, fruity variation, I cut the pudding recipe in half. Then, before filling the puffs, I folded in half a tub of lite Cool Whip and a pint of sliced strawberries and dusted the puffs with powdered sugar just before serving.

These turned out so well for me.  I read many of the reviews but did not find that I needed to follow much of the advice by other reviewers and it worked fine as written.  You can add a bit of sugar to the pastry dough but go easy on this because the puff is not supposed to be sweet, the sweetness comes from the filling and topping if you make a glaze.  I did notice that the oven temp was a little high.  Luckily I was keeping an eye on them and turned the oven temp down to 400 about midway through the baking or they would have burned.  I did heaping tablespoon sized puffs and I think 20-22 min. at 400 would work best.  I also chose to use parchment paper instead of greasing the pan to keep them nice and evenly baked, instead of crisp on the bottom.  I filled some puffs with vanilla and some with choc filling by putting the pudding into ziploc bags and cutting of the tip to make a piping bag.  I think it's best to just poke a small hole in them and fill them up.  You can do this right in the top of the puff.  I melted 2 squares semisweet and 2 squares bittersweet chocolate on the stove with about 1 tsp shortening and drizzled this over them.   Beautiful and so tasty!

No success with the first batch.  I then added 1 tsp baking powder and baked at 450 for 10 minutes then 400 for another 15. The shells puffed and the cream puffs were delicious.

So easy!  I didn't bother cutting off the top or anything, I just let the puffs cool, then used the long filling tip with my pastry bag and filled it up!  Also, for the filling, I made White Chocolate instant pudding and mixed with Cool Whip.  They were better than gourmet and SOOO easy!  I will be making mini puffs for a chocolate fountain.

These cooked up huge light and fluffy but tasted way too eggy for my taste.  Next time I will just use egg whites.  I winded up not even filling them and just eating the cream.  What a waste.

WOW!!  These were absolutely fabulous and so, so easy to make.  The vanilla filling is delicious.  I also added a drizzle of chocolate ganache (cream and chocolate glaze) over the top of the filled puffs and they tasted better than any store bought eclair I've ever had.  YUM!

oooooooooo, so good!  I made these thinking they wouldn't be that tempting (so my fiance could have his treat, and I could still watch my weight!).  WRONG!  These were awesome.  I used one (5.1 ounce) package of vanilla pudding mixed with 1 c. whipping cream and 2 c. milk. I should have let the puffs cook just a bit longer as they "fell" once they cooled off.  I'll try again soon if I haven't already gained 2 lbs tonight!

WOW!  These puffs look and taste like they come from a bakery.  I had to convince a few people that I actualy made them.  I made a test batch of the "puff" itself before the holidays.  I filled the test puffs with ice cream and drizzled chocolate sauce over them.  What a terrific treat!  I'll keep this "ice cream puff" idea for my summer entertaining.  For the actual cream puffs, I used a pastry bag to fill them up.  I made a small slit in each puff using a small knife then just pushed the tip in there and filling was super easy.  I also topped the puffs with chocolate.  I used about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 3 tbsp of evaporated milk, melted this in the microwave then spread some on each puff.  YUMMY and super EASY!  It's a keeper!

My first batch, I made the mistake of letting the water/butter combination cool, and when it did, it separated and turned my dry mixture into slop. My second batch, I poured the mixture right after it boiled and the dough formed nicely. However, I still think there is too much water and it made the dough too runny, especially after the addition of the eggs. I also added a little bit of vanilla extract and sugar into the dough, which made it smell wonderful. My first baked batch was too flat... I didn't put enough mixture (again, it was a little too runny). My second batch was much better, because iw as very generous with the dough. I'm not quite sure whether it's because my oven is too hot or what, but the bottoms of the puff browned while the tops barely turned dark yellow. The custard was delicious and extremely sweet - and the best part. I will make this again, but with a few minor adjustments.

This is a great recipe. I have made Cream Puffs before with other recipes and the only things I thought I should add is that all the other recipes say to let the steam out of the middle of the Cream Puffs right when you take them out of the oven. I guess they might get soggy if you don't. And I have always used whipping cream instead of pudding. Otherwise great! Five stars for the way mine turned out.

Very easy to make, and very delicious. I added an 8 oz container of whipped topping to the custard, without the heavy cream. The one big problem I had with this recipe was that it took forever for the center to bake and become dry, so that the cream puffs became sort of brown. It still tasted fine though. The first time I made big cream puffs, but the second time I made about 60 small ones which were very pretty and delicious. I got many great compliments from family and friends :) Thank you for the recipe!

Incredibly easy and they turned out perfect! I'd never made cream puffs before, but it is pretty hard to screw this one up. I didn't use their version of pastry cream, instead I used a very highly rated recipe for pastry cream on all recipes since I had all of the ingredients on hand. Turned out amazing!

I loved this easy recipe.  I just made these for the 1st time and they turned out great!  I used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and it was delicious!  I found that I really needed to cook them the full 25 minutes.  The first batch I only baked for 20 minutes and the centers were a little more doughy.  They still turned out great, though.  I drizzled some melted chocolate and dusted them with powdered sugar.  They looked so pretty for Christmas!

THis recipe is so easy and SO elegant looking! I used chocolate pudding mix and used 2 cups milk and one cup cream (to reduce the fat). It turned out great! I made these for my friends and they all thought that i bought them!  To make it look a little fancier i melted a 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp. shortning in a double boiler and drizzled it over them. YUM!!!

I have made cream puffs for years, but this was the first time I've ever heard of using a mixer to beat in the eggs.  I couldn't believe how much higher and lighter my cream puffs turned out!  Not only that, I got almost twice the number of cream puffs I usually get.   Others have recommened self-rising flour, but it isn't necessary.  You are probably not beating the eggs in well enough to incorporate the air necessary for the dough to puff properly.  The filling is so much easier and quicker than my own custard and whipped cream version.  This one's a real keeper.

These cream puffs are very good.  I am also impressed with the easy and delicious filling.  This recipe is at it's best with chocolate on top, but one that isn't too sweet, because the filling already is.  Use Kevin Ryan's "Chocolate Cream Frosting" for amazing chocolate eclairs.

I followed the recipe and thought it turned out wonderful.  I did whip part of the whipping cream and folded it in with the pudding mixture before chilling.  Smaller puffs are better.  Great recipe!

This was the easiest recipe!  It was sooo good.  I'll admit that I was a little worried by previous reviews about the dough being too egg-y, but went with it anyway.  The dough did smell very egg-y while cooking, but tastes great.  I also whipped the cream first, then mixed the pudding and milk together and folded into whipped cream.  Delicious!

My puffs didn't puff!!!  I've made cream puffs before, so I'm not really sure what the problem is.  Could be because I used egg substitute.  Well I made two pans worth that are going in the trash.  I will try again using real eggs.

YUCK!!I could also smell & taste the eggs.  I might try again with less eggs or I may just try another recipe.  I was surprised at how easy they were  to fill.  Overall not that great--my 5 year old didn't even care for them.

I cannot understand what some readers here had trouble with.  The lady who 'fried' her puffs simply forgot to put in the eggs.  Those who felt  one needs to be an experienced cook to follow this recipe probably can't read nor successfully boil water.  Come on, 2 tsp of vanilla and share to boot?   Seriously?  
I made this one without ANY adjustments and they came out like they should.  Perfect.

The trick is to cook the dough till it forms a ball that doesn't separate. I stir constantly. Don't give up.  Remove from heat, stir in eggs one at a time, blend well each time. I use same pan, I don't bother putting in a bowl. Made this way many times, yummy! It is time consuming but end result well worth it! Fouffie

I always thought cream puffs were difficult to make but seriously was soo easy! It's just getting the consultancy if the batter right and having a steady hand when piping the batter on the tray (otherwise they bake odd shapes)

Made them twice now, and both times they turned out great. I baked for 15 min at 400, then turned it down to 350 for another 15 min to let them dry out.

Excellent.  Made a double batch of puffs, using the same amount as above for the filling but added 1/2 container Cool Whip.  I only had 1 box of vanilla instant pudding so added 1 box of instant Cheesecake pudding mix as well. Just enough cheesecake flavor still retaining the lovely creamy textures and flavors.
When I took the puffs out of the oven, I poked a small hole with a wooden skewer to let the steam escape and returned them to the oven, with the door open so they would dry out a little more.

I said I'd update this. I added about 3 times more flour than the recipe called for. I used all-purpose flour. I even went so far as to check to make sure I had used a one-cup measure. It had flour in it, so I know I did. This time, they rose a little more, but were misshapen. The tops never browned but the bottoms did. Last time, both the tops and bottoms browned. They were hard and dense. I cut one open and it was gooey inside. I have made eclairs before and they turned out great. Extremely frustrated because I followed the recipe exactly.

Take my advice and read some of the helpful reviews, otherwise you'll end up with deflated balls of dough, reduce the oven temp first to 400 then reduce it after 15 minutes to 350, prick little holes in the top to allow steam to escape so they don't deflate. I only used the shell recipe since I can't have pudding but over all I think you should omit 1 egg and add a teaspoon of vanilla so it's not so eggy.

I've tried this recipe many many times and the everything turned out wonderful. I saw comments show that the puff did not rise up. I've tested and putting 1/8 tsp baking powder is the best solution for that. I also think that we should reduce eggs by adding only 3 eggs. Thanks :D

My puffs turned out good but my filling never set. I follow the directions and video exactly. Very disappointing.

These are very easy and good. I didnt use the cream, just the puff and used another cream on this site called "pastry cream". The puffs, however, are delicious! i added a tbsp of sugar to them, replaced butter with oil(i was out of butter), and poked a few small holes around the 18 min mark. Sadly, i overbaked them and they burned slightly on the bottom. Next time, ill reduce the temp to 400 degrees. Overall though, these are delicious and definitely a keeper. Thanks Shellie!

I like this recipe very much, have tried it many times. It's fairly easy to follow, and does not require much brain work. It turned out great every time I tried it. For those who have a problem with the puffs "rising", I once made a mistake and used oil on baking sheets. The puffs ended up frying to the paper, very soggy and didn't bake through. Also the key to getting them right is not to open the oven until they are ready. The air tends to escape and they fall. Otherwise I cannot imagine any problems.

This recipe is the same as my mom's, and I have had it for years.  I used to make them all the time, and then suddenly had difficulty with the puffs flopping after they are taken out of the oven.  After reading many reviews, and checking with my niece's mema since my mom long ago passed away, I lowered the oven temp and cooked them at a steady 400 for 30 minutes, (mema said 45 minutes, but I thought that was WAY too long) and then poked them with a toothpick to let the steam escape.  They cooled on a rack, and then I left them overnight to be filled prior to serving.  Thankfully, and finally, my puffs stayed puffed.  Made the filling the morning before serving so it was sufficiently chilled.  Everyone loved them, and now I feel much more confident to make them more often without flopping! Glad that I can use this old time family favorite again! Thanks for all the helpful reviews!

These tasted terrific, but I wish I would had read the reviews first to know to poke them with a fork when they come out and pop them back in with the door open for 10-15 mins so they weren't soggy and flat. : (

Great recipe Shelley thanks! 
For those of you that have trouble go to www.joyofbaking.com/cream puffs and watch the video that Stephanie jaworski does.  She makes the instruction/directions absolutely fool-proof.  I have found her baking times better, (sorry Shelley) Not once have my cream puffs failed. I've even cut the eggs back to using only 2 and they still puff up wonderfully. And as always, I line my sheets/pans with parchment paper.

This recipe is perfect as is.  What you fill it with is up to you, but the puff recipe itself is perfect.  I have no idea what others who made changes to the puff had in mind, but they are not true Choux pastry.  I have made them a dozen times now with no problems.  The instructions are perfect as it is a simple recipe.

If I could give it more stars, I would.  Made these last night.  They came puufy out of oven.  Did follow advise of others and let cool in oven.  They were perfect!  Halved the cream mixture and put almond extract in one and lemon extract in the other.  We injected the mixture inside, melted chocolate and drizzled on top.  They are EXCELLENT!  Thank you, Shellie.  I will make these over and over again.

This would be five star if instructions were better and a few ingredients added. For puffs, add a Tablespoon or two of sugar and 1 to 2 teaspoon vanilla extract to batter. When puffs are done baking, poke a small hole in the side of the puff (to allow steam to escape preventing the puff from collapsing and becoming mushy) and place back in oven (heat turned off) for another 15 minutes. For the filling, if you use vanilla pudding, it is heavenly to add a teaspoon of almond extract for a truly gourmet taste! Make sure puffs are completely cool before filling.

First batch, not so pretty. Not really sure what went wrong there,lol. But the following batched baked up hollow and golden, as expected. I only gave it 4 stars because I just wasn't impressed with the flavor, or lack there of I should say. Perhaps since I'm not really a pastry person my expectations were off. But my friend I was baking them with seemed quite happy with them. Biggest complaint is that you can only bake on one rack at a time because otherwise they don't puff up. So you are turning the oven to 425 for 10 minutes, then down to 350 for 20-25, then off for 10. Repeat!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I poked the puffs with a toothpick 5 minutes before they were done and they turned out perfect. I did add my own twist and made the filling with pistachio pudding mix, delicious!

Made these today in an attempt to satisfy a craving. The recipe for the shells is great, though I dropped the batter by teaspoonful instead of tablespoonful onto the baking sheet. When the puffs seemed done, I opened the oven a crack and turned it off, then let the puffs sit there for another five minutes so they wouldn't "deflate" from the sudden temp change. They came out perfect after baking for 22 minutes and then cracking the oven as I said. The reason I only give 3 stars is because the filling was not what I had expected or anything like what I've experienced when eating a creme puff in the past...it was more like a thick pudding/custard than the typical thick whipped-like filling I am used to. Maybe it is just me? DH was surprised at the filling as well, he normally loves creme puffs and he's had a great many more than I have. It didn't taste bad, just "different". I will definitely use the recipe for the shells again though. :)

I've been making these for over 15 years now, in the beginning it was tricky to get them to bake and (puff).
What I realized was if the oven isn't pre-heated to 450 degrees all the way before you put them in, they will deflate ! I bake them at 450 for the first 10-12 mins., then lower the oven temp to 325 and finish baking for another 10-15 mins. I watch the tops through the oven door, and just when they puff and turn slightly brown, I lower the temp and continue baking until done. I also noticed that if I use bottled or filtered water, they come out better. I also whisk my eggs together before adding them to the pot, I found that this was easier than adding one at a time. I do it by hand with a whisk all on the stove and I also add a dash of vanilla extract into the water and butter mixture.  You need to use alot of elbow greese while mixing the eggs into the dough mixture, keep turning vigorously until all the egg is absorbed and the dough is very sticky and sticking to the sides of the pot. I make double batches of these each time I make them. When they come out of the oven, I slide them right off into a big aluminum tin to cool.  I cut about a 1 1/2 inch slit on the sides with a small pearing knife and then fill them with a demitass coffee spoon ! I found this worked the best for me ! Hope it helps you.

I add a touch of vanilla to the flour mix.
Also, for the cream filling I use 3cups of whipping cream, 1.5 cups milk and 2 pks vanilla pudding - I wanted it to have more of a whipping cream texture than a pudding texture. Sooooo good. I drizzle chocolate on top :)

The bottoms burned, the middles weren't cooked, they didn't puff up at all. I had the oven set to 425, preheated, didn't change the original quantity, and followed all directions.

Ive made Cream Puffs many times with my old recipe but like trying something new.....The filling was absolutely delicious and is definately a keeper but the Cream Puff shells were a disappoitment..As one of the previous reviewer stated, they didn't raise well at all--not much higher than an English Muiffin.....I must confess, the use of an electric mixer to incorporate the eggs was the big draw to this recipe but think maybe it was my downfall...Maybe should have stuck with the old wooden spoon method that results with higher Cream Puffs and a very tired arm......

I've been making these puffs for over 40 years (Fannie Farmer cookbook). For those of you whose puffs fell, you either took them out of the oven too soon (cook until there are no beads of moisture on the puffs) or if you use margerine instead of butter, the puffs will be flatter. I fill them with a mixture of fat-free, sugar-free vanilla pudding mix, milk and Cool Whip. Mix three small packages of the pudding with 4 1/2 cups of milk. Stir with whisk for two minutes. Then add two cups of Cool Whip. After filling the puffs, I melt semi-sweet chocolate bits with a little water in the microwave until it is thin enough to pour over the puffs. Then refrigerate. So easy and everyone is always impressed.

These are GREAT- My friends did not believe I made them.  I made them exact as stated in the recipe.  I did pierce the puffs about 18 minutes into baking as suggested by others.  I also melted some semi sweet chips and glazed the tops.  EXCELLENT!  I will make often.

I Have been Making these when i was 16 years old and it is the most inexpensive and elegant recipe i use frequently. one trick i have used over the years was after beating the eggs in and the batter is finished i refrigerate the dough in a sealed ziplock for atleast 3 hours, most of the time i prep this the night before. This way the dough isnt tooo sticky and easier to shape. sometimes when your
environment that you are baking in is hot, the batter tends to melt in a way. i also use a custard filling mix instead of the instant vanilla, much more creamier and better tasting :)

I really liked this recipe, but I do agree with other reviewers; it did leave out some important details. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 TBS of sugar to the pastry dough. I also only used 3 eggs. The filling turned out wonderfully rich, but there's a lot of it. I think I may have been fine with just 1 package of pudding, 1 cup of heavy cream, and 1/2 cup of milk.

This recipe is the bomb!  I tried this with my best 
friend and her family and mine loved it!  Instead of using the instant pudding and milk and heavy cream, I went to the restaurant supply store and got some Bavarian cream and put that in as the cream.  The cream puffs I made where best served cold.  Yum!!!!

They taste ok, but just tasted like eggs.  They look awful. They rose and then fell once taken off the sheet. They stuck to the pan terribly and I use an air bake pan which usually doesn’t allow anything to stick. They were overdone on the outside and not done enough on the inside. I’m not a beginner cook. I do well with french foods and lots of finicky thing. But, I was very disappointed in this recipe.

I'm a little confused when it comes to the pudding/filling part. I made the filling with the original recipe and then left it in the fridge. I checked on it later on and it will still really watery.  I can't seem to figure out why. I even tried to heat it up but it ended up burning. Am i suppose to make the pudding following the instructions on the box and then mix it with the milk and heavy cream? Please help me! Thanks

Very, very good. I may have used a little less milk and added sugar to the puff.

I made mini puffs.  I used my small pampered chef scoop and they turned out wonderful and uniform in size.  I cooked them in my convection over for 12 minutes, then I shut the oven off and left them in for another 15 minutes, checking to make sure they were not burning.  I let them cool for about 5 minutes then cut them in half with a serrated knife to finish cooling.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Please don't let the melted butter/water get room temp  before adding flour. It evidently needs the heat to stick together or will not make a ball.  However, when made according to directions they're "better than bakery"

This was very good - I added a vanilla bean into the mix to give it a punch. To finish it off I covered it in icing sugar and then drizzeled chocolate and a raspberry reduction over it. It looked good and tasted great.

These were delicious and so impressive!  I made as is, except I used parchment paper, added vanilla to the batter and used the toothpick trick.

Yum!  These were so pretty and easy.  I was expecting it to be a difficult dessert before reading through the directions but it was super easy.  So yummy, too!  (I didn't have a full 2 cups of heavy cream so I mixed 1/3 c melted butter, 1 TB flour and 1 cup 1% milk to make the additional heavy cream.)  Other than my heavy cream partial substitute, I didn't change a thing.  Didn't even take any reviewers advice just followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. Made the filling in the morning and the cream puffs about 30 minutes before company was set to come.   Perfectly easy, beautiful presentation and tasty dessert.

We usually receive cream puffs at our local Pho restaurant and eat those up like there's no tomorrow. So I was excited to see this on the main page today and had to make it. I always read the reviews to get tips on making anything and followed the advice from MommyfromSeattle (& to support a local cook). I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead, added a splash of vanilla, and scrambled the 4 eggs. Poured all the eggs at once into my KA mixer. I placed the dough on a Silpat liner and took it out at 20 mins. I poked holes in each and out of 24 puffs, only 1 fell flat. Placed them on a cooling rack. That took about 15 mins. to cool. Filled it with a pastry bag but ran out due to the fact I over filled them. My family + mom + nephew loved them and said it was even better & bigger than the Pho place. They were so easy to make. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I added vanilla & a tbsp of sugar to the puff batter as someone else suggested and baked them in mini muffin tins. I also made sure the batter was elastic in texture. Poking them with a toothpick after 20 minutes in the oven prevented collapse. These turned out excellent! The texture of the puffs is perfect.

I am a new baker and am not very good ( I will honestly admit that :)) But this recipe was so easy, with the help of the other reviews!!!! I used butterscotch sugar-free pudding instead and it was fantastic. Also, after putting flour mix in mixing bowl, stuck in freezer for about 2 min, then added all four eggs at once. The puffs were a little eggy, but well balanced with filling sweetness. Also, I did not have enough regular butter, so I used half butter and half margarine. So excited that they turned out!!!

I could never make cream puffs to look like the photo - these came out delicious and looked as though i bought them at a bakery!!  I did not poke a hole in the side - i just removed them from the oven and let them cool...then I used a dessert decorator with a small hole for the pudding and pumped it in....finally - I did it!!!!They are delicious and look great!!!  Thanks!!!

This is the best recipe EVER! I made this for my family and they went cuckoo! One thing i like to add that really puts it over the top is i find a thick chocolate sauce or just plain melted chocolate chips, split the inside of the puff, puff in some cream on one side and on the other the pre-maid chocolate. I also put some cream and chocolate on top, then usually, i put a sliced in half strawberry. OMG ITS GOOD!

I have made cream puffs many times but couldn't find my old standby recipe so I used this one. These turned out extremely eggy tasting even though I cut out one egg, and they didn't puff up and become hollow! I got 24 puffs that I had to scrape the centers out of, and after all that work they tasted disgusting! Won't be making this one again.

OMG!!!  You can't eat just one!!!  Sooo awesome!!!  Thank you for sharing Shellie!!!  We did add 1 tsp. of vanilla to the pudding mix.  We also drizzled just a little bit of chocolate syrup on the tops of the puffs, and dusted with powered sugar.  We are laughing at each other, because we can't stop eatting them!!!  YUM-O!!!

AWESOME!! These were a big hit at the potluck I made them for. I used cook & serve pudding, all I had in the cabinet, instead of instant. After trying both ways, I prefer the cook & serve, it's creamier and I like the consistency better. But this is a great recipe and very easy to follow. Turned out perfect my first try. And it's very easy if you use a cookie press with a funnel tip to fill them. I made these twice the size that the recipe calls for, so I held the cookie press tip in each for at least 5 seconds to get the right amount of filling in them. Wonderful!

This recipe has the perfect balance and tastes what a cream puff should taste like.  On half of the puffs, I put chocolate frosting.  It's a nice addition.  I poked the puffs in the side after taking them out of the oven and placing them on a cooling rack.  They didn't collapse.  I will say that 1 cup of flour is right on, don't be tempted to be lazy when measuring out the flour.  If you don't have enough flour, the consistency will be to runny and the puffs will spread more than puff up.

I tried these for a New Year's Eve party, and followed  MommyFromSeattle's additional tips and they came out perfect! The parchment paper seemed key. I have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer and the eggs did not cook when mixed in to the hot batter right away. Thanks for the tips, I will be making them again :o)

The key to puffs that don't collapse (which they did the first time I made this recipe) is to bake at 410 degrees for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 250 and bake for another 10.  I took an Italian cooking class and the recipe was exactly the same except for the cooking time and temp.  I have real puffs this time!

The shell turned out wonderful... 5 Stars.. Very easy to make and held up well. Just make sure you poke a hole on the side after baking to release steam. The filling was just ok. Nice consistency, but I didnt like the processed pudding taste. Good if you are in a rush, but think i will try to make a filling from scratch next time or maybe reduce the amount of pudding and add vanilla extract.

Recipe is like my mom's used to be. I just saw a program on tv where Lucinda made these and she froze them before baking. Has anyone else ever done this? I didn't get to write down the recipe. I filled mine with my homemade lemon curd, very good!

I read many reviews to be sure I did everything right. I took the advice of many and cut back on the eggs and added slightly more sugar but still they were just meh. I ended up throwing out most of the batch because nobody in the family had any desire to eat them.

Recipe was easy to follow and they came out beautifully but.... they immediately fell completely flat! I had an old recipe I used for many many years (that I've misplaced) and I never once had a single puff fall. I'm really disappointed. I will try to find my old one for the next batch.

After reading instructions from other reviewers this turned out pretty good!! Filling does taste a little chemically though.  My guests loved them and they were easy to make.

Ok, in a nutshell this was a wonderfully simple and exceptionally tasty treat!  I added one tablespoon sugar and one teaspoon vanilla, next time I will add two teaspoons vanilla rather than one.  I baked them on parchment paper at 425 for 20 minutes then turned the oven off and let them sit for about 20 more minutes.  I used French vanilla pudding for the filling.  I printed a shopping list, on the list the cream came out as light cream while the recipe calls for heavy cream.  These turned out so much better than any I have ever had anywhere else.

These taste fantastic, but do not puff up well in the oven in three attempts I have made at cream puff so far. I like a smaller puff, so this may be the reason. When I made larger puffs, they got nice and round and HUGE.

I used this recipe just for the puff part.  So many recipes have the exact same ingredients, but only make like 12 puffs, so I searched for one that made around 20, as serving at a graduation party, and didnt want these MASSIVE puffs.  They were perfect!  Will keep this recipe for the puffs (I used the Hersheys recipe from their website for the filling, homemade, YUM!)

I love these as an elegant  dessert :P Recipe is easy and it only needs ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.   Instead of a pudding filling, however, I prefer to "stuff" my puffs with vanilla ice cream and drizzle chocolate sauce over them - HEAVENLY!

Make this recipe every Easter and Christmas. Try using Instant French Vanilla pudding, it gives it more of a custard taste!

Wow.  These were so easy and delicious.  I had lots of leftover filling that I had put in a makeshift pastry bag using a ziptop bag with a corner snipped off that I kept in the fridge.  My husband would sneak into the kitchen several times a day and give himself a little squirt of it until it was all gone!!  You will love this.

These are my specialty and what I use when I want to make an impression.  I make the puffs exactly as written except I bake for about 30 minutes (if not, they sometimes collapse on cooling).  I make them large so that my yield is only about 9 puffs.   For the filling I beat 1 small package instant vanilla pudding with 1 cup milk until thickened and set aside.  Beat 1 cup heavy cream until slightly thickened and sprinkle in 1/4 cup powdered sugar.  Continue beating until soft peaks form then fold into pudding mixture. The filling is what makes these cream puffs so delicious.

This was my first time attempting cream puffs it was much easier than I thought! I followed the advice of the other posters and added some vanilla and a pinch of sugar to the puff batter. I baked them at 425 for 15 minutes, then 375 for 10, then poked holes in them when they were done. Also topped them with chocolate ganache - yum! I got 23 good sized cream puffs. Will definitely make them again and will make them smaller. I made them for my daughter's teacher appreciation day and she is asking if she really has to bring them in.. Thanks for a great recipe!!

These cream puffs were supberb!!!!!!!! I made 1/2 with the vanilla pudding and the other half I made with chocolate pudding. I have had many cream puffs most just filled with pudding but the cream really made these cream puffs over the top. Of course if you are counting calories you should skip these. As others have written you need to pierce these after baking and let dry out. I did not change a thing to the recipe and they came out perfect. Thanks this one is a keeper!!!!

These came out perfectly.  I used my mom's recipe that uses the same ingredients, just slightly different directions so I thought I'd share them.  I followed the recipe until step 3, then I placed rounded tablespoons of the dough on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.  Bake the shells at 425 for 20 minutes then at 325 for 20 more minutes.    No need to poke the sides of the shell or vent the oven, these came out perfectly and did not collapse as I feared.  I whipped heavy whipping cream with pistachio pudding mix for the filling for half the batch, and used the filling from the recipe for Chocolate-filled Cream Puffs (this site) for the other half and they came out beautifully!

OMG!!!  These are freakin' fantastic!  The recipe is just your basic puff recipe, and the only things I did to vary the recipe was to add 1 tsp. vanilla to puffs and I added all the eggs at once and just beat the mixture with my mixer.  I put parchment paper on my cookie sheets with no problems.  The filling I used light cream (too cheap to spring for heavy cream) and 2% milk.  I was hesitant about the filling because I didn't just want to throw vanilla pudding in there, but the filling makes the puffs.  I made 1.5 batches of puffs and 2 batches of filling.  I'm glad I have some semblance of self control otherwise a dozen would be gone already.  I got 36 puffs from a single recipe.  Next time I think I'll pipe the dough onto the sheet for more consistent shapes and sizes.  Will make again and again and again....

These were absolutely fabulous. I read the reviews and decided to add the vanilla to both the shells and the filling and I'm glad that I did. I made the first batch too large and did not cook them long enough, so they were soggy. I made the second batch smaller, that made all the difference, they were perfect. I added a chocolate fudge sauce to the top....soooo good!!

Makes really great puffy shell, would not deflate even if i want it to. I have a problem with making sure the inside is dry and keeping the outside nicely brown without being overly dark so i turn down the heat halfway. perfect!

I made the puffs, using the tricks that everyone mentions, poking the holes, letting them sit in the oven to dry out and then I did something totally different with them, I was attending a party that evening and needed to bring appetizers, I made dozens of these little puffs, after they were cooled I sliced off a small part on the top of each and filled some with almond chicken salad, and some with a feta spinach mixture, and some with shrimp salad and they were a huge huge hit.......Next time I will try the dessert version....

Delicious! I've made these what seems like a hundred times and they always disappear the same day. I make my own chocolate icing and drizzle it over the top.  Its a great addition but is not necessarily.

Very easy and delicious. The cream filling is great. I had no problems with any of these collapsing and I didn't poke holes in them or anything. The only problem I was having was filling them but that's because I was using a mechanical pastry bag that I hate. Ended up slicing them in half and filing them that way. The first time I made these I smoothed the dough out with a wet finger after shaping them but they actually baked up prettier when I left them as they were. So don't go crazy shaping the tablespoons of dough out.

Saw a similar dough recipe in 4/09 Bon Appetit used for appetizers!!  Skip the pudding, start at step 2, go through beating the eggs in.  Then add 1 C Gruyere and 1/4 tsp pepper!  Yikes, to dies for appetizers.  Follow the other hints about leaving the oven door open to cool and prevent sagging.

very good recipe.  however, you should let the cooked dough spin in the mixer on low speed to cool before you add the eggs, or it will be too hot and the eggs will begin to cook.

I do a little twist on this recipe.  I make the cream puff dough, then draw a 1 inch circle in the middle of the parchment paper, and place the dough around that circle, making sure the FULL diameter of my circle is no larger than 8" (it will form a wreath appearance.) You have to pile it rather high.  Once it is done (40-45min at 400), I turn off the oven and leave it in there for 10 minutes.  I fill it will vanilla pudding (instant) and coolwhip.  To the lady that found that her dough was too eggy.....after you ad the eggs, you must beat and beat and beat with a wooden sppon.  Sometimes it takes 5-7 minutes.  The shine will go away and form a dough ball.  Also, I once made the mistake of using JUMBO eggs.  If I use large, I use 1 less than the recipe calls for.  Hope this helps.  Don't give up.

Easy and tasty!  I followed recipe (calculated to 30 yield) and the cream puffs turned out perfect.  I used silicone sheets in lieu of parchment paper; i added vanilla to the batter, and I also poured eggs in slowly.  I will use this recipe for future family gatherings.

Very good recipe! Just got through making this. I took some of the advice of mommyfromseattle and added vanilla to the puff dough, off heat or it will evaporate, and right after baking poked the holes with the toothpicks. I did not however add all the eggs to the hot mixture. I am not a pro like mommy but I do have 35 years of home cooking experience and that was just too much of a chance for me. I used my mixer and cooled the dough some first and then added the eggs one at a time mixing well after each. There is usually a reason behind an instruction like that I have found. While it may not make a difference that we can see it may very well have to do with how the finished product turns out. 
I used french vanilla instant pudding and made it by the package directions and then piped it in using whatever small crevices were created in the baking of the puffs. They really were to die for.

These puffs were simply delicious!
I made them for a party and they
were a huge hit!
For the filling, I used one 5.4 oz pudding mix
and one tub of light cool whip instead.
They came out great and tasted perfect!

I am rating this on the actual puffs.  They were great and had no issues with them.  I made them with homemade whipped cream for the cream puffs and I also shaped some for eclairs and filled them with homemade pastry cream and coated with chocolate.  These were so easy and awesome!!!

Totally easy to make and really tasty!  I piped them through a star tip for a more elegant look and filled them with strawberry ice cream instead of the cream filling.  Yum.

Have made these many times.  They are also good if filled with whipped cream instead of the vanilla pudding.  Just use heavy whipping cream, beat until it stands up in peaks, then add a little sugar to taste.

Really???? It's this easy????!!!!! I will never again buy store bought ones! These turned out fabulous!!! I added 1 tsp vailla flavoring to the batter and that is the only change I made. Everyone raved about how good these were! I didn't have any problems with not cooking all the way through and I let one pan cool in the oven with the door ajar and one pan cool on the stovetop and I poked holes in the sides of the pastries to allow the heat to escape. The ones on the oventop sank, the others did not but I was still able to work with the ones that sank. I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. I garnished with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar and rasberries! YUMMY!!!

How can something elegant be so easy to prepare? I followed all of MommyFromSeattle's suggestions, and I had no problems. Instead of spooning the batter onto the pan, I used a pastry bag and a large, star shaped cake decorating tip.  I added 2tsp. of almond extract to the filling, which I piped into the shells with a plastic zipper bag and a cake decorating tip. Definitely line your pan with parchment paper. I had fun; I was able to live out my fantasy as a pastry chef. =)

The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that the filling tasted good.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the puffs because the dough never thickened.  I measured the ingredients out and double checked everything before mixing, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  This was so soupy that it was impossible to "drop by tablespoons".  I gave up, tossed the whole batch out, and we ate the filling as if it were extra thick/rich pudding.

This is such an unbelievably SUPER EASY recipe to follow! I added some vanilla extract like the other members suggested and for filling, I mixed some matcha with the other ingredients to make it a Green Tea flavored cream puff! I also used a melon scooper to keep the portion consistent and baked them on a mini muffin pan (which helped to keep the size small---you have to remember to turn the cream puffs over once the tops are a little golden brown to cook/rise evenly and keep a round shape). My boyfriend was raving about it to his friends! Awesome recipe, thanks so much for sharing!!!

My family really liked this recipe. The texture of the cream puff was great. When I took mine out of the oven to poke them with a toothpick, like the reviews suggested, they deflated. I quickly put them back in the oven and they puffed right back up. I also was left with way too much cream eventhough the puffs were filled to the brim. I really like this recipe but I don't think it was worth the work.

These cream puffs were decadent!  I liked them best when the shell was warm and the filling was cold! Filled them with my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator!  They couldn't have been easier!  Drizzled with chocolate, and they were beautiful!

i've always wondered how to make cream puffs, and never realised they were so simple to make! these were fun to make, and tasted awesome. i prepared the pudding normally (just whipping with milk) and it tasted great already!
i added vanilla to the eggs and the puffs did not have an eggy smell at all.
i piped in pudding till each puff was full and when you bite into it the filling just bursts out and fills your mouth! i make them small (half a heaping tsp of dough for each) so that the whole puff fits in one bite, that way it's less messy to eat.
these are best eaten cold! they're YUMMY! thanks for the recipe!

I had all kinds of trouble. Success came when I made these changes. I did NOT poke a hole in them. I baked them for 30 min. at 400 until they were a nice light brown color. Then they were just fabulous!

I made the following changes:  I let the dough cool a bit before adding the eggs, and I kept the mixer going constantly as I put them in; I lined the baking sheets with parchment paper; and I baked at 425 for 10 minutes, then lowered the temp to 350 and baked for another 10 (this was in Alton Brown's recipe).  I pierced them as soon as they came out of the oven.  For the filling, I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  They came out perfect, and didn't stick to the parchment.  I'm a decent baker but far from a pastry chef, and I'd never attempted anything like this before.  Very easy and very yummy - will definitely make again!

These were delicious! However, I had problems with the bottoms of my puffs burning, even though I only baked for 20 minutes. I put my puffs in the center of the oven, and lined the pan with foil. I dont know if any of those things could have caused them to burn. Does anyone know how to prevent this?

These are wonderful, if I could give it more stars I would!  I used sugar free pudding and they turned out great. Thanks!

Made a double batch of the dough (40 puffs) and 1 batch of filling. I was surprised at how easy this was. Everyone raved about this and was even asked if I'm taking Culinary classes at school. Used a cookie scoop to make them all the same size. The only thing I had a problem with was the baking time, but I'll try it with another oven and see how it goes. I'm looking forward to trying these out with other pudding flavors. *EDIT* Made this again for 4th of July for another crowd. Did a batch of chocolate and a batch of vanilla. The chocolate was devoured! I made it in a different oven and the cooking time was perfect at 22 - 23 minutes. I don't seem to have any problems with deflation or having the puffs turn out flat. The filling is great but I'm trying to hunt down something that doesn't taste like pudding. This is now one of my 4yo's favorite recipe to make.

I just make the puffs and use instant pudding to fill them. They are incredibly easy, yet everyone thinks you're a 4 star chef for doing them. Please join me in NOT revealing the secret of just how easy these are to make!

These were awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly and then poked a hole with a toothpick as soon as I transferred them to the cooling rack.  They lasted several days in the fridge (only because I had extreme willpower not to eat them in one day).

This recipe was fantastic! I actually did half vanilla and then half chocolate and they were all good. The only thing I would have done different is cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us and I had no idea how big these things would turn out to be. I can't wait for the next chance I will have to make these again!

I used the filling recipe and the 'Puffs' recipe from this site (which is really this recipe halved). Came out very nice---I had never made cream puffs before but they are really easy to attempt! My mom used to make them, and she wrote me in a letter to 'find a good cream puff recipe, but don't open the oven before they are done'. Well, I found a good cream puff recipe, thanks Mom for the advice, and I didn't open the oven until the timer went off!

I just made these for the first time (following the helpful tips of the mom from seattle) and they came out well...that is the ones on the top rack.  The ones on the bottom rack came out slightly burnt on the bottom.  I'll change that one thing next time (only using the top rack), otherwise they were great!  Thanks for the new recipe!

I just made these and they came out perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly for the shells.  I baked them exactly 20 minutes and rotated my pan halfway through.  I filled mine with vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate filling and powdered the tops with sugar.  For the vanilla and chocolate fillings...I just made instant pudding from the box and folded in some Cool Whip to lighten it up.  For the strawberry, I used the vanilla/Cool Whip base and added about 1.5 tsp. of strawberry flavoring and red food coloring.  Love it and these really impress! =)

Awesome!  My mom used to make these on special occasions when we were kids...so I thought I'd give them a shot for my hubby for Valentines Day!  They turned out great!  I took some others advice (gotta love reviews!) and added 1 tsp vanilla and sugar to dough, I baked them at 450 for 10 min and then 375 for 10 min and I pricked them as soon as they came out of the oven.  They look and taste great!  Thanks everyone for making this a success!
PS I used my silicone baking mats and they didn't even THINK about sticking!

I saw this recipe and had to make it. I love cream puffs but never thought i could make them but this recipe seemed so easy. I followed advice from mommyfromseattle and put in all 4 eggs at the same time. Also baked for 20 minutes and poked a hole in each one. I also added half a tsp. of sugar in the dough and it came out perfect. I will definitely make these again and again!! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were fantastic tasting. I also added the extra vanilla and sugar. But I wish the instructions to POKE A HOLE in each cream puff in the last two minutes of cooking BEFORE taking them out of the oven would have been listed as part of the recipe instructions. For people new to pastry making, this is not a given.

Also, IMPORTANT: the recipe says to coat the cooking sheet with oil, but COAT IT WITH BUTTER. I used oil the first two times and the bottoms stuck to the pan each time, tearing as I tried to get them off... and when the bottom tears off, the cream doesn't stay in the pastry when you pipe it... it comes out the bottom.

BUT: When I used butter the next time, they just EASED OFF... Use butter. 

Otherwise great recipe!

amazing recipe!!!
i was so worried about making cream puffs because i've heard about how hard it is... but this recipe was so straightforward and simple - and what's more, it WORKED! 
I must've read about 40 reviews before actually making mine, and like many people have suggested, I added sugar into the dough (vanilla essence was sold out in supermarket, otherwise that would have gone in too). I also let the dough cool before adding the eggs and poking a hole to let out the steam. Although my first batch sagged (didn't poke hole soon enough), my 2nd batch came out perfect! Even though the first batch didn't really work out, they still taste great and they look alright after i cut them in half and fill them with ice cream. Instead of filling them with the cream, I substituted with vanilla ice cream and added a sprinkle of icing sugar on. These are EXCELLENT. 

Thank you so much for the recipe!! I'm so happy I managed to make puffs :D

Perfect!! Just make sure you add the flour while the butter/water mixture is still simmering--I didn't do that the first time and I had to make another batch--french vanilla filling is great!! I drizzled some chocolate over top and then dusted with powdered sugar--Delicious!!!!

Very good!!! You have to try these this way: I used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, filled the puff with the pudding and drizzled with a little caramel ice cream topping, OMG!!! I think I will just eat these tonight and skip dinner! So easy but such a delicious and elegant dessert.

I found this recipe off of this site several years ago, and ever since then it has been my mom's favorite dessert (although the rest of my family loves it too). After making these cream puffs yet again, I decided I really needed to add my voice to the chorus of admirers. . . I always make a half-batch of the puffs for my family so that I don't have any leftovers. Even with a half-batch of the cream filling, however, I always have plenty left over for the next day. I generally use French vanilla pudding with heavy cream and 2% milk, and follow by folding in Cool Whip to give the filling a lighter feel. After reading some of the reviews here, I'll have to try the white chocolate pudding now. I always drizzle some chocolate on top, which makes them look beautiful. Don't be put off by the lack of sugar in the puffs - this contrasts wonderfully with the rich, sweet filling. This is really a wonderful recipe in its simplicity, taste, presentation and appeal to just about everyone. Thanks so much!

This got great reveiws from my in-laws. And that's saying a lot! I added 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to the dough as it was cooling. It really made a great difference. I only cooked them for 20 min and they came out a little dark. I actually ran out of the pudding mixture so I looked in my fridge and found some home made peach jam. I filled the rest of the puffs with that. It was really sweet, but pretty good. Maybe just a smaller amount of the jam would be better. Either way I will definitely be making these again!

LOVED these puffs! Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great! Better than any other cream puff recipe I have tried. They shells were perfectly hollow (no dough to pull out to make room for filling) with a classic cream puff flavor. I even filled some with real whipping cream, but everyone seemed to like the recipe filling better. EASY & DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

These are absolutely fabulous!  It does help that this is my favorite dessert, but they are also a huge hit with all of my family.  A word to the creative types, the shell is great with chicken salad for any lunch or Shower.

I can't believe that I made these! They are delicious, the perfect blend of sweet and not-so-sweet. My mom always filled them with just whipped cream, but these are so much better with the pudding custard instead! Thanks for a great recipe, I will make this over and over again- I'm taking them to work tomorrow!

These are absolutely beautiful.  I can't believe I made them. I did add 1 tsp sugar in the water with the butter, because I read that in some other recipes.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe, Shellie.

These were awesome, the filling was allright but whipping cream is just as good and I think easier. Don't fill them too full or it will come out one end. :) And I also froze my extras and they stayed good.

Great recipe! I used the cream puffs as the "bread" for chicken salad sandwiches. Everyone loves them.

Most Excellent!  I grew up in a French owned country and I'm always looking for the best French recipes.  Even though this one doesn't use homemade "creme patissiere" to fill the cream puffs the vanilla pudding and cream mixture is great and really fast!  The "pate a choux" or puff dough however is fabulous!  I made smaller sized puffs for the kids.  I drizzled some melted chocolate to decorate and sprinkled with powdered sugar!  They did not last long!  Merci beaucoup & Bon Appetit!

I'm really not having much luck with recipes this week! I'm going to give this 4 stars because the vanilla cream filling was sinfully delicious (I omitted the milk, and used a hand blender to whip it really thick) and I'm sure I will use it again as a 'custard' with other desserts. The pastry shells were disasterous though. They looked so beautiful when I took them out of the oven, but they fell as flat as a pancake as they cooled on the rack, and they tasted horribly eggy. I only managed to get 12 puffs, and there was a ton of surplus cream filling. This was a fun experiment! Thanks, Shellie!

This was a big winner at the family Christmas party this year!  I sprinkled a tiny bit of confectioners sugar on top of half of them, and it seemed to be the preference.  I will make this again, and recommend it to others!

These were very, very, very delicious.  I have never made cream puffs before and this recipe was easy and the results were beautiful!  I dusted powdered sugar on mine!  They were a gift for my Dad's birthday and he ate ALL of them except for the few that I saved and one he gave my Mom!

I tried this two times and both times my puffs collapsed when cool. In searching the internet, I've learned that you need to turn the oven off and allow them to cool with  the door open so they cool slowly and don't collapse.  Another option is to poke them with a tookpick or cake tester to allow the steam to escape.  They still taste wonderful, just not as pretty!  Also, I've split the filling recipe & made 1/2 chocolate & 1/2 vanilla to please my family.  Works just fine

These were sooooo unbelievably good and EASY! I used white chocolate pudding mix, and added 1 t. vanilla. I whipped the filling for several minutes, which made it very fluffy and smooth.  I also added 1 t. vanilla & 1 t. almond extract to the puff dough. I used a chocolate glaze on the top, & these tasted just like mini eclairs!

This recipe works wonderful I've been making puff pastries for awhile and this is a great one.  One really good tip:  USE a  WATER measuring cup NOT a dry ingredient for the water or they will not turn out.

I am really sorry these didn't turn out. I followed every instruction to the letter, but they did not rise.  I had read other reviews that had said similar, so let the dough cool prior to adding the egg(one suggestion), I also noted someone elses looked fried - and that is what happened to mine.  I would go so far as to think that maybe the temperature is too hot - mine looked fried within 15 minutes of the allocated time.  I turned the oven down, but there was no salvaging them at that point.  I didn't even bother to fill them as they were just hard and yuck looking.

The recipe was okay.  I liked the dough, but it did not rise...adding tips about making the puffs (since they are not easy to make) would be helpful when posting a recipe.  I did not like the filling recipe.  The consistency was too rubbery for me.  I was expecting more of a smoothness.  But, I will try it again using some reviewer suggestions such as adding vanilla and then going online to get some baking hints for cream puffs.  I also think I will just use a pudding recipe with a little whip cream.

Perfect!  This was my first attempt at making cream puffs, and they were a hit.  Instead of heavy cream, I used whipped topping, which made for a very tasty, creamy filling.  I made a second batch using chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla - that was good, too!  I will definitely make these again.

These are so easy and are so loved by everyone!  I made my puffs bite-sized for my brother and sister-in-law's wedding reception, and they were a huge hit.  Altering the instant pudding recipe by reducing liquid and using cream makes a delicious filling that rivals any custard.  Thanks Shellie!

This recipe was so good, I made it twice in one week!  I used cheesecake flavored pudding for the filling (less sweet and more flavorful) both times and people LOVED THEM!  The shells smell very "eggy" while baking but I didn't find that they tasted too much like eggs (I used the full amount the recipe called for).  I drizzled melted chocolate chips with a touch of veg. oil mixed in over the top.  Delicious and very easy.

I used the recipe for the puffs only and made the filling from another Cream Puffs entry by "Linda".  The shells turned out beautifully.  I wanted to ensure I got an old-fashioned custard taste in the filling, that's why I opted out of the pudding shortcut.  Very easy shells that puff beautifully.

These were sooooo delicious and impressive. i love buying cream puffs at the bakery, but these are so easy to make and taste even better. The shell is flaky and delicious, and the filling is so thick and creamy. This is a super easy way to impress your friends!

Everyone loves these, it's like I can't make them fast enough. The first time I made them they turned out like quarters. I started using only blue bonnet butter, and medium sized eggs. I also bake them on parchment paper, and they turn out every time. I haven't tried using the mixer. I'll have to do that the next time I make them

These were incredibly easy and turned out perfect! I made my pudding with half and half because I had some I needed to use up. I also drizzled mine with hot fudge. Such a great elegant dessert!

These turned out great! I made sure that I left them in the oven with the door ajar for 15 minutes once they were done baking. This ensured that they wouldn't deflate. Otherwise delicious!

I thought this recipe was perfect - just like the one I used to use years ago!  When beating in each egg, it's important to beat well until the egg is incorporated and mixture is smooth.  Then add the next egg. Leaving them in the oven to dry out was always the way recommended to me.  We used to fill them with ice cream and drizzle chocolate fudge or caramel over the top.  Beautiful, delicious, and easy.

These are not only delicious but very easy to make.  Cream puffs sound like a daunting dessert at first, but this recipe makes it simple and beautiful when topped with powdered sugar right before presentation!  Unfortunately it gets soaked in over time, but very pretty for plating.  I knocked a star off for using instant pudding mix, which does taste like instant pudding...other than that this is a great recipe for starters!

Loved it. I filled with little sweet fresh whipped cream instead of custard and topped it with chocolate ganache. My husband loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Perfect every time. My mom gave me a tip- put them in the oven as quickly as possible so that they puff and stay puffed. I also just leave em in there to cool off before I pull them out. I don't poke them with a toothpick or anything.

Omg I'm definitely in love! I did my due diligence on the art of making cream puffs and this was definitely the simplest and most satisfying recipe. Cooking is all about configuring and tweaking recipes to make it your own, which is exactly what I did. I added a dust of powdered sugar to the top, and used some bits of strawberry and banana in some of my cream giving it a refreshing fruity delight. It reminds me of a small pastry shop in San Francisco that I use to visit all the time to have late night coffee and puff pastries. When I took my first bite it took me back there and that's what good home cookings all about. It uses very few simple and cheap ingredients and it makes the most divine cream puffs. 

I followed the directions directly and half way through cooking process poked a small fork into the pastries as they were baking.(25 mins till golden) The whip cream recipe was perfect and needed no extra configuration, besides adding my simple toppings. I also dusted powdered sugar on top. Would also be good if I added nutella spread just on the bottom of the cream puffs or some chocolate drizzled on top.

I have made these many, many times and forgot to review them. I follow Mommy From Seattle's hints and it couldn't be easier. If they are the only dessert being served, I make them larger. If they are for a party or a holiday where there are several desserts, I make them smaller. No matter what size, everyone loves them.

So very good! Made the recipe 3 times in a week and it came out amazing every time. The only thing I might recommend changing is: dropping a heaping teaspoon of the dough instead of a tablespoon. Delicious!

this recipe was AMAZING!! I loved the cream puffs and couldnt have asked for more. I ate my cream puff with a small drizzle of chocolate, powdered sugar,  and a raspberry on top. I also had one with chocolate drizzle, only it was frozen!! Delicious either way. Also, i think banana cream or custard makes a better, thicker, middle. If you stick with vanilla pudding, add an additional 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon for a better/stronger flavor. Anyways...great recipe!! It was very easy and I strongly recommend it:)

This is close to an old family recipe that we have been making for years.  To make the cream puffs the same size, I used a pipe bag for the dough and used a 24 mini-muffin tray. Thanks for the recipe.

After putting the dough onto the baking pans,brush egg whites on the surface. you will have shiny store bought like puffs :)  My suggestion is that after putting flour in a pan,mix it till you start seeing a thin layer of film like coating side of the pan even the dough shapes a ball. Mine used to not puff it up enough when I didn't mix enough in this process. ( I made a swan with whip cream & butterscotch pudding)

Overall this was so bad.  The cream was amazing but the puffs did not puff.  They were burn't on the bottom but raw in the middle.  I followed the whole recipe exactly and do not know what happened.

I haven't made cream puffs in years. Used to make them all the time when I was a kid. I would usually make my own custard, but decided to try this filling as I was making assorted desserts and wanted to save some time. The custard filling was very good. I may add a little more milk, was slightly stiffer than I would have liked. I topped with some ganache. Everyone loved them! Thanks for the short cut filling!

I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the puffs were amazingly easy, but the recipe instructions were not very instructive. The filling instructions were very easy to follow, and I followed them exactly. After that, I changed it up a little. I Set the water and butter over medium/high heat and let it boil for 1-2 minutes before removing it from the heat and stirring in the flour and salt until it didn't stick to the pan. I then put it in a medium sized bowl and added the eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly afterwards. After spraying the cookie sheets with cooking spray, I took a measuring tablespoon and a small cereal spoon and put tabelspoons of batter onto the cookie sheet about an inch apart, 12 to a tray. I put them in the oven for 20 minutes and removed them from the oven after. I let them sit for 5 minutes before poking a finger in them and filling them with a piping bag full of the cream. I found that I had to make a couple more puff batter batches before I used up all of the filling. They were very delicious and I didn't find them getting soggy either.

i've made these many times, and always with success (and accolades from my friends/family). they have no idea how easy these are to make! the only thing i do different is drop these on my baking sheet (parchment lined) with a TSP instead of TBSP to make smaller puffs. then i sprinkle with powdered sugar. they disappear so quickly! they are always a hit.

SOOO happy!  I never knew I could make delicious cream puffs at home!  Only 4 stars - recipe is good, but I agree with others that the instructions are somewhat lacking.  Follow MommyfromSeattle's instructions exactly and you will not be disappointed!  Thank you for this easy, fun recipe!  I'm going to make them again next week for Easter dinner!  :)

I followed the directions exactly! All the eggs no extra cooling no hole poking. Worked perfectly. I didn't put any custard or pudding in mine, just fresh whipped cream. They lasted all of 10 min. YUMMMM

These were an easy and awesome snack. I took them to a dice get-together and they dissapeared fast. I look forward to making these again.

Tried this recipe and followed MommyFromSeattle's tips. They turned out great! Unfortunately I only made enough for my husband to take to work for a work party so I only got a half a bite :( I'll be making another batch soon just for me!

Ok, I have made this recipe 3 times and followed the review to boil the water and finish everything in the mixer. Every time they do NOT rise but stay flat. I wondered if the water should have been cooler before blending.  I will make again but go back to hand mixing with a wooden spoon. I did not want to waste these flat disk so I put them in a cake pan flat and covered this with the pudding mixture and put bananas and then a chocolate glaze and maraschino cherries to make a banana split dessert. . It was a good save but will go back to my traditional way.

This recipe was very simple to follow and they came out fabulous!  I took some advice from another reviewer and baked them for exactly 20 minutes and when out of the oven I poked them with a tooth pick to let out the steam.  Did not let them rest in the oven as the recipe calls for.  The puffs received rave reviews from my guests.  This will be a go to dessert for sure.

So many suggestions for the perfect puff, what works and what doesn't ?  Well after several years and attempts I've found what works for me. I bake teaspoon size puffs at 425 for 15 mins then turn it down to 350 for about 20 more minutes and finally got puffs instead of soggy flat weird cookies. I also add a tablespoon of sugar right before the flour and lastly one envelope of dream whip to the pudding filling and perfect puffs. I have tried poking holes and turning off the oven and letting them sit along with a million other suggestions but never got perfect results until doing the above.

This recipe is amazing! I  also had the sticking problem, but I let them cool and carefully removed them. I did add more than a tablespoon on the cookie sheet and what I found to be imperative, keep the dough tall on sheet. Go Up instead of out. This might help the ones who didn't have luck with rising. The puffs were so fluffy I just cut a small hole in tops, and piped in the cream mixture. Chocolate Ganache was an amazing tip from other reviews. You can also dust them with powdered sugar. My Hubby took them to work and now the whole office is buzzing for more. Men and their sweet tooth.

When i made this recipe everything went great, so easy.  Accept there was one slight problem.  When it calls for salt, it is way to much, so i say add less salt and BAM it's amazing.  So just that, trust me and they will be amazing!!!!

I make this all the time . I didn't know anyone else used pudding mixed in , it helps to keep the cream stabilized . I also use diet pudding for people who are diabetic and use unsweetened chocolate with slenda to top them like an eclaire .Helps if you remove any wet pastry that may remain on the inside so it is not too eggy or humid. Also I mix the pudding with half the recommended milk in the pudding recipe and fold it in the already whipped cream before the pudding sets

These were unbelievable!!  Yes, there needs to be more detailed instructions, but they were far easier than I expected.  I used an italian Pastry cream filling recipe for the inside, but they were very easy to pipe in and I couldn't believe how easy it was to make!  Make sure to pop holes in the sides 5 minutes before the end of baking!!  Thank you so much!!

This was my 1st attempt at making cream puffs. They turned out great.  I LOVED the filling. I took the suggestion of another viewer and poked a hole in the top 3 min before they were done, also put mini ch chips in the filling although it would have been heavenly without them. I was hoping they would be a little hard on top and a little sweeter. Just saw a review where they should be 'dried out'. I'll do that next time. Another viewer said to use a TBLS of sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. I used the sugar and forgot the vanilla. I think the vanilla would have helped. Either way, everyone still LOVED them.

I'm just getting around to reviewing this, made this weeks ago...in fact, made 4 batches!  I didn't realize how easy it was to make cream puffs.  Only thing I did was for the filling, I halved it, and made 1 batch of chocolate, and 1 batch of vanilla.  Will definitely make this again

I just made the cream puffs and they were delicious!  I made a half batch and mistakenly put a cup instead of a half cup of milk for the filling and was about to run out to the store to get an other box of vanilla pudding mix to remake it but i let the filling sit in the fridge intil everthing was done and it was still thick enough and delicious!! I did also add a tad of vanilla extract in the pastry puff so it wouldnt be so bland, but it didnt make a difference. and to top it all off i made a chocolate sauce for on top the put it all together, and it was also very simple just heavy cream and bittersweet chocolate melted! this recipe you cant go wrong everything about it was so good 5 stars no questions asked!

These were a perfect birthday treat! Just make sure you  poke a hole in the puff and let it sit for 5 minutes in the open (off) oven, and should you choose to pipe the filling in, you need to be very patient and very strong. Also, when baking the puff, make sure it bakes all the way or it will not rise much. (It may look a little dark on the bottom, but this does not matter.) loved it!

I made these for a shower recently-- they were amazing! I followed the directions exactly. My puffs were perfect and beautiful. I made sure to let them bake the full 25min and did not open the oven to look at them (as I read in someone's advice from a previous review). I will absolutely be making these again!

I followed the recipe exactly!! It turned out awesome.  I used 2 different cooking sheets and they slightly stuck to the dark coated..Next time I'll use light only.  I cooked them for the entire 25 minutes and they were perfect.  So easy to make. I allowed the mixture to cool for 5-10 mins before I added the egg!!  Yummy thank you!

Super easy...the first time I made them they turned out perfectly!  I didn't change the puff batter, but instead of vanilla pudding I just used whipped cream with a little vanilla and icing sugar thrown in to sweeten it.  These were delicious and so light and fluffy!  Note: If you don't have a mixer, just use a wooden spoon in a LARGE bowl and beat the batter hard when you add the eggs; at first it will be lumpy but the batter eventually becomes sticky and consistent.  I'll be making these for my next party!

This is the second time in 2 days I make this recipe. Turned out perfect. I did use the electric blender for the dough and they still come out perfectly. I cannot believe how easy it is. I did try the sweeten whipped cream as well with it and dipped the top in chocolate and let them cool for 3 minutes in freezer for the chocolate to harden!!!

It was my first time making cream puffs. I followed the recipe like many had described but unfortunatly they didnt turn out. The cream I will whip next time. I just did it by hand and it was great tasting but more like pudding. The pastry burnt on the outside and didnt cook on the inside so I turned the oven down to 400. It seemed to help for the second batch but as soon as I opened the oven to poke holes in them they immediately deflated.The joys of cooking something new! My husband loves the taste and is eating them all. So the recipe tastes great, just need to find out why they arnt rising and why they arnt cookign all the way through but burning all at the same time. Practice I guess

These turned out perfect and I was a little apprehensive before I tried.  It shouldn't be so easy to make such an impressive dessert!!  :)
I put my batter/dough into a ziploc freezer bag, cut off a corner, and piped onto the baking sheet.  I made mine larger than suggested, so I only got 12 but it could have easily made more.

My Mother made these treats for us as I grew up.  After baking, she would cut the "TOP" off like a lid, push the membrane to the sides and set them in the hot oven to dry out while it cooled.  After filling, she would put the top on and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  coconut cream is my favorite!

I cut the milk by a third of what the pudding calls for. Cool pudding then whip the heavy cream and fold gently into the pudding. Makes a light filling everyone loves them. Make a chocolate glaze with choc chips, butter, and confection sugar, and spread a little on top when cool

Love these cream puffs.  All the extra advice is good:  poke a hole in when done baking; leave he oven door ajar with the puff in for an hour.  Add a little sugar.  The filling my family prefers is a box of lemon pudding/pie filling. prepared according to directions (I always add an additional 1/4 cup lemon juice because we like it tart), and cooled.  My mom used to make these and fill with sweetened whipped cream. Yum!

AWESOME!!! But they were too watery and when I baked them they came out FLAT. But afterwards I added some more flour and it turned out good. I replaced the called filling with pastry cream (found on this forum), and it was like HEAVEN. I recommend it!

Not sure what happened but mine were more like cream "flats" than cream "puffs".  Still tasty with pudding on top of them though...

We made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.  I didn't think the filling was too eggy at all, and I defintely don't think the puffs need any sweetening.  They were delightful and I will defintely make them again!

I am so sad, and never write bad reviews, but I am very sad how these turned out...when my husband and I were younger I made cream puffs with his aunt. They were light, airy, slightly eggy and looked just like the picture, which is why I chose this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out flat, and very very eggy. =( I am not giving it zero stars, because, the process is the same as I remember, and I wonder if I would have followed some of the tips in the reviews that I am now reading, maybe they would have turned out better. The filling was great!!! =) What I did was "set" the pudding in the small amount of milk frist, then, beat it in with the whipped cream making it really light and airy. It was very good.I ended up just dolloping it on top of the flat "puffs" and topping with a little semi-sweet gonache. I hope to try it again, using other peoples "changes" and see if it is what my husband ate in his childhood, and I made so long ago!

My first attempt at cream puffs! they turned out very well, although you could definitely tell that it was pudding. I used 1 pkg vanilla and 1 pkg white chocolate, next time I'll do both white chocolate.

The cream is to die for! My father's almost diabetic so I opted to use less cream and went with the Instant French Vanilla Pudding Sugar Free/Fat Free version instead which came out just as great!

I can't even describe how easy these were to make. The butter/water base boiled in minutes, the dough formed within seconds, the eggs tempered perfectly, they baked in 20-25 minutes as described. I did taste a bit of the eggy-ness that reviewers talked about but in my opinion it only added to the puff. I prepared them with a tablespoon of ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Overall, they were SO EASY and SO DELICIOUS. :P

Great dessert and quite easy to make.  Just for variety, I will make the puffs, split them and fill with whipped cream and then ice them with a little chocolate buttercream.  Either way, they never last long.

These are very delicious, but didn't quite "puff up" like I had hoped. I too, read all the reviews before cooking and here is what I have to offer. I followed the recipe to a "T" and baked for 20 minutes flat. Perfect time. Use parchment paper, definitely, a MUST! Despite users saying 4 eggs was "too eggy" I thought the taste of the puffs were amazing with the sweetness of the filling. I used previous tips from AllRecipe users of poking the puffs immediately after baking to prevent deflating and it worked for the most part, but some still went flat, but it did not affect taste! I used one-and-a-half 1-oz. sugar free pudding mixes in place of the usual 3.5 oz. pudding mix. Lemon and Vanilla, both were phenomenal. (The sugar free makes more.) Filling was too thick to put through frosting dispenser, so I sliced and spoon filled them. I did not cool the batter, instead I added each egg and IMMEDIATELY used my hand mixer to mix the eggs in before they "cooked" in the hot batter. Wished I had powdered sugar or chocolate sauce to top the cream puffs with. Puffs are not sweet, but I liked it that way. The filling is very sweet so the "neutral" taste of the puffs was the perfect companion. I chose to top the finished cream puffs with lowfat Cool Whip, which my son and his friends loved. These cream puffs were a hit and I froze some for future deliciousness! Would make again. The kids are already begging for more, a week later!

These turned out beautiful.  The only thing I would mention is my first batch deflated because I didn't cook them long enough.  Make sure you cook them til the tops are completely browned.  Also to prick a hole in the side of them while they are cooling helps!

I didn't think making cream puffs would be this easy, but it was.  I have to say the smaller cream puffs came out a little better because they remained light and puffy, even after they cooled.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks so much!

These are very easy to make and are a real crowd pleaser! For my wedding (36 yrs ago!!) we filled cream puffs with tuna and beef salad, which were a big hit. Just make them smaller and fill 'em up.

Very fustrated!!! I made these once before and had to do 2 trails and the last trail was spot on (that was nearly 6 months ago) lastnight and today I have done 3 batches of the pastry and the first one I realized I used bread flour and not all purpose, they came out very bready. I ran to the store and bought all purpose flour. Came home and made second batch and they are now just slitghy bready. URGH!
Is there a trick to this? W/OUT having to stop in the middle of baking and poke holes in the puffs.

Great, turned out really yummy. I took one review's advice and let them finish in the oven for another ten minutes once it was off in order to make sure they got done on the inside. But wonderful, recipe. Light, fluffy, and good, I made a chocolate version, still so good.

This is wonderful! I follwed the recipe to a "T". I only added 1 tsp of vanilla extract while beating the egg yolks one at a time. I used parchment paper for easy clean up. The only thing is when the timer went off and I took the puffs out they collapsed and I did not know what happened? Is it because I have a gas stove and the baking time is a little different? These cream puffs taste light, yummy and wonderful. I will make this again, hoping they will not collapse next time around. This recipe was not difficult to make. I thought it would take me a lot longer. tahnk you for sharing.

AMAZING! Seriously the easiest cream puff recipe ever. Changes I made: Instead of using heavy cream I used Fat Free Half and Half, and cut the amount of butter in half to make them a little healthier. I cooked them for 18 min. and then poked a hole in each one with a toothpick. Then left them in the oven(turned off) with the door open for another 5 min.They turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making these again.

I never knew cream puffs were so easy!  I would have made them many times before now had I known...  I got rave reviews on these, even from people who don't normally like cream puffs, so it's a winner!

Although the taste is 5 stars and my wife and i loved them, i had a hard time understanding the recipe. I think the directions could have been much more better. I kinda tweeked it a little because i couldnt follow the last part with the eggs and ended up putting only 2 eggs and turned out amazingly great....

Made these treats last night and it was a success! I added only 3 eggs (per other suggestions) as well as added a splash of vanilla extract (per other suggestions). As soon as I removed them from the oven, I poked holes in them to let the steam out and was able to pipe in the vanilla cream using a zip log bag with a hole cut off the tip of it. I will for sure make this again!! Thank you!!

Puffs are great.  I just wipped some cream with a little sugar and spooned it on top of the puffs which is alot easier and tastes great. 1/2 pt cream to 1/4c sugar.

the cream puff did turn out well, however i recommend that you use smaller eggs or one less egg because they tasted a little too eggy. the filling was amazing as it is but there is also a french vanilla instant pudding mix by jello that is just as good but whiter in color so it lookes better :) definitely recommend it with minor modifications

Very good and easy to make! I was getting really lazy at the end so I put very large dough drops down. Overall they came out really good! I used french vanilla instant pudding and used tip #32 with my pastry bag. I will be using this recipe again for dinner parties. Thanks for sharing!

This was my 1st time ever making cream puffs and they came out really good!  Everyone loved them!  I did follow some recomendations like poking them to let the steam out and keep them in the oven after they are done baking because when I 1st took them out I pulled one a part and it was still soft/mushy inside.  Great recipe to start with!!  I also drizzled chocolate over it when I was done!! YUM!

This is a standard Cream puff recipe it works perfectly, Follow the recipe exactly. Put mixer on highest speed after eggs are added and whip the batter until light in color and elastic looking. Aprox. 3 min. then pipe onto sheet.

So I am a little confused by all the issues with the puff portion.  I have been making this for a lot of years now, and have never had one single issue. I make it as written and always have, it was my first time ever making Cream Puffs so I never dared vary. Only thing I have ever done to change it in any way was to change flavors of pudding mix....i have used vanilla, Pistachio, and choc. ......all are a hit! The other thing I do is take a container of choc. frosting, heat it up in Mic. for a while (till soupy) stick a butter knife in it and drizzle over top of filled puffs. I have tried cutting in half and filling and using a pastry bag...doesnt really matter much to me.

this is definitely worth 5 stars! a HUGE crowd pleaser! but just a heads up, the filling is more like eclair filling... not cream puff. no mind, just drizzle some chocolate sauce on top and you've got yourself a winner! oh, and adding some vanilla to the dough is a nice touch. overall, VERY tasty!

These were easy and delicious. Let the dough cool almost completely before you add the eggs- no problem w the eggs 'cooking'!  I made these for my tea party and they were the hit. Not overly sweet- just perfect!  Next time I will make a triple batch and try chocolate and banana puddings in addition to the vanilla!!! This is a keeper.

These were awesome.  My daughter turned 12 today and wanted cream puffs instead of cake. I used margarine and baked them until they were golden all over and the peaks were light brown.  I used margarine (all I had) and it worked just fine.  It was a high oil content margarine, though.  They really puffed up and stayed puffed up, too. Great recipe!

Excellent, I tripled the recipe and got 88 mini (1 tbsp) and 12 regular sized (2 tbsps dough) filled with pastry cream blended with whipped cream and topped with chocolate glaze. The hit of the party, everyone raved!

Five words describe this recipe - "beautiful, tasty, and a winner!" First time for making cream puffs. After reading several reviews, I opted to change baking time to 30 minutes instead of 25. Wise choice - puffs did not collapse when cooled. Other than this, I followed the recipe as written. Not sure what to use to create a small opening in puffs, I chose a fine-bladed knife tip. Next time, if it's possible, I'll cut away a small portion on top of the puff then replace once pudding is in it. No pastry bag so filled a zip-lock type bag, cut a small hole on one corner then added pudding. My taste buds picked up the egg flavor in the puff, which took away the flavor of the pudding. However, ate one after it was refrigerated for two hours and the egg taste is gone. Some reviewers mentioned making puffs smaller; inserting the pudding may present a problem because it is thick. Thanks, Shellie, for sharing your recipe with us.

I tried the recipe as stated and they turned out great! I was a little unsure about the dough at first because it was a strange, sticky texture. They baked up wonderfully and even though they fell after i took them out of the oven they puffed back up once I piped the cream in. GREAT RECIPE!

Delicious!  I added vanilla extract to the dough and used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

This was my FIRST time making cream puffs. Thanks to the review from MommyfromSeattle, they came out PERFECT!  I melted some dark chocolate Valentines candy in the microwave, and drisled it over the top. Fantastic!

I'm a beginner and I was skeptical but these turned out great! I was so paranoid that they would go flat but I simply took them out of the oven and poked holes in them so they could dry out.  We melted chocolate chips and put it on top with some coconut.  My husband lived in Paris for two years and said these tasted just like he was there again. He's never said that for any other pastry!

This recipe makes cream puffs so easy! My dad always used to make the cream filling from scratch, stirring and stirring over a hot stove until the sauce thickened. Of course the result was delicious, but these are very yummy too and take a fraction of the time. I like to top them with dark chocolate/coffee sauce and powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing!

It was amazingly good. I, however, changed the recipe because I didn't have enough on hand. However, I think the change made it SO MUCH BETTER. I added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 coffee creamer and 1/2 cup of water and 1&1/2 cup of heavy cream. This gives it a better taste in my opinion and makes it more fluffy. I used a mixer. I think this is what makes it not deflate while baking, because the second time I mixed it by hand it deflated.

Super Easy, and always a hit!  You can change the filling flavor with a different pudding mix, or a bit of mint liqueur or extract for a little fancifying...

This is one of the easiest recipes I've come across for baking. The dough was sticky and made my hand mixer a little irritated! Other than that, I would feel comfortable making these anytime and it could be 'kid friendly' for supervision. The fun part was putting the dough on the cookie sheet. I used parchment paper for a nice easy release to the cooling rack. I was thinking of putting a little sugar in the flour mixture. Glad I didn't because the cream is plenty sweet. I also opted to use a teaspoon for smaller puffs. Hope this helps the experimental chefs like myself.

I have made this dozens of time. Instead of the filling, I Make the "french" version by cutting the puff in half (once cooked of course!)and placing a little chocolate sause in the bottom. then add a little scoop of vanilla ice cream, cover with other half. Add a little whipped topping and drizzle with chocolate sauce.  WONDERFUL!

Lost my 25+ year recipe so resorted to this.  Incorporated some modifications as I remember them from my recipe; 3 eggs + 1 egg white and used bread flour.  Excellent!    No KitchenAid here!  This basic recipe was developed hundreds of years ago and they didn't have elec. mixers... so, I proceed with hand mixing.  Sure, it's more effort but you get a real feel for the dough, so no over-mixing.  Added vanilla w/my 3rd medium-sized egg.  Delightful!

Well for me they looked awesome, I did what some said about leaving the door vented for them to dry out and not turn to mush. But.... the four eggs really made these taste like scrambled eggs.... My dogs ended up getting them. I didn't read some of the reviews until I was making them. So that sucks but yeah just to many eggs!!

Did anyone think about putting ice cream inside these puffs and putting caramal or chocolate sauce on them? Really good and quick. How about strawberries also.

Nostalgia! Profiteroles! Filled these babies with Old-Fashioned Vanilla Pudding from this site (no comparison!) and added a little vanilla to the dough. If puffs didn't form their own holes, poking with a toothpick was key for steam-release. Leaving vanilla out, puffs can also be stuffed with non-dessert salads (crab, chicken, etc).

This recipe turned out great. I was worried about the deflation,not to take chances i did like some reviewers did and poked a hole with a toothpick right after baking. Also used parchment paper to avoid any sticking to the bottom. Everyone enjoyed! Thanx 4 this great recipe.  will do again & again. ?

I made this yesterday for Valentines Day for my family and Wow!  They loved these so MUCH!  I was skeptical because the filling was not a from scratch recipe but it is far better than any of the much more difficult and cooked custards I have made to try to duplicate my sweetie's Mom's recipe for Cream Puffs.  Please try this recipe.  It is truly fasntastic!

This recipe was awesome!!!  I love to cook but don't have that much experience with baking.  I know many reviews mentioned having a hard time with the shells but I found them to be super easy to work with.  After they cooled, I poked a tiny hole in the side with the pointy end of a chopstick.  I don't have a pastry bag so I used a ziploc bag.  I filled the bag with the pudding, cut a very small hole in the corner of the bag and filled the shells.  A few of the shells had slightly sagged but once I filled it with the cream, they puffed right up.  I probably used more pudding for each one than I was supposed to because I ran out before all of the shells were filled.  These taste incredible!  I brought them to a friends house and everyone raved about them!  Will definitely make them again soon!

This is ingenious, I have always made these with plain whipped cream fillings and although I enjoyed them, I always thought they needed just a little something more - turns out is was pudding!  I have now tried this with different flavours of pudding with great results every time.  I've never had a problem with the puffs going soggy or not drying our properly and this recipe is spot on with the method.  I have also made the puffs in big batches and frozen them.  To use, just put in a medium oven for 5 to 10 minutes - until warm and slightly crisped.  When I made these for my husband's 30th birthday party I made a huge tower of them with chocolate pudding filling and dark and white chocolate drizzled all over.  Another one I forgot to take a photo of!

I've probably made these 6+ times now.  I add a lil splash of vanilla to the dough and about a teaspoon to the pudding.  I bake them on parchment. Definitely poke a hole or two in each one with a toothpick and pop back into the oven for a minute or two to dry them a little and keep them from collapsing. Then slice carefully with a serrated knife and remove any little eggy insides. These were the first dessert to go (over red velvet cake, pumpkin pie chocolate cream pies) at Christmas Eve dinner.

I am actually rating the cream. I made the cream right before my party and found that it was very watery. Therefore,I bought a 5.1 oz pudding mix, added 1 cup of heavy cream, and 1 cup of milk. I found this to have a better consistency and not so watery. I was also confused if the cream needed to be chilled for a long time, because it was not thickening. So with the new measurements, the cream turned out amazing. 
The puff part was amazing and very easy.
I used 3 eggs instead of 4. I am def. going to make this again and make it perfect!

Great recipe.  Had to make 70 for my son's class and they puffed up perfectly.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe.

It took me 7 tries to get this right. This recipe is probably technique sensitive, but overboiling the water/butter mixture ALWAYS ruins my batter. So whenever I make it, I guard it obsessively..a few seconds after the "rolling boil" action begins, I remove it from heat right away and add the flour in. It will look quite like mashed potatoes. Then while the mixture is still warm, I start beating in the eggs..which reminds me! I have to beat in a small bowl...doing it in a big bowl again ALWAYS ruins my batter. For those who have never made cream puffs before, watch out for limp/liquidy batter that won't really hold shape when you squeeze them onto the cookie sheet. That's when you know the batter is bad and the dough won't "puff" up in the oven. If the batter is good, just bake at 425*F and you're good to go. All my friends and family LOVE LOVE LOVE these when done properly.

I followed the recipe to a *T*, even went back and checked 3 times (yes 3 times) to make sure I copied the ingredients and directions down correctly because what I came up with was a soupy mess. I was so sad that this recipe didn't work out. Maybe I will take up the suggestions that others have offered and try them again, but as-is this recipe get a big thumbs down. It makes me sad to write this because I was counting on this recipe to be good!

these are very easy to make, easy to cleanup too because the batter doesn't stick to anything when done properly. They look great and puffed up nicely. Unfortunately, they were not as light and crispy on the outside as the ones at bakeries, and that's what I was hoping they'd be like. They were also lacking sweetness, which could be easily fixed by a good drizzle of chocolate on top of each ball. I did sprinkle some icing sugar on top, but that was not enough. I filled with sweetened whipped cream which everyone likes in my family and enjoys better than the pudding custard. Thanks for the recipe, even though not a huge hit, they were pretty good and the kids ate them all!

These cream puffs are soo easy to make! Not only are they easy, but the cream recipe is to die for! I use cheesecake flavored pudding and it really makes them extra rich! I am in college and every time I make these, people are amazed at how easy they are!

These were a hit!  I too added almond extract (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon) to the filling.  I drizzled caramel and chocolate on top.  Perfect!  Thanks for a great and super easy recipe!

I didn't have parchment paper, so I laid a sheet of aluminium foil and sprayed it lightly with some spray. The bottom didn't burnt/brown. It was perfect. I also poked a few holes using a toothpick about 15-20 minutes into the baking cycle.  Then return the pastry back to the oven to finish up cooking. After cooking, I split them using a knife and it didn't deflate. 
QUESTION: What is the proportion if I am going to make 2 different types of fillings?  Mine turned out a little lumpy.  
Also, I used 4 medium eggs and they weren't quite eggy.

WOW!!! That was so easy and a wonderful treat. I made half with the vanilla and the other half with pistachio. I did read the reviews and let the shells cool in the oven they were perfect. 
Thank you

Since this was my first time making cream puffs, I was ecstatic that they didn't deflate and it turned out beautifully! The only thing I didn't care for was the vanilla pudding mixture. I'm looking for more of a whipped filling, like the ones in the Belgian mini cream puffs that you can buy at Costco or Sam's club. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know :)

Other than that, I am very pleased with this easy recipe.

Mine came out very eggy and deflated after cooking...all I did was use only 3 eggs and added 1 tbsp. sugar. However, they were still a hit and were so easy to make! I used pistachio pudding and banana cream flavored pudding with fresh sliced strawberries....the pistachio was very popular. I would like to try again to make them fluffier.

followed directions from mommyfromseattle except i wasn't paying attention and added 1 tbsp vanilla but still ended up great.  tasted exactly like cream puffs and didn't deflate.  had too much filling left over so next time probably will only make 1/2 the filling.  this is a keeper

I read all the review's and used only 3 eggs and The shell still taste like egg. I will not give up because I know if I keep working on it it can be a good cream puff. Maybe next time I will use 2 eggs 2 Tbs sugar and 2 tsp vanilla to the batter. I will update once I get It down.

really fancy looking but easy to make. I made ~20 med-large puffs and filled them with pastry cream then drizzled with melted chocolate and sprinkled with pow. sugar. I didn't have any trouble with cooking eggs (use room temperature eggs!), be prepared and move quick! I used my kitchen aid mixer.

Awesome recipe.  The tip on using a toothpick was really helpful. I also found that baking until they are dry is essential. The cream filling is delicious and SO easy. I used the white chocolate pudding variation and it was a hit.  I drizzled white chocolate over them and used fresh raspberries to decorate.  Can't wait to make it again.

i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong but this is my third recipe for cream puff.  i think the batter is pretty much the same; the fillings are just a little different.  these are tasty, but i wish my puffs would actually "puff" a lot more than one and a half inch.  (my batter looks to liquidy... even when i chill it.)  what am i doing wrong?  over beating?

AWESOME recipe!  My first time making creme puffs.  I made them for a party and they were a huge hit.  I added 2 tbs sugar as my only change.  I used salted butter and added the salt, so I thought the sugar might balance it out.  I did everything else by the recipe.  I made small puffs and they were done in about 17 minutes.  One batch were bigger and they didn't stay as puffy.  I also piped melted chocolate.  Delish!!!

I made these for my husband for a Valentine's Day surprise, and these were so delicious!! I used the white chocolate pudding b/c my husband is a big chocolate fan and am really glad I did b/c they tasted awesome.  These looked so professional, one of the best recipes I have ever used.  I took the advice of a reviewer and used parchment paper so I had no problems with them sticking or burning. I did not add the vanilla as other suggested (meant to but forgot) and  they turned out wonderfully, although I will probably still add a little vanilla next time to see how they turn out that way.  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!!

I'm a cook at the Newark Abbey in NJ.  The monks love their sweets!  this is such an easy recipe and it never fails.  It tastes better than a bakery's.  They also like their meals homemade.

I love this recipe for it's excellent taste, thye think i spent hours making this!

absolutely LOVE these..I follow some of the other popular suggestions...like adding some vanilla...and poking the holes. I have made these several times. Once, I even made them for a chef friend of mine, and he loved them too!

delicious, heart clogging goodness. i think the recipe could've been more detailed though for amateur cream puff makers like me. (aka. are you supposed to remove the flour mixture from the heat after or before the flour? the texture of the dough mixture also turns shiny and smooth after about the 3rd egg addition).   no deflation problem for me. baked for 25 min. i think i prefer half whipped cream/half pudding for the filling though, and next time i would just use milk to make the filling.

Wonderful!  Very, very easy to make.  I did use fat free, sugar free white chocolate pudding.  Actually I made the vanilla pudding 1st and didn't like the flavor, so did another batch with the white chocolate...much better!  I made the water, butter flour mixture put it all in my stand up mixer then added 1 tsp vanilla & pinch of sugar like other said, mixed the eggs together, poured in and mixed immediately easy, easy, couldn't have been better/easier.  I used my pampered chef stone and had no problems with sticking or rising.  Finished with a little powdered sugar, then drizzeled Gingers Satiny Chocolaze Glaze over it.  Then my 18 yr. old had 4 gone!  Definately a keeper.

I have never made a dessert that was this good.  Very easy to make.  I poked my puffs with a shish ka bob stick with a few minutes left to bake.  I had some still deflate but I should have left that batch in for a little longer.  Definitely wait until the tops are browning.  I will try adding a bit of vanilla and sugar to my next batch of puffs.  I am taking these to every Christmas, New Year's, Easter....

I needed a specialty dessert for luncheons in my bistro during the holidays.  I made the cream puffs as directed, but added a little vanilla as recommended. Then instead of filling with the pudding I cut them in half and dipped the top half in melted chocolate and topped with holiday sprinkles.  When ready to serve I topped the bottom half with peppermint ice cream placed the chocolate covered top on and drizzle chocolate sauce over.  This was a hit!  Did it for 5 luncheons and everyone loved it each time.  Would make a great valentine dessert with strawberry ice cream.

These are so yummy! I baked them until they were golden brown and did not have any problems with them collapsing.  I filled them with the vanilla pudding and also with the white chocolate pudding - white chocolate was the favorite.  I dipped the tops in ganache - absolutely to die for!

Delicious.  I topped with powdered sugar and saintly chocolate glaze.  However, I followed the instructions to avoid deflating (poke a small hole right after they come out of the oven) and they still deflated.  I think I need to make them smaller and try poking the hole a few mintues before they come out.  Any suggestions on what went wrong?

I cannot believe how simple these were to make!  I served them for dessert when we had a house full of guests...no sooner did I set them out and they were all gobbled up.  These cream puffs were a huge hit.

I've made this for a party and everybody was impressed. The only change I've made was to use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. I cut a cap and I made the holes bigger so I can fit more filling. I replaced the cap and spread with chocolate frosting on top. They looked and tasted really good. Thanks for this recipe !

What more could you want?  Just a few simple ingredients, quick and easy to make and delicious!  I piped the pudding into the shell using a zip-lock bag (seal in the pudding and snip the corner).  As an alternative, the cream puffs could be dipped in chocolate to make a yummy éclair.  I am always looking for new recipes for my mother (who is diabetic), so my next try at this recipe will be with sugar-free pudding.

I love these cream puffs. I followed the directions exactly. The filling is really tasty and really simple. I also put store bought chocolate frosting on top of some. I made the mistake of covering half of the puffs with saran wrap before they had cooled completely and the moisture from condesation sort of made them deflate. Make sure you let them completely cool before covering, oh yeah I had tons of pudding left over afterwords. It might be possible to half the filling.

These came out very well, but did deflate completely - not sure what I did wrong in that respect, but the taste was excellent.  I reduced the eggs to 3 and otherwise followed the tips from MommyfromSeattle (added eggs all at once, pierced puffs with toothpick, etc).  If I can fix the deflation issue, then I will definitely make these again.

These puff shells were perfect! They turned out lovely!  However, I used the recipe for the Pastry Cream submitted by Kevin Ryan... which is delicious... The two combined made for a cream puff my coworkers swore up and down that I got them from a fancy bakery downtown... But I'll admit, they were quite a bit of work...

Wow!  Really impressive!
Save yourself a ton of calories by just using sugar free/fat free pudding prepared as box instructs (instead of using heavy cream).

I used this cream recipe, but used Alton Brown's recipe for the dough.  They turned out fabulous.  The cream was light and had the perfect amount of sweetness.  The cream puffs were a hit at the party!

These were FABULOUS.  They are also great with ice cream in the middle instead of the pudding mixture.  My favorite for those in the midwest:  Oberweiss - with a little chocolate sause drizzled on the top.  Yum!

I made this for a class project and everyone loved them. My friend was impressed cause he thought cream puffs were on a whole new baking level. I tried to tell him this recipe is beyond easy. I used my tablespoon measuring scoops and shaped as if it were icecream. I find using the baking paper doesn't leave you with that slightly flat end.

Made the changes as per other users (omit 1 egg, add vanilla and sugar, poke a hole).  These were amazing!  Tried adding lemon pie filling and wowed everyone.

Wow, these were GREAT. Everyone LOVED them. They were fun and easy to make. I followed the suggestions from "mommyinseattle" and they came out perfect. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and next time I'll drizzle with chocolate. I didn't think that I could make something that looked like a pro made it. Thanks for sharing!

well I tried this recipe again and it was by far even much better by following the recipe correctly this time! There are so many wonderful different fillings we can used, this time I used a chocolate filling , but the puff itself is the ultimate challenge and success! My family adores these!

These were awesome!  The only change I made was to add vanilla like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I also followed other's suggestion to poke a hole into the puffs after cooking for 20 minutes.  My puffs didn't collapse, and I thought this dessert was wonderful. I'm certain I'll use this recipe for the next potluck.  Thanks!

My mom and I made these together and they were amazing as a Christmas dessert. I made a few modifications, following other reviews. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 2 cups of milk. I added 1 T. of sugar and 1 t. of vanilla to the dough. I also cooked the puffs for 10 minutes at 425 and then 375 for 15 minutes. I turned off the oven and left them with the oven door cracked open to cool. I also drizzled with chocolate. Heavenly!! Thank you, Shellie!!

I made these cream puffs for our Christmas party and they were a huge hit!  I even doubled the recipe to accomodate everyone.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe on my top list. One tipe: Make sure to poke a hole in the cream puffs and let them cool so that they don't collapse.

Very easy!  I did add 1 teaspoon of almond extract to pudding and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to cream puffs.  Made for my Dad's b'day and everyone loved them.

Make sure they are all the way cooked, or else they will be flat and not very pretty (but still yummy.) I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla- perfect for a choco-holic

I substituted ice cream for the cream filling to make profiteroles. The puffs rose beautifully and turned out to be so light and airy. It resembles popovers that I had in Boston. It would be good even if you had it fresh out of the oven with butter only. A definite keeper!

good taste, but i think i did something wrong, as mine didnt rise too much. i added too much flour as i did not heat the flour/water/butter enough, and so my mixture was too runny. thanks for sharing :)

These were good, but I did not much like the cream filling. It was much too runny, even after hours of refrigeration, so I made another cream recipe instead. Also, the taste was a bit bland. Otherwise, it was quite satisfactory.

I did not make any changes to the pastry part of the recipe and it turned out perfect.  It can be used for sweet recipes like this and eclairs but also for savory (stuff these puffs with chicken or tuna salad at your next shower).  I prefer just plain sweetened whipping cream to the pudding style filling.

These reminded me of the cream puffs we get at a giant Quarter Horse show in Ohio, the Congress.  The filling is so good!  Very easy filling and dough.  I would reccomend using a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the eggs in, takes some muscle!  I dipped mine in chocolate and they were perfect!

So easy and yummy!  These are prefect.  The only thing I changed, I let the dough cool for a few min. prior to adding the egg.  And I filled them from the bottom.

AWESOME!!! First time to make it was for a company event and it received rave reviews from all! In fact, people seriously thought I bought them at a bakery.

I kept everything the same but did melt some chocolate and put on top of the puff just because I like chocolate! These do freeze well.

Good, but I gave 4 stars because you should add at least 1 tablespoon of sugar to cut some of the egg/plain flavor
Make them SMALL, and they do not collapse, and stay firmer when filled. 

If you're looking to cheat, I filled them with whipped cream in a can, no pasty bag needed.

These cream puffs are extremely easy and very good for a 'shortcut' recipe.  The taste is a bit egg-y, but once they are filled you don't notice it.  Note:  I didn't try the filling for the recipe; this review is only for the puffs themselves.

I had Jello Chocolate pudding in the house, so I used that instead of the vanilla instant pudding mix, and it tasted fabulous!  I was especially pleased with the pastry shells.  I'd tried to make cream puffs before from a different recipe, and they did not turn out nearly as well as these.  Yummy!

This was my first time making cream puffs, and it won't be my last!  The possibilities for these are endless!  When I whipped up a small "trial batch", I sampled them with different fillings: whipped topping, mexican spinach dip, melted chocolate, and each one tasted great.  Thanks for showing us how easy these can be.  :)

This is the first cream puff recipe I've ever used.  I made it for a tea party, and everyone raved about it.  I thought they were great too, but I gave only 4 stars because the batter/dough was really really thin after adding the eggs and a little hard to work with.  Will most likely make again!

Perfect and easy. I didn't even transfer to another mixing bowl. I beat eggs one at a time in the same pan, with a wooden spoon. We used homeade chicken salad to fill. mmmmm...

These puffs were great.  It was a messy process to fill the puffs, but I'd never used a piping bag before.  I'm sure practice will make perfect.  I did have to experiment with sizes of dough to get the right shape and size pastry, but I will never buy the frozen ones again, now that I know how inexpensive and rewarding it is to make my own!

Thanks Shellie!  I was always a bit intimidated to try Cream Puffs...this was too easy and too good!  I am an advisor to 14 & 15 year old girls at church and am passing this recipe on to them.  They will love it!

Turned out great, I cooked them a little bit longer than stated.  Also, I used white chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla--it was rich and creamy.  Very good recipe!

This was pretty good.  I did cut it down to 3 eggs and it was still definitely quite eggy, but I think cream puffs are anyway.  I also followed a tip that others had left, and whipped the filling, it was delicious that way.

This was a great and easy recipe!!! My first time with cream puffs and using a pastry filler thingy. My husband who is a gourmet cooking snob was so impressed! :) I have a small oven and did several batches. I  did find some of my batches did fall.    I think making sure you cook the puffs longer and making smaller balls helped keep them puffy. I also used instant pudding. I ran into some trouble using the pastry filler for the first time but realized that I was using too small of a point, switched to a bigger point and after that it was easy. I made them the night before a tea party, filled them the day off and got rave reviews. I had some for my co-workers the next day and they were great then too!

Can I give this a 10?  I must say, these are the BEST cream puffs I've had my entire life!  Beats any professional bakery anyday!  I am just sorry I only made 1/2.  After I finished making these, I placed them on a plate and went around with it to pass to others to try.  The first person I went to, my dad, helped himself to one and after trying it, took the plate out of my hand and said he'll take the rest (and he ate ALL of them himself!).  Now, this doesn't seem to be that big of a deal, other than the fact that everything I cook, he always has to add fishsauce (we're asian) or just passes it up.  Now for him to devour them all, it MUST be good!  I can't wait to share these with others!  THANK YOU!!!

I love this recipe, everytime I make this people always ask for the recipe! When making the filling, I mix the ingredients untill they are whipped, so when u turn the bowl over it stays in place. But other then that I wouldn't change a thing, Delicious!

"center SHOULD be dry." I agree, they SHOULD. No matter how I baked these, they were still all mushy inside, whereas they APPEARED to be perfect.  They did puff and have a nice, golden brown texture on top.  After the HUGE disappointment, I didn't even bother to make the filling.. I'll never even bother to make these again.

I have made these cream puffs several times.  I have never received more compliments on any recipe.  Every time that I make them, I am asked where I got the recipe and how hard they are to make.  My reply is allrecipes.com and they are simple to make and delicious to eat and you can make them in advance.

I made these last night for my brother and sister-in-law and they came out perfect.  Really easy recipe and quick to make.  I drizzled chocolate on top of the puffs and they were a hit.  I also baked them in the oven for about 30 minutes.

The filling was great but the puff itself was gross. You could taste and smell the eggs. Maybe I will try it again using only 2 eggs.

Delicious and really fast and easy to make.  I made 6 large ones (8 would have been better) - just be sure to bake it for the full 25 mins. or they may be a little doughy inside.  Family loved them!

This recipe was wonderful! I was skeptical about using vanilla pudding until I did a taste test for myself. My husband and two children ate every single cream puff before I got home from work. They did not even save one for my. I will definetly make this recipe in the future.

My guests LOVED these cream puffs.  I rolled them in powdered sugar before I filled them because I didn't think they were sweet enough without it. Good stuff!

This is a great recipe. Thought I mendled a little with the filling. Anstead putting the wipping cream into the pudding, I wipped it stiff and then I mixed it to the pudding with cut up strawbeeries. Oh, those tasted so good!!!!!. Will experiment with different fillings. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my favorite party dessert. I add make the pudding according to package directions & add an 8 ounce cool whip.***For a beautiful presentation, sprinkle the tops w/ powdered sugar & place puffs in a ring around outside edge of platter. Make a nice big pile of fresh strawberries in the middle. Very impressive!!

These are so great! For me, the only way to eat them is with warm chocolate sauce (I used the sauce from the Eclairs II recipe). If you are out to really impress people, you can use the fancy name for cream puffs--"profiteroles."

This was my first attempt at ever making cream puffs...what a success!  These were so easy to make!  I made them for my in-laws Christmas gathering and everyone enjoyed them.  I made two batches and used three different types of pudding with each batch.  Let's just say out of 50 cream puffs, I left 4 hours later with not one!  They were truly a hit!  I will for sure be making these again (and not just for a special occasion either).  Thank you, Shellie for making me look good!

I made these for a christmas party.  It was a hit.  I made them bite size by using a pastry bag.  I also used white chocalate pudding and the chocalate sauce from the recipe eclairs II.  If you want a dessert everyone wil be impressed with this is it.

My 13 year old made this for her French class.  Very easy.  She's decided this is her speciality now!  And for the chocolate lovers out there...... we combined one vanilla with one chocolate pudding for a very light flavored filling.  It was yummy!

I made these with 2 cups of flour instead of one because the texture is a lot less runny and they come out looking more like cream puffs (instead of perfectly round, hollow mounds). I was able to slice them in half and fill them with the (amazing!) cream, and I thought they looked much better (light and fluffy too!). I also doubled the recipie and made one batch with vanilla and the other with chocolate. I drizzled some of them with melted chocolate too :)
 My boss hates cream puffs, and she LOVED these~ They dissapeared quickly! FANTASTIC and simple recipie :)

Absolutely fantastic!!! I even found that the creamy filling works well in a Boston Cream pie, Banana Cream pie, and Coconut Cream pie...I will also make them using Chocolate pudding instead of the Vanilla for a twist...What an impressive creation!!!

This Recipe was really good.  My mother has a recipe very similar.  I wanted to compare the 
two recipes.  The difference in my mother's recipe is 1 teaspoon salt instead of 1/2 teaspoon
and 5 eggs instead of 4.  My mothers turn out a little puffier and bigger.  Other than 
that this is also a great recipe.

Wonderful! Had no problem with eggs “cooking” when beating them into flour mixture. Puffs were light and airy, and should be eaten sooner rather than later because they do get a bit stale after a couple of days.

Ingredients for the puffs and filling are spot on. The mixing, apropos if you ensure dough cooled prior to adding eggs (warm to touch is cool enough, hot will cook your eggs). Puff recipe hearkens back to good ole Fannie Farmer cookbook. Butter an absolute must, in puffs and in pie crust; no shortening substitute whenever possible. Adjust bake temp and time, gradual cool in a warm oven, you're golden. Mom was shocked the filling wasn't scratch custard, thick, vanilla, sweet goodness I halved, so ha! Made whipped vanilla cream for other half, light airy bites of fluff. Withheld star for limited bake instructions.

This recipe may be delicious but the directions are terrible. The pastry cream did not set up so we didn’t even try the dough. I admit, I was lazy and didn’t feel like reading a bunch of comments so I just printed and made. Spoiler alert, I am not eating cream puffs right now.

READ REVIEWS FIRST! I guess I didn’t read enough of them. Mine did not rise either. I’ve made cream puffs before with a family recipe (that I didn’t have with me at the time) and had no problem with them. Does the size of the eggs have anything to do with it? Mine were very large eggs. The pudding mixture is good but no mention of how long to beat it. With the whipping cream you must watch that it doesn’t start to curdle and turn to butter and mine almost did. Not sure what to do with everything now

Recipe is a bit lacking. 
Watching the video , I wonder how that little bit of lightly stirring  the filling ingredients with a little whisk makes a pudding-like filling. Just to make regular instant pudding, you have to beat the milk and pudding mix vigorously for 2 min. I would find taking the video seriously would end up with  grainy pudding mix in bottom  and liquid dairy on top.  I'd have to know about that filling thing before I try it. You don't get pudding by stirring milk and cream into mix and putting it into fridge.

I haven’t made cream puffs since 7th grade Home ec class. My son wanted to try them so used this recipe. They were so incredibly good! Used coconut pudding instead of vanilla. Also used parchment paper as someone mentioned they might burn on the bottom otherwise. Excellent recipe!

I used a traditional ok whipped cream filling.  I will use this recipe again with a tablespoon each of added vanilla and sugar.

I made it exactly as the recipe was written. My one change is that I poked a tiny hole into the side of each puff, once I removed them from the oven, to allow the steam to escape as was suggested by another review.

I did fill one puff using a pastry bag but I prefer more of the filling inside, so I sliced the top third off and filled them using a spoon. There is plenty of the filling to do this for all 36. However, I filled one dozen and stored the other 24 to fill at a later time.

I used Smuckers sundae chocolate to drizzle on top. Perfection!

I made these as specified and they came out delicious. My family ate them all up as soon as I finished stuffing the vanilla cream in them lol. I would definitely do them again but would double up the recipe & add this time the chocolate 
on top. They did not last long enough to add the chocolate. Thanks for the recipe.

I haven’t had cream puffs since my father made them years ago.  These are awesome and so simple to make.  The only change I made was instead of heavy cream with one cup of milk, I used 3 cups of half n half and they were wonderful! My husband loved them as well!

7 oz of pudding mix creates a solid glob of pudding and that is way too rich. The instructions also weren't clear on letting the flour mixture continue heating to dry out the dough.

I have made this recipe dozens of times, and my creampuffs have always turned out perfectly. I don’t understand why some people have had failures! I don’t think they read directions very carefully. I wouldn’t change anything except for pricking a hole in the puffs as soon as I take them out of the oven. My puffs haven’t really deflated, but I’m going to try pricking them the next time I make them just to see what the difference will be.  I do have a suggestion for ease with filling the puffs if you are going to pipe the cream using a pastry bag. I find that slicing a little bit through the top with a bread knife works really well but don’t slice all the way across. This creates a little flap and makes it easier to fill the creampuffs. The flap will adhere to the cream inside the puff, and makes the end result look fabulous.

Recipes was simple and easy for my 8yo daughter to make nearly on her own. They turned out beautiful, tasty, and perfect!  However, there was 2 cups of custard left over which we found ways to repurpose.

I made one batch and they were gone in under an hour! I have a lot of people in my family and they all loved it! I did mix the dough ball with an electric mixer to cool it before adding the eggs. I made it once without cooling the dough and the eggs cooked :(  I also added vanilla and 1tsp sugar to the dough as suggested by others. I've made it in the past with chocolate pudding and people preferred the vanilla. SO GOOD.

The recipe was easy to follow, but the cream puffs came out flat and overbaked on the bottom. Unlike most cream puff recipes there was no change in temperature part way through to make sure they puff and then bake through completely. The taste and texture was alright.

Poor directions for the pastry, doomed to failure if you don't already know how to make cream puffs. It omits the fact that you must cook the moisture out of the dough and then slightly cool it before beating in the eggs. Please don't continue to rate this highly and mislead some unfortunate cook who will meet with failure if  the star rating is taken at face value. There are correct recipes out there on this site; go give them 5 stars.

Another fantastic recipe that  I use at the bake shop I work at. I can not keep these on the shelves. I sell completely out ever time I make them. I am asked often when will there be more. I use this recipe to make Eclairs also. It's easy to prepare, and the filling is rich and delicious.

The dough part of the cream puffs, tasted and smelled really eggy so I would recommend only 3 eggs instead of 4. I also poked holes in the dough part 5 minuted before they were done cooking and they stayed puffy. Besides that is was a pretty good recipe, one i'll probably make again.

The base recipe works very well. As others suggested, I added about a teaspoon each of sugar and vanilla. For my filling, I added two teaspoons of instant coffee crystals. It made a rich vanilla flavor with a slight coffee zing. I used whipped chocolate frosting for the top. Instant hit with my family. It was a winner on the first try!

Loved, loved, loved them. I made 5 batches it was so easy. I made various fillings using different kinds of pudding mixes and they were all delicious.

The cream for this recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS. My number one issue when people make recipes is they add to/change the recipe, and they then complain when the original recipe doesnt work.... I followed this one and tried my dough - it was a little bland before I baking, so I added a smidgen of sugar and vanilla. I also like to whip my filling(specifically when I use heavy cream) with my hand mixer so that the heavy cream sets up a little before chilling! 

I think my only gripe is that there isn't anything that says how many this recipe makes/the actual serving size. Other than that, quick and yummy!

I am an amateur baker and found this recipe to not only taste delicious but also look fabulous!  I read many of the reviews and did poke a hole in them when done baking but they still collapsed. It didn't seem to matter because once I filled them (I cut the top about 3/4 around) and drizzled chocolate over them, they looked great!  I added all 4 eggs at once and did add a splash of vanilla.  Will definitely make these again!

This was quick and easy - but I disagree on the oven temp.  First batch burned on the bottom.  2nd Batch - I went down to 375 - and they were "good" for quick and easy - but not great pastry for an event/party.

This is an awesome recipe! For the puffs it is the old recipe from way back and doesn’t need altered! Plan basic puff that is good for sweet or savory! The eggs are essential for it to be a true puff. Try it the way the recipe is wrote before doing all these changes as others have done! The filling is new to me, but I wanted to try it as printed. It is wonderful! Do not leave out the heavy cream it gives it such a great body and sets well! Thank you for sharing this recipe! I had long ago lost my grandmas recipe when our home burnt.

I made the recipe as it was written and they turned out perfect. The one thing I did that wasn't listed was poke a hole in them with a toothpick when they came out of the oven. Will definitely make again.

Try 425 for 15 minutes and 350 for 20 minutes. Pastry comes out perfectly golden  and not burnt. I have made these before but never using shortening always butter. I think this is the magic ingredient! The crust is crispy and hollow inside.

I just made the shells.  They stuck to the pan pretty badly.  By the time I got them off, they had holes in the bottom.  So, the holes I poked in the top were useless.  They still look nice from the top.  Next time I will bake them on parchment paper.

I made 2 batches. The first one I added vanilla. I liked the flavor, but they fell and were not puffy. I’m not sure if it was the vanilla or if they needed to cook a little more. They still tasted yummy, but the texture was off. 
The second batch I made exactly as recipe said. They came out PERFECT!  I didn’t miss the vanilla flavor so I will not use vanilla again. 
***The dough needs to cool to warm before adding eggs. The eggs will cook if it’s too hot and you’ll have to start all over. **

This recipe was great! I read the review comments and tweaked it a bit. I let the dough cool a little bit before I added the eggs. I also noticed my second batch was more hollow then my first probably because the dough sat for 25 minutes. I will definitely let it sit a bit longer before baking next time. They taste great!

I will definitely make this again.  It came out great.  The cream puffs were fluffy and golden, and my guests were beside themselves.  I would, when I do it again - and I will - change the filling a little.  The instant pudding was great, but I think I will only add some of the cream in the beginning, then whip the rest and fold it in at the end.  As it was, it was a little dense.  Not that my guests minded in the least!

These came out really wonderful.   I did sub the Heavy cream for Half/Half.   After removing the puff pastry from the stove top I let it sit to cool slightly (just below 125 degrees reading on thermometer) before adding the eggs, one at a time, then I added 1 tsp. Vanilla to the pastry mix.  Used a cookie scoop and baked 425 for 15 mins then reduced oven to 350 and baked another 20 mins till golden.   These received rave reviews from at the family gathering last weekend.  Thanks for posting this wonderfully quick and easy recipe.

I loved this recipe! The cream puffs looked store bought, and I made a double batch to freeze. I found that 22-23 minutes is perfect to cook them. I used a completely different cream though.. vanilla pudding is a little sweet. Instead I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup white sugar. If you don't have time to beat it for a long time to get it stiff, add a little cream cheese for a cheesecakey cream puff

Puffed well and stayed dry (we took the advice of poking a hole in them right when they came out of the oven) . The bottoms burned though, both at 425 and 400 degrees, in the oven for about 18 minutes.

Two positive stars for the filling but the puffs were terrible. I've never made cream puffs with water before and these were super runny. They looked like pancake batter. The bottoms were too thin and scraped off when taking them off the pan so you couldn't even put the cream inside them.

These came out perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of I ended up baking them for 30 min because the centers were still gooey.  That’s probably just my oven or me peeking too much and letting the heat out.  Adding powdered sugar to the top really kicks these up a notch.

I scoured the reviews for tips, then just made these for the first time and they turned out pretty great!  Here are some of the changes I made thanks to those great reviews!  

I used extra large eggs, so I only used 3 in the batter.  I also added 1Tbs of vanilla and 1 Tbs of sugar.  I only put a few in to bake initially as testers.  I also used parchment paper.  I was afraid the amount of time set to bake was too much and afraid they'd burn. Don't be afraid - they didn't, an honestly they become so much better (drier, puffier) with full baking time.  After 20 mins of baking I took them out and poked each with a toothpick, then returned to bake for the remainder of time.  I then let then fully cool before putting into containers for transport.

I put the ingredients for the filling in a quart-sized Ziploc bag (use a gallon-sized as the quart did not allow for much room to manipulate the ingredients) and mixed as someone had mentioned.  This was great for a few reasons!  One - less mess! Two - easy transport! I brought the cream puffs with me and filled them at their final destination because I wasn't sure if the would get soggy if I did them beforehand, and Three - I just cut one little corner off and instantly had a pastry bag to fill each puff.

I also made a chocolate glaze.  Use  equal amounts of dark chocolate chips and heavy cream (I only had half and half and that worked perfectly!) I used 3 oz of each.  Heat the cream on the stove till it starts to bubble, then pour o

I've done this recipe numerous times and all are very successful. I read previous comments and I did poke puffs with a toothpick 5 minutes before baking completed. I also left them in the cracked open oven for cool down. 

I've changed up the creamy center by using different flavors. Banana pudding is by far my guests favorites. Drizzled with chocolate for an added treat!

This recipe is amazing! It takes a couple of tries to get right, but once you do, it's absolutely delicious. The outer shell is crispy and buttery, and the inside is  sugary and sweet. Personally, I enjoy a strong vanilla flavor for my cream, so I use just about a teaspoon more vanilla extract than the recipe suggests. The only problem is that the directions needed to be a bit more specific; I had to read them several times to understand what they were trying to say. Otherwise, this is an easy and mouth-watering recipe for mediocre bakers.

I made the cream puffs as the recipe stated and they did not puff in the oven. They looked like cookies. I'm sure, as all the other comments state, that if you alter the recipe a little or add in certain tips that they will turn out amazing, but as is, the recipe is lacking.

4.5 stars for this recipe. I had been looking for an excuse to make a choux pastry so this was my perfect opportunity. The cream puffs are delicious and it would be 5 stars if not for a few minor issues with the directions. A choux pastry is odd in that it is cooked and not sweet. As soon as the water and butter boil you should remove it from the heat to add the flour and salt. Then as soon as the ball forms take it to your other bowl and beat it for a few minutes to cool it. Follow the directions about adding the eggs one at a time, room temperature eggs work best for baking. Choux pastry rises very high and fast in the oven, and that is why a short bake time with a high heat is necessary. As soon as they are out of the oven poke them with a  knife or tooth pick to allow steam to escape. Let cool completely before adding the cream. To cut down on clean up I made the cream in a gallon ziplock bag. I put all the ingredients straight into the bag and mixed it that way. I did had a splash of vanilla extract to the cream and it's delicious. Please remember to keep these refrigerated if you are not serving them immediately. A great recipe that will go over well at parties.

I made 4 batches of these cream puffs for under privileged teenagers, they never had these before but it was a WOW.  There were only 24 children and there was none to bring home.  I did add a tablespoon of sugar to the base of the cream puff, recommended from others and I also cooked them 10 min on 425 and then lowered it to 350 for 15 min. more, they came out perfect.

These Cream Puffs turned out AMAZING!  Absolutely delicious!!  Followed some of the other reviewer's tips about mixing the egg immediately and blending quickly.  I added vanilla extract as well.  Cooked for exactly 20 minutes, poked a whole in each cream puff and set them out to cool.  Filled with the vanilla pudding mix and drizzled chocolate on them!!  Sinfully delicious!!  Will definitely make them again!

Great and easy recipe! Thanks for posting! I made these a few days ago and they came out excellent. I will definitely be making these again. Mommy From Seattle gave the best tips as follows: No need to cool dough and add all 4 eggs at once. Also no need to cool cream puffs to "dry" them out! Just pierce them with a tooth pick at 20 minutes and they won't collapse.

HELP! I made these and they came out of the oven almost entirely flat. I am sure it is something I did, not the recipe.  So, these are the two things I did differently- When stirring in the flour and salt it did not form a big ball,  just a bunch of little ones so I added more flour, about 1/4 cup. Then,  I added a tsp of vanilla directly to the eggs before adding them to the dough.  Any ideas about what I might have done wrong?  should I have mounded them up more on the baking tray? I'm so sad...I was going to put in lemon cream filling for a surprise  for my husband.

I'll give this 5 stars but only because of how easy these really were to make.  It helped a lot reading all of the tips from other reviewers.  Had I not known about "drying" these out they may not have been so successful.  I did change the recipe for the filling a little bit by using chocolate pudding made with heavy cream and milk and also added 1/2 tsp. each of almond extract and vanilla extract to the shell mixture for more of a "pastry flavor".  These were well received and my daughter would now prefer these for her birthday treat from now on.

My puffs did fall. Next time I will put a whole in side so steam can escape. My cream was a bit heavy. Does anyone know if I am mixing it too long? Please, any suggestions are appreciated

Loved this recipe--same recipe (for the dough) as the one in my first Betty Crocker Cookbook which I have used for many years. My only tip would be to not fill the puffs until right before serving, as the custard or pudding tends to make the dough soggy when the cream puffs are stored in the refrigerator.

Very disappointing instructions.  I was in a hurry to bake something fun with my grandchildren and did not read the reviews, so I ended up with flat puffs!  The kids did't like the smell of all the eggs - should have put vanilla  in the puffs.

I made these puffs exactly as the recipe was written and they were delicious!  I put the cream filling in a ziplock sandwich bag, cut the tip off one corner and squeezed the cream in the puffs that way, which worked just fine. Very simple to make, with minimal ingredients. Will definitely make them again.

Used different filling, but the puffs were good.  I think it takes some practice to make these the right size and to be able to fill them the way they are suppose to be. Will be making again.

It was great.  Made this recipe first, then did one with my Puff Pastry recipe and my cream for comparison.   This was very close to mine.  I loved their creme filing.

Cream puffs are a childhood memory of baking with my mom.  I had not made them in years and after using this recipe, I will make them more often.  They are so easy to make and impressively delicious!  If you want the "bite size" then do make  24.  I made them bigger so only made 12.  In addition to the Vanilla filling, I also made some fresh homemade whip cream.  After baking them and letting them cool, using a serrated knife, cut the "top" off (maybe the top 1/4 of it). Set the top aside.  Gently, using the tip of a knife, scrape out the soft dough inside creating a cavity for the pudding. (Be careful not to scrape out too much so that it gets too thin as it still needs to hold the filling.)
With a spoon or piping bag, I filled the bottom with the pudding filling. (The filling recipe with the instant vanilla pudding worked and tasted great).  I then topped it off with a big spoon full of whip cream, put the "top" on and sprinkled the whole thing with powdered sugar.  Excellent!

This is a very easy recipe. First time ever making cream puffs. Instead of the pudding cream I made a cream cheese filling with some salted caramel hot cocoa melting chips. Also I added a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the dough while it cooked in the pot. Also it doesn't say it in the instructions but you need to beat the dough with a paddle attachment till the dough is cool before adding eggs in. These came out excellent and I will be making them again.

Great filling, but puffs cooked on the outside not on the inside,  if I left them in any longer they would burn. Next time I would reevaluate the baking process.

The filling was amazing! I added an extra teaspoon vanilla for more taste. The pastry wasn't tasty at all.  It whipped up good and was beautiful and very easy to fill, it just lacked flavor.  I do believe next time I will add some sugar to the dough and see how that works. I even sprinkled w confectioners sugar and it didn't help. I should have read the reviews before trying this recipe.

Terrific recipe.  Easy & good.  Tastes like the Amish pastries my Pennsylvania-born husband grew up with!  I do agree with the suggestions in the reviews.   Don't let this recipe scare you.  It really is super easy.  I forgot to beat the dough as much as you were supposed to before putting in the eggs, and almost ditched the whole batter, but decided to bake them anyway & they were perfect!  Agree with Erin - Mommy in Seattle's is the best review to follow.

This is the same cream puff recipe my grandmother used to make. However, instead of using instant pudding mix, I made a custard filling from scratch. Here is the recipe:

You need to watch the cream puffs after the 17 minute mark...a minute or two more and they can burn or get too golden and then too tough.  A really excellent recipe.  Got wonderful reviews from my demanding Italian family who loves fine food.  I followed the puff recipe exactly and got golden, light puffs.  I did let the ball mixture cool for 5-10 minutes in the pot before moving it to a mixing bowl.  Wait until dough absorbs each egg and comes together before adding the next egg.  There should be no wetness left in the dough before you spoon them out in pans.  For the filling:I had a cup of leftover fresh whipped cream from another recipe.  I folded about a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar into the whip cream.  Instead of adding two cups of milk to the instant chocolate pudding mix, I added one cup of milk, whisked it and then folded in this whip cream mixture.  Made a lovely light mousse like texture.  I was in a rush and needed a gourmet feel without a lot of time...did the trick...highly recommend this alternative for a dessert puff.

Wow, that was wayyyy easier than I thought!  I filled mines with egg custard and with matcha flavored egg custard.  This is a great addition to my desserts to share with friends and family functions.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

Not impressed. I am not a chef, just a person interested in making cream puffs. The puff part deflated even though I DID poke a hole in them. They were WAY too eggy tasting also. The cream part is easy. If you can't get them too stay fluffy, then more directions are needed.

Even Though I scaled back on the Eggs to just 3, and added a shake of vanilla to it, i did what  a lot of other users did, and poked a hole in each one towards the end of the baking process, helps a lot :)   This is my go to quick, yummy dessert when I do not have a lot of time, always a winner..

I made these yesterday but added a teaspoon of vanilla to the water giving it a nice flavor.  Might add a little more next time.  When I baked mine I baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes then shut off the oven, opened the door slightly and let the pastries set in the warm oven about 7-8 minutes longer to help dry them out but not over bake them.  They were crisp, not soggy.  I made cheesecake pudding with the whipped cream in it and also some chocolate.  I made some with both the cheesecake and the chocolate in one cream puff - everyone liked the flavor combination.  These would be great with a chicken salad in them also but without the vanilla.

So, they were pretty good, but if you look at my previous review, they were soggy and flat if you did it exactly like the recipe said. I would recommend when they are done baking, poke a hole through with a toothpick. Also unless you like extremely rich cream puff cream, don't put much, maybe like a teaspoon depending on the size. Overall, they were really good but very flat and cream was really strong (that's why it was four stars) and I'm a pretty good cook so that's also why I give it four stars because the recipe wasn't very clear. If I could give it 3.5 I would. But still pretty good, but frustrating to make and they were flat and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE save yourself some time and put them on parchment paper. The clean up is bad if you don't. Enjoy!

Excellent choux pastry and filling!  I love this filling much more than just filling them full of whipping cream! Here are some very helpful hints to get your choux pasty to rise/puff!  1 - Always, always, always use "Bread Flour". It has more glutton and will react better with the eggs. 2 - Let the mixture cool completely before adding the eggs or your puffs  will turn out flat. 3 - Never grease or oil the pan. Doing so will cause the pastry dough to spread outwards instead of upwards (Use parchment paper). 4 - Don't  make the diameter larger than 2 inches.  5 - Spray a little water over the pastry dough and pan before popping it in the oven. 6 - Poke a little hole with a knife in each pastry 5 minutes before you take them out of the oven to let the steam escape. Don't poke the hole in the top.

Love this recipe! This is the second time I've made them. Followed the recipe as written but lowered temp of oven to 400 and baked them for ten minutes longer, checking on them towards the end every few minutes to make sure all moisture was gone.  Taking them out too early will cause them to fall as they cool even if you poke a whole in them. With the extra time them came out golden brown and dried perfectly.  This time I poked a hole in the bottom of them and pipped in the pastry cream.

This recipe was 100% too eggy. It was all you could taste. Their was absolutely no sweetness. Overall very disappointing. I had to add so many more things to this cream puff to make it edible.

Oh my goodness, this is the best and easiest recipe I have ever found and used for cream puffs! Everyone loves them and they are simply irresistible. If you wanted to, you could easily change up the flavour of te custard by switching out pudding flavours.

This recipe is fantastic.  Dough baked up perfectly.  When the puffs are cooked, turn off the oven and prop the oven door open.  Leave the puffs in the oven until they are cooled completely.

I have made this recipe numerous times and have followed it exactly as instructed except for one minor tweak.  As soon as the puffs are out of the oven, I use a serrated knife and partially split them like a clam.  This will allow the steam to escape and cool.  These have been a hit whenever I make them!!  No need to cool anything...instead of foil I used parchment paper!

This was an easy recipe & thanks to other reviewers I did make adjustments to adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to puff mixture. Make sure you let your eggs get to room temp (most people know this but as I am new to baking I always like to share that tip for those who are new with me ) I baked at 425• for 11 min then reduced heat to 350• for additional 25 min the last five min I poked a hole to let steam escape and they came out perfect :) This was my first attempt at cream puffs and they turned out pretty good I think. Also I topped them off with some Torenti Chocolate sauce delic ;)

These were pretty good cream puffs. 
But they cam e out a bit raw. I baked them for forty minutes. 
They still remained raw on the inside. 
When I put them in the refrigerator, the inside became a little more solid and tasted better. 
I used this exact recipe to make eclairs.
The inside was solid.  
If this was an eclair, I would give it a five star rating. 
But it is not.

This was perfect. One thing I would add to the reviews is that I did not know what to expect as far as how big they would get while baking. I made dollops of dough about a tablespoon each and spaced them out about 2 inches I think. They did get bigger in the oven, but mostly puffed up and not out. Filling them was another issue. I made the pudding in a zip lock bag as one person suggested and then just cut the corner, which worked great. I'm still trying to gauge how much filling to put in each cream puff as it is hard to tell how full it is. Practice makes perfect!

I've always made French cream puffs since I was little.  I made ZERO alterations to this recipe.  I don't think the shells need extra salt or sugar... They're meant to be light, however I think the American taste bud tends to prefer sweeter, so add if you want, but true French cream puffs are usually not sweet.  I like the lightness of this recipe, the cream is nice and smooth.  Although there is way too much cream left over... I used only half of my cream.  My shells did not fall or get soggy at all, but I live in a very dry climate, I simply let them sit on a cooling rack before filling.

My seven year old son and I made this recipe for the very first time as is. I really didn't notice the comments until now, which prompted me to post. My shell turned out so great, not too eggy, they did not deflate and they were just beautiful. The filling was just so great, we couldn't stop eating them. I did add whipped cream on top on some from the left over heavy cream.

5 star delicious! Made 3 batches for Christmas this year and they turned out great! I filled them with vanilla, chocolate and cookies and cream instant pudding.. so good! One BIG mistake, for my last party I stored them in big ziploc bags and they lost their crunch :/ I did follow the advice of others and poked the cream puffs with a toothpick and none collapsed. Thanks for sharing!!

I made one regular batch and one batch with gluten free all purpose flour and they both came out great!  I whipped up some cream and folded it in with the vanilla pudding for the filling.  It is scrumptious!  I used the advise found in some of the other posts and dumped all 4 eggs in at once, and stabbed a small hole after 20 minutes baking.

I made this recipe EXACTLY how it says, & everything turned out beautifully. I didn't poke a hole in it until I filled them either, & they were puffed & appropriately dry in the inside. For all those who are doing different things, it's completely unnecessary. This recipe was perfect as is!

I have made these many, many times with no problems. The recipe is over a century old. If you follow directions and cook all the way through, they should be light and airy and not "eggy".

I didn't care for the puffs.  And the filling was just okay.

I loved this recipe! I found out it was my father-in-law's favorite treat as a kid and made a whole batch for him. It was nice to see him light up. He even let us keep a few and they were worth every bite. Yum!

I found this really easy to make.  I used the vanilla pudding mix but when filling the individual puffs, I put in a spoonful of Cool Whip in the top hollow and a spoonful of pudding in the lower hollow.  Sprinkle powdered sugar on top.  They don't last long at my house.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. One tip is to not under bake them, even if they look golden brown, don't pull them from the oven early. I had two trays and second one was slightly eggy on the inside because I didn't bake them long enough. I also turned off the oven and let the puffs sit with the oven door ajar for 15 minutes. They didn't fall and we're perfect. Impressive and easy dessert.

I have made this recipe without changing it for years and always turns out great. I did read the comments and I decided to add a bit of vanilla to the dough this time. It does make it taste even better. I also use the pampered chef tool to fill the puffs. I also add powdered sugar and chocolate sauce drizzle on the top.

If you read the other reviews, this is a great recipe. The first time I made it, the puffs were soggy because I didn't poke a hole in it. But if you remember to poke the hole then put the puffs back into the oven, they come out great.

I made the custard using Pastry Cream recipe and then followed the video on how to make the cream puffs. Except after the first ten minutes at 425 degrees, I reduced the oven temperature to 350 and baked the pastry for another 20 minutes. Finally, following another recipe instructions, I turned the oven off but left the pastry in it with the door opened a crack until they were cool. I also had some leftover whipping cream which I whipped up with a bit of icing sugar and put on top of the cream. Yumm!

After reducing 1 egg and making a toothpick hole after the puffs baking for 20 minutes, I found this recipe to be quite delightful with the pastry cream/filling recipe (also on allrecipes). Thanks for the recipe! :-)

Mine turned out pretty good on my first attempt! I did have the same issue as others where they are slightly eggy. Next time I will let the dough cool a bit before adding egg (I don't own a stand mixer). I didn't have a problem with them sticking at all - if you do, then your pan must no longer be non-stick. Mine came out with a flattened bottom, which was perfect because I was able to saw it off neatly with a serrated knife, fill, and reattach the bottom. I'll be making these again and filling with whipped cream for a "true" cream puff, though the vanilla pudding with a dash of vanilla extract was nice too.

This recipe was so simple and came out absolutely perfect! I used a ready made cream cheese pie filling for my filling, and dusted the top with powdered sugar. I measured them out onto the pan a little bit larger, but there were no complaints! I wonder if I could freeze them?

Wonderful and easily done. I would add that the insides need to be pulled out before adding filling. It takes away the egg taste, Sprinkle the tops with icing sugar before serving!

I did make this recipe.  They were good, but would have been better if the filling was sweeter.  The next time I make them, I will sweeten my whip cream.  I made the recipe whipping one batch of whip cream, the filling was thick and stiff.  The other batch,  I just mixed the ingredients all together, it was runnier and a little messy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with me.

Made this for the holidays and came out fantastic. I used the toothpick trick to dry 'em out. It was hard to fill them (very messy) and the filling I used was different: 1 stick butter/margarine, 8 oz cream cheese, 2 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract all blended together. It was DIVINE.

Learned long ago to always cook puffs until no moisture bubbles on the outside.  Look really close at end of cooking time you will see them if there.  Prevents sage.  Pudding was excellent!  thank you

These were delicious and got rave reviews. The only change I made was to use French vanilla instant pudding instead of plain. I most definitely will make these again.

the directions were terrible!! They said to combine the pudding mix with the milk and heavy whipping cream, but this never turned into pudding; it stayed in liquid form. This was not all that was wrong. The part where the dough was supposed to be combined with the eggs after the dough boiled was a mess. The eggs cooked and therefore made the outcome horrible. Also, when the eggs did combine, it was just a liquid, soupy mix.

Agree, remember to poke a hole when they come out of the oven to let the steam out.  Otherwise I followed the pastry recipe and it was good.  I lightened up the recipe though by using sugar free pudding, 2% milk and fat free cool whip to make the filling lighter.  They hit the spot.

This recipe was so easy never knew I could make cream puffs that quick. If you like cream puffs you must try this recipe people won't believe you made them they will think you bought them from a bakery.

These Turned out Wonderful Due to my own Tweaks! I tried my first Batch as stated in the recipe and didnt turn out well they were not completly done! so I baked them for the first 15min at 425 then baked them another 20min at 375 Perfect!!! and for the filling i added about 4oz of cream cheese! with my changes they are Fantastic!!!

Made these EXACTLY as they suggest except I made them kind of huge.  I yielded about 13. THEY CAME OUT PERFECT!!!  Make sure your oven is heated up.  I baked them for 23 minutes and had about 5 on a cookie sheet. Used a sil pat.  I did not put vanilla in. My fiance doesn't care for desserts, but these certainly had him reconsidering.

So easy and such a light dessert. I used regular vanilla pudding. Then added about 8 oz of cool whip which lightens it up. I served it with berries. It was well liked by my guests who asked for seconds.

This was a very simple and very easy recipe! One thing I did differently however was changing the amount of eggs to 3 instead of the 4 eggs. It's still perfectly good! You don't necessarily have to mix all the eggs one by one, since it's the same, but it'll be easier to mix everything. 

Then when you're done baking it, poke holes into the side, but I didn't find that necessary since mine were firm and weren't going to sag, but maybe because I poked holes into it. But yes, poke holes into just to make sure. This was a great recipe and I will be coming back here more often to make some more!

I usually read reviews before i make a recipe on here, but this time I just followed the recipe exactly, and they came out PERFECT! I baked mine for about 22 minutes on the top rack and they were perfect. No soggy shells here.  I put the filling in a ziplock bag and snipped a corner off, then delicately cut the tops off my shells, the insides are soft enough to just squeeze the filling right in, replace the tops and I drizzle some melted cocolate on top.  As far as adding the eggs,  i took the batter from the pot to a separate bowl like it said, I used a wooden spoon like it suggested, and I added one egg at a time. At 1st it makes the batter act strange and separate, but keep mixing, it gets a little drier and elastic like. I did not wait for anything to cool before adding my eggs, and they did not cook like some said happened to them. My family loved them!!!

Fantastic results.  I used chocolate pudding and grandkids loved them.  Also used the review from MommyFromSeattle and it made it even easier to make.  Going to try the vanilla pudding next and use almond extract that Mandy told us about and maybe a little touch of sugar in the puff for just a hint of sweetness.  Small ice cream scoop also works to keep even portions.  Just love all the reviews.  I can pick and choose which ones I want to try.  Makes baking treats an adventure.

I read the reviews and actually didn't need to puncture the puffs.  May be an oven dependent hint-- but I was grateful for the help.  For the filling though I used one package of vanilla pudding and made one package of dark chocolate.  I used only 2 cups of heavy whipping cream for filling per flavor.  Holy Wow.... Couldn't decide which ones we loved most.  I didn't pipe filling, just made slit and filled--- they puffed up beautifully.    I did have to scratch first batch because I didn't "ball" the flour in the saucepan with water and butter first.   No shortcuts !!  Elegant and wonderful dessert without a lot of work.   Made everything day before.  Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with chocolate sauce.   Think I will drizzle the dark chocolate fillings with raspberry sauce next time.   This will be my go-to dessert.

can this get any simpler? so few ingredients, even fewer steps, and barely any clean up. after 22 minutes my puffs looked perfect, but i was afraid they might sag due to other reviews, so i just poked a hole with a toothpick. super simple and look amazing.

This review is for the "puff" part of the cream puff. For the filling, I made my own stabilized whipped cream using unflavored gelatin to fill them. This is a great, easy, fool-proof recipe! They have that wonderful (slightly eggy/chewy) cream puff texture and are the perfect vehicle to get that whipped cream into your belly. I don't recall exactly how many this made, but it was nowhere near the 25 that the recipe states.

This recipe is great again like others I added my own little twist. I kinda mashed this recipe and one of the comments from another user together. I added a little more salt, a tablespoon on sugar and more vanilla just like the other viewer. I do believe though you need a stand mixer to make these. I made them by hand with my little one the first time and they were ok. The second, third etc times we made them we used the stand mixer and it made quite the difference. With any recipes on here you have to take them with a grain of salt (mind the pun) love this site.

I've made these three times.

The first time, they were perfect, so I'm chalking the second and third time (both yesterday) to user error.

Both batches burned and set off the smoke alarms in my house at about the 18-minute mark! If you closely look at the photograph on the recipe, the peaks and bottom look charred also. LOL

In any case, my guests and I devoured the extremely toasty-bottomed 2nd batch drizzled with chocolate.

I used only 3 eggs to pretend I was being health conscious. =)

I will definitely use this recipe again, despite my preference for homemade and natural all the way (no preservatives, et cetera, which would mean no pudding mix--easily remedied), because it is such a hit, even burned. Ha!

Took the advice in the comments and this recipe has turned out perfect every time.  I too like to use whip cream for the filling instead of pudding.  Also made them with chocolate flavored whip cream and grated chocolate on top.

What happened?? When I made the cream puff on top of the stove..it just curdeled with the flour. It never came into a ball? How long should I be stirring on the heat??

These turned out very nice... i took the reviewers advice and poked a whole in them when they are done... the trick is to do it at the exact right time wait too long they burn do it too soon they collapse... next time i will try adding vanilla and a little sugar... the filling is what truely makes these taste good... high in calories with the whipping cream but also high in taste... very fun to make

Yum, yum, yum!! These were so good and so easy to make! I only used 3 eggs, to eliminate an eggy taste. And I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the dough and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.. YUM!

The inside tastes like cake batter.  I had to throw out the cream part because it tasted gross.  The puff part was okay but I think I can find a better recipe for this.  I will not be remaking this one.

These are incredible! Everyone that tries them oohs and aahs over them. They go very quickly. Be careful if you are on a diet, because it is impossible to eat only one. I did add a splash of vanilla and tsp. of sugar to the puff dough after beating in the eggs. I also let the dough cool before beating in the eggs. Heavy cream was expensive so I mixed 1 cup of milk with the boxes of pudding and then mixed in an 8 oz. conatainer of whipped topping.  Thanks for this recipe it's fantastic!

Great recipe. I have a convection oven and found that the puffs were browning a bit too much at 425 degrees, so I lowered the temp to 400 about half way through. I used a pastry bag to pipe out small mounds, and they turned out great. It was easy to simply lift off the top portion of the puff to fill with the cream. This is an impressive dessert that is simple to make, with very basic ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

I used 3 eggs, per one of the recommendations.  The bottoms burned, unfortunately, but the tops were perfect, so I cut off the tops and put two top halves together for one puff.  A fairly easy recipe with lots of wow factor.

Oh my goodness, these were fantastic. I'm about the most beginner-like cook out there, and mine turned out great. I used french vanilla pudding and since I was out of flour I used bread flour. Three words:wow, yum, and delish!

This recipe is my first baking disaster. I followed the instructions and some suggestions, my puffs rose well in the oven, but when I took them from the oven, they fell apart, so I didn't have any idea how to fill this tortilla looking puff with the cream mixture. All I could just put the cream at the top. I can say this recipe is very complicated, expensive and has too much features and suggestions for a mediocre result it gives. The dough itself is a little tasteless, not sweet at all. These proportions produce only 10 puffs, so, if you want to bake these for a large family you must double the recipe. But I think, you can make a good, delicious, festive looking dessert for the money and the time you waste to make these puffs.

I checked out a lot of cream puff recipes but decided to use this one since I had vanilla pudding in the house.  I know the ingredients for cream puffs are all the same so I thought it didn't matter which one I chose.  I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with hard little dense balls with soggy middles. really really bad---but my kids ate the pudding!

Two stars for directions.  Thank you to W for help.  I am an experienced cook, but not with cream puffs.  I did not know that you have to cook the dough on the stove until it pulls away from the sauce pan.  I undercooked on the stove and the puffs collapsed (even with the poked hole) gooey in the middle and too dark on the outside.  I will try again.

fantastic! Was hoping for more of a 'whipped cream' type of filling but it was a custard-like one.  Tasty, too!!

Since the pastry seemed so simple to make, I decided to try it on a whim. I read reviews and poked them as suggested by a few people. They fell flat INSTANTLY, lol. Maybe I poked them too soon.  Well, I didn't make the filling and I never intended to follow THIS recipe for filling, because I prefer the light, not-so-sweet whipped filling. I didn't have the ingredients to make it myself so I used the Reddi-Whip I had handy in my fridge. It was delicious. The whipped cream tasted as processed as I'm sure it is, but that's to be expected until I make it myself. I made them fairly large, and only used 3 eggs. No eggy taste, but it was a little buttery for me.

love this recipe. I filled mine with crab salad-just piped it in with home made pastry bag-cut the corner out of freezer bag-and squirt filling into cooled, sliced cream puffs. I took the cream puffs and filling to an event seperately(kept crab filling in fridge till ready to use) then assembled in about 5 min when ready to serve. Big hit @ church lunch.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making cream puffs. First I have to say these were absolutely delicious! the filling was very thick, perhaps I would pipe it in next time, spooning was messy for me. Second, I doubled the recipe and ended up with only 18, so i must have made these super big? I used the filling recipe for chocolate too, absolutely delicious!!!  I would suggest when making these, you make them the day you need them, i made the puffs the night before, and slit some and left some whole, and they fell and were very soft.. too soft to use. Thanks for the recipe!!! (Oh and I added all eggs at once thanks to the one who suggested that!)

These are perfect as written.  The custard isn't to strong.  Exactly how a great cream puff should taste.

The heck with all you floks that do not like the recipe.  It works GREAT as it is.  Made them for my wife for Valentines day, she loved them I made them on Saturday and here it is Tuesday we still have a few.  The only thing I did not do was to fill the puffs untill we use them.  Boy were they/or should I say they are still good. Thanks.

It is the first time I have made choux pastry and found the recipe given excellent - no added sugar needed as the sweetness is in the filling - which MUST be whipped cream.  I had no problem with moist interiors or having to punch hole in the base or any other adaptation - great as is.  I am passing this info to a young couple who enjoyed my first attempt!  Thanks for being around, I am still learning!!

I used to make cream puffs all the time. Instead pf just pudding for the filing, I  used one pkg. instant pudding and I pkg Dream Whip.Makes a ltiile thicker filling that holds up well.

These came out great...they puffed up like magic!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I only added seven eggs (for a double batch) since I was using extra large eggs.  And, I baked the puffs on parchment paper.  Also, I used chocolate flavored pudding for one batch and cheesecake flavored pudding for the other.  Very yummy!! Got rave reviews!

I wish I wouldn't have been so lazy and would have looked for my mom's recipe for these.  First, use a whisk to mix the eggs in - a wooden spoon just did not work.  Second, use a silpat mat or something.  My cream puffs stuck to the "ungreased cookie sheet" which took the bottoms right off leaving me a boat like shell to fill.  I made mine bigger than recommended and they were DONE before the time was up for the smaller size.  BUT even after all that, once they were filled they did taste good.

Not good... not good at all. The dough fell even though I poked holes in it as was suggested by others. And it is definitely eggy tasting even though I added in sugar and vanilla to the dough mixture. I'll use the cream part of the recipe for cake frosting though b/c I liked the thick texture of it from the heavy cream. But other than that.. just bad. Bad instructions and bad outcome.

I actually only used half of this recipe. I used it to make the cream puff shells. I used another recipe to make the vanilla pastry filling (pastry cream recipe). It came out perfect. I used a silpat mat and baked the shells for 24 minutes.

I followed MommyFromSeattle's suggestions and my cream puffs came out perfect!  These were easy and fast, yet they looked elegant and professional.  The filling was awesome!  Next time I will try a few different fillings and make smaller ones to have as appetizers.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Instead of adding heavy cream, I just made the vanilla with milk. Also, when I took out the puffs, the deflated. But the taste was amazing!

"Mmmmm... These are awesome Mommy, so awesome! Maybe you should make these for Christmas!" - Arianna, 6 Made half recipe since I only had one pudding, but I ended up having lots of filling leftover. I did poke hole immediately after baking and filled right away. So good with banana cream pudding and melted chocolate drizzled on top!

SO delicious! I did notice this is almost the exact same recipe as my faithful Betty Crocker Cookbook, with only some very slight modification, but still - they are great - I'm just not giving any points for originality. For the filling I used 2 pkg pudding, 2 cups milk and 1/2 container of whipped topping and it came out light and delicious without all the calories from heavy cream. I did follow the cooking directions to a T without any modifications and the puffs came out perfect, so I would try that first before following some of the other recommendations.

Another good idea is to fill the creampuffs with ice cream. That's what I did and it tastes great.

I didn't use the filling recipe (I filled them with homemade whipped cream)but the puffs were really good! My whole family raved about them. I used a tablespoon sized scoop and got 38 shells.

They were a bit short and definitely needed some vanilla but very good my first time ever making cream puffs and it was an success!! I was very skeptical about making them though I didn't really know why but my dough didn't form a ball so i just winged it and it was yummy!

The taste was all there...but they fell short in height. There were nothing more than puffy cookies. And I followed the reviews! I poked a hole to let the steam escape in the last few minutes of baking. I let the mixture cool before adding the eggs. And why the heck do you need 2 packs of pudding? I wasn't able to even to use half the pudding in my flat puffs.Well, that was probably because they were flat, making filling with pudding a nightmare. Or why heavy cream for that matter? I used 2% milk, and it was still way rich. Used 3 eggs, that was fine. Must try again, brother loves these. Ok, I'm not going to lie though--these taste fnatastic once frozen...still I want some more height!

I have made these three times now, following the directions as written.  Once plated, it takes about two minutes until they are gone.  A chef friend, who disdains short-cut cooking, loved these.  I refused to give the recipe- he will never guess the filling was instant pudding! Lol!  These are easy and really delicious.  Your friends will think you actually worked on them.

WOW!!  I'm so impressed with this recipe!!  Made 5 batches and not one didn't turn out!!  Took the advise given like to save time add all the eggs at once while dough is on medium speed in the mixer.  Plus, poking a hole on the top when they come out of the oven so they don't deflate is such a good tip!!  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!

I had to add at least an extra 1/2 cup of flour to get the mixture to form a dough.  The result was that the puffs were still good, but maybe not as tender as expected.  I will try again with hopefully better results!

i've made these several times and they always turned out pretty delicious, my boyfriend devours them as soon as i fill the puffs!!  however, when i bake them at my apartment, the oven has an electronic screen showing the temp, the puffs didn't expand very much but when i made them at my mom's house, the oven only has a dial with the temp labeled around it, they expanded with up to 3 inch diameters.  the amount of dough i use is approximately them same per puff and i set it at the same temp so i'm not sure what happened...

A nice recipe, but you do have to note the reviews for things not mentioned in it. I must have done something wrong too, because I had twice as much filling as I did pastries, and the filling came out too buttery in texture and taste for me. My family seemed to like it though; my sister wanted to eat the filling without the puff.

raves from the peanut gallery!   In making the puffs, I don't transfer to mixing bowl.  I add the eggs one at a time to the same pan. Also, poked puffs and left in oven (off)to dry.  I didn't use the filling in this recipe, used FF-Sugar free pudding, vanilla and chocolate.  melted some semi sweet choc. chips w/ tbsp of shortening to drizzle over tops.  excellent!

Wow, I'd forgotten how easy these are to make and with some of the other suggestions I added all the eggs at once and beat for 2-3 minutes.  Spooned onto parchment paper and back for 23 minutes.  They seemed to fall more than I remember them supposed to be but I still cut into them and put the pudding mixture inside.  Dusted them with powdered sugar.  By the way, I used 2 1/2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the cream & milk.  The texture was perfect for the filling.

These are very good!  The pastry is a bit bland, as some have mentioned, but based on the ingredients, I kind-of expected it to.  Maybe next time I'll add a little vanilla or a tablespoon or two of sugar.  I couldn't bring myself to make such a rich filling on a dessert that was just for me, so I used sugar free pudding substituted skim milk for the milk and cream.

Everyone said these were the best cream puffs they ever had they all wanted the recipe. No one could eat just one. I was surprised on how easy they were to make. I froze mine and then set them out to thaw while we ate dinner. Tried one frozen and it had no flavor. Nice recipe to make ahead.

I halved this recipe to try, and never got to fill them because my husband and daughter ate them all!  I have been asked to make a double batch, and plan on making large ones and using them instead of expensive puff pastry shells! I also made these gluten free using a gluten free flour blend!

to make these lighter, i filled them with whipped cream (whipped from heavy whipping cream w/ a tiny bit of sugar).  They were delicious!  Instead of using a piping bag for the pastry, I piped with a plain zip lock sandwich bag with a hole cut in the corner.  I made them by squeezing little puffs about the size of one of those large marbles onto a cookie sheet - the recipe yielded three cookie sheets worth. Then after they cooled, I froze them all and now we will have cream puffs for days!

Very yummy and relatively easy.  It is important to know, however, that the quality of these cream puffs diminishes very quickly.  They are not very good the second day in my opinion.

These turned out very well, but you really must read the comments. I had never made cream puffs before and in the directions it said to bake them on an ungreased pan. After I broke all the cream puffs from scraping them off the pan I saw a comment about how you need to use parchment paper to keep them from sticking. Other than that, before I took them off the pan, they looked amazing and they tasted perfect.

This recipe was awesome.  I did add a little vanilla to the puff and the pudding.  I made it for Vacation Bible School workers one night and they loved them so much I had to make them again the next night.  They're even asking for the recipe.

I liked this recipe, but I found the puffs to be too eggy even after decreasing the number of eggs to three. Granted this is the first time I'm trying to make cream puffs, so perhaps I did something wrong...I did like the cream though! Since I didn't have heavy cream on hand, I substituted slightly less soy milk with 1/4tsp cornstarch. I also served this with some fruit: strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi. Very good--just wish the puffs weren't quite so eggy.

We made these on Friday and have already given out the recipe 5 times.  These look like you've spent hours baking them.  I went ahead and used 1 cup cream/2 cups milk to keep them lighter.

I've always thought cream puffs were extremely difficult to make.  Well, with this recipe even a beginner like myself was able to make a yummy batch. I took the advice of other cook and used 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. I had the first batch deflate so I followed another cook's advice and poked holes (this worked).  Thank you for this recipe an all the inputs!

These were SO easy to make with such an elegant result.  I followed the recommendations of "MommyfromSeattle" and they turned out great.  I made one batch with white chocolate pudding mix and chocolate drizzle and then one batch with vanilla pudding mix and lemon curd whipped in with a powdered sugar spinkle.  Someone even asked if they came from a bakery-what a compliment!

So, this was my first cream puff attempt... and they are awesome!  They looked like something from the bakery!  And they were so easy.  Added a bit of vanilla to the batter, added the eggs all at once and stirred with a wooden spoon til I thought my arm would fall off.  Poked with a toothpick when they came out of the oven... none of them deflated.  Took to my grandma's 80th birthday party... everyone LOVED them.

what beautiful cream puffs!  This is the EASIEST recipe for cream puffs that I have found that actually look beautiful and taste great.  I usually make mine bigger but kept them smaller and they were nice and fluffy.  I had no time to make bavarian cream so I did the pudding mix with the sugar free fat free pudding since my hubby is on a diet.  They were great :)

I love desserts and I love cream puffs. This recipe was easy to make, even for a novice like myself. The only thing was that the filling came out extremely thick and I was unable to pipe the filling into the puffs. Next time I'll try 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups milk.

These were so easy and turned out perfect!  I did add vanilla to the batter and after mixing the flour into the water/butter, I put the mix into my KitcheAid and added all 4 eggs until the mixture was silky.  It made 20 perfectly sized puffs.  I did have some problems with them sticking to the pan, which created holes in the bottoms of some.  I will use parchment paper next time.  Also, I didn't use the filling, but used a super simple vanilla pudding recipe from this site.

These were okay.  I prepared the puffs using some tips from other posters such as adding vanilla to the batter, using fat free/sugar free instant white chocolate pudding for the filling, poking a hole in the side after baking, and drizzling with chocolate.  

Making the puffs could not be any easier and I had none that collapsed or fell.  I thought the filling might be too runny, so I made it with 1 C. skim milk and 1 C. heavy whipping cream and it was great.  The only real problem I have with the puffs is that they definitely taste eggy as some previous posters have noted.  Next time I make these, I may reduce the number of eggs to 1 and use egg whites to make up for the remaining three eggs.

My mother in law loved these and my husband's stepfather said they were better than the Sarah Lee ones they had at home, which I suppose is a pretty decent compliment. :)

These turned out great, but I modified the recipe a bit. Added 1 tsp vanilla extract & 1 tbsp sugar to the batter, and combined the eggs all at once instead of individually. I also filled the puffs with pastry cream instead of pudding. Served with sliced strawberries and powdered sugar. Yum!

Simple and delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great... mine puffed up really big.  I got about 16 big puffs with the recipe.  Only 2 didn't rise as high, or fell a bit while cooling.  I used a ziploc freezer bag to pipe in the filling and drizzled melted chocolate over the tops.  Beautiful and looked great!

Yum!  These turned out delicious!  I actually had my husband buy me a cake decorating bag/kit for Christmas so I can make these again and pipe the filling in instead of cutting them as I had to do the first time.  Everyone loved the final product and I had no problems baking them.  Next time I will try the white chocolate pudding filling some have suggested.  Great recipe.

I love cream puffs. The first time I tried this recipe they didn't all turn out very well. But the second time I baked them at 400 for 35-40 min. and they all turned out great. For the filling I only added one packet of instant pudding and my dad really liked the filling better with just the one packet. Great basic recipe but needed a couple adjustments

These were awesome!! I followed the recipe exactly, except since I didn't have any pudding or heavy creme, I just used whipping creme.  Felt guilty eating them but so good.

This recipe was awesome!
I've used another eclair recipe before but the puffs all deflated.  However THESE ONES DID NOT!
I followed other reviews and poked holes in  my first batch but they deflated :(
I found that they puffed up better without hole-poking.  Also, do not stack them on top of each other while they're cooling.  Silly me.
Thanks for this great recipe

4.5 really.  I used parchment paper on a cookie sheet to bake, which worked really well!  I baked in two rounds: the first was eggy, the second wasn't - with the same batter!  I made the second batch a lot smaller (probably not even heaping TBS full) as I didn't realize exactly how much they would puff up.  I also baked the second batch longer as the best cream puffs I have had have been harder crusted.  I made sure that they were evenly brown on all sides and then took them out of the oven.  I then left them on the pan to cool.  30 minutes or so later, I took them off the pan and filled with cream.  Much better!  I couldn't really taste the egg that was so prominent in the first batch.  I am not sure what the difference was, but if I make these again, I will follow this method again!  Small-ish puffs, longer baking time, and let rest for some time on the sheet.  I also ran the pan under cold water between baking so that it didn't ruin the second batch.  Poking holes to prevent deflating:  Most of the puffs ended up having holes in them anyway, they vented on their own while baking, but I poked a hole in ones that didn't appear to have a hole in them right after I took the tray out of the oven.  I don't think that they needed it though.  As for the eggs, I mixed the dough before adding the eggs to cool it off a bit.  Then I pushed the dough to the side of the big mixing bowl, added all four eggs, and  mixed the dough and eggs quickly.  This seemed to work.  An excellent puddi

Make exactly as stated.  Add 1 tsp. vanilla with eggs. Bake on parchment paper. Use 2 sugar free instant white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  Read other reviews for fillings.

I love to cook and bake but cream puffs always scared me. NO MORE! These were easy and so much fun to make. Very messy but worth it! Shared them and they all raved! Will make these again with no fear! Thanks!

I made this recipe for my husband for Valentine's Day. This was the best cream puff recipe I have ever used. I used my Kitchen Aid which I have never done with any of the previous cream puff recipes and I think it really made a big difference. What a great recipe, many thanks for sharing it!

Like others, I found the puffs were too "eggy"  for me and even the sugar and vanilla did not completely help. Of course some people like that taste and it certainly didn't prevent my husband from gobbling them up. However, to make them more universally appealing, I used half egg whites (2 whites equal a whole egg roughly) and half whole eggs, in addition to the sugar and vanilla. The egginess was gone with no difference in the baking and appearance. Yummy!!!!!!!!

They turned out great!  I followed the recipe but used some tips from another reviewer.  Added all four eggs at once and immediately mixed with hand mixer for two minutes.  Added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  I poked each with a toothpick as soon as I removed from oven.  Family loved them!!

The puff pastries came out really good.  I put the ball mixture in my mixer and mixed it for a while to let it cool off a little and then I added an egg at a time, letting the dough mix well before adding the next egg.  They were excellent.  I made homemade custard to go with the puff pastries, instead of the instant pudding mix.

These were great!  I added 1 TB of sugar to the dough.  I did not poke mine with a toothpick and none collapsed.  I made sure not to handle them at all until they were completely cool, and I made sure they were golden all over and likely to be completely cooked.  I made my filling with coconut pudding & piped it in with a pastry bag.  I think cutting and filling them would have made it quite messy.  I served with a dark chocolate sauce on the side and they were truly the hit of the party.  Oh--and they were super easy & quick to make.

Excellent recipe!  I never thought I'd find one better than Mom's, but I think this is it!  I doubled the dough recipe as I make the cream puffs a little larger.  I also used Hershey's syrup to drizzle on top and sprinkled some confectionary sugar on top.   Brought them work and most were gone by lunch time!   I LOVE these cream puffs.   I bake them until brown on the top; otherwise, if you don't  bake long enough, they will collapse when taken out of oven. I also cut a slit in each after they'd been in the oven for about 20 minutes.

These were very good but I don't think they tasted as good as the frozen ones from the grocery store.  I followed a previous suggestion of using a melon baller to scoop the dough and baked the recommended length of time.  They came out great.  I used a doubled ziploc freezer bag with a decorator tip to pipe the filling in which worked fine.  I topped some with melted semi-sweet choc chips and left some plain.  Everyone loved them but I don't think I will make these again because IMO the frozen pre-made ones are better.

I made these a day before a wedding shower because I would not have had time to do it the day of the shower and they were fabulous.  My husband kept going into the fridge and popping one in his mouth.  I was surprised there were any left for me to take to the shower.  Excellent recipe.

These were great!  I did add 1 tsp vanilla into the cream puff mixture as others have suggested.  I also baked on parchment paper.  I split the pudding into 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 white chocolate.  Both were very tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made little bite sized ones and they turned out great! With the tiny size, I still found myself baking them for 20-22 minutes. Skipped the filling, used a modified version of the "Pumpkin Fluff Dip" recipe to fill them, and served them at a Halloween potluck. The great thing about this recipe is you can fill them with all types of filling consistencies and flavors. Garnished with confectioner's sugar in a mesh colliander - beautiful!!!

Yum, yum, yum!  Delicious, fast and easy.  I made these for a family dinner last night and I had nothing but raves.  I think they taste better than the ones from the local bakery.  I followed the reviews of others and added a bit of vanilla extract and a pinch of sugar the puff batter.  Also, make sure to puncture a little hole with a toothpick towards the end of baking. This will let the steam out so that they don't deflate.  They look as great as they taste.

I made these yesterday and they turned out great.  It was the first time I'd ever made anything like this, and I had no problems with the original recipe. I did use sugar-free pudding to make them completely sugar-free.  I think next time I will try other pudding flavors than vanilla.

Everything is great about this recipe..the filling and the shell. So easy to make. My future mother in law uses the same shell recipe but fills the inside with tuna, ham, turkey and/or chicken salad.

I followed the recipe exactly with no variations and these are magnificent! I also filled them with homemade sweetened whipped cream and dipped them in ganache, they will be better than you expect them to be.

Great, easy recipe. Almost as good as my mother's! For those of you wanting a lighter tasting, less pudding-like filling, add 1-1/2 cups of Cool Whip to your pudding.......yummy

Very good, and easy to make!  My puffs were ready in about 15 minutes, not the 25 minutes the recipe called for.

I didn't have good luck with this one so I'm still looking for a puff recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but mine were burnt on the bottom and stuck  to the cookie sheet in just under 20 minutes. One of my cook books has this recipe but the oven temp is 375 with a 45 minute cook time.  Maybe that would have helped.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that these are really eggy.  Not really what I'm looking for.

I'm sure this can be a great recipe, but I just don't have 'the touch'.  I tried this twice and both times it came out horrible.  I know I messed up the first time by adding the eggs before dough cooled so puffs had bits of cooked eggs throughout.  Second time the batter runny so the puffs came out flatter and wide.  Both times they deflated while cooling.  Baking for me is like gardening--nothing turns out right.  The filling was yummy--it would be hard to mess that up!

this is a great recipe!  I am a Peace Corps Volunteer living on an island that has limited resources, so I had to improvise.  I didn't have the stuff for making them into cream puffs, so I made them into saltfish puffs.  I took saltfish (kinda like tuna but saltier) and mixed in veggies and mayo, then stuffed the puffs with that.  I brought it to a church outing at the beach and they were a HIT!  They are so simple, and really you can stuff it with anything you want!  Thanks!

These were my first attempt at cream puffs. My mom always made them when we were kids, and I remembered how much I loved them. These were easy to make and I followed some of the tips from the other bakers especially poking them with the toothpick when they were done in the oven.  They came out perfect! I did cheat on the filling though and used pudding mix but whipped up fresh whipping cream and mixed it in with the pudding. It made the pudding extra creamy and good. I can't wait to make these again!

I thought these were fantastic.  Very easy to make.  I sprinkled them with a little powdered sugar.  Right before serving, I put out chocolate syrup to drizzle on if desired.

Wow - these were so easy to make and absolutely scrumptious! I used butterscotch flavored pudding mix and it was delicious! The only thing I changed was that I used 3 eggs instead of 4, and I added a a teaspoon of vanilla essence and a little sugar to the batter. Great recipe!

WOW!! These earned me rave reviews. My only problem was that they all fell flat, perhaps because I'm in humid FL?? I'd make these again in a heartbeat, they're so easy!

I added the tsp sugar and vanilla, turned out wonderful.  My family likes a custard filling as well as the cream so to do this I substitute 8oz cream cheese for the whipped cream in the pudding and heat a can of chocolate frosting to drizzle over.

Very good recipe. I made all the cream puffs and half the filling to take to a dinner party.I froze half the puffs unfilled and then thawed them out for another dinner party and just made the other half of the filling that morning. Everyone really liked them.

Excellent cream puffs, light and fluffy, SOO easy to make.  BUT-they fell almost flat *MOST OF THEM* after coming out of oven.  Can't figure out if it was the ingrediants, or what they DO!!
Filled with handmade whipped cream and topped with chocolate sauce, sprinkle of icing sugar on top.
Makes your taste buds melt, and yet it is NOT heavy and rich.  Very nice dessert.  Made TWO batches!  Will make again.
Anyone else have the "falling problem"?
Maybe MORE time in the oven needed?

Perfect! This was my first time making cream puffs and they came out perfect! I served them with a chocolate sauce drizzled over them. Several people in my family do not like pudding, so for them I filled the shell with vanilla ice cream just before serving. This recipe is a keeper!

My family told me that these are the BEST Cream Puffs EVER! I was also told that I have to make them for every holiday! LOL Thanks for a great recipe! I also made them with sugar free chocolate pudding, they went over good as well. ( But not as good as the vanilla ones.)

At first I was worried because my first batch didn't rise well but I guess after the egg batter set for awhile the second batch rose nicely. Brought them to a church get together and everyone loved them. The pudding mixture is to die for. Will be keeping this recipe for sure!!

Theses were great! My family ate 20 in one day and making the pudding with cream makes a difference. Although the shell isn't sugary ( you can add some), dont be discouraged. The pudding has plenty of sugar.

Made the Cream Puffs with this recipe ,and it was wonderful.Just take care when adding the eggs,mix with wooden spoon,constantly and should not stop in between addition of eggs.Beat in as much air as you can.
Also when finished baking either cool the cream puffs in another tray or turn off the oven and keep the oven door slightly ajar.

I've had this recipe in my box for quite a while now, and today is the first time I've made them. We aren't big on sweets, but these were awesome! I did everything as stated, except I added a few shakes of sugar to the batterI baked them for 20 minutes, then let them sit in the oven with the door open for another 5-7. I used a plastic bag to pipe the pudding into the puffs (I wasn't even trying to use as many words starting with "p" as I could). Delicious! Although next time I will cut the recipe in half (I threw half of the batter away and have a half of the pudding left in the fridge). Thank you!

These are awesome!!!  I baked them on my trust baking stone, not greased, only had to cook for 20 minutes and perfectly done.  Will make this one again!

The filling is awesome...I used 1 box French Vanilla & 1 box White Chocolate.  Also added a few dashes of sugar.  Got RAVE reviews.

I struggled a bit with the shells.  Had to toss the first batch because they stuck to the pan (I was using an airbake cookie sheet).  I recommend greasing whatever pan you use.  

Also, as stated, these make "mini" puffs. That was fine, but next time I'll try making the drops of batter bigger.

I can't understand the raves on this.  I made them based on the consistant 5 star reviews.  The puffs were pretty and puffy.  The texture was nice.  The cream is very good.  The puff is BLAND.  Very bland.  If I can find a better puff recipe, I will try it again.  Otherwise, I will keep the filling recipe and toss the puff recipe.

This was my first time making cream puffs and they turned out great! The only thing I changed is I made the filling from scratch with a pastry cream recipe from this site. I used a plastic bag and snipped the end off to fill the puff. I will be making this often.

SOOO good! These have become a family/guest favorite. They whip up so fast and I love having something special to serve that takes hardly any time to prepare! I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla after adding the eggs as others advised and I think it improves the flavor of the puff. (I usually just sprinkle them with powdered sugar and serve, but they are an AWESOME addition to a chocolate fondue bar!)

Use the smallest cookie drop, and only fill that 1/2 to 3/4 full.  The cream puffs turn out PERFECT bite size.  We used a sugar free french vanilla pudding and then made it with whipping cream.  Very rich and full.  The recipe is easy and absolutely perfect every time.

Love this recipe! I didn't know cream puffs were so easy to make. I ended up using less than 3/4 of the pudding mixture for the whole recipe and after feeding the crowd with 36 cream puffs, I cut the shell mixture in half and make about 12 more cream puffs the next day. Simple & delicious! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I just made these yesterday.  They were great. No one could believe I had made them. Although some reviewers complain about the blandness of the puff, I thought the richness of the filling created a perfect balance. I will be making some more soon.

Dusted liberally with powdered suger since I thought it could stand to be a little sweeter.  For dessert, drizzled with chocolate sauce for a prettier presentation.

This recipe was fairly easy.  I've made cream puffs years ago, and this recipe was like the recipe I used then. 
One thing I found with the puffs is that some puffs will hold its shape and others will deflate.  Make sure you bake shells long enough.
Otherwise, it was a great recipe.  Very tasty.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  You can get as creative with them as you want!  You can fill them with any kind of cream, I usually mix condensed milk with butter and refrigerate - makes a great filing.

These were ok.  The shells tasted too much of egg even after I added 1 tbsp of suger.  I just used milk for the pudding filling.  Overall, it's easy to make and tasted not too bad.  Thanks for the recipe.

OMG! These are just like the creme puffs my mother USED to make!  I must say that my cream came out MUCH better though b/c I used 1 cup whipping creme instead of heavy creme.  It is a little thick (and much more fattening) but you can add milk to adjust and you seem to get more!  Thanks so much. I will be adding this to my favorite recipes!

Very good. It took a little longer to be well baked. After the 25 minutes in the oven they were still undone inside. Next time I'll make them smaller. The filling was a little bland for my tastes, maybe some almonds or tiny orange pieces would fit well in the vanilla pudding mix.

This was a hit with the friends and family at the X-Mas gathering.  I recommend not using airbake cookie sheets, as the puffs didn't cook evenly and collapsed.  Regular cookie sheets were great.  I preferred vanilla over the chocolate. (I made both).

These are sooo easy!!  I followed the directions except I used a handheld mixer, not a stand mixer.  I used regular flour (like the recipe states) and everything else the recipe calls for.  They puffed up beautifully!  I am not a good cook, but how can you go wrong with these?  All those reviewers who say they are good cooks and couldn't cook these cream puffs, I ask you-  What exactly are you good at cooking?  Boxed Mac N Cheese?

I do not cook very much and when I do it requires alot of time and effort.  Your recipes was far from that!  It was easy and fast!  Everyone in my family loved it and it's easier than doing it the old fashion way that my grandma try to teach me.  I love how each cream puff get fat as you fill it.  I never seem to use all the filling though but it's good to dip it in the left over filling.  I make it to where the cream oozes out just a little tempting my guest and family members to take one.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have made it over 30 times and will continue!

These are so great and so ridiculously easy! I made them for my hubby and I's Valentines dinner and they were scarfed up pretty fast! And this is such an easy recipe to make changes to- use a different flavor pudding, top with chocolate, whip the pudding filling, etc, and you have a whole 'nother recipe that tastes just as great! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy recipe!  Try this and impress your friends and family! Not too sweet, but just right. The only thing I changed was to add 1 tsp vanilla to cream puff dough. This was my first attempt at cream puffs and they were a huge sucess - everyone loved them.

Wow these were sooo good. I made this all in one bowl(no need to dirty other bowls).Mine didn't rise that high but so what? I just spooned a homemade vanilla custard (out of Better Homes and Gardens CKBK) because I didn't have cream or pudding mix over the puffs and they tasted so good that I practically inhaled two of them! I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  Everyone who tried it was astounded at how good it was!  One suggestion to sweeten the puffs a little more is to dust them with confectioners sugar!  Enjoy!

This was awesome.  I am by no means a good cook and this turned out great.  Was also very easy to make.  I added a little vanilla to the shell mixture and some cool whip to the filling.  Thanks Shellie

These cream puffs are amazing & sooo easy. Just to let everyone know, make a batch use as filling in double layer cakes. After putting the the pudding on the first layer, try put real fruit(esp. Comstock)on top. I use whatever is requested. Beside filling, I've also completely coverd a double layer cake  with it.  Heavy yes, fattening, yes. But amazing. Make sure the cake layers are cool and be gentle. Please let me know what you think.  GOOD LUCK

I give this recipe four stars because it was very easy to make and my kids LOVED it. Considering all the complaints about the eggy taste-I decided to add 1 tsp. vanilla extract to the dough mix (next time I will add about 2 tsp). I'm happy to say that the pastry did puff but I did have to cook it longer than 30 minutes in order for the middle to cook. I thought the filling was just ok, could be much better-had that package pudding aftertaste. All in all, it is a very easy recipe and I will make it again and again, experimenting here and there with the ingredients.  Thank you for sharing!

These were good, but not better than my local bakery.  The ease and simplicity of this recipe is the main reason why I would make them again.  I thought the filling was lacking a little in flavor so maybe I might play around with it.  I've found another recipe for cream puffs that uses a ricotta and mascarpone filling that I might try.  Thanks for sharing.

I had family come in from out of town and on very short notice. My family loves to sit and talk with coffee and cream puffs(homemade of course) And since I just got married It was my turn. So I franticly looked for a cream puff recipe, and found it, quick, easy and the Family loved them. Thank you Shellie Wendel

These are easy to make but so worth it. I made two dozen and these were gone in 5 minutes at a recent BBQ. Highly recommend this one-drizzle melted semi-sweet chocolate on top!

I made these for my son's 2nd grade class and wish I would have doubled the batch so I could have had some to keep at home.  The children LOVED them!  These were very, very easy to make and taste fabulous!!

I made these spur of the moment, just for fun. I had them on the counter in the kitchen and had to run an errand. When I returned 10 minutes later he had come home from  work and already ate 5 cream puffs. He said these were the best cream puffs he ever ate, better than any bakery! They were very easy to make and make a nice presentation.

Great recipe - tasted perfect! My only complaint is that the ingredients list calls for cream, yet there was no reference to it in the instructions ...

My first time to make cream puffs - really easy and delicious!  Looks good (I also sprinkled some powdered sugar on top) and kids love it.  Can't wait for the next potluck/occasion to make this.

Easy to make and drizzled with chocolate and sprinkled with icing sugar, they look like they were fussed over. Next time I might try and reduce the milk and add "Cool whip" to pudding mixture just before filling the puffs -- it would probably make a lighter fluffy filling.

Great recipe..I split the filling into two batches, one with vanilla pudding and the other with chocolate (just for variety) and it was really fantastic. I think 25 cream puffs lasted about 5 minutes. Thank you.

The end result was wonderful, but I had to work to get there. I halved the recipe, resulting in 9 golf-ball sized pastries. Until too late, I didn't realize I needed not one box of pudding, but three. I used my one box (1/3 of 3), and 1/3 of the 1/2 c. cream. The result was pasty and salty. Yuck. I had to add 6 oz of Cool Whip to get it to the right consistency & eliminate the saltiness. Next time, I might add flavoring to Cool Whip and use only that. I drizzled chocolate over the tops, and served with fanned strawberries on a powdered sugar-dusted dessert plate complete with a doily. The presentation was fantastic. My guests loved it, and wanted larger servings. Next time, I'll do the full pastry recipe. The pastry was scrumptious and flaky.

Really good. The cream sauce in the center is the way I want to make pudding from now on. My daughter really had a hard time leaving some for the cream puffs.

I brought these to a Super Bowl party. Every single person wanted one and seconds. Good thing I doubled the recipe. I brought chocolate ice cream topping to top them off. What a hit. Thanks.
