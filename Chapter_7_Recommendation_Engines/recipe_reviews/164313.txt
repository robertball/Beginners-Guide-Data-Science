Wonderful recipe! I put red onions into the salsa that added a nice kick, as well as a second jalape√±o. The dressing was delicious...some extra cumin gives it a some good spice. This was fast and easy to make, and everyone loved it.

I just got back from a trip to Hawaii and was craving a fish taco like the one I had at a restaurant there.  This comes VERY close...but without the view of the ocean!  I even used a frozen mix of pineapple, mango, and papaya and it turned out lovely.  Also, I didn't have mahi mahi, so used tilapia instead.  This is a softer fish -- it tasted good, but the mahi mahi would have held up better.  Still, a great tropical meal.

I absolutely loved this, and it's super easy!  I didn't have time to make fresh salsa, so I used a good quality salsa and just added fresh mango.  It was quite good.

Very good and tasty.  Next time though I might do without the s.c sauce.  Was sort of bitter compared to the rest of the taco...but overall...excellent

The ginger lime dressing is delicious, and could go with just about any fish taco, not just mahi mahi. I replaced the salsa recipe with my own, because I prefer tomatoes to avacadoes. Also, shredded cheese on the tacos is a good compliment. I would recommend adding shredded lettuce, beans, or rice to the taco in order to give it body. Even with liberal servings, just the fish and the topping doesn't do it for us.

"THe best fish taco i've ever had" says the boyfriend. It really was delicious. I was tempted to add more seasoning to the fish, but didn't (glad I didn't). Tempted to skip the sour cream sauce (really glad I didn't). If you taste it on it's own, the sauce may seem a little out of place... but it pairs so nicely with the salsa - I wouldn't skip it ever! And about the salsa, I added some red onion, mainly for color but also flavor. It was ok. I added some lime juice and salt and pepper...ba-bam! It was so good, I had to get rid of the spoon so I'd stop eating it before the fish was ready! Skipped the cilantro because BF doesn't like it, but I didn't miss it. I am looking forward to making them again!! This was a real winner!

Someone gave us some Mahi Mahi and I wasn't sure what to do with it, but found this recipe.  Mangos aren't in season here in Puerto Rico, right now, so I left them out.  Both the sauce and the salsa were still amazing!  I recommend fresh pineapple because the acids preserve the color of the avocado and add a bit of sweet bite better than canned would.  I will definitely make this again.  We served it with you-bake tortillas from Costco.  DELICIOUS!  Who knew I'd like fish tacos?

The family ooo-ed and ahhh-ed over this one and claimed the recipe was a keeper!  The flavors blend nicely: it's just the right amount of sweet, creamy, savory, and heat.  I was even complimented on how the textures blended so well.  The only complaint was that the ginger sauce ran out too soon.  Next time I'd probably make 4 times as much, since we have some big eaters here.  This would probably also be great with pork or chicken too!!

These turned out really well. I made them as directed, but ended up really increasing the heat and flavor of the sauce and the salsa towards the end. I think a green taco sauce would be excellent with this to counter the sweetness, in addition to the ginger-lime dressing and fruit salsa. I added red cabbage to our tacos for texture. Thanks for the recipe!

So good! I added a lot of extra ginger and used store bought mango salsa since I already had it. The sour cream sauce is awesome.

These were VERY good.  I don't like fish, but I've been trying to have it more since it's so good for you.  Mahi Mahi is such a mild flvored fish, and with all these delicious tropical flavors, there's no fishy taste at all...just good for you yumminess.

I loved the freshness of this recipe, and the ginger-lime dressing adds an incredible depth of flavor to the salsa.  Next time, I would add chopped red pepper and red onion to the salsa for more color and flavor.  The only change I made was to use soft white corn tortillas, which we prefer.  Thanks for a unique and fun recipe!

These were delicious! I made the sour cream sauce per instructions but used light. I added the cilantro and red onion to the salsa and broiled tilapia filets, sprinkled with some Tony Chachere's at 450 for 10 minutes - perfect! The combination of flavors are amazing...definitely a keeper!

I came to the conclusion that my family does not like fish tacos. We like mahi mahi but I don't think that the salsa or the sour cream sauce went with the fish. I made the recipe exactly as followed. We ended up eating the fish plain and used the salsa with corn chips (after adding more jalapeno to add some heat and cut down on the sweetness). All said and done we will probably not be making this again.

This was a great recipe!  I can't give it 5 stars because I changed some things....  I couldn't get fresh mahi mahi, so I subbed tilapia.  I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream (hubby hates sour cream) and I omitted the jalepeno and cilantro.  The flavors of the fruits and avacado paired nicely with the fish and the ginger/lime flavors of the dressing.  This is a recipe I will make again!

Delicious and fresh taste! Nice to find a recipe that focuses on fresh ingredients and doesn't rely on processed stuff. I just added a little sweet onion to the salsa and put the cilantro in it as well. My husband and I both enjoyed them and will again!

The mango/pineapple/avocado salsa was delicious, I didn't add jalapenos as no one wanted them. The fish could have used a little more seasoning than salt and pepper. Maybe marinading in lime a little longer would have helped. The sour cream sauce was a bit lackadaisical. It helps the dry fish go down.

We loved it.  I omitted the sauce on my taco and still loved it.  My 4 year old said it was great just a little messy.  Note, do not use low carb tortillas.  They can't handle the heavy juicy weight of the fish, mango, avocado.

Once upon a time in a state far away, we used to eat the best fish tacos at a local restaurant.  I've been on a quest to find something as good.  This is IT!  I followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  We also tried using soft white corn tortillas, also delightful.  They are easy to make.  Definitely make the sauces before you cook the fish.  I can't wait to make them again.

I have only ever taken the time to review a handful of recipes.  In general I think many recipes lack creativity and/or flavor.  This recipe was delicious and  felt guilt free!  I baked the fish (instead of frying it) the night before to cut down on time. All the ingredients and measurements I kept exactly as directed which I think is only fair when rating a recipe the first time.  The ingredients were simple but came together in a refreshing way.  I will definitely make the mango/pineapple/avocado salsa again to use with other meals. My family loves fish tacos - usually cod- but we will definitely be making these again very soon.

We marinated our mahi-mahi with 2 tbsp oil, 2 cloves garlic and 2 tbsp lime juice.  Then we used a blackened seasoning, and served it with our own mango salsa (2 mangos, 2 tomatoes, juice of 1 lime, 2 jalapeno, 1 apricot, 1 peach, cilantro, 4 pkgs of Stevia, 1/2 c crushed pineapple and rice vinegar (less than 1/4 c).  We used the dressing from this recipe, instead of another that was similar that called for yogurt that we did not have.  So the rating is for the dressing.

This is a great recipe! Made healthy with fresh mahimahi, fresh fruit mango salsa, and sour cream topping. Even healthier is as a salsa salad and omitting the tortillas if counting calories. My family loves this!

This is sooo good!  The only thing I changed was omitting the jalapeno for the kiddos and substituting canned pineapple.  It has a bold, unique flavor.  If you've never had fish tacos or think they sound gross, this is a great recipe to start with.  These will be a regular when I find Mahi on sale.

I am not a big ginger fan so I made this without.  Also, I subbed  kiwis instead of pineapple (since I have a pineapple allergy).  The kiwis were amazing with the mango and avocado!  This is a fairly sweet dish but the cayenne pepper and jalapenos balance the flavors nicely.  Don't skip the cilantro with this dish!  Great meal for a hot summer night... very fresh and light.

This is a keeper! I season the fish with Simply Organic fish taco seasoning and than only add a hint of cumin to the sc mixture. The sour cream is awesome! Instead of ginger root I use a ginger paste from the produce section. Also, I use a great fresh peach salsa from the produce section instead of making my own, that makes these super quick!

The pineapple and mango I think were a bit too much. It was a little too sweet. I think next time, I'll put the mango salsa in a food processor for a few seconds, and possibly add a little less pineapple, and a little more avocado and jalapeno.

First time ever trying Mahi Mahi, these tacos were REALLY good! But, Hubby hated the dressing! He said it took away from the taste of the fish. I kind of agreed with him. I am not a mango fan, but son is, so I went with it and quite frankly couldn't tell it was in there, Super fresh n Quick!

Very tasty! I really enjoyed this meal. It's not complicated to make and the flavors are phenomenal.  Next time I think I'll alter the relish by including only one sweet fruit--the pineapple OR the mango and also by adding red onions. Thanks for this wonderful tropical treat of a recipe!

We had mahi mahi tacos recently at a local Mexican restaurant and were trying to find a recipe that would compare.  This recipe exceeded expectations!  We didn't have any pineapple and we added green onion. We can't wait to try this out with our usual cooking partners, The Best Friends Dinner Club!  Love, The JoelKateLazerKitchen and the BFDC!

Wow - this was an experience!  Since the recipe said the fish only needed to cook 3 min on each side, I decided to start with the sauces first so I wouldn't get distracted.  I have a tiny kitchen and a big family.  Mango Salsa - apparently I got ahold of a "Super Jalapeno" pepper because the salsa was ON FIRE by the time I got done mixing it.  My eyes were watering so bad I had to take a break so I could read the rest of the recipe.  To calm it down, I added a can of corn and a can of black beans - both drained.  Then I mixed up the white sauce, double batch, using fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream.  I left out the cayenne pepper because I could still feel the jalapeno burn.  Then came the interesting venture of cooking the fish.  I couldn't find Mahi Mahi in my store, so I grabbed Talepia.  I put it in the pan with a sprinkle of olive oil, a dash of sea salt, and a sprinkle of lemon pepper.  3 min on each side was ok, until it started breaking apart but I could still see red in the middle.  So, through sheer accident, it turned into something like a fish stir fry in the pan when I tried to turn it over.  I added a little more seasoning and oil and went ahead with the stir fry experiment.  It was YUMMY!!  VERY messy, but yummy!  It was a tasty mess, but I have one unsolved question - I have washed my hands a zillion times and the jalapeno oil on my fingers is still burning every body part I touch.  Anyone know how to kill the burn???

these are great. I used tilapia since that is what we had on hand/one of the few kinds of fish my husband likes. A couple minor changes based on what I had on hand...but I don't think it changes things a whole lot. I had tons of homegrown tomatoes on hand and a salsa just needs a tomato to me...so in one went. And I had just made my avacados into guacamole the day before so I subsituted a cup+ of the guac (non sour cream based one which has red pepper flakes in it) for the avacado and jalepeno pepper.
addendum: I had leftover lime/sour cream....found an awesome use for that too. I had a squash soup that came out a tad bland. I added a swirl of the leftover lime cream and it really improved the squash soup!

Unfortunately the avocado and fruit goes bad within a day after cutting it up, so I had to buy more, but the tacos were great. I used canned pineapple for convenience and corn tortillas.

I don't know if I did something wrong...I followed the recipe exactly, but it fell really flat. I was unable to find mahi mahi, so they suggested swordfish as a good mahi mahi replacement. I think maybe next time I will add more than just salt and pepper to the fish. It just didn't do anything for my husband and I.

Needs more flavor.  The dressing definitely needed double the cumin, ginger, lime and I added some chopped cilantro to the mix.  I should have used more seasoning on the mahi mahi.  As is, this is a pretty bland recipe in my opinion.

The sour cream sauce felt like it was missing something.  Next time I'll add more seasoning to it to give it a little umph.  The mahi mahi itself was a little bland as well.

These were very good!  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. The sauce was good but a little bland so I think I'll stick to sour cream next time. I also added some black beans to each taco.

Love the ginger-lime sauce, goes absolutely wonderful with the salsa. I just served the fish over rice rather than make tacos out of it and everyone who has tried it loves it.

These tacos were excellent! I didn't add in the jalapeno to the mango salsa because I can't handle the heat, but they were still amazing.  I was worried that the flavors wouldn't balance out, but they were perfect together.

The dressing was quite good. I actually had some Swai fish from Thailand that cooked up with better texture than Mahi Mahi.

This had wonderful flavor.  My  only suggestion would be to double the sauce as we were fighing over it.  I will make this again!

Outstanding!  I've been looking for a long time & this is it.  Super quick & easy.  Don't be afraid of the Jalepeno it's heat is offset perfectly by the sweet mango & pineapple.  Double the sourcream sauce.  Any mild fish would work, I used fresh cod fillets & fried them in tin foil on the grill.  Also served on corn tortillas that I warmed on the grill.

Best Ever.  I have made this 10x at least and by far a favorite.  Mango-Pineapple-Avacado chop coarsely for good texture in taco.

This is a WONDERFUL yet subtle dish, considering how bold the ingredients can be. I do highly recommend doubling the ginger-lime dressing, if you're like me and LOVE your dressing!

Had to make w/o pineapple due to allergies- so used fresh strawberries instead. Salsa was good, but the overall dish was not to my or my familys liking.- Very bland. I will not make again.

These tacos were easy to prepare and really elegant!  I doubled the salsa recipe and was glad I did - we used it up.  My entire family loved this.  The Salsa and dressing can be made ahead of time so it can be quick to put together later in the evening.  I am planning on serving them to my friends who are chefs!

very good, but can't say its fair for me to rate since I didn't have several ingredients and had to make substitutions.  Had nothing to make the sc sauce, but instead used frozen mango medley and mixed with regular salsa - great results!  thanks for sharing easy, good recipe.

Very Good! Even my kids liked it and they are 5 and 2.  Next time we are going to try sweetening up the sauce or using yogurt instead of sourcream but I think I'll like it better as is.

Super yummy! We marinated the fish before cooking to add a little extra flavor, and added a squirt of sriracha and some shredded cabbage to the finished tacos. The sauce and salsa were amazing!

Great recipe!  Made one version exactly like recipe.  Mahi Mahi held up nicely.  After cooking, I cut the filets into long pieces.  Everyone was happy to have something out of the ordinary for supper.

My grandson is allergic to gluten and dairy.  So I substituted dairy-free sour cream and used gluten-free corn taco shells for his.  He loved it!

I literally can't say enough nice things about this dish - everything from the sauce to the salsa, the simplicity of the fish to the cilantro on top - spot on!!!  Make this with two jalapenos for a little extra kick.  We will be having this many, many more times!!!

Absolutely love this recipe! The fish was so flavorful and the fresh fruits made it so much better! I'm not a big fan of sour cream, and I even ate that! If you want something refreshing, sweet and healthy, I'd go with this recipe!

This is our favorite dinner and we make it once a month!  We use guacamole instead of avocado, I double the sauce every time,  top it with pico de gallo, and I usually spice up the fish with Cajun seasoning or chilli powder, but it is still great without extra seasoning.

it's not bad. The ginger dressing can be tricky to get it to taste, and it should be said you should buy high quality mahi for this work well, or it can become a little tough. A fairly easy recipe to follow

Amazing taste.   I sometimes time up the sour cream with a little extra cumin and cayenne and it just adds to that taste without overpowering everything other taste.  Try using other green hot peppers as well.

A lot of prep work, but it was worth it. I marinated the fish for several hours in salt, garlic powder, and lemon juice prior to sauteing it. Very yummy!

We made these last night and they were fantastic! We made half of the fish exactly as the recipe describes and the other half we used "Tom's Blackening Seasoning" (from this site) instead and it both were delish! I used frozen fruit but I know fresh would have been way better! And I added a bit more lime for the sauce (I ended up just squeezing the entire thing to make the sauce thinner). Next time I am going to try plain Greek yogurt for a healthy spin. Thanks!

I tried the whole recipe. I was not very impressed with the whole thing. My family loves the mango salsa with shrimp tacos. I do add red onions it was a little to mushy for me and the onions give it a little crunch.

Mahi is so mild that, to me, this recipe needs a little more oomph for seasoning on the fish. So I used the marinade from another recipe from this site (Grilled Fish tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing), and it was awesome on the grill! The reason I rated this recipe a 4 was for the salsa and dressing - LOVE! In fact, after we were finished with our tacos, I kept picking at the salsa until to my surprise, I'd finished it off! Really delicious.

I loved this! I didn't use the jalape√±o because my husband doesn't like spicy food but I added some diced red onion for a little extra flavor and zest! I also substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream to get some more protein and less fat and I skipped the ginger. It looked and tasted amazing! Would definitely make for guests I want to impress!

I broiled the mahi mahi (first salted, peppered and lightly sprayed the fillets with Pam to seal in moisture) instead of pan frying. I served the fillets as an entree without tortillas since I'm gluten sensitive. I also substituted rinsed (canned) black beans for the avocado since I didn't have an avocado on hand. Spooned the salsa and lime ginger sauce on top for a beautiful presentation with a great flavor. This recipe is a keeper -- definitely company worthy.

Awesome recipe, we could not find Mahi Mahi so we used halibut and it was great. The dressing is so good, as well as the salsa. Thank you.

I loved this recipe. Awesome combination of flavors. However, this did not go over very well with my family. 4 and 5 year olds did not like it at all. Husband thought it was ok, but thought it would be better with the fish flaked up instead of in a chunk. Thanks anyway!

This is the first recipe I've reviewed on this site.  I am in Maui right now with my family, and I just got this email recipe a couple days ago. It was the absolute perfect recipe for our Hawaiian vacation and the whole family loved it!  One thing I did was to increase the sweetness of the sour cream sauce and I put a sprinkle of cane sugar into the sauce and it was the perfect balance of flavors for us! Thanks for the perfect recipe at the perfect time!

Excellent and easy. I baked the breaded fillets (20 minutes at 375 drizzled with olive oil) and meanwhile chopped the green onions and cilantro. I also sliced a medium red onion, left out the ginger (I had but forgot!), peeled and sliced the mango everything went into the taco shells. Very good!

I didn't love or hate this recipe. My boyfriend hated the sour cream sauce. We both love the pineapple salsa (I didn't put avacado in ours)and will probably make a variation of the salsa again, but not the tacos.

We really enjoyed this dish. I omitted the pineapple because I didn't have any and my husband grilled it instead of pan fried. The mango salsa was very taste and goes really well with mahi mahi.

Delicious. I used  canned pineapple instead of fresh because the fresh stuff was just to $$ and I wouldn't have been able to eat the whole thing just myself. I may have added a bit more cayenne to the sour cream (used fat free) and I used a chipolte pepper instead in the salsa because another dish I was using required chiplote so I had an open can.  Was very good. I had this in whole wheat tortillas and served it with calabacitas.

We thought this was way too sweet, and not nearly spicy enough.  The dressing and fruit reminded us of a pina colada and it did not go with fish.  I like fish tacos with fruit salsa, but this wasn't my kind of recipe.  Might be better with more jalapeno and less/no sour cream.

I altered this recipe so much with very good results. First off, I had 2 filets split in 4. I used the stove to cook 2 scallions diced, 4 slices of ginger, 1 clove garlic, and 3 tablespoons of butter. After this was cooked, I put it in bowl and cooked the mahi mahi and pepper on the same pan. In a bowl, I removed the syrup of 2 cans of tropical fruits and 1 plastic container of passion fruit and mango. (Husband drank the juice.) I then course blended the fruits with 2 tablespoons of cilantro, 2 tablespoons of lime, 1/4 jalapeno pepper, and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. After blending, I halved the fruit salsa to make cold fruit salsa and warm fruit salsa. I added the other half in a pot and added 1 tablespoon of honey. Cooked the warm fruit salsa for about 5 minutes. I served it all with rice and not tortillas because I was reserving the tortillas for breakfast burritos.
