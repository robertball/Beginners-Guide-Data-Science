I substituted the beans with Beyond Meat faux meat crumbles. Delicious!

This was tasty, and VERY cute, but I didn't like the fact that I had a lot of corn and refried beans and yellow rice left over after making these. The stuffing ingredients will probably fill 8 to 10 large bell peppers.

It took me making another Mexican type stuffed pepper from this site to realize how much I appreciated this one and the simplicity of it. There is a lot of flavor here with little effort. I don't feel it serves as a main dish as some of the others do but it makes for a perfect tasty side dish to serve with your Mexican food. I plan on making this one again soon.

These are so cute for Halloween. When the cheese starts oozing from the eyes and mouth is when they look the best too.
