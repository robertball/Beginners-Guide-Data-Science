This is my favorite kind of panini! I have a few tips though to make these sandwiches easier and healthier. For the bread, you can use any sturdy bread.  Spray one side of each slice of bread with no-stick spray before putting it on the grill. For the pesto, Classico makes a very strong jarred pesto and you only need 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of it on a sandwich, which lightens it up significantly. Sliced turkey lunch meat is easier to handle and you don't have to cook something special before hand, and thinly sliced bell peppers stay in the sandwich better. I don't usually put cheese on mine, but I put a thin slice of mozzarella on my boyfriend's turkey pesto paninis. Mozzarella is lower in fat and calories than Monterey jack. I hope this helps someone, these are really great sandwiches!

I'm not giving these a five only because I changed things up a lot but they were delish.  I caramelized my onions and mixed my pesto with herbed cream cheese.  I then spread my pesto and cream cheese mix on both sides of the focaccia then I put my chicken, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers on with the shredded cheese.  Warmed this all up on the Forman and had a salad with tons of veggies and Balsamic Dressing on the side.  Okay, Yum!

Very good! I didn't have focaccia bread so used regular bread (the outside buttered) and grilled the sandwhiches on the stovetop using a plate weighed down with a can to press the sandwhich together as it cooked.

This panini was great in flavor and easy because of the already-made pesto.  Only thing I would change would be to use sliced chicken because the diced chicken tended to make it messier to eat because it kept falling out.  VERY good though and will use again.

This was delicious. I didn't change a thing. I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to speed up preparation. The focaccia bread is terrific for this recipe. I will be making this again and again.

It would be great if people would not alter the recipe and tell how good it was (different recipe!)  It doesn't let others know that THIS recipe is really, really good.

super yummy.  i used vegetarian chicken strips instead of real chicken.  next time i will omit the chicken altogether, though.  the flavor of the green peppers and the onions with the cheese and basil pesto was so good on its own.  i don't have a panini press so i wrapped each sandwhich in foil and heated them in a 425 degree oven for about 15 or 20 mins.

These are good, but only foccocia bread will work.  I tried a substitute and it didn't work.

This is one great little sandwich. I used pre-cooked chicken strips as well as basil pesto from a jar. Tasty. I think this would be a great picnic sandwich.

Yummy! This sandwich was delicious. I tweaked it a bit, but I suggest you try it however you like it. I mixed a couple teaspoons of light mayo with a couple teaspoons of Classico pesto. On top of the provolone I used, I put a thin slice of tomato. If you use deli meat, lettuce is a great addition after the sandwich is done cooking. If you use chicken breast, you may want to leave the lettuce off or toss on spinach. I'm always looking for ways to add veggies and this sandwich is just perfect for that. This is an instant regular in our house. Oh, when I need a little extra something, a sprinkle the inside of the sandwich with garlic salt. Yum!

Tasty alternative to the usual sandwich (love the focaccia bread and pesto combination). I modified this somewhat since I'm not a big fan of the peppers/onion combo. I substituted those ingredients with fresh tomato slices, leafy lettuce, and a thin layer of olive oil mayo. I think this is a great recipe to adapt and tweak to your liking.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I used the recipe as-is with my George Foreman Grill and it worked wonderfully!  I like it because you can do the veggie prep and cook the chicken in advance so it can be a VERY quick week night meal.

This tasted incredible. I caramelized the onions and green peppers before building the sandwich and used the Foreman Grill to press and grill them. I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day. Incredible!

this was outstanding.  I couldn't find grated monterey jack so I got a grated pepper jack that had a kick.  also the focaccia was a garlic peppercorn focaccia from our local grocery store.  Hubby cooked chicken with basil.  absolutely a 5 star.  will have again SOON.  made it in a skillet like you would a grilled cheese.

This is amazing! I made it the other night for dinner, and everyone loved it! I left out the green pepper and red onion, because I was hoping the kids would eat it. They did, and loved it! Definately a keeper.

I LOVE this panini -- and fellow reviewer "Shiloh" and I think a lot alike when it comes to making a healthier version (see March '08).  ;o)

I use whole wheat sourdough bread, and, like Shiloh, I use the Classico brand pesto.  I also use sliced turkey, sliced part skim mozzarella, and thinly sliced (red) pepper and onion. (I don't own a panini grill and the sandwich is easier to flip when the ingredients are sliced.)  I brush the outside of my panini very lightly with extra virgin olive oil before grilling. Sometimes I leave the turkey off of mine and add sliced tomatoes to make a great veggie panini.  Hubby likes his meat though, so I always put turkey on his!  We had these for dinner tonight with Muir Glen Organic Tomato Soup.  YUM!

Try it this way also: pesto, artichoke hearts chopped, Swiss cheese, chicken breast cut in small pieces, fresh Parmesan. Awesome. I eat this often. Can also throw in some bruschetta.

Cooked the chicken with random garden herbs, added in some zucchini because I have a plethora from our garden. I used a different bread that came as a loaf not a round, which was fine by me. This turned out wonderful!

Very simple, fast and yummy! I didn't have focaccia bread but I had some panini bread from Trader Joe's so I used that instead. My husband said it tasted like something you would get at a country club!  haha  This will definitely become a regular dinner at our place.  :)

This panini was very good.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of monterey jack -  because that's what I had.  My family really liked this recipe.  I will make again, but will probably use sliced mozzarella just because it would be easier to put the panini together.

We enjoyed this very much! I used a round loaf of French bread sliced for a good size sandwich, chicken from the deli and homemade pesto. I took the meat and cheese out of the frig about 20 minutes before grilling to warm up a bit. I grilled on medium until the cheese began to ooze. Very nice recipe, thank you.

This is so good! I used provolone cheese but only because I couldn't remember what kind of cheese the recipe said. I also had to use my George Foreman because I don't have a panini press. This is so good! My daughter who is super picky, who even said when I was putting everything together that it smelled funny, loved it!

I make these all the time.  My husband can't get enough of them.  I use all the same ingredients except sliced cooked chicken breast (sliced myself or from the deli).  I find it stays in place better and roasted red pepper strips and thin slices of red onion.  To make them a little more "gourmet" try them with smoked gouda cheese instead of monterey jack.  YUM!

This was really really delicious!  My husband and 3 year old loved it.  I ended up making it on a croissant since that is what I had, did the remainder of the recipe as written.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I modified this recipe a little and the results were fantastic. Firstly, don't dice the chicken. Leave in large hunks or even the whole breast for a more substantial feel. We also like to saute the onions first before grilling the sandwich, which gives it a greater depth of flavor, in my opinion. And lastly, just a side note, the word panini is already plural (like cannoli or ravioli) so it means sandwiches. Panino is the singular form, and means sandwich :)

This was a very simple meal that was well enjoyed. I shall make the orginal someday soon but varied it by what I had on hand.  I used hogie rolls with the top sheared off; 1 pregrilled sliced chicken breast; sauteed onions and green pepper; pesto; feta cheese--grilled.  Simple and yummy.

These paninis are fantastic. My alterations were: 2 sundried tomato ciabattas, pan-frying a whole chicken breast then slicing it, sauteing onion slices in the same pan, 1 green pepper and sliced emental cheese. Assemlbed as the recipe suggested and chucked in the oven for 5 minutes. The outcome was beautiful. The pesto really makes this recipe. Had one ciabatta with a side salad for dinner and I was really full. Planning to have the other one cold for lunch tomorrow and I can't wait. A really easy and delicious sandwich for those nights you just don't feel like cooking and need a veggie fix.

Delicious, fast and easy with my sandwich press. I used what I had: shredded mozzarella, Tuscan Boule, roasted red peppers, chicken breasts sautéed with garlic, basil, oregano, and prepared pesto (the tube variety). Big hit here, even with the picky eaters!

I've made this twice now and really enjoy it. We have not had peppers/onions on hand either time, so I guess I can't say we've made this exact thing, but with the Pesto sauce, the panini is REALLY good. I've used both sliced chicken and sliced turkey, and I get mine from the deli instead of making it at home. I wasn't sure how the pesto would be but it gives it great flavor. We used the Classico and it's awesome. I'm sure with the peppers and onions it would be even better!

Love these. I make homeade foccacia bread from this site and my own pesto, so I almost have everything on hand for these! I use rotisserie chicken and followed recipe exactly the first time, they were yummy. Now a regular feature at our house. A friend at work brought her panini grill to work and we even make them there now! We keep the foccacia bread, pesto, and rotisserie chicken every time, but change up the types of cheese and veggies. Great recipe!

OMG these are wonderful.  I made pesto from the "pesto sauce" recipe on here and it helped make the sandwiches great.  I used deli sliced chicken and provolone cheese since my local deli didn't have monterey jack.  I also used those thin 100 calorie sandwich buns since I had some on hand rather than buying the focaccia.  I also used sliced, rather than diced, onion and pepper as a few people recommended.

My b/f and I both loved them, he was worried I was making some "health" food and I wasn't sure if the thin bread would be ok but they were awesome.  Definitely will make again!

I am really enjoying this sandwich!  I did switch red pepper for the green and had didn't have any cooked chicken, so I just bought some high quality sliced turkey.   I also had to just bake the sandwich wrapped in foil since I don't have a panini grill.  I could eat these sandwiches often and probably will!

Yummy! I used leftover chicken I roasted a couple days earlier and also added some mayo. I didn't use peppers as I don't like them. For the bread I flattened pizza dough from my grocers bakery, rubbed it with olive oil and sprinked some seasonings on it. Baked it for about 30 mins and had fresh baked bread for the paninis. They were great!

My hubby and I loved this recipe. Hubby actually asked for it which says a lot. I used red bell pepper just because I prefer the taste. I also cheated and used an already roasted chicken from the store which made the recipe even easier.

Great way to use leftover chicken! I used my square grill pan and toasted the top halves first. I then put the paninis together and placed my heavy Pampered Chef Pizza stoneware on top of the paninis to weigh it down. Let them heat for a couple of minutes until cheese melted and bottom half toasted nicely complete with grill marks! Yummy and easy. My husband and I both enjoyed these!

I did not have any focaccia bread, so I just used regular sliced bread.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and used a George Foreman grill.  This tasted great and I will definalty make again and again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

I made some changes to this recipe out of necessity - not to improve it.  We didn't have any panini available, so I used some kaiser buns we had on hand.  Didn't grill the sandwiches but assembled the chicken, onion, and peppers in the roll w/ pesto spread and mozzarella cheese.  Tasted very yummy, although I'm sure it's better w/ panini!  A refreshing sandwich w/ the fresh veggies.

Okay let me start off by saying how yummy this was, definitely a keeper! BUT mine came out like a mess lol (my head was else where and I was not paying attention and kept forgetting everything lol) I didn't have Focaccia Bread nor could I find it so I used Fresh Italian from the bakery. I had everything else. Someone mentioned to cut the chicken into long slices instead of chunks, probably would've helped because the chunks kept falling out on me. Otherwise awesome recipe, we loved it! Much Thanks ??

Very tasty. I used smaller focaccia sandwich rolls instead of one large loaf and pre-cooked chicken from the deli counter. Also used sliced monterey jack cheese.  Really easy to put together and will be repeating this again soon.

These were excellent! A big hit with the whole family.  I used homemade focaccia bread, which was super easy and well worth it.  I also made some with rotisserie chicken, fresh spinach, pesto sauce, kalamata olives, feta cheese, mozzarella, and red onion  I like the adaptability of this recipe.

This was a big hit with hubby for dinner, who's usual response to anything is "it's ok." I made my own pesto using the pesto sauce recipe from this site with slight modifications.  Fantastic light dinner.

Made this the other night, only thing I changed was I cooked the peppers and onion slightly before putting on sandwich and added hot peppers to one.  Everyone loved it, a great quick meal when your hungry but can't be bothered cooking.

These were awesome, I did cook my onions and peppers first, and sliced my chicken, as per other reviewers stated I thought It would be less messy, and cooked it on my George foreman grill...Great pannini!

This combo tastes so perfect together and so easy, my husband could eat them now on a regular basis for lunch! I prefer the provolone cheese, but any kind of white lunch meat and cheese works.

YES! I used a loaf of ciabatta. I cut it in half (pulled out some bread from top half) and put ingredients inside. Starting from bottom: half of the cheese, chicken slices (not diced), onions, peppers, remaining cheese, pepper, and red pepper flakes. i spread the pesto on the top bread and it soaked down into everything. I kept the loaf whole and insert into my large george forman but i had to squeeze it down a bit. it was perfect!!!!

This was delicious and so easy to personalize.   I used chicken breast lunch meat, baby spinach, red bell pepper with provolone cheese and added a smear of miracle whip to my basil pesto spread. I cooked on my stove top with a griddle.  Will make again.

Loved it!!  My husband (who can be quite picky) even said it tasted like something you would order from a restaurant.  I used the "Pesto Cream Sauce" from this site and it tasted wonderful together.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful and super easy! I used Italian sliced bread (but not the pepperidgefarm kind) lightly buttered top/bottoms. I used the Classico Basil Pesto and (deli) thinly sliced chicken. I've made this using deli turkey too and it was very good as well. This is a panini staple at our house now. The choice in cheese is perfect!

This is one of the BEST & most easiest panini recipes ever. For the cooked chicken I use Perdue shortcuts(southwestern or italian) and use deli roasted red pepper strips and it comes out awesome every time. Me and my hubby are addicted to these paninis. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were wonderful!  I can't wait to make these again.  We did not have Foccacia, so we used Cobs bread Pane di Casa ( a hard, chewy crust with dense texture.  I used Epicure's pesto mix.  Other changes were minor, like a bit of mayo and not dicing the onions and peppers, but thinly slicing them.  My 3 and 5 yr old also loved them!

My husband loves pesto, so I'm constantly trying to find different ways to use it. I love the idea of using it for a sandwich. I marinated my chicken in balsamic vinegar before grilling it and then slicing it thin. I preferred my sandwich with roasted red peppers and caramelized onions on it. Hubby liked his with just chicken, pesto and some provolone. I'll make these again, and I liked the idea of also using deli sandwich meat.

I grilled the onion and pepper first to soften them a bit. I used thick slices of a sourdough boule (buttered) and grilled it on the Foreman grill and they were fabulous. 
I made these to use leftover pesto we had from making pesto pizza. I would do it again anytime.

This was a GREAT recipe, but i changed the bread to whole wheat pre-sliced sour dough bread and i changed the chicken to thinly sliced turkey for faster food. It's also easier since I'm a kid if you use green and red peppers instead of onion.

Who needs Atlanta Bread with a recipe this good?? I bought a focaccia at Great Harvest Bread with spinach, tomato, red onion and parmesan on top (the top got a little mushy, but the bottom was crisp). Next time I'll buy a plain focaccia. I followed the recipe as written, but since I don't have a panini grill I used a square grill pan and kept the sandwich smushed together with a Pampered Chef stone.  Absolutely delicious!

very good.  Cooked the chicken in garlic and balsamic vinegar.  It might be a tad less messy to use sliced jack cheese and whole chicken breasts, but this recipe got rave reviews from my family, including two teenaged boys

This would have been much better if you actually have a panini grill. I wasn't impressed enough to go out and buy one so I won't be making this again.

Really liked this sandwich. I sautédthe pepper and onions first and then built the panini. It needed something sweet on it however. Some sweet and hot pickles or some pepper jelly would be good or even some sweet and hot jalapeños from a jar.

Very good blend of flavors and overall great panini.  I couldn't find anywhere that had focaccia bread so I substituted it with ciabatta buns.

awesome recipe.  sauteed the green pepper and red onion in a skillet a bit prior to assembling to minimize the crunch.  Used grilled thin-sliced chicken breast instead of diced.  Paired with a garden yellow squash for a beautiful meal

I did add somethings but basic recipe was great also. I added pepperoni with the chicken. I used a Sun-dried tomato pesto on some. I used sliced sourdough bread instead. I also grilled my onions and peppers (only had red available). I also added spinach. This is a great recipe to make or add items to make it your own. Delicious! See photo.

Very good.  Used some rotisserie chicken. Added some cream cheese to the basil and heated with the chicken. Separately I sautéed a whole onion thinly sliced and added red and green peppers at the end just to soften them a little. Used Parmesan cheese because that’s what I had.  Made this as a quesadilla and it was amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

I know people hate it when you change recipes but I don't think that these are huge changes.  Don't have a panini grill.   Foccacia seemed to 'bready' to me so I used pita pockets.  My roommate loves bell peppers, hates onions, I'm the opposite.  We chopped the chicken pretty small, mixed in the pesto, rather than spreading it on the sandwich, mixed in the shredded cheese, used our veggie of choice, wrapped in foil and into the oven for 15 - 20 minutes.  Soooo good.  Made them again the next day only I left the onion off of mine and liked it even better.  These are a great change.  Will make again many times, I'm sure.

I'm always looking for new and different ways to use boneless skinless chicken breast as we don't generally eat any other type of meat. It can get boring after a while. I made this as written except I sauteed the veggies for about 30 seconds before adding to the sandwiches. Grilled up on a panini press for the perfect finish, it was excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  A little seasoning is beneficial.  If you don't have a pannini grill try your waffle iron.  Makes interesting little toasty pockets.  :-)

I put some butter on my bread before putting in the press; other than that I didn't change anything. Was okay, I think maybe I"m not as big of a pesto fan as I thought.

I made these tonight, I used leftover grilled chicken from last night. They were amazing!  Great recipe. I followed it very close,  I used a lot of pesto basil spread though. And I had everything on hand in the fridge, it was delicious way to use leftovers.

Easy & yummy! I used sliced French bread because my local market didn't have focaccia. I plan on making this again!

Delicious! Used Classico pesto, sharp white cheddar (although most white cheeses would work). Also, used Tuscany Boulga bread from Smiths, and it tasted better than Zupa's. I pre-cooked the chicken (diced very small), peppers and onions, then added it to the pesto and put it on the sandwich for grilling.

I made this using leftover grilled chicken.  I didn’t make it as a panini, but just as a sandwich on a hamburger bun.  I also didn’t dice any of my ingredients, but sliced them instead.  I first toasted the bun under the broiler and then spread pesto on one side only.  I layered the ingredients and used pepperjack cheese.  This was good, but I’m not sure I liked the green pepper flavor with the pesto.  Just seemed a bit odd to me.

I used vienna bread.  I also added a little tomato and even some yellow mustard cause I just like the extra zing of yellow mustard.  No one else did the mustard in my house but EVERYONE loved these.

Delicious... However, I feel that it's missing something... Some kind of opposing element to balance out the flavor. Maybe sweet peppers?
I plan to make this a regular in our household. Thank you for sharing!

Loved this!! I made a couple of changes.  When cooking the chicken I added fresh garlic, salt and pepper.  When the chicken was cooked I added the peppers and onion and sauted them for a few minutes until tender.  It was wonderful!!

This was better than at a restaurant! I did change a few things tho just to make it more for my liking! I mixed the pesto with a little bit of mayo, I carmelized the onions before I put them on the sandwich. I also used mozzarella cheese, just because that's what I had on hand. It was really fantastic! Def a keeper :)

Oh my word this was delicious!  The only thing I changed was using roasted deli turkey instead of diced chicken, but I'm sure chicken would be just as tasty.  This was a very flavorful and easy dish!

These are good - I had to make a few (minor) changes based on what I had in the house, but very good (Pepper jack instead of plain Monterey Jack and an Italian Roll instead of foccacia) I don't have a panini press, but used my George Foreman and it worked out great. Next time I will leave it on longer than 5 minutes.

This is an amazing panini!  I used pesto, sliced deli chicken, and pepper jack cheese.  I'm not a raw onion fan and I didn't have a red bell pepper...but wow.  It was very good.  A definite keeper.

This is a really good and easy recipe. The only changes I made were I used the Orowheat sandwich thins instead of focaccia bread and used Provolone cheese. As others suggested, I used Pesto from Classico. It is quite good and comes in either the basil pesto or the sun dried tomato pesto if you want to spice it up a little. Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I both really liked these sandwiches.  We added a little cream cheese, used chicken lunch meat and left out the green pepper, just cause we don't really like it raw, and it was excellent.  We both thought it tasted like something you would get at a restaurant.

I made these for dinner and everyone LOVED them.  I couldn't find Focaccia so i used a loaf of Ciabatta and made smaller sandwiches but more of them.  I caramelized the red onions just a little and while I was grilling the chicken I grilled the green pepper at the same time. I also don't have a panini maker so I sprayed my grill with cooking spray, put it on low and grilled the paninis.

These were fantastic!  I made them with a yellow onion instead of red, and I sauteed the pepper and onion in a little olive oil to soften them up.  I used some foccacia from the store and slices of provolone instead of shredded cheese.  A great recipe to break in our new panini grill!

I made my modifications based on the other reviews. I used one small focciaca bread and one ciabatta, putting a small amount of pesto on one side and cream cheese on the other. I didn't have time to roast my red bell, but sauteed with red onion. Because I ran short on time from the day of grocery shopping, I took advantage of canned chicken. Was excellent.

We bought a panni grill / griddle last night so this was the first panini sandwich we made.  And wow, we were quite pleased.  I used a sturdy country white bread that I cut into thick slices.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  Hubby put a hot mango chutney on his 2nd sandwich to give it some 'oomph.  I love that you won't need butter or oil on the bread with the panini grill.  Excellent.

This was good. I made panini bread for the first time from scratch...very easy.  I grilled some chicken breasts and sliced them and used red pepper since that's what I had...delish.  The only thing I really did differently was I spread a little mayo on the panini before the pesto.

This was the best sandwich I've ever eaten; a must-try! I (like others) made a few tweaks to make it easier to eat. I used a thin breast instead of chopped chicken, and I replaced the red onion with sauteed mushrooms. I also mixed the pesto with some cream cheese to give it a bit of density. Thanks for sharing this!

I absolutely loved these! I used red instead of green pepper, personal preference. The family didn't care for the pesto though. I loved it!

These were excellent! I ended up sautéing peppers & onions, as I generally don't like onions -so this turned out supper yammy. I had few paninis left over and my friends that tried them absolutely loved it! Would highly recommend!

So easy and super delicious!  I tried both chicken and sliced turkey and found the turkey stays on little easier, especially on the slanted George Foreman. As a single graduate student, I love that I can easily get 4 meals out of one loaf of bread and some veggies. Will definitely be making this one again!

These were so good we ate them for three meals and my family still asked if there were any left. I didn't find the focaccia bread at my grocery store so I used a whole grain artisian bread and rotisserie chicken. Yum!

This is a delicious sandwich and easy!  I love that these are ingredients that I have on hand.  Thanks for a super sandwich and it will be great with soup this fall.

Nice and simple. My husband really liked it the way it was, but I thought it seemed to need a little something - sun-dried tomatoes, feta, roasted peppers? Didn't need to broil it because I used fresh Parmesan Focaccia Bread hot out of the oven. Yummmmmm
