Quick recipe to put together. Excellent combination of flavors. I added half a chopped unpeeled apple. Didn't have rice vinegar, instead used white vinegar. Substituted salted sunflower seeds for cashews and served in separate dish. Dressing just right. Well liked by all. gruvygram

My husband & I liked this very well.  To cut fat and calories, I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and Miracle Whip for the mayonnaise.   Also, I used red wine vinegar.  I will make this again soon.

I left out the sugar and used sour cream instead of mayonnaise because I don't like mayonnaise.  Also, I noticed in the subtitle the author refers to this recipe as s "super healthy salad."  Unless you are a doctor or nutritionist, you shouldn't go around throwing the healthy label on anything.  Great tasting salad, but I wouldn't call a salad with sugar and mayonnaise "healthy."

Great recipe for potlucks, etc that I've used three times now! Very quick and easy and tastes great! The blanching tip is great. I always receive compliments on the salad.

Great -- needed one without bacon. Still lots of flavor. Like many, used sunflower seeds as garnish rather than nuts. The quick blanching really is a good tip to reduce any bitterness in the broccoli. Thanks!

Having bagged, shredded broccoli in the fridge, I tried this as a quick lunch.  It is easy to make with bagged broccoli, colorful, crunchy, tart and sweet.  We ate half for lunch.  For the remaining half of this salad, I'll add a little more shredded carrot for color, and an apple for even more crunch as other reviewers have suggested.  A tart apple will offset some of the sweetness of the dressing.  I'll use less dressing on the remaining half of the salad for less sweetness and try a little less sugar when I make this again, or possibly use a different dressing.

Left out the bacon and the onions, used just sultana raisins, and only got a one hour marinating time. It was still delicious!

I made this and it was absolutely delicious.. I added cauliflower to the mix for color and more flavor, and everyone just loved it.. I was skeptical about the rice vinegar, but.. added it anyway and it gave it a wonderful zest, so make sure you DO add it.. I might add bacon the next time I make it, just to add MORE flavor.. a wonderful salad for home, office party OR church...

Did not add onion.  Used candied pecans 'cause I didn't have cashews, so it could have used less sugar.

Didn't see this recipe until after making the creamy bacon and broccoli salad.  I will use this one next time.  I use reduced fat mayo and slightly less than 1/4 cup sugar.  I like the idea of blanching the broccoli.  Used lightly toasted almond slivers instead of sunflower seeds.  Cannot wait to try this!

This is an awesome recipe! I left out the sugar and mixed the mayo with Ken’s Steakhouse Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing...really added some incredible flavor! And plenty sweet! Also, next time I won’t add the cashews the night before, but just before serving...they got kind of soft. Also added bacon bits just before serving, as they get soft as well.

There is a local restaurant that makes broccoli salad and I was looking to make one as close to theirs as possible. I made some slight changes to match their recipe, substituting almonds for cashews and fresh red grapes for the cranberries. It turned out exactly like like the restaurants! LOVE this recipe!!!

'Reduced sugar by 1T.  Slightly sweet, slightly tangy dressing.  It's a little thin, too, so continue to stir occasionally, as it refrigerates.

Only change I made was to use sunflower seeds instead of pecans, since that's what I had on hand. Perhaps some shredded cheese might be a nice addition. This was great!

I've tried many variations of broccoli salad and I felt this one was one of the best!  The combinations of flavor were perfect.  I did not use all of the dressing, which could have been due to the size of my broccoli heads, but this was a big hit at our Easter table this year.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, dragonfly099!

Excellent.  Just like a broccoli salad @ a upscale restaurant in town.
