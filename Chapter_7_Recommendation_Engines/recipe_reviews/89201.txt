This is pretty much what you would expect from a 'cream of whatever soup' recipe - nothing fancy, but quick, easy and tasty. The only thing I did differently was to sautee the onion in the bacon grease (I don't like boiled onions), and I also used Italian breadcrumbs with a little garlic powder mixed into it. Not bad at all. Thanks!

We really liked this recipe!!  I bought 1.75 lb of green beans, and by the time I had trimmed them I didn't seem to end up with too many..  SO, to compensate for the smaller amount of green beans, I only used 6 oz of Canadian bacon and only 1 can of cream of celery soup..  It is the perfect consistency!  I love the flavor that the Canadian bacon adds.  Oh, and rather than use bread crumbs for the topping I used crumbled crackers.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I can't wait to make again because it went waaaay too fast!  Next time I will buy 2.5 - 3 pounds of green beans!!

this is the perfect remedy for a cold autumn day! I only had about half the beans the recipe called for so I sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the canadian bacon and stirred fresh chopped tomato into the casserole as well. Next time think I may add a wee bit of garlic powder.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

we loved this side dish. i am always trying to find new ways of getting my carnivore of a boyfriend to eat more vegetables, and this recipe did the trick. he even liked it better than the traditional green bean casserole.

This had great flavor, I had some extra canadian bacon to use up so when I came accross this recipe I gave it a shot.  I used a can of green beans & a 1/2 bag of frozen veggies.  And of course I threw in some shredded cheese because everything is always better with cheese.  I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of cream of celery.

Good foundation.  Simple and satisfying.  
I added a few potatoes and carrots.

This was lovely!  I didn't have quite enough green beans and only mushroom soup so I made up the vegetable requirement with celery, to try and stay in keeping with the original recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The flavor of the Canadian bacon was lost in the beans. I didn't care for the bacon being in strips, either. It just didn't meld into a good consistency. I think this would have been much better if the bacon was chopped instead of sliced. This recipe was nothing more than your generic Campbells green bean casserole with out-of-place Canadian bacon strips. I will probably try this again using regular crumbled bacon as this is just a regular recipe. I don't feel the recipe warranted the very costly Canadian bacon. I will also cook a little longer. I like a bit of crispness in green beans, but these still tasted a bit like crunching on undercooked beans. Sorry, 3 stars is all that I could give.

We liked this ok, nothing real special but it's a different way to present green beans, which we eat often.

This was a little bland. I loved the slight crunch of the fresh green beans, but the flavor of the canadian bacon got lost in this dish.

Bland, but it was the 2nd best out of three recipes that I tried out that night. I think it just needed a bit more flavor, but it was still delicious and there was nothing wrong with it at all.

Really tasty, especially with homemade cream of celery soup instead of canned.  This is a step up from the usual green bean casserole.

Easy to make. My family noted that it needed more seasoning. Perhaps some minced fresh garlic.

Adding the bacon to the basic (and classic) Campbell's, is a real winner.
I put in half of a red bell pepper, diced, and lightly sauteed with the onions.  Added a bit of color.
- Also threw in a couple table spoons of Frank's Red Hot.

NEXT time, I'm going to put in a small jar of jalapenos and juice for a spicier version.

It was a big hit at a Men’s Superior Dinner .... an Australian tradition in which the men do the preparation and wait on our wives. The Mains portion recipes all came from your website..... very handy for questionable kitchen talent like me.

We really did not like this at all and cutting that much Canadian bacon into strips and cooking it was a pain. It just really did not have much flavor and looked unappealing as well. I followed the directions exactly. Bland bland bland!

This is a great foundation for many menu ideas! We tried it with cream of mushroom soup and chattel mushrooms we had frozen with peppers and left over ham. Needed to cook just a little longer but was great. Thank you.

This was a green bean casserole that tried to be different and did not make it --needed more seasoning and like others bacon would have added more flavoe
