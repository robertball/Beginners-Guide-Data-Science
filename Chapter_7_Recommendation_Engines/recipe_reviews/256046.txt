I never would have guessed that these would turn out so good with canned tomatoes. I added extra garlic only because I'm a garlic freak! Super easy to make and very delicious!

12.3.16   Honestly, I had my doubts about using canned tomatoes for bruschetta, but I was pleasantly surprised because these were good!  The fresh basil and healthy dose of garlic really ramp up the flavor.  This bruschetta was much better made with the canned tomatoes rather than the fresh (but mostly tasteless) tomatoes you buy this time of year.  Simply tastes like good, old classic bruschetta.

These were amazing! I fried my bread in butter and olive oil both sides and then put the tomato mix on top… They were delicious!!

I actually really enjoyed this recipe. It's so simple and tasty, especially with the canned tomatoes because they are softer and sweet. I'd maybe get rid of the pepper though, a little spicy. I also added a little parmesan on top. I recommend!

What an easy, delicious appetizer. This was the first time I have prepared bruschetta, so I wasn't sure what it was going to taste like.  I loved the combination of basil, olive oil, and tomatoes.  I am adding this recipe to my party menu.

I didn't think I was going to like this recipes as much as I do.  I love fresh tomatoes and usually never have canned tomatoes in my cupboard.  That's going to change.  The tomatoes were firm, ripe, and tasted great.  Adding garlic and fresh basil made the dish exceptional.  When I make it again I will refrigerate the tomatoes first.  I love the contrast of hot bread and cold bruschetta.

The only reason I made this recipe was because I was looking for an easy appetizer that didn't contain cheese.  Truth be told, neither my husband nor I like Bruschetta very much.  But WOW!  This was fantastic!!  I think part of the reason it was so good is because the bread is sliced on the thick side and isn't toasted until it's as hard as a rock.  The tomato topping was very easy to make and can be prepared in advance.  I served it to company and got many compliments.  This will be one of my mainstays in the future!

So easy!  I love bruschetta and always order it out. Now I can make it at home for a snack, party hours d’oeuvres or dinner party appetizer.

Made this recipe for Christmas Eve. It was a real hit. The only addition I made was a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to a doubled batch of the recipe.

Quick and tasty. Surprisingly the canned tomatoes had a very fresh taste. Added a touch of shredded parm to the top.

I always make homemade bruschetta and was a bit hesitant using canned tomatoes to make bruschetta. To my surprise this was very good. Extremely easy and quick to make. The tomatoes tasted very fresh giving the bruschetta a nice tomato taste. I did feel the bruschetta was lacking something and could benefit from drizzling a balsamic glaze over top or parmigiana cheese. Great recipe to have for surprise guest or a quick appetizer.
