My wife made this for our family of 5 - all of our kids loved it. My opinion may be biased, due to the fact that it was made by the most amazing, beautiful, loving and caring woman who also happens to be a fantastic cook, but these chops rock. Cant wait to have them again! :)

I really enjoyed this recipe, I however baked my pork chops instead of grilling them. I baked them at 350 for 50 mins, flipping halfway through. I cooked them in marinade and used it on rice. It is delicious! I love red chili paste, mine is made with garlic. I used almost a full tablespoon for two breasts. I like spicy :)

The first thing out of my husband's mouth when he took his first bite was "fantastic!". I followed the recipe exactly, except scaled it down to 2 pork chops. For those of you who like a little heat, you could increase the red chili paste. As written, there is no heat, just lots of wonderful flavor. This marinade would be good on just about ANYTHING!  Into my favorite's file this recipe goes! Thanks!

Amazing!!  I substituted cayenne pepper for the roasted red chili paste because I did not have any.  Very flavorful and made the pork super tender!!!

This is a keeper for sure.  I marinated fairly thick chops and cooked on the grill -until the internal temp was about 145 degrees.   Covered them with foil and allowed to rest while I prepared stir fried rice.    I sliced the chops very thin and served on top of the stir fried rice.  Full of flavor and a really quick and delicious meal.

Made 7 bone-in chops. Marinated in refrigerator for 1 1/2 hours. Followed recipe minus the chili paste. Used about 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of it. Baked WITH THE marinade at 350, covered (loosely) with foil for 25 min, turned chops, baked another 30 minutes, covered. Took foil off, added 2 tsp cornstarch and stirred in. Baked at 400 for 10 more minutes. Served with fried rice (w/ peas and carrots) and steamed broccoli (with crushed garlic croutons and fresh grated parmesan cheese) Perfect!!!

As many suggested of using less Soy Sauce,which I did,this was enjoyed  by everyone. Went with half amount of the soy sauce, I had 1 green onion to use up, I sliced it and added to the marinate. I broiled the meat, and thickened the marinate and added mushrooms, served over white rice with a side if mixed peas & carrots. This is a keeper :) (marinated for a couple hours)

This is fantastic IF you cut the soy sauce in half.  I used the 3 serving version and it more than enough for 3 pork chops.  I pan fried for 7 mins each side.  It was moist and flavorful with a slight kick.  I served with Asian mashed potatoes.

This had great flavor. Next time I will marinate it longer! Just a tip: Molasses mixed with white sugar makes a great sub for brown sugar. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! Really tasty. I also substituted Cayenne Pepper because I didn't have any red paste handy. I broiled the chops in the marinade for 20 minutes on each side - not too close to the broiler. It was moist, juicy and flavorful. I'll make it again and I'll try the marinade with ribs.

Following other reviewers comments I baked these at 350.  They didn't need the full 50 minutes but that may have been because they were thinner.  I cooked the marinade with a tablespoon of flour mixed with some water and served it with rice and corn.  The sauce on its own was a bit too much, but with the pork chops it was pretty good.  I reduced the chili paste since I was serving it to a 4 yr old and someone who doesn't like spice.  But it was very good and we'll be making it again!

I used all ingredient except for the chili paste because I had none.  I also marinated 6 thin pork chops for about 2 hours.  It was the best Pork chops I have ever had.

Good, but almost identical to another marinate for salmon. I'm going to use the other one instead since we like that one better. I did reduce the amount of soy sauce & it still overpowered the flavor. You could taste the saltiness from the soy sauce.

This marinade was excellent.  I marinated mine for a couple days and have to say the flavor had penetrated throughout the meat.  I am not a huge fan of pork chops because everyone cooks them to death and they end of dry.  This marinade kept them moist!!  This is a keeper.

For the marinade, I used fresh ginger salad dressing instead of ginger, ground garlic (because I was out of fresh), and used Sriracha and cayenne because I like it spicy. Marinaded for an hour turning halfway through. I baked 4 1-inch thick boneless pork chops in a baking dish at 350 for 40 minutes (turning at the halfway mark), and they were perfect. I too was worried about the saltiness even with low-sodium soy sauce, but I think baking them mellowed out the saltiness so many people have talked about. I took out the chops, added a little corn starch to the remaining liquid and put it back in the oven for 5ish minutes to thicken. Very tasty! Thank you :-)

Excellent!  My husband and I loved this.  Made the marinade exactly as listed.  When we put the chops on the indoor grill, I brought the left over marinade to a boil while they were cooking and used it as a dipping sauce.  (If you do this, you must boil it at least 5 minutes)  I think I will increase the chili paste next time...and there will definitely be a next time.  Great recipe.

I followed the recipe and marinated the chops for half a day.  As it's winter in Tasmania, I baked rather than put on the barbie, covering with foil for 25 min, turned them and baked for another 25 min at 180 degrees (350F).   Added 2 tsp of Cornstarch to marinade and cooked for a further 10 min.  This was a big hit with the family and served with fried rice...Its a keeper -thanks!

I've made this twice now! SO GOOD!! I follow the marinade steps and throw it all into a crock pot instead of grilling... The way the marinade soaks in and makes the chops perfectly cooked and tender..amazing. I serve it with white rice, and at the end when I take the chops out of the crock pot, I throw a little bit of corn starch in with the extra marinade (now hot from being cooked) to make a sauce to pour over the rice and chops. If you want to impress family with happy and full bellies, make this! You won't be disappointed. (P.s. I use siracha sauce because I've never had chili paste in the house, and I find it's a great sub for chili paste)

Following jadie's suggestion, I baked it in the marinade instead of grilling. It was great! I left the chili paste out for the kids, but I'd make it with it if they were not going to be having it. I'm sure it'd be great!
This was a big hit. My husband loved it, and my kids asked for seconds. Unbelievable!

These were very good; moist and tender.  However, I used low sodium soy sauce and still found them to be a bit on the salty side.  I would reduce the amount of soy sauce next time.  Other than that I followed the recipe except I bumped up the amount of garlic and chili paste.  Very good recipe!

I made the recipe as is, even though typically I agree with reviews (and follow them) posted at Allrecipes concerning recipe alterations. The amount of soy sauce does need to be cut down (some here said it was overpowering). Although the marinade is still good, I'd cut the soy sauce to 3/4 or even 1/2 cup (haven't tried this alteration yet, mind you). The spiciness was right for me. I do like my food "hot", but I enjoyed the interplay of flavors. Oh, also...I used chicken instead of pork. I marinaded my chicken breasts for about an hour and then baked them for 45 minutes. This recipe is a keeper, with some slight tinkering.

The flavor was good but way too salty! Maybe next time, I’ll use low sodium soy sauce.

Instead of using this on pork chops, I diced some pork sirloins and used this marinade. Later I used the pork in a fried rice recipe. The pork turned out amazing!

I eliminated the roasted red chili sauce and added 1/2tsp of red peper flakes.   Also added 1T each of  Murin and Natural Rice Wine vinegar.   Then grilled as per recipe.  It was very good and  I've added this recipe to my personal recipe book.  Thanks Val!  Also, used my vacu-seal to infuse flavor throughout.  There was alot of sauce left over which I discarded.

Love this marinate. 
I did not have roasted red chili paste so I used oelek sambai (might be same, doesn’t say roasted). Also, doing keto so used Swerve, brown Sugar replacement.
  I fried in pan as I don’t have a grill.  I only used a small portion of the sauce,   as I only cooked one chop.  Next day I marinated 2 pieces of cod.  It is also good with fried cauliflower rice.
I might use a low sodium soy sauce or liquid aminos.

These were by far the best pork chops! I used rack of pork that I cut into thick chops and marinated overnight. Then threw them on the BBQ. So delicious! You will not be disappointed...

Good flavor, although I didn’t have enough soy sauce so I mixed in Worcestershire (not sure if this small change made the sauce better).   Next time I will use the grill or the oven because this time I threw everything in the crock pot and could see how th sauce would have been even better when heated differently.

It came out amazing I substituted chili powder instead of chili paste, minced garlic instead of cloves And I added sesames.  Preheated the oven and Baked  at 350 for 50 mins. Flipping it after 20mins. Delicious.

It is a good, flavourful recipe. If you are careful when it comes to sodium intake, I might suggest using low sodium soy sauce. Also, less cumin (the flavour works yet seems a touch out of place an Asian cuisine). And if you do not have ground ginger, use fresh as I did.

Way too much soy sauce, it took away from any other flavor of the pork chop and marinade. Would probably taste a lot better with less soy sauce, I'll make it again in the future, but will modify the recipe as I see fit.

I recommend brining the pork 15-20 minutes (in cold water, splash of white vinegar and pinch of salt), drying  it before putting in marinade which I do for overnight -so tender!

I really loved this. The only consistency I used was the soy sauce and oil. I added what spices I had from the list and some Thai Seasoning too. The marinating is the important part. I marinated for 1 1/2 days and it was the best pork chop I ever ate.

I used 8 boneless chops and made a few additions to the marinade.  I added a few drops of chili oil, sesame oil and fish sauce along with 1/8c of Oyster Sauce, 1/4c of MIrin, and 1tsp each of rice wine and black vinegar, 1 Tbsp of  Unagi (eel sauce) and 1 Tbsp each of red and green sriracha.  I let it marinade for a few hours turning 1/2 way through.   While the chops grilled I reduced the leftover sauce.  Everything was great.

I have made this more than a few times  and I always let it sit over night and grill the next day.  It is amazing.  I would suggest marinating at least all day at least. But either way it is a 5 star !!  Thanks.

This turned out incredible!!  I halved the soy sauce as other's recommended and subbed Cayenne for Chili sauce, since I didn't have any. I used 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne and it still had a bit of a kick for my liking (I really can't handle much spice - but my husband loved it!)  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. Marinated my meat about half the day. It was so flavorful and tender. We absolutely loved it and will definitely be making it again.

OMG! These were amazing!  So much flavor! I used thin pork chops as that was what I had on hand, pounded them, marinated for a couple hours and then grilled them 2-3 minutes on each side (just enough to given them a nice char). My spouse raved about them!!!! :) A keeper to be sure! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

We made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! We also decided to bake it in the oven and followed the 350 degrees, 50 minutes suggestion (flipping the chops after 25 minutes). We substituted the cumin with cayenne pepper and used hot and sweet chili sauce instead of chili paste. The sauce was superb!! Definitely will make this again!

12.29.16 Since we’re not crazy about super sweet foods these days, I did cut back the amount of brown sugar, and the cumin seemed excessive to me, particularly for an Asian dish, so I cut that back, as well.  I put the chops in the marinade mid-afternoon for an evening dinner grilling, and they turned out well.

Excellent recipe. Admittedly I tweaked it just a bit. I used 2/3C of low sodium soy sauce, and it seemed to me this  added a just right amount of salt. I  migh cut back the cumin to 2/3T on the next go round - and maybe boost the ginger a little. 

All in all. this is an easy, great tasting recipe and I can see it will be  repeated here many times.

Was what you would expect from the description.  The soy was a tad overwhelming but the dish was good and flavorful.  I would make it again with a little less soy sauce.

Delicious! Used only half a cup of soy sauce and added 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Had some fresh ginger that I used instead of ground. 
Seared the chops and finished them off in the oven. Everything got devoured ???? will definitely be making this again!

The cumin was out of place in this marinade. It was overpowering, and really shouldn't be in an Asian marinade anyway. I think a lot of people are mistaking the cumin for saltiness.  There are many other very similar recipes to this, without the cumin.  I recommend trying one of them instead, or at least cutting the cumin to a teaspoon.

This marinade is very yummy. I followed this recipe except I cooked it in a pan instead of a grill. I did not find it too salty; but then again I love soy sauce. My suggestion for those that love spicy, use more than 1 tablespoon. It tastes great as is, but next time I make it I will add more chili paste. Thank you for the recipe.

Porkchops turned out flavorful! I took the advice of some reviewers and cut the soy sauce to half of what the recipe called for. I didn't have the chilli garlic paste so I used cayenne pepper. I think if I used the chili paste it would have added more flavor. But other wise this was a very tasty meal. I baked the chops in the oven at 350 for 30mins. It came out perfect.

Great marinade, I also substituted sriracha for the chili paste and also left out the cumin. I marinated for 1 hour then added marinade and 6 thin pork chops and baked for 45 minutes at 350. Delicious!! All in the house enjoyed!!

I loved this recipe!  Super easy to make, and so flavorful.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I also added around 2 tablespoons of honey to the mix. This recipe is a keeper!

I loved it and so did a picky 3y/o. I didn't have the red chile paste so I used some crushed dried red pepper in a lower quantity than described. Came out great. I grilled it  with charcoal and hickory wood. I also used low sodium soy sauce.

I tried this with low sodium soy and marinated thick chuck roast and 8 pork chops for a little over 1/2 an hour. The pork chops were really salty but they were kinda thin, the chuck roast was much better (still salty) and the flavors were good. I cooked the first 2 chops in a pan and tasted the finished product. Salty but edible. The next few chops I lightly rinsed in running water and tossed in a pan with a bit of oil spray. MUCH BETTER! Served everything with white rice & sauteed asparagus. Definitely worth a second go but with half the soy and add some olive oil and more ginger (I like my ginger).

Easy and delicious. I used siracha hot sauce in place do the chili paste since I didn't have any on hand. Let marinated for several hours, cooked on grill pan. Served with pineapple fried quinoa from this site. Husband was very pleased!

Family really enjoyed this one. Finding something different than just plain pork chops is nice. We are surely going to be eating this one again!

YUM!! I really liked this recipe - very easy to make! The only change was that I used fresh grated ginger - I try using fresh ingredients as much as possible and since I just bought some the night before I thought I would add it instead of the powder. We marinated the pork chops overnight and baked them instead as the temperature outside was a bit too chilly for BBQ. Very good recipe and super easy!

I literally throw these ingredients together, minus the chili paste, for a lot of my beef and pork dishes.  I just adjust the spices to compliment the meat.  I love the flavors.  The chili paste gives it a nice kick, which is what I can't avoid in so many of my meals.  I love spices.  I did use grated fresh ginger, though, because I love the  bolder flavor it gives.

We just had this for dinner this evening, mmmmmmm! My sister, who's not a big foody, is still talking about it as she cleans up the leftovers (she's even saving the drippings and pouring them over the leftovers lol)! The only thing I think it was missing was a little more salt, but other then that yummmmm!

A little different, but very tasty. I served these with buttered potatoes and home canned green beans! Yummy!

Good marinade...grilled chops are the best way to eat them.  If you get your chops too thick the marinade won't penetrate, so beware of that.

I didn't have the red pepper sauce so I substituted cayene pepper. I had 4 chops so I halved the ingredients and it worked great. These are spicey.

These were very tasty. I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut soy in half and added ¼ cup olive oil. Used bone in chops and let them sit in the fridge for about 6 hours. Next time I will use more ginger and try a little more chili paste as it was not spicy at all.

Well it is a hit for me...I did some changes to it...did not had any cumin, so didn't add any. Instead of chili paste I added half a tea spoon of cayane pepper...
My serving was 12. added only 100 mill of soy sauce, sliced some onions in it to. used only 1/3 of cup regular sugar(didn't had any brown) and added half a tea spoon of curry.

After marinade I baked te meat in the owen and used the sauce from marinade to cook some mushroums in it. For the side I made plain rice...can't wait for the diner to hear what my family thinks.
