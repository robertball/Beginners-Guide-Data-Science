This was absolutely delicious, easy to prepare, and what a labor saver!  I added garlic salt and some black pepper, but otherwise this recipe went un-amended.  I really liked the texture / consistency and have already recommended it to three of my friends!

I gave this 4 stars mostly out of ease.  This is one of the easiest, fastest main dishes I have made off this site and it was GOOD.  It wasn't creamy as others have mentioned, but it was still really tasty. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that mine came out really greasy.  I think I will cut down the butter next time.  I also added some pepper, because that is what I like.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe for a busy night.  Pop it in the oven and forget about it.

This recipe was SO easy! We followed the recipe and it was great. It was creamier due to the cottage cheese, but it is baked mac and cheese so of course it's going to be drier. We covered it until the last 5 minutes or so. Will do again!

Great warm comfort food.  This recipe is very similar to one I had.  Difference being the bread crumbs on top.  Had company tonight and the pan was gone.  I baked this in an 7 x 11 pan.  When you add the macaroni mixture to the pan, cover with about 2 3/4 cups of boiling water.  Don't stir.  Cover with foil for 30 minutes - after 30 minutes gently chop the spoon through the mixture and bake uncovered for about 30 more minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I followed directions exactly, but it was a watery mess after being in the oven for an hour -- I had to cook it for one hour longer.  Even then it was kinda runny.  Also, the crumb crust actually SANK.  I think I will seek out a recipe that is much more specific about the amount of liquid.     I would have given it one star ... BUT!  I keep everything. I never throw anything away.  So I stored this in the refrigerator overnight (after it was cooked and partly served), and YOWSAH!  It was firm, and when sliced and reheated, quite YUMMY.  So I'd have to say, plan to cook it longer, and if possible cook it a day ahead.

I can't believe how easy this was.  This is my new potluck dish because it's so easy and so unhealthy that I only want to eat one portion of it!  I added frozen peas and will add broccoli next time too.  I will try half the butter next time and lowfat cottage cheese.

My kids hated this mac and cheese...I followed the recipe perfect and it came just 'ok'. It is not creamy and cheesy at all.

The only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars is because it was very greasy. You don't need butter/margarine if you grease the pan with spray. If available, use 2% cheese. This recipe is the most sensible way to make mac and cheese (not boiling macaroni) and I use it as a base.

This was sooo easy to make.  I did a couple of things different.  I also put sharp cheddar in the recipe. (Never too much cheese!!)  I did not put bread crumbs on top, I put shredded parmesan cheese on top of the last 15 minutes.  I also stirred 2 times while it was cooking.  Soo easy and good!!

If you want this to be creamier and cheesier, then add more water and cheese to your liking. this will be drier since it is a baked cafeteria style mac and cheese, not creamy like the boxed kind!

I made this yesterday as part of my Thanksgiving Buffet.  It was not only the easiest dish to prepare it was excellent.  I did not alter anything and I will be using this as my standard mac and cheese recipe in the future.

This was cheesalicious! It was very creamy and cheesy...quite filling and satisfying...most of my family really liked it & there were no leftovers. I used a full package of whole wheat elbow macaroni and also added 3 cans of tuna to the mix. Instead of bread crumbs, I used saltines, but they turned soggy (no big deal). I gave 4 stars because the recipe could have been a bit more specific (about the water amount, for example). If I make this again, I may put a little less water...either that or leave it in longer so it would be a little more crispy. All in all, it's an easy, tasty meal with little cleanup!

Need to put an approximate amount of water to cover noodles. I must have used way too much (even though i followed the recipe and just covered the mixture) bc the water never all boiled off.

This came out perfect and creamy (I added a little more cheese and some milk in addition to the water). I added the correct amount of butter and it all cooked in and made it perfect.

Amazingly easy and so good! I made this last night for my kids and they loved it. I mixed everything in the same dish I cooked it in for ease in cleanup. Next time I might add chicken.

what did i do wrong?!?  once everything was stirred together i knew it wouldn't fit into my glass 2qt casserole, so i used my pampered chef stone bowl then added the water and used only 1-1/2 tbsp marg.  after one hour the noodles were softer but not any bigger and still so much water! after 2 hrs bigger noodles and still lots of water and cheese still looking like shredded not melted! hour 3...big fat noodles like i had envisioned covered by at least an inch of grease....ladled off alot than stirred and left the lid off for another half hour.  didn't love the cottage cheese "curds" texture but pulled up my tuffet and had a few bowls, added canned salmon and cheeze whiz the next day.....maybe i will half the recipe and put into my glass casserole, or a glass 9x13, and will try with creamed cottage cheese or sour cream...i will blame the mess on the stoneware because this recipe worked for everyone else.

This recipe was okay. It was very easy, not as cheesy as we like, I did add a dash of ground mustard plus some garlic powered. If I make again I'll use less water and more cheese.

I followed the recipe, but I used one 8oz bag of Mild Sharp Cheddar and one 8oz bag of Colby Jack cheeses.  I think I will crush up Ritz crackers instead of using the breadcrumbs in the top.

Followed the instructions and ingredients exactly except I substituted plain yogurt for the cottage cheese since I didn't have any.  This went together quickly and was easy to clean up since I mixed the ingredients in my baking dish.  It wasn't as creamy as I would have preferred, but this could have been because of the missing cottage cheese.  Next time I make this I'll use the cottage cheese and will try using half milk and half water to see if that increases the creaminess a bit.  I used small shells instead of the elbows, which I'm assuming would have similar cooking times.  This dish could be made using any pasta, you'd just have to alter the baking times.  The taste was very cheesy, not at all greasy and it ended up with a nice, crispy browned bottom and sides.  If tweaking this recipe a bit to get the desired creaminess I want works, I won't be going back to boiling my pasta first.  This method is easier to clean up and is prepped and finished in less time, so this makes it a winner in my book.

This was so simple and so good.  I put three cheeses in, just picking the three that I had.  I didn't measure anything! And I used milk instead of water. At the end, the macaroni had absorbed all the liquid it could, so I just put in a little cornstarch mixed in water for a few minutes. Wonderful. Had some cold later on and still yummy.
