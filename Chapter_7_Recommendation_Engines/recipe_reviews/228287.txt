A very simple sauce that is easy to make and not overly sweet, which is our preference.  I added a pinch of kosher salt, and next time Iâ€™ll add some espresso powder just to enhance the dark chocolate flavor.

I used this for the fudge centre of a homemade, Dairy Queen-style ice cream cake and it was super good.

This turned out great! Thicker and gooier than I could have ever imagined (this is a good thing)! My husband and I LOVE Dove chocolate. So I substituted all of the chocolate with Dove Promises.  I did half milk chocolate (4 oz.) and half dark chocolate (for the other 4 oz.). Melted quickly, and very smooth. This is a foolproof recipe! Know that, likely, any chocolate could work.. so I'd recommend using your favorite or even what you have on hand for convenience!

This is the best hot fudge recipe I've found, and it turned out better than I hoped. Super delicious! I'm going to have a hard time not making this every week.

I used unsweetened chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips.  It was thick, really thick :)  I decided to cut it down with some left over coffee.  This recipe is great and easy!

I made this exactly as written, and it came out great.  Wouldn't change a thing. Everyone loved it and there was none left to take home.  Have to make more for myself.

Wow! Absolutely the easiest recipe I've ever made and boy is it yummy.  I just bought some Smuckers Hot Fudge and this is just as good and a heck of a lot cheaper.  Well done, Bonnie.
