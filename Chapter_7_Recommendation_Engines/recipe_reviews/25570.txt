The cake is very good, I used semi-sweet chocolate and a chocolate mocha frosting.  I only had 1 cup of milk so it did come out a little dry maybe also because it needed more than 30 min bake time, but overall quite good, easy to make although I have never heard of not creaming sugar and butter/shortening together rather than adding the sugar to the flour mixture to sift!  That was strange to me

I substituted cocoa for the melted chocolate and frosted it with buttercream and coconut. It turned out great.

I was very disappointed with this cake.  It was very dry and dense with little flavor.  Even sweet peanut butter frosting could not save it!!!  :(
