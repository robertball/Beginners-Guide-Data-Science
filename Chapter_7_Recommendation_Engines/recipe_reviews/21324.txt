Southerners use real Mayo, like Duke's or Hellman's.  this calls for more pimiento than needed, use half as much.  Adding a little cayenne is great, too.

Yesterday I purchased a quart of Pimento Cheese from the local Fresh Market for a party.  It cost me $15.00!  It was good but I thought I can do better for less!  Besides I still needed more pimento chesse for the party.  So, I choose to use pre-grated cheese, one (8oz) Sharp Cheddar and one (8oz) mixed Cheddar and Monterey Jack (it was on sale).  For some reason pimentos come in 2 oz ($.99), 4 oz ($1.29) and 7 oz ($1.59) jars.  I decided to use the 7 oz. since it was the best value.  I chopped the pimentos fine, used less salad dressing than called for and spiced it up with some hot sauce and a generous dash of Worcestershire Sauce.  I did a side by side comparison and I think my homemade is better than the expensive store bought stuff.  I wonâ€™t be paying someone else to make mine any more!  Give it a try this recipe is pretty good.

I've tried lots of recipes, but this one is closest to the best!  I replaced one cup of the Colby cheese with one cup of Monterrey Jack w/ jalapenos in it.  It gave it a great little spicy kick.  Great with baguette slices!

delicious! a little heavy on the pimento's. next time I'll just use one jar. I also recommend running the pimento's through a chopper to make them a little finer.

This was very delicious!  My husband wanted me to buy the store brand, and was skeptical when I said I was making it from scratch.  Of course, HE LOVED IT, and couldn't get enough.  We took it with us when we went camping.  Unfortunately, my young children didn't care for it.  I did substitute mayo for the MW.  We're not fans of MW-too sweet.  If I were to do this over again, I would half the recipe.  It makes alot.  Otherwise, very scrumptuous.

This is great. Down south we love our Dukes Mayo and it taste great in this. For Halloween, I used a cookie cutter and cut out round slices of pumpernickle bread. I spread the pimento cheese inside the sandwiches and cut holes for eyes, nose and mouth. They were so cute!

Mom's recipe, with the exception of the Colby (she used all cheddar). Wonderful comfort food. This is also good with thin bread as hors d'oeurves...just make the sandwich as usual, add a bit of lettuce, spinach or arugula, and then cut into 4 triangles. How quick is that???

Awesome recipe.  I used up several different kinds of shredded cheese I had on hand and everyone loved it.  Said it was better than the deli and I had to give the recipe to everyone

Great stuff.  We use mayo instead of miracle whip and eat it with toasted french bread slices.  Also, we add jalepenos to spice it up sometimes.  And, my favorite - grill it like a grilled cheese sandwich.  So good with tomato soup.

Just as advertised, quick and easy! This is very tasty too! I made this for lunch today and my hubby regaled me of stories of his youth when his grandmother and mother used to make this for him (I had no idea!). I halved the recipe, used a little less of Miracle Whip LITE than it called for. Added too much salt (my wrist got carried away). Used all cheddar, no colby. Thanks for the post Shannon!

tastes JUST like Fresh Market's pimento cheese that they sell for $6 (at a fraction of the cost) if you use thickly grated sharp cheddar only.

I halved the recipe and used Velveeta shreds (couldn't find small portions of colby) and medium cheddar.  I used about 3.5 ounces of pimentos and two-three heaping tablespoons of real mayo.  Just enough to pull the mixture together and not be too wet.

This is The recipe you're looking for, if you're trying to find what it was your grandmother used to make. Mayo or MW depending upon your preference. I agree, half the pimentos. Perfect!

Very easy and very good. Use different cheese instead of colby to change flavor.

This is a great base for all kinds of variations.  I agree that I like mayo instead of salad dresssing. I make this recipe a lot.  My favorite variation is using white sharp cheddar, adding minced garlic and dill.  Sometimes I dont't even include the pimentos.  Serve this on a nice sourdough or other artesian bread.  My brother even uses his for grilled cheese sandwhiches.

Way too good to be so easy!!!  I haven't had pimento cheese in months since I moved from NC to PA and didn't have my favorite grocery store deli pimento, but this is just as good!!  I used Hellman's low fat mayonnaise and it is fantastic.  Even with having to shred the cheese myself, it still only took 5 minutes!  Costs way less than I paid before and makes a ton more!  I serve it with baguette slices or bagel crisps.

I made this last night. I cut this in half for just me, used mayo (Miracle Whip is sacriledge....gross) and added just a touch of Frank's Hot Sauce. Stuffed this into stalks of celery. GRUB.
I can't stop eating it, and my kids were clamoring to get at it. This one's a keeper.

Loved this recipe.  Only changes I made were...only used 1 jar pimentos and added 2 chopped boiled eggs.  I am born and raised in the south and believe me I would not use Mayo in this recipe.  YUCK  I actually don't know anyone who actually uses Mayo.  lol  I just served on saltine crackers and everyone loved it

My first batch turned out just "OK" because I used real mayo like some others suggested.  I made it again, and instead used the salad dressing (and also added fresh ground pepper and a bit of garlic) and it was GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Taste much better than the stuff you buy premade in the store.  I used all cheddar cheese 3 1/2 cups and 3/4 cup mayo.  So a little less cheese and mayo because I wanted a little more peper flavor.

This require A LOT of pimentos. I would halve the pimentos used. Also, used only mild cheddar (hubby doesn't like sharp). Definitely use again. Taste like the good old classic.

This was delicious. I opted to use mayonnaise rather than Miracle Whip, although I am generally a user of Miracle Whip only on sandwiches. I followed a suggestion from some of the other reviewers and added a dash of Worchestershire sauce. Price's won't be getting my business anymore. Thanks for the easy and quick recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars for its ease and flexibility! I made it for a party, and it was a hit. I look forward to making it again and trying different ways of changing it. I used MW and added some chopped white onions and garlic powder. Next time, I think I'll add chopped green peppers for a little more color and texture.

I sent my husband after pimentos to make this dip and he came home with a jar of processed pimento spread; so I used that and not as much mayo--we loved it. We served it with corn chips and tortilla chips. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe Shannon!

This isn't really a review of the posted recipe since I had to substitute reg mayo for the MW and monterey jack for the colby. Plus I added a tablespoon of horsradish and 2 tablespoons grated yellow onion. I don't have a food processor and wanted it creamier so I put the finished product in a ziplock and let it sit in a bowl of hot water for 5 mins or so to melt the cheese a little. Worked well. ANyway.. I'm giving it 5 stars because I've made this recipe as posted before and know it's very good. I personally like it with a little kick thus the horseradish. 
Don't you hate it when someone changes around everything in the recipe and then gives it a bad review? lol 
Mainly just wanted to post my additions in case anyone was curious. Pimento cheese on white bread goes very well with a bowl of chili by the way, used to have it as a kid and still love it just as much. I think it's a southern thang.

Deeeelish!  I made this as finger sandwich filling & took to a ladies luncheon and it was fabulous.  Since it was to be consumed by adults I added a little shredded green pepper and some hot sauce.  It is the exact amount needed for a 20 slice loaf of bread.  Very, very good and very, very easy. :)

This recipe is so simple and so good.  My mom always bought the store brand or from the deli.  This is just as good and fresh.  I like the hot pimento cheese spread I used to eat as a kid, so I added some red pepper flakes.  A definate addition to my recipe book.

This is really good - try a little ground red pepper to give it a kick.  I thought it was just as good as the high priced stuff from the gourmet market.

We liked this but I guess we just prefer mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip.  We like to use it as a dip for Fritos.

I am only giving this four stars because I made such drastic changes to it, my changes may not be "quick and easy" though but are great additions for my personal tastes.  I grated 4 cups of colby cheese, added a dash of cayenne to that, 4 sliced green onions, salt and pepper, and a 4 oz. jar of pimentos, drained.  To that I added 3/4 cup of homemade mayo.  That was just 1 egg and 1T of lemon juice in a food processor, slowly drizzle in 3/4 of a cup to 1 cup of olive oil, depending on consistancy and then salt and pepper that.  (That mayo will make over 1 cup though) Mix everything together and it is AWESOME!!!  This would be great with the big toasted crouton things that you can buy or make.

Tasty recipe, I will add finely chopped white onion next time; and increase the 
mayo, I used less than the receipe called for. It's really quick if you buy shredded
cheese, I shredded the colby and cheddar I think block cheese has better flavor.

Very good, however, it did not had the cheese flavor I was wanting. I will cut the Colby cheese by half and increase cheddar cheese by same amount. I will used extra sharp cheddar.

A very easy and tasty recipe.  My husband and father love it. We did use a 5 year aged super sharp cheddar instead of sharp. And it was Delicious. Will definitely go into my recipe box.

I'm on a quest lately to find the perfect homemade pimento spread since the stuff you buy in a tub has trans fat in it.  I make a version of my own that usually has someone asking for the recipe but I wanted to try others.  This one has lots of pimentos which I like but it calls for Miracle Whip and in most of the South, that's sacrilege.  We Southern cooks use real mayo...it makes a huge difference. I think, not to be stuck up but I am going to stick with my recipe and I think I'll post it soon.

Pretty good.  I used some cream cheese I had (about 2 oz) and added a little mayo to the Miracle Whip since I did not have enough of it.  And, I added a little sugar and a sprinkle of garlic powder to better suit my tastes.  Seems like it is missing something, but I checked other recipes, but they had nothing else in them.

This recipe is fantastic.  I used just enough Miracle Whip light to moisten the cheese and used half of the cheese and one jar of pimentos.  I was very surprised it tasted exactly like the 'real stuff'!

Just made this, minus the pimentos, and it makes a tasty snack. Just a smidge on a multi-grain cracker along with a few olives or (my fave) sweet gherkins and you're good to go. I'm thinking about adding some paprika to give it a kick and may try it in sandwich form on some toasted multi-grain bread with cold, sliced grilled chicken.

I did not care for this recipe. Disappointing. Even tried it without the miracle whip and used good mayo instead.

DELICIOUS!  I fixed this for my daughter's graduation party and it was a big hit.
