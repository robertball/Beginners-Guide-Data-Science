Everone enjoys receiving these in their Christmas candy boxes! I do use my chocolate of choice, but have to say that I love mixing white chocolate with dark chocolate, as it gives the chocolate a lighter appearance and a very creamy consistancy, which is delicious. I usually use nuts, and whatever else I may have lurking around in the pantry (the possibilities are endless), and spoon them into small candy cups for a prettier presentation. I do like to use this method with the crockpot, because it melts the chocolate nice and slow and evenly, but if I'm short on time (which is usually the case, lol) I'll just use the microwave and get the same result (just be careful not to overheat the chocolate). This also makes a great project to do with the kids! :)

My Grandma had a friend who for years made this particular treat for us every Christmas as one of the treats on her candy trays. I looked forward to this every year as it was one of my favorite "candies". It may not look appealing but it's darn tasty and a heck of a lot cheaper than those expensive peanut clusters that you can get from fancy chocolate sellers. GREAT fun to make with little hands and tints well with food dyes for any holiday you'd like to make these to share. NOTE: You can speed up the process by melting the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 40 seconds until it's the consistancy you need. Then add the peanuts and spoon out by tablespoons onto your waxed paper. It goes much quicker that way.

Very easy to make - the hardest part is spooning out the candies to cool.  It makes a big batch and is very tasty, too!  Perfect for holiday gatherings!

This recipe was a Blast to make, and even more fun to serve!
My only suggestion is that you make them small. These are very sweet treats, and a little goes a long ways!

Very easy, and a big hit with the grandkids. I have also added raisons, dried cranberries, coconut or other types of nuts if I happen to have some in the pantry... this is a great way to melt/cook chocolate in other recipes without burning or overcooking it.

I just found this recipe & wondered if anyone has poured the whole batchful out on wax paper, & then broke-up after cooling. Wanted to know if there was an easier way due to nerve damage in my arms. Please let me know by responding. Thanks.

In theory these would be tasty peanut clusters. Unfortunately, the warm cycle on my crockpot is too hot so it burned the first batch of chocolate in about 45 minutes. The next time, I hovered till the chocolate started to melt. (about 20 minutes) I did use white chocolate instead of the white candy coating because i didn't have any. Very creamy & smooth. Tasty and the little kids love them (especially the name). I could see so many variations with different nuts or dried fruits. I think I would drop spoonfuls into little paper candy liners in the future. I dropped them in a small muffin tin and that worked well too. Thanks for sharing this easy peasy and sweet recipe!

I made this candy for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit with my family. It tastes just like a Mr. Goodbar. It was very easy to prepare as you literally just throw everything into the crock pot and leave it for a couple hours. But be aware that this recipe makes A LOT of candy! I had two heaping plates full to bring with me at Christmas. Luckily everyone wanted to take some home.

This was really yummy and very easy to make. I didn't have the chocolates called for so I used one bag of semi-sweet, a half bag of white chocolate chips, and half a bag of butterscotch chips with one jar of peanuts. Next time I will try adding marshmallows. I agree with the person who said to make them small. They are very rich and sweet, so putting just teaspoonful sizes would have suited me better.

These are super stupid easy to make; the fact that this was an excuse to buy my first 'big girl' crockpot is simply a plus! 

Just know that making these a teaspoon big will have you scooping out of the slow cooker all night....I made my clusters about 1 tablespoon big around and it took be approximately 1/2 - 1 hour to have all of the clusters formed.  I ended up with about 40-60 clusters making them THAT big, too!

Sent the boyfriend to work with a ziplock bag full of them, who didn't have any major complaints. 

Will make again, thanks for the easy recipe!

I've been making these at Christmas for 30 years or more but never thought  to use my crock pot!  Thanks for the tip!  I add whatever I have. I use raisins, nuts (any kind), coconut is good and my favorite is crushed pretzels (I make dipped pretzels every year and I take use the broken bits from the bottom of the bag (with the salt) and crush them finely in my food processor and add it to the chocolate. I put them in mini-cupcake pans lined with a pretty Christmas liner and they are one of the first items to disappear from the cookie tray!

I haven't made this particular recipe yet...  some say it is very sweet.  could you maybe use German unsweet chocolate instead of the German sweet chocolate so it wouldn't be so sweet?

My kids have been playing around in the house so after I made these they stopped because they were so grossed out. Great taste though.

Very easy to make and turns out well. I saved time and easier clean up by melting all of the chocolate  (30 seconds at a time) in a big bowl in the microwave. Adding raisins balances the peanunts.
