This is absolutely my favorite food.  I serve it with a Thai dipping sauce made of one lime, 1T brown sugar, 2 1/2 T fish sauce, 2 1/2 T rice vinegar, 1 clove garlic, and 1/4 -1/2 tsp of chili sauce.  Other fillings that are excellent include cucumbers, thai basil, chives, pickled ginger, watercress and carrots.  I eat this at least once a week.  The combination of crunch and soft, sweet and spicy.  It's just the best food in the world.  It can be served buffet and each make their own for a fun dinner.  They can be made ahead up to at least a day.  They are so yummy.

I lived in Hawaii and ate a ton of these at my favorite restaurant. Thanks to another reviewer for the sauce idea. Also, aren't "raw" spring rolls essentially "summer" rolls? Spring are fried, summer are fresh, I think? Otherwise, it makes it sound like you're eating raw shrimp or chicken. Though, there is nothing quite like a good beef tartare!

This recipe was a big hit with my guests, they disappeared very quickly.  We served it with Tuk Trey, a Cambodian dipping sauce made by boiling 2/3cups of water, dissolving in 2/3cups of sugar, removing from heat and adding: 1/4cup of vinegar, 1/3cup of fish sauce, 2tbl fresh lime juice, and two minced cloves of garlic.

Yummy.... my mom used to make these on special days and she would include some boiled chicken or pork; the minute she was done rolling them, they's be gone!  I try this myself now and still can't get the sauce right, but adding pepper flakes always gives a nice variation.

As native of Cambodia, this is one of my favorite Cambodian cuisines. My mother often vary her ingredients. Sometimes she substitutes shrimps with Chicken, and added other vegetables such as sliced cucumbers or carrots.

My husband could live on nothing but these spring rolls!  But he says the best part is the dipping sauce from the previous reviewer -- it's better than our favorite restaurant's recipe!  Instead of shrimp, we use finely sliced chicken sauteed in basil and chili paste.  This also helps keep the basil flavor in the rolls if you can't find fresh basil.

Excellent spring rolls!  The only thing I did differently was to put the crushed peanuts inside each roll. I also skipped the shrimp and added more bean noodles and sprouts.

We absolutely love these fresh spring rolls.  They are excellent with the shrimp and they are still really good without it.  These are great because you can substitute pretty much any grilled meat or other crisp veggies and they still taste delicious.  I like to add fresh mint and cilantro when it's in season.

Absolutely delicious! I made mine with rice vermicelli noodles instead of bean thread, plus I added cilantro. I made the lime fish sauce previously recommended, as well as an Asian peanut sauce from the Joy of Cooking. To die for!

We liked it OK, you have to practice a few times to get the rolls right.

We used avocado instead of shrimp and spinach for our leafy green, with carrots and cucumbers also.  So yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these without the sauce and they were dull. I added teriyaki sauce to assist, and it made a huge difference, but they still landed pretty flat to my taste. I will be on the lookout for tastier variations on this. Also curious what kind of vineagar people are using - rice vineagar?
