What a great recipe! I sprinkled chopped almonds on top instead of using walnuts. And to keep the cherries from sinking to the bottom I coated them in a small amount of finely ground almonds. I also added chocolate chips because as we all know every dessert tastes better with chocolate. I'll definitely make again. All the kids loved it.

This is a very easy recipe. Instead of canned sour cherries I used fresh pitted cherries. The cake is a little on the chewey side so I'll continue to experiment. However overall this was a very easy tasty recipe that was gone in one sitting.

Excellent easy recipe. It was gobbled up by my family. Added some vanilla extract and didn't even need the sauce.

I added vanilla to the batter and a crumb topping and it was a great coffee cake.

I ve made this cake twice and I didn t change a thing. Very simple recipe. I am using 24 ounce jars of sweet cherries though so when making the sauce I use a little more sugar and corn starch - and it turns out to about close to 3 cups of sauce with a lot of cherries. (I ve just used the extra for waffle topping) My husband generally will not eat anything with cherries but this cake smells so good when baking that he tried and loves this cake. He won t use the sauce yet though. It s really good with a little vanilla ice cream on top too.
