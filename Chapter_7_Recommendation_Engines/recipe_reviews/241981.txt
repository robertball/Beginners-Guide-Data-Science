Made this for my family tonight and they loved it. Even with the crushed red pepper is wasn't spicy (only my son and I like spicy food). This dish goes great with Jasmine rice and oven roasted squash and zucchini.

I love this recipe!   I do not use the beer--since I'm gluten free.  It's important to know that you need to chill the shrimp in ice water after cooking, so they stop cooking.  I have made this 3 times, and have found that I prefer serving them with shell on--they have incredible texture, and people love to play with their food!  You will enjoy this!

This is a terrific shrimp boil. In fact, I will use this to cook all my boiled shrimp for recipes and shrimp cocktails in the future. Perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this and it's the second time for it.  I don't have pickling spice so I read up on the ingredients and added them into the boiling water.  Doubled this for two pounds of colossal shrimp. An excellent pronounced flavor that is not too spicy.

Flavor is good to change it up every once in awhile.  I think I prefer simple beer and Old Bay on a regular basis.

Make sure to use quality ingredients & never use farm raised shrimp, only use WILD CAUGHT SHRIMP.

This is how my Tidewater, Virginia grandmother steamed shrimp. It allows you to taste the beautiful flavor of the shrimp more than old bay

Just delicious...followed the recipe exactly..I put the shrimp in a small bowl lined with romaine lettuce. Had small slices of sharp cheddar cheese nestled next to the shrimp. Mixed cocktail sauce with a small amount of horseradish and put in the center.  Excellent

I made it exactly as the recipe dictated except I used bud light lime for the beer,  and it was one of the best shrimp boils my hubby and I have ever tasted!  Perfect chilled with spicy cocktail sauce.
