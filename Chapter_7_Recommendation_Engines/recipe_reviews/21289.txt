This recipe is very confusing.  First it asked for cubed sweet potatoes, either canned or fresh.  Secondly, it tells you to mash the sweet potatoes, so you assume it means to cook them before mixing them with the other ingredients.  Thirdly, it tells you to cook the casserole until the potatoes are tender.  Needs to be clarified.  I cooked the potatoes first, then mashed them.  I also had to add some time to the cooking, add at least 20 minutes to the cooking time.

This dish is wonderful.  I made a few changes though.  I used fresh sweet potatoes, chopped them into small pieces and boiled them until just tender.  Then I left out the coconut completely and instead of using all white sugar, I used half brown.  After reading other reviews, I also used 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter in the dish and 1 stick in the topping.  It was just right, no oozing!

Diana, VERY good! Every1 RAVED! I think this calls for way to much melted butter, next time I'll only melt 2 sticks butter for the whole thing. I also used 3/4 cup crushed corn flakes in the potatoe mixture for a total of 1 1/2 cups crushed flakes. I used a 29 oz. can cut up sweet potatoes witch mashes to approximatly 2 cups. Next time I'll try only 1/2 cup sugar if not any as I felt this didn't need sugar. GR8 recipe! THANKS!

Even tho I had to make a few changes this is still a 5 start recipe. I looked at other reviews before making it and follow some advice. 

I only used 1 Cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine in both places

It turned out great. I made it for my hubbys employee Thanks Giving work lunch and none came home with him. I also used canned yams for I already had them. That was the main reason I cut back on sugar for it has sugar in them. If I would of use Fresh sweet potatoe I would of needed the extra sugar I'm sure. I did drain all juices off my canned yam before using them.

Would make again for sure and thank you for sharing your recipe hun

OMG! These were the best sweet papas I've ever had.  The only thing I did different was use about half the white sugar and increased the brown sugar to about 1/2  - 3/4 cup jam packed. Oh, and also I mixed in some mini marshmellows into the potatoes.  Simply wonderful!

I've been making this recipe for about 3 years now and whenever I go anywhere, I'm always asked to bring this dish specifically.  I can't even remember how many times I've forwarded this recipe on.  I make just as directed and it comes out great every time.  The only thing that I found over the years, is that if I make it one day ahead and let it cool overnight, then warm it up in the oven on the day of, it's consistency is perfect!!  Thanks to Charline for sharing this wonderful, scrumptious delight!

Excellent recipe and this is now going to be a holiday standard.  I like things sweet, but I cut the sugar in half and only used 1 stick of butter for the casserole and 1/2 stick for the topping.  Came out beautifully and ooey gooey!!

I didn't really care too much for this dish.  I thought it was too sweet.  I think if I ever made this again, I'd not use as much sugar.

I made this last year for the first Thanksgiving at my house. WOW! Everyone loved it! My husband who says he "hates" sweet potatoes really liked it to his surprise. I came hunting for it this year because I lost the one I printed out. I remember making a few 'tweaks' but nothing major. You can't go wrong with this one! It was requested this year and it will be on our Thanksgiving table for years to come. Thanks Diana and whomever Charline is too!

This is the best Sweet Potato Casserole recipe ever! I always had a traditional recipe I used for the holidays but this recipe has it beat hands-down.  

I do reduce the sugar, eggs and butter to these portions:  1 cup sugar, 2 eggs and 1/2 cup butter.  And I *always* use fresh baked sweet potatoes. It makes all the difference in a sweet potato casserole recipe.  I typically bake about 6-7 nice sized sweet potatoes in my toaster oven on a sheet of aluminum foil at 450 degrees for 1-1/2 hours until very tender. Then I cool just enough to be able to handle to peel.

The coconut is a nice and different twist that everyone I've made this for loves.

My family loved this!  There were only two teaspoons left and I finished them while cleaning up the dishes!  I modified this a bit though.  I only used one cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of butter and left out the coconut (I like coconut...my family doesn't).  The topping I left the same.  It was an absolutely delicious dish.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it several years in a row for our community Thanksgiving dinner. It disappears every year with rave reviews from those eating it!

I substitute butter for the margarine (nothing better than the real thing) and reduce it to 1/2 cup in both places - still tastes amazing! I use yams instead of sweet potatoes, but that is purely personal preference. Also, if you have any vegetarians at your Thanksgiving table (this happened to me last year), all you have to do is substitute Marshmallow Fluff for the marshmallows (I used 4 tablespoons), and voila! A vegetarian dish!

I love this recipe! I make it every Thanksgiving - it's a family favorite! It is very sweet - probably more of a dessert dish for some folks but we include it with the meal instead of the desserts. I'd eat it all of the time if I could!

Very good, a couple variations though. First cut the sweet potatoes/yams put them in water, after three hours clean the water, that rinse a bit of the starch. Then boil them, mashed them ,put in the margarine or spread, the nutmeg, cinnamon and the 3/4 cups sugar (I used splenda). I did this the night before. When it was time to cook them added only two eggs and 3/4 cups of the evaporated milk. Skipped the coconut but used marshmallows, which I also sprinkle a few on the top cooked for 15 minutes. For the topping I didn't used flakes, but combined light brown sugar with flour, margarine or spread and chopped pecans until making a crumble topping which I cooked for another 10 or so minutes. It was a hit!

This was the first time I had ever made a sweet potato casserole. The end result was great! I have to admit that I was confused when making it b/c the recipe says to mash the potatoes and then later says to bake until they are tender. My thought process was that I should boil the potatoes in the beginning in order to mash them but I didn't....I just cubed them. While baking it, it looked like soup and my husband thought I messed something up :) but when I took it out it thickened up like a casserole. Will make again!

I'm trying to find words for how incredibly, amazingly scrumptious this is. Maybe this will explain it: It's Thanksgiving evening, and this afternoon my husband literally ate himself sick on food. Now, only a few hours later, he is begging me to make another pan of these sweet potatoes, because he can't get enough! I followed other suggestions to cut down the sugar (I used about 1 cup, also I used canned yams so they were already sweet) and the butter (I used 1 stick in the casserole and 1 in the topping for a total of 1 cup.) I also followed the suggestion to make it the nght before, put it in the fridge overnight, then top it and warm it the next day. The flavor and consistency was *amazing.* Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner raved about them. This is truly a super-star recipe!

My family loved this. I used 2 cans of Bruces Yams, dump out the syrup and pour the yams into the pan. I used a potato masher to mush them up. To make it easy on myself I poured all the ingredients on top of the yams ( saves on the dishes). It turned out great.

Made this again for Thanksgiving and it's on the menu for life now.  It's the topping that makes this so delicous!

Again,  I would have given it 5 stars but I did change the recipe a bit which made it even better. Here is exactly what I did.  

I used 2 big cans of canned sweet potatoes (drained and mashed) and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white.  Also, everywhere it called for 3/4 cup of butter I only used 1/2 cup, only 3 eggs instead of 4 and NO COCONUT.   (everything else I did the same) I cooked it a little bit longer than it called for. This fits nicely in a 9x13 pan btw.

Again took this to the church Thanksgiving get together and like last year it was very popular.

We ate about two spoonfuls of this and threw the rest away. Just too many flavor combinations? Not sure what exactly, but it ended up being a gooey mess and tasted horrible! Will definitely delete this one from the recipe box

I omitted the coconut because I thought it might make the texture a bit weird, and substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar. This turned out absolutely delicious and was a hit with the family. I am no longer allowed to come to Thanksgiving dinner unless I bring this dish :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

The recipe was confusing, asking you to mash the potatoes before cooking them, we cooked them first and then realized later they shouldn't have been.  Hard to follow, but still good.

This casserole was delicious! I made it for an office Thanksgiving potluck. The only thing I did different was reduce the amount of sugar since there's marshmallows and brown sugar topping. Next time I will reduce the margarine in the topping too because there was too much margarine floating at the top.

I absolutely LOVE this Sweet Potato Casserole. I make it every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. The only Modification that I have made is the amount of sugar in the sweet potatos themselves. I reduce it by more than half. I usually use about 3/4 of a cup. 2 cups makes it toothache sweet. and i reduce the amount period and make about 12 servings rather than 24 and i use canned sweet potatoes because, lets face it, Sweet Potatoes are hard as heck to cut up. plus it makes the whole process that much easier.

I make this each year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family loves it and begs for it. (I reduce the amount of sugar to half a cup if I am using canned yams.) my family loves the topping so I try to make more of the crunchy topping. Made it for co-workers and they all asked for the recipe. It's a keeper!

This recipie is a MUST at Thanksgiving, the first thing to be finished every year. I boil and mash the sweet potatos instead of baking them found this to be much easier!!

I gave this recipe a "trial run" before Thanksgiving and took the advice of several subscribers.  To simplify things, I used drained canned yams, cut the sugar in half using brown sugar instead, and cut the margarine to 1/2 cup for casserole and topping.  I did not add the coconut because I didn't think I would like the texture.  I baked it for 30 minutes.  It was a little "loose" when it came out of the oven, but it seems to set after sitting for a little while.  I refrigerated it and warmed it the next day for 30 minutes at 350.  Then topped it with the topping and baked another 10 minutes.  It was FANTASTIC.  We have been eating the leftovers COLD and that is yummy too.  I definitely will make this for Thanksgiving.

This was wonderful.  My grandmother said it was the best Sweet Potato Casserole she has ever eaten.  I used 2 cans of mashed sweet potatoes and 1 can of regular and just mashed them myself; I added a small can of crushed pineapple, I had to bake it longer than was specified but it was worth it. I made a little more topping than the recipe called for and instead of using just regular Corn Flakes, I used a cereal called Oatmeal Crisp with brown sugar.  The brown sugar in the cereal flakes and bits of oatmeal crisp really made it outstanding!  Very delicious.

Confusing recipe rendered an inedible mess. I think the recipe means to call for 4 C. mashed sweet potatoes, not cut up sweet potatoes. Knowing what I know now, I may try again with the correct information.

I also agree that this recipe is not clear when using raw sweet potatoes.  I steamed them first then mashed and continued on with the recipe.  The only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 1 cup and only used 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter.  The topping I made as the recipe states.

I will definately make this again as everyone raved about it and I thought the taste was perfect.

Too sweet, too rich, too many nuts and crunchy things. I cut the recipie down to 1/4, just in case this wasn't very good. I'm glad I did! We both ended up picking at it, and the rest went in the garbage. What a waste of sweet potatoes! I love sweet potatoes, but, this is just too much! If you like classic Thanksgiving candied yams, and mashed brown sugar sweet potatoes, you will not like this! It is far from traditional, and it makes a lot, even if you customize it to 6 servings. We will not be using this again. It's also an incredible waste of time. I now have a whole box of corn flakes that will not be eaten.

This recipe was AWESOME. I made Thanksgiving this year for people from an assortment of different countries and each one RAVED about this dish. My boyfriend, who hates sweet potato dishes, was already asking me to make this dish again before the day was over! Definitely cut back on the sugar and butter. I probably used about 1-1/4 cup of sugar in the dish itself, 1/2 cup of butter (could go less). In the topping I  cut back as well. I let it stand for about 20 mins while I prepped the gravy and turkey. This helped solidify it a bit. This dish is delicious and a wonderful twist on an old favorite!

FANTASTIC!!  out of necessity, i had to prepare this ahead of time,  i made the sweet potato mixture and refrigerated it.  i also made and refrigerated the topping mixture.  when i was ready to bake the casserole, i had to break-up the topping and sprinkle it over the sweet potatoes.  the result was a very crunchy topping - totally amazing!!  will only use this recipe when making a sweet potato casserole.  thanks diana - you hit the jackpot with this one!!!

Definitely not my favorite sweet potato casserole dish but not bad. It's very 'eggy' tasting.  DEFINITELY cut the sugar in half! I also added a 1/4 oatmeal to topping mixture. Best sweet potato casserole is under 'Yummy Yam Casserole' but use sweet potatoes instead of yams and coconut in the mixture if you like it.

I don't care for margarine so I used butter instead, but next time I will halve the amount. There was way too much. This recipe is also way too sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and I won't even use half that much next time.

Great recipe, its important when using fresh sweet potatoes, to cook them for 40 minutes first, allow to cool, and then peel and mash. I'm guessing the above recipe is for canned potatoes already pre-cooked.

I liked this recipe a lot, but it was way too sweet.  I think I won't include the marshmallows next time, or I'll pile them on top of the crusty topping.  I hardly put any sugar in the sweet potatoes, but threw in a can of crushed pineapple for some flavor and sweetness.  I used crushed whole grain cereal instead of cornflakes, and a lot less butter (with a bit of pineapple juice added for moisture).  They turned out great!

First let me say that i did not do this recipe's topping, because at the last minute i realized i didnt have corn flakes. But, the filling was so delicious. I used 4 fresh sweet potatoes cooked and mashed them, which may have been more than 4 cups. I did not use the coconut, and instead of mixing the marshmallows in it, I sprinkled them on top of my pecan topping. I baked for 40 minutes at 325 since that was the temp for my turkey. Very delicous, and I think not too sweet as others stated, but everyone has their own preference. I will definitely make this again, and hopefully next time with the corn flakes.

This was very yummy like a dessert.  I too next time will use only half the sugar and butter that goes into the casserole. The butter was leaking out of it on the plate. Otherwise very good.

Great recipe...i used canned yam's instead (toss the syrup and mash the yams) and add all the ingredients as indicated...also I added splenda to taste instead of white sugar. I also added marshmallows to the topping so they get all gooey and brown..DELICIOUS recipe!

I made this casserole for Thanksgiving, it received rave reviews!! My family insisted that I make it again for Christmas!
I did cut the amount of sugar in half, and I reduced the amount of butter in the casserole, AND the topping to 1/2 cup, instead of 3/4 cup. 
The extra butter and sugar are not needed! It is yummy without it!
This will definitely go in my favorites!

Absolutely awesome!! Hubby never had sweet potatoe casserole before, and I never had sweet potatoes period. We both didn't know what to expect, but this won us over with the first bite. I'll make this again and again and again. But I did add a little less than one cup of sugar (I used already sweetened canned sweet potatoes), and it was perfect. 
Five YUM YUM's for this one!

Love this. Been making it for years.  My family is from PA and this is as close to my mom's recipe as I could find. A lot of people are weird about coconut, even tho I like it, I will leave it out.  I use mostly organic ingredients. This has been a hit at every holiday dinner I've gone to. I will probably cut back on white sugar and butter like suggested.  I will also make this the day before like another person mentioned.

I had some technical issues with this recipe, because I was cooking about 5 things at one time and forgot to add the marshmallows prior to putting it in the oven.  I cooked mine in a 3 quart round casserole dish - big mistake, it took forever to cook. Use a 9x13 dish as suggested.  Also it was extremely sweet for my taste, so I'll cut out a cup of sugar next time - because the 2 cups of marshmallows really sweetens it up. I loved the soufflé like texture, it was a big hit and had no complaints!

This recipe was awesome! I made it for th Newberg Fire Department family Thanksgiving and I was told it was so good it should have been on the dessert table! I followed some other reviews and boiled the potatoes before I mashed them, and used less sugar and butter. My husband and I don't like sweet potatoes, but thanks to this recipe we will be eating sweet potatoes every holiday!

Thought I would try something different than the usual basted w/butter and brown sugar til it  candied. Everyone says ok, but wasn't sweet enough and the potato itself was kinda bland. Maybe all the eggs and other ingredients took away the natural flavor?

I made two changes to this recipe. I don't care for coconut, so I omitted it and to account for the change I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes.  I generally don't care for sweet potatoes, and this casserole blew me away! It is SO yummy! It will be a family favorite for years to come, I'm sure!!

Very good idea for a recipe, I can see it being very good. I followed your recipe instructions and ended up with a consistency of a very thin pudding. I should have read further ahead, but I would say that the directions need to be clarified.

I LOVE THESE! I am not a sweet potatoe person at all,  but these definitely won me over! I only use half the sugar and I omit the coconut and pecans...but it is still a dish that keeps everyone asking for more!  Sorry pumpkin pie, they choose another serving of these sweet potatoes to you!

I absolutely love this recipe! I make this recipe at least a dozen times a year. It is one of my coworkers favorite potluck items that I bring.   I am not one for sticking exactly to a recipe, but this recipe is so delicious the way it is I don't change anything.  I highly recommend it!!

The concept of this recipe is great, but it is too sweet and too runny. I cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup, used only 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1/4 cup regular milk. The topping on this was awesome and delicious!

I made it for an office Thanksgiving potluck and my coworkers raved about it and gulfed it down. I should have halfed the butter and the sugar and decreased (or eliminated) the evaporated milk.

My FAVORITE thing to make for Thanksgiving!  I have had numerous assignments to bring this dish to Thanksgiving dinner since I first made it years ago.  My family says, "Bring your yammies!!!"  Perfect 5s.  This is like a dessert.  You will not regret making this - but you will regret not making enough!    Some confusion about what type of sweet potatoes to use:  I bought the large cans of yams that are readily available at the grocery store.  As they are already cooked, I just mashed them with a fork before placing them in my dish.  A little bit of chunkiness is good (so it's not like eating slop!).  I know the recipe instructs you to take it out when the potatoes are tender - I judge it more by when the top is golden.  This recipe definitely is best if its allowed to cool a bit or even at room temperature.

I made this at Thanksgiving, but substituted the sugar, including the brown variety, with Splenda so my diabetic mother could enjoy it too.  It was sensational!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I made several modifications to this recipe. I cut the sugar in half (calling for half as much sugar as there were potatoes just seemed like way too much). I replaced half the margarine with butter. I eliminated the marshmallows and coconut. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews, everyone asked for the recipe afterwards! Also as others commented, there aren't really instructions for how to prep the potatoes. I used fresh sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled them until they were tender, and mashed them in a food mill before adding the rest of the ingredients.
I'd give it 5 stars with my changes :)

I made this for a Native American/ Irish wedding for 60 people and it was a huge hit. Several people asked me for the recipe. My son, who was 9 at the time and a very picky eater, loved it because of the marshmallows! The chewy coating on top was what people liked the most.

This is always a huge hit.  
I did some minor modifications as the first time it was more like a dessert.(which isn't a bad thing :))
For sugar, I only used 1 1/3 cup.
And for the butter, I only used a stick each time vs. a stick and a half.  I even may cut down more as the last time it still had a lot of butter around the edges. 
Overall this recipe is great, thanks so much for sharing it will us!

This was fabulous. It is defintely sweet enough to serve as a dessert. Like others, I reduced the cup of sugar to 1 cup, and it was plenty. I also did not add extra sugar to the topping. I just mixed the 3 ingredients and crumbled it ontop. The recipe had enough butter in it for the topping to soak up. Even my sister who doesn't like sweet potatoes ate it!

I made this 2 years ago at Thanksgiving and now my family BEGS for it all the time. This recipe is the BEST sweet potato casserole that anyone has ever eaten, as you will see when you make it!!! I only use 1 cup of the white sugar, and this is plenty. Enjoy :)

I made this for thanksgiving dinner.  My mother in law had given me a recipe that my husband loved, and I was tired of making it.  So after going over what other people had wrote I used 1/2 cup of sugar with my canned yams, same with the topping I cut it down to 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I did not crush the corn flakes (to give it more texture on top) and I added marshmellows to the topping.  The end result was wonderful!  My husband says it is a tie with his momma's!

I thought this was great.  The directions are not great though; it does not state to cook the potatos first before mashing.  I assumed I was suppose to, but it then stated to cook until "tender".  Well this made no sense.  You can't mash raw potatos so I cubed them and cooked them.  They had to cook much longer than 20 min for it to "set".  In the end it turned out great, loved the topping also.

We had Thanksgiving here in Australia because my Husband and son are American so I thought it would be nice to have it.  I served this with dinner and no-one ate it, even though I only added 1 cup of sugar it was still too sweet to eat with the main meal, so I re served it at dessert time and half was eatten.  I wasn't sure what to do with the sweet potatoes so I boiled and mashed them, you couldn't even taste them, I didn't put the topping on thinking there was enough sugar in it already.  I probably won't cook this again and if I did I would 1/4 the sugar and serve it as dessert.  (We don't eat sweet stuff with our main meals here I always thought it was strange when my husband got sweet stuff ie: jello with his dinner at buffets, and then I noticed when I went there to Alaska they had Jello in the Buffet so it answered a few questions.),  By the way I loved it.

This was really good, but way too sweet & buttery.
I halfed the recipe and 1/2'd the sugar again. I used a little less butter, would use even less next time(there will be a next time).
For the topping I only had some raisin bran & frosted flakes, so I used that with 2 TBS. brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter. What a treat :-)

Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing this.   The only different I did was to steam the sweet potatos first, so I could mash it easier, then cut down the first time baking from 20 minutes to 10 minutes.  I don't really sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar to about 3.4 cups.  That should be plenty since the sweet potatoes are sweet already.

This was incredible!!  I was in a time crunch so I used 2 large cans of sweet potatoes.  I was worried that it wouldn't taste as good as fresh potatoes...I was wrong!  What a hit!  I heard "these are the best  I've ever had.." more than once!

I have never eaten or cooked with yams before.  My husband asked for sweet potatoes the way his mom used to make them and this was the closest possible recipe i could find.  I cubed the potaoes and then steamed them for 20 min before putting them into the oven.  The recipe said to "mash" them and that was not going to happen with them being raw.  I thought I messed the whole thing up but continued on instead.  I cut the butter in half but didnt change anything else.  They turned out very good.  My husband said they were awsome.  I will be keeping this recipe for next year.

This is a delicious recipe.  I made it for Christmas, as part of a vegetarian menu, and it was very well received.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and it turned out perfectly.  My boyfriend loved it so much, that he took home the leftovers!

My husband loves sweet potato casserole, so I found this recipe and he loved it.  This was the first time I had ever made it so I was pretty skeptical.  I cut the sugar in half and I didn't use the coconut.  I also used flour instead of cornflakes for the topping.  It turned out great.  I will definitely do this one again.

I thought this recipe was disgusting, I think I would have done better making it up myself. My husband begged me to make sweet potato casserole with corn flakes on top, so I found this recipe.  But he wouldn't even touch the stuff it was so nasty.

Absolutely delicious!  Perfect holiday sweet potatoes.  I thought they were a tad too sweet and when I said during dinner that I'd use less sugar next time, everyone yelled out "WHY???"  So, maybe they are just perfect.  The coconut and the crisp topping definitely make this unique and worth adding to your holiday menu.

We thought the recipe called for too much sugar so we left out the white sugar. Skipped the corn flakes too. Cooked covered at 350 for 30 minutes then uncovered for 20 minutes until the marshmellow were golden brown. Everyone loved it. The coconut was a great touch.

This recipe was very, very sweet. I like that but others at the table thought it was a bit too sweet. It tasted similar to a cinnamon roll but it was a little too liquidy. No problem, I just drained it out a little before serving. I loved the flavor of the coconut, cinnamon and spices. Very delicious.

This is the best sweet potato recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and we loved it so much we had to make another batch only a week later.  I added some extra pecans the second time. This will definitely be a staple in our household.

I cut back a little on the sugar & the butter and put a layer of jumbo, marshmallows coated with melted butter just under the crumb topping.  (My son loves lots of marshmallows.)  A tip to speed up the cooking time: Slice unpeeled sweet potatoes and bake them till soft in the microwave.  Skins will pull right off.  This dish can also be made without the coconut.  A huge hit at my Thanksgiving family reunion!

Good taste, but somewhat on the greasy side. If I try it again, I'll cut butter/margarine in topping to 1/3 cup or less, and in filling to 1/2 cup or less.  Will also hold back the marshmallows and blend them with the topping since they came very close to burning at 400 degrees.

I first tried this recipe for Christmas dinner.  Before I made this casserole, I thought I didn't like sweet potatoes! It is a wonderful recipe that my whole family loves.  I also made it for our church's 4th of July picnic and it was a big hit...I'll be making it for every church social from now on!

I have made this several times for various functions and everyone ALWAYS enjoys this! I omit the coconut and cornflakes and reduce the amount of margarine called for (I actually use butter instead). The last time I made this it was a little more runny than usual, but delicious anyways. I will continue to make this delicious casserole! Thanks for posting. :)

This recipe is fabulous. Even though I can't get the right consistency (I end up making a smaller portion and have to try to downsize the potatoes), made it twice, it is still delicious! It is very sweet, much like a dessert at dinner, and much like a pecan pie taste, but still delicious! I have not used the cornflakes or coconut and don't know how that adds to it. Its pretty hard to mess this up. I'm no great cook, but this is easy. I boil my sweet potatoes for a long time until they are so soft the outside just peels right off, mash them somewhat, then mix it all together and bake it for much longer than it says.

This will be the 4th year I have used this recipe.  The only thing I would change is the amount of butter...but other than than it is perfect.  Every year someones makes a comment about this recipe and even my mom-in-law gets a little upset because she brings regular sweet potatoes (which are wonderful) but family raves about this sweet potatoeo casserole.

This turned out really well and was a big hit at our Thanksgiving this year. I'd never made sweet potato casserole before or really had it, so I wasn't quite sure how it was supposed to turn out, but everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I bought raw sweet potatoes and then read the reviews about confusion about the whole mashing of the potatoes, so I wasn't really sure what to do. I decided to boil the potatoes for 20 minutes but that didn't seem to help their hardness level much. I didn't have a lot of time to be worrying about them, though, since I had a lot of things to do, so I just decided to go ahead and throw everything into the pan and put it in the oven. I then came back every now and then and tried mashing them and mixing everything together with a fork(sorry I'm not sure how long it took for them to get soft, but it did take awhile). When they were finally mash-able, I mixed everything around and then tossed the final marshmallows on top...and the final result was great! Next time I plan to just throw everything in at once to begin with because it doesn't seem that the boiling did much. I think cooking the casserole this way made it taste really good because the potatoes got to cook in the sugar and since I didn't mash them as much as I probably would have if they were soft to begin with, the final consistency was really nice with some soft chunks of potatoes mixed throughout. It will probably just take however long it takes to bake sweet potatoes normally (which I'

the recipe does not say how to prepare the sweet potatoes and you can't mash them raw, so we put them in the blender and then they were too mushy when they came out of the oven, the taste was great though

Great sweet potato recipe.  The family enjoyed it at the Thanksgiving dinners 2 years ago and it has been add to the traditional meal.  As mentioned by others I halved the sugar in the casserole and made half of it brown.  The coconut and marshmellows were both a hit as well.

LOVE this recipe!  I always receive compliments on it, even from proclaimed yam-haters and coconut-haters.  Like others mentioned, I reduce the butter and sugar (especially if I put in the marshmallows, which I sometimes leave out).  Also, I always use fresh yams, though I'm never quite sure how many make up 4 cups.  So I usually buy 4 large ones and that works great.  Lastly, I've noticed this dish turns out best when there's no lumps in the yams, so I use a blender after mashing.  Thanks for the great recipe! It's now a standard dish at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I have used this recipe for at least 12 years however, I do use canned pumpkin rather than sweet potato and I do cut back the sugar and butter by 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. I have tried it with sweet potato but do not like it near as well.

This recipe is great. You do have to cut back on the eggs, sugar and milk or it will be very runny. Everything else I left the same. At every family function this is a must have from every family member.

I was disappointed in the results of this recipe. The consistancy was too soupy even though I tried to cook it longer but then the topping started to get too dark. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor either.

I followed this recipe except left out the coconut and pecans and it came out a runny mess.  As others have said the recipe is confusing.  I imagine using fresh sweet potato (as I did) was a mistake and effects the recipe.  I knew I was in trouble when it said to scoop the contents into a baking dish and I had to pour it.  
The flavors were good, but the texture was terrible.

Very quick and easy to make.  I took it to a large family gathering for Thanksgiving and there was still plenty left over.  Next time I may halve the recipe.  I don't normally like sweet potato casserole, but I did enjoy this.  Perhaps because it tastes more like a dessert.

This is a yummy one!  I made for a Thanksgiving dinner and people were having second helpings of this instead of pumpkin pie for dessert! It's quite sweet but the topping is amazing. I omitted the coconut as I don't care for it, but the crunchy cornflakes and pecans adds just the perfect amount of extra flavor!  I'll be making this often!

This is THE BEST sweet potato recipe I've ever had!!!  I have made it for the past 2 years for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Its been a hit every time.  In fact my sister tells me I can't come to holiday dinner unless I bring these.. I cut up fresh yams/sweet potatoes, boil them for just a few minutes so their not quite tender (the oven does the rest) I also leave them in chunks not mashed.  I omit the coconut and only use 1 cup of sugar.  All I can say is YUMMIE!!!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving and I am so glad I found the recipe again so I can make it this Thanksgiving!  It was the best Sweet Potato Casserole I have ever had - even my husbnad ate it and he hates sweet potatoes!  It really is more of a dessert, so I would suggest using less sugar if you don't have a sweet tooth.  I'm gonna be making this every Thanksgiving!

This was an awesome recipe.  I don't like sweet potatoes but this made me love them.  I also halved the sugar, omitted the coconut and boiled the poatoes first.  I could have used a quarter of the sugar even and it still would have been fabulous.  Everyone ate it right up and it was just as great the next day.  Thanks for this one!

Fantastic!!  I used canned sweet potatoes.  I was a little worried when my sweet potato mix was completely liquid and she said to scoop it into the dish (I was pouring it!)  But it turned out perfectly.  My mother-in-law requested it for Easter!  Thank you, Charline!!

I never liked sweet potatoes before but my husband loves them so I decided to make this recipe. I recommened using canned sweet potatoes. They are the perfect texture for mashing. The casserole was a hit! I made it for an office party and had five co-workers ask me for the recipe. Will definatly make this again.

I've been making this casserole dish since 2000! Since we always go to a relative's house, it's what everyone always looks forward to. Even the ones who don't like sweet potatoes and coconut rave about it! The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is unclear how to mash raw potatoes and the sweetness can be a little much.

I usually double the recipe and boil the potatoes until just tender before mashing them.

This year we're having Thanksgiving at home, so I'm going to cut back on the sugar and butter.

This was really good.  Only 4 people were eating dinner that night, and more than half the pan was gone!!!  The only thing I would do differently next time is decrease the margarine in the filling.  I noticed it was pooling at the bottom of the pan a bit.  Other than that it was FANTASTIC!!!! People who don't like sweet potatoes would even love this!

My husband loves sweet potato casserole. His mom makes hers with Cornflake crumbs on top and I make mine with marshmellows so he got a little of both our recipes combined into one and LOVED it. Thanks so much for this wonderful side dish.

Excellent!
I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  The only thing I did not use was the coconut, cornflakes and nuts because my husband and kids do not like thoes items.  I also misread and put the topping on before baking but it came out just fine.  I will surely be making this dish again.  Definately on Christmas.  I may make half with pecans because I love them so much.  Thanks

Made with 1 cup sugar and only needed 1/2 cup milk.  I debated on whether to add the coconut, went ahead and did it - my reviewers (all 12 of them) said the coconut made the recipe!  I changed the topping a bit since I didn't have corn flakes - used 1/2 cup of flour instead to make a typical struesel topping.  Everyone LOVED this recipe and I got many requests.  Thanks Diana!

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner... everyone absolutely loved it.  I left out the coconut flakes b/c I'm not a big fan of coconuts.  Also omitted the corn flakes... just topped the casserole with pecans/brown sugar/butter mixture - it was delicious.

The coconuut & pecans were quite the hit at the "big family Thanksgiving" -- something a little different from just the plain marshmallows on top.  Many of the "aunties" made good comments and wanted to know what I had thrown in there.  (They do NOT like to deviate from the traditional dinners so this was a risk, but they liked it!)  This dish was close enough flavor-wise to not throw people completely for a loop -- just added something a little different!  THANK-YOU!!

This was quite good.  The leftovers were better than the initial meal.  Next time, I would leave out the corn flakes, though.

This is one of the best sweet potato casseroles I've ever had, with a few minor modifications.  There is WAY too much sugar as the recipe is written.  I halved the sugar and cut back on the brown sugar, and it was still *plenty* sweet.  I was serving it for a first Thanksgiving in the UK, and at first each person only took about a spoonful to be polite (British people never mix 'sweet' and 'savoury' items like sugar/marshmallows and sweet potato) but by the end the whole dish had disappeared.  I also put marshmallows on top instead of mixed in, to add that classic American touch.

I took this to my husband's Christmas party and everyone loved it.  There was barely any left.  I thought it was a little too sweet and will put in less sugar next time.  Will definitely keep this to use again.

The first time I made this recipe, I boiled the sweet potatoes first and it was a bit too sweet and runny. So I cut back the sugar and added 2 tbs of corn starch now it is perfect.. we all love it!

I made this for Thanksgiving for my family this year and everyone loved it. Its a bit too sweet and runny. I wouldnt mix sugar in with the sweet potatoes,  I would just use the sugared topping.  Also I wouldnt mix in the marshmellows since they melt and you dont see them, I would sprinkle those on top. I would recommend using only 2 eggs instead of four.

This recipe is a keeper!  Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner enjoyed this side dish.  I did not put coconut in it when I made it because some people do not like coconut.  And I did boil the cut up sweet potatoes before mixing everything together because otherwise there was no way I would be able to mash them raw.  I didn't cut back on the sugar but next time I might.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it for thanksgiving, Christmas, my christmas potluck at work, and for Easter... The only change I made was to substitute pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg since I am not a huge fan of nutmeg.  But it's wonderful!

Excellent flavor!! My husband hates sweet potatoes but he loved this.  I will make this every thanksgiving.  I used only one cup of sugar instead of two and it was still sweet.  My whole family loved it...

This turned out so great! My family loved it and went back for seconds. Thanksgiving is not complete without sweet potato casserole!  I did add additional marshmallows on top of the streudel right before it was done.  Great! Thank you!

MMMMMmmm good! And I don't even like sweet potatos. I took this to a Thanksgiving potluck at work and there was a scuffle over the last serving! Everyone is demanding the recipe. I think next time I will use a little less sugar, because it was a tad too sweet for me. My coworkers and family really loved it.

I made this without the coconut and pecans just because I didn't have them on hand but would love to try it next time. This was an awesome dish that everyone loved. I took it to a potluck and came back with no left overs.

This sweet potato casserole was absolutely delicious. My husband usually doesn't eat this dish, but he surely enjoyed this recipe.  The topping is so good.  I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was quite delicious.  Had just moved here and all my recipes books were packed. My husband found this recipe for me on line. My husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes loved it.My father also found the dish quite tastey. Next time I will reduce the butter by half and I used only half the sugar.  Very good recipe!

I do NOT like sweet potatoes. I made this because of a request by members of my extended family. They absolutely loved this dish. They said the coconut adds a 'surprise' taste. I'll take their word for it! Very easy to make.

I love this recipe.  I’ve been making it every year since I found it.  I disagree with other reviewers.   I wouldn’t change a thing.  My kids, my grandkids and my mom and dad always expect this from me.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

This is my new go to sweet potato casserole.  The coconut in the filling and the cornflakes in the topping were different than my other recipe.  I took it to a gathering and got RAVE reviews!  I stuck to the recipe (even though 2 cups of sugar seemed a LOT to me).  I will definitely make this over, and over, and over again.  Thank you Charline!

This is so good! A few things I noticed was if I used 3/4 cup of butter for the potatoes and 3/4 cup for the topping, it was way too much. The dish just wouldn’t set up and I had to bake it for about 30 minutes longer than the recipe recommends. I ended using 3/4 cup for the entire dish and it was much better.

My family loved this, but I did not enjoy the texture of the coconut in my sweet potatoes. Next time I will grind the coconut or put the coconut in the topping because the flavor was great. I ground my pecans as my husband can't eat them whole and I used fresh sweet potatoes that I diced and boiled, otherwise I followed the recipe.

Amazing and huge hit. I did make some changes. I boiled the sweet potatoes whole and then peeled much easier and used less of the white sugar made with 1 cup and next will use 1/2 cup This was so delish.

Absolutely fantastic dish!  I've been making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas for over 15 years now.  We joke that my family won't let me in the door without it.  Lol.  I've made a couple changes, though.  I use Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds instead of Corn Flakes.  I love having the oats in there!  I'm also very generous with the pecans in the topping.  I also take out the white sugar because I think it's sweet enough with the marshmallows and the brown sugar topping.  Even without it, it's still like dessert.  I also remove the coconut since some of my family members aren't fond of it.  So yummy!

I have made this every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 6 years. Always a favorite with the family and friends. I have made different variations like a low carb diabetic version for my sister.  Half the sugar, organic, no marshmallows, extra pecans, plain cornflakes. Everyone loved it! Fresh Sweet Potatoes really make it flavorful.

Been using this recipe for years now.  I love it to pieces and so do my grand kids!  We use cashews as this is our favorite nut.

I make this every year for Christmas and it is always a hit. If you are making it in advance like me just mix all the ingredients together and freeze and allow it to thaw before baking. Don't make the topping until you're ready to use.

I have been making this recipe for the last 5 years and is a winner every time.......the only change I recommend is to have 1/2 cup of organic butter mixed in and one cup for the topping. Best if made the day before!!!!

Yummy!  First time I every made sweet potato casserole and everyone at Thanksgiving loved it.  I did make some changes based on all the reviews that said it was very sweet.  Even though I like sweet, we have several diabetics so I cut down the sugar and butter.  Some noted some confusion about the cooking of the potatoes as well.  I used 5 large sweet potatoes.  Wrapped them in foil and baked in oven 400 degrees 1 1/2 hours or until tender.  Cool, peel and mash.  Then added all other ingredients cutting down the sugar (using 1/2 cup white and 3/4 cup brown), cut eggs down to 3, used 1/2 cup butter (one stick).  In the topping I also only used one stick of butter.  I made the sweet potato mix the day before.  They next day I warmed it up, added the topping and baked the additional 10 minutes.  It was great!  Thanks

Anything that gets my step son to eat sweet potatoes is ok in my book.  Everyone that tries this loves it.  I put the sweet potatoes wrapped in foil in with the turkey for about an hour then they are easy to peel and mash.  I will continue to make this for Thanksgivings to come.

Loved this recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving, not a week ago, and my husband begged me to make it again tonight.  He told me it was the best thing he's EVER eaten!!  I cut the white sugar in half and used 1/2 cup of margarine both times.  Will make again...Tonight!

This was very good, but with all of the other foods at Thanksgiving, this recipe made **way** too much.  Had 11 at the first Thanksgiving, and still brought 3/4 of it home.  It freezes very well.  Second time around I just defrosted and threw it in the oven to reheat.  Still have half of it left after the 2nd Thanksgiving.  Next time I will probably 1/2 the recipe.

Great twist on regular sweet potatoes! This was a hit and very easy to make. I used canned potatoes instead and it was super easy. I will add more coconut and marshmallows next time.

This was a good recipe and fairly easy to make.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it still turned out fine.  Used canned sweet potatoes so I did not have to boil fresh ones.  Seemed to make things easier.   Cut the butter in half as others had suggested. Overall a good recipe.

This is the best sweet potato casserole! I love sweet potatoes and coconut so it was great! Everyone loved this recipe, even my husband who doesn't really care for sweet potatoes. I used canned sweet potatoes to cut down on time and I added more marshmallows in with the topping. This is my favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal and I will definately make it every year!!

Great concept, but sweeter than most desserts!  I'll make it again, but this time I'll add another sweet potatoe (3 total), then mash with 1/2 of all ingredients!  Family loved it, but could only have a bite or two.

What an incredible dish!  I excluded the coconut but it still came out wonderfully.  It went over as a huge hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas and now everyone wants the recipe.  Its so sweet it could also be served as a dessert.

This dish is a miracle. I made this for X-mas dinner thinking only dad and I would eat it, but our table of 7 cleared out half the pan. Even my hubby, who 'hates' sweet potatoes, had two helpings! Brava Diana!

I don't even like sweet potatoes normally, but this recipe was excellent. I only made it because it had coconut in it and I thought that would be interesting and it was.

This was a real hit!  I made it without the marshmallows and substituted Splenda Baking mix for the sugar.  My diabeic family members didn't have a problem with it.  It was de-lish!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone really enjoyed it... a little bit different that our typical sweet potatoes and marshmallows.  The crunchy top was delicious!

Wow - this is a great recipe! 
I used a little less sugar and didn't include the coconut - I also just cubed the sweet potato instead of mashing it. It turned out great and was the hit of Thanksgiving. Thanks!

I made this recipe for a pre-thanksgiving get together at our friends house and received many compliments on it.  It is a wonderful recipe; the only change I made was that I omitted the ground nutmeg and put in a little less of the white sugar.   It was enjoyed by all.

I started making this about 3 years ago and have had requests every holiday ever since!  I don't use the coconut and I use canned yams so it comes out with no chunks of potatoes!  It is great and for a non-yam eater, I love it!!!

I use this recipe with a slight variation due to food allergies.  I skip the coconut and pecans and instead of corn flakes use rice krispies.  However, this recipe is the only reason my kids and myself will even touch sweet potatoes.

Thanks

This is the best recipe. I have to say, I don't even care for sweet potatoes and I love this. I have made it the last two holiday seasons and everyone loves it! It is now just given that I will be bringing it every year. My husband wants to know why I don't make it all the time.

I think I've been invited to dinner several times, just to bring this dish!
Every single person that has tried this, has LOVED it! Including all three of my picky eaters--who claim they don't like nuts or coconut.
Excellent holiday recipe that none of your guests will forget!  Yes, it is very sweet--that's what makes it a perfect "special occasion" dish!

Yum!  If you are looking for a yummy slightly different sweet potato recipe...you've found it.  I usually make a similar one to this without the coconut and marshmellows.  Very pleased.

This is a good recipe but can probably be made with less butter.  I took out some of the butter and it was still really good.  It was also a bit sweeter than I expected and time-consuming if you're cooking other side dishes.  I loved the taste but I think I'll stick with the traditional candied-yam recipe.  It's much more simple.

Exceptionally GOOD in every way!  I normally don't like sweet potatoes, but I will never have another holiday without these!  Even my sons (four grown ones!) raved about them!  I think the coconut really give this dish that special flavor.  Can't say enough good things about this one.  Will definitely cook this one again and again.

I don't like sweet potatoes at all but decided to try this since everyone else insisted on a sweet potato dish.  This recipe was all it took for me to LOVE them!  Everyone had seconds (even thirds!) and loved it.  This will be a new staple to our holiday dinners.

This Thanksgiving I made this sweet potato recipe.  Even those guests that don't like sweet potatos - loved it!  The kids didn't care for it much, but the adults did.  I did alter the amount of sugar to only 1 cup - it was still really sweet.  This is the first time I've ever had anyone ask me for a recipe.  Thanks!

I made this recipe when I hosted my very first thanksgiving dinner at my home.  It was the easiest thing I made all day and the BIGGEST hit!  I had to email the recipe to everyone that came!

I can't believe how wonderful this dish was.  It was almost a dessert.  My husband who doesn't particularly like fancy food, asked me to make it again.  We all loved it!  Thanks

Sweet.
You should eat meat of something else with it. Just as a main dish is not my kind of idea, to sweat for that.

This was very sweet but very yummy. I made it with half of the eggs and it still turned out great!

Okay - I followed the recipe but think I did something wrong - it was very soupy when my husband put it in the oven and I was convinced that I was going to have to throw it out.  I ended up having to take everything that was in oven out and cook it by itself for an additional 15 minutes  (made it for Thanksgiving) and it then set up and the family loved it.  rray

This recipe was wonderful, my family and friends loved it!  I don't care for sweet potatoes and even I liked it.  The topping is wonderful and could be used on other casseroles.

Very sweet, delicious sweet potato casserole!  I especially enjoyed the crunchy topping.  I will try to cut back on some of the sugar and marshmallows next time though.  Otherwise, fabulous.

I tried this for the fisrt time this Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  However, I find the recipe a little sweet for my tastes, but I would make this again.
