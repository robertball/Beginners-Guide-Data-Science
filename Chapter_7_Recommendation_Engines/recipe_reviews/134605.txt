Wow.  I was pretty skeptical about this recipe.  ("Tuscan"? I don't think so!)  But the reviews were so glowing...and boy were they right.  The crispy, toasty parmesan crust was a perfect match for the catfish, which was wonderfully tender.  (I left off the tomatoes to make sure the cooking was even.)  Quick, easily, and absolutely delicious.  One note -- definitely pay attention to the instruction to place the fish 4 inches from the broiler, not right by the flames!

This was really tasty. The fish didn't get cooked with the tomato slices on top, so I shoved them to the side. I had to keep it in the broiler for three additional minutes. It took six minutes on each side for exposed catfish to cook. I added mushrooms. I'll definitely make this again!

I am a big catfish fan, actually most all fish.  This hit the spot this evening.  I noticed I had some frozen fillets in the freezer and had all the other ingredients.  About 25 minutes later, I was enjoying my supper.  I didn't alter the recipe, which is my tendancy on the second and third tries.  As-is, this is a winner.  I wil try it with mahi-mahi or grouper next.

Very good and very easy to make.  My husband loved it.  I didn't have lemon juice but used Italian Dressing instead to lightly coat the catfish.

This was very good and quick.  My only suggestion is to put the tomatoes on the side while broiling so the whole top of the fish gets a bit crispy.

This was easy and very tasty.  I rinsed and patted dry the filets and doused them with the lemon juice.  Then I baked them for 15 minutes at 400.  The plum tomatoes didn't look any good at the store so I bought grape tomatoes instead and used those.  I washed them and cut them in half.  I mixed them into the parm/butter/mayo mix and I added in some dried italian seasoning, then spread it on top of the fish and broiled the whole thing like that.  If you like fish try this dish!

Although some people may be hesitant to try this dish, please do try it!  It’s very good.  I made it exactly as stated, except I used canned diced tomatoes since I didn’t have any Roma.  I also used light mayo and sprinkled a little parsley on top after broiling for added color.  This recipe is a nice change from the regular cornmeal/flour coated catfish dish.  However, if you’re looking for a more traditional “fishy” catfish meal, this might not be for you; it’s wonderful, but all the ingredients mask most of the fishy taste (but that’s not always a bad thing!).

Very tasty I'm not a huge fan of catfish, but the freshly grated parmesan cheese crust and lemon made this dish one of my favorites. The only thing I did differently was I put the fish in a bowl and coated the fish in lemon juice, turning it over to evenly distribute the lemon. Oh and definitely add the tomatoes and sauce on top of the fish on the last 6 minutes of broiling the tomatoes were such a wonderful touch. Everyone enjoyed and went back for seconds, can't wait to make again.

This recipe is delicious! Really it is universal, it could be used on almost any type of fish. We had red snapper, and it was great. Because the fillets were so thick, I broiled each side first, then added the mayo/parm/butter mixture. I sliced the romas paper thin, and lightly salted and peppered them before the final broil. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, it will become a regular in our house.

This is some awesome stuff!  My whole family devoured it.  I changed it slightly by marinating the fish in a zip lock bag with the lemon juice and S&P for about 10 minutes.  Then broiled as normal but I did add garlic and crushed red pepper to the cheese mixture.  The best baked fish recipe I have ever found.  One thing that will make a really big difference is to only use Roma tomatoes and slice paper thin.  I had 4 large pieces of fish and only used 1 Roma.  This is key in keeping the fish nice and crispy instead of getting soggy.  Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Wonderful recipe. I've done this with catfish and swai. Both were delicious. I serve it over rice or egg noodles.

Very simple and easy - loved it.  If I have them around to use next time - a sprinkling of fresh herbs (basil?) on the top might be a nice addition too.  Thanks so much!

Prepared just as directed, and it came out superbly done.  Nice presentation, too.  Used the roma tomatoes instead of sundried.  It will be a staple in our home.  Thanks!

It was so quick and easy and mighty tasty. I didn't have any Parmesan to grate so I used grated Asiago cheese instead. My 97 year old mother who was a gourmet cook in her younger days also liked it.

This was a great recipe, my husband and daughter loved it!  I tweeked it just a bit by adding 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the cheese mixture. I cooked the fish and added sliced tomatoes for the last minute or two.  I did cook it a bit longer to golden up the cheese before putting on the tomatoes. This will be made again!

Although the topping by itself tasted good, I didn't like it with catfish.  I like catfish a lot, just not this way.  The dish might taste really good with a milder tasting fish like sole or red snapper, so I might try it again with one of those fishes, but definitely not with catfish.

This was fantastic.  I used sun-dried tomatoes that were sliced really thin and had been packed in oil.  It gave it an amazing flavor.  Another thing I liked about this recipe is that it is really simple and I could have a gourmet meal on the table in no time.

Great recipe! The best part was the crispy edges from the browning of the cheese. Yummy!

The first time I made it, I did it exactly as the recipe said. The second time, I didn't have catfish so I used tilapia instead. It was just as good!

This was the first time I tried to cook catfish (Swai). My broiler and I do not always agree on what is going on in the oven, and I turned it on and let it get to 400, which is a good thing since by the time I had put on the Parmesan cheese/butter/mayonnaise mixture with the tomatoes, and let it broil for the requisite 6 minutes, the tomatoes were nearly charcoal. Probably will try again and put the sun-dried tomatoes on only the last 2 minutes or so. The fish has a very delicate flavor and is very tender. I also had it 8" from the heat instead of 4" otherwise I probably would have had the entire meal charcoal!

It was okay, but I am not the biggest catfish fan.  My husband did enjoy it.  I would definitely recommend adding the sundried tomatoes at the VERY end, as I burned mine.

Wow.  We loved this.  I did add some garlic to the butter/parmesan cheese mixture.  I also sauted some mushrooms but did not add them to the fish. I did not put the tomatoes on top of the fish, I just cooked them along side.  All together it was a great combination.  I will make this again.  Will also try it with tilapia.

This was really great!  I followed the suggestion of cooking the fish then adding the topping and broiling to melt the cheese.  For us, this resulted in the catfish being a little overdone, next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  Otherwise, the flavor is really good.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden between the topping and the fish.  Historically, I thought of catfish as a "" fish that really wasn't good for eating.  Boy was I mistaken!

This recipe is amazing!!! It is so simple and quick to put together. My husband accidentally bought catfish instead of our usual tilapia, so I had to find a recipe since I've never made it before. I wish I doubled the recipe because it is that good! I omitted the mayonnaise since I didn't have any, and I don't feel like it's missing any flavor. I broiled each side for 6 minutes each, and then I topped it with sliced tomatoes and mushrooms. I broiled it for another 6 minutes. An easy, healthy meal that can be made any weeknight.

I really really enjoyed this.  I did set off both smoke alarms in the house with the broiler, but it was worth it...  I didn't have the right tomatoes, so I just sprinkled some canned diced tomatoes over the top of these when they went back in the oven.  Wonderful flavor, and not overpowering like I was worried it would be.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

YUMMMMMMM!! I really liked this recipe. The parmesan/mayo topping added a lot of flavor to the fish, which came out very juicy and tender. I substitued mahi mahi instead of catfish and served it with scalloped potatos and squash. GOOD STUFF;-)

I've never had catfish before, non the less made it, so needless to say, I was more than happy about the way it turned out! So tasty, and the texture was perfect.

Awesome!  To cut back on some sodium I omitted the 1/2 teaspoon salt from the recipe.  -and it was still full of flavor.  (..next time I'll try salt free butter.)

Delicious.  I used garlic in the butter mayo mix and roma tomatoes for the broil.  My filets were Swai from Viet Nam.  Thanks.  We'll have this alot!

Very, very good. The only changes I made was adding 1/4 cup bread crumbs to the cheese mixture and instead of putting the tomatoes on the fish I diced the Romas and put them in a small glass baking dish and added a little italian seasoning, minced garlic, salt and pepper and put them in the oven for the time I was broiling the fish, I stirred them occasionally and it made a very nice relish/sauce/salsa to put on the fish after the cheese mixture had broiled into a nice crusty covering.  My 3 year old even ate all hers.  My hubby says its a keeper!!! (He has been a semi-professional cook and baker for years so I always strive to meet his approval!)  I think I will try it with a little feta or manchego cheese and dice some red onions into the tomato mixture next time. It could be amazing!!!

I agree with the rest:  excellent recipe! Can be used on a variety of white fish, which is nice because our family's not a fan of catfish. The flavor is fabulous... made us enjoy the catfish tonight!

This tasted very good but all I kept thinking was, "I can't believe I'm eating butter mixed with mayonnaise!" I would have to find a healthier way to make this before I ever make it again.

I liked it, but my guy didn't.  He doesn't like "cooked mayo" so next time I'll substitute something for it.  The filets were real light and tender!

I accidentally bought tilapia because it was as thick as the catfish and right next to it. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The mayo and butter made it to greasy for me but I do have a sensitive stomach. My husband LOVED it with the mayo and butter. I wish I could do 3 1/2 stars because I was so torn. What made me go with 4 is the flavor was great. But  I didn't like that there wasn't much crisp. Next time I will Pan fry it. I couldn't cook it long enough to crisp it in the oven without overlooking the fish.

I like it. Sometimes simplicity is key. Less is best. and I let my fish cook a little longer than six minutes. Coated the pan with olive oil.

My husband loved this!  I used swai fish, which is very similar to catfish but usually cheaper, at least where we live.  I broiled from the middle of the oven as it was getting too brown, too quickly from the higher rack.

Thank you Anne Marie - this was fantastic! I didn't have catfish but found some frozen tilapia in the fridge - it was divine! I think this would work with any white fish. Even my 3yr old and my 10 month old loved it - we will definitely make again.

We never had catfish, but it was on sale at the store & we decided to give it a shot. Was looking for a recipe make with what was in the cupboards and not having to go out again for other ingredients. Well, it was quick, easy, and delicious!! We are definitely keeping this one and will share with other family members. My daughter asked for seconds, which she normally wouldn't with other fish.
We altered recipe ever so slightly to adjust for additional (5) & slightly larger (6 oz) fillets.
'BRAVO'.

Easy to make and REALLY tasty!  My boyfriend and I were able to prep and cook this dish in under 20 minutes, and it turned out delicious.  We added a little garlic to it too, just because I love garlic.  Excellent recipe!

AWESOME!!!!My whole family really enjoyed this meal and yes, I was a little scared to try it but I am glad I did.  It did not have that fishy taste to it and I used italian diced tomato's instead of roma or sun dried.  Definitely  is a keeper!

An absolutely wonderful way to cook Catfish!  Instead of the tomato on top I use spaghetti sauce, and for the mayo I substituted a small scoop of french onion dip because we didn't have any mayo.  Aside from these two changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  This one is a keeper!

This is mine and my husbands favorite fish recipe. I make it once a week. I add 1/4 to each of garlic powder, oregano, rosemary, and marjoram to the cheese mixture. And I put some balsamic vinegar and basil on top of the tomato.  It is super delicioud.

It turned out to be great! My husband loved it. I think i just need to go easy on the lemon. Also, broiling the fish for 6 minutes on each side is a little too much. i wasn't able to turn it very easily. i think it should be 3 minutes the first time around and then 5 minutes the second time.

This is an excellent recipe. It's simple, quick, and delicious. I used lemon pepper in place of the lemon juice and black pepper, and added the tomato towards the end (maybe 2 minutes of cooking time left) as some other reviewers suggested. Cooking time is relative -- I usually broil it until the Parmesan is mostly browned and will pull it out if I notice anything starting to blacken. I've made this for family and friends and have gotten nothing but positive feedback and lots of requests for the recipe.

Just made this tonight, cooking the tomatoes alongside the fish (and with added fresh herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary) and dried Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture, this was GREAT!!! Definitely "company quality," if you get my drift. Highly recommended. I just broiled the fish on one side, as instructed, then put on the coating (which  is fabulous!), then pushed the fish aside for the herbed tomatoes. Grilled it all another 5-6 minutes, till the coating browned, and voila! Delicioso!

I prepared this on top of couscous and sautéed spinach and it was so good!  Very easy.  The only thing i did different was flip the fish, added lemon, garlic salt /w parsley, pepper and parmesan topping and broiled for a few minutes until topping browned before i added chopped roma tomatoes and then i broiled an addtl 6 min.  I was using pretty large filets so the extra time was needed.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very good, I followed others advice and put the tomatoes on the side. My husband couldn't tell it was catfish, it was flavorful but not at all "fishy"

Really yummy. Only problem was using broiler pan. Wonderful topping ran off and ended up in bottom section. Next time ( and there will be a next time soon) I will line regular baking fish with foil so I can capture all the runoff.

Instant hit!  I used red, orange, and yellow peppers to replace tomatoes.  Tempted to try with Lebanese garlic paste in place of mayonnaise.

Great with any fish! I added a picture with pollock, but you can use any fish really. The only thing I added was 1/4 cup of Panko (Asian Sesame)bread crumbs. My family just loves this recipe- a real winner!

Delicious!  I added 2 crushed cloves of garlic with the salt and pepper and peeled and seeded the tomatoes. As well, I used tilapia instead of catfish and added 2 tablespoons of capers. It was quick and easy for a weeknight meal served with roasted fingerling potatoes. Thank you Ann Marie for a fabulous recipe!

I made this recipe with Swai which is similar to catfish but better because it doesn't taste muddy or fishy at all.  If you're apprehensive about fish and the taste, try this with Swai and you'll love it.  This is a very easy recipe to make and as with all fish, cooks very quickly.

This was delicious! I served it over some whole wheat couscous. Only change was the use of margarine, and in doing so the salt was omitted. I chose to use sun-dried tomatoes as we didn't have any kind of fresh tomatoes; mine were the pre-chopped kind so I just used the amount that I thought looked right. These aren't saucy, but when you eat your starch, veggie and the fish in one bite it feels as if it were and it's divine.
