The footnotes mentioned substituting walnuts or pecans for the pine nuts and so walnuts it was. This was really good but the dressing lacked a little. I ended up adding some dried herbs I had in the pantry and this did the trick. I also added some sliced mushrooms because they just go with spinach and bacon. All in all good fresh salad. Thanks for sharing!
