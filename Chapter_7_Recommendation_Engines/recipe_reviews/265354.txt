I'm always looking for great Gluten free recipes as my mom has celiac..but I want the food to taste great for those of us who do like gluten too.  This was perfect and a good use for the green tomatoes in my garden that I just can't wait to eat until they turn red!

Love this recipe. Started second batch in the microwave, skipped egg wash, just dipped into parmesan & italian spices. Really good.
