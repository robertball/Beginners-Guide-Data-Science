i skipped a few ingredients as i didnt have them (vanilla essence, baking powder ,nutmeg and replaced coco oil with olive) and for some rason the pancakes wouldnt stay together?
i'll try again with all the ingredients..otherwise pretty good.. bit bland without all the spices i guess so i added a bit of salt and honey after cooking.. anyone know why thy fell apart? also the mixture was very thick and did not spread out by itself..

When the 'ulu ripens too quickly, this is a great recipe to use. My baby loves them, and I can freeze them after making. Can take out a few at a time when I need them.
