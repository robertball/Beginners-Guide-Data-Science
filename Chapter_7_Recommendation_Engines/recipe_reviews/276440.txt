Been making my greens pretty much this way for years except I leave out the brown sugar as we do not like our greens sweet.  Mostly I just throw all those ingredients together and give it a taste every now and then to make sure it's right.  My southern mother-in-law introduced me to greens and I love them...especially fixed this way!

These were pretty good! I had to add more liquid after about 20 mins of simmering, as the pot was getting pretty dry. Covering the pot would have probably helped with that, but the directions did not mention using a lid.  I halved the recipe, however I do suggest doubling the bacon. Nice flavor from the vinegar and brown sugar. I had to cook the greens an extra 8-10 mins to get them tender to my liking.

My hubby made these for Thanksgiving. Cooked about 25 minutes. Greens were done enough, but he did actually add 4 extra oz. of chicken stock. Flavor was a little too sweet for our liking. Will use my Mother-in-law's recipe next time.

I made this and my husband loved them. I did not make any changes . But the next time I will add more pepper flakes.
