Needed more fruit and more sour cream to make the dish the right consistency and flavor intensity.

Very easy to make and tastes great. Good alternative to chocolate. I stirred in the cherry juice. Kind of fell apart a little, but there was nothing left within 15 minutes.

I made this exactly. I didn't care much for it. it's like its trying to be a cheesecake but isn't. my husband and mother loved it, though. mom even ask for the recipe.
