I give this recipe 5 stars with my changes. Most importantly, I wait to add the gravy (sour cream sauce) until serving. I served the gravy in a gravy boat and let everyone add their own. This way the pork steaks are not swimming in the gravy. I changed the gravy a bit by using 2 cans of soup - 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken. I added extra mushrooms and a small chopped onion to the sauce. I chopped some of the mushrooms fine and left the rest bigger because I like the big chunks. I would also suggest crisping up the pork steaks in the broiler for a couple of minutes after baking and BEFORE adding any sauce. Yum, yum! Serve with mashed potatoes topped with the same gravy. (I added a picture!)

Used boneless pork chops for this recipe and cream of chicken soup with herbs for more flavor.  This was amazing.  The meat was very tender and delicious.  The sauce was great over white rice.  Thanks for the post...definately will make again.

My husband is the the pork chop king.  He could eat them 7 days a week but he never had pork cube steaks.  He went wild over these!  I used Smart Balance to brown them in.  Didn't want to open a can of chicken bouillion for only a 1/2 c. so used 1 T. chicken soup base in 1/2 c. water.  Also, up'd the garlic a bit to 1/4 t.  "Roasted Garlic and Savory Spices" was the seasoned breadcrumbs I used.  They turned out PERFECTLY.  Moist inside with a nice crust.  You could cut them with a fork.  As someone else said, next time I will double the gravy for the mashed potatoes I served with them.  A true keeper!!!  Thank you very much; I can hear his request already for this one over and over.

The pork chops were very tender and the sauce was delicious.  I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them, but did everything else exactly according to the directions.  Yum!

This is absolutely our favorite meal!  I have used chicken, pork tenderloin, pork chops and pork roast for this recipe and they are all delicious. The only problem I have is we always eat more of it then we should because no matter how much I make I never have leftovers! Thank you so much for sharing this!

It was ok. The sauce was very reminiscent of stroganoff. Would have been nice with sauteed onions. Went well with egg noodles. I didn't think the meal was spectacular, but not bad.

The only changes I made were to use boneless pork chops, I omitted the rosemary, and I cooked them in the oven, covered, for 40 mins. The chops came out moist, tender and flavorful. Thanks!

Perfect comfort food!  I didn't have any cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom instead.  I also didn't use any fresh mushrooms, just mixed the sauce mixture together and poured over the meat.  I used half the amount of meat but kept the sauce the same so i'd have plenty for gravy.  Baking time was perfect and the pork came out very fork tender!

This was absolutley delicious! I used this with beef cube steaks instead of pork, they were way cheaper at my grocery store. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken, beef broth and added a splash of red wine to the sauce.  I didn't bake these, just fryed the steaks on the stovetop and served over rice with gravy on top. Thanks for the awesome recipe, we will be making this one again often:)

Very rich but delicious!!  My sauce came out a little oily so next time I will make sure that any oil not absorbed by the pork steaks in drained and use less butter.  I added some extra sour cream to the sauce after cooking and it thickened up well.  I may also use more spices in the pork breading next time for some extra flavor.

This was very ok; I'm not a fan of recipes with soup in them, and I'm afraid this didn't help me overcome that opinion. Just very ok; wasn't a rich sauce, and was very much like souped-up soup. I would not go out of my way to buy pork cube steaks just to make this. People who go for this kind of sauce (you know who you are) would like it just as well over cheaper cuts of beef. BTW I ignored the chicken stock addition b/c I didn't think that was a make-or-break ingredient; I did not add water in its place.

My whole family loves this recipe.  The only thing I do different is leave out the rosemary.  I live in a tiny town, and it's not available at our grocery store or I would use it :)  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This was delicious, made lots of sauce to cover mashed potatoes.  I added 1 sliced onion while the mushrooms were browning in butter then added 1/4 cup white wine to simmer and reduce a bit.  I let it bake about 20 minutes longer as my chops were on the thick side.  Dish came out beautifully.  Will be making this again, maybe trying with chicken breasts.  Nice flavors!

After two bites, my husband said this recipe was a keeper! I didn't change anything except to add a shallot before adding in the mushrooms. Oh, and I followed the advice of one review that mentioned holding the gravy while the meat finishes cooking in the oven. I think that when I make it again, I'll add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to give it a little more of a kick. a

Easy recipe.  I skipped the rosemary and put on the gravy at the end.  The TIME IS WRONG.  It does not take 1 hour to bake.  I baked it for 1 hour and it was a little burnt.  I think 40 minutes is long enough for this dish.  It still turned out good but the timing is very wrong.

Excellent.  I used fresh rosemary as I had it on hand.  Also used 1/2 packet of no sodium chicken powder which I mixed into 1/2 c dry white wine.  A keeper!

Found some pork cube steaks on sale so I decided to try this recipe out. It was really good. I used homemade cream of chicken and used fresh unseasoned bread crumbs because I forgot to add some herbs to it. Served with "Grandma's Noodles II" and  roasted root vegetables.

This was great...even my kids liked it!  I did omit the mushrooms so it would pass the kid inspection. However, I think it would have been great with mushrooms. A definite add to my list!

The meat came out so tender and the flavors worked well together. I added a couple of extra fresh cloves of garlic and a little more rosemary. I made enough for two meals and it paired well with mashed potatoes and rice. This recipe is worth making again.

This was easy to make and yummy.  I didn't add the mushrooms as my husband doesn't like them. It still came out great.

Very yummy, especially over white rice!  I omitted the rosemary because we aren't fans of it.

The thing I changed was I used cream of mushroom soup instead and actual mushrooms and mixed my sour cream with that. I also used Italian bread crumbs.

I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I made it with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I only had a little over a pound of cubed steaks, so there was plenty of gravy to go over the mashed potatoes I made with it.  Tasty meal for a cold winter night!

Perfect with no changes made! My husband took one bite and was in love! I've never made cubed pork chops before,  but I definitely will again. Added bonus...the pork steaks were marked down!  Had with mashed potatoes and green beans and carrots.

My husband I and really enjoyed this.  I read through some of the previous reviews and some stated it needed more flavor.  I added a diced onion with the mushrooms when cooking in the skillet.  It was very tender and delicious.

This recipe was awesome. You could cut the meat with a fork it was so tender. My husband said it was killer good. I will make this again when I have company and when my kids come home to visit.

It was great. Instead of cream of chicken soup, I substituted cream of mushroom and since I didn't have rosemary I used rustic herb spice from tastefully simple, and lastly I used andys fish breading instead of breadcrumbs.

Creamy, dreamy comfort food!  I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used chicken breasts instead of pork and pan-fried them in breading as suggested.  I made the sauce in a saucepan, adding some steamed broccoli just before serving it over pasta and the chicken, which I baked for 1/2 hour on a cookie tray without the sauce because I like it more crispy.

I used half meat mixture of pork tenderloin and smoked ham. Added 1 T. garlic and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper to the sauce. Then baked the gravy mixture over cooked egg noodles. It was very good.
