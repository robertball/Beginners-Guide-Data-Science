I tried these last night for the first time.  Before I cook a recipe I read all the reviews to get ideas of how I may want to amend it.
I dropped the bread crumbs (Italian) to 1.2 C per pound, added in a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, dribbled in a touch of Tobasco Chipotle (it gets hot quickly!), a few passes of Adobo seasoning, and about 2 cloves of fresh garlic per pound.  I also added a few squeezes of Deli Mustard.
The twist I did was I added ALL the ingredients to the beef- including the sauce ingredients.  Wrapped with bacon, and grilled.  They were excellent!!
Yes, I admit that adding the sauce ingredients was a bit of an accident as I had a child or two continually vying for attention. :)  I made up 5 lbs of this using my Kitchen Aid and now I have 4 more meals in the freezer ready to be cooked.  Very good!

I made these on my grill and they worked out great.  The sauce is what really makes these outstanding, not the bacon.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the recipe.

The flavor was good with a texture very similar to meatloaf.  Overall, I found it to be too dry, and I suspect the 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs was the culprit.  Perhaps reducing it to 1/2 cup may solve the dilemma...  My husband and son approved of it, therefore, it will remain in the "once in a while" file.  Overall, this is a solid 3 star recipe as written.  Thank you for the submission POFELY.

My husband took his first bite of his "filet" tonight, and immediately said, "This is a five star recipe -- I can tell after the first bite."  So I'm dutifully listing it at five stars. :)  It is quite good and really simple to make -- it's got a bit of a "meatloaf" quality to it (in a good way), but it looks more elegant.  I used pre-cooked bacon to wrap the patties, as we prefer crispy bacon.  Other than the bacon, I followed the recipe exactly.

Maybe this should be called "Happy Hubby Filets"! My husband really loved this one and asked me to put it in my regular rotation. This was easy to make, very tasty and freezes well for future lunches. Thanks for the recipe Vickie!

I saw this recipe a while back and thought it looked interesting, then last night my wife suggested to make this for dinner and we loved it.  They have such a nice flavor and make a very good meal.  We had some left over, so I took one in to work the next day and reheated it, and everybody kept commenting on how good it smelled and looked.

This dish has a slight sweet flavor to it which makes it nice.  I did tweak the recipe a bit to my liking.  I felt the amount of bread crumbs requested would dry out the beef, particularly lean ground beef.  I cut it down to about 1/2 of what was asked and added a 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce.  I'd say they're more of a mock mini-meatloaf than a mock filet.  Though they are full flavor, they didn't quite hit a 5-star mark.

Really a good recipe.  I did use ground turkey.  Added a bit of worchestersire sauce.  I topped with sauted onions and mushrooms.  Really delicious.

They were good mini meatloaves :) I did change the sauce because we are not huge ketchup fans by adding a tblsp or two of steak sauce and because I do not have dry mustard I used dijon mustard. And so the only complaint that came to me was that they wish there had been more sauce! Thanks!

It tasted like a dry meat loaf, it wasnt bad, but I do think the sauce helps , I did not want to waste bacon on this since I do not like bacon wrapped around a good filet. I just sliced it cold the next day and made a meatloaf sandwich, now that was good!
I might make again since my sig other like it.

Very good, my husband liked them much better than the filet minon they were trying to imitate!   I thought it tasted like a pretty good meatloaf, wrapped in bacon.  I used panko bread crumbs, and it actually needed the full amount recommended instead of halving it like many reviewers said.  I guess typical breadcrumbs soak up more moisture than panko.  That or my extra-large eggs had something to do with it.  Either way, tasty!  I served it with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.

I wanted to LOVE this...I really did.  I read many of the reviews and went into this knowing that it was going to be "meatloaf-ish."  However, it really wasn't even up to par with meatloaf.  It was rather bland and, believe it or not, the bacon really didn't add that much to it.  Thanks anyway!

We really like this, and I'm not that easy to please.  It looks good, tastes good, is not expensive, is a little bit different and is quick and easy to make - everything I'm looking for.  The bacon adds a really nice look and extra flavor to what is essentially a tiny meatloaf.  It's great just the way it is, but I add a little garlic powder just because I add garlic to most ground beef dishes.

These were really good.  I cooked them on the grill, and omitted the sauce.  I think a good steak sauce like A1 would have been great, because they needed something.  These were more like fancy hamburgers than mini-meatloaves.  I would  definitely make these again, except my husband didn't care for them.  I'm not sure why, they are basically just  hamburgers wrapped in bacon.  What's not to love?  I'm stll giving it five stars, I think he was just tired last night.

I did not like this recipe. My husband said it was just ok. I do not think it tasted anything like a filet. It was like a little meatloaf. The recipe did give me an idea for making small meatloaves like this and wrapping them in bacon. I was just expecting more from this recipe.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! The only thing we do differently is add liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce to the meat. This gives the filets a great smokey flavor.

My whole family loves these - we make them instead of hamburgers or meatloaf.  To those who think the name is misleading, the ingredient list will tell you it's basically meatloaf. The size and bacon wrapping give it the name.  One note, though, use good quality ground beef.  It definitely makes a difference.

This recipe was easy to make.  It tasted more like a meatloaf, that's what my husband and son thought it was when I served it.  

It tasted fine but nothing I would rave about, just a nice easy meal.

This was definately something different.
I enjoyed it and so did my husband...Other reviews say it's like meatloaf...taste nothing like my meatloaf....I didn't need as many helping as the recipe called for so I just made it all up and individually froze 3 of the portions...it will be nice for a quick meal in the future.
I served with buttered egg noodles and beets. It was very moist and tender and had a nice flavor...Thanks for a new recipe.

Family approved! (DH, 10 & 3 yo)  Made with ground turkey and turkey bacon.  Used everything except shorted the breadcrumbs by 1/4c.  Every recipe for ground beef/turkey seemed to be meatloaf, meatballs,  burgers or chili, so this was a nice variation.  ....however, and I am not sure if it was because it was turkey, but it really just tasted like great meatloaf.  (But so much quicker to make!)  The sauce for the top was fabulous, wish I had made a little extra for dipping.  So be sure to get it all on the top, it is delicious and makes the meal!  Very happy and already requested again!

This was good, although more like meatloaf than steak.  We grilled them and I added a little Worcestershire and garlic salt to the meat mixture.

Wasn't a fan. You are better off either making meatloaf or just buying real fillets.

I have been making these for years!  This is a great adaptable recipe. I've made this as a meat loaf and also meatballs, with praise from those eating it. The sauce is a must though, it really makes the recipe.

Its pretty good, although i changed some ingredients,  i used green pepper instead onion, but added onion powder, also added some burger seasoning when i grilled them. The sauce is too sweet for us, next time would love to try it with gravy.

Quick, simple, and very good. I used ground sirloin, an onion bun instead of bread crumbs, a splash of milk, only 1 egg, precooked bacon strips and made 8 patties instead of 6. I didn't have to tie or secure the bacon the strips stayed put just fine. These looked fancy and dressed up a plain meal just a little. Thanks!

Basically it's mini-meatloafs.  A nice idea, quite simple and tasty.  Nothing really special but easy weekday meal.

I thought they were good but tasted like meatloaf rolled with bacon, not filet. However my husband looked at them and thought they were filets! He  enjoyed them -that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 3. I would definitely use precooked bacon the next time.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but I wanted to use up some ground beef, so I thought I'd give it a try.  The only change I made was I crushed up stuffing from a box, since that was the closest thing I had to bread crumbs.  My 2 year old LOVED it!  I will have to make it again just for him!

I am never making "meat loaf" again!  This is a winning recipe that I have made several times now...both in the broiler and on the grill.  I do suggest, especially for the grill, to pre-cook the bacon a little.  Yummy!!!

My picky husband liked it, so that says a lot!  Will definitely make again, but I'll probably try using tomato sauce or BBQ sauce in the topping.  I love ketchup, but it was a bit much for this recipe.

Meh, it really did taste just like meatloaf.  I was skeptical as others..because the recipe is  very  similar to my own meatloaf recipe- only to be justified.  I never would have thought to broil a meatloaf though, so it sped up the process and I may do that again.  I might not have been as dissapointed if these had been called mini- bacon wrapped meatloafs...but they are called something misleading.  I probably won't make these again.

Very good! I used yellow mustard instead of powder in the sauce. I also used onion powder cuz I didn't have onions. I used thin sliced bacon and only broiled on one side for 5 minutes and then flipped them and topped with sauce and broiled for 3 minutes and then turned the broiler off and just left them in the oven set at 350º for about 10 minutes. Perfect. I want more right now!

Well it wasn't "meaty" enough for my husband but for me and the kids, it was perfect!  And super easy to make.  I didn't have any onion so I added red pepper chopped up instead and it was great!  I think next time I'll hide another veggie in there too for an added boost.  Will definitely make again.

After reading many reviews I was afraid of having mini meatloaves, so I used just under 3/4 cups of breadcrumbs, I only made half of the topping and used it on 3 of the "filets" the other three I topped with a mixture of A1 steak sauce and what was left of the ketchup topping, these came out wonderfully.  I only cooked them for 8 mins the first time because they were getting too dark, and 5  the 2nd time which was enough time because they were done and juicy on the inside. Served with creamy au gratin potatoes (from this site) I will definatly make these again

I made these for my kids and my parents and everyone really liked them.  It reminded me of meatloaf, but the texture was a bit better, and the bacon gave them a little different flavor.  My kids all say they hate meatloaf, but they loved having these individually.  They will dry out quickly, though, if you cook them too long.

These looked cute with the bacon wrapped around them acting as the "fat" of the "steak".  I didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand, so didn't use them.  I think the breadcrumbs would've given these a meatloafy flavor anyway(I hate meatloaf).  So whenever I do make these, I will omit the breadcrumbs.  Next time, I might use a different kind of sauce though.  With just the dried mustard, it still just tasted like ketchup to me, so added prepared mustard.  That part could use a little tweaking.  Overall, not bad at all considering I had dinner on the table in less than 30 mins!  I will make these again.

This is sooo good!  An instant favorite and easy to make.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added a clove of garlic with the chopped onions, otherwise followed it exactly.  The sauce is nice too, I'll make a little extra next time.  This one is a family pleaser for sure!

I really liked these - they remind me of individual size meatloaves. My only change was using some herbs and spices in addition to the listed ingredients. I made the patties early in the day, then just left them in the refridgerator until we were ready for dinner - made for some fast meal-makin'!

essentially, this recipe makes a glorified version of meatloaf...which is good if you are a fan of that sort of thing. the flavor was good (i added some worchestershire, a clove of garlic and some honey), but i think spicing up the sauce and seasoning the meat MUCH more may counteract that "meat-loafy" feeling, too. also, i think i inadvertantly kept it from drying out by broiling on low for 8 min. and then 4 with the sauce, respectively. all in all, i think i'd try this again (with more spices, of course), but probably not for a while.

These were great and were very easy to make.  I added about 2-3 cloves of garlic to give this a little more flavor.  Also, I would highly recommend using a broiler pan (don't forget to line with foil!) to drain off some of the bacon fat.

My boyfriend is a huge fan of meatloaf (me, not so much) so I decided to give this recipe a try. It was incredible! The boyfriend agreed that this is the only way we will make it from now on - so easy and flavorful just as the recipe is written. Thanks for making me a fan of meatloaf again!

Yes, these are a weird 'mock steak' but amazing little meatloaves - the hubby and I loved every single bite. Used a lined jelly roll pan with a rack in it which worked great - so much bacon fat rendered down into it. Never got this to work in the broiler (the middle never cooked) but cooked this at 400 for 20 minutes on 1 side, then flipped it for another 10 minutes, adding the sauce after the flip. This did the trick for the size meatloaves we made. Doubled the recipe and got 10 little loaves, and followed the recipe (used 93/7 beef and glad I did). Only had 1 cup of breadcrumbs left which was perfect (tried the full amount later and found it too much). After adding in the egg, the mix almost got too mushy/liquidy, but the patties stuck together fine and were moist.  Really easy, really delicious - and a perfect 'cabinet meal' for us.  Thank you to the reviewers that say this freezes great - I can't wait to try that for a quick freezer meal. Needed all of the sauce recipe.

Did on BBQ. Family loved it. Basically a 5 star recipe. All of the ingredients inside the "steak". Used one egg , lots of bread crumbs, worshtishire, 1.5 pound made enough for 7 of us. Very filling.

These weren't bad, but they weren't anything amazing either.  Certainly not "filet-like", just a pretty decent bacon-wrapped burger.

This was so good, so moist and delish! The bacon wrapped around it really makes it, only thing I didn't do was not make the ketchup sauce and I'm glad I didn't. You have all got to try this dish!

I have tried quite a few recipes on this site. I read reviews & try anything 4+Stars. This was disappointing. My family asked if they were hamburger or meatloaf. Flavor was off. This was not a hit just a Big miss.

Was really tasty but I would put extra sauce on it so it wouldnt be so dry in some areas. It would get a 5* if it had more sauce :)

My family loved this!  One mock filet was not enough for my 9 and 12 year old because they loved it so much.  I adjusted the bread crumbs to 2/3 cup and pre broiled the bacon (lightly) as suggested.  I also use egg substitute to lighten the recipe a little.

DH stopped by house on his way to the local sportsbar to watch football with the boys.  After smelling the end of the cooking, he thought he'd have a taste.  He was late meeting the boys! (teenage son was happy, too!)  Only change was to add a little crushed garlic and two dashes of worchestershire.  Bacon was mostly pre-cooked.  Good and quick!  Thanks for sharing!

These were easy to prepare and came out quite good.  Added a little worcestershire and liquid smokey stuff my hubby likes.  Only had turkey bacon on hand.  I'm sure regular bacon would've been great, though.  Didn't want to make tacos or meatloaf tonight...this was a great change. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy.  My husband and his friend both cleaned their plates.  And  yes, it is similar to meatloaf, but I agree, it should be obvious by the ingredients.  I made the same as the recipe, but this looks like a very easy recipe to tweek with extra ingredients.  Mine did take a little longer to cook, probably because I made them 1/3 lb each.  Mine was not dry at ll.

I would have given it 5 stars but I'm still confused on cooking time. I had to oven cook it then broil both sides( burnt bacon a little.)I would put extra sauce on it next time (both sides.)

First of all, My husband really liked this. He said that you could not tell the difference between these mock fillets and and the real thing just by looking at them. Very nice presentation, very cute.   Second, they tasted good. The bacon really set it off and gave it a nice smokey flavor. But, they are just personal portioned meatloaves. Don't get me wrong, they were great! It was easy cleanup and we didn't have a whole pan of meatloaf into a Tupperware container. Plus, we didn't have to portion them out of leftovers the next day!  Thirdly, nothing complicated. We had all the ingredients off hand. I didn't have to go to the store and buy something special for this recipe.   BUT while broiling, I would monitor their done-ness half way through the process. I believe that if I hadn't been watching them, they would have burned.   This recipe was good and I will definitely make it again. But I am giving it four stars because it really is just like meatloaf. I will replace meatloaf night with "Mock Fillet" night because it is just easier to make than my usual meatloaf routine and it makes meatloaf night fun!   Thank you!

DH loved this recipe. The rest of us, so so -- I do make a good meatloaf recipe, however this was a nice change with not too much work.  The bacon is a nice touch for more flavor.

My hubby is a pain to please but he loved this recipe. I followed recipe exactly except I added more seasoning to fit our taste(adobo instead of salt and pepper). Other than that I followed it and it was great and super fast. Anyone looking for a nice change to ground beef this is a great recipe.

I would agree that this is more like a small meatloaf, but it was really easy to make and tasted GREAT! When I went to grab something to drink, my boyfriend ate the rest of my second helping- and you can bet I was not very happy with him! I added some crispy onions in with mine and used spicy brown mustard instead of dried. I would also suggest just mixing in the topping, that way it soaks all the way through. Also, I did not need to cook it nearly as long as it calls for- more like 7 min a side.

This was just mushy individual meatloaves wrapped in bacon. I didn't care for it, but my husband loved it, hence 4 stars. I'll stick with my Glazed Meatloaf from this site, and add bacon strips to the top. I love meatloaf, but didn't enjoy this. I only ate it because I hate wasting food.

My family loved this.  I did use the pre-cooked bacon as suggested, and that worked really well.  Also, I think if you have trouble with the patties being "dry", you may be using ground beef that is too lean.  I used 80/20, and they were delicious!  Thanks for sharing

I followed this recipe exactly, but doubled it to have leftovers.  They came out perfectly and tasted delicious.  Three days later I reheated some in the microwave and they were just as tasty.  This is in my RECIPE BOX and I will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe! It was so quick and simple. I didn't add the mustard [i was out] and I added pepper to the ketchup/brown sugar sauce. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Yum!

I thought it was good...very easy.  Next time I would probably bake instead of broiling the filets.  Then the last five minutes put it under the broiler.  When I did it by the recipe it took 12 extra minutes to get done.

Very delicious, a little like meatloaf, but the bacon adds a great twist to it.  I microwaved the bacon for 2 minutes first before I wrapped it around the meat.  Also, instead of ketchup I used BBQ sauce.  Will definately make again.

This recipe is a good idea if you want to try something different.  I skipped the sauce because it sounded like it wouldn't go with the dish...but after eating it I realized it just wasn't right without it.  It tends toward the dry side, so the sauce, I am sure, moistens it a bit.  It was still tasty, though!  I liked it anyhow and will probably try it again with the sauce :)

My husband is a very picky individual, and he said that this was one of the best meals I've ever made.  I left out the dry mustard because I didn't have any, but it was moist and tasty.  I'm going to use the ketchup, brown sugar combo on my meatloaf.  Also very simple and quick.  Four thumbs up.

This recipes is very easy and even my picky children ate.  I was pleased except I would have to agree mine were a little dry also.  But I will make it again using worchestershire sauce.

We loved this recipe!!  My house smelled like a fancy steak.  I did not have normal bread crumbs so I crushed a box of stuffing mix.  Used about a cup per lb. of beef.  Instead of ketchup sauce I topped it with steak sauce.  A great recipe!!!!

It was not what I expected. It tasted more like dry, bland meatloaf, and I usually like meatloaf. We didnt really like it. I am not a picky eater, but would not make this again, UNLESS I made some major adjustments to it...to make it more moist and tasty.

My husband loved this and wants to have it atleast once a week! I did tweak it alittle bit, by omitting the onion and replacing it with chopped garlic, using italian bread crumbs, i added real mustard in addition to the dry, and i added cheese to the meat mixture as well as garlic powder and onion powder.  I prepared it earlier in the day and just popped it in the oven at dinner time. Will be making this again.

It was GREAT!
I use Italian Bread crumbs. I have made it so many times for my family. I don't even need to look at the recipe any longer. :)
 Once I was out of brown sugar. I substituted with honey. It was awesome.
My family loves it. It is a frequent request in our home. I make it like once a month.  
Serve it with mashed potatoes and green beans..
Or French fries.

I made these last night for dinner, and they turned out great. The bacon and sauce gave them a wonderful flavor.
