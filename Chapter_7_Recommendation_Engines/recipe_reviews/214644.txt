Great recipe - I soaked my corn in the sugar/salt water for a couple of hours.  I used all the sugar and 1/4 cup of salt.  I left the husks intact (peeling them back a little and removing a bit of excess silk) because that's how I grill them so the corn basically stems inside the husk.  I'm not sure if we had really good corn or if it was the soak, but my husband looked up at me and said he wished we'd grilled more corn.  So, we have a winner here and this will be how we soak our corn from now on.....

Everyone loves sweet corn, but these tasted more like all that sugar and took away from the natural sweetness that is so yummy. My family all felt the same way. Sorry. The only reason I can even give 2 stars is for the grilling. Grilled corn is the best, but I will go back to how I usually do it. I wrap the cleaned cobs in foil with a few small butter pats inside each. The only down side is that you cannot see how they are cooking and when they are done. If you get the right timing down with your grill, they are incredible, though.

This is how we do corn on the cob when in season here in FL. But never added sugar...guess we have sweet enough corn here and don't remove the husk or silk, it comes off easier when you pull back the hot husk and gives flavor. Slap on your butter and your good, have a corn dish as to catch all the butter and roll your corn in it. I do sprinkle a bit of salt...shame on me.

I was looking for a grill recipe for corn on the cob we had purchased at the store, as I was having a small party and wanted to grill anything I could (never waste charcoal!). This went over WAY too well; I cooked over twelve pieces and only got to eat one myself! The kids loved it, as did the parents (haha!). I definitly use this everytime I need to grill out now; I also use it as a boil on the stove when the weather turns bad, I just start the burner while it's soaking, and they tasted good that way too!

We live in the salad bowl of CA, so our corn is always naturally sweet, sometimes overly so depending on the region you buy it from.  I soaked it for 4 hours and this recipe didn't enhance or detract from the corn I was grilling...  Thank you for the submission Holly.  Always fun to experiment!

We don't have boiled corn ever anymore. This is so tasty! we probably grill it alittle more (ok it gets pretty dark :) I can see where it would be over sweet if it isn't grilled for a while but once it hits a certain doneness the flavors enhance the corn. Yum!

Fantastic! I only soaked the corn for an hour but the brine really did add flavor. Next time I will leave it in longer. Added Old Bay to the butter/salt/pepper and I HIGHLY recommend this, it gives the corn a subtle something extra. Took this to a group function and it was a hit with all of the teenagers and their families. Will definitely make again!

Unfortunately, this recipe made our corn way too sweet. It took away from the natural flavor of the corn. It wasn't any juicer than when I regularly grill corn.

I'm anxious to try this again to see if it really is that good or if I just had some really good corn??!! This totally surprised me - and I didn't grill them - I wrapped them in wax paper and microwaved them. They were great - and I will definitely do it again!

Perfect, easy way to make corn - and all loved it. At first, everyone thought you had to do SOMETHING else - certainly not put the corn directly on the barbie.  But -- this corn is delicious despite it's simplicity.

This was our first time grilling corn on the cob.  It won't be the last.  We've made this several times now and felt it was time for a review.  I filled the kitchen sink with cold water and even a few ice cubes.  I did add the salt, but only half the sugar amount because the corn in the summer is already nicely sweet.  We put it on the grill and let it cook for about 10 minutes and then turn it once, cook another 10 minutes it it is done.  Great way to have summer corn on the cob

Very good! You can also scale this down on salt and sugar and boil your corn on the stove. The grill always gives an extra flavor.

I didn't add sugar because the corn has been real sweet this year. after cooking in the husks we like to peel husks back and set the corn directly on the grill for some grill marks and it caramelizes it a bit. Yum!

I soaked the ears of corn 30 minutes, using Splenda rather than sugar, and then microwaved the corn following the recipe from "Microwave Corn on the Cob" on this site.  It was the best corn I have ever eaten - very juicy, slightly sweet, and tasty!  Will definitely make it this way from now on!

I love the sugar/salt soak.  My family and I have always left husk on in the soak and cook.  Seems to work best that way.  But anytime you grill corn it is a treat...

this did make for good corn on the cob, and it was our first attempt at grilled corn.  i'm not sure the soak did anything for the flavor, as it mostly tasted like anoy other corn i've ever had.  but i like dthe diea of grilling.  kept the kids corn inside the silk and husks because i knew they'd balk at the sign of grill marks.  it still turned out well, and was a nice way to be able to completely cook dinner outside without having to be back inside the kitchen for the boiling corn.  i will use the grilling technique in the future, but i think the salt/sugar soak is unnecessary.

Yummy! After rolling the cobs in butter, I sprinkled garlic salt and pepper on them before and after grilling them. Putting them on the grill gives them a chewy, nutty texture that my guest loved. Will definitely make these again!

I used fresh whole corn (in the husk).  Peeled the silk, etc. I cut the recipe in half for a qty. of 4 and submerged them in the cold sugar/salt water for 45 min. Threw them on the grill (did not wrap in foil)and brushed butter on all sides. Absolutely delicious! Never had better corn. A must now for every BBQ we have!

This worked really well. I love grilled corn but have always hated removing the silk and then rewrapping in husks. This is easy to work into a regular menu and, most of all, delicious.

I used the portions of salt and sugar the recipe called for.  I did increase the water to 1.5 gallons and soaked the corn for about two hours.  Grilled it on the BBQ and it was absolutely fantastic!  Thanks, Holly - it's a keeper

If you have a good corn, the sugar is not necessary.  And the salt is already in the butter and salt shaker.

The brine was fantastic.  I could not get my grill unlocked so I had to boil them.  They were so good I did not need butter or pepper.  Just straight from the brine.  Thanks.

this recipe was very simple and the corn was juicier than i expected. I had run out of butter but that was fine. The corn was juicy enough where the butter wasn't needed.

The only recipe deviation is that I cut it in half. Delicious! I'll be brining  corn as long as I'm grilling it.

I've made this recipe twice and the corn tastes the same whether you use 1/4 of the salt & sugar or the entire recipe.  Soaking for at least a 1/2 hour and then put it on the grill!

i omitted the sugar, i used sweet corn, and it came out fine.  i don't know if the taste was any better or worse than i normally make though.  the saltwater bath certainly kept the corn moist and juicy so that was a definite plus.

I will boil the corn for about 10 minutes and then move to grill as so not to have to grill it as long. I'll place each ear on the grill and then spread butter on each ear but instead of white sugar as in the boil recipe I use cinnamon powder or sugar. I'll turn after a couple of minutes and repeat with the butter and cinnamon. The cinnamon sugar is great and gives it a great taste! Try it you'll love it!

It was fun to try something different. I made the recipe as instructed. Some of the corn got charred, but that's just our grill. The parts that weren't overheated tasted good, and this is a good option for when I don't want to fill the kitchen with steam. I wouldn't say it's the best corn ever, but the grilling did add a different flavor.

We soaked and grilled the corn with the husks on. Substituted honey for the sugar.  The brine kind of wiped out the actual flavor of the corn and I think changed the texture, making it more mealy.  It was ok; thought we'd try it since we already had the grill going and it was beastly hot. Our favorite way to make corn is still to steam it on the stovetop.

Made this for a Memorial Day bbq and it was awesome.  Soaked it for 2 hours and then grilled it.  Very tasty.

I got corn from my local farmers market and made this for our Father's Day picnic!  Juiciest most flavorful corn on the cob I've ever had.  This recipe will go in my most often made folder!

Sorry.  I did not care for this recipe.  My corn was mushy and burnt.  Unfortunately I had guests over who tried to eat it.  Even tho they tried to be polite it was too much for them to take.  I wish I had left it in the husks.

I liked this but my husband said the corn was too sweet.  It was our first time grilling corn and it turned out well.  Next time I'll use much less sugar

this was the sweetest corn I've ever had and my family absolutely loved it!  I made it one time and didn't save the recipe and searched and searched this site until I found it again lol!
