This cheesecake is surprisingly light and was a big hit at our family thanksgiving dinner.

I had to cook this recipe about 40 minutes longer than directed and it was still very soft  too moist.

Everyone at work really liked this, but I felt it was ho-hum. I think the crust may be better if the almonds and almond meal were toasted first? The pumpkin spice flavor is very, very mild, so it's probably a good option for folks who want to go lighter on the pumpkin pie flavor. I may give it another go.

This was really great - I used the last pumpkin from my garden from last fall.  I needed to bake it about  1/2 hour longer. But well worth the wait.

It was delicious! I had pecans in my pantry so I used those instead of almonds and it was still yummy. I ended up baking it for 30 extra minutes because it wouldn't break in the center like the directions say. But it was still moist and delicious!

I would not try this recipe again.  Perhaps it is the large amount of sour cream it calls for, but my family found it quite disappointing.

I went gluten and used a standard graham cracker crust.  It was light and delicious, although it did crack in the top even though I had a pan of water in the oven like it said.

Very creamy with just the right amount of pumpkin flavor, not overpowering. I used a coffee grinder and whole almonds to make the almond meal.  My company loved this dessert!

Very Disappointed I did not taste the filling before I put the eggs in like I generally do so I can adjust the taste. I made 2 ramekins to see what it would taste like in addition to the cheesecake and it tasted like sour cream cheesecake to me Not Pumpkin. I guess I will make a pumpkin pie to this was supposed to make my thanksgiving easier by making dessert the day before, I guess that did not happen.

I agree with others that it took longer to bake than it said.  I kept adding 15 minutes at a time but it was in the oven more like 2 hours.  I finally turn the oven off and left it for a bit.  I added a tsp. of pumpkin spice was the only change I made.

Just a recipe I was looking for!
I replaced almond meal with hazelnut meal, and it worked fine. Also, I used 8 oz of mascarpone cheese instead of one package of cream cheese, and less sour cream. Organic baked pumpkin instead of canned was a good decision  The cake came out fluffy and tender tasting. I love it!

I've made this 3X between Thanksgiving & Christmas and it was great.  I made a simple GF pretzel crust with ground pretzels and the butter.  Loved the slight saltiness of the pretzels.  This will be my GO To holiday dessert.

Sadly, this did not work for me at all.  I made it for Thanksgiving and ended up throwing it in the compost bin.  I had to cook it for two hours, the cream cheese never blended so it was lumpy, the texture was weird, and it didn't have much of a pumpkin flavor.  The crust was good and I would use the crust on a different, more reliable cheesecake recipe.  When I cooked it, it puffed up on the edges but was still very jiggly in the middle.  I was very disappointed.

Made this for my gluten free mom for Thanksgiving and it was really good. I bought gluten free graham crackers to make the crust, went heavier on cinnamon and added nutmeg and vanilla. I made the adjustments after the first one. I really enjoyed the second one.

I loved this recipe!  I made it for a dessert group gathering which has a member who has gluten sensitivity and also made another dessert for others in the group.  This one was by far the more popular choice for everyone!  It looks huge when it comes out of the oven, but it condenses as it cools.  Made 8 medium servings.
