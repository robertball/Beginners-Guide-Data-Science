I went about this a little differently.  Rather than mixing the chicken with the soy sauce/broth mixture I reserved it until the end.  I quickly stir-fried the thinly sliced chicken (easy to thin-slice if you partially freeze it first), then the vegetables. (Leaving on a jet plane day after tomorrow and this was the perfect recipe to clear out the fridge: broccoli, zucchini, onions, mushrooms, baby bok choy, red bell pepper and bean sprouts). I mixed it all together then and thickened it with the broth mixture, heating just until thickened.  Additional cooking at this point is not required. We enjoyed this, tho' Hubs liked it more than I did. Purely subjective, but given the stronger tasting broccoli and bell pepper, I think beef would have been a better choice over the mildly flavored chicken.  Again, just a matter of different taste buds! Most important with stir fries, where the ingredients are cooked quickly over high heat, all ingredients should be of similar size and thickness so that they all cook quickly and evenly at roughly the same rate.

This recipe is wonderful! I used broccoli, onion, zucchini, green pepper and carrots. Whatever you do, don't forget to top it with fresh green onions and also I added toasted sesame seeds. Those additions just set it over the top!  I served it over brown rice cooked with broth (or bouillon would work great too! ). I also let the chicken pieces soak for quite a while in the delicious sauce and I pierced the pieces with a fork so they were so tender and flavorful. This is a wonderful recipe!

Loved this recipe. Just added carrots, mushrooms, celery, onions, and a red and yellow pepper instead of zucchini, and doubled the recipe. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and replaced the sherry with 2 tsps Of vanilla, 1 tbsp of Apple cider vinegar, and 1tbsp of water.

I gave this recipe a 5 star not because it is the best tasting but because it is good basic starting recipe that can be altered with spices, vegetables, meats and other ingredient.  I have lived in China and the vegetables will vary from season to seasoned also region to region.  Also with he spices.  I lived with one of my students and his mom cooked some of the best meals I had while over there.  Those new table cook tops that don't get hot until you place a steal pot on it are very popular there and many meals were cooked right there on the kitchen table in a wow.  Oh, don'd cook over medium heat, only high heat.  Oh, she did not add all vegetables at the same time, snow peas tool longer to cook than zuccini squash, so the longer cooking items went in first and the quicker cooking items last.

Experiment, use Nuoc nam cause from Vietnam, beef broth.

Anyway, have fun with it and don't get in a rut with using the same recipe over and over and not trying other things/

The recipe is great.  Just for ducks and to impart a little more flavor I used Sesame Oil instead of Vegetable.  I also threw in some mushrooms.  All in all delicious and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

Felt it lacked spice or distinctive flavor.  Had to add Sriracha to it and plentifully at that.

This recipe is perfect!  We didn't have some of the veggies listed so I improvised with what I had.  I coarsely chopped 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 2 carrots, and 1 onion.  I saut√©ed all veggies as indicated.  Removed veggies then added the marinated chicken, cooked through then added veggies back in to toss in the sauce.

This was really good.  It was easy to make and you can add any veggies you want and make it your own.  I didn't have green peppers so I used mushrooms, broccoli can of La Choy stir fry vegetables I had buried in the cabinet.  It was perfect.  My boys loved it.  Don't need any extra seasoning.  Flavored perfectly.

This was a good recipe. I added tons of veggies including: broccoli, mushrooms, a red bell pepper, a green bell pepper, and asparagus. I also added Hosien sauce to the chicken mixture. I finished it off with noodles. This recipe was really filling for myself and others. I might try adding less veggies next time.

Needed a little more flavor and spice. I used green bell peppers, broccoli, sliced carrots, spinach, green onions, ginger, and celery. Next time I will also add water chestnuts. I added crushed red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper for    spice. It's a good recipe to start with and customize.

This is a great guideline to "build your own" stir fry. I added a ton more vegetables and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (just preference). I cooked the chicken a little longer than the recipe states as well. I didn't have any broccoli or zucchini on hand so I had to use what I had and it turned out great. I served it over a bed of rice cooked with chicken broth instead of just water. I'll definitely make it again.

Simple and scrumptious! I tried this recipe despite some misgivings that it might be bland; nonetheless I stuck to the recipe save for adding mushrooms. To my surprise, it has a delicious savory flavor without any other additions, not even salt or pepper. Also realized at the last minute I was out of rice so served it over linguini. My lone regret is that the noodles weren't able to soak up more of the sauce.

Love to make this during zucchini season.  The only difference is I use a red pepper, just to add a little color.  Otherwise, I follow this recipe exactly and it is a very popular way to use extra zucchini and makes  a great dinner!

This a good recipe and I've made it many times with varying the vegetable. I reserved the sauce until the end and use sesame oil to cook the chicken.

Very quick and easy, we enjoyed it but thought it could've used a little more flavor.  I only used one clove of garlic, worried I would over do it, next time i will try using the recommended amount.  Definitely worth a second try.

Tend to agree with ruzmoore.
Lots of yummy veggies with the chicken, but it needed something more...

I used pre-cooked chicken and left out the broth. Used a bag of stir-fry veggies. It was much better than I was expecting.

Not bad for minimal ingredients in the sauce. I think I would just make up my own recipe, with more flavor, but this isn't bad if you need to follow a recipe.

I used the veggies I had on hand - broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and asparagus. I used sesame oil for extra flavor and because it does well on high heat. It turned out great! I would have loved more sauce because the sauce was killer!

Loved this recipe!  I had Googled stir fry chicken and vegetables recipe and I think this was the first return.  I probably shouldn‚Äôt even go through all the changes I made, but they were necessary.  I realized what I pulled out of the freezer was pork, not chicken.  I didn‚Äôt have any sherry, so I used Marsala wine.  I added sriracha to the marinade.  I don‚Äôt really measure things, but I would say it was a few Tablespoons.  I didn‚Äôt have any green onions, but.added white onion to the veggie mixture.  I needed a quick dinner with the meat and veggies that I had on-hand, and this was it!  I love it and will definitely make it again.

Great stuff. Used carrot and cabbage as the main vegetable.  Light soy sauce and Oyster sauce, green and red pepper. Ginger only, no garlic. Taste still came out amazing.

This was a great basic recipe! I took some hints from another recipe and marinaded the chicken in Soy, brown sugar, Red Pepper flakes & corn starch for an hour! I added mushrooms, red peppper (I prefer) & carrots. I used sesame seed oil for all saut√©! Made a little more sauce with chicken broth, soy & cornstarch & hubby raved about the flavor!

I made this without the dry sherry because I did not have any in the cupboard.. It tasted fine without it.  The only difference other than less the dry sherry was I did was added more traditional Chinese vegetables in it.  Great job to the chef who originated this recipe.

While it is loaded with veggies we found the chicken to have a consistency of rubber and overall not much taste.  After 30+ years of cooking it‚Äôs highly unlikely I‚Äôd make it again unless someone can offer useful suggestions on improving the recipe.

Found the sauce bland. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I didn‚Äôt have wine, so I used vanilla and cider vinegar as suggested by another reviewer and added hoisin sauce trying to add flavor, but still blah.

I liked this dish but hubby felt it lacked flavor. I did have to add some soy sauce to my serving to add flavor too. It is good, but I have other stir fry dinners that hubby likes  much more so I will not include this in the rotation.

I have made this twice now, the second time was much better. I left out the dry cherry and bell peppers. I used a frozen Broccoli stir fry veggie bag and added zucchini and extra broccoli. I also doubled the recipe. My 9yr old loved it. A favorite meal in our family.

I used a frozen package of stir fry veggies with soy seasoning. That along with the seasoning on the chicken breast gave this dish plenty of flavor. Using the frozen prepackaged stir fry also made this dish super quick and easy to make. I will definitely make this again and for my husband and I we both took heaping servings and still had some leftover.

No flavor at all. I threw every other seasoning in my cabinet on it to try and salvage it, but blah. I don't know what happened to the chicken. Followed directions as given, but when I went to fry...it turned all gooey. Yuck!

The stir fry Chinese chicken was quick, easy and delicious!  The steaming of the chicken made the pieces very tender.  I did not use the zucchini  but the other vegetables worked great.  I also added a little hot sauce to spice it up just a little more.

DELICIOUS

I quite liked this recipe. Turns out I didn't have the cornstarch, so improvised using Bisto gravy mix instead. And it still turned out very tasty. I'm sure to make this again.

I loved this recipe! I of course altered it some. Made a marinade for chicken and sauce...brown sugar, ginger, garlic, hoisin, soy sauce and chicken broth to this it out a little. I marinated chicken then tossed in corn starch. Pan fried till brown both sides took out added a little more EVOO then brown broccoli..took that out and added zucchini, peppers, onions and garlic. Browned then took them out and added the other marinade I made to pan brought to a small boil! Then added chicken and veggies back and simmered the cornstarch that was on chicken helped to thicken the sauce. Boiled chicken broth and half pack of sazon for rice and made brown rice..it was yummy family loved it!

Very good base recipe.  I added a tsp of oyster sauce to marinade.  Used about 20 snow peas, 1/2 small red pepper sliced thin. 1/4 Vidalia onion cut into bite size pieces, one bag of bean sprouts (about a pound), added 1 tsp of sesame oil to oil for cooking vegetables.  Followed the method as described.  I was a little concerned about how the chicken mixture was cooking, but when the vegetables were added, the chicken mixture thinned out.  I highly recommend not cutting the sherry, as this adds the necessary sweetness to the dish.

This was wonderful and very tasty. I served over white rice. I loved Hilda's tip with the alternative to using Sherry. I doubled the recipe and used what vegetables I had in my refrigerator:  yellow and green bell pepper, yellow squash, and broccoli. Yummy!!

It was OK - a bit fiddly and also a  little salty but low salt soy sauce would have fixed that.  I also added mushrooms and had red capsicum and put noodles in it.  Would probably add a bit more liquid to it too.  I might make it again.

I made it exactly as stated and it was great!! For those who think it lacks flavor I disagree- it's not a strong flavor and def not spicy, but then there isn't anything spicy in it. It sort of reminds me of mall Chinese food. You might want extra salt, but I didn't add any due to the soy and chicken broth and thought it was fine. My toddler also really like it!

This recipe is so good it'll make her f*** on the first date. Just whip this up, light some candles, and set the table. It's 'bout to be a wild night filled with savory flavors.

Hubby really liked this and asked for it again. I re-calculated the ingredients around 1-1/2 pounds of chicken and it was quite saucy so I'll reduce that a bit next time.

We loved this and it was a last minute decision with stuff we had in the house. I added a clove of crushed garlic, 1/4 t ground ginger and substituted the sherry with rice wine vinegar for the chicken marinade. I used broccoli, red and green peppers and onion as the veggies and saut√©ed the veggies in sesame oil & vegetable oil.  I added toasted sesame seeds as a topping at the end.  Delicious and will definitely make again.

I used frozen veggies. Chopped red onions a dash of garlic powder,curry and pepper corns. I used mushrooms which I added at the end and steamed. I didn't use chicken broth just little water. I was surprised how easy it was to make. Loved it. I will make it over and over again. Thanks.

Simply wonderful. I used zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, snow peas, and bean sprouts as the veges and kept the garlic cloves instead of adding in minced. I had thought to use fresh basil  leaves instead of green onions at the finish and am glad I didn't as it was so flavorful on its own! I will definitely be making this again. Its a great starter recipe for you to add your own twist on the veges and spices!

Tried this today   4 stars,  as I did make a couple of changes.  I used sesame oil, and ended up doubling the chicken broth (we like sauce). It was very good!   Next time I will add broccoli after a few minutes cooking the other vegetables, as suggested in previous reviews, as the broccoli was a little overdone.   This is a great basic recipe, particularly for two people!  May add just a smidgen of siracha  next time!

This recipe is perfect! We like to stir-fry vegetables & chicken once in a while and I couldn't remember the proportions for the sauce. The recipe is quick and easy if you have frozen vegetables on hand.  I added phad thai noodles.  Some ginger would also be good.

It was just that...okay. Being one who is accustomed to wok cooking, I found the directions (order and method) to be unAsian. If you're looking for something more authentic, I would search for another recipe.

Cooked chicken in oil over medium high with soy sauce. Added vegetables, garlic, chicken broth. Sprinkled seasoned salt. Didn't measure anything. More vegetables.  Luke loved red peppers and zucchini. Served over Brian rice. No extra soy sauce needed.
