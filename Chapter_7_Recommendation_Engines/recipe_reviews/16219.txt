This was really good.  I had to make a few modifications.  Used chicken tenders and sauteed the onions.  I layerd first the sauteed eggplant, then place the lightly sauteed chicken tenders on top.  Mixed the onions with a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes and spices and added some chicken stock.  Topped the eggplant and chicken with the tomato mixture.  Refrigerated for a few hours, then baked (convection) at 375 for about 45 minutes.  Served over rice with a green salad of romaine, chick peas, cucumbers and artichoke hearts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Really delicious and easy to prepare. I had to make a few changes...I didn't have fresh tomatoes or dill, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes & about 1 tsp of dried chopped dill. I hadn't used tumeric before so I just sprinkled on a 1/2 tsp. The dried dill was a little "faint" but everything else worked out well! I'll use fresh dill next time or more dried..

I give this recipe a 4 because after cooking it 30 minutes with foil I opened the oven to remove foil and it looked very dry. I then mixed up one cup of water and a bullion cube and poured it on top. This helped moisten the turmeric that was on top as well as make a sauce. I then cooked uncovered for 15 more minutes and found it to be pretty good. The chicken broth flavored nicely with the spices and made a good topping for the rice. I will make again. My 2 and 4 year old did eat it all up.

Good but not perfect. Something misses that will make the taste even better. Also, next time I might substitute dill for oregano, or for basil, as dill was not very complementary to the eggplant/tomato.

I made this hoping to use up my surplus of fresh dill, and was encouraged by the good reviews.  But, this definitely didn't work for me.  I actually couldn't finish it.  The combination of dill and turmeric tasted really gross.  Considering the positive reviews posted for this recipe, maybe I did something wrong, or maybe I have weird taste buds or something.  So, take my review with the proverbial grain of salt :).

My husband and I did not care for this recipe. I couldnt find Tumeric so I left it out, it wasnt called for in a giant amount so I thought it would be ok. I have never used turmeric so I dont know if it could have helped anyway. The dill and the tomatoes fused to make a very odd flavor. It was just "weird" I won't make this again.

This was amazing.  I used chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken.  Really easy and really delicious.

Very good, but I'll cut back on the amount of turmeric I use next time.  Was a little overpowering for me.

Delicious!  I used dried dill, and instead of just putting the dill & turmeric on top, I sprinkled them on each layer.  The only thing is next time I will not cook the eggplant first becuase it was WAY too soft.  this is the best chicken dish I've had in a LONG time!

Changed it to fit my ingredients = excellent! no nutmeg, used baharat - Israeli name for a medley of Middle Eastern spices - and black pepper directly on chicken before sauteing.  Sauted onions. Fresh tomatoes too expensive now - 1 small can tomato sauce and 1 harisa paste. Surprised at how dill enhanced the recipe so well.

I think this recipe would have been good if i liked ground turmeric. I only used 1 tablespoon of the ground turmeric and i used quite a bit of salt to help with taste. over all it was a alright dish.

It was a tasty dish but because the spices were on top, they stayed dry which was odd. I would mix the spices in next time.

My husband and I did not enjoy this recipe.  The mix of flavors was odd and the overall taste was bland.  Sorry, but we won't be making this one again.

Not bad but could have used more dill. It kind of got lost in the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made a couple of changes- the best was to serve with crumbled feta cheese, it was a great addition.  As others have said, I used about half the tumeric. Boneless chicken breasts were on sale, so I sliced strips.
We will have this again
