i thought this was delicious. the tang from the yogurt was tasty. For me, this was a little saucy so next time i'll cut back on the yogurt a bit. i did add more chicken to this..

I found this recipe using an ingredient search to use up the stuff in the fridge. I used red, green, and white onion. One five ounce Greek yogurt and eight ounces of regular cream cheese. 4 chicken thighs for the meat. I followed the cooking directions to the letter. It was perfect. It was easy. It was yummy and tangy. I didn't even add the pepper I usually add to white sauces. This may become my favorite chicken recipe! I served it over rice pilaf and that worked well for us.  Edited to add:
I've made this a number of times now and have settled in to making it the same way each time.  I use half the yogurt and twice the cream cheese. I now add half a yellow pepper. We prefer it served over rice.

I doubled the ingredients as my family are big eaters and served it with fresh grilled asparagus, carrots, sweet peppers and tomatoes. I put a half cup of Feta cheese on top of the grilled veggies with a dash of Himalayan salt.

I made this per the recipe although I did add more chicken. Very tasty made with fat free Greek yogurt and Neufchatel to lighten it up a bit. I added some smoked paprika on top and garlic powder when I warmed up leftovers that enhanced it even more.

I can't say i loved it, but is not that bad. I altered by adding pitch of salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic. It has sort of flavor that i can't describe it. Still not so bad.

I made this on Friday and it was very good. The recipe was easy but I did need to add spices to the recipe.Salt, pepper, little onion and garlic salt, and some paprika to notch up the test. I was greatly surprised at how creamy it was. I added ground beef instead of chicken.

This was amazing! I added extra spices (paprika, salt, pepper, onion powder, & garlic powder) and a few garlic cloves. I also only used 1 cup of Greek yogurt. I will make this again for sure.

Very disappointed and bland.  It needed something more in the seasoning.  Also too soupy.  I think it needed less yogurt.  When I added the cream cheese, the sauce curdled- so it looked very unappetizing.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. we loved how it used Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream or heavy cream. You can't even tell the difference and it still has the zing like sour cream. The only change we made was added a clove of fresh garlic, everything else we made exactly per the recipe.  This will be added to our meal rotation.

This was so good! I will definitely make again! I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the crockpot until done. I made one change to the recipe-I only used one container of Greek yogurt (5.5 ounces). I served over egg noodles! 5 stars!!

Pretty easy, taste great and simple to make. I server green beans with  almond slivers on the side and finished those off in butter and cream cheese, it was out on the counter so I used it and it was tasty.

We thought this was excellent. We did, however, modify to our taste by adding 3 cloves of minced garlic after the onions and mushrooms had just begun to caramelize. We also, as another reviewer suggested, added smoked paprika and adjusted the sauce after thickening with additions of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.  Great, healthy, base sauce that you can really work with to suit your tastes. Thank you!

Like some others, I upped the amount of chicken. I also decreased the amount of yogurt by 1/2, so only one cup. It was delicious! I think I might even up the amount of mushrooms next time. My husband and I both loved this and will definitely make this again. Really yummy!

Yet another great base recipe. It was a little bland but with a little extra spice of your choice this becomes excellent. I like spicy so I added some cayenne, my wife added some chives and other more fragrant spices. Next time I will add less onion and add some peppers. Great starting recipe

I combined this recipe with another Stroganoff recipe and used ground chicken instead.  Mainly cause I didn't have any Greek Yogurt. This was my first time making Stroganoff and had a craving for some.   It came out delicious and I will be making it again.

This was easy and fun to make. I had my own chicken broth and chicken. I used crimini (brown) mushrooms and added a green pepper, which was great. Everything was delicious and SO flavorful, til I began adding the yogurt and cream cheese, at which time the flavors from the sautéed ingredients just disappeared. I only used one cup of yogurt and half the cream cheese. It was very creamy and saucy. Everyone liked it. But I still have to work on balancing the flavors so those delicious mushrooms and green peppers stand out more.

I thought this needed garlic & other seasonings. Will not make again.

I added two cloves of garlic, garlic salt, ground pepper and more mushrooms. We found it lackluster.

I feel it was missing more of the mushroom base.

My husband thinks it's great.  And we have leftovers.  I did add some course ground pepper at the finish.  Also used extra mushrooms because I love them.
