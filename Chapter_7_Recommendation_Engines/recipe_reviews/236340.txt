My family did not care for this recipe. We found that the cup of Greek yogurt was a bit much.

This is really tasty,  something delicious in every bite.  I don't care for greek yogurt but I used it the first two times, this time I'll substitute with sour cream and decrease the amt (as suggested by all the others) to 1/2 cup.  I don't see how you could mess this up.  Thanks for the recipe!

An explosion of great flavors!  Although this recipe involves a lot of prep work, it is still pretty easy to make.  Like other reviewers, I would suggest using less greek yogurt - perhaps 1/2 - 3/4 cup.

Great recipe, very simple and VERY quick. I did not include the almonds or grapes, I also subbed sour cream for the Greek yogurt.

Due to what I had on hand I added more rice and less yogurt so it came out a little dry but very tasty.  I will make this again but with better proportions.

Liked it!  We used a locally made Mediterranean sausage [bulk] which has a hint of fennel in it.  I doubled the apricots, only used 1/2 cup greek yogurt. I will leave the grapes out next time, mushy when they get hot.  The sage and fresh basil were really good in this.  My husband has already claimed the leftovers to take for his lunch tomorrow!  Forgot to add the almonds, oops. 
Still good and really different.  Roasted carrots, beets and zucchini in the oven with olive oil sea salt and coarse pepper to go with it.
