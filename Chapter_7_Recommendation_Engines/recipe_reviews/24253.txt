Maybe you need to have walnut oil--I just used canola.  I though the recipe lacked pizazz and won't make it again.

This was very easy to make with pre-cooked chicken and is a nice change from standard chicken salad.  I took it to a pot luck and was asked for the recipe by the hostess as well as several of the guests.  The water chestnuts added a nice crunch; don't leave them out.  I tried it once without them and it was a little mushy.  Be careful of the salt if using roasted chicken from a deli or market.

I had cooked wild rice leftover that I wanted to use up, so I tried this recipe.  I was afraid that my very picky husband wouldn't like it, but we both loved it!  However, we did think it could use more chicken.  It's delicious, though, and definitely going on my list of favourites!

I was so excited to try this since the ingredients look marvelous and I'm always looking for wheat & dairy-free recipes.  I found it bland until I got up in the middle of dinner and added chopped orange segments to it.  Next time I will try it with some orange juice mixed into the vinegar/oil.  We also ate it over chopped romaine for a full salad effect. I will definitly make this recipe again, but with changes to add flavor.  Perfect for left over rotisserie chicken. Thanks for the inspiration!

Excellent for a summer salad. I used canned, cooked wild rice, which helped cut the prep. time down. I also used a homemade vinegarette.  We will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for sharing!

I used heirloom red rice in place of the wild rice, because that is what I had.  If you haven't tried red rice, do it!  It is Fat Tuesday, so I seasoned the chicken with cajun spice.  Also, I used extra virgin olive oil in place of the walnut oil.  Quite yummy and healthy.

I thought this was a very nice lunch, and I will make this again.  I used Trader Joe's Just Chicken so I could use as much as I wanted to add.  I am thinking that the walnut olive oil would have been nice, but since I didn't have that I used a combo of lemon olive oil and avocado oil.  It was the first time in a very long time I'd used water chestnuts, and I'm glad I did because they were very good in this.  I would like a little something with citrus added to this and it would be perfect.  Maybe Trader's Orange Muscat vinegar would work.  I'll be trying this one again!  Thanks, Kimber!

I used olive oil instead of walnut oil and butter. I wish I would have doubled the water chestnuts, they were so good. My 8 yr old didn't like them though. I ate mine on top of spinach but my husband and daughter didn't. It was good on spinach but it would have been delicious without. I like adding healthy veggies when I can though. I used pre-cooked chicken. This was good both warm and room temperature.
