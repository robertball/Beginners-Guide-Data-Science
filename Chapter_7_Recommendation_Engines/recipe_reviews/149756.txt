Excellent.  This recipe is incredible. It's hard to find lemon preserve, so you can always make your own like I did! Mmm!

I could not find a rack of lamb so I used some lamb chops and adapted this recipe for pan frying.  Was looking for ways to utilize the Preserved Lemons I've made.  This is an excellent way!  The lemon and garlic truly accent the lamb and gave it a very exotic flavor.  Even hubby, who is not always crazy about lamb, thought it was bone-sucking good!  I'm going to try it with a venison backstrap as well...since a deer is little more than a suped up sheep.  Great idea!!!
