This was a great tasting holiday pie.  A nice twist to the ever popular pumpkin pie.

I used to make this recipe back in the 80's and I am so happy to see it again. It is the perfect blend of a lot of pumpkin and touch of old fashioned mincemeat. Start a new tradition and make the mincemeat out of your green tomtoes. My kids love mincemeat day.  I spiced the pumpkin with 1/2 teas. ginger and 1/teas. allspice.

This is a good idea in theory.  However we found that the mincemeat overpowered the pumpkin so much that it might as well not been there.  I would like to try it again using half the mincemeat and doubling the pumpkin.

This is a great pie that my mother made all the time - she would put apple pie filling in the mincemeat to cut the tartness and it made it more fantastic!
