The reduction is a keeper, for sure. Personal taste, but I think I'm going to try it again without cubing the tenderloin.

This is easily one of the best dishes I have ever made.  It is a costly recipe if you do something wrong or burn something, so novices beware.  It is very important that you remove the beef from heat when it is rare/medium-rare as it will continue to cook off the stove.  Do not server tenderlion more cooked than medium-rare.

I use Portabella mushrooms and brown sugar instead of Shitake and raspberry jam.  It is still outstanding. I also use a very nice port, Graham's 10 year,tawny porto.  This recipe has easily moved into my top ten.  I have so much fun preparing this dish in anticipation of serving it to friends and enjoying it myself.  Thank you 'All Recipes'.

Delicious! I was worried about it being a little too sweet but it turned out pretty amazing.
I made it for an early Valentine's Day dinner and it was a great choice for the occasion. 
I didn't cube the meat because I wanted the cuts whole, so I seared the tenderloins an cooked them in the oven at 500 degrees for 4 minutes and let them sit on the pan will a foil tent for a few minutes before placing them in the skillet with the reduction sauce at a medium low heat for 4 more minutes on each side which got them to a perfect medium-rare.
The sauce did reduce a bit faster than 30 minutes so this is definitely a recipe you have to watch closely.
Little bit of modifications but it was a big hit for me and my husband.

I am rating this one for my hubby.  He loved it.  I am not a big fan of port wine but I made this more for him as he is.  The sauce was too sweet for me (port is sweet) but the taste of the meat was wonderful and tender.  I was told this is now his favorite recipe!  I left the mushrooms whole as this was his preference otherwise followed directions to a "T".  My youngest son also rated a 5.  Thanks

This recipe is one to keep for another try.  I must say that it turned out very well and rich.  It is not my favorite way to prepare tenderloin, but I will try it with chicken next time.  If you are looking to prepare this along with the suggested side-dishes from the recipe's author, be careful.  There is indeed a lot of sweetness to this dish as well as the others.  My rating is based on the dish as a stand-alone.  Texture and flavor were great--enjoyment of preparation also gets five stars.  Nicely done jonnyd523.  Thanks.

FYI, the wine store recommended using ruby port, instead of a white or tawny port.

This really is a good recipe, I've made it several times now and It's now on a regular rotation at the house. I've substituted stew meat instead of tenderloin in the past and it has come out just fine. It's the flavor that really works for this.

This is a very good recipe, but it would be better to have more vegitables, or a bed of rice to complete the meal. For the initial cooking of the meat, I would recommend grilling slightly below desired doneness, as the re-heating at the end does make it a bit darker.

Hats off to the person that created this but it didn't flip my switch! There was nothing wrong it, it just wasn't what I expected. I make everything  we eat from scratch and we like a lot of flavor in our food, this just didn't have as much "zing" as I thought it might, I think the sauce would be a great companion for venison though. It is an expensive meal to make if you are not pleased with the result and is definatly NOT for a novice cook. I decided to make this baised on the other reviews and was sadly dissappointed. Over all I would not rush to make this again.

Fantastic!! And very easy!  I used a pork tenderloin instead of beef- which was a delicious substitute.   We will most certainly be making this again!

This recipe was AMAZING. I used whole tenderloin steaks (2 steaks of about 6 oz each) instead of cubing the meat, but left all other quantities the same except I reduced the port from 2 cups to 1.5 cups. I used a ruby port (LBV), and had the rest of the bottle with dessert!  I also used regular white mushrooms instead of shiitake.  I found the flavor and texture of this sauce exceptional. By reducing the quantity of the port, it reduced the amount of time needed for the reduction (took about 15 minutes).

We didn't even have the right amount of port and this turned out awesome!! I'm not a huge mushroom fan and the shiitake really added a nice texture and soaked in the yummy sauce.  I'm also not a big meat eater but I couldn't get enough! My husband was also very impressed. We will definitely make this again. We didn't cook the reduction for the full 30 minutes as we had less port than called for and it seemed to reduce really fast.

This was great! One reccomendation is to shorten the reduction time and stir throughout, the first time I attempted this I filled the apartment with smoke but it smelled so good before it burnt that I tried again... and was glad I did.

Terrific, well-balanced flavor, and it looks beautiful. Drizzled extra sauce over mashed potatoes. Bought all the ingredients at Pike Place Market and served this for two couples for Valentine's Day dinner to great acclaim. House still smells good the next day! One tip -- when I went to buy the tenderloin, I told the butcher I was cutting it into cubes and he sold me the tail of the tenderloin for $10/lb. instead of the $28/lb. it was going to cost for steaks. This is at Don and Joe's Meat in the Market...maybe other butchers would do it too?

This was really outstanding! The raspberry preserves give it a little something extra. We used skirt steak instead of filet mignon - I'm sure the filet would have made it even better, but the skirt steak was very serviceable and brought the price down. We also found that it took far less than 30 minutes to reduce. For our group of four, it was plenty of food along with a vegetable and a salad. We will make this again soon!

I made this recipe on Valentines Day and my husband loved it.
However, the recipe called for boiling the wine, jam, Worcestershire sauce ,  and mushrooms on high heat. We realized that you have to lower the temperature to medium heat or the beef tenderloin in Port Shitake Reduction will cook too quickly. Other than that everything came out well. This is one of my favorites.

I made it to recipe - only substituting apple jelly as I had no raspberry. I was a little short on mushrooms and Port but the results were still very impressive. Served with mashed buttercup squash and boiled baby potatoes. Will certainly make again.

I made this years ago and obsessed over it for a long time. I didn’t have wine at the time so I used a mixture of white and red cooking wine. I used canned button mushrooms and wow wow wow! This was sooooo amazing! I fed some to my uncle and he was so impressed! A definite crowd pleaser! (but I wouldn’t share it.... keep it for yourself as a treat!)

This recipe is amazing! Port wine is too sweet for us, so I substituted a table cabernet sauvignon. Everything else was per the recipe. It was amazing. I agree with the other reviews to be careful not to cook the tenderloin too long. This is one of our family's favorites!
TIP: Check your grocery store for tenderloin tips. same meat, lower price and you are going to cut it up anyway! Enjoy!

I am guessing I did something wrong because the port reduction was horrid.  The port and rasberry sauce made it way to sweet and I could never figure out how to fix it.  Also, someone suggested doubling it for 4 people.  That was way too much meat for 4 people.  Would not make again.

This is a great recipe.  I used sherry and port wine. Even used canned mushrooms.  This is a keeper.
