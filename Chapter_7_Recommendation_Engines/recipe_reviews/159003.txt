I made some modifications to the recipe to make it both healthier, and give it a little more kick.
I used low-fat Hebrew National hot dogs, Emeril's NY Deli Mustard (found at a local discount grocery, actually!), and low-sugar Heinz Ketchup.  The coating was a mixture of almond meal which is very low carb and a few crushed saltine crackers.  I added some Parmesan cheese as well.
I was really surprised at how good it came out.  There was absolutely no mess, maybe because I used a fat-free cooking spray to coat the tinfoil on the cooking tray.  I served the hot dogs with steamed snow peas & carrots, and some fresh celery sticks.  I will definitely make this again, and plan to adapt the recipe so I can make it with my students during our nutrition unit!

I have made these twice. The first time I used a mixture of crushed yellow tortilla chips and panko bread crumbs since I was out of corn flakes. The second time I made them with the corn flakes. My daughter actually liked them better the first time and so did my husband and I; they were crunchier with the chips/bread crumbs. I think using panko crumbs really helped. These are really good a nice change from a plain old hot dog. Don't even really need a bun for these!

My 2 kids hated these - picked all the coating off of the hot dogs. My husband and I thought they were OK but I won't be making them again.

I loved the recipe and the idea of a crunchy hot dog. However I ended up using pre-cooked chedderwursts and I also used parmisan with the corn flakes crumbs it helped it not to be messy at all. Delicious!!!

I rolled the dogs in a hearty amount of ketchup and only a little mustard (personal preference) then rolled them in panko as another reviewer suggested. They were actually very good as far as hot dogs go!

These were great! Kids loved them! I used I used "Healthy Ones Beef Franks" and croutons for the crust and they turned out great. I will definately make this again.

These were pretty good! I used parmesan and crackers to roll the hot dogs in. I would make these again! Nice change from regular hot dogs.

I thought these were good. I think it is important to use the kind of hotdog that your family prefers. Its also fun to play with differant topping options as other reviewers have stated. This is a easy family meal when you don't just want plain hotdogs again.

These were pretty good i wonder if they'd be better deep fried? I know its not healthy but everything in moderation once in a while isn't bad.

These were a great idea especially for something different. However we had trouble getting much of a coating on them (even double dipping them) -We tried lots of techniques but to no avail. Ours certainly did not look like they do in the picture!! It was fun to "play" & make dinner with my daughter but I won't make these again without really changing the recipe up.

Good but leaves you wanting. Not a problem necessarily with the dish itself but I can't figure out what a good side would be. Alone you have to eat too many to get your fill.

An easy way to have the kids help with dinner. Didn't have corn flakes; make two different varities: half were with onion flakes mixed with panko crumbs; they other half were made with crushed BBQ potato chips. The kids really enjoyed these and gobbled them up. Served with homemade apple sauce and baked beans. Thanks for a quick weeknight meal Julie

My 9 year old daughter liked it. I thought they were okay. We did not taste the mustard and ketchup so we dipped it in some more. I won't be making again because they made a huge mess when eating them. There are crumbs all over my table.

Very easy to make. The cornflakes gives the hot dogs a good crunch new experience n eathing hot dogs. Baking the hotdogs makes the dogs jucier. Will make these again quite often.

Kids loved these and it was a nice way to repurpose some leftovers and overlooked stuff in the cabinet. We used leftover jalapeno dogs and we coated them in some chedder explosion and pretzel goldfish we had creepin around in the cabinet.

This worked out really well with my 4 year old granddaughter doing lots of the work.  I just poured ketchup over the 1/4 hotdog pieces and then rolled them in rice crispies ( a bit crunched up)  Really good for a fun kid/adult meal with lots of kid help.  I made roasted veggies and put a bunch of sauces on the table...lovely!!  One package of hotdogs fed 5 adults and 2 kids.
