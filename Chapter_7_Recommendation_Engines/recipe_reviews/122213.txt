I was surprised how good this was for being so easy. Had a nice balance of flavors, but it is indeed spicy--might not be for everyone because of that. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added a tad more crushed red pepper and slightly more chicken. I used Swanson's Organic Chicken Broth, which was recommended by Cook's Illustrated as the best store-bought chicken broth, and the meat from a rotisserie chicken. It came out pretty thick, and I even added an extra cup of chicken broth.

OMG! this soup is the best! I want to give it more than five stars! **********
I took it to work for a potluck. Everyone loved it! I put a handful of tortilla chips and a squeeze of lime at the bottom of my bowl then serve the soup over it...mmmm so good! Perfect for those rainy, cold nights at home.

Add two tablespoons of Curry powder for an EXCELLENT cold day soup!  I also substituted brown long grain rice for the white stuff and sauteed the celery and onion in butter before adding the broth and other ingredients.  This meal was hearty, filling and delicious!

Finally made this soup and it was delicious! I almost doubled the broth and am glad I did b/c there still wasn't as much as we are used to. I boiled the chicken breasts in the broth and then shredded the meat. Added 4 cloves of garlic and used 2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp cumin, one bunch of fresh cilantro and 3 serano peppers instead of the red chili flakes. Flavor and spice level was perfect! Also used brown minute rice which I added 10 minutes before it was done. At this same time I added the shredded chicken and the red onions which I had sauteed in 1 TBS olive oil. Will make again!

I was really excited to make soup by just throwing stuff in a pot and letting it cook. I would have to recommend letting the celery and carrots cook on their own in the broth for 10 minutes or so because mine were still crunchy when the rice was done. I put all the seasonigs into a mortar and ground them. Also, to add more flavor, I added a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce, a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with juice, and a nice sized glug of white wine. I added garlic powder to taste, and definitely more chili flakes than the recipe called for. I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts that I chopped up, for a good texture. I cut the kernels off an ear of corn and added that, and I chopped up a zucchini and threw that in too! I love extra veggies in my soup. I think the amount of rice is pretty much spot on at 1/3 cup. Everyone liked it. The leftovers got mushy, but tasted good. Will make again.

I also used turkey because I forgot to buy chicken.  It was great!  I prepared the soup and then put in the crockpot for about 3 hours on high.

Excellent Soup!  I mind a few minor changes-doubled the cumin, used a full pound of chicken and added a fresh jalapeno.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very nicely!

An excellent recipe!  I, like others, doubled the broth.  Also, on one occassion I added 1/2 cup andoulle sausage (you could also use a milder kielbasa) along with the chicken, omitted the oregano and added a dash of cajun spice.  Voila! Chicken bog!

Excellent soup!  I followed recipe exact, using brown basmati rice though and cooking it 45min because that rice takes longer to cook. So delicious, not too spicy at all!  It didn't make 6 servings in my opinion though - but we'll have this again - we all loved it!

Great recipe!  I made it for my son and daughter-in-law using a suggetstion from an earlier review.  Substituted 2 jalepeno peppers for the green pepper and the flavor was fantastic.  I debated about adding tomatoes, but didn't this time.  May try that next time.  Think that would make it very similar to tortilla soup.

Very good.  I thought the heat level was just right.  I did use leftover turkey rather than chicken.  And I added an extra 2 cups of broth - I like a thicker soup, but 4 cups of broth just wasn't enough.  Thanks.

I was really looking forward to this soup and am not that excited with how it turned out. All of the ingredients are fabulous and I followed the recipe 100%, it just doesn't have a lot of flavor. It is a very light-mild flavor and I thought it was missing something.

FOLLOW THE ADIVCE OF THE REVIEWS: Per the reviews, I used 4 cups (32 ounces) of chicken broth but reduced the amount of veggies I put in so the soup would still be "soupy." I also added Curry per one review and it was super yummy - highly recommend it as well!   FREEZE EXTRA SERVINGS: I was able to freeze two servings and brought one serving to work today for lunch and it was just as good as it was when it was fresh!

This soup really warms and soothes on a chilly day.  I would omit the salt next time.  The chicken broth was salty enough.  Next time I make I, I'd probably add a little minced garlic and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, my personal preference, but this is truly delicious as the recipe is written.   Definitely worth the 5 stars for both ease of preparation and flavor.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe Elaine.

I sauteed the veggies first just for the heck of it and then did everything else according to the recipe. It tasted REALLY good. I was pleasently surprised because chicken soup isn't generally my favorite but I loved it. Next time i would add more broth just because I like more liquid in my soup.

Used rotisserie chicken from the store and added in corn and mushrooms.  Subbed the rice with whole wheat pasta.  Sauteed the carrots and onions with the spices first before putting everything together.  Wonderfully easy and heartwarming dish for the sick boyfriend =).  Definitely double the broth too.

This was a great soup! Thanks Elaine for sharing. I didn't have broth, but had a leftover chicken carcass, so made a broth with water. I also left out the pepper, onion, oregano (forgot), cumin (my son doesn't like it)... I used a can of canned carrots, frozen celery, and a veggie broth cube or two.

My kids cried out, "Oh my GOSH!! This is amazing!!" That coming from kids who only like chicken & stars from a can. Fantastic and simple and I had everything I needed without a trip to the store! I chose this when I had a head cold and couldn't taste much of anything. This was sooo flavorful, even my head cold couldn't stop it! The only change I made was to bring all ingredients to a boil before adding the rice. I do this when I make plain rice, too as it keeps the rice from being too sticky. Also waited to add cilantro just before serving b/c my kids don't like it and it keeps it's fresh flavor that way. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  My picky 7 year old even wanted seconds.  I made 8 servings and the only thing I changed was that I put a total of 8 cups of broth (plus about 4 cups of water to boil my chicken in).  It fed 3 adults and a child and there's probably enough left for 2 more adults. I'll make this again soon!

We are hooked on this soup! I don't think that I can ever eat just regular Chicken Rice soup again. It's delicious. The only thing that I would say is that there is not enough broth for us in this recipe so I make extra but everything else is perfect! Thank you

DELICIOUS recipe! I loved the veggie blend. A note, I doubled the chicken and rice and quadrupled the spice and added some cayenne pepper. It was super thick and chunky and delicious! Next time, I'll probably add more broth too, or not double the rice. Pay attention to your rice cooking instructions. I used rice that normally cooks in 45 minutes, so I had to simmer my soup longer to get the rice cooked.

Easy way to use some leftover roasted chicken. My son and his wife really raved over this soup and asked me to make it again. They liked the mix of spices, which was according to the recipe. I chopped my veggies into about quarter-inch dice and shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. I used basmati rice, which turned out great.

This soup ranks among my top choices for using leftover rotisserie chicken and it's even better with broth made from the rotisserie chicken bones & skin.  I think a quick saute of the veggies (with the spices added)  brings out the flavors even more, then add the broth, rice, and chicken.

I have made this soup so many times that I have lost count.  I love it.  I add a can of diced tomatoes and I cook the rice on the side so that I can add it as desired. When I have left overs I freeze it and it is just as good later on. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this in the crockpot so it was done when I got home. Letting frozen chicken breasts cook all day makes them so tender. My wife thought it was a little on the spicy side but I loved it.

I made this with a few alterations.  My store was out of green peppers!  Who knew there was a shortage?  I did have red, yellow and orange bell peppers, so I used a combination of those in place of the green.  I agree with other reviewers that this does need more broth.  I used about 4 1/2 cups at first and I knew it still needed more.  But, I waited until reheating to add more, because I knew the rice would continue to absorb the broth as it sat in the refrigerator.  Did it ever!  When it was time to reheat the soup, there was hardly any broth left, so I added another three cups.  The soup was still very flavorful and we enjoyed it and would make it again.  But do remember that rice (or pasta) will absorb moisture if you make it ahead, so adjust accordingly.

This is a great soup, especially considering how easy it is to throw together.  I didn't even cook the chicken first.  I just cooked it all a few minutes longer, even though I probably didn't have to.  I also used chili paste instead of red pepper flakes for an extra kick.  I was surprised by how flavorful it was and the cumin made the house smell wonderful for the rest of the day.  Definitely a keeper.

Used a roasted chicken from Costco and Pacific Brand Organic Chicken broth. Didn't have fresh parsley (not sure I would have liked it anyway) so I used 1 T dried parsley instead. Omitted the green pepper. Was really easy to make and everyone liked it. Might cut the salt to 1/4 tsp next time. Thanks for the recipe Elaine.

As is, I give this recipe 4 stars.  It is a very good soup, but it is made better quite easily... In my opinion, it hops very quickly to a 5 star soup by using some whole chicken thighs instead of precooked chicken... and tossing them in with a little more broth, all the other ingredients (minus the rice) plus a little salsa.  Let them all simmer until the carrots are getting tender... THEN add the rice and let simmer until it is toothy.  We all know that rice is going to soften up as it sits after cooking.  Dip out and shred the chicken after it's done.  It was ten times better this way.  Very good base recipe, but even better if you have time to use fresh chicken.

I agree.  This is very simple, very easy
and very tasty. Great cold weather  
comfort food.  But, hey, if you baited a
trap with cumin and crushed red pepper
flakes, you'd catch me on a daily basis.
My only change was to increase the cumin
and red pepper (to suit my taste) and 
added a couple of bay leaves, which I 
also love.  This is not only an excellent
recipe for left over roast chicken, it's
also a great incentive to roast one.
Thank you, Elaine.

B+ A good recipe that lacks a bit of taste so I would recommend adding more seasonings than the recipe states. I doubled the recipe but added more salt, pepper, red pepper flakes. Also in the beginning, to add a depth of flavor to the dish, I sauteed the onions in olive oil with minced garlic for 2 mins, then chopped up the chicken breasts into small pieces and sauteed for about 4 mins. turned out yummy!

This was perfect just the way it was. Made this as a summer soup with fresh cilantro from my garden. Garnished with cucumbers and tomatoes. Put "Hot Sauce" out for someone wanting a bit more of a "Kick." Only thing I might do different next time is dice up a colorful jalepeno for additional hotness.

This soup is amazingly simple and oh so tasty. I too doubled the chicken stock and was glad that I did.  I also used minute rice and added it the last 5 minutes.  The flavor was wonderful and my hubby told me what a good job I did on the spices.  Try this receipe, you won't be sorry.

perfect as is however i did not have cumin so i used the same amount in curry powder. another person suggested using 2tbs of curry and i can tell you it would be a mistake to put that much curry in anything. also other users recommended using more broth and YES i agree double the broth if you want soup and not just a chicken & rice dish thanks for another keeper :)

Delicious! I was looking for a soup to make with my 2 cups of leftover chicken.  I cut just about all the ingredients in half accordingly except for the broth - 2 cups wasn't going to be enough liquid, I ended up using about 5 cups. I didn't have carrots so I threw in some frozen peas and used dried parsley instead of fresh. I loved the spice combo - the red pepper gave it a nice little kick.  Even cutting the recipe in half, my hubby and I had enought leftovers for lunch. This is a keeper!

I have found my chicken and rice soup that I have been searching for.  I have also found a recipe that I can like brown rice for, which is good for my diet.  I increase liquid and spices by 50%, added some corn and half a can of diced tomatoes.  I thought it was a little mild for me, and thought to use a can of rotel next time, but the left overs were fine, I guess it got stronger as it set.  I like things spicy, but if you like it just a little spicy then it's perfect.  Thanks so much Elaine for this great recipe.

I made this soup with the parsely not cilantro. I also didnt use a whole green pepper or onion because the soup was so thick... I did add more broth and used Rotisserie chicken. I also added some lemon juice to enhance the flavors. My soup did not turn out very spicy, but it was delicous. If I use cilantro next time will it taste spicier? Any suggestions? Thanks!

I followed the recipe and it turned out really good. The kids liked it and I had everything on hand that the recipe called for. I added an extra can of broth to the leftovers so they would remain soupy and the leftovers were just as good as the first batch. This is going into the regular recipe rotation. Thanks Elaine!

Definitely need to double the recipe for a family of four. Was just enough to serve three with a little leftover, and our bowls weren't very big. Also it wasn't spicy, at all, so I added cayenne pepper to my bowl and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe will make again.

I've made this soup many times and my husband loves it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly . Now I follow the basic recipe but add more chicken and rice to make it stew like....however you make it it's a winner!

Healthy, hearty, and a little bit spicy. Good for bringing in to lunch.

Great soup. Made some changes, added chick peas, diced tomatoes, mushrooms and lipton onion soup mix (dry). Great and spicy, just right!!
