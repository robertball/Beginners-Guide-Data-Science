I made this recipe as is and didn't have any troubles. I don't use a beater to mix the ingredients, i just use a wooden spoon. This seems to make the consistency less sticky. (for me, anyway)A very easy recipe to make if you have kids to impress. They love the look and taste :)

These are easy to make, taste great and have a nice texture. They do lose a star because they tend to crack when the "wings" are inserted. I tried adding both extra peanut butter and Lyle's Golden Syrup without success. I did use a natural peanut butter, perhaps that is what caused the cracking problem.

I made these for my son's preschool graduation picnic, and everyone loved them. I found that the consistency of the dough was sticky and hard to roll into balls. Also, I will process the graham crackers more finely next time, to allow for easier "wing" insertion. I will definitely make these cute treats again, but play with the proportions of ingredients for assembly purposes.

5 stars for the idea. 2 for the recipe so I think I'll settle on 3. I found the pb mixture awfully sticky. After shaping I popped it into the fridge for about 1/2 hour and that helped. I didn't have any cracking problems during wing insertion like other reviewers mentioned. All in all they were very cute, pretty tasty and a total pain in the rear to make. BUT my 6 y/o daughter loved them and acted like I was some kind of kitchen fairy for having made them :-)

My 6-year-old sister and I made these together the other day. Although the bees are very cute, as some of my family members stated, the taste is not that awesome. I also only got about 12 bees out of the mixture, and the chocolate was not easy to pipe on (especially for a 6-year old!) These are adorable, but not exactly tasty. Thanks for sharing, though!

These were a pretty big hit at my 2 year old's birthday party, with the kids and the adults. However they were time consuming and difficult to make. Too many grahm cracker crumbs and the almonds kept breaking!
