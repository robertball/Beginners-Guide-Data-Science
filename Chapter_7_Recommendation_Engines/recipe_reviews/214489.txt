Another keeper from AR! A couple of slight changes due to lack of a whole bottle of Italian salad dressing. I only had a few tbsp of bottled dressing so I improvised with EVOO, fresh lemon juice, scallion onions, 1 tsp crushed sage, 1tbsp crushed oregano, 4 large minced garlic cloves and  cracked pepper for the marinade. Used kalamata olives for a more authentic Greek taste and threw in 2 tbsp of bottled sundried tomates I had to use up. I had a 1lb Jurrasic Park sized chicken breast that I pounded out and stuffed with all of the filling ingreduents and baked for 45 mins.  Perfection! Definitely will make again. Served with orzo cooked in my homemade chicken stock and a Greek salad.

Very good. Made this in the last moment and marinated in sherry and italian dressing for just ten minutes. Used kalamata olives, which I think work better in combination with other ingredients than regular olives. Baked for the designated time, but also put on broil for a few minutes to give it a nice browning. Mmmm.

Instead of artichoke hearts I use spinach.  The feta in this dish brings out lots of great flavor.  I serve this over brown rice...Make sure to OVERstuff the chicken...the extra sauce makes for a great rice topping!

This was good, Family liked it. I marinated the chicken over night. My family do not care for capers, so I omitted them from the recipe. I added Kalamata olives and used the whole can of articoke hearts. I finished them off with a sprinkle of italian spices.

These cooked up really well.  I didn't have the problem with them not cooking through that another reviewer mentioned, but I did think the flavors were too parallel.  If I made this again I might cut back on some of the other stuffing and add some sliced sun-dried tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious. I marinated my chicken for two days and cooked it for about 45 minutes as the breasts were a little thick even after I pounded them. I also sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan cheese on the top about ten minutes before I removed them from the oven.  I have a family of extremely picky eaters, but everyone loved this.

So Delicious! My husband loved it and he is not a big fan of Feta Cheese and Artichokes! I also added Sundried Tomatoes. I am making it again tonight!

My family loved this for it's bold, unique flavor.  I didn't really plan ahead so I took the chicken breasts out of the freezer in the morning and marinated them as they thawed; it worked out fine.  I served it with a pasta salad with the extra artichoke hearts, olives and some capers, plus cherry tomatoes & peppers from our garden.  I can't wait for another special opportunity to cook this meal again!

Prepared recipe as written...It was delicious. Lots of flavors going on.
I prepared it again without marinating the chicken breast and without olives because I ran out.  Still delicious and flavorful.

I was getting bored of making the same old thing and fell upon this recipe.  It is so good that I am making a second time tonight.  I didn't have time for the chicken to marinate in Italian dressing so instead used a pack of McCormick's Grill Mates garlic, herb and wine flavor.  It doesn't have to marinate as long and worked really well.  I used kalamata olives.  Otherwise I did the recipe as written.  Delicious!!

I tried this recipe almost exactly as written.  The only changes I made were to pound out the chicken prior to marinating, and I only marinated it for 3-4 hours.  Also, I used kalamata olives, as those are our favorite.  It probably took about 40 minutes until I was sure the chicken was cooked through.  

It was DELICIOUS and so, so easy.  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the filling ingredients complemented each other nicely. 

This was the first time I'd ever experimented with a stuffed chicken recipe, and after one bite the boyfriend and I declared this recipe a keeper.  We're playfully arguing over who gets to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight.  We'll probably experiment some with other ingredients in the stuffing, but this recipe will probably see weekly use from now on.

This is a great recipe, just what i had in mind.  It's not even finished yet but i know everyone will LOVE it.  Only one problem is i started eating the filling by itself before i started stuffing, so i kinda ran out before i was supposed to but soooooo good! :) All the comments helped, i did everything as the recipe said only added the sundried tomatoes and used the kalamata olives.

My husband really liked this recipe, but I thought it was just ok.  I had such a hard time telling if the chicken was done.  I teach food safety and the chicken just wasn't getting done and I had to keep cutting into it.  When if finally was done, the chicken was dry.

This was satisfying, healthy, and delicious.  I thought artichokes tasted a bit odd paired with olives, but it didn't detract from the dish too much.  Like many other posters, I also used kalamata olives rather than the plain black ones.

This is a terrific recipe! 

I used a low calorie, bottled Greek salad dressing as the marinade and added thawed, well-drained frozen spinach to increase the veggies.

WOW!!! The greatest recipe on here. I did change it up a bit, but nothing that affected the taste.  I doubled the recipe, and instead of rolling the chicken up, I layered half of the flattened chicken in the bottom of a casserole dish, put the cheese mix in the middle, and the other half of the chicken on top.  I also added a cup or so of chopped fresh spinach, and dried tomatoes to the cheese mis - just because I had them on hand, and because other reviewers said they added them.  I topped it with a mix of Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  This is just fyi.... the recipe didn't necessarily need these changes... This will be a go to recipe for this house.  YUMM!

Yummy!  I didn't have time to marinate, but this was still really delicious!  Like another reviewer, I also used Kalamata olives.  Definitely think they match better with capers and feta.  The filling was so delicious that I ate what didn't fit in the chicken as an appetizer!

Simple yet looks fancy.  Just make sure not to over cook.  I pounded mine pretty thin so they dried out but I poured the juice they released over 'em right before serving so they were good to go!
