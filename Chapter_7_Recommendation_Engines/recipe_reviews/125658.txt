Outstanding! My dinner guest, a die hard red enchilada sauce fan, was swept away by these enchiladas and proclaimed these her new favorite (me too). Not to mention, I've never known her to eat much and she all but licked the plate clean! Genuine, simple and understated flavors, that all blended together perfectly. Just delicious, and just as written, "decorated" with a plop of sour cream. Can't wait to make this again--and I WILL make this again!

This recipe received 5 stars from my super picky husband.  I did adapt it a bit.  I used about 3/4 cup green chili salsa instead of the green chiles in the cream sauce, and I put the small can of green chiles in with the filling.  I also created a bed of cooked white rice with whole corn and diced roasted red peppers in the baking dish, and then put the enchiladas on it, which soaked up the extra cream sauce nicely and made a yummy side dish.  It might have been too much cream sauce otherwise.

This recipe turned out great. I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli and shredded all the meat off of it. For the sauce I used a 14 oz. can of chicken broth,1/2 cup sour cream & 1/2 cup greek style yogurt to cut some of the fat. I also added some garlic powder,cumin, & paprika.When I rolled the tortillas with the chicken and cheese, I spooned a little bit of sauce on top before rolling them.Baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.I used a 9x12 dish and was able to squeeze a couple extra tortillas in there.My husband loved this dish!! Not runny at all, just delicious!

Made this tonight & it was a big hit! I followed the recipe ingredients, however I made it more like a casserole by layering the corn tortillas,chicken,sauce & cheese until my pan was full. I also added more green chile as my family prefers it hot! It was easy to make & will have it again soon..thanks!

Now these are some ENCHILADAS!  We live in Arizona and this recipe meets or beats all of the Mexican food restaurants here, and there are a lot of them!

The sauce itself is four stars!  Overall I did some "doctoring" (added a dollop of sour cream to the filler mixture and also used freshly chopped sauteed onion instead of minced) in efforts to get the kids to eat it.   :-)

OMG!! These came out soooo good! I had a five pound chicken that I roasted with olive oil and a super dry rub. My mom got me one of the roasters that are like the beer can thing, anyway, when this chicken came out of the oven it was a work of art in itself!! I shredded it, mixed in the onions and cheese. I added some of the chicken liquid so it was  nice and moist. At this point, the old man could hardly contain himself.. I'll help..I'll help...SURE..so we got them all rolled, we made 24..and the sauce came out great. I used fresh green chili and we both thought it could have used more (next time). ANYWAY...they were heavenly!! This is the only recipe I will ever use!! I'm toying with the idea of using shredded pork, onions and cheese in the corn tortillas, smothered in red chili, (old man makes killer red chili)and covered in TONS of cheese. Ummmm..anyway, it's 7:30am and I can hardly wait till supper!! lol Thanks for passing this on to us!

This was a very good recipe.  Extremely rich, and very filling.  After reading the reviews I was pretty aggressive about spicing them up, we like flavorful foods.  I started by sauteing the onions in EVOO with garlic and some minced jalepeno, then added the cooked chicken, cumin, cayene and some chipotle powder.  For the sauce I added some more minced jalepeno, cumin, chipotle and salt.  I put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes to finish off before the garnishes.  Thank you for your submission, very tasty!

YUMMY STUFF!  Easy to make and even my husband, who doesn't usually like Mexican food, loved it.  As I was rolling the enchiladas he was taking the chicken chunks and dipping them in the sauce.  My kids asked for it twice this week.

wow...this is great stuff!  i only used two chix breasts and added sauteed mushrooms to the filling in place of the third breast.  instead of green chilis (i don't care for them), i subbed tomatilla sauce--and added a little extra.  i also mixed the cilantro into the sauce so the flavor would bake through instead of possibly tasting like an 'afterthought'.  added 1 tsp. cayenne and 1 Tbs. garlic powder as well.  i baked with the green onions on top for the same reason, rather then adding them after the pan was out of the oven.  last, i subbed panela cheese for the mozz. and sprinkled a crumbly mex. cheese on the top after i pulled it out of the oven.   !magnifico!  would make again in a heartbeat!  p.s.  makes for great left-overs as well.  just *HAD* to nuke a lil sample after re-living last night's awesome experience!  mmmmm.  i think i'm goin' back for more.

I have made this dish many times and everyone loves it. The only changes I have made over time are to double the amount of green chiles in the sauce, saute the onions first (the first time they came out still crunchy in the enchiladas and I didn't like that), and I spoon a little sauce into each enchilada before rolling them up. Heating the corn tortillas first is a MUST, otherwise they crack and split when you roll them up. I have tried this recipe with four fajita-size tortillas and they are great, too. Sometimes I will do half flour, half corn, especially for friends so they can choose. Overall, SUPER great recipe! I'm so glad I found it!

Amazing!! Perfect!! The only thing I do any differently is flour tortillas since no one in my family likes corn ones, and I spread about a teaspoon of sour cream on the tortilla before I do the chicken and cheese. That helps keep them soft, and with a good flour tortilla (not Mission) there's no need to pre-soften. Also, they are good without the green chilies, but incredible with. Green chilies aren't hot peppers so it's not something that you have to worry about. I usually get 16 or 17 enchiladas out of 3 good size chicken breasts. They come out so yummylicious that my kids, even my picky eater, requests them about 3 times a week. Seriously, if I could give more than 5 stars, I seriously would.

I am only rating the sauce because I just made it for burritos.  I did not do the enchiladas.  This sauce is to die for!  It's wonderful!  I used fresh fire roasted green chiles and added a little more sour cream and "better than boullion" to the sauce because I was almost out (I just used what I had left). This is incredible!  Highly recommend and thanks for the recipe!

Great idea & the measurements are spot-on, but it was too bland for me as written.  I ended up adding some coriander, turmeric, garlic powder & cayenne pepper to the sauce the first time as I had them on hand.  Also, I do not use sour cream anymore for anything.  A high quality, plain, Greek style yoghurt can be substituted 100% for sour cream to cut fat & increase health benefits without a change in flavor (if it doesn't taste like sour cream then it's not high quality, no matter what it cost).   I have found I prefer to add mushrooms & sometimes beans or Spanish rice to the filling mix & I no longer fry the tortillas-they roll fine at room temp.  I've also used leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the chicken.  This recipie, as written, is a great starting point.

YUM! We cooked the chicken on the grill, then shredded it. I filled the tortillas while hubby made the green chili sauce. Perfect timing for two people cooking together. The sauce was done when I was done filling the tortillas. Then the spanish rice I cooked as the enchiladas were in the oven. And, the beans were in the small crock pot. It was an excellent meal!

Made according to the dircetions it turned out VERY good. My boyfriend took one bite and said "this is awesome!" then when he was half way through he said "If you wanted to make these again- I wouldn't stop you!" I just added some more spices so that it wouldn't be so bland =)

Fast, easy and delicious! I shredded leftover beer can chicken breasts and one leg quarter with the cheese. (Usually make 2 -3 beer can chickens at a time in order to have the leftover meat available)  Also added 1 extra 4 oz. can of chopped chiles into the filling. The sauce mixture is a great idea and nice change of pace.

I'd give this ten stars, if available.  Everyone loved it!  I didn't have pre-cooked chicken, so I poached a chicken breast in chicken broth, which gave it wonderful flavor.  Sadly, I also didn't have Monterrey Jack cheese (poor planning), so I sub'd a mixture of Mozzarella & Cheddar cheeses.  It worked well.  As others suggested, I did sautee the onions in EVO, to soften them, which my children prefer.

Thank you for this great recipe!  I made this last night and my boyfriend and I devored almost the entire pan ourselves.  I followed the recipe to a T except I cheated and shredded a roasted chicken to save some time.  This will definitely be a keeper.

I have tried many enchilada recipes on here and these were the absolute BEST! My kids inhaled them, even the two who normally refuse to eat anything with more than one ingredient. Definitely take the time to fry the corn tortillas before rolling -- it makes all the difference. I was a little worried that the sauce appeared to be a bit runny when I poured it over the enchiladas but after baking it was the perfect consistency and tasted wonderfully rich! I used cumin to taste in the chicken mixture before rolling.

Very good - hubby loved em - I thought they needed salsa to go with them and I didnt have any on hand :( I found a great way to make the chicken for any mexican dish though - so Im happy about that (I took the chicken breasts and mixed 2/3 c. water and 1 packet of taco seasoning - baked, covered, till done - shredded chicken and returned it to soak in the leftover juices and added chopped onions and pablano chilies - so my filling had a nice kick to it)  I, personally, was overwhelmed by the cilantro and will definitely be eliminating (or greatly reducing) that the next time I make these - Overall very good!!!

I was wanting to make potato enchiladas, but I didn't have any type of enchilada sauce in the pantry.  I quickly found this recipe and gave the sauce a try.  It was so good!  The only thing I did differently was add more green chile because I am a huge green chile fan and I used water with bouillon cubes because it's all I had on hand.  I plan on making this again as written, I am sure it's great!

Had to make some reasonable adjustments on this to suit my vegetarian family. Replaced the chicken broth with some vegetable stock, and the chicken with some green chilis, cilantro and tomatoes. The sauce was a bit on the bland side, so I added some jalapenos and about 1/2 tsp of cumin. Next time, I will either make 1/2 the sauce or 2x the enchiladas. My husband said this was one of the top 5 meals I've made!

I've been making enchiladas of every kind for as long as I can remember. These were the absolute best. I did not use the cilantro, but otherwise, made them true to the recipe. Hubby and I scarfed them down at dinner, then finished them for lunch. Yummy, yummy!

I used shredded chicken from bone in breasts, a mix of Monterrey Jack and White Cheddar cheeses, and a vegan sour cream substitute made of silken tofu (really cuts the fat content down) - DELICIOUS! I found that spooning a couple spoonfuls of sauce into the enchiladas before rolling them up helped them be very moist and flavorful throughout. Will make again!

I found this recipe and was not disappointed at all. It was very creamy and delicious! The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because I felt it needed a little more kick with the green chiles, but only because I like spicy foods. I used mild green chiles because I knew my 3 and 4 year old would be eating this and I wanted them to enjoy this---which they very much did (surprisingly because they are both very picky eaters).  Great recipe!!!

4.5 stars because I KNOW, this would have been too bland for my tastes as written. However, nice starting point. I was in the "use it up" mode so..had pre-cooked frozen chicken breast I thawed/chopped and seasoned up (3 Cups). Added 1/4 C each roasted/diced fresh poblano pepper & red bell pepper plus 1/4 C each of homemade refried beans and sour cream to chicken filling. I finely minced a sweet onion & mixed in about 1/3 C of that also. I had a bag of Mexican shredded cheese blend to use vs M Jack. This filled 12 corn tortillas (I heat in skillet to soften) I looked this up for the grn chile sauce but used a tomatillo salsa (didnt' have the grn chiles) with some of my minced poblano chilies. Added garlic/cumin/coriander/cayenne/parsley. Only used 1/2 S crm called for. Even with my additions/adjustments the taste was super. I wanted to use something other than 'red' sauce & this was it. Thanks for a versatile recipe you can adjust or adapt. I baked the cilantro & grn onion on top with the cheese. My company devoured them all!

I added some some southwest seasoning to the chicken, and put a generous teaspoon of chopped fresh cilantro inside each enchilada to add a little more flavor, and they were very good.

Just wonderful!!! I added 3 crushed garlic cloves to the sauce. Think I will sauté the onions for just a few minutes next time. It's perfect the way it is if you like it mild, add some jalapeños for more spice if you like. I also did not use all 3 chicken breasts, it was just to much. Would be great with shrimp or crab or just spinach and mushrooms. Great recipe that you love as is or you can do a lot with it.

Very Yummy! I only had cheddar cheese instead of MJ, which I'm sure would of been even better. I might try Pepperjack next time to spice it up.

So good!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used fat free sour cream (my husband couldn't tell a difference).  I do not like spicy foods, but I did use Hot green chiles and the enchiladas were not too spicy, but had a nice zing.  I also broiled the enchiladas for the last five minutes to get the brown bubbled cheese flavor.  Yummy!

I made exactly according to recipe, made no changes. I used twelve small corn tortillas and that filled one 9x13 baking dish perfectly. My husband and I thought this was a little bland. He used a little homemade salsa on top and then it was just right. When I make this again, I'll add a few more spices. I think CookinBug had it right by using a chicken that had been cooked in spices. Kind of layering the flavor is kind of needed to balance out the richness of the sauce. Quite easy to make, really only took under an hour.

I ALWAYS fix dishes exactly as the recipe states the first time I make it. I don't think it is fair to rate a recipe if you change it... This recipe was great as is and was not too spicy even for the kids. The second time I made it just for the adults (all of whom like spice) I did double the green chiles and added a little cilantro/green onion mix inside each roll. Made a great deal of flavor change for the adults. I made enough for 4-each for 4 adults and still ran out (& we have very picky friends) This recipe is great. P.S. I did make the rue with real butter... mine always turns out better that way than using margarine or spread.

At first I found this a little bland, even with add-ins (jalapenos, garlic, cumin) and thought it was just okay.  However, the next day I took two 'chiladas for lunch and was sorry I didn't bring more.  The flavors came together perfectly and it was fantastic!  Will definately make this again but let it sit in the refrig. overnight or at least several hours for the flavors to meld.  Makes a huge difference!

this is a great recipe to build from to suit your own taste. it seemed bland to me so i added to the filling cumin, 3/4 can hot rotel tomatoes,small can green chiles,and small can of green enchilada sauce. filled the flour tortillas with a little cheese and and the chicken filling. when i made the sauce i added another can of green enchilada sauce and remainder of rotel. poured over enchiladas and added plenty of monterey jack cheese.

not very good, way too much sauce (I guess I could have only poured half of it on the enchiladas) and I would have left the cheese off the top (way too much cheese to this recipe).They just didn't have anything to them, just chicken and cheese was about all there was to it.  to me it needed rice, beans, the works...

I can only really rate the sauce, which I thought was nice but fairly bland.  My 6 year old loved it though! I used 1 pound of ground turkey (what I had on hand) cooked with half a packet of low sodium taco seasoning and added some of the green chilies (I had a 7oz can, so 4 oz in the sauce, and 3 in the meat) and sauteed onion for the filling.  Next time I will add some salsa to the meat when I cook it, to give it more flavor.  I will also put some sauce on the bottom of the pan before I put the enchiladas in, as the bottom got a bit hard.   I  used more tortillas (probably closer 18) and packed them tightly in the pan.

Great recipe.  For a vegetarian option, substitute sautéed spinach and garlic and/or hominy, instead of chicken.  My family loved this, and I followed the recipe exactly (other than adding the above ingredients with a little roasted chicken ... We're not big meat eaters!).  Served with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, green and red onions, and homemade salsa ... I didn't feel that this needed additional spices, even though generally I use a lot of spices.  This sauce would also be great on seafood enchiladas!

the best! this is way cheaper than buying enchilada sauces! i steam my corn tortillias in a steamer pan (spray the steamer pan w/ pam so the bottom one's don't stick... makes it less calories and the tortillias are rollable!).  Great recipe! very affordable!!!

Great! I like to add some sauce to the chicken before I roll it up and then pour the rest on top. And I melt the cheese into the sauce, rather then putting it separate in the enchiladas. Really good as leftovers so I usually make extra.

I loved this recipe! I followed all of the instructions and it came out great! I did add a little cumin and jalapeno. This recipe does have a good amount of sauce and I think next time I will include a layer of rice and corn underneath. I will definitely make this again :)

These were sooo much better than Restaurant style! YUM! I heated the tortillas in  the microwave for 2 minutes. I used leftover marinated chicken Fajita meat(from my favorite grocer)that we cooked a few night before and chopped it up small. I didn't have the fancy cheese so we shredded some Monterey Jack and Shredded cheddar. We sprinkled chopped olives on top and actually put it in the microwave for 10 minutes instead of the oven. Soo good! We will be making this again! Thanks!

Try these and you won't be disappointed!! They are truly wonderful and worth the extra effort instead of opening a can of enchilada sauce. The second time I made them I used hot green chiles and 1TB of jalapeno juice or jalapeno tabasco in it for a little kick. It still wasn't all that spicy but great flavor!!! I make these all the time and my parents who are very picky asked me for the recipe. My grandma steals any leftovers if I tell her I made it!!

Simple and delicious! Of course, I added an entire jar of green chili sauce made from one of Albuquerque's many local New Mexican food restaurants.  Topped with sour cream and chives even though the green chili sauce called for sour cream as well.

Good base recipe that is made better with the following additions:  I poach chicken breasts in white wine and chicken broth with oregano, then remove and reserve the broth. Shred the chicken. Fry onion and garlic, add a bit of white wine, a can of chiles, chili powder, cumin and shredded chicken. Roll the tortillas with the chicken mixture and cheese. Add 4 TBS flour (less than called for) to butter then add a can of chiles and a can of salsa verde (green tomatoes and peppers. Stir in the reserved wine broth and sour cream - adding less sour cream to keep it a bit greener and fresher looking. A lot of changes but wow - one of the best enchiladas ever.

This was a huge hit with my family and guests, very easy to make and really delicious.  I'm going to add some heat next time & use fresh jalapeños in the sauce as the canned chilies were a bit too mild for me.

Great recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

First time I ever challenged myself to make something new for my husband and son since I’m not the best cook but OMG did I shock them and even myself... and I didn’t even burn it!  This is a great recipe! I’m so proud of myself!

This is a very good start to chicken enchiladas.  I made this as written, but would have enjoyed a little heat and spice mixed in with the chicken.  The sauce on the top is very good, and I will leave it the same when I make this again.

The sauce is good but like other reviewers, I agree that the filling needs something with more kick- maybe hot chiles in that as well.

Really delicious! Couldn't stop eating them. I made these tonight and followed the recipe as directed except I used two cans of the green chilis and sauteed the onion in butter! I thought they were by far the best chicken enchiladas I've ever made! My husband added hot sauce and enjoyed them very much, but as he always insisted that they could have been spicier! I will make these again, soon, and make one pan spicier for my husband. The pan for me will not change! This recipe did not disappoint!!

Amazing!  Just like the ones my mom made when we were growing up.  I double the green chilis for more flavor, but otherwise follow it exactly.

As it stands, this recipe is amazing.  My fiance, who is an incredibly picky eater, has requested that I make these at least once every two weeks.  That was six months ago, and I am making them again tonight! Thank you for this wonderful recipe! Sometimes I do like to play with the ingredients and add an extra can of chilies,pinch of cumin, or more garlic, but really it's great the way it is.

Fried corn tortillas and layered them. Used Mexican Blend Cheese. Kept chopped cilantro separate to sprinkle on top, since not all family members like it. Husband and I enjoyed this recipe and would definitely make it again!

Really yummy, but a bit more work than I would have liked... (no, I'm not lazy, just busy).  I will make them again, though, but not on a week night -- and I will make double the sauce quantity and freeze some, as it does freeze nicely.

I have made these multiple times and they are a family favorite. My only change to the recipe is that I mix the green chiles into the chicken mixture and add a can of rotel into the sauce for a bit of kick. Yum!

Very good, but a needed more seasoning; had to add a lot of salt after the fact, it is better to have the salt cooked into the dish than to add it later.

Only thing I did differently was I used whole wheat tortillas because that is what I had.  These were the best enchiladas I have ever made.  I would say restaurant quality and better because I could adjust the heat. Many times in a restaurant they are too spicy. I put the chiles and also jalapino seeded and chopped.  The sauce was wonderful.

FANTASTIC...your search for green chile enchiladas ends here.  I substitute soft taco size for corn to eliminate the frying.  I throw them right over an open flame for a few seconds to soften them up and roll the  chicken mixture, top with the sauce and throw them in the oven.  This last time I made them I didn't have any sour cream so I used about a 1/4 cup or so of french onion dip...I also add a little jalapeno for some heat.  SO GOOD, SO GOOD!

This was good. I used ground turkey and added 1/2 bottle of salsa verde in it for flavor. I thought the creamy sauce was a little flour-ee...maybe I just let it thicken up too much but this was really good and hubby loved it!

I made this for my sister's family & friends who are not familiar with Mexican dishes.  It was a great hit, everyone loved it!!  My brother in law was looking for the leftovers the next day .  Can't say I'd do anything to change it since it was so good.  Made for just my husband and myself - it was no problem to reduce the recipe to suit the two of us.

WOW! These are excellent. Absolutely excellent. I made a few minor changes, not because I thought the recipe was wrong, but because of what I had on hand. I cooked the chicken in salsa to add a bit of flavor, so I skipped the onion. And I used 7 oz of green chiles instead of 4.

These are seriously excellent. I had to force myself to stop eating them!

This enchilada recipe stands out from the rest! The only changes I made were: I never dip the tortillas in oil. I don't have a problem with them falling apart, maybe because where I live they make them fresh. Also, I don't like raw onions, so I added the onions to the butter and cooked them until soft before adding the flour. Fabulous recipe!

This was very good. Better than the recipes requiring a canned soup. I separated my enchiladas from each other to get them to be slightly crunch instead of soggy on the sides and top.  I had never done this before and found it a success as I had always liked the end ones the best.

This turned out to be more of an 'enchilada casserole'...that is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. With that said, there is no doubt that it is a delicious recipe.  Instead of buying and cooking chicken breasts, I purchased a whole roasted chicken from the store and used the meat off of that.  I like the different flavors that come from the different parts of the chicken.  Also, I just warmed the corn tortillas in the microwave to make them more pliable.  Other modifications included using 1/2 EV olive oil 1/2 butter for the roux and subbing corn starch for flour (1:2).  I also seasoned the sauce with salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.  Even though the consistency wasn't that of "enchiladas" my wife and I still really enjoyed the recipe.

This is really tasty.  It is also really mild, so if you like spicy, I would doctor up the sauce to your heat preference.  

There was enough extra sauce left over to make another 9x9 pan of enchiladas (even after drowning the first 9x13 pan in sauce), so you could probably cut that part of the recipe down to 2/3rds of the called-for quantities.  Or just make more enchiladas!

Delicious! I made it last night and it was a hit!! The creamy sauce is such a welcome change to traditional enchiladas! I made a slight change by using cooked jalapeno chiles and chopping them finely, otherwise, followed the recipe and enjoyed it immensely!

Made as directed except to saute the onion in a bit of oil before adding to the chicken and cheese mixture.  I'd probably add a clove or two of garlic the next time.  The sauce is very rich with a mild flavor, but the boost from the green onion and cilantro garnish gives it a nice finishing touch.  This one's a keeper for me.

This is my favorite enchilada recipe.    My husband absolutely loved it too.  The sauce is outstanding and I had plenty to cover my dish and then some.   It bakes perfectly into the enchiladas.  I omitted the cilantro (not my families favorite).     Great recipe to use up left over roasted chicken.

This was good but the onions were a bit to raw for me. I like them softer and would cook them beforehand with a little garlic next time.

We love this ! It has become one of our favourites, I make this at least twice a month. The only changes I make is to double the sauce, there is never enough. I even heat some separately to pour over the enchiladas at the table. Wish I could give it ten stars! I get ten good sized 8 inch tortillas out of it. I also get a great pot of stock as I usually forget to thaw the chicken so I just poach them and add the chicken to the veg cooked. I make a mean creamy tarragon chicken soup with the stock. So for around $8.50 this makes two dinners and two lunches plus 8 good bowls of soup. You really can't go wrong !

We really enjoyed this. I followed the sauce to a T which is really what makes the difference in these enchiladas.  Nice change.  I'd never complained about to much sauce when it's that delicious.  I added lots of stuff the enchilladas to suit us.  I will use this often. Ty

The sauce is very good and easy to make. I used smoked chicken, smoked hatch chilies, fresh chopped onions and a mix of jack & cheddar for the filling. My guests gobbled them up.

I have made this as printed several times and it is 5 stars for sure.  It is also a recipe that you can fool around with -- I love to use the same techniques for pot roast beef enchiladas.  Make the sauce using beef broth instead.  Maybe place a can of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan, add the enchiladas and then put the homemade sauce on top.  It's a fabulous recipe in and of itself with so many possibilities to experiment.  Thank you aaronspool!

As is, I think the sauce would have been too runny.  I decided to add shredded Monterey jack to the sauce to give it a thicker, creamier, consistency.  I also added some flavor & heat to the chicken with S&P, smoky hot paprika, cumin, garlic, and cayenne.  This was delicious!  My tweaked version will definitely go into regular rotation.

I wish I would have listened to the other bad reviews. I made it exactly as listed. It was absolutely bland. No flavor at all and I even added a fresh jalapeño with the chiles. We took one bite and stared at each other with the "yuck" face. My husband and I still ate it but added a ton of salsa on top. My eight year old told me right away they were terrible and did not want to eat it. The only one who ate it with a little bit of enjoyment was my three year old. I thought I would try something new but only found disappointment.

I'm only reviewing the sauce, as I use the slow cooker cilantro lime chicken recipe from this site for the chicken. The sauce is very easy and very good. If your like me and love green chiles, I would suggest using two cans.

The sauce was excellent! My only changes were cooking the chicken with a bit of tomatillo green sauce, Badia complete seasoning and used flour tortillas-skipping the frying needed for corn tortillas. Added a bit more tomatillo sauce to the cheese, chicken mix, since mine was a little dry. Served on a bed of lettuce. We will be having this again soon.

This came out amazing! I was so nervous about the sauce because it looked funny but it tasted great I definitely did use more than 12 corn tortillas though and when I got done boiling the chicken I added some zatarans blackened seasoning and poured a little bit of the water I boiled the chicken in to keep it moist about 1/4 cup I also sauteed the onion in olive oil then mixed it in with the chicken. Would definitely make this again!

I made this for dinner the other night and used chicken I had left over from when I had cooked it in the crockpot. I used flour tortillas instead of corn ones to avoid having to cook the corn tortillas in the oil and because the flour hold together better. I followed the rest of the recipe and was skeptical how good it would turn out but my husband and I both loved it and especially with how easy and fast it was to make I will deff make it again. Also I used mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack because thats what I had.

Great recipe,easy to make and minimal ingredients. I recommend seasoning the chicken and saute the onions. It would have been too bland without salt,pepper,cumin,chili powder and garlic. I also seasoned the sauce mixture. I think it was even better the next day reheated in the toaster oven. Next time I make it I plan to do in advance. When it's my turn to cook for my boyfriend(a chef) I wonder how new recipes will work out. He thought it was awesome.

This was very good. As much as I hate people changing recipes I have to admit I did. Nothing too big though I just used flour tortillas because that is what I had and I added some cream cheese to the sauce as well. The end product was fantastic and I will make again for sure. Thanks!!!

This was very good, but the monterey jack cheese was a little bland for my tastes and a little too much cilantro for me.  Added sharp cheddar cheese and a little less cilantro, overall a good recipe!

very tasty!  Used a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  I added sauteed mushrooms and also sauteed the onions.  I also bought some green enchilada sauce (Frontera Grill brand - yum!) and added a little to the meat mixture and more on top of the white sauce.  Added cumin and garlic salt to the meat mixture too.  Made a few with shrimp instead of fish.  DE-lish.  Will def. make again!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Everyone loved it!  Doubled recipe & used 10" flour shells (hubby doesn't like corn), made 2 9x13 pans, 6 enchiladas per pan. Also added 4oz can of chilies to chicken filling.  Topped with shredded cheese after baking, turned oven off & left inside until salad was made & table was set.  Turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again.  (Wonder about subbing cream cheese for sour cream next time?  If I try it I'll update!)

These are pretty good but I felt like the sauce was missing something.  It was kind of bland.

Good sauce on top.  This is best if recipe is followed to a T. Second time I took some shortcuts (didn't fry tortillas) and it was good, but not as good as original recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  I used whole wheat flour torillas - personal preference.  The recipe doesn't state the size of the corn tortillas but I think they are usually about 6".  I didn't allow for the larger size of the tortillas I used so my filling was skimpy.  I didn't realize my miscalculation until too late to make adjustments.

This was wonderful. Thank you so very much for this recipe-- its a keeper! I ended up using a can of rotel instead of the green chilis, using half the can and the liquid from the can to mix in with the shredded chicken. Added some garlic to the chicken and the sauce, and used Colby/jack instead of all Monterrey Jack. This was a mild version with a hint of heat, not enough to make my 9 yr old run, in fact, she scarfed hers down!

Great recipe.  Only made some small changes to use what I had on hand.  I used pulled pork instead of chicken, flour tortillas instead of corn, and a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of green chiles.  I used an immersion blender  prior to adding the sour cream and the sauce was incredible!

We really liked this recipe!  I cooked the chicken breasts by poaching them in water mixed with chili powder, cumin and oregano.  This made them very moist and flavorful.  The sauce was great. When I poured it over the rolled enchiladas, I was worried that it was too watery, but it thickened up 'til it was just right while in the oven.  I especially enjoyed this because it reminded me of the Mexican food back home in Texas.  They don't do sour cream sauces here in South Carolina.

Surprisingly easy enchiladas. I added a little paprika to the chicken but these where a huge hit with my new husband. I get all my recipes from this site since I am learning how to cook. So thank you for this one.

This recipe was a home run!!  The only real change I made was in the assembly.  Instead of rolling them individually, I layered 6 softened tortillas, then the chicken, cheese, and remaining tortillas.  I poured the sauce over it and sprinkled with chopped red onion instead of putting the onion inside the mix.  This recipe is by far the best chicken enchilada recipe I have EVER tasted.  Better than my favorite Mexican restaurant.  It's that good!

These are very mild enchiladas.  The sour cream tones down the chiles a lot.  I followed the recipe.  They were very mild, but flavorful.  I had to add some hot sauce at the table.  Frying the corn flours made it a lot easier to roll and the flours didn't seem soggy after they were cooked.  Thank you.

Yum! I have used this recipe twice, the first time I stuck to it, and thought it was great but a bit mild for my tastes. The second try I varied and really liked the difference. I boiled the chicken in broth and a can of Rotel hoping to give the chicken more "bite," then I used the boiling broth mixture to make the sauce too. Also lightly cooked the onion,  adding a bell pepper and quite a bit of red pepper and some garlic too, turned out much spicier.

I'm giving this five stars because even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, it is versatile and allows for substitutions.  I used whole wheat tortillas (didn't put them in oil or anything to soften), had to use wheat flour for the roux (butter/flour mixture), added maybe 1/4 cup extra sour cream to the sauce, used a cheddar/monterry jack cheese mixture (all I had on hand) and added 1 tsp cumin, 3/4 Tbs chili powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp salt to the sauce.  Everybody enjoyed them - even my youngest who is our official enchilada-aholic.

I did my own twist on this basic recipe. I steamed the toritillas in the microwave to get pliable (saves fat & mess). I doubled the cilantro since my husband is a cilantro freek. Then I used fresh hungrian wax peppers from our garden instead of the canned. I used I can of green enchilada sauce and one can chicken broth for the sauce. I eliminated the flour and butter and added more cheese. I am eating it now yum. Can't wait for my husband to come home and try it!

My sis -- who lived in Santa Fe for years and is picky about green chile -- loved these.  Leftovers did not last long! We topped w/ plain yogurt and green chile salsa.  (Also, I just microwaved the tortillas a couple at a time for a few seconds to make them pliable enough to roll up...)

Very good with ground beef instead of chicken. I did add some garlic, salt, extra green chiles, and chile powder to the meat mixture for more flavor. Also used the juice from the green chiles as part of the broth for some extra spice. The sauce is delicious and easy. Although I used 2% plain yogurt instead of sour cream, it turned out great. Thank you!

Very good. However 4oz of chilies do not hot enchiladas make. Since other reviews said that this isn't very spicy, I took some tricks I use for Chicken Enchiladas V. I boiled the chicken breast in some chicken broth and shredded it. Then I sauted the onion in 1 Tbsp of butter and added the chicken as well as some taco seasoning (I didn't measure it, just enough to give each piece of chicken a little flavor). I mixed that all up and placed it in the tortillas, which I didn't fry, and added the cheese. I then made the sauce and added a little bit of the taco seasoning to the sauce as well. The end result was still very good. I guess if you are looking for something with more kick you can add what you want to either the chicken or the sauce, but i think this is supposed to be more of a cheesy kinda enchilada. I think next time I'm going to chop up some jalapeno rings and put it in with the onion and chicken. This will be made again!

I thought it was good, but pretty basic.  Even adding a little bit of cayenne wasn't enough.  I might make this again, but if I do, I'll add more cayenne and/or chopped jalapenos.

This recipe was great, and really pretty simple! I only made a few minor changes. I added salsa and Jalepenos to the filling, and added garlic salt and cumin to the sauce. Also, I would probably not use as much oil to soften up the tortillas as suggested, I think it was way too much, probably half that would be plenty so the tortillas don't fall apart. Also, we didn't have a big enough pan really to fit all the enchiladas, so it was more like a casserole, but I think with a bigger pan they would have been a tad more crispy.

This recipe was really great. The sauce was AMAZING! I thought it needed a little salt though. Next time I will probably add some taco seasoning to the chicken.

I thought these enchiladas were excellent, but my wife found them rather bland and said she would prefer that I not make them again. She likes things spicy, though, and if your tastebuds don't match you'll probably like this.

Very good. I added 1 minced clove of garlic to the butter when making the sauce. Was delicious.

Only 3 stars because it's a good base recipe.  I made the sauce as the recipe states and it was soooo bland!  So I added some cumin, garlic salt and salsa verde and then it was excellent!  I also don't fry the tortillas first, I use whole wheat low carb wraps.  So with the additions to the sauce it's definitely 5 stars!

This was really good, although when I make it again I believe I will double the sauce. What I really like about the make up of the recipe is the suace, and the fact it's not smothered in cheese or cheese sauce. It keeps the calories down. Thanks for the recipe!

From DBF; 'they were o'k.' I say, 'should I make them again?' he says, 'yeah make them again...' I guess they were pretty good, but probably not like a restaurant (he thinks if you pay someone to bring it to you it automatically tastes better!). I made this the day before and refrigerated until he got home, since I would be gone all weekend. Most of it was eaten come Monday, so it couldn't have been that bad. I used flour tortillas instead of corn, and fresh jalapenos from the garden. Other than that, all as stated.

Amazing recipe! I made these for my honey's birthday and we both loved them! Definitely a dinner we'll be doing again soon. It was quick and easy and totally worth the little bit of effor it took to put it all together. I used a lemon pepper seasoned rotisserie chicken like a previous reviewer and it was the best choice I could have made. Sauce was just thick enough and i added about a cup of it into the chicken and cheese mixture. Dinner was a complete success!!

Best chicken enchilada recipe so far (I have been on the hunt for the perfect one). I made some slight changes: saute 1/2 cup of white onion in the butter before adding the flour. Use 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup cream cheese. Add 1 tsp garlic and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to sauce and omit cilantro. Don't bother frying the tortillas. Just wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for about a minute to soften them. Makes prep easier, cleaner and faster with no loss of flavor in the recipe. Also, make sure to coat the bottom of the baking dish with a thin layer of sauce before putting the enchiladas in to keep them from burning on the bottom. This means that you need to make the sauce first but it works out great because you can be prepping other ingredients while its cooking.

This recipe is great! I added sour cream to the filling for the enchiladas as the other Reviewers have done. The only thing I really did different was that I saute'd the green chiles and onion before adding to the sour cream sauce. I also topped with sliced jalapeno for an extra kick. This recipe is defintely a keeper!

My personalizations: I used whole wheat tortillas and didn't soften before filling and they still came out wonderfully!  I did add 1/2 bag of frozen onion and red and green pepper strips (sauteed briefly to soften) to the chicken filling.  The sauce is AMAZING.  I didn't have all of the sour cream called for so I subsituted low fat cream cheese.  I also didn't have any chiles but I used some jalapeno slices from a jar and added a little of the liquid to the sauce for flavor.  It was perfect.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

YUMMY!  I also doctored it a little and added a bit of the sauce to the chicken mix, along with some corn and occasionally I will throw in half a can of refried beans to the mix.  A family favorite.

This recipe was delicious!!  I read the other comments and used less sour cream ~1/2 cup and substituted the remaining sour cream for cream cheese.  To the sauce I added chopped garlic, jalapenos,garlic salt and a little verde salsa, and paparika.  I also added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce, I am not sure I needed it, but I was afraid the sauce would have been to thin.  For cheese I used 1/2 monteray jack and 1/2 mozzarella. After baking topped with extra white onion.  It turned out wonderfully. Will definetly make again.

My two boys loved this dish. It was by far their best...so they said. I also made it for my aunt and her family. Made three pans and it was wiped out! The recipe was so easy. I got my 11 yr old cousin to make the sauce. Just layed out all the ingredients and measurements. He loved it! Said it was like the movie Ratatouille!

Instead of the misc. seasoning I used a Fajita seasoning.  I didn't put the cheese on the top until the very end, just to melt it.
It turned out great!

These were very good, but need some spicing up.  Using homemade chicken broth is key because of the flavor boost.  Next time I'll add some crushed red pepper and a bit of cumin.  I topped today's version with a fresh salsa containing lots of cilantro, tomatoes, lime juice, tomitillos, cumin, salt and pepper. Pretty darned tasty!

I made one change only because I didn't have green chilies instead I used the green Chilies with tomatoes. But it was a huge hit . The sauce we are going try with other dishes too! I will be making it again.

Even though I made a few tweaks to my personal liking, this recipe is easy and delicious! I added green enchilada sauce to the top rather than the sour cream mixture. I added the sour cream to the filling mixture. I used flour tortillas and I boiled my chicken in chicken broth seasoned with garlic and onion. YUM!

Such a delicious sauce! Used deli chicken and Queso Fresco instead of Monterey Jack because that was what I had. A really good and EASY dish to make. I'll be making this again for sure!

This is always a hit and I have people asking me to make it often.  You can add some cumin or hot sauce to pick up the heat.  The green chilis only add flavor, not heat.  

We used left over chicken for this recipe.  Never once have I made chicken just for this recipe, so this is a great way to use leftovers and kitchen staples for a new dish.

Used some organic green enchilada sauce instead of green chiles, stirred it  in with the sour cream. Also cooked the chicken in the sauce too, yum!

Was tasty. I sautéed onion till soft before adding to the chicken mixture. Only other minor change I made was to add a little cheddar to top and with chicken mixture. Liked this recipe. Have made one similar before and will use this one in future. Tip- use your stand mixer to shred your chicken with ease.

Very good! My husband and I loved it! We added more green chiles than it called for, also put some green chili on the inside as well as on the outside, and a bit more cheese. But overall this was very tasty. We'll make again!

I made this completely per the recipe and I was very disappointed. We found it very bland. We live in Texas and love enchiladas but this recipe won’t be in our rotation.

This was very good and easy.  I sliced and browned the onion before adding with chicken and cheese.  I also added more than 2 oz of cheese on top.

I followed the recipe exactly and these enchiladas were great! I like spicy food so I used “hot” Hatch green chilies.  I still considered them to be quite mild. Good recipe! 

Note:  I noticed some reviews saying the recipe makes too much sauce. I have to assume those people just did not allow the sauce to thicken enough. I let my sauce get nice and thick and I honestly think I could have used a little more sauce in the end.

Good change-up from my red sauce enchiladas, and was definitely well-received by hubby and picky 9  year-old daughter. I liked the ingredients, but changed up the directions.  I "crockpotted" 1 lb of well-seasoned chicken thighs. I made the sauce as indicated but it was too thick for my liking. I thinned it out w/a little milk and added some family-preferred spices to it (next time, I'll just reduce the flour to 1/8 cup). I sautéed my onions and diced chiles and added those to the shredded chicken in the crockpot. Once the sauce was done, I added a 1/2 cup of it to the chicken mixture and another 1/2 cup to the baking dish (no sticking that way). I rolled up my 8 flour tortillas with the chicken mixture, extra cheese, and then topped with the remaining sauce. Sprinkled some raw, diced onions as well as some extra diced chiles over the sauce and a final sprinkling of cheese (can you ever have enough cheese?) and baked uncovered for 20 min at 350°. Let them cool for 10 min after coming out of the oven, and had a delicious Friday night feast. Next time, I'll add some freshly-squeezed lime juice to the sauce, as I believe that will impart the flavor I was hoping for in the sauce.

Four stars as written. Had to jack it up for a 5-star rating. Read many reviews and had to comment about "too much sauce." Really? Someone once said, "if the gravy is good, there's never enough mashed potatoes."  Well, the same applies for these enchiladas--if the enchilada is good, there's never enough sauce!! These enchilada's were GREAT!. But I did add 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and a 50/50 mixture of green chiles/ diced jalepenos to the sauce. I also reduced ingredients for 4 (instead of 6) servings. I baked in a toaster oven for 40 minutes instead of 20. I did everything else as directed. Very tasty. The sauce made the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make this again. I  used this recipe and what I had in my cabinet so I didn't have to go to the store and it worked great!! Basically I already had cooked shredded chicken that was cooked in a can of green enchilada sauce so I followed the directions using the chicken i had and ended up having to sub half yogurt/half sour cream for the sour cream and everything turned out delicious!! My family had seconds and thirds!! I plan on making this a staple in our household… Not sure why some people  think there's too much sauce...we love the delicious sauce and We end up serving over rice anyway!! One thing i prefer is to microwave the tortillas in a wet paper towel instead of frying(lower calorie/less mess/not as soupy) The sauce is what is so good! I would recommend you try the recipe as stated if you happen to have all the ingredients on hand! But even if you need to stray a little-the recipe is so solid that it still turns out fantastic! This is probably going to end up in the weekly rotation!

I loved making this dish! I used soft burrito sized flour tortillas instead and I made 8 enchiladas (because I only had two chicken breasts). It was delicious and I will definitely be making this in the future!

This was very good. I used a small can of green enchilada sauce instead of the green chilis. I like a little bit more tanginess.

I made the sauce, but didn't really care for it, so I got some tomatillos and made a green salsa from them, pureed it and used it instead. It turned out very well and I will make this dish again for sure. The family loved it.

This was fabulous. My husband told me this one goes in the "favorites" box. Done.

I added spinach to mine, and I did use a mixture of cheeses as well, as I was trying to use up the bags already open in the frig:) but other than that I kept it the same. It was excellent. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a family staple. Grew up eating this and I continue to make it for my family. Can substitute ground beef for shredded chicken if you have that on hand. Just throw minced onion in ground beef as its about cooked, makes for one less step in assembly and gives the beef flavor. Those who complain about too much sauce- it  is an enchilada!! We love it and would not change a thing.

Sauce was a little soupy for my tastes but I may have not made it properly.  Will probably add a little more flour next time just to thicken it up. I boiled my chicken with some bouillon cubes and used the broth as directed. After shredding the chicken, I threw it in with my sauteed peppers and onions with a bit of sofrito just to kick it up a notch. Would definitely make again with a few changes!

Delicious! I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, but used 5 flour tortillas that I microwaved for 5 sec to warm. They almost filled a 13x9 pan that I lined with foil (good call -- less mess to clean). I didn't feel like opening a new sour cream for the small amount, so I used plain Greek yogurt, and it worked perfectly. I followed other suggestions offered by reviewer, Natalie (thank you!). I added a little garlic powder, cumin and paprika to the sauce. Before rolling the tortillas, I topped the ingredients with some of the sauce. I baked this at 350 for 30 min, adding the cheese topping 5 min prior to that. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again!

This dish was outstanding.  I did tweek it a little though.  I put an additional can of green chilies and 2 tablespoons of cilantro wrapped in with the chicken.  I used flower torillas instead of corn. I'm not a fan of the corn.  I also used less chicken broth so it wouldn't be soupy.  It was delicious!!

We got some baked enchiladas from a friend after our son was born and we used the sauce from this recipe to add some more pizazz to them. We used bouillon cubes instead of broth which made it a bit more chicken-y than we were expecting but some coriander and chile powder leveled it off nicely. Cut down the sour cream in the sauce by half and added quite a few frozen green chilies we had frozen from a local chile fest and a can of salsa style fire roasted tomatoes. Great consistency to the sauce and very tasty!

Delicious and simple!  I made minor adjustments to suit my family, like using ground pork instead of chicken and adding cumin and dried minced onion instead of raw onion to the cooking meat.  Hubby loved it!

Had no sour cream so I used a combination of cream and yogurt.   Added a 7 oz. can of peppers.  Added 2 tsp of Arizona Dreaming seasoning from Penzy's.  We wanted more spice.

Loved the recipe and was so easy to put together.  I did make an extra thing of the sour cream sauce to top after words.

I made this recipe on Cinco de Mayo. In the same meal, I also served chicken mole enchiladas. Even though mole sauce is much more complex, these enchiladas with creamy green salsa sauce were by far the bigger hit. No leftovers. Gotta love a recipe so easy and yet so yummy!

I didn't have the exact ingredients so there was some modification.  I did not have green chilies but I had green enchilada sauce so I used a bit on the bottom of the pan and abut 1-1/2 cups in place of chicken stock. I added water and some chicken bullion to the enchilada sauce to make it 2cups.  As others suggested, I added some hotel and garlic to the chicken. I also used Rotessorie chicken from Costco.  Delicious!!!!!! Lastly, I used pepper jack (it's all I  had).  Amazing!!!!

I thought this recipe was okay as is (really way too creamy and not nearly enough green chili flavor, and makes way too much sauce), but made the following changes based on other reviews to make it awesome:
Added 3/4c salsa verde to the sauce on top of the small can of green chilies and reduced the sour cream to 1/2c.
Seasoned the shredded chicken with 3/8tsp cumin, 1/4tsp garlic powder, and 1/8tsp pepper and salt each.
Baked the enchiladas on a bed of 2c cooked rice mixed with one (15oz) can of corn and roasted red peppers.
Poured 1/3 of the sauce directly onto the bed of rice, and the remaining sauce directly onto the rolled enchiladas.
Reduced overall cheese usage to about 8-10oz total instead of 12oz.

I have made multiple enchilada recipes but unfortunately have not turned out very good. I was pleasantly surprised when I made this recipe and they turned out delicious! I made a few adjustments for my tastebuds. I sautéed the onions and I added chopped spinach to the enchiladas (trying to get my veggies in). They turned out awesome! Very soft, creamy, I added remaining cheese and cooked it the entire 20 min. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

All I can Say;  Heavenly!!!  These were the BEST.  I will look no more for the perfect recipe for these....HINT---I cook my c.breast in the chicken broth and butter than add the flour to thicken.  This to me is easier and tastier...You just need to make these....!!!!

I made this recipe as written. This is my family's favorite chicken enchilada recipe. I like to add a little cumin to the chicken mixture. These enchiladas are good left over, especially if you make a little extra sauce.

I added some chili powder and black pepper to the sauce. Also, I sautéed the onions with the butter and cooked about 45 minutes.

These are amazing!  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and added 4 ounces of green chilies to the inside of the enchiladas and a sprinkle of adobe seasoning, but other than that, everything was the same.  We served it with Pica de Gallo (also from this site) and sour cream on top.  Amazing.  My boyfriend said it's in the top 5 dishes ever and we've been together 10 years. :)

I absolutely love this recipe. I never could get just the right flavor for my chicken enchiladas. I wanted a sour cream-chickeney flavor with a little bit of heat and this recipe delivers. The changes I make is that I simmer my chicken in herbs and spices and lots of chopped celery to get my broth. And when I roll the enchiladas, I add a little extra cheese, chopped roasted green chile and diced raw onion to the stuffing mixture. Leaving the onion raw results in a light sweet onion flavor and brings texture as well. Great recipe without changing a thing as well!

I thought these were great, and so did my enchilada-loving children. I made this pretty much exactly as written, as it was my first time ever making chicken enchiladas. I did make a few of the enchiladas with mushrooms instead of the chicken for myself, because I don't eat meat.  It was an excellent substitution, and I would highly recommend it to other vegetarians, as the mushrooms married beautifully with the slightly spicy cream sauce. 

I will definitely be making these again, so thank you for sharing this recipe, aaronspool!

This is a great recipe! I'll make it again and again.
The only change I made was to mix in some pepper jack cheese.
Can't wait to fix it for the family when they come over.

I am not of fan of green chile sauce, however, these enchiladas were wonderful!  I did not have enough sour cream.  I ended up cutting all ingredients for the sauce in half and I thought it made plenty of sauce.  Thank you for sharing.

The enchiladas in this recipe are great!! But it's the sauce that goes over them that take them to nirvana. I use the sauce for all kinds of things... burritos, chimichangas, you name it. It's simply delectable!! I change it up from time to time, maybe using jalapeños or a different cheese but it turns out to be culinary magic every time!

I lightened these up quite a bit by using reduced-fat cheeses (and slightly less of it, one 8 oz package) and reduced fat sour cream, and also by cooking the tortillas in simmering broth for a few seconds instead of frying them. For those concerned with that sort of thing, I would recommend 1/2 oz. chicken and 1/2 oz. cheese per enchilada. I used real butter and white whole-wheat flour. They were good this way, although next time I think I'll use 1/2 cup less broth in the sauce, since it was a little runny; I'm sure it was the reduced-fat sour cream. With these changes, I'd give this recipe 4 stars, which is still pretty good for a lightened-up recipe; as written, I'd expect it to be a five, and I also don't think it's fair to penalize a recipe for choices that I made. Thus, five stars it is! Thanks for the recipe!

I make my white enchiladas somewhat like this already but it was nice to have this recipe so that I can share with others since it's in my head and have nothing written down. 
Unfortunately, the sauce didn't thicken up for me so I tempered in a beaten egg into it just to be on the safe side. I had about a cup of tomatillo sauce left over from a previous meal, so I put a thin layer on the bottom of the pan before placing the rolled tortillas on top. After I poured the sauce over the enchiladas I drizzled the remainder of the tomatillo sauce -- it was a medium heat so it gave a nice zing with the white sauce. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time about a year ago, and it has been a big hit in our house ever since!  It is my husband's favorite meal and he brags about it to his friends (much to my delight :)).  Those who we have made it for have always asked for the recipe.  It really is delicious!  Also, the chilis are pretty mild so I use 2 cans.  Even then, it is not really spicy.  But that's good for us because we have 3 small children.  They love the enchiladas too!

Awesome. My husband absolutely flipped for these. First, I skipped pan-frying the tortillas and just heated them in a dry skillet to make them pliable (plus I was using flour tortillas because I sent hubby to the store without clear instructions :P). I think what helped make these such a success was that I rubbed my raw chicken down with cumin, lime-infused salt, garlic, and oregano and slapped on the George Foreman. Really added an extra punch of flavor. I also added plenty of garlic to the sauce. Yum. Thanks :)

My family loves this recipe. I sometimes use fresh jalepenos instead of the green chilis but either way it's fantastic. I also use flour tortillas sometimes, my kids seem to like the flour better.

We used homemade chicken stock.  We boiled the chicken with onion, tomato, a lot of spices then used that for the broth in the recipe.  We thought they still turned out a little bland (even with our super flavorful broth), but it is a very easy recipe to adapt next time. I think next time we will put a whole green chili in each enchilada before rolling.

Well, this was my first time having enchiladas that didn't use a "cream of soup" in the recipe(which I never liked). They were good but didn't have a whole lot of flavor-no more than the canned soup kind, but maybe that's what a chicken enchilada is supposed to taste like? I would've preferred some type of spices, zip, zing, something.

Good but perhaps lacked a little flavor, and I even doubled the green chiles.  Needed a kick, that it lacked.  Still great though, just not a repeat for us.

Wow!! This was amazing and my husband loved it!!  The only change I made was to moisten up the shredded chicken with some red enchilada sauce and i left out the garnishes.   This has been added to our meal rotation:)

I only made the enchilada sause but it was delish!  I used fresh green chiles from NM, and made the enchilada sause with veg bullion. I used it for some vegetarian enchiladas.  Wow, thanks for the great recipe!

Its in the oven right now!  I forgot to get broth at the store and had already drained the seasoned water from the chicken before I realized I was out...sooo....I used 1 can red enchilada sauce and 1 can water, it tastes good, and it smells great!  My husband doesnt like food with tomatoes in it, so a lot of the time he wouldnt eat enchiladas, this creamy sauce is perfect for us both!

This recipe was great, the only real cahnge I made was to saute the onions before adding them to the chicken mixture.  Next time I make it I will saute a chopped red pepper with the onions and maybe add some spinach into the mix too just to add some veggies and nutrients.  Thanks for a new keeper recipe.

Still unsure about this.  The onion in the filling gave a sweet taste, which I didn't like.  However, the sauce was a bit redeeming.  Sprinkled black olives and jalapenos on top after baking, along with the green onion.  I think it has potential but the filling needs more.

I had something similar to these years ago and really enjoyed them.  I have been searching for that recipe and this sounded pretty close.  I was real happy with the way they turned out.  I did add some fresh green chili's and a little salsa verde to the sauce.

I made these with both corn and flour tortillas.  I added a couple freshly chopped jalapenos; they came out so tasty!  I froze the excess sauce - just brought it out, and it's as amazing as it was fresh.

These enchiladas are tasty but nothing special.  There was too much onion for my liking, it seemed to really take over the flavor.  Next time I will add some other spices, probably some things others suggested, to give it more spice and flavor.  It's a good start it's just missing the kick!

This recipe was okay, there are some things that I'm going to try doing next time, like leaving out the flour and chicken broth and using cream of chicken soup in stead and combining different recipe.  If it turns out good I'll be posting the recipe.

These were good.  I would make a few modifications next time.  I would add a little of the sauce to the chicken mixture just to keep the filling from being so dry.  And I would use flour tortillas as I just don't have much luck rolling corn tortillas without them splitting.

Very good. I doubled the sauce and added jalapenos, garlic and black pepper to it. I seasoned the chicken and added spanish rice, and red peppers to the filling. I used flour tortillas. I did not fry them.... just popped them in the microwave for a few seconds between damp paper towels. Great as a starter recipe and excellent after being tweaked to our preferences. Hubby loved them.. it was his b-day dinner. Thanks so much!

My husband and I really enjoyed these! The only changes that we made were to just heat the tortillas in some sauce instead of frying them and to add green peppers to the chicken and onion mixture. The sauce was very good and I couldn't believe how easy it was to make! Great recipe :)

This recipe is very good...I made a few minor tweaks.  I sauteed the onion, green bell pepper, garlic, chicken and fresh salsa together.  I added spinach to the enchiladas.  All else was exactly as the recipe calls for.

This was a good recipe but it was typical enchilada recipe in that it was very labor intensive, and my kitchen was a mess by the time I had it in the oven. I made it just as written and would make it again except I would leave out the cilantro, we just don't like the flavor of cilantro. My four year old liked it very much except the green onions on top, but that was an easy fix. Thanks for the recipe.

This got raves at my dinner party.  I added more serranos, 8 total, and a bit more cilantro. Yummy!

I was making enchiladas and I wanted something different than the traditional "red" enchilada sauce.  I used the recipe for Charley's Slow Cooked Beef from this site.  I filled the tortillas with a mix of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and the "Mexi-meat" then placed them seam side down in a glass baking dish.  I made the sauce from this recipe, poured it over the enchiladas and threw some more cheese on top.  I baked it for 20 min at 350.  For the sauce, I used two cans of chiles and used a hand blender to make it creamier and no so chunky.  It came out sooooo yummy!!!

Very easy to follow and tasted really good.  My only suggestion, if you are from the Southwest, is to find use some hot green chile to give it some kick.

This meal is "Delicious."  I made cheese enchiladas instead of chicken.  I purchased American cheese from over the counter at a deli in a grocery store.  I filled the tortillas with cheese, cilantro and onions.  I didn't put the green onions on top at the end or the cilantro since I had already put cilantro in the tortillas.  Some of the best enchiladas I ever had.  I'll be making this meal for the rest of my life.
Thank you!

I made these for a dinner party my fiance and I were throwing at our house. They were a big hit. My fiance said that they were the best enchiladas he's ever had, and he's picky when it comes to food. I used a few spoons of cream cheese because someone ate half the sour cream out of our fridge and didn't mention it to me before I went shopping. So I used about 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup cream cheese. Delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe!

My husband's new favorite.  I used what I had on hand - mozzarella for the cheese and sliced pickled jalapenos in place of the green chiles.  Yes, the second substitution makes a significant flavor difference and they were spicy but we loved them.  Also, someone said it had a lot of sauce - it does, but if you take the time to let it thicken (5 minutes on my range over med to med-high heat) it will be fine.  It got thicker as it baked, too; because of that, they are a hearty meal.

Very good and simple to make, but the creamy sauce could use some seasoning. I think my fiance' added seasoning salt and pepper into it.

Excellent recipe. I have made this for several gathering and it's always a hit. My family loves garlic, so I've add lots more garlic and doubled the cumin.
