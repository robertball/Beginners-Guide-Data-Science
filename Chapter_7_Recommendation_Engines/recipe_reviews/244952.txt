I followed the recipe to the almost letter on the ingredients, only thing I had a small Chuck steak so I  added it to the crock pot with the neck bones and I didn't have allspice so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Turned out great, my husband has asked me to make it again as soon as possible. I served it over mashed potatoes, leftovers i served over rice,both delious.
