Wow!! Delicious salad! I couldn't stop eating it!! And it was so easy to make too! I had to substitute fresh spinach as the store was out of any even remotely decent kale, but it was still wonderful! I mixed the olive oil, lemon juice, salt (and added black pepper) to taste, and drizzled it all over everything at the end. I loved the combo of flavors here--salty, sweet, tangy, fresh, and just plain good! Thank you for the recipe--I will definitely be making this again!
