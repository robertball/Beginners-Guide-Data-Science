I made a few modifications: used whole kernal corn drained because I didn't have any cream style on hand. Also used the Roasted Garlic and Olive oil couscous so I didn't add any additional salt. The family ate it up and asked for more so next time I'll double the recipe.

This side dish is awesome. I may have added a little more cheese you can never have too much cheese but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

i love all of the ingredients separately it was fast and easy to make but i was not a fan of the texture--reminded me of elastic undercooked cream of wheat. it also doesn't look entirely appetizing. i can see why people might like it for comfort food if the texture doesn't bother them but i would not suggest using it for entertaining.

Followed directions but it tasted bland to us. Might make again but would add a lot more ingredients.

This really lives up to the name! The only thing I'm NOT crazy about is the instruction for cooking the couscous. I knew that it needed some more flavour - so I added 1/2 tsp dried thyme and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I will definately use this recipe again but plan on adding some roasted red bell pepper for a pop of colour. I used a ring mold for the presentation. This is restaurant worthy w/ the right seasonings!

Superb! I have never had couscous before but saw this recipe and thought why not give it a try? I did and it is wonderful and oh so easy to make...so much so my non-cooking daughter now makes it as her specialty. When my finicky children eat something strange and then ask for more it has to be good. Give it a try. I don't think you or your family will be disappointed.

Like the other reviewer I didn't really like the consistancy. Very easy and fast but not very good flavor. Maybe the brand of cream corn I used affected the outcome.

Originally when I read this recipe along with the reviews I was super excited to give it a try. All the ingredients in this recipe I love on their own. After following the recipe I was left with a gluey mass that ruined the light fluffy nature of the couscous. The flavors were bland and tasted like nothing more than a diluted version of cream corn. The color was yellow just yellow.... I will not make this again.

Three things my kids love all mixed together. I didn't have any shredded mozzarella so I cut up string cheese close enough right? The chunks of melted cheese we're good. Great side dish.

This was my first try for couscous so maybe not a fair review but I thought it would be alot better than it was.

This was pretty good. It was my first time trying couscous so did not know what to expect. I think it was a lot like a spoonbread.

I made this recipe for my husband 18 month old son and myself. My husband is very picky and would prefer to eat plain chicken and either a plain potatoe or corn EVERYDAY! He initially balked at the texture but only because he's never had couscous before. He really liked this and even got seconds! My son took one bite looked at me and said "yummy mama!" I'd definitley make this again. However it really needed salt and black pepper to be more flavorful.

I popped fresh parsley and garlic in the food processor and added that didn't have mozzarella so added some feta. I added the water to the couscous waited 5 mins and added the rest simple! My eldest daughter said it was the Best! I think I'll pop in some red pepper for colour next time.

I liked this dish. I served it cold. Next time I will use a little less butter and more pepper- it needed a little more seasoning but even my picky boyfriend had seconds.

The flavor of this dish was very similar to a favorite scalloped corn recipe that my kids love...only much easier to make! In the future I think I will add a bit of chopped onion and maybe switch to Swiss cheese rather than using the mozarella.

I read the reviews and decided to add garlic pepper seasoning salt and parsley. I also didn't have creamed corn so I just added frozen corn to the water while it boiled. It wonderful and we will definitely be adding this to the sides rotation!
