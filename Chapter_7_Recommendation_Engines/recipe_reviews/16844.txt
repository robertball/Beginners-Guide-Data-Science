I just made this soup, and it's great!  I used refried black beans, which makes the soup a darker color.  I really enjoyed the crunchy corn and the smooth taste of the soup.  This took about 10 minutes to make -- perfect for everyone!

I liked this recipie a lot, it was very easy to make.  I'm on a very short bugest write now, and haven't been able to go shopping in a while.  I put "refried beans" in the ingredient search, and came up with this.  Of course, I had all the ingredients.  I usually change ingredients in a recipe, but I didn't change a thing in this one!

Great recipe and a very tasty soup!  I used canned whole tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also added chopped fresh carrots, celery, one garlic clove and an onion instead of the dried onion and garlic powder.  I didn't have all the seasonings listed in the recipe, so I just used 1 T. of Italian "Mrs. Dash."  My family loved it!

Easy to make soup with a great flavor.  I used a can of Italian style peeled tomato's instead of the stewed.  Used frozen corn instead of canned.  Didn't drain the green beans but I think that I should have.  Came out a bit thin when I finished cooking it.  There just wasn't a whole lot to it (even though it tasted very good).  It needed something else (potatoes, carrots, rice, beans, noodles, etc).  I chose to throw in a can of white whole potatoes (I chopped them up some) and some chopped carrot.  My husband thinks that it could have used more onion.  Tasted great with cornbread.

It was a snap to make, but the texture was gritty.  My daughter and I did not care for it.  My hubby said it would be better w/meat and/or pasta added to it.

I've been trying to stay away from tomatoes, pasta, potatoes, and other things.  It's hard to find a soup without these things.  I left out the stewed tomatoes, and it was incredibly delicious! The refried bean soup base was amazing!  I used 2 cloves real garlic, instead of powder, and 1-2 Tbsp of lime juice to give it some zing, since I didn't have any tomatoes in it.  I shredded some white "melting cheese", (I think it's like a cheese used in Mexico), and crushed some tortilla chips on top of each poured bowl.  The two people in my family who ate this, went back for 4 times for more!

I was amazed at how good this is. And so super easy. I substituted the green beans for corn and added a can of green chile. I like to throw corn chips on top before serving. People are resistant at first but once they try it they love it!

This is the proverbial Rock Soup!  You can add just about anything to the basic soup and it will be delicious.  To make the soup more toddler friendly, I added cooked macaroni.  I also used frozen corn and green beans as well as fresh tomatos that I chopped in the food processor.  Start to finish was 15 minutes!!!  We will definitely have this again.  Thank you for sharing this great refried beans idea!

Well, I had cans of stuff to use up too :-) so I used kidney beans instead of green, and chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I usually like to rate as close to "as is" as possible, but this kind of recipe is just itching to be changed based on what's on hand.  I think any beans and beef broth would work just as well.  Good flavor, very easy to make.  I didn't cook it near that long, mostly long enough for the refried beans to cook down smooth, but I liked leaving it a bit soupy.

This was alright but don't go out of your way to make it.  If you have the ingredients on hand, go at it- it's good for cleaning out the pantry. But don't bother buying things special for this soup. It's a soup of convenience.

Loved it! Even my 7 yo wants me to make it again, and she's not big on veggies. I used Knorr veg stock and water instead of veg broth because I didn't have any, and frozen corn instead of canned, and it was amazing! I will definitely make again.

Not bad for a soup that uses all cans.  It makes a TON of soup, and it's almost chili/southwestern like.  I tossed in some chopped little smokies to use them up, and they worked fine, so I'm sure you could substitute easily in this.  I made it in the crock pot so we could have it for dinner without having to spend time cooking when we got home, and that worked well.  I served over rice the first night, although I'm not sure why, bc I ended up with a spanish rice type mix, which I don't really like.  I had it teh second night with bread and liked it well enough then.  I didn't think it needed noodles or rice to make it complete--it's filling as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the taste & ease of this recipe but unfortunately no one else in my family enjoyed it. The refried beans gave it a 'muddy' texture that everyone but me complained about. I honestly thought it made it hearty & satisfying. ...But because of the complainers I won't be able to serve this again:^

It feels good to use up some of the canned goods in my pantry!  However, I probably wouldn't make again.  Pretty bland and a bit gritty.  Thank you for sharing.

This was great! Though next time I will use less oregano, like half and more pepper. We topped it with cheese, scooped it with Mexican tostadas. Also I made it less soup-y and a bit more like a chili consistency. And used fresh green beans, onion, garlic and some celery. Will make again!

Great recipe.  Fast & easy.  I added some ground turkey sausage.   The refriedbeans were a great addition! The color is drab but didn’t stop me Friday m enjoying it. .  The soup is a bit salty for my taste.  Next time I’ll use low sodium canned veggies and broth and add salt to taste.   This recipe is also low in calories.   This recipe is a keeper!

Very good. Not a glamorous soup but good for everyday. Uses staples in a vegetarian pantry. Added a half onion chopped and navy beans instead of green beans. Quick and easy to make and easy to adjust ingredients according to what is in the pantry and refrigerator.

Loved the base of this soup! I added everything in the recipe but used real garlic instead of powdered. I also added  a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, canned chicken and macaroni. I used a little fiesta cheese on the soup as well. It was a big hit!
