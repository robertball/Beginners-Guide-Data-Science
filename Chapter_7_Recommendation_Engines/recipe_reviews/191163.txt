Oh, man!  These were so delicious, and simple too.  I had a houseful of kids over and needed a simple and quick snack.  This fit the bill, and I also like that it uses all oatmeal and no flour.  Considering how easy and fast it was, I figured if it was tasty at all it would be a keeper.  But when I bit into it--wow!  It was delicious!  It's now one of my favorite desserts.  The kids liked it too.  Very sweet and chewy.  I almost wish I didn't find this recipe, because I can see it contributing to the spread of my waistline!  These are the minor changes I made.  I doubled the recipe and added a pinch of salt and a little cinnamon. I omitted the almonds and put it in a well-greased 9"x13" pan and baked for about 25 minutes.  To make this recipe a little healthier, like for a breakfast bar, I might leave the chocolate chips off next time, throw in some raisins and perhaps substitute some honey for the brown sugar.  I could probably reduce the sugar to about 3/4 cup and it would still be plenty sweet.  (Edited to add:  If you find the bars too crumbly, boil the butter/sugar mixture for about a minute before adding the oatmeal.)

Yum these are great!  Yes a bit crumbly, but delicious.  I left out the almonds and subbed dried cranberries, you could put in almost anything and they would be great.

Not terrible but would I make this again? Ya but I think it would be better if some dried fruit or other nuts were added to it. Maybe try honey instead of brown sugar, so it doesn't crumble so easily.

What a tasty, simple recipe! I made it a bit healthier by substituting almond butter in place of regular butter and 1/4 cup cocoa mixed into to batter in place of the cocolate chips. I didn't need to boil the butter and sugar but just mixed them together.

These are so easy to make and easy to adapt to your own tastes.  To make it healthier I used half of the butter and half applesauce, less brown sugar and added honey, and I used less choc chips and added raisins.  I also threw in a little cocoa powder.  They turned out delicious!

These are delicious, and very easy.  I baked them in greased mini-muffin tins.  They did get quite hard and crumbly once cooled, but the crumbs made an awesome yogurt topping!  Instead of 2c oatmeal, I used 1 1/2c oatmeal, 1/4c coconut and 1/4c finely-chopped pecans and left out the almonds.

Fast, easy, and delicious. They are a bit crumbly, even if you boil the caramel mixture for a few minutes, but it's ok. Just be sure to cut into very small squares, since they're incredibly rich!

Good!! - actually more like a butterscotch candy with oatmeal than a cookie. I used walnuts (had them in the house) - and skipped the chips (didn't have them in the house).

very easy and good! I used agave syrup instead of sugar as it has a lower G.I. index. I may try adding shredded coconut next time and a dash of salt.

Really great bar. I made mine with cranberries and the combination was amazing. The first time I made it I only added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey - other reviewers mentioned how crumbly they came out. Even with the honey addition these tasted great but fell apart. This original recipe would be amazing in yogurt since its crunchy and crumbly. I compared this recipe with a chewy granola recipe I have and the second time I made it I decided to add 1/3 cup of honey and the brown sugar to hot melted butter. Mixed this together and then added about 1/4 cup, or less, of flour to the dry ingredients. This worked out well and they held together like a crunchy - slightly chewy granola bar.

Fabulous! It was so addicting, especially hot out of the oven . . . I didn't have almonds so I added one large banana to the brown sugar/butter mix before adding the oatmeal; it had a delicious, almost banana's foster-like, result. I also cut the amount of chocolate chips in half and substituted for about a tablespoon of nutella. Will absolutely make again!!!

These are very good, especially since they are so easy!  My 5 year old daughter loves helping me make them too.  We skip the almonds but do put chocolate and butterscotch chips on when out of the oven and they turn out great!

Thank you Laurasavvy! This recipe save my butt! I had decided to meet some friends and asked the question..."Do you need me to bring something?" I was to bring ice tea but my container ended up having a hole in it. I jumped on AR had just these items on hand. It wasn't pretty but, I am not a baker at all! Once everyone tasted it was a hit. I had one guy trying to take the pan home and vowed to mail it back just so he could eat what was left. Thank you so much and now I alway have an easy back up and I can remember this without having to print it.

OMG! This is heavenly! I couldn't wait until it cooled completely to devour a bit. It is safe to say that these oatmeal squares are equally delicious warm as well as cold.  I however did make a small modification. I added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.

Didn't have almonds so left them out -- I'm sure they would have been 4 star with almonds or any other nut (more like 3 stars lacking the nuts --very easy--will try them again)

I just wanted to say, I really like this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. After baking and cooling when I tried to cut, it crumbled apart in middle but tasted good. I took the crumbly stuff and put it in bowl and microwaved for a couple of minutes. I then pressed it into the bowl and up the sides. I put it in the freezer until hard. I took it out and broke it apart into big chunky pieces. It was super. It did not have the nice straight lines as if using a knife to cut. My family of 5 ate it up quickly.I will make this again. I will try pressing into pan after it cools a bit, then I will add chocolate. I will put in fridge to help harden it. I will use this recipe again.

I must be doing something wrong, tried this twice and it never firmed up. I used old fashioned oats, I will try quick oats next time. Broken pieces were awesome on top of ice cream though.

These were super easy to make with ingredients that are usually on hand and they tasted pretty yummy. The oatmeal is a bit crumbly and falls apart easily, but it's still worth it. Also, they are a bit on the sweet side.

It's hard to go wrong with butter, chocolate, and sugar... This is easy to make when you're fiending for cookies, but too lazy to make them! Definitely not healthy though :-)

A little sweet for me but my boys love them in their sack lunches. Very easy to make and easy to modify based on what I have in the cupboard w/ M&Ms, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, ground up Oreos, butterscotch chips etc. I add the extras after I've mixed the melted butter sugar mixture w/ the oatmeal so that they don't melt or fall apart.

I needed a quick snack for some of my hubby's co-workers.  I didn't have to go to the store and the guys loved them!!  I mixed the almonds with walnuts and they were gone in minutes!

This are amazing! A quick and easy dessert and crowd pleaser. I've made them multiple times for multiple events. I have used different types of nuts but I've also omitted the nuts becasue of friends with allergies. Coconut would also be delicious on top!! Or maybe even dried fruit.

A dash of salt, some ground cinnamon, and sub cinnamon chips for half of the chocolate to give these some flavor.  They are crumbly.  Next time I will add some dried fruit and sunflower seeds.

Very easy to make except for spreading the chocolate, I think next time I will pre-melt the chocolate and then just pour & spread it over the bars.  I cut back on the butter a bit and added dried cranberries, raisins, cinnamon and fresh orange juice, no almonds.  Didn't crisp up the way I expected it to, maybe due to the OJ I added.  Crumbled rather than stayed in bar form, but good flavor.

Liked this, added bit chopped walnuts and substituted 1/4 cup bran with 1/4 cup oats, added bit  of prune purée that I had on hand, made in muffin tin, sprayed with oil.  Came out easy, kids actually said less chocolate would be better.
Will do again but less per....made 9 in the muffin tray, better if they were bit smaller for kid size treat.

Easy and delicious. Seems more of a fudge with oatmeal mixed in than a typical oatmeal bar. Need to avoid overbaking as the edges can get dry and the squares can be hard to remove from the pan. Definitely worth trying again.
