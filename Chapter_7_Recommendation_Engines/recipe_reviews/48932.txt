I'm from Chicago but have moved away.  I love this recipe when I'm craving an Italian beef sandwich!  Mine is slightly different though.  I don't use water but a combination of beef broth and beer. I leave it in the slow cooker while I'm at work. When I get home it's perfect on a crusty italian roll with some mozzerella cheese!

Thank  you!  You should rename this one the ONLY REAL Italian Beef Sandwich Recipe!   We also moved away from the city of Chicago, and couldn't believe what they were passing off as "Beefs" in our new locale; shredded or loose meat with only a hint of seasoning, and carrots!  AAAGH! I came up with this method too after trial and error.I also use flavoring in the water added to the roasting pan, usually a little Worcestshire and a teaspoon of ready-to-use beef bouillon.  We  use a whole beef tenderloin, mostly for ease of slicing, so that we have enough for a big party or extra for the freezer.  My recipe calls for an herb/spice rub, with an eight cup each basil, oregano and parsley in dried form.  A dash or two of dried diced onion, crushed red pepper as  hot as  you like, and salt and pepper to taste.  Put on half of this before inserting the garlic and half after.  An easy way of doing the garlic is to make shallow scorings lengthwise down the tenderloin and then pat in minced garlic from a jar.  Sometimes we use a third to a half jar, depending on the size of the roast.  Proceed as you do with Dick's recipe, but with a whole tenderloin (sometimes called eye of round)  you might need longer for the larger size -- we usually leave it in the oven for 4 hours.  The first time we used the recipe, we put it in a roaster for a 70-person grad party, and it was the most requested entree, around 12 pounds completely gone right down to the gravy.
Hope the "tweaks" will help..Salute!

Thanks Dick!!!!!!! My hubby grew up in Chicago and I made these for him and he tells me every time that I make them (which is about once a week!) how happy he is that I found a recipe for ITALIAN BEEFS!!!! We live in Indianapolis so it's not to easy to just run up to Chicago to enjoy a treat like Italian Beefs! I love them, the kids love them and the hubby loves them! What little work goes into them is very well worth it! We serve them on crusty bread with banana peppers and provolone cheese! YUM!

This is like having an instant ticket to the Italian neighborhoods of Philly.  Do remember to add sauted onions and peppers to the au jus to pile on with the meat.  Cheese of your choice is also a must.  Enjoy!

This recipe rocks.  If you make this for your family you will automatically get bonus points towards mother (or father) of the year! SO delicious and really quite easy.  The hardest part is finding the right sized pan.  I'm going to use this for the holidays when I have a home full of family I am trying to feed quickly at lunch time.

When I started cooking this, my wife said, "I don't think I'm going to like that."

When I sliced the meat, she said, "That just looks awful."

When she tasted it, she said, "Oh, that's good."

When we had the leftovers, she said, "Wow, you can fix this anytine you want to."

Another All Recipes winner.

Okay, I just served this to 25 people at our church "college night".  Oh my gosh!  They absolutely loved it!  One man came up to me and said "This is the best thing I've ever had! I really mean it, this is the BEST thing I've ever had!"  Everyone loved it.  It's easy to make and soooo good.  I served it on hoagies with provolone, and green peppers and onions that I cooked in olive oil with the broth on the side.  You gotta try this one!
Update to review: I used this recipe to serve 60 people at a retreat. I didn't have the budget to buy roast so I substituted brisket.  I have to say, it's just as good and so much cheaper!  I trimmed all of the fat off that I could get off and then cooked it exactly the same.  EVERYONE that eats it absolutely loves it!

As homemade Chicago Style Italian Beef Sandwiches are concerned.  This is pretty darn good.  The trick is roasting the meat until rare and then cooling it down over night.  Far easier to slice paper thin.  The best beef i EVER tasted in my life was from a small ma and pa restaurant more than 35 years ago.  Mike's Restaurant on Irving Park Road and Sacramento in Chicago.  As good as Portillos and Al's Beef is, Mike's put them all to shame!

Ok well I didn't have the time (didn't plan ahead) so I took the meat frozen and stuck it in the crock pot with the water and seasonings (used garlic powder in place of fresh, in a hurry!) and let it go for a good 4-5 hours.  Sliced it as thin as possible and stuck it back in the juices for a bit.  It was absolutely incredible!  A bit on the salty side but will def make this again.  I can only imagine if this short cut method was sooo good that this original recipe is even better!  Will plan ahead next time and do it the "right way".  :)

(PS I too am from chicago and this def hit the spot!!!)

I made this recipe tonight and it was awesome. Like others, we moved from Chicago several years ago and the thing we miss the most are the beef sandwiches. No one else knows how to make them right. We finally got a Luke's here in AZ (another Chicago establishment) and theirs are the best anywheres near us. I couldn't get a rump roast as the store was running a B/O G/O sale and was out so I got a 3 Lb. Bottom round. I used a meat thermometer and roasted it just to 125 degrees and then covered and refrigerated it. Today I sharpened the heck out of my carving knife and sliced it as thinly as I could. This is with out a doubt as close to a Chicago beef as you could get at home. The meat was tender and seasoned well, served on crusty rolls with the Au jus, perfectly amazing! Thanks for this recipe Dick, we'll definitely be having this often.

amazing recipe.  I too used beef Stock (from carton or home made..not can---too-salty)  I posted another recipe to this So sorry, I thought it was my own tweek note to original recipe. i am new to this pro membership.I did add Basil ( 2t. dried) to the rub and  pinch of garlic powder plus 2t. Worcestershire sauce to juice  before roasting. This does work in a crock pot, but I like roasting first to give more flavor...then reheating in crock pot.  As others have said before me ROAST THE BEEF RARE FIRST  and then cooling in fridge is key to getting a nice thin slice.  Be sure to chill COMPLETELY .  This chef  KNOWS what he is doing (SO did Lorraine Pierce  so follow their cooking method(roasting) for the better results. Next time I might try adding dry red Italian wine ( maybe 1/2 cup or so) to the beef stock. Has anyone tried that way?

Made this again ( still did not add wine yet, as it is too good to mess with much. HOWEVER both times it came out too salty.  I was able to correct this. I caramelized  2 large onions in unsalted butter.  Then added 1 qt of UNsalted  beef STOCK from a carton (not broth)I brought this up to just under a boil, added about 8 or 9  fresh rosemary leaves,( stems removed)and simmered for 15 min. or so. THEN drained off the onions in a mesh strainer, (let drain 10 -15 min over a bowl)and added just the juice  to the other juices. If your beef juice is not too salty, then skip this step. OR do it if you want to have extra juice for other recipes.

This was DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!! I've tried sc Italian beef (by Maureen) and wasn't impressed, but this changed my mind about homemade Italian beefs! I followed Dick's directions to a T except for running short on time (and  b/c my grocer didn't have rump roast at 11 PM on New Year's day... a whole other story....). To compensate, I used a 4 lb. top round roast and, instead preping a day ahead, I roasted for 2 hrs. at 250 degrees (basting every 1/2 hr.), cooled in the pan, tightly covered w/ aluminum foil and let all sit in the fridge for ~6 hrs. Before my guests arrived, I sliced the meat VERY thin with a meat slicer (I borrowed one from my bf's parents but will be investing in one myself so I can make these often!). BE SURE TO COOK YOUR ROAST FOR 2 HRS. AT 250 as directed. This will ensure a rare roast. Before saying "yuck", let your sliced meat sit in it's juices and the redness will disappear (viola!). I never knew that true Italian beefs are served rare to med-rare (my bf read this on the WWW). Oh, I subbed 1 c. of low-sodium beef broth for the H2O (and used the remaining broth in step 2). My only complaint is the lack of juice. Next time, I'll use 2-3 cans of broth & adjust the seasonings proportionally, but still use a 4 lb. roast. Served with homemade giardiniera (by PHONETEK). If you are a true Chicagoan, the only way to eat Italian beef is with sweet peppers or hot giardiniera, juice (i.e. "wet") or no juice. No cheese in the Windy City :) Thx. for sharing!

These are wonderful.  I served with all sorts of different toppings.  3 different cheeses, tomatoes, lettuce, onions and peppers.  However my guests and my family decided that truly all this needs is crusty bread.  The meat and the au ju is perfect.  No extras or toppings needed.  Truly delicious just as it is.  Do not change or add a thing.

This was simply wonderful - gone in a flash.  I'd tried another Italian Beef recipe from this site that used Italian dressing packets and it had a weird, artificial taste and my son would not eat it but I thought I'd give this a try with it's more natural ingredients.  I was making calzones so had to cook on very low flame on stove top.  I sliced mine as thin as possible with a good knife and it worked out fine.  I have no intentions of buying a meat slicer.  I used a "spencer roast" which is pretty new to me but it's a form of chuck roast. I added a few jarred hot banana peppers with some juice.  The vinegar in the juice helps tenderize the meat. I also used beef broth instead of water.  I thickened the sauce slightly with a roue and served over meat and mashed potatoes.  I didn't want sandwiches in the same week with calzones. Try it - nice change from the sandwich and very good.  My son made a hot roast beef sandwich with the leftovers.  Great stuff. Thank you Dick!  My son's begging me to make it again this week.  Calzones are among his favorite foods, but this was all he can talk about.

This is a delicious and simple recipe with the perfect amount of seasoning/kick.  The leftovers held up well and continued to taste great a couple of days later.  Like other reviewers, I have had "the real thing" while living in Chicago and this recipe was just as good, if not better.

Rump roast has a great flavor but it can be very hard to chew, so cutting thin is the key.  I sliced the meat after resting, then placed the meat in the sauce and in the ref. for several hours.  My 10yrs twins asked to have their meat chopped and 13yrs asked for oions and bell peper cooked with hers. It's a winner.

I moved to NC from Chicago 12 years and am always looking for a beef recipe, I think I found it! Made this to take to a Bears/Packers Monday night party and EVERYONE loved it (the other ten people never tried Italian Beefs before). Hint: Slice the beef as thin as possible, I used my electric slicer and it worked great.

Goodness, this is a good recipe--super simple and oh, so easy. The ONLY thing I changed was the time I had to do it in. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that I needed to let the cooked roast chill overnight, so once it was finished roasting I put in the freezer for 3 hours. It seemed to work. The meat wasn't frozen, but it was well-chilled and easy to slice thin. FYI: for those who have sensitive tongues (like my Midwestern mother and mother-in-law), this recipe, as prepared, can be a tad spicy. I'm sure you could halve the amount of red pepper and it would still make tasty sandwiches. However, for the rest of us, it was spot-on!

Just made this the other day. Wow! Loved the crushed pepper in it. Gave it a nice kick. I put a roast in crockpot with all spices added on top. Slow cooked for 6 hours. Put in fridge overnight with liquid. Took it out next day to remove excess fat.  Sliced up beef very thin (a little messy) and put it back in dish and warmed up. Again, WOW! This will be the recipe of choice (and I have made many different versions of Italian Beef).  Thanks for the recipe!

Like everyone else raised in Chicago and no longer living there, I get such a taste for this sandwich from time to time.  Have tried many different recipes and this is one of the best.  Made just as directed, except that I just put minced garlic in the liquid instead of into the meat itself.  Just the right amount of seasoning and very tender beef.  Thanks much, Dick.  We will make this again!

My husband and I grew up in the Chicago area and miss the food....Italian beefs being one of those. I made this recipe and didn't have high expectations for it to taste like the "real" thing...but it did! The only thing I did differently is that after cooking it in the oven, I slow cooked it the next day...all day. The seasoning was spot on. I also added some mozzarella, dipped the bread in the juice, and added some giardiniera. We will be making this again. Delicious

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as directed. Rump roast, same spices, nothing added or taken away. I decided to have my first sandwhich with only the meat and no other toppings at all. I just might keep it that way because it was DELICIOUS! So flavorful, not tough or chewy at all! If it helps anyone, I used a glass cake pan (don't have a roasting pan), used a regular knife to cut it (it doesn't have to be perfectly sliced just as long as it's as thin as you can get it), cooked the meat in the au jus in the same glass pan until most of the red was gone and voila! VERY good and not much work.

Very Flavorful !  Live near Chicago but have not tasted the Real thing talked about in other reviews.  Used beef bouillon instead of water and omitted salt, also because of hot weather I used crock pot and it was both easy an  Perhaps the cut of roast makes a difference in how it slices, it does not require perfect slices to make delicious sandwiches !

IDK what I did wrong, if anything, but the meat was so incredibly tough and chewy.  The rest was very good, however.  Maybe I'll try again with a different cut of meat.

I made this as directed.  While the flavor was fantastic, just like Portillios, the meat was just too chewwy.  I don't own a meat slicer so cutting the meat really thin was a challenge.  I would use this recipe again with a different cut of meat like a top or bottom round and I would do it in a crock pot.

These are Italian Beef, Chicago style. And so delicious! Our family is originally from Chicago, and this is exactly how they're done in the Windy City. A note on slicing: if you don't have a deli slicer, you need to cut with a knife as thinly as possible. Roast-style chunks aren't ideal. Even if you get smaller, half-width flakes of meat it's best. You want the slices as close to paper thin as possible. Adding cheese? Not if you're going for authentic Chicago style. Just serve with plenty of au jus on the inside of the bread, almost soggy. And giardinara peppers to garnish. YUM!

Wonderful recipe! I did make a few changes though. I put the frozen roast straight into the crock pot, then poured the water, oregano, garlic cloves, salt, and peper over the top. (I left out the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any on hand). I let it cook for about 4 hours. Then took the meat out, sliced it up, and put it back in the crock pot with the juices and let it cook for another 2 hours. It turned out awesome! (Saved quite a few steps too!) Served on hoagie buns with pepperoncini peppers, this is definitely a 5 star recipe!!!!

This is the ultimate Italian Beef.  It is also the best recipe I have made from allrecipes.com!  Everyone who tries this falls in love with the flavor and tenderness of the beef.  Thank you, Dick Pierce, for sharing this with us.

I lived in Chicago most of my life and this recipe is right on.  For those who are adding cheese to their sandwich you are no longer having a Chicago beef but are instead having a Philly cheese steak.  Chicago beef sandwiches do not have cheese on them - they are served with hot or sweet peppers and that's all.

This is truly an amazing recipe for Chicago-style Italian beef!! The best for us.  Very true to the Chicago flavor, of course!! This is the flavor of Italian beefs I've been searching for.  The search is over.  Pretty easy as well.  Definitely use a meat slicer to slice very thin.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

If you like spicy than this is the recipe for you. I used a 4 pound top round roast and 2 cans of beef broth instead of water.The meat came out tender and the au jus was killer. Don't forget to dip your sandwich in the au jus cause thats what makes this recipe special. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

I had a 7 pound sirloin round roast and it worked great - roasted an extra 40 minutes.  We let it cool down, and then sliced some of it off for sandwiches before refrigeration.  (No time!)  They were great!  We'll try again tomorrow and see whether refrigerating overnight makes a big difference.

Made for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  Made a few changes: used bottom round, a can of beef broth, cooked for an extra hour since I do not like rare beef.  One note, I will add less red pepper flakes next time cause I had to dilute the drippings with extra broth to tone down the spicy broth for my grandson, although my husband and son loved it. Served with individual ciabatta rolls, roasted potatoes and tomato cucumber salad. Will definitely make again!!

These were incredible.  I have served them 3 times to rave reviews, even by gourmet friends.  The recipe is easy and wonderful without any changes!!!  Cooking the beef at the low temp and then letting it rest makes for a medium rare and tender slice of beef.  Use an electric knife for easy slicing.  Slice thin!!

This was good, but not the best that I have ever had. I thought that this recipe could have been enhanced by using beef broth instead of the water and also by placing onions and peppers on top. It is super easy to do this in a slow cooker. Thanks for the post.

very good recipe.  I just took mine out of the oven and it was wonderful.  There is no need to let chill.  Just make sure you have a good, sharp knife.  This was my first roast attempt and won't be the last.  Even though it didn't turn out as rare as I would have liked it, I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Very Very Good.  Omitted salt and replaced with garlic powder. Added the beef,mozzerella cheese and pepperchines. Used steak rolls brushed tops with olive oil for about two minutes till crisp.   These were awesome.  Thank you for the post.

This is very good! But, I think 1/2 pound of meat is excessive for one sandwich!  I was able to make more servings using this recipe, as written.

First attempt at making italian beef and considered it a success by family who enjoys italian beef.  Consulted with my great local meat market / deli (italian family owned) who makes their own italian beef .  Used bottom round roast per butcher's suggestion and great perk was that they will slice roast for you that you purchase from them at no charge.    Took cooked roast back after resting and cooling for only a few hours and it sliced beautifully.  My opinion was that 1 tablespoon of pepper flakes produced too much heat to be served to people that do not like heat and will cut back next time.  Also used the beef broth instead of water as per many suggestions.  Thanks to all who rated and commented and helped make my first attempt a hit!

When I come across this recipe As I flip through My Recipe Box, my mouth litteraly waters, EVERY time!  Rump roasts can sometimes be a little tough and flavorless, but not so in this recipe! I made Au Jus and then placed the meat on hoagie rolls, with Pepper Jack cheese and sliced it diagonally for dipping. Yummmm!

I didn't have packaged Italian dressing so I made the Italian Dressing from this site. Accidentally put all of it into the pot (1/2 cup) but it still turned out great. Will make again!

Awesome Italian Beefs!!!  My husband is from the Chicago area and introduced me to Portillos hot beefs.  Living in CA, we look forward to Portillos every time we visit family and friends.  I made this recipe exactly, and the beefs were excellent.  My husband and all of our friends that were over for Monday night football loved these beefs.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the Chicago Italian Beef you've been craving. I used to live near Buona Beef on Roosevelt Road and would feast on their drippy, delicious sandwiches. But that was years ago and I never get out that way anymore. I made this recipe, added sauteed peppers and onions, and served with homemade fries as the finishing touch. I am not ashamed to say that everyone gorged themselves, me included. As if recreating a favorite memory wasn't satisfying enough, it cost just a fraction of an equivalent restaurant meal. Now that's a thrill!

Mine was tough too! I don't think a knife slices it thin enough. Great taste so once I buy a meat slicer, I WILL be making again.

This recipe is delicious!  I just wish I had chosen a different cut of meat.  The rump roast was very tough even when cooked rare.  Very easy to make and tasteful!  We dipped slices in the hot au jus for just a few seconds and piled them onto  italian bread (as suggested) with provolone cheese, sliced raw onions, and fried mushrooms.

I made this recipe exactly as written, only halved it since my roast was smaller.  It turned out great!  It was spicier than I thought it would be, and my husband normally doesn't care for spicy foods, but he ate seconds.  I will definitely make again, only I'll probably reduce the crushed red pepper by half.  Possibly my crushed pepper is hotter than normal!

My parents had a recipe that was similar.  All kinds of spices.  No package mixes.  They had a few more spices.  We made it for family gatherings and parties.  Dad would take the cooked beef to a local meat store/butcher and they would slice it for him.  They usually used a really big rump roast.

Grew up on the south side of Chicago and really miss the beef sandwiches available there.  With that said, this recipe matches what I am used to.  The only change was I used a 1/2 tbl of crushed red pepper and a 1/2 tbl of celery seed.  I also added 3 cups of beef bullion to the au jus.  A few of the diners thought it was too hot even with my cut back, so next time I may reduce the red pepper further.

I made this just as the method suggested and I really think it gave the beef amazing flavor.  Next time I will try it with a top sirloin roast.  The rump was just too chewy even though I sliced it paper-thin.  I served it with my own giardenara and roasted marinaded green peppers.  Use a crusty french baguette and cut it to the size sandwich you are hungry for!

Just a little tip. Out of the ice box, put the cooked roast in the freezer for a half an hour to 1 hour, just to tighten it up more. NOW shave it with a sharp knife or slicer. It's just so much easier!

this recipe is really as close as I have ever had since moving from the Chicagoland area. I love it! I went out and bought Hot Giardiniera from a local sub shop (that tries to make an Italian Beef) just to add to this sandwich.  This was fantastic. Add a really great crusty Italian bread.  I don't have to click my heels and be "home"

This weekend we had a "SANDWICH WAR SHOWDOWN"!!  
Meet The competitors:  Italian Beef Sandwiches vs. The Munroe Melt.
Italian Beef Sandwich 3 stars
The Munroe Melt 5 stars.
Originally from Illinois, never tried this Chicago fan treat.  Both hubby and I "it's good" but was bland and needed more spunk.  Ended up adding melted muenster cheese, roasted green peppers and onions, plus chopped up Giardiniera.

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband really enjoyed it.  I thought it was okay. I honestly thought it needed more spices or something.  It thought, however, that it tasted much better the next day when I reheated it for lunch.

I made some of the suggested changes. I used a 2 lb. top round roast, browned it in the dutch oven, added 2 cups of beef broth, and two minced cloves of garlic. I baked it at 300 degrees for about 3 hours. Then I added 8 pepperoncini peppers and let it bake for another hour. When it was finished I shredded the beef for sandwiches. It was a hit with everyone.
