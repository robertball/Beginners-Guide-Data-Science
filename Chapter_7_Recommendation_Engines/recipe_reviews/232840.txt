I made these with whole wheat flour and again with gluten free flour.  Both turned out nicely.  It's easiest to roll the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper.  remove the top sheet, and pick up the paper to put directly on to the baking sheet.

I love how easy these biscuits are to prepare, and the recipe is easily adapted to one's taste.  These mix together fast and bake fast.  I find that it's not even necessary to roll out the dough, I can just pat it into shape and cut.  I like to pat into a circle and cut wedges, so they look a bit like scones, but any shape works.  I like these made with whole wheat flour, and I find they rise just fine with less baking powder (I can use 1 1/2 tablespoons for a double recipe).  I can also reduce the salt and thus the sodium.  True, these biscuits are more dense than ones made with butter, but these are healthier and easier to fix!  Thanks!

Very sturdy biscuit, not bad flavor but the baking powder taste is very prominent. Reminds me of my Grandma's Baking Powder Biscuits. Pairs well with sausage gravy.

My go-to, need biscuits in a hurry recipe. Today I made it with half whole-wheat, half white flour, and olive oil. Pre-baking, this made them a bit greasy to the touch, but coming out they slightly crispy on the outside, soft and a bit sweet on the inside.

While they aren't  the fluffy, flaky, buttery biscuit that I love, those biscuits take too much time when I have to whip something up for breakfast fast. This recipe makes a convienient amount and they still taste very good. My family loves them and I think they're the perfect size for a serving of biscuits and gravy. Thanks for sharing!

super easy and quick.  I misread and only used 1 tsp of baking soda but turned out great. But it is what it is a simple biscuit. I forgot to make bread in the morning and threw these together last min. it helped save dinner

This is a great recipe for "quick" biscuits, like it says. I substituted 2 tbls butter and 2.5 tbls real lard, instead of the vegetable oil. The taste was delicious and very fluffy inside.

Great recipe for quick last minute biscuits.  Ingredients are something nearly everyone has on hand.  I subbed in some bacon grease for oil.  It added a nice flavor.

This is a good recipe if you need to make biscuits in a hurry and youâ€™re willing to compromise on taste a little. They taste good, but buttermilk biscuits taste better.

It was super quick and easy. Made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used a round cutter instead of cutting them into squares.

I made these just as the recipe said. They came out perfect! The way to get a light, fluffy biscuit is to handle the dough very little.

Smelled great while in the oven, tasted even better! I did make a few changes, I used whole wheat flour, coconut oil and a bit less baking powder. Rolled em up in to 8 balls and baked for only 10 mins. Didn't have the density issue.  Will make again.
