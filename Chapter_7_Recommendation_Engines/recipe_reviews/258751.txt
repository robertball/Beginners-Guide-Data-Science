Had to make some slight modifications just to accommodate what I had on hand. just under 2 cups zucchini and added 1 cup shredded carrots. Traded the safflower oil for coconut. Turbindo sugar for light brown. Everything else remained the same. 
Completely defeating the purpose of making healthier muffins, but I think these would be absolutely amazing with a cream cheese glaze. Definitely will make again, even if the kids turned their noses up at em. More for me and the coworkers *mwahahaha*
