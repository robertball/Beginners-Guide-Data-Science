Delish!! I used uncooked shrimp, marinated in oil/lime juice mixture for a few hours, then wrapped with the bacon (I omitted the peppers b/c I forgot to pick-up at the store). Baked in the oven on a rack placed in a sheet pan lined with foil at 450 for 10-15 minutes. Once out of the oven and on a serving platter, juiced a half of a lime over all of them and sprinked with the chopped avocado. Will definitely be making again for parties, football games, etc!

Very good.  I made a large batch.  Instead of individually wrapping, I cut the bacon into small pieces and sauteed until done; drained; and then added a chopped jalepeno & chopped onion and cooked another 5 minutes.  Broiled the shrimp and then combined the shrimp & saute mixture and kept it warm in a slow cooker.  It was a hit at the party.

We have made these twice.  Easy to make and everyone loved them.  I used the George Foreman grill and it only took a few minutes.  We also made a lime butter to go with the shrimp because I overcooked them the first time.  Even overcooked these were eaten up.

I made this as an appetizer for my parent's anniversary dinner and they were ab-fab, darling! (Absolutely Fabulous). I loved the way the different flavors and textures meshed well together. This one's a keeper!

absolutely popping with flavor! It probably would have been perfect without the things I added, as the bacon gives such a great flavor against the lime juice. I added a few things only because I like playing with spices =). Added to marinade: a very small dash of cayenne powder, a dash of parsley, and a thin coating of melted butter. Very delicious, and got great raves from the family!

I made these for a work function and oddly was unable to find whole green chili peppers so I substituted jalapenos (mild) and this was a huge success.  We do this once a month at work and my co-workers are still talking about them.  Easy to make and taste fantastic...

This was very tasty, but the marinade for the  shrimp didn't seem to add all that much to either me or my husband. Lime wedges were a must as the lime flavor was wonderful with the shrimp and bacon, but not really prevalent with out an additional sprinkling. I will definitely be keeping this one and try marinading for longer/adding more lime.

Pretty time consuming and a bit hard to work with but the end results were very tasty. I didn't have any at the time but the avocado would have been a very nice addition. Next time!

Great addition to my BBQ seafood night, always a hit with this one! I used less olive oil and more lime juice, gives it that little extra punch!

My family RAVED over this.  Its now a favorite.  I only put a few peppers on some, and soaked the shrimp overnight.  I baked the bacon 11 minutes first, cooled, then wrapped.  Put on a reynolds wrapped metal pan (top and bottom)  and grilled. No mess, and great flavors.  Making it again tonight for company :-)  Thank you for the recipe!

I used apple smoked bacon instead of peppered and it was delicious! I will try peppered next time. I also added a little salsa verde to the marinade. Loved this dish!

I made this in the oven instead of the grill, I baked them for like 15 minutes and I also cooked the bacon for about a minute before wrapping the shrimp, I loved it!

I was in a time bind - so I crisped chopped bacon in a large skillet.  I removed the bacon and set it aside to drain in a paper towel lined colander.  After pouring out the excess bacon grease, I added the marinated shrimp and chili peppers to the same skillet (the liquid from the shrimp de-glazed the bacon drippings perfectly from the bottom of the skillet.)  DO NOT cook the shrimp for longer than 5 minutes, as this will make the shrimp tough and chewy.  Remove from skillet and toss with crisped bacon.  Plate your shrimp with lime wedges.

I tried this on the BBQ grill and WOW! It was delicious! I used the marinade on chicken and grilled that up too, makes for wonderful fajitas!
