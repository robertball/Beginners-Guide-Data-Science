Really yummy and flavorful! I sauteed the chicken in coconut oil instead of olive oil. I also used diced, dried apricots instead of the golden raisins which had a nice sweetness to balance the spicy. I am gluten free, so I didn't use Campbells soup (contains gluten), but used V8 Tomato or Amy's tomato soup works well too (also has more flavor than campbells). I'd put a little salt and pepper on the thighs before sauteeing. Also, serve with brown rice instead of white!

I hate chickpeas, Green peppers make me burp, and red,(Bermuda onions) belong on salads-NEVER cooked, and Campells tomato soup is meant to ONLY be enjoyed with a grilled cheese sandwich. ... . But this dish-- when put together defies all my rules! it was absolutely delicious and I will make it again. YUM.

This was surprisingly tasty!  The mix of cinnamon, almonds and curry is wonderfully fragrant, and overall, this was an easy, unique dish. I changed the recipe in the following ways:

* Used about 6 boneless chicken thighs and two breasts, each cut in about 3-4 inch pieces
* Used two peppers
* Added a bit more of each spice
* Omitted the raisins
* Put in one whole onion (one of my guests did not like onions)
* Put in cauliflower at the same time as the chickpeas.  Other veggies would probably taste good here too.

I agree with the other reviews that the stew was a bit thick, so I added another can of water as well. 

I will also add that this recipe doesn't necessarily look appetizing at first, but after letting it simmer, the chicken just melts into the sauce and it turns to be a nice stew.

I will definitely make this again.

This is tasty, I did not add raisins because I wasn't sure I'd like that, but now that I've tasted it, I may try sprinkling raisins on the finished dish.  I don't like soft mushy raisins!  I also added about 1/2 C. of water because the sauce was too thick.  I would like to add other veggies, and am searching moroccan recipes to see which ones to add.  Also, I used chicken breast chunks instead of thighs.  I will make again.

Excellent recipe.  I made a few alterations due to items I did not have and it came out great.  I used only 4 chicken thighs, and added a 28 ounce can of whole tomatoes (whirled in the blender first).  I also used peanuts instead of almonds, which was O.K.  I would have preferred the toasted almonds myself!

I was a little apprehensive when I read this recipe but I had some chicken I needed to use so I tried it.  I took the advice of one person who said she doubled the spices and this dish turned out to be amazing.  By amazing I mean it tasted like a restaurant dish!  It was so easy to fix.  I did add two other spices from another moroccan stew recipe:  1/4 tsp turmeric & 1 tsp ground dried ginger.  Yum!  I will definitely be making this again!

A keeper.  Delicious flavor.  Tender chicken.  I used 2/3 of a can of Progresso Creamy Tomato Basil soup, since I didn't have Campbell's on hand.  I served with rice, and then used the leftover sauce with tofu, veggies and rice for lunch the next day.

My boys (2 & 12) loved this recipe and so did I.  I was worried about the tomato soup taking over the flavor, but it didn't.  I used the low-sodium soup and left the raisins out (personal preference).  I also served it over rice because it wasnt quite soupy enough on its own.  Very easy and quick weeknight dinner.

I made the recipe as is with the following exceptions: omitted chickpeas and used regular raisins instead of golden (didn't have them on hand) and I rinsed out the can with some water. I can see why some reviewers mentioned that the spices can be doubled. But as is, it really is not too bad at all, especially if you are not a spice fan. Next time I make it, I will try to double the spices.

This was amazing!  Made bacon (crumbled on top at the end) and then used the grease to brown the chicken.  I can't wait to have this again.  The whole family enjoyed.

Fabulous!  After browning the chicken I added everything in step 2 in my pressure cooker for 25 mins.  After it cooled down I continued with step 3.  Wonderful recipe. Thanks for posting.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe! We've already made it twice. If you're a veggie lover, add a bit more green pepper. Great with a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream.

This was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have raisins so did without, and added a few fresh mushrooms I had on hand. Will most definitely make this often!

I gave this four starts due to its potential. I believe it needs salt and more curry powder added. I also would double the amount of raisins because I love the sweetness of them in this stew. The chickpeas were an excellent addition to this dish and really brought it together. I would make again, but be prepared to do some minor doctoring.

Lovely, easy recipe I made for dinner last night! Thank you. I added a couple of zucchinis and carrots I had in the fridge, along with a cup of chicken stock as I had a the extra veggies and more chicken than the recipe calls for. I also used the spice mix from the Lamb Tagine recipe posted on this site by BenevolentEmpress (try the recipe if you haven't done so as it's delicious!). I did everything in a cast iron pot on the stove top, brought it to the boil, then covered and put in the oven on 350 for about an hour and a half, stirring every so often. Threw in the chickpeas and raisins half an hour before serving.

Added some seasoned soy sauce, skipped the raisins, replace chickpeas with northern beans.  Added some water to the soup.  Used half a batch of cilantro.

This is SO good!! Each year for Christmas Eve I make each family member whatever they want for dinner - it's made for some interesting combinations!  My husband is French Canadian and ALWAYS asks for Tourtierre, but this year, after having tasted this, this is what he wants! I changed it a little because that's what I do, but they were minor changes - so so so good and so different!

I've made this recipe several times now and it is wonderful.  I doubled the raisins, almonds, curry & cinnamon.  I used sliced almonds rather than slivered and used 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup.  Also used 1 green and 1 red pepper.  
I cannot say enough good things about this recipe - it is devinely yummy.

NOTE: I changed this drastically but it is a delicious base and starting off point for so many great meals! Here's what I did: Browned chicken thighs with salt & pepper, set aside as instructed. I added chunky diced potatoes and thick sliced carrots to the pot along with the garlic. Sauteed about 5-8 minutes to give them a head start on the cooking. I then added the onions and green peppers with the cinnamon and curry powder (I did add more of these spices to suit the added vegetables). Added Amy's brand cream of tomato soup and a couple of splashes of chicken broth as it did look a little thick for my tastes. Gave it a taste, added a little salt to taste, put chicken back and let cook for 25 minutes. Rave reviews all around my house. Did not add garbanzos, raisins or almonds, it just didn't seem to need them! I loved the combination of curry and cinnamon, thank you for this recipe!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was really good! The only thing I will change next time is I will double the seasonings. It was slightly bland, but had a wonderful aroma and the chicken was perfect. Definitely don't leave out the raisins- they make the stew that much better. I also used Muir Glen's organic tomato soup instead of Campbells. It's tastier and healthier :) will be making this again for sure!

I've got this simmering in my crockpot right now! It smells delicious and the "tastings" I've done throughout the day were fabulous!  I didn't read the reviews before making it and tweaked it a bit. After reading the reviews my tweaks were on par with everyone else.  I used more spices and added turmeric, used chicken breasts and one onion since.  I also added 1/2 can of water and have brown rice on the stove now.  Next time I might add cauliflower or butternut squash, or possibly a potato  of some sort and since my family doesn't like chickpeas, I'll use 1/2 a can (I love them!)  I'm definitely making this one again!

Even though I dislike cooking with prepared soup, I wanted to try this recipe because I had most of the ingredients.  I used dried apricots and cashews, instead of raisins and almonds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I felt it needed a bit more kick, so added a little cayenne and white pepper at the end.  A sprinkle of cilantro helped provide contrast.  Easy and good.  Paired it with couscous.

This turned out very well, I used cubed pork tenderlion instead of chicken and it was a hit. I would add  1 cup beef boullion to make it juicier , served it over saffron rice, awesome.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe! I doubled it so that he could have it on nights when I'm not home to cook. He is Mr. I-must-have-variety but he wants to eat it on consecutive nights!!

Just made this tonight with just a few changes: used Tomato Bisque Campbell soup, added some tumeric and ginger powder to the cooking chicken, and used potatoes and zucchini instead of chickpeas (I personally like that better than chickpeas). I doubled the soup and the spices to have more sauce for my coconut jasmine rice. GREAT tasting meal, will definitely be made again!

I was reluctant to try this because of the Campbell soup. No qualms now!  It was absolutely delicious as written.  The grocery store didn't have red onions so I substituted yellow.  The sauce was so yummy my husband wants me to double it next time so there is more for the rice.

Great recipe, I added 1 can of stewed cut up tomato’s and 1/2 teaspoon extra curry powder.  Then added a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper to give it a little kick.  The family loved it, said it was the best chicken dish they ever had.  Lastly added 1/2 cup chicken stock.   It was great!

I would make this again without the chicken. Also, instead of tomato soup, I just used diced tomatoes.

Saw this recipe in a magazine and knew it would make a quick, easy, cold night comfort food!!  Used chicken breasts, doubled the spices, switched vidalia for red onions, and only had regular raisins, but stayed pretty much on track otherwise.  Served over rice... Mmmmmmm!!

This was really good. My hubby thought there was too much cinnamon and not enough garlic but the rest of us loved it. I left out the raisins because we didn't have any but it didn't need it. My 2 year old (picky!) gave two thumbs up and an empty bowl. It did need more liquid so I added canned tomatoes.

This was so good!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into large chunks because that is what I had.  I didn't have the tomato soup either, so I used a can of tomato sauce.  The raisins & almonds were so good!  I let it simmer for about an hour on low because we were having dinner a little later & it tasted great!  Will make this often :)

This was awesome! I was worried about whether or not everyone would like it because it had curry, but everyone raved about how great it was.  I added a little extra curry and cinnamon and added an extra can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.  Also, I wasn't sure about whether or not I was supposed to add water with the soup, but I went ahead and added 1 can of milk to make it more soupy (I actually used Almond milk because that's what I had on hand).

OMG this recipe is amazing!  I added a bit of ginger and cumin because I had it and others had suggested it.  I also added some cayenne pepper to give it the heat that I love and my own personal spin.  It is delish, so go on and try it!

This turned out great! I paired it with some rice pilaf and crusty bread and it was a HUGE hit with my book club. The servings might be a little off - - this recipe fed five of us with a couple servings left over.

I like this recipe a lot! I'm a big fan of all things curry though in general. The few small things I did different were I added salt,pepper,garlic powder, onion powder, and coriander to the chicken while it cooked. I also serve this over rice.

This is a great tasting stew.  Tastes like something you would order at an Indian restaurant.  The only addition I made was to add some chicken stock, about 1 cup, for some flavor, then I let it reduce down to thicken.  Hubby loved it!

I enjoyed this dish quite a bit.  Like other reviewers I used dried apricots instead of raisons.  I added tumeric and cumin when cooking the chicken and chilli powder to the soup mixture to give it that added kick.

Excellent! I gave it a few tweaks... I marinated the chicken in a bit of olive + sesame oil, salt and Ras El Hanout, a typical Moroccan blend of spices (recipe available on many websites). Besides, I made my own tomato soup and cooked the chickpeas myself (they are not available in cans in Brazil). The rest of the recipe was pretty much the same as the original spelled. The result was fantastic, super fragrant and tasty. Definitely worth trying.

MmMmmmm....This was very good! I did everything as written only I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before adding it to the curry/cinnamon vegi mix. I also only used about 3/4 of the amount of curry, simply because I ran out! It was still fantastic! Thanks Campbells!

I wouldn't call this a stew, but more of chicken with sauce because of the thickness.  I used cubed chicken thighs & I doubled the spices after reading the other reviews & was very happy I did.  Omitted onion and cut garlic in half due to preference. My husband thought this was great, as did I.  I think you could even add mushrooms or water chestnuts.  Edited to add: I made this a 2nd time and added 1/2 cup water because my sauce was too thick & I also used regular raisins as that was all I had on hand and it was just as great.  A keeper due to ease & taste!  I could see also adding more water to make this saucier & serving over rice.

It is kind of bland. I added some salt and pepper and it was better. I think coconut milk would be a nice addition.

The whole family loved it.  As suggested, I doubled the garlic and all of the spices plus addes 1/2 tsp. tumeric and a tiny bit of saffron.  I added about 1/2 cup of water as well to be sure the sauce wasn't too thick.  Will definitely make again with these same modifications.

Delicious - I'll definitely make this again.
I served it over Moroccan Couscous, and sprinkled with pomegranite seeds and cilantro.
Also, I didn't have condensed tomato soup, so I mixed some tomato sauce and regular soup (made from bouillon powder).

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a couple changes.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast rather than the skinless,boneless chicken thighs.  Also, I added two cans of chicken broth (used the tomato soup can) because it seemed too thick without some extra liquid.

This worked out really well.  I used a whole chicken, cut up, and also added some chopped up dried apricots.  The flavours were delicious and the smell cooking was great too.  My two toddlers gobbled it up!

this was delicious.  I made it as close to the recipes as possible with what I had.  I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into cubes instead of thighs and chopped almonds.  I also found I needed a little more liquid so I added about 1/3 of a can of water.  We loved it, served it with brown rice.  I will definitely be saving this one for the future.  It's a lovely, fragrant, flavourful dish that takes no time to prepare.

I followed other reviewers by almost doubling the spices.  It was bland, so I followed other reviewers again by adding turmeric and ginger.  Still it didn't taste very good.  Definitely will not make again.  I gave it two stars only because it was edible.

Very good, but the next time I make this dish I will make a few changes: 1) I will add more spices. Both my husband and I agreed that it could be spicier (but that is personal preference, not everybody likes their meals spicy hot. 2) I will add more raisins. The raisins really added a nice flavor! 3) I only used one onion and I think that was enough. I also served it over rice which was great!

Awesome flavors!! I added fresh tomatoes, used chicken breast and subbed Pacific Foods Tomato and Red Pepper soup for the condensed soup. LOVED it!! the flavors blend beautifully. Hubby couldn't stop raving.
