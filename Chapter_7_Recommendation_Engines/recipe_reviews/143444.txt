A few comments on the preparation. Fry the rice and ham in the oil and soy sauce to give it some texture and flavor, then add veggies and egg!! If you add green onions at the beginning, they will be nondescript green mush when served. Add them just before removing from heat. Also, if you cook the eggs beforehand as an "omelette", you can roll up and cut into nice little strips to add at the end. Otherwise eggs just clump and make dish heavy.

Very good. I didn't have green onions so I used a little red onion, also added a couple garlic cloves. I liked it!

Made this for lunch using some leftovers so I changed the way I cooked it. I used leftover cooked white rice and ham from christmas. I put that in my tupperware dish added some of the frozen peas and carrots (still frozen) and some chopped green onion with a splash of soy sauce. I microwaved one egg and chopped it up and added it to the tupperware. Great lunch and so easy to make!!!

very good recipe my family loved it even my picky 4 year old!   We did leave out the sprouts just because nobody in the family likes them! We made this with sweet and sour pork.  It was an excellent combination!  Thank you for sharing

Cut oil in half & 1/4 c. chicken broth to keep egg moist; used only 1/2 t. salt since ham and soy sauce has so much sodium. Otherwise followed directions. Very good!

Not bad, I used vegetables instead of the ham. I don't care for ham.  I will stick with my own veggie fried rice dish. Thanks for sharing though!

This was okay but nothing spectacular. I don't think I cared for the bean sprouts. Also it had to many veggies, not enough rice flavor. Thanks anyway.

To save a step, I used Uncle Ben’s Original Ready Rice. Don’t like peas and carrots, so I added extra bean sprouts. Delicious

Added extra cup of ham, Mongolian fire oil, fresh baby carrots that I chopped and added just before the rice so they kept their crispness. Whole family enjoyed it.

Delicious, I did not add the salt, Ham was salty enough.I did not have green onion, used white onion. Did not take away from the flavour.
Will make again.
Thank you for the recipe.

Quite a bit of pepper for my daughter. Didn't have sprouts or frozen carrots so used some finely chopped fresh carrots, brown rice, and yellow onion in place of green. Definitely would make again and super easy. I also used my rice maker!

Super easy. I used Sesame Oil to fry and followed the recommendation to add eggs (already omlette-ified) and the green onions at the end. Turned out great! Receptor is added into the rotation!

Next time we make it  I want to leave the carrots out. Definitely do not cook egg alone. It tastes so good when all the vegetables are in little chopped up pieces of egg.

Absolutely loved it! It's a meal on its own! I didn't use the bean sprouts, used frozen corn with the carrots and peas step instead!

it was delicious!  I didn't use any soy sauce.. I just used a little bit of garlic powder and it tasted great! This is also good when you warm up some tortillas and wrap the first rice in that!
