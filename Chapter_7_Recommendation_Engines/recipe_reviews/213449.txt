I was a little skeptical about this recipe for starters because I've never cooked with alligator. Also I thought V-8 juice cinnamon and ginger were odd indgredients for chili but I believe if you are going to use a recipe you should try to make it as exact as possible on the first try and then change it if you think it needs it. I put the cinnamon in with a wince on my face but I have to say I liked the final flavor quite a bit and it smelled devine. The only things I did differently was that the store didn't have ground alligator but frozen slabs in packs so I had to chop it up after thawing in the refrigerator overnight. Also I don't see any reason to cook canned beans for three hours so I added those in the last 30 minutes. Probably most important I cooked it with the lid off. When you have this many spices the evaporation process is what causes the melding of flavors that you want. You would just need to add some water but I didn't find I needed any. The most important reason to cook it with the lid off though is that you don't want to confine that smell. The main reason I am not giving five stars is not the recipe itself but that I'm not sure I like the taste of alligator that much. It's not bad at all just not special enough to justify the price which was 9 a pound. And it doesn't taste like chicken. I saw another reviewer compared it to rattlesnake meat. I've never had rattlesnake but this is what I would imagine it would taste like.

As a vegetarian I was impressed with this recipe because I could easily substitute extra beans (cannellini and black beans) and vegetables for the alligator meat (I hate soy and won't use it!). This recipe has lots of beans and spices so it's a great basic chili recipe. I especially like the spice blend because I detest premade chili powder. I use coriander/fresh cillantro leaves as a garnish along with some sour cream cheddar cheese and sliced green onions. (In case you're interested I use corn (Green Giant Peaches and Cream ONLY (frozen or canned) diced carrots onions mixed sweet peppers and sometimes peas and broccoli pieces (love the stems peeled and diced!) in my chili.) Bon appetit!

I was in a hurry so just used a packet of the powder 'chili seasoning' from the store- which worked fine! I also put in crock pot! It made the house smell great - My favorite part is the green pepper. Very good Thank you!

This was awesome the only thing I didn't do was add the chopped chili in the adobo sauce because I didn't have it! I also couldn't get ground gator so i used just tenderized gator meat kinda like chicken breasts. I chopped it up small and the chili turned out perfect! Everyone loved it Thanks Doug!

This was pretty good chile. I only used 1 pound of the alligator as it is very expensive here on the west coast. For myself I would leave out the cinnamon next time. My adult daughter who generally won't eat anything that isn't frozen premade or heated out of a can did enjoy this even after I told her the main ingredient. To my taste alligator is similar to rattlesnake rather than chicken.

Awesome Doug! I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes in place of crushed because that's what was on hand. Served it at "Wild Game Day" - not a single bit left!!! We'll do this again for sure!

The local Kroger didn't have alligator meat (not a lot of them in Kentucky...) so I used chicken. GOOD stuff in spite of having to switch the primary ingredient!! The seasonings are exeptionally well balanced -- just enough heat without interfering with great flavor. This is a keeper!

I like this recipe. I had to make room for another gator I tagged so I found this recipe while looking for something new to try for tailgaiting The World's Largest Cocktail Party. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of two things. First the gator I used was wild so I had to manually chop it into bite sized pieces. Second I didn't have any celery salt so I omitted that from the recipe. GREAT aroma (cinnamon and ginger) and not the sweet taste I assumed from reading the ingredients. Nice flavor and a fair compromise on the spice factor -- not too spicy for the children (7 & 13) without leaving me begging for more. I would recommend doubling the recipe if serving more than 5.

I live in Florida and gator hunt ever year. Crazy I had to find a guy in New Jersey to give me a good Gator Chili recipe lol!!! I added a few other seasonings but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I also used half spicy V8 and Half regular also add some pepper flakes. I like my chili spicy. Next time I will mess around a bit more but 5 stars for sure!!!! Gumbo is next week!!!

This is an excellent recipe (though I don't think the picture does it justice). Like Doug I use a online company (lacrawfish.com) and I am also from his neck of the woods (Morristown NJ). I get alligator tenderloin (tail) rather than ground gator. It takes well to a rough chop and provides a bit of texture. As he mentions in the video I use a mix of red and yellow peppers rather than the green. I'm making it to enter in our ninth annual Super Bowl Chili Cook-off. Having made the recipe verbatim before it is very spicy. Perfect for those of us who love a lot of heat but not ideal for those who don't gravitate to all things picante. Thanks Doug!
