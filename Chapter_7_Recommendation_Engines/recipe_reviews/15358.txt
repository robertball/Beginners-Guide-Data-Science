This fragrant dish, redolent with garlic and ginger was certainly scaled down to "American" tastes. I prepared it verbatum but I will make the following adjustments next time: more fresh ginger (perhaps 1/2 squeezed for the juice)no chili powder but the addition of hot red pepper flakes (we like our food stompin')I cut up the chicked to permeat the meat more thoroughly. A bit of asian red vinegar seems a fair addition too. As is, this is a fine dish for the average palate. Zipping it up with additional vavoom is our option! Thanks Michelle. This was a terrific recipe with a complex and satisfying pan sauce for the addition to rice.

The marinade for this chicken was awesome! It smelled so good I could hardly wait for the chicken to get done. It didn't cook like the recipe says. I had to turn the oven down after the first half hour and cook it longer because the chicken was getting very brown. I will definitely use this recipe again. I will probably use the marinade for other meats and cook them on the grill.

I didn't change much with this recipe, except omit the chili powder and chili sauce. My kids don't tolerate hot in their food. I did marinate it overnight, which I believe was what made it taste so good. I had to cook it for longer than specified, as I did have a little bigger chicken. Really, really tasty. I paired it with a cold sesame noodle recipe I also got from this site. Super moist and really flavorful. I saved the juice from this chicken as well as the remaining meat to use in a fried rice recipe later this week. My husband was impressed. Way to go, Michelle! You rock.

This is the best chicken recipe ever! I substituted the chiles (both sauce and spice) with a little bit of cayenne pepper. And I put chicken broth instead of oyster sauce (I put allot of concentrate for the broth to make it dark and tasty!). 

Just alone the chicken makes me think a little of sish taouk chicken! It's that good! I just prepared 3 chicken breasts and me and my family can't wait until tomorrow to eat it!

I'm sorry Michelle but this recipe did not work for me. My chicken was a little bigger, 5 pounds instead of 4 so I allotted an extra 20 minutes onto the cooking time and prepared the rest of the dinner, set the table etc. At the end of the time the chicken nice and brown (A little too brown) on the outside but the inside was still not cooked...so I threw it into the microwave and could tell that wasn't going to work either, so now it is late and I had to put everything away while I put the chicken in at a lower temperature. I'm a little dissapointed I guess, sorry.

This recipe was really great!  I used a 7 lb. chicken and marinated it for 5 hours which wasn't long enough. The flavor was there only mild. I also had to turn down the oven.  My chicken looked burnt, even though it was only the onions on top which carmelized.  I'll definitely try this recipe again and marinate it overnight. I'll also just bake it the usual way.  By the way, the kids loved it!!!

This is a great recipe.  Made it tonight for supper, it is really moist, but needs a little bit more flavoring.

Overall really good. I didn't marinate long enough so I didn't get the full flavour. Although there was enough left over for the next day, so I broke the chicken into pieces added some veggies poured the remaining stock over all. I baked that in the oven for 40 min and wow yum! I served it over the left over rice from the first meal...even better than day one. I will increase all spices next time. Thank-you Michelle.

Very good recipe. I used 1 teaspoon of the chile sauce instead of 1 tablespoon thinking it would add too much heat. I liked the results but I could have probably used the full tablespoon. I did have to add water (chicken broth would work) to the pan while roasting otherwise the sauce would have burned. I then strained the sauce added a cornstarch mixture and thickened it to serve with the chicken and some jasmine rice. Yummy!

Thank you Michelle! I normally change a few things with most recipes but not this one. My husband asks for this at least twice a month and it's so easy I'm always happy to make it!

The chicken turned out well.  The brown color of the marinade made the chicken a nice brown color.  I added a few things to the sauce like sesame oil, cilantro, pepper flakes and chunks of carrot and celery.  The end product did not seem to taste Asian to me.   It tasted more like a version of Grandma's chicken.  Very good, but not what I was expecting.

This was really good.  I used a cut up chicken and  marinaded for 5 hours. The only change that I made was to add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the marinade. I think it would be even better if I had time to marinade overnight.  My family loved it.  I will make this again.

Ginger adds a nice kick to the recipe & I loved how the chicken wasn't too dry.

I followed the recipe exactly and liked this very much.  The sauce gives an Asian type of oniony flavor that is really different and savory.  The whole house smelled fantastic while it was cooking.

This was pretty good and very moist, but lacked the intensity of flavor we normally perfer.  I cooked it covered for 30 mins and uncovered for 30 mins and still needed more cooking time.
