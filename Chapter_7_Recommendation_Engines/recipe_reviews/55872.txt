Mayo makes this recipe what it is - delicious! But if you want even more flavour I recommend taking everyone else's advice of adding more spices according to your own personal taste. Play it up a little! Be creative and make it with your fave spices and flavours! I only added cajun seasoning and lots of garlic powder and it was fantastic - crispy and tender! My fiance loved it too!!! Oh, and definitely cut down on the bread crumbs.

Will make again! made last night and my youngest gave me a thumbs up from across the table. I added a half a packet or so of racch dressing mix to the mayo and sprinkled some cayanne pepper on the top to add a little spice. sprayed the tops with baking spray then baked. By spraying the tops it makes the coating a bit crunchier. more like fried chicken. Yum.

This chicken was tender and moist. I used plain breadcrumbs and added my own seasoning: some garlic, oregano, onion powder. I also added fresh grated paremesan to the breadcumbs and that really added a nice taste.

I experimented with how thick to spread the mayo since I had never done it this way. I found that a thin layer was the best. Full coverage, but not thick. When I spread the mayo on thicker, it was a little too wet and mayo-y.

you ABSOLUTELY MUST read as many of the reviews as possible before attempting this dish.  I spent a good 20 minutes reading reviews before I even pulled any ingredients out.  I ended up adding cayenne pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to the mayo and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  I seasoned the chicken in salt and a good amount of pepper. I spread on a THIN layer of mayo on chicken and rolled it in italian seasoned breadcrumbs before spraying olive oil on top and cooking on foil lined cookie sheet.  I cooked for 15 minutes before turning each breast over and cooking for 15 more minutes.  Result: crunchy almost fried-chicken like top layer and juicy inside with a nice kick.

My mother LOVES this recipe!!!!  It is so easy to cook and fast too.  My mother is terminally ill and it is hard to get her to eat let alone keep it down with all the chemo she is taking.  She just woke me up @ 12:00AM asking if I could cook this amazing chicken.  I made it in a heartbeat and she ate it all and kept it down.

It made an easy, quick dinner!  My husband was a bit skeptical from looking at the ingredients, but enjoyed it.  I didn't bother with measuring the ingredients....I just spread some mayo on the ckicken, and then coated with crumbs until it looked about right.  Next time I may cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces, toss them in mayo, then toss them in the crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is my recipe for years now for oven fried chicken.. Some tips: If you want spicy or more flavor, add your spices directly to the mayo and mix thoroughly.  I use garlic and onion powder sometimes but mostly cajun seasoning.  Use your judgement on what you like and how much - Sky's the limit, add what you like, even a bit of lemon!  (which I never do, hate lemon chicken :)) - once the spices/herbs are mixed in and the chicken pieces laying flat in a baking pan  - I use a silicon basting brush and paint my chicken with the mayon on one side - this helps keep the mayo even and not too thick. I sprinkle toss my bread crumbs over the chicken, turn the chicken and repeat the process - its quick and keeps the mess down too.  The breadcrumbs.. this works with anything, my guy loves it with panko and chinese 5 spice.  My daughters fav is crushed garlic and herb croutons and cornflakes.  Again, Sky's the limit here.    and if you use low fat mayo, skinless chicken. the calories saved are amazing!This is an EXCELLENT RECIPE and I can't recommend it enough

Great idea for a quick, good dinner! I used only 1/4 cup mayo, and I added a garlic clove, chopped fresh basil and a dash of cayenne to the mayo after reading reviews that complained it was too bland.

Very good! Squeezed some fresh lemon juice on the meat, and added salt, pepper, and parsley before baking. The meat was tender and perfect after 30 minutes in the oven. Excellent and quick meal.

My husband made this for dinner for us.  It was easy enough for him, anyone can make it.  Too bland though.  Could have spicied up the mayo maybe to give it more flavor.

My chicken turned out good.  It did seem to take longer to cook, and it is a little messy to prepare.  My family liked it and I will make it again.

Try mixing 1/4 cup parmesan cheese in with the  mayonnaise. Makes for some moist and tasty chicken, especially if you add a some extra seasonings to the breadcrumbs, as well.

this is excellent... it is juicy, succulent and very, very good. I drizzled with melted butter about half way during baking to prevent drying out but that made it kinda oily.. it is perfect as is.. I also added some fresh ground garlic and black pepper powder to the mayo to give it more flavor.. very easy and quick.. will make many times over... oh, and the baking time was spot on too.. 30 mins and beautifully cooked succulent chicken..

My two year old said "Mo Chick Chick" and my five year old ate thirds. I spiced up the mayo with onion powder, garlic salt and parmesean. Really delicious, something that everyone in the family can enjoy. Thanks for the idea!

Easy to prepare and easily the most moist chicken breasts I have ever eaten. I will never use another breaded recipe other than this. Hubby loved it too. Gone!! I did add about 1/2 t of cayenne and garlic powder to the mayo. Also sprinkled salt and pepper on chicken. Added 1/4 c parmesan to crumbs. coated breasts in mayo mixture and placed crumbs in ziplock bag. shake chicken in mixture to coat. baked 1/2 hr on foil lined cookie sheet. flipped 1/2 way thru. yummy

This really was amazing chicken.  The mayonaise kept it unbelievably moist.  I used the advice of others to use a brush to apply the mayo, added some italian Good Seasonings dry dressing to the mayo, and added some garlic, parmesan and parsley to the bread crumbs.  Extremely easy and very good.

i LOVE this chicken. It comes out so juicy. I brush the mayo on one side with a brush, dip in crumbs, then repeat with the other side.. easier than coating the whole thing at once and getting mayo/crumb Hulk hands.

Our D-D-I-L, (who is a better cook than she thinks she is) made this for dinner and it was... well… “Amazing”! She used large, thick, boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which she cut in half lengthwise. She did add dry ranch dressing mix to the mayo and sprayed olive oil over the tops, as suggested in previous reviews, before baking at 425 degrees for 30 minutes. She thought the chicken was just a tad dry, I thought it was tender and delicious. Every oven is different though, so perhaps checking after 25 minutes might be a suggestion for others. Imagine, spending a great evening with your Grandchildren and having an “Amazing” meal, what more could Grandparents ask for! :-)

YUMMY!  I just finished cooking and eating this tasty chicken.  Rest assured...YOU CAN NOT taste the mayo (besides mayo is just eggs and oil)!  My husband hates mayo (and mustard) and he loved this recipe! I wouldn't tell him how I made it until he finished eating it.  He begged me to tell him because he wants to make this at his fire station!  It must be good!
You MUST add seasonings to the mayo before you spread it on the chicken.  I added anything and everything I could find in the spice cabinet (pepper, garlic salt, larwys all seasoning, lemon pepper).  I then mixed in some shredded mozzarella cheese to the mayo.
I cooked it as directed in the recipe and it was so  moist!  I HATE white meat (breast)because it is so dry, but this was so juicy! A new favorite!

I noticed many people complaining that the recipe was too bland, so to prevent a bad turnout, I added garlic salt, italian seasoning and basil into the mayo. I rarely measure spices such as the above and instead just use my eyes to judge. That was the only part of the recipe I changed.

I was astonished by the results! I think it's physically impossible to get a recipe easier than this! The taste? Provided adequate spices are mixed in... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Just as others have said, you don't even taste the mayonnaise. This simple and delicious recipe will definitely be a reoccurring meal in the future!

Yummy chicken! I used mashed up seasoned croutons and it turned out great. I was pleasantly suprised because I wasn't expecting much, but it was moist inside and crunchy on the outside, perfect baked in an UNGREASED glass baking dish. Definately a keeper!

This was fantastic!  I made this for my family last night and they went nuts for it.  I should tell you that my cooking skills are so bad that my husband has taken to drinking Slimfast at night to avoid my cooking.  So when I put the chicken on the table for the rest of the family he looked at it with great suspician.  When he saw us enjoying it so much he tried it and ended up eating two pieces!  I added some Paul Prudhomme spices to the breadcrumbs to kick it up a little.  Fabulous recipe!  Thanks so much!

This was terrific.  So quick and easy, and the cleanup is a snap too.  I suggest having a couple lemon wedges handy to drizzle over the top right before you serve.  I only made one alteration - since some folks were saying this turned out a little bland, I stirred in about 1 Tablespoon of Paul Newman's Parmesan and Garlic dressing into the mayo before coating the chicken.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Exelent recipe. I also spiced up the mayo with some red pepper and garlic power. Chicken turns out moist, and full of flavor. Easy to make and if you use a large bowl not all that messy. Also very good useing skined leg quarters as well! But lobger cooking time is required since bone is still in. A Winner !!

This recipe got me compliments from everyone, including my husband who has a hard time eating chicken. I even fed it to a brother in law who hates mayo and didn't even notice it was there. Of course I added spices to my liking, which I do to every recipe anyways. Will probably doing this weekly :)

READ THE REVIEWS!!  It's the key to this recipe.  The mayo keeps the chicken moist but you are going to want to spice up the breading!!  I went with bread crumbs, Parmesan, onion powder, Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  My husband loved it served with spagetti and noodles and a touch of fresh Parmesan.

Easy!  I did like the others and added garlic and seasonings to the mayo.  I also crushed stuffing mix and used that instead of bread crumbs just because that's what I had on hand.  Tasty!

Works great with the new Kraft Sandwich Shop Flavored Mayo. Quick, easy, and quite tasty. I'll make this again.

Loved this easy recipe. Turned out crispy and moist. Hint: you don't have to put alot of mayo on and you should lightly coat the chicken, not dredge it. That's how you get the crispness. Thanks for this recipe.

Very Good. This was so quick & easy. It turned out very juicy & tender. I added 2 tbsp. of dijon mustard and 1 tbsp. of honey to the mayo. and it tasted great. Perfect for a weeknight family meal.

The juiciest chicken breast I ever had... I changed the recipe a little bit. I made it like chicken parmigian. I also added garlic salt after i spread mayo on the chicken. I used 420 temp for exactly 30 min. I added some garlic tomoato sauce and mozerella cheese 5 min on low broil temp. Severred with steamed broccoli and angel hair pasta. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and of couse I did too.

I used a whole cut up chicken with the skin on because of the dryness issue I kept reading about. I mixed a package of dry ranch dressing into 1 cup of mayo and followed the rest of the recipe but baked for an hour at 350 and it was very good. As a sidebar, you can use mayo to cook a lot of things like this, I've been doing it for years. It makes your bread crumbs stick tight and keeps food moist.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was great! My husband usually isn't thrilled with chicken but he enjoyedit too. Only addition I made was adding some ranch dressing mix (powdered) to both the mayo & the bread crumbs. Will make again.

Don't worry if you don't like Mayo neither do I. You can't taste the mayo it just locks in the juice and flavor.  It usually takes longer than 30 mins to cook though. What I love about this recipe is its easy, it tastes soo good & can be adapted to your tastes. the 1st time I made it I added a pinch of red pepper to give it a little kick, my bf likes it with rosemary. Add whatever you like its great original as well. To make clean up a little easier I put mayo on one paper plate and the crumbs on another them dip each piece in order and place it in the baking pan. then all I have to do is toss the plats and chicken container with no dishes to worry about. It is one of the only recipies that hasn't irratated my sense of smell since I 've been pregnant.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of bone in chicken breast and baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  I also used another reviewer's advice and sprayed butter flavored baking spray on the bread crumbs for extra crispiness.  Will make again!

The high reviews made me want to make this dish.  My husband tried it and said "booooring", then, threw it out.  I agree.  I have never given a one star before, but that's how bad it is.

This was a great base recipe. I added chopped garlic to the mayo as well as basil salt and garlic salt. I also added some paprika and pepper. For the breadcrumbs I used panko. I spread the mayo mixture on thin and then covered it in panko. It turned out really well. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Okay so this was Delicious!!!! I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo just because that is what I had in the fridge. The Miracle whip gave it kind of a sweet bite. This was very good.  I just wondered though is there any way at all we can prevent  the chicken from sticking to the bottom. I sprayed oil on the botton of the pan.

Try this similar recipe from this site instead, Garlic Chicken submitted by Carol.  It is similar, but much more flavorful and healthier.  It also uses bread crumbs, but mixed with parmesan cheese and it uses garlic infused olive oil in place of the mayo.   This recipe was not amazing, it just tasted like chicken with soggy breadcrumbs on it, because you can't taste the mayo.  Trust me:  Garlic Chicken!

I prefer the Amazing Crusted Chicken recipe on this site. This one has fewer coating ingredients. After trying them both, using mayo to hold the coating and to moisten the meat doesn't work for me. Garlic Chicken (also on this site) uses garlic-infused olive oil, and is, IMO, much better.

This recipe was great. I made just some slight modifications. I used Best Foods mayonnaise and regular bread crumbs in addition to beating the chicken breast. It turned out tender and melted in your mouth. My 2 year old inhaled it.

Although this was quite good, after sitting over night, the next day, it really was amazing, once the flavors had a chance to meld together.

I took other reviewers suggestions and added things to give it taste. I LOVE onions, so here's what I did. 

Instead of mayo, I started with Ken's light Vidalia Onion Salad Dressing. To that I added dehydrated onion and chopped garlic, onion powder and black pepper.

I mixed it all together and let it sit for a couple of minutes, to soften up the dehydrated onion and garlic before dredging the chicken through it. Then I coated with seasoned breadcrumbs. 

I lined a baking sheet with foil, dull side up and wiped just a little bit of garlic olive oil over the foil. Baked in a 375 degree oven for about 35 minutes, turning chicken over halfway through. 

I was quite surprised to find that the chicken was moist and it did in fact, have a lot of flavor. I have to say though that I absolutely loved it the day after! I made a chicken sandwich and the chicken was very tasty.  

I will definitely be making this again and again! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

Mixed some Mrs Dash seasoning blend and pepper in mayo and crumbs. Used panko crumbs. Could use crushed corn flakes or crackers. Large breasts so I cut them in half to assure complete cooking. Took about 35 min. Agree with other reviews that a thin coating of mayo is best. Easy and good.

This was a very good dish.  Here's how I did it: 5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and dried with paper towels.  In a medium size bowl put 2 big spoons of mayo seasoned with garlic powder, sea salt and onion powder - with tongs add the chicken and swoosh around to get it all covered - in a rectangular ziploc food container went about 3/4 c. panko crumbs I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, sea salt and freshly ground pepper - put in the chicken and seal the top on and shake and turn upside down to cover everything with the crumb mixture.  I poured about 4 T. olive oil into a glass baking dish and put the chicken in for 20 minutes then turned it once and cooked for the additional 30 minutes.  I hate getting my hands goopy and some of the posts mentioned it was messy - so this is how I handled it.  I wondered if the boneless thighs would cook like breasts would for the 30 mins. at 425 - they came out great - tender, juicy, nice crisp coating.  Best of all - it was quick to prepare.  I got a late start on dinner but had everything on the table by 6 thanks to this recipe.

I used this recipe for inspiration, then put my own twist on it. I crushed fresh garlic in the mayo and let it rest while I prepped the chicken. I used plain panko breadcrumbs and seasoned them myself using paprika, cayenne pepper, basil, oregano, onion powder, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and a fresh cracked pepper. The panko gets really crispy, almost like fried chicken without the deep frying! I've made it using chicken thighs as well. A great recipe when you're short on time!

This recipe is very nice as-is and perfect for most meals.  I was in a mood for "slow cooking", so I altered it a bit.  I pounded the chicken a bit to tenderize, then seasoned with a little salt and pepper.  I also made garlic mayo - 2 cloves of garlic, put through the press, some thyme and a bit of pepper.  Coated the chicken with that.  Seasoned the breadcrumbs myself too, with some salt, pepper, thyme and oregano.  OMG.  Soooo good.  That made it a 5.  But even as is, 4 or 4.5

This was good chicken.  Not wow, but good. I added garlic powder and onion powder to the mayo, but I spread on with a knife a thin layer of mayo, and didn't even end up using 1/2 of it, so with that I lost some of the seasonings I added.  I also added 1/2 c. grated parmasan cheese to the bread crumbs.

I learned a recipe similar to this one from my Mom. Instead of mayo, she uses a ranch dressing/milk mixture and adds parm cheese to the bread crumbs. It's absolutely wonderful!!

I ran out of Mayo and used sour cream instead.  I also added chili powder and garlic powder to the sour cream.  Added a little parmesan to the bread crumbs and it all came out really great.  Will definitely make again.

I just made this tonight for dinner, and I was quite impressed!  I had chicken thighs in the fridge and not knowing what to cook for dinner, but wanting something quick, easy, light and tasty, I checked out allrecipes and found this very simple recipe.  I took other reviews advise and added spices to the plain breadcrumbs, such as  oregano, pepper flakes, cayanne and salt and pepper, also to keep it light I used plain yogurt and added about 2 tablespoons of light miracle whip (all I had in the fridge no Mayo) I cooked this for 30 minutes and found it cooked perfect, very juicy and tender!! I served this with Corn niblets, the (frozen kind) very delicious!!! even my 19 month old enjoyed this dish!! next time I will try  with parmesanan or mozzarella sprinkled on top.  Also I enjoyed the crispiness on the bottom of the pieces chicken pieces.  Thank you for the recipe!.

This was a delicious, simple recipe. My husband went nuts over how moist and delicious the chicken was. He normally ALWAYS has to dip his chicken, no matter what kind, in some sort of sauce. (Mayo/Miracle Whip, BBQ, Ranch, Honey Mustard) He ate it just as is! I used Miracle Whip which gave it a nice zip and three cheese bread crumbs with Italian Seasoning and California Style Garlic Powder sprinkled on top. I also broiled them the last 2 minutes for toasty bread crumbs. I advise to broil them on LOW and putting the dish on the lowest rack! I've never really broiled anything before and left the dish where it was on the top rack and broiled them for 2 minutes on high. Whoops! Luckily I caught it before they got too burnt. I was able to scrap those little burnt spots off! Still really, really good!

I needed something fast and easy to bake chicken breasts. Truly good recipe. I didn't have the bread crumbs so I used Italian flavored Panko bread crumbs. Chicken was moist and topping nice and crunchy. This is a keeper!

Some of the best chicken I have made in a while!  I added some minced garlic & pepper to the mayo & extra seasonings to the bread crumbs.  I didn't measure anything and it came out wonderful!  So moist and juicy as well as flavorful!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe :)

We loved this chicken! It's true, you can't taste the mayo, but it does help the chicken stay very moist. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I made my own using 1 cup plain Panko (I found 1 cup to be plenty to cover all four chicken breasts). To the Panko, I added 2 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/4 cup parm., 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. The chicken came out so delicious and juicy! We will make this again.

I made it as it's written first and it came out so moist and oh so easy!  The second time I made this, I used chicken tenders and panko (no seasonings).  It came out just like chicken katsu and I served it with some tonkatsu sauce.  Now I can have my chicken katsu without a hassle of deep frying on a hot summer day.  It was awesome!  ... I mean, "amazing"!

This dish is AMAZING. For those who doubt the mayonnaise: you must give it a try! I used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo because I do not care for it, and when I told my husband that I dipped the chicken in Miracle Whip and then coated it in bread crumbs, I could tell he was very skeptical. But from the first bite, we were both VERY happy with the results! Give it a try, you will not regret it!

Really simple, and the chicken turns out nice and moist.  I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned my self with some salt and pepper and fresh basil, a clove of garlic, oregano.  2 cups is lots, probably one is enough. Was a big hit with garlic mashed and rainbow carrots and peas.

Very good easy meal!  My boys age 3 and 5 love it and so does my husband.  This is a great go-to dinner when I need to throw something together quickly with ingredients I have on hand.  I use hellmans light mayo and I have also used light sour cream when I didn't have mayo on hand.  The only thing I add is a few small bits of butter on top because we like the extra flavor and crispness it adds.  It turns out great every time!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe with pork chops and increased the cooking time to a little over an hour.  I used miracle whip and garlic/herb italian bread crumbs.  It was so good, and smelled great while it was cooking.

I thought it was amazing.  It was juicy and delicious, baked to perfection.  I did add a couple extra seasonings to the breadcrumbs (crushed french fried onion, salt, black pepper, paprika, and a little parmesan cheese) and it was great.  I'm sure it was the mayo that kept in the juicy-ness, so I will definitely be making this again!  Oh, and I used light miracle whip cause that's what we like in our house.  Thank you!  I also sprayed the top with pam like someone suggested to give the top a little more crispiness, and I'm not sure if that did a whole lot or not.  Anyways, even my husband who doesn't like "plain chicken" without dipping it in bbq or honey mustard, ate it plain and loved it.  Great recipe!

Very tastey! Really moist...mmmm, loved it. I used Best foods mayo w/ olive oil, Plain bread crumbs, montreal ck seasoning w/ less sodium and parmesan. Sprayed w/ pam so it would be crispy, And in the oven it went. Very good.

Great fast and easy recipe. The chicken came out very moist and tender (I did listen to other reviewers and added paprika and garlic powder to the chicken prior to adding the bread crumbs for more flavor and it worked out great!) You dont even taste the mayo. Bread crumbs are delicious just be sure to crumble them evenly and fine to avoid burnt pieces ! I also added parm cheese to the top which added more crunch and sprayed with pam. Will make again!

Oooh la la! So easy to make. I used drumsticks and it came out really well. I highly recommend this recipe! For a different option the whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs work extremely well. I am going to try this again tonight!!

Good and quick to prepare, I did add some minced garlic to the mayo and some parm cheese to the bread crumbs since I only had plain bread crumbs.

Well I didn't have italian bread crumbs. So I add a package of dried italian dressing mix to the plain crumbs. Salt, pepper and garlic granule to the chicken after the mayo. The Dam Man asked what I did to make it so good. Today he told me about telling the guys at work about it. Said to print out the recipe for him to give it out at work. He wants this more often.

A Keeper!  Like everyone else I added spices to my bread crumb mixture.  Used Contadina 4 cheese bread crumbs and liberally added Emeril's Orignal Essecence and some Italian Seasoning.  Lightly coated 4 large breasts with 1/2 cup of regular mayo using a basting brush and only needed about 1.5 cups of crumb mixture.  Baked at 425 for 40 minutes and it was fantastic.  Nice and moist with great flavor.  Served with steamed mixed veggies and an herbed pasta in sauce (Rice-A-Roni).  Went down well with a nice oaky Chardonnay.  Will add this to my 'favorites' list.  Enjoy!

Very yummy!!! So easy too! A few things I recommend- sprinkle some salt & pepper (or whataever other extra seasonings you like) before the mayo. Then apply the thin layer of mayo, and roll in the crumbs. Halfway through the 30 minutes, I flipped the chicken over so both sides were a little crunchy. Lastly, for the final 3 or 4 minutes I set the oven to broil. This made the top just a little extra crispy and delicious. Overall- delicious chicken! Thanks!

I add a pkg. of zesty italian Good Seasons to the mayo and substitute parmesan for 1/2 of the bread crumbs.  This is delish with couscous for a quick dinner (If you pound the chix breasts or use cutlets, it's much quicker, like 20 min) and it's also good with cheese and spaghetti sauce melted over for a quick chicken parm.  Yummy.

This is SERIOUSLY the best chicken recipe for a quick meal. Of course I changed it up a bit.  Instead of breadcrumbs I used Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing mixed with shreaded parmesean cheese, this makes it VERY crispy and gives it a good flavor! I tenderized the chicken and seasoned with salt, garlic powder, a touch of ginger and pepper. Smoothered the chicken in mayo and then rolled it in the stuffing and cheese mix. Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes exact and came out PERFECT! Tender and juicy and just enough crisp on the outside. This is an awesome recipe you can tailor to your needs!

Great easy recipe.  I did add the following as suggested by others: 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne (both to the mayonnaise) and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. Very, very moist. I don't like mayonnaise and I couldn't taste it at all.  Also, as other recommended, I didn't bother putting the bread crumbs on the underside of the chicken. Thanks for a great new recipe,  Karriecarlyle!

This chicken is so good and so easy to make....my husband and my 2 year old both really like it :@) (I had a whole pack of chicken breasts and I just used mayo and bread crumbs as needed... didn't measure anything)
Thanks for the recipe :~)

I have made a similar recipe several times before. I have always mix equal parts mayo and parmesan cheese, and  I coat the chicken with that, it gives it a lot more flavor. Then I sprinkle the top with italian bread crumbs. My fiance loves this dish!

I made this recipe looking for a quick dinner meal for me and my wife. I get a little tired of regular breaded chicken and look to do more with chicken. So when I read this one, it was a slight twist. But I must admit this small twist made some of "THE" most tender, tasteful, and delicious baked chicken breasts I have ever made. I guess its all in the  mayo. Whatever the reason, it is absolutely delicious and worth a try. Dont forget to use a fork to turn... the mayo will become messy to bread.... but either way, quick, easy, and well worth it. You dont taste the mayo... so if you dont like mayo.. just try it... you will love the moist chicken it produces without the mayo flavor.

WOW!! This was great.  Followed suggestion of others and added a little shake of garlic powder and onion powder to the mayo (used regular mayo - but next time I will use low fat).  Added about 1 cup grated parma cheese to the bread crumbs.  Very delicious and quick to make.  Served with boxed wild rice mix.

Ok so I used regular bread crumbs instead of Italian (We don't like the Italian bread crumbs.), and I seasoned with LOTS of garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper. I even cut into the chicken and added extra seasonings inside the chicken. Smelled terrific as it was baking, but when it came out the chicken itself wasn't very seasoned at all. Not sure if I'll try this recipe again. We'll have to wait and see.

I used miracle whip instead of mayo, which was a mistake because it was all I could taste. Also, pretty bland overall.  I would recommend using lots more garlic and other spices

This was a good dish and very easy to make.  I actually used chicken thighs and used 1/4c low fat mayo and 1/4 regular mayo so it wouldn't be as fatty.  I also added some minced garlic to the mayo to add some extra flavor.  I served it with pasta and red sauce and everyone loved it.  I'm definitely making this again!

I made this the first time as the recipe called and it was alright, after playing with it a little I really enjoy it.  I mix about half and half mayo and sour cream and add parmesan cheese.  A coarser grade of bread crumbs makes a difference.

Fantastic and simple to make.  I used low-fat mayo and both my husband and I loved it.  He said to make more next time so he could have leftovers.  Thank you.

This was so good and so easy!  I know the mayo sounds strange, but it gets absorbed into the chicken and all you taste are the seasoned bread crumbs.  I used low-fat mayo to cut down on the calories.  Also, I switched my oven to broil for the last 2 minutes so the bread crumbs got toasty brown.  This is great for a quick meal!  I will definitely be making it again.

This is a great recipe!  So easy and so good!  Just use plain bread crumbs and season them as you like them - spicy, cajun, lemon pepper, etc.  I used Japanese Panko bread crumbs - they have a nice consistency and you can flavor them as you like.  The chicken came out so moist and the bread crumbs came out crispy - as if I had browned the chicken before putting it into the oven.  Cut up some potatoes and onions, toss with olive oil and seasoning in a separate pan, place in the oven beside the chicken and you have dinner!

This is a quick and easy recipe that turns out delicious!  I substitute plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, and it turns out amazing without the fat! I’ve made it multiple times. The yogurt keeps the chicken moist, and I cook on racks to keep the chicken from sitting in the juices and getting soggy.

Very tasty. I added some garlic powder to mayo and sprinkled some herbs on the top of the breaded chicken before cooking. Turned out great. Very easy meal, and quick.

The mayo is an easy solution to replace egg with milk and butter. It keeps the chicken moist and adheres the bread crumbs. I've added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs for extra flavor. Do not use fat free mayo because it doesn't "melt", but you can use "Reduced" fat mayo and it still works.

This is very similar to the recipe on the back of the Mayonnaise jar, called "Parmesan Crusted Chicken," and my family absolutely loves it! However, that recipe calls for 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese mixed with the 1/2 cup of Mayo, and instead of completely coated in everything, you spread the tops of the chickens with the mayo/cheese mixture, and then sprinkle seasoned breadcrumbs on top of the chickens as well:) I highly recommend the changes for anyone commenting that this recipe is a bit bland. I use tenderloins instead of breasts and cook at the 425 degrees for 20 minutes and they are perfectly cooked and moist.

I didn't measure ingredients, I just guessed. Also, I cut chicken into little strips and added 2 cloves of garlic to mayo and added some paprika and garlic powder to bread crumbs. It's in the oven right now, have to see how it tastes!

UPDATE: So delicious! I swear the best chicken I've ever eaten!!! Super moist and perfect 5 stars for sure!
thanks KARRIECARLYLE!

YUM! Very tasty! I read some of the reviews and I agree that this is def a recipe that you can make your own. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, powdered onion, paprika, and cumin. I DID NOT cover the breasts with mayo, I laid them in the pan, topped them with a layer a mayo, shredded cheese, and finally the bread crumbs. It baked perfectly and the breasts were SO juicy! Can't wait to make it again!

This WAS "Amazing" for real! I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, only plain, so i added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Harvest Dill, some Italian Seasoning spice and a (big) dash of Cayenne to kick it up a notch & it was THE BOMB-DIGGITY!!! My husband even took leftovers to work the next day & said it was still great even then...although he refused to call it "Amazing Chicken" to his friends because he thought the name was a little too goofy, haha!! But a big thumbs up from him & my 4 yr old son means i will be making it again!! Thanks Karrie!

I made the recipe with about 1/4 mayo & just enough bread crumbs to coat. I think about 1 cup. I didn't measure. I coated with mayo, and bread crumbs and then used a garlic shaker, and cajun spice and shook it on, as well as pepper...it was so moist! wow! Really good.

I've been making this for a couple of years, and it's my family's favorite chicken dish.  To the mayo, I add 1 tsp. of whatever herbs or spices I'm in the mood for.  Italian Seasoning, dill, cajun seasoning, lemon pepper all work well!

Reciper was great with a few mods.  I added garlic powder, onion slat, minced garlic, cayenne pepper, black pepper to the mayonaise.  The flavor was great.Way better than fried chicken and much more healthy.

The mayo keeps the chicken very moist during the cooking process.  I added 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese to the mayo for extra flavor.  My kids enjoyed it because it's similar to chicken nuggets.  This turned out wonderful.

this is decent chicken.  i used fat free hellman's instead of regular mayo- i never have it in my house anyway, plus i can't justify adding all those calories and fat to a baked chicken dish.  the chicken was pretty moist but i'm not sure it was a huge difference from dipping in egg whites first.  thanks!

Loved this! I know we changed a few things, but I forgot exactly what (made it a couple of weeks ago), but it's definetly a great starting recipe. The left overs however weren't as good, should have just finished eating it when it was fresh.

I added one packet of dry ranch dressing to the bread crumbs and sprinkled with cayenne pepper for some kick. Definately being added to the supper rotation!

I am the only one in my family that likes mayo so I didn't tell them how I made this until AFTER they had eaten. The whole family loved it and couldn't believe they ate chicken breaded in mayo. Another family favorite!

I tweaked the recipe a lil bit, I added a pack of Lipton's Onion soup mix and 2TBS bacon bits to the mayo ( I made 3lbs of chicken so I added more mayo).  I also mixed some of my favorite spices into the bread crumbs.  I then sprayed PAM over the breasts before baking. I baked them for 35 min.
They came out crispy and juicy. I will make this again!

This recipe was so good and so easy to prepare...The chicken was tender and moist and you couldn't even taste the mayo (although this was a good thing I was a bit curious to find out how it would taste if I could taste the mayo, oh well I will find out next time). It was a hit with my boyfriend who will eat anything but rarely enjoys the food he eats because of the fact he's always in a rush with work. It was abit messy to prepare but I felt so proud to actually learn how to cook using this recipe...yes it was my first time cooking...we will definitely make this again...next time I might try using Dijon mustard instead of mayo....mmmmm chicken :)

Aaaaamazing!  The only thing I changed was I used French's Fried Onions instead of Bread crumbs and added some salt & pepper, oregano, and garlic powder.  The family devoured the dish!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This would be good for a beginning cook as it's simple and hard to ruin. Mine came out fine, but I wouldn't call it amazing. I would probably make it again because it's easy. I made it a very easy meal by serving  with Rice Pilaf (from a box) and one of those salads that are pre-packaged. While some readers may say that's lazy or not gourmet, it certainlybeats what my co-workers serve their families every night (fast food they pick up through a drive through window).

This chicken was easy and tasted great.  I used Italian bread crumbs and added garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, & cayenne.  Also used melted butter as the grease in the pan for cooking.

It sure was easy to prepare, but the chicken was not very tasty.  I even added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese, as many reviewers had done.  Still not impressed.  We all had to add sauces like honey mustard to make it taste not quite so dry.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would! This really is "Amazing" chicken!  I slightly altered the bread crumb mixture  to suit my taste.  I used 1 c freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1 c panko bread crumbs, and added a generous amount of garlic powder.  The chicken was SO tender and flavorful!  This dish was incredibly simple to prepare, and tasted wonderful to boot :~)

Oh my gosh - SO GOOD!
Try this - I used French's French Fried Onions instead of breadcrumbs and added 1/4 c. parmessan cheese, pepper and garlic powder and it was so amazing! Everyone loved it and raved the whole dinner through! Yum, yum, YUM!

This was very good.  You don't taste the mayo and everyone gobbled it up.   I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would've lacked something if I didn't add the parm cheese and garlic salt  to the bread crumb mix.  Super easy, everyone enjoyed it -- sounds worthy of making again in my book!!

Love it. It's so simple, yet so delicious.  If you don't have italian seasoned bread crumbs, just add your own seasoning.  

This recipe also makes great Chicken Parm if you flatten the chicken breast first.

It was ok. I followed the recipe as is, and it was a little blend to my taste. Even though I used cooking spray, it was really hard to keep it from sticking on the pan... that was a little frustrating.  It was very moist though.

I was surprised by how well it turned out.  I used fat-free mayo instead (mixed in garlic salt, pepper and dry chopped onion), Italian seasoned bread crumbs, was delicious.  My boyfriend hates mayo and after he tried it told me "good find!"  The fat-free mayo circumvents the fat/cholesterol problem of this meal.  And it was very tasty.

I wasn't too thrilled with this one. It was kind of bland, not much flavor. My husband and son (9 years old) seemed to like it ok though. If I make it again I will definitely add more seasoning.

5 star with modifications.  Made a mixure with the mayo with 1 tsp minced garlic (jar type), about 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp of each fresh basil and oregeno (also jar type).  Seriously OMG good.  Made with easy alfredo sauce from this site.  Off the hook good.

Giving 5 stars because my husband loved this.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo because he doesn't like mayo.  The chicken was surprisingly tender.  Very easy and quick receipe.

*Updated* This went from good to GREAT by using Chipotle Mayo in place of plain! Wow!

Orig review: This was quite good! The chicken was crispy on the outside & moist and tender inside. I added minced roasted garlic to the mayo, and I used panko breadcrumbs which I seasoned with a tbsp each of paprika,  Italian seasoning blend, onion powder, poultry seasoning, garlic powder & cracked pepper.

I love this recipe and you can adapt it to so many variations.  I line my baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray for easier clean up, and only cook it for 30 min on 375.  I always use half mayo and half milk because it's easier to dip.  I have tried bread crumbs, saltines, cornflakes, and crackers--all successfully.  I also used a sleeve of buttery round crackers this time and it was excellent.  Next time i'm planning on drizzling with some honey.

This was delicious. I cut the chicken into pieces and just dipped into the mayo for a light coating, then rolled it into a Stove-Top stuffing mix. It was great. I also added parm cheese. My family loved it. My husband ate the leftovers for breakfast. He never eats leftovers! I served it with sticky rice and carrots and green beans.

Very good, tender and moist. I did make some changes. I added garlic and onion powder along with some oregano (dried) and added a good amount of grated parmesan cheese to the mayo,  I made this the day ahead so it could set up, blend flavors and would not be runny like plain mayo. I also added some dry ranch dressing to the bread crumbs. My husband and son must have said this is great 3 times while eating. Next time i wil add a little fresh lemon juice just before serving.

I have been making this often for a while now.  The only thing I do is use miracle whip instead of mayo because the first time I did it I didn't have any mayo.  It cuts down on calories using MW and you can't taste it at all.  I add salt and pepper too.  Wonderful!

This is a great idea, although I do like adding some additional spices to give the chicken some flavor.  When I was younger my nana used to coat a chicken breast in a mayonnaise, Parmesan, and spices mixture.  This is somewhat similar to that.

I was skeptical, mayo... ewwww However, it was quick, easy and most of ALL amazing. I asked my son what he wanted for his family birthday dinner and he said, "hmmmm can you make that amazing chicken we had the other night". YaY, I was so happy because it is easy.  I used italian panko bread crumbs and took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a packet of italian dressing (organic).   I am making it for about 20 people Sunday, hopefully it is as amazing as the first time!!  Thanks for sharing.

Great and easy recipe, for a little different take, after 15 minutes in the oven, spread a very thin layer of honey bbq sauce and sprinkle with finely shredded mozzarella cheese! We loved it this way, served with stuffing and broccoli!

This was good.  I added a little powdered ranch dip mix into the mayo and sprayed the top of the chicken with cooking spray as others have recommended.  It was tasty (flavorful) and crispy on the top... but a little bit soggy on the bottom.  I think that next time, I may coat the chicken in the mayo mixture and just sprinkle breadcrumbs on top, as I've seen other reviewers rave about.  It is really easy so in any event, I will continue to make it.  It's much easier than breading and frying the chicken on the stove top.  Like I saw another reviewer say, I would have given this recipe a 4.5, but there's no option for it.  I reheated this dish 2 days later and it was even better!  I warmed it in the toaster oven and then broiled each side for about 5-10 min until crispy.  I think that next time I will broil the chicken on both sides before taking it out of the oven.

I made this for my husband and his brother, and they both liked it a lot.  I added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture, and I sprayed the tops of the chicken with cooking spray before I baked them.  This made it a little more crunchy.  I was a little nervous about this recipe since I HATE mayonnaise, but you can't taste it.  So even if you are a mayonnaise hater like me, give it a try!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! The chicken came out so juicy and tender! I added a teeny bit of sour cream and ranch dressing to the mayo and sprinkled in a little paprika with the bread crumbs before I rolled the chicken in it. Great recipe!

I have made this before the only thing is instead of just the mayo alone mix Parmesan cheese with it first I'll say about 1/4 a cup or more or what ever amount you like. Just not to much it can be salty. Then spread all over the chicken and then sprinkle bread crumbs on top and bake till chicken is done.

I made this dish last night for my husband who doesn't really care for chicken. He LOVED it!!! I was really surprised and thrilled at how easy it was. I took other reviewers' advice and added extra seasonings to the italian breadcrumbs. I added Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Salt, and Pepper. I didn't want to get the kitchen all messy so I just greased my pan, then put the chicken breasts in it, coated one side with mayo and sprinkled the breadcrumb mixture on top of it. I patted it down into the mayo, then flipped the chicken over and did the other side! Very easy and no mess! I did turn the breasts over halfway during the cooking time which seemed to help get the moistness all the way through.  **Make sure the breasts are thawed all the way before you cook and the oven temp and time in the recipe is perfect** Will definitely make again!

This chicken was great. As I was making it my husband look at the mayo and suggested I not make it or be prepared to cook a second dinner. Well he was wrong and he loved it. He wanted more. I did add cayenne, cumin, salt and garlic powder to the mayo for flavor.

This was such an easy and tasty recipe! I found it while looking for a quick dinner and am so glad I tried it. The chicken was so tender and well done. I mixed italian dry salad dressing mix in with the bread crumbs because I only had plain bread crumbs. It smelled SOOO good while it was cooking, and tasted just as good. I'd fully recommend it, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Fantastic chicken, tender and moist. Added some paprika and garlic powder to the mayo. Definitely a keeper. The 2 cups of bread crumbs was too much for the 6 chicken breasts, and  I have about half remaining, which I'll use to make this again. Yum!

I was a little disapointed with one. Maybe I had too high of expectations after reading all the reviews. I will say that this recipe is beyond easy to make and worth trying. Next time I am pressed for time and ingredients I would do this again. I think it needs a little honey mustard sauce or something for dipping. Otherwise for me it was just a little too plain.

This was so quick and easy--and very tasty too! The mayo adds a nice 'bite' to the chx.  I cut the chx breasts into strips instead of cooking the breasts whole--still good!  A good change of dinner pace!

Great chicken. Very easy to make and quick. I added some garlic powder & herb chicken seasoning to my bread crumbs (I used crushed seasoned croutons) and added paprika and butter spray on top of chicken before cooking. It had a great flavor. I'll make this again.

chicken came out tender, but very bland even after marinating for 2 hours.  I added some  pepper flakes, paprika and garlic powder,but still not happy with it.

This chicken was delicious! I used thin chicken breast and baked them on a cookie sheet for only 22 mins. They came out well, though almost overdone, so I would lower the temp next time to 400. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I am only giving this 3 stars as it stands. It is sort of bland, and needs some spices added to it, but it is a great start. On a second attempt I added spices and it is a 5 star if you do.

Yummy recipe. It's quick and easy. I didn't have the bread crumbs so I made my own and took the reviews advice and put lots of spices that we like, like cajun,salt,pepper and parmesan. It was good.  Thank you

NOTE:NEW POST 2/7/06  I have made this dish a couple more times and once tried w/ dijon mustard which was a mistake. The first time I made this, the coating was good because I added extra spices to the breadcrumbs, but tonight I also seasoned the chicken and used a little less mayo.  I cooked for the full 30 minutes and then turned over the chicken and put back in the oven for another 5, just to crisp up the underside.  Some people here have said theirs was not crispy, but I haven't had that problem.  This recipe was MUCH better today, since I seasoned the chicken before putting on the mayo & breadcrumbs.  This is a quick and easy recipe, but like lots of others, I added some of my own spices to add a little something extra.  I used the italian seasoning breadcrumbs and added fresh ground black pepper, a dash of lemon pepper and some cayenne.  Next time I make this, I will try dijon mustard !

This was a great quick recipe that uses only 3 ingredients that I always have in the house.  I use chicken tenders for the kids, they think they are chicken figers and like to dip them in BBQ sauce.

This was a wonderful, easy recipe.  I did it a little different, by using spicey mayo and flattening the chix breast and putting some colby jack cheese in the middle and rolling it.  Put it in the oven with some olive oil.  But this recipe was great! Very easy and SO GOOD!  I served with potatoes au gratin made with medium salsa queso.

If you like mayo a lot, this recipe is for you.  I actually do eat mayo, so I thought that maybe the mayo would keep the chicken moist, which it did, and believed the submitter when she said you couldn't taste the mayo.  You most definitely could!  It dominated the entire flavoring.  :-(  Not so good.

Was very good, used a little to much mayo, but I like mayo so hey.  I will definately put it in my recipe rotation.  I also substituted 1/2 the bread crumbs for parmesan/romano mix and seasoned the chicken.

AMAZING Chicken dish!!!  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so I just used crushed crackers with Italian Seasoning sprikles in the crackers, and it was WONDERFUL!!  Even my red meat eating husband said that it was really good (of course he added 'for chicken'), that is quite a compliment from him!!!

Absolutely loved this dish!  The chicken was so juicy, my husband sopped up the juice in the pan!  Can't believe 2 ingredients tasted so good.  I sprinkled a little garlic powder on top, and flipped them halfway through.  Great recipe.

I was skeptical at first because of the mayonnaise, but decided to give it a try.  I used regular bread crumbs (rather than the italian seasoned) and added some garlic powder and season salt to taste.  I covered the chicken breasts with the mayo (I was afraid I had used too much at first) then made sure every inch of chicken was covered in the bread crumbs.  After baking for half an hour, all of the chicken breasts were cooked all the way through and still very moist.  The breading was crispy and had great flavor.  I used a stone baking dish.

If you're not getting moist chicken, use more mayonnaise.  If you're getting flavorless chicken, add seasoning to your bread crumbs.  It's as simple as that.

I make this recipe all the time and my husband and I love it.  I grew up with the typical egg batter and bread crumb baked chicken and I'm not a fan of that and neither is my husband, but the mayo made a WORLD of difference.  If you are looking for an quick, easy, and tasty alternative to the typial baked chicken this is definitely it!
And for a ligher alternative use half light mayo and regular mayo, it makes no difference in the taste.

This was a great recipe.  My husband loved it.  I added a handful of crushed potato chips to the bread crumbs and sprinkled some paprika on the mayo before coating it. I used skinless breasts and they were really juicy.   I will make this often.

This was delish! I made it according to recipe which I always do first time out. Hubs who never ever eats mayonnaise loved it. I actually hid the mayonnaise jar and never told him there was mayo in the recipe. You would never guess that there was mayonnaise in the coating. This is a definite keeper.

Very good as shown. Made it this way a collection times. For variety try adding a tblsp dijon mustard or siracha.

Didn't make any changes or additions--it was very good.  I almost let it get too brown and a little dry because I was multi-tasking that day--didn't hear my timer.  It still had a great taste.  Thanks for a really quick easy recipe!

It was so good, the mayo made the difference I think, it kept the chicken moist inside. I really liked that you could put the  spices you like and how much you want  in the mayo
I'll be making it again.

I've been making this chicken for over 25 years. It was originally featured on the back of Best Foods mayonnaise as "Magically Moist Chicken" it's still a family favourite even after all these years!

I've been making chicken this way for years.  I add different seasonings to the bread crumbs and mayonnaise to give the final dish a twist.  Try adding any combination os  granulated garlic, granulated onion,  basil, oregano, Parmesan cheese, thyme, or any of your favorite herbs.  It's great with pork chops too.  And... you can make a great tasting fish using the same method.

It tastes excellent, but anyone who says you can't taste the mayo is not telling the truth! I thought I could sneak it by my husband who doesn't like it, but he definitely noticed. I also think it called for too much mayo and would reduce the amount a bit.

I've been making this for YEARS!  I've always cooked the chicken at 350 for 15-20 minutes per side ( depending on the thickness of the chicken breast.  Comes out nice and moist. 425 sounds too high a temp.

Great recipe and thanks for sharing. I am rating this  as prepared with the provided ingredients and instructions! I've also used panko bread crumbs in a pinch and have also used poultry seasoning for a different take.

I give this 5 stars for concept, 1 star for taste so averaged it out to a 3. This is a good "base" to start with, because the mayo definitely keeps the chicken moist, so it's really easy to change it up and make it to your taste.

Regarding mayo, I smoke a lot of meat and when I use a rub I always use a coat of Mayo or yellow mustard for a base to hold my rub on. I dislike mustard very much. One day I was going to smoke two chickens. I thought I would try mustard and mayo just to see if there was a difference. After smoking them for 4 hours I could tell absolutely no difference in the taste of either chicken

I actually use non-fat milk instead of mayo - way less calories and same effect.  Coating sticks nicely to chicken, and it's super juicy when cooked. Also tried with chicken thighs, and it turned out even better.

I made a few changes- 1) Instead of mayo- mix a little olive oil together with plain greek yogurt to coat the chicken. 2) I used crushed up goldfish crackers, parmesean cheese, plain (not Italian seasoned) panko bread crumbs and garlic seasoning for the breading. 3) Once coated with bread crumb mix, I drizzled the top of the chicken with real butter.  Everyone LOVED it!

Awesome recipe with some changes.  The key to this recipe is to preheat your oven to 450 degrees.  Nice browning and crispy coating if the oven is hot enough.  I used Helman's mayo, I mixed in with the 1/2 cup mayo some shredded parmesan  cheese (2-3T),  a small clove of garlic minced, 1/4tsp onion powder, freshly  ground pepper and let it sit at room temp for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile  I sliced each breast (I used 2 large boneless breasts)  into 4 equally thick portions and pounded each to an equal thickness.  In a shallow dish I put in a cup and a half of Panko bread crumbs  with freshly ground pepper.  I also sprayed a glass 9x12 inch pan with cooking spray.  
I spread the mayo mix on each chicken breast and then pressed it into the panko on both sides, and then onto the glass pan.  I repeated until all the chicken was coated.  The chicken baked 15 minutes and then I flipped it over and baked for another 15 minutes.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside.  My husband and I loved it.  We will make this again, next time I might add a couple of drops of hot pepper sauce but this recipe is really good without it.

Its ok, this dish has some flavor but same time very plain tasting so, could be better in flavor!!!

I've made this dish though with rather mayo, i used eggs , along with the bread crumbs and I put small pieces of butter (not alot) on top of bread crumbs,  just before putting dish into oven and O M G. I also season the  egg too, that helps!!!

I made this last night for the first time, for a big dinner party!  This is definitely my new favorite recipe.  I put the mayo with some dry  ranch dressing mix to taste, in a Zip-Lock bag and squished it to mix.  Then I used tongs to add the breasts one at a time to the mayo mix in the bag, squished it to lightly coat the chicken, used the tongs again to remove it and roll it in Panko crumbs with some paprika for color, then put it on a foil-lined cookie sheet and baked for an hour at 400.  It was SO good, crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside, looked great on a serving platter, and everyone loved it.  You could actually thin the mayo slightly if you wanted, it'll still coat the meat and make the Panko cling.  I think you could also use this for pork chops and maybe even firm fish -- I plan to give it a try!

PS:  I didn't grease the pan, it was fine without that.

This was great! And you do not have to use traditional mayo. I used a product called "Just Mayo" that I love. It's gluten free, egg free and cholesterol free. You can get it at whole foods and sometimes Costco. It tastes better than mayo in my opinion, and is so much better for you. For the crust I used a combination of regular and panko crumbs. I added italian seasoning to them and freshly grated parmesan. I also sprinkled additional parmesan on top of the breasts before baking them. Superb! My whole family (3 picky males) loved it.

My family liked it, I liked it, I usually go for spicy chicken well, but this was good. I did add some seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder and some parmesan cheese. I think that did the trick, kids ate it, I paired it with a chicken flavored rice, and all was good.

I did add a little italian dressing to mayo.  added romano or parmesan cheese and chef prudhome chicken seasoning, salt and pepper to panko seasoned breadcrumbs.  the 30 minute cook time is perfect. used gloves to put a very light coating of mayo mixture - did everything in the cooking pan - simple cleanup

Took everyone's advice on adding more species, used some Goya adobo (a must almost on everything), garlic, and dried basil leaves. It's heaven on a plate!

This is so good and easy... only thing I did differently was marinate the chicken in some Italian dressing and season with Mrs. Dash Herb and Garlic seasoning and some Zatarain's creole seasoning.  And also seasoned up the bread crumbs with this and used 1/2 Panko bread crumbs and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs.  Try it, you will love it.  Also, I cut the chicken breasts into strips.. that way, you get more of the seasonings and coatings.

Love how simple this is to make and how moist the mayo makes it. I added lemon pepper and dried chopped onions to give it extra flavor and crunchiness.  Served it over garlic mashed potatoes.  Fabulous!

This IS amazing, really!  Not only is it quick and easy, but it is delicious.  I am so happy I "stumbled" upon this recipe, because I needed to prepare a chicken dish in a hurry, and this had a minimum of ingredients, nothing outlandish on the list, and would be done quickly.  While I was defrosting the frozen chicken breasts in cold water for a quick picnic lunch, my husband worried that the guests wouldn't be able to cut the whole breasts on skimpy picnic plates.  Hence, the idea to cut the cutlets into bite size pieces before proceeding to follow the recipe.  (cut down on the cooking time).  FANTASTIC!  Chicken nuggets with real chicken!!  Everybody loved them, adults and kids alike.  Thank you Karriecarlyle.  A keeper if ever there was one!

I love this recipe because it's quick and easy. For a different version instead of bread crumbs try any of your favorite potato chips crunched up into small pieces in a zip bag. I've used the sour cream and onion flavor or barbecue flavored chips and my husband loved them, also used chicken cut into strips. Either way it's a big hit in my book, and the best part is the kids like it too.

One of my very favorites. Agree with the others who spice up the breadcrumbs and/or mayo. Try cooking the breasts on a cooling rack (placed on a baking sheet) to get the undersides crispier. Yumm!!!

The flavor was very tasty, the chicken very moist...but all the coating on the bottom was mushy.  I used panko crumbs and expected crispy chicken.  Has anyone put the chicken on a rack in the pan?  I will definitely try this again...so easy!

Using mayo is the most delicous idea since sliced bread. I wish everyone know what they were missing. I sometimes add parm cheese to the mayo. We don't eat this too often because sometime I forget about it. (using all of my eggs to coat some dang chicken, lol)

This recipe is a hit at my house. So much so, my neighbors tried it as well. I make it by this recipe, but I've also tried it with pork and added a little ranch powder to the mayo. It's wonderful. It can be a little on the bland side, so I added the salt and pepper and some garlic to the mayo instead of on the chicken and it worked better. 

Nice quick meal if you don't have a whole lot of time to worry over supper! Thanks!

My husband really liked it and that was awesome! I did find the chicken on the bottom got soggy and there was liquid in the bottom of the pan. Not sure if that is because I had just defrost the chicken?  Anyway, my husband's very picky but he loved this!

I had this at 3 stars from my first try.  After taking advice and adding my own spices (garlic and onion powder, salt, parmesan) to plain breadcrumbs, and spraying the top of the chicken with cooking spray, I'll give this 4 stars.

This was amazing! Mayo holds the breadcrumbs on much better than egg and keeps it moist. I did make changes. I added cayenne and garlic to the mayo. I had plain breadcrumbs so I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, cayenne, onion powder, salt, pepper, and Parmesan. I love a lot of flavor. I know this would be great without all of the extras though, so 5 stars it is!

Look at all the pictures of this recipe to see the range of results. You can tell how easy it is to end up with a pasty, irregular crust (no offense to anyone; it happened to me to). Be careful not to use too much mayo or you'll end up with a gloppy layer between your chicken and breadcrumbs. If you must turn during baking, be careful because the crust detaches very easily. That said, it's a cool technique and I'll try it again. In addition to the things mentioned above, I recommend marinating in buttermilk and adding your preferred seasonings to the mayonaise.

At first I thought this is going to suck but since I have had good success with Allrecipes before I went with it. I first brined the chicken in a salt water mix with 4 tablespoons of oilive oil for about a half hour. the i patted dry. Then lightly salted and heavily peppered before bread crumb. I also used hellmans olive oil mayo, I used half regular brear crumb and half italien. 

It was fantastic!!! Give it a try

Great recipe. My husband doesn't even like mayo, but he couldn't even tell there was mayo in it! Only thing I did differently is I used Kraft Mayo made with olive oil and cracked pepper. The flavor was wonderful!

Very easy to make and delicious!  I added the following to the mayo: garlic powder, cayenne red pepper, paprika, oregano and italian seasoning. The seasonings definitely helped and did not over power it. The chicken was very moist and tasty. Next time I will cook it for 20 to 25 mins.

Very good, sprayed top of chicken with pam, like others suggested.  Bottom of chicken was a bit soggy, but still a good taste, thanks.

Made this for lunch today... what a great recipe! The mayo makes it SO moist. I added paprika to the mayo and some pepper flakes to the breadcrumbs, and it turned out spicy and perfect. Will definitely make again!

This is my go to recipe when I'm rushed for time.   I always add grated parmesan to mine.  I've tried lemon pepper seasoning and that's very good too.

The chicken definitely stayed moist but it was a bit bland. I will probably try making it again in part because it was so easy to make. Next time I will definitely add some extra spices to liven things up.

Use a very thin layer of mayo or else the topping will be gooey, not crispy. Also, I have used baconnaise (mayo with scallions and bacon mixed in) and it came out with a wonderful smokey flavor. It comes out tasty, just a bit plain, with regular mayo as well.

Absolutely delicious. Tweaking it a bit I mixed miracle whip with a bit of creole seasoning and let sit for a bit. Coated the chicken (I used boneless thighs) then dipped it in a mixture of crunchy onions and breadcrumbs. Baked the thighs on a baking stone at 400 for about 40 mins. My husband says definately 5+ stars.

I added crushed cornflakes to the bread crumbs for a crunchier topping and cooked at a lower temp (350), and it turned out fabulous!  Hubby loved it too and he hates mayo (I just didn't tell him it was in there)  ;-)

Ok, I do have to say that this turned out pretty dang good. This chicken was moist and tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The only problem I had was that it was kind of bland. This wasn't a really big problem because the chicken itself was so good. We just got out the hot sauce and ranch dressing and it tasted great. Next time, I  will add some spices to the mayo and the bread coating. Thanks for the recipe! I would have never thought to use mayo!

This was really good and really easy. It was definitely a strange recipe to make, it seems weird coating the chicken with mayonnaise but it turned out very yummy. The chicken was moist and flavorful, I added garlic and onion powders for some flavor as well. My husband said he would ask for this again.

The moistest and juiciest chicken I've ever made.. add spices before the mayonnaise layer (don't add too much salt as the mayo and bread crumbs add salt). So good!

I am giving this 5 starts but I lessened the mayo and added parmezan cheese and garlic and onion powder and oregeno. It was delicious!

This was just ok.  It was a little bland but it was nice and moist so that was good.  We mixed it with some rice/spices and so it helped with the flavoring.  I would recommend adding more flavor to the mayo somehow before cooking.

When I first tried this recipe I thought it is to easy to be good.  We love it and now have it all the time.  I put my Montreal Chicken Spice with the bread crumbs and instead of Mayo I sometimes use Ranch Salad Dressing.  We love it and it is SOOOO Easy.

I think this was an excellent recipe and much healthier then frying.   I added some dried onions..grated cheese and garlic powder..to the panko and wheat bread crumbs that i used.    It was very moist and tasty.

Great recipe!  The chicken is very moist. For variations I have used plain yogurt (not vanilla!!) instead of mayo and crushed club crackers when I didn't have bread crumbs - added a little pepper and salt!  My family loves it that way too!

This was super good.  I didn't measure, I just spread some mayo on  (just enough to barely cover) and dipped it in the bread crumbs.  I did add some dry ranch powder to the bread crumbs like someone suggested.  I was scraping the pan clean when it was done.

It is definitely better if you add extra seasonings and parmesan to the breadcrumbs, but the mayo makes this chicken delish either way. 30 minutes on 425 was perfect, I broiled it for a minute on each side afterward just to crisp it up a little.

This was a great base for some really tastey chicken! I added 1/4 C garlic/tomato pasta sauce to light mayo, and added a spinkle of basil. I also friend this in 1/4 C vegitable oil. I also used chicken thighs, bc I needed to get rid of them. Turned out great! Will make again and again.  ::::UPDATE:::::Okay, I made this a second time and it turned out even better! I added about 1/4 Cup Marzetti Ranch Dressing (mmm) to the mayo, and seasoned ground saltine crackers with garlic salt, italian seasonings, and pepper. I sprinkled the breaded chicken tenderloins with swiss cheese, and sprayed with butter cooking spray to give it some crunch. It was great! Served with rice and salad.

I took this basic recipe and made it awesome! I've made it before exactly the way instructed and it was very good. However this last time I took the chicken breast and baked it at 350 for 30 mins and the last 10 mins I topped with 1 cup prego and mozz cheese. This ended up being the best chicken parm I've ever eaten.

Easy and tasty!  Bake it on a wire rack over a baking sheet to crisp up both sides.  Also feel free to spice up the mayo with garlic powder, onion powder, parmesan or a pinch of cayenne.  Delicious!

Normally, I don't prefer chicken; however, prepared this way is very, very good.  You don't taste the mayo at all, but it sure holds in the moisture, and gives it great flavor, along with the breadcrumbs.  Thanks for this recipe!!

Made this for dinner. I got great reviews from my boyfriend :) 
it was easy to make and and little to clean up afterwards.
The chicken came out juicy and went perfect with mash potatoes and a tomato&cucumber salas

This was amazingly easy to make though not amazing in taste.  I added several seasonings to the bread crumbs (paprika, garlic powder, cajun seasoning) but was not that impressed with the results.

This is an amazingly simple tasty dish.

I will always make this recipe, of course I'd rather make fried chicken (when I have the time!). I love how it requires no egg and is so simple yet is really tasty; the chicken is really juicy!!

Next time I'm gonna put lemon pepper in the bread crumbs.

As others have suggested spraying the tops with pam does make it crunchier.The cooking time should really be 35 mins, maybe thats just me. I'm pretty sure anyone would enjoy this recipe, only down side is messy prep ... it's worth it though.

These are good. I used reduced-fat mayo, marinated the chicken (lightly salted) in garlic for a few hours, and didn't flip the chicken while they were baking (usually the breading gets really messed up from that).

So easy to prepare and absolutely delicious! My entire family was impressed and couldn't believe it only has 3 ingredients. The italian flavored bread crumbs give it an awesome flavor. I seasoned my chicken tenders with sea salt and a little pepper before dipping them in the mayo. I will make this again for sure!

I loved this recipe, and so did my boyfriend. I did cut the chicken into strips and seasoned them with salt, pepper and oregano before coating them in mayo and bread crumbs (I used Smart Balance mayo). We used marinara sauce for dipping. Perfect for chicken parmesan. Will be making again, thanks for sharing!

Absolutely amazing. If you use chicken strips instead it tastes like chicken tenders, I put the oven to 300 and cooked only for 20 min in this case. I have made this three times now, twice for my family, once for friends. My Friend usually HATES chicken, but loved it. It always comes out very moist which is hard to do with Chicken. It's so easy to make and nice to know you can spend more time on sides etc. WONDERFUL!! Thanks for sharing this recipe that will be making for years to come.

Great chicken. I used already Italian seasoned chicken, the kinda that comes pre-portioned (I can't think of the brand that makes it). It still came out great. I still continue to make it!

This was super good.  I only made  two slight changes.  First I used Reduced Fat Miracle Whip and second a used a little Rance Dressing mix with the Miracle Whip.  Super good and moist.  My 8 year old made most of it with very little help.

I love this!  Chicken is my least favorite meat and I ate more of it prepared this way than I ever have in one sitting! I also added the ranch seasoning.  Absolutely delicious! Thank you for such an easy delicious chicken recipe.

Very good and easy. I cooked it a little too long (the time it stated on the recipe was too long for the chicken breasts that I used).  It went well with scalloped potatoes.

Surprisingly tasty for something so simple. It was really fast to make. This time I spread the mayo on with a knife but next time I might just roll the chicken in it and then shake it with the breadcrumbs in a bag to go even faster. The mayo kept the chicken really moist, and I can imagine you could get different flavors by using various dressings instead. The cooking time was just right and needed no modification. I served it with stuffing and broccoli on the side.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Super moist chicken. I used the Italian breadcrumbs and added some Parmesean cheese. My four year old loves to help cook and this was a fun one for her.

I found this to be really bland. Mayo is wonderful becasue it keeps the chicken tender when you bake it but it needs A LOT more seasoning. I have another recipe when you coat the chicken and in mayo like this but use a pack of the lipton beefy onion soup mix sprinkle on top then pat in and bake the same way...now that one is a huge hit at our house!

Can't taste the mayo. Chicken was all right - not dry, but not terribly moist, either. Probably will not make this again, unless I really tweak it.

Very easy. I did 2/3 mayo and 1/3 ranch dressing. As suggested, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese and chili powder over the top. Cooked for 35 minutes and it came out perfect. Not the best, but the best in a time crunch. My picky daughter loved it.

So quick and easy! Definitely hanging on to this recipe.  I looked at a few other reviews and added a little Parmesan cheese and only put breadcrumbs on the top side of the chicken and it turned out just great.

This makes one heck of a chicken parmagiana!  I made it as stated, other than I only coated one side of the chicken (we find the bottom only goes soggy anyways), so I only used about 1/2 the miracle whip and breadcrumbs called for.  Top with mozza the last 5 min and serve with your fave pasta and sauce!  Delicioso!

Very tasty. I can't give it 5 stars though because it's a little soggy the next day, and with just the two of us I look for good leftovers when I bake chicken.

As other reviewers suggested, I added seasonings to the mayo. The chicken was delicious and moist, but a bit too greasy. I think next time I'll use less mayo to avoid that. However, for simplicity and taste, this recipe is an excellent choice!

This was SO good and very tender, too, more tender than my chicken breasts usually turn out. I fed it to my family, one of whom hates mayo with a passion, and they both asked for seconds. I served it with a big fluffy batch of garlic mashed potatoes and buttermilk biscuits and was asked to make it again, by both hubby and my toddler.

After reading the reviews, I made a few additions.  I used panko instead of Italian breadcrumbs and added Italian dressing mix.  To the mayo, I added some Italian seasoning, onion, garlic salt and pepper.  I coated the chicken with a thin layer of mayonaise and served it with a side of pasta with garlic and oil.  It was delicious.  My husband was shocked at how good it was and I will be adding this easy recipe to my rotation.

The recipe tasted wonderful - thanks to the hints found here, I added garlic, red pepper and Mrs. Dash lemon-garlic seasoning to the mayo.  However, while the chicken was moist, it finished cooking before breadcrumbs could brown, leaving us with extremely soggy chicken.  For that reason, I'm not 100% sure I'd make it again.

i have to admit, i was really leary about this recipe....mayo and chicken but then i got to thinking about chicken salad and how that's made so i figured what the heck, let's give this a shot, that and i don't have a whole lot in my kitchen food wise at the moment!!!  Anywho, I am a huge cajun spice girl, my husband and I love things kinda spicy, so i added that along with some garlic and salt and cayenne pepper to my italian bread crumbs.  it was awesome!  i was so excited....served it up with some broccoli and cheese and it was fabulous!  filled us up!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Oh yeah, this was good.  If anyone is thinking they don't want to try this recipe because they are afraid it will taste like mayo, let me put that fear to rest...your chicken won't taste like mayo but the mayo does contribute to a moist chicken filet which stays moist even when reheated.

Excellent.  I added about 1 Tbsp parmesan cheese to the mayo.  Hubby and I both loved it.  I used a thermometer rather than relying on time.  The chicken was perfect.  Moist and great tasting.  Will make this again when I need a quick and easy meal.  Thank you!

As some of the others said it was a bit bland, I mixed some cayenne and cumin into the mayo to spice it up a bit.  I only put about a tsp of each, but next time I will try adding even more.  I brushed the spicy mayo over the chicken and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  It was really tender and yummy.

Wouldn't quite say this dish was "Awesome" thought it sounded just too good to be true.  It makes ok chicken strips though, really helps keep the juicyness in.  But regaurdless you need some kind of dipping sauce or sauce on the side, it's just too boring and definately not amazing.

I usually do chicken thighs and breast pieces (with the bone, minus the skin) like this, and it comes out so moist and flavorful. Most times I mix mayo with italian dressing for the coating before the crumbs. Great recipe, and you really don't taste any mayonnaise flavor if you lightly coat the pieces.

Great name for this recipe! How could something so simple be so delicious?! I expected it to taste good b/c of the great reviews but when my family tried it, they were totally surprised at how yummy it was!  I doubled the recipe & I'm glad I did because we all ate this up!  I'm sure I will make this again often!!

It is easy to make and the mayonnaise gave it a good flavor.  Next time, I might even stuff the chicken when I make it.

I am always looking for easy recipes that taste good, and this one is tops!!!  I used Italian bread crumps and added garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  My husband loved this recipe.  I will definately put this on my regular list of recipes.

I read the other reviews and make chicken strips out of this.  I used smashed up seasoned croutons and added additional basil leaves, garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I tossed the strips in mayo and then tossed in the crumbs and baked on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes.  Not a smidgen was left!

Loved, loved , loved it!! So glad I tried it. 

I did change it a tad: I used chicken with it's skin and used the Italian style bread crumbs, also added just a pinch salt, some pepper and garlic powder.  Since the chicken had it's skin, I baked for a total of 1 hour, with the last 5 mins. on broil. It came out great! The only thing is, if you want to keep the bottom crispy do not add oil to the pan and use a pan with a rack.

I would make this every week if I could!!

I NEED TO ADD. You don't have to measure a thing, just slather mayo on the chicken and dip it in the crumbs! OH ON 350!

Very good! It had a nice flavor and came out very tender. We cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes instead of 424.

I had to make dinner rather quickly, so I decided on this recipe.  It was quick and easy to make, but I won't be making again.  I used miracle whip and added garlic powder and grated parmesan cheese to bread crumb mixture to try to give more flavor.  Chicken was slightly dry.

I was very impressed by this recipe. I am VERY new at cooking and this was not only fast & easy, but it was really good. I added some parmasean cheese & a little bit of garlic salt to the bread crumbs. I had it with some fettucini alfredo and it was PERFECT :)

My boyfriend was impressed =) Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

I wouldn't call the taste "amazing", but I would call the ease and speed of this recipe "amazing".  The chicken was pretty good....but, I will but will probably add some additional spices the next time I make it. Thanks for the quick recipe.  A definite keeper!

It's very nice if you add ground ginger and ground rosemary to the mayonnaise, and boosts the flavor tremendously.  Succulent chicken!

Nothing special about it.  The only saving grace was the pasta we had with it and a glass of wine.  We even put parmesan cheese on top for added flavor.  You can't taste the mayo but was a bland dish and don't see what is so "amazing" about it.

This recipe is AMAZING!  After AMAZING success with the original recipe, I tried this recipe several other times several other ways, all with great success:
1.  Cut the chicken breasts into strips and make breaded chicken strips out of them, they cook quite a bit faster and make an easy finger food.
2.  Pound the breasts thin.  They also cook faster and make delicious and moist patties for chicken sandwiches.
3.  Try this recipe with pork chops or fish fillets.  I have done both, and both ways came out just as excellent, tender, and moist as with chicken.

I've made this several times, and it's really quite good especially considering how simple it is to make. Last time I tried using plain yogurt instead of mayo, and actually liked it even better - I think the yogurt gives it more flavor (and also makes it lower fat!)

All I could taste was the italian breadcrumbs, even after spicing the mayo a little. So, it wasn't horrible, just no different then italian breaded chicken. Also, 30 minutes was way too long, so my chicken was dry and tough.

This was excellent! I added 1/2 cup of honey mustard to the mayo and I didn't have any italian seasoned bread crumbs so I added 1 cup of parmesan and some italian seasoning. It turned out great!
I'll be keeping this one in my recipe box!

I wish I had read some of the suggestions on here before making this, because it was more bland than any chicken I've ever made before.  Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but not nearly what I'd call amazing.  Needs additions.

I'm a college student and it's tough to find good recipes to feed one person, but this worked out perfectly.  It's quick and easy and only a few ingredients, which is the best part!

I loved this chicken. It turned out really moist inside. You don't need as much mayo or bread crumbs as the recipe suggests, I ended up just going by eye. Was good with rice as a meal, and cold out of the fridge the next day.

I used plain bread crumbs and added seasoning salt...

excellent basic recipe! i mixed a generous dose of garlic powder in with the fat-free mayo, then added parmesan cheese to the italian breadcrumbs. i also butter-sprayed (pam) the top of the chicken breasts once they were in the baking pan. 
i can see using this as a basis for chicken parmagiana, among other recipes. thank you karrie!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my husband and I both loved it. I cut down on the amount of ingredients since it was just for two people. I added parmesan cheese and chives to the bread crumbs. I served garlic mashed potatoes and a salad with it. This is a keeper for sure!

Great dish - I used fat free mayo and instead of Italian bread crumbs - I mixed 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and 1 1/2 plain bread crumbs with some Italian seasoning. It turned out great and very moist.

If you're looking for an easy, tasty chicken recipe - here it is!!  It just takes a few minutes to put together and is really yummy.  I only had plain bread crumbs, but I did mix in a packet of ranch dip/soup mix.  Great with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I used light mayo, I don't know if that made a difference.  You could not tast the mayo at all. I thought the chicken was good and very moist, but I didn't think it was amazing.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of Mayo I used some ranch dressing that was taking up space in the fridge. It worked wonderfully. This recipe is simple tasting, but very good.

I used Miracle Whip and added a little garlic powder to the crumbs. Delicious. I have also made this with plain crumbs and Mrs. Dash Original (mix at the rate of 1 tsp to 1 cup of crumbs.)

I really like this recipe. It is very easy to change to suit your tastes. I used bacon caesar dressing instead of mayo, and regular Italian seasoned bread crumbs. The chicken was juicy and the bread crumbs were slightly crispy, not soggy. I cut the breasts in half and it took 30 min. to cook.

This went over just so-so in our house.  The chicken is very moist.  The taste is very similar to chicken and stuffing, so if you are a stuffing fan this is probably a great recipe for you.  Unfortunately our family is big on stuffing.

The original recipe was kinda bland and soggy. I added 1 tsp. seasoned salt and a handful of crushed potato chips to the bread crumbs and cooked it for 45 minutes. It made the chicken crispier and gave it more flavor.

I agree with the others with this recipe being too bland.  I think the next time I make this I'm going to spice it up.  Plus, the bottom of the chicken breasts didn't get done.  Husband complained about them tasting like cream of wheat.

Not only was this easy to make it tasted wonderful. It has been a long time I had chicken that tasted like fried chicken without the oil.. My faimly does no like mayo at all and no one had any idea it was made with it.. I would recommend this to any one who enjoys a crispy chicken without the oil and mess...

Very EASY recipe. After reading other reviews I chose to add some spices to the bread crumbs: Thyme, Oregano Leaves, Garlic Salt and Black Pepper. I cooked it at 425 for ~40 minutes, uncovered. It was very moist and smelled delicious. My husband and son really liked it as well. Nice with rice.

THIS WAS SO EASY TO MAKE AND DELICIOUS! THE CHICKEN WAS REALLY MOIST AND FLAVORFUL..ONE LITTLE EXTRA I ADDED WAS THAT I SPRINKLED LEMON PEPPER ON THE CHICKEN RIGHT BEFORE BAKING AND I ALSO ADDED SOME TO THE BREAD CRUMBS. THIS WAS WONDERFUL AND DEFINITELY WILL BE MADE AGAIN, MY FAMILY LOVED IT..THANKS!

This recipe was just ok.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper before coating it with the mayo and bread crumbs.  I'm glad I added the seasonings because that was all the taste that there was to the recipe.  If I make it again I will add a sauce or roast veggies in the pan with it to boost the flavor.

Husband liked but didn't love; had to bribe the 5-year-old to eat it; 13-year-old decided to have a bag of Doritoes after eating a few bites. I thought it was fine however it lacked any true seasoning and definitely needed salt and pepper. I could see using this as a chicken parmesan dish with some marinara sauce and spaghetti. Messy. Chicken was incredibly tender and I thought the dish deserved more credit than what my kids thought. However, I will not make this again.

This recipe was great! Quick and easy although I did find it a bit messy to prepare and the chicken was a bit dry but I think the pieces I used were a bit too thick.  Will definitely make it again but will use thinner pieces of chicken and maybe try some of the suggestions of adding garlic.

It’s a wonderfully simple recipe that I’ve been making for decades. Coating the chicken with mayo does bring a bit of savory to the dish. My variations include using things like ground up Ritz crackers or corn flakes, or even Saltines. Seasoning depends on individual tastes. I like a little heat, so I use a Cajun seasoning like Slap Ya’ Mama. Cavender’s and Spike goes well and so does Ragin’ Cajun.

So yummy! I may try it with mayo and ranch dressing next time. My 15 year old son loved it. I thought there would be leftovers but nope...he ate it all!

Very good recipe. Even my picky eater liked it! However, I made it with 2 full-size breasts and I don't think I got the breadcrumb proportions right.  There should have been more to balance the mayo.

I followed others suggestions and added some seasonings to the mayo. Super easy and turned out great!  My chicken breasts were quite thick so did have to adjust cook time. Paired with risotto and rolls. Yum!!

This was easy and delicious!  Mayo keeps chicken moist and Italian bread crumbs make it soooo tasty!  Will be making this again and I shared ia pic and the recipe with my daughter.  She’s going to make it too!  A winner for me.

This is a keeper! Just add some seasonings to the mayo and the flavor is awesome and chicken so moist. Did 2 breasts and 15min each side was perfectly done.

Have made this with minor modifications:  add about 1 1/2 tsp.of curry powder to the mayonnaise.  I also added Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano to the bread crumbs.  Baked it for 25 mins at 400 and it was absolutely delicious!

This recipe is so easy and very good too. I am a lazy cook and look for easy tasty recipes for the family that I can bake and not fry. I followed others suggestions and added spices to the mayo like paprika, garlic, cayenne. I just slopped on the mayo no need to be precise and then coated it in panko. Sprayed the glass pan with Pam and added grated parmesan on top of the chicken and it was delicious, moist and crispy.

Made this exactly as written, was surprisingly not that impressed based on the high ratings it has received.  Seemed like a glorified shake & bake and tasted similar as well. Would not make again.  Not sure how we’ll use up the leftovers if at all.  Just seemed like a lot of work for little reward/flavor. Even after reading all of the reviews saying add more seasoning, I don’t believe we’ll make this again.

My family loves chicken and we eat it A LOT so it was nice to come across a different recipe for cutlets. I prefer to bake them and hate the mess of the egg wash and flour. This was easy to prepare and easy clean up. They were a hit for the grown ups and kids alike. I hahe a convection oven so I used the convection bake at 375 for 40 minutes and they turned out perfect. Nice and crunchy. I would recommend using a rack because the first time I made this the bottoms were a little soggy. Otherwise this recipe was great!

Very  good, tender.  I added italian dressing while thawing two large boneless chicken breasts.  Followed the rest of recipe as directed.  I used a meat thermometer due to thickness of the breasts to be sure they were done.  I will cook it again

I like this cooking method for chicken breasts. This is very moist but I think without added seasonings it is a little bland. I like to add seasonings to mayo including garlic, dry mustard, cayenne, etc. take your pick. I prefer Panko crumbs with added Parmesan. Serve breasts with lemon wedges. In my opinion, everything is better with lemon.

Super tasty and easy to make. Based on the recommendation made by many other reviewers, I jazzed up the mayo to make it more flavourful. 

In my case, I added tarragon, Italian seasoning, thyme, cracked black pepper and a little garlic powder. The end result was fantastic, juicy chicken.

I used skinless boneless thighs and panko crumbs because that is what I had on hand . This turned out tender and juicy. A nice quick meal especially since I wasn’t in the mood to cook.

Easy and delicious!  I took others advice and doctored the mayo with some Montreal Chicken Seasoning and a little onion salt.  I sprinkled some salt & pepper on the chicken, spread on the mayo mixture, rolled in Italian breadcrumbs and baked.  My husband hates mayo and still does not know I used it.  Big hit in my house!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious way to prepare chicken. I did switch it up a bit. I added a packet of each dressing to the bread crumbs and omitted any additional salt. I’m not a big fan of salt. The chicken tastes so good!

I wholehearteedly endorse mayo instead of egg. Eggs are $3 a dozen in Canada, so I have started to use mayo instead to bind the breadcrumbs . And I don't do Panko either - just dried bread ends.

And I don't bake these dishes when frying works just as well and is cheaper in energy.  I use canola oil to 1/4 inch in the skillet, heated very hot.

Pound chicken breasts very flat, apply thin coat of mayo and roll in crumbs. Fry a couple of minutes on either side in a hot, oiled skillet  for a delicious result.

This is delicious and makes a nice crunch on the outside.  It couldn't be easier and there are ways to lighten up the mayo if you want. It fits my requirements for favorite recipes: flavor, ease, and ingredients ready at hand.  It will be a standard in our house.

This was my 1st recipe made from Allrecipes and it worked out pretty well. I'm a cook by no means but this was SUPER simple to follow. I learned a few things that I can do better next time. I think the recipe is definitely open enough to allow cooking for home tastes. I used 3 whole chicken breasts and probably too small of a pan. I would recommend seasoning after breading the chicken. I used some Bold Chicken seasoning within breading, and followed by coating it with Cajun once in the pan. Instructions were clear & it didn't take much work to prepare. Overall, a good recipe I plan on tinkering with and perfecting for our home. Thanks OP!

Loved it!  I didn’t have enough bread crumbs so I added in some garbanzo flour and tapioca starch. My boyfriend HATES mayo but I didn’t tell him how I made it, and he thought it was fantastic! Keeps the chicken really moist. I’ll definitely make this again!

This was pretty great; nice and fast with good flavor. I had dinner on the table in the time it took to make the mashed potatoes I served as a side dish. I used plain bread crumbs, seasoned with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and parmesan cheese, and I didn't really "measure" anything, so I doubt I used as much mayo and crumbs as the recipe calls for.

TRIED TO FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY

AMAZING, INDEED. Do not let your picky kid watch you make this is all I have to say. They don't need to know the thing they hate (mayo) is part of what makes their favorite chicken.

For an everyday quick school-night dinner, this is a great meat dish - very simple and flavorful.  I sliced the big thick chicken breasts in half to make two thinner filets so that they would cook quicker and more evenly, and smeared the mayo on with the back of a spoon.  I checked the oven at about 18-20 min. and they were done.  They were perfect, with a crispy crust.  I added Cavender's Greek seasoning, my favorite go-to spice blend.  I will make again, as the kids and parents ate them all up!

Simple, quick and moist. Delicious! I consider it a base recipe which can stand alone. But you can spice it up with other seasonings. I will make this often.

This lives up to it's name ..... simple, tasty, and consistent.
After putting on the mayo I elected to add a few sprinkles of garlic pepper and cayenne then rolled it in the parmesan and panko crumbs. 30 minutes at 425 is perfect. I also elected to let them rest covered for a few minutes. DELICIOUS!!!
NOTE: The second time I made this I switched over to a cast iron skillet ......... NOT a good decision ..... dried it out!! Stay with a shallow baking dish like the recipe says!!!

Definitely  an easy recipe.  I do season  the chicken breasts before coating  with the mayo.  Use salt, pepper, and a rib seasoning from  Famous Dave's.  I also use Kraft parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs.  Have made this several times and has been delicious every time.  I make sure the chicken is not too thick and cut the thicker ones in half,  season them and pound them with a meat mallet.  I bake them at 350 so they do not dry out.  A great meal and very easy to make.

I agree with the person who said it is too bland. It easy to make though. Next time I'll add a little onion and garlic powder, maybe some Parmesan cheese to the crumbs.

This easy recipe really lives up to it's name. The chicken turned out tender and delicious. I seasoned with Everglades Seasoning and black pepper. I let that sit on the chicken for awhile before adding the mayo and bread crumbs. A definite keeper that I will be making again.

Really delicious and so easy. I cooked it at 380 degrees and used chicken tenders. Also, turned them over when they were almost done and finished under the broiler. Will definitely make again.

I liked it. Simple, easy to put together however a little messy. I did use a rack instead of a baking sheet because I wanted it to be crispy. It was crispy but the chicken was a little dry.

Make sure you use the wire rack as mentioned in the video, or the bottom will be soggy.

Used natural yogurt and added cilantro  to the crumbs marinated chicken for a few hours in lime juice and used chicken thighs with bone in no skin.  Easy and wonderful!

I have been making this for 30 years, but we add 2 T. dijon mustard to the mayo and spread that. Then top with breadcrumbs mixed with fresh grated parmesan. Add you S&P and any other spices you like to the crumbs! :-)  Also great using butter crackers instead of bread crumbs - over the top.

My Mom made this for years, many years ago.  But she always added a good tablespoon at least of Dijon mustard-- I think really improves the flavor.

We had this yesterday for lunch. I used Hellmans mayo, and Panko bread crumbs, it was a big hit with my husband, and our neighbors. Great flavor!

I’ve made it numerous times it’s really good. I found it on the back of the Helmans mayo jar but they say to add Parmesan cheese and that really gives it that extra element that really makes it. I usually serve it with some small red potatoes that are cut up and baked in the oven with garlic, pepper ect.

Moist and so flavorful thanks, in large part, to the mayonnaise. I add grated Parmesan cheese along with minced garlic and Italian seasoning. I serve with garlic mashed potatoes or pasta with pesto and a simply dressed salad. Everyone loves it!

I am giving this 4 stars because I have been doing this for a few years, BUT using bottled ranch dressing (NV).  Giving a seasoning punch at the same time leaving the chicken very moist.

I make this so often that I started playing around with it and have come up with these alternatives:
instead of mayo, use your favorite creamy salad dressing; ours is bacon and ranch dressing, but a south of the border spicy ranch is also terrific.
add a grated cheese that corresponds to the salad dressing--smoky bacon cheddar is terrific with bacon ranch.
grate onion and garlic and add to the mayo.
add parmesan to mayo and add in Mrs Dash's garlic herb.
add blue cheese crumbles to mayo, add in a dash of hot sauce, voila, wings chicken.

I have made this and I have also made the version with  parmesan cheese and some plain panko bread crumbs. I prefer the parmesan and panko version better than this, but both are good and easy. Great weeknight dinner with a veg and a salad.

This recipe works great with baked fish as well, if you want a little spice just add a little Frank's to the mayo (Miracle Whip works too).

Made as directed.  If you want to improve this (in my opinion), add a little fresh lemon juice to the mayo and then roll in crushed almonds) - lots healthier too

The mayo adds a moisture to the chicken, plus the breading sticks better.  Also add some parmesan cheese to breading for added flavor. Serve with a little  warm pasta sauce on side

Been making this for years, and is always a favorite. I always use a basting brush to get a thin even layer of Mayo. Also experiment with other flavors. Try plain breadcrumbs with Creole seasoning and rosemary. Or crushed crackers and crumbled cooked bacon. Use a bag to shake the coating onto the chicken. Also, great with drumsticks.

Use Miracle Whip instead of Mayo a lot more flavor and sprinkle shredded Parmesan cheese on before the bread crumbs or in the bread crumbs.

I, too, have been making this for years. Besides adding different spices to  mayo, you can use different things. I've used creamy Italian dressing or a condensed soup undiluted. I like the cheese soup, cream of asparagus, etc. I will add a little spice to those also but it nicely changes the flavor profile. The variations are limitless

I made this a long time ago, but I realized I never wrote a review. I LOVED this! This is coming from some who strongly dislikes chicken as well. I was a bit weirded out by the mayonnaise at first, but oh man... It was truly amazing chicken. I'd definitely eat chicken more often if it always tasted like this.

As-is, this is super easy, quick, and probably has as much flavor as kids want. But definitely read the reviews for tips on how to amp up the flavor if you want something more! I added onion powder and garlic powder and rotisserie chicken seasoning to the  mayo, and used plain panko breadcrumbs, but it was still kind of bland for me. Might make again but with even more seasoning...

This is a favorite in our house. We make it different every time, sometimes adding bacon crumbles, or cheese, extra spices... it always comes out great. We especially like adding wing sauce or Sriracha to the mayo.

I lightly covered the chicken with mayo and put the chicken in a bag of the garlic herb bread crumbs.  For large chicken breasts you want to cook it for 45 minutes.  The chicken is so tender and juicy.  I will be making this again.

My family LOVED this recipe, I've made it twice now and it definitely will be a go-to dinner in our home. After reading through the comments I made some changes. I cut the breasts in half length wise, added some dry ranch dressing mix to the mayo and to the breadcrumbs, added a couple of dashes of onion powder to the mayo, and added some parmesan to the mayo and the breadcrumbs. This the best chicken I have ever eaten, It comes out of the oven juicy, flavorful and perfect. I cannot rave about it enough.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I substituted Ranch Dressing for the mayo.  Very good!

I guess I should have read the reviews first. This chicken had no taste and was not crispy at all. I probably used too much mayo and way too few seasonings.

Moist, delicious chicken. I followed the recipe and 
 made a few additions based on all of the reviews I read.  I cut the bread crumb mixture by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese in its place.  To the mayo I added a clove of garlic (minced), 1/4 tsp of dried basil and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Followed all other directions and the chicken turned out fantastic. I had a lot of the bread crumb mixture left over and some of the mayo too. Next time I would decrease the amount of bread crumbs I use and maybe try  spreading the mayo on a tiny bit thicker.... I don't want a mushy crust. I will probably play around with the spices I add to the mayo as well. Great recipe and very versatile!!

We loved this recipe! I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, ranch seasoning, garlic powder and paprika. I used less mayo and add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and turned out delicious. I baked it covered with aluminum foil and it wasn't crispy, but the flavor was there. I am doing this tonight but using legs and thighs and cook them uncovered. My husband loved the recipe and me too!!!

I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed it.  I  sprinkled seasonings and panko bread crumbs on the chicken right in the baking pan to save on mess.  I turned the chicken half way through the baking process.  It turned out great.  Crunchy outside, and very moist inside.

Great recipe, in fact I'm making it right now.  I agree with the reviewers to add some spices.  I added olive oil, chicken herbs and garlic salt.  Easy recipe that turns out very well and is now in the regular rotation.

This was delicious, and amazingly simple!  Following other reviewers suggestions, I sprinkled the chicken breast with other spices - Creole Seasoning, garlic powder, and cayenne before covering with mayo and breadcrumbs.  I lightly sprayed the top with oil (as suggested), and then baked for 30 minutes.  The outside was crispy, and the inside juicy.  I will definitely make this again. Just for variety, I might try other spices, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added spicy brown mustard and some Tony's seasoning and didn't use Italian bread crumbs. I used organic bread crumbs and added seasoning to it. Mmmmm!!!

Turned out great! Used boneless skinless thighs and drumsticks. Used previous reviewer's suggestion and spread a thin layer of light mayo using a silicone brush. Used panko crumbs, creole seasoning and salt. Sprayed afterward with non stick spray before baking. Used aluminum foil on baking sheet for easy cleanup. This recipe definitely going in the rotation!

Company good, and so easy! I prefer the chicken breasts not be too thick for consistent and thorough cooking--slice through them lengthwise if needed.

GREAT EASY.  This is truly easy and flavourfull with some added spices. I added Italian spice and onion flakes to mayo, 
and panko breaded.  I lost a little crust crumb when wanted to flip so didn't on some and were still crispy. Check out what you decide to do? Still good and crispy. Broiled last minute.
Make again.

This was wonderful!  I needed something quick and tasty and this fit the bill.  The change I needed to make was that I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo since I never buy Mayo.  I used Progressive Italian bread crumbs and cooked it for 30 minutes.  It needed an additional 5 minutes to have the juices run clear and when I tasted it - it was so juicy and moist and tender.  I will definitely make this again.

Well, it tastes good.  First time, I baked it in the wrong dish - an 8x8 pyrex (just the 2 of us).  The breadcrumbs fell off and didn't get very crispy, so at the end I put on the broiler, for just a minute or two.  This time, I used a sheet pan.  When I turned the breasts over, breadcrumbs fell off again!  I realize the recipe doesn't say to turn the breasts, but several reviewers recommended it, so there you are.  I will try it again and not turn, because I think this recipe is a good one, it is just flawed by operator error!!!

I think this was the second time I've made this chicken, with the same results as the first time - husband said it tasted good but it was soggy on the bottom and not very crispy on the top.  If I make this again, I will heat a couple of tablespoons of canola oil in the baking dish, add the chicken to the hot oil and turn it mid-way in the baking time.  This should be crispy and more like oven-fried chicken.

I made this chicken and lightened up the recipe by using fat free mayo since we are on diet and I added in Parmesan to the bread crumbs and it was awesome. Highly recommend.

This is really a good, quick chicken recipe.
 As others indicated in their reviews, I also added 
seasoning  besides just the salt and pepper. I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning, Hungarian paprika and  a small amount of crushed red pepper flakes. The mayonnaise is a bit messy to work with.

Lined the pan with non-stick foil.  Doubled the recipe and cut chicken into fingers before coating in mayo and Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  As my husband was making some Stove Top, he threw some of those larger toasted bread crumbs into the mix and everyone liked those pieces even better!  Next time will season the mayo and try using some  crushed cornflakes.

the other night I had absolutely NO idea what to make for dinner, and had total brain drain for any ideas..then this recipe popped up...I knew by reading it, that with our tastes, it would be on the bland side, so 'doctored' the mayo a bit with granulated garlic, pepper, and a good pinch of cayenne...also put some parm reggiano on top of the breaded pieces before going in the oven..this was really good, easy, fast, and something I will definitely make again!

I, have been making my chicken like this for years !   Even whole chicken works wonders.  This measure holds in the moisture in the chicken makes it tasty also.  I, highly recommend this method.

Followed advice from others here and kicked up my mayo with a squirt of sriracha sauce.  As well, I added some dry basil, oregano and fresh grated parmesan to a mix of panko and ordinary bread crumbs.  I brined my chicken breasts in the fridge over night .  Baked @ 425 for 25 minutes and they turned out "zippy", tender and juicy.  My wife loved this as well.  I will make again.

Mix in 1/2 parmesan cheese  to the mayo. Spread over chicken. Top with Italian bread crumbs and more parm cheese. Bake @ 400 for 20 minutes. I pound my breasts slightly before topping.

This  is a great, basic recipe technique that may be adapted in many ways. Very easy as written so a great recipe for beginner cooks. More crumbs than are necessary - I just sprinkle on some panko crumbs. Add other flavours as desired - I often add finely chopped peppers for example. One can make it gluten free by omitting the crumbs, or by using gluten free panko crumbs. It is the mayo that creates a moisture barrier. I sometimes use a mayo-yogurt blend, or chipotle mayo with a bit of shredded cheese on top.

I tweaked, again ! Since I don't like "mayo",  I used creamy Italian dressing, and a touch of wasabi powder, it was great ! Next time I think I'll try using a ginger spice flavored Chinese dipping sauce !

I have made this for years but a friend made it a little different and I like it better.  Instead of bread crumbs, use finely chopped rice crispies or corn flakes with more seasonings by choice.  All are great and the mayo keeps it very moist!

Using mayo makes this chicken super moist and the bread crumbs make it crispy on the outside.  I added some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs, before coating the chicken, and it turned out mmm good!

Yum! Used Italian bread crumbs with some parm cheese mixed in.  (Called for amount is too much: use 1/2 c bread crumbs and 1/4 c. parm cheese). Also added garlic powder, onion powder and oregano. Sprayed nonstick spray on the crumb-covered pieces just before putting in oven. Flipped halfway through baking and sprayed the upturned side. (next time don't flip- rips off the breading) Baked at 425 for a total of 50 min because the breasts were thicker.

This chicken really is amazing!! I thought it was a strange but smart combination, not the healthiest by any means but the taste is so worth it! I used regular and extra crunchy shake 'n bake. Depending on how much chicken you are using, make sure you have a sufficient amount of mayo and shake 'n bake. As tempting as it is to really pack on the shake 'n bake, I noticed it was better to keep it at a regular layered coat and not over do it. It is really rich and filling as you can imagine. Delicious! Family and I loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Best chicken ever and so easy.  I wonder if anyone has tried this with Miracle Whip instead of mayo?  Either way the chicken is so moist and wonderful I will probably never cook chicken breast in any other way.

I made this and it was great.  I would add a couple of different spices for variation.

Very easy to make and everyone cleaned off their plates. I used Lite house Caesar dressing instead of Mayo and added some Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs. Definitely will make again!

This was very good.  Next time I will follow other reviewers suggestions and add paresan and spices to the mayo mixture, use a basting brush to spread a thin layer (4 Tbs total), and then sprinkle the bread crumbs (1 cup total) on after placing in a foil covered baking sheet.  Excellent recipe, thank you

This was not a hit at my house.  It tasted very bland even though I took other reviewers advice and seasoned the mayo before putting it on.  Came out dry and boring.  Still looking for a Winner Chicken Dinner....

This was a hit with my family!  I did pretty much as Georgia did by adding garlic powder, paprika plus a bit of cayenne to the mayo and stirred it well.  I also added freshly grated Parmesan and cooked 10 then flipped and did another 10.  Perfect!!!  I will make this again and again trying different spice combinations.

I made this and the family loved it.!  I did cook for 15 min uncovered and then I sprayed PAM over the chicken and put loose foil over the top for the next 15 or 20 min so  the bread crumbs would not burn.  Also I mixed the mayo with ranch dressing and I didn't have any bread crumbs. So I put StoveTop stuffing mix in my grinder and used that.  It was perfect!  The stuffing had just the right spice.  Put that over a bed of oil flavored pasta and a side salad.

We make this a lot.  I've found that I can crush Chex cereals ( I combine at least 2 different varieties) in place of the bread crumbs, this becomes gluten-free !!!  Goes over well with all ages.

Didn't add extra spices, but it was still delicious! Just like someone else wrote, I didn't measure the mayonnaise or bread crumbs (and definitely used less than the recipe calls for).

Loved it!  Everyone gobbled it up.  Used chicken quarters (which I am not a huge fan of anyway) and they turned out moist and juicy.  Added a few extra seasonings to the bread crumb mixture, per our tastes.  A super easy, quick chicken recipe!  Thanks for posting

It was delicious! I added half of a ranch packet to the mayo and parmesan to the bread crumbs. Loved the texture of the crumbs! My husband was a little scared of the mayonnaise, but he was sold once he took a bite!

Made this for my weekly dinner with my neighbors. Like everyone else I added some of my own spices to the breadcrumbs and then topped it with a very little amount of parmesan cheese for the last five minutes of baking. Very juicy, good flavor. My picky eater in the group had seconds.

We sprinkled the chicken with Cavender's Greek seasoning before coating with mayonnaise, and we added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  Fabulous!

I made just like the recipe calls for. I used thin sliced chicken breasts. Turned back out great, chicken very moist..... I have made this same recipe but using crushed Doritos instead of  bread crumbs-yummy!! Thanks for sharing-

Tried adding some more spices and it turned out a little salty.  Will back off on garlic salt AND Lawry's together next time.  One spice with salt in it is enough .  The Chicken was excellent; very moist and tender.  Will make again.  Did not flip half way through like some reviewers did and it turned out great.  30 mins @ 425-Bang you're done!!

This is very easy and very adaptable. Make it plain for picky eaters or add spices you like. I added thyme, rosemary, oregano, smoked paprika (about a tsp each) and a bit of chili powder. Tasted great. Crispy outside, tender and juicy inside. Will make it again.

Yes I will make it again!  I used panko crumbs and seasoned them with galic powder and grated parmesan cheese. I skimped on the mayo but added garlic powder, salt and pepper before coating the chicken breasts. The last 15 min.  I added more grated parmesan cheese and  bacon crumbles to finish it off.  It was moist inside crunchy on the outside, looked very appealing to the eye and was a hit!!!

this recipe is so easy, you can have your kids help.. they will enjoy all the gooey fun! I have used this recipe several times now,, trying different seasonings... taco seasoning,  cayjun spice, and just basil and garlic. any flavor works well . the chicken is tender and juicy. bit I find that it does need more spice that the recipe calls for,, so don't be afraid to add your fave a little heavy, with the exception of salt. also I have used full bone-in chicken, in all cuts, just make sure to cook it thoroughly.

Delicious! The mayo keeps the chicken very moist, my fiancé was amazed. Did add extra spices. This will be a go to recipe for those evenings when time to cook is at a premium.

I brined 8 boneless, skinless chicken tenders for about 36 hours (brine was 2T Kosher salt dissolved in 2 c. water). Dried the chicken pieces on paper towels. Mixed about 1/3 c Mayo,  1/8 t cayenne, and about 1T Frank's Red Hot sauce in a bowl. Painted the mayo mixture in a thin layer on each piece; then covered with Panko crumbs; turned each piece over and repeated those 2 steps. I used a glass Pyrex 11"x14" dish,  sprayed the bottom of the dish with Pam, and also sprayed Pam on the chicken. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes, turned them over and sprayed Pam again on the chicken,  and continued baking for another 15-17 minutes. The heat from the Frank's and cayenne was subtle. Delicious, and I'll make this again and again! (You cannot taste the mayo, but it does keep the chicken moist!)

This recipe was awesome-so easy and tastes delicious. I'm not the cook in my family so I needed something that had few ingredients and sounded doable.  My husband was amazed and so was I.  This is definitely a recipe that a novice cook can make and wow the family.

Just in case you want to make this as a gluten free dish, you can crush rice or corn cereal (krispies or chex) to use instead of Italian bread crumbs, add Italian seasoning herbs, garlic and onion powder if you like, and grated Parmesan (shaker) cheese to make it all melt together as a crispy, baked coating. Use the mayo if you want but just pressing the chicken pieces into the dry mix works just fine.

Easy and excellent recipe.  I've also made it the same way with
ranch or blue cheese dressing eliminating the mayonnaise.  I always use Italian seasoning, garlic powder and season salt especially if I use Panko breadcrumbs. Sometime I cut the whole chicken breast vertically and enjoy chicken chunks.

This is one of those recipes that is easy to play around with, using what you have on hand. It's simple, quick, and tastes great.  Good food doesn't need to be complicated.  My kids loved it.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo, and added parmesan cheese & garlic powder.  Highly recommended!!

I followed the recipe except I used thighs and drumsticks....Use a fork to be sure the juices run clear. I started at the 425 temp and reduced to 375 to give bone in pieces extra time to cook....Excellent and the family loved it! Will make it again. Thank you

Mayo was a surprise ingredient, but it really kept the chicken moist!!    The temp & time were spot-on perfect.     (to suit my needs, I doubled the recipe by adding 1 cup Panko and 1 cup shredded (not grated) Parmesan.     With angel hair & marinara, this was really delicious!). MUCH thanks to KARRIECARLYLE!

Amazing chicken is right! Incredibly simple yet so delicious and so moist. The mayo must be the key. I made as the recipe called but added a few more spices and used inexpensive 4C seasoned bread crumbs which seemed to give it just the right kick. Best baked chicken I have ever made!

This dish was really good, the chicken breasts were so moist and delicious.  We had it with a light salad and mushrooms.

Yes--we would make it again

I have been making this for years since my son came home from university and told me he made it all the time!  His tweak which makes it enormously better is to use ranch dressing instead of plain mayo!  Any flavour!

Great, simple recipe. Seasonings are easily customized.
My mom made this a lot when I was a kid. For a change in taste, she would sometimes use 1/2 mayo - 1/2 mustard, or ranch dressing, in place of the mayo.
I have made this for my family many times too, cutting it into chicken strips which the kids love, and then cooks in 20 min or less.

This was AMAZING with just a few modifications. The 30 mins at  425 degrees was spot on.  I blended mayo with Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Spread, and used Panko crumbs mixed with Garlic and Onion Powder to add flavor. Perfecto!  Loved this and will make it again.

I've been making this for several years BUT,for those who think it's band, try this: mix the bread crumbs ( I use zesty or Italian flavored) with some grated Parmesan,. Aldo to mayo you can add season salt, garlic  and or onion powder. Also try either fines herbs or Italian seasoning . Tastes fantastic . Also, I use half Pablo sometimes...extra crunch. For those who think they REALLY HATE mayo....Greek yogurt works just as well.

I've made this for years, but add the "secret" ingredients that elevates it a bit IMO.  I take real shredded parmesan and pulse  it (3-5 quick pulses) through my mini food processor.  Incorporate the now finely grounded cheese into the Italian bread crumbs, adding a generous sprinkle of garlic salt.  (Note:  Approximately 2 parts bread crumbs to 1 part cheese). 
Also - here's a tip for making it easier to "apply" the mayo - I add small amounts of olive oil to the mayo and stir until it's a thinner consistency.

Nice a juicy. Could not even taste a hint of the Mayo. Add your own spices or it will be very bland. Also, I recommend putting it under the broiler for a couple minutes to make the breading crunchy. Enjoy

The chicken was delicious and very moist. I made it exactly as the recipe has it (using unseasoned breadcrumbs and adding my own spices due to dairy allergies), though it took a few minutes longer to cook than the recommended time in the recipe. It's quick and easy, and it will be going into my usual recipe rotation!

I used crushed Caeser  salad croutons - was out of bread crumbs.  Less mayo and while it did need a bit more pop than my crumbs provided the breasts were juicy!  32 mins and probed at 158* then  they sat for five mins- I know poultry is recommended at 165* but yeah that pushes too dry for my taste.  I am just a husband hijacking my wife's page for dinner prep- hope she likes it too! Kids sure did and they would have freaked if they had seen MAYO!!! in the prep but they had seconds haahahah!

Super simple and tasty. Used olive oil mayo to lower the fat and it was just fine. The bottom burned a bit so next time I'm going to just coat the top with the crumbs and mayo.

I love all the tips to add flavor to the mayo. I added chipotle  adobo sauce. It was delicious! Thanks for the great week night recipe!

I made this and as others suggested, I used more seasonings.  It tasted really good, but it was a bit on the soggy side.  Maybe next time I'll cook it 5 or 10 more minutes.

This was very good overall! My only critique is that I was hoping the breading would be a little crispier. For the seasoning, I mixed Old Bay, garlic salt, pepper, and a little parmesan and a little Kirkland No-Salt seasoning. I liked this seasoning mixture! Quick and easy recipe-- would recommend

We did not care for this chicken at all. I even added garlic powder, onion powder and parsley, but it still was bland.  Sorry, but this recipe just did not work for us.

This is such a quick and easy weeknight meal. The mayonnaise helps keep the chicken moist and the breadcrumbs stick. So yummy!  The kids hate mayo, but they didn't even know it was in this recipe.  The only change I made to this was I added panko for extra crunch as well as some cayenne for a kick!

a couple of other hints...use spicy mayo for the base....also, use chicken tenders and cut into thirds before coating/ baking and you have an excellent topping for a salad meal!!!

I have been looking for a good recipe to ring the changes for Sunday dinner. I've tried a few baked chicken recipes but for some reason although they tasted nice they were a bit on the dry side.  However this was excellent, tasty and juicy. I did add as others had said some spices and Parmesan.  All plates were cleared.  Excellent and easy  to put together!  Thank you

Just found this recipe and will make it again.  My husband loves chicken thighs so next time I will try boneless skinless thighs..  Like the fact that it only takes 30 minutes.  Like some reviews said you can use anything you want to meet your tastes.

You can add me and my husband to the "loved it" group. I read through many of the reviews before I made this today. I added garlic salt and grated fresh parmesan to the mayo. I made sure to apply it thinly before breading it with a mixture of regular Italian seasoned and Panko Italian crumbs. I decided to follow the advice of a reviewr to use cooking spray (canola) on the bottom of the glass bake pan and on the top of the breaded chicken. It did help to crisp it up. Will defintely make again!

I did make a few changes.  I added a 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning and a chicken rub I often use when I bake. It was so good.  I'll make this easy recipe many more times.

This was a great chicken recipe! My mother used to marinate chicken in mayo so this reminded me of her and what made me try it. 
The only thing that I did was spicing up the mayo a tad bit. I put granulated onion, granulated garlic, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and some ground pepper. I marinated my chicken over 24 hours. I then eyeballed a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and I added some regular Parmesan in that mixture. Turned out so yummy! Easy and delicious for a busy weeknight. Taking the 30 minutes to cook this chicken was a lot easier and tastier than taking the 30 minutes to eat out. :)

This is so good and easy! I know if you're thinking of health you don't want to use mayo too often in recipes. I used a light coating and that was all it needed. This had a great texture, nice and crispy on the outside. I cooked it until nicely browned since that's how we like it. I used drumsticks and thighs as those are juicy pieces of chicken. I cooked for longer since these are bone in pieces.

This was very good.  After reading reviews, I added Old World Seasoning from Penzey's to mayo before spreading it on chicken.  Also, sprayed one side, cooked for 15 minutes, turned over, sprayed other side and then cooked additional 15 minutes.  It really did taste like fried chicken doing this.  Wish I would've remembered to add Parmesan to bread crumbs first, think it would've added to recipe.

We did half and half Italian breadcrumbs and Panko. Also, added some Dijon mustard and paprika. Gave it a little kick.

Moist, juicy, tender and tastey.  Will make this often.

This was a very good recipe. It turned out a little too salty for our taste so next time, I won't add salt. But otherwise, we thought it was really good and we used marinated chicken so that had good flavor too.

This WAS so easy and good!  I tried it exactly as written.  Next time, I will try adding other things, like Parmesan cheese or Ranch dry mix.  Or - I'll coat the chicken in Ranch dressing and then the breadcrumbs.  

I pounded the breasts to about 1/2" thick.  I was in a hurry and put them in with the potatoes - at 450*, on the bottom rack.  I was surprised they cooked through in about 20 - 25 minutes.

My husband and kids loved it.  Served it with roasted new potatoes (Yukon, red, purple) and roasted asparagus sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  We'll definitely be having this again!

I have been making this recipe for years. It was on a Hellmans Mayo jar. My kids loved it and now the grandkids love it. I have never added any extra spices. It is a great go too recipe when you are looking for something easy and quick to make.

I cut the chicken in half....other than that followed the recipe and it was a big hit with my family.  It just wasn't as crunchy as I was hoping but the chicken cooked to an awesome tenderness and it had great flavor. I did not measure a thing just dipped in mayo and  coated in the bread crumbs. It was very easy and a great meal. Thank you for a new way to cook chicken. Love it!!!!

I have made this chicken many times...sometimes using ranch in the place of the mayo and sometimes adding pecans or coconut to the bread crumbs. Love it.

This was a good recipe but I think using half Italian bread crumbs and half grated parmesan cheese for the breading made it great!.  I use the above when frying zucchine slices, egg plant, etc.  No salt is needed with the parmesan cheese adding so much flavor.

I read both negative and positive reviews. Our dish was very moist (cooked for 40 minutes at 375 F-thick breasts). The Panko I used was a bit salty and I did not add any salt. Next time, I'll buy a different Panko from Natural Grocers. I used the one I already had in the pantry. I added garlic powder, red flakes, and tarragon. Had great taste and will make again.

Been making it for yrs. Can make chicken parm from it too. Turn breasts over 1/2 way baking to crisp evenly. Can even add pkg of dry onion soup or grated cheese to vary recipe.

Substitute the mayo for low fat sour cream. Instead of cracker crumbs, use cheez-it crackers or corn flakes (make them into fine crumbs in the food processor)  and it is so very delicious, tender and lower in fat.  Also, I put a dollap of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter on each breast and it's even more crunchy and tasty.

It is even better adding 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the mayonnaise. I actually mix the mayo with the parmesan and spread only over the top of the chicken and sprinkle the seasoned bread crumbs over the top. Amazingly simple and a big hit at my house.

This is delicious. It's the recipe on the Hellman's Mayonnaise jar. I've made it many times and add a little parmesan cheese to the crumbs.

Excellent. I read the reviews and seasoned the bread crumbs which I usually do anyway. I use panko crumbs. The type seasoned already just doesn't seem enough. Doesn't dry out. Healthier than frying even with mayo.

Works well with sour cream instead of mayo as well.  I've also used crushed ritz crackers for the crust.  And as others said, tons of parmesan cheese and other spices.

This a great and quick recipe,  I have been making it for ages. 
to put some zap into the coating, I use grated parm .  I mix it with the mayo then sprinkle on the Italian bread crumbs.
I think this originally came from Hellmans Mayo.  Its a real winner with my family.

There is something about using mayo as the base that just works really well. It's so simple, fast and easy and so very good. I like to add a bit of herbs to my italian bread crumbs, but it's just good. I don't find that I need as much mayo -- just enough to coat the number of chicken breasts.

My husband loves this recipe.

For those who feel there's not enough flavor, try coating the chicken with  creamy Italian dressing instead of the mayonnaise.  The end result is a moist, more flavorful chicken.

Followed other people's suggestions and mixed my miracle whip with some paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. And I used planko italian herbs and then mixed that with some grated parmesan cheese. Did salt and pepper to each chicken breast then put thin layer of miracle whip. I let that marinate for an hour because I had to wait for my family to arrive. And then i rolled the breasts in the planko and baked for 30 min. It was great. fresh out of the oven it kind of tasted like a homemade breaded chicken nugget haha! but then after it cooled off it didnt taste like a chicken nugget. but def yummy.

This recipe doesn't require measuring. On top of the brushed-on mayo I sprinkled salt, pepper, greek seasoning, italian seasoning and lemon spice. Then came the bread crumbs and on top of that I sprayed olive oil.  I used thin chicken fillets so it only took 20 minutes.  Easy and tasty; what more could you ask for?

I stumbled across this recipe after a busy day and decided it was so simple, I had to try it. I added spicy mustard to the mayo, about 3 tablespoons. I also used panko breadcrumbs because it's all I had, and garlic and onion powder just because.

Made this way, I absolutely love this chicken, and since it is such a simple change I give the original recipe five stars!

I also pounded the chicken out to a uniform 3/4" which really helps it cook evenly and makes for a juicy, tender breast with a nice crunch on the coating.

I used panko bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of chicken seasoning. I followed every step of the recipe except I added a few things. I also dislike mayo but you really can't taste it! This chicken is delicious my whole family loved it. It was definitely not what I expected. Christy in Santa Ana, CA.

I'm not a big fan of Mayo but you cannot taste it at all.  I mixed some garlic salt and onion salt in 1/4 cup mayo..  and then used 1 1/2 cups of Italian breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese for the mix.  The chicken was VERY tender and yummy!

I bought a whole, free range chicken, cut it up and removed the skin. I patted it super-dry, then using my silicone basting brush, brushed on the mayo and rolled in Italian breadcrumbs. I forgot to season the chicken with salt and pepper, but it was still delicious. It browned so nicely! When my husband took his first bite and I heard his 'mmmmm' I knew this was a keeper! My son  loved it and said this can go on the weekly menu. Great and simple recipe!

I agree with everyone else add your own spice  to give it flavor, I added the mayoneese to the chicken after I seasoned it let it sit for an hour, then added bread crumbs.
I did use peanut oil and let the casserole sit in oven to heat the oil then place the chicken in hot casserole. It's the best chicken, thank you for sharing your recipe

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very easy to make.  But, I found it quite bland, and lacking flavor. I'm also not a big fan of mayo, and thought the Italian seasoned bread crumbs would mask the taste, but it did not. I do have to admit, the chicken was very moist and juicy. And, my husband and children enjoyed it.

Making this now, will update with the taste. I added eggs to the mayo and ranch dip powder to the breadcrumbs, then I topped with fresh grated Boars Head Imported Canadian Cheddar. Looks yummy and I haven't even baked it yet.

Been making this recipe for years because my family loves it. The only differences in place of the mayonnaise I use a salad dressing. I have used thousand island as well as creamy Italian for a little more zing. Depending on how spicy you like your chicken you use whatever salad dressing you prefer. I've only used the creamy type. I believe way back this recipe was used in Weight Watchers. However you prefer this does make a delicious dinner. I've always called it oven fried chicken.

This is so good! You can add whatever seasoning you like before/after you bread it. the thickness of the breadcrumbs is going to be determined by how much mayo you slather on them. Mine turned out really good. On the chicken I put salt, pepper, lemon-pepper, oregano, and garlic powder. It smelled amazing when it was cooking! I didn't measure I just did however much I felt like doing...on all of it! LOL! :)Husband loved it! :)

I liked it but I would add more seasoning as I like alot of flavor...Not to mention I'd add some creole seasoning for the extra kick it needs...

I've baked this several times now, it comes out very juicy.  It's the most guaranteed way to have tasty, moist chicken.

Excellent, easy, and fast meal. Only thing I did different is I sprinkled a packet of hidden valley ranch dip mix on top of the mayo before I added the bread crumbs then just a sprinkle of garlic salt. I think my 2 year old age just as much as I did he liked it so much.

This chicken was amazing!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I added some seasonings. To the breadcrumbs I added some Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, ground mustard, and garlic powder. I am not a fan of mayo and I thought that it really made the chicken moist and added some excellent flavoring. I also used Panko breadcrumbs and thought they made the breading nice and extra crispy. Thanks for a great recipe, I will def make this again and again!!

So easy & moist! I read other reviews & added some more spices( Mexene chili powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper). I also mixed mayo with a little dijon mustard-yum! Just use a thin layer of the mayonnaise/mixture-otherwise it becomes too mushy.
This recipe is so easy, you can make it with mexican spices, italian, etc... It has become a favorite of the family!

I used bone-in chicken breasts, and seasoned with pepper, seasoned salt, and garlic.  Came out delicious, juicy, and cooked perfectly.

This was so easy and so yummy. Simple ingredients that made a big taste. Will be making this again I'm sure. I made exactly as stated except I cut my breasts in half horizontally since they were very thick and I wanted them to cook evenly

The chicken is really good, but I made a few changes: I added some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, cut each chicken breast into half, and added a dash of cayenne. Great when eaten with chilli sauce.

Very juicy and flavorful.. my husband doesnt like mayo and he couldn't tell it was in the recipe. I only had plain panko crumbs so I added my own seasoning. I sometimes have a hard time with coated baked chicken coming out soggy, but this was quite crispy on the outside, I really think the mayo helped with that.

this was great!  I must admit I was a little leary with using the mayo - but oh wow!!  I used Panko bread crumbs which gave a nice crunch to the chicken.  Super easy to make, and with the addition of garlic and rosemary to the bread crumbs - a truly delicious dinner!  Served with roasted red potatos and sauteed beans. I will definetly make this again.

I cut the amount of soy sauce, added garlic and a little chili powder as suggested by other reviewers.  It tasted like a dish I used to eat when I was stationed in Japan: Teri-Mayo chicken and rice.  The chicken was juicy and my boyffriend really liked this chicken!

Use the Kraft Olive Oil Mayonnaise that has the cracked pepper in it...instead of bread crumbs crush up townhouse flip crackers that's cracker on one side and pretzel on the other makes for a great coating.

This is one of my favorite recipes for several reasons. It is simply one of the easiest main dishes to make. It is quite tasty. Even my kids, who seem to like nothing, enjoy this dish. A life saver when you don't feel like cooking.

Excellent!  The chicken was moist and delicious.  You can't taste the mayo and it was a big hit with the entire family.  As others did, I used plain breadcrumbs and added my own seasoning.
Definitely a recipe I'll use again.

The recipe definitely needs spices! i used all sorts of things, much like everyone else did. It's true! You can't taste the mayonaise one bit! Unfortunately I used a bit too much cayenne pepper in mine and it was SO SPICY!!! But it is delicious and 30 minutes is the perfect bakingn time. definitely making again!

This recipe was great for a throw together dinner.  the chichen came out perfect.  i used thick breasts so i did cut them in half, and mixed some jamaican jerk seosoning in the mayo prior to coating.  (next time i will try something with a little more fire such as hot sauce for flavor.)  i cooked for about 40-45 minutes.  great recipe.

Truly amazing chicken! Very simple and easy! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and season salt for my coating...you really can't taste the mayo either so don't worry about that part.

This was the easiest recipe ever.  I actually only had to cook the chicken for 25 minutes. 30 minutes would have caused the chicken to be dry.  It sounds really silly to add mayo to a baked chicken recipe, but the chicken didn't taste like mayo at all.  It was just really good, and really easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  Instead of using chicken, I used pork chops.  I also took advise of others and added some spices.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper, salt, pepper and garlic salt.  I added all of the spices to the mayo then rubbed on the chicken, then dipped in bread crumbs.  My hubby doesn't like new recipes, but he loved this one.  I'm making it again tonight, but I'm using chicken this time.

This is definitely true to its name! My 4, 5, and 6 year olds really enjoyed it and so did my 1 1/2 year old! So simple to make, I used Miracle Whip, can't even taste it really but its so moist. I always brine my chicken for at least 1/2 hour which helps the tenderness as well. Most definitely making this again!

If your tastebuds are NOT used to big flavor -- then take time to cook this.  I even added alittle bit of italian dressing to the mayonnaise when I coated it..-- couldnt taste either the mayo or the dressing.  I only lightly coated in bread crumbs.  Sorry but not nearly as flavorful as other recipes.  And NOT worth the fat/calories.

Can't get any easier than this - chicken was yummy and moist.  Adjust spices etc to your taste/ dish - perfect over veggies, rice, or pasta, next to baked mac n cheese, and even cold on a sandwich.

I have to say, for the minimal ingredients and speedy amount of time it took to throw this together, it's a true keeper.  I added parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs and baked 30 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed this chicken.  I followed the recipe to the bone, I just added some garlic salt before I put the mayonnaise on the chicken.  I thought it was really easy to make.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This chicken was truly "amazing".  My family asked that it be made again soon.  The only change I made was to toss in a few spices of my own, only because I typically cook that way.  I threw in some garlic powder and some mccormicks chicken seasoning.  The key to this is the mayo.  It makes for a tender meat.  Thaks for this great recipe!  It will be made again soon

So easy and tasty!!! I like to butterfly the chicken first, then add my own spices to the breadcrumbs. I baked with a slice of tomato on top with cheese, then served over pasta with marinara.

I used panko bread crumbs with some Italian seasoning since that's what I had on hand. Turned out very nicely.  DH actually liked it and complimented me.  He's quite picky and since we're newlyweds, I'm still figuring out what he likes.

I have to say that I was super skeptical about using the mayo but it was sooo yummy!!!  Even my picky 2yo dd asked for more.  This perfect becuase I was in the middle of moving and did not want to run to the market.  Thank you for this recipe.  I think I will have to put it into my weekly rotation!

It was a hit at my home. I used chicken wings and cook them for an hour. I did use my own season and season bread crumbs. I did not use much mayo. Chicken turn out juicy will for sure use this recipe again. And my 2 1/2 year old loved it as well

This chicken recipe was delicious and tasty. Although, quite messy and the chicken turned out a little tough. I did cook it a little over 30min, as I read 30min was too short. Next time, I will reduce it to 25min.  I used natural breadcrumbs, oregano, paprika, pepper, garlic/onion powder, and parsley flakes.   The breadcrumbs were really good, especially when crispy around the edges of the chicken.  I was disappointed that I did not notice any taste of mayo. Next time, I will add more.   Overall, good product.

I LOVED this chicken. My hubby hates mayo, so I didn't share the ingredients with him! I just eyeballed the ingredients. Also I didn't have enough of the bread crumbs, so I added Zatarain's cajun chicken frying mix. Excellent recipe...will definitely make again.

Easy to make.  I used chicken tenders and boneless thighs (thighs cut in half).  I mixed sour cream & mayo 50/50, added garlic salt, onion powder and crushed rosemary.  My family loves it.  Thanks for an easy alternative to all the dipping and pan frying in oil.

This wasn't a bad recipe because the chicken has a wonderful flavor to it.  However, my husband and I ate a lot of the "shake and bake" stuff growing up and this reminded us too much of it.  Good flavor just conjured up too many times of eating the same thing over and over and over as kids.

This is the best "oven-fried" style chicken I've ever had, and it's easy enough for my hubby to make. :)

This was ok. My roommate said it was really good, but I thought it tasted just a bit bland. I really like mayonnaise - I put it on EVERYTHING from sandwiches to hamburgers and hot dogs to dipping my fries in it. The mayo DID keep the chicken moist, but it needs something other than bread crumbs to be REALLY great. I will make it again, once I figure out what seasoning I can use to spice it up.

Super easy and quick recipie.  Next time I will preseason meat the day before and add additional seasoning to punch up the flavor.  Here in Louisiana, we are accustomed to highly seasoned foods, so I am used to having to "kicking it up a notch" after trying a new recipie.

Great recipe...the same one I use to make chicken roll ups. I butterfly the ckn breasts, pound them out to 1/4 inch. Spread them w/mustard, add sliced deli ham and deli cheese, then roll up. Coat in mayo, roll in bread crumbs w/parm and bake. Very moist and delicous. I usually make double or triple and freeze before  baking them.

Followed another reviewer's suggestion, and used ranch dressing mix, along with plain bread crumbs. It was pretty good, though the breading tasted kind of soggy and came off of the chicken.

Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had to use some crushed seasoned croutons since regular bread crumbs would have been too plain.  Otherwise, yes, this was very moist!

Just made this AMAZING chicken for dinner.  My husband is such a picky eater but he loved it.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Maybe I'll make it for my mother-in-law and wow her.  Thank you so much!

This was OK, but def. not amazing. I did add some cajun seasoning to the mayo, but the chicken was still just chicken in my opinion....nothing outstanding.  Maybe it would be better to pan fry it, but there are just too many better chicken recipes out there to worry about this one.

Great recipe for really moist chicken!.. I added some spices to my mayonnaise (cayenne, garlic salt, black pepper and onion powder).  I used the chicken tender strips and baked on a broiler pan for 22 minutes Everyone enjoyed them...

Very good.  The chicken is moist and tender.  I added herbs to the bread crumbs as others suggested.  It really boosted the flavor.  I also added parmesan cheese over the top at the end so it melted on top.

Delicious!  After reading the other reviews I changed a few things though.  I used the suggestion of putting half a packet of Ranch mix in with the mayo.  Instead of using bread crumbs, I took cheese & garlic croutons and smashed them up, then added about 3 tbls of Parmesan cheese.  I didn't use all the mayo, just enough to cover the chicken.  My husband & I both loved this and will def. be making it again...he even suggested I make it for his mother so it had to be good!

Very tasty!  I decided to just get messy and spread the mayo with my hands. I then sprinkled them generously with McCormick's Montreal Chicken seasoning and then the breadcrumbs.  I did broil them for a couple minutes at the end to crisp them up a bit more.  Yum!

One of my hubby's new favorite recipes!  Be sure to use regular mayo and not light mayo...seemed to be less crispy with the light.  try cutting the chicken into strips first fro yummy chicken fingers (and a quicker cook time!)  Also took suggestions of others and doctored up the bread crumbs and mayo with all purpose seasoning, garlic and Parmesan cheese.  Yum!

I used other reviewers advice and added my fave seasonings to my liking. Also did a thin layer of mayo. I added some pepper and McCormick grill mates garlic & onion medley seasoning about two tablespoons. This seasoning is so good everyone should try it!

Dry and flavorless. The mayo does not add any unique taste. There's no reason to use this recipe instead of doing the traditional flour, egg, and crumb breading. Does not add anything new or special to the taste of the chicken, and does not keep the chicken moist.

I gave this recipe four stars for how easy it was to make and how tender the chicken was. It didn't have a lot of flavor though. I will still keep it in my rotation and try to spice it up some next time. I thought a slice of tomatoe and a slice of swiss on top and under the broiler for a minute might be tasty and I could leave it plain for the kids!

My family really liked this recipe. Anytime I need breadcrumbs, I use the Italian blend. Makes everything have more flavor!

We didn't especially care for this. Maybe it's because of the Italian breadcrumbs, usually we are a pretty bland family. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious. I added onion and garlic powder, red and black pepper, and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

Very similar to my "oven fried chicken".  Very easy to make. For a little more flavor, I use ranch dressing instead of mayo. I also use cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I like to experiment with different crackers.  Right now I am on a "sociables" kick.  Lots of good flavored crackers out there to use in your recipes.

This is a very good recipe for baked chicken, my husband thought it sounded funny when I told him what I was doing, but it works! The chicken was very moist. I also made a few small modifications and added some parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the bread crumbs, turned out wonderful. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe will definitely be made again in my house. Very simple and quick to prepare. I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand, so I used crushed corn flakes and added some Italian seasoning and some parm cheese. The combo was great. The chicken was very moist and tasted great. One problem...the bottom of my chicken was soggy. Maybe next time I won't use as much mayo/crumbs on the bottom side.

This recipe also works very well with boneless pork chops. Make it the same way, just with a different kind of meat. I hate mayonnaise, too, but the taste is very subtle and the meal turns out very nicely.

I was worried to use this recipe because my husband hates mayonnaise. When I cooked this for the first time, we were pleasantly surprised with how tender the chicken was and the flavor. It is quick and easy and is now a regular in our house! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I liked this recipes a lot. I did cut the chicken into small pieces, so my kids would be more willing to taste it. They loved it, I used the olive oil mayo to reduce the calories and added some personal spices to the bread crumbs becasue we like things with a kick and added parmesian cheese, Thanks.

I've been making this for awhile prior to finding this recipe. I add Dijon mustard and fresh ground pepper to the mayo. I also use panko bread crumbs instead of the Italian ones. Much more flaky and doesn't take away from the flavor of the mayo/mustard coating. Yum!!!

Yummy! I used miracle whip instead of mayo, and it turned out great! The chicken was moist and tender, the whole family loved it! The only change I would make would be to add a little more seasoning to the bread crumbs. Will definitely make this again!

I have made this receipe 3 times and it always turns out great. It's so tender and juicy. Tastes just like fried chicken. I was skeptical about the mayonnaise but you can't even tell it's in the recipe. My husband hates mayonnaise and he hasn't even noticed. I won't share that little secret with him!

My whole family liked it when I made this. I just mixed the bread crumbs with some Montreal chicken seasoning. I would just recommend applying the mayo with a brush, because it's hard to make it even with your fingers!

I made this chicken tonight for me and my Fiancee. We both had our different opinions about it. I myself, loved it. I thought it was fantastic, but yet so simple. Her on the other hand, just thought it was "ok".

I have it 4 stars out of 5 because it was really good, but not the best.

I was very reluctant to use this recipe but had leftover mayo from a previous recipe I used. However, as previous posts claim, I could not even taste the mayo at all! I did add some of the recommended spices, such as a tad cayenne pepper, parmesan cheese and garlic. My husband said he'd add more garlic and cayenne pepper next time to add more flavor. But overall, it was very good. We both don't really like breaded chickens but didn't mind this one. Will make again!

Awesome flavor and so very moist too!  I made this chicken last night and served it over a bed of steel cut oats (cooked in chicken broth) with Cream of Fresh Asparagus II soup (from this site) drizzled over the top of it.  Needless to say, it was a great dinner!

Amazing it is.  I didn't have time to coat the chicken and dip it in the bread crumbs so I covered the chicken with mayo and topped it off with the bread crumbs.  It was amazing.  Everytime I make this everyone raves over it.

I can't say this was amazing, just thought it was o.k.  Tasted just like chicken coated in Italian-seasoned bread crumbs.  I can't tell what the mayo did...probably won't be making this again.

This was okay, but I will just dip mine in egg next time like I normally do-it's easier and the taste is not that different. I guess if I am ever out of eggs I would make this again.

I love this chicken and so does my mom. I took one reviewer's suggestion and sprayed cooking spray on the coating to make it crispier. The chicken was moist and tender. Definitely will be making again

For all the mayonnaise it's a pretty basic tasting chicken.  I might try to use some type of seasoning in the mayo next time for a little change. It's crunchy and moist, my toddlers loved this one!

This was okay, not amazing (and I did add some spices to kick it up). I'd pass this on to a "first time cook," but I will not make again.

I made this for dinner using thin sliced boneless pork chops instead of chinken. It was FANTASTIC. My 10yr old, who probably would have died if he know it had mayo in it absolutely loved it!!!

This was very good.  Not quite as tasty as when I do the flour, egg, breadcrumbs...then cook in olive oil on the stove, but much faster and much less cleanup.  My husband really couldn't tell the difference between the 2 different ways, and this chicken was super moist.  I would make this again if I didn't have time to make the traditional way or if I was feeling lazy.

I hate mayonnaise but thought I'd try this recipe due to the ease and limited ingredients which I had on hand. I added a generous dash of garlic powder, lemon pepper, and parmesan to the Italian crumbs. It turned out to be very moist and tasted like a fried chicken. I'll be making this one again.

Yep, this chicken is truly amazing!  I changed it up a bit by seasoning the chicken with adobo, sazon, and ground oregano before coating with mayo.  Since the chicken was already seasoned, I opted for plain breadcrumbs.  We had some family visiting and everyone loved this chicken - even all the kids.

This was good, I certainly wouldn't call it amazing chicken. Somthing seemed to be missing. I will try it again though, it was simple enough. Next time i will season the chicken a bit before putting on the mayo.

THIS WAS AMAZING IF you don't have time to marinate chicken, then this is an awesome recipe. It's juicy and tasty. I took some of the other members' advice and added some extra seasoning to the mixture, very good.

DELICIOUS!  My 4 year old LOVED it.  My husband, who prefers anything over chicken thought it was "really good".  I did not have Italian bread crumbs, so I used 1 cup of regular and three teaspoons Italian Seasoning from Pampered Chef.  After I put it in the oven, I realized I had forgotten to add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture, so I sprinkled it on top.  Then sprayed with PAM.  It was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside!YUMMY!

First time poster!  So glad to have found this chicken recipe!  My family says that this dish should be in a restaurant.. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used with garlic/butter texas toast croutons and made nuggets. Needless to say, this was a hit and we'll make again-

Very tasty!  My kids and husband enjoyed it.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so used regular and added some spices like garlic powder, dried onion, basil, oregano and salt and pepper. Plus added some Parmesan cheese I also cut up the pieces smaller so it would cook faster. Will make again for sure.

The only change I made to this was using Roasted Garlic & Savory Spices bread crumbs. It was the only bread crumbs I had in my pantry and it worked out great. Simple and tasty. A simple and yummy chicken recipe for the beginner. You should definitely try it.

I thought this was a very tasty dish, the chicken was cooked perfectly but my husband wasn't as much of a fan...he did say that he doesn't like breaded things so that may be why.  I loved it though.

Chicken turned out to be pretty dry due to all the bread crumbs (and I only used a cup instead of two).  It wasn't a total disaster but probably won't make it again.

This was a good chicken recipe; however, it was not extraordinary. The first few bites were really good, but it became rather bland as we kept eating. My family liked it though, so I will probably make it again sometime.

I've made this a few times, and my husband has declared it his new favorite meal. He calls it his comfort meal and asks for it every time hes feeling stressed or sad. Its also so easy to make. I made a few changes though. I had Parmesan bread crumbs so, i added some spices to it: garlic powder, lemon pepper, paprika, cajun seasoning, and then some Italian seasoing. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as my husband did not like it with the chicken breasts (he doesn't like white meat). I, however, thought it tasted great with the white meat and i am not a white meat fan. Great recipe that has become a family favorite! :)

Wow! I really had doubts this would work but it's fantastic! Can even tell it's mayo. Turns out tender and juicy. Thank you for a quick, easy, wonderful recipe!

I actually thought this was very good!! Even my picky 3 and 6 year olds ate it all.  I planned this at the last minute - had partially defrosted whole chicken breasts.   I did the mayo and crumbs, then sprinkled with Lawry's and at the end put some fresh parm on top.  It was very good, though it took 45-60 min., probably because the chicken breasts were still somewhat frozen - definitely a keeper!

This recipe is extremely easy. I added 1/2 a tablespoon of mustard and chili powder and pepper to the mayo. It was pretty flavorful however I thought the texture was a little gooey. I served it with salad but I think it would go really well with spaghetti. Tomato sauce would be good with it.

This wasn't "amazing" to me or my fiance. A more fitting name for this recipe is "Amazingly Easy Chicken." I guess you can say it's "amazing" considering the level of difficulty. I don't think I'll make this again.

Hmmmm, not sure what everyone is raving about.  To me it's just another breaded chicken recipe. I did add Parmesan as many recommended and I had to cut the time back to 25 mins because they were drying out.  Will keep searching.

This is a good basis for a chicken dinner. I tried this recipe with a slight alteration. I used cut up chicken quarters. My brother LOVED it!!! He had 2 helpings... 
And so did I and my mother. I am saving this recipe for future reference.

I followed the other reviewers' advice and punched up the recipe a bit by adding some seasonings. I sprinkled some garlic powder,Mrs.Dash table blend and some lemon pepper over the chicken. I also followed another reviewers advice with the dijon mustard but added instead 1tbl. sweet & hot mustard since that is what I had. I also added 1/4 cup of romano cheese to the mayo. It was very easy. I put the mayo mixture and the breadcrumb mixture on 2 separate coated paper plates and just tossed them when I was finished. The recipe wasn't bad at all..Just wasnt WOW factor for us. Would I make it again? If I was pressed for time maybe.The chicken was very moist, and we squeezed some lime juice over it before eating.I served with roasted potatoes and a salad.

Yay! I had ALL these ingredients on hand, and plenty of them! I love how there's only three ingredients - just one thing.. it was so messy! I had to use my hands for the mayonnaise and bread crumbs. Just a tip, make sure you put some bread crumbs on one side first, then go on to the next side so the bread crumbs dont fall off. If you're on a limited supply of breadcrumbs, you have to be extra careful because you will have unused breadcrumbs already mashed with the mayonnaise leftover (that you cant use!). My oven is kind of messed up, so I think it made the chicken a little worse. Also you should leave the chicken in longer. One of my mistakes.. otherwise, simple, cheap, good chicken! Love it

the rec. was great!  Simple, cheap and delicious!  No changes are needed and the chicken turned out so moist. We used whole chicken breasts so we had to cook longer but they didn't get crispy. Didn't even need a knife. Works best for whole breasts rather halves or even tenderloins.

Following some other tips I added some Italian seasoning and Garlic/Herb blend before coating with the mayonnaise - I used reduced fat mayonnaise with plain bread crumbs - turned out excellent and it's so easy.  Not terribly unhealthy either if you watch the mayo.  My wife also hates mayo and she loved this dish.

I had high hopes for this recipe with over 230 reviews.  However, I was disappointed.  It was not even close to amazing.  Although the chicken was very tender, and did not taste like mayonaise, it was very bland and needed much more spice.  I will not be making this again.

Easy to make. Moist chicken. But use a full coverage thin coat of the mayo - if you use too much the coating will be on the wet side. I like the coating browned more.

This is surprisingly good, the mayo makes the chicken SOOOO tender, I love mayo so I put extra on mine, but leave it a little lighter for the hubby.  Have made several times, everyone loves it.

What an excellent recipe!!  I actually just used it as a base and then added a few twists of my own:  For starters I used finely crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and added cajun spice as well as Cayan pepper (hubby and I love spicy food) then as if that wasn't spicey enough I added just about a table spoon or so of Kens Buffalo Wing sauce to the mayo mixture.  The result was incredible!!  It actually wasn't as spicy as you would think but it was as tender and juicy as chicken can be.  I'll be using this recipe again only next time I'll try it as others have suggested with maybe some added fresh garlic.

Both my husband and I loved this! The chicken was very moist, and this was so easy to make! I mixed in with the mayo some of Chef Paul Prudholms Poultry Magic to give it some spice. Will cut the bread crumbs in half next time I make this.

This recipe was great! I did add some minced onion, garlic powder, and oregano to the mayo to add some more flavor. We all had seconds:)

Just average.  It gets points for ease of preparation and moistness.  It loses points for blandness.  I added seasoning to the mayonnaise as some reviewers suggested, but it was still bland.  I might try it again with additional seasoning since it was so easy to make.

It was good and I am sure that it would of been amazing, I didn't know the last of the mayo had been used (kids) and had to use miracle whip. The chicken that was supposed to be used was not defrosted (kids again) so I had to use pork chops. Everyone loved the pork chops, I made the chicken over the weekend and actually got to follow the recipe and it was a hit.

As a cook who is still learning, this recipe is the best thing I have ever made. I added sugar, curry, onion powder and parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs. The only problem was I had WAY too many breadcrumbs with a lot left over. But the chicken was really, really, really good!

Love it!  I did this as chicken strips. I added garlic salt, and chili pepper to spice up the mayo. I used garlic and cheese crutons crushed together, and added a touch of parmesean to them.  
Quick - easy and tasted great - even the left overs!

This is on my list of 'oh no, what am I going to do about dinner' list of recipes.  SUPER easy, takes no time, and turns out moist and tasty everytime.  I vary the coating from time to time.  Sometimes just bread crumbs, sometimes with Italian seasoning, Greek is good, parmesean in with the mix is tasty too.

This was a great dish. I made it twice already, once with white rice and another time with alfredo pasta. I think it fit better with the rice, with the pasta it felt like a very heavy dish. But both instances were great.

This was just okay. I would have liked to have tasted more of the mayonnaise flavor. I did not see the point of even dipping the chicken in the mayo mixture if you could not taste it. Pretty good, but won't make again.

Yummy! This will be added to our list of favorite dishes! I took some of the advice from the other reviews and added a little bit of garlic powder, salt and pepper to the mayo and the result was delicious! 
Quick prep and easy to make!

This was great and couldn't be easier to make. Only thing I did different was add a couple dabs of butter on top of the breading on a couple pieces and used butter spray(you could use either or)on the rest, to give the chicken a nice golden brown appearance. Delish.

Really easy, fast.  I used dry commercial stuffing mix instead of seasoned bread crumbs.  The chicken stayed moist.  My kids ate it.

This is a very good recipe for being so quick and easy.  I made up the recipe without reading the reviews, then while waiting for the oven to preheat, I sat down and read the reviews.  At that point I got nervous and added parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, garlic salt and fresh ground pepper right on top of the chicken, then tossed it all together again right in the pan.  It turned out fine and was even better the next day for lunch.

This is very good. I would give it 4 stars but it's gets 5 for saving my life at the last minute when I had no idea what I was going to make for dinner. And it is true even if you do not like mayo, that will not affect this recipe. Recommended!!

I loved this recipe, but I added garlic powder and Emrill's essence to the bread crumbs, the 20 min into baking I drizzled barbecue sauce on the chicken!!  It was excellent.

Pretty good recipe that's obviously quick and easy. I made fresh breadcrumbs, added lots of herbs and spices and some parm. For more flavor, I added some dijon to the mayo. I baked on a rack so the bottom would crisp up and a spray of evoo on the top of the chicken helped crisp it up too. Chicken was nice and moist. Thanks Mike!

It sounded strange, but I gave it a try.  I loved it!  I like to mix some parmesan cheese in with the italian bread crumbs before baking.  It's a winner with the whole family every time I make it!

I wouldn't call this amazing, but it is quite good considering how quick and easy it is. This was the first time I tried making chicken with a crust other than this other special recipe that I use (thanks to mother-in-law), and it turned out pretty good. I've made it a few times now. Really, my only complaint is that it is never on the crispy side. Bread crumbs are hard to get crispy. But, it turns out very moist and my husband says that he likes it. Of course, he lies a lot when it comes to my cooking! But, I enjoy it. :)

This recipe was just okay. There were too many breadcrumbs in the recipe and the chicken came out dry and not much flavor. I probably won't make this again.

I was reluctant to try this, but it is really good.  I used panko crumbs and bumped up the spices.  It is very moist and tasty.  My husband loved it and you can't taste the mayonnaise.

I modified this recipe a little since I didn't have mayonnaise and bread crumbs on hand.  I used nonfat sour cream in place of the mayonnaise and panko inplace of the bread crumbs.  They turned out yummy and tender and just absolutely wonderful.  Great chicken recipe

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  My husband and I both really loved it.  I also mixed in cajun seasoning and a little cayenne with the bread crumbs for added flavor (and Cajun taste buds!)  I also cooked ours for about 45 minutes to cook it all the way through.

Nice and easy, even though I never do any cooking.  Don't tell people what's in it before they try it - they'll like it, and they'll be surprised when you tell them it's mayo!

This sounded like a great recipe, but I had no breadcrumbs.I was determined however, and crushed up some saltines, mixed in some bacon bits, dill seasoning, black pepper and a little montreal steak seasoning(i love that stuff)Also used ranch dressing along with the mayo, turned out GREAT!!!

This was a very good and easy to make recipe. I added a little bit of ranch dressing, and garlic to the mayo.  I also added some minced onions to the bread crumbs and put some swiss cheese on the top of the chicken about 10 minutes before it was done.  I will make again!

It was pretty good. I followed the advice of others and added seasonings to the braead crumbs and different seasonings to the chicken. I thought it was quite tasty and very moist. I used miracle whip which gave it a zing.

It was a great recipe... I just made it tonight but I read up on it and made my own seasoning for the bread crumb mixture. Medium amount of seasoning salt, pepper, and a generous amount of garlic Powder... It was great!!! It is going to be a must to cook for large outings...

College student who needs something quick, easy, and delicious.  This is a great recipe.  I add seasoning salt to the chicken before the mayo, and add parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs--both add soooo much flavor to the chicken.

Leftovers of this surprisingly simple and tasty A"mayonaise"ing Chicken still taste great after microwave reheating. Only difference: the mayo flavor, which is detectable in the original version, is a little less so when reheated.

this recipe was very easy to put together. although i found it too dry. the crumbs turned out nice, but i think it would probably be better fried.I will attempt this again, but will fry it and maybe add some more flavourings.

The chicken is nice and moist, but a bit too bland for our tastes.

Really good...I think I must have used too much mayo though because it really tasted like mayo.  Luckily I love mayo so it wasn't a problem.  Definately should try this if you like moist chicken.

I found this very dry and quite flavourless.  Very ordinary.

I tried this receipe tonight, added potato chips to italian bread crumbs, paprika and seasoned salt/pepper to mayo, and garlic powder to breading mixture.  I used frozen chicken tenders, thawed, and they cooked in 20 minutes.  It was very moist and lots of spice!

This recipe was "o.k." I cook chicken frequently, and was searching for something new and different. The thought of using mayo intrigued me, but I didn't get the final result that others have posted. It didn't taste bad, and we liked the taste, but I didn't think it was spectacular. To prevent your chicken from turning out too dry, do not cook it as long.

It was actually really dry. My husband and I both didnt like it, it seemed to be lacking flavor, not something i'd try again.

We did not enjoy this recipe at all. It makes a big mess and tastes exactly like shake and bake. If I ever do this one again I will add my own spices, it was way to bland.

I took the suggestions of others and added other seasonings... both to my chicken and to my bread crumbs.  They turned out good but not outstanding.  To me it seemed like any other breaded chicken recipes.
