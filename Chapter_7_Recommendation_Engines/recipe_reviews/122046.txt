Great basic recipe with a lot of room to play. Add whatever you like to your cornmeal such as ceyenne for kick or lemon pepper for extra bite. The only thing I did differently was that I did not use equal part flour to my cornmeal. I typically always use 2 parts cornmeal to 1 part flour in all of my frying but that is just a personal preference. This basic recipe is great for fried green tomatoes as well.

Like another said, this is an excellent foundation for Catfish. Just add your own spices if you want to add some zip to it.

I followed others advice and used more cornmeal than flour. I used 1/2 cup flour and 1 1/4 cups of cornmeal.

Since I wanted Cajun Catfish, I modified the pepper and salt to 1 TBSP each. Added 1 TBSP Cayenne pepper & Onion Powder and 2 TBSP Cajun Seasoning.

Turned out great for the kids. Next time I will increase the heat with more cayenne pepper and maybe add some paprika.

Delicious, basic fry. I would certainly say add any of your favorite spices if you consider yourself a spice-junkie!

The basics of the recipe are sound, it definitely needs more seasonings.  I added more garlic powder.  1/2tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Next time I will double it!
