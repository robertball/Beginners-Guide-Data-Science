A great base recipe, but I had to change a couple of things. One 4.75 oz. can of crab meat is the perfect amount and tastes better than the imitation crab would. I substituted 1/2 tsp. chili powder for the cumin b/c I'm not a fan of cumin. I skipped the salt. I also added a 1/4 cup of grated parmesean and a tsp. each of italian seasoning and onion powder. I highly recommend the parmesean-it added a great flavor. Next time I will try it with the sauted onions, as someone else suggested. Tasted great and will definately make again, but with the changes mentioned.

I chose this recipe because it looked simple and got good reviews. Well, it ended up tasting a just too plain and simple and I had to modify it by adding fresh tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic to turn it into a pasta sauce I could actually eat. I will not make this recipe again.

One of the best crab bisques I have ever had, definitely restaurant quality. However the exact recipe presented here looked a little bland so I added: 1 clove garlic, 2 jalapenos minced, 1/4 c. chives, 1 c. frozen corn, and substituted heavy cream for the milk.

This simple recipe needed some help. While I was able to reduce the fat by using skim milk, Campbell's "Healthy Choice" mushroom & tomato soups, it was too sweet for my taste. Juice from a lemon, along with diced garlic, red pepper, celery, mushroom and a spike of red pepper, added more depth to the flavor. It was great over brown rice!

This is a very simple and quick recipe but it needs some additional things to give it some taste. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  (It gave the soup a  nice consistency.)  Then I added two cloves of garlic, one small onion, some fresh red peppers - just a few small pieces, a can of corn, a drop of Worecestershire sauce, a dash of basil, two tbs of Old Bay Seasoning, fresh ground pepper, and just a dash of celery salt.  Season to taste.  I cooked on medium heat until it started to bubble, then I let is simmer for about 20 minutes.  It turned out delicious!  It's a keeper if you add the extras.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe!  Quick and easy!  I've made it twice now and definitely recommend using lump crabmeat instead of imitation.  Using cajun seasoning gives it a really nice kick.  Enjoy it with "everything" flatbread.

Well, after reading the reviews it looked like a "love it or hate it" recipe.  Not being one to shrink away from eclectic dishes, and since the ingredients weren't expensive, I thought I'd give this one a try.

And, I *liked* it!  Next time I'll saut√© some fresh mushrooms in a little butter and add them, and add just a dash more curry for extra zip.

For me? This is a keeper!

Very easy recipe.  We added some cream cheese to make it creamier.  It was a bit bland for me, but the kids loved it.  My husband and I added a few shakes of tabasco sauce and some season salt, then it was great.

Not impressed.  at all.  It tastes like exactly all it is: tomato and mushroom soup.  I even tried to add garlic to spice it up, and i still wasn't happy.  If you're going to try it, be prepared to add your favorite things to fix it: browned onions and garlic, spices, cream- good luck.

I was surprise by this recipe. It was quick and easy. I like my bisques to be a little thicker so I substituted heavy cream for the milk and it made it much creamer. 

TIP: Make sure your imitation crab is the texture that you want before adding to the soup. Plus, minced clams are a great addition!

We've never had crab bisque but my husband and I really enjoyed this particular dish. Used canned crab meat, added a bit of tabasco for kick, and salt for flavor... it turned out very nice. Very easy to make.

This is one mean crab bisque, despite the imitation crab meat, this ingenuis mix of mushroom and tomato soup was fast and easy to prepare. The soup was an instan hit with my family. Everyone loved it and it was so easy to dish out.

I used a can of condensed cream of celery soup and end result came out great! Glad I only used 8 oz of crab meat because I do not eat crab meat often and felt as though the crab flavor was hiding the tomato and celery flavors so I plan to use even less crab meat next time with the same amount of everything else. FYI for milk, 15 ounces = 1.8 cups. Also, before making soup I sauteed a handful of chopped red bell pepper, carrots and green onions. Thank you for a quick & tasty, versatile keeper!

This was wonderful with a chopped salad and french bread from my favorite restaurant.  I did "soup" this soup up a little bit, though, by adding 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. minced garlic from a jar.  I also used low fat milk, low fat cream cheese(per a previous suggestion), and I also added a leftover baked potato from the night before that I had diced up.  This was WONDERFUL with these additions.  However, I don't believe that I will be adding 1/2 tsp. of Italian Seasoning and will reduce this to 1/4 tsp. of Italian Seasoning instead.  The curry is a MUST in this recipe and do not skip out on this spice.  I will be adding this to my rotation of foods.  The best parts of this recipe are that it is very quick, delicious, and elegant.

I have made this recipe for social function s at church and it is always met by rave reviews. It is also highly requested. What I have done to personalize this recipe is to also add minced clams and baby shrimp along with the crab. To add an extra flare you can also add lobster. It makes it a total seafood bisque. Tastes Great!

Delicious and so easy! A bonus that it's all ingredients I typically have in the house. Good as is or can dress it up. I sauted some celery and garlic, added some cooking sherry and tabasco. A little on the sweet side but soooo good.

The tomatoe was a little overpowering, but once I upped the spices a bit it ended up balancing out. I would still recommend not using the full can, but at least 75% of it minimum. The pepper to taste should be 2 decent sprinkles over the pan, if the soup is bland add more pepper. I also didnt have curry so I used cayenne which worked quite well, about 2 pinches.
This can be done with any seafood I think, in fact it almost seemed like the crab was intruding on the soup and unneeded. It was quite yummy, my GF who is a chef recommended I add more pepper when she tried a spoon and that made it a lot better.
It was quite quick and easy too which is big in my books ;-)

This soup was just OK. I had to add alot of old bay and some red pepper flakes because it was kinda bland. I also added some heavy cream. I used imitation crab but maybe next time it would be better with fresh crab. What I did like about it was that it was quick to make and used ingredients that I've always got in my cabinet.

I've only had crab bisque a couple times before and it soon became a favorite of mine, so I was excited when I came across this easy recipe.  But after trying it, I've concluded that I will never make this again.   It's ruined, in my opinion, by condensed tomato soup, which overpowers the flavor of the whole soup.  I tried adding a bit of cayanne pepper and cheese, but could not cover the tomato soup flavor.  Next time I will find a more complex, time consuming recipe, because hopefully making everything from scratch will enhance the flavor.  I also can't stand imitation crab meat, but the real stuff is expensive, and totally not worth the cost for this cheap taste.

I really didn't like this soup. The tomato soup was very overpowering. I tried adding cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness, and some other herbs but there was no saving it. I couldn't even finish my bowl. It's in the fridge now, I'll give it another try because I hate wasting food, but I am not looking forward to finishing it :(

4 stars after I added almost half cup more of milk. Only other thing I changed was substituting condensed cream of celery soup in place of condensed cream of mushroom soup, with a flavorful end result, thank you!

Okay, so this is pretty much the opposite of a made-from-scratch bisque (which I've made before) - canned soups and not even real crab. Still, for what it is, I thought it was pretty tasty, and very easy to make. I made it exactly as written, and have one minor complaint: a whole bunch of green onions is way too much, in my opinion - half that amount would suffice.

I think this is a great idea for a base soup/sauce recipe.  I chose this because these were the exact ingredients I had left in my cabinet and wanted to use left over pasta so I used it as a sauce.  (Added seafood seasoning, diced tomato, and parmesan.)  I did use imitation crab meat as the recipe stated because I had some that needed to be used or tossed.  Great idea to mix cream of mushroom/tomato soup.  It all worked out!

Really easy, mine turned out very bland.I ended up adding whatever spices I could find in my cabinet to spice it up. Also, the imitation crabmeat fell apart in the soup. which made the crab seem sort of like noodles. (You know how imiatation crabmeat can unravel.)I recommend useing canned crabmeat instead.

I liked it. I used nonfat milk. Very simple, fast to prepare. The only negative was the nutritional information; This may make five servings but they would be very small servings and that holds down the calorie count. It really make more like three servings which would raise the calorie count from 217 to 362, which still isn't bad. The recipe doesn't say what kind of milk was used in the nutritional calculations.

Pretty good soup, soup-er easy to make. I added sauted onion and garlic, garlic tabasco and a handful of un-cooked instant rice plus some extra milk to accomodate the rice. I'm gonna put some in a thermos for when my gf and I go x-country skiing, she will think I'm a chef. (Chef Boyardee maybe!)

This was a great started recipe, but I never make a dish without adding a bit of my own preferences to it. 

I made a very zippy bisque by adding a liberal amount of Tony's Cajun Seasoning(I don't use measuring cups or spoons, so I did it to taste ... your preference may vary) along with a bit of minced garlic. 

I also added some parsley flakes and green onions for color, and some mozzarella cheese. The cheese was a great idea ... it lent a particularly good flavor to the whole dish. 

Lump crabmeat tastes better with this dish, in my opinion. 

Also, I tried to add some bulk and texture by sauteeing up some onions, celery, and mushrooms, and that made for a heartier, more satisfying soup. 

This recipe is a great template, and you shouldn't be afraid to alter it a bit to make it your own. Happy experimenting!

After mixing all ingredients, I add brandy or wine.  Sometimes, I add extra spices (to taste), such as basil, curry, chili powder, etc.  After all ingredients are mixed, I place it in a blender a little at a time.  Then, it has a creamy texture.  I then heat it on the stove.  When ready to server, I place a little crab meat on top.  All of my family and friends love this recipe and think I slave in the kitchen for hours.

I had some left over imitation crab meat and i wanted to use it before it got bad, and this sounded good, i estimated the amounts and it turned out pretty good.... but it was kinda plain, i dont know what crab bisque is supposed to taste like but it was okay if i make it again i probably wont put so much tomato soup in it and maybe some extra spices.

I didn't like this at all.  I added the real crab meat and only added half of the tomato soup from other suggestions, but it did not help.  I will not be making this again.  I LOVE bisque, but I don't like this at all.

One of my favorites.  I brown a some chopped onion in a small amount of butter first, right in the soup pot, then add the other ingredients.  This is so good with canned crab meat.

Very, very good. Having never had crab bisque before, I can't compare to other recipes, but this was a great soup.  I kept shaking in more curry and Old Bay and added a bit of white wine towards the end. I also used 1/2 can tomato to each can of mushroom, as per other reviews.  Guests loved it as did I.  Thanks!

After reading the reviews I wasn't sure whether to try it, but I am VERY glad I did.  This is an unusual soup with intriguing tastes, but it was VERY good and I will DEFINITELY make it again.

Very easy!  I used cream of chicken since I did not have cream of mushroom on hand.  I think next time, I will only add 1/2 a can of tomato soup- the whole can was a bit overwhelming.  Definitely a hit in our house!

I definitely would not recommend this one - we did not like this at all.  The tomato soup flavor overpowered everything else including the things I added on my own.  I think our dogs enjoyed it though!

I really loved this soup.  Quick and easy to make.  I had no curry powder so omitted that, but added a little parsley, and added one step:  I browned some chopped onion in a small amount of butter before adding the soups, milk, and (canned) crabmeat.  Delicious with French bread!  I'll be sure to make this for company.

I've made this recipe both for both myself and many friends.  Everyone has always given it excellent reviews!!!  I cut the crabmeat up into pieces in order to avoid the "stringing" effect others have noted, but that only happened when I used a lower-quality crabment.  The higher-quality ones are more dense and are less likely to fall apart, but taste about the same.  I have added quite a bit more of my favorite Tandori Curry Powder to give it more bite.  Absolutely Wonderful!!!

Really quick elegant soup.  I added a scant l/4 cup sherry, and a dash of cayenne, and about 1 T. dried chopped onion.  Really a good taste

Boy, you weren't kidding when you said this stuff was fast, easy, and delicious! I made it in no time when some guests dropped by unexpectedly, and they loved it! I served it as a main course, with lots of crusty bread, a big green salad, and a quick dessert. And you can't beat it for being low fat and filling at the same time! (I used skim milk, cutting the fat down to almost nothing.) I'll definitely be making this again.

WOW!!  I took pretty much the main recipe and added the tweaks that people below posted.  Cream of Mushroom, tomato and milk make a great base.  I chopped imitation crabmeat, added sauteed chopped onions and frozen corn.  I did a few shakes of chili powder and WOW!

Had to make this with what I had on hand - 12 oz package of condensed cream of mushroom, 8 oz package of ready to eat tomato soup, 1 cup cashew milk, and 4 oz jumbo lump crab meat. It made three (almost) 2-cup servings. I will definitely make again, perhaps with more spices to liven it up a bit.

Ok I didn't quite have the ingredients here but my modification recipe was nummah!  
Instead of mushroom soup, I used cream of potato, added one sliced celery stick (add early to soften) and instead of curry, added old bay, minced dry garlic, garlic salt, a few hairs of saffron and creole seasoning. I tossed in a pound of frozen imitation crab and dumped it in. Delish!

Would be a five but I had to adjust it. It's not crab bisque if you use imitation crab as this recipe calls for. Made per the recipe this is Pollock bisque. Use real lumped crab for a true crab bisque.

Still not like the bisques made with real cream and butter, but a good base. I sauted 1/2 minced onion in 1/4 cup real butter first, added 1/2 tsp. cajun spice. Then I added a can of crab meat, with juice. Simmered a couple minutes, added soups, a splash of milk and a splash of white wine.

This recipe was delicious, but I didn't follow the original recipe exactly...I used clam chowder soup, put about 1/2 milk and then 1/2 buttermilk in the mixture, I then added a dash of salt, some celery salt, and a bit of basil. I then added the rest of the ingredients as mentioned in the original recipe. It turned out great!

I have never had crab bisque.  If this is what it is supposed to taste like I'm glad I haven't. I used lump crab as others suggested.  I would stick with imitation crab.  Just did not care for the flavor of this. Won't make again.

Although it tasted nothing like other crab bisques I've had, it was a rather interesting soup.  Perhaps using cream of chicken would help, since the mushrooms seemed a bit out of place.  Will use as an alternative to regular tomato soup.

This was pretty good.  The tomato soup seemed to dominate the flavor a bit and it was a little on the bland side.  My boyfriend enjoyed it though.  It's worth making again.

This is an unusual soup, but it's very good. The blend of flavors is unexpected, but I will make this often in the future.  My daughter, age 11 (who doesn't like fish) enjoyed it too.  It was a nice surprise for all of us.  Only needed hot, fresh bread as an accompaniment.
