I had to make quite a few modifications to accomodate what I hand on hand, but this turned out pretty well. I used spaghetti instead of linguine, canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and 2 cups of low-fat milk in place of the whipping cream. I thickened the sauce with corn starch, which worked just fine. I also used dried basil and used quite a bit of black pepper in the sauce. Tasty and very fast to get on the table.

My family really enjoyed this.  An interesting variation is to add a cup of green peas; I also have added a quarter-cup of grated dry cheese (parmesan, romano, dry jack)  to the sauce or on top.  I recommend 1T butter and 1T olive oil for sauteeing the onion, garlic and shrooms.

Very good.  I did add 1 cup peas and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese as previously suggested.  It was a little dry.  So next time I would increase the whipping cream to 2 cups and/or decrease the amount of cheese.

We loved this recipe.  Not as heavy as alfredo sauce, but has great garlic and mushroom flavor.  I even found the recipe "Fettuccini with Mushroom, Ham and Rose Sauce" on allrecipe.com which had the same base recipe as this sauce - and we ended up trying 2 sauces for one meal.  This is a keeper.

My kids all liked this which was a miricle.  I made this lower fat by substituing skim milk for the whipping cream.  I thickened the sauce with 2 tsp of cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp of milk.

Not bad....I think it could use some more "spicing" up, but overall, pretty good.  I used the whole carton of whipping cream (2 cups) instead of what the recipe called for and I think that was just enough.  The dish wasn't dry at all (as previously posted by another reviewer)

Does need extra seasoning!! Regular milk + cornstarch worked fine to replace the cream.

way too much onion! But kind of bland--I added several good shakes of Parmesan, which helped. I don't think we'll make again

Made this for my husband who doesn't like red sauce, but loves mushrooms.  I used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh, and omitted the basil since I'm not a fan.  Really liked how tasty and easy the dish was.  Husband added salt, and I added a lot of pepper.

I don't think I'll try this recipe again without changing the sauce somewhat.  I felt like the sauce was missing something, but I'm not sure what. Thank you.

Read everyone's take on this and went ahead and added about 1/4 cup of sherry, used baby portabellas and a very nice pepper mix (a medley of ground peppers)  The pepper "spiced" it up a bit. This one is a keeper, thanks!

This recipe is quick and easy - and tasty. I used skim milk for part of the cream to lower the fat and turkey bacon for the ham, and it turned out great.

We enjoyed this recipe.  As others suggested, I added 1 cup of peas, 2 cups of whipping cream.  Additionally, I added 1/2 cup of sherry.  I will fix this again.

This was a big hit at my home. No leftovers means it was great! My boyfriend is Italian and he almost didn't leave enough for us. I used dried basil instead of fresh.

Loved this!  Very nice flavor and so easy. I subbed half & half for the cream, and the sauce was thinner, of course, but still excellent and fewer calories. Will definitely make this again.

Nice base.  I added 2 c. cream, 1 tsp chicken bouillon, a couple of splashes of dry sherry, and served over shells.  I liked the shells matching the chunkiness of the chopped veggies/ham.  Very tasty.  If I were serving fancier, I'd use the linguini and slice my veggies, rather than chop.  My goal was to get a tasty meal on the table quickly - using up leftover ham.  Very pleased.

Loved it! Family loved it too. I was out of basil so left that out.  Used half an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, 8 oz of mushrooms, doubled the cream, ham, and pasta. Used leftover spiral ham and added a cup of frozen peas.

My fiance and I were big fans of this one.  Its really easy to make, and tastes great, too.  When he came home and saw the recipe on the computer screen he laughed and asked if I ever reviewed the recipes I tried.  After he tasted it he told me, "Yeah, I'd eat this again.  I give it a four."  (Obviously, I agreed.)  I used leftover spiral cut ham and it gave it a really nice flavor.  It did seem like it took forever for the sauce to thicken but that was probably just my impatience talking.  That and maybe because I used light cream instead to cut down on the fat and calories.

Very good recipe, like this much better than linguine with alfredo sauce. I used fresh mushrooms and added extra. Made some crusty french bread, a great meal.
