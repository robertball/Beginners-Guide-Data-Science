I've been making this for at least a year now & it's our very favorite rice dish.  This week my son said, "Mom, this rice is bangin'"  (His highest praise.)  I use 1 cup uncooked white Basmati rice (which is nutty) to 1/2 cup wild rice.  My wild rice calls for 65 minutes of cooking, and it's perfect.  This week I substitued walnuts for almonds  (almonds are better), and I've used dried, chopped dates instead of dried cranberries, but Kathy's combo of tastes & textures is the best (except that I've never had fresh mushrooms on the days I've made this recipe & I often forget the orange zest!)  This is one of those forgiving recipes that is nearly impossible to ruin.  This is my very first review...sorry it took so long to say "Thank You".
Update March 2015 - I've now been making this dish for 10 years, and it's still a family favorite.  Our son, now grown and living on the opposite coast, craves it every time he comes home.  Now that we are empty-nesters, I freeze half and discovered it holds its flavor and  texture after freezing and reheating in the microwave!

This is another reicpe that I use frequently.  I don't like the onion wedges in this though.

I make the recipe just as written except that I sliver the onion wedges so that the onion is in short thin strips.

This reduces the cooking time for the onions (20 minutes) considerably since more surface area of the onions are exposed.

I also toast the almonds before using them.  PLace the almond slivers on a baking sheet and pop into a preheated 350*F oven.  Eacth them closely, they will burn if not tended to.  Stir the almonds frequently til light brown.

The toasted almonds make the dish taste deeper and nuttier.

I had to improvise w/ what I had on hand--namely, fresh cranberries. Big mistake. Go with sweetened dried cranberries, but I'd cut out the brown sugar when sauteing the onions. Sweetened cranberries will be enough sweetness for this savory dish.

Terrific. I made it vegetarian (omitted chicken broth) and used it to stuff an acorn squash. Used sliced almonds, not slivered, and substituted currants for the dried cranberries because we were all out.

I didn't quite know what to expect with this recipe.
I was pleasantly surprised....it was the perfect companion to my pork roast. I found two medium sized onions to be plenty.....I'm not sure I would have wanted another onion in it. I also didn't have any orange zest so I left it out. This was a nice change from regular rice.

Excellent!!  Made it for a crowd of 15 and everyone enjoyed it.  Was great with the crown roast of pork.  A really pretty holiday side dish.

This was pretty good, but I had to take 2 tries with it; the first try I found the onions to be WAAAAAY too sweet so I cut down on the brown sugar for the second try.  Also, I may be from Massachusetts, but even I thought the amount of cranberries was a little much.  Other than that, I enjoyed this.

I really like this dish. It has a very hearty and rich flavor. I thought that six onions might be too much, so I used five. Still very good.

Well it would have been great except for the fact that it was too buttery and therefore slimy.

I'm thrilled that my first review on this site is a 5 star.I "love" wild rice and my husband "doesn't". For decades I've tried to incorporate it into a dish he will more than tolerate. This recipe did it! He likes it and he will eat it again! I made it exactly as written with only 1 exception, he would not have eaten it with almonds, so I substituted pistachio, because I knew he would eat that. What I loved about this dish is the diversity in texture and flavor. It is soft, but also has a chewy bite. I loved the pop of flavor from the cranberries. I can see why this would make an excellent Holiday side. It had great eye appeal. Thanks Kathy, for me this recipe is a total keeper!

Really great flavor!  Followed recipe all the way ... worth the wait it takes to prepare.  This is a keeper for future holiday dinners.  It was a side dish with a honey mustard curry chicken dish (also from all recipes) both were super yummy.  Much thanks!

This was surprisingly nice.  I only used one large mayan onion though as opposed to three onions, and the dish still seemed about half onion.  Three would have made it an onion dish garnished with rice.  Also, I didn't want to buy a huge, expensive bottle of orange zest, so I substituted a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate for the zest.

Yummy!  This is a great savoury rice dish with a unique blend of flavours and textures.  The only thing was that I found the orange flavour just a tad too strong so I might try to cut down the orange zest to a little less than 1/2 teaspoon - but to each their own - some of my friends really liked the original recipe just as it is.

My guess is that this is a VERY versatile recipe that can easily be changed to suit your tastes.  Here's what I used and it was FANTASTIC!  2c brown Jasmine rice, 2c water, 2c vegetable broth, 4T butter, 1c diced onion, 2T brown sugar, 1 8oz can mushrooms, 2/3 of a 6-oz bag of Craisins, 1c roasted sliced almonds.  I took it to a faculty potluck and there was nothing left.  The flavor is a sweet onion with the cranberries and mushrooms thrown in.  It's wonderful and I will definitely make this again.

This was a really delicious recipe!  I made it with all wild rice and it was great!  Next time, I'll add a few more mushrooms, and a few less almonds.  Overall, I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be making it again and again.  Thanks! :-)

I rate this recipe as a 5 star!  My husband and I absolutely love it.  To us it's like having dessert with our meat and veggies.  We like it so much we could eat it on it's own.  I'm going to change it up a bit next time by stir frying some chicken in garlic and hoisin sauce, and adding it to the rice as a main dish.

Wonderful flavor. Served this along side the Roasted Port Shoulder with Pomegranate Sauce from this website and they worked very well together. Will probably reduce the amount of cranberries next time though. Thanks for the recipe!

Holy moly!  Wow.  I really liked this.  In fact, I'm going to have to put it out of my mind that I have a lot left in the fridge.  I can see myself going back for more!  I wanted to make this exactly as the recipe says, but wild rice was too expensive (at least in the store I went to).  I doubled the brown rice instead.  I also forgot to get an orange for the orange zest, so I didn't get that put in, either.  All I can say is, if it's this incredible without the orange zest, imagine how amazing it could be WITH the orange zest!  I read a few of the reviews before I made it and, since one of the reviews said it was too butttery, I decided to cut back to two tablespoons of unsalted butter and it was perfect.  I didn't miss that extra tablespoon.  I didn't know what kind of onion to use, so I bought a medium size red onion and it was WONDERFUL!  I also used a small can of mushrooms instead of the fresh.  I fixed it with Rachel Ray's cheese-crusted chicken tenderloins.  At first, the rice didn't seem that it was tender enough, so I put it in a covered casserole and put it in the oven at 275 degrees while I finished frying the chicken.  By that time, it was simply delectable.  Oh, the sweet tang of those cranberries is delightful!  And the crunch of the toasted almonds!  This one is a keeper for sure!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

What a tasty dish!  Wonderful with pork tenderloin and a fresh cucumber salad.  The timing on it is exactly perfect - start it 45 min. before you eat and you're good to go.

I'm glad I tasted this dish before I took it to our pot luck dinner at church. By the time
I made it through the line it was almost gone. This is such a flavorful and eye-pleasing
dish! I'll be making it a lot. I think it would be excellent served with pork loin.

With Thanksgiving fast approaching (Canadian) I wanted to try this out beforehand. Really yummy healthy ingredients, a festive presentation and fun to put together. It is a dish that could be made the day before and then reheated for the special meal. It's always nice to check something off the to do list early. A nice side dish which really compliments a holiday menu. Thanks.

I did not have any wild rice so I used all brown rice.  My husband, who doesn't really like brown rice thought this recipe was great.  I'll definitely keep it.

Very good rice dish, with a lot of different flavors that complement each other very well.  The only problem I had with this recipe is my onions didn't 'carmelize', unless that is another word for 'burned'.  Luckily I caught that in time to save most of them.  I didn't have any orange, so just added a couple tablespoons of orange juice, but I think the zest would work best.  I recommend trying this dish if you like the ingredients it requires.

Yum!
Fine without the orange zest (didn't have any).  The only concern is the amount of liquid left in the bottom of the rice after steaming; I am used to the rice soaking up the entire amount and not having to drain it.  I might use less broth next time.  But this was delish!

I would really like to give this rice a 5 star but I think I am conflicted. I followed the directions to the "tee" and came out with a very wonderfully flavored brown and wild rice. The only problem was that the wild rice did not cook completely. It was very crunchy and I was reading that some other member had the same issue. I also might follow the suggestions of some of you that used the prepackaged wild rice mixes or just using nothing but brown rice. The wild rice, though, gives a very impressive presentation. I would also recommending seasoning the cranberry/almond mixture before adding it to the rice with good old salt and pepper. Really makes a difference. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is awesome!  I fixed it with the "Cashew Crusted Chicken" as a test for a dinner party for 8 that I will be having this weekend.  These 2 recipes are definitely on my best recipes to fix to impress my guests!

I'm making this to bring to Thanksgiving, so just did a little taste test, and wow is it excellent. I doubled the recipe because we have a large family. The only things I didn't double were the sugar and the onions. I only used two onions, and that was perfect. I also added one cup dried cherries along with the cup of dried cranberries, and that combo was delicious. I would definitely make it that way again. I used portobellos for the mushrooms, and it gave the rice a nice, hearty flavor. We'll definitely make this again and again during the fall and winter seasons.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Lundberg's brown/wild rice mix, and coarse chopped pecans for the almonds.  Next time I would like to try cooking the cranberries a bit less, so they are still chewy instead of plump.  I think that texture would be good with the rice, other veggies, and nuts.  Loved the hint of orange.

This is delicious.  It's nice to have something a little different from plain rice.  I used what I had on hand - white rice instead of brown and chicken rice soup for one cup of the chicken broth and it was wonderful.

I modified this based on reviews and my own preferences: omitted orange zest because others mentioned that there is "too much going on", reduced onion to 1 because 3 seemed like too much to me, burned the almonds (LOL). My husband doesn't like rice but he said he would eat this again! I like rice and I loved this recipe. I will definitely make this again!

What a delightful recipe! Such a nice change to wild rice with the little bit of orange zest and cranberries.

I used the ingredients listed but changed the cooking method a little.  I sauted the rice, almonds and onions in butter until the onions were done.  To this I added the cranberries, orange zest and liquid.  To this I also added some chicken breasts, covered and baked for 1 hour.  

The chicken was nice and moist and picked up a nice flavor from the cranberries and orange zest.  I will definately make this recipe again!

Fantastic!  I did, however, cook the wild rice separate (just in boiling water) because the directions on the box indicated a longer cooking time than the brown rice.  I doubled the recipe and froze portions for future dinners.  However, neither my husband or my 20-month old cared for it as much.

I struggled with how to rate this recipe. I, personally, loved it. I think it is absolutely full of flavour and beautiful to look at. My family, however did not like it. I still make it, mostly for myself and maybe for company. It is also good left over and retains all the flavour. Too bad my crew doesnt like it. I actually thought that they would because they are not very fussy eaters.

Tried this for the first time at Thanksgiving dinner for my in-laws. It was a big hit, and everyone asked for the recipe!
One change I made in the interests of time was to substitute the rice from boxes of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice for the brown and wild rice in the recipe. I just left out the enclosed seasoning packets.
I would definately recommend this recipe, and try it again! Went together very quickly on the holiday morning.

This was an incredible rice dish.  My whole family loved it!  I used a mixture of white and wild rice which cooked in 20 minutes.  I also had orange-flavored cranberries, so I omitted the orange zest.  I'll be making this again since I didn't get to take any of the leftovers home!

This was pretty tasty, although perhaps too much wild rice.  I will probably make again because it is so pretty and interesting, but I will cut the wild rice down by half and increase the brown rice.  Also, the wild rice didn't quite get cooked, could have used a little more time cooking.

Excellent recipe. I toasted the almonds in a frying pan instead of the oven and they came out fine. I chopped the onions instead of keeping them in wedges before caramelizing them for a more uniform distribution. Most importantly added cut up rotisserie chicken to make it a meal instead of a side dish. My 3 college age children loved it!

If I could give this a ten star rating I would. It was wonderful, time consuming but worth every bite. I will be bringing this year as a dish for Thanksgiving at my sister-in-laws house. Great change and healthy too.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it once as is and it was really good.  My second attempt I used only 1 onion, which suited our taste a little better.  I also added a tablespoon of butter when combining everything to bring it together a little more and added cinnamon for a twist.  It was out of this world! I didn't measure the cinnamon, just added a couple good dashes from my shaker.  It gives the dish a whole different dimension, and tastes even better the second day!

i made this with what i had on hand, so i used 1 1/2 onions, canned mushrooms, half cranberries half currants, and pine nuts instead of almonds.  i added about 1/2 lb chicken in small pieces which i cooked at the end with the cranberries, adding some white wine then as well.  turned out AMAZING.

Very good.  I made the following changes. 1) Made 1/2 cup of wild rice and 1/2cup of red rice in rice cooker with water. 2) No mushrooms. 3) chopped walnuts and no almonds. 4) squeezed a little orange juice into the dish.

this dish is absolutely delicious!!!  everyone agrees.  i made it with vegetable stock, basmati brown rice and Earth Balance buttery spread.  makes an excellent vegan dish.  i can't wait for everyone else to try it on Christmas day.  yummmmmm!!!

UPDATE: 21 for Christmas dinner.  Rave reviews!  I can't wait to warm up the leftovers.  BTW,  I made this dish a couple of days ahead.  I warmed it in the oven.  Came out perfect.

Delish!  I used one onion and sliced it thinly instead of cutting into wedges, I browned the almonds in the butter along with the veggies and I reduced the butter to a tablespoon - otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T". It went well with a roasted pork tenderloin and grilled asparagus.

This was really delicious. I rehydrated the cranberries in white wine earlier in the day.  The oven temperature stated for toasting the almonds is a little high.  Next time, I'll reduce it to 275.

There is almost too much going on in this recipe, lots of strong flavors. To my surprise the small amount of orange zest was quite overpowering.  I think if the amount of rice/broth was doubled (or the other ingredients halved) this would be better - I like my rice side dishes to be more subtle.

I made this for a client and received rave reviews!  It was very festive in appearance and smelled heavenly!  I used a brown/wild rice blend from Trader Joe's and used my pressure cooker to cut down the cooking time.  (15 minutes)  Also used vegetable broth for my vegetarian clients.

This was a great recipe!  I tried it because I wanted something different and this hit the spot.  I only used 2 onions (but 3 would have been fine).  I don't like mushrooms so I chopped up a bell pepper instead and used that.  We loved the contrasting flavors and textures of this dish!  One note: my wild rice took longer than 45 minutes to cook, and I had to add a little extra liquid.

Overall, for taste this dish is fantastic.  A wonderful nutty, crunchy complex blend of flavors.  I loved the carmelized onions and the mushrooms the best.  However, that said, this recipe takes a lot of work!  I would make it for a special occasion, but it is just too time consuming for a regular meal at home.  I also would recommend using a store blend of rice and preparing it according to the package directions.  I used President's Choice Royal Blend on the advice of a previous review, and it was perfect.  I also used fresh, not dried cranberries and that turned out fine too.  A great recipe, just make sure you have the time to prepare it.

This is a delicious recipe!  It became a favorite the first time I served it.  I used all wild rice.  It was tasty, but chewy.  Next time I will use the recommended brown rice/wild rice mix.  Thanks so much for sharing!

AWESOME!  Beautiful & Delicious.  I ended up burning my carmelized onions so when I made a second batch of onions, I only had enough time to cook until soft & translucent.  Turned out great anyway.  Also, don't like brown rice so used all wild rice. Will definitely make again.

The flavor and texture was great. I did add some chopped celery and carrot for texture as I didn't have any almonds.I did not have orange zest so I used 1/4 cup of Orange juice. Yummy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I read all the reviews first so I cut back the onions to 2 and I soaked the wild rice in a bowl of water for about an hour before making the recipe as written. It was so good that I only got a spoonful at Thanksgiving so I made another batch for myself the next day. I love it and so did my husband which is amazing! I will be making this for Christmas dinner also. Its easy to make but it does take some time to get it done-definitely can't make this on a week night.

Amazing! Used a bag of 1/2 wild 1/2 brown rice and cooked according to the directions, using veggie broth instead of water. Followed directions for the onion/mushroom/cranberry mix just as stated. Omitted the almonds (didn't have any). Absolutely fabulous. We will definitely be having this again soon!

Wow - fantastic!  This is so delicious.  I'll definitely be using it during the holiday season!  I used less onion - 3 just seemed like too much.   And I used wild rice for the whole thing instead of the 2 kinds of rice mentioned.  But it's the other ingredients that make it so yummy - it all blends together well!

FABULOUS!! Followed recipe exactly, served with grilled filet mignon and steamed green beans. One of the easiest to prepare and best tasting meals ever! Will make again and again, not just for holidays. Sidebar- if you have dried cranberries and slivered almonds leftover use them in Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad ...also on this site and fabulous.

Not just for Thanksgiving!!  I wanted to use up a box of wild rice/white rice with seasonings, that box makes 3 cups of cooked rice.  I used that in place of the rice and chicken broth and then used 2/3 amount for the rest of the ingredients. (and omitted the brown sugar) I LOVED it as a meatless main dish for a simple week-day supper.  Ate it with a microwaved baked sweet potato.

Love this rice dish!  Didn't cook it as long as the recipe called for, used vegetable broth, and just tossed whole almonds in at the end.  loved this will make it again!  I think I will use vegetable broth in the rice next time.

I made this into a gluten free, dairy free side dish by using soy butter substitute.  I also had run out of slivered almonds, so toasted up some pine nuts.  It was great.  Since the first time, I've also used toasted pumpkin seeds in place of almonds..  This dish can be varied in so many interesting ways by using different dried fruits...  apricots, cherries, apples, dates  ...  wonderful recipe

This dish was pretty original, I thought.  The cranberries made it way too sweet, though, and I only put in 2/3 of a cup to begin with.  If we make this again we may omit the cranberries all together because the caramelized onions add a lot of sweetness on their own.  We may put in a bit less orange zest also.

Enjoyed very much.  Made exactly as written and maybe my onions were too big.  I would only use 2 next time and 3/4 cup of cranberries.  Will make again.

This was delightful!  Pretty much followed recipe except that I didn't have uncooked wild rice so I substituted with Uncle Ben's wild rice in the package.  I also only used 2 onions, one finely diced and the other in slices just for different textures.  I can tell you that I it didn't need 3 and I love onions!  I also left out the orange zest just b/c I didn't have any.  I served this with Marinated baked Pork Chops from this site along with green beans.  I didn't find that it was too sweet as some other reviewers stated.  Very Good!

While preparing this dish I had my doubts, in particular about sauteeing onion slices in butter and brown sugar (not a common thing to do in Scandinavia), but I faithfully followed the recipe and boy did it turn out! I fell in love after the first mouthful and am now sitting here stuffed to the gills after 2 platefuls! BTW instead of warming up the oven just for a handful of almonds, instead I sautéed them in the frying pan in a little oil and set them aside before starting on the onions. We didn't have any cranberries or orange zest, but already without those this was incredibly good. This is definitely going to be a regular dish in our household from now on! Thank you!

This is the kind of thing you could eat just by itself.  Healthy and perfect!  Didn't change a thing with the recipe.

Great recipe. Not something you can make quickly, though anything with wild rice is going to be like that. I used leeks instead of onions, and left out the mushrooms.

I loved this dish but my husband hated it.  He will eat just about anything at least once but he took one bite of this and wouldn't eat any more.  However, if you love cranberries, mushrooms and almonds (as I do!), you'll probably like this rice.

Loved this and easy to make. To cut the fat content I used canola margarine and used low sodium chicken broth to reduce the sodium.  Will definately make again.

This recipe was very good without any changes but I had to simmer my rice for an hour to get it tender.  Maybe because I live at 4800 ft?

Although a bit more time consuming than I prefer (brown rice just takes a while to cook and there's not a thing you can do about that) this dish is fabulous. Nice and savory with a hint of sweetness and tart. A great way to up the fiber and protien of a mainly carb dish and a nice "gourmet" alternative to plain old rice. My only changes were that I used sliced instead of slivered almonds (purely my mistake while picking up items at the store) and I only used about half of a single onion, finely chopped. Sweetie really doesn't like onions, this way I was able to get some oft he flavor without completely overwhelming him.

This was yummy.  Usually I think anything with berries, nuts and then something traditionally non sweet like onions makes for a total "girl" food and I was both surprised and delighted that my husband loved it.  I accidentally doubled the rice in the beginning so we had lots of leftovers.  I added zuchini just because I had them and it was a nice addition.  I also used just brown rice.  Fun flavors and very hearty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe-I didn't have any wild rice or oranges, so I just left them out. I also didn't measure the cranberries (which I chopped up tiny) or mushrooms...but I absolutely loved this--which I very rarely do without tweaking the recipe. The carmelized onions simply MAKE this recipe. I also followed another suggestion to toss in the almonds with the rice to make them more tender.  Definite high five!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.I found a packaged brown rice/wild rice combination and used that. Since I am vegetarian, I used vegetable broth. Because I thought the onion amount was vague, I went with 2 medium onions. I increased the mushrooms to 3/4 cup. I used tangerine zest instead of orange, because that is all I had. If you like these ingredients in general, I think you will love this recipe. The flavors come together so nicely. The only changes I will make next time is use less butter and more orange zest. It ended up being a bit too greasy for my tastes. But still worth 5 stars. I can't wait to try this next Thanksgiving or Christmas.  

UPDATE: I continue to make this dish with great success. I have cut back on the cranberries. I find I prefer it a little less sweet. Also, I do make this a day ahead and reheat. I find that if do not but the almonds in until you are going to reheat it, they will be crunchier. Just love this recipe!!!

Super Easy Super Good. I did however put the almond slices to cook with the rice making them more tender. I cut the onions into smaller slices (making it a little more kid friendly)and I just dried orange peel instead of the zest.
AWESOME reciepe

This was so enjoyable!  The only change I made was to use orange-flavoured Craisins and leave out the zest, so the
orange stayed in the background and didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients.  I will definitely make this again;  thanks Kathy!

This is such a good rice dish! I made it for company and they just raved over it, and my hubby liked it so much he asked if I would make it for Thanksgiving.  We just finished dinner, and I have to say, it got tons and tons of compliments! It's a keeper and a new favorite in our house! thanks for the great recipe Kathy!

My husband and I thought the orange zest was a little over-powering, so I will use less or none of that next time.  Otherwise, this is a great way to jazz up boring rice!  Thanks.

This was the BEST rice dish I ever served!!  I thought the cranberries would be too much, but my guests LOVED it, and it was the cranberries that made the dish special.  I had to 4x the recipe to serve about 10 people. This is my new pot luck dish for parties!

This was really good.  It does take quite a bit of work, though.  I used instant brown and wild rice, which cut down on cooking time, but prep time is still pretty high for a rice dish.  But I made it for a dinner party, and everyone really liked it.

I made this dish for Christmas and my sister and husband loved it, they were amazed my all the flavour. But my father and brother in law said the orange flavour was too strong; maybe next time I'll reduce to half the orange zest.

This was excellent!  The FLAVOR (with those carmelized onions) and the TEXTURE (with the almonds and chewiness of the rices) was a great combination; and it's healthy too.  We missed having more brown rice/wild rice in it with three onions (that's a lot but they are delish and I wouldn't cut back on it); but I would double the quantity of the rices.  Thank you!!!

I love this recipe.  Served it at a dinner party with pork tenderloin and it was a big hit.  Instead of the two kinds of rice, I used President's Choice Royal Blend Premium Rice Mix which is a combination of white, brown, wild and red rices.  I cooked the rice according to the package directions and continued with the recipe the way it is written.  I will make this again and again.

I tried this recipe last week and both my husband and I loved it.  It makes a difference to ordinary boring rice.  I thought the amount of cranberries were a little overkill at first but my husband loved them and so did I once I tasted it.  I'll do the recipe exactly the same way next time as he rarely eats rice where he enjoyed so much.  It's a keeper! ??

The cranberries just tasted weird in this dish.  There are too many things in this recipe for a rice dish already and adding a big amount of sweet ingredient (cranberries) just makes it feel like it's trying too hard to contain everything.  The ingredients simply don't go together well.

Added celery and used jellied cranberry as no dried were available. Also used some quinoa with mango in it. White sugar due to no brown, so didn't typically carmelized, but did thicken. Really good. Added Mandarin zest and some pep and salt. Will do again!

It was way too sweet.  I would halve the amount of cranberries next time.  This is not a stand-alone vegetarian dish in my book, but might be really nice as an accompaniment to chicken/pork. I think this recipe has a lot of potential, and I need to tune it to my likes.  I love the almond, and the serving suggestion of acorn squash.  I think the acorn squash provides all the sweetness necessary, although an ACCENT of cranberries would probably be great.  I'll give it another shot.

This recipe is delish. I have made it several times.  I use this recipe and add charizo to it and stuff pork tenderloin.

The only differences I made was adding raisins and red wine vinegar. I use vinegar in everything for it adds so much flavor.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  My family and friends love love it.

I think 3 onions are WAY too many!!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated the first time and we did NOT like it but we like all the ingredients so I think next time we'll try less wild rice since it's more powerful and definitely less onions.

This is wonderful! I didn't have everything on hand so ended up using all jasmine rice, and I used roasted cashews instead of almonds.  My family agrees that this is definitely a keeper!  It will also be a great choice when company comes.  With it I served Honey Baked Chicken, also on this site.  It was a great combo.

This is one of those great recipes that has it all--it's pretty on the table, extremely nutritious and super versatile.  I've added chopped chicken, spinach and artichokes to make it a one dish meal with great results.  Thanks for sharing, Kathy.

This is a good side dish, I liked it a lot, but didn't love it.  I used rehydrated mushrooms (good), fresh cranberries in sugar (too tart), diced onions (good), added sausage (try pork, I used a chicken pesto).  Recommend light on pepper, as it seemed to overwhelm with just a few grinds.

Loved this!  Toasting almonds was a great recommendation.  I created too much orange zest by mistake and included about 50% more than the recipe which I wouldn't repeat.  Next time I'll try with less butter (for health, not taste) and I think it will work.  This dish was a hit with all and will definitely be repeated!

FANTASTIC! made this last night and the only problem with it was there wasn't enough! Great recipe, all my guests loved it. Only change I did was cut my onions smaller and only used 2 instead of 3. Will be making this again and again. 5 stars for sure!!!

THis was fantastic!!  Approval from all who tried it (took it to work).  Only changes I made (availability) were to use all white rice and  chopped onion instead of wedges.  A co-worker also suggested adding/substituting snap sugar peas.  I also added cooked chicken cut into bite-size pieces at the same times as the cranberries and mushrooms (makes a meal rather than side dish).  I'll try it with wild rice next time. Will make again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was really really good!  Some changes I made: I used white rice instead of brown, BUT i cooked the two rices seperately before I mixed them together so the white rice wouldnt take the colors of the wild rice. It gave the dish more color. (I tried it before cooking two rices together and it all looked purple...maybe we have a different type of wild rice in Israel.)   I also diced the onions instead of having them in 1/2 inch wedges.  The brown sugar was such an amazing addition. It was subtle and gave so much taste! I would add a little LESS orange zest just because it was overpowering the entire dish!  GREAT overall!

This dish was pretty good, but it seemed to lack a good flavor, other then the sweetness from the cranberries, I might try adding some herbs next time. I served it at a dinner party and everyone liked it, but I have a few complaints about it being too many cranberries.

I was a little unsure of the amount of onion for only 1 cup of rice so I just used one. It was fine but I will probably use 2 next time. I also sliced the onions thinly which I would do again. This dish was delicious!! The almonds, cranberries and orange zest gave it such a wonderful flavour. Looking forward to making this again!!

This was excellent! The only thing I did different was cut the onions smaller because I don't like big onion chunks. But everything else was the same and it was great. Everything flowed together really well and just had a great flavor. This is a great fall dish that I will definitely be making again.

Yummy! Perfect recipe to give some flavor to that wild rice that I have. I used the zest of an entire orange. The almonds give it a nice crunch and the cranberry tartness is just right. I totally omitted the mushrooms and only used one onion which I diced. I also put more brown sugar in.  I'd make this again.. maybe for Thanksgiving!

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years back and got RAVE reviews. I did only use one onion though.. and cut it up a bit smaller than suggested. Super side dish for the holidays because of its color and flavor.

Went over great even with the picky eaters. I skipped the mushrooms as I did not have any on hand and I did soak the cranberries in white wine which added a nice dimension to the dish.

I'm a caterer and I wanted a great rice dish that tasted wonderful, but used brown and wild rice. Not just white rice. This one is the best. I had to use vegetable stock becaue of some vegetarians in the group I have served it to, but it is requested over and over.

This recipe is so delicious! I make it just as written, except I chop the onion rather than leave it in strips. I also use a whole container of sliced mushrooms and chop them. The orange zest adds a nice zing.

This was a hit. I served this and some other (not so low-cal) items at a dinner party. This dish was cleaned out. The guests were really surprised that it was a low cal dish. I followed the recipe exactly as given.

I made the recipe as is except I did not add mushrooms. Also, I only used 1 1/2 onions (which I considered medium) and there were more onions than rice, which made it only 4 stars. I would add 1 medium onion or less and then reduce the amount of butter accordingly to caramelize them, and THEN this would be 5 stars because the rice would be the highlight, not the onion.

What an excellent combination of flavors! Aside from using coconut oil and veg broth, I followed the recipe exactly. I grated the orange zest over individual servings for a test run; it's equally delicious both ways. The only change I'd make is to use more mushrooms, because they really complement the wild rice. This is a new favorite!

This was really great! I liked this recipe because it wasn’t loaded with salt. I even used low sodium chicken broth, and there was still plenty of flavor. I used canned mushrooms (that’s all I had) and I used sliced almonds that I purchased already roasted and just tossed them in before serving the dish.  I loved the crunch and chewiness of this dish and it went well with the lamb chops that I served. My daughter said, “This tastes like Thanksgiving!” This recipe will go into the regular rotation.

I've made this recipe for vegans using vegetable broth.  Better with chicken broth, although either one works for me.

This recipe was awesome! Even my 18-month-old loved it! Very easy to make, even if it does take some time. It's not hard -just needs to be started enough in advance. So, no problem there. We didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I just omitted them. Still turned out great. Superb with salmon and green beans! :)

This is easily one of the best side dishes I have ever had.  Took a little time to make, but well worth the time.  I only used one onion as we are not big onion eaters and it was still great.

I made this with only one onion and it turned out great!  I made it both for Thanksgiving and then again for a company Christmas party that is a pot luck. I was very pleased and will be making this again.

I made this rice dish for a Fall Social in 2007. The ladies went crazy over it! Had to give them a copy in our monthly newsletter.
Love it!

delicious!  I cut the recipe in half.  I didn't have any wild rice, so I used 1.5 cups of cooked brown rice.  I used frozen cranberries (thawed and halved).  I used one onion.  I used dried mushrooms and gave them life by cooking them in chicken broth.  Altogether, it was great!  Now I'm just thinking of a main dish that can go with this.

As some of the other reviewers note, this is a very forgiving recipe. It has a nice flavor and texture because of the nuts. It was easy to make and I was able to substitute items I didn't have from my cupboard. It came out great! I used 1/2 c. pine nuts, 2 c. veggie broth, 1/2 c.jasmine rice, 1/2 wild rice, 3 T. oil (dairy allergy), 1 c. shredded carrots, (no brown sugar), 1/2 c. dried cranberries, 2 c. mushrooms, 1/2 t. orange zest. Thank you Kathy for sharing. It really is a nice  dish for company. My family tends to be very "meat and potatoes", but even they enjoyed it, and my vegetarian friends loved it. One of my other guests thought that by adding hamburg, it would be a really good main dish for the meat-eaters!

This recipe makes a LOT of dish.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I omitted the orange zest (I am not a fan) and I used a few chopped pecans rather than almonds.  I would make it again.  YUM.

This was different from any rice I have ever made & everyone really liked it.  The recipe called for too much butter for my taste, so I reduced it to about 1 tbsp.

Very yummy! I used orange-flavoured, sweetened Craisins and eliminated the orange zest. The end result was a bit sweet; I would reduce the sugar next time. Hubby, who usually dislikes wild and brown rice ate this all up. We enjoyed this with roast pork.

This was pretty good!  I used 1 cup of brown rice instead of combination of brown & wild rice since I didn't have wild rice.  I also omitted the mushrooms (hubby hates them) and the nuts (both kids are allergic).  We liked the combination of the rice & onions with the sweetness of the cranberries.  I would make this again!

A very good dish to make with turkey or a pork roast. Nice blending of textures, color & flavor - especially appropriate for autumn dinners, I think. I served it alongside a lamb roast, & although it did not compliment the lamb very well ( actually overpowered the delicate taste of the lamb), I could tell it was a keeper on its own. The leftovers went fantastically with a pork roast, & I'll bet turkey would be even better. Pairing it w/lamb was my own blunder. Thanks for sharing a fine recipe!

I'll add this recipe to my holiday collection. Although the recipe didn't specify onion size, I used 3 large onions and it worked out fine.  The mushrooms and almonds were hardly noticeable (may add more when I try again), but I liked the orange zest and the cranberries were wonderful.  I wouldn't substitute the cranberries - they and the onions made the dish.  I finally found a way to enjoy brown rice!

This was very different - sweet, salty, and crunchy all at the same time.  I did not have cranberries, so I added green apples instead.  Still came out a very interesting tasting dish.  I would probably make this again - maybe next time I will use raisins instead of cranberries.

It was a hit!  It was worth the extra time in the kitchen.  Since 3 out of 4 of us are vegetarian I used vegetable brothe instead of chicken and it worked out well.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

I am not a fan of this.  I served this for Christmas dinner. I did not have anyone say that they liked it.  My oldest Grandson said that it had way to many flavors going on,& most said that either the cranberries or the orange flavor was just too much.

I thought this was excellent. I think it was too many onions, though. I only used 2 onions and it still seemed like a lot. I cooked the brown rice and wild rice separately since cooking times vary, then just combined them afterwards, no problem with uncooked wild rice. Very delicious recipe I will keep.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! I made this on a whim for serve with a pork roast so I didn't have all the ingredients on hand and had to make a couple of substitutions.  Instead of dried cranberries, I used currants, instead of brown and wild rice, I used jasmine rice and cooked it the normal 20 minutes.  And instead of orange zest, I used 1/8 tsp. orange oil.
DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make this again and will probably use the jasmine rice again. Perfect for holidays and special dinners.

This was fantastic! I couldn't find just wild rice, so I used a box of Uncle Ben's Original Long Grain and Wild Rice mix, minus the sauce packet - it worked great! I also didn't have slivered almonds on hand, so I used chopped walnuts. Even my in-laws loved it! I'll definitely be making this again.

The Harvest Rice dish was a smash hit at two different dinner parties. The blend of flavors is absolutely marvelous.
It was an easy to make dish that looked beautiful, too.

This is REALLY good. I cooked the two different kinds of rice separatelly, according to the package instructions but with the chicken stock in the recipe instead of water -package suggests water-. I then mixed them up together. My guests LOVED it and asked for the recipe.

I was not impressed with the look of this dish -- but it was probably my fault.  I have always had problems cooking brown rice (I've only done it a few times) and I can never seem to get the right texture with the rice not falling apart from being over cooked.   ~~ After saying that, the taste was wonderful at our Thanksgiving dinner yesterday. I had requests to take the leftovers home.  I used vegetable stock (canned) and doubled the recipe.  Each can says "about 2 cups" and after my two cans boiled down and the rice was still crunchy I put another can in.  I also omitted quite a few things because of picky relatives, so there were no onions or mushrooms in this rice dish.  I also forgot to add the orange zest.  ~~ This is definetly worth trying, I loved the taste of the final product with the almonds and cranberries and rice.  I'll probably make this again once I figure out the right way to simmer the rice. I had it on "simmer" for about 50 minutes before adding the second can of broth, and I think that my "simmer" was not hot enough to cook the rice.

This was absolutely the best rice dish I have ever fixed or ate anywhere.
If I was having the President of the USA for dinner, this is a gourmet dish that he would deserve.
And it is very easy to fix.

This was EXCELLENT!!  I think it could have used a bit more rice-the added things (cranberries, almonds, etc) sort of took over.  I wouldn't, however, cut back on the yummy additions!!  I will make this again!!  YumYum!!

Reduced the amount of the onion from three onions to one-half cup diced. Also, deleted the mushrooms but added dried apricots instead. This makes for a pretty cold salad for a summer BBQ.

nothing special about this dish, but I did take away 2 good ideas from it: the toasted almonds are a great additional texture to the already nutty taste and texture of wild rice and caramelizing onions in brown sugar to sweeten them.  The cranberries were overpowered by the other foods, so perhaps fresh cranberries would add a little tart taste that would stand out more.  Sorry, but I think the wild rice recipe in Martha Stewart's cookbook (named something like "Rice dish for duck") is far better.

Great recipe. This will be a regular "go to" recipe.
I made the following changes;
(1) I substituted chopped, roasted pecans for the almonds 
(2) I used 1 large onion, chopped instead of 3 onions slivered
(3) I reduced butter to 2 T.
(4) Mushrooms are optional.  I omitted them because I was using mushrooms in another recipe.

I made this wild rice dish to go with dill salmon - I omitted almonds and cranberries; doubled the rices but used the recipe for onions and mushrooms and it was perfect.

Just ok for me. Love wild rice but this was too sweet for me with the combination of brown sugar and dried cranberries. I really wanted to love this and make it for a company next week, but I think I’ll skip it and look for something else. I think with the wild rice I would’ve liked more of a savory taste with the nuttiness of the wild rice.

This recipe reads add fresh mushrooms, I did use shiitake. I used a hard simmer wild rice adding multiple cups of broth simmering uncovered for almost 2 hours. I slightly modified the second part of the recipe as well. I finally chopped the dried cranberries.I did use the orange zest. Very delicious combination of flavors.

The photo I posted included some venison maple sausage- a great addition to make this a great main dish. I served it first as was written exchanging pecans for the almonds because they were in the cupboard- a review from a friend who is also a vegetarian said this was the best rice dish he had ever had. Yummy!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and soaked the dried cranberries in white wine till plump.  I also added a can of diced water chestnuts.  Great dish and I'm always asked for the recipe.

Another big hit for a traditional Christmas dinner! Went very well with standing rib roast, roasted root veggies, and cranberry relish! May try stuffing it in acorn  squash.

Did not change the recipe.  I like all the ingredients, however the next time I make it, I will cut the cranberries down to half a cup.  The full cup made it way too sweet for me.  Seems that 3 onions would be over the top, but it's not.  Go ahead and use the 3.   Walnuts or pecans would also go well in this dish.

The harvest rice dish was just ok for me.  Fixed it for Christmas and had a lot leftover, but then there were lots of other great side dishes to compete.  I added spices to help with the bland taste.

It is delicious and beautiful with lots of color. I had to keep the mushrooms on the side as most of the family doesn't like them. I used 1 Tbls of butter and 1 tbls of olive oil instead of all the butter, otherwise I followed the recipe. It's a great side!

I've made this several times and we love it! I do "eyeball" measuring and often use more of some ingredients (such as the mushrooms), and I always double the recipe. It freezes well, and is just as good when thawed and heated!

I made it with chicken as a main dish. A little exotic for my family. Needs more flavor, would add garlic another time, maybe more veggies. Rice needed to cook an hour but timing was ok.

I liked it but it wasn't easy for me to make cause I was in a hurry and burned the almonds twice.  so I used whole almonds toasted them and then crushed them.  turned out to be way too much almond.  I cut back on onion kinda regret it. but it wasn't too bad.  I'll put it on the back burner and probably try it again later.  oh I used baby Bella mushrooms went well with the almond.

This was fabulous and I used 1 cup of wild rice instead of both types of rice.  I only used 1 3/4 cups broth for the rice.  I also used only 2 medium sized white onions.  Otherwise, no changes.

Delicious! I served with bourbon pecan chicken, wonderful dinner! Make this in the morning, or even the day before, it gets even better, and allows more time for other preparations.

This is a great recipe. I am not a rice-lover at all but trying to eat healthier (something healthier than mac and cheese). This dish converted me to rice. I make the recipe exactly and it turns out great. Thanks for posting this!

I'm honestly shocked about how tasty this is! The ingredients don't sound as though they would all work together, but they make a beautiful combination of savory and sweet.  I did omit the mushrooms,  almonds,  and orange zest, because I didn't have it on hand, but it was still yummy!   It was between experimenting to make a cranberry jello mold (yikes!)and this. Thank you so much for this recipe.

There was leftover liquid when done, & my family didn't really care for it at first. They did like it better reheated the next day, and the extra liquid helped to keep it from drying out. 3 stars for the day it was made and 4 for the leftovers.

Great alternative to boring brown rice and especially great for holiday dinners where you have gluten-free guests.  Leftovers freeze well too.

This was only ok.  It was too much work to just out okay.  All three of us found it to be on the bland side.  I did leave out the orange zest but that wouldn't have saved it.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I used the rice cooker.  Two onions would've been enough.  A very good recipe, which I will save to make again later.

I'm vegetarian, so I used organic vegetable broth instead of chicken and Earth Balance spread instead of butter and it turned out great!

The flavors of this dish are amazing.   I made this early in the day; I made each rice separately since they had different cooking times but otherwise followed the directions exactly.   I served it with a great salad, bacon-wrapped green beans and filet mignon.  For dessert:  white chocolate raspberry mousse fom this site.   Rave reviews from my guests!

Very pretty dish!!  I reduced the amount of onion as I think three would have been way too much.  Hubby thought the almonds were a little overpowering so I'll cut those to half next time, or eliminate them altogether.

Fabulous!  I made the rice in my rice cooker but cooked everything else in a skillet and mixed it with the rice after it was done.  Also, I used lemon zest instead of orange as that is what I had on hand.  This was so good!

Didn't have brown or wild rice, used Jasmine instead and it still turned out wonderful.  Can't wait to make again using brown and wild rice.

This was excellent!  Unfortunately, I didn't have orange zest & decided to add orange marmalade instead.  I ended up adding too much which gave it too strong an orange flavor.  Next time I will just leave it out if I don't have it because it was fantastic before adding the orange marmalade.

This was pretty good.  The only change I made was to add more mushrooms and I would do that again.  Next time I would only use 1 or  2 onions, depending on their size and chop them instead of the wedges.  I thought they overwhelmed the dish being in large wedges and so many of them.  I don't think I would add the orange zest next time - I think I would of enjoyed all the other flavors much more without it.  Not bad overall but I prefer the almond wild rice on this site better.

We did not care for this. Too much of a browned flavor. Would have been better not caramelizing the Onions or browning the Almonds since using Brown Rice.

Delicious! I added grilled turkey to make it a complete meal. Also, note- wild rice is pretty expensive... but good and added an important visual diversity to the dish.

This is one of my favorite ways of preparing rice. It's quite time-consuming but great for when you have need-to-be-impressed company! I used all brown rice and cut the onions down to 2 small, I think more would be too much.

This rice dish is out standing. I love the texture and the taste. I cut back on the onions a bit. I also accidently bought 'already cooked' wild rice at the store (came in a packet, who knew?). So I just cooked the brown rice alone and then mixed in the wild rice with the rest of the ingredients. I would definitely make this again.

Meh.  After reading the reviews I was very excited to bring this dish to a holiday gathering.  I thought it was kind of bland (I followed the recipe exactly).  My family apparently thought so, too, as I had about half the dish left afterwards!  I probably won't make this recipe again.

At first, this side intimidated me a bit.  I a boxed rice kinda girl.  But the end result was amazing!  It won out over the brandided steaks as the star of the dinner plate.  It reminded me a bit of the rice that comes with Orange Sesame Chicken at some chain restaurants.
Its a keeper!  Thanks so much.

I only made one change to this recipe & that was to use all brown basmati rice w/ no wild rice (didn't have any). I did have to add a bit more broth when my rice ran dry & it took longer than 20 minutes to caramelize the onions. I wish I had cooked the almonds in w/ the rice some...they were a little too crunchy for my tastes. Oh, & I did add a bit more orange zest than called for. It looked like there was going to be too little rice ratio but once it was all mixed togther, it was perfect. This was a fabulous dish...loved the addition of cranberries! Thanks Kathy Alexander!

I only made one change to this recipe & that was to use all brown basmati rice w/ no wild rice (didn't have any). I did have to add a bit more broth when my rice ran dry & it took longer than 20 minutes to caramelize the onions. I wish I had cooked the almonds in w/ the rice some...they were a little too crunchy for my tastes. Oh, & I did add a bit more orange zest than called for. It looked like there was going to be too little rice ratio but once it was all mixed togther, it was perfect. This was a fabulous dish...loved the addition of cranberries! Thanks Kathy Alexander!

I made this dish and the taste was great. Had a bit of trouble with the Jasmine rice though.

This was 'oh my goodness' good! I was unsure if the recipe meant 3 onions, so only used one fairly large one.  It did cook down a lot w/the carmelization process, but still tasted oniony enough. I used 1 cup brown rice, 1/2 cup wild.  
To make up for the difference in cooking times of the 2 rices, I put the wild rice in a pot w/a can of chix broth. after 15 minutes, added the brown and let them finish off together. 
The savory/fruit flavor really complemented our meal!

When we were invited to a friends house for New Years Eve, I found this rice recipe to go with baked stuffed shrimp. I was a little leary taking it to dinner party since I hadn't tried it yet, but said what the heck. Its better than baked potatos! I made the dish but didn't put the almonds in it because another friend couldn't have nuts. I put them in a separate container. We just added them to our plates. It was wonderful and very delicious and got alot of compliments. Wouldn't change a thing. My jusband even loved it. Thanks!

This is such a good recipe.  I made it for guests, and they just raved over it..they liked it so much that I ended up sending the recipe home with them!  I made a batch of this for Thanksgiving too, and it was a huge hit.  I didn't put any orange zest in it the second time I made it (I didn't have any) and it was still fantastic!  It's such a pretty presentation too!

My family really loved this rice, however I would make a few changes.  I couldn't find wild rice in my grocery store, but they did have a long white rice mixed with wild rice -- this was perfect. Probably changed the overall texture of the dish.  Next time I make this dish I will be reducing the almonds, and cranberries to about half, and eliminating the orange zest.  I found that the abundance of cranberries mixed with the zest made it too tart.  Overall, a good recipe worth keeping in the collection.

This was good.  My picky husband even liked it, and with all that stuff in he, I really thought he would take one bite and hate it, but he really liked it.  GOes good with the Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi.

Thanks Kathy...we'll never have boring old rice again!  This was a hit at my recent dinner party.  We loved the textures, flavours, and the healthy ingredients.  My guest just couldn't get enought!  I didn't have enough dried cranberries, so I added some raisins.  Cooked the rice separately just in case I messed up with the brown rice.  (Uncle Ben's now makes whole grain brown rice that's quick and easy) Wasn't sure about adding the almonds or the orange zest...but these are absolutely essential...awesome!

This recipe really helps brown/wild rice. I did add way too much brown sugar (was cooking from memory). The combination of flavors really make it yummy. Will make for holidays and when I roast turkey.

Wonderful! I've never taken the time to review a recipe before but this recipe is fabulous. I made this for dinner tonight as a "test run" for Christmas Eve. It looked so pretty and we loved all the flavors. I used a premixed rice blend (white, brown, wild, and red) because it looked interesting at the grocery store. It turned out great. Thanks Kathy

Fantastic!! I couldn't find plain wild rice so I used a long grain and wild rice mix that cooked in 25 minutes and skipped the brown rice all together. I scaled it down to half, plenty for 3 of us. This was a perfect complimenting side dish for Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce (this site). We will be making this again, especially for special occassions. Thanks for the great dish.
