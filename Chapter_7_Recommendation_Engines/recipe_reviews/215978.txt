This was very good as well as quick and easy! I wasn't sure how I'd like the five-spice with fish, but it worked very well (and it masked the smell of the fish as it was cooking--bonus). I used catfish because the market was out of tilapia, and I added pecans because I didn't have enough almonds. The avocado, fish, and nuts worked really well together. I had lots of leftover salad, and it was delicious on its own (with dressing) the next day.

Make this often.  It's delicious as written.  We're on our second jar of Chinese Five Spice now.

The husband LOVES and requests it.  Likes the "secret sauce."

Balsamic vinegar is good, too, if you don't have Asian dressing.
------------
Making this tonight with SWAI (aka BASA) instead of tilapia.  Bigger fillets.  More to love.  Yum

I also made my own five-spice and salad dressing, and substituted the grapefruit for an orange.  It was tasty!  I will definitely make this again.  Even my meat-and-potatoes husband approved.

Made this tonight.  Didn't want to buy Chinese five-spice powder or Asian dressing so made my own and both were great!  Just did the rub with ginger, garlic, fresh ground black pepper, and cinnamon.  The salad and fish combo with the dressing were delicious!

What a lovely and healthy alternative to traditional fish recipes! I followed the recipe  quite closely, but had to substitute pineapple for the grapefruit.  I also didn't have the five-spice, so I made my own with cinnamon, cloves, and anise.  It was a delicious combination.  I served it over rice.

This was great. I don't like grapefruit so I substituted an orange and used a recipe for asian dressing I had on hand. If you are planning on serving this to four people I would double the amount of tilapia. My husband and I ate half of the salad portion but put an entire tilapia filet on top and it was the perfect amount of fish.
