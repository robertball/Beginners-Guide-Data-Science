Good flavors.  I marinated the chicken in the broth mixture for a few hours.  I ended up baking this because I don't have grill.  I lined my baking pan with foil, put the chicken and the broth in the pan and baked it at 350 for about 25-30 minutes.  It was so juicy and tender!

Pretty delicious, and easy. I didn't have thyme, so I used a clove of garlic instead. It turned out great and was very moist. I will make this again for sure. I didn't have a grill, so I cooked it in a glass baking dish lined with foil (not sure if foil was necessary, I'm still new to this cooking thing) and it cooked all the way through 3 pieces of chicken in 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Good stuff!

The grill was out, so I cooked this in the oven.  The ingredients all went into a baking dish, baking at 350 for about 35 minutes, finishing with a quick touch with the broiler.  For a little extra flavor, I put an extra splash of lemon juice plus 2 lemon wedges on top of each piece of chicken.
The flavors were all very subdued, but thanks to the extra lemon there was a nice lemon kick in every bit.  The meat was tender and juicy, and everyone enjoyed it.

This chicken is so easy I almost feel like I'm cheating when I say that I "cooked" dinner. I brushed the mixture on about every 3-5 minutes. The chicken was moist and tasty. Next time, I think I'll add some onion powder and garlic to the stock mixture.

Tasted great and simple to make!   Recommend making dressing first and then adding it to chicken in bag to marinade.
