Great comfort food; a wonderful pantry meal. I don t think you can go wrong using this structure. I substituted pork sausage for the ground beef and green olives because that s what I had on hand. Also used a tablespoon of chili powder. Thanks for the recipe!

Husband had seconds. Myself, I didn't care for it and next time I'm in the mood for Tamale Pie, I will look for a different recipe.  Probably one of the other ones that used a Jiffy cornbread mix.

Not my fave! The cornmeal did not separate from the filling during cooking as I expected from my experience with similar recipes, resulting in a mushy mess.  I'll choose a recipe that involves prebaking the crust next time.
