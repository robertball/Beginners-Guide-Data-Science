Moist, tall cake.  I didn't have any dried fruit, so instead I used 6oz. fresh blueberries and 6oz. cooked fresh cranberries.  Also didn't have brandy, so I used rum instead.  For the glaze, I mixed together cranberry juice, rum and powdered sugar.
The eggnog flavor really came through and I think this is one of the best pound cakes my husband and I has ever eaten!  We aren't sharing it with anyone!

An instant holiday favorite!  I can see myself making this every year!  I was going to take this to work, but my husband wouldn't let me.  :)  Thanks a bunch!

I made this recipe last year for friends and family, it was a hit! They  asked me to do it again this year. I made individual loafs.

This cake was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  I only used dried cranberries and cherries because that is what I had on had.  I didn't use the brandy called for either.  I used two tablespoons water and a 1/8 teaspoon rum extract.  In the glaze instead of water I used two tablespoons of eggnog and brandy extract.  I will make this again.

Very delicious! Can't taste the eggnog; I didn't have cranberries so I did what another reviewer did, I substituted fresh blueberries and cherries in proportions to equal 3/4 cup and soaked these in the sherry I had instead of brandy.

I made quite a few changes but still this came out excellent; it was delicious, soft and moist. First off, I had only dried cranberries so I added 1 cup cranberries and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also added 1/2 cup of almonds. Then I added 6oz of salted butter instead of 8oz (1 cup) and did not add salt. I did add 2tbsp of oil though. Also,I made the glaze with eggnog (instead of water), brandy and sugar. It came out perfect with the right amount of sweetness.

This recipe makes a gorgeous batter and a beautifully moist delicious cake! I omitted the brandied fruit (per my 7 yo 's request) and it still came out wonderful. I did substitute Disaronno for the glaze (personal preference) and it made for a sweet, crunchy crust. Cannot wait to devour and make again!

Awesome recipe! Great taste. Replaced the brandy with spiced brown rum. Added some almonds in the batter. And I heated up the sugar, water and rum glaze so that the sugar dissolved. So making this again for Christmas!

Followed the recipe and I really like the taste, but it came out pretty dry.
