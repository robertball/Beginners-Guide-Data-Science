I originally got this recipe from Taste of Home Magazine.

7-8 hours on low is way too long to cook this!  We've cut it down to 3 1/2 - 4 hours on low and it comes out PERFECT!  This has been a staple on our dinner table for years with this minor adjustment!

Perfect!  I loved this and am making it again tonight.  My husband complained that the meat tasted sweet. (He did not know that there was sugar in the recipe)  Since he prefers a "salty" taste over a "sweet" taste, I will omit the sugar for him.

This was fast and excellent.  I left out the chillis only because I didn't have any on hand.  I will surely make this again.  Thanks.

Good recipe! Note: we did make some modifications: omitted the green chilies, sugar, and chili powder. Reduced the vinegar to 1 tbsp. Added green onions, minced garlic, and dry red wine.

This was okay...I liked it better in tortillas.  Definately cut the time in half.  Did mine for about 5 hours and was still to long.  IT WILL OVERCOOK IF YOU DO IT FOR 8 HRS!  Forwarning!

My family and I loved this recipe for its simplicity and taste. I did not have chili peppers so I used chipotle chile pepper spice, added chopped garlic cloves, used red wine vinegar, and used beef broth instead of water. I followed the advice of other reviewers and only cooked it for 3 1/2 hrs and the meat was perfect. It was even more flavorful the next day and we used it in wraps with rice.

Super easy and delicious!  I served it over rice.  I couldn't slice the meat because it was so tender, so I just kind of shredded it up!  It was great!  Will definitely make again and again!  Going to try some rotel next time!

Wow! This was great and so easy. We added about 4 more ounces green chiles (not canned, but freshly roasted from the farm stand) since we love chiles. This is an awesome recipe for flank steak that actually turns out tender when left in the Crock Pot. Thanks so much!

Really easy and tasty.  I crushed up some garlic cloves instead of the powdered and next time may use beef stock instead of the water to beef up the taste.  Served it with garlic smashed potatoes, everyone was asking for seconds.  This is a keeper.

I don't think a slow cooker works well for most cuts of what are called flank steak. There's no connective tissue to break down, so for mine the juices just ran out & it became a hard piece of meat after about 4 hours.

The flavor of the ingredients did not become incorporated into the meat. Marinating in this mixture might be better, in fact marinating in s a solution to tenderize before using a slow cooker would be better yet.

I had the meat run through the tenderizer at the store and marinated it in the liquid mixture for about an hour before adding to crock pot.

I kept the ingredients basically the same, added fresh garlic instead of powder, added fresh mushrooms (which I added about half way through). I didn't brown the meat or onions before hand. I agree with the other comments about that step and made this a one-pot meal.


I cooked on high for 2.5 hours and finished on low for an hour (I was short on time and used a cooking time conversion chart in my slow cooker book).  I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch during the last hour.

The family loved it!  This is the first crock pot meal where they've eaten EVERYTHING! no left overs. They even asked for more!!! 

Will make again.

Made exactly like recipe except I used Splenda to keep this low carb.  Cooked it for about 5 hours on low and we absolutely loved this. The sauce is excellent and the meat cut up like butter. Definitely a keepr recipe.

I will be making this for the second time today. This recipe went over so well in my house, it's great, and with a few minor changes it was exactly the flavor that I was seeking. I used skirt steak instead of flank, and I cooked it on low for about 6.5 hours. I too left out the green chillies because I didn't have any, but the flavor didn't miss a beat. I may have added a bit more chili powder and pepper than the recipe called for, but it is because we like things a little more spicy. Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW... this was really easy and really tasty.  My husband and kids loved it.  I only cooked 6 hours and it was perfect.  We like our meat well done.  Only change I made was to use a chopped jalapeno in place of can of chiles as I did not have them.  Will definitely make again.

This was REALLY good! Definitely shorten the cooking time to about 5 hours.  And I wanted a thicker gravy so I made up a packed of brown gravy mix and stirred it in before serving.  YUMMY!

My very picky husband absolutely loved it! So in my book, that's awesome! It did taste great. I might try hot chilies next time. I served it with rice and ranch style beans.

I also got this recipe a few years ago from Taste of Home Magazine. It's very good with flank steak or london broil. My only complaint is the pre-slow cooker work that has to be done. I like to toss everything in the slow cooker, set it and forget it! But if you have some extra time in the morning it's a good one to try.

Ok I scored it based on how it was written. If I had not read to only cook the meat 3 1/2 to 4 hours I would have cooked it 8 hours on low and destroyed a perfectly good cut of meat(WHICH WAS NOT TERRIBLY INEXPENSIVE) I made as written and I have to tell you it was ok. The meat lacked flavor. Maybe if it marinated over night. This was just a hunk of meat and a little seasoning. Will I make again? Yes but needs more UMPH! I may even marinate over night then kick up some garlic cloves. It is a tasty strt to a good recipe but as written not so great!

This was excellent!! My family loved it! I substitued one red and green pepper for the green chilies. My family does not like spice. I also added cilantro which gave it great flavor. I still kept the chili powder. Served over brown rice!!! Loved it! will definetly do it again!

This was really good.  We did cook it the full 8 hours, so it was the perfect consistency for sandwiches.  I put on yeast rolls and it was yummy!

Yummy!  Even my picky kids ate it, but I did have to modify it-I used Italian seasoning instead of the chili powder, and green bell peppers instead of the green chilies. I left out the sugar, and used fresh Garlic because I was out of powdered.  I served it with rolls so the family could make Italian Beef Sandwiches and they loved it!

My inlaws are from Cuba, and my husband LOVES this recipe, better than any other Ropa Vieja ("old clothes") recipe I've tried. Because I saw the similarities, I didn't expect to slice this, but shred with two forks when it's done...perfect. I don't love the browning step, I think it adds good flavor, and worth it. I serve over white rice, fresh cilantro if you have it.

I substituted chipotle peppers for the chiles and cut down the cooking time to 5 hours on low and the steak was perfect, juicy, moist and full of flavor. Will def try this recipe again.

Very simple but the cook time is way to long; it wouldn't slice it just kind of fell apart.  I served it wrapped in tortillas. It was tasty and my family enjoyed it.

This was delicious. I followed other suggestions and only cooked this in the crock pot for 3-4 hours and it was perfect. Any longer and it probably would've fallen apart it was so tender. I didn't use peppers and it was still very flavorful and my husband raved about it.

I thought the meat had great flavor but it was extremely tough. The flank steak just became a stringy mess in the pot. Next time, I'd just do a pot roast.

This is excellent!  To simplify my life, I cooked this in my slow cooker.  I browned the flank steak in oil and then added the marinade & flank steak to my slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours.  The meat came out tender and so flavorful.

This was okay.  I was surprised to discover it was not spicy at all.  I was a little disappointed but the kids were delighted.  Followed the directions except reduced the time to 4 hrs b/c I prefer it sliced vs. shredded.  Some of the pieces were still a little pink though. Will probably make again and adjust to 5 hrs of time. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great dinner. I did not use chilis and cut the sugar 1/4 cup and used a yellow onion and a red onion. I also added some Pappy's seasoning and used Apple Cider vinegar. It was so tender that it just shredded and didn't need to be sliced. I put it in the crock pot and set it for 4 hours but it was ready at about 3 1/2 hours. It was a great meal. I always have a flank steak in my freezer and never know what to do with them. Now I have a great alternative to steak tacos.

This is really tasty!  I served with white rice and broccoli.  I was hoping to be able to slice the steak, but it just shredded when I cut it.  Also, the next morning, I threw the leftover steak in some scrambled eggs for some awesome "steak and eggs" breakfast!  Will definitely make again.

update:  I've made this several times now, and it's always good!  Because flank steak cooks very quickly, I've found that I can put in my slow cooker for only 1-2 hours on HIGH and it comes out PERFECT, and I can slice it very pretty!  Great Flavor, Great Recipe! Try it!

I was very disappointed with this recipe the flavor was just okay and I didn't care for the texture of the flank steak.  I won't be making this again.

This is such a great recipe.  It was very easy too!  I didn't use the green chilies but, it still turned out great.  Next time I will try adding some beans to it before serving.  The meat was tender and I only cooked it on low for 5 hours.

My husband and I really liked your recipe, we give you thanks for sharing it with us.  The only thing I changed was the Flank steak, I made it with Round steak and it tasted great.  Too bad we didn't have french rolls to make a sandwich out of it, since that's the way it looked and the weather here is so hot.
We thank you again for the recipe.

This is a great winter recipe when it is too cold to grill outside.  Meat turned out flavorful and tender.

The flavor was great but the steak was overdone...I should have paid closer attention to it after about six hours even though I did use a 1 1/2 pound cut of meat as the recipe calls for.  Instead of the chilies I used one hot cherry pepper.  I also used red wine vinegar.

This was so moist it fell apart on our plates.  I wasn't quite sure if I would like the chilies but it added a nice zip to this dish.  So easy to throw all this together and served with mashed potatoes it was fantastic!!
