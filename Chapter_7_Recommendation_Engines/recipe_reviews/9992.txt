this recipe freaked me out a little when i first read it. i tried it anyways and i think it turned out great. my dad is a huge oreo fan and is extremely disappointed if i don't show up with these on xmas. i did find it easier to put the filling on the cookies with a gallon size ziploc and cut a small corner off (or use a pastry bag). also, i thought that the amount was going to be more than i needed (based on the cookie recipe) but it turned out to be just enough.

Very good filling! It was slighty runny at first, but after being in the fridge for about 2 hours, it got a good consistency and kept it. Also, VERY easy to make, no problems at all making this.

Exactly what I needed for my oldest boy's birthday cake. I did add a little more vanilla, but that's a personal preferance. My husband said that this was pretty darn close to the real thing. EDITED: I have to agree. This filling is in-sane. NOTES FOR ME: 24 servings would be just right for a filling between two layers of cake.

It was messy to make, but if you use a deeper bowl to mix, it probably wouldn't be so messy. It was quite tasty, but I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I made it with faux-reo cookies and although my kids said they were good, they only ate a few each. I ended up throwing more than half of them out.

This is about the best frosting I have ever tasted! I think I will try it on lots of things- It would even be yummy between graham crackers. My butter and cheese were about room temp and I had to add a little splash of milk. Frosting was thick and I piped it on FAUX-REO cookies in a ziploc bag with the corner cut out.

This has become my favorite cookie filling!  I love the ratio of cream cheese to butter.  You can definitely taste the cream cheese, but it is not too cheesy.  If you are really looking for a filling to compare to the filling in an Oreo cookie, use only butter/shortening and no cream cheese.  Sometimes I use half almond extract and half vanilla and that is tasty as well.

Great filling for the faux reos and super easy. If your butter and cream cheese are room temp but not over soft then you shouldn't need to refrigerate to get the desired consistency. I ran out of filling before all the cookies were filled so i will make 1 1/2 batches next time(i probably over filled but this filling is too good not to) Would be great as frosting for carrot cake or banana cake...yum!

wow this filling is delicious.  i thought i was missing something after reading the reviews. it was a stiff filling rather than runny- others maybe melting thier butter rather than using soft butter.  i added an ounce of cream cheese because we love cream cheese and put in a zip-loc bag to squeeze out on cookies.wonderful and sinful- thanks

I used this frosting with the Faux-reo Cookies, and although a very delicious frosting, IMO, it doesn't taste like Oreo filling at all...
As others have stated, this frosting is better after sitting in the fridge for a bit.
If you're using for the Faux-reo cookies, and like them double stuffed, you may want to 1.5 the frosting.

This was good for what it is but I wouldn't say it's close to the inside of an oreo.  It is a very light and flavorful cream cheese frosting.  I did add a bit more vanilla to give it a little depth.

Good stuff! I was a bit leary of this, but it has good flavor, especially when paired with the Faux-reo cookie. The amount is spot on.. I halved the Faux-reo recipe and this one and had just the right amount of filling. Super quick and easy to assemble the cookies if you pipe this in with a regular round tip. Thanks so much! :)

This recipe was really easy to make.  It was a little stiff to pipe, so I added a little milk (about 1.5 Tbsp).  It was pretty tasty,  it tasted like Butter-cream icing that was a little cream cheese-y.  Next time I might double the cream cheese to have a more pronounced cream cheese taste.

This stuff was so awesome!  I used it in between the Faux-Reos cookies from here. It really made a  lot of filling, enough to generously fill the cookies.  I love it, thanks!

The key to this filling is using room temperature butter and cream cheese...I creamed those together first, then added the sugar, and had no problems whatsoever. Consistency was great, and with adding an extra 1/2tsp of vanilla, flavor was great as well. I've also made this and added a teaspoon of rum extract and everyone (kids included) absolutely loved it! Very versatile!

I love this filling, but only after I altered it. I do 8 ounces of cream cheese and only 2 cups of confectioners sugar. People absolutely LOVE the filling then.

very good! I halved the amount and it was enough to make 24 sandwich cookies, I used the Chewy Brownie Cookie recipe to make whoopie pies. I did have to add another 1/4 cup of icing sugar because I wanted a stiff filling.

this was just to thick on it's own and I had to add milk to it to thin it out, also really sweet. other than being very sweet it was pretty good and worth making again.

This was a great frosting.  I did use 8 ounces of cream cheese because it was very sweet.  I used this in the Faux-reo cookies and I also used it when I made the Cool Whip cookies using Red Velvet cake mix.

like others have said; it's good but it's not creme filling. i replaced the butter with shortening and added 1/2 cup marshmallow fluff in attempt to make it airy as opposed to densely creamy....personally, i like the mint oreos, so i added a touch of spearmint oil and green food coloring to it. yumm. just like all of the other oreo filings, feel free to experiment with flavors. coffee, chocolate, orange, raspberry, lemon, strawberry, peanut butter [i'd cut back on the cream cheese cuz of pb's grease content], etc.

This frosting seemed to be too sweet for the cookie it was designed for.  I would have used a much less sweet frosting.

I think it's much better after it's been refridgerated.  Just like the real thing, only better!

Excellent, Loved this recipe. I did try to use cream cheese frosting instead of cream cheese for half the recipe, just to see and it was wonderful.
