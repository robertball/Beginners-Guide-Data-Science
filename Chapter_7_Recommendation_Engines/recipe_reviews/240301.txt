Melt in your mouth recipe. I only reduced the sugar to half cup and used 1 cup of pecans for my taste. Oven temp and time was perfect for me. I tried this recipe in place of a passed down recipe I was not quit happy with.  Will use this one going forward. Thanks for sharing!

While this recipe produced very nice, not too sweet cookies, something is not right with the directions.  I halved the recipe and got about 32 1" cookies (used a cookie scoop). I have no idea how you can only get two dozen 1" cookies using the entire recipe.  I also baked the cookies for much less time than stated, about 10-12 minutes in a 350 degree F oven, 20 minutes they would have been burned.  I realize all ovens cook a little different, but I can't help but wonder if the recipe got messed up when Allrecipes posted it.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe for a great cookie.

These were a huge hit! I was scrolling through cookie recipes just getting my Christmas ideas and came across these delectable delights. My only problem was I had no vanilla! Panic ensued me as I really wanted these at that moment. So, I got in my cupboard and saw that I had Almond Extract. Oh! Y-U-M-me! I threw in some pecans and made these. I needed more sugar though and about an extra half tsp. of the Almond Extract.  I baked them for about 15-18 minutes.  This recipe made over 40 snowballs. I can't wait to try these with Vanilla!

This recipe was delicious! Instead of shortening, I used peanut oil and instead of white sugar, I used confectioner's sugar.  They turned out great! I will be making these again for the holidays!

Made as directed with pecans. Bland tasting. Would recommend using almond extract vs. vanilla. Recipe made 48 cookies. Similar recipe using cream cheese better.
