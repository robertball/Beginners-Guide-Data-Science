I tweaked this recipe and it was fab! 1 cup of oil seemed so excessive! What a load of calories! I replaced with 1 cup apple sauce. Super moist! I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour. Instead of the brown sugar, I used healthier sweeteners. Oh so good! A great way to sneak in zucchini for the kids!

I used ALL whole wheat flour; oats instead of wheat germ; extra raisins (plumped); used 1/2 cup applesauce (sweetened with splenda) and 1/2 cup of oil instead of the whole cup of oil;  then decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.  Very moist.  Everyone loved it.

I was looking for a healthy zucchini bread (something with whole wheat flour) so I tried this.  I used 2/3 cup of applesauce and only 1/3 cup oil to cut down the calories and it turned out perfect.  Healthiest and best zucchini bread ever.  Next time I might try with only 1 cup sugar as it was quite sweet.

Great recipe. The bread was moist, had great color and flavor. I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for the oil, used only whole wheat flour, 1 cup of brown sugar, and added 1/4 cup of flax seeds. I  baked the bread last night and served it this morning. It was sweet, but not too sweet, with a nice nutty flavor. I'll be making this regularly from now on.

Delicious!  I substituted flaxseed meal for half of the oil (1.5 cups flaxseed meal for 1/2 cup oil) to add in some omega 3s.  A definite hit with the family and very easy to whip up.

This was yummy!  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup oil, and substituted flax seeds for the wheat germ.  I made mini-muffins instead of a loaf, baked at 340 degrees for 10 minutes...very moist and delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  It was lighter and less sweet than other zuccini breads I've had and just had lots of texture with the raisins and the nuts.  I used quick cooking oats instead of the germ and it still came out really well =)

I love this recipes and have made it many, many times. I make mini-muffins from this recipes and feed them to my anti-veggie 3 year old. He loves them and thinks they are a real treat without knowing that he is downing veggies! I usually add extra zucchini, cut back on the sugar a bit and sometimes substitute some applesauce for some of the oil. Still come out great!

Tasty & healthy, my kids love it, what more could you want?  To make it even tastier & healthier, I substitute unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, and when I make muffins out of the batter I substitute fresh blueberries for the raisins & walnuts.  Delish!

This was awesome!! I added more zucchini and used 200mL apple sauce, 50mL oil. I also made it into 18 muffins. Next time I'll add a few more spices, but these were insanely moist and delicious. Everyone loved them. Mmmmmmm. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Very tasty.  For the oil I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter.  For the sugar I used 1 1/2 cup chopped dates...no sugar.

In this recipe i reduced the sugar to 1 cup and substituted half the oil for applesauce to reduce the fat level.  I have found in previous recipes that if you use all whole wheat flour you get a very dense quick loaf and it is not as light so keep the flour as stated in the recipe.  I like to add raisins which have been soaked in apple juice for a half hour.  I used one half cup of chopped walnuts in this loaf.  It was moist and healthy!  Awesome!  I will make this loaf once weekly, for it is a nice healthy snack!

A healthy yet light zucchini bread.  For moms or dads who are looking to boost the fiber for their little ones, I used 1/3 cup of each: oil, applesauce, and prune puree.  The taste of the prunes are not noticeable in the final product.  I decreased the sugar to slightly less than 1 cup.  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  I used 3/4 cups of brown sugar and applesauce instead of oil.  I also used wheat pastry flour because I had it available.  The bread is not soft and mushy the way so many zucchini breads are.  Before adding the raisins, I soak them in boiling water for a few minutes to soften them.I add cranberries (fresh) when I don't have raisins.  It also freezes very well.

I changed this recipe a bit and it turned out perfectly! I used only egg whites, 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup regular applesauce, only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and only 1/2 tsp of salt. (I also omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have it on hand.) The bread was tasty and delicious! I will definitely make it again!

AWESOME!  I actually was able to make 3 small loaves out of the recipe, and only cooked them for 40 min at 350F.  I used all whole wheat flour, cane sugar vice brown sugar, and 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Fantastic!  This recipe is a keeper

I just love this bread, even though it is summer right now!! 
I followed some reviews and I replace all the oil with apple sauce (the texture of the cake was so perfect). I also put a full 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of the mix. And I put 1/4 cup of wheat germ as well as 1/4 cup flaxseed meal. 
I buy everything organic. When I eat it in the morning with my two eggs, it makes me feel really healthy:)
I brought it to my coworkers one day and they keep asking me to bring some more. 
It is also very easy to make:)
And, I have yet to try, but I am sure that you can replace the zucchini with grated apples and here you have the perfect apple cake!

This recipe is very close to my grandmother's.  It's nice and dark, not like those pale loaves that other recipes have produced.  I use all whole wheat white flour (it has a milder flavor than the regular whole wheat flour) and you'd never know it wasn't white flour!  My kids LOVE it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made it twice now and loved it both times.  Followed others' suggestions about substituting 1/2 apple sauce for the oil and oats for the wheat germ.  Didn't know the amount and just did the full 1/4 cup.  Worked fine.  Only issue is that the recipe doesn't specify the size or number of loaf pans or how to prepare them.  I used just one 9 5/8 x 5 1/2 and the batter filled it to the top.  I should have known it was too much, but didn't want to try to take some out, etc.  When baking, it extended over the sides.  In the future (and there will be), I intend to use two loaf pans, greased and floured.  Make sure to let the bread cool completely before trying to get it out of the pan.  The loaf is quite dense/heavy and will break apart if it is still warm.

What an amazing recipe!  I actually signed up with this sight so that I could rate it.  I love to bake and always try to use only whole wheat flour.  This recipe blows every other recipe for quick bread I have used out of the water.  I did what others suggested and used 1 cup brown sugar, all whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of the oil.  I also made 24muffins instead of the bread and added 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips to half and 1/3 cup walnuts to the other half.  After having success with the zucchini today I used 3 bananas instead of the zucchinis and it was fantastic as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe.  I decided to take the advice to sub out the oil for apple sauce.  I found the bread be a bit rubbery, it seems like this was due to the lack of oil.  Maybe next time I will try half oil and half applesauce.  Thanks!

Very moist, and a perfect way to get rid of extra zucchini. Like other reviewers, I used applesauce instead of the oil and cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup. This bread had a lot of taste.

I changed the recipe by:
* using all whole wheat flour
* using 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda
* using Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs
* using unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and 
* using 1/2 extra cup of grated zucchini and 1 1/2 cup of raisins

I ultimately doubled the recipe since I had enough zucchini and it made two loaf pans and one 8x8 glass pan and rose rather well.

My kids (9 y.o. and 15 months old) both loved it and so did I!  Will definitely keep this one around for a yummy, healthy alternative to my mom's recipe!

I've made this recipe 10+ times! Turns out perfectly every time. I usually don't use as much sugar (about half the amount) because I find that the raisins sweeten the bread enough. I've also tried half carrot half zucchini when I ran out of zucchini one time and it turned out great.

I think the recipe is decent.  I subbed applesauce for the oil, all whole wheat and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I think it could have used more sugar, it wasn't sweet enough.  Ah well, I'll know for next time!

This was wonderful.  I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was very moist.  Entire family enjoyed it.

This is the best zucchini bread I've ever made.  I used 1/2 c. applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil and it turned out great.  I also used all whole wheat pastry flour instead of half and half.  The bread is very moist and flavorful.  Will definately make it again.

I substituted applesauce for the oil in this recipe. That change, along with the whole wheat flour and wheat germ makes for a very nutritous, delicious treat!

I used 2/3 c. applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil as someone else suggested. VERY good stuff and I will make it frequently. I added only half the raisins and walnuts, might dump them all in next time.  Be careful if you're making this in a glass pan-I thought mine was done earlier than the 60 min as called for (the edges were very dark brown) but it needed more time in the middle. Go for the full 60, I say.

This recipe was great- used whole-wheat only, half unsweetened applesauce/ half oil, oats instead of wheat germ, used extra vanilla, zucchini and cinnamon. Makes one very nice large loaf of healthy goodness!

I was looking for a zuchinni bread recipe that was like the one my grandma makes, but this one's better! The bread is moist and dense; so sweet! My one year old twins love it. So do I. There's nothing that could make this recipe any better.

Yummy! It didn't knock me off my feet or anything, but moderately healthy and very delicious. Reduced the oil slightly. I could see subbing bananas or apple sauce. Used cashews and dried sweet cherries. Added 1 cup extra zucchini. Made two good-size loaves, done in 50 minutes, and you'd never guess the whole wheat if you're a ww hater :-)

Great Recipe! I used 1/3 cup of oil and 2/3 of applesauce. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I made one loaf and the rest muffins. My three kids as well as my husband did not leave much left overs.

This was a big hit with family and all the friends lucky enough to get some!  I cut the cinnamon in half and substituted rolled oats for the wheat germ as some previous reviewers suggested.  This is the zucchini bread for us from now on! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is great! I made some tweaks to make it a lot healthier and I make it all the time..everyone loves it!   1 cup applesauce instead of oil.  All whole wheat flour.  Added a bad banana and only 1/2 cup brown sugar. (It is plenty sweat with that and the raisins!)  Don't have wheat germ, so oats work.

I also did 1/2 applesauce/ 1/2 oil, stuck with the recipe types of flour, and did shredded apples instead of zuchinni. It is pretty good. I would call it a "healthy" taste, but good.

Very good, although I made them into muffins and they got very stuck on the paper cups I used....maybe b/c I used 2/3 cup applesauce and only 1 cup oil?  Not sure, but they were still yummy.

I always half the cooking oil with apple sauce to reduce the fat and increase the vitamins and fiber.  This was a great find and my family loved this bread at all meals but best with a salad and as a breakfast bread.

This recipe grew on me. My first bite, I didn't care for as it isn't your "classic" zucchini bread... but the more I ate it, the more I liked it. I used only 1 c brown sugar, applesauce instead of oil, and oat bran instead of wheat germ. The two mini-loaves I baked only needed to be in the oven for 30 min, and the large loaf I made was done in about 45.

Wonderful recipe, healthier with great flavor and consistency. I substitute oat bran for wheat germ and pecans for walnuts, which comes out great -- getting many raves. I have to keep making more loaves!

I have made this bread twice reducing the oil to 2/3 cup and adding 1/3 cup more zucchini. Since the recipe did not indicate the pan size, I used my bundt pan, sprayed with oil, sprinkled the top with Demerara natural sugar, and baked it at 350 in convection oven for 45 minutes.  Turned out beautiful. I, otherwise, made it according to the recipe.  I love the nutty flavor. It will definitely be a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yummy & healthy. I Really enjoyed this & So did my 13 month old! Made a plain batch with walnuts in a muffin tin for my husband, and added mixed dried fruit to the loaf for me and baby. For my first attempt at making a loaf like this I was surprised at how easy it was. However it took longer to bake than recipe stated.

I tried this today and was very pleased with the results.  I took the advice of the others on the message board and cut the cinnamon in half.  I also added about 1/2 cup of halved maraschino cherries to give it a little color and make it more appealing to my family.  It turned out fantastic.  I'll pass this one on to my mom!

This is really good bread.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I did have a mishap though.  I did mention in my profile that my cooking tragedies are always when I’m baking well it happened again.  I took the bread out about 1 hr of baking I inserted a toothpick and it came out clean, my little voice told me the toothpick did not reach the bottom but I chose not to listen, the problem came when I when to put it on the cooling rack, the bottom caved in, the bread was not fully cooked, I had to try to put it back in the pan, what a mess.  It didn’t turn out nice looking but it sure is good.  Next time I will insert a knife or something that I’m sure will reach the bottom of the pan.  A lesson learnt.

I doubled this and used half unsweetened applesauce and half oil.  We are super impressed! I begged my husband to try it  even though he does not like other zu-breads I have made and he is really enjoying it.  Thank you!!!

This recipe is delicious.  It tastes just as good as my mothers recipe but more nutritious with the whole wheat flour and wheat germ.  I used oat flour instead of whole wheat and it worked out great.

After cutting the oil and adding applesauce as one review suggested, I loved this bread.  It went over very well with the whole family, and my husband ate it for days after.

I am no cook, much less a baker, but I do have a picky 18 month old at home and I'm trying to vary up her diet and get in some veggies and this recipe was easy and delicious!!  I took a few tips from others and the bread turned out beautifully: Subsituted 1/2 cup of canola oil & 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce  1 cup of blueberries (vs. rasins) added 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds ) Used less sugar (1 cup) I used some of the batter to make muffins which took about 20 minutes to make...then we can grab them on the go.

Pretty good.  I made one loaf as the recipe states, and one loaf substituting vegetable oil for canola oil, and brown sugar for splenda.  The "diet" loaf was just as good as the "non diet"

My whole family loved this.  I did substitute  applesauce for some of the oil.  It's great to be able to pig out on this bread and still know that it's healthy.

I baked one loaf of this last night to take to work.  The whole thing was gone in just a couple of hours.  Several people gave me great comments about how moist and delicious it was.  I was initially a bit alarmed by how dark it appears when baked, but it certainly seemed to go over well.

This was a really good zucchini bread. The only thing I thought should happen would be to cut the cinnamon in half. I think the full amount is too strong and leaves a slight aftertaste.

Made this in a glass 9" x13" casserole and it turned out perfect. I had to make the following substitutions because i was out of some stuff:
Oats for wheat germ
Sunflower seeds for nuts
All white flour
Fresh cut up apples instead of raisins.
I took others' advice and did half apple sauce, half oil. I added extra cinnamon plus some cardamom. It was insanely moist and flavorful with a delightful texture. It took exactly sixty minutes to bake, just as the recipe stated. This was a winner. ??

This turned out okay..I've never had zucchini bread before. I split the batch between a loaf and 6 miffins. I substituted applesauce for the oil and egg whites for the eggs. I also used all whole wheat flour, used flaxsed instead of wheat germ, cut the sugar in half, and used walnuts. I may use a little more brown sugar next time...but I like my muffins not too sweet.

I love this recipe. I make it for my kids and they just love it. I make it as mini-muffins -which bakes in about 15 mins. 
I did make a few of the suggested adjustments -
I cut sugar in half 
I used instant oatmeal instead of wheat germ 
Use 1/2 cup oil and 
add 1/2 cup applesauce. 
If using coconut oil (which I do)- add last. 
Omit nuts and raisins (just because my kids are still young), 
I'll be working on some flax seed additions the next time around. Great recipe though!

Made a double batch last night.  It was actually alot!  Came out to be 24 muffins, 1.5 loaves and 24 mini muffins!  Was very moist, but was a little "too healthy" for what I was looking for.  I would not recommend doing mini muffins since you can't get all the nuts/raisins in each of those little muffins!  tasty though.

This recipe was great!  I did cut out more of the white flour & replaced it with the whole wheat flour & it was delicious.  It had a nutty taste to it.  My kids loved it too!

Very good. I read several reviews and decided to make this as healthy as possible. I used all whole wheat flour and used applesauce instead of oil. I did add dried cranberries and walnuts. This was very good. I will be making this again really soon.

I doubled the batch, leaving out the walnuts and raisins in one loaf and adding walnuts and chocolate chips in the other loaf.  Both were a hit!

This turned out great, one of the best zucchini breads I've made.  Lessened the sugar a bit and used half applesauce for the oil but otherwise made as directed.

This is what I would call "classic" zucchini bread. It was slightly heavy (but in a good way). I only wish I had the raisens to add - I will next time.
