02.03.17 ~ A heavy, dense cake that has just the right amount of spices. I had a abundance of blackberries I was trying to use when I came across this recipe. My DH really enjoyed it. I used buttermilk in place of the soured milk as I had some on hand. I really enjoyed the frosting. I did omit the coconut and the pecans as DH wanted just plain frosting. The cake is very good and a nice use for blackberries.
