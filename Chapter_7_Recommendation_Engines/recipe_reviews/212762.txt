I was a little disappointed with this recipe. At first, I didn't like a brownish color of this chutney. At second, I had a difficulty to blend this chutney to a paste, I had just small dry mint pieces. This recipe, in my opinion, consists too less liquid, so I had to add oil to grind. If you add just water, it doesn't help, or you need too much water. The taste was a little bland.
