The potatoes need to be cooked a little before slicing and adding to the lasagna.  They never finished cooking and had to be taken out as we ate.  The vodka sauce was a little too creamy with all of the cheeses.  I'd recommend mixing the vodka sauce with a tomato sauce.  Also, with the amount of food listed, you need larger than a 2 quart casserole dish.

This was absolutely delicious and easy to make! I love this recipe. I used small yukon gold type potatoes and red pepper rather than green pepper. I also used a tomato/basil marinara sauce instead of vodka sauce. This is the best thing I have eaten in a long time, and I live in France--land of food. I highly recommend this whether you are a vegetarian or not! Plus it's healthy!

with a few adjustments this is excellent. The potatoes as stated need to be  "thinly" sliced, very thin and they will cook. I used regular red sauce and Italian seasoning, and what the heck since it's lasagna I added some ground beef and Italian sausage to the layers. served with garlic bread and salad.

I looked at all of the reviews prior to making this. You do not need to cook the potatoes beforehand provided you slice them thinly (I used my mandolin) and you bake the dish a bit longer (I did 1 hour covered, 15 minutes uncovered). I also wouldn't use red potatoes since they don't get quite as soft as other types. I mixed some seasonings into the vegetable mixture (oregano, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper) and used a basil tomato sauce. It was outstanding. Thanks for the concept!

The flavor was very good.  Even my husband liked it!  I substituted fat free tomato basil sauce for the vodka sauce. I had some trouble with the potatoes being undercooked.  I think next time I will try baking them first, letting them cool enough to handle, and then slicing them and putting them in layers.  I will make this again.

It's difficult to get the potatoes thin enough.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook them before layering the lasagna or not, so we didn't.  Definitely make sure you cover this up with foil, or the potatoes will be tough.  We might try this again, with regular gouda instead of smoked gouda.  The smoky flavor was too overwhelming.

I am a terrible cook.  I never know what goes well together so I have to follow recipes exactly.  I made this for dinner last night and could not believe how delicious it was!  First of all, I don't like to cook but this recipe was very easy so that's a big plus.  Second, I don't usually like what I make even though the rest of my family loves my cooking.  But when I sat down to eat this meal, I could not wait to have seconds.  It didn't taste like what I expected from the ingredients.  It was very different, and very yummy.  I cannot wait to make it again!

REALLY good!  It was helpful to read the reviews before hand.

Note:  It will create a lot of "juice" between all the veggies and the marinara sauce, but it was wasn't runny.

My guests loved it.  Left a clean 9x13!

Using what I had on hand, I ended up changing this entire recipe but for my own personal record, will comment and rate it.    I used white potatoes, cut very thinly (mandolin size), sliced zucchini in place of the carrots, red pepper instead of the green, and a cheese fondue mixture (we live in Switzerland so American cheeses are hard to come by). I added a container of cottage cheese and used seasoned tomato puree instead of the vodka sauce.  So really a completely different recipe but very tasty. It ended up like more of a Lasagna Stew which I thought was delish and so did the kids.

this was a pretty good recipe, but I would suggest more marinara sauce and more cheese!

I thought this was great, although a bit of work. Do slice the potatoes VERY thinly and cook longer (I cooked for 1hr 15mins. Used tomato/basil spaghetti sauce and added some ground beef to the sauce. Threw in extra veggies and fresh parsley and it was fabulous!

I made more and cooked it alot longer than what the recipe says.  I browned some ground beef and added it as a layer between the potatoes and vegetables.  I also added sliced zucchini and italian style diced tomatoes to the vegetable mixture and forgot to use spinach.  I highly recommend using the vodka sauce as the recipe calls for.  You can make the dish less rich by adding extra veggies, but the flavor of the vodka sauce is essential.  This stuff was a huge hit with the whole family and I'll definitely make it again and often.

Here are my changes: I used thinly sliced russet potatoes, frozen sliced carrots (thawed), and I added a layer of ground beef and Italian sausage. I did not have Gouda cheese, so I added a little bit of grated Parmesan. I baked the dish at 400¬∞ for one hour and 20 minutes, and then uncovered and baked at 350¬∞ for 10 minutes more. I thought it was amazing and will definitely make again!

Lots of potential. I thought I'd beat the odds and NOT need to pre-cook the potatoes if I sliced them thin enough, but even after 45min. in the oven, they were not quite fully cooked. Tons of potential here, it's a great tasting, hardy veggie dish. Added extra spices (onion powder, italian spices...) and some parm/romano cheese to the mix added great flavor.

Very tasty and easy! I did add some oregano, salt, pepper and parsley to spinach mix (personal preference) as well as some poached chicken cut into small pieces for complete one pan meal :-) DH loved it! Thank You for this recipe.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer.  It was really good. 

The potatoes were not as tender as expected but they were tender enough to eat. In fact had they been any softer I may not have liked it as much.

Loved this recipe. My husband and toddlers did, too! I didn't have any Gouda, so I used Parmesan. And, I did add some Oregano and Basil. Cooked for an hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered. The potatoes were done.
