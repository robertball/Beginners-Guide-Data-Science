This recipe turned out really well. I made it for Mother's Day and it was a hit! I didn't use the preserves for fear that it would be too rich - instead I used fresh strawberries and whipped topping in the middle to hold it together.  A warning for those considering making it - its really hard to remove the brownie from the pan and move it to make a layered cake. Still, the combination of the dense brownie, the light whipped toping, and the fresh fruit was delicious. To make it more healthy I used apple sauce instead of oil in the brownies and light whipped topping. You can also buy sugar free brownie mix that tastes almost as good as regular with fewer calories. Highly recommended for chocolate and strawberry lovers.

A wonderful idea. The recipe is very easy to follow and result nice-looking. However it is way too sweet for me and my family members, even though I used fresh strawberries.  Next time I will try a sponge cake instead of brownie.  BTW I put a piece of greased parchment paper underneath the brownie which made it easy to take out the brownie from the baking pan.

Very easy to make!  Made for Father's Day and the whole group loved it and it looked very pretty covered with the fresh strawberries.  Next time I would not add the chocolate syrup, made the dish a bit too sweet for my taste.

Ultra rich dessert and perfect for people who like this type of treat.  For me, just too sweet.

This cake was very good!! My class had a potluck and loves strawberries so i decided to make a strawberry cake and came across this recipe. I'm not very fond of homemade brownies so all I did was bought 1 box brownie mix and 1 box of white cake and layered it. As for the filling, i used COOL whip mixed with slices of whole stawberries and frosted the whole cake with COOL whip. It was very good and I had some extra strawberries on the side and places it all around the plate with the cake. VERY VERY GOOD!!

This was absolutely fabulous and easy to make.  The only difficulty I had was removing the brownie from the pan.  If you can manage to get a small spatula under the brownie, you can slide it around to help loosen the brownie from the pan.  I also used fresh strawberries in the middle, but it was slightly dry.  I might try adding a strawberry sauce next time.  Even slightly dry, this was a fabulous dessert.

Very tasty. I accidentally broke the brownie moving it so I made it layered in a bowl and it was still good.

This was really good, just sweet enough. I didn't have any strawberry preserves so I just sliced strawberries and put in the middle. I also drizzled the chocolate syrup in the middle and on top.

I made these for the holiday, I used the jumbo muffin tin to presonalize them. Sliced in half to make a sandwich, put vanilla ice cream fresh sliced strawberries topped with the other brownie half and topped that with cool whip and milk chocolate sundae sauce...Delicious, hubby ate 2 yesterday.... Oh i used milk chocolate brownie mix as well.

This was a fantastic idea. I made it with homemade brownies (the recipe on the Tollhouse Cocoa Powder box) and whipped up homemade whipped cream with strawberries ripe from the vine. It was a hit!

Great idea, but fresh strawberries in place of the preserves make it much less sweet, and much better.

The cake turned out great. I followed the cake instructions on the brownie mix by adding 3 eggs instead of 2. I also added vanilla pudding to the whipped cream. It was not too sweet.
