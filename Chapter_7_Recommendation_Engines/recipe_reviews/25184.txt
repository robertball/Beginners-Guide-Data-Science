We absolutely loved this recipe!!!!!  I used six chicken breasts.  After I placed them in the bottom of my crock pot, I practically covered them with Creole Seasoning.  (I used Tony Charachere's - a staple here in south Louisiana.)  I added to the original recipe 1/2 can tomato paste, about l cup of chicken broth, and one can of Rotel tomatoes.  I used 3 stalks of celery, 4 whole cloves of garlic plus 3 cloves minced, 3 fresh jalapena peppers, seeded and chopped.  Instead of a four ounce can of mushrooms, I used a package of sliced, fresh mushrooms.  I cooked it on low for six hours, then switched it to high for two more.  I served it over rice.  In fact, I used a brand new kind of rice (new to me) I found at the grocery this morning:  a blend of texmati white, brown, wild and red rice made by Royal Blend.  I don't know how much it added to the recipe, but we sure liked it.

As a native New Orleanian I just couldn't make this without fixing it so that it would be more like Creole and not just chicken in tomato sauce, so I added some ingredients that are in a classic Creole sauce, (well ignoring that it's not shrimp, but chicken).  I cut up the chicken into small pieces, used 28oz of crushed tomato in a can instead of the stewed tomatos, added 1/4 - 1/2 c dry white wine, abt. 5 dashes of worcestershire sauce, abt. 8-10 dashes of hot sauce, and a pat of butter.  I omitted the mushrooms, and jalapenos, (not Creole).  It's still not a true Creole sauce, but it's decent to put over rice and serve to the family or close friends as long as I don't claim it's Creole.  BTW a true Creole sauce takes a million ingredients and half of your day, Creole is the fancy New Orleans style of cooking and almost always has some kind of sauce.  Cajun cooking is more country fare and can usually be made in one or two pots.  Cajun cooks had a farm or a boat to tend to and didn't have time for fancy dishes, unlike the wealthier people in the city.

I took this recipe and suggestions and came made it soo good there wasn't any leftovers. I took 6 chicken quarters seperated into leg and thigh. Added 3 tbl of creole seasoning, 14.5 can whole tomatoes, 1/2 can tomato paste, 3 jalapenos whole, 1 small bay leaf, 2 red onions quartered, 2 stalks celery, 12 cloves of garlic (whole)I didn't put bell pepper or mushrooms because I didn't have any. I'm sure it would be wonderful with it. It was juicy and had a kick to it. I took the broth and put it in a pan and reduced it a bit then added flour to make a roux. Last minute addition was 1/2 lb kielbasa I heated then added to the mix (just an afterthought) served this with "Cuban beans and rice" found on here. it was excellent! I'm sure there will be no complain of it being bland!

This recipe was excellent.  I will definately be making it again.  I took the advice of others and added more spices.  I added tobassco, red pepper flakes, cayanne and extra garlic because I love garlic.
I prepared everything the night before and threw it all together before I left for work.   The apartment smelled so good when I got home.

A true delicacy!!  5 stars doesn't do justice to this succulent dish!  I added an additional onion, 1/2 can of tomato paste, 1 cup of chicken broth.  Cooked in crock pot on high for 5 hours & served over white rice... chicken turned out EXTREMELY tender & moist! Next time I think I'll add okra & substitute shrimp for the chicken.

This was a great recipe. I made a few changes to it. I 86'd the jalepenos and added some tobasco. I also only put two chicken breasts (because there are only two of us) and since there was a lot of juice, I added some instant rice and it made a perfect one pot meal. Will definitely make this again!

I doubled the amount of chicken and pretty much kept the rest of the recipe the same, however I used the Creole Seasoning Blend found also on this site (which is an excellent seasoning!!) Cooked on low for 12 hours, and the chicken was fork tender. Great recipe, thanks!!

Excellent. Instead of the jalapeno pepper, though, I added tobasco sauce and I only cooked it for 9 hours instead of 10 hours on low. The chicken was tender and all the flavors blended in together. This is a definite keeper.

This was good and easy to make and not at all spicy.  If you like your dishes hotter, I would take the recommendation of other reviewers and add  hot sauce, pepper flakes, or more jalape√±os.  I put the chicken breasts in the slow cooker frozen and cooked on high for about 6 hrs.  Turned out perfectly.  My husband loved it and I will make it again.

This recipe was so easy to make and it came out full of flavor and so tender.  You could probably pour over pasta or rice, but we just ate it plain and went back for seconds and thirds!

Love it!  Spicy, but not too spicy.  Instead of the can of tomatos, I added a can of tomatos, okra, green chiles, and corn.

This was a huge hit in our house! I bought Tony Chachere's "More Spice" Seasoning and coated the chicken liberally. I let it marinate while I chopped the vegetables. I omitted mushrooms and celery and added 3 zucchinis. I added 1/2 a can of tomato paste and a can of chicken broth and used diced jalapeno peppers I had in the fridge instead of fresh (about 1 1/2 teaspoons-we like it hot around here). Other than these changes, I followed the recipe as written. My husband loved it and the house smelled amazing when we returned from shopping. I am not sure why some people haven't been impressed with this. I think "season to taste" has something to do with it. They are probably not putting enough seasoning in. Sprinkle the heck outta that chicken and let it sit while you chop everything and you should be impressed! Thanks for the recipe, Mary:)

I am giving this 5 stars for total ease and flavor.  The only changes I made were adding chicken broth, 2 bay leaves and using fresh mushrooms.  I also browned the chicken first as I always do when making meat in the crockpot.  Cooked on high for 5 hours then on low for about an hour.  Yum!  Thanks

The flavor of this chicken dish is fantastic!  I used 3T of creole seasoning blend (from this site) and it was very flavorful.  I increased the celery & garlic and would do so again.  I wanted to shred the chicken breasts at the end of cooking & scoop over a steaming bowl of rice, so it needed a little more liquid.  Per other reviewers, I added 1 cup chicken broth & 1/2 of a (6oz) can of tomato paste. I used a 10oz bag of fresh sliced mushrooms I had on hand instead of the canned and that worked out great!  I put in the jalapeno whole (w/ a slit in the side) & added a few dashes of Tobasco to the pot and that gave the right amount of heat for us.  Thanks for this simple and tasty recipe!

My husband would give it 5, I would give it 3.  He loves it.  I'm mixed.  I made it exactly as described in the recipe, and it didn't need extra liquid.  It's not supposed to be a soup.  I would say that it definitely had flavor as is, but then also didn't...?  It tasted a bit like a roast chicken from the super market, meaning that it tastes of chicken but not like bland chicken.  I just couldn't categorize the flavor I was tasting.  Because I was worried (reading reviews made me paranoid), before I dished up for everyone else, I also added a couple drops of Tabasco but I'm not sure it needed it.  You can taste the Tabasco, but then you can taste the original meal flavor as a separate entity along side it.  It's a very odd experience.  But I will say that my mouth got saturated with it very quickly and I found I couldn't eat much.  It made me crave things that were mellow flavored and sweet, like a cinnamon bun.  Weird, no?

Haven't tried the recipe but just wanted to point out, Creole cuisine is not the same as Cajun cuisine. Creole denotes someone who is of mixed heritage, i.e. African/French/Spanish/Haitian et cetera who was born in the New Orleans area (at least that's one of the meanings). Cajuns on the other hand are a group of people who originated from Canada (French speaking) and settled in the bayou country in South Louisiana in the Lafayette and surrounding areas this area is referred to as Acadiana. Their cooking is distinctly different and the Creole borrows heavily  from the African cuisine, gumbo, jambalaya, et cetera. Thanks and enjoy.

This recipe is Great, and I definely will make it again.  I changed it a bit.  I didn't have any chicken breast, but I had some chicken tenderloins that I used.   I didn't have any Creole-style seasoning, and so I used the cajun seasoning that I had.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, but I had some diced tomatoes. I didn't have a can of mushrooms, but I had fresh mushrooms that I used.  I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, but I used two small cans of diced green chili. I did however use two things that are not not this recipe, and that was two chicken bouillon cubes and one cup of water. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was simple to make, especially when you chopped the vegetables the night before. However, because the seasoning amount is not specified I added too little in the morning. It had a very plain taste. I would say double the tomatoes and do about 4 tbsp of seasoning.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made just to the directions except for a bit more jalapeno and served them whole over a bed of rice. They devoured it. the package of breasts I used had 5 in it and there are 3 of us. I took the 2 remaining checken breasts and shredded them. Then I added a package of frozen gumbo vegetables and some egg noodles and made an abslutly wonderful soup. I love recipes like this! thanks so much!

This was yummy and easy. I cut up my chicken into pieces and added some turkey kielbasa. I added some extra cans of tomatoes, I like lots of juice, and then added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.Delicious.

This is the first time I have been disappointed by a recipe with such high reviews on this site.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and I think that was the problem.  Most other reviewers changed most of the recipe while still rating it 5 stars which is misleading.  How can you rate it five stars if you changed so much of the recipe??  However, my main disappointment is with the title of the recipe, which is misleading, while the house smells amazing, this tastes NOTHING like creole chicken.  It tastes honestly more like beef stew! (don't ask me how, still trying to figure that out)  This recipe (without alterations) is great for someone looking for a hearty chicken stew. It is actually pretty tasty if that is what you want, its just hard to want it if you go all day expecting creole chicken for dinner.  It ended up with very little liquid so I had to add another can of tomatoes and some corn just to help it out, and it still tastes like its missing something.

Love this recipe. I did use thighs since that's what I had and I forgot to add the mushrooms. Other than that, followed the advice of others and added some chicken broth. Served with brown rice and sauted cabbage. Next time will probably add a bit of Tabaco as well.

Made exactly as outlined. Tasted for spiciness at 11 hours on low in crock. Had absolutely NO flavor! Added a bay leaf, cayenne pepper, season salt, Zatarain's concentrated shrimp & crab boil (1 tsp)., turned up to high for another 2 hours. Was okay, but nothing I will make again. Very disappointed. Expected to taste more like the flavors of my husband's home state of Louisiana.

I really liked how this turned out. I will admit though that I made adjustments suggested by other reviewers. The creole seasoning I used had plenty of salt so I didn't add any additional salt or pepper. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed plus added a can of Rotel.  I also added 1/2 small can of tomato paste, some extra garlic and about 1 cup low sodium chicken broth. I also put in some okra the last half hour or so of cooking.  I omitted the mushrooms but that was just because family won't eat them. I cooked on low and everything was plenty done after about 9 hours. Since dinner wasn't for a while yet I ended up adding a cup of water the last little bit. (I chose water over broth since already seemed salty!)

I will probably make this dish again but with additions. I'm in south Louisiana, so maybe that's why I didn't think it was "creole" enough. It was too bland for my tastes and not thick enough--as creole sauces should be. Next time I'm going to add some dried cayenne and maybe some tomato paste. I served it over rice. Overall it was quite edible just needs some doctoring.

This recipe was pretty good and definitley very easy to make.  I think it is too light on the seasonings though, it was missing something. The flavour was a little bland.  I think I will make it again but I will add more spices to it next time.

Creole or not this recipe turned out pretty good.  It does need a little bit of extra flavoring though, I'm not sure what kind of flavoring but it does need something.

I made this recipe because I had a bountiful supply or tomatos from our garden was looking for a recipe to use them up. Wonderful flavor! I poured this over a bed of white rice. And ate it the next day and it was just as good if not better!

This turned out really good, so I am adding it to my dinner rotation. I did substitute the jalapeno for a habanero pepper. It gave it a kick! I also added a small can of tomato sauce. I served this over white rice. The whole family enjoyed it :)

I added a drained can of black beans to this recipe, and took out the jalapeno. Some of my family prefers bland food, and they even liked it. All in all it was a hit!

This recipe really needs to indicate how much creole seasoning to use.  It's fine for using "to taste" for salt and pepper but for spices and seasonings I think it needs to be specific.  I saw several reviews that mentioned this as well and a lot of them used too little.  Well I went the opposite way and used too much.  I made my own seasoning using a recipe I found on allrecipes which seems to have good flavor.  I ended up just adding a ton of water to the dish and made it into a soup which  helped.    I didn't add mushrooms and I added a couple of extra jalapenos along with the seeds.  It wasn't too spicy hot, just spicy.  I actually thought it would be more hot since I added additional jalapenos and seeds.  I also added some tomato paste like some of the others suggested.

Very good. I did follow others suggestions and added 1 cup chicken broth, don't know if I needed to unless you want/like more of a Jambalaya consistency over rice. Served with 2 cups dry rice, and it was AWESOME. Added 2 jalepenos and 2 serrano peppers since we like things really hot and it was amazing. Also, made recipe with 2.5 pounds boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and was great!

Absolutely wonderful, thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family. The only change I made though was that I added 3 tablespoons of tomato paste to give it a slightly richer flavour. A definite cook again.

I added some extras to mine. I added about 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth to it, 1/2 in the beginning and the other 1/2 of the broth when I added in about 1/2 lb of louisiana andouille sausage in the last hour of the cooking. I also added in about 2 tsp of tomato paste and some extra hot peppers to it at the beginning. Before I put the sausage in I decided to go ahead and shred up the chicken since it was already falling apart so easily. It turned out wonderful! We put it on top of a bed of rice in a bowl and served! Even our three year old son who doesn't like spicy stuff couldn't resist this dish!

I made this last night exactly as written, I only added 2 additional cloves of garlic and 1 additional jalepeno pepper and I just don't understand how it got such high reviews.  It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't incredible either.  It tasted like a chicken soup...and that was it.  I'm giving it 3 stars b/c it was ok, but not at all what I expected.

I was excited to make this recipe but was disappointed in the taste.  My husband politely said it was "good" but I think my expectations were a little high.  I added more garlic, tomato paste, and more onions, but this wasn't the homemade wonder that other reviewers depicted. I'm not saving this in my recipe box.

we love spicy foods and this one was great.  i placed my frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot and seasoned genourously then added the other ingredients (except celery) plus a can of rotel and small can of tomato paste.  i did add an extra jalapeno for a little more of a punch.  this cooked on high for 6 hours.  when i got home it was perfect.  the chicken done but not dry, shredded easily.  served over rice.  delish!!!!

Very easy.  I would have preferred it a little more spicy and a little less tomatoey.  I used frozen chicken thighs and cooked it until the meat fell off the bone.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yum!  This was just wonderful.  Perhaps a little salty... but that's okay.  I used ~3 Tbsp of Creole seasoning (prepack from Kroger), added a little zucchini and used oyster mushrooms instead of canned.  The chicken was wonderfully done... everyone enjoyed it.  I'll make it again in a heartbeat.

This was very good.  Per the suggestions of others, I like heat so I added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and a good splash of tobasco sauce.  I only cooked in the crock on low for about 8 hours, and the chicken came out fine.  I also doubled on the mushrooms and served with rice.

Very Good.  My husband loved this recipe.  I did 'spice' is up a little bit more by adding chipotle pepper sauce and red pepper flakes.  Chicken was tender and tasty.  I served it over white rice.

I liked this recipe.  The chicken was very moist and tender and the seasonings were OK but a little on the light side (but we like lots of spice!)  My husband didn't much care for it but he has an aversion to tomatoes.  I will probably make this again but would kick up the spice a bit.  Good recipe!

The only thing I changed is adding more celery (as much as the bell pepper, for the correct "trinity" ), 6 breasts, and a cup of chicken stock.  Incredibly easy and tasty, the whole family loved this.  Pro tip: it makes AWESOME omlette filler with a bit of cheddar cheese.

EXACTLY what I was looking for. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and I added Tony's for seasoning, about a cup or so of chicken broth, as well as a can of tomato paste. 

I also added some garlic powder and 3 dried bay leaves. I served it over white rice. The flavor is amazing and it re-heats well which is important because who wants to eat bad leftovers?!

Followed some others suggestions...added tomato paste, bay leaves water...added rice towards end and think i added too much. Added water to fix. It was good but not great. Next day added water and heated up and was amazing! One of those next day recipes!

I absolutely loved this dish!  The first time I made it I added the tomato paste as some uses had suggested.  The second time, I forgot, but it was still just as good.  I mixed with with some instant white rice and it was delicious!

This was a good, hearty meal - and so easy to put together!  I've been needing some good crock-pot meals for those busy days where I don't have the time or inclination to cook when I get home.  

Didn't have Creole seasoning so I threw together a little Cajun mix: onion powder, thyme, cayanne, salt, pepper.  Did not add bell pepper or mushrooms and it was still good.  I served this over rice (next time I will add a little water or chicken broth to the mix so it can soak into the rice a little more) with a salad on the side.  Will be making again!

I'm from the south and it was really good! Only change up I would suggest is for families with children eliminate the jalapeno pepper.  It was too spicy for my little ones, but other than that flavor was great!

I am trying hard right now to give this dish flavor.  I agree that you can't add Creole seasoning to taste.  I thought I liberally sprinkled it on each breast and the flavor was slight.  I read some reviews and noticed that people were adding 3 - 4 TBSP of it?!?!?!?  That is not a "to taste" amount.  So I just went and added it, along with some diced tomatoes to give it more texture.  I hope that this will work!!!  Otherwise, we are ordering pizza!  EDITED:  Since I added 4 TBSP of creole seasoning and added more tomatoes to my shredded chicken, I must say that this was indeed tasty and I will be making it again!

EXCELLENT!!! Teaching my teen how to use the crockpot and this was another winner!  Our chicken breasts were frozen so I omitted the broth and water. Added 3 stalks of celery but not mushrooms and green pepper. Fabulous over quinoa!!

Great recipe if you like Creole. Changes I made were to add 1 can tomato paste, more Creole Seasoning (to heat it up) and 1 cup water. Hubby loved it - served with fresh pita bread.

This was delicious. The chicken was tender and moist. It definitely had the right amount of spices. The house smelled wonderful.  Served over white Basmati rice.  modifications: Added 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 bay leaf, and 1 Tbsp of Cayenne pepper.

It turned out okay but we ended up tweaking it.  It's kind of frustrating that the creole seasoning says "to taste" when you're first making it because you don't know if you're putting too much or not enough.  We ended up adding more towards the end and it still didn't have enough flavor or spice.  We also threw in some tomato paste because there was a lot of liquid and not enough tomato flavor.  In the end we added some hot sauce into our individual bowls and it tasted just fine.  We'll give this recipe another go but will first read through more of the comments to see what other people did.

This recipe didn't really do anything for me.  I took the suggestions of others and added 1 c. broth and some tomato paste, which was a great idea as far as making more sauce.  I was worried that I'd seasoned the chicken too much with salt, pepper and a very liberal amount of Tony Chachere's, but this dish was still pretty bland.  I'd added extra garlic as well.    I used frozen chicken breasts and after 7 hours on hi they were perfectly tender, but overall I could take or leave this recipe.  It's great for convenience since I typically have all of the ingredients, but I certainly wouldn't serve it to company.

I love New Orleans style cooking! This is all so easy to make and full of flavor. I followed the recipe and added 1 8oz tomato paste, 1 can of chicken broth, Tony Charachere's creole spice, extra celery, fresh thick cut mushrooms, good amount of minced garlic, I like to use okra instead of green pepper, 1 can  Rotel as well as 1 can of stewed tomatoes .. Cooked for 9hrs, 8 would have been fine. Served with rice. Ah so good. 1 jalapeno gave it a kick!! Left overs even better!!  I guess you get the idea I really loved this will make again and again...

I made this yesterday since the weather has turned off cool and my 16 year old son ate 2 bowls of it.  Didn't even wait for the rice.  I did add the chicken stock, tomato paste and extra jalepenos.  I also threw in leftover corn, a can of kidney beans and some smoked sausage.  I think next time I will use bonless chicken thighs as the chicken breast was dry.  Wonderful recipe and will make this a staple in my menu planning

I followed the suggestions posted by kado on 3/29/06 and we absolutely loved it! Served with white rice and zesty corn (corn with the green and red peppers in it, so therefore I didn't put green peppers in the crock pot). My husband and I mixed ours up in a big bowl, the kids kept it separated, but all said it was delicious! This has a designated place in our family menu!

Made the recipe with minimal additions (1 can of vegetable stock just to make it soupy) and it was absolutely fabulous--a spicy, yummy, healthy chicken vegetable soup.  Served over whole wheat rotini.  It's so nice to see healthy recipes on here for a change!

Excellent flavor and so easy!  A healthy option for dinner...I added a green and red pepper, and served over brown rice.

I have made this several times - I use 4-6 boneless breast halves, double tomatoes and celery.  Added several jalapenos - even some habaneros.  I only cook mine on low for 5-6 hours, but I have a newer model crockpot:  I think it cooks faster.  Served over brown rice - excellent flavor.

Hubby loved it. We like things spicey so I added quite a bit of seasoning. I served it over rice in a bowl. We think we may add sausage next time.

Excellent!  I used half the chicken so that I'd have even more of the delicious sauce and thickened slightly with corn starch. Great with Jasmine or Basmati rice.

This was good.  The chicken was so moist it fell apart on the fork.  It was a little too spicy for my taste.  Other than that it was great.

I really thought this was great! It was easy to throw together and fairly inexpensive (I like boneless skinless thighs - cheap & good in a casserole dish). I used green chiles instead of jalapeno's (just didn't have any) and the kids hate mushrooms so i left those out...otherwise everything else was the same and was just awesome! House smelled great walking in after work!!!

I used 2t of creole seasoning, and it turned out perfect for us.  I served over egg noodles, but we both thought it'd be good (better?) over rice.  Reheated well.

Very good recipe... my husband especially loved this because of the spiciness. I doubled the recipe which filled my crock pot to the top. I used about 2 T. creole seasoning blend and 2 jalapenos, seeded... this made it medium hot which was fine for me and the kids. Hubby added more hot pepper flakes at the table :) Mary, thanks for an easy, yummy meal.

Just okay to me. I used only  two chicken breasts and didn‚Äôt add mushrooms (didn‚Äôt have any). I would make this again out of convenience because I usually always have these things around. I added a half small can of tomato paste, some carrot (for filler/nutrition) and used some creole seasoning I made from another online recipe. For the creole seasoning amount, based on previous reviews I used two tbsp but next time will use three.  Also added some water for liquid to soak into the rice I made to serve with it. Next time I would use only one chicken breast because it‚Äôs just me and my b/f and we aren‚Äôt big meat eaters; I would also consider adding frozen okra to this, just to try it. Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight for dinner exactly as directed except for the "creole seasoning to taste" part.  How am I supposed to know what "to taste" is if you don't provide me a guideline?  Is that a teaspoon or a cup?? I used 3T per another reviewers suggestion which seemed to be just right.  This recipe wasn't bad but I wouldn't call it great either and I probably won't ever repeat it. 5 hours on low made the 4 chicken breasts way overcooked and dry.  The sauce over the egg noodles was the best part but again, nothing to write home about.

This was ok, but I don't think I'll make it again....just didn't seem like a complete meal....
edit: added penne pasta boiled in beef stock and added more red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and it made it into a 4 star recipe- seems more like a meal now and taste is improved

I really enjoyed this recipe. Of course, we all like to make things our own. I use Emeril's creole spice (NOT my own, google it). I dry rub the chicken with Emiril's spice, brown it in my cast iron pan then add to the slow cooker. I then deglaze the pan with a tasty red wine and add to the cooker with the chicken. I substitute the green pepper with one red, and one orange. I also just slice the jalapeno leaving the ribs and the seed for spice. Last but not least I add a thinly sliced andouille sausage for that smokey Louisiana goodness. Hailing from western Canada I have NO clue whether or not this counts as a "creole" but.... Mmmm nom nom nom. Thanks for the base recipe! I wouldn't have been able to create this from scratch.

Excellent! After reading numerous reviews I did add an extra can of chopped tomatoes to go along with the stewed and 1 extra small jalapeno and a 1/2 can of chicken broth. I used 3 heaping tbsp. of Tony C's creole seasoning "to taste". No salt or additional pepper was necessary. I also used a package of chicken breast tenders for the meat and MAN OH MAN THIS WAS GOOD! The texture was perfect and spooned it over some brown rice. As in another review, I put some in a soup bowl the next day, added a few splashes of water to thin it up a tad and it was some of the best soup I ever had! This ones a keeper--give it a try! However, though I like a bit of heat and 2 jalapenos was NOT overwhelmingly hot, I will probably only use one jalapeno the next time I make this delicious concoction. I cooked on high in slow cooker for 2 hours then low for 6 hrs.

I think this is a great recipe to start with and tweak to your own taste. I added 4 T. creole seasoning, no mushrooms, no jalapeno, used Hunt's spicy diced tomatoes (2 cans), + tomato paste(1 can), + 1 cup chicken broth, +frozen corn, +diced 3 small zucchinis, +more minced garlic, +1 bay leaf,+1 t. of red pepper flakes,1 diced bell pepper, and no celery. Served over rice with a warm yeast roll on the side, and the family LOVED it!!! I get ideas from recipes, we all have different taste buds. So I give this (idea)recipe 5 stars.

I just had to tweak this a bit, but the result was fantastic and I will definitely be making it again, I substituted a 10oz can of chunky rotel for the tomatoes, and added a tbs of worcestershire, 1/2 cup marinated artichoke hearts, and 1/2 bottle of ale (I used an IPA, but feel free to sub or use chicken stock for liquid) 6 hours on high and it was tender and easy to fork. the next morning I poured a bit of the leftovers on three scrambled eggs with a bit of queso fresco and was gooood.

I added some mild Cajun sausage... Grilled first, then sliced in medallions. I also took the onions, a thinly sliced poblano pepper (cored and de-seeded), minced garlic, sliced portabella mushroom caps and thinly sliced onions and browned them in a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil before adding them to the crock pot. I did omit the jalape√±o pepper - family is not a fan... 
I used "Louisiana" gumbo seasoning for the roux. 
Yeah, I changed it a bit.... But the stew turned out so well, my Sweet Hubby was speechless!!! Being a Louisiana implant by marriage has taken my cooking skills up a notch!! Had too! In Louosiana, people don't eat to live, WE LIVE TO EAT!! Served over white medium grain rice. It was AMAZING

This is absolutely my favorite recipe so far. I left out the jalapeno, because my family doesn't like things too spicy, and used 3 tablespoons of the Creole seasoning. It was perfect.

This was a great recipe! I used 6 chicken breasts and seasoned them up, added olive oil to marinate it then put it in the fridge while I chopped up my veggies(cubed them chicks after). I used Chardonnay wine, crushed and diced tomatoes, a can of corn and a can of black beans. Also used 2 habanero peppers and omitted the mushrooms. I had to make my own creole seasoning. Was full of flavor and looked and smelled amazing! Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe very much (my neighbors too!). I did make some changes, and will make a a couple more when I make it again (which I will). I added two jalapenos, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I was weary of adding the mushrooms and celery but did so the first time anyways. I don't believe one stalk would add any flavor but I did add three. I also added OKRA! A must!I aslo used Diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I seasoned the chicken with the south's creole staple seasoning, Tony's. I seasoned liberally. I did everything it asked above except for the fresh mushrooms, 2 jalapenos, okra, 3 stalks of celery, and added 2 whole cloves of garlic(along with the minced) and added chicken broth to make it a bit like a soup. It came out AMAZING, I added lots of Tony's and Tabasco sauce to taste throughout the way.

This is really a "Season to Taste Recipe"

Next time I will Omit the mushrooms, add three more jalapenos, one more bell pepper, 6 stalks of celery, the OKRA, an extra onion, two more pieces of chicken, and the diced(instead of stewed) tomatoes along with the broth that I added last time.

It comes out almost like gumbo( not really, but I made mine like a soup to serve with rice) so maybe even adding some sausage to it will be a hit!

Excellent and easy to make. Only thing I changed was added a couple of bay leaves and substituted fresh mushrooms which need to be added about half way through the cooking. Have made it several times and have found cooking on low produces the best texture and tender chicken. Serve over white rice and it is wonderful, and low calorie and fat.

This was a great recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I added a can of tomato sauce, more garlic and more celery.  Next time I will add more mushrooms as well.  It is a very tasty dish, but not very spicy.  Next time I will add some cayenne.

Very good recipe tho my chicken was dry so I refrigerated it overnight then put it in a pot on the stove the next night and shredded the chicken and it seemed to soften up and get more moist.  We used small flour tortillas instead of buns and made bbq chicken tacos!!  Would make again

This is delicious! I made so many changes, and would not have liked the original recipe without them, so 5 stars is for finished product, not original recipe :) But it is so adaptable, it is a great recipe to start with.
My changes: I used crushed tomatoes, 2 stalks celery, fresh mushrooms, 5 cloves garlic (our preference), 3 chicken breasts, and some sausage. It was not too spicy, perfect for our 2yr old. I think next time I will use 2 bell peppers, and 2 jalepenos and it still wouldn't be too hot.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out a little dry.  And it was pretty bland for chicken creole.  Next time I will use this as a starter recipe but make several changes. I should have looked at the other reviewers suggestions before I made it.

12 big thumbs WAY up!  Used it today for Mardi Gras and everybody LOVED it.  Didn't have any jalapenos so used a little extra creole seasoning.  Delicious.  Have already been asked if we can have it again!

So Yummy!!! I made this dish with left over chicken breast I had, same exact way just did in the crockpot for about 4 1/2 hours. The chicken was really tender and the seasoning was amazing! Served with some Brown Rice. Will definitely make again with this calorie content!!!

This is such a flavorful meal!  I included all jalapeno seeds because I enjoy food with good heat.  I also used fresh mushrooms rather than canned and added a quarter cup of water to the dish to keep in moisture.

Not being the greatest cook (yet) I like simple recipes.  This one fits the bill and was delicious.  I would rate it higher as it was very good, but I can't say it was great.  I'll be making it again though thats for sure.

This was really good! I made my own creole seasoning and I didn't have all the ingredients, so I improvised. I used a 7 ounce can of green chile peppers because I didn't have a can of mushrooms or a fresh jalapeno pepper. I left out the celery and bell pepper. It was a little spicy, but still good. I served it over couscous, it was great, thank you!

So yummy! This is an excellent meal for a chilly fall or winter night.  Spicy, but not too much like some other Creole or Cajun dishes.  The only thing missed in the directions is to shred the chicken once it's tender and return to crock pot.

Fixed this using 3T creole seasoning and omitting the jalapeno. It had just the right amount of heat for us. I also did not get the chicken out of the freezer soon enough, so fixed it in my digital pressure cooker. I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce for the needed liquid. Served it over rice. A good go-to recipe at the last minute with my pressure cooker. I am looking forward to fixing it in my slow cooker.

Very tasy, a little too salty.  Omit salt the next time.  There is enough in the Creole Seasoning.  This is a keeper!

The only thing I swapped was fresh mushrooms, local hot peppers and added rice at the end.  Mine was runny.  OMG, this recipe is amazing!  The kind you want to keep eating wwwaaaaayyy after you're full. I had left overs, only the 2 of us now, so I added 1/2 cup of wine (the bad kind some people bring) and 1/2 cup of water and will let "warm" all day while at the football game and see how it turns out!  Once my kids moved into their own homes, the first thing I purchased for them was a slow cooker.  It's a must for any working household.

Very tasty! quick preparation... Next time I will add more tomato to increase the portions and help balance the protein/carb ratio. I started cooking after dinner and it was ready for my the next day. It made a great lunch! Everyone was envious!

I followed the recipe to the tee so I gave it chance before rating it.  It was okay. Something tasted wierd.  I'm thinking it might have been the mushrooms, since creole usually doesn't have mushrooms. I usually tweak, but this time I didn't.  Next time I will use most of the ingrediants as a base then go from there.

Very tasty!  And so easy.  I used a heavy amount of creole seasoning and also dumped about a half bag of okra in the crock.  I used a bag of frozen chicken breasts and cooked for about 8 hours on low.  Served over rice with cornbread.  Big hit at the table and really healthy!

I made this for a "Fat Tuesday" evening meal.  I added the tomato sauce as one reviewer recommended, but no mushrooms.  About 30 minutes before I turned the slow cooker off, I added one tablespoon of brown sugar and one tablespoon of soy sauce. It really amplified the taste. Divine! Such a pleasant meal to come in to after a long work day. Will make again and again.

My family really enjoyed this.  I love a good slow cooker chicken recipe.  I did use a can of green chilies because I had no jalapenos...probably not a spicy as original recipe but still delicious.  I served it over brown rice.

This was really good and one of the easiest meals to assemble. I couldn't believe that there was so much flavor in this meal with so little preparation.  We ate it over egg noodles.  I might add an chorizo or a different kind of sausage next time just to enhance the flavors.  We will make this again.

This was enjoyed by my whole family.  I added two cans of stewed tomatoes and one can of tomato paste and didn't add the jalapeno peppers.  I would definitely made this again and would recommend it to my friends.

I made this exactly as directed in recipe except I browned the chicken a bit first. It was excellent! The only thing I would do is add some spice, maybe some red pepper flakes. Great recipe!

Pretty good recipe.  I used a Creole Seasoning recipe from this site and it came out nice and spicy!  Served it over rice, might be too spicy for soup but I'll make better adjustments on that next time!

It was good but seemed like it was missing something. After adding in some hot sauce and brown sugar it was great! I used chicken legs and thighs and the meat was falling off the bone.

Great recipe, I added some ingredients from other reviews and a few of my own because I wanted it just a little more spicy. This is great stuff.

I loved this! I only had 3 chicken breasts, and I had to omit the celery as I was out of it. I also didn't use any salt, the creole seasoning had plenty, and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I cooked it on low for about 7 hours, and the chicken was so tender that if fell apart when I poked it with a spoon. I served it with brown rice, and can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. I kept sneaking back to the fridge after dinner to eat bits of it.

I tried the suggestion of using the Rotel tomatoes and chilies.  It gave the dish a Mexican flavor.  It didn't taste like Creole at all so beware.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I put in more chicken than the original recipe, but it worked out fine. I also added more spice, since that is my nature here in South Louisiana. It was a worthy dish, that I will do again!! Thanks!

This was delicious.  I added 2 cups chicken broth near the end to give it more broth.  The blend of vegetables make this a very tasty dish - definitely a keeper!

This was a very good meal. I did what others suggested and added half a can of tomato paste. I also added some chicken broth to the paste to dissolve it some. I served this over rice, it was excellent. Such an easy meal.

This was tasty.  I've made it twice.  Next time I would like to add Rotella to it as suggested by another reviewer.  It's so nice to just throw it all in the crockpot and come home to a hot, tasty meal.

Saved this recipe for several months waiting for the right time to introduce it to friends. I was certain it would be a hit (without honing), and it didn't disappoint at our monthly get together feast. thanks very much.

We liked the recipe a lot.  I doubled the amounts, added 2T Creole Seasoning and 2T Cajun Seasoning and it was a little spicy.  I might cut back somewhat next time.

I don't know what happened!  I followed the recipe to a "T" but the chicken turned out surprisingly dry.  I don't know,... maybe my slowcooker is simply far more powerful than others.  Maybe I should have taken everything out before the 10 hour limit as others suggested .  The sauce was very tasty and I'm happy that I took the liberty of adding extra jalapenos and tomato paste.

The only change I made was that I threw in about a half a pound of leftover breakfast sausage patties.  I tossed them into the food processor with the onion, peppers and celery.  I cooked it on low for 6.5 hours in a 6 quart slow cooker.  I paired this with amusement park corn bread. It was a wonderful meal!

Thank you, Mary. for a great recipe.  This one is a keeper. I followed the directions to a "T".  I also tried some of the other readers' recommendations.  I added 3 ounces of tomato paste and kilbasa sausage.  The only stewed tomatoes I found were DelMonte brand with onions, celery & green peppers.  I served it over rice.

We loved this recipe. I used 2 boneless halves and about 1 lb of chicken tenders (boneless) Because it's what I had in the house...Any boneless skinless would work, I think. Used a TON of Creole Seasoning, and it didnt over-do it. The dish wasnt actually spicy, but very tasty. Not Bland...Used Crock Pot for about 4 hours on high and it was enough. Highly Recommended!!! Perm. fav.!

Very good and very easy recipe.  I did use 6 chicken breasts so I added another can of tomatoes.  You do have to be careful with the creole seasoning as it can be very spicy.  Just before serving I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry and served it over rice.  It was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!

Let me first start out by saying it could just be my fault.  I added more spices...quite a few more and added two cans of tomato paste YUCK!  Absolutely WILL NOT make this again.  Again, it could be over kill on the tomato paste!!!

I'm rating it a four bc I think that's what the recipe could top out at if you season it correctly.  Unfortunately, in my attempt to make mine not as bland as the reviews warned, I took almost everyone's advice when it came to additions.  Combined.  My mouth was on FIRE.  But my husband loved it.

Yum. I added some extra celery, garlic & mushrooms and served over egg noodles.  I used quite a bit of cajun seasoning, so it wasn't bland at all.  The jalepeno really gave it a nice kick.  So, easy too - and mine didn't stew nearly as long as called for.  It smelled so good, once the chicken was done, it was getting eaten.

This was a great recipe.  I definitely took the advice of past reviews and used a LOT of spices.  I think this helped a lot.  The house just smelled divine while this was cooking.  It was a big hit with my husband.  We ate it with red beans and rice.

Great recipe.  I kicked it up a notch by adding an extra jalapeno.  I also served it over rice.  The next day I took the leftovers, added some chicken broth and made a very tasty soup.

As suggested by others, I added two jalapeno with the seeds.  I also added 6-8 dashes of hot sauce.  Still wasn't that spicy.  Everyone agreed the tomatoe sauce needed to be thicker or more of it. This just really is not worth the effort with all the adjustments. Won't make again

I used boneless skinless thighs 2 large packs.  3 jalapeno peppers, 1 sweet bell pepper, 1 large onion, 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste. Seasoned liberally with creole seasoning.  Cooked it in my electric presser cooker for 45 minutes. It is amazing !  Will definitely make it again.

I went by the recipe. Unfortunately I should have read the reviews first. I definitely would add more liquid, flavors, etc.

Not bad but kind of bland.  Next time, I'll take the advice of other reviewers and add some wine, salt, maybe Worcestershire.  I will use thighs next time, too, instead of breasts. Breasts are just so dry, even when they are slow cooked.  I'm not a fan.

Hold tight, I changed this A LOT due to the comments. I use Tony Charachere's creole seasoning, it's the best. A lot of garlic, extra chicken (usually a pound, maybe a bit more extra), fresh mushrooms, 1/2 can of tomato paste, 1 extra cup of broth, 1 can of Rotel, and I skip the jalape√±os. (Boyfriend's request, I like them). Shred the chicken about an hour before cooking is complete, put back in and serve over rice. One of my favorite meals and I've been making it for years. For the Instant Pot: saut√© the onions, garlic, and bell pepper until onions are translucent. Add the chicken and other ingredients + an extra cup or two of broth. Use ‚Äòsoup‚Äô button for 30 mins. Go a little easy on the spice/salt if pressure cooking because it was very salty/spicy. Shred the chicken and it‚Äôs ready to serve immediately.

This dish was flavorful & easy to do.  After reading reviews, I used 6 boneless thighs & a lb. of chicken tenders (seasoned with red pepper, Worcest..Sauce & spicy mustard) with a full can of chicken broth, 12 oz.crushed tomato, & 1 can rotel.  Of course, onion, green onion & bell pepper with 2 tsp crushed garlic & dried celery. Additions were baby carrots & a bag of frozen okra, added an hour or so before fully cooked. There was plenty of thick gravy, with the okra sending the taste to yum mode!  We served over mixed steamed veggies. The leftovers eaten the next night were even better served over mashed potatoes. I can't wait to make this again, adding shrimp or pork with the chicken.  Cooked 4 hrs on high plus 3 on low. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I love this recipe. I've made it time and time again, and now have my own version. I put more vegetables in it (so several stalks of celery, a package of frozen okra, and maybe more bell pepper). I also put a can of tomato paste in with the stewed tomatoes to give a richer flavor. I use chicken thighs almost exclusively because I like the flavor more. So delicious!

This is definitely more of a crockpot creole flavored slow cooker chicken than a true creole dish. That said, it was still very tasty, and we have served it over white rice as well as mashed potatoes. 

The only other thing  we add to it is a second kind of meat. The first time it was sausage Kielbasa, the second time it was turkey bacon (I forgot I was out of sausage). Came out great each time! We use Zatarains creole seasoning, and fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden. Really worth it!

Good recipe but you must not skimp on the spices, especially  allspice, bay leaves, cumin, cayenne pepper, turmeric and thyme.  I also added chicken broth, cut my chicken pieces small, add a quarter cup of olive oil, and extra diced tomato in juice.  I only cooked it four hours and I add one tablespoon of flour in a water wash the last half hour and a can of kidney beans.  I served it over egg noodles.  Easy and pretty good.   It might taste better with a few  shrimp and a tiny bit of sausage in it but that's extra fat.

I followed the recipe although i added a few things. I used chicken breast cut into cubes, some chicken broth, added shrimp the last hour of cooking used Cajun spices and Old Bay seasoning and served over yellow rice. Cook it on high for 4 hours and turn it to low for 1 hour. Very very tasty.

Made as is except halved quantity.  It was plenty for my family of 3.  We've had several helping served with jasmine rice.  Nothing but praise for this one all around.

I just made this for dinner tonight. I only made a few changes. I didn't put any onion in it and I put 2 jalape√±os in it. plus I added some chicken broth. I cooked it on low for 10 hours and the chicken was so tender and juicy and had a nice kick to it I made it with cornbread. I will definitely make it again.

This came out to be quite good. I have two suggestions however. One is that this recipe needs a roux for thickening. Second, the cooking time was WAY too long for my cooker. It was done in half the time on LOW. The veggies were overcooked. I might even consider cooking the chicken with seasoning and stewed tomatoes and add the veggies late in the process. I didn't used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Of course, this defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. I didn't see anything in the recipe about shredding the chicken, but the picture clearly shows that it is.

This was a great meal. We had it over white rice. The only thing I didn't like was that the directions said creole seasoning to taste.  My husband and I don't eat creole food on a regular basis so I'm not sure what my "taste" is. A starting point would have been helpful! Of course it didn't dawn on me until I sat down to write this that I should have looked at the other reviews:)

This was great...really satisfying.  All I added was some smoked sausage and some Gumbo File powder.  Used Mexican style stewed tomatoes because that is all I had, so I left off the jalapenos.   Served over rice.  Will make again for sure.

This recipe was very good,  i used two cans of the stewed tomatoes, 6 cloves of garlic, 5 celery stalks,  1/2 cup beef stock,  i added no bell pepper, these are the ways i differentiated from the recipe.  It was very good over brown rice, great leftover also!

It was so so watery that there was no point in trying to serve it over rice. I just ended up draining off the juice, shredding the chicken and we made tacos out of it.

this was fantastic!! I used split chicken breasts and 2 hours before serving I shredded and removed the bones. added chicken back and cooked on high for 2 hours. served over rice and then added the leftover rice and some shrimp to the leftovers for jambalaya later in the week. I didnt add mushrooms or jalapeno. I have a 6 yr old, but I did add cayenne & it was perfect for a family meal.

Just added the Tomato paste and some broth.  The rest is flexible.

It was easy...as are most slow-cooker dishes.  I thought the basics were great, but as many other reviewers have said, I put in quite a bit more spice.  With the added kick, it was a great addition to my rotation.  Thank you!

Made it exactly as described and it is excellent.  I put a good bit of Tony Charachere's Creole Seasoning (Covered the chicken Breasts after putting them in the crock) and added a few shakes of ground red Cayenne Pepper along with the salt and black pepper, but I did not stray from the recipe beyond that.  Excellent dish.

The recipe came together nice and easy, and it made my house smell great, but the end result was so bland! Creole food is supposed to have big flavors, and this just didn't. We had to add more salt and a generous amount of hot sauce at the table, just to make it taste like SOMETHING. I've got enough leftovers that I'm going to try to salvage in a soup, but I'm probably not making this again.

very good and flavourful!  I used the creole seasoning also found on this site, and then added 3tbsp of it to this recipe (as per others suggestions).  Family loved it and will be making again.

My husband LOVES this recipe. I've converted it from crockpot to oven and used a homemade seasoning instead of store bought. The creole seasoning I used was by JOSLYN here on AllRecipes: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creole-seasoning-blend/detail.aspx 
I layered in my pot as follows: chicken - 1 tbsp seasoning sprinkled over top - vegetables - 1 tbsp seasoning, repeat until ingredients used up or pot is full.  For crockpot conversion, I used my cast iron dutch oven covered at 325F for 2 hours.  Worked beautifully.

I love cajun food. This is a great recipe. However, next time I will use hot sausage instead of chicken to maximize the cajun flavor! I also substituted canned japapenos as I did not have fresh and two cans of tomatoes to prevent dish from being too dry.

This was a terrific, quick, weeknight recipe.  I put this together in about 15 minutes and let it go on low about 10 hours before serving over rice.  I used Zatarran's creole seasoning sprinkled over the chicken, and added 4 sliced links of andouille sausage over that.  Topped with the veggies and tomatoes, and added a cup of caldo de tomate/pollo broth, and more Zatarran's over that.  I took the chicken out about 6 hours into the cooking time and shredded.  Next time I make this I think I'll add some tomato paste, I would have liked a little more thickness/tomatoey taste to the broth.  Overall, a very tasty dish and a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

I thought this recipe was just okay. Nothing spectacular. Kinda plain. Not sure what was so "creole" about it. i did give it 3 stars after i added a lot more creole and cajun seasoning, black beans, and rice. Don't think I'll bother again though.

Blah. Made this for dinner tonight. Other than being INSANELY easy to prepare and inexpensive to boot, I can't think of anything positive to say about this. On the flipside, my fiance commented that this was the best meal I've prepared in a while (huh???). Despite seasoning my chicken liberally with Emeril's essence (and only using 3 breasts total), subbing a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles for stewed tomatoes and adding a 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth, I followed Mary's directions to the letter. I served up bowlfuls mixed with Minute rice (which I added to my slow cooker during the last 30 minutes of cooking - try it, it really works!). My verdict? I won't be adding this to my regular menu rotation, but thank you, Mary for sharing your recipe with me! :-)

I had to make do w/what was in my cupboard: no mushrooms, frozen bell peppers, and b/c my 3yo wouldn't eat it---no jalapenos. The verdict: YUM. My almost 1 year old ate it up--celery and peppers and all! I did throw in a few frozen cubes of chicken broth b/c toward the end there wasn't much juice. Overall, it was delish!

We just finished this meal.  I had high hopes, and I hope that I can make some changes to make it turn out better.  It was so SALTY!  I wasn't sure how much creole seasoning to put in because it wasn't listed.  So I looked through other posts and someone said to put in 3 Tbsp, so I did.  Now, I do think I'll give this another go but with much less creole seasoning - maybe even making my own so I know what's in it.  It smelled wonderful!!!

This came out great. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't indicate how much seasoning to use, so I do feel that I got lucky and must have guessed right.  I took others' advice and added a few tablespoons of tomato paste. I was very liberal with the creole seasoning (Zatarain's) after reading that some reviewers thought it was bland.  I've been disappointed by a number of highly-rated recipes on this site, which I thought had no flavor at all. Not the case here.

It was ok.  I will likely still eat the leftovers I froze but it was missing something.  I couldn't pinpoint it.  I even added wine and vinegar hoping to get more flavor vs just spice.  If someone figures it out, let us know!  It has potential.  My boyfriend had suggested to add shrimp.  I think that would be good.

Although this could certainly be 4-stars with some modification, as written it is only three.  To cook in a slow-cooker is to dump everything in in the morning, and come home to a cooked meal at the end of the end of the day.  So you either get the seasoning right at the beginning, or not.  This recipe gave no guidance whatsoever as to how much to use, leaving me to guess (and I guessed wrong -- it came out much too bland).  I will try it again, but will have to take notes so I know and can replicate what I used.

The base for this recipe was good; however, needs more seasoning - which we added and then added another can of tomato wedges - slow cooked for 8 hours and then added cooked, peeled shrimp and served over white rice and it was GREAT!

Wow!  The entire family loved the recipe as is.  It's spicy and leaves a warming  glow.  We served it over buttered egg noodles.  There wasn't a bite left!  We'll definitely be making this one again.

We weren't totally excited about this recipe. I like dishes with some spice and "kick", but I think it was a bit of an overload. I may try it again with caution.

My changes were using fresh mushrooms and jalapenos from a jar... I think I added too many! The husband liked it, but I would've preferred a bit milder flavor. Not bad; will make again. Served over rice.

This was really great! I served it to my boyfriend and his best friend and they gobbled it up, and then I served it at a potluck at work and it was gone within minutes. The only change I made was adding a yellow bell pepper and a can of spinach. Delish and easy :)

This really turned out aweful. I had high hopes after reading other reviews, but i found it just spicey and bland.  My family wouldn't eat it, so i ended up adding a jar of salsa, corn, and black beans to make it more of a taco soup dish that i served with sprinked cheese and sour cream (tortillas on the side)  That came out pretty good, and has since been requested again.

This was everything promised, an easy crockpot recipe with satisfying Creole flavor. Although my husband and I liked the heat, I will probably leave out the jalepeno out next time for the kids. I served mine over brown rice. I plan on heating the leftovers mixed with sour cream to serve over linguini.

Very good; I used two jalapenos, and it was not too spicy.

I may have just used the wrong Creole seasoning, or maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for it, but while it wasn't bad to taste, it didn't really come across as very delicious.  Some cayenne or similar to give it some more heat may have helped, too.

This recipe is wonderful!  I have been using this site for well over a year and many recipes are good...this one is fantastic.  I made a few changes out of preference.  I took leftovers to work and collegues asked for the recipe and love it too!

Wonderful recipe. The only trouble you will have is keeping the lid on the crock pot so it can finish cooking! I only made two changes. I added some more spices and added some chicken broth. It looked as though it would get dry on me but I don't think it would have. The broth didn't seem to hurt it any. My husband put some pinto beans into his, he said it was great. My five year old was a little iffy about it but what do you expect? :0)

The chicken was very tender, but I found the recipe very bland.  Guess I should have read other reviews to determine how much spice to use because it would have required a great deal more than I used.

Hubby thought it was to die for.  I, on the other hand, thought it was just ok.  I wasn't thrilled with the flavor of it or the smell.  The chicken was very meaty and almost tasted like a pot roast.

The chicken was surprisingly dry!
