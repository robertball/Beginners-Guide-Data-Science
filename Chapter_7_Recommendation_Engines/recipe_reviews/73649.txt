Wow - three of of my favorite things all rolled into one! This wrap was very good and for me a great way to use up leftover herb grilled chicken so I didn't bother with the whole marinating/grilling process. I love sun-dried tomatoes and mine are in a "ready to eat" pouch so no boiling here either! I opted for a creamy ranch style dressing to compliment this and it tasted great! This was quick, easy, and perfect for lunch!

Very good recipe! Followed the recipe to a T and got me some yummy lunch wraps. The only problem is that it lacks something creamy to balance the extreme saltiness of feta and sun-dried tomatoes. Next time, I might add sour cream or mayo to the dressing.

I have been meaning to try these for months & finally did last night.  They were good.  Next time I would marinate them in the dressing called for, but I think I would mix the cooked chicken, spinach, etc with a ranch or maybe just mayonnaise something cream based.  Or maybe I was supposed to use a cream based sundried tomato dressing.  I wasn't sure, so picked up one that was oil-based and very red!  But let me say, I tasted the chicken straight out of the oven, and that dressing is a great marinade just to serve the chicken plain.  I marinated mine 10 hours and the chicken was incredible tender & juicy.

Fantastic recipe!! I wonder if the user who had a problem with the dressing used a vinaigrette? Make sure you pick up the sun-dried tomato dressing which is NOT a vinaigrette because that's what I did and this recipe was awesome. Oh and easy too! Can't beat that.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to try something different. It's very good, but between the sun dried tomatoes, sun dried tomato dressing, and the feta cheese, the flavor was a bit overpowering. If I make this again, I would use a different dressing or less of it with some oil.

I made these wraps for a tailgate party to serve about 50 people. I substituted goat cheese for the feta since I felt it might mix better, and it was a HUGE hit. People kept asking me for my card (they thought I catered for a living!)...what a reliably great recipe.

I really enjoyed the taste of this wrap.  The flavor was wonderful.     I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and found it wasn't quite enough to feed 3 adults.   For dinner,  we had one wrap each and two of us felt we could have easily shared another one.   I would increase my ingredients next time to 6 servings to feed 4 people.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

These were incredible, restaurant quality.  We only had oil-packed sundried tomatoes, so we rinsed them under hot water to remove the excess oil.  We used a Good Seasons sundried tomato vinaigrette and used Mission Tortillas Plus whole wheat tortillas.  Delicious.  We are using the leftovers for salads tomorrow.

Just finished eating this! It was so yummy. I made a few changes first i beat my chicken flat then sprinkled alittle mrs dash sun-dried tomato seasoning on both sides , beacause i didn't marinade it, then stuck on grill. once done I cut in super thin. I warmed my tortillas in the micro then added about 1/2 c. spinach, chicken, sprinkled about 1T. feta, 2 sun-dried tomatoes sliced diced, and 1 t. light ceasar dressing ( didn't have the other dressing). My family loved it and we will deffinantly make it again.

I threw this together with leftover (non-marinated) chicken from last night, in a defrosted tortilla (not the best texture). It was delicious and I can't wait to try it with the marinated chicken. I cook for one, so I always have left over chicken breast - this is a great way to use it up and combines some of my favorite ingredients! Next time I may try it warmed. Has earned a spot in my regular rotation. Thanks!

New Favorite.  I used diced cucumber instead of sun dried tomatoes, that's all I had.  I did spread mayo on the torillas.  Wonderful.

What a flavourful wrap. My husband has requested this again(very soon) and rates it one of his top 10 meals. Instead of the 1/4 of dressing at the end I took a 1/4-1/3 cup of mayo and added approx. 3 Tbsp of the sundried tomatoe vinagrette with some pepper. I spread this on the wrap before adding the chicken. I used romaine instead of spinach. It was fantastic.

These were so good! My husband loved them. I used the sun dried tomato vinaigrette dressing, so I followed others' suggestion and added some low fat mayonnaise to the tortilla before spreading on the spinach/chicken mixture. I was a little hesitant to do this at first but it really balanced the flavor out and I was glad I did. Yum! I will definitely make twice as much next time to have some left over for lunch.

My mom loved this, my husband not so much.  I liked it except I think I'd rather use fresh tomatos.  I guess its all a matter of taste.  Very delicious, will make again.

I rated this 4 stars because I'm being picky. It was fabulous on fresh cooked tortillas...but I couldn't find the non-vinegrette dressing. A bit too tangy for me, though I loved the sun-dried tomato zesty bite. It was a refreshing new item for dinner!

These are very tasty! I came across these while looking for recipes I can pack in a cold lunch.  Whether the chicken is warm or cold, still tastes great!  I couldn't find sundried tomato dressing, but these tasted fine without.  You could dip in ranch, or anything really.  I used white flour tortillas and chicken cooked on my George Foreman.  I will make these again and again!

Between dinner and late night snack all 3 lbs of chicken I made for my famliy was gone.  Strong but not overwhelming and very tasty.  A "heavy" meal for such low calories.

REALLY liked this... easy... simple. Good.
Also didn't do all teh marinating/grilling. Just took cooked chicken that was leftover & sauted it with some spices & the tomatoes. GREAT with Ranch & all the fixins!

This recipe would be a 5 star with the modifications I made to it. I couldn't find sun dried tomato dressing so I used a balsamic instead and added tomato and basil seasoning to the bag. I used my favorite, tomato and basil feta cheese and added hummus inside of the tortilla instead of the 1/4 cup of dressing. The chicken was moist enough that it didn't need extra dressing. Will definitely make this again! :) Thanks!

I used this recipe as a jumping-off point to make a really good lunchtime wrap:  I used lunch meat chicken, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese and wrapped it all up in a wheat tortilla.  Really easy, and a really good flavor combination! I can't rate the actual recipe since I varied it quite a bit, but thanks for the inspiration!

This is so yummy and so easy.  I've made it about 3 different times now, and I've decided that omitting the sun dried tomatoes works best for me. Very quick and easy to make, great to eat on a lazy weekend afternoon.

Just ehhh in my opinion.  It needs something else.  I almost think the Sun-Dried Tomato in oil would be better.  My husband doesn't care for the texture of the tomato anyway.

Great recipe! I didn't have wraps or the sundried tomotoes, so I cooked the chicken as directed. I cooked white rice in chicken stock, after rice was cooked I added some feta cheese and spinach, then topped with the chicken and extra sundried tomato dressing. Made a great lunch for two!

I tried this for a light healthy dinner. I haven't tried sun dried tomatoes yet and they were a bit pricey so I used fresh. I also added sliced ripe olives.  I found whole wheat tortillas are going to take some getting used to other than that I loved it but hubby doesn't like the feta so next time I'll try a more Americanized cheese perhaps mozzarella or asiago. Take away the tortillas and you'll have an awesome salad. Very good recipe.

I made these wraps for a picnic with my boyfriend and they were excellent! Instead of using actual chicken breast, I used canned chicken chucks and served it cold.  I also took others advice and added mayo to the wrap. I will defiantly be making this again!

I was a little sceptical - looking for something to do with a bunch of feta cheese that I have on hand.  Made these today for me and hubby and they were absolutely delicious.  The flavors compliment each other so well.  Definitely a keeper - can't wait to make again.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

These are really good! I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours in Newman's Own Lite Sun Dried Tomato. Then I broiled it. It came out very juicy. I also used a table spoon of ranch like others suggested :) Will make again!

So good! I actually cooked the chicken in a pan over the stove without getting rid of the dressing that was marinading it. It was very good! And definitely a good dish to make, even if you don't have a grill.

These were yummy. We made it with a vinaigrette dressing, which made it overall pretty tart (with the feta and sun-dried tomatoes) but we liked it! I made extra chicken and didn't mix it all in so that this could easily be made 1 wrap at a time to take for lunch or have as a quick dinner.

Wow...was this good! I read some reviews and they said it needed some creaminess, so I spread some mayo on the tortilla. Yummy. Quick and easy, too. I shredded a rotisserie chicken that I had bought from the store and this made a fast lunch.

Good recipe with a lot of flavor. Beautiful colors. Used regular tortillas and oil packed chopped sundried tomatoes (all I had, tried to absorb the oil as much as I could).

Delicious, simple, easy to make it yours. I did my chicken in a cast iron, seasoned with S&P and some Italian seasonings (instead of marinating), used jarred sundried tomatoes and lite Caesar dressing (couldn’t find what the recipe called for). These made great lunch wraps for travel, I work as a flight attendant and bring all my food. This is a new favorite!

We made these into paninis. Did not spinach handy, but these tasted great as long as we put enough sun dried tomato dressing/pesto on there.

So easy and tasty for a quick meal!  I cheated a bit by using a high quality deli roasted chicken, but I'd do it again as it was so good! I couldn't  find sun-dried tomato dressing, so I subbed roasted red pepper dressing spread on my tortilla. Then I layered the spinach, chicken, smoked sun-dried tomatoes (the pouch variety) and then the feta. Voila! Will definitely be made again and again.

I really liked this recipe, it surprised me. I think I might go for regular tomatoes on the next time I make it, the sun dried ones are fine, but I found they didn't have a lot of flavor.

I made this with some left over "roast sticky chicken" from this site, and used fresh tomatoes from the "marinated cherry tomato salad" I had made. I did not have the sun dried tomato dressing so I just poured a little of the dressing from the tomato salad on it. It was very tasty! I know I made what seems like a lot of changes, but I just used what I had :)

I used sliced turkey breast instead of chicken because that is what I had on hand. I wasn't able to find a sun dried toamto dressing so i tried it with ranch. I didn't like that, so i tried a light italian the next time. THAT tasted much better.  This will go into my work lunch rotation. I assmbled the wraps, except for the spinach and dressing and froze then for taking to work. This tastes good as a cold wraps, but I liked it better warmed.

These are good, however we felt the wheat wraps conflicted w/ the flavor of the filling. (Maybe it was the brand I bought?) Also, for the "dressing" I used 1/4 cup lite Mayo mixed w/ a tablespoon of the bottled sun-dried tomato dressing for something creamier, per another reviewers suggestion.  I will try these again with regular white flour wraps and as a cold pasta salad.  Thanks! P.S. I just made this again, as a warm pasta salad, and it gets five stars!  Whole family loved it.

You must like sun dried tomatoes to enjoy this recipe.  I felt the sun-dried tomato dressing was a bit overkill on this one.  Next time I will stick to a basic oil/vinagrette.  The star of this recipe  should be the fresh sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese.  Also, I recommend expirimenting with flavored wraps.
