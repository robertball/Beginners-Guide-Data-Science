I've never made fudge before as I don't like the chocolate kind, but my dad requested maple fudge so I thought I'd give it a try.  After a bit of research, this recipe's ingredients looked the most promising.  The mixture of sugar and real maple syrup and the straightforward directions seemed promising.  The only change I made was to reduce the brown sugar just a bit and add a tablespoon of light corn syrup which is supposed to help the fudge come together.  I also toasted my walnuts.  The result is scrumptious!!  I followed cooking instructions exactly.  It seemed like the mixture was taking forever to get to 240 so I partially covered the pan at the end and that got it there.  It takes a LONG time to cool so the time estimated given are way off.  Plan several hours for this.  I used a hand mixer to beat it and it took around 10 minutes to "lose it's gloss" and I added the walnuts at that point.  The result was worth the time - really, really good.

Tastes great but did not cut well.  Crumbled when cut.  Mix well or you may be left with some "toffee" like parts.
