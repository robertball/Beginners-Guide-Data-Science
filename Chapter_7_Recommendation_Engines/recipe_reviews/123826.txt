I have made this recipe for years. I vary the recipe all the time too. I make the BBQ ones, I also add green chilies. I make BBQ shredded chicken, even breakfast biscuits with eggs, sausage and cheese. This recipe opens the door to very creative modifications.

This was easy but time-consuming to prepare. It tasted good but it didn't blow me away. I used half hickory flavoured barbecue sauce and half chicken & rib sauce, and used a little less brown sugar - it turned out plenty sweet for us. I didn't have dried onion so I used fresh. Next time I would add the cheese in the last few minutes as it got a little crunchy. Served with corn and salad. The leftovers made for an easy lunch the next day - thanks for a fun recipe!

I served these along with some other apps on a recent girls night and they were a hit with my friends and I.  This is a straightforward and fairly simple recipe, best of all, pretty inexpensive.  

If you're a fan of sloppy joes you should definitely like these.  I didn't feel like 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce was enough, so I used more like 3/4-1 cup, and I like mine a little sweet so I was generous with the brown sugar.  In addition, I added a few teaspoons of mustard because it seemed like it needed a little something.  The mustard and the additional brown sugar really all depend on your taste and/or what barbecue sauce you are using.  Also, I didn't have any minced dried onion so I used about half of a medium onion, diced and sauteed.

Wow, these exceeded my expectations!!  I used the biscuit dough from the "Never Fail Biscuits" recipe on this site, and the recipe turned out great.  The recipe is very versatile and any number of fillings could be used---chicken, broccoli, and mozzarella with perhaps a cream of mushroom type soup or beef, onion, olives, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella...the possibilities are endless.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

My mom grew up making these for her little brother's cub scout troop.  She served them to us and now I make them for my family.  I love them!  I do recommend using Kraft Original barbecue sauce.  I have tried other sauces but this is the only one that my mom or I care for.  Also, I never use just 3/4 lb. because I always buy 1 lb. packs.  I add a little extra off all of the other ingredients.  I usually buy two cans of biscuits instead of one and fill up as many biscuit cups as it takes to use up the meat mixture.  Any remaining biscuits, I go ahead and cook to save for the morning.

These were very good and very easy! I put more beef mixture into the biscuits and it turned out great. Very filling as well. I also used real onion and put it in with the browned hamburger and added a little garlic powder to the meat. This recipe can be altered to fit any taste!

I agree with other reviews, these are quite sweet, if you don't want them to be sweet select a BBQ sauce that is not that sweet.  I froze the leftovers and found that I really enjoyed these for lunch.  I just removed it from the freezer bag and stuck in the oven until it was warmed and a little crispy.  I am going to try the same method, but Taco Cups instead to see if I like Taco seasoning more than BBQ sauce.  I used the cheapo biscuits which are perfect for this recipe.

I am giving them 4 stars for the way the recipe is written.  For our family I will make them less sweet, no brown sugar and a bold bbq sauce.  I added to much onion (my mistake) this time, such small bites carry the taste!  Will make these again will changes for my family!  Made some GF by using a mini muffin tin and GF Bisquick spreading the biscuit mix up the sides of the tin.  My son thought they were great!

i omitted the Brown sugar alltogether and used Emeril's BAM BBQ sauce mixed with a couple TBSP's of Sweet Baby Rays.  Very fun!

This recipe is from the late 1980's.  I've satisfied many children (and grown ups) with this  marvelous little treat.  It's simple, quick and no one ever complains.  The original recipe called form the basics, ground beef, bbq sauce, brown sugar, biscuits and cheese.  Can't get much simpler than that!!

I love making these. Try these as a deep dish pizza, cheese on the bottom, then toppings, and a little sauce on top.

I used ground turkey, less brown sugar and some very good quality bbq sauce.  They turned out very tasty and were fun to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

These make a great hot lunch and take very little time. These aren't going to impress anyone and they aren't even pretty, but they are tasty and filling too. My husband was delighted when he walked in for lunch and saw I had these prepared. Thanks, we enjoyed!

Pretty Good! Kinda tasted like meatloaf. I used fresh cooked onion,green pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper in mine and it really perked it up alot.  I made the mistake of using jumbo buttermilk biscuits, too much biscuit, not enough meat. Overall though, this recipe was easy and tasty. It would be a good party or tailgating food.
