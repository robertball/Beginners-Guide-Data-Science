This was too salty. I recommend soaking the meat for 30 minutes prior to cooking to remove excess salt, as one does with brined meats.

This is an amazing recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out perfect. The meat is so soft and tender and its sweet and savory at the same time.  The best part is the pulled pork sliders the next day!
