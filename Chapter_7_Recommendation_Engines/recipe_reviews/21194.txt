This comes out just like my favorite resturant's! Allow the cream mixture to simmer and reduce for best results.

This is really good and really simple. I used half & half instead of cream, and used fresh garlic. Make sure you add the parm slowly so it has a chance to melt. Thanks for a great recipe, Gail!

This was yummy. I accidentally 'dumped' the garlic powder (it came out really fast!) and it still tasted great. I think alfredo sauce can never be too garlicky anyway! I had never made it before and was surprised how easy it was. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good! I used penne pasta, because that is all I had, and I subbed 1/2 Smart Balance for 1/2 of the butter. It was so rich and yummy! This dish is best served just after being made. I had leftovers, and heated some up in the microwave the next day (I added a teaspoon or two of cream, and covered it before heating)and the butter kind of seperated from it. It was still pretty good, but not as good as it was when it was first made. Maybe it was the Smart Balance? I don't know. Irregardless, it is a wonderful recipe!

Yum! Next time I will use the fresh block parm..I used it from the can and it was gritty. But tasted fabulous! But you want your sauce to be smooth! I also added chopped garlic cloves and chicken! Thanks so much! :)

Awesome recipe made with ingredients I had around the house.  I used whole wheat pasta, light butter, half skim milk (instead of just cream), and reduced fat parmesan.... to lower (however slightly) the caloric content and my boyfriend didn't even notice!   I fixed his with Italian sausage and mine with broccoli.... so it's very versatile.   This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Great! It tasted just like Olive Garden. My only problem was that it was very oily and fatty even after I reduced the butter.

I was making my chicken alfredo with veggies and penne pasta and used this recipe for the sauce.  I tasted it and thought it was fantastic but then decided to add about a tablespoon of cream cheese to bump it up a notch.  It was delicious either way and I have no need for another alfredo recipe.

I love, love, love this recipe!  I keep coming back to it over and over again.  It's so easy to make and very tasty!  I add crumbled bacon (the pre-cooked Oscar Meyer kind) and serve it with garlic bread.  Tonight I'm going to try and add sliced black olives to it as well.  LOVE IT!

My family loves this recipe! I use frozen filled tortellini and it turns out great. Remember to at least double the cooking time though in order to reduce for best results. Also, doesn't reheat well, that's in case there is any left.

Fantastic.  My not-quite two-year old (who is decidedly picky) ate half of the fettuccine and garlic bread on my plate.  Added salt to taste and topped with sliced chicken breast.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter to make 3 servings.  Make sure you use REAL butter.  It makes all the difference.  I also used grated parm (Kraft), and my sauce was NOT gritty.

This is excellent. The nutmeg and real parmesan cheese is the key.  The "cheese" in the botttle/can is artifical and gross. If it's grainy you didn't cook it long enough. Also try grating the cheese finer.

I thought the taste was okay, although my plate was the only one without left overs.  More like creamy butter noodles than alfredo, will not make again.

Only one star because of the unbelievable unhealthiness of this recipe.  Only serve this if you're not interested in serving healthy meals.  I actually felt guilty serving this to my family.  I should have realized a cup of butter plus a cup of heavy cream would be way too much heart-clogging stuff in one dish.  My goal is always to serve healthy main courses.  It tasted OK, but the next night when I went to serve leftovers, I did not care for it!   The fettuccine was virtually swimming in melted grease.

Excellent, even though I used 1/2 and 1/2.  I think next time I will add a dash of white wine or sherry to the sauce, maybe add broccali.  My whole family loved this one.

Pretty nice! Wish I'd had fresh Parmesan cheese for this. Seems like there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta.

The taste is very good but it calls for WAY too much butter in my opinion. I made it as directed, poured it over chicken ravioli, and baked. I had to drain off excess butter, and believe me, I like butter as much as Paula Deen does. I will definately make this again, but will use half the butter called for.

my aunt said she made the best alfredo but not anymore, i do! this recipe turned out to be the best alfredo recipe i ever tasted. i sauteed some fresh mushrooms first and added it to the sauce and it was terrific. next time i will add white chicken strips too. i also thought for a change you could fry up some bacon, drain and crumble it and add it to this sauce for a different dish. there are lots of different combations you could use for this sauce. Bon Appetit!

This came out soooo good, creamy and delicious.  I didn't have white pepper so I added ground black pepper and 1 1/2 tspn. of dried basil instead of fresh and it still came out perfect!

Whoa man this is good.  I can tell it's very fattening, but as long as I make it once in a while it's fine.  Oh man, this is SO GOOD!  I've finally found the perfect fettuccine recipe!

BUT one thing I did was I used about half Parmesan and half Romano cheese.   Glad I came back and tried this again, the first time I only had half n half and I think the cream makes all the difference.  

Thanks so much!

Pretty good alfredo sauce, definatley calls for way too much butter, next time I will only use about 7 or so Tablespoons, if you use the full amount when you warm it up the next day, you will wind up with soup! Add some oregano, salt and black pepper, and it will be amazing!

I've never really worked with melting cheeses to make a sauce, and this was the best alfredo sauce I've had.  I added garlic seasoned chicken pieces and mushrooms...  It was to die for!  Wonderful recipe!

I would give this a definite four star rating on taste, however, I had to make a few adjustments. I had to add the cheese for it to thicken and turn up the heat to medium. But it was truly delicious, my parents loved it.

My family and I loved this. I used half the butter and added chicken to it. I loved the sweetness the nutmeg gave it. My 8 year old daughter loved this so much she won't stop talking about it.

Very good - cheesy. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese which made it really easy to melt and avoided becoming grainy. The biggest problem I had was that there was no way we were getting 6 servings out of this recipe! My husband and I are huge alfredo fans, so I think we ended up with 3-4 servings of sauce. Over all, great cheesy taste and easy preparation.

This was so good.  But anything with that much butter health-conscious, but I made this for a special occasion, and it was just excellent.  Guests loved it.

My boyfriend always orders fettuccine Alfredo in restaurants. I told him it was actually real easy to make and just as good or better with the right recipe. I chose this one. I did substitute real garlic in place of garlic powder and added a few drops of Tabasco sauce. He’ll never order it out again. Best he’s ever had!!

I added 2 cups cream , only used 1 cup Parmesan, used fresh garlic, and left the parsley out.Also added some chicken in mine. The nutmeg was the star in this dish. It really brought out a wonderful flavor.

Yum! I sautéed fresh button mushrooms with onion, garlic and spinach and added that to the finished sauce. It was fantastic and caused me to feel a bit better knowing there were fresh veggiestucked in the sauce. I almost convinced myself adding the veg balanced all of the bad stuff in the heavy cream and Parmesan. Almost. The flavor is outstanding! I will make this again!!

I have made this twice now, and both times cut the butter in half down to one stick. Came out fabulous! I also substituted the heavy cream for light cream the 1st time, and 1/2 & 1/2 the 2nd time and was equally yummy both times!

It was very rich. To the point of us not feeling right. I will look for a lighter version. This tasted good and the other thing don't use Kraft cheese it was gritty.

This recipe was just O.K. for me.  I felt something was missing but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I think the concept was good, but I will keep looking for another alfredo recipe.

Unbelievably good!!!! I finally found an easy Alfredo recipe that actually tastes authentic. Even my step daughter (who doesn't like cream sauces) is raving about this.

Made it tonight, it was awesome!! I used only 3/4 cup of butter, and it was fine. Next time, I'll use a 1/2 cup and see how that turns out. My husband and sons LOVED this!!!!

This recipe had a great texture, but it sure turned out a little more salty than I like. Good meal though.

Pretty tasty - I also used about 2/3 of the butter called for - I also added sliced mushrooms and small pieces of broccoli (which afterwards, I realized I should have steamed for a couple of minutes before putting them into the sauce since the way I did it, the broccoli came out a bit crunchy).  Next time, I would try adding some roasted garlic since it seemed to be missing something.

This recipe was great.  My daughter who hates everything LOVED it!  The only suggestion I would make would be to use parmesan cheese you grate yourself.  I used "bagged" cheese and it just doesn't have the nice consistency that block parmesan has.

Loved this so much!!! Didn't have any nutmeg so I added a dash of cayanne pepper to spice it up instead.  Super easy and fast to make.  Don't forget to leave some fresh parm to grate over the finished product.  I added some sauted chicken to make it an amazing main course.

this was very good and i'll definitely be using it again, though i will use less butter as it seemed a little too greasy.
i wish i would have been able to find a block of parmesan cheese instead of the pre-grated one, as the cheese didn't want to melt and the texture was gritty.

This is the first time that I made an alfredo sauce and I found it to buttery and grainy (from the grated cheese) next time I will cut the butter in half and use shredded cheese instead of grated.

This was awesome!  I added a couple of handfuls of crumbled gorgonzola to the cheese and also added some pan-fried scallops (seasoned with tarragon and Emeril's Essence) at the end.  Definetely a keeper!
