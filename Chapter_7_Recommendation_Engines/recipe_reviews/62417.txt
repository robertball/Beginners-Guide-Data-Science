This was a delicious salad.......the only changes I made was to use only 1/4 cup olive oil and no other oils.......I also used fresh cooked beets.

I served it on individual salad plates.  It looked as great as it tasted.  I will be serving this again and again.

I'm new to cooking so I don't have a good supply of fancy oils in the cupboard YET so I just used olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, and a few good shakes of a dry lemon dill herb blend and a dash of salt and pepper for the dressing.  I have fallen in love with roasted beets so I used them instead of canned.  The sweetness of the beets combined with the celery, onion, and tomatoes was wonderful!  This cool and crisp salad was perfect for a nice summer day like today!  I look forward to making it again when I have walnut oil!

I used green pepper and onion to get the green color and the onion flavor.  I cooked fresh beets.  The walnut oil really makes this salad!  It smells great, looks cool and crisp, and tastes delightful!

I loved this recipe and it has become a standard at our house. The flavors blend wonderfully together.
