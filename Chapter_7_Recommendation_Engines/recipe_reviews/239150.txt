I did enjoy this recipe but there is one major flaw in it. The recipe title says stew yet directions do not state to rinse and drain the beans and corn. The tomatoes and broth yield plenty of juice so if you do not rinse and drain the beans and corn then you end up with soup and not stew. Rule of thumb...always rinse black beans. They will muddle up and give an unpleasant color to anything you are fixing if you do not. As far as the rest of it goes, drain the rest of your beans and corn if you want stew...leave some of their juices if you want soup.

I really enjoyed this. I found a spicy ranch dressing mix that worked great for this. I used fresh corn cut off the cob and fresh cubanelle peppers. I used fire roasted canned tomatoes which added wonderful flavor. Garnished with fresh sliced avocado. The fresh corn and avocado really made this dish.

Made this as first reviewer suggested (draining and rinsing the beans and corn)
I could not find 16 oz. cans of shoe peg corn in my local stores, so I went with three 11oz. cans of Green Giant shoe peg. worked out great.
Family loved it.

This came out very tasty but there is a lot of it. My 15" cast iron skillet was full after adding the tomato products and corn. I had to transfer it to a my large stew pot to finish adding the beans. The volume of the ingredients adds up to over 5 quarts so unless you have a very large deep skillet I suggest you brown the onion and ground beef in a large skillet, add the taco seasoning and ranch dressing mix and the can of diced tomatoes and then transfer the mixture to a stew pot with a slotted spoon. The diced tomatoes will deglaze the skillet so you won't loose the the browned beef flavoring. Add the remaining ingredients to the stew pot except for he chicken broth. Add chicken broth to get your desired thickness and simmer for 1 hour.

I made this as the recipe is written and our family enjoyed it. It was too salty for me, but with fresh avocado it wasnt as noticeable. A little goes a long way, we had it for lunch and didn't need to have dinner. My son and husband loved it. If I make it again I'll make my own taco seasoning to avoid salt. I did rinse the beans, which is indicated in the video but was omitted from the written directions.

This was great made just like the recipe.  My grandsons age, 14 and 13 loved it.  They are pretty big eaters.  There were five of us and not tons left over.

Wonderful!  I pulled back a little on the beef, taco/ranch seasoning, and the tomatoes - only because my pot was not big enough to hold all of it.   It's very easy, delicious, and the leftovers are even better .  If I made it, anyone can.  It is so good I've been craving it like mad so I'm making it again this weekend!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Do not drain beans, drain corn. brown meat and onions in a dutch oven then add remaining ingredients. A skillet is NOT large enough for this recipe I have found.

I make it with 1/2 of the chicken broth for a thicker consistency (as suggested) & ground turkey.  It is phenomenal!  I always double the recipe for dinner the rest of the week.

My neighbor gave me a bowl of this when she made it, with only one package of taco seasoning and one of ranch dressing seasoning, and I could have eaten the whole thing in one setting.   I just made it, and used 2 taco seasonings and 1 ranch.  Thank goodness I didn't use 2 ranch seasoning packages as well, because it is EXTREMELY SALTY!!  I don't even know if I can eat it.  I'm going to add more water and some avocado and, hopefully, will be able to salvage it.  I was so looking forward to it.  Otherwise, the flavor is delicious.

This was great!
I drained and rinsed the beans and drained the corn. I made up for the lost liquids by adding in more Chicken Stock. I used Chipotle Rotel and Fiesta Ranch Dressing Mix.
I made homemade spanish rice to mix in and topped it off with sour cream and queso fresco.

This is very good, I added some graulated garlic to the meat and onions when browning and rinsed the beans.  I used frozen corn because that is what I had and doubled the batch using lean ground turkey.  This is a keeper!
