This is exactly like you would expect from a high end seafood restaurant.  I know,  I worked in one for many years and this is EXACTLY like we would serve our customers!  The cocktail sauce is spot on and SO much better than the jarred stuff. DON'T change anything. Use the biggest shrimp you can find.

This was a fantastic way to season up shrimp. I've never done this before and now I will always season like this. Perfect flavor and the recipe was right on.

Thank you so much! Only way I will prepare shrimp cocktail from now on!  Only change I made was adding a little dried tarragon instead of fresh.  I didn't have fresh.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce is the best ever!  So good!

I made the recipe and loved it. I did make a few modifications. First, I cleaned the shrimp itch kitchen shear, leaving the tails on. I heated up the broth water and simmer the shells for 10 minutes. I removed the shells and made the broth per the recipe, except I substituted dried tarragon (1+ tsp) for the fresh tarragon. The shrimp cooked very quickly, perhaps 3 minutes.

The other modification I made was the Chili Sauce. I didn’t want to buy a bottle because I doubt I would use it again. Upon looking up the ingredients online, I substituted (more or less)  with ingredients I had on hand: 2 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 tsp white vinegar, and 1 tsp Huy Fong Chile Garlic Sambal. The results were perfect!

This was awesome. I made one change and used beer instead of water. I have always cooked my shrimp in beer and old bay but the added spices really elevated the taste.

I made it exactly as directed to see if it was worth the "trouble." When cooking the shrimp, make it easy on yourself. 5 minutes is perfect and don't measure anything. That's what I did. I also used all dry ingredients and man, the shrimp was so good!! Don't change the sauce either. It was just fantastic. I will make this again and again.

INCREDIBLE!! Made for company and everyone raved about the homemade cocktail sauce, even my husband whom I affectionately refer to as the "condiment king" declared this the best cocktail sauce he has ever had. The shrimp were delicious, and this method of cooking really takes shrimp cocktail to another level. Thanks Chef John for another amazing recipe!!!

I've always bought shrimp chilled and cooked.  Never again! I made these for Thanksgiving appetizers and guests raved over them.  Lot's of "these are the best shrimp I've ever eaten!" I bought frozen, raw shrimp from Whole Foods (they seemed to have really good frozen seafood).  I made the recipe as written with no changes made.  This is a keeper.

This was fantastic!  I have made shrimp cocktail a few times but it was missing "something".  This recipe hit the nail on the head for us and was most like what you order in a restaurant. Only change made was I did not have the tarragon so I subbed oregano.  Perfection!

Do not make any changes! This is the perfect shriimp cocktail prep and sauce. I have made it at least 6 times and it comes out best just as it is. I used colossal shrimp for a picnic  and smaller ones for salads.  Be sure to let the brine cook to absorb the spices before adding the shrimp.
This is now my only shrimp cocktail recipe.

I had to substitute marjoram for the tarragon (didn't have any on hand), but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter, and it was out of this world! I will be making it again soon and with much more shrimp next time!!!

I had guests over so I made more than I thought I needed... Wrong! Every last one was gone so no leftovers for Chef Mathew. The shrimp were so moist and flavorful not a morsel was left and I was worried that the main dish would go to waste!

I only made the cocktail sauce to put on crawfish po-boy sandwiches.  I will never purchase cocktail sauce again! This is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and used sweet Thai chili sauce.  It was spicy and delicious.

I tried it this way tonight.  I usually just broil my shrimp but I'm tired of that way.  The aromatics were great.  I subbed fennel seeds for the tarragon... and followed the recipe exactly.  Very tasty shrimp.  I didn't need to boil them more than about a little over a minute.  I used slightly smaller shrimp (jumbo regulars  21-25.

I made this yesterday for New Year's Eve exactly as the recipe was written, both for the sauce and the shrimps.  The  shrimp were the juiciest and best we'd ever had - not exaggerating!  Will make this way again and again - love Chef John - he makes me laugh and his recipes are great!

I wasn’t impressed by all the work it took boiling the shrimp as it didn’t seem to change the flavor at all. I loved the cocktail sauce although I would not put as much horseradish next time.

I'd never thought to flavor the water that shrimp would boil in but it made quite a difference.  Someone recently gave me a cocktail sauce recipe that they loved-I tried it-we loved it-turned out to be this recipe! The entire recipe is now on my radar to make often.

Shrimp has great flavor!! And the cocktail sauce hits the perfect spot.........great amount of heat for me. May have to kick it down a notch for guests who don’t enjoy a lot of spice/heat. But perfect for me

This is actually a question.  What is the most time you would recommend fixing this in advance?  Is it okay to prepare the day before you plan to serve it?  Thanks much!

We loved the shrimp and cocktail sauce. Our first time at homemade sauce and the poaching method. The liquid is so aromatic and adds flavor. The shame of it is to make that liquid up just to cook the shrimp for 5 minutes then dump it. Anyone find other recipes that could use this liquid? Anyone cool and keep it for another batch ? Anyone strain and freeze it?

Seriously, the best recipe. I wish I had had the temperance to photograph it before devouring it. The poaching was key. The sauce was incredible. Hats off to chef John!

Love love love this! Have made this several times! Will never buy cooked shrimp again - this is so easy to prepare the shrimp and tastes like the peel and eat shrimp you get in a seafood restaurant!

Chef John--The Shrimp Cocktail was a hit!  My adult children and their spouse participated in helping with putting the ingredients together.   I did let the shrimp set in salt water (not too much salt) overnight in the refrigerator before processing the next day.  Do not go heavy on the spices when making the sauce because my grand-babies were not able to try the sauce.  Yes, I have grand-kids 6,7, and 8 that loves Shrimp.  You can't eat just one.

I love shrimp and this was the best  recipe I have ever tried. I made the recipe as written except used dill instead and it turned out amazing. I will definitely make this again. The shrimp was tender and so flavorful. The sauce was great too.

PERFECTION!   I followed the recipe with no changes but used my own cocktail sauce due to the ingredients I had on hand.  We loved this appetizer and I will be making it again.  Thank you Chef John!  "You never let me down!"

Outstanding! The poaching liquid was very creative Chef John (reminded of a crab boil of sorts) and the cocktail sauce...better than restaurant style because it is homemade. For the poaching liquid I like others did not have terragon so I substituted basil and oregano. Overall, delicious and easy peasy!

this was super delicious.. i loved the poaching liquid.. it was something very different than what i'm used to as i normally saute or grill my shrimp.. i used smaller shrimp so it only took 2 minutes to cook.. had to sub dried tarragon for fresh but followed everything else.. we also really liked the cocktail sauce and found it to be like the stuff you get at the restaurants.. the only modification for the cocktail sauce was using Chili Sauce Recipe (on this site) for the chili sauce.. i usually make my cocktail sauce more spicy and pungent, but this was a nice change of pace.. ty for the recipe

This has a wonderful kick which may put off milquetoasts at your gathering.  I've never had any such attendees, and thus all mine have raved.  But beware the shrimp quantity! Two pounds of jumbo shrimp yields 84-100 shrimp.  The recipe says four servings, or about 25 shrimp per serving. You may want to scale back on the shrimp.

I’ve always struggled with shrimp but Chef John’s guidance in this recipe saved the day! I used Jumbo & cooked for 4 mins in the broth. The texture was perfect & the shrimp flavorful despite my lack of fresh tarragon & lemons (used dry and lemon juice equivalent). I already had jarred cocktail sauce so I used that but am looking forward to making the one in the recipe next time!

Great flavor. Shrimp turned out nice and 'crisp' not mushy or soggy. Company loved them.  The cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it without being too hot.  This will definitely be my go to shrimp cocktail recipe.

This was an excellent shrimp boil.  I used bottled cocktail sauce simply because I was out of ketchup!  It was still better than the grocery store cocktail shrimp.

Thanks is a very classic recipe that can't be beat but I'm confused about the shrimp being described as shell-on deviened. There is no instruction to shell them after cooking.  I'm assuming that the shrimp should be shelled and deviened after cooking as is common with shrimp cocktail.

I made this w/wild caught gulf shrimp which I'm sure contributed to the outstanding results, but I still give the poaching liquid a big thumbs up - smelled wonderful while the shrimp were cooking, and tasted fantastic.  I used store-bought cocktail sauce and I may try the sauce described here next time, but the truth is the shrimp were so good plain you hardly need it!

I made it just as written and the shrimp and sauce were great. I think cooking the shrimp in the shell does give them more flavor. I will certainly make them this way from now on. The cocktail sauce was also excellent. I like a lot of horseradish flavor and it was perfect.

This is restaurant quality and delicious!  While in Rocky Point, Mexico I bought fresh shrimp to bring back to Phoenix. Made this recipe with a pound of shrimp to take to a party and it disappeared within minutes! Glad I saved a few for myself  at home

Never realized shrimp cocktail could be this involved but it’s definitely worth it.  I used to always buy frozen pre-cooked shrimp…never again.  I’ve committed myself to working with uncooked shrimp with the shell on; the shell adds flavor no matter how you prepare the shrimp.  This broth kicks the shrimp up a little with multiple flavors and when folks see me cooking it this way, it makes me look like a pro!

As far as the sauce, this is a great place to start.  I don’t have chili sauce so I play around with other dry spices like smoked chili powder, chipotle, ancho chili powder, etc. to get the heat I like.

Shrimp tasted great even without sauce. I love horseradish but next time I would use less.

This is an update to my earlier review, I neglected to mention the shrimp boil which was great! It had a wonderful aroma while it was cooking also!

Outrageously  Excellent! Especially the sauce. I didnt get the flavor of the shrimp alone only because the sauce was addictive.

The cocktail sauce is essentially Ina Garten's recipe with a slight variation in the amount of ketchup.  It's always been my favorite recipe and does get rave reviews! I do like it better with a 1:1 ratio of chili sauce to ketchup.

My first time ever bothering to make my own shrimp cocktail and this was amazing!  Even with the hijacks of using dried tarragon and ground black pepper.  Son and husband loved.

I have tried a few different recipes for cocktail shrimp and this is the best so far! The cocktail sauce was excellent as well, I'm not a fan of spicy food but this has a GOOD kind of kick to it....all my guests were pleased and the platter was empty fast!

I have never made my own shrimp cocktail before  I had only purchased it in the store. It is so easy.  The homemade cocktail sauce is quick, easy, and tastes great.
