I put a little flour on each side of the patty before browning, which makes a crispy crust. Simple, tasty, and inexpensive.

These were really good and really quick to make.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the crackers.  I also added one clove minced garlic.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as posted.  Served with Creamy Dill Sauce from this site.  Great, quick dinner!

Very yummy and quick dish!  I'm from Canada, so 14.75 oz is equivalent to 418 g.

Used a 418g can of pacific sockeye salmon (bones already removed) and drained as instructed.  I also removed some of the salmon skin, but that was purely for aesthetic reasons.  I'm sure if the skin was left in the patties, the taste would not have been affected.  The recipe made 2 4-inch patties plus 2 3-inch patties -- each patty was about 3/4-inch thick.  We used them in a sandwich, which was very good!  Italian bread + salmon filling + fresh tomato slices + miracle whip.

Modifications: Doubled the worcestershire sauce (from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp) and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  Still didn't really taste any worcestershire, so next time I will use 2 tsp instead.  I like the addition of lemon juice as the citrus flavour compliments salmon well; may also add a bit more lemon juice next time.  Also used 6 soda crackers instead of 5, and fried the patties in olive oil instead of butter.  Followed previous reviewer's advice and lightly floured all the patties before frying, which creates a slightly crunchy exterior.

These were good.  The Worchestshire is unexpected in this recipe, but it works!  The (5) saltines was a little skimpy though.  I will probably do eight or ten next time to make 4 patties.  With only five saltines it makes three and a half patties.  Good recipe though!  We love salmon patties at our house and we dip them in Chili Sauce.

Excellent recipe - quick, easy and very tasty.  I made a few changes as per other comments such as extra saltines and dipping in flour before frying.  Delicious.

This was quite tasty and moist.  The worcestershire added a nice taste.  I removed skin and bones, but I always do that. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing!

Very tasty! I didn't have saltines, so I used panko instead which gave it a very light crispy coating. Thank you for a great simple recipe!

Tried salmon patties one before and was not impressed.  But this was excellant. I followed recommendations and added a full tsp of Worcetershire sauce, 8 saltines, and a full tbsp on lemon juice and then a tad after that.  Cooked in olive oil and served on Hamb Buns with green salad and steamed zucc squash.

Doubled crackers, coated with flour and fried in canola oil rather than butter. I listen to the collective wisdom!

This was very good. I doubled the recipe, but think that I could have still only used one egg. Had a little trouble keeping the patties from not falling apart. My picky son loved them!

I coat each patty in cornmeal or dry cornbread mix before frying  Note: I remove the bones and skin from the canned salmon (gently split the salmon the bones and skin will be exposed) and fry in shortening or oil not butter :) its the egg and crackers that hold the patty together if using small egg I use 2 and I do add more crackers than stated here until the consistency seems right  This is a recipe my grandmother also used Thanks for sharing !

This was my first time cooking with canned salmon, and next time I will definitely buy the boneless skinless salmon. It was a terrible experience picking out all the bones. Anyways, I used 9 (roasted vegetable) Ritz crackers instead of saltines because that's what I had. I also added a minced clove of garlic. My boyfriend and I loved them! However, I believe next time I will use olive oil instead of butter. used much more than 2 tsp.

Yummy recipe! Brings back memories of my childhood :o) Super quick and fairly healthy since I used a bit of canola oil and cooking spray instead of butter. I added three more crackers and minced garlic as other reviewers mentioned. I also used a lot more Worcesterchire sauce as I remembered my mom did "back in the day" This recipe is great and I will use it as a reference many times in the future. Thank you!

Great easy recipe. I substituted the saltines, however with corn flake crumbs for a less bland flavor. Also I don't believe this recipe makes 6 patties. I only get 4 medium patties with the substitution of 1/4 cup of crumbs.

After reading reviews i tried it. Mostly because the picture looks like the ones mom use to make. I doubled the crackers to 10, added 1/2 tsp minced garlic,then made patties and patted with self-rising flour. Followed the rest of directions as written. They came out like the picture and were delicious. I did have to cook a little longer than the 3-4 min to get the brown crusty effect.

Tasty! I think next time I will follow the recommendations of another reviewer and add more crackers, since they did fall apart a bit. I also may try adding the lemon juice for a little extra zing.

Wow, I am not very picky but this recipe, as is, is not good.  Firstly, it did not hold together very well.  Secondly, the taste was absolutely unremarkable.  I can't understand how in the world it got so many good marks.  Still on a quest for a GOOD salmon patty recipe.  I remember really liking my mom's recipe but alas, she is not around anymore to ask her for it.

I made this with a 6 oz can of salmon from Costco keeping all the other ingredients the same as the recipe. I coated each patty lightly with flour and fried in just a bit of olive oil on a non-stick griddle pan. We really loved the result.

I thought the recipe was great.  I did add a little more crackers to it and cooked them in olive oil.

This is a quick, simple and awesome recipe. By making a few minor additions (a few extra crackers), substitutions (lemon pepper for black pepper) and additions (sprinkle with parmesian cheese immediately after removing from skillet), my picky, seafood-hating husband asks for it at least twice a week.

This was really good.  The only change I made was to add about 1 Tsp. of lemon juice.  Very quick and easy!!  Thanks for the post.

I doubled this recipe, and don't recommend it.  It ended up being far too salty.  Next time, I would omit the 1/4 teaspoon and rely on the saltines for the salt.  So if you double it, omit the salt.

Good recipe. I used whole wheat bread crumbs, doubled the recipe and used a whole onion. I also doubled the amount of worcestershire sauce and added lemon juice. I like how well these stayed together.

My family liked it which is why it gets 5 stars.  My patties didn't stick together as well as I'd have liked but it might be because I didn't squeeze enough water out of the salmon. Next time I'll squeeze more!!!

Oh man, was this a good recipe!  It had just the right blend of ingredients for me.  I used onion powder in lieu of onions, and Old Bay instead of pepper.  Yummmy!

Great recipe I did change it up though. I added about 5 extra cracker's, teaspoon of lemon juice, and a tablespoon of Heinz 57. Turned out great the Heinz gave it just the right amount of flavor without overpowering it. I think next time I will put some flour on the outside for a crispier crust.

Next time I may try adding some fresh parsley or dill for a different flavor and more color.

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes because I didn't want the carbs from the saltines, the fat from the butter, and didn't have Worcestershire sauce. Instead of the saltines I used grated carrots, instead of the butter I used extra virgin olive oil and instead of the Worcestershire sauce I used fresh ground pepper. They were extremely easy to do and fast! Tasted great!

This was so simple but I did modify a bit. I did not use worcestershire or crackers. I only used salt, onions, eggs, bread crumbs and olive oil instead of butter. ( I just did have the other ingredients in the house :-)) But they were great especially being my first time. Thanks!

Very simple for those who are beginners, and folks in a hurry.  Yummy!  I used the 14.75 oz can of salmon with skin and some bones left in ('cause that's what I had on hand).  I didn't use the onions, and I overdid it with the Worcestershire sauce by "estimating."  I also added hot sauce to the mix.  Instead of saltines, I used some Food Should Taste Good brand multi-grain tortilla chips/crackers; I don't think I used enough because the patties were still very moist and fell apart when turning.  Next time, I will use the amount of Worcestershire in the recipe, and maybe add some lemon juice and/or mayo.  I will definitely use more crackers/chips.

Yummy and very easy to make! My 7 year old daughter pretty much made them herself with some help from me.  To top that, she doesn't like fresh salmon for some reason- but she loved these salmon patties!  Good go to recipe when you're short on time. The taste was good too.

Absolutely perfect!  Just like my "Nannie" used to make.  I used two 6oz. pouches of Chicken of the Sea boneless/skinless pink salmon and increased crackers to 8.  These were very moist as I was trying to form them, but crisped up nicely when frying.  I will definitely make these many more times.  Thanks!

I did not have onions so I just made it without them and they turned out great.  The sauce is a twist and it was very good and will make this a lot for a quick meal on a busy day.

I've made these several times. They taste great and are easy to make.  Make sure you use salmon fillets( two 7 oz cans) rather than a can of whole salmon which includes bones and skin.

So quick and easy! I used flax instead of the crackers, and added in finely grated carrot. They were a bit crumbly, but that was probably from the flax.  I did sautee the onion before using, and used boneless/skinless salmon. The kids loved them.

My very picky daughter loved these patties.  Unfortunately, she and I were the only ones in our family of 5.  I did not have saltines so I used Ritz crackers.  Also, my family doesn't eat onions so I substituted onion powder (1/2 tsp - 3/4 tsp).  They came out very tasty and nice and crispy on the outside.

This was so easy to make and very delicious!!! I won over my skeptical hubby. I added 8 crackers and it made 6 good size patties. No need for salt though. I floured each side before putting them in the pan to give the outside a bit of crunch. Butter tends to burn, so I cooked them just below medium heat. Definitely making again!

Awesome recipe.  The only thing I did different was I rolled the salmon balls slightly in flour before placing in pan with a little butter.  Then flattened to make patty.  Really came out good.

Tasty!  I couldn't help myself from adding my own twist.  Additions included chopped green pepper, more crackers (buttery kind), and some lemon juice.  I've also substituted chopped fresh salmon or tuna.
  
These are fragile and it's best to make the patties and put them in the refrigerator for at least an hour before frying them. 

You can really customize fish cakes so don't be afraid to try your own twists.

I had never made salmon patties before and these were great.  I would recommend using green onions and adding a few more crackers.

First time I've ever made salmon patties. I'm not much for fish, but my husband is. They were delicious, he said, just like his mom's. I doubled the saltines & put a little flour on each side before browning, like another review had suggested. This is a keeper. by mv

Better than my mom's, I hate to say.  But that may be because she used to leave the skin and bones in there!  I did add two extra crackers and a half teaspoon (or so) each of lemon juice and grey poupon mustard.  And I put some flour on the patties before I put them in the pan.  My husband ridiculed my desire to make salmon patties.  He kept saying how gross they are.  Well, he ate four of them!  Great recipe.

This is a good recipe that can easily be altered. I usually use green onion instead of white, and use bread crumbs mixed with panko instead of saltine crackers. I add garlic, too. It tastes great with the Creamy Dill Dipping Sauce from this website!

These were pretty good. They seemed to fall apart easly even after letting them sit for awhile before frying. We will most likely have again. Thanks for the recipe.

I use the vac-u-sealed packs of salmon and dry mustard and several more crackers.  I was out of Worcestershire, but that will be added next time! Yummy!

We modfied this recipe to better suit our tastes (and what ingredients we had in the house). It turned out very good.  We decreased the eggs, used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers, added sour cream, crab meat, garlic, and squeezed in a lime wedge.  We also used olive oil instead of butter.  Oh, and we added a minced serrano pepper to spice it up!  It took a little time to make, but it's good for a weekend.
