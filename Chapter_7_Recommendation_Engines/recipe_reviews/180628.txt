The Batsaria recipe posted is very good. Not only is it good, the first day but even better the second. And the crust fuses nicely with the other ingredients.  Thank you for posting, I would recommend. It will be a regular in my oven.  Always looking for good recipes and this one was over the top.

This was just delicious!  I'm not very familiar with Greek cuisine at all, but I liked the combination of leeks and spinach in this, and also that it was not too "eggy".  The crust was very good, and the only changes I made was that I could not find fresh dill, so I used a heaping teaspoon of dried, and I only had about half the recommended amount of parmesan (all I had left on hand).  It was very good the first day, and even better the next!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe, Gracey!

The filling is pretty good, a little too wet for our taste but we enjoyed it nonetheless (will strain it much more next time). We didn't care for the dough part of the pie; I would definitely use phyllo next time. The changes... Two large leeks, three green onions, half a red onion, a bit of mint and basil for the spearmint. I used a Bulgarian feta, which wasn't as salty as the Greek variety can be so the salt factor was lacking in the final product. I still prefer traditional spanakopita though.

The whole family agreed, that this was the best spinach pie. I didn`t make the topping and used only 1/2 cup olive oil, or even less. Very delicious, thanks.

This smelled amazing while it was cooking. Probably my own fault, but the taste was a bit of a disappointment. I wasn't quite sure how to quantify a "bunch" of parsley/dill/spearmint, but apparently I didn't get it quite right.  Also tried to cut back on the amount of feta (2 1/3 cups seemed like an awful lot), which I'm guessing would have made a huge difference.  The filling was still overly wet, even after the crust was well-done. Could have been that spinach was still too damp after washing/draining, though it seemed odd not to saute the veggies.

I loved this! The rest of the family, not so much. They didn't like the "hint of mint," but I thought it added to the dish's appeal. I don't think it reheats well, though. I will make it again since I like it and I'm the cook.

I really loved this recipe.  The crust was really good ( didnâ€™t add butter, Olive Oil, or Parmesan Cheese) and the flavor of the spinach was delicious. I omitted milk after reading reviews about it being too wet.  The milk was not necessary at all.

Very delicious and a terrific make-ahead dinner for a crowd.  Easier than traditional spinach-phyllo pie.  One of my go-to recipies!

We enjoyed this a lot. Very filling! Did not put on top crust; used all of that batter on the bottom of the pan; reduced oil by 1/3.
I agree with another reviewer: it was too moist/wet; will try draining veges after letting them sit a bit, also longer cooking time may be necessary.My kids don't like feta, so I used provolone, and that was great.
