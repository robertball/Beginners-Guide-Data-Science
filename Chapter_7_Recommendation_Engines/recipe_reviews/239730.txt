I love the portion control and lovely presentation of this recipe.  I think a little bit of onion would be a good addition.  The only thing that I did differently was put in about half of the potato slices, then a little dollop of the cheese sauce and then add the rest of the potatoes and top with the sauce.  The sauce is very thick, and I was concerned that the sauce wouldn't drizzle down through all of the potatoes.  GnarlyCow, thanks for a tasty and portable potato recipe.

Just finished making these. Absolutely fantastic. The only thing I changed was instead of slicing my potatoes, I grated them... peelings and all. Mixed them in with the sauce and then sprinkled a small amount of shredded cheddar blend on top before cooking. I did this to make them easier for my mom to chew since she just had major dental work done.  She LOVED them! Thank you so much.

Loved this recipe. I did follow the advice of others and layered the potatoes with salt and pepper and sauce between each layer. I covered them for 30 minutes then baked uncovered for 15 more. Turned the broiler on at the end to get them nice and brown. I'm not sure I needed to cover them but I was afraid they wouldn't be cooked all the way and I knew it couldn't hurt them. This simple cheese sauce made the best potato gratin I've ever had. I did use real parmesano reggiano cheese. Perfect pairing for any protein. Can't wait to make them again!

Just made this for a party last night and only brought 4 home!  I doubled the recipe and made 24, but I tripled the white sauce and used 1 cup milk per each 2 T. of butter and flour.  That is the standard I use when making any kind of sauce.  I used cheddar cheese, layered sauce in between, and topped with a bit more cheddar and chopped bacon.  I also added some onion powder to the sauce and seasoned each layer with salt & pepper.  Baked around 30 minutes uncovered.  Everyone loved them!

We found these delightful!  I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of subbing white potatoes for russets and crushed red for black pepper.  We found this style led us to eat fewer potatoes, which is a good thing!  The leftovers heated up well for lunch the next day.  THANKS for the recipe!

I added sharp cheddar and layered it. Oh my it was to die for. The sharp cheddar is a must in my opinion which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The parm on its own wouldn't give it the melt factor. However, a cute idea that has room for so much variation based on your cheese of choice.

I'm giving this a 5* rating, primarily because a) the cheese sauce is simply wonderful and b) any problems I had were probably of my own making.  I used mandolin to slice potatoes 1/8" thick, then layered half into jumbo sized muffin tins (spreading 1/2 of sauce in middle as others suggested).  Because I had increased the size of the tins, I decided to go ahead and bake covered for 20", then uncovered for adt'l 20 minutes.  My potatoes came out more steamed and ween't crunchy on the edges at all ... so I wouldn't suggest covering them next time.  We both agreed there wasn't enough sauce to suit our tastes - again, probably because I had increased size of tins.  I think next time I'll try dividing into 3 ramikins with more sauce *or* (now here's a brilliant idea) make 6 regular size cupcake tins with the same amount of sauce.  I didn't find any lack of flavor whatsoever and was quite pleased with the taste ... just need to work on the consistency part.  Thanks so much for recipe!

Let's just say.. Portion control? What portion control? My husband ate 8 of these! They were amazing. I did later a bit of sauce between the potatoes as suggested. I didn't change anything else. Delicious! Thank you, gnarly cow!

These potatoes are REALLY REALLY GOOD! Follow the recipe as is and you will not be disappointed! I eat measuring the portions of my foods and just the idea of having muffin size servings thrilled me and I needed to try the recipe. For those who are controlling the portions of food intake this is PERFECT. You won't be disappointed try it hands down you have to try it!
Edit: When preparing the sauce add a pinch of nutmeg and you will have a great tasting gratin similar to the original made with the long method

I used this recipe as a guideline, so don't kill me for making changes.  I swapped cheddar for the parmesean, lost the garlic because I used smokey chipolte mrs dash instead.  It is easier though to mix the potatoes into the cheese mixture in the sauce pan and then spoon into the muffin tin.  Came out lovely.  Will definately make again.

These were very good.  I liked being able to put the portions in a freezer bag to be pulled out as individual serving as needed.

I followed this recipe with a few extras to doctor it up a bit. I used Jarlsberg cheese instead, and when used sautéed onions in the roux. Lastly, I used a panko/parm mixture on top to give these tasty morsels added flavor and texture. Because I had quite a bit of sliced potatoes leftover, I cut the a few of the remaining slices into half moons and used them as decoration in each tin to make them look like little roses. I looked at everyone's faces when I brought these to the table and everyone was wondering what they were. I told them it was a surprise. I watched them each take a first bite and they all looked at me in wide eyed wonderment. They couldn't stop complimenting me on how great it tasted! I served this as the starch with baked ham, maple roasted brussel sprouts, grean beans and French onion soup to start. By far, the best potato dish ever! 

As a note to other Allrecipe followers, read the comments from the other cooks as there are some great tips and suggestions. In this case, I didn't want to spend a fortune on Gruyere cheese. The cost of Jarlsberg was more than half the cost of Gruyere and I find it to be every bit as tasty. 

Happy cooking!

For sure I will make it again. I added some mushrooms and onions . I did double the amount of filling as I felt the recipe is kind of short for the amount of 12 units!

I made this simple but delicious recipe the other night. I used half and half instead of milk and I doubled everything.  I also cut up some bacon into  1/2 inch squares and put one on each layer of the potatoes.  It turned out fantastic!  I will most certainly make this again ... soon.

I enjoyed this recipe, the potatoes took about 15 minutes longer to cook all the way through. I added onion the first time and Italian seasoning the second time. I loved how easy they were to make!

These are a hit every time I make them.  I do switch them up with different spices depending on what I'm pairing them with.  I have tried doubling the beschemel and that was a bit too much sauce. I always put sauce between a couple different layers and finish the top with a bit of heavy cream, it makes for a lovely texture and a moist potato while still allowing for the crispy crust to form.

8-9-2016  ~Not bad, but sauce was too thick and needed to be thinned out, yet the  finished potatoes still were not as creamy as they could have/should have been.  Would make again with some tweaking.  These presented a challenge since I was making these just for Hubs- single serving mini cocottes filled in nicely for a multi-serving muffin tin.

i followed the basic sauce.  after reading many of the reviews (which i find extremely helpful) , i did the following:  added chopped, sauteed bacon and onion and  1/4 t. dry mustard.  as a test case, i did do half the recipe (1 potato) but found the sauce to be very thick so ended up using 3/4 c. milk for just 1/2 a recipe.  i used 1/3 c. cheddar and 1/3 c. parm.  i did shred the potato, rather than slice it and mixed it in with the sauce.  so easy to spoon it into the muffin cups that way.  i baked the 6 uncovered at 375 for 30 mins.  nice and crispy on the outside.  i would definitely make again with those changes.

Pretty tasty, but I did add a lot of seasonings.  I added a garlic and onion seasoning along with salt and pepper to the potatoes themselves and I added more seasoning to the roux.  Turned out well, and while I was worried the little gratins would stick badly, it wasn't so bad in my ceramic muffin pan.  Hubs enjoyed them but commented on how small they were.  Thanks for the recipe!

Have made this a couple of times now & we've made one more adjustment. Double the sauce & top with cheddar cheese for some flavor.  We also put half the potatoes in tin, half the sauce, & repeated.  Put cheddar cheese on top of potatoes the last 5 mins. This is time consuming to make, but for a special night will do.  Thinking about doing in a small baking dish instead of muffin tin also.  May need to add more milk so the sauce doesn't taste like "wallpaper paste".

I followed the suggestions to add minced onion and a bit of cheddar (in addition to the Parmesan), and put a dollop of sauce in the middle, and then on the top. Delicious. I also baked these ahead of time, refrigerated them overnight, transported them to my daughter's home 90 minutes away, and heated them in a warm oven before serving. Everyone loved them - and the texture would probably be better after the first baking. The flavor was still great. I will make these again.

Not only do they taste wonderful, but they make a beautiful presentation.  Next time I may add a smidgeon more seasoning and maybe a little thinly sliced onion.

I served this for a small family dinner party and it got rave reviews.  I followed the directions for the sauce to the letter, except that I doubled it.  I used 4 1-cup ramekins (instead of the muffin pan).  I  took one reviewers' advice and topped each with cheddar  cheese and crumbled bacon bits. I only gave it four stars because I didn't have enough sauce, even after doubling the sauce recipe.  I had to short one of the ramekins a layer as a result.  (I served that one to myself.). Next time, I will triple the sauce and add saute some finely chopped onion in the butter before adding the garlic.  This is definitely a keeper.  My guests thought I had knocked myself out.  I didn't tell them how easy it was.  Big win!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Fun portions and great for keeping and heating unused portions. However it was a little too greasy.

Unfair for me to give it five stars but based on other reviewers I used powdered garlic and onion instead of fresh, sprinkled the tops with sharp cheddar AND used the Cuisinart to shred instead of cut to make it easy and fast.  EVERYONE came back for thirds.  NOM NOM

These were pretty good.  I did them in a fluted tortilla pan, so mine needed more cooking time. We liked the flavor and will be making these again.

I added only a bit of onion with the garlic.  My whole family loved these, even the neighbor boy down the road who joined us for dinner. They paired well with a tangy meatloaf and pomegranate salad.  Next time I'm going to try them in ramekins so that each serving will be bigger!!!

Really tasty. Changes: I sautéed about 1/3 of an onion with the garlic, and I mixed the cheese sauce with the potatoes to help bind them before baking instead of putting them on top. My husband wants me to keep this one on rotation!

Seriously the easiest potato au gratin recipe there is! I did it as shown the first time but added diced ham. Second time I was in a rush and added brocolli cream of mushroom soup from can and bacon bits. Both are outstanding and you dont have to stand over stove with a pot! Tip: I used my mandolin to do super fast thin potato slices!

Excellent, elegant, individual serving potatoes that can be prepped ahead to save time for visiting with guests.  Easily adaptable to include your favorite seasonings.  I made mine in mini-loaf pans for larger appetites.

These turned out well.  3/4 cup of milk was definitely not enough. My cheese sauce was so think, I ended up gradually adding about another 3/4 cup for a total of 1.5 cups of milk.  Had to improvise on the cheese as well since I didn't have quite enough parmesan so I added about 1/4 cup of shredded blend of 4 cheeses.  I seasoned the sauce before dishing it onto the potatoes. All in all, it was pretty darn tasty and made a lovely presentation.  I froze the remaining cups for future dinners.

These were good but I was hoping for a little more flavor, even though I added some sharp cheddar to the tops and mixed in a good dose of minced onion.  I added the potatoes to the sauce before filling the muffin tins so that the sauce could get more evenly distributed.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made 1/2 recipe with 1 large potato and cut all the ingredient amounts in half. I used extra garlic and added some cayenne pepper. Filled 6 of the 12 muffin spaces. This recipe is quite quick and easy to make and very tasty. Having  neat, pre-portioned servings is really nice!

I haven't made these but they sound heavenly... I wonder what they would be like if you started with a won ton wrapper mold like you do for muffin tin lasangas and then filled with the au gratin potato/cheese filling? Might try this for Easter. Thank you for a wonderful idea.

Why does food created in small batches taste so much better?  This recipe was quick and satisfying (to say the least).  The diameter of my potatoes was larger than the diameter of my muffin tin, so after I sliced the potatoes, I cut them into quarters and layered them (with sauce in between the layers) so they would fit.  No need to be symmetrical with the assembly, just get it all in there and it will come out just fine.  I added parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder to the roux.  Fabulous!

I added a little bit of onion. The cheese sauce came out much thicker than I expected, and didn't really melt down over the potatoes. But like many others I had layered cheese and potatoes rather than putting it all on top. Very good. I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this dish.  I would say that next time I would cut back a bit on the garlic and try what another person said about grating the potatoes verses thinly slicing them as they were a bit hard to stuff down in the muffin tin.

These are are great!   I added 1 1/2 tablespoon of dried onion and a little extra milk.  I brought these to a party and people gobbled the up.  I used a 1/8 setting on my mandolin and tried to make them in the shape of flowers.   However, the potato slices were a little too thick to do this.   Next time I will try 1/16 and raise the cooking temp to 425 so they will brown nicely without being too over cooked.

I added a wee bit of milk (about a tablespoon) to each section at the end as I felt the sauce was rather thick and the milk would help cook the potatoes better. Otherwise I loved it.
Also added 1 tbs of minced onion first on the bottom,

I also added 15 minutes to the suggested cooking time.
Chopped onions and hot sauce are mandatory.
This is quite good.

(In my frenzy to make this, I forgot to peel the potatoes.
I am also going to "forget" to peel the potatoes the next time!)

Excellent exactly as written! These potatoes were melt in your mouth delicious. Wish I’d taken a picture because they looked gorgeous too. I cut the potatoes super thin and did not need to cook for any additional time. The whole family loved this dish and I will definitely be making it again soon!

Apparently put a lot more potatoes in each muffin cup than called for... but did layer the potatoes and sauce as recommended in the reviews. Had to bake longer to cook potatoes through. Turned out crazy delicious and was a huge hit with everyone young to old at the first Thanksgiving I've hosted. Thank you for this recipe!

I followed ingredients all but for adding  some shredded cheddar in addition to the parmesan.  I also followed another review & layered the sauce between a few layers of the potato peels. Quite excellent. It will remain in the books!  Thanx!

I did make some changes after reading the other reviews. I added thinly chopped onions and layered the sauce. They turned out great. Hubby loved them and wants me to definitely make them again. Nice for portion control and company.

Unique and easy way to make potatoes. However, it made a mess of my nonstick muffin pan and it took forever to clean it.

I didn't quite have the knife skills to thinly slice, so the potato pieces were a little thicker. And I substituted garlic puree for cloves. But the flavor was great and serving them in the muffin tray was fantastic

The only change I made was to use red pepper flakes instead of black pepper and I layered the potato and sauce.

This was easy and delicious. Because others said that there wasn't much flavor, I added some herbs (marjoram and oregano) to the roux, and used half Parmesan and half garlic oregano jack cheese. I also used 3/4 cup of cheese to make it richer.

If you leave the potatoes in the muffin tin to set, they come out much more easily.

Oh wow, such a different, new way to make potatoes!!  I don't really make au gratin or scalloped potatoes often because my kids don't like them, so when they went to Grandma's for a few days, I came across this recipe and HAD to make it.  I did as other's suggested and put some of the sauce in between the layers and next time I would probably double the sauce.  I didn't slice my potatoes thin enough so they would bend to shape to the muffin pan, but that was my fault, but I made it work the best I could.  The flavor is amazing and the hubs gave it a big thumbs up :) :)  Oh, topped them all of with a little shredded cheddar, yum!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe. I always ask if I could make it better by making changes and should I make this again. My family really loved this. They came right out of the muffin tin.

I'm giving this 5 stars, because the portions and combinations of ingredients is FABULOUS.  Cheddar cheese is a good addition for Au Gratin Potatoes, however.  Great job and thank you for sharing this recipe!

About the only thing I did different, I left the skins on the potatoes. Simply because it was easier and we like the skins. The potatoes are so thinly sliced that having the skins there wasn't a big thing anyway

Made these for Easter dinner.  They were very good.  Next time I'll make the sauce thinner so it runs through the potatoes better, and after one or two slices flat on the bottoms, I'm going to stand the rest of the slices to get better integration of the sauce and potatoes

I followed the recipe pretty darn closely, but used red potatoes, and made it in a six cup muffin tin.  I was really happy with the results, and I would definitely make it again.

I didn't measure the potato with the muffin tin and the potatoes had to be sliced in half to fit, then I didn't have enough sauce to make more than two layers. I used a mix of Parmesan and Asiago cheeses and my granddaughters loved them. I will definitely try again and be more cognizant  of the ingredients. They were worth the time, taste wise.

Bomb Diggity!  Made these for Easter and they were a huge hit.  Super easy and great for those who need help with portion control:)  If you have any left over they reheat really well.  I used my spiralizer to slice my potatoes and that worked extremely well. Thanks for submitting.  This will be in my regular rotation!

Fun twist on scalloped potatoes. Used only sharp cheddar, the way I make the traditional pan-full. Nice and neat way to serve everyone. Crunchy and creamy, both. Will certainly make again.

Made this to go with the Coca Cola Ham a few months ago. It was just okay for me. I was wanting more of a cheese taste to it. It had too much of a garlic taste to me, and I like garlic. The rest of my guests liked it and my husband said it was more of the traditional Au Gratin Potato, but it's not to my taste. I guess it is just a preference thing.

Just ok. The garlic was a mistake as the flavours didn't mesh well. I added sautéed onion, a dash of nutmeg, and topped with a bit of cheddar cheese. I'd probably omit the parm and garlic altogether next time.

Very tasty! I would season the potatoes before putting them in the muffin tin, or layer the sauce in between. I will definitely make again.

I followed recipe exactly. I will probably not make again. But my suggestion for those that want to try it: salt and pepper ( or whatever seasonings you want to use) on each potato layer. They are too bland with just the cheese on top. They are cute coming out in little servings. They need a very saucy meat dish to serve along with it to cover the blandness.

They also reheated nicely...not that that was necessary pretty tasty cold.

These are good.  I made and used extra cheese sauce and I would recommend that.  I think next time I'll salt the potatoes before putting them in the muffin tins.  The outsides of the cakes were awesome but the insides were a little under seasoned.  Otherwise really yummy.  Leftovers are good for breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious. The sauce was super easy to make. I shredded the potatoes like a reviewer advised, and I wished that I would have just sliced the potatoes. The shredded potatoes turned purple and looked weird. Next time, I would also make more sauce. I needed a little more to cover the last two muffins. I will definitely make this again and follow the recipe with more sauce. Super simple too.

Made them for Thanksgiving. So good. The only thing my daughter and I thought would be a good addition, would be to do a short brine of the potato slices while the sauce is being prepared. Although I salted the potatoes after I put them in the muffin tin (after thought). I had the slices sitting in water anyway while I was doing prep and sauce making. Loved the recipe idea. Thanks!

I made these for Christmas dinner and they looked terrible. The potato slices stuck to the tin making it hard to get the out. What I did get out tasted great despite their appearance. Might make this again not in the muffin tin.

This is such a good recipe because everyone gets crispy edges, which is what everyone is actually trying to get when they look at a pan of au gratin potatoes. This was an awesome surprise for my wife who was out while I was cooking dinner and it fit the bill for a side that we needed to go with our steak dinner that was absolutely, totally, absolutely, perfect.

Just made these for an after school snack for my kids- FANTASTIC! As suggested, I covered for half the time then added shredded cheddar cheese and bacon crumbles and popped back in the oven. Also as suggested I did half potatoes on bottom, sauce then rest of potatoes. I did slice the potatoes but they still needed cut to fit in the muffin tin.  To quote my 'particular' 12 year old eater, "Mom, this is a make-again recipe!" Thanks!

The taste was good, but the potatoes stuck to the bottom.  I sprayed the muffin tins generously.  I did make some changes.  I substituted almond milk and cheddar cheese.  I probably won’t make it again because of the sticking.

I like the control of portion size. Good recipe as is but, I added sautéed onions into the roux and also smoked cheddar. I baked in ramekin then turned out on plate for a bit fancier presentation.

Really great taste and easy to make. I love the idea of au gratin potatoes done in 25 minutes. I layered potatoes then sauce, potatoes and more sauce. Then added a bit more shredded cheese. I used a combination of fresh parmesan and extra sharp cheddar. Everyone loved them. Only change I would make is maybe add a bit more milk as the sauce was very thick and difficult to portion to each muffin tin. 10 stars for taste and ease!

I love these, very easy, very tasty and nice to make extras for another meal.  I sometimes use a flour and almond milk mixture for the gravy like white sauces and eliminate the butter.  Makes it better for weight watchers and is still yummy.

I ended up taking it out and putting it in a baking dish because the potatoes don't fit in a muffin tin. Baking now the sauce is very good!

In order to get the potatoes thin enough so they will cook through,  use a grater; you won't be able to get them thin enough slicing with a knife.  I also added an extra 3/4 cup milk to the sauce because I could tell it wasn't going to be enough to cover all 12 muffin cups.  Still turned out delicious & flavorful.  Add extra cheese atop just before serving, if desired.

The only reasons I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because this does not make nearly enough sauce. I made fifty percent more & it still wasn't quite enough. The other reason is because I had to keep adding more milk. A bit too thick as is in my opinion. I layered the potatoes, salt & pepper & sauce as recommended. Glad I did! After reading other reviews I decided to add a small amount of chopped green onion & sprinkle top with a little shredded cheddar. These were delicious. Next time, I will go for a little more of a decadent flavor & add gruyere or asiago to the parmesan.

Good flavor but should be noted as serving only six.  Or call it a diet recipe.  I should have known - two potatoes for twelve servings?

Omg what an amazing recipe! Thanks for sharing! I followed it to the letter, and they came out perfect. I was a little worried there might not be enough roux, but it was just the right amount.  I might top with dried herbs like thyme,  or dill next time. I paired it with the Baked Salmon II recipe,  and a light salad.  It's great if you're on weight watchers. I did the math.  It's only 4SP per!

AMAZING! The whole family loved these...boys ages 3, 6, 9 and a husband! I ate 2 and had to seriously hold myself back from having more! My family of 5 ate 8 of the 12, which is great if you want a little bit of leftovers. I did a half turn grind over each cup with my salt and pepper grinder. It was the perfect amount for us. Also noteworthy, I used a gluten free flour blend in place of wheat flour and it was a tad thick before spooning over. I thinned it a little with a couple tbsp of milk. Baked up perfectly. Will definitely make this again. So quick and so easy.

I baked this as a casserole which takes a much longer time to cook, about 45 minutes, but is easier than loading up the cups. It doesn't look as nice but it is delicious.  It was for dinner party of 12 and they practically licked the pans clean.

I did make changes.  I found the sauce was  very thick so added about a 1/3 cup of sour creme.  I definitely would use less garlic next time found the garlic to be a little overpowering.  I also used Romano cheese in place of  Parmesan.  It is a keeper with those slight changes.

I took this to a potluck dinner party and every one disappeared.

We actually thinned down the sauce so that it filled the cups better.  When layering in the potatoes make sure the slices are smaller than the cup or it creates a seal and the cheese sauce doesn't fill around the potatoes.

We also doubles the cheese and the milk, we wanted a cheesier flavor.

Definitely a keeper.  In fact I will be using this recipe even for the more traditional baking pan version.

These were phenomenal!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and can't think of anything I would do to make it better.  The only thing that I would say is to make sure you bake until browned.  The browned parts are what make it great!  This can be paired with hamburgers or with a fancy holiday dinner.  AND it is so easy!!!!

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  It's basically potatoes in an Alfredo sauce.  I made it just like the recipe called for except I did have to add a little extra milk at the end.  The flour thickened the sauce up faster than I expected.  I cut the potatoes 1/4" thick and layered it with the sauce, ending with sauce.   I cooked it at the recommended temp for 25 -27 minutes.  I placed it on the rack just below the middle of the oven, uncovered, and it turned out perfectly browned on top.  This would be great if you needed portion control when serving a crowd.  They held together well, too.  This is a great recipe that you can change up however you want.  Everyone loved it so I will definitely be making it again!

I made half a batch (only had one potato) and substituted a starch mix for the wheat flour and topped each with a little shredded cheddar.   Very tasty and nice snack size...plan to make them again.

The only thing I did differently was add a little minced onion. Turned out fantastic. My family said it was the best potato dish they’ve ever had. This will be making an appearance on Easter, alongside our beef brisket. Thanks for the recipe!

These were so easy and super good. My wife loved them, my two year old loved them, and I loved them. I took advice from others and layered in the cheese sauce. I would consider upping the sauce a smidge. I nearly ran out. I also topped with parm and cheddar with a few minutes left baking. Great great great.

These came together fairly easily and where pretty good! I followed the recipe as is, except for adding some additional sharp cheddar cheese since I had it on hand.  I also did add an additional 5 minutes to the cooking time since they didn’t look very brown on top after 25.  I do think I still prefer baking it in the casserole dish rather than muffin tins but would make a good app for a party!

These were really tasty! I used a bit of Borsin cheese in place of the parmesan, and had to cook them closer to 40 minutes to be fork tender. Leftovers were tasty for lunch today with a bit of sour cream on top. Will make again.

I followed the directions except for shredding the potatoes (so that it would be done in 25mins.) and sprinkling a little dried chive on each cup.  Came out great and we ate them all the first night!  Next time, I will try what others have suggested and mix the potatoes in the cheese pot before putting them in the cups.

Wonderful "different" potato! I made for dinner first, but this would be impressive for company.  I used a whole cup of milk plus a couple tablespoons when making roux. I also used a good flavorful Pinconning sharp cheese in place of parmesan, and I only had red skinned potatoes. I did layer ingredients twice. Filled 8 of the cups and baked 330 degree oven (the meat I was cooking was that temp) for 40 minutes, then broiled for a few minutes to brown.  OMG... amazing! I still have the taste in my mouth 1/2 hour later.  Can't wait for leftovers....

Nice little recipe!  I used 1 cup milk, I like rounded measurements! I used the 2 potatoes and I weighed it so next time I can be sure of the same amt of potatoes, as all potatoes are different sizes. It weighed 3/4 lb and instead of filling all 12 wells in pan, I filled only 7 bc I didn't want them too skimpy. They cooked in less than 30 mins still.  Nice brown spots on top and just the right size. Of the 7, I ate 2 and my husband ate the rest.  I am going to make it again for a bday dinner I am making for my son and his family next week.  I will add one more potato and more béchamel sauce. It will be just right for 5 people.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, however my two potatoes ended up equaling 24 things of potato gratin instead of 12. I put salt and pepper on each layer of potato, and I also used almond milk instead of regular milk for the sauce. It came out really delicious. I had to stop myself from eating more.

The flavor was really good. I got the sauce a little too thick before adding it to the potatoes (my mistake). I'm not sure I gained anything by making small portions instead of one large dish, but it was good and I will make it again.

The recipe turned out really well. The only thing that I'd like to add is that since I was using tiny muffin tins, I only needed to use one medium potato for 12 servings instead of two large potatoes like it says. Thank you for the recipe! :)

These are so delicious and they look nice too! Very easy to make.  I didn't think 2 potatoes would be enough for my family dinner but there was plenty. I made it with GF flour due to a couple of GF sensitive family members. I will definitely make these again and again!

You need to cook  the potato muffins about 35 minutes, not 25 minutes.  Also, just before baking, sprinkle some Kosher salt on the top of each muffin.  The recipe did not specify a specific amount of salt for the sauce/roux, so I just put in a couple of pinches.  This was not  enough. 
I had to thin the roux and cheese mixture with water as it was too thick.  I layedr each muffin with (starting at the bottom) 2 slices of potatoes (by a mandolin), 1T sauce, 2 slices of potatoes and 1 T Sauce. It worked out just fine. I recommend putting aluminum foil in each muffin pan to help getting the potato au gratin out of the pan.  Big Dick.

These were great! I made the according to the recipe, with only a couple minor changes. One, I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of chopped onions to the cheese sauce. Two, I used half the amount of potatoes. When I assembled them I did put some of the cheese sauce in between the layers of potatoes. They were perfect with grilled rib eye steaks, mushrooms and onions. I will most definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were easy to make but, I thought, lacked flavor even though I followed the recipe exactly. Not sure what to change.

I followed the recipe,  with the exception of using cheddar cheese instead of parmesan  -
 since that was what I had "on hand".   I roughly halved the ingredients,  as I live alone, and was very happy with the results:   crispy,  tasty and  simple to make.  The "Muffin tin"  size is a great idea ,  and not  really too fiddly;    very practical,  especially for a single person.
Yes, I shall certainly be making them again.

I made a few tweeks to the recipe. First, I used shredded mozzarella cheese.  I think you could use any shredded cheese that you like.  Then, because it was a white sauce, I grated a small amt of nutmeg. The nutmeg makes the white sauce "pop".

I made this with a few changes and it was delicious.  I used heavy cream instead of milk and Gruyere instead of Parmesan cheese.  I sliced the potatoes on a mandolin paper thin and the potatoes came out like potato chips.  Just delicious.  I'll make this again for sure.

These went over very well at Easter brunch, an original twist on an old favorite standby. Even my husband -- who does not like potatoes unless they are crispy -- raved about them and said I should definitely make them again. Other guests enjoyed them as well, having seconds (and thirds). Just be aware they are very garlicky.

We made this for Easter and everyone loved it. As suggested by others, we sauteed minced onion and used it in the sauce. Next time, we will make extra sauce as we didn't have enough for the top layer (we used a bunch in the middle).

I thought these were delicious!  I added onion, prior to adding the garlic in the butter, let them cook a bit, then added the garlic for one minute, then the flour.  The cheese sauce turned out yummy, but thick, so in the future, I would do like another reviewer and layer the sauce and potatoes, as the ones in the bottom did not get sauced.  I love how quickly these cooked!

Doubled the sauce,  I also added bacon, onion and dill.  Delicious.  Used my food processor to slice potatoes.  Can be prepared a couple hours before needed.

I made this side dish for my large family for Easter Bunch & it was a hit! I followed the recipe with the exception to the type of cheese & the amount. I used Gruyere instead of  parmesan & might have added a bit more than the recipe called for.  I will plan to make this dish again & may continue to tweek the recipe a bit.

We enjoyed the flavor & portions of this recipe. Based on feedback from others (and the hubs preference), I reduced the garlic to one teaspoon. I also diced the potatoes with the skin on. I used a mixture of Parmesan- reggiano cheese with a bit of sharp cheddar for more flavor. I didn't layer, because I wanted to make sure the cheese sauce coated the potatoes, so I mixed it together with the potatoes, seasoned salt & pepper. Unfortunately it didn't come out of the muffin tin as a stand alone/holdable bit but more of a glop. I'll try cooking it longer & maybe decreasing the milk a little the next time.

We snipped on a few fresh chives and the looked like flower surrounding the Easter ham.  The family loved them!  They'd be perfect for a buffet, baked in foil cupcake cups.

Excellent for portion control, and it works exactly as written.

Also made it using almond milk and have tried different cheeses. The basic recipe works even then.

This was a big hit and I will make it again. I did layer the potatoes and added cheddar cheese to each layer. It definately needs more sauce though, which is the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars.

These are fantastic!  Added a few drops of hot sauce and a smidge of onion powder to the béchamel before baking.  Cannot wait to try with additions of bacon, spinach, mushrooms, diced onion - the sky is the limit!  We loved how easy these were and how tidy the presentation was. Thanks for the recipe!

These are addictive! I made them gluten free by changing the flour to sweet rice flour instead. otherwise followed exact recipe. The garlic was a little overpowering but I may have used bigger cloves. Thank you for the great idea. I love them. I'm going to try reheating to see if they can be used next day. Thinking about taking them to Easter Brunch.

These potatoes turned out really well.  I think next time I'll make a little more sauce for them and cut the potatoes in half before slicing to make smaller thinner pieces to fit in the cups.

Very good.  My sauce was so thick that I did add more milk to each muffin tin for more moisture.  I will use this recipe again but put it in a casserole dish instead.

I have found that in making a white sauce, heating the milk ahead helps the mixing in of flour and milk, making a smoother sauce.

This was absolutely delicious. My husband loved them. The only thing I did differently was follow another reviewers advice about layering half the potatoes, adding a dollop of the sauce then layering the remaining potatoes and sauce. The next time I make them, and there will be a next time, I will probably add a little bit more S&P and maybe a touch of nutmeg.
