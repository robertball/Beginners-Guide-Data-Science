These were super good! My mother usually does not eat pickles, but she loved these. The only change I made was using bread and butter pickles rather than dill.

We liked these! I used sandwich sliced dill pickles, but followed the recipe otherwise. The pretzel crust was a nice change from the traditional breading and gave a nice flavor. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
