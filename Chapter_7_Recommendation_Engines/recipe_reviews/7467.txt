This was better than I expected. I wound up substancially modifying the recipe, but it was fabulous anyway. I wanted the tiramisu to be edible for all my dinner guests, including a pregnant woman. I cut the angel food cake into strips to mock ladyfingers, then beat the cream, marscapone, vanilla and sugar until fluffy. I added a fourth cup of strongly brewed decaf coffee to the marscapone mixture, and whipped it again. I then alternated layers of angelfood fingers, the marscapone mixture, and cinnamon sprinklings, topping it off with the last of the marscapone mix and cinnamon. I chilled for about an hour. This was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe turned out yummy - almost as good as the restaurants' with a few personal adjustments.  I made it with 1/2 c. decaf coffee instead of the coffee liqueur and granules (pregnant women friendly).  I also made it with cream cheese instead mascarpone cheese (couldn't find mascarpone cheese anywhere!).  And it turned out fabulous!  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!!

Wonderful results.  Nice and easy to prepare.  I added additional whipped cream and frosted the top of the cake.  Final step: just before serving I dusted a little cocoa powder over the whipped cream.  I like this recipe because "no" eggs were used.  Results: smooth light taste....not a heavy dessert!

i gotta say, i don't cook and i'm not a baker either. i've never baked anything in my life. i don't know what made me decide to make tiramisu one day. but i'm glad i did cuz it was fabulous!!! everyone said it was like what you'd normally get from a bakery. it was that good! 

i did have to make changes though, the biggest one being the mascarpone cheese. i couldn't find it anywhere so i substituted it with ricotta. also my family does not drink alcohol so i didn't use coffee liquer. to make up for this, i used 6 teaspoons of instant coffee (instead of just 1 tsp) and it was still very good! everyone loved the coffee flavor! i used the cream mixture in between the two layers and also to cover the entire cake, put cocoa powder all over the top, drizzled some almond bark, and used a few strawberries. if i could make this, anyone can!

The simplicity of this recipe encouraged me to try it and wow .. so rich and creamy; it made a lot too. Used 1 mascarpone cheese, and 1 cream cheese. Increased (granulated) sugar to 3/4 cup. I baked and used Creamy White Layers (this site) instead of bought cake ...mmm. Increased instant coffee granules instead of liqueur - delicately scrumptious. I like this eggless tiramisu very much. Thanks Suzanne.

Loved it much more than the "real thing."  Easy to make; tastes light & fresh.  Bake angel food cake the day before.  I made it "trifle style," layering pieces of the cake, cheese mixture & cocoa in a big glass bowl.  Next time I will slice the cake horizontally into 3 or 4 layers, ice each one thickly with the cheese mixture & sprinkle on cocoa, assemble, and slice vertically to serve.  Thanks for this great recipe idea!

This is amazing! My boyfriend made it for me once, and I've been asking for it ever since. It tastes exactly like the real thing, but it's with angel food cake, which is a plus. Such a wonderful, easy recipe.

Great recipe, I added a bit of gelatin to set the filling, but not neccesary.

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  I used espresso mixed with Kahlua  that I added to the cream mixture and also dipped the cake pieces in to soak just slightly.  It was delicious.

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make. 
  I have made this with sponge cake and also a regular golden cake. It was a huge hit either way. 
  I did however substitute the alcohol for espresso gave it a whole other realm of flavor the rest i used per the recipe
