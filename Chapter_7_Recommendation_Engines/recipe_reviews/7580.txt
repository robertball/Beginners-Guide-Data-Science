Not for decorating!!!  And "takes some extra time" is underestimating it.  It took me about 1 1/2 hours to make.  Then when it seemed spreadable, I iced a doll cake for my daughter's birthday party.  The icing went on well, then quickly thickened.  Since I had tinted it pink, it looked EXACTLY like I had made the Barbie's dress with Silly Putty!  It flowed down the sides of the cake, and the effect was awful.  I guess I should remember that great baking rule, do not experiment when it's a special occasion, but I was looking for a good alternative to too sugary buttercream.  Should have just sweetened some whipped cream and had done with it.

I loved this recipe! It was easy enough to make that my 10 yr old & 8 yr old children made it to put on our cake for Jesus' birthday! It was so yummy!!! We added 1/4 tsp. of Orange Extract, and it had the most awesome flavor to it!!! Definitely a recipe to keep!!!

This is basically a recipe for homemade Marshmallow Fluff, with a slightly more spreadable consistency; not what I was expecting.  Not sure if the results are "well worth it."

There is nothing wrong with this recipe. It's a traditional boiled icing recipe which yields the consistency of marshmallow. This should nothing be used for intense decorating, borders, flowers, etc. I like to use this for coconut cakes when I'm not in the mood for buttercream. Thanks for submitting!
