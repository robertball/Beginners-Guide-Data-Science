I make this all the time when I need to eat breakfast in the car! I keep the cream cheese blend in the fridge, smear on toast, and instead of trail mix, use a blend of Total cereal (healthy but icky) dried fruit and whatever nuts I have around. Soooo good! I also blend unflavored protien powder into the cream cheese, makes this a power-packed breakfast!

This recipe was perfect for me. Not only did I have an excess of trail mix but I found a great sale on cream cheese at Grocery Outlet. I cut this in half for just my boys and I used my Pampered Chef hand chopper to get the trail mix and carrots chopped really fine. I did add a tbsp. of honey to make it a little easier to spread and to give it just a touch of sweetness. My kids loved it. I'd so make this again. I think I might make this into stuffed french toast next time! Imagine how good that would be! EDITED: Yes. This makes good stuffed french toast.

I scaled down the recipe for one and followed it as is except adding the lemon zest, but did add some cinnamon and fiber one cereal.   This recipe was made for "going on adventures", but my adventure was only to the kitchen, so I ended up toasting it. This helped warm the cream cheese. Because of the added cinnamon, this sandwich reminded me of eating a Cinnamon raisin bagel. You don't really taste the lemon juice or carrots, but they help give an extra crunch.  Will definitely be making this again!

I didn't have trail mix on hand so I used some leftover nuts from christmas (cashews, almonds, honey roasted peanuts). When I first tried this I thought something was missing, I double checked the recipe and found I forgot the lemon juice! The lemon juice makes everything come together, it tasted a million times better after I added the lemon. I didn't use the full 8oz of cream cheese, I used maybe 5-6oz and thought it was just enough. I also finely grated my carrot but next time ill use a bigger grater because I think bigger shreds of the carrots would have been better. I don't know if ill make this all the time but I will make it again! Thanks for sharing

I skip the lemon zest and use whole wheat bagels - and this recipes is great.  While nothing you would find in a restuarant, we always take this camping or hiking with us.  It is a great change from traditional sandwiches. I use trail mix with fruit. When we go camping I make the mix, store it in tupperware and keep it in the icebox until the day we are going to use it.  Then I just spread it on the bagels.  When we go hiking I wrap it good in saran wrap and foil.  This sandwich doesn't get squished either in between the rest of our hiking stuff - so it is great for that reason too! Definitely give it a try!

The flavor in this recipe was good, but neither I nor my husband could eat more than half a sandwich.  The cream cheese flavor is very strong and very sweet.

The cream cheese was a bit much for me, but my husband liked these pretty well.

Pretty good for a quick lunch. I scaled the recipe down to one, as it was just me. I found that my sandwich tasted a lot better after it sat in the fridge for a couple of hours. I might make again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make this.

I was expecting the rasins not to taste good with everthing else, but they actually tasted good with everything else. I didn't have any lemon zest or juice in the house, but it seemed completely fine without it.

I did not really make the recipe as written, but I used it as inspiration. I took an oatmeal raisin Chewy brand granola bar and crumbled it up into little bits. Mixed that into the cream cheese, added a splash of lemon juice, and that spread was very very tasty on wheat bread. I love things that are sweet and salty at the same time, and I will be making my version again.

These were awful, I think only a few bites were taken and this is what I packed for our lunch at the lake.

I've been making this for a while, very good combination of flavors and so easy to make! This is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or just a snack. I skipped the zest because I don't have a grater, but didn't change anything else. I used the trail mix with the m&m's in it and it turned out great, not too sweet, not too salty. I think next time I'll add some chopped dates.

These were a big hit with our family AND with the people we were camping with...Who thought it sounded so interesting, they had to give it a try.  My husband is allergic to raw nuts, so instead of pre-made trail mix I chopped up dried apricots, some bittersweet chocolate chips, and threw in some sunflower seeds.  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  These will become a staple for our family adventures.  It is also great as a topping for crackers!

My daughter, coworkers and I love it. I used half greek yogurt and half vegan cream cheese instead of cream cheese. Also I added spinach and tomato to the sandwich.
