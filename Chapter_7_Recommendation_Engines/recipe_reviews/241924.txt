I made a variation of this for a low carb diet. I intended to add the spinach but ended up leaving it out so we will add that next time. We used 2 packages of thin bacon, 1 can black olives, 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, 2+ cups of Tillamook medium cheddar, 12 brown eggs and 3 oz. of crumbled feta. 40 min at 350 ° Top with Darigold sour cream. Easy and delicious :)

I added one additional egg for a full dozen.  I made this with fresh spinach torn into pieces - about 2/3 of a bag.  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and also added 2 cubes of frozen minced garlic and 2 cubes of frozen minced basil.    The basil added great flavor!

This is a good start but as written it lacks flavor.  I believe it needs a full tsp of oregano, some garlic, S&P and some minced onions to reach its full potential.  Thanks, Lauren

Great base recipe. I disagree with those who say it needs salt, as I added salt to the egg mixture and felt that it was a little too salty. I used fresh spinach and sautéed it in a little garlic and olive oil before putting it into the casserole. I also sautéed mushrooms in a little butter and threw those in. I minced an onion and sautéed it with the sausage as another reviewer suggested to ensure that there would be enough flavor. I will be making it again!

This was very tasty and easy. I used fresh spinach because that is what I had on hand. I simply tore the leaves and added them to the mixture. Easy and delicious! I also added some garlic powder and cooked a little onion with the sausage. This is a great basic recipe that allows all kinds of add ons. I am thinking mushrooms would be good too!

Ok. I added to it. I added spinach and some mushrooms. The sausage I used was a hot Italian sausage. I did not need to used that much oregano. So only use a 1 teaspoon. If you are going to use hot sausage.

I’ve made this at least 6 times. Great recipe my family loves! Like others, I make it 12 eggs. I’ve used regular milk or unsweetened almond milk as well as venison sausage!

I used about 5-6oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen after making it with frozen and it was better!! I also used a large carton of eggs beaters seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, oregano and celery salt. These changes were after I had made it according to the recipe. It just needed more flavor in my opinion. Either way, it's a great recipe!! I recommend NOT using egg beaters. Use regular eggs!!

I made it at home for a trial run and the family enjoyed it.  I went on a ski vacation and offered to cook breakfast and surprise instead of four people it was 11.  I only had one package of sausage but I doubled all the other ingredients and it came out great.   Any leftovers were gone by lunch.

I have made this several times. I use fresh spinach and have also substituted crumbled bacon for the sausage. Great to warm up in the microwave on a busy morning before leaving for work.

We usually eat this for dinner. The only change I made was substituting the sausage with pre-cooked smoked sausage that I slice up. Then you can add it all together at once, and dirty only one pan. Everything else was made as is and was very good!

I used fresh spinach - 8 oz bag, added 1 yellow onion, 1 green bell pepper and 2 garlic cloves.  

Next time, I would top the casserole off with the cheese instead of including it in the mix.  As well as use 1/2 bag (4 oz) of spinach.  Too much spinach for me.  Possibly add black olives too.

I used 12 eggs, Italian sausage, 2 cups mozzarella, 1 lb frozen spinach cook for 50 min @350. Delish!! (Low carb- no milk, I didn’t drain the spinach)

added salt and pepper to the egg mixture, and cut the recipe in half as it was just for my son and I the first time around.  leftovers for each!  I will definitely make this again for our upcoming annual mother's day brunch, but I will probably add Italian seasoning, not just oregano.  felt like it needed just a touch more seasoning.

I was very happy with this recipe! Though I did add tomatoes and extra seasoning. I also put in 12 eggs instead of 11. It turned out a little juicy from the tomatoes but cooked nicely and it was good. I will probably be making this recipe again. I was happy about the number of ingredients being so low!

I will be adding this to the rotation. I took some suggestions added green onions & mushrooms garlic powder & diced up Roma tomatoes and garnished with them.  Really just add what you like . I made sure to sauté the veggies first so it does not get watery & squeeze the heck out of the spinach

Made this breakfast casserole for New Years Day brunch. I used brown and serve breakfast turkey sausage links. Thawed them and then chopped up and browned. Used regular cheddar cheese but will try  next time with sharp cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it!

Made this for New Year’s Day breakfast- everyone loved it!!  Made recipe exactly as written +1 additional egg and using ground  Italian sausage (not sure if that is different than breakfast sausage?)  — perfect ratios of ingredients and not too cheesy like some.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I used fresh spinach and threw a can of diced tomatoes just for color.  And I had a left over chopped onion.  The only sausage I had was maple flavored but in it went.  This was really really good.  Helped inch our way closer to pay day for sure.  Thank you for such an easy recipe.  I will be making this again

I'll make this casserole on Sunday and breakfast is covered for the rest of the week.  This is a fairly easy recipe to customize for your specific taste - there's a few things I differently:  (1) chop up 1/2 onion and sautee in the sausage drippings with a tsp of minced garlic; (2) add some rosemary to the sausage while it browns.  You can also play with the ratios to make it more spinach-y, meaty, or egg-y.

Great Recipe. I substituted hot breakfast sausage and used fresh spinach. My family loved it! Will definitely make again and use this as a base recipe. Thanks Loren

great basic recipe. I added an onion and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Fried the sausage, onion together and added the spinach at the end to cook it down. I then added 3 more eggs since I added more guts to the dish. It turned out great.

simple and easy for a low carb meal!  I added some feta cheese and a can of diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion for a bit more flavor.  I also used fresh spinach torn in pieces and a dozen eggs.  Yummy!

This is my favorite and only egg casserole I make. I use a full dozen eggs, and add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. And my kids love it too. Perfection.

I love this recipe. It seems more balanced with about half as much sausage. Also I halved the recipe for my family, and it works best to use 6 eggs when halving it. I used torn up fresh spinach because that's what I had on hand and it worked well.

We’ve used this recipe many times, frequently making substitutions and additions. Our favorite version has diced ham instead of sausage and fresh diced mushrooms.

This was a winner with my family! I wasn't sure with the spinach, but they almost ate the whole thing!! I decreased the oregano and next time I might delete it all together. Other than that I followed the recipe completely.

I made this as written for a potluck, and many people went back for seconds.  Someone told me it was the best quiche they ever had.  I’m making it again for Home to have as breakfast this week for my low carb diet.  It’s delicious!

I made these for my husband for his weekly meal prep. I used fresh spinach and forgot the oregano. I'm not a huge egg person so I didn't try it but he liked it. I think these will be a new thing I add to his weekly meal prep meals rotation.

This was delicious! I used "medium" sausage, heavy cream instead of milk and added a diced red pepper. Not sure I would change a thing....

This was a delicious breakfast for Christmas morning. The oregano was a unique touch for a breakfast casserole. I’m trying to do Keto so I ran some numbers. For 8 servings, there are 384 calories, 4 grams carbs, 27 grams fat, and 30 grams protein.

Super yummy & cooked perfectly! My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I didn't have sharp cheddar cheese & thought it might be a bit bland with the mild cheddar I had, so I added some pepper & Lawry's seasoning salt.  Flavor was great!  Also substituted frozen kale for the frozen spinach.

This was wonderful!!  Everybody at the church potluck loved it.  The only changes I made were to use the whole dozen eggs and 16 ounces of spinach.
