I live in NJ and the cheese is carried in Wegmans and Shop Rite.  BelGioioso is one manufacturer. Good Mozzarella or Burrata can be substituted.  It is excellent.

For those who complain about the quarter sheet pan, they aren't hard to find.  They are 13 x 9.  You probably have one and didn't know it.  For those who complain about his sing-song voice, please use a different recipe site.  I get enough rudeness and meanness on other web sites, and I'd rather not hear compliant about something so insignificant on a site that's meant to be helpful and fun.  Finally, I gave this 4 stars and not 5 because of the cheese selection.  The author is lucky to have such a variety available in his area, and I will look for it.  But it's best to offer a more readily available substitute.

I love Chef John and almost all of his recipes that I've tried so far.  His voice is NOT annoying, and the half sheet pan I have works fine.

Ths recipe had me at arugula as I love the cheese, crust & arugula combo.  I am not a good dough person, so I followed the recipe as written to the T.  The video was helpful. I do not have access to a mixer, so my dough was done by hand.  Also, I am somewhere with limited cheese stocks, so I used fresh mozarella.  That being said, this came together very easily and worth the minor work.  Nice flavor and a nice Saturday night repast with a glass of red.

In the future, the thinner the dough, the better.  Patience and perhaps a warmer time of year, as the dough is more elastic with warmth.  I am already planning for different flavor combos in future uses of this recipe.  But, overall it is a good base recipe.  If you do not have a half sheet, a small cookie sheet should work.

Fun, easy, and versatile.  Out of necessity used fontina cheese.  Turned out great.  Will definitely make this frequently.

Made this recipe today.  Amazing! So good!  I found the suggested cheese at Whole Foods (brand was BelGioioso), so if you have one in your area, check it out.  I also Googled crescenza-stracchino cheese and found a couple of substitutions if you can't find the suggested recipe cheese.  The cheeses are Taleggio and Teleme.  Flatbread came out looking just like the picture, blistered and crisp and was delicious with the added arugula.  My only addition to the recipe was to add 1 teaspoon Italian herbs to the flour before mixing, which added nice flavor.  I will definitely make this flatbread again.

This was a terrific recipe!  I'm not very good working with dough, yet I found this to be a very forgiving dough (stretches easily & easy to work with).  I used the cheese I had on hand (ricotta & fresh mozz) but will try again with something tastier.  I used a cookie sheet & needed to use all the dough to cover it.  Hubby and I ate it with the arugula and thought it was delicious.  My daughter ate it plain, loved it, and even rewarmed the leftovers for breakfast.  I love Chef John - his recipes are straightforward & videos very amusing.  More than once I've laughed out loud at his jokes :) don't listen to the haters.

Fantastic!!  Don't let the technique deter you from making this (or if you don't have the right cheese).  It's easier than it looks (the video is extremely helpful) and the dough is very forgiving and easy to work with. I used goat cheese since I live in a  small town with limited options.  I didn't have a 1/4 sheet pan, so I used the small, rimmed cookie sheet  (8"x9") that came with my toaster oven (I halved the recipe and it still made two separate, small pans worth of bread ).  It worked beautifully.  It was a cheesy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I added lemon juice to the greens and topped the greens with smoked salmon.  It was excellent and my husband says it's a keeper.  I agree and will get a 1/4 sheet pan for the next time!  Thanks, John, for another amazing recipe.

Delicious and not as complicated as it seems.  This dough is very easy to work with and I had no trouble getting it stretched extremely thin.  I made it with the recommended cheese and rolled out the extra dough trimmings for a small third focaccia filled with grated  fontina and torn prosciutto.  Served with eggplant caponata.

Really liked the recipe and it is easy but wouldn't use specified cheese. It is too liquidy. Instead I will use thinly sliced fontina or thinly sliced mozzarella (smoked) patted dry. Also used 1/2 tsp King Arthur Flour in dough.

So good!  It is quite difficult to stretch the dough thin enough without a corner or two tearing or slipping off the edge of the pan.  Fortunately, patching works reasonably well.  I wonder if a circular pan would be easier.  Could not find the recommended cheeses anywhere, so I used half a container of Mascarpone cheese instead.  I had no cornmeal so I used some almond flour on the pan instead since it seemed kind of gritty.  I also had to cook a few minutes longer.  Thanks Chef John!
