This is one of my favorite recipes from this site - here's how I make it: Cut the pasta amount in half and use rigatoni or penne as this heavy sauce needs a sturdier base than spaghetti. Omit the green onions and throw some minced garlic, freshly ground black pepper and diced onion in with the ground beef. Stir the cheese mixture into the cooked noodles and place in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with the sauce. Cover and bake for 20 minutes, uncover and top with the cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes more or until the cheese is bubbly. This makes a ton of seriously yummy comfort food. Everyone loves it!

This is the only way I make spaghetti...ever!  My favorite part is the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Update: I have made this many, many times and have finally perfected this wonderful recipe; I use 1.5 jars of sauce, I mix my cooked noodles with butter and lots of parmesan before putting in the pan, and finally I added about 1/2 cup of ricotta to the cream cheese/sour cream.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I buttered the spaghetti a bit before layering in the pan and I used a jar of Newman's Sausage and Peppers sauce along with 1/2 a jar of Ragu-  it could have used more sauce so I would use two whole jars next time.  I also combined some ricotta cheese with the cream cheese mixture.  We all loved it!  I might skip the cheddar cheese next time and replace it with mozzerella.  You could also scale down the pasta a bit if you don't have a full pound and it would work fine...the pound of spaghetti really filled the pyrex.  This will be something I make at least once a month-  it makes a ton and I always appreciate left overs so I don't have to cook every day.  Thanks for sharing a great pasta dish.

I can't wait for lunch to have the leftovers!!! What a delicious hearty meal; so easy and so wonderful! I omitted both the green peppers and green onions and used Bertolli Organic Tomato Basil Sauce--YUM~O! I sautéed half a sweet onion in butter until translucent in the same pan browned up quality lean ground beef, seasoned to taste. Tossed thin spaghetti noodles w/ butter and parmesan cheese as suggested by Khristin (no dry noodles like others). Added 1/2 cup of low-fat ricotta cheese and substituted a combo of cheddar/jack and mozzarella for the cheddar cheese. After dinner I couldn’t stop eating little bites from the casserole dish. Will be making this again soon! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

Thank you for this recipe. I made it today for my husband who was coming home for a day from trucking. He raved and raved. But as usual I used it as a skeleton and changed the following...
1. I didn't measure out the sour cream and cream cheese exactly. I just blended a medium container of SC and 8 oz of CC. Much easier! 
2. I used the 1 lb of spaghettie and added some broken pieces of lassagna I had.
3. I used 1 lb ground chuck AND 1 lb. roll of sage flavored sausage. I fried it together throwing in the green pepper and 4 cloves of garlic. I also used lots of spices to heat it up like cumin, oregano, garlic salt, seasoned pepper, pepper corn ? (like used at pizza hut to sprinkle on) and minced onion.
4. I bought 8 oz mozzarella and 8 oz sharp chedder and used all but 2 oz from each. 
It was delicious!! Since I baked it in a 14x11 pan, there were leftovers of the noodles and meatsauce. There was no extra sour adn cream cheese. I added the noodles to the sauce and froze for spaghetti later. I bagged and froze the leftover pie too.

My husband and I are giving this 4 stars. It was amazing...but the noodles making up the bottom layer really dried up when it went into the oven.  We followed the recipe to heart, but for future attempts, we suggest mixing the meat and noodles together so it dosen't dry up as bad, adding the sour cream/chive/cream cheese on the top and then the cheese.  We will do this again!! One of my personal favorites omitting the dry noodles. 

Thank you!
Crystal T.

This is a good recipe, but I tweak it a bit.  I make my own sauce, and instead of spreading the cream cheese and sour cream over the spaghetti, I mix it in with the noodles.  I've also found that mozzarella cheese is preferred by my family.  But it's a good base recipe to work from.

This was a really good recipe! I did tweak it just a little though. I mixed in some melted butter (about 1/4 cup), 1 egg, and some paremesean cheese into the noodles before putting them in the pan. I also used the full 8oz pkg of cream chz instead of the 4oz it called for. I did not have any green onions, so I mixed in some italian seasoning with my crm chz and sour cream. Sooooo good! My hubby & kids raved about this one!

This was tasty!  And fairly easy, too, although there were more dishes to wash than I like.  I omitted the green pepper (personal preference), reduced the spaghetti to approx. 3/4 lb, and increased sauce by about another 1/4 jar.  I like very saucy noodles, and found that ratio to be perfect.  I loved the sour cream and cream cheese.  In the future, I may take a few short cuts and use prepared meat sauce (rather than browning meat and simmering) and chive cream cheese (rather than cutting green onions).  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My family just LOVES this.  I use about half the spaghetti and a red pepper instead of a green, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  We love it every time!  Thanks!

Yummy! I ate a whole plateful!! Only minor changes based on reviews and what my guys like.  I added smoked sausage with the beef and 2 cans of sauce.  I added a little grated parmesan to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and mixed directly with noodles.  I also layered mine, putting half the pasta on the bottom, then half the sauce, a little cheddar, then the other half of the pasta, sauce, then the remaining cheddar (I used less cheddar cause it was extra sharp- great for dieters who still want cheese).  Baked according to directions and it was great! Will definitely make again because plain spaghetti gets so boring!

This was delicious!!! I doubled the cream cheese, sour cream, and green onion because I just didn't feel like it was spreading around to an amount that I would be able to taste real well. This is a great, quick, and easy recipe!

Oh my, this may be the best recipe I've gotten off of allrecipes.com! I made it today for out of town guests and they all raved about it (including my friend's 7 year old daughter). It was so easy to put together, I'd recommend this dish anytime you have to feed 6-8 people and don't want to be chained to the kitchen for hours. Like others, I made changes, but I think the secrets are to use really good pasta sauce and reducing the cheddar cheese  by adding an equal amount of Italian blend shredded cheese. My guest commented immediately the about the cheese.

For the sauce, I used a high-end brand of tomato-basil sauce. Look for any brand that doesn't have preservatives or ingredients that you can't pronounce. I used ~36 ounces of sauce and a little less pasta (~14 oz.). Even using a good sauce, TASTE it as you are cooking to see if the flavor is to your liking. I added additional basil, rosemary and a little bit of red pepper flakes, but this all depends upon your palate.

Also, I added 1/3 of a cup of ricotta cheese to the sour cream/cream cheese blend and used chive cream cheese instead of chopping green onions. Instead of cooking spray, I mixed butter into the hot pasta to keep it from sticking.

I about had a heart attack when I couldn't find this recipe in my recipe box!!! Thank God I found it again..
The only thing I do different is use 2 jars of sauce and use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. I also add the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and half the sauce mixture to the noodles and then put in the pan then top with the rest of the sauce and mozzarella cheese. This is the BEST!!!!

Great recipe, Chubs! a very good diversion from the normal ground beef/pasta casserole. Thanks!
I used homemade marinara instead of bottles. As per some of the reviews, I added mixed sour cream mixture into the cooked spaghetti before putting it into the baking dish to help keep the spaghetti moist during the baking. I also broke the dry spaghetti in half before boiling it to allow for easier and more even dispersion in the baking dish. I used all of the ingredients in the amounts specified and it was really quite good. The marinara gave it a great Italian flair, but the cheddar cheese kind of mitigated that. Next time I will substitute a Provolone/Parmesan mix and see how that goes. I served it with Italian seasoned toast points and a tossed salad with a lemon vinaigrette.

First of all, let me say that my picky family LOVED this!  Ages 2, 4, 15 and 42 - they all wanted more!  I truly didn't expect they would as they are so picky, I didn't think they'd even touch it since it was different.  Made it pretty much to the recipe.  Used red pepper instead of green (what I had on hand, and personal preference), added a good sized dollop more of sour cream because I was worried it would be dry, based on previous reviews.  It was perfect.  Love the sour cream/cream cheese combo.  Second time I made it, I forgot to blend in the onions.  Tossed them on top of the white mixture, and then topped with meat sauce.  Didn't matter it wasn't blended in.  Will be making this again and again.  It's always good to find something everyone loves.  Great next day for leftovers. Excellent for make ahead and bake next day. Takes longer than just making spaghetti, but well worth the wait.  Enjoy!

I loved this because I could make it lower fat and it still tasted great.  I  added diced onion, 2 cloves minced garlic and sauteed with the green pepper, then added and browned the ground turkey I used instead of ground beef.  Left out the garlic powder.  Used low fat sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and tossed it with some olive oil then layered as directed.  This was enjoyed by all!

I had high hopes as this got great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It is edible, but my entire family thought it was too bland. Just boring. Won't be making this one again.

We love this! Very easily and cheaply made, wholesome, filling and flavorful. We left out the green pepper and onion because we don't like them but followed everything else to a T, and it was delicious! Making again tonight!

Yummy!  Be sure to use plenty of sauce, otherwise it ends up a little too dry.

I switched this up a bit. I left out the sour cream and mixed a brick of cream cheese in with the noodles. I also made my own spaghetti sauce and used chihuahua cheese (a super good creamy cheese) for the topping. I loved it!

Been making for years, don't know why I haven't reviewed til now.  Perfect as is.  Sometimes I mix all the items together and sometimes I layer.  Depends how much time I have.  Good either way.

This was SO good and really easy to make. I've seen Spaghetti Pie in delis and hot food sections and have always wished I could figure out how to make it.  Well this was way better than those.  I'll never make regular spaghetti again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Used less than a full box of pasta (maybe 3/4 or less and could have used even less) and I would NOT use penne or rigatoni like the first review recommends -- it will end up baked ziti that way and won't slice beautifully the way the spaghetti does. Used a 32 oz jar of sauce but still needed 1/3 of another.  Sauteed the onion with some fresh rosemary (rosemary took this to a whole new level). I took another reviewer's advice and mixed the hot spaghetti noodles  with butter and parmesan cheese in still hot pot on the stove. Then I  tossed in the sour cream and cream cheese and cooked it on medium heat until everything was melted and mixed well. I put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan and then added the noodles and then the bulk of the sauce on top. Covered the top of this with mozz cheese. It actually holds it shape (doubt penne or rigatoni would) and sliced into squares right away. This would be great to feed a crowd because it easily slices. It's very heavy & filling. I hate to even THINK about how horrible this is for you with all that cream cheese, sour cream, butter, parm and pasta. Yeesh... but it was good & will be better tomorrow in my husband's lunch. Don't make it too often! Tons left over.

This dish was super easy to make. I used a whole block of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream and mixed it right in with the pasta. This is super delicious!

This was really good. Passed the husband and mother-in-law test.  I added a little water to thin the sauce.

Love it, love it, love it!!  After making this recipe many times I have come to the conclusion that  adding an extra cup of pasta sauce keeps this casserole moist in the oven and helps when reheating for leftovers.  Also, stir in a tablespoon of butter to cooked noodles before adding to baking dish.  Keeps the noddles from getting sticky.  Our whole family loves this recipe!!!!

Although this certainly not gourmet, it is a nice easy dish that can be made ahead of time. My kids loved this, and i was thrilled that my son liked it as he had given up on pasta with red sauce. I seasoned my sauce with lots of oregano, fresh garlic, italian seasoning.  The only change i made, was that i didnt add the green onion. Served it with ceasar salad and garlic bread and it was a hit. I will make this again for sure.

I have made this recipe three times.  No one in my household likes bell peppers or onions, so I omitted those every time.  The first time I was in a hurry and I kind of just threw it together but it ended up turning out great even though I put the cream cheese mixture on top (versus the sauce) and didn't cover it.  The second time I followed it exactly except I didn't have any beef (and no onions or peppers) and no one really liked it (I don't eat beef so I make half with/half without, and it still tasted different from the first time).  So last night, I made it for a third time and finalized what makes this recipe great.  I use a whole 8 ounces of cream cheese versus the "half of 8 ounces" suggested in the ingredients.  I also use more sauce and mix it in with the noodles to make sure they are coated.  I also add about a tablespoon of dried basil to the cream cheese mixture.  It's delicious and it's certainly something I will make in the future.

This was just ok.  Needs a lot more sauce than describes.  However, my 3 sons LOVED LOVED this..  So I would say it's a good kid food.

Everyone in my family raved about this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes because of the ingredients that I had on hand.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green because of a personal preference.  I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti.  Lastly, I added a can of "no beans" chili to the jar of spaghetti sauce.  Next time I plan to add fresh garlic slices for additional flavor.  Even the pickiest eater will love this recipe!

I wanted to love this with all the great reviews, but the truth is I just wasn't crazy about it.... mainly the cream cheese/sour cream mix.  I also wanted to do something more with the spaghetti as it dried out a bit, AND I think it needed more sauce... I agree with the reviews who said to halve the pasta but leave the sauce amount the same.. I definitely should have done that... Next time I will, and will also replace the cheese mixture with ricotta.  Thanks for the starter recipe!

I literally just got finished eating this and it is really good.  I did make the following adjustments (although the original recipe is probably wonderful as is. I am bad about measurements since I am a taster. I used ground turkey, added pepperoni, entire package of reduced fat cream cheese, like 2-3 cloves of garlic and a handful of fresh basil and a lot of parmesean to the "white" part and added red pepper flakes, cooking wine and sugar to the sauce (I usually add these to my spaghetti sauce).  I also tossed the pasta with additional parm. cheese and olive oil to the pasta.  I tossed the "white part" with the pasta as well.  I know this sounds like a lot of changes, but this is a really great recipe that can be changed to your liking.

Yummy and worth the extra work. I did take the advise of one of the reviews and blended the sour cream, cream cheese into the penne pasta, also a suggestion from someone, I agree the penne pasta gave this heavier sauce more support. Definitely a keeper recipe and super easy to make

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I added about 4 TBSP of butter and 1/4 Cup of Parmesean Cheese to the noodles before baking to keep them from drying out.  Next time I think I will double the cream cheese portion in the middle, it was my favorite part.  I will also add more sauce and meat.  Less Pasta might work too.

I made this for a large crowd and everyone loved it. Switched out the spaghetti for rigatoni noodles, added some ricotta cheese to the cream cheese and sour cream (omitted the green onions and green peppers) and used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage.  It was delicious!!

YUMMY! I did a little something different w/ the sour cream mixture since I didn't have cream cheese on hand but it still turned out well. I used spinach spaghetti instead of regular noodles. We really liked this and it was easy to make.

Yum!  I followed the suggestion of using penne pasta.  This was delicious...very easy and quick to put together for something so, so good!  We really enjoyed the cream cheese/sour cream mix-I prefer it to a layer of ricotta.  Thanks for sharing a keeper recipe!

Did as another person suggested and mixed the sour cream/cream cheese mixture into the spaghetti.  Also reduced the spaghetti to about 12 ounces.  Added Italian seasoning to the meat mixture and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Kids loved it, I liked it well but next time I'll try adding more seasoning.

LOVED it and so did the family. Made it to the T except omitted bell pepper (because I didn't have any) and I mixed the sour cream/cream cheese mixture into the noodles. EXCELLENT!

I used Penne and mixed the pasta with the cheese mixture. The first time I made the cheese mix as described and it was too much sour cream. The next time I halfed the sourcream and added extra creamcheese. I liked it better the second way.

Yum Yum Yummy....This is an awesome switch from normal spaghetti!! It is definately a keeper & a must have recipe!! I done mostly what BODIE358 suggested --- use rigatoni  as this heavy sauce needs a sturdier base than spaghetti. Omit the green onions and throw some minced garlic, freshly ground black pepper and diced onion in with the ground beef while cooking. Stir the cheese mixture into the cooked noodles and place in the bottom of the greased baking dish. Top with the sauce. Cover and bake for 20 minutes, uncover and top with the cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes more or until the cheese is bubbly My whole family loved this -- thanks for the recipe!!

Very tasty. Changes: After draining the pasta, I beat in 2 eggs and about 1 tbs margarine. Adding the margarine allowed me to skip the cooking spray later.  I used ground turkey, which was great, but I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 tsp dried parsley. This gave the sauce more zip, which I need. I didn't have green bell peppers, so I used red, yellow, and orange instead, which was nice for color.  Since my fiance hates soft cheese, I skipped the cream cheese and just used sour cream mixed with chives and a dash of salt and pepper for that layer. It was great. It was, however, missing the extra moisture from the cc. Next time, I'll double the sour cream.  Lastly, I topped it all with a slice of uncooked bacon cut into pieces. I let it cook for 15 minutes covered and 15-20 mins uncovered to darken the bacon.  It turned out well. Flavorful and hearty. I'd make this again.

Very easy and very good!  Called for all the ingredients I had on hand.  I added about 2 large handfulls of fresh spinach to the cheese mixture which I mixed with the hot pasta and put in the bottom of the dish ... topped with the sauce mixture, cheddar and a little parmesan.  Thank you!

Good starting point but I added sauteed onions, garlic and Montreal Steak Seasoning to my meat before adding the pasta sauce. I also added a can of diced tomatoesit didn't seem like there was enough sauce. I liked the flavor the sour cream and cream cheese gave it.  Good alternative if you don't have Ricotta on hand.  Next time, I may use two jars of sauce.  All in all, it was an easy dish to make and the family liked it.

This meal turned out great! I only gave it 4 stars b/c I thought you could use a little less pasta. Maybe just 3/4 of the box. Great to make ahead of time and have the next day! I would omit the green onions though. Kids did not like them.

I, personally liked this dish. However, my husband didn't like the "white stuff" in it, and once by two boys heard the words "cream cheese and sour cream", they stopped eating, too. My husband suggested using ricotta or cottage cheese. I will probably try that next time.

Thought this turned out really good. We'll be having leftovers tomorrow and freezing the rest. For the jared sauce I used Bertolli, with tomato and basil Mezzetta with porcini, portabella mushrooms and Napa Valley merlot. I mixed one jar of the Bert. with 1/2 of the other. To that I added fresh garlic, onion, bellpepper and rosemery, dried basil, oregano, red pepper, a little bit of sugar and more salt and pepper.  As others suggested I mixed the cheese  with the pasta before adding the sauce on top. I also used some ricotta cheese in the mixture and mozzarella and cheddar on the top. To keep the foil from sticking and cut a piece of parchment paper to put on top, then put the foil on.

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. I made a few changes. I added 1/3 c. shredded parm. to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture along with an egg. Also, in between the noodles and sour cream/ cream cheese mixtures I added a layer a crumbled fontina cheese. It was so so good. I think it's better than lasagna.

This recipe was awesome for a few reasons: The ingredients were all in my pantry, and the results were delicious.  I had to substitute a mixture of sour cream/vegi cream cheese/cottage cheese for the sour cream/cheese cream mixture.  The recipe turned out great anyway and even my 11 month old baby loved it (coursely pureed).  Next time I might add some olive oil to the pasta before layering for the nutritional boost.

Very good.  I recommend mixing the cream cheese mixture and pasta sauce into the noodles before topping with cheese- otherwise the noodles won't stick together.

A far more tasty way to eat spaghetti. I really like this recipe. I did half the noodles, as others recommend. I haven't used green onions, but mostly because I don't buy them very often. I did toss the noodles with parm cheese. And I like it better with mozzerella cheese on top, rather than cheddar. Tasty and makes great leftovers.

This was an unexpected delicious surprise!  I knew it wouldn't be bad with all the good reviews, but I never expected it to be as good as it was!  I seasoned the meat up a bit with garlic, some sauteed onions, basil, etc.  My husband and son devoured it!  I'll definitely make this again.  It's perfect for making ahead of time and heating up when I get home from work!

How many languages can you say "delicious" in?  I too added 1.5 jars of sauce, tossed the spaghetti in olive oil and Parmesan. Worked out insanely well.  Try it!  You'll LOVE it!

Absolutely delicious!  I'm wasn't a big spaghetti fan...until now!  I didn't have any green onions, so those were omitted.  And, per the past reviews, I added some ricotta cheese to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I also mixed some of the sour cream mixture with the noodles in the bottom of the pan.  Instead of using jarred sauce, I made my own using tomato sauce, onion, bell pepper, garlic, and spices.  I couldn't have asked for a better spaghetti!

This was a hit in my house.  I followed some other suggestions and added butter and parmesan to the spaghetti.  I also used a red pepper instead of green (personal preference) and added fresh, sliced mushrooms.  Also used whipped cream cheese and chives so I didn't have to chop green onions.  It was creamy and filling and very comforting.

Very good. Shhhhh, don't tell the kids or the hubby that I snuck in some pureed veggies. So, I added 1/4 c. pureed carrots and 1/4 c. sweet potatoes in the meat sauce and let it simmer for the 20 minutes. No one was the wiser. Everyone ate it. So, we all got a little more nutritional bang for our buck!

This recipe is a definite keeper. I made a few minor changes. I browned some chopped onion and minced garlic with the beef, added about 1/2 cup of grated parmesan to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture, sprinkled the shredded cheddar over the bottom layers before adding the beef layer, and I topped the beef with shredded mozarella. The result was outstanding. I was skeptical about the sour cream/cream cheese mixture but I think it really made the dish.

This is a wonderfully rich recipe. I did not have all the ingredients so I improvised a little and made a couple of changes. I did not have sour cream available so for the filling layer so I used 1, 8 oz block of cream cheese, a spoonful of whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup evaporated milk and 1/4 cup Ranch Dressing. I mixed this all together and added about 1/4 cup shredded mozzerella cheese. I didn't have chedder cheese for the top so I shredded 2 cups of mozzerella and about 1/4 cup colby cheeses. I also changed one other thing after reading the reviews about it being dry. I used 2 full cans of spaghetti sauce and added 2 tablespoons sugar to the sauce (It ends the "canny" flavor. I poured 2 ladle fulls of sauce onto the bottom of my 9x13 pan, added 1/2 of the spaghetti, 2 more ladle fulls of sauce, the rest of the spaghetti (I used 1 lb) and then spead the filling on top, followed by the rest of the sauce and the huge layer of cheeses. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was really surprised how this turned out.. so simple, so easy, and then it was tasty on top of that! We all agreed we wanted this served again. A really nice change from the usual spaghetti. I didn't have green onions so I threw in 2 Tbl dried chives. Left out green pepper because I didn't have any. Used Emeril's Marinara sauce for test purposes. I did use 1/4 tsp garlic powder and couldn't help but add 1/4 tsp onion powder to the meat. Other than that, followed exactly, resisting urges to add all kinds of other things, LOL. This was really good. We'll have this again and again. The spaghetti layer was really thick and could have used more sauce, but not really necessary as we enjoyed it and it wasn't dry at all. Thanks for something different and tasty! A good way to feed a lot of people.

"Can't Go Wrong" Recipe...I knew my date had a thing for spaghetti, and although spaghetti is a no-no on a first date (think *sluuurp*), this was perfect for so many reasons.  1. the noodles are baked after so you "cut" thru the spaghetti with a fork 2.  easy  3. so tasty, my date (who was also tasty) said "You are a good cook."  Revisions: i would add more veggies than the bell pepper and green onions next time.  i used a jar and-a-1/2 of sauce, still NOT enough.  i'd cut out spaghetti by 1/4.  i did use low fat sour cream and eased up on the cheese on top.  to complement the meal, i did do salad/italian bread, but for dessert i made those the chocolate-covered strawberries on this website.  I looked up wine suggestions for spaghetti and stumbled across Orvieto Classico as a good match--and it was SO good that by the time my date arrived, 1/2 the bottle was gone :)

Ymmmm! This is a very delicious recipe! My only advice, though, it so use about 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of spaghetti that the recipe calls for.

IM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE THIS FOUR STARS, BUT NEXT TIME I WILL CUT THE AMOUNT OF PASTA IN HALF...IT WAS JUST WAY TOO MUCH PASTA...I USED LEAN GROUND BEEF AND FAT FREE SOUR CREAM AND CREAM CHEESE TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT.

This recipe sounded great.  But when I baked it for the family they said it tasted more like a dip than spaghetti.  I thought the sour cream and cream cheese would have melted more.  It came out a little dry.  I followed the directions.  The sour cream and cream cheese and chives really gave it more of a "dip" taste than a meal taste.  I don't think I will be making this again.  Sorry :(

Way too saucy.  Should use a whole pound of noodles...not just 1/4 pound.  Other wise it would have been much better.

This was fantastic! I used one 20oz jar of spaghetti sauce and thought it was the perfect amount. Unless you are a red sauce fanatic, you will be fine going with what the recipe calls for. Like another reviewer suggested; I mixed the jar of sauce with the spaghetti (also used full pound), layered the cream cheese mixture on top of that, and then the cheese on top. I used a whole block of this greek cream cheese I found in the store and you couldn't even tell the difference (it only had 3G of fat per serving)!

Loved it!  I didn't even have sour cream or green peppers on hand, so I browned up some onions with the meat and added some cheese to the cream cheese.  Was delicious!  Thanks!

This was very good, but I was concerned about the calorie content, so I used light rotini pasta (didn't have any spaghetti), beef, sour cream and cream cheese.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added onion with the green pepper to the beef while cooking.  I also added the cheese mixture to the pasta, so it wouldn't get dry as other had issues with.  This was very good.

No complaints whatsoever. Just make sure the meat mixture completed covers the spaghetti; otherwise you will find yourself crunching on some dried spaghetti like I did once.

Excellent.  I used mozarella instead of cheddar cheese due to family preference and doubled quantity.  Added some basil and garlic powder to the cream cheese / sour cream mixture.  Family raved about it.  Will definitely make again.  thanks for sharing.

My hubby loved this.  I used about 1/2 the amount of spaghetti and used a spicy pasta sauce.  I added 1/2 a sweet onion, diced up, (instead of green onion) and sautéed for about 5 minutes in the pan after I browned the ground beef.  Then I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I also poured a little red wine in with the pasta sauce.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I used all parmesan cheese and left out the cheddar.  Instead of layering it, I mixed everything together and it was delicious.  We will be making this again.

My son told my I could never make just plain spaghetti again after I made this spaghetti pie.  I used some left over spaghetti noodles for the pasta base.  I did add a couple of whisked eggs that  poured over the pasta before I added the rest of the ingredients just to bind them together.  I also used sausage instead of ground beef to give it a little extra flavor.  I had to add a little more time than what the recipe called for because it wasn't bubbling yet, but I might have had more left over pasta than what the recipe called for.  I will make this again for sure!

thought it was quite tasty, But my guys think it would be better if served with a extra ladle of sauce over the top. I used about 1/2 gallon of red gravy( Sunday meat sauce) . I will use this one again.

My daughter has difficulty with wheat so I made some adjustments.  I used quinoa pasta, substituted ground turkey for the beef, and have experimented with different combinations of cheeses.  Each time it came out wonderful and heats up great the next day for lunch.  I did add some butter and Parmesan cheese to the pasta before putting it in the pan.  It seemed to enhance the recipe.

This recipe is awesome! My family went back for thirds. It reminds me of lasagna but the cream cheese mixture makes this recipe a 5 star recipe. I followed recipe but seasoned and added garlic to meat while cooking.

This was a big hit with my family. I used leftover homemade spaghetti sauce which was loaded with veggies and ground turkey. I used about half the cheddar. I wasn't a huge fan of the sour cream & cream cheese layer, it was yummy but didn't seem to fit too well, maybe due to my ground turkey?. Maybe next time I'll go for ricotta or cottage cheese for kind of a lasagna ish thing.

I made this with 1/2 lb. ground turkey and 1/2 lb. sausage instead of ground beef.  Also added butter, parmesan cheese and italian dressing to the noodles and topped with mozzarella.  I will cut the recipe in half next time, half a pan easily serves 4-5 people.

Made this tonight. Husband declared it a new favorite. Like many, I made a few tweaks. I mixed the pasta with the cream mixture and really like the result of that. I was making a reduced recipe but still used a whole jar of sauce, and I wish I'd had another half a jar. In the cream mixture, I did not use green onions because I didn't have them on hand, but I did add Parmesan and Romano cheese to it. I also used mozzarella on top instead of cheddar. I don't plan to change anything next time except to have more sauce.

This was an absolute "HIT" at my house tonight!  It was easy to make, easy to clean up after, and flavorful.  My husband likes more of the add-ins in his spaghetti, so next time I will add mushrooms, more green pepper, sun dried tomatoes, and maybe some sausage or pepperoni chunks.  He gave this a "10" as it was made per recipe today though!!!

Pretty good meal, but just lacked a something.  I didn't have any green pepper, so maybe that was it.  I think I would only saute the onions and green peppers for the last few minutes of the beef cooking.  It needed a little crunch.  Overall, good recipe & the family gobbled it up.  Served with garlic bread and a side salad.

Takes awhile to prepare, but it's worth it. I mixed the pasta and the cream cheese/sour cream mixture and then put the meat mixture on top of that. It took longer than 30 minutes to properly brown the cheese but that's okay.

We really like this recipe.  I've made it multiple times with angel hair pasta.  I do suggested, as others have, to add a jar and 1/2 of pasta sauce, little dry if not added.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this over the weekend and it turned out great!  I even flubbed up and forgot to cover it until 15 minutes into baking.  The only changes I made were to butter the noodles and add about 1 tsp. Italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked

This turned out better than I thought it would! It was delicious and I will definitely make it again. I agree with another reviewer, tossing the pasta in some butter and parmesan added some great flavor. I chopped up green peppers, onion, and crushed garlic cloves and sauteed them with the ground beef after I drained it before adding a jar and a half of pasta sauce.  I topped it with grated parmesan after I took it out of the oven too.  Yummy!

It was quite good, and my kids loved it.  The only thing I would change, and this is personal preference...leave out the green onions, and use garlic instead.  I also used olive oil in the 9x13 pan, vs. the spray, and didn't have any problem with crunchy noodles.  Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was great!  I did have to make a couple of changes.  Only had half the amount of pasta sauce in my fridge so I pureed a can of diced tomatoes and small can of tomato sauce, added some Italian seasonings, added garlic to the cream cheese and sourcream mixture and tossed it with the noodles. Used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and sprinkled italian bread seasoning on the top.  Gave off a great aroma while cooking and tasted great!  Not dry at all.  Oh, I did only use a 13oz box of whole wheat spaghetti noodles too.

Quick and Easy! I wouldn't say it was better than Lasagna, but it was darn good. The consistency was perfect and I have tons of leftovers. I think next time I'll use a little more cream cheese and green onion, since I'd prefer a more creamy texture and onion flavor to baked pasta dishes. Yum-O!

I really like this dish.  I made it in a 2 quart pyrex baking dish and used 1/2 pound spaghetti, and just shy of a 28 oz. jar of Prego (kids like the sweetness of this sauce).  I mixed about 1/2 cup of sour cream & 2-3 ozs of cream cheese together, omitted the green onions, and mixed it w/the noodles before adding to baking dish. For the sauce, I sauteed 1/2 pound italian sausage, 1/4 c. onion and 2 crushed garlic cloves, then added Prego and used mozz. cheese on top. Let it sit after baking for 10 minutes before serving. I think the sausage added nice flavor, but next time I'll use ground turkey, and add parmesan, green onions & 1 egg to cream cheese mixture.  I look forward to changing things up on this recipe in the future.

WOW!  This is great!  Used the full 8 oz package of cream cheese and low fat sour cream and mixed it in with the pasta.  Also added a can of mushrooms and put a little Parmesan on top.  Made a ton!! Next time will cut the recipe in half but there will definitely be a next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have green onions and green peppers and it was still good to me but my husband said it tasted bland to him.  I'll make with the peppers and onions and probably add mushrooms next time.

I am NOT rating this a a replacement to my baked ziti or lasagna recipes. I am rating this all on it's own as a completetely differnt meal. I have made it twice, to rave reviews both times. I made it exactly as stated with the omission of peppers as a personal preference and because I never have them on hand. I think I did add  bit more garlic, again because that's what I like not because this recipe needs it per se. Again, if I wanted to make this as a lasagna I would have been disapointed because it doesn not taste like that but for it's own merit it is a wonderful and easy dish!

After reading so many rave reviews of this recipe, I decided to make it last night.  I was a bit disappointed in the taste personally.  Nothing I can put my finger on really, just kind of boring to me for some reason.  I would never put this above lasanga as some people said.  I very well may prepare this again, as it was very easy to make, but not going to be a new staple in our house as I was hoping it might be after such great reviews.

Not too difficult to make, and my family liked it. Makes a lot. Made ahead and kept in fridge, added 5 minutes to the baking time, and it was fine. Make sure to spray your foil covering with nonstick spray or the cheese will stick to it. Thanks!

My family and I have been making this for years!  We love it because it does not get crunchy and dried out during baking.  It works well with leftovers and is very quick.  We sometimes leave out all the filling part and just mix milk and cream cheese.  Careful covering with foil b/c the cheese will stick to it if you don't do something to keep it away form the melting cheese. ENJOY!!!

I made this tonight, and it is AMAZING! As suggested by other posters, I did add 1 egg and 1/4 c. parmesan to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, and mixed it with the noodles. It really helps hold this dish together, and keeps the pasta from becoming dry. Other than that, my DH said it was the best spaghetti he'd ever had! Thank you for this yummy twist on a common dish in our household. I will make this again and again!!

Very good. I used whole grain penne, after it was cooked and drained I tossed it with parmesan cheese and butter as suggested. I also cooked the onions and green peppers in the frying pan with the hamburg. As suggested, added 1/2 cup cottage cheese(did not have ricotta),to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Will make this again.

My husband and I really like this recipe. I did layer the spaghetti pie based on other suggestions. I put the noodles, then the cream cheese/sour cream mixture on top of it. Then I added groud beef, then added my spaghetti sauce with cheese on top.

I've not prepared this dish myself yet, but a church friend served this recently at a get-together at her home, & it was AMAZING! I've never wanted a recipe so badly; it's delicious! I can't wait to prepare it for MY family.

I used a mixture of italian sausage and ground turkey. I did not add the cheddar cheese.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I doubled it, so I could freeze some for another meal.  This was THE BEST spaghetti pie I have ever had! I was a little wary of the sour cream/cream cheese combo.  I prepared one pan of spaghtetti pie to test it.  It was delicious! I am throwing away all the other spaghetti pie recipes I have. Do yourself a favor and try this!

Fairly good. Not something that I would make again, though. I don't care for overcooked pasta - and I realize that it's hard to avoid in baked pasta dishes - but, I don't seem to notice it as much when a larger pasta is used. I just don't think spaghetti works real well being cooked twice.

I have made this three times now.  My family loves it.  I make a double batch of the meat and sauce.  I add the remaining sour cream to the noodles.  The cheese and sour cream make this dish so yummy!

My husband and I loved this and it is now a 'keeper'.  I did cut the amt of pasta to about 2/3 and increased the amt of cream cheese to a full 8oz.  Used FF cc and sc and had no green onions.  A tip is to use the Hunts new Bold & Spicy sauce, it adds a ton of flavor to this dish.  It turned out fantastic, so thanks!

Great, easy and delicious recipe.  I omitted the green onions and added sauteed onions to the ground beef after it was browned and drained.  However, next time I make it, I will add the green onions to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture as I know it will give it even more flavor.  One recipe I know I will make again.  Makes a ton and great as leftovers!

The final product was not bad, but needs some tweaking in my opinion.  I used a 9x13 (or very close to it) baking dish as suggested and the layer of spaghetti was almost an inch thick! The sour cream and cream cheese mixture just barely covered the spaghetti which surprised me.  The photo of this recipe makes it looks like the cheese layer was much thicker! Anyway, I did follow some previous reviewers' suggestions for modifications which were:  add an egg and grated parmigiano to the spaghetti, cook the meat with chopped onion and garlic.  The rest I did following the recipe exactly.  Changes I will try next time: Use 1/2-3/4 lb of spaghetti (instead of 1lb), use 1 cup of s. cream (instead of 3/4 cup), use the whole 8oz package of c. cheese (instead of 1/2 package).  One question for those that followed the recipe and DID NOT add anything to the spaghetti, does the spaghetti come out crispy?  It didn't when egg and parmigiano was added, and I think I would have liked it crispy better.

I've made this several times now and it's one of my fav's. Here's how I make it. I brown the grown beef with about 1/2 cup onion, and 2 cloves garlic along with the bell pepper, drain then add 3 fresh tomatoes (I have an overabundance from my garden) add some mushrooms and let that simmer for about 30 mins then add the jar of pasta let simmer while you cook the noodles. In the mean time I mix the sour cream and cream cheese then throw in some dried chives and sprinkle in a little parmesan (eyeball it) mix the noodles in with the cream cheese mixture then place that in the bottom of the 13x9 pan and pour spaghetti sauce over top and sprinkle with the cheese and bake as directed.

My husband said this was a definite "keeper.  I modified a bit.  I beat up an egg and tossed with cooked spaghetti.  I also used chopped yellow onion instead of green onion and fresh chopped garlic, which I sauteed with drained meat.  I sprinkled fresh grated parm over the cream cheese mixture.  I used shredded cheddar, mozz, and provolone cheese to top.  The combo of the cream cheese and sour cream made this dish.  I was skeptical - but boy is this delicious.  The kids loved it as well.

This was sooooo good!!  I used 1 1/2 jars of sauce and added both cheddar and mozzerella cheese - because I like lots of sauce and cheese!  I also took the advice of some other reviewers and added the remaining sour cream into the noodles to keep them from drying out.  It was perfect and I already have people asking me for the recipe!!  :)

WONDERFUL!! This was so easy to make, and my husband said it is one of my best meals ever! Left overs are just as good too! I give this 5 stars! I did only use 1/2 the amount of spaghetti since it's just the two of us. This will be made over and over again in our home.

I've tried a couple of different versions of baked spaghetti lately.  This one appealed to me because I didn't have any cottage cheese or ricotta on hand.  I was a little worried about the flavor of the cream cheese competing with everything else but I actually really liked it.  I combined the cream cheese and sour cream, then mixed in some melted butter, a beaten egg, parmesan cheese, and parsley (a throw-back from another recipe I tried).  I tossed that with the noodles, then layered the meat sauce and cheese.  I baked it a little longer due to the egg but I was really pleased with how it came out.  One thing I liked was that it came out in well-defined square shaped pieces.  This makes a much prettier presentation.  The draw-back was that leftovers were a little on the dry side.  In the future I'll probably stick to this recipe but I'll make it in smaller portions so that I don't have so much leftover.

Made today for the 2nd time. I love this dish, nice change of pace from traditional spaghetti. I omit the bell pepper and green onion. I use Super Chunky Veggie Sauce and Sour cream with chives. I use Italian Sausage for the meat and after combining with the sauce, I use ALOT of Garlic Pepper to season. We love the stuff, put it on alot of our dishes! I load the top with a full bag of shredded 4 cheese blend. To help with the dryness of the bottom noodles, I also mix in a heaping spoon of butter after draining, then mix about 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture with the noodles before putting in the pan. Then layer the rest as written. Very Good!!

This was absolutely fabulous!  Very easy to make and my husband practically raved over it (which is very seldom).  Every one of my children gobbled it up, too.  I tossed the noodles with some butter and parmesan like another reviewer suggested.  I also only had 1/2 pound of spaghetti, but it seemed to go over very well.  The dish wasn't too dry.  I am definitely going to make this again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My family really liked this dish to my surprise, but I did not use green peppers. Also, I used Mozzarella Cheese, fresh shredded, instead of cheddar. I gave this four stars because I found there was not nearly enough sauce for the dish...but we have made it a few times since I found the recipe.

This is very similar to a recipe I got years ago from a magazine.  I like this version, but it works much better if, rather than layering the pasta under the cream cheese, you mix them together, then spread the sauce mixture over them, dividing the recipe in half to make two layers.  Otherwise, the pasta tends to stay "dry," as several other reviewers have mentioned.

This was a great recipe for a family.  I'll be sure to make it for my mom for mothers day.  The only thing I would do differntly to keep the noodles moist is to add some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan. Also I received this tip from another review, mix the cream cheese with the noodles so it's just easier on yourself.  Great Recipe Overall!!

Nice recipe.  I think it may have had slightly too much pasta.  1 pound seems like a lot for this recipe.  I would probably make it with 1/2 to 3/4 pound next time.

I followed the recipe exactly for this one with the exception of not adding green bell peppers (because I did not have them on hand). It turned out pretty well! It's just really really rich though, so it's hard to eat much of it. 
You definitely don't need a salad or garlic bread with this one... it's a full meal on its own.

My family enjoyed this.  I did add some butter and garlic powder to the bottom layer of spaghetti.  I did not have any green onions on hand for the cream cheese/sour cream layer so I added a little onion powder to the mixture.  I was probably more generous with the cheddar cheese than the recipe calls for as I really don't measure.  We will definitely have this again!

The whole family enjoyed.  Probably would rate 4 1/2 stars. I left out the green pepper/onions so my young kids would eat.  I did add a shake of onion powder to the sour cream mix in its place.  I also attempted to cut the fat grams by using low fat cheddar/cream cheese and no fat sour cream. This was a nice simple change from a traditional spaghetti dinner and I will use again.

My family LOVED this dish. The only things I did different was not add the bell pepper, and I added some mozzarella and parmesan to the the cheese mixture. It was very easy to make and it was just SO good! I took some to work for my friend to try, and she loved it as well! This is a new family favorite!

This is a great meal. Whole family loved it! I made a few changes to lighten up since I am diabetic. I used whole grain pasta and used low fat sour cream & low fat cream cheese.

We loved this. I left out the green pepper (just a personal preference). I used whole eight ounce package of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream. I just hate to have a little bit of the sour cream and cream cheese left.  We think that the leftovers are even better!

My family thought this was pretty good.  My few changes were: used italian sausage with the ground beef.  Also added a layer of ricotti and added half the sour cream mixture to the spaghetti.  Topped with a mozerella cheese blend.  Tasted even better the second day as leftovers.

We really liked this one, it has great flavor and is much different than the usual spaghetti.  I left out the bell pepper and used light sour cream and 1/3 less fat cream cheese to lighten it.  It tasted great, and I will definitely make it again.  It does give you quite a few dishes to clean but it was worth it!

I joined just to write a review of this recipe! AWESOME! I made this last year for my husband, he loved it but I forgot about it. Hunting season is upon us and he requested it for him and the guys. Delicious. Made it as is, no changes.

Excellent dish!  I did omit the green pepper and added butter and parm cheese to noodles as recommended from another review.  Does create a lot of dishes but well worth it for a great dinner.  I made in the morning so I wouldn't have all the mess in the evening and all we had to do was heat and serve.

This was such a hit with my husband, and he is an awesome spaghetti maker - he said I have the crown now with this recipe.  The entire family devoured it everytime I have made it.  I make 2 separate pans and put one in the fridge for the next day/evening or whatever and the sauces blend even more and it seems to taste even better.  Good for a make a head - kids sport night - 45 minutes max from fridge to eating!!!

I was looking for something different and had most of the ingredients on hand.  I added italian spices, minced onion and garlic powder to the meat while it was cooking.  I used angel hair pasta and used about 1/2 a pound.  I mixed all of the ingredients together in a large bowl and added some parmasan cheese. I put it in a casserole dish and topped with cheddar cheese.  It turned out very good, not dry at all.  I think the sour cream and cream cheese kept the noodles moist.  My family loved it.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

I made a few changes. I used penne pasta, as we really like it. I used my husband's homemade tomato sauce that has onion, green pepper and garlic in it and doubled the amount called for. I used Italian sausage and seasoned it. I used Mozzarella cheese. The kids loved it. Thank you!

I used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream, and added a jar of sliced mushrooms. And lastly, we used Wisconsin Beer Cheddar :)..Husband ate thirds of this!!!

I get most of my recipes from this site, and this is one of my favorites. We make it every couple of weeks. So simple, and much better than regular spaghetti - the bell pepper and cream cheese/sour cream make it. Add a salad and some bread, and it's a great homey meal. I like it, kids like it, even hubby who won't eat regular spaghetti likes it. (I use reduced fat cream cheese & sour cream, and it's still yummy!)

Yummy!  The whole family really liked this.  I did use more sauce than called for and It was homemade.  I aldo addes more veggies, some mushrooms and zucchini.  I loved the cream cheese/sour cream mixture, it gave a great flavor.  I didn't have green onions so I just sprinkled some Onion Meadly Mrs. Dash into it.  I will make this again.  Thanks Gwen!

Half my family loves spaghetti and the other half hates it, but with this recipie we all loved it! My only suggestion is that next time I would add a little of the meat mixture to the spaghetti, since that part was a tad bland.

My family really enjoyed this recipe with a few adjustments.  I decreased the amount of spaghetti in half, added 1/2 lb. of spicy ground italian sausage, used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream and topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  I also had to bake this longer than what the recipe called for, approx. 1 hr. to heat completely through.  Very good!

The whole family loves it!  Have changed it a bit for heart health.  Whole wheat spaghetti, ground turkey, and light sour cream/cream cheese.  Added about 1/4 cup more sauce.  Spaghetti Pie III is GREAT!

Just wonderful! I used rigatoni instead because it's what I had, and it was still great! My family all loved it. The leftovers only lasted two days. There's only three of us and leftovers usually get thrown away-not this time! Thanks for a great new recipe!

Thanks for this recipe!  Being a vegetarian, I changed the beef to veggie crumbles. I also added chopped onion and two cloves of garlic to the sauce mixture and then omitted the green onions from the other part.  I used cracked black pepper fettucine (it was all that I had) and it was great.  My husband thought this should be a regular meal at our home.  We loved it!

Will definitely make again! On advice of others, I used the entire 8oz. Cream cheese and 8oz. Sour cream. I mixed this mixture into hot spaghetti. Added a bit more pasta sauce because I lik it that way.  I also used angel hair pasta. In addition, I chopped up some onion to add to the ground beef. Great flavor. Makes a lot of food.

This recipe is a hit in our household!  Hubby loved it so much that he bragged about it to his coworkers.  I just use leftover homemade spaghetti sauce, and I also mix a beaten egg in with the noodles.  Perfection!

I made this using macaroni instead of spaghetti (mostly because I didn't have spaghetti.)  It turned out beautifully AND my husband loved it.  It's flavourful and filling.

Thought it was really good, but I did take the suggestion several made to mix the sour cream mixture with the spaghetti, to keep it from drying out. Opted for mozzarella & Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. Also, I only used 3/4 pounds of spaghetti, while keeping everything else the same measurements. It still made a HUGE amount, but it freezes and reheats well, so this would be a good "make ahead" meal for those who like to do that. I just sliced the leftovers into squares, froze them separately, and had several lunches ready to go. Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly like the recipe. The family thought it was so-so. Husband said it tasted like cafeteria food...nothing special. If i were to make it again, i would definitely spice it up more; add more salt and other seasonings. also, the cream cheese/sour cream mixture was so lumpy. it was hard to distribute over the top of the pasta and therefore parts had alot and other parts were too dry.

Loved this with the suggestions made by others: Added butter and parmesan to cooked pasta, used 1.5 jars of sauce, added 1/2 cup of ricotta to cream cheese mixture.  Next time I make it, I might double the cream cheese mixture as this was (to me) the best part!  I may actually use this idea of cream cheese and sour cream mixed with ricotta in my stuffing for my shells (I normally just use ricotta).  Thanks!

I found it a bit bland.  It was OK but not great.  Not sure what might've given it that 'oomph' to take it to the top.  I wanted it to be better (hopefully the folks I took it to are OK with it).

I used 1 pound of thin spaghetti and doubled the rest of the ingredients. And instead of green onion and cream cheese I used chive and onion cream cheese. Delicious!

This is a go-to for my family when we're tired of regular spaghetti.  I make a few changes depending on what I have on hand.   Skip the green pepper.  Use only the whites of two green onions, and add Parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture.   I add a can of tomato sauce or 2 grated tomatoes to the jarred sauce, and use mozz or Monterrey jack cheese instead of cheddar.     It's easy to make and with this recipe I can freeze one of the pies for another day.

A comfort meal I grew up with! 
I love!
I omitted the gr . pepper & topped with mozzarella instead of cheddar.
Other than those 2 little changes I followed exactly,  & it was a favorite for the whole family! 
YUM!

My family wanted lasagna and tobe honest I was too lazy to go to the store. I stumbled upon this recipe and had MOST of the ingredients so I figured I give it a whirl. It turned out really good. I had no green pepper and I used regular onions bc I had no green ones. I had fresh parsley so I added that in. I also had no cheddar cheese so I sprinkled over in parmesan and put a few slices of American cheese on top. Yeah, I really didn't want to go to the store lol. But it turned out really good. I bet it tastes awesome if I had all the ingredients lol but even with what I had I still give it 5 stars

I used penne pasta and mixed it with the sour cream / cream cheese before putting it in the pan. My husband and the neighbors who were helping him build a pole barn, really liked it. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this many times, but I use penne pasta instead. It definitely can be made healthier with fat free sour cream and cream cheese, and I even toss some diced carrots and tomatoes in with the ground beef while it's browning.

I don't know in what universe this dish could be better than lasagna...because it's just mac 'n cheese....and not that good.  I agree with the reviewer who said, "It's a lot of work for noodles with cheese on top."

This was fantastic! We loved the creamy layer to this! I also added two minced garlic cloves to the meat mixture. It was a good addition. I served it with french bread. Easy and delicious!

This was super easy and super good. I usually use ricotta cheese, but was out so this recipe was perfect. I really liked it and would make it again.

I made this last night for my husband and kids.  They all loved it!  The only thing I changed was I omitted the salt and pepper and I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I'm sure this recipe will be requested often.  Thanks for posting it!

I made this recipe according to the directions.  The cream cheese and sour cream mixture was quite pasty.  I will definitely not make this again.

This was a great recipe! It seemed like a lot of spaghetti, maybe not use as much.  I also will add a little more veggies, like green pepper, and maybe add mushrooms next time.

I put this together on my lunch break from work and it was very easy. The whole family LOVED it and I will definitely make it again.  My changes were, fresh garlic, red bell pepper, red onion instead of green onion and a jar of Arribiatta sauce since we like a bit of spice. It will become a regular since I usually have the ingredients on hand. Thank you for an awesome meal.l

This was a great recipe!...i tweaked it a bit just b/c of some of the other reviews...i used about half of the pasta, mixed the cream cheese/sour cream mixture with the pasta and used a little can of tomato sauce in addition to the pasta sauce...used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and also used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  oh i also left out green pepper and onion due to a picky husband!...overall great and easy recipe:)

I so wanted to love this recipe.  I followed it to the tee except for leaving out peppers.  I guess as with others things in life, taste is relative.  It just tasted like a mouthful of hot cheese and cream cheese.  My apologies to the submitter.  Thank you

This is a great recipe! The cream cheese/sour cream mixture gives it almost a nutmeg flavor which goes beautifully with the rest of the ingredients. I made a few minor changes to try and lighten up the recipe. I used extra lean ground beef, and sauteed it with green pepper and onion and seasoned w/ garlic salt. I used whole wheat spaghetti, lite sour cream and reduced fat cheddar-I also only used about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese). It didn't taste "lite" and was so easy and delicious! Thanks!

I was hoping for the taste of the spaghetti pie my mom used to make, but was rather disappointed. Next time I would either add more salt, or use a premade spaghetti sauce. I also would have used more cottage cheese- only using 1 cup was just not enough. The cottage cheese really makes this dish, and not having enough made it taste like very plain spaghetti.

Made this last night and everyone LOVED it. By 2 boys, ages 4 and 6 both had 2 helpings! My older boy said that he wants this 3 meals a day... that's quite a reaction.  I made a few changes: did my own sauce with ground turkey, onion, garlic, red pepper, diced tomato and tomato paste. I used Creme Fresh instead of sour cream and mozzarella in place of cheddar.   Will certainly make again soon.

It had decent flavor, but it didn't serve up well.  The spaghetti was very messy.  I've made other spaghetti pies in the past and they usually had some egg to bind the noodles together to make a "crust".  If I ever make this again, I would try doing that.

VERY good recipe. There was no reason for me to cover it during the baking process, and instead of green chiles for the sour cream mix, I diced about 4 jalapenos and added them to the mixture. This added just enough spice. I also used garlic salt instead of normal salt.

Love love! I make it with hot breakfast sausage though.  I cook that with chopped onions. I also leave out the bell peppers because my family doesn't care for them. We use rigatoni noodles too. How I've modified this over the bazillion times I've made it is to put my sour cream/cream cheese in the 13x9 pan, drain my noodles, and then mix them in the cream mixture. After that, I pour the spaghetti-sausage mix on top and then top all of it with cheddar cheese. We tried mozzarella, but cheddar was enjoyed more.

A bit dry.  I'd double the sauce mixture somehow next time.  Froze leftovers like I do for lasagne, and it was even more dry.

Very good very filling.  A friend of mine made this at work and everyone loves it.   She makes her with red/purple onions and adds spicy bob evens sausage.  I didn't make it exactly as it was instructed.  I used what I had on hand.  I left out the green onion instead I used regular onions that I saut'eed.  I left out the green pepper also.  I also layerd mine like a lasagna.  I mixed my meat wtih the sauce and put a layer of sauce and meet at bottom of pan like I do with my lasagn then added 1st layer of sauce and noodles, 2nd layer cream cheese sour cream mixture then 3rd layer a layer of cheddar cheese then none start over again and repeat the 3 layers.   I doubled the recipe and made two pans of this and it is great re-heated.  I will make again sure to be a crowd pleaser to take to a pot luck.  The only bad thing was by the time I was done my kitchen was a mess.  Very yummy!

This is sooo good, I made meatballs with it instead of crumbling ground beef in it, I made the meatballs seperately and added after spaghetti was out of the oven..I also used mozzarella on top because I thought it made more sense, you really only need 1/2 lb of spaghetti and that is plenty unless you're feeding a whole crew...the sour cream/cream cheese is very yummy! Definitely a keeper!

This was a great starting point. My family is vegetarian, so I made the sauce with veggie crumbles. I also used heavy cream in place of the sour cream. I added fresh basil, dried oregano, and fresh garlic to the cheese mixture. We all loved it and there will be some great leftovers. My 9 year old is very excited about her lunch at school tomorrow! Now that's a recommendation.

I had high hopes for this but it just did not do it for either myself or my husband.  I made the recipe as written but maybe should have modified as other reviewers did.  Since there was nothing on the noodles and the sauce didn't seep down in very well they were dry.  Also, I don't care for sour cream but thought maybe when added with the cream cheese it would change the flavor a bit but it didn't and my sour cream loving husband didn't like it either.  I think if you added butter or some extra sauce to the noodles that would fix the dryness issue, but if I ever made this again I would omit the sour cream mixture entirely, maybe adding ricotta instead if I wanted.

I was hestitant to make this, but i dont know why. This turned out great with afew adjustments. I buttered the noodle, I added a whole cream cheese. I layered the noodles,then added a small bottle of pizza sauce on top. Then spreaded the cream cheese mixture, sprinkled with cheddar cheese. I added mozarella to the top of the meat layer. * be sure to spray with cooking spray !!

This was really good.  I liked that it had more to it than just spaghetti.  I used a whole block of cream cheese and omited the onions and pepper since I didn't have them.  I would make again.

This is a great recipe.  It's one of my favorites.  So easy, so yummy.  You can really get creative with this pie.  Sometimes I add mushrooms or anything else that might sound good at the time.  Great in the freezer. Awesome potluck dish.  Make it ahead of time because it does taste best after it sits for a while.

I didn't add the green peppers or onions as they're not things I like, but this recipe was excellent! My family really liked this as an alternative to spaghetti. I used rotini and made my own sauce. Wonderful combination with the cream cheese/sour cream!

Very tasty! One of my favorites. If you have problems spreading the cream cheese/sour cream, just melt the cream cheese a little bit and it will spread perfectly on the hot noodles! This really isn't a hard recipe at all.

When I have left-overs, it's always a challenge to come up with a new way to serve the same meal. This recipe worked perfectly. I used the basic ideas of this recipe but didn't follow exactly. I mixed 1 8oz cream cheese with 1 c. sour cream & added fresh minced garlic. I mixed this with the left-over noodles and put them in the 9x13 pan. I used the left-over spaghetti sauce w/ meat & poured that on top of the noodles. Topped with mozz cheese, covered w/ foil and baked for 50 mins. then removed foil and baked an addl. 15-20 mins to brown cheese. It was creamy & delicious. I will keep this handy for next time we have spaghetti left-overs.

This was a nice change from regular spaghetti.  I followed the recipe exactly up to the point of putting it in the casserole dish.  I mixed the sour cream/cream cheese layer into the sauce and noodles.  Then topped with the shredded cheese.  Because everything was hot I only had to cook it long enough to melt the cheese.

Perfect for when you don't have a lot of groceries! I also added butter to the spaghetti and for lack of having any veggies omitted the green peppers & green onions. I used Garlic and Herb Cream cheese. I couldn't believe how easy and delicious!! THANK YOU!!!

There is absolutly NOTHING that needs changing on this receipe!!! The ONLY thing I like to do is use more cream cheese. Other than that it is absolutly heavenly!!!! You want to eat the whole dish after trying the first bite. I have never ever had anything so wonderful. The person that thought this up is pure genious!!!!!

UNBELIEVABLE! My hubby ate this for 2 days straight.  I have a Friday Lunch Club that has demanded this 3 x in the last 6 weeks.  Add the fresh grated parmesan cheese in with the sour cream/cream cheese mix - YUMMY and EASY!

The two stars is because of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture... We HATED both the taste and texture! DH who NEVER turns food down, couldn't stomach finishing his bowl because of the cheese mixture (I was able to eat most of mine). The simple addition of ricotta would've saved this dish for us. A few of the changes I made (which I liked) were to cook Italian sausage, add red bell pepper, pasta sauce with mushrooms, and no onion or seasoning. Topped with cheddar/mozz. mix.

I modified the recipe so much it's not really the same, but my family loved it!    I added eggs to the sour cream and used lowfat cottage cheese rather than the cream cheese.  I used left over meat sauce rather than the tomatoe sauce.  I put the pie together more like lasagne with mozzerella cheese rather than cheddar.  Oh, and I added a couple layers of spinach too!

I gave this 4 stars because while my kids loved it, I didn't care for it as much as they did. I think the cream cheese/sour cream mixture took away from the spaghetti flavor a little too much. If it wasn't for that I would have enjoyed this much more.

YUMMY!  I did a few of the other reviewers suggestions.  I mixed the spaghetti with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, then layered with meat sauce. I didnt have a bell pepper or green onions but it was still awesome! I did add an onion and garlic while browning the meat. I used my homemade sauce and didnt add any salt/pepper/ or garlic powder.  We will be making this again soon.

The whole family enjoyed this.  I followed some of the reviewers advice and added in some ricotta cheese to the cream cheese/sour cream/green onion mixture, plus I mixed in some additional ricotta and sour cream to the buttered noodles.  I also added 1/2 of a sauted yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the browned ground turkey.  This recipe makes A LOT, so luckily our family of four likes to eat leftovers - we'll be having it for dinner for the next several nights.  : )  Thanks for the recipe.

Quick and Easy and Yummy! Used rigatoni, added cheese (mozzarella, lite sour cream) mixture to pasta, poured sauce over top and baked.

This is very good albeit a little lacking in flavor. I added some basil and oregano to the s.c mix as well as addtl cheese. I mixed the pasta and s/c instead of layering them. don't like dry noodles. will make again w/a little extra sauce and more spice.

This wasn't "better than lasagne" for us. I would have much rather had lasagne instead. We just couldn't get into it I guess. 3/4 of it turned into leftovers and 5 days later they're still in the fridge. That says something.

Great recipe.  Relatively easy and the cream cheese mixture makes it addictive.  I thought it would be weird with cheddar cheese since most italian dishes like this call for mozerella, but it was a refreshing change.  Will make again with no changes.

Delicious! I used angel hair pasta because that's what I had on hand. I used 2 jars of pasta sauce as others had recommended, and I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and however much sour cream was left in my tub (I think it was about halfway full so probably about 8 oz.). It made a HUGE dish but it was oh so yummy!! My daughter and I will be eating on this for a whole week! Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this! I added butter and parmesan to the noodles as someone recommended but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it a day ahead so I had to add time to the cook time, since it was refrigerated and going in the oven cold.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Our family loved this recipe. We made a few changes to suit our taste. We took out the green pepper and onion, we used two jars of pasta sauce. one jar of classico italian sausage and onion. And a jar of 3 cheeses. We sprinkled oregano and used fresh garlic. we like cheese so we used way more cheese! It was other wise followed exactly and it was delicious!!!!

Thanks for the great recipe.  My picky kids even like it.  I've made it twice now. One time I followed completely and the other time I used ground turkey and whole wheat spaghetti.  Both were really good.  The second time I used another posters advice and put an extra scoop of sour cream and mixed that in with the spaghetti.  That really kept it from getting too dry.  So easy to make! Thanks!!

This was very good.  Family ate it up!  I used whole wheat pasta and I mixed two of the Barillo sauces...roasted garlic and also black olive sauce. I used all of the cream cheese and also mixed it with the sour cream and the pasta and a handful or so of parm cheese.  I put some suace on the bottom of the pan and then layered the pasta and then some sauce, then the rest of the pasta and finally the rest of the sauce.  I covered it with italian four cheese blend.  It was good...I think I was expecting the cream cheese mixture to stand out more...it was good.

No more layering lasagne for me... this was the best.  I admit that I made some changes based on what I had on hand.
Chopped and fried a large onion and fresh garlic with the purple (no green) pepper.  Set aside as browned the beef.  Instead of jarred sauce I added a 28 oz can whole plum tomatoes, about 1/3 cup water, and a handful of fresh chopped basil to onions/beef.  I used ziti (no spagetti) and tossed with 1 egg, a knob of butter, and a handful of grated romano.  For the cheese layer I used a sour cream, whole package cream cheese (bought a case of close to date on sale and froze it) and added about 1 1/2 cup cottage cheese I had left in the fridge.  No cheddar, but used provalone on top. Did not cover in the oven. Let sit about 10 minutes before serving.

Almost all gone as husband and 2 teenage football players went for seconds. Served with simple tossed salad and fresh bread, will make again!

I added garlic when browning the ground beef, cut back a bit on the pasta,and added some mozza with the cheddar, otherwise followed the recipe. (Except I forgot to cover it while baking, and it was fine.) It was pretty good, and as it cooled on my plate it got better! Maybe I'll let it stand 10 min. instead of 5 min. next time.

Everyone ate this meal at our table, it was very good.  I added green pepper and onion to the meat mix, it was a good addition.  I also used wheat noodles, which is why I gave this a four star, I believe it would have been way better with flour noodles as far as taste is concerned.  Will definitly try again.

This recipe was really good!  The only change I made was that I used 8 oz. of sour cream and 8 oz. of whipped garlic and herb cream cheese.  I also added 1 can of drained Rotel.  It really added a nice "zip" to it.  I only used one jar of sauce as the recipe indicated, but I wish I had used 1 and a half..as it did need more sauce as other reviews have suggested.  For the sauce I used Bertolli Organic Tomato and Basil and another reviewer suggested...and it was delicious!  I'd absolutely make this again.  And the leftovers were even better than the night before!

My whole family liked this.  The cream cheese mixture is wonderful.  The only change I made was using Italian Sausage in place of ground beef (I was out of grnd beef.)  I think next time I might try adding some chopped black olives, too.  The leftovers went quickly, too. This would be awesome fora potluck as it's wonderful hot out of the oven or lukewarm or cold!

I switched the garlic powder to 2 cloves of garlic, switched the green to red pepper, and added a quarter of a small onion.  Very tasty!  In addition, it froze well.  Yum!

Finally, a baked spaghetti I like!  Except, I LOVE this!  The only changes I made were that I added more sauce and a container of cottage cheese with the cream cheese.  (And I excluded the green onions, since I didn't have any.)  Mmmmm, yummy!  :)

Yummy!!! I omited the green onions and peppers just because of family members preferences but it was delicious! Also, buttered the noodles slightly as some recommended and it was great! Also used a mexican cheese blend, as we like a mixture, will make it often! Thanks!

This was really good. I did not have a green pepper, so that was omitted. I also buttered my noodles as others have suggested, and used some parmesan cheese. Definetly one to make again.

Great, simple, good weeknight dinner.  I added some crushed red peppers and olive oil to the pasta before baking.  I also used a cup of light sour cream and no cream cheese.  came out excellent!

This version of spaghetti pie with the sour cream and cream cheese was just too rich for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love the taste of both sour cream and cream cheese, but combined with pasta (filling), ground beef (also filling) and topped with cheddar, it is just too much.

My hubby and kids liked this one.  Personally I thought it was dry.  I will make this again, per my hubby's request.  Next time I will just have extra sauce on the side for me! :)  I did follow the recipe exactly.

Very good for dinner and leftovers.  I also added cheese butter and 2 eggs to the pasta.  If I make it again I will omit the green onions from the cream cheese mixture.

Wasn't really fond of this one. Not sure what it was, but the flavors just didn't blend well for us. Not sure I will make it again.

The family didn't go crazy over this. It was the sour cream that they didn't like so much. I did as others suggested, mix the pasta with butter & grated cheese, that was good. Added ricotta to the cheese mixture(if I didn't have the ricotta in it I wouldn't have like it at all)

Simply tasty! I've made this several times now and I still love this dish.  I love it the way it is, but I've also added things, like diced tomatoes, extra cheese and minced garlic. I also use penne pasta or macaroni pasta instead. This reminds me of the beef-a-roni that was served when I was in elementary school.  Serve this with yeast rolls and a yummy salad!

Great recipe. Did make a few changes that other reviewers had made. I added the meat and sauce to the spaghetti. I layered the cream cheese mixture and then the cheddar cheese. My picky teenage daughter loved it and thats a plus!

Great with a few changes. Use a high quality flavorful spaghetti sauce; I suggest one with Italian sausage. I combined the pasta and sauce which made it very moist and no dry noodles on the bottom. I added a chopped whole onion & one tsp minced garlic and sauted that before browning the beef.

This was very yummy.  I 1/2'd it and added a lil more sauce (after reading other reviews) as well as some Italian Sausage I needed to use up.  I didn't have any green bell on hand and did not add green onions, however, added celery and onions to hamburger cooking mixture.  Six-year old who doesn't like traditional "spaghetti" loved it.  Will make again :)  Thank you!

This was a little dry.  Next time I will mix everything together and then top with cheese.  I will also change the onions.  I did not like the green onions in this. I will also not put in as many green peppers.  It was too overpowering.  Seemed to take over the dish.  Great starter though to play with. This did make a "huge" amount.  So, plan on leftovers.

I softened the cream cheese by putting on low in microwave for about a minute. Next time I probably would put just a bit more sauce, but my family really liked as is and says it's a keeper. A good recipe for beginning cooks. I don't think you can go wrong with it. You can add a bit more cheese on top if you like; I used 2 cups

My family loves this recipe.  I've been making this for awhile now and I'm going to try it with mozzarella tonight.  We love the cream cheese in this rather than similar recipes with cottage cheese because it doesn't end up watery.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Will make again!  If your family loves spaghetti but you want to make it a little different- then this is for you.  The cream cheese and sour cream add a nice flavor.  I used mozzarella cheese on top.

I loved this recipe.  My kids hated it.  I made it exactly as written using whole grain spaghetti noodles.  Wonderful flavor.  Since I was the only one who would eat it I froze the leftovers in single serving size and it is terrific.

Easy to make, tastes great and reheats well for excellent leftovers!!  I used only 3/4 lb pasta based on previous reviews and glad I did.  My kids liked the recipe with cream cheese and sour cream instead of the ricotta alternative.

I had some left over spaghetti, and was looking for a way to make a second meal out of it.  I put the spaghetti already mixed with the sauce in the bottom of dish then toped it with the sour cream, cream cheese and green onion mix.  I toped it off with mozzarella cheese.  It came out great, everyone had seconds.  Next time i will try the original recipe.

A good, easy, hearty dinner.

Not gourmet fare but it was yummy.  My kids actually both had seconds, and they are picky eaters.  

My daughter did say she didn't like it "a lot" but she virtually never finishes what she is given, let alone ask for more so this is a definite make again for our family.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular. I prefer more sauce.  Kind of bland, and all the cream cheese did was make it a creamy sauce. I might play with it a bit. Noodles need to be cut and also maybe put something to bind them

Really great. I changed it just a little, omitted the green pepper and added a tablespoon of tomato paste. I also increased the spaghetti sauce since previous reviews mentionned there was too much pasta. Next time, I might reduce the sour cream a little and increase the cream cheese. Overall, great! My husband hates leftovers but I made this 2 days ago and its just about done.

I used a bit less spaghetti & more sauce.  Still a bit dry - so I would use more sauce next time or perhaps layer differently.  Took it to a sick friend whose entire family loved it (3 kids - ages 8, 6 & 3).  Easy to make - great to take.

I just did ground beef with my regular spaghetti sauce instead of the bellpeppers and all that.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a good addition to our family's recipe rotation.  Thanks!

We liked the recipe however, 1lb of pasta is way too much.  We will be cutting it in half next time - very easy and tasty!
