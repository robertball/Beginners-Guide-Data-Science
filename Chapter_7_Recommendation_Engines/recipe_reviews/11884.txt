the sauce was good, a bit on the bland side, so  i added thyme, basil leaves, italian seasoning, rosemary and some diced onions to give it a bit more of a punch in taste. Over all i would rate this a 4 star recipe.

A garlic lovers delight. This is the best sauce I have ever made. It has made it into the recipe rotation and I have made it every week for the last month. Also very good on a meatball sandwich. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Quick, yummy spaghettis, with homemade 
sauce.  Only eat on weekends, as garlic
is VERY strong!

Way too much oil, not enough other ingredients.  I would at least add a can of tomatoes and some other spices such as red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, basil, and/or italian seasoning.

I was looking for a quick, easy meal tonight. This was perfect - very easy and quick to make. I added a bit less of the butter and olive oil, added extra garlic and loads of parm. Even Jamieson loved it. It was so good!

I thought the pasta was too oily and didn't have much flavor.  Won't be making it again.

This sauce is really good for how basic the recipe is. I served this with Johnsonville Italian Meatballs from this site. The two paired nicely together. I did use angel hair in place of the spaghetti noodles. My daughter prefers bland food, so this was prefect for my family.

It was oily and I think that we should use a little less oil and add some sausage. Over all it was a very good dinner and didnt take very long to make.
