I added 1/2 cup of mushrooms and no peppers bc I didn't have any. The turkey came out dry and flavorless. If you're gonna try this I suggest you double the spices. I however didnt make the glaze. Will try that with the left overs. I didnt see or taste the point of the apple juice in the meat mixture.

I have made this several times and it always come out delicious.  I deleted the green pepper and increased the onion and mushrooms by the 1/4 cup green pepper deleted.  I also use about 3/4 pound of turkey meat.

No Maloxx needed for this recipe! My reputation has been enhanced by the addition of this wonderful meat loaf. I have destroyed my former reciped called The Maloxx special. Thanks to you I can cook again.  What's the next great recipe?

Used this recipe as a base, but changed it up a bit.    Doubled the recipe, used chopped fresh spinach instead of green peppers (about 4 or 5 oz)  and added an egg and 2 slices of bread (crumbled) to make it more meatloaf-y.  Also added 1/2 tsp rubbed sage for more flavor.  Cooked it in a loaf pan.  Came out super moist and delicious!  The glaze was great on it, I added some chicken stock to it because it came out too thick (when you recalculate to 4 servings it tells you to use 1/4 c cornstarch- too much!!!)  I think the stock actually really helped boost the flavor of the glaze, too; I thought it was a little flat before.  Couldn't have turned out better though!
