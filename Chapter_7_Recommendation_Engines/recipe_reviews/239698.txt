I love glazed nuts, and I love walnuts, so I was hoping for something unique and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, and honestly, I wished for something to come through.  The coating and the oven time made the walnuts crunchy, but I wished for more flavor of some kind.  I didn't really detect garlic, sweetness or rosemary, so perhaps the proportions need help.  This is an unusual combination, so perhaps some tweaking would benefit.

Pretty tasty overall, nice change to my plain handful of walnuts snack. Too much salty probably would cut it down to 1/4 teaspoon or leave out completely. I also added thyme.
