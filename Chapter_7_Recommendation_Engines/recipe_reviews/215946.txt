Now that Campbellâ€™s uses partially GMO ingredients I was looking for something different... the bread crumbs in the mix made a nice texture & they were nice & creamy... everyone loved this recipe.  Progressive for the win!

Progresso Cream of Mushroom tastes so much better than Campbell's. This casserole is great following the original recipe, but I probably added more french onions than what was called for, 1 tbsp Worcestershire, added some cheddar cheese, and some seasonings (primarily garlic powder, salt, pepper). You might think the bread crumbs aren't needed but they seriously are, it thickens the soup making the dish wonderfully creamy. Dish was inhaled. As for another review that said they don't use GMO's, I checked my can and apparently they do now, disappointing for me because I am not pro-GMO but can't seem to escape them so I still use GMO products, at least until my heirloom garden comes in.

yummy. I used seasoned bread crumbs and it tasted fine. I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the mix, as well as on top when you add more onions on top, towards the end.

The dish was delicious! I made a few modifications. I did not add soy sauce, I added a bit of milk just enough for a creamier texture. I crunched up some of the crispy onions and mixed it through the casserole and then added a layer on top with some bread crumbs.

This was a hit with the family! I used fresh green beans because that's what I had.
