So good with some changes. As writen, theyre not sweet enough. For the cream cheese filling, use 1/2 cup confectioners sugar instead of 1/4. For the muffin batter add 1/4 cup granulated sugar (in additition to the original 1/2 cup brown sugar). Also use 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/3. With these changes, its a perfect muffin. Tip: dont be shy with the cream cheese/jam filling. Lots is good!

Great concept for a muffin, but the batter does need a bit of work as it is a bit bland as it - I added 1/2 cup of white sugar in addition to the brown and creamed the sugars with 1/2 cup of Land O lakes lite butter until lite and fluffy then added the egg.  I also used 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of lemon extract.  The cheesecake mixture is excellent - I used 3/4 of an 8 oz. package and 1/2 c. of confectioners' sugar.  I always line my bakeware with Pam for baking to help with taking/popping things out when done.  Don't overfill or you'll have a mess on your hands!  Overall, very good and I can't wait to try these with other types of jams....

Yummmmmmmy!!!! That sums it up! I got this recipe from a friend and thought I would try it out! The kids love these muffins!!!!!!!!!!! They are totally scrumptious! A little tedious to make, but well worth the time and effort. Next time, I am using muffin liners as they are a bit messy to get out of the pan without!!

This muffin is the best!  The cream cheese/jam filling is to die for.  (note - only use 1/2 tablespoon cream cheese for each muffin).

I loved these muffins- though they weren't what I'd been attempting to re-create from the kind I'd tasted at a bakery.  The lemon zest adds a wonderful flavor.  I created six giant muffins instead of twelve smaller ones and they came out looking great... the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because they were more dry than I'd hoped for- definately will make another batch sometime though.

Mine overflowed the first time. I would put less batter in the bottom of the cups next time.  Slightly strange aftertaste.

I made these last night on a whim.  I found them very easy to make.  The muffin is not very sweet.  I used strawberry pie filling instead of jam and creamed it with the cheese and sugar, it was delicous.  I think next time I will add 1/2 c regular sugar and see if that helps.  The great thing is this is a basic muffin recipee. You could negate the cream filling and put about anything in these muffins.

I looked at this recipe and just loved the combination of muffin and cheesecake but I was totally unimpressed with the finished result.  I did not like the taste, look or texture of these muffins. Extremely disappointing as they do take a little time to assemble.  Certainly will not make these again.

These were nice for something different, and would be the sort of thing to impress at bake sales/family gatherings, though they aren't quite as hard as they seem. The dough is a little sticky to work with, but the cream cheese/strawberry middle is delicious! I used fresh strawberries via the *Supreme Strawberry Topping* recipe from this site. I could almost imagine mixing blueberries into the batter also for a Fourth of July patriotic treat!

These were pretty good, but didn't have enough strawberry flavor in the batter for me. I would add some fresh diced strawberries to the batter and forget the jam. They would be excellent lemon cream cheese muffins as well if you doubled the lemon zest and added a little lemon extract.

These did not work out for me....  I'm a pretty good baker (quoting others) & I barely had enough batter to put a bottom layer for 12 muffins.  The measurements seem way off!  I ended up using 8 oz of cream cheese & for the topping I combined brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, quick oats & butter.  They came out O. K....  However I won't be making them again.  I'm glad many others are happy with the recipe.  I wish I could have given a better review.

Not sure what I did wrong or if they are supposed to be like this. They tasted like pancakes more than muffins. I made these for Valentines day and usually my desserts get eaten up... these stayed around for a few days.

If i could give 6 stars or more, I would.  These were sooo delicious and I got tons of compliments on them!  I like baked good fresh out of the oven and this was amazing.  Quick, easy, and tastes really good...can't beat that!

Muffin itself is bland. I had hoped that the cream cheese mixture in the baked muffin would be creamier. The only part I liked was the homemade strawberry jam.

The flavors in this recipe are good, but the ingredient quantities are way off. 
1) not enough cream cheese/confectioner's sugar mixture
2) when the dry and wet ingredients are combined, the batter has a bread dough consistency, not runny like muffin batter. I tried adding more milk and an extra egg, but that didn't help. Once cooked, the muffin part was a very dense bread texture. My guess (without trying the recipe again) would be too much flour.
Probably wont try this again as there is too much guess work to it.

I too added more sugar to the recipe, as recommended and they were a huge hit!

Also, I skipped the lemon zest.... and instead of regular milk I used Almond Milk. It gave it a nice little effect :)

Excellent!!! Exactly what I hoped for. I agree, they are not too sweet, but easy to fix that by adding more sugar or sweetener (like I did). Inside muffins are moist and airy, really delicious. Definitely saving this recipe.

These are yummy!  Kind of painstaking to get the portions right but worth the effort.  I followed ashleynicole's suggestions to make things a bit sweeter and I was glad I did, they came out just right!  The only thing was that I think mine could have baked another 5 minutes or so, possibly due to the additional melted butter and sugar.  We'll be having these again - thanks for the post!

Nice quick recipe with on-hand ingredients!  I whipped this one up real quick when I had sudden company coming with coffee. Next time, I would: add simple cinnamon & sugar topping, or a crumb topping for more flavor.  I'd use 6 oz. of cream cheese, and a generous tablespoon of jam instead of a teaspoon. These muffins aren't overly sweet, which I like!  Otherwise, excellent!

my co-workers loved them. i used the original recipe and forgot the lemon, no big deal. i thought the dough was too doughie, but no one else complained. i made a double batch & felt like i didn't have enough cream cheese filling would def make more of that & use more sugar like previous reviewers have said. my first muffins though, and would try again!

These muffins were perfect!  I took them on a camping trip and everyone loved them.  I also liked that they weren't too sweet but just right.  I will definitely make these again.

The muffins didn't have much taste.
I will try it again but I will put more lemon zest, sugar and will put the filling more to the bottom (this time a lot of the jam came out while I was baking them).

Not at all what I expected.  I made these for a shower thinking that they would be a nicer, fancy muffin.  The texture of the muffin was almost like a biscuit - not the moist, cake-like muffin I was wanting - and  it had almost no flavor.  Many people at the shower commented that these were not sweet enough.  The cream cheese and strawberry filling was the only tasty part of this muffin.  I'm planning to try a different muffin batter with this filling in the future.

Not gross.  Not delicious.  Not worth the effort.  Don't skip the lemon zest; it's the only thing that makes the muffin tasty.

took a little longer than usual to make, but more interesting that mix and pour muffins. jam spills over the top, try putting a piece of aluminum foil underneath to avoid a messy oven. smells good, tastes even better, yummy!

I doubled everything, since... Well... Strawberries and cream cheese:-) the first lot I made with extra sugar following the instructions exactly, and it was messy. I used silicon moulds, but I can see it getting stuck in pans. The second lot I mixed the cream cheese mixture with the strawberry jam, much less mess. They don't brown, though.

I don't do a lot of baking, but things usually come out fine. I questioned the use of 1 TBSP of baking powder as excessive, but followed the recipe. These came out super heavy and dense, with not enough sweetness in the batter. I used homemade raspberry jam instead of strawberry, for full disclosure, but I don't think the fruit would have mattered. These were sadly too heavy & lacking sweetness to enjoy.

Festive and easy to make.  I did find that the recipe made 16 good-size muffins or they would have overflowed the muffin tins.  The lemon zest added just the right tang to them.  In a word, Delish!

Pretty easy, but yes, heavy on the steps.  I did add more sugar to the cream cheese filling and perhaps a bit more jam than called for--the best way to keep these from sticking is to use liners and also make sure that the jam stays in the middle of the muffin--too much on the sides and it will overflow and make a big mess.  I doubled this recipe and ended up with more cream cheese filling than I needed. I thought they were a tad sweet but hubs thought they were good.  They turn out pretty cute but don't brown much on top if you bake at 350, which is what I did because I didn't pay attention to the oven temp until after I'd put the muffins in.  The timing was still 20 mins at 350 though.  Thanks for the recipe!

These weren't sweet enough... I think there should've been a  graham cracker topping or SOMETHING, it just wasn't was I was hoping. I wouldn't make them again...

I messed these up a little and they were still delicious! After I had put the first Batch in, I noticed that I forgot the butter. So I added half of it to the batter I had left and the other half to the muffins I had just put in and stirred it a bit. They still tasted great! I added extra sugar here and there, taking heed to other reviews and although they were a little too sweet, I think that was my fault. I may have put too much jam in it (I had a sweet tooth.lol) also, i used the extra big muffin tins (6 cups to a pan) and it was just enough for that so I can imagine how much extra would have been leftover for a regular size muffin pan! Other than that, these muffins were great. I loved how they still tasted like muffins, but also tasted like strawberry cheese cake. I also loved the texture. With those few changes, I will definitely be making these again!

These sounded like a great idea but the muffin part was bland and the jam melted out all over the place.  Measurements for jam and cheese should be halved.  Look so yummy, but are disappointing

Decent dessert; 3/5 stars.  Followed the suggestions and increased the sugars in the recipe:  1/2 c confectioner, 1/4c white, increased butter to 1/2 c.  I think the increase in butter was a little too much since it made my pastries oily.  I don't think I will be making these again.
