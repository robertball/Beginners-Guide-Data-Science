First off, I cut the recipe in half as I only had 1 1/2 lbs. of 16/20 size shrimp. Not quite sure why this was titled Lemon Ginger Shrimp as neither flavor stood out. Instead this marinade was a GREAT fusion of flavors. The best I've tried in a very long time! Instead of skewering them, I grilled the shrimp in a Brookstone Quick Release BBQ Skillet ...This is a shallow, nonstick grilling skillet with plenty of small holes to let that great grilled flavor through! To me, the ingredients really said 'green onion/scallion' and not regular onion so that's what I used. I marinated the shrimp for 5 hours. Our family's only problem was that there wasn't nearly enough of them, and there were only 3 of us for dinner! Absolutely outstanding flavor with that hint of grilled smokiness to them. Can't wait to make it again!

To die for!!  I was lazy on this one - I didn't feel like chopping an onion, so I used 2 Tbl. minced (dry) onions, and didn't puree the ingredients.  I wouldn't change a thing next time!  I also pan-fried my shrimp instead of grilling - cooked about 2 minutes on each side, on med. high heat.  The second time I made this, I marinated overnight.  Although the flavor was wonderful, it made the shrimp turn a little mushy, so I won't do that again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great recipe. Quick to make.  I added 1/4 cup of bourbon whisky to the marinade to add some more zip.  It was delicious.  I will be sharing this recipe with others.  Thanks, Zuzka!

These are absolutely wonderful. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I've already made them twice this week! The first time I cooked these, I cooked them on the grill. The second time, I cooked them on the george foreman - and they came out just as good! I also tried the marinade on asparagus - they were wonderful! I am going to try the marinade on chicken and salmon at a later date. I imagine those will be heavenly too!

I eliminated the onion and garlic (for allergies) and and barbequed these on skewers with chunks of pineapple and served them on their own as appetizers. They were delicious and I wiil definitely serve them again.  A ginger and cilantro were nice fresh change from garlic.

Very good! I had a 1.5 pound of 16/20 count shrimp, that I cleaned and deveined. I followed the ingredients and directions as written. I marinated the shrimp for 3 hours and then put the shrimp on the skewers to grill. The grilling time was approximate and fast. I like the blend of flavors -ginger and sesame especially. This is not spicy and has nice subtle flavors. I served this along with, "Herbed Rice Pilaf," and "Fast and Easy Spinach with Shallots," also from this website.

I've been searching for this recipe for years! My favourite Japanese teppan restaurant serves this as the sauce in which to dip teppan shrimp - I love it! My husband likes it on his teppan steak, too. The only thing I changed was parsley instead of cilantro (can't stand cilantro!).Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I was so incredibley pleased with this dish. Even though I didn't follow the directions entirely it was still awesome. I was a little short on lemon juice, ran out of minced garlic and had to use powdered, only had a tiny but of onion to spare and apparenlty my cilantro plant died between the time that I found the recipe and now.... so you know it's good if it still tasted amazing after all of those screw ups.

These were wonderful!  Made recipe as is and dipped them in Tobasco chipolte sauce.  That and a frozen margarita on a hot summer day......doesn't get much better than that.  Can't wait to make these again!

We. Have. A. Winner. 
This is soooo good! Wow. I am going to have to control the urge to eat the leftovers BEFORE tomorrow's dinner. This dish is vibrant and flavorful. I paired it with Trader Joe's Confetti Rice (freezer). It was a delicious dinner and I will definitely make it again and again.

Made the marinade strictly following the recipe, but we had less shrimp. I was a bit concerned at first upon sampling before using it, as the onion/ginger flavors seemed to be overpowering. However, once used and grilled=HEAVENLY! This is definitely a bbq recipe: I'm sure it would be good stove-top, but that smoky flavor just compliments the marinade perfectly. We're going to use some of the extra tomorrow on some grilled salmon!

This was a fantastic dish, I served this with white rice and stir fried vegetables.  I left off the onion, used 4 cloves of garlic, and used minced ginger in a jar, my family really enjoyed this recipe, we are going to try chicken and salmon next time.

I thought this recipe was just ok, I only change one thing and that was, I used flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro. The shrimp tatsted nothing like lemon or ginger which I added extra. I guess that's the flavor I was looking for with the title and all. I did grill mine over charcoal and while they were good and I ate them. I will tweat this recipe next time (IF) I make them again.

Super Easy & Very Tasty  I made this twice already and it's a huge hit. I made it once accouring to directions. The second time I had to sub dry ginger and dried cilantro leaves and it still came out great. The only thing I did was reduce some of the olive oil.  Also great on chicken.

This was amazing!  We did add a little extra ginger and garlic and we served it cold on a bed of shredded napa cabbage, sprinkled with seseame seeds, garnished with mandrine oranges and sliced almonds

Made this yesterday for a "Mom's Day" bbq.  When my brother went in to make a plate for his wife to take home they were all gone.  Wonderful flavor.  Only change I made was to use 1 tbl of soy instead of the 1/2 of salt.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks.

The flavor of the shrimp was not overpowered by the marinade, and two hours marinating was perfect for us.  I followed the recipe with the exception of scaling the recipe down to 1 pound of shrimp, switching dried ginger for fresh, and omitting the cilantro because I dislike it.  Despite my changes, this marinade was still very good.

This was the BEST barbecued shrimp ever.  I made the marinade exactly as written except I substitued green onions for the regular onions - it just seemed to fit the flavor profile better.  This will be my go-to recipe for grilled shrimp from now on.  I might just have to make it again next week - or maybe tomorrow.

I used frozen shrimp and some changes based on what I had and this was EXCELLENT. Substituted peanut oil because that is what I had- no sesame. THen I used green onion- one bunch, about 5 and used only one half  of each because it was in the frigde. Let is sit overnight. Loved it, will make again. Could experiment with a little coconut milk to make a sauce. GREAT.

This was pretty good.  There were a few things we would change about it- there was not much of a ginger flavor.  Overall, it was pretty good.  I served it with a lemon-ginger rice that I concocted, and it was a pretty good match!  I'll make it again, with more ginger.

Everyone loved these!!  I had medium size shrimp and some of them were starting to get mushy after 2 hours of marinading.. but they were still scrumptious.

I marinated the shrimp overnight and followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it tasted bland.  The lemon and ginger flavors get lost in the olive oil.  Will not be making this again.

This was really good. I threw this together and grilled it on the George Foreman, and served with some pasta and homemade sauce. I will not use ginger next time. I have used this in several recipes lately and they all seem to have this wierd taste mixed in there.. I believe it is the ginger that I am not likeing. I would also maybe baste this with some butter afterward it has grilled or maybe dip it in melted butter while eating. Still good just missing something in the end.

This was excellent. Not too spicy, not too tangy, but the perfect blend of both. I used gemelli pasta and wouldn't change a thing if I made it again. I wondered about substituting rice for the pasta after reading other reviews and really I love rice, but after trying it as the recipe states, I decided this is definitely a pasta dish.

We liked this recipe.  My husband liked it more than I did, so it might be a matter of taste.  We like grated ginger, so I added extra and was glad I did.

Good shrimp and easy recipe, but I agree with the others than the lemon or ginger don't really stand out as flavors so if that is what you are expecting you may be disappointed.

yum yum and more yum!!  the only thing that i would change about this recipe is depending on how strong your garlic is and how much you like the odour.. I would cut that to 1 clove.  After the marinating the flavours are right in those prawns.  Great left overs if you can keep from eating them all!!

The first time I tried this recipe I wasn't too sure about it.  The next time I used less lemon and added soy sauce and honey to the recipe and then marinated.  I also made a dipping sauce with soy sauce, white wine vinegar, honey, ginger, and scallians.  It was delicious.

I used this recipe the next day for a cold dish on a picnic.  Everybody loved it.  Instead of messing with the skewers/BBQ I just sauteed the shrimp on my flattop grill (you could use a nonstick frypan easily - no oil required because of the marinade), and refrigerated.  There was no extra marinade though for basting, but the shrimp didn't need it.  They were juicy and delicious.

It was my first time to try to recipe last Dec 7th at my Birthday party.  The shrimps were a big hit the moment it came off the grill!  The shrimps were gone before it could cool down!  My friends were immediately asked me for the recipe!  I would make this again!  It tastes so good, yet it was so easy to make!  THANKS FOR SHARING!

This marinade is a winner.  Wouldn't change a thing!  You may want to add some red pepper pieces on the skewers, it really adds color to the dish.  I served the shrimp on rice pilaf.

I did not follow this recipe exactly, I used it more as  a guide and didn't measure anything, and the results were amazing!! What a great combination of flavors, I couldn't stop licking my fingers while I was threading the shrimp (and fresh pineapple) onto skewers (raw shrimp!!) it was that good. I will definitely be making this again. I also let these marinate for over 4 hours, which definitely helped to infuse all of these wonderful flavors into the shrimp. Thanks for a great recipe.

Left out the cilantro and used 2t powdered ginger instead of the fresh.  Sauteed in pan instead of grilling.  Marinated for about 24 hours.  Hubby said it was one of his best meals EVER!  Fast and easy!

This was very easy. It was also the best shrimp recipe I have had ... and I eat a lot of shrimp.  It is important not to over-cook, or the shrimp will get too dry.  I followed the recipe as written.

Excellent!  Not spicey, great complex subtle flavor to have with any fried rice side dish. Of course you have to be careful not to bbq shrimp for too long.  I am going to marinate my veggies in this the next time as well.  My only change was using red onions.

Very good. I halved the recipe and added 1/4 c water to mini chopper to make it more of a baste. I also did not have any cilantro but used fresh parsley. I used 1 lb shrimp and 2 steaks. Let the shrimp sit in 1/2 marinade for 3 hours then while grilling steak & shrimp I basted with the rest of the marinade.

I LOVED this recipe! Extremely easy to make if using the food processor. I didn't chop the onion, grate the ginger root, or mince the cilantro leaves. I let the processor do that. It worked great! I also couldn't grill so I broiled the shrimp in the sauce and turned the skewers once. No need to marinate. Delicious!

This was delicious! Like a previous reviewer said, no single taste stands out, but melts together into a great meal! I only used one pound of shrimp but also marinaded veggies (zucchini, mushrooms and green peppers) and grilled those on separate skewers (they take longer). Will be making this again.

Tasted good, but not outstanding. I changed the recipe to 1/3 (1 lb shrimp) using the Allrecipes converter. I followed the recipe except I omitted the salt, had to use powdered ginger, and broiled them in the oven.  The marinade seemed too thick, so I added extra olive oil.

Sodium warning:  My frozen shrimp came heavily salted -- I assumed they would be low sodium but it was quite the opposite. Even though I peeled and rinsed them, they tasted well salted at the end.

Yum!!  Did recipe as is and turned out great.  Not a big ginger fan however, this had just the right amount.  Just added it to my recipe box as a keeper.

I scaled this down to 1 lb of shrimp since that's all I had and the measurements were right on.  I'm not crazy about shrimp, but this was pretty good.  I also sprinkled in some spicy McCormick seasoning, since it's one of my husbands favorites, and that gave it a nice little zing. This was a nice combination of flavors.  Thanks Zuzka.

Very good. I marinated these overnight in a ziploc bag in the fridge, and  served it over a bed of garlic olive oil pasta mix.(a box of Pasta Roni, couldn't have been easier!)  My husband had 3 servings!  The second time I made it, I served over rice and made homemade pineapple salsa (pineapple, jalapenos, cilantro, red onion, lime juice, and salt and pepper) to go over top of it, and it was a hit!

Love, love, love this marinade.  I really need to try it on other meat/fish as well.  Followed the recipe exactly except I seriously reduced the amount of olive oil...for me it just wasn't necessary.  The flavour was incredible!  Have done this twice now...this is definitely something I would make for company.

Instead of grilling this, after marinating I threw it all in a skillet and sauteed until the shrimp was cooked.  This was pretty tasty, I omitted the ginger b/c I don't like ginger.  I'm not sure if I'm crazy about the taste of the sesame oil, next time I'll omit that and see if I like it better.

Lots of potential in this one. The sesame was a bit overpowering for my taste. I will make this again with less sesame oil and a bit more ginger.

This had a great taste. I wish I would have basted it more on the BBQ. I think the first 6-8 taste good. Then i just started getting sick of shrimp after the first 20 or so...otherwise great marinade

Excellent recipe.  I used garlic salt instead and it tasted very, very good.  Make sure to soak the skewers prior to grilling so they don't light on fire.  Wonderful dish - a big hit!

I really liked these, but my family was not as much of a fan.  Generally, the consensus was that they were ok.  To me, the gingery, hard-to-describe taste was delicious.  Definately have to bbq them to get the best results.  I scaled for 6.

This was a hit at the girls' night out I hosted at my house. I made the marinade earlier in the day and kept it in the fridge until it was time to marinate the shrimp. I skewered them 3 to a skewer to make appetizer sized portions. Everyone loved them!

I left out the cilantro (Hubby hates it) and added extra garlic.  Next time I would use the specified amount of garlic.  I marinated them overnight,  bbq-ed them on my grill, and everyone pronounced them great & asked for the recipe.  A definite "make again" dish.

I read this recipe this morning in the newsletter and I couldn't wait to try it.  I used salmon fillets instead of the shrimp and I marinated them all day.  They were fantastic!  The sesame oil was very flavorful without being overpowering.  My husband loved this and said that it was much better than any salmon he had ever eaten.  Next time I'll try it with shrimp.  I may even try it on top of a spinach salad as a dressing.  It's a definite "do again" recipe!

Loved this flavorful marinade for shrimp!  Hubs grilled to perfection.  I halved the recipe for a pound of jumbo shrimp.  I did sub Old Bay for the paprika and added a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce, too.  Definite do over, loved these tasty shrimps!

This was a great recipe!  I followed all of the directions, however I saved the leftover marinade.  I brought it to a boil and added some flour to thicken, it was perfect as a dipping sauce for the shrimp.  We will have this again.

So good!  When I made it, I used a bit more ginger than called for, because I love that flavor. I also used red onion (what I had on hand), which gave the marinade a strange pink color, but the flavor was spot on. I cooked the shrimp on the stove top--didn't need any additional oil to cook them in.  I think enjoyed the cold left-over shrimp even more the next day and wish I'd made more! Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe, which I'll definitely make again.

I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  The entire family of 5 discerning eaters enjoyed it and went back for seconds.  We felt that the whole white onion we used was too heavy handed. A single shallot or ¼ of a vidalia onion or scallions would have served better here. We will be adding Lemon and Lime juice the next time we make this. We will also add some  lime zest and double the ginger for more punch. However based on the families reaction I would say this is a pretty great base recipe.

Excellent flavor, will definitely do this one again - on the grill.  Followed the recipe ingredients exactly though just put all in the food processor without grating or mincing first.  Marinaded a pound of shrimp a bit more than an hour.  Sautéed shrimp w some reserved marinade on stove top and served over Israeli couscous.  The flavors mingled nicely without anything overpowering the whole.  Very good, yet simple recipe and would make for a company dinner.

Very flavorful!  Quick and easy to make!  I was a little short on time, so I didn't marinate the full 2 hours, and I got rained out, so I sauteed them with all of the sauce.  Served with angel hair and a nice salad, and it was a wonderful meal.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. Even made it with vegetable oil when I was out of olive oil and it was fine. I tend to add more lemon and ginger to the recipe. I like strong favors.

Thank you for a delicious recipe. I only made 1 pound of shrimp (that was a mistake!) I kept the marinade the same. I grilled these in my grill pan and they turned out great! I used some of the reserved marinade to season some rice and summer veges. It was a wonderful meal. I look forward to making it again! Thanks for sharing!

These might be the best shrimp I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing.  Normally I prefer a bold taste in food but the subtle flavors were delectable.  I served over a wide rice mix and it was outstanding.  I will definitely make again!

Don't marinate for 2 hours, you'll get rubbery shrimp.  1/2 hr - 1hr (depending on size of your shrimp) is plenty.  Didn't skewer them, cooked them on a grill pan (the kind with hole throughout the pan), just seemed easier.  Very tasty!

I guess I just don't care for dried out, tough-to-chew- shrimp. It was tasty, but i won't make it again. Prefer my shrimp moist-melt in your mouth...I did baste it often as was directed....BUT it was pretty dried out...Not the way we like it.

It's nothing spectactular.  I've had store bought marinades that were much better.  I was hoping, since there seemed to be a decent amount of ginger in the marinade that it would be more flavorful.  This basically tasted like some bland hummus with a little ginger in it.  I'm very disappointed.  The Organic Baja Lime Marinade from Annie's Naturals is far superior.

This was good, but I expected the flavor to be a bit more intense.  I marinaded the shrimp for 3 hours and then sauteed them.  Maybe I'll try again on the grill.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it sounds great and look forward to giving it a try. I am writing to let GRANDMAMUM know that cilantro is coriander here in Australia. 

In the states the leaves of the coriander plant are referd to as cilantro and the seeds (which are actually fruit segments) are called coriander.

unfortunately i agree with other reviewers that this was lacking in flavor. i even added more lemon juice, the lemon zest, and also some more salt. we ended up having to make a dippy sauce. i think the recipe is more of a 3.5 star. this would be a good foundation for a tasty dish.

Great recipe!  I had no leftovers. Eaters were angry they were all gone. I used a shallot and green onion instead of the onion and cilantro.  Marinade smelled heavenly.  Shrimp needed to be savored.  So delicious!

Marinated for 9 hrs. Put shrimp and all marinade in skillet with 1/8 cup beer and cooked. Served over Jasmine rice. Needed something with a crunch, so will steam broccoli and might add water chest nuts/bamboo shoots next time.  Outstanding!  Make sure to towel dry shrimp b4 adding marinade. I like a bit of heat so I added some red pepper flakes. Enjoy!

Loved it!  If you want to try this, do yourself a favor and just toss everything except the shrimp in the food processor or blender.  No need to grate the ginger, chop the onion, or prepare anything.  Just throw it all in there, and let it do the work for you.  My only tweak was to use smoked paprika, because shrimp cooks so quickly, and I wanted it to have a smoky taste.  Tasty, and I'm happy none of the flavors really "stood out".  Every now and then, I picked up the flavor of cilantro, but that's because I probably used a bit more than specified.  I will definitely do this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

tried this yesterday; Followed the recipe except I had to use powdered ginger as I had no fresh. I also added 2 TBS of Tequila. I left the lemon out and marinated for 8hrs...then added the lemon 1/2hr before I grilled them over charcoal. This was a very good marinade and I will keep it in my repertoire. I'm sure it would be better with fresh ginger.

Great marinade, super easy to prepare, and very tasty!  I made it without changing anything (except I used dried cilantro and I used a mini food chopper to chop the onion and garlic really fine--no blender involved), and divided it in half, split between shrimp and chicken kabobs. Everyone loved it, no leftovers!

YES I DO SEE this is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is very delicious. The next time I did it and I add it to my recipe box and to My Note: My family loved bouth ways, and I'll be making this a lot more. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is....I now have two ways to this. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. Now I can do my happy food dance!!  Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you and y'all!

Excellent! If they were chopped into chunks after cooking, they'd be be great for shrimp tacos.

For me, it wasn't supposed to have a predominant taste of ginger or lemon.  Everything is supposed to go together to make a delicious harmony.  I thought the marinade very good and the end result superb.  I intend to try this marinade with other meat. I loved the smell of sesame oil.

Excellent!  I added the bourbon whiskey as well, and it added quite a zip to the marinade.  Marinated for 4 hours, used reserved to baste and some on veggies. Over all, it was excellent, delish and easy.  thank you for sharing.

Tasted great. I forgot to baste the shrimp with the remaining sauce - still good :).

I made a shrimp butter with the shrimp shells/tails and butter (just melt the butter with the shells until the shells turn pink) - works great as a sauce over the rice/quinoa or as a dipping sauce for the shrimp.

Marinated as written with fresh lemon juice.  As I could not grill at the time, I cooked these in a non stick skillet.  They were tasty with a salad.
