I made this the night before. I switched the yogurt and milk amounts and used buttermilk. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. These puffed up nicely and were quite filling. I served them with Cinnamon Cream Syrup also from this site. Very good. We all liked these pancakes and the yogurt gave it a nice twang. I bet these would be good with blueberries. I'm glad I decided to switch the yogurt and milk amounts. I'm afraid the might not have been as good. This made 15 medium pancakes. NOTE: 1/3 c. of oatmeal is just what's in an envelope of instant oatmeal. If you are like me and buy it in bulk when it's on sale, you can use one of those.

Easy to make delicious pancakes!  I used only whole wheat flour, no all purpose flour to make these.

I've made this recipe several times and my family loves it. Great fluffy texture, and healthy! I love to mix up the batter the night before, stick in the fridge and then it's all ready to go for the morning! I do think it needs a bit of salt which is why I gave it 4 stars.

This is the best pancake recipe that I've ever made!  The only change I did was that I added a tsp and half of vanilla.  The oats are wonderful in here-- makes the pancakes so fluffy!

These were so light,fluffy and flavorful!  My husband and I loved them.  I used Greek yogurt, regular oatmeal and whole wheat pastry flour because I had these ingredients at home.  I added blueberries, artificial sugar and a little vanilla to suit our tastes.  My husband asked me to make these again, and that was a first!  I'm going to make a bunch and freeze them individually to keep on hand for busy mornings.  Thanks for a fantastic and healthy recipe!

The only things I changed in this recipe was omitting the all-purpose flour and using all whole wheat flour.  I used olive oil instead of canola and also added a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla.  These cooked up very light and were very filling.  This recipe is a keeper!

These pancakes were nice and fluffy!  I usually leave pancake batter rest a bit which I think helps.  I only had whole wheat pastry flour, but that seemed to work well.  I only had a half cup of plain yogurt so I used vanilla yogurt for the remaining cup.  For a bit more flavor, I added a couple tablespoons of sugar and used butter instead of oil. Because of the added sugar and vanilla flavor from the yogurt I did not use any syrup, I though they were great plain!

I love the use of whole wheat flour and oats, but these needed a pinch of salt! They tasted a tad bland. I've made these with apples and blueberries, and another batch with dried cranberries, walnuts and cinnamon.

AMAZING!  The best pancakes i've ever had anywhere!  These taste gormet and are healthy!  Big fan.  Thanks soooo much for posting this!  The only changes I made were to add 1 tsp of vanilla.  Cinnamon would be a nice addition too.

I played quite a bit with this recipe - but loved having it as a base. I used 1 cup Vanilla Yogurt, 1/2 cup Strawberry Banana, 1/4 cup whey (from our cheese making) and 1/4 cup Orange juice in place of milk. No oil. Spelt flour instead of wheat and added some cinnamon and frozen strawberries for excitement. They were a wonderful start to the day and I'm confident that even if made as written they would be delicious.

These came out perfect for our taste - fluffy (but not too filling), with a great texture from the oats; and they were just sweet enough. I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of vanilla yogurt, since that's all I had on hand. I think I'll continue that way next time since everyone enjoyed them so much.  I made them into silver dollar pancakes and my two-year-old gobbled them up without syrup! I served them with frozen berries that I had warmed. Delicious!

Instead of 4 tablespoons of oil, I used just 1 plus 2 tablespoons of light margarine and these were perfect. We loved the taste and the texture and they were less than 50 calories each made this way.

Very good pancakes, the oats made the pancakes fluffier but didn't change the taste. I used 2 cups of soy milk, and had to skip the yoghurt completely because of lactose intolerance. I made 4 thick medium sized pancakes with the resulting batter. Thanks for sharing.

Great cakes.  I am always using yogurt instead of buttermilk so it was great to find a recipe that had yogurt in it at the beginning.

Great recipe! In my quest for healthier pancakes without sacrificing tast, I made the following changes: 1/2 c. whole wheat flour 1/2 c. oats 1/3 c. oat flour (use coffee grinder) 1/3 c. white flour 1 Tbl. ground flax seed  (coffee grinder) 1 Tbl oil 3 Tbl plain unsweetened applesauce  Everything else remained the same. They rose nicely and were delicious. Next time I might add a tbl of high gluten flour or spelt flour to get a bit more loft.

Creamy? These pancakes turned out creamy for me, I did substitute sour cream for plain yogurt and added some brown sugar. The kids didn't complain but they didn't go fast and the texture was creamy... :)

These pancakes came out so light and fluffy!  I substituted safflower oil for canola.  Also used nonfat milk. This is our new favorite pancake recipe.
