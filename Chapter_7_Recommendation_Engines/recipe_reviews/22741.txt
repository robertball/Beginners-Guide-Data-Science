The spring rolls recipe as published was OK but I couldn't help doctoring them up to make them outstanding  :-)!  I used napa cabbage, frozen tiny steamed shrimp (canned is yuckky), and matchstick carrots.  I also added shredded poached chicken breast, matchstick red peppers and cilantro.  I didn't measure these but just threw in what I had -- that's the beauty of these:  experiment!  For dipping sauce, I used hoisin sauce, Thai sweet chili sauce and a soy/ginger sauce.  The recipe made almost 50 spring rolls and they disappeared from the platter in less than 10 minutes at my brother's wedding reception!  By the way, I made these the night before, laying them on a platter scattered with shredded napa cabbage.  I covered them with damp paper towels and then shrouded the whole thing with foil.  They were PERFECT the next day!

Have made these for two Xmas parties this season
both times eaten  in an hour.
I added some bean sprouts and used real shrimp. I used Thia sweet chili sauce as my sweet and sour.
what I like about this recipe is that you have a base to start with but you can add anything that you like. Thanks Rayna

WE REALLY LIKED THESE, I USED A BAG OF FROZEN COCKTAIL SHRIMP, NAPA CABBAGE, MUSHROOMS.  TURNED OUT VERY WELL.  TO SOAK THE RICE WRAPPERS, BE VERY CAREFUL.  TOO LONG WILL MAKE THEM LIKE GLUE BALLS, TOO SHORT WILL MAKE THEM LIKE BENDING CARDBOARD.  BY THE TIME I ROLLED ONE AND HAD 1 IN THE WATER SOAKING, THE NEXT 1 WAS READY TO BE ROLLED OUT.  USE WARM WATER TOO.

Didn't care for this though I added cilantro to give it a little something. The taste of the canned shrimp couldn't be masked. Won't make  again.

These were perfect after a little doctoring up.  I didn't use shrimp, instead I used well chopped stir fry chicken with thai chili sauce and sweet and sour.  This was the first time I've tried making Spring Rolls.  These were easy and delicious!!

You must make the dipping sauce recommeded by others.  2 parts hoisin sauce to 1 part chunky peanut butter.  Heat on the stove until mixed and add a bit of water to thin.  Delicious reason to eat the spring rolls.

Love Em! They are so FAST & EASY! They are also flexible; you can add & take away ingredients and jazz them up. I use Hoisen Sauce or spicy chili sauce, add cilantro, and I use steamed shrimp... These are delicious!

I found this recipe to be a great starting place. I added some mint, cilantro and mushroom. Turned out great. I must have made the rolls to big because only ended up with 8 rolls.

I WAS VERY EXCITED TO MAKE HOMEMADE SPRING ROLLS FOR MY HUSBAND BUT WAS DISSAPOINTED HOW THEY TURNED OUT. I MADE A PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE FOR THEM BUT THE WHOLE THING WAS A DISASTER. I REALLY DON'T THINK I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN.

This really was not what I was expecting at all.  My friend and I tried this recipe one night and were disappointed with the results.  However, they did taste a little better after we fried them.

Great recipe, I did everything as advised except that I added bean sprouts and used whole cooked shrimp (frozen not canned). I also made a batch of dynamite sauce recipe and served with the rolls. You can make them the night before and leave in an air tight container and they stay perfect.

Great base recipe ~ Could use a little more flavor. I'm going to try grilling my shrimp first. These are my Mom's favorites and she ate them up!!  Tks for giving me the courage to try making my own.

I made mine with cabbage, cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts and shitake mushrooms for a real veggie spring roll. I did not add shrimp. I serve with the Ginger People Sweet Chili Sauce from Whole Foods. Very good with homeade sushi.

They were alright. I took out the celery and added cucumber and rice. I also used frozen shrimp instead of canned. After I doctored them up it was good.

I need more practice on rolling the rice noodles. Mine fell apart making it difficult to eat. I am sure it is good, just need to improve my skills I guess.

I didn't like these at all!!  I Made them for a family party...but No one liked them.  iI did use frozen salad shrimp instead of the canned, and it was still gross.
