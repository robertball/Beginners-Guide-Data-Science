I liked using Cardamom in a recipe.  Along with the Dates, walnuts and sesame seeds, this is not like any other cookie recipe that I've had.  However, It lacks a few traditional cookie elements (salt, leavening agent), which makes it taste more like an unfinished, flat-tasting cookie than anything.

If I try making this cookie again, I will likely add some salt and baking soda, along with some other additions and subtractions to change the consistancy of the dough and to make these taste more like a truely finished cookie than my current product.

I would recommend this recipe to those who like to twick there recipes into their own, as this recipe has a lot of possibilies . . .

Although I think the name is a bit exagerrated, these are quite good. They are not too sweet and I didn't feel as guilty eating 4 in a row, warm from the oven as I would chocolate chip cookies, because they are so nutrient dense. They aren't your traditional American cookie, but if you like cardamom and dates, it's a good one to try. All I did differently was to substitute pecans for the walnuts. I think they tasted best eaten warm the same day.
