As with any recipe we try, myself included,  we have high hopes for its outcome.   This, unfortunately, was one of the rare occasions I was let down.   The batter looked good, but when I topped it with the filling I should have trusted  my instincts and stopped when I saw enough was enough (about halfway through).   I also had a sudden memory of a similar cake I tried from this site, remembering the cake was  basically ruined by an excess of this same kind of filling.  I carried on, using the full amount of filling, and shouldn't have.  The cake didn't bake properly, even caving somewhat.  At least that will not be seen when the cake is turned over,  I thought.  But I knew it was caving for a reason.  Cutting into it, my fears were realized - there was far too much filling, not just from a taste perspective,  but it was just too much for the cake to handle.  It made the cake too heavy, almost wet,  and too sweet - not to mention unattractive.  Years ago Hubs wisely told me that if I'm not enjoying a book I shouldn't force myself to read it, as there are so many more books I'd enjoy better and never enough time to read them all.  For similar reasons with this cake,  I did not keep it.

I seldom rate 5 Stars on a recipe but this one deserves it. I do not know why the single reviewer had a problem with the filling because it was obvious from the recipe that the filling was perfectly balanced-not too little, not too much, which made me want to try it.  I had enough faith in it that I made it for a coffee club meeting at my house.  The tang from the rhubarb and the sweet from the filling made this one of the best cakes I have ever made! All of the ladies wanted the recipe and spent several minutes discussing why the review was so horrible when the cake is so superb.  They decided it was either an amateur cook or a bad oven because the cake was moist not wet, it rose beautifully and the cinnamon sugar dusted on top was the perfect finish.  

My husband is not a big sweet eater but he asked me to save him some just from the smell of it baking. After tasting he asked me to hold on to this recipe as he would ask for it again.

I made this cake and I did a bit of a change. This is how I make all my cakes, cookies etc that add fruit to them or nuts. I took the rhubarb and added some of the flour to it and mixed it really well into the rhubarb, or nuts or raisins for instance...this makes the rhubarb not sink to the bottom of the batter. Try this if you make this cake an remember to do it with anything that calls for raisins or nuts...It makes a big difference to how the cake bakes up.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I substituted pecans for walnuts because I like them better. This is a wonderful treat. I didn't find the filling to be off at all, and the cake is wonderful and moist. My only mistake is that I made it in a bundt pan instead of a tube pan, and I wouldn't do that again because the fruit stuck to the pan. This is definitely a keeper and I'm glad to find such a great recipe to use up the rhubarb in my yard.

Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture here, but it was still quite yummy. My mom liked it and she doesn't like rhubarb. My advice would be to grease the pan super well! With cinnamon and sugar on the bottom of the pan mine didn't pop out very well. Otherwise the recipe worked well and everything tasted great.

I don't know what I did wrong as I followed the recipe closely.  It was heavy---too much "filling"" which made the bottom of it gooey.  The only thing I can figure out is that I used the first rhubarb of the Spring which has lots of water in it.

This recipe is great!  I had some frozen rhubarb that I just drained the liquid from once it thawed and it turned out great. I also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts, just because thatâ€™s all I had. Moist and crunchy at the same time- delicious!

This turned out wonderfully! Used a Bundt pan and baked for about 50-55 minutes.  Not sure why some had an issue.  Wrong pan used, maybe?  

This would be great with Granny Smith apples (for the tart/tangy) if rhubarb is unavailable.

Turned out well - lots of flavor. We didn't think it was too sweet.

It was excellent! Followed the recipe. The only change was that I did not use about 3 table spoons of the sugar filling, it seemed to be too much. The cake was moist and perfect! I had a bit of cream cheese frosting, I thinned that a bit and put it on top as a glaze, delicious! This is a keeper!

Didn't change anything but next time will make sure not to put the streusel close to the metal sides as after the recommended 10 minute rest when I turned the cake out it was stuck and came apart in some spots.  But very delicious.

This recipe is great!  Wouldn't change anything taste wise.  I need to figure out a way to get it out of the pan though!  I waited the 10 minutes and tried to invert it to the serving platter and it just dumped out!  My husband and friends still loved it and instead of cake I served it as rhubarb bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream.  They loved it!

I liked it and made a few changes to make it diabetic friendly and a wee bit more heart healthy. I used splenda for the sugars (white as well as the brown sugar blend) and for the fat omitted shortening and used 1/4 c unsalted becel and 1/4c plain greek yogurt.  Turned out moist not wet and light  THANKS for the great recipe foundation

Loved it! Made it for my mom on mother's day. The only thing I would have changed, was putting the sugar on top half way through the bake.
