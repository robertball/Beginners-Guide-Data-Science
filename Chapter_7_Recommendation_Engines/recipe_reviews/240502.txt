This dish is amazing!! Everyone was full but couldn't stop eating it! The bonus is you can make it the day before and pop it in the oven just before serving. I used a sliced Italian crusty bread but it was too thin and not substantial enough so I'll stick to the crusty French loaf, sliced about 1" thick, and day old for better absorption without getting mushy. Great recipe! You won't regret it! Lorraine

This was excellent but the temperature of the oven worried me.  All other recipes for overnight French toast call for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Since 450 seemed very high, I baked at 450 for 15 minutes and lowered temp to 350 and baked another 30 minutes.  It was nice and crunchy on the outside and bread was NOT at all soggy. Great dish for company.

The bones of this recipe are great! The issue is the cooking instructions given. Cooking any type of egg bake over 375 is going to give you a half baked dish. I made the dish as the direction say (except I added extra cinnamon to the egg mixture as well as the top). I also added fresh blueberries prior to baking. I lowered the temperature to 350 and baked it for a full hour. The result was a delicious bread pudding/french toast casserole.
I hope this helps!

This was very easy to make and surprisingly delicious! I forgot to assemble the night before, so I made it in the morning and let it sit for about 90 min, checking every 15-20 min and pressing the top layer down to ensure it absorbed the egg mixture. I cooked for 35-40 min, and it puffed up tremendously. It was still a little wet in the middle, so next time I'll probably reduce the heat to 425 or 400 and cook for 45-50 min. Seriously good, and an impressive presentation for little work! EDIT: The caramel on the bottom can burn if left in too long, even as the top looks fine. Next time I'll stick with 35ish  min.

the caramel sauce is really the best part of this recipe.  I always hate when french toast casserole is dry, so instead of preparing it in the pan I make it an put it in a bowl or a tupperware and then I shake it a few times so the sauce is evenly distributed.  In the  morning I make the caramel sauce while the oven is preheating, then dump the bread/egg mixture in the pan.  I baked it at 400 for 35 minutes - it was perfect - the kids ate almost every bite!

Recipe Group Selection:  28, February 2015 ~ Loved it!  Of all the French toast casseroles I've made, this one has been our favorite.  I made a half recipe and put it in a 7" x 11" pan.  Be sure to spray your baking dish with cooking spray as the caramel sauce on the bottom wants to stick to the pan.  The bread was cook all the way through and not the least bit mushy in the middle.  That is why we enjoyed this recipe so much.  I served this with scrambled egg whites, fresh oranges and the 'Absolute Best Pancake Syrup' from AR.  It certainly didn't need the syrup, but it was delicious, none-the-less, on this breakfast treat that will be a repeat in our house.

After reading all the reviews I made a few minor changes to avoid the sogginess and burning problems. Before placing it into the fridge for the night I mixed all the ingredients in the pan so the brown sugar/butter mixture was not just on the bottom of the pan but spread throughout the bread. This also helped make sure the egg mixture got to all sides of the bread. I used fresh challah and it looked very soggy but it all cooked well and puffed up nicely. I skipped the brown sugar on top and cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  It was perfect and so easy! If you're concerned about using eggs, I used egg beaters and couldn't tell the difference.

This was ok.  The flavor was great but the overall sogginess needs to be addressed.  Only the top was crisp and firm, the innards were complete mush.  I even dropped the temp to 350 and cooked for another 30 minutes trying to dry it out.  Next time I will try cubing the bread a day ahead and let the bread dry out/get a little stale.  Or maybe mixing it just ahead of the cooking.  I don't know but the mush has got to go.

I made this for Easter breakfast and it was perfect!!  I followed the recipe exactly, without adding anything extra, and it was delicious as is (no syrup needed).  Only difference was I think my loaf of bread was a little bigger (11 oz I believe) and it was a crusty Italian bread. This made my family very happy and I will definitely make it again.

Recipe Group selection 28 Feb 15-- Only two of us would be eating this so I halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 glass dish. Definitely  grease your baking dish!! I prepared this the night before while I was preparing dinner. I had limited stove space so I used the microwave to melt the butter and sugar. I used some brown sugar that was rock-hard and it softened right up in the microwave. Because the casserole sat in the refrigerator all night in a glass dish, (I was worried a cold glass dish would shatter in a hot oven) I let the dish warm up a bit on the counter before putting it into the toaster oven. This recipe is quite good! No complaints here. I think it would be good with toasted pecans or even bacon for that "sweet~n~salty" flavor. Maybe next time! Also as mentioned in another review, this is good even without syrup.

Instant family favorite! The aroma in the kitchen as it bakes is lovely. Use quality spices and pure vanilla extract- can't go wrong. Delicious!

It was good, but still a little soggy in the middle, which is always my fear with French toast overnight casseroles.

Caramel goodness! We truly enjoyed this dish! I cut the recipe in half since I was only serving two. Delicious, served it with a side of bacon and coffee. Great weekend breakfast. Recipe group selection 2/28/15.

Delicious! Be sure to spray the casserole dish with baking Pam. I did not use the extra sugar to go on top of the bread. I didn't use all the liquid. I think I had 1/2 cup leftover of the milk and egg mixture. I drizzled it and let the bread absorb it. Will definitely make this a staple in our house. Thank you!

Divine!  Made it for a church breakfast (made 2 pans at once the night before), and it was a hit.  Got lots of complements.  Very rich; sugary and buttery.  I loved the way the brown sugar carmelized to the bottom of the pans.  I didn't have French bread, so I used Cinnamon swirl bread and omitted the cinnamon on top.  Someone else had brought fresh blueberries, and my husband ate them with it and said it was great that way.  I can also see adding pecans to the sugar/butter on bottom and/or blueberries or apple chunks mixed in with the bread.  So quick and easy.  It's a keeper!

One of the best overnight French toast casserole I've ever had !
Sure, you can add this and that to it , as many reviewers suggested, but it wouldn't be "EASY French toast casserole" anymore. That's what I liked about it. Simple cubed stale bread, eggs and milk and the bonus caramel that makes this not need any syrup or any  other toppings.
My pan was 9 x 13, so I needed more like 11 oz of bread. I used a very stale French baguette and it soaked up all the milk/egg mixture. And  I just used the microwave to make the caramel. Also, I only used 5 eggs (all I had ) and it worked fine. I will keep using just that much in the future. 
Last, I baked at 425 and it was set and  perfectly golden brown in 30 minutes. The whole family loved it.

Delicious! I ripped up ciabatta buns that were a day or two old, instead of bread and cooked it about 40 minutes. the buns prevented it from getting mushy and i was able to use up my leftover buns. A crowd favourite

I am writing as the last remains of the casserole, still steaming, are being scooped up. This dish is a delish hit! I prepared this last night and it was so easy to make. I have guests visiting from far away and after days of sight seeing I was at a loss for breakfast ideas for this morning. I had some leftover bread from 2 days ago and decided to make French Toast Casserole. I am so glad I did! I made a half recipe and that was plenty for 6 adults. My guests were in love with this dish and asked for the recipe. We loved the crispy bits, and the caramel. We even made plans for the next time! We had whip cream on hand and maple syrup. Next time we'll serve it with vanilla sauce. Another suggestion is an apple compote with raisins and walnuts. I'm definitely going to make this again!

Recipe Group: Loved the ease of this recipe. Well, except for the part where I had to clean the pan! I cut the recipe in half and used my deep round casserole, so I used most of my 11 oz loaf. Turned out sweet and scrumptious, needs nothing but a side of fruit and a nice cup of coffee. Yummy, thanks for the recipe Heather!

I made this for "brinner" (breakfast for dinner) on a chilly fall night, with some scrambled eggs, sausage, and fresh fruit.  It was super easy to make with ingredients that I mostly had on hand.  I did not refrigerate overnight, so instead mixed the egg mixture WITH the bread in a big bowl and then added it to the 9x13 pan.  Other changes I made:  substituted half and half for the milk, omitted the vanilla and added 1tsp of ground nutmeg to a white sugar and cinnamon  mixture I sprinkled over the top.  It will burn on top if you don't watch it closely so be aware of that, too.  Dished up and served with real butter and syrup. Delicious eggy cinnamony goodness!

Made for Recipe Group. Very easy to put together, I put the sugar mix in the microwave. Lined the pan with foil and sprayed it well. When it came time to eat it after baking I found out I had evidently put a small hole in the foil somewhere, all my caramel was under the foil! Good taste though, thank for the recipe.

This was delicious!... instead of regular butter, i used cinnamon and brown sugar honey butter. the only thing i would change is i would layer the butter and sugar mixture between the soaked bread rather than solely on the bottom.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was FAR too mushy.  Taste was good, but texture overruled that.  May try again but reduce milk/egg mixture.

Made this for the family and it smelled amazing! The problem was it turned out too soggy on the directions given, and honestly was a little "eggy". I think I'll use some of the recommendations on here and go with 5 eggs instead of six and cook 350 for 50 min - 1 hour.

I made a 10 x 13 pan using 20 oz. of french bread torn into bite size pieces and an 8 x 8 pan using a four-pack of gluten-free ciabatta rolls.

I kept the rest of the recipe as given (except that I swapped out 1/2 the brown sugar for Splenda brown sugar and 1/2 the eggs for eggbeaters). 

I tossed the bread in the milk and egg mixture to be sure the bread was all soaked before I spread it on top of the butter/brown sugar mixture in the pans.

Because I was baking both pans at the same time, and because I used more bread than in the original recipe called for, and because many of the comments said it was soggy, I baked it longer and at a lower temperature - covered at 400 for 25 minutes; then another 20 minutes uncovered at 425. I  inserted a knife blade in the center to be sure it was done, and it came out dry.

It was easy and tasted fantastic!
Thanks for the recipe.

It's OK if you don't prepare it the night before!  (oops!) In the morning, I followed the recipe and placed the dish in the freezer for about 10 minutes while the oven was preheating.  Also:  I did not sprinkle the cinnamon on top before it went to the freezer.  Instead...while it was in the freezer, I shook up brown sugar and cinnamon in a ziploc sandwich bag.  I didn't measure.  I used more cinnamon than the recipe calls for.  Once the oven was ready I sprinkled my brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top.  This dish is amazing, even if you forget to prepare it the night before!  The bottom is like a sticky bun!  ANOTHER VARIATION:  Another time I made this I forgot to buy french bread.  I cut up leftover hamburger rolls and white bread loaf. Nobody noticed   :)

I used only 5 eggs for this. Came out great.and use fat free half and half. Make sure u taste mixture is right for spices because u can always add more depending on flavor. The review that said soggy didn't cook long enough. Use your own judgement may take longer.

I made this as directed with two exceptions. I used a loaf of 2 day old cinnamon bread AND, I had to cook it at 350 as other casseroles needed to be baked at that temp at same time for our brunch.  Baked for about 50 minutes. No soggy center. Perfect!

So easy and delicious!  I did not let it sit for 8 hours.  I prepared it and popped it right in the oven.  Also added pecans on top.  Brought it to a brunch, it was gone in 5 minutes!  Received many compliments.

This was ok..the bottom was a little to sweet for us. Over all the flavors were good. Cover dish during cooking with tin foil and remove 5 minutes before cooking is complete to brown the top. I would mixthe bread and egg mixture too before cooking.

Made it exactly.  And flipped it like others suggested after I was done.  I cleaned dish immediately so didn't have the sticky residue.  I liked the idea of flipping and letting the sauce drip down throughout casserole. Got many compliments.

This dish is absolutely divine! Very filling too. I didn't put it in the fridge overnight just made it like the frying pan version and it still tasted delicious. I did sprinkle extra brown sugar and cinnamon on top. Had to adjust the temp. since my oven cooks hotter, baked it until it came out crunchy brown on top and crispy at the bottom. The eggs should set once cooled and since I made the whole recipe, lots of yummy leftovers??

Mine turned out excellent but I adjusted the recipe as it is flawed. 8oz of bread is too little for that much liquid which is why many ended up with slop. I doubled the bread (used my leftover sliced baguette from New Years that was in the freezer). I had to work to get 16 oz. to absorb the liquid. Then I used convection bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. With those adjustments it was perfect.

I made this with only minimal changes and it was great.   I used a 12oz loaf of crusty day old french bread and one less egg.   We were not in a hurry so we baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and it turned out perfectly.   The last time I tried to make one of these casseroles it turned out to be an eggy mushy mess, but this recipe was great and we will definitely use it again next Christmas.

I used a little less milk and didn't let it sit over night. I baked it at 350 for about 45 mins.  It wasn't soggy or dry. It was delicious and was a hit with everyone! I will definitely make this again!

One of the easiest and delicious breakfast casseroles I have ever made! I doubled the recipe for work and followed recipe to a T except did not sprinkle more sugar on top...doesn't need it! I used two loaves of skinny crusty French bread and was concerned about the amount of liquid and appearance a bit soggy after leaving it in fridge overnight. Don't worry! It plumped up nicely and came out perfectly with a nice crunch on top if you cook it at 350 degrees for one hour in a larger aluminum throw away pan (since I doubled the recipe)! At least half of the employees asked for the recipe. I brought syrup but hardly used as it really doesn't need it. Enjoy!

I melted the butter and brown sugar in the microwave.  Used French bread cut into approximately 1 1/2 inch slices.  The next morning the egg/milk mixture was completely sucked up in the read and I was worried about it being too dry while it was cooking (and I went back to bed).   But I didn't cover it and after 30 minutes took it out and it was completely fine.  Great tasting but very sweet.  The extra brown sugar on top definitely isn't necessary.  This is great served with a fresh fruit.

This recipe is a keeper. I made a few changes and variations. The first batch I made, I chopped up three apples and took some raisins and made a compote and added it in to the bread mixture. I made a little extra of the carmel sauce and I layered it in the casserole instead of putting it all on the bottom. The second batch I made,  I decreased the egg by one  and I added pecans in the mixture and on top. I also put about 1/8  cup of brown sugar into the egg mixture. I also cooked it for 10 minutes at 425 and the remaining 20 minutes dropped the oven down to 350. The recipe came out perfect!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. After 50 minutes the center was soggy so I cooked it 10 more, the edges got crisp but the center was still too soggy for me. The flavor, however,  is fabulous! But I think I'll stick to French toast on the griddle.

Its a good basis to start, not enough milk and sugar.  I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon ON bread before pouring egg wash over. I added frozen berries then when fresh out oven drizzled homemade maple syrup (yes, I make my own) and it helped, but it needs more umph.

Pretty much stuck to the recipe. I used freshly baked french bread, bananas and raisins. I only soaked it all for about 3-4 hours, which was perfect. It looks really pretty with powdered sugar on top. Highly recommend.

Made this casserole for a family brunch for 12 people. It was a HIT! Made it exactly as the recipe is written! I've made some french toast casseroles in the past that are very dry and needed syrup, but this one was very moist ! Thanks!

I had a bunch of leftover croissants from a family gathering and used those to make this. It was really very good! I had to cook mine a bit longer to get rid of all the extra "juice", about 10-15 more, but about half way through I had to add foil so the top wouldn't burn. So perhaps that was why the extra cook time. Also, I forgot to add the brown sugar sprinkle on top but it didn't need it.  I will definitely make this again!

This Casserole was AMAZING!!  I did change a few things because I was not prepared for the recipe and was looking for a way to use our Sandwich bread that got smashed. =(
So I used Sunbeam Texas Giant bread,  smashed,  lol.  I didn't have enough milk so I used coffee creamer  (Coldstone Sweet Cream). Which I believe made it a little on the sweet side for me(not a big sweet eater).    
I followed everything else to a T. I even added 4oz of cream cheese as the recipe suggested.  (This broke up the sweetness quite well from the creamer). We live in Texas,  and my cook time ended up being 25 minutes.  This Casserole was beautiful and my 3 kids loved it!! We will be keeping this one for sure!!

I melt the butter & sugar (both reduced by about half for a smaller glass dish) in the bottom of the pan, and add some cinnamon, before adding the bread bits & mixing in the egg/milk/vanilla mixture. Then i make sure to move it all around enough that the bread really soaks up the mixture. Put in the fridge & let it rest overnight for a quick cook/meal the next morning. For our oven, the halved version is ready in about 25 minutes. The edges get crispy, but I like that, at about 30.

This was excellent--and simple to make. I made one as directed in the recipe, and another one dairy-free (with soy milk, and I left out the sugar/butter mixture in this one). This was a great Easter brunch item.

This is my go-to recipe for when I have overnight guests! Though I have tweaked it accordingly from others' feedback.
I hate soggy French toast so I don't make it the night before. I gently fold the bread pieces into the egg mixture in a mixing bowl and dump it into the pan over the caramel sauce, so the sauce stays in the bottom. I always add more vanilla and cinnamon (just eyeballed). I bake it on 400 for 35-45 minutes, checking it when it gets close to the end, and about 5 minutes before intake it out, I sprinkle a streusel mixture on top (butter/flour/brown sugar) and broil it, so the top gets extra crunchy.
It's delicious and leftovers, if any, reheat great!

I lost this recipe for a while and thank goodness I found it again.  This is my favorite recipe of all time I think.  I could eat the whole pan.  Warm, cold it doesn't matter.  I actually use Healthy Life low carb wheat bread and it is delicious.  I substitute almond extract for vanilla extract.  I also use a lot of cinnamon in the egg mixture as well as on top.  This morning I put a spoonful of pumpkin cream cheese on top before heating in microwave for breakfast.

I followed the basic instructions but since I was making this for my works Breaksgiving and my family is selfish I used more bread and did one cream cheese and apples and the other pecans and drizzled with maple syrup. As a finish I made a loose caramel sauce of  butter , brown sugar and a splash of milk.  I'm giving 4 stars because I don't know what they'll think. I sampled the family's and it was on point with the additional sauce. Without it it seemed flavorless. 

If I had it to do over. I'd add bourbon to the egg mixture, and to the Caramel topping. That would be 5 star!

Everything was soggy but the very top. The bottom was nothing but butter. After baking it an extended amount of time I mixed it all around and baked it some more but it was still so soggy. This was a big disappointment because of it having so many good reviews.

The one star was ONLY because the temperature in the recipe is WAY to high.  It should be baked on about 350F.  First time I made it the top burned well before it was cooked through.

This is such a great go-to recipe. I use it a lot EXCEPT, I think there is way too much fat with that much butter and cut it back to 1/3 cup.  I also poured the brown sugar sauce over the bread after I added the egg mixture. It go all brown and crispy when I baked it. Yum!

Loved all the flavours.  Started with thick slices of stale cinnamon raisin bread.  Used Saigon cinnamon. Sprinkled a few frozen blueberries around the perimeter of the triangle slices. Put sliced maple syrup, strawberries and whipped cream on the table. Everyone had seconds.  Guests who don’t bake asked for recipe.

Excellent. I made it for New Year's Day brunch. It was a hit. A few changes, I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread but cut it in halves. I made 3 layers and I put frozen mixed berries between the layers. It's all gone :)

Very good.  Easy and delicious.  This went over well with a houseful of holiday guests.  I had to use Italian bread since French was not available at the store.  I was worried that fresh Italian bread would be too soft so after cubing the bread I toasted it lightly under a low broiler before assembly.  I used the other ingredients listed and followed the method exactly with exception of a slightly lower oven temp and 55 min baking time.  I used a stainless pan (I would never use a glass pan above 375 and would fear a cold glass pan in a hot preheated oven might shatter).  I covered  the pan tightly with foil and cooked at 400 for 15 minutes.   Then I turned up to 425, removed foil and cooked uncovered for about 20 minutes.  It puffed up beautifully but was browning too much so I reduced the temp to 375 and tented loosely with foil again for the last 10-15 minutes.  It was perfect.  It had a crisp exterior and a soft interior but not mushy or burnt at all.  I'll do this again for holiday breakfasts.  Easy but delicious enough for a special occasion.

Made this for my family's annual Christmas brunch this year.  It was a huge hit!  I did add about 3/4 cup toasted pecan pieces to the butter/brown sugar mixture.  We loved that addition. Easy dish to make ahead.  I would suggest baking at 400 degrees rather than 450.  It browned a bit more than I wanted, and I took it out of the oven after only 25 minutes.

Made this for a group of 5 visiting "bikers" and they loved it.  Made just a few minor changes.  I used half & half in place of the milk only because I needed to use it up.  Also, the top started to brown too quickly at 450 so I lowered temp to 350 after 15 min and baked an additional 15 minutes.  This created a nice crunch to the top and the inside was set but not mushy.  Also, I used a 14 oz loaf of Challah bread.  Served with syrup on the top.

It's good! Let my bread sit out for 24 hrs, and I didn't have any problem with soggyness. Reminder to self for next time, listen to the recipe, 1 inch pieces. Maybe try less butter next time.

I made this and it was delicious. It disappeared so fast. I see that some people have a problem with it being soft in the middle, but I did not have this problem. I think that oven temperatures vary and that is why this problem is present. I cooked it on 350 for one hour, but checked it after a half hour and it came out so good. I will definitely be making this again.

Was better the 2nd tie around with a few modifications.  I mixed the brown sugar and butter in all of the bread mixture and not just on the bottom.  Make sure to mix the egg/milk mixture soaking all of the bread. I sprinkled more cinnamon and brown sugar on the top before baking.  Baked at 425 for 15 minutes then turned down to 350 for 30 minutes.  Perfect, slightly crunchy on the outside and moist in the middle.  Very flavorful.  Served with blueberries and strawberries on the side.

This was the most delicious breakfast dish ever!  The brown sugar/butter crust in combination with the bread that soaked in the milk/vanilla mixture overnight made this fabulous!   The only change I would make is to take it out of the oven maybe 2-3 minutes earlier.  The crust started to burn in a couple of spots, but it could have been the glass pan that I used.  It was still utterly delicious and easy!  My entire family enjoyed it, picky kids and all!

This was a big hit! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect. The only slight change I made was to mix in the cinnamon into the egg mixture (instead of sprinkling it on top) and I also put in a little nutmeg.  I made this for 8 adults and everyone loved it - next time I will make two pans because it disappeared a little too quickly!

I made this for a brunch. I liked that all the prep was the day before so I just popped it in the oven that morning.  It was a hit. they only change I made was that I I kept foil on it for the first 15 minutes, took off the foil and put a thin layer of maple syrup on it, put it back in without foil until done

I have made French toast casseroles before, but this one needs tweaked. Followed the directions to a T and the brown sugar burned on the bottom. 450 degrees for a half an hour ends up burning the bottom. Beware!  Either scale down the brown sugar or turn the heat way down.

I'd been hearing so many rave reviews about French Toast Casseroles that I decided to make 2 different ones for a brunch we had planned this morning.  I made it as written except for adding a little extra cinnamon to the brown sugar mixture, and making it about 2 hours before baking.  I did press the bread down a few times, to make sure it was all saturated.  Although this was edible, it was too custard-like for most palates and was the one that didn't get slicked up like the other.   I won't be making this one again.

What  a tasty dish for a Sunday morning in bed with coffee! I followed the recipe directions exactly as written but cut the recipe in half and used a loaf pan - perfect for two people. Make sure you grease well and serve immediately or it sticks and then when cooled, it is difficult to get out from the bottom. Yummy. Thank you for a great and super easy recipe.

I made this for the high school girl's swim team on a recommendation from a friend. The girls (and I) loved it! It was so easy to make and serve. 

The only thing I did a bit different is I covered it with tin foil for the last 5-10 minutes of baking so the sugar on the top didn't burn and turn black.

This will be my new go-to brunch recipe! Thank you!

I followed the recipe as is; although, I used a 9” x 13” casserole dish and baked it at 350 deg F for 1 hour.  I can’t say enough good things about this recipe.  This was awesome!!! Absolutely delicious.  I will be making this again.  Thank you.

Delicious! Followed the recipe as written and made the night before. The oven was set at 450°.  I did cover the casserole in foil for the 20min in the oven, then cooked uncovered for last 10min to cut down on burning the top layer of bread. The bread in the corners did get a little crispy, but my wife and I prefer it that way. Our two picky eater kids loved the casserole too.

I made this exactly as is, except I did not refrigerate overnight. My sourdough bread was quite dry and I just made sure each piece got enough of the egg mix on it. My husband said it was restaurant grade flavor! I think I have to agree. I'll definitely make this again. It's so easy to whip up for guests, too.

I liked it and so did everyone else.  It did come out a little drier than I was hoping for so next tine I think I will add some more cream.  Just a personal preference, but overall I would make again.

I used challah bread instead of french bread. The casserole burned on top and was mushy in the center at 450°F. I will try another recipe next time.

Loved this recipe! Only a couple of modifications. I used 1.5 French baguettes and I used 8 eggs instead of 6. Used extra milk to match the extra eggs. Everyone loved this recipe! Served 6 of us for brunch with very little leftover. Also served quiche, yogurt, fruit, etc. If this was the only dish, would have needed to make more. Cooked a little lower than the recipe calls for - around 350-400 for the described time. The finished dish looked great to serve to company. Can’t wait to make again soon!!

The butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan made this dish very special. I used more butter then listed. It was worth it.

Made this exactly per the directions for Christmas brunch and there wasn't a single bite left. The cook time of 30 minutes is too long, I checked at about 23 minutes and the bread was really toasted, I would cut it at about 20 minutes. I would make this again and try it with a less tough crusted bread- like a brioche or challah so that everything was as soft as the inside. Family raved about it though!

I used brioche and because I had more bread than the recipe called for I added an additional cup of milk and two eggs.  Everyone LOVED it and I'll be using this one as my breakfast brunch recipe.

I made this and the only changes I made was to add maple flavoring instead of vanilla.  I also added apple pie spice as well as cinnamon and used 1/4 cup Monkfruit sugar and half cup of white sugar. I used 11 oz  French bread from Walmart and is was amazing!!

Great!
I made it as a test run this weekend because we are having house guest next weekend. 
When I make it next weekend, I plan to turn the temp down to 450.

Loved it. I made it with a loaf of Cinnabon Cinnamon Swirl bread.  I didn't add any other extras. It was fabulous but I did overcook it at 450 for 30 minutes. I made it a 2nd time with French bread and found a lower temp oven worked better. 400 degrees and check after 20 minutes.

This is a great recipe on its own, and I can see making more additions as I make it again.  First note, the cook temp should be 350, not 450.  Bake for 1 hour.  I made mine with 3/4 of a loaf of Brioche bread from Aldi, 8 eggs, and 1 1/2 cups of half & half plus one cup of milk.  Great on its own, next time I can see adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans, or a chopped apple and a handful of raisins.  Or the frozen blueberries I have in the freezer.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination!

I have made this recipe now 3 times in the past couple of months.  It is a huge hit with family and friends.  I've tried adding apples and blueberries, with blueberries the hands down favorite.  You must bake at the lower temperature like the other reviewer stated.  350 degrees for an hour and it comes out scrumptious. 
We serve with sliced ham for breakfast/brunch and just add mimosa or orange juice to finish the perfection!

MAKE THESE MINOR MODIFICATIONS FOR PERFECTION!!

So after reading the recipe and comments I gave this a go! Here is what I did differently...

I stirred the egg and bread mixture together in a bowl prior to moving it to the baking pan. 

I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes then turned up to 450 for about 12 minutes. Perfectly cooked. 

I sprinkled a mix of granular sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon on top. Extra yum!!

I made one pan with the Caramel mixture on the bottom. It was good, but ehh I would not make it again. 

The other pan, I put half of the egg bread mix on bottom, then the layer of caramel, then another layer of egg/bread on top. Let it sit over night, before putting in the oven I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mix on top. IT WAS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!! Tasted so much better in the middle than on the bottom. This will definitely be a go to, super easy recipe. Definitely a desserty breakfast recipe!

I've made it several times and think I've gotten it perfected finally. First, turn your oven down to 350 ( otherwise it will be crispy on top and gooey inside) and cook for 50 minutes. The other thing I did this time that helped was buying my bread (i used Italian but have used French before) a few days ahead of making to let it dry out a little bit. It was beautiful, cooked all the way through with an little crunch to the top and that delicious carmel bottom.

Reminds me of a breakfast version of bread pudding!! So good! I used french brioche bread cut into cubes, and used 1 cup 2% milk and  1 cup heavy whipping cream. Added some freshly grated nutmeg on top with the cinnamon and brown sugar and baked at 450 for 35 minutes and additional 8 minutes at 350. Delicious!!!

I've tried a number of French toast casserole recipes and this one is by far the best and the easiest! I took it to a church brunch and people fell in love with the dish...Everyone was buzzing around, asking, "Who made this?" Can't believe how many people I gave the recipe to. I no longer need to continue my search for the "best French toast casserole" recipe...I have found it!

oh my goodness this is good. in my oven, 450 convection, I had to bake this for 45 minutes to cook it fully through. And I was a little more generous with the cinnamon and brown sugar on top. I made this with a loaf of homemade bread that got stuck in the pan and it's absolutely amazing!

I used a brown sugar cinnamon bread instead of the French baguette. I also smothered it in cream cheese icing after it cooled. Great recipe either way.

It was sooooo good. The caramel sauce is was made it. I used salted butter and it tasted like toffee. I used leftover challah from another recipe I got on here recently and it turned out super nice! It was a teeny bit soggy but not enough to have me bother diddling with the temp and times next time. (And yes there will be a next time, it just came out of the oven and it's almost all gone!)

Great make ahead casserole.  I made this the day of, instead of the night before, but it did have a chance to rest about 5 hours.  I used one half loaf of day old Vienna bread.  I removed it from the fridge about 30 minutes before baking to let the glass dish come to room temp.  The bread had absorbed all the liquid.    I cooked this at 350 degrees because of other things that were in the oven.  It was brown and crispy after about 35 minutes.  The center had just the right consistency.   The brown sugar bottom was the perfect touch or caramel.  Adults and kids loved this.

Had a rock hard baguette that needed to be used, so I made this. It definately needed to soak overnight so the bread had time to absorb the liquid. Per other reviews, I baked it at 375 for 35 minutes and the top was still hard, I should have stirred it one more time before going into the oven to redistribute some moisture. Next time I'll just mix some brown sugar into the milk mix and skip the caramel altogether.  I also added about 3/4 cup sultanas into the mix but it would be easy to add any nuts or fruit to this.

My family really liked it.  Very filling.  The center pieces of the casserole were a little too soggy as if it had absorbed too much of the batter.  I probably could have let my bread be a couple of days old instead of one to  hold the batter.  I would make it again though

Glad I read the reviews about bake time, I baked mine at 375 for an hour and it was perfect. This recipe is so easy and good I have made it twice in the last 72 hours! It went so fast at Easter breakfast not everyone was able to try it so I made a second casserole for my immediate family to enjoy!!!! Great recipe will be a go to in my house!

I followed the recipe except for cooking temp, also did not add brown sugar on top.  This came out perfect cooked for 40 minutes at 375, first 20 min in convection mode.  I used crusty and fairly dense french bread and kept adding it until there were no spaces.  Soaked it overnight in the refrigerator.  No problems with sogginess or burning, top was nicely browned.  Seven adults ate the entire thing and raved about it.

I made this for a group of college students and it was a big hit! The caramel coating at the bottom really takes this recipe to the next level. I'll definitely make it again!

Very good!  Lots of compliments!  My only tweak was adding 1 tsp of cinnamon to the egg and milk mixture, using Texas toast bread and turning down the heat to 350 for 25-30 in convection.

So, so good!!!! I had what seemed like extra liquid in the pan, but after leaving in fridge overnight, it was all soaked up. Amazing!

We love this, however we add no sugar (for those who was a bit  sweeter taste, i have jam and syrup on the table), use Dave's Killer Bread, thin sliced (a bread with only 60cal/slice and a LOT of texture). We tear it up to make a lovely "Monkey Bread" look, and added two extra egg whites. YUM!

This was **waaaay** too sugary, especially on the bottom.   It was also too crunchy on the top, even though I followed the suggestion of several commenters to reduce the heat.  You might as well just make french toast - it will come out much better!

I JUST started cooking & baking. This recipe was super easy & absolutely delicious!! Ive made this with cinnamon raisin bread & apple caramel bread. I cooked it for about 35-40min & it came out perfectly. The caramel sauce wants to stick to the bottom of the pan, so be careful with that. The whole thing came out so crispy & sweet! Wow!

Excellent I used 2 1/2 milk so the bread would all be covered. I also used a whole loaf of cinnamon raisin bread.

I give 4 stars only because I didn’t actually eat it. We made 4 pans of this for Christmas for the guys that had to work (I work at a 24/7 plant).  I heard nothing but good things and even how excited they were when they realized only 3 had been cooked. Super easy to make!

This is so good! The family gave it rave reviews at Christmas brunch! I didn't make any changes. I think, for many of those who complained about it being soggy, may be using the wrong type of bread.  French bread has a pretty dense consistency, so if you used another type of bread, that could be the problem! If you don't  have French bread, I would recommend using less milk. I have a pan ready to go in the oven for dinner this evening. The only difference, this time,  is that I added pecans to the bottom! I can't wait! Yum! I also think that mixing the egg mixture with the bread prior to putting it in the pan helps to make sure the bread is evenly saturated.

I didn't allow to chill for 8 hours. I simply made sure the egg mixture absorbed into the bread.  It still turned out great!

This was fairly easy to make and it was very tasty. The only thing I didn’t like was the syrup on the bottom turned to toffee when it started to cool. We had too much so I saved the extras. Reheated it in a bowl in the microwave and the syrup was better since I mixed it after heating. I will probably try it again.

Made exactly as recipe called for, let sit in fridge overnight and it was incredible! (Temp in oven and length of time were perfect). Exactly what I was looking for. My family has a new tradition to savor this Christmas mornings before opening gifts! Thank you for the recipe!!!!!

Great recipe! I made it as described for a crowd, we ended up serving it as dessert. 

I like my french toast dry so I added 1-2 cups more bread cubes.  Thanks to the poster who suggested using a separate Tupperware to shake the custard and bread cubes together.  I happen to have one that's 13x9 and it work as promised.  Great idea, it really helped evenly distribute the custard before adding them to the baking dish. There was no gooey custard on the bottom of the dish.  Loved the brown sugar/butter base, it was a tiny bit sticky but not as bad as i expected. When served warm it was melted enough to incorporate with each spoonful.

Great recipe just had to tweak it for my dietary restriction. Used : whole wheat bread, almond milk, and about only 1/2 c brown sugar plus 4 TBS . The rest I followed w/the eggs,butter, cinnamon, vanilla,Oh I added extra cinnamon mixed it in the milk/egg batter. Then added it to the top to. Came out perfect.

Very quick and easy to put together. I’ve made it twice, followed recipe exactly except as others suggested I baked at 350 for one hour the first time then because of short time the second time, baked at 450 for 30 minutes. Better texture baking at lower temp for longer time.

Fabulous! My new Christmas morning casserole!
I cooked mine at 400 for 35-40 minutes and used Italian bread. 
I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of heavy cream as I was running out of milk.

This recipe is the best! I did not find it to be to mushy in the middle. It wasn't overly sweet and it had just the right amount of crunch. I loved that I could make it the night before. The only thing I changed was the cooking temperature.  450° is way too hot. In 30 minutes it would be burnt. Even the picture on this page shows burnt French toast. I did 375 for 30 minutes and then turned it up to 400 for about 15 minutes.  It turned out great and I got a lot of compliments! I forgot to sprinkle the brown sugar on it before cooking but it really didn't need it.

This is my go-to for make ahead breakfast (Christmas in particular.) I like to add a layer of banana slices between the caramel and bread which makes the bottom warm and delicious. I also mix the egg mixture and bread in a bowl before the bread goes in the pan. I generally still refrigerate overnight, but this method works better if you haven’t prepped ahead of time.

DO NOT HEAT TO 450!!! I did this and burned the entire top of the dish. Wasted a good load of French bread and 6 eggs. Next time will lower the temp, lengthen the time and cover with foil.

I made it dairy free using Margerine instead of butter and almond milk. It was still awesomely delicious!

I love this recipe! Also you can use any bread if you need to use some up. Comes out better with lots of bread, prevents any mushiness with too little.

I was using some very sweet brioche for the bread, so reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. Worked really well, though some eaters felt some bites could use a little more sweetness. Also, I forgot the cinnamon (!)  and it didn't seem to matter -- deliciously brown-sugary and a big hit.

Such a great recipe! I only do one thing differently. I mix the eggs, milk, vanilla and cinnamon in a giant bowl. Then I add the cubed bread and mix everything together. I cover and leave the bread mixture in this bowl overnight. I find this gets more of the bread absorbing the egg mixture. Then in the morning, we melt the butter and brown sugar in a pot, then put it in the baking pan and add the egg mixture from the bowl.  We don’t add any syrup, but sometimes we like to have it with whipped cream! A really great addition to brunch and wonderful on Christmas morning. Thank you for sharing a fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, including the oven temp and time, except I used powdered milk mixed with water ( I normally don't have milk around the house, so I keep powdered milk handy) Excellent. JJ and I loved the little bit of crunchiness on top. Good presentation also.

I thought it was great. I cooked it at 450 for the recommended time. Added a Lott more of the spices, I browned the butter the I could not get the brown sugar to dissolve. But it was great and I will defiantly make it again.

This time I used a generic spray to grease my pan...big mistake.  The wonderful caramel stayed in the pan and not on the bread. Plan ahead.  I buy my bread a day ahead of when I want to make this and let the bread sit out to dry out.  This keeps the bread from becoming so soggy. I make this to take to ladies only golf outing breakfast. Always goes well and I am asked for the recipe.

I added blueberries before I cooked it. It puffed up beautifully! It's a touch sweet with the brown sugar mix on the bottom. I might cut that down by half. Also I'm excited to try apples or other fruit.

This is a super easy and delicious recipe. It will be my "go to" French toast dish from now on. I didn't have enough time to let it soak in the fridge yet the flavor was amazing. I added the blackberries right before putting it in the oven and also added powdered sugar just before serving. YUMMY!

Had a French bread loaf from double t diner that I had to either make croutons or bread pudding, I decided to try an overnight French toast recipe. I also don’t have half and half or heavy cream in my fridge so this recipe was perfect for me. I only allow skim milk in my fridge so this recipe came out  pretty awesome. After reading reviews, I just cooked it for 50 minutes at 350. It was crunchy on the top and French toastish (lighter than a bread pudding texture). It was probably crunchy on top because I just poured the egg milk mixture on the bread cubes but I should have mixed the bread cubes with the mixture first, then dumping it on the brown sugar mixture. Or maybe I need to cut my cubes smaller. Either way, def a good recipe!

This was excellent and very easy to prepare.  I made it as directed, including the high oven temp, except I substituted leftover pastries like cinnamon rolls, cheese danish, and sticky buns for the French bread.  I also had it in the fridge for two nights before I baked it.  I made two pans to feed 10 hungry cross-country runners (with sides of bacon and sausage), and they pretty much ate it all.

Turned out amazing, definitely doesn’t need any syrup, very sweet. I used the Pam “baking” spray and the pan liters wiped clean afterward no problems with the caramel. Will definitely make this again!!!

Great, easy and well received by family and friends at a brunch which included smoked salmon/cream cheese on bagels,  a Brie triple cream cheese to die for, pate foie gras, an Indian chutney, exotic fruit platter and IT STILL SHONE!  Presentation not a high point as it fell flat when removed from the oven, but no one complained.  Definitely a keeper as preparation was sooooo easy.

This was luscious. Easy to make and  was a winner on Christmas morning.  I used challah bread for a richer flavor and  will probably cut out an egg or two next time. I also plan to double the sauce. It's just wonderful and can be used on more than this dish.

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe in a glass 9x13 pan.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 450 degrees.  It was crunchy on top, soft in the middle, and the caramel crust on the bottom was a favorite!  We ate it with syrup, and my family of four devoured 2/3 of it in one sitting.  This would also be great for a bigger family and/or company!

I’ve tried another recipe and this totally tops any French toast casserole I’ve made! I use a couple day old crusty French bread and let it sit for a good 14 hours. I had to trouble with the caramel sauce on the bottom burning and I even forgot to grease the first time I made it! I also haven’t had vanilla so I’ve made it without and it’s still delicious! We did not use syrup it was perfect as is!

We actually were looking for a recipe that I could put together and cook right away. We did not read the whole recipe so I didn’t realize it was supposed to sit for over 8 hours. I made sure all the bread cubes were soaked in the egg mixture and baked it right away. It was delicious!! So either way it can be done both ways!!

The recipe is perfect!!! BEWARE DO NOT COOK AT 450 DEGREES!!!! 415 degrees is enough cook for 30minutes. I’ve been making this recipe 2 times a month for the past year. My family loves it and I love it because it’s soooo easy!!

This recipe was delicious but this should be a dessert not a breakfast! It's so sweet. I made a "mistake" in that I added the cinnamon to the egg and milk mixture but I liked having the cinnamon throughout the casserole not just on the top. I would make this again if I was serving a larger crowd but for a family of 4, and because it was SO sweet, we had a lot leftover.

My family loved this--my teenage son said it was better than regular French toast! I used a slightly larger pan (14x9) and two small loaves of French bread that I bought on the "day old" rack--it still seemed too fresh, so I "staled" the bread by slicing and baking at 200 degrees until it was just dried out but not at all browned, so it would soak up the egg mixture well. I mixed additional egg/vanilla/milk, adding it bit by bit so that all pieces were saturated (about 9 eggs). It almost seemed too soggy, but there was no extra liquid. I didn't think the sugar actually dissolved into the butter at that step of cooking it on the stovetop, and it seemed to be separated a bit, but it was obviously ok! It stayed in the fridge for about 13 hours, then I took it out and placed it on the stovetop while the oven was pre-heating to warm up the dish before putting it in the oven. I baked it at 400 degrees, just because it had to share the oven with breakfast pizza! Took it out when it was browned and it was absolutely perfect and delicious! Not soggy, not dried out, just right!! We used a bit of maple syrup at the table and it was really, really delicious!! A great recipe! Thank you!!

I made this for an Easter Sunday church potluck breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, except one thing. I preheated to 350 and baked the casserole for about 10 minutes or so before I realized it was supposed to be set at 450 degrees per the directions. I removed the casserole while the oven heated up to for 450. Returned dish to oven and baked for about 30 minutes. No sogginess in the middle (as other reviewers have mentioned)  and crispy on top, so I guess my mistake worked out fine. Yummy

Made it using the tweaks I read in a previous review:  adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture; soaking overnight, adding a simple praline on top to back.  I also used a large loaf of French bread (12 oz) instead of just 8.  Delicious!!  A big hit at my girls' brunch. Will definitely make this many times more.

I have made this three or four times. The first time I make it I used a bunch of leftover stale Costco crescent rolls. This meal is easy and great for visiting company.  You don't have to assemble it 8 hours before. I find that a couple hours ore serving is just as good. I've even divided the recipe into smaller dishes for the two of us. Bake them both, serve one and use the other for later in the week. It's become one of my favorite breakfast bakes.

Not a good recipe. There isn't enough flavor and it's extremely soggy. If I make it again, I'll up the sugar and cinnamon, mix all ingredients together, then add the bread to get even flavor throughout. I'm not sure if it needs more baking time or less milk. I'm not a good cook so I rely solely on the recipe instructions.

This was excellent! It was easy to throw together while making supper and quick to throw in the oven in the morning even before school. No syrup or anything extra is even required. Our boys devoured it! I will definitely be making this again!

I made this per the recipe but used gluten free Ezekiel bread. I also reduced heat to 400 degrees because I was worried about over cooking. I made for a work brunch and then again for Christmas morning. It was a hit in both cases.

I pretty much followed the recipe given here, except I took the advice of several and mixed the bread in the milk before pouring in the pan. I think I may have baked it a little too long. It was good, but not great. This is very possibly my fault for baking too long. I might try it again and watch it closer.

This was a big hit on Christmas morning! I used french bread roll that I got from the day old section. That makes a big difference with outcome. Using fresh soft bread makes this dish a bit soggy.

This was such a nice casserole to have for Christmas morning.  The top was crispy, the inside was soft and there was just enough stickiness  from the caramelization to make it wonderful.  We will definitely be making this again!

I made this for breakfast on Christmas Eve. The changes I made included using sub rolls (I had no other bread) and adding nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture. We ate it with raspberries, blueberries and a side of turkey bacon. No syrup was required. Also baked it at 425 for 15 min and 400 for the last 15 min as it was browning pretty fast on top. Absolutely delicious!

This recipe was horrible. I made it for company, which was a huge mistake. The bread ended up soggy and the bottom was burnt just like other reviews had said (besides me watching it like a hawk). I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

So much for 450 degrees for 30 minutes. I just had to extinguish my casserole and now I’m going to my office Christmas breakfast empty handed. Lesson learned: back off on the heat setting.

Absolutely Delicious!  I made it the night before and it turned out perfectly at 35 minutes!  I did let the bread dry out a few hours before making and added twice the cinnamon.  First dish to be finished at Christmas brunch!

I messed up. I didn't read all the directions before I had already put it in the oven. I didn't leave it soak overnight. I put it all together and threw it in the oven. It was amazing!!! It had crunchy bits and gooey bits and it was so perfect my family ate the whole pan. 

I read reviews saying it was too wet and I think if you don't soak overnight, you would love it even more! I did toast my bread prices a bit in the oven before I out it together. They kept their shape and it was amazing!

Very easy to make the night before. It was delicious and filling. I used only 6 pieces of bread and it fed three of us with leftovers. The family loved it. I added a few apples on top to top it off

This was DYNAMITE!! The only thing I changed was I used a loaf of monkey bread instead of French bread. My family LOVED it. Already making it again, 2 days later!

Great casserole to make for a big crowd; you can grate some apple to add some more taste but it’s also fine without; I served mine with real maple syrup because I’m from Quebec....a little goes a long way. The kids love whipped cream on top too, and some good crispy bacon on the side. Perfect for Christmas breakfast!

This was an incredibly delicious breakfast. II know it's probably not the healthiest thing I made this week, ....but !
It's been a tradition in my family to eat coffee cake for breakfast on Thanksgiving, but I think this may take its place.
French Toast Casserole is a definite keeper.

After I baked it, I sprinkled the cinnamon as directed and then drizzled a little (probably 2  tablespoons) over that.   Took it to a Sunday School breakfast and it was a big hit.  I will definitely make it again.

Used 1/2 cup trivia brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar.  And added more cinnamon.  Friends loved it.     Planning to make it for the family at Christmas.

I made this recipe twice now. I like the taste but had the same issue as others, very soggy on the inside. The second time I left it in the over for an extra twenty minutes and still mushy in the centre.  Turns out my husband absolutely loved the mushiness so this is a winner for our family!

I used heavy cream in place of the milk and added breakfast sausages.  I made it for a work place breakfast function, and everyone loved it.  I also drizzled a little bit of maple syrup.  I baked 2 trays of this recipe in the oven and put it in a crock pot to keep it warm.  I also used cheap white bread from Aldi's - toasted the bread before cutting the bread into cubes.  I tripled the egg mixture to match the amount of bread.  Nobody knew the difference and everyone loved it.

Made it for a group of 20 for breakfast.  Made 3 9x13 dishes, cut into 8 servings each.  Could have done 10 servings per dish.  Using tips from others I used the microwave for butter and brown sugar and after removing from oven immediately turned it onto parchment lined tray for serving.  Released from the pan very nicely.  I was concerned it might be too sweet but it was not.  Only 1 person used syrup.  I sprinkled top with cinnamon before baking.  Baking 3 dishes, staggered in a large oven, I allowed 40 minutes in a pre-heated 220C oven but it was done in closer to 20-25.  After about 10 minutes I covered each dish with foil to prevent overbrowning.  After the knife came out clean I turned off heat and left to keep warm.  Was a huge hit, several asked for recipe and asked it be "kept on the menu" for future events.  Served with sausage and fresh fruit.  A keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly.  The resulting taste was good but only the top was crisp.   The mushy middle was not at all appealing to me or my family.

It was easy and delicious. My teens thoroughly enjoyed the moist and crispiness of the casserole. I did not use french bread, I used the Costco brand torta bread and it came out beautifully.

Very good.  But the caramel stayed on the bottom.  I think next time I'll drizzle the caramel over the bread bits before adding the egg mix.

So the flavor is AMAZING and everyone loved it BUT it does come out very soggy in the middle and if you keep cooking it burns on the top and bottom. I think I'll try what others did and lower the temp and cook longer. Also- use a disposable pan. That was a pain to clean. :) Any other tips from people who didn't have liquid center please lmk!

This is amazing and super easy, no changes needed. I made for a Mothers Day brunch and everyone loved it and was gone in minutes. I made early evening the night before and baked the next morning and came out perfect!

What a hit! I would have loved to take a picture but it was eaten up too fast. Every one loves it. 
I am glad I read the recipe a day before. I let it set all night in the refrigerator.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it for a potluck Easter brunch and it disappeared quicker than any other dish. I added a little extra cinnamon and some golden raisins, but other than that followed the recipe as written. The caramel on the bottom is to die for, and I'm actually going to make it again this weekend for my family because it was so easy!

The dish was a huge hit!  I used challah bread and cut it up the night before and allowed it to dry out a bit.  I also put the cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg into the milk egg mixture.  I put 1/2 of the caramel on the bottom of the pan and half on top.  Used the ideas from others and cooked it at 425 for 15 minutes and then turned it down to 350.  Definitely will make again!

Made for easter and both of my 9x13s were devoured.  If you stick exactly to the directions it will be perfect. I used 2 day old bakery challah bread and added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the egg mixture.  I also cooked at 400.  Will make this a staple holiday meal!

My family and friends  loved it!  I did have to put some syrup on top as it was a little too crusty/dry for my liking after baked. I would say I used a little less than 1/4 cup of syrup. I also I added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon to the beaten egg mixture.  Will make this agin.

2 thumbs up!! I made this for my teenage daughter and her friends sleepover. They "loved" it.  No changes were made. I really liked prepping the night before and waking to just popping it in the oven. I covered it with tin foil then removed it for the last 10 minutes.

I used a 9x13 pan and enough bread cubes to completely cover the bottom, and I skipped the brown sugar on top. Just used cinnamon. Other than that I prepared it and baked it exactly as the recipe called for and it was excellent.  Even my picky teenagers loved it! I will definitely make again!

First time I made it was good but a little soggy and it flattens out a little after cooking it so I added more bread, the whole loaf of french bread, to make it thicker and substituted half the milk for heavy cream and it came out much better. I put confectioners sugar on top when done and a little maple syrup. Even better the next day. I now make it about once a week. I've also made it with a loaf of regular bread when didn't have other on hand but poured some egg/milk mixture between layers of three and was just as good.

This recipe was very easy to make, fun actually. My wife had friends over for a brunch. It is a show stopper at first sight and filled the house with a wonderful smell. The taste was awesome. I added more milk/vanilla/ egg mixture and it turn out great!

The recipe is the same as a bread pudding, so if you don't like a wetter, mushier consistency  then you won't like the 'mouth feel' . My husband likes  drier foods versus my preference for wetter ones, whether it's mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs or French toast casseroles. So I used 5 eggs and baked a little longer at 400F to meet him halfway.  :-). Still a bread pudding but a little drier inside. After you top it with real maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream, you'll forget all about it...

This was a hit at my house!! I followed the recipe using a few day old loaf of French bread chopped up. My husband and 16 month old loved it! I would definitely make this again. Reheats just fine in the microwave.

I made it as written but put the sugar and butter in the microwave. I also put a Silpat on the bottom of the baking dish to help with clean up.
Let it sit overnight. 
After baking the sugar was crunchy on the bottom. No one complained but it bothered me. It felt like I was eating sandy food. 
Maybe melting the butter/sugar in the micro was the problem, not sure but I did not like it.
I am going to try it again melting the sugar/butter in a saucepan. 
I'll continue using the silpat because I had no problem with clean up.

Omg I didn't like it! I just knew it was going to be yummy. Kids would even eat but a few spoons of it. I followed the directions exactly except maybe I used too much bread?? It was borderline dry and I used the bread we had on hand. Bummer.

My family & I really liked it!  After reading the suggestions, I tried to make sure that I would not have mushy centers, and it was great!  Probably helped that I wanted to make this a couple of weeks ago.  The wheat baguette  was pretty dried out!  Also, I baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Yum!

I keep using this recipe and my family cleans the dish every time.  Been sharing the recipe too! Perfect for those big brunches since it's a make ahead. The top can get a little crispy, so watch the last 10 minutes. I use one whole loaf of long skinny french bread and add at least 3 more eggs and 1 cup milk. Serve with a breakfast meat and fresh fruit. And if you want to add more richness, mix in some brioche - it's amazing!

I had tried this dish at a friends house it was very good. The moment I ate it I knew I wanted to make a few changes. I made it but used Hawaiian rolls instead of French bread. Since Hawaiian Rolls are extremely soft. I first placed them in freezer then took them out and cut them using a bread knife. I placed them on a cookie sheet at 350 to get toasty. Removed them and continued the recipe however I also smashed bananas. Leaving the  brown sugar and butter mixture on bottom, placed the toasty Hawaiian rolls, spread the mashed bananas added another layer toasty Hawaiian rolls. I didn't think adding  3 cups of liquid would be wise since it's a softer bread and since I added bananas I used two cups poured the egg, milk and vanilla mixture all over making sure all was completely smothered, added  cinnamon .  It was extremely tasty and a perfect Sunday morning or holiday dish.

I would highly recommend the following revisions; 
Before making it I thought 450 was way too hot, 2 cups of milk and 6 eggs (too eggy) were too much. 
So, I did 1 1/4 cups of milk and 3 eggs and baked at 375. I also used texas toast (found in grocery store in bread section not frozen garlic toast) 
It turned out amazing. 
I followed the remainder of the recipe. Highly recommend.

Made this for a New Year's Day Brunch. It was a hit. Everyone said it was delicious and I had three requests for the recipe. The only change I made was adding one more egg because mine were quite small and I used a boule bread which I cut into one inch cubes. I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe exactly and I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to use a GOOD French baguette. I used one that was fresh baked from my grocery store, but I have a feeling this recipe would taste even better with a REAL crusty baguette. It was such an easy dish to throw together the night before.

I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract to the butter brown sugar mix, cut up sausage patties and added it to the casserole prior to baking, topped with bacon and baked at 400 for 40 mins right after prep. I didn't have time to let it sit every night. It's a hit!

I used some stale Challah bread left over from the holidays and followed the recipe as written.  I followed others comments and baked at 350 for 1 hour.  It was delicious.  I served it with softened cream cheese that I had thinned slightly with orange juice and whipped cream.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you for the easy recipe!

I tried t make this exactly as written, but I realized that I had bought dark brown sugar instead of light brown.  This made it have a more molasses type taste , which I didn't care for. It was just too sweet for me. My daughter, who has a sweet tooth loved it.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I've tried a lot of different recipes for an overnight French toast that I could put in the oven in the morning, but my biggest complaint is that most of them were much too sweet or added too many spices.  This one was perfect.  It was definitely not overly sweet, so it was perfect with syrup added.  I sliced strawberries that we had with this and it was a great match.  One unusual feature of this recipe was the first step of melting the butter and brown sugar on the bottom of the baking dish.  When it was done this added an interesting note on the bottom of the French toast.  Everybody loved this one.

Made it for Christmas morning. Made it Friday. Baked it Saturday. Warmed it Sunday (Christmas). I feed 25 for Christmas brunch and then later for dinner so I have to prepare early and think about oven space. This casserole was perfect. Everyone loved it.

So delicious! I loved how I could make this the day before. It was baking as the kids were opening their presents... and then it was fully cooked just in time for when they were done! Yup... definitely a keeper.

This was a huge hit with my family on Christmas morning. And ideal for me, since I was able to make it ahead of time. I changed the baking temp/time so I could cook it alongside an egg/sausage strata (350 for 45 mins or until done). Also, served with syrup on the side, but it really didn't need it.  Have already shared the recipe 3 times.

Made this Christmas eve for Christmas morning.  I've tried other variations of this, but my kids LOVED this one! I agree with other posters, you do not need maple syrup, this has such great caramel sweet flavor.  I had it on the table and some of them used it on the side to dip in, but that was it.  I used a loaf of french bread that was a day old, kind of crusty and hard, which was perfect.  When I tried this type of casserole before, I used a regular loaf of bread which basically turned to mush.  The only other variations to this was that I only used 5 eggs, and I sprinkled both more brown sugar and cinnamon on in the morning before I cooked.  Also I took the advice of a previous post and cooked the casserole at 450 for the first 15 minutes, then cooked for a half hour at 350. Served with a side of maple bacon.  It was perfect!

Easy breakfast for busy weekend/holiday! my only problem was the caramel sauce on the bottom burned. no problems with soggy bread, just burnt caramel sauce. flavor was good otherwise. I followed the recipe exactly with 1 exception, I substituted half the milk for heavy cream (I always use cream in my French toast and omelets). we used a fresh loaf of Italian bread, not dried or crusty, but a nice fluffy loaf that was diced. It soaked up most of the mixture in 5-10 min. Next time I will reduce the heat to 350-375 and cook a little longer.

I make this every year for Christmas and it's a family favorite. TWEAKS: I substitute Challah bread for some added sweetness and egg nog instead of milk. The boost of flavor is to die fore! Bake it at 350 for 45 minutes instead of 450 for 30 minutes for a more even bake and to prevent the caramel layer on the bottom from burning.  Bake it covered with tin foil to prevent the top from burning and then remove during last 15 minutes.  This year, I'm going to sprinkle the top with a mixture of brown sugar, butter and pecans for even more decadence! Happy Holidays!!! (Hint: if your attempt at this dish came out soggy it's probably because you didn't use enough bread.)

This was very good but I think I'll have to tweak it a bit for next time.  Less egg/milk mixture (or more bread), since we found it to be a bit too custardy for our taste (the flavor was wonderful tho).   I also think that I'll add less of the brown sugar to the top, as it made the dish a bit too sweet for us.  I like a french toast that you can eat with maple syrup, and this one is too sweet to add syrup to.  I'm looking forward to trying it again because it is so easy and such a great base to be creative!

Made this for a Christmas brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I did have to cook it a bit longer to get it set in the middle,but  I believe it has a lot to do with oven variations and/or amount in casserole.  I did adjust amount to accommodate my needs.

I made this for 20 people for the halfway house I support for monthly dinners. The guys loved it and asked if I could bring it every month! The only thing I did differently was cook it at 425 for close to an hour.

It was delicious. Even my grandson who is very picky loved it. My only problem is that the bottom burned a little. I cooked it for a shorter length of time than the directions called for. Next time I will cook it on a lower temperature.

Might make it again. I think the temp of 450 is too high. The brown sugar and butter mixture on bottom of baking dish was burnt to a crisp. The french toast part was done but the burnt flavor went through the entire casserole.

This was not sweet enough and it was soggy. Followed the instructions to a T and my kids hated it. Would give it another try if someone has a better suggestion. Almost like it is missing ingredients.

I didn't let it sit for 8hrs (more like 1 hr), but it started burning long before the custard was cooked. I also added apples and raisins. The flavor was ok.

This had great taste and was very easy. Love that you put it together the day before. The next time I make this I will use a slightly smaller pan, I found that too much bread was left out of the egg mixture and didn't get softened. Also, I will reduce the heat, maybe 400degrees because the tips were very done. The best note is: it was really good reheated in the microwave!

I'd give this five stars but I don't know what it tastes like with the butter and brown sugar (I left it out because I prefer to drizzle maple syrup over it).  My picky little eaters LOVE this.
I prepare this the night before and then I look like a hero the next morning. I have to line my pan with foil though because this sticks like none other and I destroyed a pan trying to get it clean.

I made if for the first time exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious! There is enough sweetness that we didn't even need any syrup or powdered sugar!  I tore up the loaf of bread into bite size pieces the day before and let it sit out all day to dry out. It turned out just right. I would consider letting the pieces sit out even longer; a few were still soft.

After reading so many baked french toast recipes stating that it was mushy, I was hesitant to try baking it. I used this recipe, just different directions.  I made sure my bread sat out for an hour and then poured the egg mixture on the bread. I let it fully absorb.  For the topping, I added 3 T of maple syrup to the brown sugar and butter, and heated it all in the microwave for 2 minutes, stirred and heated on high another 2.5 minutes.  I baked the egg, vanilla and milk soaked bread for 20 minutes on 450 in a metal pan, foil lined.  I pulled it out and poured the topping over it.  Returned it to the oven for another 10 minutes.  No mush and it was a hit.  I will use this every time I make a family portion of french toast.

Very good and easy to make the night before.  It was very sweet and not necessary to add brown sugar on top before baking.  Served with powered sugar instead of syrup.  Did add a lot more cinnamon and some nutmeg !!

I served this at a ladies group breakfast. Although I doubled it and the dishes were not identical everybody seemed to love it. One dish had canned fried apples topping it, plus blueberries and pecans. The other dish actually had more liquid and I left out the apples. I probably cooked it longer too. Both were wonderful. I don't think this recipe can be messed up.

I've made other breakfast casseroles, but this one was the best.  I got rave reviews from my family.  It fed 8 easily.  Preparation was very easy and most things needed were already in my kitchen.

I would double the butter and brown sugar coating that goes in the bottom. And I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. Allspice to the egg-milk mixture. I cooked it on 400 for 45 minutes, which was fine. 450 just seemed too high compared to similar casseroles I've made in the past.

This recipe is amazing!  I've made it twice and baked at 425 the second time to avoid burning.  I added pecans, blueberries and bananas.   It's was a huge hit at my two brunches and now they are a must have!!!

I used less sugar so we could add maple syrup :)  Also crumbled bacon on the top!  Everyone gave it a 5.  The only reason I didn't is bc I felt it was a little too soggy.  I think next time I'll try a more dense bread than Italian.

This is amazing and is great as French toast, a coffee cake or dessert. I did add an additional two handfuls of blueberries and it was worth it. I would use a bit less sugar and/or less strudel going forward.  . I also baked it in a round well greased calphalon pot and removed it....a beautiful presentation.  My bread was actually two month old stale challah....no waste here. I am looking forward to making it again and am considering bringing it as my contribution to an upcoming brunch.  Maple syrup on top when warm puts this dish over the top!

This is delicious!  We are diabetic, so I used Splenda brown sugar.  With Splenda brown sugar you use 1/2 of what it calls for.  I did not put the brown sugar on the top and I did not use syrup on it.

Mom and dad love sweets, so because they are borderline diabetics,  I used a Splenda type brown sugar, sugar free syrup,  and I added pecans  (their favorite.) This is much better than the sweet rolls they like.

Made this for a beach house full of people and it was a hit. Dish was wiped clean. Gonna try adding sliced bananas and candied pecans prior to layering the bread this weekend. Will report back.

I made this dish an one hour before baking and it tasted great! I didn't change anything in the recipe. I do agree with the sogginess in the middle being a set back because I left it in the oven a longer to let it harden but that caused the top break peaks to get a little too brown and crispy. Still it tasted great and as stated in other reviews, no syrup or butter needed!

I really appreciated how simply this dish came together.  I prepared it the night before and then popped it in the oven when we got home from church and it was ready to go very quickly (mine only required 20 minutes to cook).  I served it with a side of bacon, also made in the oven.  It was a hit on Father's Day!

This turned out  great.  It's so easy that it will be my go to dish whenever I have overnight guests.  I used cinnamon challah bread and, because it's already sweet, I did not add the extra brown sugar on top.  I also added whole pecans to the brown sugar syrup on the bottom of the dish and then chopped pecans on top.  No problem with the mushiness that other reviewers mentioned.  It was beautifully browned and puffed up.  I may dust with powdered sugar next time.

This was simple and delicious. I had a loaf of sliced whole wheat that I used (let slices sit on a cookie cooling rack for the day). I added a pint of blueberries to the top before adding the egg-milk mixture, and covered the tray in aluminum foil before baking -- removing for the last 5 minutes of cooking. I served with slivered almonds sprinkled on top. This was sweet enough no syrup is necessary. I will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as written with one exception, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the milk mixture. This was soooo yummy. The brown sugar and butter formed a perfectly gooey goodness crust.

We have had the same traditional breakfast for Christmas for years but I decided to add this to our menu this year and it will now be part of our traditional Christmas breakfast.  Everybody in my family absolutely loved it -- and I have some picky eaters!  But I also plan to serve it on many other occasions besides breakfast. It's good for special occasions as well as the everyday breakfast that you just want to be yummy.  I love that it can be prepared the night before which makes the morning so much easier.  Absolutely delicious!

I did have to make some changes based on what I had on hand but the basic idea was the same. I used vanilla almond milk, one less egg, gluten free bread that was practically stale, etc. But my son liked it and that says a lot. He didn't even use syrup. I did have to tent it with aluminum foil and turn the heat down quite a bit at the end to get it to cook through the middle but no burnt edges. Overall a good recipe that can be tweaked for your needs.

This is a great recipe. I made it twice following the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. No need for additional syrup, the caramel sauce added enough sweetness. I served with lightly sweetened homemade whipped cream and mixed berries. The last time I added apple chunks to half of the bottom of the pan and it was great too. Definitely will be making it regularly, so easy and so delicious!

Made as it was not good at all to me. Too eggy. If I was to make it again I would use a lot less egg or just egg yolks and add a sweet liquor to it as well.

I halved the recipe( for two people) and used bread I had on hand (white potato bread) that I had intended to use for traditional French toast. The recipe was very quick and easy.  Instead of baking it at such a high temperature, I lowered it to 375 and baked it for about 45 minutes. It came out puffy and tasted great!  As others stated, it was hard to stop eating it.  I will definitely make this recipe again, probably with the French bread.  Next time, I just might add some pecans to the bottom of the dish, too!

Great recipe, I followed it exactly adding frozen wild blueberries before sprinkling generously with cinnamon (did not add extra brown sugar on top) It was very easy and made an awesome Valentine's Day breakfast. Both my husband and almost 2 year old daughter loved it. It was nice to have the dish all together and not have to cook and keep warm the regular way! Will definitely make again, will try with whole wheat bread and maybe sub maple syrup for brown sugar on the bottom. Super delicious!

This was great.   Got rave reviews from guests.  I used a glass baking dish so did lower the baking temperature by 25 degrees.  I used a whole french bread loaf (other than the heels) cut into chunks, so more bread than recipe called for and it worked just fine.

This is a real crowd pleaser and probably the easiest brunch dish I've ever made...quick too! I whipped it up in the evening, refrigerated over night, and baked it just before serving. Everyone raved about it. Yummy! Highly recommend.

Love this as a treat as it is a little sweet. So easy to make. Next time I might decrease butter and sugar mix and serve with a syrup instead.

It was delicious.  I forgot to put the extra brown sugar on top, but didn't miss it.  I didn't have quite enough french bread and so added a plain croissant.  Mine started to get a little burnt on top so keep an eye on it in the oven.  Adding fruit would make it even better.

This is a delicious, easy French toast casserole.. I made a slight change because I made this for Christmas breakfast.. I added 1 cup of egg nog and 1 1/2 cups of milk.. I used crusty French bread and added cinnamon to the eggs and milk batter.. My family loved this recipe.. We also made scrambled eggs and ham and used a little syrup with the casserole.. I am making again tonight for New Years breakfast.. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning. I followed the recipe except I mixed the cinnamon ( eyeballed it)in with the egg mixture. The next morning I poured some maple syrup over it, Put it in a sprayed 11x9 pan, and baked for about 35 minutes at  400 degrees.
It was WONDERFUL!  A little bit of crunch and moist in the middle! The perfect consistency. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for Christmas morning.  It really was as fast and easy as it said.  Everyone liked it, but it was very sweet!  Next time I will probably reduce the butter and brown sugar mixture to cut down on the sweetness a bit.  I also like more cinnamon taste in french toast so I will also add cinnamon to the egg mixture next time.  The basic recipe is very good and it is easy to adjust to your individual taste.  I was happy it wasn't mushy at all and I used challah bread for mine.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly since this was my first try, It is exactly as you would expect, custardy tasting eggy bread with the perfect base for a bit of sweetness at the bottom. Very, vert filling.

This has a very nice flavor but did anyone else have an issue with the top cooking too fast/burning? I even cut time by ten minutes and found a few of the bread tips burnt. I'll try decreasing temp next time as well as time.

I made no changes but instead followed the recipe to the letter.  Everyone loved it and had seconds. The only issue I had was that 450 for 30 minutes burnt the brown sugar on the bottom. We just scooped away the burnt sugar and used syrup. I will definitely make again but next time I will bake at a lower temperature.

Absolutely fantastic! I made it using challah bread and substituted half and half for the milk. It was phenomenal! Next time I'm going to try to make it with a cinnamon swirl going through it and add apples. It reminded me of the baked apple pancake from Bickfords.

The only thing was to make 1/2 the recipe.  After reading a number of other reviews, I was a little hesitant to try it.  I used some two-day old white bread from Paneras and it worked very well. Both my husband and I thought it was just fantastic! Would be great for company.  Will certainly make it again.  May add nuts to brown sugar butter mixture.  Thanks!

Fantastic and very easy to make.  The only changes I made were I used Mexican vanilla and instead of 2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of skim (the only thing I had) and a cup of half and half.  Served this for a Sunday champagne brunch with baked ham and a Waldorf salad. The best brunch ever!  This is a keeper!!!

This was great. I used Pepperidge Farm raisin bread and pumpkin swirl bread. instead of milk I used Pumpkin spice coffee creamer and I also added diced apples. For the topping I used some brown sugar and caramel sauce. OMG fabulous!!

Made this for my daughter's swim team breakfast.  They cleaned the pan!  I did double the recipe but bought an extra large foil pan to keep it shallow.  I accidentally set the oven to 425, but I think it worked better to cook it a little longer on a slower temp anyway.  After about 30 minutes I covered the browned puffed up edges with foil and noted that the center was still flat.  After 15 more minutes, the center also finally puffed up and browned.  Sprinkled a little bit of powdered sugar to the finished product.  Turned out delicious and I was getting requests for the recipe.  Especially loved the sugar bottom (tasted like pecan pie filling!)  Definitely keeping this as a potluck breakfast/brunch item, and maybe use it for sleepovers/Christmas, whenever we have a super busy morning but need a good breakfast.  Loved that I could make it the night before and just bake in the morning.  I will submit a photo as well.

This is a great way to use up home made bread.  I just cube it and store it in the fridge until I have enough (only a few days). Most recently I added 2 cups of blueberries while assembling this casserole.  You could add syrup to this but even my sweet tooth didn't think that was necessary.

This recipe was a huge hit at my parent's 50th anniversary brunch.  I made two casseroles side by side in the oven, turned out perfectly.  
Will make this again, and not just for a special event.

This French Toast turned out great and it is easy to fix.  Easy to get ready the night before for refrigeration and then just pop it into the oven in the morning.  It is sweet but not excessively...at least for me.  My husband enjoyed it as well.  I plan to serve this to overnight guests along with some Canadian Bacon and fresh fruit.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly - maybe with just a bit more cinnamon, but that's just my preference. I'm happy to be able to add this to my collection of favourites :)

Sooo good!! I used cinnamon raisin bread and sprinkled a little more than a tablespoon of brown sugar on top (before putting in oven) but otherwise followed recipe as is.

I haven't made this yet. I'm hoping to make it soon. My question is if using cream cheese would you mix it in with the eggs & milk mixture.?

This was incredibly good! I made it for a bridal shower brunch and it was a HUGE hit. I don't even like french toast and this was very tasty. I followed the suggestion of PAM on the pan and using day old bread. Baked it as is, no substitutions or additions.
It couldn't be any easier but you don't have to tell that to your guests. Enjoy!

Just delicious! My go-to for brunch, even friends ask me to bring it to theirs! I use brioche bread and make the recipe as is, however I bake it at 350 for 45 minutes and it's golden brown and cooked through. Maybe it's my oven but at 450 it got too done on top and dried out a bit.

I love this recipe and make it often for overnight guests. You make the night before and in the morning you just pop in the oven. People rave and think you did a lot more work than you did because it’s easy peasy. The complaints about cooking time and sogginess are silly - just use your judgment - if it still looks wet, for God’s sake just leave in another five minutes!

I made this for a birthday brunch for my husband, and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

This was a hit with my son and his band mates--they stay with us when on the road and playing near by, so it's a perfect thing to make the night before we go to the venue to hear them play and I know I'll be tired in the morning after staying up past my bedtime! I served this along with a big bowl of fresh berries and a salad of mixed greens--not a bite left at the end of brunch :)

This recipe was incredibly simple to make, and didn't required very many ingredients which is always a bonus in my book. It turned out delicious and was good with or without syrup.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  My husband and sons were fighting over who got to lick the pan.  I sprinkled a little nutmeg in with the egg mixture.  I also added an extra egg because I was using a larger french loaf that called for.  Served with cherry pie filling and powered sugar.  I also cooked up some bacon and sausage.   There was not a bite of anything left!

The flavor was good but it was to mushy in the inside for my family. I wonder if I did something wrong. I followed the recipe.
