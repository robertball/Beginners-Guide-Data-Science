I smoke my own cheese and was looking for ways to use up the mozzarella. This was very tasty! I might change up the seasonings next time. To note: I used way less cheese than called for. I'm a huge cheese lover, but a whole block of cheese on 4 breasts was a bit much. Also, depending on the size of your chicken breasts, you might have to cook them a few extra minutes. Few ingredients and great flavor for a simple weekday meal.
