4.3.18  This was absolutely delicious!  I’d bought a couple pounds of big frozen Argentinian Red Shrimp on sale at Publix last week for $7.99/lb, and they are simply amazing.  This recipe is so easy, the shrimp were so tender and perfectly cooked, the lime-butter sauce so bright and refreshing, it’s hard to put into words how much we enjoyed them.  Served with coconut rice, grilled pineapple drizzled with a plum glaze, and a wedge of fresh lime to squeeze over the shrimp. This was outstanding, thank you Miss Amy for sharing your recipe, going into my Favorites folder!***UPDATE 6.12.18:  A sauce that we like with these shrimp is Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce from this site.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was relatively simple to make and the flavor was great! I found I needed more oil, lime, and butter at the end for my pound of shrimp.
