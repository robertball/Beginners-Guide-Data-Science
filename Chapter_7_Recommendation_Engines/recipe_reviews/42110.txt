My husband and I had all my family to our house for Thanksgiving this year.  It was the first timeI had ever cooked an entire turkey with dressing and gravy.  So this was a big deal. Everything had to be perfect.  I came across this recipe and thought I'd try it out.  IT WAS AWESOME!!  It was very easy and didn't take a long time to prepare.  The chestnuts really add a nice flavor texture to the stuffing. And it goes GREAT with gravy.  We will be adding this to our repetoire of family recipes to be used on Thanksgivings and Christmas' in our homes from here on out.  Thank you for sharing!

Sincerely,
Paige Cassidy

I submitted this recipe 4 years ago and thought I'd come back and see how people have liked it. Thank you for all the nice feedback! I'll be sure to pass this along to my Nana, she'll be thrilled. From what I gather this recipe may call for too much bread. I am going to try it this year with one loaf and see how it goes (it also depends on the size of your bird). I hope you try this with your family, they're sure to love it like my family does! Honestly I look more forward to this stuffing than the turkey!! Thanks again and happy Thanksgiving!

Yum! The flavor of this stuffing is so good, I can't wait to make it for Christmas!  The next time I make it though, I will only use one loaf of bread so it is a little bit more moist.

I don't remember if I wrote last year after Thanksgiving, but this stuffing is amazing.  My 90 yr old mother-in-law said it was the best stuffing she has ever had, and she is never making stuffing again, because "mine" was so good.  Quite a complliment from an Italian mother-in-law!!!  I'm making it again this year, can't wait.  thanks.

Maybe I read something incorrectly, but I had to use half the bread that was called for in the recipe.  What I did make was very good, though.

The chestnuts were meaty and added great flavor to the stuffing.  I used only half the bread, but it was still a bit dry.  The butter also added a uniqueness to the stuffing instead of the usually chicken broth.  Next time I might add another egg or two.

Dry and tasteless.  Perhaps 1 loaf of bread would have worked.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! I'll make it again next year. My husband just happened to come in from work with a bag full of chestnuts someone had given him, so I found this recipe and, wow.  I did cheat and use a 1 lb bag of the herbed stuffing, but the chestnuts really made all the difference. Actually, I don't think I can wait until next year. Christmas is right around the corner....

I was the original poster of this recipe and I love checking back in year after year to see more people have tried it!   **Just a friendly reminder, the recipe calls for 2 loaves of bread but it seems to work much better with 1-1 1/2 loaves to avoid dryness.  You could also add another egg if you prefer to use 2 loaves.** 
Thanks so much for enjoying my Nana's recipe, this is a true tradition in my family and I'm thrilled to share it. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving 2007!

I made this on Christmas; everyone loved it but myself, the one who made it, HATED it which is why I only give it 3 stars. Here's some hints: use 1 1pound loaf of bread, any more and it will be way too dry. Grease the baking dish before putting in ingredients. Add more than just onions as it tends to be bland. Under cook your chestnuts, overcook them and they turn out mushy. Use 1/3 cup of milk, more than just 1/4 cup, otherwise it won't be moist enough.

This was fantastic!  Probably the star of our Thanksgiving table.  I did use a full 2 pounds of bread, but it wasn't just plain old bread - it was an artisan country white.  I cubed and dried the bread overnight.  Also, i added a full cup of chicken stock because it really was dry, plus dashes of rosemary, thyme, sage, extra salt and pepper on top of the poultry seasoning.  I sort of wondered if the eggs were really necessary at that point, they just sort of settled on the bottom and cooked.  They didn't distract, but i can't say they added anything either.  Probably next time i won't use them since i added the stock.  Still, even with all the changes, this is a wonderful recipe that will be making an appearance at our holiday table for many years to come!  Thank you!

I used one loaf of bread, cut into small cubes, and half way through cooking added 1 1/2 cups of turkey brooth so it was more moist. The best stuffing we have ever had! Wow!!

The flavor of this dish was pretty good. You do have to be careful about how much bread you use if you want a moist stuffing.  Mine was a little too dry I think. Allow for some time to peel and chop the chestnuts (it took me almost an hour). I have never used them before so there may be a trick to it. I don't know. I do know I was hating them at the time.

Delicious. Like others I only used half the called-for bread, and even at that I added some broth at the last minute to make it moister, but the flavor was wonderful.

Yummy! I added fresh sage and rosemary as well as celery and roasted my chestnuts on the fire, I also used butter instead of margerine. It was just perfect! I will make this every year! Mmm...

Tasted fine, I did use only one loaf of bread.  It was DRY, even with some added turkey drippings.  I would add a can broth to it next time.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think the reason I didn't care for it was my own fault.  I used only 1 loaf and margarine instead of butter, and it was really greasy (definitely not dry!).  The chestnuts were a pain in the butt but they were tasty, and I added golden raisins (I like a lot of "stuff" in my stuffing).  I will definitely try again with real butter, and I may add more raisins or cranberries.

My first attempt at stuffing, and it was a awesome! After stuffing the turkey with it, I realized I'd forgotten the eggs and milk step.  Had more stuffing that the 18lb turkey could take, so baked the remainder. Both came out delicious, with the stuffed being more moist and the baked more firm but not dry.  One problem I did have was that many of the chestnuts were moldy and/or black, so actually ended up with less than the recipe called for.  Next time, I'll buy more nuts.

This was tasty, but I think there should be more chestnuts in it, I did take the other reviewers advice and half the amount of bread and I added half a small tin of water chestnuts that I had leftover but it still needed more. It's a good starting point though. Thank you

I used half the amount of bread and everything else the same (per other  reviewer suggestions) and it was perfect! I used half a loaf of dark swirl bread and baked a tube of buttermilk biscuits and crumbled those together. I will make this again for Thanksgiving!

Sounds very similar to my nona's recipe but I notice the directions say to cook it in its own pan and I wonder, has anyone cooked it in the bird?

Very good recipe.  Didn't use margarine, used butter. Also used turkey broth to moisten.  Very tasty recipe.

I never review things, I typically forget. But this was WORTH IT! My dad gave me chestnuts two days before Thanksgiving and he asked me to make stuffing. I'm from New Orleans and I've only ever made cornbread and sausage stuffing! So I found this recipe. I used 3/4 of a 1.4 pound loaf of bread instead of 2 loaves. It was perfect!!!!!! My dad loves it. He literally used his key to my house to steal the leftovers.

Awesome! I used half butter half oil, roasted chestnuts, and one loaf of unsalted tuscan-style bread. I was thinking "wow that's a lot of oil" but worked out fine. Will make this again for sure.

Very good.  I tried roasting the chestnuts instead of boiling, and some of them popped, making a big mess.  It is a job to prepare them!

I have to say this stuffing was amazing. I only used 1 loaf of bread and it wasnt dry at all. Everyone complemented me.
