I've made this many times by hand following the recipe exactly as written.  It isn't perfectly textured, but it is super easy, fast, and delicious.    I pre-bake the crust at 425 for about 5-6 minutes, then add toppings and bake for another 8-10 minutes.  I make homemade pizza at least one weeknight a week, so thank you very much for posting this recipe - it's been a huge timesaver and a nice treat for everyone.

Perfect, great taste, great texture.   I only used 2 and 1/2 cups of flour. I also used a 1/2 tablespoon sugar to proof the yeast (1/2 cup water at 110 degrees).

Very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and was able to make 4 large pizzas. I used the dough hook on my mixer to mix and get to a ball. Then I kneaded by hand until smooth. I did add 1tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp oregano. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe and made the dough in my kitchen aid mixer.  I used this calzone dough recipe to make a taco braid.  Turned out amazing and super yummy!

We had impromptu company so I didn't have time to make dough in the bread maker.  I've never kneaded dough, so I put on some reggae and went to town for the 8 minutes it suggests.  I'm not sure if it was as soft as a horse's nose, but the finished result was beautiful!  I rolled it out with a rolling pin a little larger than the round pan, placed in to the pan, and rolled the edges to match the pan. It turned out just like a delivery pizza!  I brushed it with olive oil and pre-cooked it for 5 minutes, added toppings, and cooked for another 20 min.  Perfect!  Loved this!

Nice recipe and very versatile.   Pizza, calzones, bread sticks.  The method works and the ratio of water to flour is good.  Depending on the humidity where you live,  you may need a little more or less flour. 
I used my stand mixer, for mixing and kneading.  Very easy. Thanks for a solid recipe.

Followed the recipe and it came out great, I made it ahead of time and placed it in the refrigerator to keep it from rising, I used it with my new calzone maker and they came out nice and crispy.

We followed the recipe as stated and it was perfect!  We used it to make four medium calzones and had enough left over to make a pizza.

My first attempt at homemade pizza dough and it came out great! I used the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid for the mixing and kneading so it was super simple. The only change I made was to exchange one cup of white flour for whole wheat.

Made with bread flour and it was great.  I added the ingredients to my bread machine and let it mix and knead the dough, refrigerated it in an oiled bowl overnight, then made breakfast pizza the next morning.  I have tried tons of different recipes for homemade pizza, and I just deleted all of them. This one is a keeper.

I love this recipe.  It's quick, easy and tastes fantastic. The honey gives the dough a hint of sweetness.   I made calzones and took the advise of others by adding herbs into the dough. I like a sweet and salty taste, so I'm going to try a gentle sprinkling of sea salt over the tops before baking next time. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I made it for the first time and made bread sticks, turn out great.  Now I'm ready to try pizza and calzones.   Works up fast  and easy.  Only one problem, I could have eaten the entire batch!  Glad I had some help with them, everyone enjoyed them.  Next time I will try brushing on some butter and a bit of garlic salt.

I make this recipe often for calzones or pizza. I add garlic butter on top of the calzones with parmesan or mozzarella at the last 5 mins.

I thought this was easy and quick, the only reason I rated this 4 stars is because I used whole wheat instead of white and so it made the texture weird so if you are making this don’t use whole wheat lol

Good taste and easy to make. Not my preferred texture, but perhaps I should have kneaded it longer. I added garlic powder & dried basil to the dough but couldn't really taste them.I used bread flour,  not all purpose flour. Will make it easier again.

Wow! I have made pizza dough and breads for years and wanted to try a different recipe than my go to one. This is amazing. The ratios are perfect and create a very smooth pizza dough. I did not even need extra flour to roll out or to put on my roller. I made this by hand, not machine, and folded it over itself about 25 times to create lots of air pockets for a nice rise.
Thank you so much for posting!

I've added a little bit more sugar to the batter and used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  I also used a tablespoon more of yeast. They turned out great and will be making these again.

I didn't make any changes. Made just as the recipe states and we loved it! Dough was tender and nice and crispy. We only made two calzones so I have dough for another time!

This recipe is a keeper. I worked in a family owned pizza parlor during my early college years and this very closely resembles the flavor of the good old days. Great recipe to bring back great memories!

Besides using coconut oil (I was out of olive) & leaving it for a few minutes to rise because I had some stuff to do, I followed the recipe exactly as is and i have no regrets. It was sooo delicious. Restaurant quality I tell you! Thank you do much for this.

This is not my favorite tasting dough, but I’m rating it based on ease and speed, which is what it touts. I used for 1 Stromboli and it was a little more dough than I needed. I will use recipe again only if I’m in a pinch.

If you don't use sugar to cure the yeast pre-mixing, it cuts the too sweet. I added powdered garlic to the dough, knowing I was using it for individual calzones for a potluck dinner's main course: pepperoni; sausage and bell pepper; ham; spinach; mushroom and tomato; and plain eight cheese calzones. Even the six year olds complimented the meal! Served with burgundy wine marinara on the side.

Made the dough way ahead of time. Put it in the fridge for 4 hours. Made a beautiful pizza. Won't be buying it any more. Very good texture and flavor. We all loved it.

I pretty much follow the directions except I add the full one cup of warm water. My family loves it. I always bake my pizzas or calzones on a puzzle stone. Perfect every time and I always get compliments on how yummy it is!

The best I have ever tried! Most of the homemade  crust recipes I've tried were tasteless and brittle, but this one has great taste and texture! Easy to make. I only used 1 tbsp of honey because I added 1/2  tbsp of  sugar  to the yeast and water. I make this crust a couple times a month and would gladly pass it on to someone if they were looking for an awesome pizza crust recipe!

Finished raw dough product was easy to work with, good elasticity. Used it for pizza, baked texture was great, taste was bland. I'll make this again but next time throw in some herbs.

Yum!  
This makes me miss Fresh and Easy and their pizza dough balls a little bit less.  Their whole wheat was the BEST, I'm trying this recipe next with whole wheat flour.
I put cilantro and garlic salt IN the crust, and then made bbq chicken pizza.
Also, sprinkling just a little cornmeal on the pizza stone or pizza pan under the dough gives it that extra salty zing.

Great recipe!!! delicious!!! When I make pizza with this recipe I usually have to cook it about 30-35 minutes at 400degrees. maybe I'm putting too many toppings though? anyways, this recipe is awesome.

I have been making homemade pizzas for few years now. The dough turned out surprisingly very soft with this recipe. I made  Calzones and they turned out great. This is my new go-to recipe now!

Cooked up a great pizza, my three yr old has been taking an hour to eat anything lately and even he gobbled up his portion of cheese pizza in no time. Had onion, olives, garlic and mushroom on mom n dads side, mom absolutely loved it and wants me to make it again soon.

Followed recipe to the T. Had to ad a little more H2O in order to get right consistency. Delicious, light airy crust. I baked at 475 for 10 minutes but I think my oven is out of whack so keep close eye on it so you don't burn it. Super easy and fun to make

GREAT recipe! I  was easily able to increase the recipe in order to use it to make stromboli for 200 kids!
