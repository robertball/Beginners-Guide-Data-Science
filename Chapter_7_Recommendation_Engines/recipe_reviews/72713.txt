I prepare spinach like this routinely, but never with onion, so I knew when I saw this recipe I was going to love it. Using the ingredients called for, I did prepare this a little differently. I fried diced bacon till almost crisp, drained off some of the grease, then added the onions followed by the garlic. No need for the extra step of removing the bacon from the pan. This went perfectly served with "Beef Kabobs with Parmesan Orzo," also from this site.

Yum!  Changes I made--I used the bacon drippings instead of draining them off and cut back on the amount of oil used to compensate.  I also drained the spinach after cooking as another reviewer suggested and sprinkled the spinach liberally with salt right after adding it.  My family loved it--thanks!

This was so simple and tasty.  BE CAREFUL!!! If you add the garlic while your pan s too hot you will scorch the garlic making it bitter.

Very good! I read the reviews first and cut way back on the oil. This is a great basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to suit individual tastes but I agree with others and cut back on the oil OR leave it out entirely and just use the bacon grease.

Too darn greasy!!!!!  It might be acceptable if you use only enough bacon fat to coat the pan, and skip the butter and oil.

Very Good, I poured the final mixture over a strainer to get rid of most of the water released from the spinach before serving so that the juices wouldn't run all over the plate.

Very good! Simple, easy and delicious! I prepared this differently as some other reviewers did. I fried diced up bacon till almost crisp, drained off some of the grease, then added red onions followed by the garlic. I skipped the part of draining the grease. I omitted the butter and extra olive oil because I wanted the bacon fat to flavor the spinach on its own. I threw in the fresh spinach, stir fried until just about done retaining its green color. I finished with a sprinkle of a little Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. This was perfectly flavored and everyone savored every bite until it was gone! This is also a great way to get everybody to each their vegetables too. . I served this with, “Beef Kabobs with Parmesan Orzo,” also from this website.

This was a little oily for us.  I will try again using bacon drippings, 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

This recipe inspired a great dish! I used 4 slices of thick-cut bacon.  After frying it, I kept the bacon grease, rather than adding butter and oil.  I put the bacon, onion and garlic into a food processor, and then sautéed it in the grease with some mushrooms.  Finally, I added the spinach, covered, and cooked it on low for 5 minutes.  The result was flavorful and a little musky.  My wife and I loved it!

This just didnt do it for me.  I really thought it would, anything with bacon right?  But I just thought it needed something else for my tastes.  Balsamic maybe?  Maybe cut the butter also - I would just have preferred something lighter so I should have chosen a different recipe, but the bacon grabbed my attention.  So as written, this one didnt make the cut for me but glad to see others enjoy it.  We all have different taste buds :)

It was perfect. For those of you who found it to greasy if you reread the direction it says to Drain the bacon. It wasn't greasy if you did that

I used coconut oil instead of butter and olive oil and reduced the amount. I also used pre-made bacon. Very tasty!

I cut the bacon into small pieces to cook it quicky, and then removed them when crisp.  Instead of using the olive oil, I just used the bacon grease.  Then, I followed the recipe exactly.  At the end, just before serving, I added the crisp bacon pieces to keep them crispy.  This was a really good recipe and we'll be using it often.

This was great but still greasy after my attempt to reduce the fat.  I did drain the bacon fat (and only used 3 slices) but I will omit the butter next time; I just don't think it's necessary.

I had alot of spinach left over and little time to use it, so I made this. My family LOVES bacon so I figured anything with bacon they will eat. It turned out pretty alright, I did not use any oil, I just used the bacon grease which I highly reccomend, but dont keep ALL the grease in the pan. DEFINATELY drain some, as ours was SOOOOOO greasy,  but we ate it and it was loved all around. Next time I will drain at least 3/4 of the grease, and maybe drain the spinach when I am done. This is a keeper!

THIS WAS AWESOME! I love spinach and have always had them with onions, garlic, and butter. From now on I will ALWAYS add some bacon with my pan fried spinach and use Vidalia Onions if it is in season. Served with "Bow Ties with Sausage, Tomatoes and Cream" with a side of fresh picked carrots. A perfect meal!

I was looking for something new using spinach and bacon today so I tried this recipe.  I used fresh spinach and added vinegar as several recommended.  Tastes wonderful but my husband refused to try it so it looks like this is my lunch.  Really good!

Yummy!  I made it per the recipe except I decreased the butter and oil a bit.  Also, adding a bit of feta cheese to the top made it even better.

Loved this:):)!! Doubled the ingredients 4 tablespoons of buter, 1/2 cup of olive oil, chopped up fresh garlic instead of minced, 32+ ounces of spinach (not packed down), 10 slices of bacon (I know). This was to feed 4. The spinach shrinks so that's why I tried doubling everything. Hubby, youngest kiddo and I loved it. Older kiddo not so much but she ate it:)!!

I didn't like this, but my husband did, so it gets three stars from me. I took the advice of other reviewers and used the bacon drippings instead of oil, but it was still way oily. I won't be making this again.

Awesome. The whole family loved it. When I made it the first time, I under-estimated how much my family would like it. They were disappointed not to have another helping!

Wow!!!! All I have to say is the first time I made this, my husband, who hates spinach, asked when I could make more.  Fabulous.

I thought this dish was too greasy despite adding less olive oil and butter.

I love this recipe because it's easy to prepare, delicious and can be modified easily.  We had lots of fresh spinach from the garden and were looking for a way to prepare it other than boiling.
I sauteed the garlic and crumbled bacon in the bacon grease with just a splash of olive oil.  Didn't have sweet onion. I just sauteed the spinach about 2 minutes until it just started to wilt.  I didn't lower the heat or cover the pan for 5 minutes.  I finely chopped about 3 mushrooms and just tossed them into the hot spinach in the bowl and the 'shrooms cooked themselves.  Seasoned it all with a little lemon pepper.  Everyone loved it.

Made no changes the 1st time and loved it. And then tried using cabbage instead of spinach. And your recipe is great with both. Will be on my table quite often, great as a side dish or by itself.

Simple and delicious! I added sliced mushrooms to mine and served it with grilled flank steak for a low carb meal.

Made this to go with pulled pork sandwiches. I had fairly good bacon so I didn't have a lot of grease after frying the bacon. I only added about a tablespoon of butter when I added the onion and garlic and no olive oil. I will be making this dish  more often.

You don't need nearly the amount of oil that the recipe suggests.  Just enough of the bacon fat to coat the pan, and oil OR butter is sufficient.  It's too oily otherwise, and you don't taste the spinach.  I'll add this to the list.

I was surprised that the onions fully cooked but everything came out great and quite tasty. I am just starting to learn to cook with my old Griswold cast iron, and was pleasantly surprised at how great this dish turned out. :)

I had a similar recipe handed down from my grandmother but she used silver beet.  I add some celery leaves if I have them.  Your recipe and mine are loved by my friendside and family.

Made this tonight.  Followed directions except since I had already seared prime rib in a cast iron pan I used those juices to cook on.  Came out fantastic,  would make it again.

This was very good!  I didn't see the point in letting all of those beautiful bacon drippings go to waste, so I just used what was in the pan instead of the butter/oil combo.  Not as healthy, but certainly delish!  Thanks!

This is a great way to make spinach.  It kinda reminded me alot of collard greens.  I used frozen spinach.  My kids splashed theirs with red wine vinegar however I ate mine just as is with a little salt.

I didn't use the butter, just the olive oil and right before serving splashed with red-wine vinegar.  Something my dad does to all his greens so grew up doing the same.

A little greasy- I would use less oil next time. I really liked it (but I love spinach), my husband a kids would not even try it (they do not like spinach). If you like spinach it is worth a try.

O.K. but nothing more. A 3* rating is being very generous.
