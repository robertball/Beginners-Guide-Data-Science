This was a HIT!! Both my mother and I loved it! I did make a few changes,  the number on the calories seemed too high for this and I cut some things down and out. No black beans, no corn in a cup; I used some Birds eye Steamable, frozen corn. I didn't use any oil..just Pam spray. And no tortilla chips.
I put buttermilk ranch dressing and in the end it was 391 calories!
I was also told that I would HAVE to make this again.
