Delicious! My husband said it was as good as the shrimp dish I order at our favorite Chinese restaurant.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added extra ginger and 2 tbs oyster sauce. Used heavy duty aluminum foil instead of parchment paper just because it was easier for me to handle. The 15 minute cooking time was  just right. The shrimp were perfect! Served over jasmine rice, this dish is definitely a keeper!

I just skipped the parchment paper mess, used a covered baking dish, it came out great.  This one will be a repeat.  I doubled the liquid and added  2 tablespoons of water.  Also, I only keep low sodium soy sauce, so the next time I will add a dash of salt and a pinch of pepper.  Anything with sea food in it needs a little pepper.

This recipe tastes perfect just the way written.   Although, I have to say I didn't understand the directions for making the parchment packets, so I left them square.  I put the food in the middle, folded down two edges about 3 times, folded up the ends like a gift package and twisted.   It worked out just fine.

Made it the first time with shrimp, and my parents, who do not like spicy food, LOVED it...second time, did it with salmon for my husband and myself, using the same amount of sauce, and that was a hit, too!!

Can't wait to try it with green beans and white fish!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this easy, healthy dinner.  I added more soy sauce (actually I used Braggs liquid aminos)and oil as some suggested-I doubled it, but we still added more after cooking.  I used peanut oil since I didn't have sesame oil and didn't bother grating the ginger, I just minced it.  Also I used foil instead of parchment.  I cooked it a little longer (20 min) because the broccolli was still too crunchy for us.  Oh, and I used precooked shrimp.  It didn't seem to matter at all; definately not over cooked. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this as written. It was fast, healthy and good. Next time I make it I would add something crunchy perhaps water chestnuts and also enhance the sauce to include some heat. That would make it a 5 for me. Love the quick clean up.

Light, healthy and delicious, how can you beat that?  I usually bake with parchment paper, but this is the first time I’ve cooked a meal wrapped in it and I was impressed with the results.  Everyone enjoyed it.

I just made this, and we loved it! I doubled the sauce recipe as was suggested in previous reviews, and sauted in a pan vs. the packets. It was so easy, and the sauce would be great with other dishes also. I think I will try with salmon next time.

Very bland.  I doubled the liquid and added water as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce.  I had to add more soy sauce and hoisin after cooking.  Also, it took a bit more than 15 minutes to get all the shrimp cooked.  Glad I used foil instead of parchment paper and no fussy crimping!!

This was delicious! I took everyone's advice and I tripled the spices. I also added zucchini noodles and cherry tomatoes cut in half. I mixed all the vegies in a big bowl with the spices. I used fresh grated garlic and omitted the garlic powder. I added a few pinches of red pepper. threw it all on a baking pan and placed the shrimp on top of it all. baked it for 20 minutes and drizzled fresh lemon juice all over it when it came out. Served it with cauliflower rice. It was delicious!!! Very easy! I will definitely make again.

Love this! Made it for myself for lunch to try it. I used frozen salad shrimp and frozen broccoli (that’s what I had already). Just took a handful of each out of the respective packages and cooked it a little longer (20-22min) to make sure it was done. Also cheated, for time’s sake, by using garlic powder and ginger powder (I’m sure it’s better with fresh, and I will use that in the future). Came out great. My husband is allergic to shrimp, so I’ll try it with chicken when I make it for dinner. Also thinking of including some riced cauliflower next time .......

Love this recipe! Use it almost weekly but change ingredients slightly for variety. I find cooking it in a large pan on the stove to be quite fast. I always have frozen shrimp and frozen broccoli on hand. Fresh asparagus tastes great added to it. Served over jasmine rice. The more fresh ginger the better in our house! Thank you!

Did not have as much broccoli on hand and added sugar snaps and shredded carrots to fill in the bulk.  Would make it again with a full tablespoon of soy sauce.

This was yummy. Had to use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies but worked well. I added besides that peppers to the mix. I tripled the sauce due to the extra veggies. The reason for 4 stars is when I made the sauce, the sesame oil overpowered everything. It was all you could taste. Ended up spooning out well over half of it, adding more ginger, soy sauce, and garlic to it. If it’s a repeat I may eliminate it altogether. Great base recipe.

This was almost perfect as written. Based on other reviewers I did double the sauce. The worse that could happen is I would have too much sauce and that's never a bad thing! I will make this again, sooner than later.

This was wonderful! I made it exactly as written. I served it with orzo made with fresh lemon and sliced black olives which I made on the stove top while the shrimp packets were baking. This is company-worthy and a real keeper.

It wasn’t what I expected.  Sort of bland.  Steaming made broccoli crisp and shrimp was cooked perfectly.   Do not let meal sit in parchment paper make sure you lets the steam out.

I made it but doubled up on the sauce and added more garlic. Also just baked Inna baking dish covered with foil. Tasted good. Will repeat and maybe try some oyster sauce in it as well.

This recipe earned great reviews from the group! I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was the broccoli...I used frozen instead of fresh.  The frozen broccoli created more juices but it was still tasty.

Made this for dinner on weekly movie night with my sisters. I also doubled the sauce. It was a big hit! They asked for the recipe and will definitely be making again

It came out really good. I didn’t add Sesame Oil because sometimes it can be overwhelming. Thankfully I didn’t add it because it tastes great without it. Great recipe!

I used low sodium soy sauce and doubled the sauce. I also made it in a casserole dish. HUGE hit!

SUPER good. Totally a hit with the fam. I did make about twice the sauce as they noted, and ended up with 6 packets. Served with garlic bread.

Very tasty! Will definitely make again. After reading the reviews, I also increased the sauce, otherwise there was nothing else to change. I used the parchment packets and they were fine. I use a couple of staples to keep them closed.

I doubled the sauce and added water chestnuts as suggested by others. This is delicious, and the parchment paper worked well for me.

We loved it and plan it again.  Parchment paper was a new experience but it's great; buying a new roll to use with other dishes.  Also plan to adapt this recipe to include other meats and veggies.  The Asian sauce was great too.

Very mild flavor.  I added some chili garlic sauce and very much enjoyed it with that addition.
I used frozen stir fry veggies and frozen shrimp.  I love how easy this recipe is, healthy, and quick.  Thank you for the solid base, but the seasonings did need some help.

The technique used with the parchment paper was quite interesting, but I don't  really comprehend the purpose of the heart shape, but once the recipe was fully made, it was scrumptious!

A quick and healthy dish using simple ingredients on hand.  I did add more sauce and used a baking dish with a lid instead of parchment paper.  It turned out great - my family of 4 loved it, especially the picky 11 year old.  This recipe will be a part of our Seafood Saturday!

The dish was very good & i will make it again, skipping the parchment paper. I did add a couple of tablespoons of honey ginger.
