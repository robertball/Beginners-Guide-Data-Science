I just made these and they turned out delicious!  I added salt (1 & 1/2 tsp.) and used a little less chips, and my family loves them!  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are awesome!!  I used 2 cups regular chocolate chips and 2 cups white chocolate chips.  My 5 year old son says they are the best cookies he has ever had!

I made these as a half batch and ram out of all-purpose flour so I used half white and half whole wheat and it was still very good.  I like that they aren't flat like some recipes.  Definitely a keeper.

These turned out perfect!!! I was out of butter, so I used the "ingredients" tool and put in margarine and shortening. This one came up and turns out they are better than the ones I usually make with real butter! DELISH! Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a new chocolate chip recipe and came across this one. Figured it would be a good one since it was rated so high. I was sadly mistaken. These cookies turned out more like cookie pancakes. I added about a cup more of flour and that seemed to fix the issue. I think from now on i will be using my recipe.

I couldn't believe how awesome these cookies were.  Perfect texture, taste, and very easy to prepare.  I have made them twice and everyone who has ate them, has ask for the recipe.  Thanks Queen77 for sharing this recipe!

I was looking for a knock out chocolate chip cookie recipe and since this has 5 stars I tried it. It was too greasy for me and think the recipe on a chocolate chips pieces package are so much better

I was really disappointed with this.  I wish I would have read the reviews as my cookies were really flat.  I was looking for a new cookie rececipe that didn't turn out flat.
