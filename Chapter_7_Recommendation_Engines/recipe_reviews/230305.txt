I used Almond Breeze Coconut Almond Milk to significantly lower the fat and calories of this recipe and served it as simple side dish to sauteed shrimp.  Quite tasty!

I followed the recipe and it's good... I added some honey and cream (as if it weren't rich enough!) and ate it like oatmeal... Not exactly what I thought I'd be eating for DINNER... LOL... I added some Braggs Soy Protein to the leftovers and it was YUMMY!... I'm new to quinoa, so this was an experiment... I'm having fun!

Made this recipe as written but ended up modifying it because it was just too plain for my taste (I expected it to be a bit on the sweeter side). I added a bit of cinnamon, some raisins, and a touch of brown sugar and liked it much better that way. Overall, good idea/twist to the typical way of cooking quinoa (^v^)

I added crushed pineapple for more flavor.  I typically make coconut rice, but happened to be dealing with quinoa today! I am serving with Hawaiian pork.

I increased the coconut flakes to a cup, and added a can of pineapple tidbits. Very light and summery! I loved it.

Blah. I followed directions exactly, and this turned out to be goopy and inedible. I love quinoa and coconut (separately, I learned), so that's not the problem. I think the liquid of the coconut milk is just too thick, and despite cooking at the directed temp, it had a slightly burnt taste. I will not make this again.

It was thick and goopy. I used canned coconut milk which is thick.

I made it slightly sweet with coconut milk from the carton, sweetened coconut flakes and a few drops of vanilla extract. It was OK. I think I'll keep working on it.
