I made these - pomme dauphine - to accompany an old-school French "surf-n-turf" for Valentine's  dinner for my wife and I - petit filet à la sauce bordelaise, coquille saint jacques, haricots verts à l'amandin, tomates poêlées, mousse au chocolat avec framboises et crème. : )The potato puffs were a great addition. I made a half-batch and added chives. The only thing I did differently was to preheat the muffin tin and add a dollop of butter  so when I dropped in the batter (pre-portioned and set aside on parchment paper) they fried nicely on the bottom, like Yorkshire Puddings. In the time it took them to bake and cool I was able to cook the steaks and make the red wine sauce, finish off the green beans, sear the tomatoes, and broil the scallops so everything was done together. These puffs are very tasty (pictured in a cluster of 3, upside down to the left), can be prepped ahead, and present well on the plate.

I made these to accompany the Oven Seared Beef Tenderloin with Herb pan sauce (also on this site) for Christmas dinner.  I made a test batch ahead of time and added fresh grated sharp white cheddar to some.  The cheese ones were great (a little salty), and my husband's favorite, but I felt their flavor was too much for the meal I had planned so I ended up making them per the recipe on Christmas day.  I did doubled the recipe, but only used 3 eggs, and they turned out perfect.  Great for mopping up that  yummy pan sauce! Make sure you taste your dough before you put it in the muffin pan, and add salt if needed...there is no way to salt them afterwards.  I will definitely be making these again.

We forgot the nutmeg, but they still turned out wonderfully. We'll try adding the nutmeg back in for the next time.

These turned out absolutely beautiful! My husband loved them. It wasn't easy having to wrangle him away from the dish until everything was done. In fact, I made Scotch eggs by Chef John's recipe. I'd highly recommend a Fry Daddy or something of that nature b/c it was impossible to get the oil in a pot on my stove to cook w/o burning them, but then again, I need a better stove. If I had the money, I'd already have been to Sears & bought one of their high-end stoves now that they're on such deep discount w/Sears closing stores. But I digress. The entire meal turned out wonderful w/exception of having to switch to the deep fryer. If I'd had more potatoes, I'd have drop fried a couple of them. Hwr, I'll have a large bag of potatoes come tomorrow this time. Hubby's hooked!

Saw Chef John's video on YouTube and, being a lover of mashed potatoes,  just had to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did.  I made 1/2 of the recipe, added in a bit of parsley but didn't add enough salt.   They were quite easy to make and I will definitely be making them again.   No problem with them sticking.

Easy to put together (if you're used to scratch cooking). I recommend baking a bit longer in the oven to get a crispier outside.  I used a silicone cup cake pan which made then just pop right out. they are soft and taste like mashed potatoes on the inside. My husband used gravy on them I used just a pat of butter. The recipe called for quite a bit more than a pair of us consume in a meal. The left overs we just popped into the deep  fryer and fried them back up to go with breakfast. those were good too.

Oh my GOODNESS.  Out of this world. Definitely a fun take on a potato.  

As someone else has suggested, I pre-heated the muffin tin and added melted butter right before adding the batter.  I also added some guyere and parmesan cheese to the mashed potato batter. I was a little worried when working with the "dough" in the pot, but it turned out wonderful. 

I highly recommend.

I'd never had them before, they came out perfectly but if I'm honest I won't make them again. Family wasn't thrilled. But they are picky eaters. They did bake up beautifully though!

They stuck to the well greased muffin tins.  Ended up in peices.  I added a bit of cheese and bacon.  My husband loved them and wants me to make again.  Next time I’ll try silicon baking sheet.

R.12.20.2018

Thank you, Chef John, for showing this "pommes dauphine" recipe.  I made it.   It was a winner.  The family loved its simplicity and deliciousness.  Thank you also for sharing its origin, ethnicity and variety.

Made an addition of cooked carrots with the potatoes.  They were cooked, seasoned in the food processor for a smoother texture.  Doubled the recipe.  Scooped  them in the buttered muffin pan of 21 puff potatoes but pinched the top to create a spikey look baked at 425 F for 35 mins with rotations.

Yum!!
