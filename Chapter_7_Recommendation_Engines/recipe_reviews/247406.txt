I made some changes to this recipe. Instead of doing it with the saucepan, then the oven; I just did it all in the oven. Less mess. I mixed the first ingredients listed & put them in a glass loaf pan. Then put in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes. Then added the remaining ingredients & finished it off in the oven for another 15 minutes. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the grill with seasonings of my choice. Instead of heavy cream, I used sour cream. I used Rotel instead of salsa, since I'm not too fond of salsa in something like this. I think this is good, but would prefer more texture in it, like onions or bell peppers. Will I make it again; probably not. I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe, I think, to my taste, for the better, but would not rate the recipe down since I had changed it. Still would not have changed the texture though, which to me was mushy. It does taste better after it cools down.

This was pretty good.  I would like to make it again with shredded seasoned chicken and more salsa maybe instead of the cream.
