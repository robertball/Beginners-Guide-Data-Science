Yummy!  I made the following changes:
1.5 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all purpose, 1/2 cup oat bran.  3 eggs, instead of 6 egg whites (I just didn't know what I would do with the yolks and didn't want to throw them out).  1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also omitted the nuts (made for toddler) and upped the shredded zucchini/carrots to a total of three cups.  I too made mini-muffins instead of loaf---13-15 minutes at 350 degrees and voila!!

The cooking time is NOT a mistake. I don't know if you're aware of this, reviewers who said that it was a mistake, but ovens are quite often calibrated differently depending on their age and brand. Also, altitude makes quite a difference in how baked goods turn out. When I cook my bread, it comes out perfectly at the time stated. However, I specifically included "or until toothpick comes out clean" to ensure that everyone else who made this bread would take it out at the right time. Perhaps before you review, you should a) read the recipe more closely and b) pay more attention to the things you're baking.

This is an A+!!!  I made as mini-muffins and omitted the pecans. (because I was making them for children including a baby)
Delicious!! They are beautiful and wonderful--chock full of goodies!  This is hands-down better than the zucchini muffin/bread recipes I've tried!!

This is a very tasty, healthy breakfast bread. The only change I made was to use three eggs instead of 6 egg whites, thus eliminating the need to beat the whites, fold, etc.  I made 4 mini-loaves, all of which turned out tall, moist, nutty and full of flavor.  Will make this again, for sure.

These were just what I was looking for to make for my boys to eat for breakfast.  I used 1.25 cups AP flour and 1.25 cups white whole wheat flour, 3 eggs and I put in about 1/3 cup grapeseed oil.  I also cut back the nutmeg and cloves a bit as they were for my boys (also left out nuts and raisins for my picky eaters) - if I was making them just for me, I'd have done all the spices and tried it without the oil.  They came together beautifully (I made muffins - took 22 min to bake) and each boy has already eaten three (I just took them out of the oven).  They are very moist and flavorful.  Thanks Nicole for the wonderful recipe!!

Spice content is wonderful, however, 1 hr and 20 minute cooktime is WAY too long. Bread was overdone at 1 hour.

I was wary of making a recipe that did not call for ANY added fats, especially after the last zucchini bread I made called for an entire cup of oil.  But I just finished my first slice of this bread and it was fantastic!

I was using whole wheat pastry flour, so I increased that division by a half cup.  So 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup all purpose.  I also used 3 whole eggs instead of bothering with the eggwhite business and omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any), raisins and nuts.

I know that's a lot of changes, but seriously, it made good bread lol.

No applesauce in the house as I've not been able to make my own lately, so I used one melted stick of butter. I didn't want to waste some oranges that were going south in my fridge, so I zested the heck out of them and added the zest to the muffin batter. I made no other substitutions. My son helped me put this together and we had a blast. I didn't make them into muffins, just poured them into two greased loaf pans. Smells out of this world. Can't wait to cut into it!

Fantastic.  Added flax meal (1/4 cup) to this as well and omitted the cloves (didn't have any) and nuts (for toddler) and came out great.  Very moist.  Baked in a bundt pan for an hour, which gave it an attractive presentation inside a pie plate.  Also, no harm in added a bit more applesauce...

This bread is delicious! I was really feeling nostalgic for NY falls and decided to make this, and it really hit the spot. I added craisins, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds. I cut the baking time by 20min, and it came out perfect, very moist and rich in the middle. Will definitely make again!

I substituted 1 cup rice flour and 1.5 cups chick pea flour to make this wheat free and it came out FANTASTIC! The first muffin recipe I've made with substitute flours that was as good as the original!  I also added an extra cup of grated veggies to counter for the dryness of the rice flour. Thank you!!

I also added about 3 1/2 cups of zucchinni, carrots and 1 tbspn of ground flax seeds!! This is healthy and delicious- great recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe makes very hearty muffins! They are so thick, yet moist when you bite into them. The only changes I made to the recipe were omitting the raisins and pecans as I don't care for either of those ingredients. I did add mini chocolate chips to about 1/4 of the recipe but I thought the plain muffins were the best. Recipe yields about 20 muffins.

Mission accomplished: Make a healthy bread that doesn't taste low fat. You'd never know that this recipe is made without a bit of oil or butter. Perfect! Next time I'll cut back on the nutmeg and maybe the cloves as they seemed a bit too prominent for my tastes. I left out the nuts but regretted it. The bread was screaming for them!

Fantastic!  Love this recipe.  I added a streusel topping for fun, but of course that does add a bit of fat to this fabulously low-fat bread. Thanks Nicole!

I used three whole eggs and increased the amount of carrots and zucchini.  Really good! Dense and hearty, and a great breakfast bread.

Clearly a healthy flavorful recipe with no oil and lots of fiber. However, I really missed the oil. I'll have to make it again with it in.  As for baking time, I wonder if the people who said the time was too short were using muffin tins. (Picture shows muffins.)

My mom's garden yielded a mammoth zucchini so I decided to give this a try and I love it!  I had to use whole eggs b/c I didn't have enough to only use whites and no applesauce on hand so I used light margarine.  Will definetly have to make again with the whites and applesauce though, just to see.  Thanks!!! :)

Very tasty. Love that I can hide veggies for my toddler in this. I omitted the spices since my toddler reacts to cinnamon and I felt the other spices wouldn't work without the cinnamon. Still turned out great. Made as 12 muffins, baked for about 20 min. They were a bit dry, which is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. Will try with a bit or oil or a mashed banana next time.

Love this. Keep going back to this recipe, I love that it can be easily tweaked for whatever you currently have...left over steamed cauliflower-in the bread, leftover roasted beets- grated and in the bread. Don't have applesauce, but have olive oil-fine. You just can't go wrong with this bread and the grated zucchini adds such a nice pop of color. Thanks for a great recipe!

I think you have to like spice bread in order to enjoy this.  It wasn't very sweet and the spices were overwhelming.  No one ate it at the thanksgiving table.  However, I think some people really like this sort of flavor, so don't knock it til you try it.

Very good!!  The first day it tastes like your average zucchini loaf, but the second...WOW.  This is a loaf to make a day ahead of when you need it.  The only changes I made was I used 3 full eggs instead of 6 egg whites and no raisins.

After trying a variety of zucchini bread recipes on this site, this is the only one I felt everyone should know about. I doubled the recipe using 6 whole eggs and all whole wheat pastry flour, but otherwise stuck to it. Super moist & perfectly spicy. Everyone I've shared it with wants the recipe (and is surprised to hear how not-bad-for-you it is)!

Just made these and oh-so-delish!!  2 notes: 1, I agree too much nutmeg, but that could be because I use fresh ground and this does tend to be stronger. 2, I added dark chocolate yogurt covered raisins and oh-my-stars!!!  Absolute heaven :)

Great dense and moist bread. A little heavy on the cloves in my opinion. I did a side by side comparison with the carrot Zucchini Bread recipe and this was the winner hands down. Although I might like to add orange zest next time, like is done in the other recipe.

I made these as muffins and substituted the pecans with chocolate chips.  EXCELLENT!  Everyone loved them.

This was wonderful!  My husband even liked it and he is a very picky eater when it comes to breads.  The only change I made was I only put in about half of the brown sugar it called for - we don't like our breads really sweet.  I used 5 mini loaf pans and cooked them for 45min and they came our great! I am going to keep this recipe at the top of my list.

I followed zenmama's suggestions and made muffins and they came out perfect!  What a great way to sneak veggies and whole grains to the whole family.

7 3 17 Dry.  Dry, but I didn't overbake.  I like the healthiness of it.  It doesn't taste too "brown."  I reduced spices.  'Didn't taste like much.

these were so yummy (after i made some modifications).. i scaled this down to 4 servings b/c i just wanted a few muffins for me and bf to snack on.. it made 6.. i never buy wheat flour so i used only all purpose flour.. i halved the spices since i read several reviews saying it was too overpowering.. it came out perfect.. i used an extra large egg for the 1.5 egg whites.. i dont carry applesauce so i just subbed oil.. i probably used a little more grated carrot and zucchini.. but not by much.. didn't have any raisins or pecans so i just left them out.. i was out of brown sugar so i had to use white.. i thought about putting in some chocolate chips but forgot by the time i had put them in the oven.. it took about 20 min's to cook.. i was baking at 350.. ty for the start of a very tasty recipe

I didn't have wheat flour, so I used white. Also exchanged Craisins for the raisins. Worked great and tastes wonderful!  I live in Colorado, so I baked the loaves at 300 for about 1:15.  No other changes needed.  Very moist and a new favorite in our house. Next time I'll make sure to have the wheat flour on hand.

These are pretty good. The only change I made to the ingredients was to use 3 whole eggs instead of six egg whites. I also chose to make 24 muffins instead of a loaf of bread. The spice ratio is off, so I may adjust that next time. Other than that, they were good. Nice texture. I don't recommend using paper muffin liners if you make muffins. The lack of fat causes them to stick something awful.

Delicious!  I made this recipe with a few changes and it turned out great.  2 cups unbleached flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseeds.  I also used 3 whole eggs and plain white flour. I didn't use nutmeg as I didn't have any. I don't usually rate recipes if I've changed them but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the baking time was a little off.  It only needs about 1/2 the time that is listed.

The flavor is great, but, I learned the hard way: if you are making muffins, BE CAREFUL to not overbake. If they cook too long they get dried out and loose a lot of their appeal. When checking for doneness with your toothpick don't wait until the toothpick comes out completely clean. Take the muffins out when there are still a couple of moist crumbs sticking to it. They will continue to bake for a few minutes after you take them out of the oven. I baked large 3.5" muffins (top diameter) and they were over-done at 43 minutes.

I really enjoy having a slice of breakfast bread in the morning, so I'm always looking for good recipes. I stopped using any recipes requiring oil a while back and have never turned back.

Changes I made to this recipe: only used all-purpose flour, only used baking powder (they don't sell baking soda in grocery stores in the Netherlands), omitted salt, used 3 eggs instead of 6 egg whites, used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of cane sugar, and substituted chocolate chunks for the raisins (they don't sell chocolate chips here either).

I usually only use half the sugar called for in recipes, but based on some other reviews I decided to keep the sugar amount called for and I'm glad I did as it turned out at just the right sweetness. I think the amount of spices was perfect, but I really like anything that includes any of the included spices. For my oven, the cooking time was perfect - to be on the safe side, I started checking the bread at around 50 minutes to verify that I was on track.

I'm happy with the outcome. It could have been a bit less crumbly, but that might also be due to any of the changes that I made; I think it's also due to the lack of grease in the bread, which is a good thing. I am glad that it's not too sweet - since it's for breakfast, I'd rather not have anything super sweet early in the morning. Looking forward to enjoying this over the coming weeks!

Cooking time must be a mistake. Someone also said this and I cut it to 1 hour which was still to long. If your not a big fan on cloves cut this back also. Also be prepared to spend some time on this recipe with all the great reviews we were greatly disappointed.
