Excellent salad! I used some leftover beef fajita meat that I had grilled which made this a quick and easy dish. I left out the kidney beans and added some sliced avocado and crumbled bacon for some additional flavor. I also used "Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette" from this site as bottled Italian dressinsg just didn't seem to fit. Overall, very filling and very good!

I hosted a luncheon for a friends birthday and served this to the ladies. WOW! Did I get rave reviews, and some went home clutching the recipe.Since my friend isn't a big Italian anything fan, I added the cumin to Caesar dressing along with a half packet of fajita seasoning. It made great dressing. I gave everyone a choice of dressings. Most chose the Caesar, but the Italian was outstanding, too. Thanks for a fantastic salad, Nicki. This is a keeper.

This is DELICIOUS.  We couldn't get enough of it!  The next day we got soft tortillas and made wrap sandwiches with the leftovers, which was also excellent.  This is now one of my favorite recipes.  You will LOVE it!!  (We added some fajita seasoning while we browned the meat.  Kicked it up a little!)

Yummy!  Everyone of us throughly enjoyed the salad.  This was a nice change from my regular taco salad.  I thought it was easy to make, but make sure you read the "refrigerate for a couple of hours" part.  I missed it and started too late and had to make it the next night.

This was easy and quick.  My teenagers loved it.  It was so big: everyone filled up.  I used pre-marinated fajita meat and that was quicker on my George Foreman grill.  Liz Lee-McClurg

I love this salad!  Everyone raved about how delicious it was and wondered where I got the recipe.  I put the flank steak on the grill and added some fresh cilantro.  Yummy!

This recipe was ok, but not the best.  I might make it again sometime, but it isn't one of my favorites.

Used ground beef.  It was good but you could definately tell it was italian dressing and we don't care for that taste too much.  Won't make again.

Five stars with a few changes: substitute black beans for kidney beans, and omit cheese. My whole family loved this, even the kiddlets who don't usually eat salad..

I used leftover beef tenderloin and put some avocado slices on top, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good that I'm making it again tonight!

This is a new family favourite! We are a family of 6, and it's usually hard to please everyone! This was amazing. We've made it a few times, and will be making again tonight! The only change i make is putting pico de gallo(fresh tomato, capsicum, red onion, coriander, salt & pepper) on top of it all. Fresh and filling. Never any left over!
