I did not care for this drink made as the recipe stated. It was too heavy on the matcha with not enough sweetener, making it bitter.  Also, there was so much ice you could have eaten it with a spoon. It was salvageable, though, by adding more sweetener and more milk.

The ratio of liquids to ice/powders is off. It was so thick and grainy, that our powerful blender was having a hard time. I even used less xanthan gum than called for. I added half n half to thin it and make it creamier. My son liked it, but the matcha taste was way too strong for me. If I make his one again, I will use 1 1/2 cups ice and about half the matcha.

I made this and it was very good, could use more ice cream in my opinion to make it stay together better. I used an organic green tea and blue ribbon ice cream and it made it taste so good

It would taste better with condensed milk, milk, and ice cubes blended together
