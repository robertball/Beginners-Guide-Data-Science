This recipe rocks!  Pam was in town and cooked it at one of her classes and it was great.  I even got my husband, who hates sweet potatoes, to love this recipe.  I will never eat sweet potatoes any other way.  And it's really easy.  I had some shells left over, so I put them in a contained in the fridge, already stuffed, and just put the marshmallows on top before I popped them in the oven the next day at the same oven temp for 8 - 10 minutes. Anyone can make this.  It's a keeper.  Enjoy!

These were SO GOOD!! I made 4 changes: add brown sugar (to taste), add 1 egg white, omit the pepper, and omit the milk (I still used the Buttermilk it called for). The sweetness went all the way through and they held together well. I also chose smaller sized yams so the skins wouldn't fall apart so easily. There were no leftovers from the Christmas dinner table. These will are now a new favorite!

I made a few changes. I removed the flesh and hand mashed. I was out of buttermilk so I substituted a bit of sour cream and used less milk because I didn't want it runny. I added brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I scooped back into the potato while it was still very hot. Add mini french vanilla marshmallows - they were all I had on hand but added fantastic flavor!

I liked the idea of the do ahead on this recipe as I love being able to prepare side dishes the night before and leaving my oven free for the turkey. This allowed me to do it and I love sweet potatoes. I used regular milk and omitted the buttermilk and added one egg and sprinkled chopped walnuts and brown sugar on top. The blender didn't work for me. I ended up mashing the filling.

Flavor was good, but seemed a bit watery. Next time I'll add an egg to help it bind together.

I made these for Thanksgiving for something different and I couldn't have been happier that I chose these.  I am not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but these were absolutely delicious.  I loved the tang from the buttermilk and the sweetness of the marshmallows.  I think these will be our new tradition for the holidays!

I did not care for these. There was definitely something missing!!! Maybe, some sugar brown, white, or honey? Another flavor dimension with a spoonful of orange juice like some other sweet potato caseroles? A spice like cinnamon? The mashed part of the potatoes was no different than making "mashed potatoes," in that it was only milk, butter, and salt. The marshmallows on top gave it a nice presentation, but it was just like eating "mashed potatoes with marshmallows on top." This would definitely have to be reworked. Or, maybe I am not getting it? I guess I was expecting a kind of sweet potato casserole taste baked inside of the sweet potato skins?

These were fantastic.  I only used 2 sweet potatoes (just my husband and I for dinner), left out the black pepper, and used about 1/4 buttermilk and 2 tablespoons butter.  I also added about a tablespoons of brown sugar.  I didn't bother with a blender or food processor and just mixed everything into the scooped-out potato meat with a fork.  I think the buttermilk really makes this dish, it adds a subtle tang that made the potatoes really good.  The potato mixture by itself, before topping with marshmallows, was good enough to eat and I will probably use buttermilk now instead of regular milk when making mashed sweet potatoes.

This is a hit and a request every year at Thanksgiving.  My whole family really enjoys them.  They are kind of time consuming, but are easy to prepare ahead of time.

I just made these tonight for a delayed Thanksgiving meal with my husband. I did add a little brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste divine, the marshmallows oh yeah! The only issue was the mixture didn't move in my blender, so I scraped it all into a bowl and used a mixer. Will definately make this again!

This has been an absolute hit in my family for three meals! I served these for Thanksgiving and my in-laws were blown away!    I actually hand-mixed the filling; a bit more time consuming, but I was able to smooth the surface before topping with marshmallows for a nice finish.   I highly recommend! These also re-heat VERY well!

Turned out great! I was only using one potato, so used the hand masher. I used sour cream and no egg to keep it simple, added brown sugar too. Will do again!

These are really good. They are easily made ahead a day in advance, then top them with marshmallows and roast a few minutes before serving. I think there is a typo in step two.  It should read to leave 1/4 inch of border. Thank you for the recipe. .

This was really good. I, like others added some brown sugar to the puréed sweet potatoes- gave it just enough sweetness. I would keep the potatoes in the oven with the marshmallows until they just start melting, the more golden they get- the crispier they get and a little too hard, I think. Will definitely make again and again.

Not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but these were VERY good! 
Changes I made: added an egg and tablespoon of brown sugar, used buttermilk only, and no black pepper. They did scoop out of the pan a bit messy as I thought they were a little watery. But the 3 cooks at the table all said they were perfect. Will absolutely do again, (although I might leave them in the oven just a couple mins longer, and use only the amount of buttermilk called for while omitting the reg milk.)
