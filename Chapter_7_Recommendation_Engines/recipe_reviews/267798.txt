This turned out well. It's flavored nicely. The only thing I added is some salt and pepper. I used a rather small squash, and it did not get completely done on the very bottom of both halves. I think another minute would have done it. Be very careful taking the squash out of the pot so you don't spill any of the melted filling and so you don't burn yourself. When I cook squash in the IP in the future, I may just cook it plain and add the filling once it's done.

Very quick and itâ€™s quite tasty but even after placing in my oven to reduce the moisture the squashed absorbed from the steam in the pressure cooker it still was rather runny compared to baking in the oven. I like the thickness of oven baking over pressure cooking, but I do have to say this was much much faster.  Since I love acorn squash, I will use this when pinched for time, but baking will still be my favorite way to prepare.

What a fantastic time saver! Even though I doubled the cooking time because I doubled the squash quantity, which overcooked it slightly, the resulting flavor and texture were irresistible! Since the skins peeled off easily, it stirred easily into a creamy side dish. I've never served it that way before, and we really enjoyed it tremendously! Thank you for the great recipe, and it's so healthy, too!

The family loved it. I roasted the seeds with a pinch of salt and a spray of avocado oil at 350 for 15 minutes, they were awesome.

I will not make this again.  I had to trim the sides of the acorn squash to make it fit in the instant pot. They were not cooked in the 5 minutes - had to extend the time and still had trouble getting them done. It was difficult to lift the (almost) done squash out of the instant pot without spilling the filling. 

Perhaps my inexperience with the instant pot led to some of these problems. I just got it. But several other recipes I have tried have worked out well.

I used my XP Pressure cooker! It only takes 3-4 mins to start heating- and only 1 min 1/2 to release its pressure! The lid will not open unless pressure is totally released! This recipe was easiest to try with the acorn squash! Love IT!

This recipe is good, however, like others who commented, I found I had to increase the cook time to fully cook the squash halves. The only difficulty I had in getting the squash out of my Instant Pot was that the squash was soft once cooked through. The flavors are good and I will be keeping this recipe for future use. My adjustments are as follows:

Cook time done at 5 minutes with 7 minute natural release as per the recipe, although after testing the squash I put it back in for another 3 minute cook time and let it natural release for 14 minutes before serving. I also doubled my glaze quantitity for the flavor.

Made it as directed - very good! I think you could use about half the brown sugar and still be good!

I did not make any changes to the recipe and it was delicious. Even my picky-eater husband really enjoyed it. And it was so easy in the instant pot that I will definitely make it again.

I drizzled olive oil and cracked pepper over the halved squash before sealing the pot.
