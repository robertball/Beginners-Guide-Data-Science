I think this recipe is an excellent start. I fiddled with it a bit, because I prefer green spring onions rather than raw yellow & red onions. I don't like cilantro (I did still include a little), and even though I warmed and rolled my limes and used a citrus juicer, they had very little juice; so I used half of a lemon for additional juice and tang. I blanched and peeled my garden Early Girl & Lemon Boy tomatoes, because the skins are quite tough. And lastly, I used 2 teaspoons of salt, because I love it salty! Thank you for posting.

It's summer, and tomatoes just don't get any better than right now.  I didn't have any canned chiles on hand, but I did have a jalapeño, so that's what I used.  Mixed up, tasted, and then added another squeeze of fresh lime juice and a tad more salt.  There are a bunch of good salsa recipes, and you can add this one to the list.  Enjoyed!

Loved this recipe. I used fresh Hungarian banana peppers instead of canned, as I had them from  my garden. I did take the time to take the skins off of the tomatoes.  Added a touch more salt and cumin. I couldn't stop eating it and will definitely make this again when I have fresh, ripe tomatoes.  I bet black beans would be good added to this!

It was delicious, with no modifications to the original recipe. Very easy to make and way better than store-bought salsa!

Very tasty and fresh - used red Italian peppers from the garden instead of the can of green peppers - added an extra tomato as the red onion was a little strong - will definitely make again!

I used a small jalapeño instead of the canned green chiles. This is now my go-to recipe!

Delicious! I substituted diced jalapeños for the Chilies and omitted the cilantro. I also only used yellow onion and it turned out great. Quick and easy - this recipe is a keeper thanks!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. My bountiful crop of tomatoes was perfect as the base for this salsa.  There is truly nothing I would change about it- I had trouble sharing some of the jars-I wanted to keep them all!

I used a fresh jalapeno and serrano pepper from my garden instead of the canned chiles. It came out perfect, thank you.

Made to batches today.  If you like a bit chunker salsa, quarter the tomatoes rather than dice them.  I also grilled the onions, peppers, and garlic to add a bit of smoke flavor to it.

Substituted green onion for yellow onion, and jarred jalepeno peppers as that's what I had on hand. Delicious and making again the same way for a father's day cookout!

Came out great! I thought I had some store bought salsa and didn't, so I quickly whipped this together, I didn't have lime juice so substituted a teaspoon on lemon juice and no one knew the difference!
