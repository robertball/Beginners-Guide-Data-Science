EDITED TO UPDATE:  I've made this recipe again and have addressed the problems in my original review by putting a heaping 1/4 cup of batter into each ring, not 1/2 cup. This approach makes 8 pancakes - that are still very tall and fluffy!  Also, using 1/4 cup batter per ring makes it *much* easier to flip and you're assured that the middle will cook all the way through. I cooked them for 4 minutes per side on my stove's lowest flame setting.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Very delicious but tough to execute. I couldn't get the hang of the flip!! Whenever I flipped, some batter would spill out of the mold...even though I waited the full 5 minutes and looked for bubbles before flipping. I followed the recipe exactly and had enough batter for exactly 5 pancakes (I used 3.5" ring molds). I made only two at a time because you need some room in the pan to do the flip. The flavor and texture were classically Japanese -- a cross between pancakes and sponge cake...and only mildly sweet which I appreciated. It helps to spray some Pam on the bottom of your pan, even if it's non-stick.

It was a pancake, a very thick pancake. It looked nice on plate but since it was so 'cakey' it seemed to really soak up the maple syrup (I only use the real stuff). I didn't have 3 forms the same size so I just piled them up  in a tower.
