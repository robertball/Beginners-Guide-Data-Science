Very good.  Took it to a family picnic, everyone enjoyed it.  I could not find the Kraft Salad Dressing or the cheese the recipe mentioned.  I found a Greek with Feta Dressing in another brand.  I added more Feta and ground Oregano to it.  The same for the topping.  I added chopped Sun dried tomatoes, oregano and cracked pepper to some feta.

Good recipe. I added some Greek olives for a little more taste option.

We really liked this salad.  I had to improvise because I did not have the Kraft products on hand.  For the feta, I used 1/3 c. feta crumbles, 1T sun dried tomatoes in oil, 1/8 t oregano and a few turns of the peppercorn grinder.  The oil helped the spices stick to the feta.  Next time I would add  a little more sun dried tomato because I could not taste it. I combined these in a separate bowl and then added to the salad.  For the dressing, I used Ina's which called for 2 cloves garlic, 1 t oregano, 1/2 t dijon, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar, 1 t salt and 1/2 t pepper whisked together, then drizzle in 1/2 c. olive oil while whisking more.  Since I didn't have fresh parsley either, I added 3T dried parsley to the dressing to reconstitute. The reason for the four stars instead of five is because of the way the recipe is written.  Step 1 should be blanch green beans; people don't have blanched green beans laying around. Also, I have never seen the Kraft Feta with Oregano, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Cracked Peppercorns Cheese at my grocery, only plain feta. It would be nice if the footnote provided some substitutes. I will make again and will try to get the above mentioned products, including fresh parsley next time.  I will also probably add some olives for some more Mediterranean flavor. This is a delightful refreshing salad.
