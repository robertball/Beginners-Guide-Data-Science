I loved this recipe!  I like my bacon pretty crispy though, so I microwaved it slightly before baking it with the scallops.

Some people don't mind less than crispy bacon but I prefer it fully cooked so I took other reviewers suggestions and cooked it for a bit in the microwave before wrapping the scallops. The scallops were moist, tender and full of flavor. Hubby loved them! Thanks Joelle!

These scallops are incredible! I was very weary of this recipe at first, but I had heard that bacon wrapped scallops were great. So I followed the recipe exactly and was AMAZED with the results. To the reviewers that said the bacon wasn't crisp: I used bacon with very little fat and the bacon was very crisp and delicious. Maybe try only using the meaty parts of the strip because mine was DIVINE!

I really liked this recipe. I was actually looking for a recipe similar to one I had dining out, with sea bass and bacon, so I used this one...turned out fantastic! I paired it with a tarragon cream sauce I found on this site...and the results were very very good! The only thing I can suggest is after baking the scallops, broil them 2inches from a couple of minutes depending on how crispy you like your bacon. Enjoy!

Not good.  If you really want to try this recipe, cook the bacon half-way first in a pan or microwave before putting it in the oven with the scallops.

Rich & delicious; the bacon, however, turns out soggy even if you cook it a bit first.  I suggest cooking it nearly completely before putting it in the oven with the scallops.

Even precooking the bacon didn't help this as that wasn't really this recipe's worst issue in the first place. Usually simple, basic ingredients can produce something very tasty - but not this time.  And usually bacon can make anything taste good or better.  Not this time. This needed seasoning.  Anything would have been better than this just as is.  Further, there's something "off" about lemon juice with bacon.  This went nowhere on our SuperBowl Smorgasbord Buffet.

Hubby went to Seattle and came home with TONS of fresh fish (very hard to get here in the Midwest).  Had lots of scallops and this is one of the recipes that we tried...YUMMY.  Thanks for the post.

this was a very good recipe.  I would maybe cook it a little less than 15 min next time, I'm picky about seafood being overdone.  Very easy and good, though.

This is an absolute fabulous recipe!  My husband and I ate all of the scallops and probably could have eaten more had I put more in the oven.  Definite keeper!  Thank you!  P.S. Very simple to make also!

Scallops are absolutely divine and a perfectly cooked scallop requires no seasoning. Bacon wrapped scallops--Not as easy as it sounds.  No two sea scallops are alike and they come in all different sizes.  If overcooked they are rubbery and undercooked, well……   Then there is the bacon.   It takes the longest to cook.  To get the two to come together at precisely the right time is a bit of a challenge.  Therefore, you can’t always rely on recipe cook times.  I find it best to partially cook the strip of bacon in a skillet until 50% cooked.  Don’t cut the strips, because they shrink and you want to make sure it’s long enough to go around the scallop.   After you wrap the scallops, bake in the oven with a watchful eye and remove each scallop as it gets done.

Good Recipe.  Microwave the bacon in paper towels for a minute then wrap around the scallops.  Drizzle scallops with lemon juice, spray with Pam and sprinkle cajun seasoning on top after wrapping with bacon, then bake.  DELICIOUS!  I never liked scallops until this prep.

Excellent!!  I did cook the bacon 1/2 way in the microwave first then wrapped it around the scallops.  I also baked them at 425 degrees on the top rack.  They need higher heat and more time to cook than the original recipe calls for.  They were fantastic.  I wish I made more. My guests ate them all so fast!!!

This is an amazing recipe. The only thing I changed is I cut the bacon so it doesn't wrapped right around the scallops just on top where I the toothpick in. This way the bacon is still infused with the scallop but cooks faster. Used maple bacon for an extra sweet flavor.

This is simple, but great tasting recipe-the way all recipes should be. However, there's no way the bacon will become crisp if it is not precooked a little as suggested by several others. Also, you might want to add a little more lemon juice after cooking-depending on your taste.
I will be making this again.

Freaking amazing. So simple and so good. My husband (who doesn't like seafood) and my 7 year old daughter (who tried these at Christmas and didn't like them) both inhaled these at dinner. I took the tip and pre-cooked the bacon a bit in the frying pan as I like bacon crispier and these turned out lovely. Thanks!

This recipe was terrific. I'm inexperience with scallops, but I thought that this was terrific!
The lemon gives the perfect twist at the end!
I did have to cook a little longer than directed to crisp the bacon though.

I used 9 collosal scallops in this recipe, and wrapped them in the microwaveable bacon, as it is already partially cooked. I drizzled lemon juice on them about 1/2 before baking. They were a huge hit with my husband and inlaws. I cooked them at 350 for about 20 minutes, then raised the oven temperature to about 400 for another 5 minutes. They came out tender and juicy, and everyone loved them. Thank you for a simple and delicious recipie.

Wrapping the scallops in bacon is a good concept, but the length of time and temp of oven did not meet our expectations!  Bacon was NOT crispy at all.  We left them in the oven MUCH longer than the recipe called for, but no luck.  Fortunately, the scallops remained moist.

Well, they were enjoyable enough, but only because I LOVE scallops so much. The bacon and scallops do not cook at the same rate, so I ended up peeling off most of the bacon and leaving it on my plate because who wants to eat bacon fat that isn't crispy?

We used large, fresh bay scallops and skewered them for grilling.  We used precooked bacon as scallops cook quickly and bacon (as we like it) needs to cook thoroughly till crispy.  Also, the bacon grease can cause grill flare ups and we didn't want that to char the scallops. We skipped the lemon juice thinking that it may be odd with the bacon.  This was delicious and we look forward to making again.

Even though I partially precooked bacon, it still stayed soggy. Unimpressed.

Pretty good, basic recipe. Could have used a bit more seasoning or flavoring. Took at least 20 minutes to cook.

This recipe turned out pretty well.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was good enough that I think I would make it again.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave first until it was about half-cooked.  I also added a sprinkle of garlic salt and a dash of coarse black pepper to the top of each scallop.

This is an amazing, easy to prepare dish.  I added a bit of garlic to the scallops and I've almost never been happier.  The lemon juice adds such a subtle kick to the recipe.

I make something very similar and to get the bacon crispy, I broil the scallops & bacon instead of using the oven.  Just watch them closely and flip them often.

This was ok. I will precook the bacon next time  because it took much longer than 20 min. to cook. I will also add a drop of lemon juice to each after cooking.

Very simple and the Scallops turned out perfect.  Went great with the risotto I made and will definitely make this again.  I'd love to try it on the grill this summer.

i thought it was just okay. i pre-cooked the bacon a little so that it would crisp up in the oven, but it still wasn't that great. i felt the bacon gave it a bit too much of a salty taste. 

i will stick with my method of butter, parmesan cheese, and plenty of garlic when broiling scallops from now on.

I was reading other reviews and lots of them pre-cooked the bacon first.  I think I will try that next time and maybe use leaner bacon, the stuff I used was too fatty, but overall they were very good!  I will be making them again and maybe with some garlic salt!

I did microwave the bacon prior to using it for wrapping the scallops.  I also used some spices on some of the scallops but not much (lemon peopper, seafood seasoning, seasoned salt, salt and pepper).  All were good.

It tasted good, but if you are expecting crispy bacon you'll be disappointed.  I ended up pulling out my blow torch to give it a little color.

I enjoyed this super simple recipe! I've tried this without cooking the bacon first and for me it tends to be a little to soft for my liking. I followed other reviews and cooked the bacon partially (not fully so I don't burn it when cooking with scallops) and it turned out perfect! These are great appetizers and two per person is a great amount! Great go to recipe to add any sauce on the side you like. I made a blend of lemon, greek yogurt and honey. So good!

Thanks for sharing this recipe it was my inspiration for dinner. First, I added seasoning (lemon pepper, dill, garlic, sea salt) to the scallops before wrapping them in turkey bacon. Second, I added a couple of teaspoons of fake butter with 1 chopped garlic clove to the oven tray and cooked them for 10 minutes. Then, I added the lemon juice, 1 small tomato (dice in small bites, including the juice) and 1/2 very ripe bell better into the tray and put it back in the over for 10 more minutes.  Last, I served everything over pain whole wheat pasta (one tablespoon of lemon flavored extra virgin olive oil to the cooked pasta, so it wouldn't stick). Voila, simple, delicious healthy dinner in 30 minutes!  

*I wanted to use ingredients I had in the refrigerator before they spoiled so, but any left over veggies would work as long as they are ripe so it cooks fast.

I made 6 really big scallops. I fried the bacon a bit first since I like my bacon crispy. However, I did do something a little different. I only made one of the scallops with lemon juice. I made two with nothing other than the bacon and on the other 3 I used different spices on each one. I have to say, I liked the plain bacon wrapped ones the best. You taste the scallop more rather than spices.

I think that the time of cooking is the dilemma. the best possible solution is to cook the bacon in the microwave for 20 sec. per strip let cool then wrap. That possible solution will be in my next attempt at this dish. It's a great and fast side to a broiled or baked fish dinner. Thank you.
