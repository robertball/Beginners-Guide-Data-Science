First time making these from scratch.I was buying Salamida State Fair Spiedie sauce.It was good,but Homemade is the best by far.These tasted like Lupo's, Spiedies in Endicott,NY.I'm not from that area,but I stopped and tried the Chicken Spiedie,& I was hooked. Everyone raved how great they were at my house.I also have a small food concession business,& guess what I'm serving next year.*Chicken Spiedies* Thanks Endicott.

First, I'd like to say that I live in the area that this recipe comes from & they are a staple food at most restaurants & family bbq's. Usually, I just buy a jar of Lupo's or Salamida Spiedi sauce, but wanted to serve it at a party for 30 & was trying to keep costs down, so decided to make my own. The recipe handed down by my family is very close to this one, so I melded the 2 recipes together & got nonstop compliments from my guests, who are all natives & KNOW their spiedies.  My tips: Any type of meat will do, but works its magic best with tough and fatty cuts - the tougher the cut, the longer you should marinade (2-14 days optimal, shaking it once/day- don't worry, it will keep!). Use as many fresh ingredients as possible, but it will still work if you cannot.  The ratio of vinegar should be equal to the fresh-squeezed lemon juice- 1/4 c each. White wine vinegar is good, but red or plain old white will do. 1/3 c. Olive (or any veg) oil. I use 4 cloves and 1 t. garlic powder, add 1 T. dry parsley, 1 T. dry basil and 1 t. of dry oregano. Add the salt to the marinade instead of waiting until its on the grill, which, if possible, should be a wood fire, as it adds so much depth to the flavor. I hate skewering & have a grilling pan with drip holes in it that works better. The hoagie rolls are nice, but most families use a nice, soft loaf of crusty Italian bread & skip toasting it. A delicious addition is cooked mushrooms, peppers, onions with melted cheese.

My boyfriend and I took the chicken bits in a zip lock on our camping trip.  We toasted the buns on the grill after brushing them with the reduced marinade.  I swear I almost saw a single tear fall from his eye As he described the flavor.  This is the best grilled chicken recipe either of us has ever tasted!  I'm drooling just remembering it... Mmm.

Has potential but TOOOOO much vinegar taste. 

Next time I will cut the vinegar in half and put tomato and cheese slices on the sandwiches.

Thanks for sharing a wonderful regional sandwich! I'm from Endicott NY and my family has made these wonderful sandwiches for WELL over 50 years. I have never used  sugar in the recipe, and I use red wine vinegar (like the Chianti vinegar another reviewer mentioned). Pork, Chicken, Lamb, Beef- you name it.  Marinated for 2-3 days and they almost become like ceviche. Grilled on a skewer and always served on perfect Roma's (local bakery)or Battalini's (another bakery) sliced fresh italian bread.  Great topped with cheese and marinated mushrooms.

these are a family tradition for us, Mom and Dad would make 25 lbs at a time and have a neighborhood cookout, only made with lamb - which melt in your mouth!, never had chicken until I could not buy leg of lamb where I live - and by the way, it was always said that MY grandpa invented these in the Endicott, NY area and a friend took the recipe and bottled it - not sure where the truth of it all is, but I presume it was brought over on the boat by lots of families. Just try it with the freshest ingredients and herbs and lemons marinated overnite for the best flavor.

I'm from the southern tier area of New York and enjoyed spiedies for many years. I must say that I've tried other DIY spiedie recipes and this had been our favorite. Chicken thighs are definitely the way to go. I used 3/4 c of olive oil instead of 1/2 c. and didn't find it too vinegary.  I enjoy my spiedie on a slice of fresh baked italian bread with a smear of butter. The meat was so flavorful and moist it really didn't need a drizzle of marinade.

This is an interesting and unique flavor that is delicious. I made them for the first time this weekend. I already have another batch marinating in the fridge.

Yum! I really liked this recipe, it had a great tangy flavour a hint of mint, but not too much. Mine was a little dry but I may have overcooked it and even though I know it's traditional I found serving it in a bun with nothing else a little boring so next time I might add some salad in with it.

I've made these a few times now and they've been great each time. Great for serving large groups as you can do all the prep work the day before and simply cook them when ready. Same deal with taking the prepped meat to a cookout or even camping. Forget cooking hot dogs on that fire! Any leftover meat is great on top of a salad, pasta, or rice too. Chef John is the man and you all should be following him!

this was good, I have to admit that I never had a spiedie before even though we were just in New England.  It is lightly marinated and light. Prefer something more heavily flavored.

Amazing. Tons of flavor. The reduced marinade, combined 1:1 with mayo makes a great "specials sauce" for the sandwich. I also used the leftover marinade to make a wonderful sauce for pressure cooked chicken breasts a couple of nights later.

Yummy!  Only two of us, so I made a much smaller version and just seared the thighs in a cast iron skillet.  I left out the sugar and subbed cilantro for the mint, just personal preference.  I would definitely make this again.

I subbed out the white wine vinegar for distilled (availability reasons) and these still came out great. I am definitely making these again.

This was amazing!  I honestly can say that I haven't read the other reviews, so I don't know what they are saying, but I made this true to the recipe (I would suggest watching the video for the technique).  I marinated for about 3 hours (didn't have longer) and used chicken tenders.  My husband cooked on the grill and they were amazing!  Be sure and boil the sauce/marinade and serve with the meat.  It adds such amazing flavor (although the chicken is good without it as well).   We also didn't serve these as sandwiches but as our main course.... Sorry Chef John......

I had been wanting to make these spiedies for a while.  I followed the directions perfectly and was really amazed with the flavor! I wasn’t really sure of what flavor it would come to be- but the best way I would explain it would be a kicked up Italian dressing.  For sure grill your Italian buns- that adds a lot to the recipe.

Great marinade for these kababs as Chef John likes to call them. I have used balsamic vinegar in place of white wine vinegar and I like it better.

i must admit i did not marinate for a full 24 hours (it was closer to 16 hours).. i also didn't use BLSL thighs, sugar, red pepper flakes, or as much olive oil as called for.. given all that these came out pretty good.. i cut the recipe in half and used the marinade on 7 skinless, bone in drumsticks.. i'll take CaeriBaeri's advice about adding the extra salt directly into the marinade rather than on the chicken before grilling next time.. i missed the salting step and felt like it was lacking.. bf cooked these on the grill along with some baked potatoes and two rogue weenies we inherited from my mom.. pulled the meat from the drumsticks and made a combo of sandwiches and tacos.. i agree with "sheryl", i was wanting something a little heavier in flavor but this was still good overall.. i know i enjoyed the other recipe for Spiedies on this website but i marinated that for four whole days.. either way ty for the recipe

This was unlike anything I have ever tasted but I loved it!  Due to time and ingredient constraints, I had to make some adjustments.  I only marinated for about 4 hours and instead of serving on hoagie buns, I served them with grilled fennel (from this site) and pasta tossed with the dressing from the fennel.  This was a delicious summer meal. Thanks, Chef John!

Born in the Triple Cities (Binghamton, Endicott & Johnson City, NY) & have been eating spiedies all my life.  Original Spiedies were made with lamb.  I prefer pork the best & don't like chicken Spiedies.  I have marinated the meat for up to  week or more.  HAVE to be served on a slice of buttered, Italian bread.  Just slide the meat from the skewer onto the bread &fold it & enjoy.  I'm far from NY now & have ordered State Fair Spiedie marinade on line many times..& Lupo's.  I actually have the original Spiedie marinade recipe from "Sharkey's" Restaurant & Bar in Binghamton, NY, which has been there since before I was born in 1948.  No one ever seems to have heard of Spiedies unless they are from the area.  Glad the recipe is out.  I will try this recipe as I LOVE Spiedies and now I am wanting some REALLY BAD!

Super yummy and easy to make, even for a recent college graduate who survives mostly on Kraft mac n' cheese! I don't have an outdoor grill so I pan-seared the chicken on the stove. I had to drain the chicken into the marinade after a bit so that I could get the chicken to brown. I will definitely be making this again!
