Oh WOW were these ever good.. but I must warn you I altered the recipe a lot.  After trying a few really bland recipe's I wanted some FLAVOR.. soooo   Instead of cream of wheat, I used Italian bread crumbs.  I also added 1/2 tsp allspice, 1 TSP worceschire sauce, 1 tsp garlic powder, and one package Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the meat... (I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork).

I think Marla really hit it on the head with frying the meatballs instead of baking them initially.  This really added a lot of flavor.

I then used Jessica's sauce (1 can evaporated milk, 1 can cream of chicken soup, one can cream of mushroom soup, and my own addition of 1/4 cup white wine.

I have had authentic swedish meatballs in Sweden and these were much better!!!

Thanks Marla

I am giving this a five star only cause I changed the recipe. I made the meatballs just like this recipe. I used the sauce recipe from Swedish Meatballs I. 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can evaporated milk. Do not confuse evaporated milk with condensed milk. They are very different. They turned out excellent.

I thought this meatballs were delicious.  I just cannot follow the rules though, so I did add some worstershire sauce and I used seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also, the gravy looked time consuming and I have no luck with gravies, so I used Jessica's Swedish Meatball sauce containing cream of mush soup, cream of chick soup, and evaporated milk.  I baked the meatballs for 40 minutes and it was absolutely delicious.  Very flavorful and lots of gravy!

I make the same recipe with some changes. I bake the meatballs at 350 till done on a cookie sheet. Put meatballs in baking dish. For the sauce I use the drippings, 1 can evaporated milk, 1 can cr. mushroom soup, and 1/4 cup sour cream mixed together and poured over meatballs. Then bake them for about 2 hrs. on 300 or until sauce is the way you like it. We like the extra sauce to serve over mashed potatoes or noodles. I go really easy on the nutmeg. A little dill weed also is good if you like that flavor. This came from a Swede from the old country. The only difference is she used heavy cream and sour cream, thickened with a little flour to pour over. A very good recipe we serve every Christmas, as well as throughout the year.

This rating review is for the meatballs *only*. After reading reviews from Swedish Meatballs I & II, I made the meatballs from this recipe and the sauce from the other. Served over steamed veggies and egg noodles. My family loved this combination!  I printed out the combined recipe to use during the winter months.

Delicious! Don't skip the nutmeg. You don't want a huge amount, not enough to think "hmm, there's nutmeg in this", just enough to enhance the other flavors. I think I'd like to try sour cream instead of evaporated milk in the sauce some time.

This is a family favorite. These are very easy, and so delicious. My hubby's all time favorite! I substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce, used saltine crackers for bread, and doubled the condensed milk to 4 T in the bread crumb mix and it turned out fabulous! Serves 4. Reheats well as leftovers, if you are lucky to have any. I've made this one over and over again...always wonderful!

This sounds like a great recipe for meatballs. The way we do the sauce in Sweden is a little different from this recipe. We use to serve a cream- or a brown sauce to the meatballs. I give you an example of how we are doing: Add the flour to the liquid you got after you fried the meatballs. Stir and then add ordinary milk..or half milk and half cream. Then add some soya and spice with salt and pepper. Serve the meatballs with boiled potato,sauce  and lingonberry jam.  This is how we use to eat meatballs in Sweden.

I followed Beanhead's idea below.  It was SO yummy and tasty!  My husband was so impressed, he wants to have that specific recipe at least 3 times a month!!  My children ate it up - even the baby of the house had 2 bowls!!  Was VERY yummy!  Thanks Beanhead!

This was good.  My 6 yr old told me I should make this for dinner every night.  Only thing I'll change next time is to double the sauce, wasn't near enough.

This recipe is very close to my favorite from an old Good Housekeeping Cookbook from the 1940's.  The nutmeg is the key, and my favorite recipe uses cream or half and half for the sauce.  Dust the meatballs with flour before searing in butter to brown. Then pour about 2 cups of liquid (could be cream and a cup of chicken bouillon) and use a spatula to stir under the meatballs while the sauce thickens and meatballs simmer and finish cooking. Sprinkle a little nutmeg in the sauce too ... yummy.

Like everyone else, I tweaked the recipe in order to make more of the sauce and make it a bit more flavorful: Add the rest of the can of Evap Milk (instead of just a cup) 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 can cream of chicken soup 1 can cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic 1/2 cup sour cream My husband loved both the meatballs and the "tweaked" sauce.  Thanks for all the great tips everyone!

The meatballs are delicious. However, the recipe for the sauce did not make enough sauce, and did not taste good. It was not a true "gravy" recipe. I had to substitute with another gravy recipe, and throw away the original.

If I could separate the meatballs from the sauce I would give the meatballs a 5 and the sauce a 3.  Even my wife, who hates meatballs, meatloaf or anything similar, loved these.

I recommend a fine dice on the onion and sweat them down a little first.  Otherwise you might still get the bite of some slightly raw onion in your meatballs.  Some people like that.  I don't.  I also went with 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb ground pork.  It makes for a much better texture.

For the sauce I thought that the basic idea was ok, but I used a good bit more flour and a little added butter and made a good roux with the drippings.  I then added heavy cream instead of evaporated milk and stuck with the tomato sauce and nutmeg, but I increased those amounts as well.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.

Server over egg noodles and it was delicious.

Tastes just like the frozen TV dinner my daughter loves so much.  Because I used meatballs already in my freezer it was really fast and easy also.  I was surprised at how much a difference the nutmeg makes too.  Thanks for a tasty dinner Marla.

The meatballs are great, you will not regret making these.  The sauce needs a little work.  I might of done something wrong, but it was too thick (maybe too much flour?) I will definatly make these again, worth trying again.  Would be good with some mushroom.

Okay, so here is what I did :-)  I DID make it exactly as written.  And it was very good.  My onion was a small/med. size.  There was plenty of sauce for the amount of meatballs.  Now if you are wanting to cover a pasta or something also, then you need to plan on making more gravy of some kind.  This gravy is not complicated at all.  Less complicated than those that had to open this this or this.  Anyways, since I am serving with pasta, I could see I would need to do something with the amount of sauce.  While the other SM-1 recipe sounded good, I had just used a white mushroom sauce with pasta over the weekend, and I have CofMushroom coming up on the menu again later this week, so I decided to go a different direction with my pasta, but not with my meatballs.  I pretty much made the Pasta Pomodoro, but to my tastes, which is to use a chicken broth seasoning with cup of white wine rather than water, and a can of Italian tomatoes, and a little more Italian seasoning.  My cheese was an Italian blend.  I thought the two dishes complimented each other very nicely and I was able to save the CofM soup for another day :-)

These were great!  Tasted just like Mom's. Nutmeg is the key. I used nonfat milk instead of evaporated and served on top of mashed potatoes. Have made this a few times now. Love it!

My family loved this recipe, I did change this a little bit base on other reveiws, I increased the sauce by adding one more can of cream of celery soup and sour cream and the 1/4 cup of white wine. I served it with extra wide egg noodles and their was no left overs. I try to make extras for my wife and I so we can take to work, but our three teenage boys wipe out the whole dish. This recipe will be made again and again ! Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved the meatballs!  The sauce sounded like it was going to be bland, so (in the same pan) I sauteed one piece of bacon that I had cut into very small pieces; left it in the pan and added flour, etc to make the sauce.  Added chives and plenty of black pepper and salt to taste....it received great reviews from my family!  

Thanks for the recipe that doesn't depend on canned soup (yuck).  5 stars with revisions!!

I tried this recipe tonight and it was pretty good. I read the reviews first and made a few changes. I basically doubled the ingredients used in the "gravy." I also added a few teaspoons of parsley flakes and added salt/pepper and onion salt. The gravy came out to a really nice consistency and a nice flavor. This is a keeper that I will copy into my personal recipe book :)

These were soooo good!  I took advice from another review and added a packet of onion soup mix to the meatball mixture.  The flavor was amazing!  I even screwed up and used the full 1 cup of evaporated milk into the bread crumb mixture, but they turned out just fine.  For the sauce I took advice from other reviews and added 2tsp of flower, 1 can of cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Really tasty gravy.  The man of the house couldn't stop sneaking in to grab another meatball before the gravy was even finished, he liked them so much.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's why I love this site!!

The meatballs were good. I thought the sauce was just ok and was too bland as far as being very seasoned (the nutmeg was good but other than that it really needed salt, pepper and maybe something else). I will probably make my own version of this but I doubt I will make this exact recipe again.

The meatballs were great. I would suggest that you pat them out with a papertowel after taking them out of the oven. I thought it would give more flavor if I didn't, but I was wrong. Otherwise, this is a great meatball recipe!

This was the first time I had attempted to make swedish meatballs, and they turned out wonderful!! I got rave reviews from my family,(who are all cooks or chefs)....I  really liked the addition of tomatoe sauce to the white sauce, it added a nice hint of color and another complete  depth to the flavor without being obvious.

Please do not confuse EAVPORATED milk with condensed milk which is sweetened and goopy. You may not substitute one for the other. The recipe is very good, but the sauce needs more herbs or spices.

I was a bit worried about the sauce after reading the reviews, but I wanted to make authentic Swedish Meatballs with a sauce from scratch. Well, this was perfect in my opinion.  The only thing I would have changed is I would have liked a bit more sauce.

I gave this two stars only because the meatballs were okay, although they were a little "bready" for my taste.  I made them with garlic and herb flavored bread crumbs; if I had used plain, I don't think they would have had much flavor.  The sauce however, was pretty yucky; bland, overpowering evaporated milk flavor (considering that's really the main ingredient, I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was hoping for better considering all the good reviews).  I ended up throwing it out and making a brown gravy from a packet to serve with the meatballs.  Sorry, but this one won't be going in my recipe file.

WONDERFUL!!  I will be making this often. I did use cilantro rather than parsley and put a little bunch in the meatballs AND the sauce.  I also added a bit of garlic powder to the meatball mixture and used more tomato sauce.  Next time I will also double the sauce, we loved it so much. I served it with creamy mashed potatoes and everyone devoured it all. I may even have to double the meatball recipe and quadruple the sauce. YUM!

This was an easy, but time consuming recipe.  I was hoping it was more a "traditional"  Swedish recipe; I thought that it was a little flavorless.  It just didn't have the flavor that I thought it might have - my fiancee was hoping it tasted a little more like Stouffer's does.   I just wasn't expecting this bland of a recipe.  It was enough to consume.

MMMMM, I will make these again and often.  I did make a few changes to fit what I had on hand, I used dried diced onion (as I didn't have fresh) and added more evaporated milk to compensate.  I also used condensed tomato soup instead of tomato sauce.  I found the amount of sauce just slightly lacking, but it worked.

Delicious!  I made this meatballs as directed, but like others suggested, I used the sauce from Swedish Meatballs I (1 cup evap. milk, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom). I cooked the meatballs, drained them, added them to my crockpot in layers, pouring the sauce over each layer.  Cooked on low for 4 hour.  OMG.  We will never eat any other meatballs.  These would be great with marinara over pasta.

On the whole, the family liked this, but the sauce was a bit bland.  Maybe a bit of sweet chilli sauce might give it a kick.  Will definitely make again though.  Any serving suggestions would be of great help, though.

Grim lack of real flavour - that condensed milk - what a very odd idea and look at the nutrition -- 900 calories, mostly from fat, and recommends sauteed vegetables that add to the problem! Try another recipe

I have to evaluate this recipe in two parts, the meatballs and the sauce.  The meatballs were good, although they didn't hold together as well as I would have liked.  The sauce was only okay, it lacked flavor, and there wasn't enough of it.  And finally, there was way too much margarine/butter in this recipe.  I would not make these again.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added chicken broth to the pan for thickening since there wasn't a great deal of fat left in the pan after browning.  I served the meatballs over egg noodles and it was a hit, very tasty!

I have been wanting to make swedish meatballs for a while and decided on this one based off of the reviews. I only used the meatball part of this recipe and followed it to a T, however i found these meatballs to be a bit on the bland side. I made the sauce by Jessica as suggested by others and that was delicious!i did add about a 1/2 cup of sour cream, 2 minced garlic cloves, and about 1/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg. I might just make this sauce alone with noodles as a meatless dinner or you can definitely grill or saute some chicken breast and serve with this yummy sauce. I will have to tweak the meatball recipe, too bland.

I am only rating the sauce because I had frozen meatballs that I had to use up. It was amazing. I love swedish meatballs, but only ever got to eat the frozen dinner ones. My husband didn't care for it, but he is a self-proclaimed hater of all white sauces.

I only made the meatballs - and placed them in another sauce recipe. However, my meatballs completely fell apart. I even added 2 eggs instead of one. It obviously was down to the milk/bread crumb mixture as I've never had that happen. Very disappointing.

The meatballs were good enough.   But, the sauce was bland, in my case.   I'm going to add some beef bouillon to the leftover sauce to see if that gives it the right kick that it needs.

There is NOTHING bad about these meatballs! I will make these many times over! They are fantastic! I think they key to moist meatballs is to sautee the onions in a little butter. The flavor of these meatballs is fantastic! I actually forgot to add the nutmeg but they are still so yummy! As another reviewer had done, I actually used cream of chicken soup and milk for the sauce. I also used ground turkey instead of the beef. And after I sauteed the meatballs in the skillet, I threw them in the crock pot to cook with the sauce. What a fantastic and quick meal to make for my family.   Thanks!

this was a great recipe and easy to make! i made the meatballs with turkey and they tasted so good with some pretty basic ingredients. there wasn't enough sauce though following the directions so i ended up adding some extra regular milk, and flour. i also added salt and pepper to the sauce definitely a recipe i'd make again!!

Very good meatballs. I made this with turkey meat and they were yummy. If you use turkey though make the meatballs a little smaller than golf ball size. Turkey doesn't shrink like beef so mine were a little on the large size. I also didn't used the sauce recipe provided as I has some packets from IKEA for the meatball sauce (cope out I know but its very tasty)

This wasn't too hard for me to make while the kids were down for Quiet Time. I didn't fry the meatballs, no time for that. I formed them with my small cookie scoop to make uniform balls and baked them. The meatballs were the right firmness, if not a little dry. The whole recipe seemed to be missing a couple flavors that I can't pinpoint. I liked the tomato sauce addition. I'd like to try this meatball recipe with another swedish meatball sauce.

Made these tonight and the meatballs were fantastic but the sauce needed extra.  Next time I will follow another reviewers advice and add more nutmeg, paprika, tarragon and garlic salt to the sauce.
Edited:  Made these again tonight and they were perfect!  I doubled the sauce (used 1 can evap milk and some half and half).  Also added a good couple shakes of nutmeg, couple pinches of dill, a dash of paprika and a dash of garlic powder and salt to taste.  The sauce was super yummy.  I browned the meatballs in a skillet and then put them in a baking dish, poured the sauce over top and put in the oven for 2 hours at 225 degrees to finish cooking all the way through.  Served over penne pasta and w/ steamed broccoli on the side.

These tasted ok. The sauce was a little bland like others had said. I had trouble keeping the meatballs together, they all kind of fell apart. People still loved them though, so I may try again sometime.

Otherwise excellent, but I will add more salt in the meatballs next time. The sauce was perfect with maybe 2 pinches of nutmeg.

building on other suggestions:
Meatball additions:
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp tarragon
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp pepper
1 TBSP worstschire (sp) sauce
mix gently for tender meatballs, with all other ingred

Sauce REALLY needs to be tripled
for tripled batch add to gravy ingred:
1 1/2 tsp tarragon
2 tsp paprika
1 1/2 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp nutmeg 
salt & pepper to taste
 this turned out extremely authentic

These just weren't what I wanted them to be. The meatballs were ok, a little on the bready side, and the sauce was just bland. I added a lot of sour cream and caraway seeds and tried to make it better, which it did, but it still wasn't Swedish Meatballs the way I remember them. I'm probably not going to make this one again - sorry.

I agree with the other reviews.  Meatballs were good!  I used 1lbs beef & 1/2lb ground turkey (what was in my freezer) and they were very moist and yummy.

The gravy, left alot to be desired.  I'll save this meatball recipe, and use a different gravy next time!

Good Meatballs.  I also used the sauce from "Swedish Meatballs I" with two tablespoons of tomato sauce (added to the sauce not the meatballs).

I am only rating the meatballs, as I didn't make the sauce. The meatballs had a good flavor, but mine were a little dry (I did make them a little smaller than directed).  I used the sauce from Swedish Meatballs I, and REALLY didn't like it.  I will probably make my own white sauce with nutmeg next time.  I will make the meatballs again.

The meatballs in this recipe are excellent....the parsley adds a nice flavor. My son loved it. I did find I needed to make adjustments to the sauce to get the consistency more to my liking but the flavor was good.

This was my first attempt at meatballs and I was surprised how yummy they turned out! I did make the meatballs by hand,and to the T by the recipe,YUM! they tasted great right out of the oven! As for the sauce,I didn't have brown sugar,so I substituted with white sugar and believe it or not,pancake syrup! It worked out wonderfully! Next time,I will add a little more seasoning to the meatballs,but for the first time around,it was awesome!!!

Very good recipe. Meatballs were very tasty and needed no adjustment; I made a few changes to the gravy by reading other reviewers' opinion: I put a whole 12 fl oz can of evaporated milk, added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Gravy was enough, and meal pleased my whole family. P.S.: this dish serves way more than 4 people: we were 5 around the table, and I still have leftovers (nevermind, I'll fix myself a sandwich tomorrow)

These were delicious on their own - no changes were made to the recipe and they turned out great.  Very savory meatballs and great sauce.  We served with red-skin potatoes.  Easy to make and tasted better than we expected.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Pretty good, I probably let the sauce sit too long in the pan while waiting for the noodles to cook, which would explain why the sauce became kind of goopy.  Nice recipe.  Hubby still took it for lunch two days in a row.  Thanks.

I enjoyed this very much. The meatballs were flavorful. The sauce was rich and yummy. My only complaint is that there wasn't near enough sauce. It was just enough to coat the meatballs. Next time, I'll make at least twice the amount of sauce to put over the rice or noodles I like to serve with Swedish meatballs. Also, I tasted the sauce after following the directions and it was tasty, but I thought it would be even better with mushrooms so I added some thickly-sliced fresh ones. Even better! I added parsley to the sauce, too. I'll definitely make this again.

I just made these for kids' lunch.  They turned out pretty good and we liked them.  I did make the following changes.  I doubled the sauce (and feel like should have even made more).  We like a lot of sauce.  Also, I used whole wheat dried bread crumbs instead of regular.  I think it added more flavor as whole wheat has more flavor than the white bread.  Overall, we liked them.  They were easy and quick to make, I will make them again.

Very dry recipe.  Not any flavor.  I've never tried swedish meatballs before, so don't have anything to compare to.  Will not try this again.

These meatballs were very tasty - I will definitely make them again.  Made them just as instructed - and made the sauce others had recommended with the Evap milk and cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups.

I forgot to add the onion to the meatballs so I added them to the gravy, as well as mushrooms. I used fresh parsley instead of dry, and added fresh minced garlic. What a great easy dinner!

This was good.  Not exactly what I had expected, but still pretty good.  My sauce can out a little too thick, could probably cut the flour in half.  The meatballs themselves were just ok, I could have saved myself time and just used frozen ones.  I will make again with my own tweeks.  Thanks for the recipe!

The meatballs were a little bland, but that's easy to fix. They have a nice texture and hold together well. I stuck toothpicks with frilly tops in each meatball and served them at my football party last Sunday.

I can see where people are saying they dont like this sauce.  So many people who reviewed have confused EVAPORATED MILK with CONDENSED MILK.  No where near the same thing.  READ THE RECIPE people!!!

My husband begged me to make swedish meatballs.  I've never ate or made swedish meatballs before but the nutmeg seemed to give an odd flavor.  My hubby said that they were "just okay."  I might try them again with the nutmeg and tomato sauce and see if that appeals any better.

This was nice, but not something I would make very often.  I had a hard time making the sauce/ gravy to go with the meatballs.  It ended up tasting more like creamed gravy than a sauce, which was nice over mashed potatoes, but not something I would typically serve over rice or pasta.

Very tasty meatballs.  I browned them in oil and then finished baking in the oven.  We had them over mashed potatoes. Other swedish meatball recipes I have used called for some nutmeg &/or allspice so these were different, but had good flavor.

We LOVED this.  The meatballs were delicious!!  I left out the parsley and I put a lid on the pan to cook the meatballs thoroughly.  We served it over cooked hot egg noodles.  This one is a winner!

I just used the sauce with frozen vegetarian "meatballs" and substituted ketchup for tomato sauce.  Served over wide egg noodles.  Excellent.  Will make again.
