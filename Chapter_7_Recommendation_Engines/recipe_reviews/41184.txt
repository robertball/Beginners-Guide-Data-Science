The missing "something" is 1 C cream instead of 1 C water, 3T butter instead of 1!  I make it all the time, and it's just like MY Mother made 'cause I use her recipe.

Succotash is a favorite of mine.  I make it using the cream and butter combination as suggested.  Just before serving, stir in a pinch (just a pinch)of fresh ground nutmeg.  That's the way my granmother made it.

This is the best succotash recipe I've ever made. I made no changes, and my whole family loved it. Green chilis are one of my favorite ingredients, and I never would have thought to add them to succotash. This will definately be a regular. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was GREAT!!!  So simple!  So tasty!  I am NOT a big lima bean fan, but my husband is, so I tried this recipe for him.  He loved it and so did I.  I will gladly eat my lima beans from now on if they are prepared like this.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe instructed (except frozen corn instead of canned because that's what I had on hand) and it was great. My family liked it, too.
I noticed other reviews mentioned adding some sort of cream...I'm not from the South so I'm not sure what Succotash is "supposed" to taste like.
Recipe as is, including the optional tablespoon of butter at the end, was great!

Being low on groceries and receiving a last minute invitation to a dinner party, these are about the only ingredients I could scrape up. I guess you could say I made the dish by default.  Anyway, it was a hit at the party.  1/2 the people went back for more and the other might have too, but the dish was empty by then. I used half and half instead of water and added more butter as suggested. I'll happily make it again.

Yummy! I added 2 more Tbsp. butter and also added about 1/2 cup of evaporated milk (I would have added cream, but didn't have any on hand) and let that reduce until thick. (I like my succotash creamy.) Hubby and I loved this dish!! I'm already craving it again.

Nice combination of sweet and a little spicy.  It was low maintenance to prepare and cheap as well.  I did add butter and I feel it was necessary and gave it a little bit of richness that it would otherwise have missed. Worth a try!

Really good.  I didn't have the green chilies so I used a can of mexicorn instead and added a little extra butter.  I am sure the green chilies would have been better but it was really good with the mexicorn too,

This was good.  I was sort of standoffish at first, but the longer it cooked with the chilies, the better it was.  I used splenda instead of sugar to cut out the extra calories.  Even my anti-lima bean boyfriend liked it.

What drew me to this recipe was the yellow and green colors. It looks to me how succotash should look.  Easy tip (as my mother made it) omit the water and use a 16 oz can of creamed corn-- then you do not need to add cream either and can perhaps omit  adding sugar too!  Salt and black pepper to taste.  The green chilis are a nice kick.  I have had at  eateries some diced fresh red bell pepper (for color contrast) and diced carmalized onion (for sweetness) added in to the mix as well.

Let me tell it straight - I don't like lima beans. And as a whole, we don't eat many vegetables. When I do make them, we eat them because they're "good for you" and the leftovers go begging. But I was looking for something fast and easy that I already had the ingredients on hand and this fit the bill. Not only did we scarf them up as a side dish, I'm finishing off the last of the leftovers as we speak! Definitely a keeper.

This was very good.  I cooked frozen lima beans in water/sugar/salt for 15 minutes.  The water nearly evaporated toward the end.  So I added some 1/2 and 1/2 cream and 1.5 T butter.  It was sweet. My 6-year-old had seconds!

This was quite good, it was missing something, but I'm not quite sure what.  Other than that mysterious something it tasted like the succotash my mom used to make.

Used fresh lima beans and frozen corn, both microsteamed.  Used less sugar and finished in a skillet with butter and a little cream, salt and pepper.  I have never liked frozen lima beans, but fresh ones are a whole different story.  They are delicious.

It is perfect the way it is.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I followed other suggestions and used 1 cup of cream instead of the water. I also used frozen corn, thawed and the 3TBS butter. Didn't drain and glad I didn't as heating up the next day, it would have been too dry.

We left out the sugar and had to get by with a smaller amount of chiles.  Still loved it!  Would like to try again with cream instead of water.

I added a dash of nutmeg and white pepper in anticipation of a lack of kick. I used diced green chiles, too big, next time I think I will use minced chiles instead.

Taking the suggestions here, I subbed the water with 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup water. Made a big difference. I did add the 1 T. butter, which was plenty (especially when combined with the richness of the cream). I only used 1 T. of sugar, which was fine. I was surprised the chiles didn't taste spicier. I added a dash of nutmeg as one person suggested and liked that. Finally, use fresh corn cut from corn on the cob--the difference between an okay and great succotash. I didn't measure the corn, but used 6 cobs and that was fine--think you could use as many as 8.

We live in the midwest and have never had succotash before.  What a delightful sidedish!  This recipe makes many servings, so I froze some for another date.  Very tasty...who knew lima beans could be good?
