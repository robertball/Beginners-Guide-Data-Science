Delicious! I'm not vegan, so I didn't have any vegan margarine on hand, so I just omitted that. The veggies I used were carrots, zucchini and green onions. Really great flavor! The rice tasted awesome before I even added the veggies, lol. The only change I would make next time would be to reduce the cayenne by half b/c it was a bit too spicy for the girls (the guys loved it that way). Oh, and when I heated the oil in the pan, I cooked the veggies a bit first just to soften them up slightly. Really nice recipe and a definite keeper~YUM! thanks for sharing. :)

As written, the recipe way was too spicy for me.

I skipped the butter and the lemon zest. Yummy and easy to make.
