Now this hits the spot!  I do change the recipe in the sense that I have cocoa powder and make the hot chocolate out of that instead of the instant, taste all the better IMO.  But the addition of the cinnamon and the pinch of chili powder make a good cup of homemade hotchocolate into a FANTASTIC treat. Just those two things change the ordinary into a very special, very YUMMY drink. Thanks so much for this recipe, Mexican Hot Chocolate is the best hot chocolate I've ever had.

This really is good(and simple)!  It reminds me of Farmer Brothers Monterey Hot Chocolate (which I love, and they don't stock it in the grocery store, only at a cafe I've been to).   So it's great that now I can make it at home! :)  Also, I used a 1/2 cup of milk instead of the 1/4 cup, then 1/2 cup of water instead of the 3/4 cup.  I do think that next time though I'll add the water first before adding the milk.  When I added the milk first(like it says to) then added the water, everything was all clumpy.  So I had to stick it back in the microwave for another minute.  It still turned out very good though. And definately a keeper! I can't wait for it to get cold outside again to have it more often!

This twist to boring hot chocolate is incredible. I know it sounds wierd to add chili but try it! You'll love it. Great for cold nights and a bit of cultural diversity!

This tasted really quite rich and chocolately, but I didn't like that the cinnamon and chili powder doesn't dissolve, so it sticks around at the top of the glass and makes it unpleasant to drink. I think I'll try this again, but strain it before I drink it.

After I had a Mexican spice mocha at a local espresso stand, I wanted a recipe, and this is the one I found.  Excellent!  Remember the movie "Chocolat"?  Well, this is why Johnny Depp's characters favorite kind of chocolate was hot chocolate.

This is a great recipe! I used only milk, no water so really creamy.  I made one cup as my family turned up their noses at the ingredients.  Guess what, after a taste I was making three more cups so I could finish my own, thanks!

tasty, easy recipe using on-hand ingredients! I used a full cup of milk for more creaminess and melted a little chocolate in a mug to substitute for the syrup, as I had none on hand. reminded me a little of chai. thanks!

The chili powder was a nice complement to the cinnamon and chocolate.  What a great combination.  I was definitely hesitant at first, but have always enjoyed trying new things.  What a surprise.  Loved it!

This was great!  I loved the chili in the hot cocoa.  Brought out a nice element to the chocolate.  I used 3 tbls of homemade hot cocoa mix and no milk (the homemade hot cocoa had milk as part of it). Turned out great.  The additional milk would probably make it even creamier, so I'll try that too.

Oh My Goodness!!!! This is the best thing ever. I have always loved mexican hot chocolate but I have never made it until now! I did use all milk and it is sooo creamy. Also, there was a group of adults and we put peppermint schnapps in it and YUMMMMY!
I was a huge hit, both with adults and kids!

I am a HUGE fan of Nestle's Abuelita hot chocolate, but it's only sold at certain stores in my area so I was excited when I saw this recipe. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used cocoa instead of the instant hot cocoa. I used dark chocolate cocoa, actually. It came out very bitter (which I expected), so I ended up adding just another squirt of chocolate syrup and some sugar until it tasted right. Then it was AWESOME. Also, as far as the dry ingredients not dissolving.. I mixed up the dry first, added the boiling water to it, added the milk, and then stirred in the chocolate syrup. Everything dissolved perfectly.

I made this with my brother and it tasted like store bought hot chocolate to me. I didn't taste the chili powder, but the cinnamon tasted alright. Next time I'm making this with cocoa powder or chocolate squares.

Mexican chocolate is not characterized by chili powder. The spiciness people detect is due to other condiments, mostly cinnamon.  Second, Mexican chocolate is mostly done with milk, not water.  Your best bet is to go to the "Mexican" store and buy a box of "Chocolate  Abuelita" or "Chocolate Ibarra." You throw the tablet in boiling water and voilá! Real Mexican Chocolate.

Like a previous reviewer, I strained my hot chocolate and used homemade chocolate sauce in place of the instant stuff. The only thing I would change is perhaps adding more chili powder? Mine seemed a bit weak on zip.

This turned out much better than I thought it would. Because I had some time this morning, I mixed everything except the milk and water together in a saucepan, turned on the heat, and then gradually whisked in a cup of milk (no water. I was only using skim milk anyway). This avoided any clumping, and made it nice and frothy. Thanks, Sheldyn!

Delicious!!! My DH does not like hot chocolate, but he wanted to know how I made it so he can try it himself.  Did not add the syrup and it was sweet enough for us.

Good flavor but a little watery for my taste. Next time I will omit the water and just use milk for a creamier treat.

This was a big hit with my Junior troop (girl scouts).  They had a blast guessing  the "secret" ingredient (chili powder).  Only complaint was that after sitting it seems to separate and there is a rather unappetizing sludge at the bottom - I think this is one drink that has to be drunk immediately, not allowed to sit (ours was made ahead of time and kept warm in a crockpot for about 45 minutes).  Even whisking it back together to serve didn't eliminate the eventual sludge.  I would make it again, definitely, but to drink right away.

I used a sugar free hot chocolate mix that I already had, but otherwise followed the directions. This is just okay for me, not a favorite. It certainly is fun to try something different, though.

This was very easy and delicious!  A nice ending at home after we had a restaurant Mexican dinner.
I was out of chocolate syrup, however, so used a TBS. of chocolate chips. I added the boiling water first so the chocolate would melt, then added the milk.

Yummy!!! On a hot day I love these blended from my local coffee shop. To make blended just use ice and milk, no water, to the thickness you like.

LOVE IT.  Super fast, and the ingredients are all things you normally have on hand.  I have a huge crowd coming for Christmas, and we'll be making this every day!  Wonderful rich taste; the cinnamon and chili powder are perfect additions.

Oh this is the best hot chocolate I have ever served everyone loved it. It will be my go to recipe every time. I warmed the milk on the stove while whisking in the dry ingredients then added chocolate syrup and then the boiling water :) no lumps just perfection. Thank-you for sharing this delightful treat.

Maybe I should not fill the whole mug with water and milk, it tastes too thin to me.  I added a little bit ginger powder in it which makes it all even better!

we had our first cold rainy day of the year and I wanted a special cocoa to go with the first fire.  This was perfect.  Make sure you scale the recipe up because everyone is going to love it.  Had to scale to 8 servings to get enough for 5 people.

Yum, good twist on the usual hot chocolate.  And made me think of Johnny Depp from Chocolat…Yum, again! I think I'm due to watch that movie soon. Thanks for the recipe :)

This worked out really well... If your looking to please a Spanish teacher, or for authenticity, I recommend this. If you're looking for a tasty snack, take this advice and use less cinnamon and water, while using more milk. MUCH less cinamon.

i have been trying to find a hot chocolate recipe with chili in it for the longest time! however as i am very particular about my hot chocolate i didn't use the chocolate syrup, just a little bit more of the instant powder. For people who find that your powders get clumpy when the water/milk is added i would suggest that you add a little bit(about 1 tbsp) of milk or water to your powder and mix it up to make a thick syrup and then add the rest of your water, this just makes the mixing much easier and prevents clumping! excellent recipe! yumm yumm!

I never had cinnamon and chili powder in my hot chocolate.  I really enjoyed this.  I wouldn't call it spicy but it has a nice flavor and I think it enhances the chocolate.

I always wondered what the chili powder would do for the hot chocolate, it adds a great kick. It may seem odd at first, but it tastes more like cinnamon when mixed in.

Excellent hot chocolate recipe!  I tried it according to the recipe and loved it, but when I made it a second time I got a little adventurous and added a bit of cardamom to taste.  That was even better for me, though not everyone likes the taste of cardamom.  Try it, you might like it!

I came across this recipe looking for something else, and I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe except I substituted 1 Tbsp coffee syrup instead of chocolate syrup and I added 1/8 cp milk and 1/8 cup cream instead of 1/4 cp milk. This was delicious!

This was quite tasty, something nice and different to try. I had mixed all my other ingredients together when I went to the fridge for milk, and realized that I didn't have any! So I used some left over evaporated milk I had in the fridge instead! I'm not sure how much this changed it, but it sure tasted fine! I did do as others suggested and used 1/2 milk to 1/2 water. The only complaint I had was that it was so rich, I couldn't drink it all on my own!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Easy and quick to make.  Note: If using hot chocolate mix that does not contain powdered milk, it is recommended to increase the proportion of milk to water used in this recipe. [Switch milk and water amounts.]  Also if it is not spicy enough for you possibly add some cayenne.

I really enjoyed it, although I am new to chilli powder and was a little hesitant in my pinch, might try a little more next time. For anyone struggling with the powders not incorporating, a trick I learned is to add a little of the hot water and mix it to a paste and then add the remaining hot water/milk. That way no loose powder is floating about

This is a very yummy hot chocolate!! Added a box chocolate pudding mix per half batch and used rounded measurements on the NesQuick and creamer. Very delicious and easy to make! I think I will try with vanilla or hazelnut creamer next time for a twist on a classic. Thanks for this recipe!

Tastes really good. I was worried there would be too much cinnamon, but the strong cinnamon is what made this hot chocolate so good. Will be making this again when I need a 
treat.

The flavor was wonderful, but much too thick for my taste.  Even my husband, who at first balked at the addition of chili powder, enjoyed it.

This was a very simple recipe.  I used milk only and I used one tablespoon of regular cocoa plus two and a half tablespoons of chocolate milk mix to the recipe.  Along with the cinnamon and spices it turned out just great!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was the best hot chocolate I've ever had. I did mix up my own hot chocolate mix instead of instant. And I topped it with marshmallows, its perfect.

This was really tasty,the chili adds a spicy kick that you only feel in your throat and the cinnamon balances the flavor. I used French vanilla creamer instead of milk and vanilla flavoring. That's what I had on hand. I noticed that someone complained about the cinnamon and chili rising to the top. You can fix this by mixing all the dry ingredients seperately then adding the hot water or milk a little bit at a time while whipping it to eliminate clumps.

This tastes great, but it doesn't mix together too well if you follow the directions.  I found it is a lot easier to mix the dry ingredients in a mug, then add the chocolate syrup to the milk (I do a half cup each milk and water, by the way), and I heat it in the microwave while the water boils on the stove.  I stir the warmed chocolate milk into the dry ingredients and stir to combine, then add the boiling water and give it a good stir until everything dissolves.

This was amazing! 

But do not, use the instant mix! I used  2TB unseetened cocoa powder instead, and with the chocolate syrup, it was still plenty sweet and had such a rich deep chocolate flavor. In fact, what I'm going to do next is omit the chocolate syrup altogether( to omit the high fructose corn syrup), use two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, and a ts of sugar to sweeten. 

And when it says a PINCH of chilli, it really is NOT kidding, lol.

This was excellent! A note for reviewer Framuesa: Putting just a few drops of hot water into the dry mix allows you to mix the powder into a paste before you add the rest of the liquid so that there are no "floaties".

I just made this because I've had it on my list for a while, and finally decided to try it.
It was GREAT! My husband loved it as well. I'm thinking that I may increase the milk content and decrease the water (or just use a cup of milk and skip the water entirely.)
I would definitely add the dry ingredients then the water/milk, then the chocolate syrup; it seemed a bit lumpy once I got to the end...but definitely worth making again!

Very yummy. The only change I made was to use 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C water and I heated them up together. With this recipe only having 1 C of liquid total, it only yields 1 serving, not 2. I also didn’t get much heat from the pinch of chili powder.  Nonetheless, this was quite tasty  and I will make it again!

I love this recipe. I put extra chili powder and cayenne into the drink to make it spicier. Also, used the whole hot chocolate packet instead of three tablespoons. I think it needs more milk, less water.  Will make this again.

This  is good, but it didn't have any heat that I could taste, even with 3 big pinches of chili powder. I think cayenne pepper instead of  chili powder would  give it the kick I was looking for.

I have to admit, I was a little weary of this recipe (my tolerance for spice is ridiculously low), but this hot chocolate recipe is great! Just the right amount of kick, and it's nice and rich. I did exchange the pinch of chili powder with a pinch of cayenne (for the life of me, I could not find our blasted chili powder), but it was awesome. I would definitely make this again.

I used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the syrup which added some depth to the flavor profile.  Since I was serving this at a party I had it in the crockpot and it worked very nicely.

I literally made this in minutes! I was so tastey! I used 1/2 water, 1/2 milk, and a little more than a pinch of red chilli powder. Next time, I think I will use less cinnamon, and milk only...sooo good!

Wow~so easy and so delicious.  I had been eyeing this recipe for awhile, and even though it's over 90 degrees, I finally had to make it and I LOVED it.  My husband tasted it and loved it too.  Thank you for the simple recipe.

This is yum. You have to be careful about it being too powdery tasting though. Stir the powder into a paste with a little hot water in a large round bowl first or oce you add the milk stick it all in your blender then add the boiling water. The last cup tasted the best and I used a pinch of cajun spice mix because it's all I had. tasty.

I had a "Chocolat" moment as soon as I drank this hot chocolate! I love that movie so much that I have it. It super easy to make and super good. The smell of cinnamon opens up your senses, the hint of chili in your throat feels so good! I used regular cocoa and california chili powder. Next time I'm adding New Mexico, I wanted more spice, just my personal taste!

I thought this was good. Strong cinnamon-chocolate taste, but there were small chunks of something (maybe clumped cinnamon?) in the drink.  I liked how the ingredients were easy to find, I didn't have to go out and buy something when I felt like making this one night.

The chocolate syrup adds that extra richness that is sometimes missing in powdered instant chocolate mixes.  Yummy!

This was easy and great...I had to make 3 batches since the kids couldn't get enough...I also added a bit of ovaltine for some nutrition and a slightly malty flavor.
