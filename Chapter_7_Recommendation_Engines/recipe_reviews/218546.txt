I mistakenly added the mozzarella cheese to the filling, but I actually like how that turned out,  except that there was none to sprinkle on top. I didn't add an egg, it was fine without. I made it the night before and it needed about an hour in the oven after coming from the refrigerator. The less-picky eaters  liked it.

Good when fresh out of the oven, but don't make for good leftovers.

I made just a couple of changes, based on energy level and pantry ingredients!  I didn't have any mushrooms so I unfortunately had to leave those out, and instead of cooking the shells first, I added a bit of water to the pan and let them cook in the oven.  I tossed in some cottage cheese I needed to use and voile - YUM!  I had some leftover filling, but instead of spreading it on top, I saved it and made a sort of casserole with some leftover penne noodles a few days later.  Yummy!

it was delicious, with extra sauce and cheese like someone said. I will do it again.

I made it with ground beef, minus the tofu, egg and bread crumbs. It turned out awesome
