OMG!   This recipe is FABULOUS!  The marinade is to-die-for and I find it just as good on pork and also steak.  My fav' dish at Steak & Ale restaurant is their Bourbon Street Steak.  I tried marinating some filets in this marinade and found that it tasted EXACTLY like theirs. We loved the salmon; found the marinade just as good on steak.  Thank you so much for posting this great recipe!

I liked this recipe but have made better salmon in the past so I wouldn't rush to make this again.  I didn't have any chives so I used parsley instead. I used the broiler so perhaps next time the grill would be better.

HEAVENLY! I make salmon for dinner frequently, but I was looking for something different...this was definately restaurant quality. I didn't have bourbon, so I used Grand Marnier instead (I also marinated the salmon for 5 hours). This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

I'm always looking for new marinades for fish, and especially ones without oil for healthier eating.  We were really impressed with this recipe. It tasted great!  We liked it so much, I'm making it again tonight!

Very good sauce, especially liked the bourbon flavor - it wasn't too strong at all. I didn't have chives so I substituted 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger (the kind that comes in a jar) and I liked the resulting flavor from it.

I prepared this dish for dinner tonight and it won raves!  For convenience sake, I prepared the marinade a day early and let the fillets rest over night.  Not only was it delicious, but it was quite easy, as well!  This is an ideal serving suggestion if you're looking to impress!

This is one of the Best Salmon Recipes I've tried.
It was so easy,  I let it marinade about 5 hours, and I had Rave Reviews.   Enjoy

This recipe was fantastic!  I haven't really cooked salmon before, so was sure I'd mess it up, but it turned out to be easy & tasted just great!  I marinated it for about 4 hours, and then cooked it on my George Foreman grill for approx. 3-5 minutes... We'll DEFINITELY have this meal again!!

We love this recipe!  My husband doesn't eat salmon, unless I make it this way.  Tastes alot like the bourbon sauce served in chain restaurants.   Did reduce bourbon to about 2 tablespoons; other times I've used Southern Comfort and that works too.  I do recommend serving the marinade as a sauce - just boil it for at least 2 minutes.  If you prefer, strain before serving.  My kids pour the sauce over everything on their plate!  Served with rice pilaf and broccoli.

FANTASTIC! I would suggest letting it sit in the marinade a bit longer. I kept mine in there for 2 hours and will even let it marinade longer the next time i use it, which will be very soon! I can't wait to use the marinade on fresh Tuna steaks and even trying it with skinless chicken breast. Thank you very much for this recipe, which my husband and myself both loved, and i'm passing it out to the girls at work!!

Didn't have chives, and marinated overnite, otherwise followed instructions.  Hubby says don't ever make salmon any other way again.

Made this twice. This works on chicken and salmon. I let it marinade for 4 + hours and the salmon did not get mushy. I did use 1/2 the brown sugar called for, as suggested (thank you) by other recipe raters. Can't imagine using more that that. I think it needed some ginger and will add that next time. Do boil down the marinade and serve as a sauce - very good!

Used a large salmon fillet and did it on the grill with hickory chips..outstanding, enjoyed by all!
Just a reminder...fish can get mushy if left to marinade too long, 1 hour is enough, certainly do not leave it for more  than is called for in the recipe.

I love this one.  I buy the uncut filet and grill it on a cedar plank.  Great flavor, the bourbon really stands out.  Also, great for nice dinner parties.  Will use again and again!

I have made this recipe many times and it is awesome consistently!  I don't change a thing, it is delicous as is.  I serve white rice with the salmon and while you have the grill out try grilling some fresh  asparagus to complete your meal!

My guests love it.  I marinated it overnight (about 14 hours) and it wasn't overmarinated as I had feared.  Used whisky instead of bourbon since that's what I had and it gave it a nice smoky flavor.  Next time I'll thicken the leftover marinade on the stove with some cornstarch and serve it on the side.

Wow!!  This was sensational!  I added 1 tsp. fresh orange peel, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/8 cup (1/4 sounded a tad too sweet).  Would make those same changes next time!  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Wonderful!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good. I let it marinade overnight as someone else suggested. It scorched a bit when broiling in my oven. Will attempt again

I made this last night and we loved it!  Didn't have any bourbon, so I used cognac and the flavour was wonderful.  I marinated for 6 hours.

i made this for some friends and served it with mushroom wild rice and steamed frozen green beans. i think i may have overcooked the salmon a little, but it was still received well. the sauce turned into a glaze and it was pretty sweet. i used jack daniels whiskey instead of kentucky bourbon. easy and tasty, but salmon could me made easier.

Yum!!!  My husband is not a huge fan of salmon, but knowing it is so good in omega 3, I try to make it as often as possible.  He loved this recipe and actually went back for seconds!  This recipe will definitely go into my regular rotation.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have fresh chives and used dried.  I reduced the marinade and put some on top of the salmon and brown rice.

The marinade itself  did not enhance the natural flavors of the salmon in the beneficial way asian/lemonbutter/ or dijon marinades do. I think it completely overpowered the fish.

I enjoyed this salmon recipe very much!  It was almost like a southeastern U.S. twist on tariyake.  The only deviations I made from the original recipe were that 1 marinated the salmon overnight (glad i did), used lime juice instead of lemon, and I baked the salmon in some of the marinade at 400 for 17 minutes or so instead of broiling it.  The result was very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again, perhaps even with chicken, but next time I'll use some cayenne pepper to heat it up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really do not like salmon, but I make it for my husband.  He absolutely loved it.  I used this marinade for my chicken breast and found it very good too.  I probably could have marinaded the chicken a little bit longer and will definately do so.  This marinade is awesome.  Thank you.

I have been making this recipe ever since it appeared in Cooking Light several years ago. Several dinner guests have said it is the best salmon they've ever tasted. We absolutely love the flavor. I usually buy a large 1.5-2 lb uncut fillet and use that. It is easy to handle and very easy to serve...it is so tender it can be cut into smaller portions after grilling. A must-have recipe!!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  Since my boyfriend doesn't really like fish, I made the same amount of marinade and split it up, some for his chicken breast and some for my fish, and marinated them seperately.  They turned out to be delicious on both!  I also added a bit of ginger to my marinade... Will definitely make again!

Had a good flavor and everyone enjoyed.  Personally, I like strong flavors from my dishes, so I probably would changed the recipe a little to make the flavors stand out more.

This was great!!!  I marinated for 4 hrs and left out the bourbon and it was terrific!  My daughter won't eat fish but the rest of the family loved it.  Just flavor combination was perfect.

I am making this salmon today for the second time.  This recipe makes even me look like a master chef!  I added a little bit of ground red pepper and used parsley instead as I did not have any chives.  Make sure to use 6 oz filets so the marinade can "sink in."  Also, like other review said, grill until the salmon is crispy on outside.

I had a citrus/bourbon glazed salmon at a favorite restaurant.  This is almost an exact copy, and maybe even better.  I love this receipe.  The only time consuming part is marinating the fish, and that's a no-brainer.

This was a very good marinade!  Like a previous reviewer, I used dried chives instead of fresh, but everything else I followed exactly.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the salmon ended up a little dry (over-grilled), but I wasn't manning the grill. ;) Served this with the spicy sweet potatoes recipe from this site, cooked in a foil packet on the grill!

Fantastic dish!  Perfect as is.  My husband and I absolutely loved it, and even my ten-month old son enjoyed it.  The only change I would make is to marinate the fish overnight in the refrigerator.

Oh-My-God! This was absolutely outstanding!  I used yellowfin tuna steaks instead of salmon; recipe was followed exactly as written with no other modifications.  The flavor was wonderful.  This is going in our  Recipe Box as a definite keeper!

I thought this was quite good. I reduced the marinade in a sauce pan while the fish cooked then used it as a dipping sauce.

This was a nice change from our usual salmon. I doubled the sauce and cooked in in a pan. Used some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and served it with rice. Was very good. Tasted like something from Applebee's or TGIFriday's.

This was pretty good - turned out moist, even under the broiler.  I followed the recipe exactly; but, for some reason I can't put my finger on - it just wasn't "wow" for me.

The flavor of the fish with this marinade was excellent.  However, I used my broiler because of the rain here this spring.  I even undercooked it by 2 minutes but it still dried out under the broiler.  Even though I have not tried grilling it, I can tell from the delicious taste of the marinade that basting it well over a grill will result in some outstanding salmon!

This is fantastic.  We make the marinade and then grill it on a cedar wood plank.  It is so moist and full og flavor.  You can order cedar wood planks on ebay for much cheaper than your local bbq store.

Pretty good and tasty, but it seemed to bring out the fishy flavor of the salmon.  So only 4 stars, but it was quite good, and a light refreshing way to have salmon.

This recipe was awesome!  It was really easy to make and the flavours weren't too strong or overpowering. A wonderful marinade for chicken breasts too.

This was an excellent recipe, my guests and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't grill it because I didn't want to heat of the grill, but baking it worked beautifully.  I highly recommend it.

My husband said that I had to give this a 5 star rating.  He loved it.  We are usually not big fish eaters but, had some salmon so we tried this.  It was very good, it tasted a lot like teriyaki.  A tasty dish that we will make again. Thanks for Sharing

You must try this recipe! The bourbon and citrus blend really nicely. I added fresh lime juice to the marinade and marinatied the fish for about 6 hours. It turned out great!!

This is the absolute BEST marinade for salmon or any fish.  Even my son loved it and he hates fish. My daughter wants to try this on grilled chicken breasts. I left out the green onions and chives, because I didn't have them and it was still wonderful..

Delicious!  Be sure and let the fish marinate for several hours and don't be afraid of cooking the fish until it is chargrilled.

Yummy.. I over cooked it.. that's unfortunate.. but the flavours were so delish! Who'd have thought bourbon (Jimmy Beam) and OJ went together!  Cook for about 8 minutes to ten on "3" on broil.  I cooked it for close to 20!  Holy cow.. very dry. Would make again and probably give five stars!

This was very good but not the best salmon recipe here. My hubby threw out the marinade so I was unable to baste the salmon as it cooked...I'm sure it would have been much better if he hadn't. I will probably make this again & see if the flavor is improved w/ basting because it did have a good flavor. I just don't feel it was strong enough to counteract the fishiness of the salmon.

I love cooking salmon and this recipe resulted in the best salmon I've ever made. I made this dish for a hot date that I cooked for the first time and she was very, very impressed. I modified the recipe a little, as I always tend to do, by adding honey(same parts as brown sugar), a little more orange juice, and I substituted the bourbon with brandy.

My whole family LOVES this recipe.  It is so easy & so good.  I usually leave out the chives & I marinate the meat for about 8 hours or overnight.  I've used it on both salmon & chicken & both are wonderful.  The bourbon gives it a nice smoky flavor that we really enjoy.

I doubled the bourbon (Jack Daniels actually) and the orange juice proportions (by accident) as well I added the zest of one orange (not by accident),then marinated the salmon for about 3 hours before bar b queing it and everyone loved the recipe. I was worried about the flavour being too strong but it was fantastic and not overpowering in the least....my mistake turned out great!

The whole family loved this recipe (even my husband who turns his nose up at all fish).  Weather wasn't good enough to grill, so I baked it at 400 until done in a little of the marinade.  Reduced the remaining marinade to a caramel consistency and used it as a sauce on the fish.  Yummy!  Will make this again and again!

This was very good - almost 5 stars! The sauce would be good on any fish. We grilled the salmon and enjoyed it very much!

I made this recipe several weeks ago, and forgot to rate it.  I didn't have bourbon, so I used some whiskey instead.  I was a little worried while it marinated, as the whiskey aroma was very strong, but the fish turned out wonderfully.  It was very moist and tasty, and we all loved it.

I love fish, but salmon was always too strong for me.  This marinade makes it a new favorite at my house!  Thank you!!

Good but not as sweet as I thought it would be.  Not a lot of zing but good.  Would make again and maybe add some honey.  I marinated for 4 hours but did leave out the bourbon...maybe that is the missing zing?  Oh well...good recipe

Absolutely amazing!  the longer you can marinate (overnight MAX) the more intense and great the flavor.  this is a must try, especially with wild salmon (as opposed to farm raised).

This was great. I didn't have any bourbon, chives, or green onion so I left them out. The citrus and soy sauce combo was wonderful. My picky hubby said this is a definite keeper. I used a 1 lb. filet and ended up marinating it over 24 hours (planned on less but didn't end up making it the day we'd originally planned on.)The extra long marinate time really gave it a chance to soak in, though. Too cold to grill, so I cooked under the broiler for about 12 minutes.

We enjoyed this salmon recipe.  The marinade is very easy to put together.  I didn't think the bourbon added that much more flavor, but it was still very tasty.  We'll probably make this again.

This is a very good marinade!  I marinated a whole half salmon in it for about 8 hours before grilling it and it was fantastic! I also grilled some asparagus and made a ceaser salad with the salmon on top. So-o so good. Next time I will try shrimp and scallops.

This recipe is good however, after grilling I don't think the flavors of the marinade stood out as much as I would have liked.

Always a success!  I've made this many times and it is a favorite in my fish rotation.  I usually marinate for many hours - it is great because all of the work  is done hours before dinner - making the dinner hour a lot easier.  I usually serve with wild rice, green beans and some rolls.  Yum!
