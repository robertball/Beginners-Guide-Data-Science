I have made these a few times, and my whole family loves them. I use a can of Campbell's Nacho Cheese soup instead of the Cream of Chicken, and I use Mexican four cheese blend instead of Cheddar cheese and add 1/2 cup extra too. Simply easy & delicious!!

Sorry Campbell's, but this is not your best effort. I have made many recipes with soup, but the worst part might have been the canned chicken (I thought the fact that they were canned would be disguised by all of the sauce, but no such luck). My husband was sweet, and he ate them, but he later admitted he hated them, too.

Made with a large can of chicken and added more cheese.  Also added about 1/2 to 3/4 c. chopped onion, chili powder and some crushed red pepper as it seemed a little bland.  Rather than warming in oven, browned in a skillet over med-low heat after spraying each tortilla with Pam; this gave a little crunch to the tortillas.  Rather than folding over I put two tortillas together, moistening edges as directed, browned on each side and cut in wedges with pizza cutter; served w/sour cream.  My husband loved it so will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great. I omitted the chili powder b/c I was feeding little ones. I added a bit of sour cream and it was so creamy! Was a hit with the husband and kids. I found that 8 minutes in the oven was just right for the shells. Will definitely make this again!

Next time will add green onion, garlic powder and red pepper.  Didn't want to over fill my quesadilla maker, so they were kind of thin and bland.  Look out next time, probably will start a fire!

A little plain, but very easy to make.  I used shredded chicken breasts instead of the canned meat, and I added some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.

I loved this but I also added to it. I put 1/2 C. mild cheddar and 1/2 C. pepper jack cheese along with taco bell mild taco red sauce and green sauce I didn't measure exact but between the two it was 1/4 C. then instead of chilli powder I added cajun seasoning as well as a tsp. garlic and sprinkling of lawrys seasoned salt. Also chopped a jalapeno finely and added fresh crumbled bacon to mix. when I cooked it I sprayed butter spray on cookie sheet and some over tops of casadilla's then sprinkled garlic salt lightly over tops and also parmesean cheese as well THEY WERE AWESOMESAUCE

My husband liked this more than I did, but it was nice and easy to make.  I did add green pepper and doubled the cheese as others recommended.  I think an important thing to remember about this recipe is to use the chicken breast, if you get the canned with the dark meat it is not as good.

This is a winner with my family.  But rather than cook them in the oven, I heat the filling in the microwave and use warmed tortillas and wrap them as burritos.  This eliminates the dry crusty tortilla problem.  I use Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herb soup, double the chili powder and throw in a dash of cayenne.

I added a cup of onion but found that 10 minutes was too long for them. Will be trying a shorter time or lower temperature next time!

I hate to say I tried this and it really didn't taste good to me.  Maybe more seasoning would be better.
