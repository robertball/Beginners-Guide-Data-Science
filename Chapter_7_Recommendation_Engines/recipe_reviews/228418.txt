This was awesome!!! I did exactly as the recipe stated and my family raved about it.   The only thing that I would specify is when it just coats the spoon you need to take some and put it on a plate and let it cool.  Then you will know the real consistency.

I really like the glaze and plan to serve it as a side with roasted veggies at a pre-Thanksgiving dinner.  However, this recipe should come with some kind of bio-hazard warning.  Be aware that MAKING THIS RECIPE WILL FILL YOUR KITCHEN- AND TO SOME EXTENT YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE- WITH FAIRLY NOXIOUS FUMES.  If you have a vent in your kitchen that vents directly to the outside (which I don't) you might be OK; otherwise I recommend making this recipe outdoors if possible.  Also, the smell while cooking is not pleasant and lingers all day, so I wouldn't make it on the same day that guests are arriving.  However, again, I do like the glaze- it tastes like molasses combined with uber-vinegar.

Yummy!  I added about 2 tablespoons of butter and it was even better.  Perfect over all the summer tomatoes we have right now.

To recreate Nonna Pia's excellent balsamic reduction I bumped up the brown sugar to between 1 and 1 1/4 cups - depending on how sweet you like the glaze.  Also, I added three whole sprigs of rosemary. Due to the higher sugar content you have to watch for it becoming too hard by frequently testing with a small amount on a cool plate.  If it is hardening too much just add a touch of balsamic vinegar.  Turned out beautifully.  This is great for all types of recipes or just with olive oil and bread.

This was the first time I've ever made a balsamic reduction and like the one reviewer I added a pat of butter and it made it very silky and delicious.  And my kids totally agree with Roni's review about the noxious fumes!  However, I have a cold with stuffed sinuses and luckily cannot smell a thing! Definately make this with windows open, but it is well worth it.  Made mine with maple syrup because I didn't have b. sugar on hand, and drizzled over the Savory Pork Roast from this site and it was fantastic...definately recipe box worthy.

Thanks for sharing this recipe with the cooking community! I made the recipe with  1/2 c Splenda Brown Sugar AND 1/2 c honey. 
I then drizzled a few tablespoons of cooled glace over sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella (sliced) cheese that I sprinkled with I salt - pepper and olive oil. Wow, the cooked glaze is so much better that just adding balsamic vinegar to this salad! Again, thanks!

I did not reduce in a pan, I cover this over boneless skinless chicken breast and place in crock pot. Cook 6 to 7 hrs  on low. The smell in the house is amazing and our entire family tears it up. Left over chicken makes the best chicken salad I have eaten.

This is great! I made it for a drizzle over caprese. My husband ended up getting some on his flank steak and was in heaven with the flavor pairing!  As others previously posted I do recommend opening some windows and/or a door if smells get to you. 

I found the 20 minutes was perfect as I took it off the burner and let it set for a couple of minutes and it thickened up nicely (basically just let it cool and it will thicken into a glaze for you). I ended up pouring the leftovers into a jar and just reheating it for 15 seconds the next day to use it as a drizzle over some bacon,tomato, and feta pizza. Will keep making this one again =)

I don't know what happened. It was like science went awry.

I followed the instructions, and like a lot of reviews it didn't thicken. So, I assumed I was just being impatient and waited longer.

DON'T DO IT. It suddenly started to foam and separate into foul smelling death liquid and balsamic candy. On low heat. It was like a vinegar stink bomb monster took over my house.

It would seem that this recipe is successful if you have the "right" sugar and balsamic. I used Safeway's store brand brown sugar and their Organics balsamic.

I regret my decisions.

I cut this recipe in half, once finished, I lifted it up and with a big smile on my face, my step daughter and I both said, it looks like tar! Drizzled a little over a slice of mozzarella for our caprese salad and all she could say was, oh my god! It was soooo good!

Made this glaze and used it for fried calamari.Ideep Fried nice thin sliced rings and the tentacles in a dry batter (flour, salt, pepper, sprinkle of baking powder) , then tossed with banana pepper rings, halved grape tomatoes, torn fresh basil and a squeeze of fresh lemon.  This came out amazing and got RAVE reviews from my guests.

Am absolutely wonderful glaze. We used it drizzled over hummus served with grilled naan bread coated with garlic and olive oil. Terrific. My husband and I could not get enough of this. Now I can't wait to try it on other items.

My Hubby and I tried this in a Italian Restaurant as an appetizer. It was Prosciutto Fresh Mozzarella & portabella Mushrooms Drizzled with Balsamic Glaze. It was so good. The combination of flavors was Great. So My Hubby and I recreated for our friends they love it as much as we did. Thanks Happy Cooking!

It doesnât thicken like YOU would expect it to thicken but it DOES THICKEN people. I looked and it it looked the same but when I did what the directions said and tested it by seeing if it coated the spoon and it did it was done! It tastes great!

This is a super recipe! We doubled it and it turned out delicious. It is far cheaper than buying glaze at the store, and we found it tasted better and sweeter than even the expensive organic bottle we bought from an Italian market. Will make it regularly :)

I minimized the recipe to 1/2 c. raspberry balsamic and 2 T. brown sugar. Added 1 T butter. I cooked it for only 15 minutes (that's when it coated the spoon) and loved the smell as it cooked! guess you need to love vinegar to love the smell! Anyway will use this for caprese and brussell sprouts at least.

No changes! It came out "fantastic"! Next time we will (1) Reduce it to a greater degree because we want it thicker. (2) We will explore adding the following individually or in combination salt honey brown sugar molasses. Tasting these ingredients in a tablespoon is our method of savoring this elixir.

This is really good. I made a stuffed pork tenderloin and used this to drizzle atop that. I added more sugar so not as tart and did add 3 tablespoons of butter because it adds richness. It turned out wonderful.

This tastes wonderful; I used it on a one pan chicken and veggies recipe. But fair warning the vinegar-y fumes while cooking are crazy strong and permeated the house! I choked a bit and I think my husband down in the basement almost passed out. I can't believe more people haven't mentioned this... Is there any way to prevent or lessen it? I opened a window but that didn't do much (our oven vent doesn't go outside). Well I guess our air is completely sanitized now!

It tastes great, but then I never had it before so my frame of reference is small.  As with other reviewers, use your kitchen fan otherwise you will knock yourself out.  My glaze didnât start to thicken and reduce until the 40 minute mark, then BAM, done.   I didnât have a whole 2 cups of regular balsamic, so I used 1 cup regular and 1 cup honey balsamic.  Pretty tasty.  Special note, believe the author; a little goes a long way.

I cooked it for about 30 minutes. It was so good on my salad. It does get thicker as it cools in the refrigerator. Itâs excellent!

It was delicious! We had sweet potato hash brown with brussel spouts and salmon. It was awesome! I made half the recipe and was still able to save some for later.
My husband & I loved it

Threw a little honey in there for good measure. Glazed salmon and drizzled asparagus with it. Fam loved it will make again.

Just made this for the first time...I wound up doubling up on the sugar because initially it didn't thicken for me. I think the recipe fails to tell you that it will thicken over time so it might have been fine if I waited but it was my first time and I didn't know any better. It was a hit in my household though! I will definitely be making it again!:)

I love the flavor of this. I think I simmered it too long though. I've learned that sometimes timing things just doesn't work as well as going by sight and taste. I simmered until it coated my spoon thoroughly and then when it cooled it was SUPER thick! It will still work as a drizzle over my salads but I doubt I'll simmer as long next time.

I made no changes! Delish! I did cook alittle hotter than the simmer. Kept it to a barely almost boil... it reduced just as expected.

I can't get over how much better this is than plain balsamic. Sooo good especially in a caprese salad or sandwich. I added a little bit of butter.

Never thickened - even after a half hour of simmering - I added a ton more sugar and it was finally usable.

I don't know why people are complaining that it smells up the house and doesn't thicken. I have made this glaze (not this recipe) for years and never have a problem with either. I usually make it to pour over brussell sprouts and roast them but today I am going to pour it over salmon salad. It thickens if you let it sit in the pan for a little while.

This recipe is great exactly as written... but I have a bit of an addiction to mole. The problem is that I've never been able to make a good one and the ones you buy in a store are awful. I recently bought a bottle of chocolate balsamic... so I tried this recipe (a small batch) with the pat of butter and brushed it on a sous vide flank steak just before I threw it on the grill to finish it. It was superb. I'll definitely do this again with flavored balsamic.

Like a couple of others suggested I amped up the brown sugar to about 1 & 1/4 cups. Would definitely recommend this for a thicker result. I also think the extra sweetness is good - it's still definitely tangy from the vinegar so I think the 1/2 cup listed wouldn't be enough to cut through that at all. It didn't reduce that much but it got thick enough to coat the back of a spoon so I pulled it off then about 25 minutes. If you want it to still be pourable I wouldn't worry about reducing it by the full amount just as long as it thickens up a little it will be good!

Just made this a second time.  Made exactly per recipe (stunk up my kitchen), reduced and slightly thickened in pan.  I just placed a small amount in a bowl and placed it in the fridge to help it cool down and thicken a bit more.  Will use it on a caprese sandwich, seriously this stuff is addictive!
