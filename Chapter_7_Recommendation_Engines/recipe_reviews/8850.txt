I love the idea of this recipe, but I like everyone else did not use French dressing and who eats cornflakes anymore. I have made this twice once with Caesar dressing and breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese, and tonight with a cheese and garlic Italian dressing and again breadcumbs w/Parmesan. I baked at 360 for 40min. Both turned out very moist and had great flavor. Hope this helps.

Easy & quick. The whole family enjoyed it. I must say that I find msot of the reviews for this recipe odd... if you completely change it, how can you rate it?

We used ranch dressing and breadcrumbs- Very tasty.  I poured the ranch into a ziplock and threw the chicken in and shook it around and hit with a rolling pin a few times- the chicken came out very moist, and there was no mess from 'dipping' the chicken into the dressing. Will make again, even the picky husband loved it- took about 45-50 mins to bake.

I made this recipe to suit my diet.  I used 1 cup of non-fat ranch dressing and 1 1/2 cups of non-fat garlic croutons.  This was excellent.

Fantastic!  Not only is the flavor and crunchiness out of this world, but this recipe knows chicken!!!!  She bakes it only 25-30 minutes, not like other website "chefs" who advise baking 1-1/2 hours!  That's TOUGH chicken. Also, I had some leftover gravy and stuffing that I mixed together and placed it over the chicken breast halves. This was another alternative!

I've made this without the salad dressing for years, and it always comes out crisp, moist and delicious.
I use the cornflake crumbs or breadcrumbs,but always add some garlic powder and, occasionally, dried oregano to the crumbs. I found that the crumbs will adhere beautifully if the chicken is just damp. A few tiny dabs of butter or margerine on top, and bake 350 for 40-45 minutes.  I never seem to find the chicken breasts with the wing attached these days, but they are delicious that way.

The Dressing gave a great marinade. I used Italian Dressing and added Italian seasonings to the bread crumbs.  It was a hit over rice! Thanks.

I tried this because the rating was so high, but had low expectations because of the ingredients.  Unfortunately I was right.  This just didn't suit our tastes.  All as well, thanks for the post.

This was great!!!  I'm so happy I found this recipe.  I used Catalina dressing and Japanese Panko breadcrumbs.  I cut the breast in half and pounded it a bit.   Baked at 375 for 30 mins and the chicken was still tender and the coating was crunchy!  I will definitely make it again.

Truthfully I didn't think I would like this, but my husband loves French dressing so I thought I would try.

It was delicious- crispy and juicy. I didn't change anything except using some Garlic powder and Seasoning salt on the chicken which I do with everything.

Very quick and easy! Thanks!

The baking time of the chicken is PERFECT - the texture of the chicken was cooked but not too tough, really nice. MAKE SURE you use cornflake cereal crumbs instead of bread crumbs because if you use the latter, the dressing will make the crumbs at the bottom of the chicken soggy. The former won't.  The portions of the ingredients suggested are a BIT too much (I had a lot of leftover and had to waste a lot of crumbs). but overall, an extremely easy recipe that tastes great!

For a quick and easy chicken dish, this was very good! I had a bottle of French dressing that no one liked on salad - it seemed to have a bit more of a kick to it than the regular brand I buy, so I used some on this.  Only change was to add a little dried thyme to the crushed cornflakes to give it a little more flavor.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this dish! I like the idea of trying other types of salad dressings, too!

This is simply wonderful. I used Catalina dressing and crushed saltines with some french fried onions mixed in, because it was what I had on hand. Rave reviews form the Fam.  Have made it twice in 1 week--new favorite.

Excellent recipe!  This turned out perfect, and it was my 13 y/o daughter who made it.  It would be interesting to try variations using honey mustard dressing or ranch dressing instead of French.

This one is on high rotation at my house. I use boneless, skinless thigh fillets, a no-oil balsamic dressing and a stuffing mix flavoured with parsely, sage, rosemary,thyme and marjoram. Then I bake the chicken until I can smell it! Perfect every time.

my family loved this!  i didn't have the corn flakes so used someone's suggestion of crushed crutons.  i also added parmesan cheese and a little minced garlic to the french dressing.  it was so easy and good!  i also took the suggestion from someone to drizzle a little more of the dressing on it half-way through cooking.  it looked as good as it tasted.

My family LOVED this chicken-even my picky husband. It was so easy to make- that I let my 5 and 8 year old children make it. I personally found the flavor odd with French dressing- but we all have our different tastes! Would recommend at least trying it.

Like Shake N Bake, but better!  This was so easy.  I needed to use up some French dressing, which I normally don't buy.  We let drumsticks sit in the dressing overnight. We also ground up some garlic croutons to make breadcrumbs.  The chicken was great.  I'd buy French dressing alone just for this recipe.

This recipe was NOT good as listed, but when I substituted ranch dressing for the french and italian bread crumbs for the corn flake crumbs, we had a winner!  The cornflake crumbs do not seem to work with the dressings {flavorwise}, but the italian bread crumbs worked beautifully!

This was pretty good. Of course I added a lot more seasonings and because I didn't have any corflake crumbs in the house, I used bread crumbs. The kids really enjoyed this the most. Thanks R.A.S.

I buy cornflakes.  Maybe I like the idea of eating cereal that isn't coated in sugar!  Also, they are a delicious topping for casseroles (especially with cheese!).  The only thing different that I did was to marinate the chicken for a few hours.  I have also done this with pork chops.  It is very good.  I also use French dressing as a marinade for grilled meat and vegetables (without coating, obviously!).  There is more to life than Ranch.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe - only had bone-in thighs, but they worked just fine - and used Catalina instead of French dressing.  Will definitely be making this again.

The salad dressing I thought I had turned out to be Blue Cheese salad dressing. I used and it worked out fine.

I made this recipe with Ranch dressing instead of Italian because it was what I had on hand.  I loved it!  It's so easy and full of flavor.  I served it with some of my special mashed potatoes for some friends and every one loved the meal!

very easy and juicy.  Have never tried Ranch dressing but will.   Also, cornflakes seem to be the best coating and are available at most bulk barns so you don't have to purchase a large box.

Great and very easy. In my version, I used honey dijon dressing and seasoned the cornflake crumbs. (There are many suggestions in other reviews.) A slightly hotter oven (375-400) helped with the crisping. Mine were done in 30 mins.

Excellent recipe! I used 6 boneless chicken tenders; which was perfect for 3 people. I also added salt/pepper on the tenders after removing from oven. I did not find this recipe to be soggy at all; husband and I both loved it and will definitely make it again :) ... I served the chicken along side with baked potato, peas and corn. I had to give our 2 cats a tender to let us eat in peace :) ... added this one to my saved recipes, thanks for the recipe!!

I utilize a similar recipe though I add parmesan cheese and a packet of (Hidden Valley) ranch dressing mix to the bread crumbs. It adds a much needed flavor boost. :) Real crowd pleaser! Thanks for sharing.

I can't really rate this yet, but all I can say is that you need to use a good brand of French dressing.  I used a cheap bottle, and the entire thing smelled like cider vinegar.  Sure enough, it was the third ingredient under sugar and high-fructous corn syrup.

I loved the taste of the chicken w/french dressing. It just didn't seem to be enough flavor. I think next time I will let it sit in the dressing for awhile. I used herb-seasoned bread stuffing crumbs and they worked great. I had to cook the chicken alot longer than stated.

Made this tonight and like others subbed some stuff.  I used fat free Italien dressing and Italien bread crumbs.  Had to bake an extra 12 minutes to get rid of the pink meat.

I thought this was just ok.  Maybe if I try it again Id only put the cornflake mix onto the tops of the chicken breasts.  When I coated them, the bottom part that was on the pan never got crispy, just soggy.  I wasnt a huge fan of the french dressing either.

We always have Corn Flakes and French dressing in the house.  I'm not a huge fan of corn flake coatings--its a texture thing--but this was not bad.  I wouldn't have thought of using French dressing (Italian is possibly the more obvious choice) but I thank you for the idea.  I think I may try it as a marinade, too.

This was a really good recipe. I used the French dressing and bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. I also mixed in parmesean cheese into the bread crumbs. Cooking for 30 minutes on 400 degrees made the chicken perfectly tender and moist! My only complaint is that the french dressing just wasn't what I was in the mood for. However, I am definitely going to make this again but with a different dressing! It was so simple!

I love the idea that this recipe is so easy and very quick to prepare and cook and it was delicious!  I used ranch dressing and breadcrumbs, cooked it exactly the way the recipe said and it came out perfect!  My parents loved it and I'm making it again tonight.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dish last night due to all the rave reviews and didn't care for it at all.  The chicken itself had no flavor and the dressing made the outside mushy not crunchy at all.  I won't make this again.

Great recipe if you're cooking for just yourself.  One small-to-medium sized chicken breast cooked for 25 min and was nice and juicy.  I made steamed mixed veggies on the side.  Great for one person!

Great, easy recipe!  I used the thin sliced chicken breasts with ranch dressing (put in ziplock bag for easy coating), then covered in italian bread crumbs with some garlic powder and baked for 30 minutes - delicious!

I do not know if this is a honest rating or not since I did make changes.  I used chicken thighs and let them soak in Good Seasoning Italian Dressing and then rolled in seasoned bread crumbs (did not have corn flakes on hand).  My husband and teen son loved this chicken and so did I.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will try it with the cornflakes.
*Tried it again, this time with cornflake crumbs.  Loved the crispiness!  This is a keeper!  Thanks

This was great very moist and tender.  I however, swayed from the recipe, I used creamy french dressing and bread crumbs which I put some grated parmesan in and some other seasonings.  Everyone loved it, I'd make it again my way of course.  I can see how corn flakes could be kind of blah tasting.

This was a really great recipe!!  I did change a few things though...I didn't have french dressing so I used a mixture of Italian and Ranch Dressing...I also used italian bread crumbs instead of the cornflakes...I also used 10 chicken tenderloins instead.

I was a little skeptical at first because of the french dressing, but it was actually really good. I did half with italian and the other with french dressing. I used italian bread crumbs. Thanks! I'll definitely make it again.

My family really disliked this recipe. The french dressing wasn't enough to make the breadcrumbs stick to the chicken.

Fantastic, very moist and yummy. I used spicy french dressing and mixed seasoned bread crumbs with Romano grated cheese, I used Costco chicken breasts that are very plump, so it took longer to cook through, 350 for 45 min. Served with cheesy rice and peas.. kids loved loved it, and that does not happen often.

My husband loved this, but my children and I did not.  Maybe I used too much French dressing, but the chicken's outer coating ended up soggy instead of crisp.  Also, the French dressing taste was kind of ho-hum for me.  One plus:  The chicken turned out moist.  I had to bake longer because of the breasts' thickness.

This was a very easy recipe and I love how moist the chicken turns out but I found that it lacked in flavor. This could be because I am currently living in Germany where perhaps the french dressing has a different flavor to it. I will definitley try to make a few changes to increase flavor if I make this again.

This chicken turned out soggy for me.  I cooked it for way over the recommended time to try to get the breading at least a tiny bit crunchy...never happened...the chicken turned out really chewy and stringy and the breading soggy...won't try again.

I made this using the ranch dressing & Italian bread crumbs.  It turned out delicious and moist.  BUT - the chicken wasn't done 30 minutes - it took more like an hour for it to be fully cooked. I will definitely make this again.

OMG This was so easy and tasted wonderful! I used Russian instead of French because it is what I had, although I love French dressing and think it would have been just as good. Like someone else had suggested, I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes.

Great recipe!  I was looking for a new chicken recipe but I'm currently on a special diet.  I used f.f. french dressing and I crushed up Melba toast instead of the corn flakes.  It is wonderful.  Thank you so much!

My husband, who likes almost everything I make, did not like this.  I didn't care much for it either...it was pretty bland.  I will try it again, though, using a different type of dressing and spicing up the cornflake crumbs with a little salt and garlic powder.  I will say, the chicken was tender and moist.

This was just ok. No one in this house really likes French dressing so we changed it to Thousand Island. And I used others' advice about using bread crumbs. The breading came out decent on top but soggy on bottom. The flavor was pretty bland even though I used seasoned bread crumbs. If I try this again I will increase the heat and add extra seasonings to the bread crumbs (garlic, onion, cajun...anything) Thanks for a new one to at least try out...

Disappointingly not good at all!  I used Catalina French dressing (which I love) and this was just horrible.  I even drizzled butter on the cornflakes as another cook had suggested - and the chicken just an usually awful flavor.

I did change it up a bit, used Catalina dressing instead and used Rice Krispies crushed with 1 tsp poultry seasoning mixed in , I drizzled it with about 4 Tbsp of melted butter before baking, huge hit and have made it several times very easy and helps zing up booooring chicken!!!

Very easy and good.  I used leg quarters.  I've made it this way before with a honey mustard sauce, and we like it that way better.  However, this is not a bad tasting recipe.  Just personal preference.

I would never use bottled French dressing for anything until making this chicken. It all started because I was hoping to use up some cornflakes. Super easy and SO tasty!  Cornflakes stayed crunchy without burning and dressing added nice flavor without being too sweat, tangy or artificial tasting. Great pantry recipe!

Always make dressing. Use bread crumbs. Whole chic boobs. Crazy moist. Mike's favorite.

Loved it. Great for weekday dinners. I made it with Tostitos Hint of Lime chips, made the sauce with ranch dressing, added olive oil, and crushed black pepper. Served with steamed green beans, carrots, chayote and mashed potatoes. Will definitely cook again :-)

I thought the chicken turned out moist, but the flavor to me was very odd, and I love French dressing. It just didn't seem to work well in this recipe to me. Thanks anyway!

Really scrumptious!! The more bread crumbs you make though, the better. I used Club Crackers, and it was super delicious! With Italian dressing :)

I followed the recipe exactly (with "homemade" French dressing) and it came out great. My picky 4 year old ate a TON and my husband really liked it too. And I'm not really much of a cook so you know it had to be easy. Yay!

Based on the excellent reviews, I figured I would give this a try, but was not impressed at all. We just did not care for the taste at all. In addition, the breading got very soggy on the bottom of the chicken.

I had some extra French dressing to use and I found this recipe.  I usually do my chicken strips in a very similar manner using some well seasoned mayo and then coated in a mixture of ground crackers, corn flakes, and fried onions (we avoid commercial bread crumbs to avoid dairy.)  The French dressing gave it a different, but nice taste as did using only corn flakes.  It is very easy to make.  It keeps the chicken moist and tender.  It's a basic preparation for chicken than can be modified to suit your own tastes by varying the spices, dressings, and choice of breading.  We actually liked it much better the second day cold and sliced thin on top of a greens salad.

I gave this 4 stars because we weren't huge on the dressing selection, but we did it again with Kraft balsamic vinagrette dressing and crushed croutons (we were out of corn flakes, but those turn out well, too), and it was wonderful! Will definitely make this again.

This was quick and easy to make.  We had to cook it a little longer to make is crispy. Overall, I would definitely use this recipe again.

Instead of french dressing, I combined some mayo and italian dressing with a little garlic. Worked great! :)

My husband was "wierded-out" by the dressing, however my kids (ages 3 & 5) loved this. I used thighs and increased the baking time.

Yummy, but I made a few changes.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used crushed Rice Crispies as did another reviewer.  I washed the chicken and blotted them dry on a paper towel, sprinkled them with Morton's Seasoning, dipped them in the dressing then the rice crispies and baked.  Yummy.

I will not make this again. The corn flake crumbs were messy and did not stick to the chicken at all with the french dressing. Also, I wouldn't use french dressing (which I normally love) because it is an odd taste with the cornflakes.
