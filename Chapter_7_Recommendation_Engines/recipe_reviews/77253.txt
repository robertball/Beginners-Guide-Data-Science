I personally would remove the olive oil and replace it with a tbsp of canola oil and the Worcestershire sauce replace it with 2 tbsp of beef bouillon. reduce water to 1 cup of water since this meal is supposed to be wet but not soupy and I would add garlic powder and a tomato finely chopped. That is how my mom makes it.

This was terrible. The zucchini was mushy, and it had no flavor.

We followed the directions ALMOST to a T - my husband made the observation that depending on the size/depth of pan you're using, the amount of water you use "to cover" the ingredients could be VASTLY different.  We halved all of the ingredients, so per another reviewer's suggestion, I used 1/2 a cup of water - it was too much, and never cooked off or absorbed all the way.  I thought I was generous with the seasoning, as we do with most things we cook, but I still found it a little bland.  We might make this again, and next time use tomato sauce as another reviewer suggested in addition to the base ingredients.

Not bad.  I thought it was kind of bland and watery, so I'm not sure I'll make it again, but it was all right for trying something a little different.

To keep the calabicitas from going mushie cook in layers. Meat on the bottom to simmer in the juices, and the vegetables on top and then mixed in with the meat the last 5 mins of cooking. Also use less water. I would also use a broth instead of water for better flavour. I am not a fan of whorchester so I rubbed the meat with chili powder. and simmered the meat with garlic, onion, salt and pepper.

This dish was good. A little to soupy, I just dumped out some of the liquid. I didn't have worchestire, so I used soy sauce and it was still good. Served in tortillas. Everyone ate it all. I had NO leftovers!!!

I'd give this recipe 3-stars if I ever thought I would make it again.  The family thought it was boring.  I thought the Zucchini was wayyyy overcooked and the dish was swimming in water! It tasted just okay.  I felt like I was eating leftovers and could not get over that I actually purchased groceries for this.  Overall it was edible, just not repeatable.

I've been making this dish for years, but with a few adjustments. I use pork chops with the bone and cut into cubes. I cut around the bone and add to the dish for flavor, fry the zucchini a little with the chops, so it is not so mushy. I do not use worchestershire, I use garlic salt, 8 oz of tomato sauce and a tomato flavored bouillion cube. Try with these adjustments and I hope you will be much happier, this really is a great dish and a great way for the little ones to eat zucchini too.

Really good recipe.  I followed it to the T, and it became a bit juicy, but that can just be poured off before serving.  My husband even liked it.

This is a great recipe. Both my picky husband and kids loved it. I used pork chops instead of pork roast and it worked just fine.

Recipe was ok. I did think it would be too bland and added some garlic powder, fajita seasoning and some potatoes. I found the zucchini did go a bit mushy so I think i may cook it a little less. I did cook the poatoes with the pork.

I read all of the reviews, so I made some changes....and we loved this dish!  Added some chipotle powder to add spice and heat, used a beef bouillon cube and the Worcestershire sauce too.  Reduced the water to 1 cup only, no soupy problems here!  Lastly, added a diced tomato at the end.  Served with homemade flour tortillas and another side vegetable...a very nice dinner.

I read the reviews while I made it and added a few tablespoons of tomato paste at the end to thicken the juices left behind. I also added about 2 tablespoons of garlic as well. I love the freshness it had. A great light meal that Iâ€™ll make again!

I liked this pretty well. Hubby not so much. His Mama used to add jalapenos and crumbled up Queso Fresco Mexican cheese. I used chicken bouillon instead of the Worcestershire sauce. To those who think its bland, you might need to add more salt n pepper:)If its too Mushy, don't cook it as long! I just got another batch of zucchini so I might give this a go again. Thanks CThompson76.

pork- good, zucchini- good, corn- good tortillas-good, unfortunately it was extremely bland! Next time I will not put water in, I will use chicken broth, and a good dose of chipolata spice. This was defiantly worth reworking to make it yummier for us! Thanks
