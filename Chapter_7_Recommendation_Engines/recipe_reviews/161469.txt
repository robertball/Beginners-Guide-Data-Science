I made this for my family tonight. I did not cut the boneless, skinless breasts into chunks, I just left them whole. The batter was good, but too salty, and I like salt more than the average Joe. I would cut back to 4 tablespoons of garlic salt. Also, pepper is to taste, and I found it a little too much, as well. Remember, when frying chicken, dip first in the flour mix, then the egg dip, then back into the flour, and the coating will hold tight to the chicken, better than egg first and then flour. My kids, 6 and 7, loved it, but it was too salty.

These were great, much better than any fast food restaurant. I agree, too much flour. If you are feeding 2 like I was, use 2 breasts, 1 cup flour, 1 beaten egg, 3 TBS garlic powder  1 TBS & 1/2 tsp pepper. Will make again and again!

These are delicious but I did make a few changes based on some of the other reviews.  I used 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I also used 2 tablespoons of garlic salt and 2 tablespoons of onion powder instead of all the garlic salt.  This seemed to make the saltiness just right.

These were great! The chicken was very juicy. I whipped them up for dinner in about 15 minutes. I scaled the recipe down for 2, and I think that there was too much flour. I used about half a cup for 2 good sized chicken breasts. Next time I may also add some pepper flakes to the flour mix. Don't worry if you don't have a thermometer, I don't and mine came out perfect! Thank you!

This was good, but I have to admit that I didn't have any garlic salt so I used 6 Tbs garlic powder and I only added 1 Tbs of salt b/c of all the reviews that said it was too salty but clearly there wasn't enough salt. Also I used 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 cups of italian bread crumbs. For a simple recipe this was VERY GOOD. Once everyone added salt to their chicken they gobbled it up. I used 7 large chicken breasts, cut up into strips, and there was plently, even extra, for 9 people and that was with almost everyone going back for 3rds even 4ths. I also did the egg, flour, egg, flour dip like others suggested and I had plently of flour mixture but I needed 4 more eggs for that. The kids LOVED the coating! Also I wish that the recipe said about how long you should fry the chicken but I guess it all depends on the size of chicken you use, after a few trial and errors it took about 6 to 7 mins to completely cook the strips, and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. Next time I will probably try adding some chicken seasoning for alittle more flavoring but even as is it's pretty good. I am definatly making this a regular recipe in our house. THANKS!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed on the turn out. The flour left the chicken very sticky. The taste was good, not great though. It did leave the chicken moist but I couldnâ€™t get past the stickiness of the coating to enjoy it. My boyfriend agreed and we ended up throwing it away. I recommend using bread crumbs instead of the flour. I will not attempt this recipe again.

These chicken nuggets really are the best ever. We are big Chick-fil-a fans and these were definitely comparable. I made Honey Mustard Sauce to go along with it and it was very good too. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used whole wheat flour and it still turned out delicious. Kids ages 5,3 & 1 gobbled it up.

I wish I could give it a 4.5 because it was very tasty, but it was also extremely salty. I saw a previous review pointing that out so I halved the garlis salt and replaced it with garlic powder, and it was still too much for me. If you like things lightly salty, I would recommend reducing it substantially, and adding more to later batches if you need more salt.

Great recipe.  Very easy to make.  My husband loved it.  He said it taste better than fastfood chicken nuggets.  I make this in small portions (serving for two), so i use the seasoning to taste.  I also make double coating(egg and flour) before deep frying.

Good recipe for beginners. We dip our chicken in flour, then egg & lastly panko (which is what we put all the seasonings mentioned in plus some Italian seasoning.) This makes it a little less messy/soggy in my opinion. Letting all the chicken set up after being breaded (5 minutes or so) helps it really stick.

First time making actual fried nuggets, instead of baked. Did the flour-egg-flour dip like other reviewers recommended, replaced some of the garlic salt with Spike seasoning (I've found it is GREAT for breading), and made "Chick-fil-a Sauce" (about 4 parts Ken's Honey Mustard to 1 part hickory smoke BBQ sauce) to go with them. SO said "If you ever need to take a chicken dish to something, don't take this one -- leave it HERE!" :)

I am a southern girl, so I have eaten plenty of fried chicken. I made it for 2 people and didn't have garlic salt. So, I used, 2 breasts, 1 heaping cup flour, 1 tbs each garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I needed 3 eggs to get it all breaded. Make sure you dip the chicken in flour first, then egg, then back in the flour again. Awesome!

These are very tasy, and crispy.  We really enjoyed them.  I did not have the garlic salt, so I had to substitute some all purpose seasoning, but they were still good, because the batter was not too heavy.

These are completely amazing!!! I cut the flour down to 3 cups and there were still leftovers, and I did 4.2 tbs. of garlic salt, but other than that, these were perfect! My 13 year old sister and I wanted to eat the whole batch! :)

Wonderful. The dry-wet-dry coating process makes all the difference. I always leave out the black pepper, because I don't like it, and I add a tablespoon of sugar to the dry breading ingredients which is closer to Chick-Fil-A's recipe.

Made this tonight for dinner. Both children and wife loved it. Mistaken for KFC nuggets. I did use less garlic salt. Added some season all. And I also did the flour egg then flour again. Still the texture was not as heavy as you may imagine. Perfect!! Will make again very soon!

Such a simple and easy recipe to follow.  Its actually quite like I have always made my chicken strips.  The only thing I do differently is dip my chicken in the flour, then the egg and then the flour again.  Gives it a better crust.

These were really good. I like my nuggets sort of spicy so I used some low sodium taco seasoning instead of the garlic salt..I also salted and peppered the chicken before breading. Restaurant quality :) Oh and make sure the nuggets are a nice brown color and they should be cooked through just great! For the person who had 'sticky nuggets' I don't think you fried them long enough...its also important to flour, egg, and flour again :)

SO delicious!  An extremely easy recipe... we were able to throw it together in no time on a weeknight.  The only change I made was to decrease the garlic salt by half, only because we don't like things too salty... but that is THE only change we made to the original recipe.  The chicken was so flavorful and juicy, we will most definitely be making this recipe again!!

The second time I made this I cut the egg, flour, garlic salt and pepper in half and still had a small amount left over after coating the chicken.  I cooked the chicken in 2 tablespoons of oil (per 1 lb. of chicken)...which was just enough to cut down on the fat but keep the chicken from drying out.  This is my go to recipe now for chicken nuggets.  It's so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.

Good standard recipe for fried chicken. A little on the bland side though so maybe using seasoned salt next time and more garlic? These cooked in 7 minutes deep fried. I rarely deep fry anything, but this was great and far better than take out. Not quite KFC or anything, but it beats McD's nuggets and other fast food nuggets and I know what is in them too, plus the satisfaction of making it yourself.

I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 30 minutes then dredged in flour mixture, egg, flour mixture.  This was so good!  My kids, who usually only like Chick fil A nuggets, asked for seconds.  Will definitely use this recipe again on a "not so healthy" night.

Made this using 3 chicken breasts and measured differently: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tbsp garlic salt, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp (or more if you like spicy) cayenne. It came out great!

Let me start off by saying that these were delicious.  As other people have stated, these chicken nuggets are very comparable to Chick-Fil-A's!

I pretty much followed the recipe provided, except that I used only 2c. of flour, 3TBS. of garlic salt, about 1.5TBS. of pepper, and used egg whites rather than eggs.  I still had quite a lot of the flour mixture left over, but all in all, this is an easy and yummy recipe!

Debating between a 3 and 4 stars - this recipe isn't too salty, I find it kind of bland - I just need a little bit more complexity to the taste.  My husband loves it though and requests it, he says it reminds him of Chick fil A's chicken nuggets. Every time I make it, I play with the spices and I'm still not happy with what turns out - but every once in a while to make hubby happy keeps it on the rotation.

These were very, very good.  I changed the servings to 2 and followed the recipe exactly, save for using one extra egg.  I didn't find this too salty at all - the amount of flour really requires that you use this much salt in order to be able to taste it.  Just a great recipe, thanks for sharing.  If it weren't for the deep frying part, I'd make this all the time!!

I made this recipe as a snack for my kids today. My son, Garett, did all the egg work and my daughter, AnnaBelle, did all the flour and seasonings. They absolutely LOVED the process and said that the nuggets were better than Chick-Fil-A...and that's saying a lot! I used a FryDaddy instead of a pot and they still turned out great! Amazing flavor! Thanks for sharing!

I have made these about 4 or 5 times now...
Thank you for the step by step instructions.  I followed another reviewer's advice, and dipped them first in flour, then egg, then flour again.  I also used seasoning salt instead of all the garlic.
My family loves these!

These nuggets turned out GREAT! However, when we made these we only used two cups of flour which still seemed like to much. We also decided to use one less scoop of garlic salt (still plenty salty). For you hot wing fans Recommend after frying the nuggets apply hot sauce to them and re-submerge them for 5 seconds and you will have the perfect hot nuggets! Enjoy!

Yum!!  Made this gluten free as half of those eating were gluten intolerant. After reading other reviews, I took the advice gleaned and dipped the chicken pieces first in potato starch, then into the well beaten eggs (to which I had added a Tb. of water - makes the eggs beat up more thoroughly), then into a combination of potato starch, non GMO corn starch and sea salt and onion powder.  I cooked them in a mix of extra virgin coconut oil and ghee. These turned out the best of any nuggets I have tried to make. I'll be making them again tomorrow night when our daughter and kids come for dinner. Oh, and I used chicken thighs, too, as we all like dark meat better. I used the honey mustard sauce on this site by Chef John (?) and the two together were better than any nuggets and dipping sauce I have ever eaten!

Delicious! The family loved it! I used tenders and double battered them. We made that delicious chicken sandwich, from that place....you know? Hehe I soaked my tenders in pickle juice for a day. Very close to the real thing.

Sorry- as written, the pepper flavour dominates an otherwise bland dish. If you read the reviews here, most people rating 4 or 5 stars are adding a lot more spices and breadcrumbs. If people would rate this recipe as written, I think the ratings would be MUCH lower.

Great Recipe. The chicken was juicy. Instead of garlic salt I added garlic powder and Lawry's seasoning, and I dipped the chicken in flour first before the eggs then flour again. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  But I did make two alterations; I cut the salt in half and the pepper too.  I also used fresh chicken tenders so they were like chicken strips.

4 Stars because it is *extremely* salty as written.    The second time I made this, I reduced the garlic salt to 4 Tablespoons (for the full 8 servings) and it was much better; however it's still not exactly what I'm looking for in the perfect chicken nugget.  I will continue on my search. :)

These were pretty nice, thanks for sharing Nichole!   I didn't have breasts on hand, so I used Back and Leg pieces that I de-boned and skinned. Came out very nice - crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   I used my Gas Grill's side burner to fry on outside, that way the house doesn't end up smelling like a chicken joint!

I just finished making this recipe and I absolutely loved it!!!  I am away teaching in China in a very small city so to be able to make something that feels like home is always an incredible find!  I ended up adding garlic powder instead of the garlic salt because I wanted to add some seasoning salt and I didn't want it to end up too salty (I didn't really measure anything...I just shook the spices until I felt there was enough in the flour).  I also added a few shakes of onion salt just because I love the flavor that it adds to any dish.  The chicken was out of this world...so tender and moist!!  I am still amazed at how moist the chicken was and how all of the flavors blended together fabulously!  I will for sure be making this recipe again and again...even back in America!

I cut the garlic salt back by half as other reviewers suggested, but it was not salty enough for me...maybe next time I will cut it back 1/4 instead.

Holy salt,batman! Phew, could 6 Tbsp garlic salt be right?!? I made the recipe as written, but I could use 1/4 of that much salty flavor. My kids loved it, so I guess I'll make it again......with less salt. Thanks for the recommendation for they honey mustard recipe from this site, it was an excellent dressing for these nuggets.

I just made this for my family and they all loved it. 

I used 2 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons of garlic salt, 1Â½ tablespoons of pepper and repeated the egg/flour step. 

I used seven boneless skinless chicken thighs and it was fabulous. 

Thanks so much!!!

I used about 2.5 cups of flour, for I only used 2 large boneless breasts.. I didn't use too much garlic salt, though I used McCormick's garlic seasoning for grilling that my picky son likes. Came out great, nice and crunchy and reminds me of popcorn chicken. :)

This recipe is a keeper!   I followed the advice of a previous reviewer to flour chicken first, dip in egg, flour again, before cooking I put the nuggets in the refrigerator for about 30min so the flour would stick to the nuggets better.    After cooking they were crispy and delicious, Thanks Nichole for a great recipe!

I used rice flour for the initial coating, stirred some basil into the egg, used Panko crumbs for the final coat of breading, let them dry on a rack for about 20 minutes before frying in 350 degree peanut oil in my deep fryer. I cooked for 2 or 2 and a half minutes each side and turned once during frying. They were very good, and all gone (which is the highest rating in this household).

These are pretty close to "the best ever chicken nuggets."  The texture was PERFECT!  I rolled in flour mix, dipped in egg and then recoated in flour mix.  I did have a bit extra flour mix left to throw out.  My only complaint is that they had a tad powdered garlic flavor and were a touch too salty.

Just okay... Nothing special. Added red pepper flakes to give it a little zip. Had a few plain and ended up dipping them in hot sauce and melted butter. I'll keep looking for a go to recipe.

Awesome! Love love loved it with less salt and some revisions to make it gluten free and did not use garlic salt, but rather sea salt and garlic powder because that is what I had, but the concept was the same.

I love making these chicken nuggets, however I only gave it 3 stars b/c I have only made it step by step only a couple of times and have changed it to suit my tastes. I feel like the original recipe is really salty for me so I changed to amt of garlic salt and the amt of pepper since I feel like it was really peppery. Overall, I'm glad I stumbled upon this recipe! Also, dip in flour, then egg, then flour again. Makes the flour mixture stick better and makes them crispier.

Delicious! Cut the recipe in half and used 4 "thin-sliced breast fillets" and had a little mixture leftover. We ate almost all of the nuggets in one sitting! :)

I needed to get rid of a bag of frozen chicken breasts and I also wanted to try out a bottle of Panda Express orange chicken sauce that I had purchased at Costo. I followed the recipe exactly, thawed the chicken, and made sure to pat the meat dry with a paper towel to prevent a gooey coating.  The nuggets were beautiful!  A bit salty, I'll back off on the garlic salt to probably 4 Tbsp next time. I also added sesame seeds and crushed red chili peppers to my sauce and tossed in the fried chicken nuggets, then served over steamed Japanese rice w/a side of steamed Asian mix vegetables. Not bad!  I would rather serve these nuggets to my 3 y/o rather than the soggy processed frozen stuff any day!  Another plus to this recipe is that there are FEW ingredients!  No running to the store for extra items.  I also sifted the unused flour coating, and placed in the freezer for next time. Hopefully I don't ruin it but if so, no big deal b/c this was not expensive to make.

This recipe was good but too salty, perhaps use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and use and a tablespoon or two of salt. Also the suggestion of using dipping it in the flour mixture, the eggs and then back into the flour was excellent.

Good with slight tweaks.  I made two servings so I used only 1Tablespoon garlic salt and am not much of a pepper fan so only 1 teaspoon of pepper.  I also used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup italian breadcrumbs.  I double bread by dipping in egg, then flour mix and let rest 2 minutes, then dip in breadcrumbs again.  Gives me a good coating without overwhelming the chicken.  I then refrigerated for 2 hours covered on a cookie sheet.  Refrigerating your coated chicken before frying helps the coating fry up crispier.  Also ,my chicken breasts were thin sliced so I cooked for 3 - 4 minutes. Crispy, juicy and perfect.

These were outstanding!  I dredged the chicken in egg first, then flour, egg again and then again in flour.  They turned out very crispy and the breading stayed on very well.  My hubby said they were as good as a restaurant.  I made honey mustard sauce from this site to go with them.

These were awesome. I accidentally used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and they were so good my daughter who rarely likes what I make came back for seconds. I will definitely do these again! Thank you.

These were very easy. I changed the recipe a bit because I was cooking for 2 people. I used 4 frozen chicken tenders and cut them nugget size. I used 1 cup of flour, 2 eggs, 1 tbsp. garlic salt, and pepper. I also added 1 tbsp. or paprika to the flour mixture. I also followed advice from other reviews and double dipped the chicken in eggs and flour mixture. We dipped them in O'Charley's Honey Mustard sauce and they were absolutely perfect! Thanks for the recipe!
NOTE: I just made these again and added a few more spices which I think made this recipe even better! In addition to the garlic salt and paprika I added before, I also added in garlic powder, onion powder, creole seasoning and ranch seasoning. It was FANTASTIC!

I've made these 3 times now, the first time exactly as it is written here. My family loved them and they were devoured almost as soon as they were done. But I am keeping a close eye on our fat intake so the second time I baked them. Good, but there was quite a bit of flour remaining on each strip. It didn't affect the taste but since everyone eats with their eyes first, I knew I had to find a healthier, more eye-appealing way to serve these up. So, most recently I dredged each tender in the flour first, then moistened in the egg, and dredged with the flour again, and the excess shaken off.  I cooked them in our air fryer and they were perfection. Homemade honey mustard on the side with a mixed green salad and it was one of our favorite, easy-to-do lunches.

Big hit. Both my husband and my kids bbn liked them. Wasn't sure if they were cooked all the thru at first. But once they get to that nice brown toast color of chicken strips or nuggets they are usually done all the way thru.

I loved this recipe. I made using 2 breasts. Since I didn't have garlic salt, I used garlic powder, onion powder, and pink Himalayan salt. The chicken was so juicy and my 6 year old loved them!

Delicious!  Kids love chik fil a and I can finally come close myself. Iâ€™d agree as is this is too salty and I like salt. Suggest cutting out 1/2 tbsp or maybe more. Will have to experiment myself. I cut the pepper down to 1tbsp. Tried boneless skinless chicken thighs the second time but breast is more successful. Thighs have a lot of fat and itâ€™s almost impossible to cut it all off.  I used canola oil. The first time a lot of extra flour mixture ended up in the oil so it browned by the time I got the last batch in. Need to be careful to shake excess off as recipe states. Going from egg to flour to oil worked fine for me.

Made this recipe last week out of chicken tenderloins since that's all I had. followed the recipe and a few suggestions in the comments. i coated the chicken in flour first, then egg, then back into the flour before frying. I ran low on flour and added corn meal and WOWZA there were none left after dinner! great recipe, definitely adding to the old cook book

This was quite good though you DO NOT need four cups of flour to coat. I took a hunch and two cups was plenty with some left over. I also added paprika to the flour.

Omg - this was amazing, simple and the crispiest chicken I have ever made! I battered twice which I think helped, reduced the salt by half and added a handful of seasoned panko. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

My children wanted to try this recipe after seeing it featured on Evantube HD. They loved them! However, I did not have garlic salt, so added 3 of salt and 3 of garlic powder instead. Well worth the prep time and fun to have my kids help with.  The coating worked great and turned out nice and golden and crispy. The inside was delicious and juicy. DEFINITELY the BEST EVER!

This was okay. I had to double the salt and pepper for any flavor, and ended up using 6 eggs. I learned that without coating in flour, then egg, then flour, it won't get a crispy coating. All in all, it was okay.

I'm pretty sure I used about half the garlic salt and less flour. I estimated the amounts based on what looked right to me. They were a huge hit! I used our deep fryer and corn oil. My hubby said they beat KFC hands down!

Replaced 1/2 cup of flour with gluten free bread crumbs. And split the garlic salt portion using garlic powder for half to cut down salt. It was awesome. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very good recipe.  The kids all enjoyed it, even my daughter that doesn't usually like chicken nuggets.  I did have a lot of the flour mixture left over.

Ill wind up tweaking it a little for personal preference, but it turned out really well. The whole family liked it. Go ahead and make it. Like others have pointed out, dip the chicken in flour first, then the egg, then back in the flour.

Good recipe. Kid friendly, easy to make and tasty! My son loved it because they were less salty than chick fil a nuggets he said. I used garlic powder in stead of garlic salt and added salt to taste.

I will probably make it again, my family loved it. I used 3 tablespoons garlic powder and 1/2 tablespoon onion powder, along with 2 tablespoons salt and pepper. I made homemade honey mustard with it also. I used 3 chicken breasts and 2 cups of flour, and dipped the chicken in the flour, egg, then flour again. It served 5 people, going back for seconds.

Was looking for a chicken nugget recipe.  As always, read the reviews before making.  Just two of us, so cut up 2 very large chicken breasts and cut the flour mixture in half.  Used 3 TBS of garlic powder, black pepper, several grinds of sea salt, and probably 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Did the flour - egg- flour dip per other reviews and let it sit for 20 minutes.  Deep fryer at 375 for 5-6 minutes and it was outstanding!!  

Wife found them pretty zippy from the cayenne, and I could taste the garlic powder.

No doubt will make again.  Loved the breading.... nice and crispy.

I made this recipe as is and I made a batch using salt (to taste) in place of half the garlic salt because my husband and kids don't care for garlic much. But, they all preferred this recipe exactly as written with the full amount of garlic salt. It's a keeper. Thanks

My kids, 5 and 7, loved this. It was easy to make. Next time I might try baking them, but fried they were delicious. I followed one of the other reviewers recommendations for halving the recipe. Might add 2 tb of garlic salt rather than 3. Or maybe 2.5 TB.

Really basic but great! If you are looking for good chicken tenders / strips / nuggets, this is perfect. My family loved it. I am not one to cook in this much oil, so I needed some guidance and this was a great recipe. Thanks!

Even after cutting the garlic salt in half it was still too salty for most people. If you cooked it in hot oil the flour coating was crispy! I did change the recipe quite a bit by using a mustard egg dip instead of plain egg. Flour, dip, flour. Cook medium high for about 7 minutes.

Using tips from other reviewers, I got good results with this recipe. What I did differently from the recipe was I scaled back to two chicken breasts and, in addition to the seasonings here, added a little paprika, onion powder, basil, and oregano, while also scaling back on the salt. Coating the chicken in flour first helps the egg to stick (so flour, egg, then a second time in flour) and produces a better batter. The second round of flour coating needs to be thorough (but not thick) to produce a good crust (not too thin or hard). This is the first time my son liked my attempt at chicken nuggets, so it was a win-win lunch for us!

Turned out excellent! I used the tip of dipping in flour then egg, then flour again and while it's messy, it does keep the breading on the chicken. Easy and yummy!

I really liked this recipe. Simple and tasty. I decided to cut the recipe in half for 3 good sized chicken breasts.
Of course, I ran out of garlic salt, so I had to mix 3 parts salt to 1 part garlic powder to make enough of the garlic salt for the recipe. I fried up the first few pieces, and it just didn't seem like enough breaking on the chicken for my taste, so I chose to do a double wash on the egg and flour. The picture shows the chicken after the double coating.
Would definitely make this recipe again. In the future I may try a buttermilk and egg wash for a slightly different flavor.
Thanks Nichole for the recipe!

These are awesome, but I did take BHLLAL's advice and added bread crumbs with less flour.  My teenager and his friends love them!  One of my son's friends had a friendly arguement over whether I'd bought them from Chick-Fil-A or made them myself.  I won!

These chicken nuggets are very good, not amazingly great. I cut the recipe in half since I was cooking for 2 and there was a lot of flour left over.  I cut my chicken into 1 inch pieces and fried them for about 3 minutes on each side. The chicken was juicy and the outside was nice & crispy. I wish the breading was more flavorful, but we dipped ours in ketchup and ranch so that did the trick!

Absolutely fantastic!  As per other reviews, I did a half-and-half flour to bread crumbs alteration and also double breaded the nuggets.  (Egg, flour, back to egg, then back to flour.)  

For those reviews that continue to compare these to Chick-fil-A's nuggets, I can tell you they double bread their's as well (I worked there for 4 years.)

I use this recipes to make chicken tenders. I love it! make suere to double dip: dip the chicken as directed in the egg then the flour, then do it again. This helps give it a restaurant style finish.

Very easy to make and the chicken turned out perfect. I cut the flour and eggs in half since I only use 2 chicken breasts and it left enough flour for all pieces to be coated evenly. Turned out amazing.

I'd give these a 5.  The rest of my family found them way too peppery.   They liked the recipe much better when I replaced most of the pepper with 2TB onion powder and 1TB paprika.

Quick and easy! My kids loved 'em.  I made a smaller batch - using about a cup or so of flower and a cup of bread crumbs... 1/2 and 1/2 garlic salt and garlic powder and a little less pepper.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe when I was looking for an easy, home-made dinner. I had some leftover chicken, and some extra breadcrumbs in the pantry so this was perfect! It was so easy, took no time at all. I didn't have any garlic salt so I used half salt and half garlic powder. PERFECT RECIPE!

These were good, but not great.  Maybe if I cut the chunks of chicken into bigger pieces, they would have been better.  It took us a while to get the cooking time down.  8-9 minutes per batch.  The onion rings I made with these were MUCH MUCH MUCH better!

I had thawed chicken breast for dinner, but my family said they just wanted a snack. I decided to try these, and they were perfect. Since there are only 3 of us, I did 2 breasts and used 1/4 of each of the ingredients. I ended up needing two eggs, but otherwise the proportions were just fine.

Made this for my boyfriend who loves fried chicken. It was a huge hit, he asked if I could label it as a favorite! Will definitely make again. I halved the flour mixture since I was only making it for two and had a ton of flour left over. Be careful not to overcook in the oil.

Not a complete waste of time but bland. This is one of the blandest recipes I have tried. I saved it by smothering them with a lovely honey mustard sauce I found here.

Once again I failed to go over reviews and got caught. It was too salty, will make again but next time with less garlic salt. We used the jalapeno popper spread to dip them in and we loved that combo.

Very good! I've never fried chicken before, so this was certainly a pleasant surprise. The only things I did different was that I didn't have garlic salt handy, so I put in about 2 tblsp. of salt (into one cup of flour, I was follow the conversion to 2 servings), and diced 1 large clove of garlic, mixing that in with the egg. So yummy!

Very good! After reading the reviews I decided to try dipping in egg then flour first and then flour,egg, flour. The only difference was the thickness of the crust. I liked the thicker better. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Eyeballed the amount of spices so not to put to much. The second time I made them as chick fillet sandwiches instead of nuggets also good. Thank You for posting this recipee.

Not too shabby.  I agree that it's kind of like chic-fil-a, but better.  Adding 1 cup breadcrumbs made it really good.  I also agree that there was too much flour.  I used 1tbsp garlic powder w/ 3tbsp sea salt instead of 4tbsp garlic salt.  I'll be making it again!

These weren't just like chik-fil-a (which is why I tried them) but they were really good. I thought the amount of garlic salt would be overpowering, but it wasn't that noticeable to us.  I served them with Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site. Thanks for a great recipe...these will be our Happy Meal from now on.

Delicious! I made them exactly the way the recipe stated. I wouldn't change a thing. Even my picky 7 year old ate them!
