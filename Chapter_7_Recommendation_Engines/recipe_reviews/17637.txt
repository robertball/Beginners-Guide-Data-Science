This is one of the best Pineapple Cake's I have ever made. I didn't make any adjustments. It was moist and delicious. It will be in my favorite cake recipes and I will be making it again.

Very good pineapple cake recipe!  It is heavy and moist and very good.  Try it as a layer cake with Pineapple Filling from this website.  Delicious!

A very simple and nice cake that I made for a family cookout. It got rave reviews.  The combination of pineapple, nuts and coconuts made it very interesting. For my taste, it was a little heavy but I definitely would maje it again.

Excellent cake, but way too much sugar! Half of the amount is sufficient for my taste. I also used half whole wheat flour to sneak in a little extra goodness. It already has no salt or oil, so reducing the sugar and adding whole wheat flour makes this a delicious and healthy treat.

This cake turned out quite dry from what I expected.  I don't think I'll try it again.  It might have potential for a breakfast cake for those who like not-so-sweet cakes with coffee.

It's actually good! Mixed reviews and comments describing to whom it was served gave me pause, but it seemed the most straightforward of recipes not requiring a cast iron skillet.  Followed recipe to the letter, which is only fair if one is going to rate the recipe, and it turned out PERFECTLY.  A healthier version would push my rating to a 5.

I made this cake tonight and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I do not eat dairy so I used flax meal as a substitute for the eggs. I also added a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, and butter extract. This cake is easy and tasty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This cake just did not turn out good. I skipped the walnuts because I didn't have any but stayed true to the rest of the recipe. First of all, it wasn't sweet enough, which really isn't that big a problem for me because the frosting would have sweetened it up. But the cake also left a bad taste in my mouth which I'm assuming is from the baking soda. Not a recipe I'd recommend.

Very popular with the hub.  Used fresh pineapple (coarsely chopped) otherwise followed cake recipe exactly.  For icing, eliminated butter and sugar.  Sweetened with some agave nectar and added lemon extract.  I'm sure he'll be requesting this again.

I agree too much sugar.  I did 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup fine sugar.  I added 1 cup of flaked coconut and 1 cup chopped walnut.  Also, two pats of butter and 1 Tbsp of Vanilla.  It was moist and delicious with just a bit of powdered sugar on top.

I was a little hesitant as the recipe did not ask for butter/oil but to my surprise it was moist and delicious!! Wow...wouldn't change the recipe at all.  I did use another cream cheese frosting but the cake was a 10/10

Loved this recipe!  Very easy to do.  Stays moist.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, though.  Took it to work as a "Pina Colada Cake" and it was well received.  Can also be done as muffins/cupcakes.  Freezes well.

Normally I don't like pineapple (it's a texture issue), but this pineapple cake is delicious!  I made cupcakes and frosted them with cherry cream cheese frosting.  
The only thing I did differently is that I omitted the walnuts.  I baked these for my stepdad's birthday, and I'm not entirely sure if he likes nuts.
In regards to another comment, I didn't find this a dry cake at all.

Enjoyed the cake. Like LolitaGDL, I used whole wheat flour and then I substituted a can of cream of coconut instead of flaked coconut. Gave it a nice heavy carrot cake like texture and kept the cake moist.
