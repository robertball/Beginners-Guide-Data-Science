I thought it was O.K., but kinda bland.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

Really good if you really love spinach. Honestly, I couldn't taste the beets at all, but I am one of those who enjoys spinach, so it was fine. And I don't know of it's me or my blender, but this did not turn out "smooth" for me. Didn't affect flavor, of course. I liked this as a healthy option.
