I liked the interesting spin of adding brown sugar to make a sweet and salty appetizer. For ease, I used the bake function on my air fryer and they are done in 5-7 minutes per tray. The dip, no one really cared for. I think more of a spicy mustard would have been better. This dip tasted more like mayo. I will more likely make the sausage with brown sugar again though for an easy appetizer. Ty, so much.

I cut the recipe back quite a way for just the two of us.  This was really a delicious little snack!  I agree with someone else who said that when football season comes along again that this will be a perfect appy to serve!  I think next time I will turn up the oven heat because I would have liked for a little more "burn" to the sausage, though one can't argue with what we had tonight.  With the little leftover sauce, I coated my chicken tenders, dipped them with crushed Rice Krispies and then fried them in butter and olive oil.  So what a wonderful evening!  Thanks, Hillshire Farms!

Delicious. I made the mistake of not reading the recipe completely before I started and consequently  I added the brown sugar to the honey mustard sauce.  Great mistake! The sauce was so tasty and very reminiscent of the sauce from that famous chicken restaurant. I went ahead and still added more brown sugar to my sausage. Great afternoon snack.Will make this again.

I made these for my husband to enjoy after eating off and on all day. They were filling for him and he loved the dipping sauce. Next time we may cut down on the mustard a tad but otherwise, perfect. Love the brown sugar topping, too!

You can’t go wrong with a super tasty and easy snack! A great combination of sweetness from the sauce and the smokiness of the sausage. My husband and kids couldn’t get enough!

Fun way snack or appetizer to please all!  The honey mustard was a perfect balance to even out the slightly sweet glaze that forms on the sausage.  I did broil for just a minute or two to get a little more cartelized texture.  Next time I will sprinkle a little cayenne on the sausages to give them a kick.  Super easy snack and could always have the ingredients on hand if you keep the sausage in your freezer for those times friends pop in.

3.2.20  What a simple, tasty, and quick and easy snack.  I’ve used Hillshire Farm® Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage  (50% less fat) for years, and that’s what I used for this recipe.  I spread a sheet of foil out on the baking pan, so cleanup for this recipe also was a breeze.  Next time, I’ll cut the sausage just a bit thicker and take out of the oven at 18 minutes (personal taste preference).  When football season is in full swing, I can see this as a go-to game day snack.  You could make the dipping sauce the day before, cut up additional sausage and store in a zip-top bag, and then when you need more, it’ll be so easy to make another batch.   Not only was the sausage delicious, the honey mustard sauce was the perfect partner and strong enough to stand on its own for so many other dishes.  This one’s a keeper for sure.

Turned out great. Even my better-half loved it. We had a second and third go at it in three days. Had a visitor on the second day (my wife's sister) and she also loved it. A great snack it seems for everyone.

I made the sauce as written, it was very good. I did not prepare the sausage as written. I cut in in half and grilled it until hot and browned. We had this for dinner, Served it with baked beans. Will make it again the same way.
