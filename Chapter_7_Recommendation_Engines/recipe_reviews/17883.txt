I'm rating this 4.5. I added more honey based on other reviews and I also added vital wheat gluten. I halved the recipe b/c 9 cups seemed like so much and I was still able to get 2 good sized loaves. I used 3 cups bread flour and 1.5 cups of wheat flour. The kids liked this more than my all wheat bread recipe. Thanks. This is a keeper.

Hello fellow SCA!!!  Good recipe for crew though I have made this basic recipe, I  use whole wheat flour for half of the bread flour called for in this recipe.  For added nutrition, I also add  2 tablespoons of flax seeds, and my crew gobbles this stuff. Yum!

this was nice as a white bread. i halved the mixture so i could make jst one loaf in my bread machine and i reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon as i thought 2 tablespoons was a bit much. i couldnt taste the honey at all though, not sure if you're actually supposed to. if i were to make this again i would double the honey so that i might be able to taste it

Since the submitter encourages the addition and substitution of ingredients, I elected to use eggs and milk in this recipe. I halved the recipe. I dropped one egg into my measuring cup and added enough warm milk to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It's not exactly a complaint, but this made one HUGE loaf of bread. My kids loved this bread and I will make it again. I will probably make smaller loaves in 8X4 bread pans the next time. Thanks for a tasty and versatile recipe!

I followed your basic recipe to suit and was excited.  This was my first "loaf" bread I have made.  It smelled incredible and was delicious, fresh out of the oven with some butter.  At the same time, the flavor isn't that great after a day or two.  A pretty solid recipe overall.  Thanks!

This is a great bread. I use 1 cup ground flax, 1 cup wheat germ, 1 1/2 cup oats, 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten, 1 cup sprouted wheat flour, 4 cups bread flour. It makes a nice loaf with a lot of interesting textures, and it makes awesome toast for peanut butter. It is honestly one of the more forgiving recipes for bread, so you can happily add or change things. Iâ€™ve also tossed in sunflower seeds, slivered almonds, ground walnuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and flax seeds for that added crunchiness. It is a great recipe written as is, but you honestly can add a ton of different things and make it unique to your own taste. I always try the original recipe with no changes, and it was a very good bread. I took it to heart when they said substitutions and have went nuts with variations! Thank you so much for this tasty, healthy, delicious, versatile recipe!
