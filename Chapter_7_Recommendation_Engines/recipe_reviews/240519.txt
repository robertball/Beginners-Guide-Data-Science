These was so delish! I left off the toffee chips because the BF don't like toffee I also added the chocolate chips to the batter instead of the caramels. I tend to have a bad issues with them always ending up on the bottom of the pan. Then scrapping them out and having holes in the bottom of the brownies. Now this may not happen just letting you know why I swapped the chocolate chips for the caramels on top before baking. Then added a extra drizzle of caramel on top with the pretzels. I will be making these again!

Turned out fabulous. I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used leftover Christmas candy (chopped in a food processor). I also used caramel topping instead of caramels.

So good, even though I stuck with just the caramel and pretzel topping. The additional caramels inside and toffee bits on top, would have been way too sweet. I kept an additional box of brownies on hand, and used the rest of the caramels on a second batch. We preferred it drizzled on top, not as a thick icing so I adjusted the caramel portion in half.

I made these for a church event, and they were a big hit.  They turned out more like fudge than brownies, probably because I used caramel ice cream topping instead of unwrapping caramel candies.  I didn't have any toffee bits, and didn't miss them.  In fact, I think they might have been too sweet if I'd used them.

OMG! These were  amazing!! I ended up incorporating mini chocolate chips into the batter before baking instead of on top as directed -  only because I misread the recipe. Will definitely make again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

Oh man, are these yummy and rich!  A little difficult to cut into squares with the caramel cooked in and I am thinking it doesn't need it with the caramel topping.  The combination of salty and sweet is divine.  Even my husband loved them and he is typically not a dessert kind of guy.

Happy decadence!  Have to send to hubby's office to save myself.  Made half caramel topping, sweet enough.  Would not put caramel pieces in brownie batter next time.
