got an enthusiastic thumbs up from my kids who ate them 5 minutes out of the oven.  The only change I made was using regular salt instead of kosher.  This was super easy and quick to make and with 6 kids hungry all the time, it will be nice to make these in about 30 minutes.

I greatly appreciated the thorough instructions on this recipe.  However, these crackers desperately need oil IN the dough, not just an "anointing" after baking. Following the directions exactly as written produced a kettle cooked potato chip like consistency instead of the familiar crisp-flaky matzo.  After checking several Kosher recipes online, I'll be making these with the oil mixed into the flour in the future.

Knowing that this is Karaite-style matzah instead of Rabbinate-style matzah, I now know (despite that I took longer sometimes, and partly due to that I'm disabled and did not see the pictures before) that I made the matzah correctly and feel more comforted.

After I rolled to eight inches they were paper thin (as the instructions said they would be). At two minutes per side they were just cooked. I did two minutes the first side and 3 minutes the second side.

Easy to understand and execute.   In using this recipe with standard white flour I have discovered that I prefer whole wheat flour.  To me it has better taste.  So I also discovered the the type of ready-made matzah crackers as well.  I did find the time limit for Passover compliant matzah to be attainable on my first try.   Unfortunately, some my matzah then morphed into Matzah Pizza with cheese and pepperoni added on the re-bake.  This was certainly tasty, but may not be allow Passover.

Made it tonight! It is great!  My family devoured them.   I had some price shock when buying the Matzah box of crackers, nearly five dollars!
The ingredients listed:  wheat flour, water, salt.   Now I am excited to make onion with onion powder, or maybe some fresh chives, cheese...possibilities are endless!   Whoo hoo!

This is really good, tastes like bakes chips or crackers. Super exhausting to make with all the rolling... I made two batches and was hot and tired when I finally finished 2 hours later...

Delicious. however, these are pretty bland, adding spices or using the matzah like craker with dips are good to. but, these are just as good with out any additions, just more plain.

The ingredients work fine, but what puts this recipe over the top is the explicit instructions. I've baked a lot, but matzoh is thin and has these very specific parameters--you did a great job walking me through the process until I got a feel for how to do it. Thanks!!

These were easy to make and tasted great.  I started making these on my pizelle maker but because I had to make 80 servings for a Seder (passover) meal, I also used our oven to quicken the process.  There were less bubbles formed in the matzah made in the pizelle than the oven baked versions.  Would like to try adding other seasonings on these next time for variety.

I love this recipe! It's better than Hard Tack! It is also easier to make than hard tack. Though, I wonder if the addition of oil will reduce its shelf time? Can I just omit the oil and have a very thin version of hard tack?

I made this for Passover this year, because our local grocery store was out of Kosher Matzah in the box. What a wonderful experience! Goodbye hard, bland crackers! This is crisp, fresh, and can be adjusted to your family's tastes. I will never buy boxed Matzah again!

It turned out really well, I attempted to make it kosher but I waited on the oven for too long. Most definitely will make again. Will be perfect for school lunches.

I have used this recipe a number of times now, but I perfer to divide the dough into only four loaves of the stated diameter instead of the noted eight, and I bake them in a hot, non-greased, covered, cast iron skillet for 2-2 1/2 minutes per side. Doing so results in four soft, pliable loaves suitible for folding or rolling up. The bread is soft and chewy, and, of course, delicious!

Recipe worked great! I rolled the dough as thin as I could and was pleased with the results. I can't buy matzo locally, but it's ready and quick to make at home ;)

Didn't read the instructions properly, so ended up with 1 large pancake, which I will use for a pizza crust.

Made it. Tasty! Love the simplicity! Very easy, and the minimal time it DOES take, is very relaxing and makes it feel like it is made with LOVE.
