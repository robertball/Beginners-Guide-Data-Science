This recipe is wonderful, but you can take it to another level by increasing ingredients and cooking it in your crockpot over night.  Increase potatoes to 32oz bag (cubed hashbrowns), 12 eggs, 3 cups shredded cheese, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper and 1 cup or more of ham, sausage, bacon, canadian bacon, any combination you want.  Cook in your slow cooker for 10 to 12 hours.  You can add just about anything to this recipe and it is done when you wake up in the morning.  The Smart Crockpot cooks too hot, so if using this cooker, reduce cooking time.

We made this last weekend with a few modifications and other reviewers' suggestions.  I browned the hash browns in some butter with the green onions, fresh garlic and cut-up bacon.  I put this in the bottom of the pan and poured the egg mixture on top (added some Lawry's Seasoned Salt to the egg mixture, too).  I also used Kraft Mexican cheese with peppers in place of the cheddar.  It was fantastic - got rave reviews from my family - even the picky eaters!

This is my favorite "quickie" breakfast! I do change it up a bit. I add 1 cup of chopped spinach. I also take canned flaky biscuits and press them into muffin tins. Fill with the mixture and bake. When done, I let them cool, then package individually in quart freezer bags. Then I have breakfast muffins ready to go at a moments notice! YUMMY!!!!

Glad that you are enjoying my recipe.Thanks for all reviews! Some of you are right this is a basic recipe...as it was meant to be. BUT, it is a starting point as all recipes are for you to tweak to your own taste. We (my family) as I was growing up used this, adding many variations to it. My father loved spicy & hot -- so he used hot sausage and bacon/ adding 1 cup of diced each red peppers and green peppers that he lightly sauted first. We also served it with mushrooms, spinach, water chestnuts and also added lots of ham. Get creative -- make it to suit yourself and your family. Sometimes I just like it the basic recipe eating it with crousants or toast, OJ and some kind of fresh fruit..I hope you enjoy!

This was pretty bland and dry.  I made it again and browned the hash browns in butter with a little oil adding garlic salt and pepper.  I put the hash browns on the bottom of the baking dish, combined the remaining ingredients adding salt and pepper to taste and then poured over the hash browns.  It had more taste and using the hash browns as a 'crust' with the butter added seemed to really help with the dryness.

This was great with my alterations taken from other reviewers.  I sauteed the hashbrowns with the white of the green onion, fresh garlic, seasoned salt, salt, pepper and butter and put in the bottom of the pan.  I used ham AND bacon and some dry mustard in with the egg, green onion and cheese mixture. Looked beautiful and tasted great - lots of flavor!! Made it this morning for Father's Day and my husband and children loved it!

My family loved this - especially my daughter who normally does not like "mixed" food. I modified it by cutting up the bacon in the frying pan with half an white onion chopped. I took out the onion and bacon but left in the grease and added a little more oil, browning the shredded hash browns until golden outside. I added about 8 slices of deli ham to the bowl and mixed together the onion, meats and browned potatoes, adding dried parsley and S&P. I also added dry mustard and about five shots of hot sauce to the egg mixture. I spread the potato/meat mixture in a greased casserole dish, spread cheese over this and then poured the egg mix over all. Baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees then turned off heat and left it in for another 5 minutes so it would stay tender. I put the little bit of leftovers in the fridge to heat for one more before-school breakfast. I also think this would work for the leftovers to be chopped up and heated, put in warm tortillas and topped with salsa and some more cheese.

Great recipe!  You can mix it all up the night before and bake in the morning, add 5-10 minutes extra baking time.  It also freezes well (uncooked).  Thaw in fridge and bake- again give extra baking time.  I usually use whatever breakfast meat and cheese I have on hand to make it.

This was a great dish.  I made it for a Church Brunch. I doubled the recipe and needed to increase the cook time by 30-45 min.  It turned out wonderful and people even asked for the recipe.  Thanks

What a great base recipe! It really does taste like what you add, I've made this several times and get raves from everyone who tries it and recipe requests. I cook the bacon, then brown the hash browns in the bacon grease-that makes a huge difference. I use southwest style hash browns and that helps the flavor as well. I mix the bacon, onions and cheese in with the eggs, add salt and pepper and whatever other spices I feel like, and use the hash browns as a crust. There's never a single bite left and everyone loves it! Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!  I did go over the reviews and proceeded with the little adjustments... Made sure to season the potato layer with some seasoning salt and melted butter in the roasting pan and pre-baked to crisp the hashbrowns before adding the egg mixture.  There was so much hashbrowns for me to crisp them on the stove would've been super hard to do so I did it in a hot oven spread out in the large roasting pans and it browned nicely.  I multiplied this for 32 eggs (two roasting pans) to feed a large crowd and I had many ask me for the recipe and go back for seconds and thirds... Please make sure you also season your eggs.  I find that the cheese does add some saltiness but not enough so I used my extra accurate method of 2 salt shakes per egg (yes I counted out that many shakes lol) and it was perfect! Even my picky hubby loved it. We used bacon as the meat, that I cooked prior to adding to the top layer (instead of mixing in with the eggs) so it would show up nicely on the top.  I reduced the amount of green onion(one bunch is maybe 1/2 cup split between the two pans) per our flavor preference and it worked out wonderfully.  Baked very quickly once I added the egg mixture.

This tasted really good! Just remember to mix in a few shakes of salt and pepper. Instead of bacon, I used about 1/3 lb. cooked lean sausage, so maybe with bacon you may not need as much salt. I also diced up about 1/2 c. total of red and orange peppers and mixed those in. Used 6 extra large eggs, and can't imagine using less because it was more potatoey than eggy! I didn't thaw my hashbrowns first so it took about an hour to cook, but it was worth the wait! We had it for dinner and I think I'll put it on my monthly rotation.

I think I found the solution to anyone that thinks the hash brown bottom is too plain.  I found and used the Ore Ida's cubed hash browns with green and red pepper in them. I fried these up beforehand with the green onions.  Used Lawry's as well and really this gave the bottom a nice taste.  It was a bit salty but nothing overly done.  Good recipe, definitely a keeper.

This was truly a desperation dinner for me, as I realized I did not have 2 of the 6 ingredients! I subbed cottage cheese and a little water for the milk, and dried minced onion for the green onion. It still turned out great! I read the reviews ahead of time and added salt and pepper. I also didn't have a 7x11 pan so I used a 9x13 and baked for about 35 minutes. Highly recommended.

This is an absolute wonderful recipe.  I added well-drained frozen spinach, and frozen chopped broccoli that I thawed in hot water and patted dry.  Because of the additional vegetables I added two more eggs and little more milk and it was perfect.  I took it to a brunch and people walked up and said how great it was and asked for the recipe.  This is a real keeper and thank you for sharing, Ann.

Made this for brunch and it disappeared!  I would recommend adding a little pepper or other seasoning, I didn't find that it needed salt because I used ham.  Some suggestions were adding a little hot sauce or salsa.  It made enough for a small helping for 8, so if you are using it as a main dish it would not feed more than 4.  I did need to cook it longer, after 30 minutes it was still very watery in the center.  Overall a GREAT recipe, SO easy and tasty, will make it again without a doubt!

Very good and easy to make.  I prefer crispy hash browns so I will probably cook them separately before mixing them into the eggs next time.

5 stars because it is so easy! great to reheat for our busy household in the morning. I broiled it just a bit to brown up the cheese. I think when I have more time i would experiment with sausage and veggies. Thanks for recipe;-)

Really good base recipe that you can play with (add sauteed veggies, substitute meat, etc).  I did brown & season the hashbrowns first and add more eggs to the mix.  My family really enjoyed this breakfast and we will have it Christmas morning with cinnamon buns.  Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic! Easy, quick, and very few dishes to wash.  It is a great recipe to build from.  You can basically add anything you or your family will enjoy.  I had an orange pepper in the fridge,ham , and extra white onion (in addition to the green).  I also added garlic while the veggies were sautéing and put seasoning salt and pepper on top before putting in the oven. I can't say enough  easy, simply, and yummy.  My kids ages are 1, 2, and 16.  All enjoyed it and I enjoyed the simplicity.  I will double the recipe next time for left overs.  I don't understand the reviews that said it wasn't good since there are no surprises.  It tastes like what you put in it.

This is a great recipe, very versatile. I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and cooked my hashbrowns with the green onions in some of the bacon grease before layering them on the bottom of my casserole dish. I don't think we would have liked this at all if the hasbrowns weren't cooked first. I also jazzed this up with garlic, extra onions and various other seasonings. I will probably make this again, but maybe use ham next time instead of bacon.

Even though my boyfriend really like this recipe, I felt that it was boring. The ratio of potatoes to egg should be reverse and salt and pepper would help out huge. I felt like I was eating a baked potato. I see everyone tweeking it. If I ever make this again, I will do that as well. Not a favorite for me.

This was very tasty.  I used Cabot Hunters Sharp cheddar cheese which added a nice bite.  I didn't have green onions so used minced yellow onions.  It was a great way to use up a small amount of bacon that wasn't enough to serve my whole family.  We will definitely have this again.

We had some friends stay over and I served this along with the Apple-Rasin French Toast recipe on allrecipes.  Because our guests are early risers I decided to make this recipe the night before and store it in the fridge.  It seem to work out just fine.  I added a tube of ground sausage to the recipe.  I also added about a cup of sour cream as suggested by other reviewers.  Some of the reviews indicated that the dish was bland so I also seasoned the thawed hash browns with about 2 teaspoons of Penzy's Cajun spice.  I also used Onion Powder instead of onions because I'm not crazy about chopping onions.  I also used a little more cheese than what was called for.  I couldnt really taste that I had put in the cajun spice--but the dish wasn't bland either.  I think I might add a little garlic powder, just to give it a little more zing.  Overall a great and easy recipe and very adaptable to your tastes.

This one went over great.  Got requests to make it again.  I added a few extra eggs, some pepper, and a can of green chiles.  Next time I'll probably add some Krazy Jane's mixed up salt.  I also made it the night before and kept it in the fridge until I was ready to bake in the morning.  Came out great.

YUM! this was quick and easy! as other reviewers suggested, i used an extra egg, and added some pepper and a little salt for seasoning. didn't have cheddar so i used a shredded italian blend. i was even a little short on hashbrowns and this still came out great. can't wait to try it again and change up the ingredients!

I made this today and it wasn't bad. My family wanted more meat so I doubled the bacon. I don't like onion so I omitted that. Since I accidentally added an extra 1/2 cup of hashbrowns I added a 1/2 cup of cheese and an extra splash of milk to offset it. Even though I doubled the meat we still felt it could use more. I added some seasonings to the hashbrowns as I fried them beforehand (per other reviewer's suggestions) so mine wasn't bland. I'll make this again but tweak the porportions. If you have more than 2-3 people I would suggest doubling the recipe.

Excellent alternative to frying up some hashbrowns.  Especially if your like me and can't cook hasbrowns to save your bacon.

This was great!  I made it for a church brunch.  I used sweet mayan onions for the recipe and used green onions to sprinkle on top for color.  I added more eggs and cheese.  I also substituted sausage for the bacon.  I incorporated another recipe and added garlic salt, mustard powder and, I know it sounds gross, but worcestershire sauce.  I had my friends rate it, and it got 5 stars.

This is a great dish for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner!  I found that a dollop of sour cream and a bit of salsa (medium) made this a definite repeat!  It is even better the next day!

Loved this recipe! I did make a few changes. First, I cooked the hash browns for a bit and then layered the bottom of the pan with them. I did add one more egg and used 3/4 cup of milk. I then mixed the cooked bacon (cubed), cheese (Cheddar & Colby), green onions plus 1 tsp of salt, dash of pepper, oregano, garlic powder and dry mustard. Poured mixture over hash browns and baked for 20 mins. Added some more cheese on top and then let is bake some more for another 5 mins. Delicious!

Great basic recipe that you can make your own. It definitely needs some spices. I will probably try adding seasoned salt and/or dry mustard next time. I made mine with chopped green pepper, red pepper, jalapeno, green onion, pre-cooked bacon, and chicken sausage. I used sharp white and sharp yellow cheddar for the cheese. Sprinkled some hot sauce on it when I ate it and it was great! Thanks.

it was just okay. adding bell peppers, sausage, or ham
might add more flavor. if your looking for something simple and filling
then this recipes for you! UPDATE Hash browns pan fried first works better as a bottom layer for a crust. just fry hash browns in bacon drippings.

Made exactly as written, was excellent!  Would be great to add green chilies or mushrooms/sausage.  Will definitely make again!  Update **Another tip is to mix the potatoes with the bacon/onions and any other veges.  spoon into the pan and then pour the egg mixture over the top.

This was really good.  I modified it slightly, adding a little more potato and bacon (I don't cook exact measurements all the time) and it was wonderful.  I added a few flavors to it like garlic and onion powder rather than onion.  It was a great breakfast for Christmas Day!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I fried up the hash browns and green onions a little bit in a cast iron pan, added some black pepper, then poured the egg and cheese mixture on top.  I used Parmesan and Emmentaller cheese, then sprinkled a little colby-jack and 3 slices of cooked bacon on top.  Cooked in same pan in the oven about 15 minutes.  Very good.  A little bland, but that's how my kids and husband like it.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used shredded o'brien hash browns and they added quite a bit of flavor.  I also added extra sauteed onion and green pepper.  The whole pie was gobbled up!  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't have enough hash browns so I used one cup chopped yukon gold potatoes with 2 cups frozen hash browns (which I kept frozen). That worked surprisingly well. I also didn't have green onions so I used chives. Like other reviewers, I also think that this needs something else ... maybe red bell pepper. It reheats nicely so I was able to have a quick breakfast the next morning, too.

We added a lot more hashbrowns to make it less eggy, used veggie bacon instead of real bacon, and cooked it for a lot longer.  Made a tasty vegetarian dinner!

Last night, my husband and I were starving and hadn't been to the grocery. But, we had all of the ingredients listed about except the green onion. So, I threw it together and instead added dried chives and a sprinkle of dill. This was so incredible to the taste and so very easy. My very picky husband and I even ate seconds. I will definately make this recipe again and soon. My parents are coming for a visit and this is what they are gonna get for breakfast. It is AWESOME.

Cooked hash browns in butter and placed in the bottom of a glass pie dish. Used chopped ham instead of bacon and added a 4 ounce can of diced green chiles mixed with remaining ingredients and poured over hash browns. Wife and I loved it. Both went back for second helpings. Will make it again.

I'm new to cooking, I've been forced to bacheloring it recently. I doubled the bacon. I used the store bought hash browns with onion and peppers, and I used mozzarella instead of cheddar. It came out great. Next time I will add more onion and try cheddar.  Thankyou!

Excellent base recipe! I used a lot of suggestions from other reviewers. Doubled the eggs. Oven baked the hash browns at 400 with liberal shakes of cracked pepper and the Lawrys Seasoning until browned a little. Adds quite a lot of time to prep but worth it! Used ham instead. Added a can of chopped green chiles, Mexican blend cheese (much more than called for), Lawrys seasoning to eggs too! We all loved it!

Delicious.  Added one extra egg, salt and pepper, and baked for an extra 20 minutes until it was set.  Sliced and served at a family brunch.  My guests loved it, will definitely make this again!

I made a some changes to the recipe by adding chopped Spanish onion and chopped green pepper, I added another egg as well as more cheese and hash browns.   I also cooked the casserole until the bottom of my dish was slightly browned, this added another 15 minutes to the original recipe cook time.  I will make this again, can't wait to try sausage or ham with this recipe.  This definitely a winner!

This was great!  So simple - great for company.  I didn't have enough cheddar, so I used half cheddar and half PEPPER JACK cheese....wow, the peppers added a nice little kick to it!  Will use this recipe again, and again.  Thank you for sharing!

Wow!  This turned out perfect!  My whole family loves it.  I didn't measure anything, just filled my casserole dish.  I used a dozen eggs and added lunchmeat ham, onion, red and orange peppers.  I took others' advice and cooked everything in the pan first and I also fried it all in the bacon grease which added a lot of flavor.  Thanks so much!

I tried flavoring it up more with onion and garlic powder but apparently not enough.  I will use more spices next time.  Also I will try cooking the potatoes first.  They seemed a tad underdone.

I have been using this receipe for years but I modify it just a tad.  I use the bacon but I also use sausage to make it meatier.  When I cook the sausage I add a can of rotel to it to add a little kick.   I layer the bottom of the pan with the thawed hasbrowns and add a little salt and pepper.  Then I pour the sausage over that. Pour some cheese, add the egg mixture and then sprinkle with bacon and cheese.  It is a huge hit in the office.  I usually have to cook it for about 15 minutes longer than on the recipes.

I liked this!  I did shred my own potatoes instead of using frozen hashbrowns.  Next time I might brown the potatoes a little before adding them.  I had a few raw ones, but that was my own fault for not using the frozen.  Made this for dinner last night.  Was in a pinch.  Even with shredding my own potatoes, this is easy, quick, and very good.  Thanks for sharing this with us, Ann.

This recipe is quick and easy to make, but we didn't care for it. It was too bland and my husband complained that all he could taste were the hash browns. I might try this again with the addition of sour cream as previously recommended as well as extra seasoning such as salt, pepper and Mrs. Dash.

I made this for Christmas morning and got so-so reviews.  We both felt it was a bit dry, like it needed sour cream or something to make it more creamy.  The concept of hash browns, eggs, and bacon mixed together is perfect - - this recipe just needs a few more ingredients to make it five stars.

This was very good, so good, in fact, that I barely got a piece.  I brought it for a Vacation Bible School potluck, and it was almost gone by the time I got there!  I doubled the batch, assembled it the night before, and baked it in the morning.

Very easy and delicious, but being from Cajun Country, I seasoned my hashbrowns before I mixed them with Cajun Seasoning.  It really spiced it up. You can also add jalopenos to give it some spice.  I used Jimmy Dean pork sausage instead of bacon.  I browned one pound of it and added a little more milk to the recipe.  It turned out great and was a big hit.

I only had an 8x8 pan so that is what I used. It took 45 minutes to cook all the way through. I added a teaspoon of Everything But the Bagel seasoning (TJ's). I mixed panko crumbs with the cheese sprinkled on the top at the end of the baking time for a little extra crunch. Loved it!

Easy and delicious!!!
I made the recipe exactly as written, the only thing different is I used sausage instead of bacon because that is what I had. This a recipe that lends itself to any number of ingredients and I am already contemplating it as a quick and easy dinner!

There was no seasoning in the recipe, so I added some salt, pepper & mrs. dash garlic seasoning. Also added some fresh chopped jalapeno's and used half/half instead of regular milk, Turned out really well. Also baked it at 375.

I'm a brunch aficienado and I found this recipe a great foundation from which one may take it in a great number of directions.
Regarding quantity -  I needed to make a recipe for ~12-14 people so use a 4 Qt  (8 1/2 x 14 3/4 x 2 1/4"} casserole dish. 
From the base recipe, I doubled the quantities  with the following changes: 
For eggs I upped it to 12 count. every thing else doubles.
For a savory based  I started by sautéing  yellow onions,  peppers (I used sweet peppers, but a little heat would be great, depending on your audience), mushrooms, and some cream sherry. I always like garlic , cumin and allspice . Please, use whatever tickles your fancy.
Reduce and add it to hash browns, eggs, and the other ingredients.
My bake time was 60 min. at 350 deg.  I added the last topping of cheese 45 min into the bake time. I received more than a few compliments. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Cheers,
J

This recipe was so so. I don’t know if it is because I followed a reviewer suggestion to fix it in slow cooker or not. It came out really dry. I will try again fixing it as listed and see if it comes out better. Like idea of the recipe though.

Bland and mushy. Recipe needs more overall flavor due to lack of seasoning and proper fats. Perhaps dry and lightly fry the potatoes before baking, and then finish with a 10 minute broil to crisp the top.

I am making it now. I can'see how you could go wrong with this recipe so I am rating it Before tasting it. I was short on potatoes. I only had some white onion.  I also put in some frozen peas, cilantro. I used the skillet I cooked the bacon in. 

Kathy B's recipe looks even better (great ingredients) but more work.

Made it overnight with an extra egg and a little extra bacon, omitted the green onion, but added some onion powder and it made a great Xmas morning breakfast! Thanks!

Rating this on smell alone, as I made it for a teacher breakfast. I doubled the recipe, but the eggs seemed not enough, so I added 6 more.  Added rosemary, dry mustard, salt and pepper and some poultry seasoning for extra flavor. Also used the O'Brien style hash browns with peppers and onions.  Looking forward to making this for my family soon

I often make a quiche similar to this, so I substituted heavy cream for the milk which makes it much lighter.  I also took the advise of other ratings and browned the hash browns and added some seasoning to them.  I will definitely make this again and try different variations.

This was just okay. We were staying all night in a condo in the mountains and I wanted an easy breakfast that I didn't need to stand over. I substituted sausage for the bacon for simplicity and added extra cheese.

Fantastic base recipe! there is so much that can be done with this recipe. I followed the directions since it was my first time making it, just doubled the ingredients. The only thing I would recommend is to brown the hash browns first, as the consistency of them is too mushy along with the eggs. I am very eager to make again with different variations of meats and veggies. It was a hit with the kids which is what is real important!

Easy and delicious basic recipe that will respond well to your personal tweaks. Add extra veggies, try Pepper jack and some salsa or fry up the hash browns a bit for some crunch. It all works.

Making it the original way I found it to be kind of bland. I decided to make it again with changes. 
This time I first cooked my hash browns in a 325 degree oven on a cookie sheet til they were lightly browned. I used 1 1/2 cups of diced country ham instead of bacon and added 1/4 cup more milk to the eggs. For more flavor I also added  1/8 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powder and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Had much more flavor and my father said he really enjoyed it as well.

Wonderful & easy. I did cook the eggs before I baked the casserole, family isn't too much on eggs and wanted to make sure they were done, done, done! I also doubled the recipe, as I had a huge crowd for breakfast. Added cubed ham, cooked crumbled sausage and a cup of sour cream to the batch. Everyone wanted the recipe, served with hot biscuits and homemade cream gravy. Yummy!

Simple and delicious. Browned the hash browns before adding to the egg mixture. Also, used leftover spicy hotdogs (diced) with half the amount of strips.

I made this for supper and it was really tasty. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. I used shredded Tex-Mex cheddar cheese, because I had it,  which was the only change I made. I would have added some diced red Bell pepper, but my wife doesn't like it, so I resisted the temptation. Because my wife doesn't care for green onion, I stirred it into only half after placing the other mixed ingredients into the baking dish.

I like a different version where you get the Reser FRESH shredded hash browns and press in pie pan, bake first to get toasty brown, then add Egg and other ingredients and bake. Its tastier if you do it this way.I also would put in crumbled Turkey sausage instead of bacon . Nice neat egg dish. Perfect for brunches!

Very tasty and easy to make; however...I had to increase heat to 375 and bake for an additional 20 minutes before it was completely cooked.  I will make this again  with noted changes.

I usually don't mess with a recipe the first time out.  I made this with flavored hashbrowns and still found it bland.  Everyone at the table thought it needed salt and pepper.  I think it also needed something like Herbs de Provence or Fine Herbs.  And I'd go with cream rather than milk or at least Half'n'Half.  the basic idea is good.

I have no earthly understanding of all the great reviews on this dish.  Sure, you can modify to make it decent, but then it's no longer this recipe.

Dry, bland,  not good as written.

Yummy.  Two teenaged boys loved it.  It reheated the next day beautifully.  Served it with fruit salad and a cold glass of milk.  Made the perfect school morning breakfast.

I made this on Christmas morning with a combination of ham and bacon.  I also used sweet onion instead of the green onion and added a little salt and pepper.  My family raved about it!  I have already made it again!!!

I thought it was good. Hubby wasn't to thrilled but he'd rather have bacon  anytime. Next time I'm going to add a little more cheese along with the bacon. (I used leftover ham....which he didn't eat in the first place.....oh well, I tried!)

This is a good starting off point but could use some seasoning and help for our tastes.   Also I added a little more egg and milk so it wasn't so dry.

This had too much sour cream; next time cut to a single large dollop. Also needs a lot more flavor- this was moist, but terribly bland. I think it would be better if the hash browns were browned.

I added smoked ham (one cup diced) instead of the bacon and used the hash browns with onions and peppers.  Would add more onions and maybe some garlic.

I've made this a few times and agree with the other reviewers that it is best to brown the hash browns first along with salt, pepper and butter.

This is a really good breakfast casserole. As others suggested, I added several different spices to the egg mixture (chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper) which I really think adds to the overall flavor. I use fresh chopped potatoes rather than frozen, and have done it with both russet and red, both equally as good. I usually season and cook the potatoes on the skillet for a few minutes first, then layer them at the bottom of the dish, per the directions. I also use turkey bacon and add chopped turkey sausage in the mixture too to make it even heartier.  It has turned out great every time I've made it.

The hashbrowns were too spongy. Maybe it needed to be cooked longer or the hashbrowns cooked before mixing.

Yum! All 3 kids and my husband love this.  We do like it better when the hashbrowns have been pre-browned and we usually add lots of yellow or vidalia onion but we also really like it just as written.  We put away any leftovers (I always double the recipe) and it makes a great school-day breakfast.

Very good base recipe. You really need to add tons of spices to this. I thought I added a lot but it could have used double that amount.

This recipe was good but browning the hashbrowns definately was a plus. We used regular onions and they were good.

Good base recipe, but needs some tweeking. I plan on going back and reading some other reviews to get some ideas. We will repeat this again, but with some additions.

This was just ok.  The recipe makes no mention of salt or pepper and the dish sorely needs it.  I put the hash browns on the bottom of the pan and then sprinkled garlic salt and pepper on top of that.  I cooked the bacon, mixed the rest of the ingredients together and added salt to that mixture and then poured it over the hash browns.  It baked up nicely but it still lacked flavor.  I won't be making this again, a lot of waiting for nothing.  In the future I'd rather just cook everything individually and make a burrito out of it.

Great recipe -- I used turkey bacon, and fried the hash browns separately with the whites of the green onions and a clove of garlic (to make them crispy).  I used mexican blend cheese and sprinkled cheddar on top.  It doesn't have much kick - but it's still quite tasty.

This is an excellent dish to prepare ahead of time & then pop in the oven for breakfast as we did on Christmas morning.  There wasn't a bite of it left!  I browned the hash browns before putting the casserole together, even though it didn't specifically say to do that.  I think next time I may line the bottom with crispy crowns instead.  It's a keeper and may well become part of a Christmas breakfast tradition.  Thanks for the yummy, easy recipe!

It was good.  I tried to cut the recipe in half for just my husband and I but used the same 9x9 pan and it was too thin.  Definately tastes better the thicker it is.

This recipe is very good & easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is just too bland.  I will definitely make it again but will use part swiss cheese & part cheddar, & add some bell pepper, & maybe a little something to give it some "kick".  It is though, an excellent basic recipe.

Very good!  Just made it for my husband and his friend and got rave reviews, and no leftovers!  I was short one piece of bacon and an egg, and I used half an onion instead of the green onions, but it came out great.  Thanks Ann!

I made this for a mid-morning party I had. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was a little dry and bland. I used the cut up potatoes 
an turkey bacon plus I added pepper. No onion (we don't care for it) Next time I'll maybe add an egg and some spice.

I halved this recipe, but made some modifications.  I used egg substitute (a little extra), reduced fat cheese (some sharp), added fresh parsley and seasoned pepper, added red bell pepper, and used ham lunch meat since I didn't have any bacon.  This turned out to be great!  My husband loved it.  It's a keeper!

We used vidalia onions instead of the green onions and made a few other minor tweaks. This one turned out great, and will become a staple for holiday cooking. We also assembled it the night before and refrigerated overnight, which made it so easy in the morning!

Didn't have bacon or hashbrowns, so I substituted 1/2 lb deer sausage and 3 cups of tater tots.  I also used Velveeta cheese since I didn't have any shredded cheese.  It turned out AWESOME!  Had a wonderful flavor to it.  It's now on our monthly meal rotation for breakfast!

This was really good.  I didn't use the bacon and I used reduced fat cheese to make this dish a little lighter.  I did however take the advice of another reviewer and add some sour cream.  Still was an excellent dish and will continue to make it.

Great recipe!!  I made this for a Ladies Retreat and it was a hit with everyone.  Many suggested adding mushrooms, green peppers, or spinach for extra flavor.  I will use this recipe often-- thanks!

I have been making a "brekkie pie" for years but it is a very labor intensive undertaking so I rarely do it.  This recipe was every bit as good as mine and the only hard part is waiting for it to finish baking!  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family as a fast dinner rather than brunch.  It tasted great and was quick and easy.  Would also be great to substitute ham or sausage.  A+

This was nice, I doubled it. It was received well at my New Years brunch. Instead of the bacon. I added mushrooms. I made this my veggie freinds treat. They lied it. I think next time I will put cresent rolls on the bottom of the pan. To make this even quicker I prepared all the ingredents the night before (eggs & milk), (cheese, onions, mushrooms). Mixed it together in the morning.  - great!!

My husband loved this!  My toddler only nibbled, but didn't push it off his plate either.  :-)  I enjoyed it.  Next time I will make it with breakfast sausage and chives.  I might have to add some sauted mushrooms and garlic also.  Looked very nice, too.  Thanks!

This is great! With the hash browns, there is no peeling! I added a small amount of bell pepper, more bacon, and one half cup more cheese. My husband said it is better than an omelet. I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing!!!

Instead of bacon, I added fresh vegtables(asparagus, broccoli,...) and I grated small red and yukon potatoes.  Very good and easy to make.

Very good, simple, not complicated.  I substituted fresh chives for the green onions as well.  A big hit at Easter Brunch!

This was flavorful and easy. Substitute hamfor the bacon and add some green pepper and it tastes like a denver omelet.
