These were easy and yummy. The recipe worked perfectly exactly as written. I’m hoping to try this again using sweet potatoes. I’d also like to use this recipe except with garlic and rosemary.

Cooked as the recipe. Really good. It was my trial run after getting an air fryer and I cooked up potatoes I was going to throw away. Excellent! Very excited about the possibilities.

Delicious, fast, and easy. I omitted chili powder for husband, but am sure that would make it even better. Also, if you have a larger air fryer, no need to do in batches. Mine was ready in 12 minutes. Stirred once. Made again and put dash of ChilI powder. Delicious

These came out great.  I had 3 pretty enormous russets so I cut them into the wedges and then cut them in half horizontally.  The spices were nice. I didn’t  use the parsley. I am out. The leftovers were great cut into cubes and fried up ina pan for breakfast home fries.

I squashed a few wedges after they were half cooked and gave them a light spray of cooking oil which gave the squashed parts a nice crunchy texture. I also used the rotisserie basket to cook them in my air fryer.

I used baby red potatoes cut into 4 or 6 wedges. The seasoning was flavorful and not overpowering. I'm new to air frying and like recipes that turn out right the first time. I would make this again.

These fries were delicious. They were crunchy on the outside, and perfectly cooked inside. I’ll prepare this recipe often.

My husband got me an air fryer for Christmas and this was the first recipe I tried. It was delicious!  Next time I might try a pinch of cayenne in the spice mix but that's personal preference.

These were absolutely delicious. The timing was spot on. My potato wedges were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Will be making these over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a Dutch yellow potato, and halved the ingredients.  My potato wedges came out perfectly.  Although there are a number of spices, the fries were not Spicy.  Perfect!

Use sweet potatoes with cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg. Less calories than traditional sweet potatoes with marshmallows. Great way of making potato wedges. I used an Evol oil spray bottle and used less oil.

I made this recipe this past weekend but changed the seasoning and the size of the wedges. Really good and easy to make.

I expected them to be crispier but the second bite told me the flavor and texture were perfect; I did throw some grated parmesan cheese over them.

I have made several recipes since purchasing my air fryer & this is by far my family's favorite.  Never any leftovers!  I was toying with the idea of using the same seasonings with onions (of course modifying the time) or even other leftover veggies like broccoli.  Thanks for a great recipe & intro to air frying!

I made without oil and salt to take to a neighborhood dinner.
They had cooled by the time they got there, so I popped them into a 400* oven for 5 minutes and they came out hot and crisp.
