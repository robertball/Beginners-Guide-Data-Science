Rating based on as written recipe.  The success of any recipe depends on the quality of ingredients.  This one deserves the best avocado you can find and a nice, full flavored orange - so add "seeded" to the orange prep.  I thought the ginger might be a bit much, but it wasn't.  My tweaks will be to start with 1/4 c water and add more as desired.  Also, will spice up a bit with a fermented chili sauce, depending on use.  For us omnivores, this should also work with a grilled chicken taco.  I'll try that this evening.  (edit) And it did.

Absolutely delicious! I used honey instead of agave & I used coconut liquid amino acids as a substitute for soy sauce ??

Very good, tangy dressing that goes great with a fresh garden salad. I doubled the pepper flake to give it a little more bite.   This would be good on chicken, as well. I think next time I will use a little less citrus juice.  The orange overpowered the flavors to the point that I couldn't taste the avocado.
