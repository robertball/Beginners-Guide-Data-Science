I am giving this a 5 because after lots of changes, this was incredible!  I used fench cut beans, 1/2 sour cream instead of all milk, 1/2 cup chopped oinion, and a cup of cheddar cheese.  I did not mix any french fried onions in, as they tend to get soggy, I just topped with them (cheddar flavored) instead.  My husband who eats NO veggies, and everyone else too, had 2 seving each, our family of four almost polished off this whole casserole.  I am very excited, as I have been looking for a green bean casserole recipe, and this was so tasty.  Definitely cut down the liquid, or it will be too runny!

Mix the cream of mushroom with the milk, then add pinch of salt, pinch of pepper, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of onion powder... add green beans and french's fried onions according to recipe... bake 30 mins then add onions on top and 10 more mins. Eliminates wateriness and lack of flavor. I made it this way and didn't have leftovers!!! Almost upsetting until I remembered that meant my guests loved it.

This recipe proves that green beans can indeed be comfort food. My husband and his friends go nuts over these and ask for seconds and thirds. (Vegetables!!) It's now expected that I serve up a pan of this with any special dinner. I used 1/2 cup milk (all you need; makes it super creamy instead of runny) use frozen green beans (4 cups; better texture!! Just bake until tender) ANd ther is NO NEED TO ADD EXTRA SALT- esp. if using canned beans.  The soup is salty, the onions are salty, enough already! I also add lots of fresh cracked black pepper.

You really can't go wrong with Green Bean Casserole...I use this recipe year after year with the only significant change being to eliminate the milk and add in sour cream (or light sour cream) in its place.  Makes a less soupy and much more creamy dish.

great classic recipe. The only thing I change is I add 4 oz cream cheese per can of soup. Makes the casserole very creamy!

This recipe is by far a favorite in our household.  I agree that you have to cut the full amount of milk since the beans will excrete some juices and make it a tad watery.  My family prefers the string beans in the can whereas I prefer the green beans that are frozen from Sam's or Costco, the large organic bag of beans.  We also add some shredded colby jack to thicken it up a little more and a few chopped onions for added flavor.  Be sure to 'cover' the top of your casserole with the French fried onions and bake till crispy ... it's awesome!!!

Excellent.  Just a note: if you used frozen green beans, heat them up in the microwave first!  Also, buy the larger can of fried onions - they are great on the top.

Used this as my 1st ever green bean casserole recipe.  I used the other user's suggestions: #1  instead of 3/4 cup milk, I used 1/4 cup milk + 1/2 cup sour cream #2 I added 1/2 cup diced onion & 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese & #3 instead of mixing in ANY of the french fried onions, I added them all to the top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  Whole family loved it!

This is great recipe that I have used for years with a few exceptions.  I use 3 cans of drained green beans, 1/4 cup milk, fat free soup and don't add salt.  The soup has enough salt. Just mix it all together and heat in the oven without preheating.   Spray pan with cooking spray for easy clean up. Easy and Good!

I use 2 9oz packages of french style green beans and I buy the bigger can of onions so that I can add a little more onions.  I don't eat this but my husband loves it.

This maybe would have been better if you used fresh green beans. It was way to salty for my taste!

Great and tasty recipe.  I reduced the milk to a 1/4 c and added 1/2 c of sour cream for thickness and taste.  I also added some sauteed onions and shredded cheddar cheese to the mix.  It was the BEST green bean casserole I have ever tasted.  This one's a keeper and is requested for Christmas dinner.

my meat-only husband actually showed me this recipe.  With a few modifications, we eat this every week!  I don't like mushy veggies, so I use 1pound cut up fresh green beans.  Bring some water to boil and then throw in the beans.  Boil them for approximately 5 minutes (or until slightly softened and still a tad crispy) then drain them and throw them into the recipe.  In addition to the recipe, we add garlic powder (approx 1tablespoon) and sometimes a bit of onion powder.  OMG to die for!

Added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder per other suggestions.  Doubled the recipe and did 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk.  Used french style green beans and tossed in a can of mushrooms.  Tasted so great - traditional and yummy!!

This is the old classic, particularly at Thanksgiving, which has probably made its way to most American tables, including ours, at one time or another.  I use a 16-oz. pkg. of French-style green beans, cooked, just 1/2 cup of milk and a teaspoon of soy sauce.  Five stars for its sentimental value alone.

A great, easy to follow and easy to make recipe. It can be made ahead of time, omitting the last onion topping step. When serving, simply add the onions on top to add the crunch factor back in.

This recipe is pretty bland as is. I doubled the recipe and used two bags of frozen green beans, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken soup instead of the sour cream and heavy cream instead of milk. I added cooked and crumbled bacon, shredded Cheddar cheese and a sauteed onion to the mix. Very delicious with the changes.

This is the recipe for GB casserole!  When I have time, I like to use fresh green beans instead of canned or frozen.  I steam them until tender and then saute them with fresh garlic and a slice or two of diced bacon before combining w/ the soup mixture and baking.

This is the same way I have made mine for years, minus the milk, and I have not had one complaint yet. It is so simple and easy. I've seen other recipes that add a lot of things to it, but what is the point?! Sometimes the classics are just better. With all the cooking going on during the holidays, this is one of the easiest dishes to make.

Green Bean Casserole is a tradition for my thanksgiving. One year I decided to change it up a little and use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. Very good change.

I used a 1 kg bag of frozen green beans, 1 can of soup, 3/8 cup of milk, a heaping tbsp of sour cream, Worchestshire sauce and pepper, baked 30 minutes, stirred in onions and baked another 15 minutes was perfect.

Awesome! We always add extra French fried onions. I usually bake this in the oven, but did it in the crock pot on Thanksgiving. It worked great! It was a bit soupy once it got hot so we just tipped the lid on the pot for a couple of hours. Next time we use the crock pot, we would add less milk. Since this method of cooking wouldn't result in crispy onions on top, we simply toasted some French fried onions in the oven for a few minutes and served them on the side. Everyone loved it!

The saltiness of the canned green beans added a "sour" element to the dish I did not care for. After adding much garlic powder, cheddar cheese and a ton of onions, it was still... off somehow. I will use the recipe from the French's container next year, or use my grandmother's recipe.

Very good! I've always used this basic recipe which is really good. This time I tweaked some using reviewers tips. I used less milk and added sour cream. That made it soooo creamy. Also used roasted garlic and mushroom soup instead of plain mushroom. The best!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and I was really pleased that the recipe was so easy after a whole evening of cooking. However, it was not a big hit at the family feast. Prior to eating, the dish needed to be reheated after traveling, and I think my host left it in the oven too long. I thought it tasted fine, but there was quite a bit left after dinner. I think it was more a matter of preference than the recipe not being tasty.

I did read a few reviews and decided to substitute 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of milk, and I used one 16 oz bag of frozen french-style green beans.

I will most likely give this recipe another try and just make sure to serve the dish right away.

As is, I give it a 3. I added a couple splashes of worcestershire, a few dashes of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and some shredded mexican blend cheese. I used the cheddar flavored onion stuff because the store was out of the plain kind. It needs something to give it a kick, I recommend worcestershire sauce. I also only used 1/2 cup milk with the soup instead of 3/4 so it wasn't so runny.

I am giving it 4 stars just because green bean casserole is not a favorite of mine in general, but my boyfriend listed this as a must have tradition for Thanksgiving. It was easy to make and he really liked it.

Very good! After reading a few of the reviews I made a couple of changes. I used 2 cans of french cut green beans, omited the salt & the milk. I replaced the milk with 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also added about a 1/3 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese. Very good, and not soupy. I found it really didn't need any added salt to suit my tastebuds either.

This is a great recipe, but it is just awesome when you use fresh steamed green beans instead of the canned ones.  The flavor is so much better, and the texture of the beans is just out of this world!  I try to use fresh, in season veggies all the time, and you can tell the difference. In terms of time - the steaming of the green beans adds only 15 minutes to the whole operation. Enjoy!

I am a "from scratch" cook pretty much all the way. But Green Bean casserole is a Thanksgiving tradition and there are never any leftovers. I prefer french cut green beans even though they are not original. Instead of salt I add a dash of soy sauce. This is a once a year dish!

We make this every year for Thanksgiving dinner - at this point I don't know if it is because of tradition or taste. I do use the Campbell's Wild Mushroom soup ( a bit less salty and better flavor) and ONLY use fresh green beans, which I leave long (just trim the ends). I add some sliced mushrooms that I sauteed in garlic and a bit of butter as well. These little extras make all the difference.

This is always a good recipe, but if you really like onions, like onion dip etc., try this.  Add a pack of onion soup mix and only put the french fried onion on top the last 5 minutes of baking.  My 94 year old father said it was the best GB casserole he ever tasted.  He never says anything about my cooking one way or the other. :-)

I added salt and garlic powder and it was still bland. The mushroom soup was to thick it was hard to mix in well with the green beans, maybe next time i will warm up the soup before i mix.

Very tastey.  I too used sour cream instead of milk.  Also added onion powder.  used frozen beans so it took a bit londer to bake, but they were very firm, not soggy at all.  did not bake with onion mixed in, only on the top at the end, then mixed them all in to serve.  GREAT!

Super easy, cheap and delicious. YOU MUST reduce the milk though. If you do the 3/4 cups as the recipe dictates, your casserole will be runny, not thick. And definitely NO more added salt.

I did not like this dish at all. Everyone tasted it but no one was impressed at my table and I followed the recipe exactly. I guess we are just those kind of people that really love the taste of fresh green beans. They are great all by themselves!

I didn't try this for years. It never sounded appealing to me. I finally made it as a request by a guest. Yep, it tasted as aweful as I thought it would. It's like eating soggy beans with elmers glue.

Thank you for posting this.  My mom made this recipe for as long as I can remember for Thanksgiving.  I have been looking for the recipe and I will tell you the fancy ones with cheese and onions and other things just doesn't compare. (Probably because of tradition. This and Creamed Corn Cassarole that my mom makes with no eggs, are the two items that will definately remain UNTOUCHED and Unvaried throughout the years to come (the recipes that is) Nothing is more dissapointing than trying something new on Thanksgiving and it tasting different than what you are familiar with.  BTW We use Golden Mushroom Soup too.  My mom swears by it however it is getting harder and harder to find.

Same casserole I've loved for years, but after reading other reviews I took some of their advice. (even though it bugs me when people totally alter a recipe) : ) -  I added about 1/4 C sauted red pepper and 1/2 t. garlic powder & 1/2 t. pepper.  Just added something more to a family favorite and made it more interesting.

There was way too much milk so it wouldn't set. Also, make sure that if you use fresh green beans that you double the cook time.

I use fresh green beans, omit the milk and use sour cream instead.  Add fresh ground pepper and only add the fried onions the last 7 minutes of baking - it does take 45 minutes to bake because of fresh beans but the texture is much better than canned beans and they don't have that "frozen" taste.

I've always liked this recipe. Another great variation to this recipe is to use canned asparagus instead of the green beans and cream of asparagus soup rather than the cream of mushroom. Yum!

I myself don't eat green beans but I make an exception for these! Everyone loved these and had seconds. The only change I made to the recipe was the addition of about 1/4 C. bacon bits(real bacon, not baco's)and approx. 10 water chestnuts, quartered for extra crunch. Also, about 1/3 C. shredded mild cheddar cheese. All 3 of these additions I mixed in with the rest of the ingredients. Yum Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very runny. Tasted great! Next time I will use only a small amount of milk or light sour cream as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe! I was looking for a recipe to use the recipe conversion utility with so I could make one for 16 people. It was wonderful! Everyone loved it. I used half the milk as recommended, it would have been way to runny if I had used all the milk called for.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I think you only need 1/2 cup of milk for this serving size & don't need any added salt (due to the soup & fried onions).  I doubled this recipe though for Thanksgiving, using french cut green beans & a 6 oz. can of french fried onions.  I've made this many times in the past but this time substituted golden mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom soup.  It definitely was a success.

A good, classic recipe. I'd give it 5 stars, if it weren't for the canned green beans. Please consider using the frozen green beans for a MUCH, MUCH better taste!! (I can't stand canned veggies!) I'll be using this recipe for Thanksgiving!

Perfect the way it is. I do add more french onions though because if we're going to be unhealthy, we do it all the way at our house! Yum! Perfect for pitch ins, too, since usually there's no vegetable side dish at all.

I went with this recipe because I didn't have the ingredients for Grandma's green bean casserole which I love and this seemed simple enough. this was not good. very plain, very watery. From the reviews, it seems to be a highly rated recipe only because of everyone's changes. Will not make again unless I want soup.

I use frozen french cut style green beans, that I blanch with boiling water before putting into the dish. Place a can of cream of CELERY soup into a small sauce pan, add sliced mushrooms and celery and NO milk, water or any other liquid. Stir until it's hot. Mix in with the beans and pop into the oven. Top with the french fried onions the last five minutes in the oven.

Exactly what I wanted--traditional and tasty!  No reason to mess around and add other ingredients when it's already great the way it's written.  I doubled the recipe, and only used 1 cup of milk.  It turned out creamy; not too think and not too runny.

This recipe is great for holidays!  It is very delicious, yet so, so simple to make.  I have used low-fat cream of mushroom soup and it is just as great.  There really is no need to add any extras, especially fattening cheeses. This side dish is great-- as is!!  Be sure sprinkle the fried onions on top and completely cover so every portion has that nice, crispy top.

Awesome recipe, nice and simple. I did as others suggested though and used sour cream instead of milk, also added a little bit of garlic powder and finely chopped white onion, and mixed in a little cheddar cheese. Tasted great and there was hardly any leftovers!

Good Recipe! I used reduced fat sour cream and cream of mushroom soup and milk. The sour cream gives it a little kick. I also used parm cheese on top.

Not only was this WAY too runny, but it was also VERY bland.

I did as others suggested and cut down on the milk and substituted sour cream for part of that (used 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cream), but even with this substitution, it was STILL too runny.  Also, even with the added sour cream flavor, this did not have ANY flavor. I was very unimpressed. For Christmas I think I will try the "Grandma's Green Been Casserole" from this site.

I went ahead and gave it two stars instead of one because with a little alteration, it might would have been edible, but as is, most of it was thrown out. What a waste of ingredients.

This was a delicious dish after incorporating suggestions of other reviewers. I used fresh frozen green beans which I steamed for 5 min. I skipped the milk and added 1/2 cup sour cream instead. I also added 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1 med chopped souteed onion. I baked the above mixture as directed and I added French onions on top but did not mix them into the beans (they don't taste good if soggy). Everyone loved the dish and was asking me for the recipe. Needless to say there were no leftovers :)

I've tried this before using a recipe I found in a magazine that had soy sauce in it. That was a huge failure so I was hesitant to try it again. But once I noticed no soy sauce I gave it a try. Boy am I glad I did. This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was I used only a 1/2 cup of milk which is plenty and perfect. I even got my daughter to try it and she hates green beans. She loved it. That is saying a lot. I recommend this recipe not just for holidays but for any day. Especially during the summer months with fresh green beans.

Very delicious! I do add about 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese to the mix before putting in the oven, and I use up the whole can of french fried onions. My hubby never liked green beans but after trying this he is always requesting it!!

I used cut, frozen green beans and cooked them in the microwave for about 4 minutes first.  I then added the sauce.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk, instead of all milk.  It was great!

Let's be real.  This is just average.  If you like average, salty, fattening veggies, this is for you.  Even for special occasions, we can do better than this.  I guess for me this one is just not worth the calories and the artificial ingredients are probably worse than the fat content.  Does anyone know how to make this with natural ingredients?

A little bland for my tastes, but my friends love it when I serve it at our occasional comfort food dinner parties. I doubled the onions and added 1/2 can cream of celery and one cream of mushroom and it was a little more tasty.

I usually make regular green beans for my holiday meals but figured I would try some thing different and I did not care for this recipe. It seemed like too many onions. They were fine on the top because they were crispy but the ones that were put into the mixture just was over doing it and they were kind of soggy... ugh. Maybe if I tried this again I would continue to stick to using 1/2 cup of milk and just put half the can on top of the casserole and not put any in it.

I made it to adulthood having never tasted "Green Bean Casserole" so this Thanksgiving I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Now that I have tried it, I think I can probably skip it for the rest of my life. The beans were so mushy and the sauce was bland.

Can't go wrong with a Classic!  I don't like my casserole to be so juicy so I usually add three cans instead of 2 & a tad bit more salt.  We love it!  Try this with the Cheddar Cheese French Fried Onions, it's awesome!

Oh, wow!  How EASY!  All the holiday hype about green bean casserole, and I thought it must be something incredibly complicated.  Our family LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe.  They passed the picky eaters in this house, so that says something big.  I did modify just a bit.  I topped with shredded cheddar cheese and buttered breadcrumbs.  Delicious!

LOOK NO MORE! THIS IS THE RECIPE YOU WANT!
Nothing goes over better then a tried and true, comforting, green bean casserole.  This is a recipe you can rely on, and the ingredients are inexpensive and easy to store in your pantry for when your ready to whip one of these up for a side dish for meatloaf, baked potatoes. 
I like to put some shredded cheddar cheese on top just before the last step of sprinkling the "remaining onions over the top, and return to the oven for 5 minutes."
But if you don't have cheese or decide to skip it, it's stil DELICIOUS!

This is one my favorite recipes.  We may get all the time.  With a few changes I use frozen green beans and I do not add any milk, instead of the fried onion on top I use Italian season bread crumbs.

Yum! I didn't have milk, so used sour cream, which added a really nice flavor. My green beans were canned, as I made this as a week night, comfort food, quickie, but they were also unsalted. Having the sour cream in there added a nice bit of flavor. Also, the mushroom soup and crispy onions I used were both gluten free, to convert this basic and classic recipe to a gluten free dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

My big change is cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. I am allergic to mushrooms. Whisk the soup and the milk together then add other ingredients. Have added leftover turkey  anday made a whole meal.

I like this version of green bean casserole. I've never liked the idea of putting Velveeta in a green bean casserole as many people do. But I do add a little bit of Worcestershire Sauce. It gives it a bit of oomph and zing.

Super easy and always yummy. My cousin is learning to cook. So new that she had to read out-of-box instructions repeatedly to make sure she was doing it right.  She asked for simple recipe for a good thanksgiving side so she could start contributing. This was the perfect recipe!

Loved this! I added cheddar cheese and 1/2 a sautéed onion. I didn't have any sour cream so I used 1/2 a cup of half and half. I also added a little garlic and onion powders. Lastly, because I used canned beans, I omitted the salt. It was 1/2 gone before I could bake the the remaining onions on top!  So creamy! It was so good! Perfect for a cool fall day.

It really doesn't need the milk, I never add it any more it makes it to runny. I use french cut green beans and I also like to add extra french fried onions to the mix and on top for a little extra crunch.

This was really good. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2 cup of milk instead of what the recipe said. I also copped some regular onion to go in the casserole and used the french fried onion only as a top layer. The final adjustment was to throw in a little sharp cheddar cheese. I will be making this again. It was quick and easy.

This was my first time making this type of recipe.  All in all, not too shabby but it was missing extra flavor, so I'll opt in for some of the additions offered on here.  I read reviews on salt.  If you are worried about salt, grab a can of green beans that clearly states "no salt added" and check the ingredient list to make sure.  Also, I grabbed a can of "reduced sodium" condensed mushroom soup.  It's always better to have less salt, than more.  You can put salt back in, but you can't take it out! Next time: no salt, more pepper.   Also, the onions that were mixed in were a bit soggy.  The crunchy ones up top were so much more delicious that I will opt for putting them all up top, like someone suggested.  I will definitely try this again though, as is, it's not a bad base to work with!

Having never tried green bean casserole I couldn't have had a better base to start with. Following the suggestions of others I added about 1/4C sour cream for some of the milk, and about a cup of cheddar cheese. I'll be making this year round whether it's a holiday or not. Thanks!

A classic simple recipe! I always make green bean casserole with fresh green beans for an extra snap. I agree with others - I put only a small amount of the canned onions into the mix, and then top with the rest. Fantastic!

Nice creamy version of the traditional Thanksgiving dish. Easy to make ahead of time and freeze.

Delicious!  Used sour cream instead of milk as suggested by other reviewers, and used 3 cans of french fried onions (2 mixed in, 1 sprinkled on top) since they are my favorite part.  No leftovers from this dish :)

This was really good.  I took the advice of another and added 1/2 cup sour cream instead of all the milk and some cheese to the top.

Classic Green Bean Casserole recipe. I've this recipe at pot luck but our families never had it at the holidays. I tried it for Thanksgiving and everybody seemed to enjoy it. I only used a half cup of Milk and added two big spoonfuls of sour cream to thicken it up. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this yesterday for thanksgiving and it was sooo sooo good.  I had never made this dish, and it was so easy to make as well. Instead of using the can green beans, we got the fresh ones and cooked them myself.  Great recipe.

This was the most complimented dish at Thanksgiving using the recipe by nleishman.  I always disliked when the fried onions got soggy as a kid, so substituting in a half cup of chopped onions instead was great, as was cutting the milk with sour cream.  I topped with regular frenches fried onions and cheddar cheese. I will definitely repeat this recipe since it was such a hit.

This traditional dish is always a hit. I prefer to use frozen green beans instead of canned.  I added shredded parmesan cheese & pearl onions to the recipe. It is superb!

This is the classic green bean casserole recipe, in my opinion.  I always add slivered almonds.  They lend a wonderful texture to the whole thing.  And I add a splash of milk or creamer for consistency.  You can also make this recipe vegan very easily!  Just get a vegan cream of mushroom soup (whole foods has some) and used vegan creamer. We'll still be serving Turkey, but there will be tons of vegetarian food as well :)

This is the recipe someone in my huge extended family always makes every year for Thanksgiving. When it is my turn I like to add a couple extras. I add a can of sliced water chestnuts, and sprinkle crumbled cooked bacon on top along with the French Fried onions. Yummy!

I love this recipes! It's EXTREMELY easy to make and it tastes great!. I made this awesome chicken recipe last night with the green bean casserole and some smashed potatoes with bacon and cheddar and he said the casserole was his favorite! I was suprised that he said it was his favorite but I'm glad because it was easier than the other things. :P I have made this several times exactly as the recipe explains and will continue to do so because its amazing. I have tried cubed chicken in it to for some protein once and that is great too.

This is the standard I always use. When I want to "fancy it up", I add sliced, crispy bacon and spaetzle that I pre-cook. Never any leftovers!

It's green bean casserole, how difficult can it be?  I used this recipe as a ratio guide.  I always add garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper to the green beans and mushroom soup.  I saw a suggestion to use sour cream instead of milk and I will definitely have to try that.

Very good recipe. It was my first green bean casserole, and when I put it at the table, husband and stepdaughter asked "what is that?" I had thought it is a traditional american holiday dish..  :) I did use a bit of sour cream instead of all milk and it turned out just perfect!

I used mostly sour cream and just a few splashes of milk to get the mixure flowing.  I used frozen beans and they were more firm than the dish I remember from my youth.  If you want the softer, thinner beans, go for the canned variety (French?).

Im not really a green bean casserole fan. Made this more to please my husband, and we both loved it. Only difference we did was we used 1/2 cup of milk based on previous reviews.

I have never had Green Bean Casserole before but I always hear about it around the holidays so I decided to try it out. I thought I would test it out first before making it for Christmas Dinner next week. I am so glad I did!!! My brother-in-law ate with us and he has always told me Green Bean Casserole is great. He said this one was so so. My husband, sister-in-law, and myself didn't care for it at all. This recipe was very runny and that is after I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and added about 1/4 cup grated gruyere. I will not make this again but if someone is reading this and you are still planing on making it, follow the advice from others and substitute the milk for 1/2 cup sour cream and add 1 cup grated cheese. That is the only way I could see this recipe being ok.

Always a good idea to read the reviews before trying a new recipe.  I made the following changes and ROCKED thanksgiving with this:

I cut the entire recipe in half, so double these amounts if making the full size (6 servings).
Reduce milk to 1/4 cup - I used canned condensed milk, creamier.
Add 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese - 3/4 to mix in, 1/4 on top with remaining onions.
Use condensed cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup.
NO salt.

Freaking delightful.  Great reheated, too, which surprised me.

I agree that this needed some flavoring.  Recognizing that, I added some freshly ground pepper, salt and a little garlic powder and mixed it in.  I also substituted frozen green beans (thawed) for the canned.  I just cooked it at 350 degrees until it was bubbly (about 45-50 minutes), then I took it out and added the French fried onions and put it back in to brown.

I sauteed in halif a onion and a handful of mushrooms, and topped it with more onions cut in rings, and next time I would double both. It was pretty runny, so the sour cream replacement might be a good idea, but I really liked the sauce( we had forgotten to make gravy this year but we all preferred this sauce MUCH more than gravy) Instead of french onions, I crushed about 3/4 cup of crackers with a little butter on the top, and that was fabulous. I liked this recipe much more than I thought it would ( never had green bean casserole before) and I can't wait to play around with different versions. Like next time I might use all milk and sour cream instead of the canned soup and a 1/2 lb mushrooms instead...sounds good. Or red bell peppers...Oh, I used a 16 oz bag frozen green beans which I microwaved for 4 min beforehad...my family thoughht they were still crunchy but I thought they were perfect. If microwaving though, make sure to drain out any water.

Good, classic holiday casserole recipe.  I did as other reviewers mentioned and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 milk instead of all milk and it turned out yummy!  Also threw in a dash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.

For me, this is hands down the best green bean casserole.  I don't like casseroles with cheese because I feel it covers up the true flavors of the dish.  
For users who think this is bland, try using a southern style canned green bean.  I use Hanover's in the white can and the extra flavor makes the dish a hit.

Very tasty. With the remaining half can of Mushroom soup I made half-recipe Breakfast Casserole II the next morning! :D No waste!

This was OK. I follwed all the directions except I added one cup of sour cream and still felt that it needed some other flavoring to it. It was a little bland, but a good base recipe for green bean casserole. Will make again using more spices and sour cream.

I made this one year to go with thanksgiving dinner (I always try a new recipe every year) And this was just mushy and not to our taste.. My husband likes green bean Casserole, and he did not like this at all.. Will not make this again.

So yummy!  I love how it is simple and fast -- however I must admit I deviated from the recipe - 
Instead of 3/4 cup of milk, I added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup whipping cream for extra creaminess...
and then instead of canned beans, which I have never been a fan of, I boiled 4 cups of frozen green beans to my desired tenderness... I also added caramelized onions along with the french fried onions....... SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!

I personally didn't like this dish that much but apparently my guests did because there were no leftovers to be seen at the end of the night!  I thought that the casserole was too runny (so like other reviewers mentioned, I would add less milk next time)... it tasted a bit bland so I would also add more pepper next time to enhance the flavorings.

My mom followed this recipe exactly how it's posted.  I, on the other hand, added the sour cream and I also added a little shredded mozarella cheese to thicken the consistency of it. I also did use fresh green beans instead of canned.  My mom's were leftovers and mine finished same day.  So, it kind of does need a little tweeking for it to be extra good.

EXCELLENT w/ Half & Half instead of milk or sour cream is good too.  Make sure you add some onions in the casserole and not just on top!  Make all the time not just for the holidays!

I like this recipe, although I do make a few changes.  I always use French style green beans and I cut the milk down to 1/2 cup. I don't like runny casseroles.  But it is a good recipe for holidays!

I've never been a fan of green bean casserole for some reason, but I made this for Christmas and tried some myself. It was really good, but I think there was s little too much milk, it was a little on the runny side. The flavor was good, though.

Just what I was looking for...that is, after Del Monte decided to stop printing this basic recipe on their cans.  Honestly, I wondered when they would:)  Anyway this recipe may not be the EXACT measurements, but tasted EXACTLY as it always has when I followed the can for all those years.  Call me a creaure-of-habit!

This turned out watery. I would reccomend cooking at a slightly higher temperature. I think fresh green beans would have been nicer than canned, which were too soggy. I added sauteed onion, but I think it only made it soggier.

I liked the how creamy the dish came out, but it seemed to lack a little something, maybe needed more pepper?  I will monkey with it alittle more next time I try it.

Can't go wrong with this holiday standard!  I don't add salt but 1 tsp of soy sauce which gives it a nice, subtle flavor.  Also, skim milk works great too - can't tell the difference!

A classic! This is a wonderful, simple, and easy casserole to make, and my family loves it!  I couldnt find the green bean casserole recipe, so Im really glad this was here! Very simple! I added a teaspoon of black pepper on accident, but it turns out a-ok~ ^_^  Not for calorie counters though!

Used sour cream, and I added the onion/garlic like recommended in reviews, but still rather bland for us.  Think I'll go with the frozen beans next time and will use more garlic for flavor.

I add Worcestershire  and garlic powder. Prefer cut green beans over French style. Also, I use low sodium green beans and cream of mushroom soup so I can add as much salt as I like.

I use 3 cans of beans instead of 2.  I also add shredded cheese and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder.  The extra beans makes this recipe perfect and it is not too liquidy at all!! My family loves this at every holiday and they say it beats every other green bean casserole. I always double the recipe so in that case I use 6 cans of beans and double everything else. I always use a large foil disposable casserole pan for easy cleaning!!

I had to alter the recipe to omit the onions because of a guest's allergy. Instead, I used a small package of slivered almonds. I mixed most of the package into the dish, reserving a few to sprinkle on the top and finished it with unseasoned bread crumbs. It was a bit bland for me, but guests enjoyed it. When I brought the leftovers home, I mixed some of the crispy onions into it. Best of both worlds!

I have made this a few times. Honestly, it's a little bland as it's posted here. I use cream of celery soup, french onion dip in place of the milk, a fair amount of ground black pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and I bake it for about 30 minutes at 375 before taking it out to put the fried onions on top, then return to the oven for at least 5 more minutes. This thickens up the soupiness a little more and makes it feel more like a casserole! It's always the first thing that's empty now whenever I make it! Highly recommended!!

Overall, I wasn't impressed by the way this turned out. It was extremely easy to make which is why I chose this recipe over others. But next time I'll be using a more complicated recipe.

Oh it is so good. I did make some changes.  Everyone loved it and I made it for our Christmas potluck.

Instead of the french onion I bought a sweet onion and chopped it into long slices and added sliced mushrooms into the dish.  For the top I smashed whole grain crackers to give it a nice crunch and added multiple types of sharp cheddar cheese on the top.

I made this with golden mushroom soup because it was a little healthier than the cream of mushroom.  I think the golden mushroom gave it a great flavor.  The best part is my hubby doesn't like green beans, but he really liked this.  I'll definitely make this again.

I plan to use this user's recipe: 
#1 instead of 3/4 cup milk, use 1/4 c. milk + 1/2 c. sour cream 
#2 add 1/2 c. diced onion & 1 c. shredded cheddar cheese
#3 add ALL of the french fried onions to the top for the last 5 minutes of baking.

Just followed the directions. I didn't add any salt but it tasted salty. But other than the saltiness it didn't taste like much. Good base though for better cooks.

Excellent!  I followed one reviewers recommendation and used half sour cream and half milk instead of all milk ...it was plenty creamy.  I also added sautéed  onion to the mix and put the french onions only on the top.  Just the best.

I used the fried onions from the salad section at the grocery store! Much better than the nasty can kind :) I only used 1/2 amount of milk and it was still very runny. Next time I will leave the milk out completely and just use the cream of mushroom or maybe add sour cream as others suggested! It was great though and I will make again !

This was tasty. I will use chicken creamy soup instead of mushroom next time. But in my opinion french fried onions make all the difference here, more onions you put better it tastes! I can just eat them straight out of the bag. I was lazy to make my own bread crumbs so in addition to onions I also sprinkled some dry stuffing mix on top, just a bit, everyone liked it and were commenting on the best - crusty part (onions and crumbs).

Very good flavor.  Only problem was that it was a little runny, even after substituting sour cream for half of the milk.  I would cut the milk down even further if I make again.

This has been a holiday tradition in my family all my life.  We never add any milk whatsoever. The beans retain enough liquid even after draining that there is no need for it.  Mmm, mmm, good!

there are better recipes out there that are a little more complex but it is well worth it.  I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  Crushed corn flacks taste a lot better than the onins on top too.

I used frozen green beans and cooked them first to make them tender then mixed everything together. It turned out better than I thought it would.

ALWAYS good!  However, I did forget to add in the milk so about halfway through cooking (when I remembered), I added about 1/3 c. and stirred, which was just enough to moisten and prevent it from being runny.  Yum!  So quick and no mess to clean up!

Green Bean Casserole is something that I've enjoyed for years. One thing that I do change on occasion is using frozen green beans instead of canned. My mother seems to like that since it makes it less mushy.

Eh, not too good. I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving, and we ended up throwing most of it out. I used french green beans and extra onions, but I didn't even like it. I'm not sure what's different from the usual GB casserole, but this isn't it.

This turned out runny, but it was probably my fault.  I didn't mix any fried onions INTO the casserole, I only put some on top.  Maybe if I had put some in, they would've soaked up some of the milk.  Otherwise, it was very tasty!

Maybe this kind of casserole just isn't for me. It turned out OK. I used canned French-cut green beans (no salt added), 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cut sour cream, and went heavy on the fried onions. Love those fried onions! But I think I'd rather eat fried onions and green beans separately. This dish was just a little bland and the texture a little too mushy for my taste.

I really enjoyed this.  I made it for my boyfriend's and his roommates to heat up.  I added some parmesean cheese to it, and it definitely needs salt.  One thing I will do next time is make sure the beans are completely drained.  This recipe was nice and easy, and is great to make ahead of time for people that aren't really kitchen savvy...that way all they have to do is bake!

Made this for 20 people, only 14 showed, and it was gone! No leftovers; everyone loved it! Perfect everytime. Just make sure the onions on top get crispy ~ that's when its the best! Will make this one again and again. Easy on the wallet too.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my husband's family.  We're living in Central America and I had difficulty finding some of the ingredients, but substitutions still made this an incredible side-dish!  I couldn't find cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of onion instead.  I didn't have French fried onions, but they did have at the grocery store bags of the onion-flavored ring (in the potato chip aisle).  I wasn't expecting my husband to eat the side dish as he is not a big onion fan, but even he loved it!

It lacked a little flavor. I don't know if it is me, or if it is the recipe, but for some reason I felt it lacked in comparison to other green bean casseroles I have tasted.

I added the garlic powder and onion powder (as previously suggested) and also a few dashes of soy sauce.  It was scrumptious!

Nothing spectacular.  VERY soupy even though I followed previous posters directions.  I had to add more green beans just so it wouldn't be so runny.  I'll keep looking around for a good recipe.  This was average.

Easy, easy, easy!  I didn't give it five stars since I prefer fresh veggies, but when not available, out of a can will work!  Classic American recipe.

Before I found this site, this is the only way I would eat green beans.  I personally prefer frozen green beans versus canned.

This recipe was great for its simplicity and good for its taste.  I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner this year and paired it with beef brisket and mashed potatoes.  I had to cook it at 300 because of the beef brisket, but it was still yummy!  I used the Healthy Choice cream of mushroom because it has no msg and low sodium - next time I will put more salt in the mixture before I begin baking.  Everyone enjoyed it and we had no leftovers - I will definitely make it again.

Excellent!  It was nice and creamy.  I doubled the recipe and used cream of celery soup because 2 of the guests won't eat mushrooms.  I thought the celery flavor would be too strong, but it got rave reviews.

AWESOME.  This was so good.  I also used the golden mushroom soup and this was the best green bean casserole I have ever had.  Thanks for the great recipe.  VAE
