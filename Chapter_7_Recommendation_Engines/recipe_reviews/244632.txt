This was truly delicious and savory. I skipped the cinnamon, however, I think that changes the taste a bit. I also made it with chicken breast which one would think would be dry, but still turned out juicy.

Outstanding recipe! I wouldn't change a thing. Great with a good tzatziki sauce.

This was so freaking good. Words can not do it justice. I didn't have any Aleppo pepper, so I used a mix of ancho chile and cayenne.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it is fabulous.  It has become a weekly summer staple in our house.

Delish! I only had nonfat Greek yogurt, so used that, and fortunately had Aleppo crushed pepper (found at World Market), which I think gave it a really great, different flavor. I also used boneless chicken tenders. Next time, I'll marinate some onions and tomatoes for the skewers, too. Made with a cacik recipe found on-line, mini naans (I was out of pita), turkish rice, and a cucumber/tomato/feta salad. Great meal!

Generally, Turkish recipes that involve yogurt as an ingredient utilize the yogurt as a dip or uncooked sauce.  This recipe could be served with the marinade being a dip instead which would  eliminate any charring of the surface of the chicken.

This recipe was so easy and tastes delicious. The chicken was so juicy and succulent. A simple and easy meal that was satisfying to all. I will certainly make this again.

This is the best recipe of this dish I’ve ever tasted. Two days before making this I went to a restaurant for this dish. As the taste would be fresh in my mind I decided to make it and compare. I’ve used Aleppo pepper in other dishes but could not find any in several specialty stores. I Urfa flakes which apparently very similar if darker in colour. I followed the instructions to the letter and made it with za’atar and garlic cauliflower with a fattoush side salad. Whole meal was delicious and the chicken was the star. If you like this food the follow the recipe exactly. I think you’ll be delighted with the result.

The guy's voice in the video makes me want to take hot coals from the grill and jam them into my ears. Other than that, great recipe (chicken breasts worked just fine and everything else was just as listed).

My picky 8 and 10 yr olds LOVED THIS CHICKEN!!  I only had Chobani Black Cherry Fruit on the Bottom Yogurt, so I just scraped most of the top off, and used 2 containers - it was delicious!  I used bone-in thighs, and left them whole on the grill.  Grilled on low-medium about 25 minutes, quarter-turn and flipping every 5 minutes or so. Then I made an  extra 1/2 batch of marinade (sub mayo for yogurt) to use as a delicious dipping sauce!!!! FAV!!!!!!

Gorgeous - didn't change a thing. Marinated it for about 2hrs and then cooked most of it on the BBQ and although not recommendded by Chef John I left the remainder in the fridge and grilled/broiled it the next evening and it was to die for.
thank you for this recipe.

Delectable! I put it in the oven at 220C for 20-25 minutes and it tasted as amazing and as authentic as I hoped. Didn't even bother skewering it - I just had chicken chops on the grill function in the oven.  So delicious and with really minimal effort. Will definitely be making this again!

Again, my family laughed at my "yogurt chicken" then they asked for the recipe and every time we have a get together they ask me to make it. I add a lot extra lemon juice because I prefer it tangy.

Love this recipe. Made one alteration. Substituted a cup of milk for the yogurt. Turned out awesome, my family loved it. I will be making these kebabs again.

Made this last night.... Wow!!! Amazing flavor! I'm definitely not the grillmaster in our house - I leave the grilling to the hubs - and had problems getting the meat cooked evenly on the skewers. Probably just me. I finally took the meat off the skewers.  I'll definitely make this again,  but will just leave the chicken skewer-free next time. I served it with lemon butter rice.  Fabulous!

These were so delicious! My one year old mostly non-meat eater even ate them.  Due to a picky hubs and teen son, I had to use chicken breast.  Although I was concerned about dry meat, they turned out moist and tender.  I had to use a tsp of regular table salt vs a tbs of Kosher.  Other than that, I followed the marinade and grilling as written.  Thanks for another home run, Chef John.

Delicious! I ended up using fat-free for the greek yogurt and garlic powder instead of fresh (because it's what I had) and it was still delicious!! Highly recommend. I want to try this on ribs next.

As always, Chef John does not disappoint. This was excellent. I actually served it with the Easy Curry Couscous recipe by Janis P. Call me crazy but the flavours went together well and I was proud of myself as everyone raved. I made these kebabs exactly as written with no variations and turned out super.  I did not have the Aleppo red pepper flakes and could not find them so I went online and made a version that had equal parts sweet paprika and cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt and that turned out great. Thanks again for a great recipe. Yummy is all I can say on this one.

I've made this multiple times now. Sometimes substituting  breast strips or tenders but the thighs are best. The skewering for "kebabs" is pretty unnecessary.
 The flavor is amazing! Be careful to stay light on the cinnamon and you will not be disappointed! 
 This is a great dish, a new favorite for chicken, and I will definitely continue to make this in the future.

This is a sensational recipe and a family favourite now. 

I usually make double, reduce the red pepper but add chili flakes. I don't use skewers, grill or bbq. They turn out really well on a very lightly sprayed non stick frypan, still with the charcoal crunch & taste. 

I also find if refrigerated correctly, the raw chicken can remain in the marinade up to 3 days. Just take out what you need to cook at the time. 

Marinating another batch for dinner as I type this! :D

This marinade was great. I didn't have greek yogurt so used sour cream in its place. I also used the juice of a whole lemon as it is a favorite flavor. Lastly, I just left the chicken thighs whole and grilled them that way instead of skewering them. Served them with greek salad and greek-style potato wedges. I will definitely be making this again.

We followed the recipe exactly. My husband was not excited when he heard there was yogurt in the marinade, but we both LOVED it! We made it into a pita sandwich with the tomatoes and cucumbers. YUMMY! We will definitely be making this one again.

We loved this.  I tripled the recipe and used both thighs and breasts. I put each meat on their own skewers so I could manage the grill time.  All came out delicious.  Family loved this.  Served with lavash bread, tzatziki and grilled haloumi.

Oh my gosh. Made exactly as is and it was delicious! Something different than the usual dinners. I loaded up the skewer so I’d have leftovers so it took mine some extra time to cook. Did skewers of veggies and put them on the top bun rack. Put them all on at the same time and everything finished at the same time. Yum

This is excellent!  I don’t like thighs so cut breasts into strips and marinaded them all day.  I then threaded the strips onto 2 scewers just like the video shows.  After grilling; the  meat was incredibly tender and flavorful.  Served with basmati rice and naan for the best dinner in quite a while.  Oh yeah I couldn’t find Aleppo so used ancho chili powder instead.

My only change to the recipe was to eliminate the salt. Marination time was 4 to 5 hours. My wife, who is from the Middle East, couldn't believe how delicious this dish came out. I think the key ingredients are Aleppo pepper and ground cumin.
I will definitely make it again since it is so easy to put together.

Great tasting marinade.  I kept some aside, as per another review, to use for dipping the cooked chicken.  I skinned my chicken thighs, but was too lazy to debone them, so just flattened them as much as I could to even out the thickness.  They took a little longer to grill, but were moist and very tasty. 
We also don't like a lot of heat, so only used 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes and found that just right for our tastes.  Thanks Chef John, for yet another fantastic recipe!

This recipe was a huge hit with the family.  I added less lemon and cinnamon and substituted coconut yogurt for a non dairy version and it was extremely flavorful and moist.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Used tomato paste instead of ketchup and I doubled the cumin and paprika. I also added an extra tsp of chili flakes since Aleppo peppers are pretty mild. They came out wonderful

My family enjoyed this chicken, recipe followed almost as written.... I accidentally bought fat free yogurt. Thinking it might make a difference, at least to my taste buds, I'm going to give it another try with whole milk yogurt.  I loved the flavor even with fat free; just want to see if it's better using whole milk version

I followed the recipe very closely with the exception of the Aleppo chili. My plan was to swap the Aleppo chili for Ancho chili but I picked up a New Mexico chili seasoning which was a blend of several spice.  The chicken still turned out great.  It was loved by all who tasted it.  It will be added to family fav rotation!  I did watch the video and followed all Chep John's tips.

Love this recipe. I make it all the time, except I skip the cinnamon.  I actually make it with chicken breast instead of thighs and it is still so tender.

We made almost exactly as is, only swapping the 2 tbsp of ketchup with 1 tbsp each of ketchup and sambal sauce.  Favorite grilled chicken bt far, and we've made a lot.

Our family LOVES this chicken recipe! It is perfect just the way it is. It made it into our family cookbook after the first time and continues to be a popular request.  I don't know if you'll ever read this review, dear Chef John. But I love you!  Love, love, love, love you and your fantastically dry sense of humor.

Amazing - served it for some foodies with a high end Russian River Pinot Noir, and everyone wanted a second helping.  I couldn't find aleppo peppers, so I used dried ancho chilies and additional sweet paprika.  I added about twice the chilies than it calls for because my crowd likes some heat.  I cooked it low and slow to make sure the chicken in the middle got done.  It was delicious - but don't skip the cinnamon, it makes this dish!
