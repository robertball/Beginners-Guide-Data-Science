I do not have a bread machine, so this is what I did: I warmed up the milk enough to still be able to put my finger in it without burning it. Then, I put the milk, sugar and active dry yeast(used instant)into a food prcessor, and let it rest until bloomed. I then added the rest of the ingredients, mixing slowly while adding the flour a little at a time. I increased the speed until the dough was soft, smooth and well kneaded. I removed from processor and kneaded a little by hand with a little flour. I then lightly oiled a bowl and turned the dough inside to make contact all over with the oil. Covered with towel, and let it double in size in a warm place.
(can also do it in the fridge overnight). I then cut chunks of dough and formed into balls and placed in greased pan. (I actually grease thick aluminum foil that I line the pan with for easy cleanup!). Covered again with towel and let rise about 30 more minutes or so. I did not butter the tops, since they are already well oiled from the bowl! Baked in 350 oven for about 20 minutes(10 minutes was not nearly enough!). They came out so fluffy, beautifully golden, and absolutely delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

it's my favorite buns recipe now. I don't have a bread machine or a mixer or even a biscuit cutter , I used instant yeast (to save more time )and I just mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and then I kneaded the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic then I Placed the dough into a well oiled bowl, and covered with a cloth. Let the dough rise until double; this should take about 45 min. I made 10 large buns by Dividing the dough into 10 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly and brush with melted butter. Cover, and let rise for 30 minutes.

Sorry, I'm going to be a nay-sayer on this recipe... WAAAAAY too much sugar!  No wonder people say their kids love them!  These have more sugar than most SWEET ROLL recipes on this site!  I usually try to make a recipe as it is written when I first try it, but I had already started it when I saw how much sugar it called for, so I was already committed!  So, this time... I changed the recipe by cutting the sugar from 4T to 1T and they were still too sweet for us, but we don't eat sugary foods.  I also used kosher salt, so upped the salt a smidge and it was not enough.  Next time, I will cut the sugar to 1t and will up the salt to 2t kosher salt and try again.  They rose quite nicely and baked up well, just too sweet!  Instead of 18 rolls, I made 9 large ones, formed by hand. I also, instead of buttering them before the rise, made an egg wash and slathered it on before I baked them... and topped them with sesame seeds.  I will use the basic recipe again with my changes to make 5 star rolls!

OMG! These are so good and easy!  Ok, the only thing different that I did was; used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  Only because I ran out yesterday, and really didn't want to go to the store.  So, I figured what is the worst that can happen..?  

I really liked them with the all-purpose flour and will try them again using bread flour.  You need to try them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these to hold sloppy joes and my family LOVED them.  I only used half of the dough because it's just the three of us here.  I put the other half in the freezer for later use, and I'm glad I did!  Soft, tasty, and held up under the sloppy joes really well.  When I made them, I used 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of beer.    I can tell you that even w/out the small amount of beer these would have been awesome!

Very good! But using the biscuit cutter made them more the size of dinner rolls. Next time, I will cut 14 large squares out of this amount of dough to make hamburger buns.

This is a great recipe...my family loved these buns!  I followed the recipe exactly and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and they came out perfect.  Very easy to work with, I let them rise a little longer than 40 min.  I will be making these again and again!

I think I'm in love with this recipe.  That's saying a lot coming from a novice bun baker!  This is actually the second bun recipe that I've tried on this site and I think I'm going to stop searching.  These are sooooo good.  I brushed tops with melted butter then added a variety of toppings like sesame seeds, poppy seeds and pizza spices.  Yummy!  Thanks for posting this great recipe!

These are good, but I ended up with a large number of them.  I guess once I get started with a rolling pin I have a hard time stopping.  Anyway, they ended up more the size of biscuits.  I subbed 1 c of ww flour for 1 c of the white so I ended up with a soft bun that still has some wheat in it.  Thanks!

I loved the taste of these, but as I'm just learning how to make bread without the aid of the machine, I messed the rising up a little bit, and they ended up too small. No doubt these will be fantastic when I finally get it right!

A 'go to' recipe all year long, but especially in the summer to take camping. So much better than store bought. I make two batches, one for hot dog buns, one for burger buns. Works well on the dough cycle in the bread machine.

I made these to put sloppy joes on tonight, but my daughter and I just snuck a corner off of one, and these are good just plain.  I used my bread machine to make the dough, so this recipe was fairly easy to do.  I just made them into balls, and let them rise and then baked.  Will definitely make again.  Store bought hamburger buns don't even compare.

These were great!  Tasted and had the texture of Sister S******'s frozen dinner rolls!!!!  I took another poster's advice and divided into 14 parts to make bigger rolls, and they were the perfect size for homemade barbeque sandwiches.   My only advice, after done baking and cooled, I flipped the rolls and put them back in the over to dry out the bottoms so they wouldn't stay soggy.  I guess an alternative would be to put them on a wire rack, but I forgot about it and had to rescue the soggy buns.    Very good recipe, soft dough was perfect to work with.

This recipe worked great I love using the bread machine to make dough, it is so eay. I ate the buns with hamburgers so I wish I would have made them a little bit bigger, but they still tasted very good. I didn't have bread flour so I used 3 1/4 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and they still turned out great. I didn't have a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter either, so I cut both sides out of a 2 1/2 inch tin can. That seemed to do the trick. Great versatile bun.

Very good recipe. I did cut the sugar to 2 tbs based on reviews but next time I will use 3 tbs.   I used the bread machine then as other reviewers suggested I rolled the dough into balls, set on the cookie sheet to rise again, then baked. It worked great this way and saved the step of rolling out the dough.   I made a sheet of 8 small rolls for sandwiches for my kids and a sheet of 4 large burger buns for the freezer.

I have been searching for a good roll for sandwiches and finally found it. These rolls are by far the tastiest and easiest ever. I also do not have a breadmaker, but my Kitchen Aid mixer stepped up to the plate. I did a bit different - warmed the milk and added 1/2 the sugar and the yeast. Bloomed 15 minutes. While it bloomed I sifted the flour, warmed the butter and mixed the egg. Then I put everything in the mixer (1/2 flour now, 1/2 later). I let the mixer knead the dough for 10 minutes on low speed.  After that I put it in a bowl, covered and let rise 1 1/2 hr. Then cut into 10 pieces (I like big rolls) and followed the recipe thereafter.  I should have posted this a few months ago because I've been making them every week. They are really the best rolls I've eaten - much better than store bought. Thanks so much.

These came out very good.  We ate 1/2 of them during the week for lunch and froze 1/2 since there are only the two of us at home.  Easy to make although they came out smaller than I expected.  Next time I will use a bigger cutter.

I liked this recipe, and I will definitely make it again.  When making hamburger buns....  For CARB-crazy people...Use half the sugar and roll out at half an inch or thinner!  It makes a nice thin low-carb bun so you don't feel like you ate the whole farm!

These were very good as is. I did make another batch with rice milk and egg substiute (EnerG) and they were still delicious and only very slightly smaller. I would have given this a 5 star, but it used up so much milk. Especially with the rice milk being $14/gallon.

I'm sorry, these were fluffy, but there was tooooo much sugar.  I'm not a health nut.  I drink soda and eat candy. I've noticed there are many other bun recipes without any sugar, so I would think cutting it down on this one would make for an awesome recipe.

My only change was to use 1/2 whole wheat flour. I thought they turned out great (except I was not so good at shaping hot dog buns! For the kind of rise I got with whole wheat flour I think they should have been about 1" thick by about 2" wide). Still, they had a lovely light texture and tasted great.

These were so good as Hamburger Buns for our supper last night... Not sure what that one bad review meant by them being too sweet... They were PERFECT and so easy!  The ONLY thing I did differently was cut them a bit larger so they'd fit the big patties we made.  Thanks Lesa for a great recipe! :)

This is a wonderful recipe for homemade buns. I have made buns before but this is the best bread machine recipe yet. I did have a slight problem with the amount of milk and flour. I had to add a little more flour instead of milk but it could have been me not being careful with the exact amount of each. I still think it is great and will be more attentive when I make it again,which I will definitely do.

I love how easy these rolls are.  My girls love how yummy it is.  I don't bother with the biscuit cutters.  My two daughters and I just grab chunks of dough and roll them with our hands.  I love the way they make the whole house smell like fresh baked bread.  Everyone is anxious waiting for them to come out of the oven.  My kids devour these in about 2 days.  So good!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe!  I don't have a bread machine so I followed what Mariam did and the buns just came out amazing.  Note: I only put in 2T of sugar as many reviewers said the buns were too sweet - also the buns rose more 'up' than 'out' so I let my rolls rise, flattened them a bit and then let them rise again for about 10 minutes.  Before baking, I used a sharp knife to cut 2-3 slits on top of the buns and then egg washed them and sprinkled with sesame and poppy seeds.    I should mention that the buns were not very big and I got 10 plus 1 mini one.  Again, I followed Mariam's format and rolled the dough into balls instead of rolling it out and using a cutter to shape them.    The buns are very light - just what I've been looking for!      I don't think I'll have to buy store-bought buns again!

This is an outstanding recipe.  My husband is allergic to certain kinds of bread and he loves hamburger and sloppy joes.  So finding this recipe was wonderful..  I made these and he loves them.  They keep very well. This is a keeper.

I can not say enought good things about this recipe! I followed directions and made in the bread machine.  I divided the dough in half.  With one half I rolled and cut with a biscuit cutter.  the other half, I just made balls (a little nuts I weighted each ball with a kitchen scale to make equal).  could not tell the difference once baked.  So, i will just roll into balls when i make them from now on.  And I will be making these once a week or so from no on.  My kids loved them.

These are truly delicious! You know a bun is good when it is delicious with just butter! Yum! Yum! I only had traditional yeast so I proofed it in 1/4 cup hot water for 10 minutes and only used a cup of warm milk instead... I also used all-purpose flour instead of the bread flour. I also just formed them into buns with my hands rather than roll them out. I will definitely continue to use this recipe.

I brushed with egg/water prior to rise and half way through baking for a more crusty outside. We used them for French Dip sandwiches and it was perfect. Def will make again.

Amazing! I agree that they have too much sugar to use consistently, but I think I'll try and cut it down next time. I'm also going to try them whole wheat. But as a treat they were fantastic.

Made them exactly as written (except I used all-purpose flour rather than bread flour) the first time. They came out smaller and harder than I would have liked, more like hard(er) dinner rolls as some others have said. The next time, I made the following changes: 1. Used whole milk rather than 2% (which I had done the first time); 2. Used shortening rather than butter in the dough - which I melted into the milk; 3. Used 3.5 C bread flour rather than 3.75 C all-purpose; 4. Brushed light olive oil over the tops rather than butter; 5. Instead of rolling them and using a cutter to make 18, I divided the dough (by just eyeballing) into 12 equal-ish chunks, and formed them - by hand - into slightly flattened spheres. They came out PERFECT!!! For those of you getting dinner rolls instead of sandwich buns, try some of the above changes. (Disclaimer: I live at 1,200 m / 4,000 ft of elevation; this may affect things.)

Perfect!  I don't have a bread machine, so I had to do it all by hand, and they still came out splendid.  In fact the guest that I served had no idea that they were homemade!  They thought they came from the deli.

Love this recipe.  I made exactly as written.  After taking the dough out of the bread machine, I divide the dough in half.  Make half into buns and place the other half in a zip lock bag.  I then put the bag into the refridge.  I have left as long as three days and still worked beautifully.  When I take the dough out of the refridge I make cinnamon rolls from it.  Very simple.  Roll dough into a rectangle, butter rectangle and sprinkle buttered area with sugar and cinnamon.  Roll the rectangle using the short edge to form a tube shape.  I then cut using denatal floss into sections .  Place into a greased round cake pan and place cut sections with a space between.  Cover and let rolls rise in a warm place.  Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 13 minutes gage time per your oven.  When done baking cool slightly and glaze with a simple powdered sugar glaze.  My son loves these so much that he said he would eat every day.  Excellent combo recipe!!  Next will try making Hot Dog buns from this recipe.  Thanks!

Oh my gosh were these great! Used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, cut the sugar in half and added a couple squirts of honey. Used my new KA mixer and amazed my son. Thanks for the great recipe Lesa, and thanks Mariam for adapting the recipe from bread machine to mixer/processor. Can't wait to make 'em in small size for Thanksgiving.

I was looking for a good bun for sloppy joes, and these were excellent.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, although one half of the dough I shaped into a baguette and the other half I made 12 buns out of.  All turned out beautifully and I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This is my first sandwich bun recipe so I really have nothing to compare it to other than other basic "roll" recipes - this recipe was good, but not as great as the reviews led me to believe. I will definitely try a couple of other recipes on the site to see how they all compare.

I make all of our breads and rolls, and have a lot of recipes, this is totally worth trying and keeping. It makes great lady finger rolls too, for a party or pot luck. My only change is to add 1 T gluten per cup of flour, because I use regular flour, not bread flour.

OH MY GOSH!!  These turned out Great!!!  I did scale it down to six, as we just needed a few last night.  It called for 3/8 of an egg, so I used the whole egg, which meant I needed to add addition flour, but they turned out great, very forgiving.  Will definitely be making these again and again!!!  Thanks Lesa!!

Really nice buns. Scaled down the sugar a bit and didn't bother with the butter on top but they were still nice and froze really well, but there was an odd flavour somewhere may have been the milk powder.

I did add one more egg. I find that where you live in the world even determines how soft or fluffy they are! If you live in a really humid area then chances are they will be fluffy. Although I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada & it is very dry! Just a suggestion!

These are the best rolls I have ever made.  They were light and fluffy like the store bakery rolls. I have tried numerous rolls on this site and they always seem to be more on the dense and heavy side.  I can't wait to make these for grilling season this year.

yummy! very easy to make. I used 2Tbsp of honey instead of sugar, and 100% whole wheat instead of white flour.  If you use Honey add a bit more flour

MAKE THESE BUNS.

Seriously, this is the recipe. Just stop looking and make them already. I've made a few other recipes and some of them were fine, but this is AWESOME. Make them and you won't regret it. I let them rise probably longer than one hour (but not by too much, I think) next to the stove where I was cooking sloppy joes, and mmmm. Perfect. They're just sweet enough to be delicious, perfectly bubbly, rise up nicely, fluffy and tasty and just dense enough to hold and not get soggy. Not get soggy with sloppy joes! And yet it's deliciously chewy!

These were great. I made them for BBQ pork sandwiches. The only problem I had was that when I re-rolled the scraps after I cut out the first round of dough, the re-rolled ones were lumpy, not smooth like the first ones. They were still delicious, though. So, I would suggest getting as many buns out of the first rolling as possible.

Awesome! Used them for sloppy joes, and they came out great and held up well with the messiness. Instead of rolling/cutting them, I just pinched the buns off the dough and let them rise. They were yummy!!! Thank you! Definitely making again!

I loved the way the bread consistency during rising, however I think next time I will not roll out with biscuit cutter. I will portion them instead. I agree way too much sugar, which could be cut back. Be careful how much though because the yeast feeds off the sugar to rise.

Made these today to go with the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken recipe I was making. I made a 1/2 batch and ended up with 6 small-to-medium rolls (about 4" wide, 3-4" tall). They are nice and soft, and medium density.

I didn't have a thermometer, so I warmed the milk on the stove until it was warm (but not hot) when I put my finger in. It just needed to be warm to let the yeast rise - high temperatures kill the yeast - and it worked perfectly.

I threw some dough in the freezer too. Will report back on whether that works out.

We love these!  I don't use a bread machine, but they turn out great by hand:?)  I reduce the salt to 1/2 t. and the sugar to 1/3 c. for our tastes:?)  I've made them in a few different sizes to suit their use.  Highly recommend!  Nearly never buy store buns now!

I am not a good bread maker even with the bread machine....so today i decided to try Buns instead. The only change...I used. unbleached all purpose flour (it's all I had)....however I have never even seen buns being made before so i stretched out the dough with my hands and rolled it into balls. I only made 6 buns had no idea how big they would rise lol ......i baked them about 25 mins in 350 oven.  I was worried they would be tough I thought I played around with them too much....BUT THEY WERE FANTASIC.....a bit on the large side so I will know better next time!!!!
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A RECIPE I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE :)

I've made these twice now, and they came out perfect both times.  The first time I made them following exact recipe directions, the second time I added 1 tbsp of honey and then made dinner rolls by putting the dough in a muffin tin and baking.  Absolutely wonderful!  Highly recommended.

Love these sandwich buns.  My husband eats them as a roll with butter.  My favorite way to eat them is with a hamburger patty, pepperjack cheese and chipolte mayonnaise.  You could also add a little red onion and lettuce, but doesn't need it.  They are also easy to make, the hardest part is waiting for them to rise.

This is a keeper! I decreased the sugar to 3 Tbsp but will only use 2 next time, as it's still too sweet. Also did not roll them out or brush tops w/butter. I made 16, and they are a perfectly sized dinner roll. For sandwiches, I'll make only 12. These rolls have a wonderfully soft texture, yet seem to have sufficient body to hold up as a sandwich roll. Great right out of the oven with butter!

Great!  I made these in my KA mixer & let them rise the 2nd time, uncovered in a warm oven.  For some reason I would always deflate my bread when I would take off the towel after the 2nd rise so now I just let it rise uncovered.  I subbed AP flour & used a little less than called for & yielded 8 good size buns.  They have just a slight sweetness  but I would never call them sweet.  Delicious!

These buns were wonderful!  My family loved them, even my little grandchildren.  I'm going to make this recipe every time I make sloppy joes because they don't fall apart from the juciness of the sloppy joes.  Next time I'm going to try putting sesame seeds on top.

Awesome!  My go-to recipe has always been Vienna Rolls (from the Joy of Cooking), but I think I've just been converted!  My husband asked me to find a recipe for sandwich buns that were softer than the Vienna Rolls tend to be.  This was the first recipe I came across and I will look no further!  I used part whole wheat and just regular all-purpose flour, as I didn't have any bread flour.  I also don't have a bread machine so just did these by hand.  Delicious!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I've tried a couple of different roll recipies and this was my family's favorite.  After the first time making, I did cut the sugar in half.  I also subbed 2 cups of whole wheat flour for 2 of the ap flour.  I also made 12 servings instead of the 18 listed.  This makes the perfect sized hamburger rolls. This will be my go-to recipe for sandwhich and hot dog rolls.  Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty and soft. They are a sweeter roll but they went great with the Sloppy Joes II recipe from this site. Next time I might try to reduce the sugar just for a healthier version. Still soft and tasty the next day. TY!

My family is not over fond of sweet bread, so I cut the sugar down to just one teaspoon.  Cut dough into 9 equal pieces, used 8 to make the bread rolls, then rolled the last piece to make the edge.  finished with the melted butter and poppy seeds for the center.

Instead of making sandwich buns, I made four jumbo hoagie rolls to pair with the Meatball Sandwich from this site.  I subbed water for milk and made this bread by hand - allowing for two 1 hour rise times.  The resulting buns were good, but a bad choice to pair with the meatball recipe.  My husband has suggested that I try these again as buns for chicken sandwiches or maybe sloppy joes.

Very good! We used it for hoagies and also sloppy joes, and both were yummy. They do come out pretty small using the biscuit cutter though. Will try with a bigger one next time to see if that gets them the right size.

These rolls were great! One thing that I did to help with the second rise is; I turned the over on 200 degrees right before the bread machine beeped to signal that it was done...once it was warm I turned it off and proceeded to roll the dough out. I did not follow as the recipe says to flatten it out and cut, instead I rolled out separate buns, and then flattened them into disks...(for those of you who own a scale, each roll weighed approximately 3oz (though I did end up with a teeny ball that had to be thrown out)).  I was able to make 11 nice sized rolls with weighing them out.  So, after I rolled them out and placed them on a greased cookie sheet, I placed them in the _now_ off oven and let them rise for 45 minutes, once 45 minutes were up, I turned the oven on and left them in the oven--this helps with a nice "oven spring" they fluff up nicely when you use this method! I wouldn't change anything about this..this is definitely a keeper.

These are amazing, I make them just about every week! I make them into hoagie shaped buns and use them for meatball subs, or buffalo chicken sandwhiches, burgers, anything! They really are great, people always ask where I bought them, they always ask for the recipe, thank you so much!

A very good recipe, though it was entirely too sweet for my liking. The family LOVED it! I added 4 t whole wheat gluten to the recipe as well to make it extra stretchy and fluffy. I made another batch with only a few T sugar and was much more to my taste! Thank you for this recipe!!

These were awesome.  I used wheat bread flour for 3/4's of a cup of it.  As I was rolling out the dough I sprinkled sesame seeds on the top and rolled them into the dough a bit before cutting out.  I made them bigger so that I could use them for hamburger buns.  They were the best hamburger buns I've ever eaten.  I used them to made guacamole bacon burgers.  What was also great is that I had one bun left over and I used it 2 days later and it was still nice and fresh.

These were delicious. I made them to hold the "Delicious Egg Salad for Sandwiches" from this site. My buns did not brown properly, so I re-buttered the tops and placed them under the broiler (low in the oven) which worked fine. I think I will try the egg wash the next time, as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for a keeper.

These turned out so good!  I used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 bread flour and added a tsp of lemon juice (I always add lemon juice to my bread).  They came out big and soft and were the perfect compliment to my grilled chicken for making sandwiches.

I love this recipe! Its so simple to make, even for a bread novice like me. I took the other suggestions and cut the sugar down to 1 TBSP and there is just enough sweet.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is in order to get 18 buns, they are slider size. I can usually get 8-10 good size buns from this.

These were fantastic!!  Great for dinner rolls, but need to cut down on sugar if using for sandwich rolls.  They were too sweet and made sandwiches taste funny.  This is a keeper for me!!  Thank you for sharing!  God Bless!

I loved these!!! I had never made bread before in my life but I decided today was the day I tried. I found this recipe and tried it out. I don't own a bread maker so I did everything by hand. I made a couple of changes though... I thought it was too much sugar so I cut it by half and double the salt. Once they were baked, they actually tasted like store-bought buns. I was absolutely amazed! Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was a great recipe! It's definitely the best sandwich bun recipe I have found. I made a smaller first batch and they were gone by the end of the night! My family loved them for sandwiches and also just buttered! Wonderful recipe as is.

Made these for chicken sandwiches. My husband loved them. I also made buns a bit larger than golf ball sized and I diced onions to put on top of some of the buns and just a little bit of shredded cheese to put on top of the rest. Very good recipe

Delicious!  I use my breadmaker all the time to make dough for rolls but I'm never totally satisfied with them as sandwich rolls, just dinner rolls.  But this recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed rolls to use for pulled pork sandwiches and this recipe was perfect.  Another keeper!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and thanks to the latest midatlantic snowstorm, I had the opportunity.  The ingredients are assembled easily in a matter of minutes.  The dough rolls and cuts effortlessly.  I decreased the sugar to 2 Tablespoons as others had recommended, and the taste was perfect!  I made mine slightly larger and got a yield of 15. Next time I think I will make them even bigger.  Tried them with burgers and tuna salad, and they were delicious with both!!!  This recipe is a keeper which I will definitely make again.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and the buns turned out a little sweeter than what we would have liked. Then the next time, I reduced the sugar to 1 heaping tablespoon, and made them by hand instead of using a cookie cutter (because I found that process a bit troublesome), and the result was AMAZING! Definitely the best sandwich buns I have ever had in my entire life! I made a few individual buns, and a big cluster in a 9-inch cake pan, and sprinkled some white sesame seeds on top of them after generously brushing them with butter - they were scrumptious! Try some toppings on them! You won't regret it!

Amazing, I ate them and was shocked! I used all-purpose flour, added a little olive oil to the batter, added only 1/2c extra flour than what the recipe states while kneading by hand (initially kneaded 3 cups in food processor) and let rise for about 7 hours, LOL long story. 350F for 15 minutes or light brown. I only got 11 small buns, so will probably double the recipe next time to get 12 big buns for hamburgers. Can't wait to make it again.

I let the dough rise for a little more than an hour. I got stiff dinner rolls. I'm starting to think I'm not cut out to make bread. It just doesn't work for me. Maybe my yeast was old.

My husband loves stuffed buns. This recipe works great for the buns. I don't have a bread machine, so, I used ingredients as in this recipe (no butter) but followed the usual method of soaking the yeast in warm water (1/2 cup), mixing wet ingredients (room temperature) together and then adding dry ingredients to it. I needed almost a cup more of flour to get a good consistency, probably because of the water I used with the yeast. Once I divided the dough to bun size, I stuffed them with a potato and spice filling and let them rise. I lightly sprayed them with cooking oil, sprinkled a few sesame seeds on top. Looked awesome. We had a gathering and everyone loved them!

These were good buns, good flavor, not overly sweet, just not quite what I was expecting.  My boys ate them right up, though!

Wow!!  I don't even know what to say.  I made these to go with sloppy joes, and sloppy joes will now never be the same.  This recipe is incredible.  I followed the recipe exactly but used a 3 inch biscuit cutter.  I got 12 buns, and with remaining dough I made 6 mini cinnamon rolls.  My buns baked for 18 minutes on a Pampered Chef stone.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Made these for BBQ sandwiches. Instead of cutting I rolled them into balls before letting them rise. They were good. Soft, a little bit sweet, a little yeasty tasting, but not overwhelmingly so. Thanks!

I must've done something wrong since I'm the first one to give a bad review, but I honestly can't figure out what. I don't have a bread machine but I've made tons of bread machine recipes from this site the traditional way and never had problems. These buns would not bake evenly. The tops wouldn't brown but the bottoms got too dark, even though I rotated them. They were too dry and also became very hard the next day. The texture was more like dinner rolls rather than sandwich buns, so I would not use these for burgers and such. I don't know, maybe this is just one of those recipes that only works well with a bread machine. Anyone else have problems?

We use these as both sandwich buns and hamburger buns (making less, but bigger buns) ... we no longer buy buns.  My family is spoiled by this wonderfully soft bun!

Just as stated "soft" buns. I have made these 3 times in a week and they turned out wonderful every time. What a great idea to roll out and cut. I have formed buns for 40 years the old fashioned way but I have changed my ways to this.

This is very good sandwich buns.  The only thing is, it is slightly sweet. Almost like those asian buns you find at the asian cafes.  I wouldn't use these for burgers because of the sweetness.  This would be great if you wrapped a hotdog and baked it for the kids!

Very soft and squishy buns.  A definitely keeper.  My DD loves these buns with chicken salads.
