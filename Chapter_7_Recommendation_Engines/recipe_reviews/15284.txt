This "white sauce" was made famous at Big Bob Gibson's BBQ in North Alabama.  Several things are left out in this recipe such as horseradish and apple cider vinegar.  Let it sit for a few hours to overnight and it really melds the taste.

I am from Decatur, Al where this recipe originated from. The original recipe is to use miracle whip instead of the mayo, and leave out the sugar. Be sure to put in lots of black pepper too.

I have eaten this sauce only in select BBQ restaurants in North Alabama.  We don't live there anymore and can't find white BBQ anywhere!  This is a wonderful taste of home.

Excellent - I've never had a mayo based BBQ sauce before but wanted to try some and am glad I did - I would cut down on the pepper a bit but other than that very good and worth trying.

This sauce is incredible.. the trick is to make it up..put it in the fridge and dont touch it for at least 24 to 36 hours..it takes that long for the flavors to mingle..if you taste it too early it is awful and too sweet.  I did make it with 4 packages of splenda instead of sugar..I found that I like making a bowl of salad, adding a pile of bbq brisket on top, and using this as the salad dressing also

This sauce is great! Not only is it a great BBQ sauce, it's wonderful on baked potatoes, as a dipping sauce for fresh veggies, and it's also good as a dipping sauce for steaks and chicken!

I've never had the original in Alabama. All I can say is, as a lover of BBQ sauce, this is really unique and good. It's a new staple in my BBQ sauce rotation.

Steam some chunks of redskinned potatoes, then marinate them in this sauce for several hours or overnight.  Thread on skewers and grill until warm and browned. Great with any meat.

This turned out very, very good. The dipping part the family wasn't into but once it hit the meat and the flavors melded it was exceptional. I left mine in the fridge overnight before using.

I too am from Decatur, Al and grew up with white sauce being the number one choice for bbq. I go to big bob's (which was on good eats on the food network) at least once a week and this sauce is not exactly like theirs but pretty similar. If anybody wants to try some of their sauce they sell it on their website.

I really like this as a baking sauce for chicken and have even used it as a dipping sauce for sweet bell peppers and cucumbers.  I love it's versatility.  I always keep it in the fridge for the many uses it has.  Thanks for sharing this one.

This came out very thin although it sat for over a day.  My husband added horseradish, but overall, we did not care for it. We love it in a local restaurant, but this really did not compare.

I used this recipe to make White BBQ chicken salad for a ladies luncheon and it was a big hit with everyone going back for seconds.  I halved the recipe then I cooked 5 chicken breasts in my crock pot in chicken broth until they were so tender they shredded easily with a fork.  I added the (halved) sauce and a few ribs of celery cut up then baked it at 300 for about 20 minutes the night before the luncheon.  The next day I pulled it out of the fridge an served it with Hawaiian sweet rolls.  P.S. I used real mayo not Miracle Whip as some have suggested.

WOW!  This stuff is good!  I made the sauce as directed and used it on chicken and grilled it.  The chicken was so tender and awesome!  I think the only thing I would change is to add a little bit of horseradish to the mix like others have suggested.  I saved some in the fridge.  I got it out last night and drizzled it over fish and made a packet for the grill, SO GOOD!!  The sauce gets even better after it sits a while!

This became an instant staple in my refrigerator! Everyone loved it, especially my daughter!
I keep it in a fliptop bottle so I can use it at the grill and the table without worrying about contamination.
Love it!

I made this on monday.  It was soooo good.  I did play with it a bit, added some garlic powder and also put a bit of liquid smoke in it.  We loved it. Grilled some chicken with it and also served it with the chicken.  Yummy!

A family favorite.  SO good on grilled chicken wings.  I used on slow-cooked country style ribs instead of "red" sauce.  Every bit as good!

Oh Good LAND was this awful.  I made it as instructed and I did not care for it.  I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for an hour. My husband, who will eat just about anything, also did not care for it.

I am from Decatur, AL where we love our White Sauce!  For those of you that this is too salty for only add 1 tblsp at a time and taste.  However I would cut the lemon juice to only 2 tblsp. and never use Miracle Whip!  Great to smoke chicken, turkey or pork.  Also a great dipping sauce.

This bbq sauce is my secret to great grilled chicken!  I always make extra sauce so I can marinade the chicken as well.  I put both the sauce and the marinating chicken in the fridge overnight to meld all the flavors.  Then I just throw the chicken on the grill, baste a little as I go, and serve the sauce on the side.  Yum!  My husband also likes to dip his chicken nuggets in this sauce!

great recipe! Serve on the side after grilling meat. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and they turned out moist and tender,I will use this again.

My daughter has to have a glutten free diet.  I was having a tough time finding a BBQ suace that would work with her diet till I came across this.  I was very tasteful and a change from the tomatoe based sauces.  I think this would be great on alot of other meats too.

Good stuff! I replace the white vinegar with equal amount of Chiavetta's marinade (Upstate NY staple) and it is pure awesome.

I thought this was ok.  It is not the white sauce that I know as Gibsons white sauce and I thought this sauce was too salty.

Let it sit 3 days after making.  This is a weird sauce but it's weird in a good way.  Won't replace regular red BBQ but it's a nice alternative.  Soaked some pork chops for about an hour and basted as they grilled.  Quite different.  I'm sure in AL where this is from it is 1000% times better.  Just like all the other BBQ.  Wife thought it might be better for beef.  I thought maybe chicken.

Just perfect with a grilled chicken. I've found that warming over a slow flame brings the mixture and flavors together more quickly

This is the besy BBQ sauce around!  Even if you hate traditional BBQ sauce (like I do) you will love this one.  It is very flavorful and slightly tart.  Simply delicious.

I liked this one! I decided to try it after seeing a similar recipe on the Food Network. It was different, but in a good way; I scaled it way down just in case I didn't like it (hate to waste ingredients) I think that the next time I make it I will add a little more spice to it.

I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this. It was runny (even though I used regular mayo) and tasted too strong of vinegar, with a hint of mayonnaise. When I dipped the barbecued chicken in it I could hardly even taste it. I won't be making this again.

This sauce came out gross. I added several other seasonings and a splash of steak sauce to it and rescued it as a tangy dip. I'd be offended if someone served this on my bbq....

Mine turned out very thin, I don't know if it's supposed to be like that.  It was very tasty though, and the longer it sits, the better the taste, as everybody says, the flavors blend.  Also, I added horse radish like one of the other posters suggested.

This is a great recipe, I used this as a dipping sauce for beer butt chicken. I am from Alabama and it tasted just like the bbq joint's sauce around here. If you use miracle whip I would cut the amount of sugar in half, it makes it a little to sweet.

This was pretty good.  I let the sauce sit in the refrigerator all day while I was at work, then I added it off and on while I was cooking the chicken.  We used it as a dipping sauce too.

Since we BBQ several months out the year I wanted to try a different type of sauce.  This was definitely flavorful and a nice twist in place of the red based sauces.  Will use it again.

Even though I am an Alabamian, I grew up with a family bbq sauce recipe that is very much like a Carolina sauce. So, I had no problem with the vinegary taste in the sauce. I am very particular about my bbq. I dont eat bbq unless it is cooked by my pop, myself or a local bbq joint called Hot Tin Roof (they have a Carolina sauce close to ours). Having said that, I liked this sauce. It was heavy enough to hold on to the meat and has a good flavor. I prefer my own red Carolina version but this is a good change up. Not as good as the white sauce at Hot Tin Roof but they aren't sharing theirs :( My family really enjoyed this sauce as well. Thanks!

This sauce was delicious!  It was slightly thick because of the mayonnaise so it adhered well to the meat.  I added a couple chopped green onions and some hot sauce to the marinade for a bit of a kick and it worked out great.  Then I cooked the leftover sauce and drizzled it over the meat once it was done.  Yummy!!
