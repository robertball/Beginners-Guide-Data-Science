I liked the ease and quickness of this recipe. The flavor was good, better then hubby expected. I did not however like the eggs broiled , from now on using a lid and steam from the heat will be my cooking method.

Fantastic! This was easy to make and tasted great! Only thing I omitted was the onions. Will make again and again. Lots of options on what to add as well.

My husband and family really enjoyed this meal and gave my husband ideas to do with hash next time he wants hash.

My husband loves corned beef and this recipe was a huge hit!  It was very easy to get together and I loved that it all came together in one pan!  The corned beef was perfectly crispy and it is easy to cook the eggs to your liking.  I loved the top of the corned beef became even crispier once put under the broiler.  I added a few chopped green onions after taking out of the oven for a little crunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the concept of this recipe but I would prefer a homemade hash. This was way to salty for my liking.

I love this recipe.   Very flavorful and easy to make.   I'm going to make this again.   Great idea on spicing up an old favorite.

I wasn't sure what to think of the hash (looking at it in a can). I really didn't know what it would taste like either. I'm glad I tried this recipe though. I used a mini cast iron skillet, and reduced it to serve one. I don't know if I would use salt and pepper as seasoning, but I could see adding some taco seasoning. I didn't have any tomatoes with green chiles so salsa it was. I really am surprised by the simplicity and I actually liked the hash!

This is incredibly easy to put together and so flavorful.  I didn't use any salt, only pepper. I made this in individual cast iron pans. This would be great for breakfast or dinner.
