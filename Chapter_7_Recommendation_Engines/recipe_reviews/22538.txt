We eat this all the time. Here is my tip, melt the butter in a sauce pan and then add the breadcrumbs. Stir for about one minute and then put onto the Salmon. This makes the topping crunchy and the butter is more evenly spread.

Awesome! I used HoneyMustard because I was out of Dijon Mustard. Skipped the butter to save calories and baked. Everyone loved it. Wait till you taste it the day after when it's cold. Use leftovers in a salad! : )

Great!  I like more mustard than calls for---enough to coat well. I use a sweet dijon or country style dijon mustard.  Homemade bread crumbs the best--you can leave more coarse.  Broil the top if you want the coating more crunchy or spray tops with a pump butter spray such as "Can't Believe it's Not Butter" type---coats better than drizzling melted butter and therefore browns better.  My husband hates dijon mustard and still asks for this salmon dish.  It is also wonderful cold the next day for a snack or on a nice salad!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  It's a KEEPER!

I thought salmon was dry and boring until I tried this recipe. It seemed a bit mushy after baking so I broiled the top for 2 minutes and then it was perfect! I will make this frequently and try the leftovers over salad as others have suggested.

Wow!  My first time cooking salmon, and it turned out amazing--my man was impressed.  I made breadcrumbs from leftover italian bread, added some crushed slivered almonds to the top of the filets, drizzled some olive oil between them on the pan, cooked them in the oven for 13 minutes, then put them in the broiler for another 2 minutes--perfect!

Very tasty...the indgredients didn't overwhelm the salmon; it really let the flavors of the salmon come through.  Salmon also was timed perfectly and came out nice and moist.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and added a little fresh dill on top.

For a serving for two, I used two portioned salmon fillets, a combo of whole grain and dijon mustard (about a tablespoon or two of each), salt and pepper, and panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs instead of the Italian-style for extra crunch. Drizzled a little olive oil on top of the panko instead of the melted butter and baked. In my oven, it only took 5-10 minutes on 400* and a few minutes under the broiler to make the top a little crispy and golden. Great recipe- I'll be making this again.

I didn't care for this that much.  My husband and I don't like fish much so maybe that's the problem.  I used mahi mahi and low fat marg.

This is a fantastic recipe.  My husband loves it!  I am from Seattle so I know Salmon.  Anyone who thinks salmon is dry has completely ove cooked this beautiful fatty fish.

What an amazing dish!!! I used the frozen salmon filets from the freezer section, and they were just as good, also cheaper than fresh. I used spicy brown mustard (instead of dijon) and also used finely crushed multi grain crackers (instead of bread crumbs). I also added one tbsp. of worchestire sauce to the mustard. OMG this was one of my favorite foods I've eaten in my life!!! Great recipe!

For a healthier version, left out the butter and salt, coated foil with olive oil and drizzled 1 T.  olive oil over the bread crumbs sprinkled with garlic powder, and a little  oregano and patted down a little. Served with garlic mashed potatoes that were made with olive oil instead of butter. Will make this often.

Have had to recently increase my omega 3's in my diet and though I'd try this recipe.  As I am more of a texture girl, I loved the soft, moistness of the fish combined with the crunch of the topping. Mixed my bread crumbs into the melted butter and then added it to the fish for a more even distribution.  Served with Company Couscous also from AR.  Very nice dinner indeed!  Thank you ChristyJ.

Wow, is this a fantastic way to prepare salmon! I'd never baked salmon before (always grilled or broiled it), but it came out so moist and delicious. The topping was fantastic too... my husband and I love Dijon. Our 11 year-old wasn't too sure at fist, but ended up eating a whole fillet. Thank you so much for this recipe, Christine!

This was wonderful. The fish counter at my local supermarket carries boneless, skinless salmon so I lucked out! I used Italian panko breadcrumbs & instead of butter, I sprayed each fillet with olive oil from my olive oil mister. Served with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site along with green beans. So quick & easy. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

Sooo easy. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used Ritz crackers. Worked just as well. My entire family -- including the picky 9-year-old -- decided it goes on our repeat list.

I added about 1-2 tbls. of honey to the mustard and let sit on the fish for about 20 minutes.  Also for a GREAT crunchy texture I used Panko (japanese) bread crumbs. They can be found at many grocery stores.  This got rave reviews for our Salmon Sunday dinner!  My son's (age 14) had a friend over for dinner, not a big fish eater.  He ate EVERY bite!  Will make again.

I made this for my neighbors (one spouse is very sick) and I received a Thank You note from them telling me that they felt like they were eating at a 5 Star restaurant! I bought a whole 1/2 salmon at Costco, and was able to get 8 great pieces of salmon (with some left) so I cooked 8 individual meals and share as well with another neighbors, an older couple with an older son.  They also sent me a note complimenting the salmon as being a real "gourmet" treat. As for me, my hubby and daughter, we were all "wow"! what a fantastic and easy recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing - no changes made to a great recipe!! and thank you for recommending this recipe to me back in March - very much appreciated!!

It was Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the knife! I was worried the dijon would be too strong or mustardey but it wasn't. Will definitely make again (maybe with less butter)!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years. It's my wife's favorite salmon dish, and I find it tasty, as well.  As the household cook, I like the ease of preparation.  It's simple, fast and reliable. I also follow REBECCAANNE22's recommendation of melting the butter in a saucepan, and then stir in the breadcrumbs. The coating is much better because of it.

this was very good.  I did follow another reviewers advice and mixed the melted butter with the breadcrumbs.  I also, added parmesan and chopped slivered almonds to the breadcrumbs.  I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes and that was perfect!

This was great!  My husband loves salmon, but I am usually just OK with it.  I loved this recipe.  I drizzled a little honey on top before sprinkling on the bread crumbs, and I sprinkled a little parsley on top for color. Served with a boxed rice pilaf - an easy and delicious dinner.

When I made this I used smooth Dijon mustard, and then put a drop of honey (blossom type, but I guess any kind would do, just a little drop, about a teaspoon) on each fillet then the salt and pepper and then the breadcrumbs and then drizzled over the melted butter.  I'm not really big on fish but this was really tasty and I would definitely make it again.  My husband, who normally eats his dinner like someone who hasn't seen food for month, ate it slowly as he wanted to savour the flavours as he thought it was the best salmon dish he had ever had.  I served it with mashed potatoes with creme fraiche, salt and pepper and some butter, and leeks seasoned with salt and pepper and some butter.  It was really good.  Give it a go, it's quick and easy and very tasty.

Just made this for dinner - excellent!!! I skipped the butter and drizzled olive oil over the fillets instead. I'm going to use more Dijon on the thicker parts of the fillet next time, as the thinner ends of the fish had a lot more flavor than the middle.

used Honey Dijon mustard.  I subbed in Panko bread crumbs that I seasoned.  skipped the butter.  the combo of mustard and the crusty coating of the bread crumbs was excellent.  my wife and i loved it.  its simple, and it complements the salmon wonderfully.  would definitely use recipe again.

YUM! The salmon tasted SO good! This is a great recipe, though I did alter a few things. I used honey mustard instead of Dijon and I mixed the mustard with a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of basil before spreading over the salmon. I also followed the tip Rebecca's tip and melted the butter and breadcrumbs in a saucepan before putting onto the salmon. I will definitely continue using this in the future!

Incredibly moist, easy and fairly healthy.  The flavors were nice and balanced between the salmon and topping.  I used Panko crumbs and drizzled on olive oil instead of butter.  Next time I'll bake it at a lower temp so there's less albumin (the white congealed substance on cooked salmon) and then broil it for a few minutes for a crunchy top.  Ready to make it again!

New Year's resolution was to eat healthier...include more fish in our diets.  Only problem my Husband HATES fish.  So I tried this tonight.  I added a tablespoon of honey and like another reviewer butterflied the fillet and spread honey/mustard in the center as well as top.  I used only 1-1.5 tbsp. of butter to keep the recipe light.  My husband not only ate it but said he thought it was good and at the end of the meal said he would eat this a few times a month. WOW he has NEVER eaten a piece of fish that he liked before and he's 38 years old!  Quite the compliment.  Excellent recipe! P.S. my 6 year old thought it was pretty good to.  I am a salmon lover and this is my new favorite recipe.

A cook from northern NY:  This is the best salmon recipe I have tried.  I did bake it longer than the instructions:  15 minutes at 400 degrees and an additional 15 - 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was perfect!

consider a course ground mustard for a bit more texture and panko breadcrumbs for more rewarding, more crisp crust

Very tasty, definitely a keeper. 
I used two thick salmon steaks, about 8 oz each, so had the same weight as called for in the recipe.  I used only half the stated amounts of mustard, crumbs and butter, and it was just the right amount.  Plenty of mustard flavor to contrast with the rich salmon.  It is tricky to get the melted butter to "stick" to the crumbs - I sort of dripped it from the spoon, a drop at a time, and most of it soaked into the breadcrumbs.  Our salmon was quite thick so parts of it took more like 30 minutes.  Definitely a keeper with those modifications.

The salmon was moist & flaky.  I wondered if the mustard would be too overpowering a flavor but it wasn't.  I used Grey Poupon deli mustard (that has horseradish in it).  As I didn't have Italian-style dry bread crumbs, I added some parsley flakes, dried basil, garlic powder, onion powder & some grated Parmesan cheese to some plain bread crumbs.  Also after reading the reviews, I only added 2 tablespoons of melted butter to cut down on the fat.

It's hard to rate any salmon recipe less than a four star, or maybe salmon is just that good. But I don't think the dijon came thru very well. I really prefer  to use a sour cream plus dillweed or other spice to this approach.

This was AMAZING. I didn't have dijon so I mixed 2 T. honey mustard with 1 T. plain mustard. I had to bake the fish several minutes longer than it called for, maybe because my filets were so thick. We will make this often, because it's so quick and simple.

Very good. I mixed the bread crumbs with the melted butter and spread the topping over the mustard. My husband does not like salmon but he will eat it this way. I make this recipe at least once a month.

I've been making something similar to this for years.  The difference being I mix some honey with the dijon mustard and add a dash or two of hot sauce.  You don't need the butter, as Salmon is kinda rich anyway.

I didn't have butter, so I used olive oil, but when I poured it over the salmon it didn't absorb into the bread crumbs very well and ended up pooling around the bottom of the pan.  Next time I try this recipe I will melt butter, mix with the breadcrumbs and then top the fish as some other people have suggested.  I also didn't have dijon mustard, and instead used deli brown, but I image that the dijon would have a better flavor.  Overall, will try again!

This recipe has wow factor!!!  It uses a minimal number of ingredients, preparation takes just a few minutes, and because it's baked on foil, you only have to wash 3 or 4 kitchen tools.  It goes from "what can we eat?" to flavorful gourmet in less than 1/2 hour, and not much clean-up afterwards.  I used fresh wild salmon, sweet-hot mustard (the finished dish wasn't hot at all), sea salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic & herb bread crumbs, and of course, real butter.  I agree with REBECCAANNIE that adding the crumbs to melted better before topping the salmon makes it that much easier and more consistent.  I also broiled it for 2 minutes at the end.  The mustard is not overwhelming at all, it complements the fish perfectly.  The buttered bread crumbs were delicious and the fish was moist. I baked a 1-1/2 pound salmon fillet this way and it vanished in no time.  This recipe would take individual variations just fine.  For simplicity, flavor, and ease of preparation, you can't go wrong with this one.

Great recipe! Everything was moist and tender. I broiled it for the last 3 minutes to make the bread crumbs crunchy. Best of all, my kitchen does not smell like fish! We ate it with rice and sauted zucchini...yum!

I have made this a couple times.  This time I made my own bread crumbs in the food processor using sour dough bread, adding some olive oil just to barely make them damp and some fresh parsley. Pulsed it a few time.  I seasoned the fillets with some lemon pepper and just a pinch of sea salt on each fillet then applied the dijon.  Covered with the bread crumbs just lightly pressing them into the dijon.  Butter not required this way either.  This definitely was an improvement from past experiences.  Try this I think you will like it.

this recipe was really not that impressive to me, although i was hoping for more.  i used a creole mustard that i often serve with fried fish as a dipping sauce, but the combination of mustard with bread crumbs was kind of unpleasant.  i like fish with mustard sauce, and i like breaded fish, but the two together just didn't work out well for me.

Simple, quick & deliscious.  I skipped the butter and just spritzed mine with "butter spray" to save big time on calories.  The mustard was a great compliment to the fish.

This is a quick, easy, and delicious way to have baked salmon. I make it even easier - I don't measure out the dijon mustard or the bread crumbs - I just squirt some mustard on and spread it with my fingers, then shake some bread crumbs over it. Also - I tried drizzling melted butter on the first time I made it, and it basically ran off the salmon and pooled on the tray. The next time, I used Smart Balance butter spray and sprayed the top of the bread crumbs, it seemed to stick much better. Great easy recipe, thanks!!

My husband and I thought this was great, and even our two-year-old ate it. The bread crumbs give the impression of that breaded chicken she loves... This would be a great company dish: it's different, easy, and delicious.

I love this and am passing it on to family members. I dabbed little dots of butter on instead of using melted butter which was easier and way less fatty. This will be a regular on our home menu.

I'm not fond of fish but I'm trying to incorporate it more and more. I used this recipe with sockeye salmon which is supposed to be the best tasting. I only had honey mustard and olive oil with the bread crumbs and it was fantastic.  I used the outside grill since I hate stinking up the house with fish.  But I swear this tasted like CHICKEN!!  It was AWESOME!!

A very good main dish.  I get the feeling that, the higher quality Dijon mustard you choose to cook this with, the better this recipe would turn out to be.  I chose a generic store brand this time around, and having tasted richer Dijons in the past, I can say I look forward to up-scaling this dish next time.

My favorite salmon recipe.  The only change I've made is that instead of using melted butter I spray the bread crumbs with 'I can't believe it's not butter' as due to dietary restrictions I rarely if ever have real butter in the house.  Would give it more than 5 stars for ease and taste!!

I had to use the frozen salmon fillets but this recipe worked.  The strong Dijon flavor baked off or something because my son who does not like Dijon actually said the fish was 'yummy.'  I had to broil the fish for a few minutes to brown the bread crumbs but the salmon remained moist and tasty.
Thanks for sharing.

Great and easy recipe. The only change I made was I used Panko crumbs and the butter I didn't melt, I just put cut up cold pieces all over the salmon and then it melted in the oven. This is a recipe I will be making many times.

This was good, but I would have liked a little less mustard on the fillet.  I cooked the bread crumbs with the butter on the stove for about a minute as another reviewer suggested.

This was a great meal.  I was not dissapointed and was able to bring left vers to work the next day.  I prepared it the night before and let it marinate.  My husband actually put it in the oven.  He had an issue with operating the broiler so it didn't crisp up. However, next time I will handle the cooking!  I think it would be even better if it had a nice crisp to the top.  I did use more seasonings than listed inculding italion seasoning & lemon pepper.

Fast, easy, delicious. I used plain panko bread crumbs and seasoned with Italian herbs.   Next, I stirred into the panko crumbs a mixture of half butter and half olive oil.  Lastly, before adding the bread crumb mixture to the fish (thick, fresh, not previously frozen belly cut), I baked the salmon for 15 minutes, adding the bread crumbs for the final 10 minutes or so of baking so that the crumbs wouldn't burn.   Turned out great. Served with baked acorn squash and steamed broccoli.

Enjoyed this.  I used 1/4 cup of panko breadcrumbs with 1/4 tsp of thyme and oregano added to it.  Melted the butter and mixed with the breadcrumbs before adding it to the salmon.

Very tasty! I didn't have any honey to add (which was a suggestion from a couple of other users) so I sprinkled a little sugar into the breadcumbs and butter mixture.  I'm not sure if it was really necessary, but I was worried the fish would need some sweetness based on others' reviews. The fish tasted even better when warmed up the next day. Thanks!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I used olive oil instead of butter and added Italian herbs to plain breadcrumbs.  I think the only thing I would do differently is mix the breadcrumbs and oil or butter together before putting on the salmon; I had some completely dry breadcrumbs in some spots, and soggy, oily crumbs in other spots.  I was hoping for a crisper topping, like what I put on mac & cheese.  Other than that (and that was my fault), this was delicious!  Thanks!

My family is luke-warm about salmon and they think they don't like mustard. But this dish wowed even my toddler. They all loved the "kick" they dijon gave the fish. (I just never told them what it was.) For once we had no left-overs! I even tried it with halibut and it was awesome, too. Great combo, and very, very easy to prepare. A winner!

I usually marinate my salmon in zesty italian dressing and lemon juice w/ a little sugar, salt and pepper.  It turns out very nice, but I wanted something different.  This was very good.  I found the dijon mustard I used a bit strong.  Next time, I'll try a sweet dijon as some other reviewers suggested. Also, I may do my usual marinade next time and add the other ingredients for a richer flavor. I broiled it at the end of cooking to crisp up the topping a little and it turned out nicely.  My husband loved it, and I will defimately make this again!

We have salmon once a week and this is probably our favorite.  You can also substitute dijonnaise and instead of melted butter, try spraying with butter flavored Pam.

My roommate hasn't praised a meal I've made until this one! Delicious! I can't wait for the left-overs tonight!
I thought the cooking time was a little to quick. I don't like a dried up piece of fish but I also don't want it mushy. I followed the recipe but after that I dropped the temp. to 375 and left it an additional 10 minutes. This made it just right (for me).

I cooked the salmon a few more minutes than the recipe calls for. My husband loved it and it was super simple to make. Thanks!

Superb! I made this one yesterday (for our lunch) and it was delicious! 
Tip: I added a dash of worcestershire sauce, low-sodium soy sauce, honey and sprinkled a little red crushed pepper and it was YUMMY!

First time making salmon and wanted something healthy! My husband and daughter LOVED it and I thought it was great too.  I used 32 oz. of fresh salmon fillets (skin on), added a little more Dijon for the extra portion, and prepared it as directed except for the butter which I omitted.  I baked it on convection for 20 minutes and it was perfectly done.  It helped that my fillets were the same size. Wouldn't change a thing here, I omitted the butter because of calories but I'm sure it would have been even better this way! Had a nice piece left over which my husband will have for lunch tomorrow.

Hello from the Submitter here!  I just want to let you all know that because this is a pretty old recipe, I submitted it before panko became so popular. I now use panko instead of bread crumbs and I do like the crunch it lends to the dish.  Glad you're liking this!

Great recipe! We had fresh caught Alaskan Salmon so I wanted something to compliment the fish but not overpower it.  This was great, I made bread crumbs by putting wheat bread in the food processor, then tosting in a pan for a few minutes to dry, then added the italian seasoning.  We cooked it on the BBQ on a sheet pan lined with foil.  Quick, easy and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

A simple and quick main dish that is delicious. I agree with the tip of melting butter and adding bread crumbs before coating fish. As a mustard lover, I feel that any style would work well in this recipe.

I loved the addition of Dijon to the Salmon.  I added some italian seasoned breadcrumbs mixed in butter on top of mustard and used Lemon No Salt Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  Result a really tangy Salmon with a wonderful crunchy texture.

Very good recipe! I did make the recipe healthier by substituting 1/8 cup olive oil for the 1/4 cup of butter, and I also added 1 teaspoon of dill weed to the Dijon before I spread it on. The whole family loved it!

Excellent!! Salt n peppered the salmon first, added layer of Trader Joe's whole grain Dijon mustard, then topped with panko flakes tossed in melted butter. Baked at 400. So easy. So delicious.

My husband and I love salmon and this is one of our new favorite ways to cook it.

I have never used butter in my version - of course everything tastes better drenched in butter - but I have always deleted it in order to save calories.  In place of the butter I spray my pan with Pam (slides right off the pan when it's done!) and then give the breadcrumbs on top a light spray (helps the breadcrumbs to crisp up).

I substitute Panko breadcrumbs for the traditional breadcrumbs; the Panko are extra crunchy.

I have made this recipe several times with different mustards and we have love them all:
-Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard
-Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce
-Stonewall Kitchen Caramelized Onion Mustard

The mustard/breadcrumb topping keeps the moisture in the fish so it doesn't dry.

Love it!!

DELICIOUS AND AMAZING!! My husband said that this was the best thing I've ever made for dinner.  I followed the advice below and mixed the breadcrumbs and the butter BEFORE putting on the salmon (it sort of made a breadcrumb paste).  I didn't have italian breadcrumbs, so just added italian seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture.  I also asked for the salmon skin to be removed at the grocery store so it was easier to eat at home.  Served this with a lemon wedge, parmesan and arugula salad, and roasted potatoes.

Wonderful. My husband loved it. I did not have Italian bread crumbs so I used Panko crumbs and sprinkled a little oregano and basil on top. Also because we do watch our fat intake I reduced the melted butter to 2 tablespoons. This will be made often in our household.

This recipe is a keeper, very nice, I took the advise of one of the other reviewers and melted the butter and combined the bread crumbs, spread them on the fillets, then put them under the broiler to finish it off to crisp up the coating.  My husband who is not keen on salmon actually said it was very nice and he liked the new recipe.  Yeah!

I added onion slices and then sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top of the bread crumb mixture when there was about 15 minutes left.  It really took it up a notch.

This dish was very delicious! My husband took one bite of it and started raving about how amazing it was. I used panko breadcrumbs (I didn't have italian). Next time I will use less mustard for myself because it was kind of strong for my liking, although my husband loved the mustard taste. I will definitely be making again. This is a very easy and quick way to prepare salmon.

I've been looking for a simple recipe so I could prepare and serve salmon in a new way.  This was definitely easy and super tasty.  My kids loved it.  I used Earth Balance margarine and Panko bread crumbs and it came out perfectly.

Let me tell you... if this recipe has won over a fisherman's daughter it's a "keeper"! This recipe was amazing for Pink/Hummpie salmon because this species has less flavor than your Silver or King. I made it with all the ingredients, the only thing I did differently was mix the melted butter and the bread crumbs before spreading over the salmon. Definitely will make again and again.

This was outstanding.  I mixed the melted butter with the bread crumbs and mustard, made a paste then grilled it outside.  I used half course grain dijon with smooth.

Hmm, I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Might have to do with the fact that I misread the directions and mixed the butter, mustard and bread crumbs all together, then smeared it over the fish. It just wasn't awesome, but didn't taste bad either. Maybe I'll give it one more shot and do it the way the recipe calls for!

Great recipe! I put a thin layer of dijon on the salmon and then mixed the melted butter and breadcrumbs to coat the fish. I only had plain breadcrumbs and forgot to season with Italian herbs. My family loved it anyway, my youngest said it belonged on a cooking show it was so good!

We loved this although I did make changes - I added light hellman's to the dijon so it was like a dijonnaise.  Also cooked for 20 minutes as salmon pieces were thick.  It was so good - I think, though, next time I'll just use the dijon to see which one we like better.  Very fast and easy too.

Simple and refreshing (you don't taste a lot of oil). 
It's really easy to make as well.
I wouldn't mind making this dish again.

This didn't turn out very well.  The "thin layer of dijon" can't be stressed enough.  I think I layed it on too thickly.  The bread crumb topping never got crunchy, and the fish that didn't have any dijon on it was bland.  I have other salmon recipes I like better, so I probably won't try this one again

The best salmon ever. I didn't use the breadcrumbs and I only prepared 2 peices of salmon in a ceramic dish. The extra sauce melted nicely over the salmon as it cooked and it was a good dipping sauce as well.  I also used 2 tablespoons of honey-dijon and one tablespoon of regular dijon. I topped each peice of salmon with crushed pecans and that made this dish to die for. What a crowd pleaser!

This was a big hit with my family. Even my 2-year old ate it! The only change I made was to squeeze lemon juice on the fillet before spreading the Dijon and I also made my own breadcrumb mixture.

Best salmon recipe I've ever tried. I use honey Dijon--it's delicious.  First time I made this dish, didn't have any breadcrumbs so made my own with some stale whole wheat bread, then tossed the crumbs in a baggie with a little Italian seasoning. Wonderful! The next time, I bought some bread crumbs but I prefer the homemade ones. Like other reviewers, I used less butter--just dotted some low-fat margarine on top instead of drizzling melted butter on.  This is an absolutely SUPERB recipe and I thank the original contributor!

I tried this recipe and the salmon tured out GREAT!  I would advise coating the mustard on a little thicker than suggested and could reduce the cooking time to make it more tender.

This was really good.  I didn't follow it exactly, I skipped the bread crumbs and used honey dijon mustard instead.  I topped it off with fresh dill, crushed garlic, and green onion...yum!  My new favorite salmon recipe!

WOW! I tried this only because I had the ingredients and I didn't want to have a plain old salmon filet. I had to use Honey Mustard, but boy was it good. Cooked in 5 minutes longer, but it was the most moist and tasty salmon I have ever had. My kids loved it also. Thanx for the simple, easy recipe that I will always remember!

This was GREAT!! Very healthy, my spouse & 5 year old asked for seconds.  I used a little less butter and then sprayed it with diet butter spray.
Thanks for sharing this. I am definately going to make this again!!

I would highly recommend using less bread crumbs, and more butter. I did this and it turned out EXCELLENT. Very easy.

My husband thinks this is the best Salmon he has ever eaten.  It is so easy and I always have the ingredients needed.  Previously, I bbq's my salmon with lemon and dill which was great but this is better.

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have italian bread crumbs, so I mixed plain with Penzey's Tuscan Sunset Italian Seasoning.

Very nice, simple recipe. The husband loved it. I made a substitution, I substituted panko crumbs and Italian seasoning for the pre seasoned crumbs. I also sauteed the crumb mixture in the butter until nicely browned, otherwise exactly the same. Next time I will not use the Dijon. I don't like it! Maybe some honey mustard or Miracle Whip even..

This recipe was very tasty and surprisingly my husband loved it! He is not a big salmon eater. I was looking for recipes to add a variety to our diet and this was absolutely wonderful! I followed the exact directions and it came out perfect. The only thing different is that I seasoned the fish with Old Bay first.

This made for a very enjoyable dinner, thank you! I followed the recipe pretty much as written, but decided to include an even sprinkling of brown sugar over the mustard (but underneath the butter and breadcrumbs) based on a similar, highly-rated recipe. I mixed the breadcrumbs with basil, garlic powder, and a pinch of oregano. Overall, the flavors were great, the fish was well-cooked, and the crust had a very pleasant texture.

i'll start by saying i am very fussy.  I made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS!  I made this as written and added a sprinkle of lemon.  the flavors did not overwhelm the salmon. I will make it again and again.

The topping was delicious, and this dish is easy to prepare. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because salmon is my favorite fish, and I have other recipes that I feel allow its flavor to shine. My kids loved this though. Thanks!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of a reviewer and mixed the bread crumbs (I used panko) with the melted butter before topping the salmon. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good, and easy to make. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The salmon with dijon mustard is a great marriage. Actually it was not enough mustard for me so I put a little on my plate to dip the salmon in.  I used honey dijon mustard.  Will make again.
9-1-19.. I made this again with a few changes. I spread some honey on the fish, THEN I  spread on the Dijon mustard.  After the 15 minutes was up, I  put it under the broiler fo 2 min to put a crust on the topping.  This was really good!

This recipe was delicious! I followed the exact recipe.. Frankly, I find it pretty dumb when people don't follow the recipe, butcher it and give it poor ratings... Mahi mahi and low fat margarine.. Seriously?! That's a different recipe and that person shouldn't have rated this salmon recipe at all...

I scaled this back for 2 servings but ended up needing to add more panko bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasonings.  Definitely it could do with less butter.  Next time I will either mist with EVOO or butter spray.  Very tasty with the butter, but no real need for the extra calories/fat. Highly recommend broiling the last minute to crisp up the top.  Fast enough for a weeknight but fancy enough for company.  Nice change of pace from the normal Asian themed salmon recipes.

This recipe is fantastic!  I did as RebeccaAnne suggested and melted the butter and added the bread crumbs.  I used Panko.  I also added a squirt of honey to the coarse ground dijon.  It was wonderful!

I made this tonight for dinner. Soooooo gooooood! I ranked it a 4 because I did make some small changes to the original recipe. I mixed in minced garlic into the mustard and sprinkled some dill on top like a few of the other reviewers. I also put it in the broiler for about a minute to crisp the bread crumbs. I will absolutely make again! Maybe try it with a little honey?
I made with an asparagus recipe from this site and a bag of rice pilaf. Husband ate it all :)

Used this recipe this evening and we loved it. I left off the butter and breadcrumbs to cut down on calories. I will use a little more Dijon next time. But this was sooo easy and clean up even easier!

Good.  I will try it for 12 or 13 minutes the next time.  I thought the fish was well done and I like my fish a little less cooked.

Love love love! I really do enjoy salmon, but was nervous to make it "from scratch" at home. WOW.. I never buy store bought bread crumbs, so just made my own (plain old home made white bread toasted, salt, pepper, italian seasoning - blend in mini food processor) and mixed the  melted butter in (as suggested by another reviewer) I always add tons of the breadcrumb mix as it is so good. I always serve with garlic and olive oil couscous.

Restaurant quality.  Flavorful, moist and delicious.  I made a few small changes due to not having all the ingredients on hand:  substituted Provencal mustard from Trader Joe's, instead of Dijon.  And Panko bread crumbs instead of Italian.  And I sprinkled some Herbes de Province along with the salt and pepper.  I like to BBQ salmon on a cedar plank, but for days when the BBQ doesn't work out, this will be my go-to salmon recipe.

My family really like this. To make it a little more healthy I used Panko instead of bread crumbs and drizzled olive oil on top instead. Very good.

This was yummy, but I added a bit too much mustard, my bad. I made 2 slight changes. I used Clarified butter, which I melted and mixed in with the Italian seasoned  panko crumbs.  D.E.L.I.S.H!!!! 
Rarely can I make something edible without a recipe, and this was a home-run.

I give this three star cause I loved it but my hunny told me not to make it again. He said it seemed to him like the mustard over powers the fish and he likes to know what he is eating. I would suggest making it with a lot less mustard unless you really like mustard. I made exactly as stated above.

So simple and easy.. Substituted the butter and breadcrumbs for some dried herbs and it turned out absolutely fantastic.. I prefer using very coarse sea salt, because it adds great texture and looks fabulous on a plate..;) Sautéed some onions, mushrooms, chorizo, and rocket with a bit of balsamic for a side-- perfection...

This is my new favorite way to cook salmon. It was just so good and really easy to make. Just like another reviewer, my husband is not a big fan of mustard but for whatever reason it just works with this recipe. The only thing I changed was the drizzle of butter, I left that out but did do a quick spray of Pam just to crisp up the topping a bit.
I know I'll be making this again sooner than later since I eat salmon about once a week.
Great recipe!

Easy recipe and simply amazing.   As suggested I mixed a little honey in with a Dijon and coarse mustard mix and left it on the salmon an hour before baking.  Mixed the melted butter and breadcrumbs together before topping the fish, and finished with some grated Parmesan before baking. The whole family loved it. This crust would also work well with other fish and other seasonings.

Our new favorite. I made this on a whim even though my family loved "our salmon recipe never to be changed".  This recipe is the new favorite "never to be changed". I will make exactly as written. Delicious.  I love change and now often add honey to the DiJon before applying it to the salmon.  Unbelievable.

I love this! My picky eater boyfriend loves it too, and he doesn't even like mustard. I LOVE mustard so this was exciting for me.

I found that the cooking times in the recipe were exactly right.

I subbed out the butter with light-flavor olive oil to try and be more healthy, it worked just fine.

The first time I cooked it I followed the instructions and found the breadcrumbs to be pretty dry and undercooked. The second time I tried mixing in the breadcrumbs with the olive oil before spreading them on the fish. I mixed them together, put the mustard on the salmon, returned to the olive oil and they had soaked up some of the oil which is what I was going for. I gave it a few more stirs and then poured it on the fish and spread it out. It worked perfectly! The breadcrumbs were a smoother consistency but still added some crunch. They also browned better. 

I cooked on 400 until the last 2 minutes and then flipped the oven onto broil to brown the top. Make sure you watch it! But it came out so well :-)

Exceeded my expectations! I used grainy Dijon mustard and some homemade breadcrumbs without Italian seasoning, but I'll try it with seasoned breadcrumbs next time.  I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed the breadcrumbs with the melted butter before spreading on the fish.  It was crispy and gave the dish and extra dimension.

This was pretty tasty, gotta say! Very subtle flavors. I might add a twinge more of the mustard, but other than that, this recipe is top notch! Did take another reviewer's advice and after it had baked for 15 minutes, I broiled it for 2 minutes, and it gave it a nice crisp to it! Will be making this again!

The mustard gives the salmon a slight sweetness.  I always have dijon, butter and breadcrumbs so these are the recipes that make cooking easy.  My salmon wasn't 100% thawed out so I doubled the cooking time and it turned out great!

This is a delicious way to prepare salmon when grilling isn't an option.  For extra crunch, use Panko breadcrumbs.

This was amazing! I don't even like salmon, but I try to eat it once in awhile because it's so healthy. But now I'm going to be looking forward to it! I had some maple dijon mustard in the fridge, I used about two heaping spoonfuls on the salmon. Didn't use the salt and pepper (just plain forgot!). Mixed plain breadcrumbs (was all I had) with some melted butter and sprinkled over top. Baked for about 15 min at 400 and my fish wasn't done but the breadcrumbs were burning! So I decreased temp to 375 and baked another 20 minutes (it was a big piece!). So so sooooo good!! THANK YOU.

Finally, a salmon recipe without dill! (Not that there is anything wrong with dill; I was just excited for something a little different.) I did not have Italian style bread crumbs, so I made my own by toasting a slice of sourdough and pulsing it in the Cuisinart with some Italian seasoning. This was delicious. It received high praise from three of us, and the fourth one, who does not like fish, silently cleaned his plate, which is essentially the same thing. I liked that it did not taste strongly of fish or of mustard. The flavors work very well together.

Very easy and quick to make, but I would recommend to let it soak in the sauce a little to really absorb.

I'm a VERY rookie chef, & have never made salmon before. This was very good, super easy to do and the Dijon complimented the salmon perfectly. I mixed the melted butter & breadcrumbs as others suggest. Thanks for posting this, I'll definitely make again.

This was very good and extremely easy.  I mixed the melted butter and bread crumbs together then spread on the salmon.  I would use 1/2 the butter next time.  It was more than needed.

This is my 13-year old son's favorite meal!  My finicky husband loves it too as well as my four-year old.  The only suggestion I would make is to mix the breadcrumbs and butter together and then place on fish.  Drizzling the butter won't make a nice coating.

Love this recipe! It has become one of my favorite salmon recipes, and I make it regularly. I typically make my own breadcrumbs, which is super easy, and the other ingredients for this recipes are always on hand. I pair it with broiled asparagus, which is a great combination.

I personally don't like salmon but bought a small fillet for my husband as a trial since I never made it before.  I kept it in the oven a bit longer then stated, so it was a nice golden color with some crispiness.  My husband went crazy over it, and so did my kids!  Then they convinced me to try it, and I loved it, too!  We were all upset that I only bought a small fillet, so today I am making it again, but this time enough for the whole family.  This recipe was delish!  It did not have that strong fishy salmon flavor, and as the other commenter wrote, the dijon compliments the salmon perfectly.  Thanks, CHRISTYJ, for the awesome recipe! :)

i did not like this. i don't know why i tried it out, i wasn't even in the mood for the ingredients, but regardless i scraped the topping off my fillet. i'm usually very unpicky, but maybe the crust didn't crust enough & the mustard made it taste salty. i am not a fan of salty at all & i'm pregnant, so everything taste saltier.

Ok, I am not someone that likes fish or salmon very much, but I tried this tonite because my husband is on a diet. I actually ate my whole piece! That is amazing! Give it a try, it is quick, easy, and cleanup is fast because you cook it on foil. Pair it with steamed veggies, and something else or your choice. Great low calorie meal!!!

Simple to make.  A great way to cook salmon.  It says go light on the mustard and I did.  Next time I think ill use more.  We had a thick cut of salmon and the flavor didn't cook into it much.

Love this recipe.  I also left out the butter to save calories and added extra honey dijon mixed with dijon mustard to the top and sides. It is an excellent healthy and simple recipe.

So simple and tasty.  I combined the breadcrumbs w/ the melted butter to get a more even coating, and it turned out great.  VERY moist!  I will definitely be making this one again.  The only change I would make is to double the amount of mustard - in my opinion, the dijon flavor was sort of lost against the Italian bread crumb seasoning.  Either way, a big thumbs up.

Loved this! I used garlic salt in place of regular salt. Otherwise, didn't change a thing, except to cook the salmon on the grill, instead of in the oven. Came out excellent!

Great and very simple recipe! I used half the butter and for the bread crumbs I toasted 1/2 slice of whole wheat bread. It was just enough crumb to soak up the butter and give it a nice flavor. Also, I used honey mustard to give it a slight sweetness. My family loved it.

This was super easy AND I actually enjoyed it.  I'm not a big fan of salmon, but cook it now and then because of the health benefits and my husband does like salmon.  This is the first salmon recipe that I've liked well enough, that I plan to use it again.  I think I might try mixing a little honey with the mustard next time - just for fun.

Delicious!  I added a bit more than just salt and pepper to taste since I really like my food to be flavorful.  The particular salmon that I had took about 20 minutes instead of the suggested 15, but it was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.

This is so simple and so awesome.  I used whole seed dijon mustard from Trader Joe's (added a little extra crunch) and used mustard panko crumbs from Whole Foods seafood department (even more crunch).  Will make this many more times.

Amazing! I have never cooked salmon before. I took the tip of mixing the butter with the bread crumbs and used homemade mustard. Other than that I followed the recipe to the "T". Perfect! Thank you!

This recipe is so quick and easy! I loved it and used honey mustard instead of dijon. I increased the amount of mustard then instructed for more flavor. I complimented the dish with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. Delicious!!

This was delicious and I even added my own twist to it. You must try mixing the dijon with a little mayo and instead of the bread crumbs I used Trader Joe's French Fried Onions...oh my goodness, it was so good!

Definitely would give this 5 stars, the family loved it!   I did as some reviewers mentioned and sauteed the bread crumbs with the butter and also added dill when seasoning and it came out great! I served with rice and asparagus and there were no leftovers. It was very easy and quick to make with very little clean up time. Highly recommend!

I didn't have dijon mustard but saw that someone else had used honey mustard. It was all right but not thrilling. I'll try again with the dijon and see if that improves it.

I just did a three-way taste tests between this recipe and the ones for Salmon with Lemon and Dill and the Lemon Rosemary Salmon from this site and this one pleased my taste buds the most.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavors.  I used crushed Ritz® crackers instead of the bread crumbs. Added dill and parsley & Italian seasonings to them, mixed them (3/4 C) into 4 Tbls melted butter.  Had a delicious dinner on the table in no time at all.

Delicious! Only changes made by necessity and health. Used honey mustard (all I had) bread crumbs from homemade bread, seasoned with paprika, onion powder and a dash of garlic powder, olive oil for butter, and probably only 2 T. GREAT dish!

I would give it 6 stars if I could.  It is beautifully simple and quick to prepare.  The dijon surprised; I thought it would compete with the taste of the salmon, but that wasn't the case at all.  I found that the flavor infused with the salmon nicely, toning down the 'fishiness' a bit as well.   I will definitely make this one again.

Wow these were phenominal!  Even my boyfriend who doesn't really care for salmon ate them up.  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used herb stuffing mix and it was very good and crunchy.

Super, super easy. If it wasn't, I'd probably be giving it three stars as I liked it, but nothing to write home about. My husband loved it though. Only difference is I added a little honey mustard to the dijon and seasoned my own panko breadcrumbs. I will be making it again just because it was so simple and great for nights where we need something quick.

Very yummy and added some uniqueness to plain salmon.  I used different mustards on each piece---the honey mustard won over the yellow mustard, and the horseradish mustard was not so good. I'd recommend trying the honey mustard!

This was pretty darn tasty, and easy too! The breadcrumbs crisped up nicely, and the dijon added just enough flavor without overpowering it completely. I had this with Dijon Tartar Sauce and a squeeze of fresh lime over the top. That's just a personal thing, and the recipe stands alone. I think the next time I make it, I will make extra so I can have leftovers for salads. Thanks!

Great salmon recipe especially for people who think salmon is too fishy tasting. I used panko crumbs and mixed with a little olive oil for the topping.

This recipe is already a favorite; we've made it multiple times.  It is best to melt the butter and then mix the bread crumbs into it, making a sort of crumbly paste to spoon on top of the dijon mustard.  After it is done baking, quickly broil it for a minute or 2 to get the top extra crunchy.  Yum!  And oh yes, don't forget to spray the aluminum foil with a nonstick spray.  I forgot that the first time and our fillets were served on little squares of foil!

This was delicious! I omitted the butter to make a healthier dish. Also used panko breadcrumbs and mixed with 2 tbsp parm cheese and some italian seasonings instead of italian breadcrumbs (most commercial breadcrumbs contain partially hydrogenated oils - not good). Served with risotto and roasted zucchini.  Restaurant quality meal.

YUM!!!  This was very easy to make and so good.  The Dijon taste was just right.  I used less butter and next time I think I will try butter spray to cut calories, but it is great the way it is.

So delicious! I used spicy brown mustard instead, for a kick.  I also added some shredded Parmesan cheese on top. Very tasty and not at all fishy!!!

Delicious and so easy.  Make sure to use foil so that clean up is easy.  I put salt, pepper and garlic powder on the salmon before putting the mustard on it. I put 3 tbls of dijon mustard and 2 tbls of honey in a zip lock bag and coated the fish that way.  I topped the filets with panko japanese breadcrumbs mixed with dried parseley and drizzeled margarine over the top.  Keep an eye on the salmon because it can cook fast and overcooked salmon is NOT good.

Very good.  I did add some honey, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, basil & oregano to add a little more flavor.  It did take about 20 minutes to cook since I had thicker pieces of salmon.

I made this with grainy country style dijon and it came out great.  Make sure to watch the cooking time based on the size of your fillets as mine took a little under 15 mins to cook.  This is so quick and easy and the best part is there is no clean up!

This was so good!  At first I thought it didn't sound that great because I'm not a big mustard fan.  But I had a bought salmon at Costco and had a ton of it! We had already grilled it, teriyakied it and we still had more salmon!  So since my husband likes dijon I decided to try it.  I'm so glad I did.  It was so easy and so delicious I couldn't believe it!  I did at a little sprinkle of garlic powder before I spread on the mustard.  But that's it.  Just delicious!

make sure you don't add too much dijon because it can really overpower the fish.

This was ok, but I've made something like this before. However, add some honey to country style dijon mustard, bread crumbs, and pecans.  Much better that way.

I used this recipe twice now and both parties were blown away!  This is definately my leading recipe right now.  Its so easy, quick, and different than most Salmon recipes.  I served it with a simple angel hair with garlic and butter sauce as well as aspaugus.  Yum!

Very easy! Very tasty! I used whole seed mustard instead of dijon. I put a chopped tomato and chopped onion on top of the mustard instead of bread crumbs and it was wonderful! I also used garlic and oregano (on someone else's tip). All and all, very good!

Sorry, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.  The mustard was overwhelming, and I coudldn't taste the salmon at all. For a great salmon recipe, try grilled salmon I.

Very GOOD! I added a tiny drop of honey into the mustard. I made my own crumbs using old regular white bread; sat in it the oven for 2 mins during preheating process, then roughly minced it in a mincer. As I love crumbs, I piled on 3 layers of them, each after drizzling some melted butter. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...

Great springboard recipe.  I used salmon fillets, and marinated them in a bit of italian salad dressing for 20 minutes before hand.  The first time I made this, I used dijon mustard.  The 2nd time, honey mustard.  This last time, I mixed a combo of both mustards in a small bowl, and added in a bit of fat free mayo to mellow the strength of the mustard.  I also moistened the breadcrumbs with a bit of oil oil in a small bowl, then packed them onto the fillets after spreading the mustard/mayo combo on top.  I found this helps the breadcrumbs to adhere a bit better.  Rather than butter, I did as others have, and sprayed the top with a bit of non-stick cooking spray.  Baked at 350 for 10 minutes, and then put them under the broiler for less than a minute to brown and crisp up the top.  This is a really good springboard recipe, and after making it 3x now, it obviously has become a staple in my kitchen.  Thanks for putting the idea out there for us to customize.

This was salmon's last chance.  I've had it twice before and couldn't stand it. My boyfriend, however, loves it and has been begging me to give it one more try.  Because of all the positive reviews, I decided to try this recipe.  Needless to say, one taste redeemed salmon for me.  We made this two nights ago, had the leftovers for lunch yesterday, and I'm already craving it again.  We used a little less butter (about 3 tbsp instead of 4) and made an equal mix of dijon and honey mustard instead of just dijon.  Definitely try this even if you're not a fan of salmon.

This is our favorite salmon recipe to date! I used one big salmon fillet instead of four little ones, and used extra amounts of dijon and bread crumbs, and it was wonderful. I had to bake it a little longer because the fillet was pretty thick, but it was so good. My husband couldn't eat it fast enough. I highly recommend it...

This recipe should receive a 10 star rating based on the ease, simplicity, and delicious taste.  While I consider myself a pretty good cook I have struggled with fish recipes.  My boyfriend and I could not get enough of this dish.  Well done my friend.  I would not change a thing!!!

This is one of the best ways I have had Salmon. Normally we cook Salmon the grill where it can get dried out. This recipie was so moist and had just the right flavor. I did use 1/2 amount of butter called for on a 1 pound fillet- it was perfect- even my 2 year old gobbled it up- and she is picky!

Excellent recipe and takes hardly any preparation time.  I have served this to lots of people and haven't found anyone who didn't love it.  Even my 8 year old neighbor loves it.  Even people who say they don't like fish have enjoyed this.

I didn't really like this at all, in fact I couldn't finish it.  My fiance said that's just how salmon tastes, but I know at Red Lobster it's a lot better!  He said it's allright but I think it was just to spare my feelings.  I don't suggest it!

This recipe was great and so easy!  The bread crumbs added a nice crust and the mustard added a nice tangy flavor.  The only negative thing about it was the skin on the salmon.  I just sliced the meaty part of the fish away from it and it was fine.

This recipe turned out wonderful for me.  My husband has never been impressed with my cooking (he comes from a restaurant family and they all cook wonderfully); however, it has been almost a month since I fixed this recipe and he still raves about it.

Delicious!!  I did add some honey to the dijon mustard after reading other reviews and it was fabulous!  The mustard topping seems to take some of the "bite" out of the salmon and make it milder, which I love.  My son is a HUGE salmon eater and gave it 4*'s because he didn't care for the bread crumb topping (I think I went a little heavy on it), but I wouldn't change a thing.  He scraped it off and loved it.  And clean-up was a breeze!  I used foil big enough to stand up all around the pan, and not one drop of anything got on my stoneware!  yea!!  We will be using this recipe often!

This was great - very easy and really tasty!  I reduced the butter by half and it was still good.  My family loved this and I will certainly make it again.

This salmon recipe rendered such a succulent fillet, that I neglected eating anything else on my plate! Tangy and moist, this recipe explodes with flavor. Totally satisfying.

This is great recipe that requires little effort. I made it last night and it was delicious. I added fresh parsley, green onions, and powdered garlic. Be careful not to put too much dijon on the salmon as this will make it salty.  Next time, I think I will add more bread crumbs as well.  Finally, you do need to cook another 15 mins, which I did at 375 F.

This was a snap to make, and tasted lovely, but we found it a little mushy. I will definitely make it again but will broil it to brown the topping at the end.

This isn't really quite fair because I tried this recipe with arctic char instead of salmon. Usually, sumilar recipes work well  but I couldn't find ANY recipe for arctic char so went for it. Just a warning not to go with this one if you have arctic char -- it's awful. I wasted one heckuva lot of expensive fish. By the way, if anyone does have any recipe(s) for char, PLEASE post them.

probably the best salmon i've ever eaten.  it was wonderful. my husband hates seafood... so i made this while he was out of town for his parents.  i will make this again, maybe even just for myself and cook him something else.  this is just too good to never make again.

I used whole grain mustard because that's what I had and this may be why I found the mustard flavour to be too strong.  It was also too oily and fatty with the butter.

We both loved it, but I did alter it a bit. I added a little honey to the mustard and finely chopped pecans to the bread crumbs. I also finished it's cooking time with a few minutes under the broiler. Yum!

I am not a salmon eater and have never cooked it before but I made this for the family for Easter. They absolutely loved it! I used Panko bread crumbs and added fresh dill on top before baking. My partner said its the best salmon he has ever eaten! Thanks for the great recipe x

Made by melting butter, adding crushed flavored croutons (didn't have bread crumbs) and a little chinese spicy mustard into the pan (thanks for the tip RebeccaAnne22). Oiled the bottom of my cast iron, put the 11 oz piece of salmon in skin side down  and spread Bavarian mustard generously over the top (I LOVE mustard), then poured the crumb mixture over the mustard. Put into a 350 oven for around 18 minutes; then turned on the broiler for around 2-3 minutes. This was so flipping good, I had half for dinner and the other half cold for breakfast. I'll make this over and over.

Great recipe!  I made my own seasoned bread crumbs and did a drizzle of grapeseed oil over the top. Very moist & flavorful salmon! Thanks for sharing!

Really good and easy. Added some dill to my salmon, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Nice, mild flavor that complemented the fish. Perfectly cooked. Will make this again.

Excellent.  We've had this twice in the last week.  I'm not a salmon lover but do like this.  My husband likes salmon and loved this recipe.  I even reduced the amount of butter and used panko bread crumbs (that's all we had)..  I made a Greek yogurt dill sauce to serve with the salmon.  Probably doesn't need it.

I think we'd have given this 5 stars w/o the breadcrumbs and butter.  That's how I'll be making it from here on out.  They weren't necessary and made it a little pasty.

This was a great recipe.  I will be making it again if I can find will salmon that's not too expensive.  I haven't cooked fish very much and I'm very unsure of how to cook it.  My husband loved it!  

I deviated from the recipe a little on the recommendation that I saw on another salmon recipe.  I mixed the butter with panko  bread crumbs and I bbq'd instead then put it it under the broiler.

Scraped off most of the topping because we didn't like it.. After scraping it off though the salmon had a nice flavor to it so it wasn't really ruined. Not my favorite but I think it will give the Curried Salmon Salad (recipe on here) just the flavor it needs. ;-)

By far our favorite salmon recipe yet.  Super easy, quick, and incredibly delicious!  The mustard reduces to a tangy, bright coating that complements the salmon beautifully.  Tried it without the breadcrumbs and it was divine.  My husband had it with the breadcrumbs (used panko), and loved it just as much.  Will definitely be making this our 'go-to' salmon recipe.

Loved recipe.   Only added 3 TBSP maple syrup with Dijon.  Added the butter with Italian panko and topped salmon.  WOW.   Very tasty and will make again.   I used a small glass dish with the fresh fish whole and made sure all sides had the liquid mixture top and bottom withOut foil lining.   Topping gave a great texture also.

Excellent easy recipe! Used Panko Italian bread crumbs and put in under broiler the last 2 minutes! Next time I will try a spray on margarine..only to make it less fattening!

This is delicious and so simple. I melt the butter and add Panko crumbs instead of the Italian bread crumbs. I like the extra crunch the Panko adds. I do adjust the baking time depending on the thickness of the salmon filets. DayleH.

Speedy enough that I can pull it off with my hungry toddler waiting anxiously, and delicious enough that even she enjoys eating it! I love using a honey mustard her, as something about the sweetness offsets the strong salmon flavor.  This one is part of my regular dinner rotation!

Very tasty. Made with Sarah's Rice Pilaf, Roasted  Romanesco, and asparagus. Will try melting butter, adding the breadcrumbs in, and then slathering the mixture on top of the salmon next time to evenly distribute the butter.

This was a wonderfully easy and delicious recipe. I followed the recommendation of another review to melt the butter and toss the bread crumbs in it before sprinkling on top of the fish, in addition I added 2 Tbsp or so of Parmesan cheese in the mixture. I also subbed the salmon with steel head trout - served up with vegetable quinoa and asparagus drizzled with olive oil, salt and pepper and it was a hit!

Delish! I add a tablespoon of honey to the butter and Dijon. It is amazing! Thanks for sharing! We eat this once a week in our house. Also, switching out the flavors of the Panko bread crumbs will give it a new twist every time.

This is an awesome recipe! The salmon was cooked just perfect, it melted in my mouth. I had larger fillets so I cooked it longer than what was called for in the recipe. Also, once it was almost cooked I put it under the the broiler to get the crust golden brown! I highly recommend using the broiler to get the crust just right since baking doesn't get it perfect! Really makes your salmon jump out and perfect dish to have for guests since it's really simple!

Very easy. I doubled the amount of salmon and kept all the topping amounts the same and there was plenty of topping. I thought the mustard was quite dominant in the dish.

I won't be making this again.  We didn't like the flavor.  We scraped off the coating, in order to eat the salmon.

These were good but it calls for 3 TBLS of mustard yet, apply a thin layer. 3 TBLS was not a thin layer and drowned the taste of the salmon. Cut the mustard in half at least. Very easy and quick recipe!

Wow! Got my whole family eating salmon now with this recipe. I was never a big fan of salmon either, but this is so tasty! I like the recipe just the way it is, even though I do not use salt. Delicious! Also is very quick to make...

Awesome!! Depending on the thickness of your salmon, you may have to cook it longer. Even my picky toddler loves this!!

This was such a great flavorful recipe that even my 3 year old daughter ate it and she doesn't eat much. Even my wife loved it and she is a very picky eater. 

This has become a staple in our menu planning since I encourage fish often and since it is an easy recipe my wife may even try to cook it one time.

I've made this twice now. The first time as directed in the recipe and it was very good. The second time, I used horseradish mustard and panko breadcrumbs. Like others have suggested,  I melted the butter in a pan first, added the breadcrumbs and sauteed for a few minutes before topping the mustard-coated salmon. So delicious! I think you could use whatever type mustard you like and different types of fish and it would be great every time. Very quick and easy too. A winner!

Made this with line caught Norwegian salmon fillets last night...just to die for! We used Grey Poupon Creamy Dijon, and lots of fresh lemon juice to finish. Alongside Caprese salad and roasted Brussels sprouts it made a delicious, easy weeknight dinner. Thanks for the recipe Christy!

I liked it but I didn't follow it exactly because I was making baked halibut fillets at the same time, so I used corn flake crumbs instead but it turned out good!

I'll be amazed if anybody didn't like this... Followed the recipe to the T. Super easy and quick.  The salmon was moist and flavorful ...... Mmmmmmmm! The best part, you don need much cleanup after the meal since the fish was cooked on tin foil. Great recipe! Thanks for the share.

Super yummy!  We accidentally made way more topping that the recipe called for--maybe that's because we added some shredded parmesan.  We didn't use an italian herbs--but that didn't hurt the recipe at all!  Served it with a squeeze of fresh lemon--will definitely make this again!

Instead of Dijon, I used whole grain mustard (just a thin layer).  I only sprinkled on enough bread crumbs to cover the fillets, added a bit of tarragon and used a drizzle of olive oil in place of the butter.  Delish!!

My husband loved this. I love a different one better - by same Christyj that uses panko instead f bread crumbs and no butter.  Tastes fresher to me.  It is all good though!

This meal was delicious!! I made it as stated, but (as a suggestion from one of the others) melted the butter in a pot then added the breadcrumbs to it and put it over the salmon. Quick, easy, and great!

I tried this last night for dinner, not changing a thing in the original recipe.
I cannot begin to tell you how delicious it was ! My Hubby and Daughter said it was the best Salmon they ever tasted ! I used Panko Italian Style bread crumbs, so I got a bit of crunch too :)

I am looking forward to cooking this again very soon ~~~ delicious and nutritious ! No more bland Salmon for us :)

This was good.  I sprayed the top with Pam instead of butter as another review had suggested and didn't quite get the baked texture I wanted from the top of the salmon and the bread crumbs, so next time I will follow the recipe exactly and use butter instead.  Also, I found that the parts where the dijon was a little thicker had a lot of the dijon flavor (fine by me, but not those that don't enjoy mustard like I do), so make sure to spread as evenly as possible to get the same flavor throughout.

bread crumbs. I also omit the butter and serve
with lemon juice.

This was an absolutely awesome recipe.  I made the dish with frozen salmon fillets from Costco.  Only change I made was to add a small sprinkle of cayenne and garlic powder to the salt and pepper.  Mixed the butter and breadcrumbs together.  Very succulent and moist and tasty.  A plus!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I'm lactose intolerant so used margarine as a substitution for butter.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs and seasoned them with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It's a solid salmon recipe.

My family did not enjoy it and we always enjoy things with dijon mustard...I don't know why. Anyways I liked the leftover salmon with a bit of mayonaise and turned into a sandwich...gave it a different but good taste.

So easy and yummy! I eyeballed everything - a nice thick layer of stone-ground mustard, coated with panko. I only had plain panko, so I added a seasoning mix that had pepper, garlic, onion, etc...then drizzled olive oil over the top. Healthier than butter and just as tasty. Served with fresh asparagus. Fantastic weeknight meal!

Very good.  I used the butter garlic croutons that were suggested by others and added a little bit of parsley as well.  The Dijon, crouton mix and salmon worked very well together.

This was so yummy, my husband loved it. And it is so simple. I used crushed up garlic croutons instead of Italian bread crumbs. Yum!

This was super easy and fast to prepare.  The flavor when it was done is out of this world!  I've never tasted salmon this good before.  This one is going to become a regular in my repertoire.

Awesome!  I didn't know that Dijon mustard went so well with Salmon.  I used this recipe instead of wrapping it in Parma ham in Jamie Olivers Salmon and Lentil recipe from Return of the Naked Chef - yum!

The wife and I tried it but my wife suggested we try it with biscotti crumbs instead ... hmmmmmm!  So we didn't use the bread crumbs. We used the almond biscotti crumbs from our biscotti jar.  We also used spray on butter in place of the melted butter to hold the crumbs in place then baked.  Once done we let it cool just a little (minute or so) then placed the salmon over a bed of fresh greens with a little dippin' bowl the Dijon.  We thought it tasted pretty good for a nice light lunch.

Prepared this last evening.  So easy and quick to put together and absolutely delicious!  Plan to serve this often to guests as the portions are just right and the presentation looks great.  Know we will continue to enjoy this salmon dish for a long time.  Thanks.

Delicious!  Only change, used garlic/butter crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs, which I always do when a recipe calls for bread crumbs!  No problem with this sticking to the mustard, and was crunchy on top, no need to broil. Very rich, both in taste & appearance!!!

Reynolds makes a new tin foil with one side non stick which I use a lot! I love salmon and decided to try this recipe. Not a big mustard fan I mixed 1/4 cup of finely grated parmesan cheese with Kikkoman Panko breadcrumbs, mixed with butter and baked for 10 minutes @ 400 degrees since I hate overcooked salmon!

Of course living is Seattle means that fresh just caught fish is only minutes away,

Awesome...love salmon, love mustard! Someone referred to it, as a patty. I think someone is confused. I would have liked to have given 4 1/2 stars. Anyway, thanks CHRISTYJ.

I do the same with a layer of kosher salt in a frying pan with a lid. 15 minutes and the fish is ready. No fat used.

This turned out to be pretty good.  If you like salmon, you would appreciate this recipe.  It was a little dry.  I was given the suggestion to add small size shrimp into the patty next time.

I liked the flavor of this salmon, but the topping came out mushy. should have mixed the breadcrumbs with the melted before topping the salmon as suggested.

I've made this according to recipe and loved it. I have also used white or whole wheat panko bread crumbs and I prefer the panko for the crunch. To save on calories I have just spritzed the crumbs with a little olive and I don't miss the butter. I also prefer more Dijon.

This is a great recipie!! So simple and yet so delicious. I took another reviewer's advice and mixed the bread crumbs and melted butter together before coating the fish. It sticks much easier and makes a wonderful crisp coating.

I added a couple of ingredients to make it pop!!! I mixed in a bowl: a little red wine vinegar, a splash of lemon juice, panko Japanese style breadcrumbs, 1/3 melted butter, garlic, black peper, old bay seasoning, mediterranean seafood sauce, spicy brown mustard(out of dijon) and mixed in some olive oil to wet the mixture up.  I spread this over the salmon and thenplaced in preheated oven for @ 15 2o0 mins....delicious!!!!!!!

These were quite good!  My husband made them on the grill (charcoal), which added an extra flavor to them.  The only problem with the grill was that we weren't able to get the top to crisp up.  However, the flavor of the recipe was still great!  We will be using this again...and I think it would work well with other mild fish like tilapia and swai.

Very yummy! I suggest going heavy on the mustard and the bread crumbs to make it even better!

This is delicious. I've only made salmon a few ways and was starting to get bored. I only had regular bread crumbs so I found a recipe for Italian bread crumbs on line. My VERY picky 8 year old asked me to make it again a week later!

We loved this easy recipe! I used a little more digon mustard than it called for and that worked out great. I used the plain panko (coarse chopped) bread crumbs that I had on hand, along with a few dashes of a spice called "Garlic Garni"and that worked out wonderful. So quick & easy to fix, yet it tasted like it was complicated to do. We'll do again for sure! :-)

Great on Tilapia.  Used sweet honey-dijon (generously)  and crushed italian croutons for breading.  There was no need for butter.  Its the only way we baked our fish now.

love this recipe. i found the butter to get a little salty, so now i just leave it out. the bread crumbs add nice texure. i've changed the mustard for variation, and have also substituted lawry's marinade in place of mustard. foil lined pan helps alot.

Very tasty, but I felt it could still use a little something extra.  Maybe some fresh thyme over the dijon mustard.  I would definitely follow the recipe again, but would amend it slightly for more flavor.

Very good, and I really dislike fish, so that is saying something! I added 1 tbs of jalepeno juice to the butter after it was melted. Also followed a suggestion and mixed my bread crumbs and butter/jalepeno mixture. Baked for set time, then broiled on high for two minutes. Turned out perfect, not too squishy but just juicy enough! It wasn't completely crispy like I had expected but the taste is what won me over.

I consider myself someone who likes salmon well enough but I couldn't get enough of this recipe. The mustard flavor wasn't overwhelming as I was afraid of. I agree with the suggestions of pouring the melted butter over your bread crumbs before putting it on the fish. It made the most delicious and crispy topping. Another thing I love about this recipe is the ability to pare it down easily to just 1 or 2 servings. My husband and I will definately have this again, and soon!

A quick, simple, tasty way to prepare salmon.  It was a nice change from a simple baked salmon or teriyaki glaze.  I really enjoyed this.

Tried this tonight and everyone loved it. I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used Spicy Mustard and added about a tablespoon of honey to it. Like someone else suggested, I melted the butter and then added the bread crumbs to it. Then I spread the mixture on top of the salmon. Some notes: I should have used mored bread crumbs - the mix was too moist and I didn't get that nice crispiness I wanted. I needed to bake it longer than 15 min but that may be because I have an elec oven.

The first time I made the recipe exactly. The second time I used honey mustard and drizzled a small amount of EVOO over the crumbs. I liked both, but prefer my version. If you aren't going to grill, this is a good salmon recipe.

I followed the recipe and can say I finally made my first salmon and it was delicious! Thank You! and the other reviews helped too.. I put it in the broiled for about 3 minutes. But that didnt seem like too much of a necessity... the flavor was soooooo good! THANK YOU! And my mother always has a comment/criticism to make... and all she said was... the salmon came out really good... alot of flavor. (it was also a stab at my pasta... but this dish made it all come together!)

This was edible but really blah. I love salmon and mustard, so I thought this would be perfect. But it wasn't. My 14 month old really liked it, but I probably won't ever make again.

Sorry I didn't see anything special about this one. The fish was bland and I seasoned it well. Definitely takes longer than 15 min in the oven and definitely need to broil the top to give it a lil crisp.

This salmon dish was especially good ... I am not a true salmon lover and I really enjoyed this meal.  I did end up adding some dill prior to coating with mustard per the suggestions of others, blended the crumbs and butter and broiled for just a minute.  Broiling helped give the fish a little crunch, did the same thing with a few boneless skinless chicken breasts for those non-fish eaters that I was entertaining and both were a hit.  Elegant and super easy.

I've tried many baked salmon fillets. These were good but mine took about 20+minutes to cook. I dunno if it was the breadcrumb and butter mixture or if my fillets were thicker. Will make again, we enjoyed it!

This was an excellent recipe!  I was apprehensive to try it because of the dijon part, but after reading a few reviews and determining that the dijon really makes a difference, I decided to give it a whirl....it was fabulous!  A very complimentary flavor to the fish w/ the breadcrumbs.  BTW, i used seasoned panko bread crumbs in this recipe, and i think it was a good choice because they cooked up nicely in the oven w/ the butter will definitely make this recipe again!

I could not believe how easy and good this was!  I even cut down a bit on the butter and bread crumbs (taking another reviewers suggestion about mixing the melted butter with the crumbs before putting on top) to save some calories.  Since I think everything needs garlic, I added a little garlic powder to that mixture and it was wonderful.  What a great recipe!  Thanks!

Simplicity with sophistication ~ flavor of the salmon was delicate with a subtle complement of herb mustard cream overtone. Easy preparation, I allowed the fillets to come to room temperature prior to seasoning; Used Trader Joe's Dijon Mustard with White Wine (my personal fav!), added (liberally)  finely chopped fresh dill to panko breadcrumbs (preference for Ian's.) Baked in 400 degree/convection for 7 minutes on preheated baking stone, then drizzled with melted butter and finished baking.  Beautiful presentation, buttery tender, moist, and flavorful ~ it doesn't get any better. Thanks, Christy J!

This was good.  I was not dazzled but I would make again.  I don't know how I would like the leftovers on a salad as suggested.  I did what other suggested and broiled for two minutes to brown top.  Made fish alittle dry so probably would try low broil for one minute if it does anything.  I made recipe as directed  only cut in half.

This recipe was so easy!  I didn't measure anything, just added whatever looked right.  haha.  I had to cook mine a bit longer at 400 and then broiled it for a couple minutes to get the top crunchy.  The dijon was a little overwhelming at first, but it definitely grows on you.  This is actually better the next day (eating leftovers now for lunch!).  Might try using honey mustard to see if we like that better.

I thought this was decent.  The flavors of the dijon mustard and the seasoned bread crumbs were competing too much.  I would recommend using more dijon or cutting back on the breadcrumbs.  Also, extra salt is not needed because of the salt already in the crumbs.  My favorite dijon salmon is still "Baked Dijon Salmon" from this site!

This was pretty good but not what Im looking for in a salmon recipe.  The breading was good and the flavors were OK but I felt it was a little overwhelming.

This was absolutely phenomenal! I was a little suspicious at first because I didn't know how the dijon mustard would taste on the salmon, but it turned out amazing! Even my boyfriend, who HATES mustard, loved it!   I used prepackaged salmon filets, and let them thaw out. I followed some other peoples' advice and melted the butter in the microwave, then stirred in the bread crumbs. The fish turned out crunchy and delicious. Also, I didn't really measure the breadcrumbs or the mustard. I put more on a couple and less on the rest. More mustard is definitely the key!

I'm trying to teach myself how to cook fish, and for just starting out this was a good recipe.  Very simple, fast and tasty. I would add a bit more dijon than called for and I needed more than 1/4 cup of bread crumbs but other than that it was great!

I am a new mom and I needed an easy, delicious way to make salmon- as I just have a few minutes to get something baked before baby wakes from her nap. Awesome recipe and soooo tasty. We already had these ingredients- so it made it even easier. Thanks!!

My sister and I LOVED this! Even my husband who normally hates fish thought it was okay. I put a little too much dijon on, so next time I will spread it a little thinner. I tried combining the butter and crumbs but then it was thick and I couldn't spread it over the dijon so I just ended up sprinkling the crumbs and dripping butter over it and it turned out perfect. Definitely making again!

This is pretty darn good.  I used extra dijon cause I like things moist and spicy.  I also used someone's advice and melted the butter and Panko (Oh yah, I used Panko instead of bread crumbs) to top the salmon instead of drizzling the butter later.  Since I don't measure I'm pretty sure I used extra topping.  All in all - DELICIOUS!

It was okay, in my opinion.  I have a favorite salmon recipe, which I didn't have time to marinate, so thought I would try this one out.  I won't be making this again...it was just so, so.

This was better than the salmon I pay big bucks for at a local restaurant. I will no longer be ordering salmon there when this is right at my fingertips and takes less time than even driving to the restaurant.

Quick, limited ingredients, nice texture, would of actually preferred more mustard and crumbs, and kept most of the recipe as it was except I used honey mustard. I guestimated on the ingredients, just globbed it on really, and was surprised because I didn't think it was going to work. Deserves a 4.5 really, but I know there is probably better out there.

Five stars for ease, flavor, clean-up & presentation! The dijon mustard adds just the right flavor & depth to the salmon fillets & the top crust of bread crumbs looks beautiful. I also used the tip from another reviewer & stirred the bread crumbs into the melted butter before spreading on the salmon. My mother (not much of a salmon-lover) really enjoyed it, as did my husband & I. Served w/ a white burgandy wine. Final tip: make sure you are starting with a lovely, fresh salmon fillet. Salmon is one of those meats that, in my opinion, must really be as fresh as possible to keep down the fishy taste.

This was just okay for us. For some reason the breadcrumbs gave it a sweet taste, so if I make this again I may use panko bread crumbs or crushed butter crackers. I didn't get much taste from the mustard either, so I'd probably use more of it. Haven't decided yet if I want to try this with the changes yet, so we'll see.

Let me preface by saying that I do not care for salmon much at all, but I know how good it is for me, so I force myself to eat some every now and then. I found this recipe and went for it b/c I didn't have to buy anything else for it. (I used crushed saltines instead of breadcrumbs b/c that's what I had) I actually enjoyed it very much. I served it with the garlic sauteed asparagus from this site and brown rice. It was a delish meal considering how healthy it was.

Excellent! I used spicy mustard with molasses and it was absolutely delicious! The mustard did not overwhelm the flavor, and the salmon was moist and delightful! I served it with buttered rice with toasted almond slices and parsley. This is a quick dinner good enough for company!

This had really great flavor. I did add a little of garlic and onion to it like another reviewer suggested and my husband loved it. I only gave it 4 stars becuase I personally thought the flavor was a little overpowering of the fish. Otherwise it was great and the coating kept the fish nice and moist.

Delicious, the crust keeps the moisture in beautifully. I cook it on a bed of onions- yummy.

This is an outstanding recipe - very simple and easy to prepare but incredibly flavorful.  I made it without any modification and served it with the Roasted Asparagus in Butter Balsamic Sauce (another favorite from this site).  It was the perfect quick and delicious weeknight meal.

Easiest salmon recipe I've seen and didn't disappoint in the flavor department. I didn't have dijon so I used 1/2 honey mustard and 1/2 spicy brown mustard. Omitted the butter and drizzled a small amount of olive oil over the top and after baking time, popped it under the broiler to get a nice crust on top. Really good, thanks for sharing!

This was great. We don't eat a lot of fish, but in trying to be healthier, I tried this with a filet of salmon. I was out of dijon and used whole-grain mustard instead. I put about a teaspoon of Creole Seasoning (from this site), then the mustard, then breadcrumbs and melted butter. As per previous reviewers I broiled for 2 mins at the end of the 15-min cooking time to brown the top. My 9yr old daughter liked it but my pickier 7yr old son didn't. Hubby loved it; will keep in our recipe box and make again. Thanks for posting!

My husband adores salmon and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it.  He absolutely loved this dish, I prepared it pretty much as the recipe called using a little less dijon mustard.  Neither of us found it overpowering.

Yummy!! The Dijon mustard has a very Different taste, but good. I baked the Salmon again with mayo instead of mustard and no butter and very little bread crumbs. I added a little dill and a little garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. Serve this with wild rice---It is delicious!

Excellent recipe.  To distribute the butter evenly on each fillet, I drizzled the butter on then smoothed it evenly with the back of a spoon.  I broiled, rather than baked, the salmon which rendered the buttered breadcrumb topping as a nice golden crust.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions of cutting the dijon with honey but I'm not sure it was necessary as the dijon flavor was very mild.  Next time I'll try it without honey.

For my first time ever making salmon, this turned out pretty good.  My husband loved it.  I used too much dijon mustard for my taste, but other than that it was easy and tasty.  Thanks.

For five months all my boyfriend thought I could cook was chicken.  I made this the other night and he was so impressed.  This is so easy and turns out fantastic.  I did do as many of the reviews suggested and added honey.  We both loved it and will be having it again.  Thank you so much.

This salmon was great - it was my first attempt at fish, and it was easy! Didn't taste very fishy, and the breading was perfectly flavorful. I'm sure it helped to be buying fresh salmon and living so close to the water, but this was absolutely great!

I didn't particularly care for this, but my husband raved about it, so I didn't know exactly how to rate it.  After seeing all the other great reviews, I will chalk my own unimpressed experience up to the cut of fish and give it another chance.  Otherwise, I would have rated it a 3.

I bought a big salmon fillet on a whim and needed a recipe for it.  I decided on this one because I had all of the ingredients on hand.  This was DELICIOUS.  My 7 year old daughter loved it! I'll be making this again!

I thought the mustard took over the taste of the salmon.I really messed up by doing 2 large fillets. I plan on removing the mustard and the gooie bread crumbs from the second one. Will not make again...

Great recipe, TRULY quick and easy!  I think that the mustard and breadcrumbs act as some kind of barrier that keeps the salmon nice and moist. Followed the recipe exactly, however didn't need to measure much. I seasoned the fish first, then spread on just enough mustard to cover.  Didn't need the full 1/4 cup of bread crumbs or butter - again, just enough to cover.  cooded for exactly 15 minutes and fish came out perfect!  The topping didn't get crispy at all, but added a great flavor. Will make this again and again!!!

Easy and delicious. And by scaling it down, I learned that there are 4 TBS in a 1/4 C.

I thought this was OK, but after 2 or 3 bites my husband started scraping off the topping.  We both love salmon, but when he finally finished his he tactfully said that he "wasn't fond of it made that way".  I won't be making it again.

Excellent for a fast salmon dish because it uses only a few ingredients readily on hand.  A perfect everyday family recipe...just not that flavorful and exciting for company...or for more stars.

This was a great recipe!  I took someone's advice and seasoned with Old Bay as well.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.  I think the people who didn't like this recipe are either not big salmon eaters or mustard lovers.

I was looking for an easy recipe for salmon without resorting to the standard "baked w/lemon pepper".  I thought this recipe would be very basic but was surprised when it turned out extra YUMMY.  Serve this salmon with asparagus, pasta w/butter & parmesan and you have a quick, easy, and healthy meal in under 30 minutes!  It passed the kids finicky taste test.  They ate ALL of it!

This was wonderful!
The whole family really liked it; even the non-fish lovers asked if there was any more.
I didn't have Dijon, but it worked just fine with spicy brown mustard.
I will definately make this again!

This recipie was great but as some users suggested I made a few minor modifications. I started with using less mustard and mixing it with honey. Then I used cornflakes seasoned with italian seasonings. The what made this recipie killer was I butterflied the salmon and put a thin layer of the mustard mixture on the inside of the salmon and then closed it back up, so when we ate it, it was oozing with flavor. All in all it was great!

Fixed this recipe tonight and we loved it!  Did have to cook a little longer because the salmon was thick (around 25 minutes) - my husband who is not a big salmon fan thought it was great!  Will be fixing again soon.

This recipe is great.  I have never really liked salmon but this recipe has me wanting more.  We substituted the butter with spray butter, since it is 0 cals and 0 fat.  And it taste great!  I will definatly be making this recipe again and again.

Delicious!!!  I serve salmon 1-2 times per week already and now will probably be serving even more!!  My 6 year old LOVED it and so did I.  I did add a little Old Bay seasoning to it which I always add to salmon and we love it that way!!!  Yummy!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious.  I was not a big salmon fan until I tried this recipe.  I omit the butter when I cook this now, otherwise butter just runs off the breadcrumbs.  I did not find this affected the moistness of the fish.

Very easy!  I loved how quickly I was able to get this into the oven.  The next time I make it I am going to try plain bread crumbs instead of italian flavored.  The mustard was competing with the italian seasonings.  I couldn't decide which flavor was coming through.

I thought this recipe was fabulous.  I skinned my fillets before baking and cut the butter in half. Everything else I left the same.  The salmon just melts in your mouth. I had to stop my husband from eating it all!

Absolutely delicious!  Like many other reviewers, I couldn't imagine the taste of mustard with salmon (who thought that up, anyway?) but I agree it's an excellent combination.  Company-worthy, but only takes a few minutes to prepare.  Thanks, Christine!

The flavors are wonderful, and I agree with other "posters"--no "fishy" smell in the kitchen afterwards!! Yeah!

This is soooo easy and delicious. I love the fact that I have everything in my kitchen, no need to run to the grocery store for ingredients. The only thing I changed is (1) cut butter down to 2 tbsp, and (2) reduced Dijon mustard because I have small children.

This was a hit with my husband who is very picky about his salmon!  He's the salmon cook in the house (wood smoked on the BBQ).  Will definately make this one again. C. Ferris

I made this dish for my extremely salmon-picky boyfriend, and I'm not that skilled in cooking fish. He'd tell me if he didn't like it...it was gone in under 5 minutes and he finished mine, too. I substituted crushed up salted pretzels for the breadcrumbs and added some Italian seasoning, which is great if you're a salt fan. It wasn't overly salty, but good. I'll be doing this again soon! Thanks!

Couldn't be easier but adds a nice flavor.  No other seasoning is necessary.  This is a good one.

This was ok. I did have to bake it about 30-35 minutes, and there was too much melted butter. 2-3 tbsp should be enough, unless you love lots. I'll try the baked dijon salmon recipe next time.

Wanted to try something different from my "usual" salmon preparation.  My husband is not fond of dijon mustard but he raved about this recipe.  I loved the easy/quick prep time and the great flavor.  May replace my "usual" salmon recipe.

This is a delicious baked fish recipe! I wanted to try it for supper tonight. I didn't have any salmon on hand. I had some frozen flounder filets so I used them. It was very tasty! I will use salmon the next time I make this. My husband doesn't usually like baked fish, but he ate two pieces. He said it didn't have a "fishy" taste. It looks like I will be serving baked fish more often! Thanks, Christine

I have made this several times and it was a real hit.  My only change was to add 1/2 c of crushed pecans into the breadcrumbs (I used Panko).  It gives an even better crunch.

Very easy and tasty!  Made exactly as written except substituted crushed Ritz crackers for breadcrumbs (I didn’t have on hand). Will definitely make again.

Delish. I did the melted butter & breadcrumbs combo. Added slivered almonds. Baked for 22 mins b/c it was a thick cut of king salmon. Broiler for browning & crispy topping. Mouth watering good.

I add 1 clove of garlic to the mustard. Then I add about 1/2 of shredded cheese (I like mozzarella the best) the the breadcrumb mixture. Adding these makes a huge difference.

Delicious.  I made it according to recipe but used Panko bread crumbs.  I did not add salt, but admit that we salted it at the table.  Served with a salad and baked potatoes, cleanup was quick and easy.

I will be making this again.  Like others I changed a few small things.  Olive Oil instead of Butter, doubled the mustard, mixed Dijon & delicatessen style together (only because I had that on hand, you can use any) Used panko and cooked for 12 minutes.  Hubby loved it

Lovely way to make salmon!  I did use the melting butter and mixing breadcrumbs, before adding to top salmon.  It was abosultely delicious.  I love fish, so this will be something I use on other fish as well.  But salmon is so healthy:)  We enjoyed this enormously.

This recipe has converted me to a fish person! I used crispy onions, that I mash up, instead of bread crumbs. And I added some lemon juice to the mustard. Delicious with some zucchini and squash baked right along side of the fish.

I pretty much followed the recipe. I used enough Dijon to coat each fillet. The one change I made was to spray the fillet with cooking spray after I applied the Panko bread crumbs. They browned nicely.

My husband loved it! I had to substitute unseasoned breadcrumbs but shook a little italian seasoning over each filet and put a dollop of butter in top of each to melt and flow down to the pan. Tasted great!

I liked that this recipe was so easy - I am no great cook, and probably why it didn’t turn out as well as I had hoped.  It was a little overcooked and I think I should not have used all the butter.  I will definitely try the recipe again, but next time I will season the salmon with salt and pepper first before spreading the mustard on top.  I will also try reducing cooking time to 12-13 minutes, as I do like it a little bit pink; and I will use a little less better.

This salmon was absolutely divine!  I had 2 thick salmon fillets that I seasoned with s&p and brushed with Dijon Mild & Creamy Mustard.  I combined Italian Panko bread crumbs and melted butter (per a reviewer); then baked them at 375 for 20 min. in my toaster oven. YUMMO!  I will definitely be making these again.

I made this for my family but unfortunately I was out of Dijon mustard so I substituted a gourmet garlic mustard that I had purchased at a fair and the flavor was amazing!  I still sprinkled a little salt and pepper on it but everyone loved the flavor.  Not overpowering but just enough to enhance the flavor of the salmon.

This was amazing!  Our absolute new favorite way to eat salmon.  I had a 1.7 lb long single piece of fish, so I doubled the toppings, skipping  the salt since we are trying to be lower sodium - it truly wasn't missed.  I melted a whole stick of butter in a small bowl in the microwave, then added all the other ingredients (mustard too!), along with some garlic, basil, oregano, and parsley since my bread crumbs were unseasoned.  Topped the salmon entirely, and baked the 16 minutes at 400 degrees, top rack, and checked.  The thicker side of the salmon needed more cooking, so I flipped the foil over to cover (without touching foil to fish) the skinny side and stuck it back in the oven for about 7 more minutes.  Perfection!  Thanks for this great recipe!  P.S. it's even better the next day.

This has become a regular rotation meal for my wife and I and a favorite way to make salmon. We often grill salmon with dill, a taste that goes great with salmon, but nothing compares to how well mustard accents the flavor of salmon. It's also way easier to bake the salmon than to grill it. I use an instant read thermometer and take it out at around 125° and let the carry over temp finish the cooking. Five stars all day long

This was pretty good. I made exactly as recipe stated. I think maybe a little bit of lemon juice to the butter might have added enough spark to make it a five star.

We loved this, although I think I overdid it on the dijon just a tad.  I made homemade bread crumbs and sauteed them in some butter until crispy and dark golden.  This was easy and delicious.  I'll definitely make again.

Fast, easy and delicious.  Didnt have Italian bread crumbs so used regular crumbs and sprinkled fish with oregano and garlic powder.  Baked for only 11 minutes.

This is one of those dishes that you can play with a little. But Dijon mustard is a must, then I add a little mayonnaise and some Parmesan cheese. Spread it all over a single large salmon fillet, then dab chunks of butter on the top breadcrumbs over that and pop it in the oven. Salt and pepper quite a bit. Sometimes I use gluten-free Italian breadcrumbs. Even more flavor.

I made this for my husband for dinner tonight (I had something else).  I put more dijon mustard and used ghee instead of butter.   He loved it.  I made it with some green beans tossed in ghee and garlic powder.  Will make again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Great easy dish to make. I agree with RebeccaAnne22s suggestion of cooking the breadcrumbs with the butter prior to adding it on top of the salmon. Other than that this is a fantastic recipe!

This was an excellent receipt for salmon.  Add panko bread crumbs and eliminate adding salt.  This is a “ keeper “.  Will be sure to cook again in the near future.

Watch what brand of bread crumbs you use.  I didn't pay attention and bought a store brand that turned out to have double the sodium  compared to Progresso and unfortunately made the salmon way too salty.  The first bite or two were very good but the sodium became more noticeable with each bite.  We had to scrape the bread crumbs off in order to finish eating it.  Other than that the mustard gave the salmon a nice tang and I will fix this again.

This was an excellent simple Salmon entree.  The filet's we had did not have skins so we put mustard and bread crumbs on both sides before baking.   In addition, we did not add melted butter to the top.  Halfway through I flipped the filet's.  Very delicious and moist.

Very good! I took someone’s Suggestion and mixed the breadcrumbs with the butter then put it on top of the salmon. I also adjusted the time in the oven because of how my oven cooks and it does not take long for salmon to cook. Thanks CHRISTYJ for the recipe!

This is my go to recipe for fish!  I have used it for salmon and tilapia so far and it is absolutely delicious.  I use Herbes de Provence with plain bread crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs . The previous reviewer is on point about the bread crumbs and butter - it makes a big difference.

I made it as directed this time. My son and I liked it a lot. I'm not a huge mustard fan but the Dijon seemed to keep it moist and gave it a nice flavor since it was a thin smear. I was careful not to overcook the salmon since I used fresh wild Cojo which is thinner than the farm-raised. It was perfect and I had made a garlic dill sauce (with sour cream/mayo/dill weed/garlic powder/salt/pepper/lemon).
Those flavors went together in a most awesome way IMHO.

I may try to broil, grill or use my air fryer the next time for a slightly different texture.

I followed the recipe except used olive oil drizzled on instead of butter. It was perfectly cooked and very light and tasty. It maybe could use a fresh herb element, but all in all we liked it and will try again.

Been making this for years. As a healthier version, rub both sides with olive oil before applying salt, pepper, and mustard, then omit the butter and breadcrumbs. Sometimes I add dill, garlic, or lemon.

One of my favorites I have made so far.  This is so good!  I was worried because my family doesn't like mustard (esp yellow mustard) so I decided that I would serve it without telling anyone.  Everyone ate seconds before I told them what was on top.

So simple, fast and delicious.  My deviations were minor.  I used half EVOO with half of the melted butter.  I mixed panko instead of bread crumbs Into that.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.   The following week I used this sauce/topping idea on some flounder fillets.  I did let them sit in the frig with the mustard for about 45 min as I thought of it early enough.  The flounder is so thin that I really only needed to broil it a few minutes for the fish to be cooked through.  BEST FLOUNDER I've ever made.  I won't hesitate to try this idea with other items.  Thanks CHRISTYJ!!

Awesome Salmon recipe.  Took the advise of another reviewer and mixed garlic powder with breadcrumbs & packed it on the fillet, used olive oil instead of butter & after baking for 15 min. broiled it for 2 min. so the tupping got nice & crunchy.  Served it with side of angel hair pasta & asparagus.   Christy THANK YOU for sharing your recipe.

In place of breadcrumbs, I used ground almond and pecan meal....The exchange was acceptable. Dish was easy to prepare with minimal work. Tasty.

This recipe is amazing! I used spicy Dijon mustard, homemade "shake and bake" for the bread crumbs and drizzled it with butter. We grilled it on a grilling mat instead of baking it. My husband said it was the best salmon he's ever had--better than restaurants!

It was nice and moist but I don't think the breadcrumbs added much flavor to it.  I liked the mustard by I have to rethink what to add on top.

Made this with Rebecca's suggestion to mix the breadcrumbs in butter first.  I microwaved the butter and dumped in some panko crumbs, then added some seasoning to that.   Baked for fifteen min at 400 then broiled for two min.  Fish was moist and so flavorful.   Turned out amazing.   Both kids loved it and asked it be added to dinner rotation.

This is my "go to" recipe for quick easy salmon.  Add some smoked paprika and a touch of liquid smoke, tastes just like it came off the grill.  Top with sautéed  mushrooms, butter and garlic ... a feast for the palate!

I baked this exactly the way it was given and we loved it.  I thought I liked my salmon baked in sweet sauces, but this was by far the best.  I even served it to someone who does not like salmon at all, and they loved it to.

Made essentially as posted. Will alter some proportions / add some ingredients next time. Tasty dish, quick & easy to prep ... cook time proved ambitious in my view, leaving a portion of the *single* level of filet I used slightly underdone after 15 min @ 400 + 10 min @ 410ish. I do NOT overcook fish & we both like sushi / sashimi, so this was fine. Still, I regard time as ambitious. Added dill as others suggested & used a faint dusting of half-sharp Hungarian paprika in lieu of pepper to enhance taste / visual appeal.

This is an awesome dish! The combination of the bread crumbs with the dijon mustard is perfect. I followed the recipe perfectly and have made it several times.

Made this per the recipe with minor modifications based on reviews.  Used olive oil instead of butter; added garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce (1 Tbsp ea) to mustard sauce (for a half portion).  It was good, but not great.  I'll try again using different variations from reviews.  Will try  with margarine instead of olive oil, and also with no butter at all.  Baked for 15 min. per recipe; baked another 5 minutes. Could have used another 5 minutes more.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe three times in the last three weeks!  Prep is quick and easy, cleanup a breeze thanks to foil-lined baking dish, and the fish is absolutely delicious!  This is my new go-to dish for company.

I followed the recipe & it is absolutely delicious!  Sent it to a few friends.  My house doesn't smell fishy either.  Such an easy & quick meal.  Going to try it next time wrapped in foil on the gas grill.

It was good. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the topping was mushy. I will use the broiler on it next time.

So easy and a quick recipe after skiing all day!  Ingredients are all on hand, I used plain breadcrumbs but sprinkled on dried Italian seasoning. I served with mixed veggies and a fruit bowl of bananas & apples sprinkled with cinnamon and a few drops of honey. I will definitely bake our salmon this way again.

I was skeptical because dijon on salmon or chicken aren't a favorite of mine. So knowing that we reduced the amount of dijon to give it a fair chance. It was just ok. The fish was dry from baking at 400 so I would recommend a lower temp or at the least for a shorter period of time. I think with just the Italian bread crumbs & butter over the top would be better.

It was great. My first time with this recipe. My wife isn't much of a fish eater, so only had a small piece. I couldn't keep out of it and ended up eating all the rest of it in one Sitting! Really good with the dejou mustard. I'll definitely make this again. Wife can have the vegetables! :-)

We didn't care for it becausethe mustard overpowered the dish... .I'm not big on mustard to begin with but even the Mustard Lovers thought that the it over powered the whole dish and didn't allow the taste of the Salmon to come through at all.

So good! I had a salmon filet I had to make because it was getting to be that time... anyways, found this recipe and it looked pretty easy and had great ratings so I decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did! I followed the advice of others, mixing the butter and breadcrumbs together as well as broiling it for the last two minutes. Super quick and easy and my boyfriend loved it! Will definitely keep this one on hand.

Simple to make and simply delicious.  I added a touch of parmesan.  Ate half of a 6-oz fillet and saved the other half to put on a salad the next day for lunch.  Almost better cold!

We didn't care for the mustard flavor. In our opinion it detracted from  rather than enhancing the naturally delicious flavor of the salmon.  Disappointed.

Being from south Louisiana, we eat a lot of seafood. This is a terrific recipe and I am going to try it using some of our local fish. I spread the mustard using my fingers and mixed the bread crumbs with just a very little soft yogurt butter before putting it on the fish. That's all the butter I used.  I broiled the fish after cooking to toast the bread crumbs more. Wow!

I made a double recipe of this for a celebration dinner with friends from work.   As pre-made Italian seasoned bread crumbs aren't easily come by where I currently live I made my own using an Italian herb blend - 1/2 tsp per 1/4 cup of crumbs.  This was a big hit and people asked for the recipe.  As I was using frozen fillets, I cooked them for about 20-25 minutes.  Will definitely make this again and not just for special occasions, either!

We have some kind of fish at least once a week, and have salmon every other week. So I am always looking for new ways to make it. I did mix the bread crumbs with the melted butter before putting them on the salmon, and  baked the salmon in a NuWave oven. In the Nuwave oven at 375 degrees, it took about 10 minutes to bake. We thought the salmon had good flavor and really like the crunchy topping. I will definitely be making this again.

This  recipe is simple to make and couldn't be more delicious.  My husband is not a big fan of salmon, but loved this dish.  Keta Salmon is mild tasting but this was full of flavor with the few ingredients needed.  He told me he'd eat this every week!

Definitely keep and eye on it, as you easily overcook. I followed suggestions to mix breadcrumbs and butter together. Finished off with a few minutes under broiler to brown, so I should've eased up on cook time.  It still turned out tasty .

The salmon was delicious. I used all the ingredients in the recipe and the recommended changes which included melting the butter mixing in the Panko and  spreading it over the mustard. Next time I make this I will use sweet mustard. The mustard adds a lot to this recipe.

Love it, a quick, easy and delicious recipe.  I do love salmon but this a new favorite way to prepare it!  Did make one change, instead of using the butter, after layering the mustard and bread crumbs I drizzled with olive oil before baking

I ended up mixing the whole topping together and putting it on the salmon.  I really should have put the mustard on first as directed.  I liked it, though!  Husband thought was OK, kids don't like dijon so picked the breading off.

Excellent. Used suggestions of adding bread crumbs to melted butter and broiling for last two minutes (of 15). Used Panko crumbs. Delish!

I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used Guldens brown mustard.  I loved the recipe because it was very tasty and very easy to make.

Love this recipie!  The only thing I changed was I used creole mustard instead of Dejon because that was all I had.  We had a guest over for dinner and she really enjoyed it too.  I served it with a baked sweet potato and salad.  This will be my go to recipie for quicky and easy dinner!

So easy, quick, and still very nice.  Hubs doesn't usually care for salmon, and, .... while he has other favorite ways of preparing salmon that he likes better, this is the fastest. CHANGES: I had minced some garlic for another recipe that we couldn't make because my husband received a call and he had to have dinner before we could get the fish marinated.  This recipe was quick enough. Tossed the minced garlic in.  Nice touch. -  When we need a quick salmon dish, this will fit the bill, and he does like it.  Poor daughter, she doesn't care for anything salmon..... Next time,  we'll try melting the butter in the saucepan to toast the crumbs in the pan.  We might try it without the butter too (maybe spray if anything).

The salmon was very moist but I thought the italian bread crumbs overpowered the taste of the fish.  I might try regular panko breadcrumbs next time.

Made this tonight for a quick dinner. Very delicious I forgot to add the salt and pepper but if I did I believe it would have been too salty. I but it on a bed of lettuce with olive oil and vinegar went well.

I melted the butter in a pan and added the mustard along with diced garlic. Then I added seasoned bread crumbs and pat it on top of the salmon before baking. Dee-lish!! I might try without the butter next time as someone suggested to save calories. Will be making this again and again!

My husband I enjoyed this salmon. My salmon steaks were thick so I cooked them for 20 minutes. I did add about a teaspoon of honey to the store brand Dijon mustard. I did not find it necessary to use the aluminum foil and mixed the butter with the bread crumbs, but I think it would have been better if I had followed the recipe instructions and just put the  bread crumbs on top and sprinkled with the melted butter as the recipe stated.  I did need to pop it under the broiler for a minute to brown it up. Very flavorful.

I love salmon so this was a perfect recipe to try out. It was amazing, I used salmon without skin just used cooking spray on the foil under the salmon and baked on 400 for 15 minutes. I also used Rebeccaanne22's tip of melting the butter in a pan and adding the breadcrumbs, spreading it was easy and even! I also used honey mustard instead of dijon due to dijon having higher sodium.

This came out delicious. I added the breadcrumbs to the butter like someone suggested. I seasoned the salmon to taste and crushed up seasoned croutons for my breadcrumbs.

Used the tip from another reviewer about toasting the crumbs with butter in a pan before topping the salmon and it worked perfectly! We found this simple and tasty, but a little salty. Next time maybe I'll use unsalted butter or a different type of bread crumbs. My salmon was done in about 15 minutes. It really depends on how thick your fillets are. All in all a really good basic recipe and exactly what we needed to shake up our normal butter/garlic/ lemon fish routine. Thanks!

Nice and easy, thanks to the hint to mix the bread crumbs with the  butter and then spread. I also added a little garlic to the butter for taste. Used Panko bread crumbs because its all I had. Still tasted great.

This had a great sassy taste and was super easy to make.  I used half the recommended butter and cooked the breadcrumbs in the butter for a couple of minutes before baking.

This is a quick and easy recipe to put together, and delicious to boot! I prefer to season the salmon with salt and pepper before slathering it with Dijon mustard on top. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and nice change from sweet salmon recipes, plus it didn't need to be marinated.  As recommended, I quickly put the bread crumbs in the melted butter so the topping was crunchy once baked for 15 minutes. I served it with asparagus; definitely on my rotation.

I have made this dish many times over, without changing a single thing! The only problem I have, is forgetting what temperature to put the oven on- so I refer back to the recipe each time. This is a quick, easy dish to make, yet it tastes complex. I have made it for friends and family, and no one has ever been anything less than impressed! I usually pair it with rice and a vegetable on the side. Delicious! It's difficult to go wrong with this dish!

This was moist and delicious!   I only made 2 fillets.  I used Italian flavored croutons,  which I sauteed in the butter before putting on the salmon.  This gave the salmon a nice brown topping.  I did not have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard and added  1/2 teaspoon of honey to it.  The fish was cooked for 20 minutes at 400, and was perfect.

my husband liked this very much. use less Dijon and less breadcrumbs than you think. more is not better. the video is very good. I would recommend doing it the way they prepare it by mixing the bread crumbs and butter together.

I did everything but used olive oil instead of butter, it might taste better with butter but olive oil works in a pinch (goes well with garlic cauliflower (and cooks at the same temperature!))

Really loved this recipe.  I used a little ground ginger to season with the salt and pepper which added a little zing with this flavorful dish.  I also broiled  the fish to brown the bread crumbs for 3-5 minutes after I completed baking.

Tried this tonight for my husband and myself, so halved the recipe.  Also followed a few reviewers' suggestions of mixing the butter and bread crumbs together before placing on top of the salmon.  Made my own bread crumbs and seasoned with oregano, garlic powder, a little salt and pepper, and red chili flakes.  Timing was good, although I reduced it by about two minutes (since there were only 2 filets), then set the temp to broil for a minute to get more crispy.  We both really liked this; I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

The single thing that I like best about this recipe is that what you really TASTE is the salmon itself, not the glaze, topping, marinade or whatever else people do with salmon filets.  The salmon flavor is the star!  I'm never been a huge salmon fan, but my husband loves it. Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon has been on sale for the last couple weeks @ $7.99/lb, so I picked up a good-sized filet for dinner last night.  And I must say I enjoyed this recipe more than any other way that I've prepared a salmon filet.  Tender, flaky, and moist with a crunchy topping, and sooooooo easy to prepare.  As many reviewers recommended, mixed the melted butter and breadcrumbs (used Italian panko) together and then patted onto the filet.   Loved, loved, loved it, this now will be my go-to recipe.  I've joined the Salmon Lovers Club!

This is one of my favorite salmon recipes! I crave it all the time. I usually add a little more mustard than it calls for because I like the taste. I never have italian flavored bread crumbs in the cupboard so I just top with plain crumbs and then sprinkle seasoning over that...garlic, onion, basil, oregano. No matter the slight variations, it always comes out delicious.

This is a keeper.  I modified it slightly by addings some panko to the bread crumbs.  Also mixed the Dijon with a little "Oyster Sauce.   Everyone liked it including the wife who's REALLY pickie!

The mustard was a bit overpowering to the taste of the salmon.  I liked the idea (which is why I tried it).  With the recipe saying to put the bread crumbs on before the butter, it turned out a bit oily for my tastes.  I ended up broiling the top to make it a bit crunchier.   Probably won't do mustard again.

Absolutely delicious!  So darn easy!  I love a recipe that you can use basic stuff from your fridge, freezer, and or cabinet that you always have on hand.  I used seasoned panko bread crumbs and instead of using melted butter, I used can't believe it's not butter spray, saved on fat and calories! I LOVE that stuff and it turned out great!

I'm giving it 4 stars for the ease of preparation and the flavor together. Flavor on its own would be a 3. Not bad at all. Wish I had read the review that explained how much sauce this made, because it really is a lot.

This was a great meal for me and my boyfriend. Very easy to make and excellent tasting. I will definitely be making this again. I added some Alfredo and broccoli to complete the meal.

I have made a few salmon recipes from this site all with great success. I liked them all but this one is easily the best of the lot. I had a slab of salmon which I didn't cut into smaller fillets due to laziness. I smeared the fillet with Dijon THEN noticed the recipe said a thin layer..Oops! I decided to mix in a little honey to lessen the mustard flavour. The rest of the recipe I followed to the letter. Since it was such a big piece of fish I baked for 18 minutes. It was so moist and delicious. The touch of honey was just perfect too. I got rave reviews for this one and will definitely become a 'company' recipe.

This looked great when I pulled it from the oven.  But, Dijon mustard and salmon are simply a no-go.  Maybe this recipe would've worked with a milder fish like Tilapia...or maybe just omit the dijon and bake with fresh herbs.

I did not like the Italian breadcrumb's flavor over powering the natural good flavor of the salmon.

Delicious.  I don't recommend putting salt on it though.  I made this last night and it was way too salty.  I think I might have overdone it with the salt, and salmon is a salty fish to begin with.  I neutralized the salt by sprinkling sugar on it.  I made this dish with a side of "Red garlic mashed potatoes" MMMmmm.

Absolutely love, love, love it! I never write reviews but this recipe is almost life-changing.  I made it with potato mash and felt like a master chef! It was that good and I didn't even have an oven...I fried it a little and then put it under the microwave grill (the kind that grills from the top).  Turned out perfect! Unbelievable!

This was delicious, me and my boyfriend loved it. He actually complimented me a few times during the meal! I did change a couple things. I added some low-fat mayo to the dijon mustard, and then seasoned the salmon with salt, pepper, and dill before putting on the mustard-mayo mixture. I also left out the butter, but sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over the breadcrumbs. To complete the meal I added asparagus to the oven after putting in the chicken, popped some instant brown rice in the microwave, and it was one easy, quick, tasty meal!

I really was surprised by this. I wasn't sure I'd like it, but my boyfriend and I thought it was great! I think that next time I will make a dijon sauce with cream to make it a little less hot. Another thing I did was I broiled it for about 5 minutes to make it crispy. Worked great! :) Thanks for the interesting recipe.

SO GOOD! i was uneasy about the combination of italian breadcrumbs and dijon mustard, but it turned out to be a fantastic flavor.   The best part of this recipe by far is how easy it is!

I put the dijon mustard on it... then salted and peppered it... then used some Pizza seasoning cause I didn't have the Italian bread crumbs... I used whole wheat bread crumbs... and barely put  any butter on top... just a smidge....   put it on aluminum foil in a preheated 400 degree oven and baked until it was about 140 degrees.... I used a meat thermometer... IT WAS WONDERFUL

I used about half as much Dijon and found the flavor to be amazing.  As another rater said, the salmon was a bit mushy, so I'll try broiling next time.  All in all, very flavorful and delicious, and I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Very good flavor.  I dont usually care for salmon but the mustard and the bread crumbs made a great combo.  My boyfriend said the flavors were too strong but he went back for seconds.  Either that means he liked it...or was just REALLY hungry!

So simple and so tasty!  I also combined the butter and bread crumbs to make it crispy.  All I had was regular bread crumbs so I added some season I had in the cupboard and it still came out tasty!  I will be keeping this recipe close by.

Easy and delicious.  Using foil on the pan leaves no clean-up as well.  The fish lifted right off the skin when I used the spatula to transfer it to a serving dish.  Moist and yummy!

Pretty good. I skipped the butter to save calories and omitted the salt. Still turned out pretty good. I served it w/ rice pilaf and steamed asparagus. This will be one of my go-to recipes for those busy week nights. Thanks!

Extremely easy and very delicious. I love mustard, and it keeps the salmon really moist. Plus, if you use tinfoil in the pan, there is absolutely no cleanup!

This was really good!  My husband and I both really liked it and my husband thinks that he doesn't like salmon!  Definitely a keeper and also guest-worthy!!  I baked the fish for 15 minutes and then stuck it under the broiler for a minute to crisp the bread crumbs.  Delicious!

Made this tonight, wasn't too keen on the flavour with the salmon but I think this would be delicious over something like chicken or pork. Great marinade, not so good with the fish.

Very good, and simple! The only thing I didn't like is that my topping came out a little soft...next time I will put it under the broiler for a minute to make it a little more crunchy.

The prep time on this dish was 5-10 mins at the most. And the salmon came out moist, flaky and flavorful. Served alongside some steamed veggies and the meal was filling and healthy! DELICIOUS....

I was sceptical as I usually only make salmon with a honey soy glaze b/c that is what the family likes and requests. I wasn't sure how the mustard would taste but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. What I did in order to mellow the mustard was to subsitute the dijon with a honey dijon as some of the other reviews suggested. It wasn't too sweet and blended nicely.  The entire family loved it. Now I do not have young children they are late teens/young adults. I don't think I would have tried this recipe in earlier days. This is a keeper.

This was so easy to make and really good.  My boyfriend loved it because it was flavorful without being too overwhelming on the spices.  I made it again for a girlfriend of mine and had the same results.  I served it will a rice and green beans with a touch of butter and Herbes de Provence.  I would really recommend it.

This is one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon. Here is a variation I like to do (all measurements are approximate!) for two salmon fillets: in a small bowl, mix 1 tb melted butter, 1 tb dijon mustard, 1 tb honey, 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tb breadcrumbs. Spread a thin layer over the salmon (the thinner you make the sauce, the more you can taste the salmon, of course). Top with diced pecans, and bake 15-20 min at 400. Serve with cous-cous and veggies.

I suggest using this with thick fillets. If they are narrow then the Dijon overpowers the salmon.

Very interesting way to prepare salmon. We tried using honey dijon instead of regular dijon and the sweetness complimented the salmon well. We also excluded the butter topping, which made it healthier. It was quick and easy to prepare. Would recommend this recipe to others!

This was so easy and quick with amazing taste. I added some fresh dill from the garden before cooking it. I bet green onions would be good too. I will definitely bake salmon this way again.

Came across this recipe completely by accident one morning while I was trying to come up with a different way to eat/cook my salmon for lunch.  SOOOO easy and sooo good!  I just spread a 6 oz fillet of wild-caught sockeye salmon with dijon, added a sprinkle of kosher salt and a grind of black pepper, then hit it with a little ribbon of olive oil.   Baked it on a piece of non-stick foil for 10 minutes, it was perfectly moist and flavorful....I loved it!!

I used Grey Poupon and plain bread crumbs. I just sprinkled a little sage and thyme on the very top. These turned out great! My husband doesn't really like salmon, but he had seconds of this!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. Had ladies from my church over. They loved it. It was so simple. I used larger salmon fillets but did everything suggested in the recipe. I will add this to my favorite recipes. I served it with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil, (recipe from this site) and green beans. Wonderful!!!

I was very surprised on how well this tasted with very few ingredients!  The whole family loved it and asked for seconds.  I also tried the Orzo Parmesan and garlic (also found on this website).  Both went together very well.
Thanks

This is such a simple recipe for salmon, but it's quite tasty. The dijon mustard is really complementary to the fish, but is unexpected so it's a pleasant surprise. Add to that the fact that it's so quick, and it's makes having a great tasting dinner a reality during a busy weeknight. I will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend I LOVED this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was substitute honey mustard for the dijon and I added some minced garlic.  Also, I had to bake it for a bit longer as the salmon didn't flake easily in such a short time.  I made it with an side of asparagus, which I sauteed in almost the same mixture, minus the honey mustard.  Delicious!

One of my favorite ways to prepare salmon.  I do everything as is but add some crushed toasted pine nuts in with the breadcrumbs.  It's really a hearty and satisfying meal.

Not bad but it was hard to get the amount of Dijon mustard right when varying the amount of fish used. It came out nicely the first time, but the next two times I spread a little too much on the fish and it was overpowering.

My family all loved this recipe.  I used yellow mustard, (I was out of Dijon,) and then added curry powder, turmeric, and onion and garlic salt.  I also grated some parmesan cheese over the top and used freshly ground black pepper.  I served with baked fingerling potatoes.  It was delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent way to cook salmon without making a healthy entree unhealthy.  I've made it twice - once with Italian breadcrumbs and once with panko crumbs.  I thought I would like the panko better because it's crunchier, but I actually think the Italian seasoned crumbs are better suited for it.  I didn't use the butter - I sprayed the tops with butter-flavored Pam.  Crisped it nicely.

This was absolutely delicious.

Both my husband And I loved this so much.  the layer of bread crumbs really helped to keep it moist inside.  It wasn't at all dry like salmon usually is when anyone else cooks it.
Fabulous recipe! And it tastes so much more complex than it really is. :)

YUM! This salmon recipe was absolutely delicious. The bread crumbs provided a nice seal for the fish, which kept it nice and moist. It was incredibly fast and easy to make. I added a little extra mustard, for a little zing. I also used panko style bread crumbs just because I like the texture better. I'll definitely be making this again...

Delicious!  I used the dijon called for in the recipe, but I substituted panko breadcrumbs and a spray of olive oil on top because that's what I had in the pantry.  This was yummy and so easy!

Another good recipe from Christine Johnson! My Dijon-hating husband loved this- hahaha!!! (he'll never know) Healthy & tasty. Check at 15 minutes- I did 20 & may have overcooked it some. If you carefully spoon your butter over the crumbs, it works. Oh- I also didn't measure the Dijon- just spooned a little on each fillet & spread thinly.

This recipe is wonderful.  I usually make it using tilapia filets though instead of salmon.  In my opinion the salmon has such a complex flavor already that the topping did not work that well and works better on a more mild fish.  I make this on a regular basis now.

Love the change of pace for the Dijon Salmon.  Even my non-fish eating husband liked it.  Excellent change from the standard butter, dill and lemon.

I thought this was pretty good. I added 2 tablespoons of honey to tone down the dijon and heated it in a saucepan, also added a little minced garlic. It was a nice change from the usual salmon recipes, I loved the breadcrumbs. I'll make it again.

I liked this recipe until the next day when it was my lunch and it tasted horrible. My husband did not like this dish at all. He took a few bites and scraped everything off the salmon.

Very moist.  Husband loved.  I did not have Italian-style bread crumbs so I used garlic & herb-style bread crumbs.  I ended up having to cook a little longer due to having thick fillets.  Very easy & fast to make.  Thanks Christine

I substituted fresh halibut steaks rather than salmon and the taste was excellent. I added Italian seasonings to my regular breadcrumbs for a little extra flavor and everyone absolutely loved this fish recipe.  A keeper.

My husband liked this more than I did, but that said, I thought it was a nice change.  I spread course ground mustard (lightly) and olive oil, & then I piled on the breadcrumbs.  I added fresh chopped garlic and garlic powder, oregano, and fresh ground black pepper.  I used frozen salmon, so cooking was longer, and I added wine to keep the whole thing moist.  I baked in the oven at 350.  I would make this again; I think I will defrost the salmon first, so that the garlic doesn’t burn.  I didn’t have the issues around soggy breadcrumbs, mine were very crisp and added a nice crunch.  Served with a salad, brown rice and sliced tomatoes, this was a nice meal.  We won’t be eating it weekly, but I will make it again.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  My salmon filets were thick so next time I will use a little more mustard.  I also added a little garlic salt and a little minced onion.

Neither my husband or I are big fans of salmon but I had some so I thought I would give this recipe a try. It was excellent!!! I will use this again and again. I only had plain breadcrumbs on hand, so I added a little Old Bay Seasoning. It was great. Thanks so much!!

I just made this for my husband, and he loves it.  I had some lemon dill dijon mustard, and used that.  (never knew what to do with it til now) and only had unseasoned breadcrumbs.  I am not a fish eater myself, but this was definately an easy easy recipe and one I will keep.

So simple, not overpowering, just great.  I used a brown German mustard since that's what I had in the fridge and it worked out terrificly - even without the pecans.  The flavor was excellent and I'll make it again.

This has a very strong mustard flavor when you first eat it.  When my boyfriend and I ate the leftovers the next day, the mustard had marinated the salmon resulting in a more mild, tastier flavor.  I'm not sure I would make it again.

This was great and so easy to prepare.  We are trying to eat more fish, and this seems like it might be a good recipe for kids (although I still can't convince my kids to try it!).  The only negative comment I had was that this did not store well, the topping got mushy, so I would suggest eating it right away.

I eat salmon at least 3 times per week and was excited to find such an easy recipe to change things up a bit.  However, I wasn't as pleased as I thought I would be based on other reviews.  It was good - don't get me wrong - but not 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe but I don't know if I'll use it again.

Very easy to make.  I added just a little crushed garlic as well.  My husband loved it but I think the salmon flavor was pretty masked.  All in all, it'll be a great way to get my family to eat more fish.

Very good recipe.  However, not great!  I'm very conservative with five stars, and actually have had better salmon.  But it was very good.

This was great!  I changed it up a bit by using rolled oats instead of bread crumbs and sprayed pam over them instead of melted butter!  Tasted great -- fast and easy too.

I typically think salmon is good enough to stand on it's own, but decided we needed a change.  This was so easy to prepare and was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy!!! Very good. I baked this tonight and my 6 yo son loves it. This  recipe brings out the flavor of the Salmon and does not in any way try to overcome it's natural taste.

I love salmon, and I've been looking for a different recipe than the one I usually make.  This one hit the spot!  I used salmon steaks instead of fillets, since that was what was on sale.  Superb, and took no time to prepare

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious and so easy! My husband couldn't quit raving about how good it was. I did as other reviewers suggested and cut down on the butter - using only about 1-1/2 TBSP. I also substituted crushed corn flakes for the bread crumbs. Overall rating should be 5+++.

We reallly didn't care for this recipe at all.  We both enjoy salmon on a regular basis and I was excited to find a new recipe with such rave reviews.  I was very surprised at the results.  My husband didn't even finish his which is why I gave it a 2.  For me I would have given it a 3 because I just thought it was "OK".  Not much flavor except for a little "fishy" taste.  This salmon is from a batch we have eaten from before so I know it wasn't bad fish!  Next time I will stick with our traditional lemon pepper type recipe.  Carol

Excellent recipe - so easy and yummy! Thanks so much, Christine!
The only thing I changed was butter  - salmon came out a little too greasy. Next time will use margarine, and cut the amount in half.

very very good and so incredibly easy to make! goodness! i ended up using what i had in teh fridge: mustard with honey in it. i figured it wouldn't kill the dish, and i was right! i give it four stars rather than five cuz i wihs it was more moist...maybe i didn't add enough butter? regardless, i will be making this again (can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!)

Five stars for being so quick, easy and tasteful to make! The breadcrumbs added a nice texture to the flavorful salmon. Nice to be able to come home from a long day at work and make this one for supper.

Great recipe!  Couldn't be easier.  I substituted crushed cornflake for the bread crumbs. Added some crunch.  Would probably lessen the butter next go around.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I have made this several times and I love how easy it is and the taste is wonderful!  My husband loves it and so does my two year-old, which says a lot!  We are not usually fish eaters, leaning more on the pizza and hamburger side, and this recipe helps us realize that eating healthy can be really tasty!

I expected the bread crumb topping to be crunchy, but it wasn't.  That's my only disappointment with this recipe.  I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars instead of just 4... it's delicious.

I thought I would really like this receipe because I love dijon mustard. However, both my husband and I ended up scrapping the mustard and bread crumbs off.  And I didn't even try to giving the toppings to my 2 and 4 years old.  I suggest trying it if it sounds good to you because maybe you will like it.  And the salmon was fine once we took off all the stuff.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  I skipped the butter and used a horseradish mustard which tasted great.  Next time I will use even more mustard.
