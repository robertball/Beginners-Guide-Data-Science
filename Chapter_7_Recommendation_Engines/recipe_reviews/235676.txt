This had a nice flavor and does have some possibilities, but as is for me needed some help. The addition of turkey/ chicken was the first thing. There wasn't enough in it to have this be considered a main dish but the addition of this if this was a side dish just didn't work for me. I understand the reasoning behind this though.. to give the dish some texture aside from the softness.  It does need something but I am not sure what. I did like the flavor of this dish, but it needed a little spice for me to contrast with the sweetness
