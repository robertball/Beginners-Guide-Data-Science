I made this for my wife this evening. It was absolutely delicious.  I am a guy that works from home, so i find pleasure in cooking for my wife when she gets home from work.  This recipe is top notch and i recomend it to anybody that is a curry fan.  I added 1 1/2 table spoons of curry as i love the spice so it was awsome

This was so good. I wish it was hotter. We added about 10 times the amount of curry seasoning rather than the amount the recipe called for. I will definently be making this again. One good thing is you can play with the spices to get the flavor you want. We put the leftovers in our salads for lunch the next day and had spicey ceaser salads. Mmmmmm... Thanks Oberpriller!

These chicken strips were so delicious and tender!  I am giving 4 stars because we didn't enjoy the yogurt sauce for dipping so much (so next time I'll cut that part in half, at least).  But the chicken was great!  I used whole-wheat flour because I was running out of white.  Also fried in canola oil.  I will be making these again!

This was really good and kids loved it too! I had no yoghurt so used mayonaisse instead and it worked fine - the chicken was really moist.

This chicken was alright...not great, but not terrible.  My husband and I also did not care for the dipping sauce, so it can definitely be cut down by 1/2!  I wasnt all that excited about the lemon flavour. Some additions I added were:  a LOT of extra curry powder, some black pepper and some paprika, but it still didn't have the kick that I was looking for. although husband said he enjoyed it...

I really like the flavor that the marinade gives this chicken, but I don't think the breading goes very well.  Next time, I might try to sautee or bake the chicken- it definitely deserves a second chance!

This dish turned out great!  I put the chicken over saffron rice and peas with the sauce drizzled.  My hubbie loved it!

Easy to make, the marinade/sauce was good, but I had trouble with the breading being too dry.  Will probably try this again, it has potential. Try 2, fried it, awesome.

I really love the dipping sauce! I serve this with saffron rice and even drizzle some of the sauce on my rice. I have made this meal several times and will several more :-)

I had a 32 oz container of yogurt that I needed to use before it went bad and a defrosted cornish game hen in the fridge. Your recipe sounded interesting so I whipped up the yogurt sauce and steeped the chicken overnight. It turned out so tender and moist! I devoured the thigh and normally I don't like that part of a chicken. Instead of frying, I baked it in a lightly oiled corningware dish (haha! corning and cornish - what a coincidence) and the last 5 minutes broiled it to get a nicely browned crust. It looked good and tasted good!

We really liked these chicken strips, although I did take the advice of other reviewers and reduced the lemon to 2 tbsp, and increased the curry powder to 3 tbsp. The dipping sauce was just okay, so I'll also be reducing that portion of the recipe next time, and switching out the butter for canola oil. Served it with rice pilaf, good meal!

Made as written to start with but after tasting the marinade/sauce I really felt it needed more curry and salt and so I added some prior to adding the raw chicken. This was pretty good and the curry is not overwhelming however I do feel mayo might be a better choice than yogurt. I'm not 100% certain of that since I made it with yogurt as the recipe called for but it's just a thought...
