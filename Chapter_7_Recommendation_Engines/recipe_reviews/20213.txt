This was great with just one cup of vodka. Also, I doubled the sugar water mixture and cooked it about five minutes more after it reached boiling stage. This made it more syrupy and just right for Amaretto.

I changed this recipe up just a bit to make it a little thicker and not as potent. I did everything the same, except instead of 2 cups of vodka I used 2/3 cup of absolute vodka. I slowly poured the sugar mixture into the vodka til it tasted just right.
Very good!

Very tasty!  I let the sugar-water mixture boil for 2 minutes to thicken it up a little bit more.  It was very easy to make, and although it still wasn't as thick as the "real stuff" nobody complained...they were too busy drinking!

Not quite as thick as store bought but with a good flavor.  Better for recipes than for sipping, maybe.

Tastes as good as "the expensive stuff". Added a drop or two of red food coloring to finish it off.

I make this recipe and pour into fancy bottles and give it with my Christmas gifts. A friend tells me that it tastes really really good after 6 months, but my share is always gone long before then.

This was very easy and makes a nice gift during the Holiday's. I went to dollar store and got some  abstract looking bottles for the presentation & every one loved It!

So simple, fast, and tasty!  I accidentally doubled the brown sugar, but I think the mistake wound up bringing the recipe to the "thickness" everyone else was looking for and gave it a the deeper amber color we're used to seeing with amaretto.  The hardest part was finding a place that sells bottles (I wound up finding a cool shaped bottle at The Container Store), but if I had planned ahead I might have gone to one of the many stores online.  Type  "empty glass bottles" into your search engine.

Tastes just like the real thing, but not as thick.  Also, you have to use dark brown sugar if you want it to look like store bought amaretto.

OH YEA!!!  This recipe is great!  I am an amaretto lover.  It is as good as the expensive one.  The only thing I changed is......instead of just letting the sugar mixture 'cool'  I CHILLED it.  You probably could just make the sugar mixture and refrigerate it overnight and then continue with the recipe.  Next time I will use a 'better grade' vodka but the cheap one was really good.  I saved an Amaretto bottle (750 ML) and this recipe made about 1 cup more.  @ more than 1/2 the price of the store stuff.  Hope you all ENJOY  .........  I AM!

Excellent recipe - delicious and easy. I made this (and homemade Kahlua) for holiday gift-giving and decanted it into pretty bottles. I also used some to flavor chocolate truffles. Highly recommended.

Very tasty.  I'm not a connoisseur of commercial Amaretto, so I can't comment on how close it comes to the original, but I'll use this with pleasure.  I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and used dark brown sugar and simmered the syrup for 5 minutes to thicken it.  For me, a cup and a half of vodka was just right.

Excellent!  I accidentally added 2 tbsp of coconut extract bcz I wasn't looking at the bottle, then added the vanilla extract too!  It turned out wonderful!  I will be doing these for Xmas.  I also did the boiling of sugar water to attempt to thicken up.  Turned out excellent.

No complexity, too sweet, thin, and artificially flavored. Besides, Drambuie is built on scotch whiskey, not vodka! And it uses honey not sugars. Scotch would bring a lot of its complexity along with it, paired with he right ingredients. But these are not them. If you're willing to spend money on expensive abstracts ans such, why not save up your pocket change and get the real thing!

Hi! Ifound this receipe to be very similar to the bought variety.   However I found that a lot of the oil from the extract tended to float to the top no matter how much I tried to blend it by shaking.   This detracted somewhat from the appearance.   I eventually poured it into a gravy separator and poured off the oil but there was stil a residual film on the top.  I have to say it didn't stop me drinking it!!!!

I used this as a basic recipe to make different flavor cordials. By using flavored vodka and using different extracts I made several yummy tasting drinks for my next party.I only gave 4 stars because I didn't make the actual recipe, I scaled it to make several varieties.

I made this with Finlandia vodka, since it's smooth and doesn't add a distinctive taste.  I had only light brown sugar, so I added a half teaspoon molasses.  It didn't have that little afterbite that the real thing has, so I added a teaspoon of brandy. That did it. I gave Hubby a sample of Disaronno side by side with this, and he couldn't tell which one was the real thing!  The only difference was that this is thinner.  I will try a reviewer's hint to use half corn syrup and half white sugar, or boiling for five minutes next time.  Love it!

To thicken, use 1/2 the amount of white sugar & subsitute the remainder of the sugar with Karo light syrup.  I do this for my Kahlua as well.  Thinkens it right up.
I also use brandy for my Kahlua instead of vodka - not so bitter. :-)

Smelled great and tasted good.  I gave these away in small corked bottles I found at a craft store.  I attached a recipe for Italian Margaritas and was sure to tell recipients to store upright and use within a month or two.  I'm glad I tried it.  Thanks.
