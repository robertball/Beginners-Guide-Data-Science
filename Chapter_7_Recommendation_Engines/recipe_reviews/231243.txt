The combination of the chocolate, banana and powdered sugar were great, but I tasted little to no peanut butter.  Overall, if you like the chocolate+banana combo, these are delicious!

This is amazingly nummy! I added a hard chocolate shell before rolling them in powdered sugar.

These tasted great but were incredibly rich. I substituted milk chocolate and I'm glad I didn't use semi-sweet. I definitely recommend a melon baller! This was my first attempt making truffles and I didn't think they would be hard to roll. Wrong! Save your hands from rolling little hammers and spare yourself looking at oddly shaped truffles. My husband inhaled them, but I'm definitely buying a melon baller in the near future.
