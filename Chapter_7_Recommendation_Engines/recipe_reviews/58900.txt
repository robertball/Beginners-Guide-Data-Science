This recipe was easy to make, and it tasted good.  The combination of garlic and raisins was interesting but worked nicely.  Okay, now I want to add to my original review.  I had the leftovers cold for lunch the next day.  I added a few pecans and some cold leftover orange roughy.  This was really good.  The flavor developed quite a bit overnight, and the raisins added a nice sweetness.  I'll make this again, but will chill it overnight and serve it cold.

I was looking for a quick asparagus dish that was different from the typical ones that I make. This fit the bill perfectly. It was beautiful to look at and thought the green and red colors would be fabulous for a Christmas buffet. I think this would also be terrific as a cold salad with toasted pecans or walnuts. Quick, elegant and tasty. Only use very fresh asparagus; if not, it will taste bitter.

The sauce is gourmet.  The mixture of wine and raisins is fantastic.  My guests requested I make it several more times!  Easy to make.

It was a good starting point, but it needed a lot of salt to bring it up to par.  The texture came out great, it just needed extra seasoning.  Do not use the recipe as-is because it needs the salt to go with the sweet.

I used extra garlic and also a bit of salt.  Had no raisins on hand but was pleased with the mixture of the butter/wine/garlic.

Thought this sounded weird - but I had leftover wine and wanted to use it. It was delicious! I used golden raisins, as that's what I had on hand - and it still worked.

The asparagus came out okay... I think it would have been better had I not cut them as indicated in the recipe. They also came out a little bit harder than I would've liked, but that could simply be because it was my first time ever attempting to cook asparagus. I'm a beginner...

Asparagus with a twist!  It was very easy to make and I didn't have to make any alterations.  I was pleasantly surprised by how the sweetness of the raisins contributed to the sauce.

It was good, but I didn't like the soy sauce/balsamic vinegar flavor combination as much I expected.  Everyone ate it right up though!

I love asparagus, so I don't think that I could have disliked this recipe.  It just wasn't as cohesive as I would have liked.  I'll probably just go back to steaming it instead of all the trouble of this recipe.

This recipe wasn't bad and people were intrigued with the combination of raisins and asparagus but I didn't think it had enough flavor.  I guess I was hoping for more taste out of the raisins and wine and garlic combination.  The asparagus did come out nice and tender though.

Made this recipe for Easter dinner.  So easy & quick, I will use all year long!  I didn't have rasins, so I omitted them, but the Asparagus was delicious.

I just made this for easter and it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a different twist on the average asparagus.

Great way for cooking asparagus. I usually just boil my asparagus then melt butter and a hint of lemon juice. This was a nice change of pace. The asparagus was a little undercooked but Im still going to give this 5 stars because it was my fault for not letting the wine fully evaporate and the flavour of this was spot on. Thanks again for the recipe. I do think I may just boil the asparagus first next time then just toss it around in the sauteed garlic butter with wine to flavour it up. Just to be on the safe side.

I started making this not realizing I was out of wine. Threw in some apple cider vinegar (slightly less than 1/4 Cup) and a splash of chipotle hot sauce instead. The result was better than expected, but the leftovers were overly strong the next day.

A great recipe for the garlic lover. This is one of the few easy and delicious recipes for vegetables I can find. All of th flavors go together wonderfully. This was the first dish to go at my family's Easter table.

Love it.  Used Madeira wine I had in fridge.  I think the key here is to turn off heat under pan while asparagus is still pretty firm.  I covered pan after removing and worked on other dishes.  Wine took away garlic flavor but with the raisin addition I didn't care.

The taste was different and I will use a different wine next time. The merlot was a bit strong for the asparagus and took away some of the garlic taste.

Great recipe. I added a little red wine vinegar to the wine, some salt to the asparagus, and at the end a little butter to melt down before serving.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  The key is not cooking the asparagus too long.  The butter and garlic I give it a great taste.

Very good! I used Craisens--what I had on hand. Good combination. The sauce did not thicken at all--was afraid to overlook asparagus!

This was a very suitable side dish that I made with Ravioli.  I added sunflower seeds with the raisins and wine and sprinkled a little Garlic salt while ingredients were simmering. Also, topped my serving with shredded parmesan cheese.

I didn't like this at all.  It was good until I added the wine.  Just didn't like the flavor at all even when I added more seasoning as stated by the other reviewers.

just made this to add into making a bigger pasta dish. I melted the butter added in the garlic and a but of small pieces of bacon once it smelled good I added the asparagus and once those cooked a bit i added I'm 1/2 c red wine then cooked till they were tender and the bottom of the pan had a nice brown Carmelized sauce (wich I used to cook my chicken in)

Perfect - I did not have any open red so I used white wine.
