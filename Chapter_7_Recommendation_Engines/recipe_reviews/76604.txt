I'm only giving this a 4 but I think it could be a 5 if the directions are changed slightly. I should have followed my gut feeling and reserved the separated fat to make a roux. If I would have done this there would not have been a floury taste. Do this by whisking the flour into the reserved fat over medium until golden, and then whisk back into the strained broth and drippings. I'll have to make my gravy tomorrow with my turkey drippings after all but maybe I can add this floury gravy to it. Hate to waste it but can't serve it the way it taste right now. Excellent concept with minor changes!!! Thank you!!!

If I could give this 500 STARS I WOULD 8 - )  I followed as directed almost exactly (scaled in half).  I used 2 turkey thighs, a back and roasted whole garlic cloves w/ turkey and added celery to pot- oh herbs de provence instead of thyme.  The only real change was as others said - I used some of the "fatty" stuff (the icky but good tasting stuff that floats to the top when it starts to cool) heated in a frying pan an added small abounts of flour at a time and a bit of chicken broth, then transfered to a jar with fitting lid with a more chicken broth and shook the heck out if it to make a thickening - then add that to pot.  I did this about 3 times and used the amount of flour the recipe called for and it was not floury tasting at all or lumpy.  This was suppose to be my back up gravy in case I had a holiday "melt down" or too much wine ha ha.  It was so good that's what I served with dinner! Just pop it in the microwave and pour in the ol' gravy boat! Thank you for saving me the burden of gravy after cooking all day!!  I've all ready given this recipe to all my freinds!!!!  Cheers!!!!

I was seriously skeptical of any gravy that could hold up for a couple of days and not turn into an icky paste, but this one was awesone and took such a load off of my mind.  Gravy at Thanksgiving is always such a stressful, last minute hit or miss and this one takes the worry away and delivers the great taste.  The only thing I changed was using turkey legs instead of wings because I think they impart a richer flavor.  Thank so much for this recipe!! A definite keeper!

This recipe is a life save on Thanksgiving day.  The gravy is DELICIOUS and it takes all the guesswork out of making gravy on the big day.  You can make it long ahead of time and heat it in a crock pot all day or stovetop.  No one will ever guess it isn't pan roasted that day.  Add some of the drippings to it before serving & you have the best turkey gravy!

Excellent recipe! One less stressful item to have to worry about on Thanksgiving! I made a few changes...  I poured the pan drippings into a gravy separator; The non-fat portion of the drippings went in with the simmering wings and broth, and I reserved the separated fat to make a roux. I did this by whisking the flour into the reserved fat over medium until golden, and then whisked in all the strained broth and drippings. No floury taste this way! Very excellent, and freezes well... To defrost, refrigerate for 2 days. Reheat in saucepan, whisking often. Yumm.

This is my 3rd year making this recipe and its great.  I don't stress making the gravy after the turkey is taken out of the oven, the problem is, there is never enough turkey gravy for left overs.  We all love hot turkey sandwiches the next day, so this solves that problem.  I prepare this "ahead gravy" 2 days before and on turkey day I boil the giblets while the turkey is in the oven.  When the turkey is cooked and resting I use the roasting pan with the drippings and make a roux, etc, when the gravy is done, I then add half of the make ahead gravy to the pan and heat it up.  We now have plenty of turkey gravy for Thanksgiving.  The other half of the Make Ahead gravy I freeze for the Christmas turkey dinner, so I get 2 for the work of 1, and never again worry about having enough gravy left over for the day after hot turkey sandwich smothered in gravy.  I don't know if anyone feels the way I do but after cooking all this food for a holiday dinner, I don't feel like eating it, so the day after the big dinner everything sounds and tastes great to me, since I am not touching, slicing, chopping, stirring, mixing or smelling the food all day long, not to mention being tired and stressed getting all the food cooked and served hot at the same time  for everyone to sit and eat.  Nope, the day after is MY DAY and I'm loving that hot turkey sandwich.

Yes, this gravy tasted pretty good.  However, I only gave it 3 stars because I just don't think the taste was worth all the extra effort.  It was nice to have the gravy done ahead of time, but next time I'll just spend the 5-10 minutes after the turkey is done making the gravy.

Lots of great elements here, but in New Orlean's we'd change a few thins. 1st, we always start with a roux instead of belnding in uncooked flour. Try for the color of peanut butter or darker, and if possible use rendered turkey fat as the oil. After the roux is ready, add minced onion, garlic and celery along with spices such as puoltry seasoning, sage, thyme, or savory. When veggies are wilted, add the stock, bring to a rolling boil and reduce until thick. After you cook the turker, add the pan juices and bring to desired consistency by reducing on stove or adding more stock to your taste. I use a stock, rather than a broth, using the turkey necks, old veggie and poultry trimmings I've saved in the freezer as well as any combination of carrots, turnips, rutabegas, or yams. I simmer it (one bubble every 2 or 3 seconds) at least overnight (I have electric--wouldn't do this on gas) and strain as directed in recipe. This yields a strong, dark, flavorful stock. Another option is to add the neck meat and chopped giblets if you like a giblet gravy. It's really not as much work as it seems, and the flavor intensification is incredible. Kudos aplenty for roasting your stock ingredients and "Bon chance" (good luck)! Laissez les bon temps roulle (Let the good times roll)!!!!!

I have used this recipe (but add celery and carrots) and it seems like extra work, but you can make it several days ahead of time and it is the most flavorful, wonderful gravy.  You don't have to rush around waiting to get pan drippings from your turkey so it really saves a lot of time at the last minute! You'll love it!

I just got done making this and had to rush to the computer to write this review, because it was AWESOME!!!  So delicious... I will most definately be making this every year!  I used 3 turkey legs instead of the wings, and before roasting them I drizzled them (and the onions) with a little oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  I also added two celery stalks and all the cloves from a bulb of garlic (peeled) to the simmering step.  After the final step of adding the butter and pepper, I sieved the gravy through a mesh sieve to achieve a silky, smooth gravy.  Perfection!  The final result yielded 5 cups of yummy gravy!  Can't wait to pour it over all my Thanksgiving goodies!  Thank you for this stellar recipe!

Delicious and so much less stressful to have it done ahead.  My mom, who has sworn by her recipe (also my grandmothers) forever, even took a copy because it was just as good and she wouldn't have so much to do on Thanksgiving Day.

Wow, finished this gravy today, and it is fantastic. I'm storing it in big jars in the fridge until Thursday. I did do a couple of things differently, though, and thought it might be helpful to share.

I had a large package of chicken thighs in the freezer that I had gotten on sale, and decided to substitute these for the turkey wings. They worked great. 

I used a good quality powdered chicken broth instead of canned broth. I also added 1 tablespoon of salt to the finished gravy...I thought it needed it. 

After roasting the chicken & onions, I used my large stockpot with a pasta insert for the next step. I put the chicken & onions and other veggies into the pasta insert, and of course, the broth went over top of it.  When it was time to take the chicken/veggies out, drain and press out the liquid, it was a snap having used this pot.

Also, since I used chicken thighs, there was plenty of useable meat. I boned the chicken and put all the meat an vegetables into a casserole for supper tonight, along with some noodles and a cup of the homemade gravy, mixed with 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Tastes great! AND I have fantastic gravy ready to heat up on Thursday. I'll be doing this one again!

This is a terrific recipe. I made it just as written and the flavor was exactly right. It reheated beautifully. The one thing I will note is that I cut the recipe down to serve 8 and it produced only about 1 cup of gravy. Next time, I'll simply make it all and freeze the rest.

I would change something for this recipe as well.  I use the neck from my bird (which I always brine) so the neck is 'accessed' 2 days before Thanksgiving.  Have to admit I use BIG bird so I generally have a large neck to work with.  I use the neck plus the onion and add carrot, celery and some garlic all drizzled with just a bit of olive oil and roast before putting it all in the stock pan.  There's really no need to add chicken broth because we want TURKEY flavor, right? If I want chicken gravy, this recipe would be fine.  Add 6-8 cups water to the pot and let it go for several hours seasoning along the way.  The broth should be rather dark in color (if the veggies & neck were roasted enough) and very rich in flavor.  Make gravy using this stock and you'll have a great TURKEY gravy rather than mostly chicken flavor gravy.  I've actually made this stock and frozen it for later use (like Christmas) when needed too.  I'd make the roux with skimmed fat as well as some have said.  Enjoy!

This gravy rocks!  I am a big time cook and I LOVE to make Thanks Giving dinner.  But, I also want to have fun and relax with my guests on the holiday.  Making this ahead of time is key for me to have both good gravy, and good fun.  Also, my taste tester was grinning ear to ear when I made it.  (It is SO super easy to make, but don't tell your guests that.)  I made it ahead of time and added my turkey drippings to it on Thanks Giving Day to get some more homemade flavor in there...doesn't need anything else though...it's heaven the way the recipe reads. (If you do add your turkey drippings to it: Put premade drippings in sause pan and warm on low heat, whisk often. Skim fat out of dippings and put the good stuff in a small sauce pan over low heat.  Slowly whisk in flour to thicken, go slow so you don't over thicken or make lumps.  Once you have the consistancy you want slowly whisk drippings into warmed premade gravy.  Simmer for about 4 or 5 minutes to allow flavors to combine whisking often.)   Don't cut this recipe in half because you need lots of gravy for leftovers.  Don't add too much flour - all the reviewers that say it was too thick clearly don't know how to use flour.  And finally, don't use yucky box gravy.  You can do this!  Its so easy and rewarding!

I’ve made this type of gravy in the past and it’s very good, I do add a teaspoon or so of poultry seasoning to up the flavor. BUT… when I plan to freeze it, I don’t thicken with flour mixture until ready to use the gravy. In the past I have frozen gravies thickened with flour, with disastrous results. When heating up the gravy it never comes together smoothly, no matter how long or well I whisk it; it always look somewhat curdled. Refrigeration doesn't seem to effect it but if you wish to thickened the gravy and then freeze, use Arrowroot powder mixed with chicken stock. Once added, cook briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Do not overcook or it will thin out again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature. Use less Arrowroot than flour; this recipe calls for 3/4 cup flour or 12 Tbsps.; web searches say 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Arrowroot per cup of liquid, others say only 1 Tbsp. guess it depends on desired thickness. Your gravy will be less cloudy than gravy thickened with flour; just looks a bit clearer. Gravies and sauces thickened with Arrowroot can be frozen and thawed with impunity and Arrowroot is the most neutral tasting starch thickener. The downside is Arrowroot is pricier, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based sauces, turns them slimy. Bottom line freeze stock and thicken with flour when ready to use, or use Arrowroot to thicken before freezing. Hope this helps those who had the same disastrous results I’ve had, thawing frozen gravy thickened with flour.

I have made this recipe for years.  I have a hard time finding turkey wings, so I always resort to turkey drumsticks or chicken wings.  When I use the drumsticks I coat them with a little vegetable oil before I put them in the roasing pan (they don't seem to have as much grease as wings do ).  I have also seen this recipe with a 1/2 cup  of white wine added to the mix in place of some of the broth.  I have made it both ways, if I have wine I use it, if not I don't.  Either way it's the best gravy I have ever had, and the fact that you can make it so far in advance of your dinner is an A Plus !!!  I throw the left over turkey meat ( when you use drumsticks it's a lot ) into the freezer and then take it out and throw it into my turkey soup that I make after the holidays. Nothing gets wasted that way, except the skin, which is a great reason to have a dog !!  She loves it !!!

This is simply the best gravy recipe I have ever tried! The taste actually surpasses the one in my my memory of all those thanksgiving meals growing up!  How many tastes can beat the nostalgic tastes in your childhood memory?
I like that it takes more time--the whole process puts me in the Holiday spirit.
As soon as the Halloween festivities are cleaned up, I make this ahead of time, stop before adding the flour and butter, and freeze the broth until the day before the feast.  
I go to the extra effort of doing up my own chicken broth for this recipe using fresh tarragon, thyme and rosemary.
I made this for the first time 2 years ago, agian last year and as I write this, the wings are roasting for this year's batch.  We will be having this every year and I bet my kids will make it, too!
By the way, it's great to make a chicken pot pie out of the leftover chicken (from the broth) and turkey from the wings plus some of the extra broth.  Sort of gets your tastebuds ready for Thanksgiving.

The only problem that I found with this gravy is that I didn't make enough of it!  I usually serve myself last and found that by the time I got to the gravy, it was nearly all gone.  Huge hit with the fam!  I will say that the instructions are a bit odd as far as the roux goes.  Just mixing the flour with the broth will not get rid of the flour taste; it needs to be cooked out, as with any roux.

After cooking down the roasted wings, etc. in the broth using a dutch oven, I pulled the wings out, strained the liquid into another pot, and returned the skin and any fat I could skim off of the surface of the broth to the dutch oven to melt the fat.  Once I had melted all of the fat I could, I removed the skin and then began to mix in my flour.  I did need to add a little butter as there wasn't quite enough fat for the amount of flour.  After the roux became browned, I slowly poured the strained liquid back in, peppered to taste, and cooked until it thickened.

I thought it was wonderful!  I just finished making it today, and on Thanksgiving my plan is to keep it warm in a small crock with a small ladle, let my guests slosh on gravy to their heart's content.  I only used 4 turkey wings because that's all my store had.  I added 2 ribs of celery, chopped.  Otherwise I made it exactly as stated, and it is delicious.  Best of all, next week when trying to get all the other dishes out and hot, the gravy will not be of concern.

Sub a little of the water for white wine. 
Add 1 head of garlic (peeled & cut horizontally in half), diced onions, diced celery & whole pepper corns when simmering on the stove up to 5 hours.
To eliminate floury taste, reserve separated fat & whisk into flour over medium heat until golden. Add roux to broth, bring to a boil & simmer until reduced to desired thickness. Makes 2 cups. I increase volume & enhance flavour by adding water or chicken broth to scrape roast pan bits & add to make-ahead gravy. This served leftovers for a 25 lb. turkey. Thanks Sue!

Just made this today to freeze for next weeks Thanksgiving dinner.  Like others, I couldn't find turkey wings so I used 3 turkey drumsticks and a package of chicken wings.  When I chilled this to skim off the fat it was more like a gelatin (did I do something wrong?).  Anyway, I went ahead and added some butter to what fat I could scrape off the top of the stock.  I cooked the flour before adding the additional broth.  It is pretty tasty, but I felt it needed a little something so I added a bit of poultry seasoning and a little more thyme along with salt and pepper.  I plan to freeze this and HOPE it comes out good on Thanksgiving day!  I will try to add some pan drippings from my turkey that day too.

I am not a gravy maker, especially attempting it at the last minute.  So, in the past I purchased gravy in a jar.  No more thanks to this recipe.  It was VERY good, had a nice flavor, and I will absolutely make this again.  Thank you for posting for us non-gravy makers!

SAVE THE SKIMMED FAT AND MAKE A ROUX!!!  You will not regret it.  I actually moaned when I tasted this gravy last year.  It is delicious.  I froze mine then warmed it in a crock pot on Turkey Day.  I got many, many compliments.  Thank you, SUE1956!  You made me look good! :)

I think that it was a lot of extra work but, it was worth it. Instead of flour I use a product called "Wondra". It is in a tall light blue round container in the flour section. It is really fine flour and is great for all types of sauces and does not lump.

I have NEVER had a more tasteful and delicious Thanksgiving turkey dinner because of this AMAZING gravy recipe!!!!  Added all my 'day of' drippings, and I am still in awe... everyone raved about it and the fact that I made it the day before was just brilliant! Thank you so much!

I just finished making this gravy.  Yummy and full of flavor. I only gave it four stars because I altered it a little so can't rate the actual recipe.  I used legs and thighs instead of wings.  I was lucky enough to find turkey stock and used that instead of chicken. I also took the advice of one of the other poster and combined the skimmed fat with the flour and cooked it with the two remaining cups of turkey stock. When finished, added a little morethyme, some ground sage and salted to taste.  It seems like a lot of work but it isn't really, just takes time more than anything. Having this done ahead of time will really take the stress off on turkey day.  My only concern is will it still be thick the day of serving?  I'll let you know. This is a keeper and I will make again assuming it doesn't turn to water when reheated.

This gravy is so tasty.  I always use turkey drumsticks instead of wings.  The meat turns into a nice little treat that we get to eat the day we make the gravy.

I NEVER make gravy, but, when I hosted my first Thanksgiving this year, packaged gravy just wouldn't do and anything I could get done in advance was even better! I made this two days ahead and it got awesome reviews! I subbed some of the water with white wine at my Mom's suggestion, but, otherwise kept it the same and I would highly recommend! Thanks for sharing!

This saved me so much time the day I made my turkey. I couldn't find turkey wings, so used 12 chicken wings instead of 6 turkey wings. You can always add the drippings from the roast turkey pan to this gravy, but it's great on its own. I like that it made lots of gravy, far more than I ever get from the usual pan drippings. Huge time saver.

Actually, I have to revise my first review. I could live with the lumps, but there were a ton of them (despite the fact that I added the flour gradually, which almost never works, I should know by now), and the gravy tasted like flour and nothing else. Had to throw this out.

I made this yesterday, and finished it today ... a bit of work, but well worth the end result! It tastes delicious, and my gravy is all done for the big day! The only thing I did differently, was after straining the broth, I refrigerated it overnight, making removal of the fat simpler. Definitely 5 stars, and I will make this again. Thanks for this time saving recipe! ♥

Absolutely out of this world gravy!  I couldn't stop eating it after I made it :)  It really saves a lot of stress from the big turkey day.  To avoid any lumps in your gravy, completely dissolve the flour into the soup mixture before you start adding it into your turkey stock.  Also you can use a fine mesh strainer at the end of the process to get a completely smooth finish.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, it's an excellent recipe!

I made 32 servings and it is perfect.  We deep fry our turkey; hence, no gravy.  This is a fantastic recipe.

This is the best gravy I've had! I did modify slightly based on other comments. First change is I bought a package of wings containing 2 large wings, which was plenty and more cost effective. Second, I strained the water and broth as the recipe indicated, but I set it aside. In a heavy bottom large pot, I melted 8 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of flour (equal parts flour and butter) and let that toast for about 1 minute to remove any flour taste. I wisked that into the wonderfully reduced wing liquid. It was rich, smooth and delicious. Thank you to the recipe author for sharing this!

Been making this gravy for years now. Started making 'make ahead' dishes for my Thanksgiving meal back when I had to work on the holiday (nurse). That way when I came home we were ready to eat! This gravy is exceptional! My family loves it. You get so much creamy smooth, flavorful, beautifully colored gravy. I follow the recipe exactly as written. I honestly can't say enough about how much I love this gravy! Now that I'm retired I still 'make ahead' this gravy, my mashed potatoes, my cranberries, sweet potatoes, and corn casserole! That way when my family comes I can enjoy them because I'm not running around in the kitchen!

What a disappointment.  The only thing I did different was to use turkey legs - I could not find wings.  The gravy tastes like flour.  Don't waste your time.

This is SOOO good!  I did not have wings, so I used 3 drumsticks and about 1.5lbs of chicken hearts/gizzards.  It didn't give me as much gravy as I was hoping for, but this was so good, I will make more.  I also added a few TBLSP of fresh parsley.  I think it gives the gravy a nicer look. I also made a roux and did it that way.  this was my first real attempt at a gravy, and it turned out wonderful.  This is definately going to be my go to recipe.    To make a roux: use some fat (I didn't have much, so I used the 2 TBSP of butter in the pan as well) and warm it up.  Then continue adding a little bit of a flour at a time, until all 3/4 cup of flour is gone.  I also had to add some broth the more flour I added.  The roux is a thick consistancy and then I added it slowly in to my other pan over medium heat and stirred very frequently for about 5 minutes.  

Update:  I had frozen the gravy in a ziplock container.  I put it in the fridge the night before Thanksgiving.  In the morning after I got my turkey in the oven I took the gravy out and put it in the crock pot.  Put it on low for a few hours, then an hour and 1/2 before dinner was served I put it on high, and just asked anyone who walked by the crockpot to stir it.  It came out PERFECT.  It was creamy, not thin, and there weren't any lumps.  It made the final part of Thanksgiving much less stressful.  I actually remembered the rolls early on and didn't burn them because I wasn't fussing over the gravy.

This is amazing! I will never make turkey gravy any other way. It takes extra planning and time a few days ahead, but was so worth it not to be making gravy at the last second. I used 3 large turkey legs because thats what the store had. I seasoned them a little before roasting, and drizzled with olive oil. I added celery to the pot when boiling as well. I followed other reviews, and took the broth after cooking, allowed to set up in the fridge, and then removed the fat from the top. I used the fat as well as a little butter to create a roux with the flour and then slowly added the broth to it. I was afraid it wouldn't reheat well 2 days later, but it was perfect! My husband suggested next time I add the meat from the turkey legs to the gravy as well. Thanks!

...and I thought that I made really good turkey gravy...  This is wonderful, but very rich!  I made it a little less rich by adding some more chicken broth and tightened it back up.  When I use a thickener without a roux, I simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  I initially made this because my hubby is deep frying a turkey this year and I wanted gravy, but I think I will always make my gravy this way now.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this yesterday for Christmas dinner.  It makes the most delicious, smooth turkey gravy! (I used Wondra flour as that dissolves easily and makes very smooth sauces/gravies.  Many people complained of a floury taste.  Do EXACTLY as the recipe says and boil for several minutes (I boiled for 5 minutes) and the floury taste disappears.  It's in my freezer now all ready for Christmas dinner and I'm happy to have that out of the way.

This was one of the best gravys I have ever tasted.  My family loved it.  Instead of the wings I used Jeanio breakfast links (turkey).  I also tried making 1/2 of this recipe and it served 5 people nicely.  It was so nice not to have to make the gravy at the last minute.  Highly recommened.

I followed the recipe with a few tweeks, based on a comments by others.  I created a rue with the turkey drippings and flour before incorporating this into the broth.  The gravy looked good but tasted like flour.  No flavor.  My suggestions to others would be to season the turkey before baking it.  Also, adding a packet of dry turkey gravy mix to the broth might help.  This was too much work for the resluts.  Will not try it again.

I just found this recipe TODAY and I made it...ITS THE BEST GRAVY I'VE EVER MADE IN MY LIFE!!!  Takes a little time, but is so worth it!  I had to use poultry seasoning instead of the thyme.  One less thing to do on Thanksgiving!  Thank you!

Couldn't buy turkey wings so used the wings off turkey I had and bought a package of 7 chicken wings - worked great.

If I could give this recipe ten stars I would! This was hands down the best gravy I have ever tasted. This was my first attempt at making gravy and it was a homerun! I followed the recipe to a t, except I used Wondra flour instead of regular flour. Wondra flour makes gravies and sauces really smooth. My boyfriends mother tasted it as it was reheated and proclaimed it divine, then demanded the recipe. I made this two days in advance of Thanksgiving and just kept it in the fridge. It reheated beautifully. This will be my Thanksgiving recipe for the rest of my life!

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would! So easy and the end product was simply awesome!

I did leave out the carrots because I think they tend to make recipes too sweet.

Thank You SUE1956, for this fabulous gravy recipe.

One more thing that doesn't have to be made on Thanksgiving day...hooray!  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out.  There were some reviewers who said this tasted like chicken gravy, so I opted to use turkey broth (available in those quart boxes).  I'm doing a recipe this year that calls for boneless turkey breasts, so when the butcher boned the breasts, he gave me the turkey bones.  I cooked the bones with the broth, which I believe enhanced  the turkey flavor.  I also made a roux before adding the broth, so that eliminated any flour flavor you would have by just adding flour to the broth.  And the side benefit--I now have enough meat picked from the wings for a nice pre-Thanksgiving casserole tomorrow night!  Winner in my book and going into my Favorites folder.  Thanks Sue for this great recipe.

Just finished making this right now.  Delicious.  Tastes just as good as anything I've made in the past with NO STRESS.  I did add about 1 tsp of garlic, and a few shakes of garlic salt.  Kept the fat too.  Absolutely divine and a huge relief for the big day.  Try this -- you'll be glad you did!

The turkey wings were difficult to find, so next time I'll use 3 turkey legs. I added a gravy ladle of turkey drippings when I reheatied it. Yum.

I have always hated making gravy, but I thought I would try this so if it didn't work out I would have enough time before Thanksgiving to do something else..
This gravy turned out great and the only change I made was to use turkey thighs instead of wings.  I also cooled the stock overnight and skimmed off the fat which I used for the "roux"..
This was relatively easy and definately worth it!!!

Extra work, but having the gravy done ahead of time is worth it! I am cooking Thanksgiving dinner for 40 people. With plenty to keep me busy on Thanksgiving Day, having the Gravy reay ahead of time and staying warm in a crock pot is greatly appreciated. And not only that, it's delicious! A smooth and flavorful turkey gravy.

Soooo yummy and easy to make.  I couldn't find turkey wings at my local Super Walmart, but they did have 3 large turkey drumsticks ($3) which I substituted.  The great thing is that you can use the drumsticks to eat for a lunch or something.  The only thing is that my onions burned on the baking sheet, but that was not a big deal-I just discarded them after the baking.

I thought this was more work for a gravy that wasn't any better than the traditional recipe I have always followed.  The reason for the high rating was I loved being able to have one more chore done before the big day arrived.  Update: I read reviews and made again making a roue with the flour and butter and this was fabulous, the best turkey gravy I have ever had or made myself, for sure.  Thanks friends,  all these tips are soooo helpful.  It is a definite 5 now.

This recipe made Thanksgiving a little bit easier.  I took the gravy out of the freezer in the morning and placed it in the crockpot.  It was perfect by dinner time and I just added a few choice drippings from the roasting whole turkey so not to waste them.  Tasty and easy.

Here I am a week before Thanksgiving and I am making the gravy!   It is not so much that making gravy is time consuming or difficult, but there are so many dishes that are a part of our Thanksgiving dinner that need to be put together at the last moment that having this done in advance brings down the stress level.  More importantly, this is good!  I use turkey legs rather than wings simply because they are more readily available  in my area.  Today, I'll roast the legs and create the stock.  The rich, slowly simmered stock is what I think makes this gravy so good.  Tonight I'll put the stock in the fridge.  Tomorrow, I'll have a top layer of fat to skim off and create a roux.  Once the roux is well browned, I'll add the strained stock to make the gravy.  The completed gravy will go into a Ziploc freezer bag to be stored in the freezer until Thanksgiving day.  On Thanksgiving it will simmer in backburner pan, one less thing to worry about.   =D  This year there will only be 10 of us but I expect the recipe will get the same rave reviews that last year's larger group gave it.

Excellent!! Love this idea and the gravy really was very smooth and delicious. I also add a clove or two of garlic while roasting the legs (in place of wings). And  I always use corn starch in place of flour in thickening my gravy. The color stays more vibrant and the flavor is more velvety. (I think flour makes gravy taste a bit pasty and it's murky looking.) Try the corn starch and see what you think. A chef gave me this tip years ago and it makes a pretty big difference (for the better!).

If you're like me, you're looking at this recipe so you don't have to stress in front of your company about the coveted gravy for Thanksgiving! I made this the Tuesday before and refrigerated. Pretty easy except for the hardest part (at least for me) the dreaded thickening. I tried the flour, it lumped. Then I remembered a trick from my mom, corn starch mixed with cold water then added a bit at a time into the boiling mixture and stir, stir, stir. It worked. I don't think it made enough for 32 servings, hence 4*. And to think I was considering buying the gravy from a restaurant!

Have used this recipe for years.  Life saver with one less last minute chore..and it is delicious!  The meat makes great turkey tacos!
I added 3 celery stalks to the broth along with the carrots.

Been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it. I roast the carrots with the turkey to give it a deeper flavor and use gluten free flour so family who have this intolerance can share in the gravy.

Good Heavens! This gravy is exceptional. DH is a turkey hunter. The wild birds have zero fat and therefore no gravy. I decided to give this a try and the results were fantastic. This smooth, flavorful gravy made the house smell divine. True turkey taste and easy to make. After straining the contents of the stock pot in step 3 I let the liquid cool and froze it. When DH got his bird I pulled it from the freezer, thawed and then continued with step 4. Perfect!

Gravy was good but not exceptional in light of all the work is was to prepare ahead of time.  I prefer cornstarch base to the flour, this seemed a bit heavy to me.  I think I spent more effort making gravy than baking the turkey.  Next time I will go back to my pan-drippings and make the usual gravy.

This is hands down the best gravy I have ever tasted.  It was so nice being able to prepare it the day before and not having that last minute stress on Thanksgiving day.  This year we fried two turkeys in the deep fryer outside so this is a great recipe to go with that since you don't end up with any nice drippings from roasting a turkey in the oven.  DEFINITELY will make this every year!!

I have made this gravy for the past three Thanksgivings.  It is DELICIOUS!  I find that using chicken wings and a couple of chicken thighs gives it the best flavor.  I make it thick enough so I can thin it with some of the pan drippings from the turkey (I use wine & butter to baste my turkey).  I will never leave gravy until the last minute again!!  I love this recipe!

Gravy turned out well, but it took hours to finish. Not at all certain it is worth the effort.

Great as written, which is how I did it the first time. Now I us turkey tails instead of wings (more fat=more flavor). I wait until the day I want to use the gravy and skim off the fat, use that to make a roux which I cook long enough to get rid of the raw taste. Then I use the drippings from the turkey aong with the made-ahead broth. My aunt says the gravy is why she looks forward to Thaksgiving dinner!

Great Gravy!  I cooked this the Saturday before Thanksgiving and froze it until Weds.  I followed recipe as directed, but used 2 very large turkey wings, it came out perfect.  When unfreezing I put in the crock pot on low for a few hours.  It will appear lumpy, but a quick wisk will fix that immediately.  Taste was just like out of a jar/packet, but better.  Nothing fancy-very simple, just great gravy and it got rave reviews.  Worth the time if you're poking around the house.

Had to use other turkey parts in additioin to wings. Worked fine. Cooking time listed is a little off, It takes way more than 2.5 hours, but is worth it to have done ahead of time. I deglazed the pan with chardonay instead of water and seasoned the turkey parts with poultry seasoning before roasting. Also added two stalks cut up celery for the simmering part of the process.

I have to agree with another review. The gravy is quite good, however the added time and expense preparing this was not worth the effort.  Even for gravy-phobics, making good gravy is not a science....Too-Knorr makes a pretty good mix if all else fails!  I'll go back to my standard "last minute gravy" for the next go-around!

Simply to avoid the last minute stress this recipe is worth it. Really its the same thing but on a smaller controlled scale. Make a rioux then add it to the broth, bring to a boil and simmer. Also, I added 1 packet of McCormick's to enhance the flavor.

There is never enough turkey gravy for hot turkey sandwiches on the day after Thanksgiving.  This recipe solves that dilema.  PERFECT!  Definitely 5 stars!!!
We will make this gravy every time we roast a turkey.
Thank you for sharing.

This was perfect!  I made it ahead and froze it for Thanksgiving.  On the day, I had forgotten to leave it out ahead of time to defrost, so I heated it slowly over a very low heat.  Thought it would get lumpy and I would have to whisk or strain it, but it turned out perfectly and was delicious!

Such a relief to get the gravy done ahead of time and everyone really liked it.  Not too greasy like sometimes happens when made with drippings.  I used wondra instead of flour and added a little kitchen bouquet to darken the color.

I made this recipe last year for the first time.  I always got so frustrated being in the kitchen making gravy while everyone else was having fun! It is EXCELLENT.  The only thing I changed was that I used 2 turkey wings instead of 6.  I left the rest of the recipe as is.  I also shredded the turkey meat and put it in the gravy at the end. It is outstanding! Last year I used what was leftover and put it into turkey soup.  It was the best turkey soup I have ever made.  Excellent recipie!!!

I just made the make ahead turkey gravy from this site and although it was a 3 hour process to roast and simmer, it was TOTALLY worth it!  So for those of you who are hosting and hate the last minute prep rush before serving on Thanksgiving day - go buy turkey legs and make this tomorrow!!!! It turns out really well. Mmmmm gravy....

The gravy was very good, but a lot of advance time and effort.  I don't think the 10 minute time saving on turkey day was worth it.

The best gravy I have ever had. I don't normally like gravy but this was incredible. I followed recipe as written and put gravy in a small crock pot on Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about the gravy more than any other part of the meal. Thank you!

I LOVE it!.....I bought a 3 lb package of turkey wings not knowing there were only 2 wings in there, so bought 4 smoked turkey necks (on sale) and used those also. I just threw all the turkey pieces on a large baking sheet, along with the onions and carrots and then also threw on 2 chopped stalks of celery. Drizzled with olive oil and baked at 400 for 75 minutes. Put everything into a 12 qt stock pot, drained most of the oil off the baking sheet to make a roux later, added the water to the baking sheet to get all the browned bits off and added that to the stock pot. Added the thyme, poultry seasoning and pepper and then covered everything with water.....a lot more than 6 cups. I brought to a boil, then lowered to a simmer (Low) overnight. Then I skimmed the fat from the stock pot.....as much as I could get; put on med high heat and added flour and mixed to make a roux....when it was a medium brown, I added some turkey stock back into the roux, mixed and then added to the turkey stock that had been strained through a colander. Then added butter at the end w/ more pepper and salt, as well as the turkey wing meat. I plan on also adding the turkey drippings to this gravy on Thanksgiving- SO HAPPY it doesn't need to be made last minute!! It smells wonderful and am positive it will be delicious!! YEP- delicious!!
2nd year making it review:  I made turkey stock from last years turkey carcass and pressure canned it last November and just opened 3 quarts of turkey stock and am making

This made a good gravy.  I was looking for a recipe to make ahead for Thanksgiving day.  It was time consuming but worth it as I will have the gravy made ahead of time.  There was a flour taste to the gravy, but I will mix in some fresh drippings on Thanksgiving day from the juices of the bird.

This gravy is good, but not good enough. I made it  for Thanksgiving using turkey wings and it came out good. The second time I made it, I used turkey drums, which came out OK. The two times I made it, it had different taste. I also didn't find that it had a lot of flavor. I give it two stars because It was still good to eat, but there was no consistency. I don't think I'll make this again because it might turn out different again.

Very Salty and I did not get 8 cups. I think If I try this again I would use low sodium chicken broth and use less broth and more water.I added a potato to remove some of the salt, it helped a bit. I froze this and I am planning on adding a jar of Heinz gravy to improve it.

Excellent recipe and yummy gravy! It was so nice to have this done ahead of time and it makes lots. I couldn't get turkey wings so I used a turkey "hind quarter" piece (leg/thigh/etc) and I forgot to put the onions in the oven with it so those were added to the broth step. It was great and so smooth!

It was perfect make ahead, took a ton of stress off of the day.  I did make a roux using the butter and fat from the turkey and the flour.  I added to it from the drippings from the day and it was perfect, it was perfect way to make sure I had enough gravy

Time consuming, but easy to make and well worth it!  I did do a few different things, I seasoned the turkey wings before roasting and roasted carrots and celery along with the onions.  I also substituted chardonnay for the water.  The aroma in my kitchen was just delicious.

I am trying this now. After cooking the turkey parts with the onions (and a tossed a little Herb de Provence on top), I added everything to the crock pot to cook slowly for 4 hrs. Smells great. It seems very easy.

Sue, thank you so much for this recipe.  I've just finished making my gravey and it turned out wonderful.  This is the 2nd year in a row, and this time I decided to double it.  I figured since I was going through the steps, I might as well, now I have plenty for tomorrow, and some to freeze for Christmas.

This kicks heinie! For those of you that think it's too time consuming, it takes a few minutes more than making a good brown poulty stock & is well worth it. I'm sure you could make chicken gravy this way too & you'd always have it on hand when you need it. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! Love it! :o)

I did make this a couple of days in advance and was glad on Thanksgiving morning. It did cut down on the worry as I am not a wonderful gravy maker. But I was very happy with this and the amount that it made and I will use this as my go to recipe. Thanks.

This was a lot of work for a rather bland gravy. I even added onions and celery to the stock for the simmering step. It's not bad, just not that great. Thanks anyway.

I tried this method, didn't have turkey wings, used chicken thighs.  The roasting with veggies made a tremendous difference.  The aroma of the gravy was great.  The flavor was so much richer.  I will use this idea for gravy (Holiday meals) in the future.  It's worth the extra effort.  Thanks for the great tip.

This was great!  My family loves gravy and there never seemed to be enough.  With this the only thing I did different was to make the gravy ahead of time thicker and on Thanksgiving when the bird was done add the drippings to the allready made gravy, so I had plenty of gravy to go around!

WONDERFUL!  This gravy is going to be in my recipe book for years to come.  Just made it last night so it would be ready for Turkey Day today...and my mother and I cant stop dunking in it or just eating spoonfuls!  WE LOVE IT.   Local supermarket didn't have  enough wings so I got 2 thighs to supplement.  wish I could give this more than 5 stars....ITS THAT GOOD!  Thank  you!!

Just finished making the gravy and it is fabulous. I have refrigerated it and will heat it up in the crock pot tomorrow. Can't wait to hear all the compliments. I did use some of the bones from deboning the turkey. I saved all the giblets, carrots and onions for turkey soup. This far better than rushing around just before sitting down to dinner.

The taste is very good.  I did make the roux as many others suggested. I also put pieces of the turkey in the gravy for "authenticity".  This is a fabulous solution for the "big holiday".  However, it is very time consuming. I did not stray from the ingredients listed.  I did have to use 6 turkey legs as that's what was available at the store. This gravy takes just as long as cooking a whole Turkey on Thanksgiving.  But I will say, it takes alot of stress out of an already stressful situation.

This turkey gravy is probably too much work for a smaller get together, but when I had 20 people for turkey dinner this gravy was essential! I changed it a little. I used 3 turkey legs, did them in the oven, let them stew a while with the veggies in the crock pot with the majority of the chicken broth. There wasn't a lot of fat on the top when I took the solids out, so I just spooned about half or more of the liquid (including fat) into a pan on the stove and did the flour bit like regular gravy. Then I put this mix in with the rest of the broth, stirred and voila. All in all I ended up with a ton of perfect gravy that heated up the next day just fine. It was pretty hard to mess up, which I can't say about day-of gravy.

This recipe is a life-saver!  Last Thanksgiving I fried our turkey, which freed up my oven for other dishes....but still needed gravy for our stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc.  This gravy was as delicious as any I've ever made, and eliminated the last-minute making the gravy step.  Since I didn't have a turkey taking up space in the oven, I was able to make more side dishes. Our best Thanksgiving ever....thanks so much for this recipe!!!

This gravy is exactly how my grandma used to make it! It's easy to make and very forgiving when being altered. Instead of the turkey legs we made it together with the actual Thanksgiving Turkey and mashed all the veggie ingredients after finishing baking. It turned out so thick that we left out the flower and only added little bit of heavy cream and chicken broth. Delicious! The gravy was the best part of the entire Thanksgiving dinner!!

As the turkey was cooking this Thanksgiving, I decided to make this gravy so I didn't have to do it after the turkey was done.  This made it so much easier.  I added a celery stalk (including leaves) and two diced carrots.  I used 6 turkey wings and accidentally put all 4 cans of broth in at the beginning.  I also added 1/4 cup Burgundy wine because that's what I had on hand - next time I'll up it to 1/2 cups.  When the pot was done with the simmering, I added another can PLUS I added the separated drippings from the turkey when it came out of the oven.  The consistency was perfect.  I still didn't have enough gravy, it was so good.  I had 15 adults over for dinner - they all liked the gravy but my sisters said "MORE GRAVY" ... so next time, I'm adding more broth.  There was plenty of flavor to support more broth, no problem.  Great recipe - thanks!!!

Gah! I am actually in the process of making this gravy and I need some advice. So far, the roasting, boiling, straining and skimming of the fat went great. But then I had to stop and freeze the leftover "broth" portion. When i tried to take the advice of another reviewer and used the skimmed fat to whisk with some flour, it got all lumpy and I had to toss it. I supposed I should mix the flour with water first? I cna make another roux with the skimmed fat form the drippings from the turkey on thanksgiving, but any pointers would be appreciated as to how to mix in the flour so it doesn't get lumpy. 
**Edit, post thxgiving*
WONDERFUL! Even tho I mixed a little bit too much cornstarch into the gravy (it looked like a bread pudding the next day but melts back to its wonderful self easily in the microwave) I add cornstarch by boiling water, then adding spoonfuls of cornstarch little by little and mixing it to a sticky, but still liquid, consistency with a fork and slowly pouring it and mixing it into the gravy well. the consistency of the gravy in the pan (i added the broth to the turkey drippings and a half cup of boiling water) is deceptive compared to the consistency it gets when it cools for about five or ten minutes, so it's an experience thing. Thanks for the awesome recipe! My first thanksgiving dinner went off without a hitch!

Everyone in my family loved this. My husband who always cooks our Thanksgiving turkey on the grill has now told me I can cook it this way instead. That is quite a compliment from him as he prides himself on his turkey as we have a large party (around 50 people) at Thanksgiving. I also made gravy with the broth by adding 1/2 cup of flour. My daughter (age 17) also gave this two thumbs up, she has recently graduated from just eating mozzarella sticks, so again quite a compliment.

This takes a long time to make.  I was almost hoping it would be a flop because of the time factor.  But, it turned out great and will be the gravy recipe I use from now on.  A nice, basic gravy.

I LOVE this recipe! I made this gravy two days before Thanksgiving and it was excellent. I am going to cook my turkey carcass with the same method and make another batch to freeze for my New Year's Day meal.Great recipe.

Worked great - I had chicken wings and legs on hand so that is what I used. I also used home made stock instead of canned and what a taste difference it made!  I will use this recipe again and again.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and will freeze it 'til then. It's so reassuring to know that I'll have plenty of gravy for my 18 guests, as well as knowing that it's done other than adding to it on Thanksgiving day. I could not find turkey wings, so used 6 turkey drumsticks instead.It worked out fine, and is probably less fatty! Also, I only used 1 1/2 cups broth with the flour for thickening. The flavor is quite good! Once I add drippings from the turkey, I'm sure it will be 5 stars!

The recipe is quite a bit of extra work, but it was nice not having to worry about the gravy on Thanksgiving.  So if you have the time, I would recommend making it before hand. 

I couldn't find turkey wings, so I used two turkey thighs and three legs. I decided to do as some other reviewers had suggested and separate the fat and make a roux before adding the broth. I didn't feel like there was enough fat, so I added some bacon grease. I thought the final product was good but not great, although my guests really seemed to like it.

This is the 3rd or 4th time I made this recipe and it has been great. BUT this year I couldn't find turkey wings so I used turkey necks. Wow, the difference was very noticeable. Much more flavor. I chopped the necks into 2 or 3 pieces to really get the flavor out. I will be using necks from now on.

Just made this for the 4th time. It is exceptional, everyone has raved about it. I did however, make the mistake of slicing the onions and they were burnt when I took the pan out of the oven. Make sure to quarter them.

I made this gravy two days before Thanksgiving. It was the easiest gravy I have EVER made, and it tasted great!  I have some in my family who are gluten free, so next time I will try it with a tapioca starch to see how it works

Meh. Disappointing. Definitely missing something in the flavor department and also looked more like a dark beef gravy than a nice giblet gravy, due to using the roasted wings. It would have probably been improved by the addition of some aromatics - I would recommend fresh sage and rosemary. Next time I still with my standby recipe to make gravy on the day of using the neck and giblets, and a base of turkey fat and flour to thicken it when the turkey is done.

Way to much work for a gravy that can be made by using roasted giblets and wing tips from your turkey.

Also turkey backs are cheaper than wings and provide much more flavor.

I kind of mashed together this recipe with Chef John's and got a great result! Put celery, carrots and onion in the pan withe the wings. Used the chicken broth in this recipe, pureed some of the veg and added it to gravy, (after pressing) and made a roux.  Turned out great, and will add pan drippings on T-day. One less thing to worry about!

Absolutely my new go to turkey gravy recipe! Was a bit sweet but turned out fabulous people were actually eating this without the potatoes they said it was the best turkey gravy they ever ate. Next time I will only use two carrots so it won't be so sweet.

Excellent gravy and great way to free up more time on turkey day! I added four ribs of celery in addition to the onions, left out the carrots--salt & pepper to taste--Perfection!  This will be my go to gravy from now on--wish I discovered this years ago!!! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

This gravy is delicious and a great way to prepare for Thanksgiving - less stressful when the turkey comes out.  My market only had 2 packages of wings which was 4 large wings so I purchased 3 small drumsticks and used those also.  Second time this gravy was made I added 6 peppercorns, 4 cloves of chopped garlic and about 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning to stockpot in addition.  I also used 10 cups of broth altogether.  After straining the broth and removing the meat I put it in the refrigerator for 2 days then remove the fat and keep it for the roux, which I use very little of the fat.  Depending on the date I will freeze the stock until the day before Thanksgiving to make the gravy.  If the stock is done on Sunday before Thanksgiving I remove the fat after 2 days and keep it in the refrigerator until the day before.  The tastiest gravy I've ever made!

The gravy is very good and makes for an easier Thanksgiving dinner prep with gravy made in advance. I made 2 alterations: (1) after straining, I added some nice sherry and cooked down a bit, and (2) I used pan drippings and a bit of olive oil with flour to make a roux, then added the cooked and browned flour to the stock.  Very nice.

Definitely make the flour into a roux if you have enough rendered turkey fat, or with butter if you don't.  I added celery to the boil, and used turkey legs instead of wings but did everything else the same.  Delicious!

I made this today to freeze before Thanksgiving. I halved the recipe and it admittedly takes several hours, but I have plenty of time to recover before Thanksgiving. I added some  celery, fresh sage, and white wine to the broth. I mixed the roux as suggested. Absolutely delicious! Next year I will make the full amount and use it for all sorts of other dinners.

I butterfly my bird the day before and take all bones (except legs and wings) and bake them with aromatics - I save fat from pan (to use with the butter and flour) and dump the rest into pressure cooker with water and cook on high for about 35 minutes.  I also like to add red wine for a little more flavour and sometimes mushrooms.  Having the gravy completed ahead of time is an absolute charm!

I have been doing this for years and it always comes out PERFECT!!! I now use a few thighs. I also add carrots and celery, parsley in the stock pot and drain all that before adding the flour. I also add some poultry season.

My first Thanksgiving dinner for the family.  Every one liked this gravy very much... Will keep for long time use.  To me it is not complicated to make at all...  
My persona suggestion, if you have 6 people or less for dinner.  May only need half of the ingredients are enough.  If you like me don't like left overs.

This is the best gravy.  I saved the fat from the top and used cornstarch instead of flour at the end.  This is going to save so much time and reduce the stress of making gravy after the turkey is done.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

As someone else suggested I added carrots & mushrooms with a few cloves of garlic when roasting the wings & legs.  I added the meat & veggies to my dressing & it was wonderful.  Thanks for the great idea!

I would make again with a few changes.  Would add celery and garlic for more flavor.  This gravy is better than store bought and much better then trying to make gravy at the last minute (and mine is usually a failure or not as good as this recipe).  I followed the recipe and it made over 4 cups.  The flavor is bland, but when I reheat it on Thanksgiving I will add celery salt, a bit of garlic powder and some pan drippings.

This gravy was absolutely amazing! This was my first Thanksgiving cooking dinner for my fiance's family so I was a bit nervous to wait until the last 5 minutes to make gravy. At least this way I could taste it and make sure it would be a hit, and it was. I was a bit concerned when I went to heat it up and it looked like a big blob of nasty, but it thinned out to perfection after a few minutes. I would recommend like other reviewers to stick with the portion of the recipe as-is, I think the servings are very small as listed. I was feeding 5 people, made the recipe for 10 servings, and ended up with about a cup of gravy. Ended up having to go back and make another batch, but even after that hassle I know I will be going back to this recipe in the future!

Exceptional as original recipe.  Next time I'll add spices as others suggested.  But is very good on it's own.

Ended up using chicken legs because I couldn't find turkey ones at the store, and it turned out great.  It was wonderful not to have to fool with making gravy when cooking everything else on Thanksgiving day.

I made this gravy for Thanksgiving Dinner this year and it was the best gravy I've ever had!  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  I used 2 wings and 2 legs to make the gravy base but didn't thicken it right away.  After I took my turkey out of the oven, I separated the fat from the browned bits in the bottom of the pan and used a bit of the fat to create a roux.  To the roux, I added the browned bits from the bottom of the pan and very slowly added the gravy base (with the fat removed) from this recipe until I had the consistency I wanted.  I will definitely use this method when I make gravy!  Thanks for taking the stress out of holiday gravy making!!

This recipe will take all the stress out of turkey dinners.  It's foolproof.  One time when I couldn't find turkey wings, I substituted chicken wings and added a dry package of turkey gravy at the end, and it worked beautifully.

Positively delicious.  But, to me, the only way to justify the (fossil-fuel) electricity use is to put the wings/legs in at the same time as the main-deal turkey and simply make the gravy earlier in the day - alot more relaxed and we're in the kitchen anyway!     Thanks! Roasted stock ingredients is an inspired idea.

This was almost the best part of this year's Thanksgiving feast...no waiting until right before dinner to make the gravy and hope it turns out okay.  This is easy, convenient, and SO flavorful!  I used four GIANT turkey wings, which seemed to be enough for this recipe.  I also took one reviewer's suggestion and made a roux with the butter, flour, and some of the chicken stock and added it at the end.  I made it first thing in the morning, and kept it hot in a crock pot until our mid-day dinner.

Wonderful addition to my Thanksgiving dinner. This took off all of the pressure off right before serving dinner.  Also, it was perfect because one of our turkeys was deep-fried so we didnt' have "drippings".  This is the best make-ahead gravy recipe that I have tried and will be a staple in the years ahead.

My first real turkey gravy, and it tasted amazing. I made this for thanksgiving; when the turkey was done, I cut the wings off, and boiled them in a crockpot overnight with the ingredients listed, then followed the directions. (I made a roux with the fat from the liquid) It was awesome- thank you so much for this recipe- it has become my permanent turkey gravy recipe. :)

I cut this recipe down by half, and still had plenty. No one could believe it was homemade. They thought I had bought itl I put some of the turkey wings into the gravy! This is time consuming, but worth every minute. Next time I will make the whole batch and freeze what I don't use.

I made this for Thanksgiving two years ago because we never had enough gravy for a crowd. I plan to make it again this year since we are having a fried turkey but still need gravy for the dressing and mashed potatoes. Really good.

I have been making this for Thanksgiving the last few years because we always deep fry our turkey and there are no left over drippings.  Made the day before and I followed the recipe exactly, except when it came time to combine I simply made a roux and then combined with the stock.  Was rich, delicious, and reheated perfectly the next day.  Everyone loved it, and it's way better than that jarred or canned stuff.

Made this yesterday. Fantastic! My only change was to use 3 turkey legs instead of wings, and added the meat from one leg (chopped) to the gravy.  I also used 2 ribs of celery. I plan on adding the cooked giblets from the turkey on Thanksgiving. I've never spent this much time on gravy, but you can taste the difference.  Thanks!

Great Recipe.  We made this because we deep fried our turkey for thanksgiving.   I could not find any wings so I purchased a turkey breast instead and baked it with lots of butter.  It turned out great.  We also added summer savory herb.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :)

worked out great for thanksgiving. When reheating be sure to reheat it low and stir, I added a little extra turkey stock as I reheated, give or take 3 or 4 tablespoons.

This gravy was very good and helped to make for a more stress free cooking experience on Christmas day. The day I made the gravy I could taste the flour and the gravy was quite thick, so on Christmas day I simply added some of the broth from the turkey as another reviewer suggested.  It left the gravy a good consistency with no flour taste at all.

Great taste and it's nice to have the gravy done ahead of time. We had over 20 people for Thanksgiving with two different turkeys, one baked in the oven and the other deep fried. Because of the quantities of food I had to prepare I was looking forward to having the gravy already prepared. I had a ton of pan drippings from the oven baked turkey and simply poured them into the gravy making it even tastier. Knowing I was going to do this I thickened it with more flour than originally called for. Turned out excellent and we had plenty as I doubled the recipe. This recipe takes quite awhile to make and I'm not sure it would be worth the time for a smaller dinner party but with over 20 guests it saved me a lot of last minute prep work. Thank you for a great recipe!!

I make this for Thanksgiving because I like to do as much ahead as possible and I didn't make the Turkey. It was wonderful!! Nice and smooth and flavorful. I followed it exactly with the exception of using the whole package of wings. I'll try freezing some next time! Thanks, it saved me so much time Thanksgiving day.

Gravy has always been a source of stress for me on thanksgiving, so I just resorted to using the instant packets for gravy.  (for shame!) but this year I made this gravy two days ahead of time.  I was pretty nervous.... and I did use the skimmed off fat plus the butter in a skillet to make a roux with the flour.  I slowly added the roux to the boiling broth... and it never did seem to get very thick.  Discouraged, I put it in a container in the fridge until turkey day.  When I took it out of the fridge it was solid like custard!  I thought I had made it too thick... but WOW, all I had to do was heat it up and it was the PERFECT consistency.  And tasted GREAT.  I will do my gravy like this every year from now on.  How wonderful it was to not have to stress over the gravy on thanksgiving.  :o)

I liked the make ahead part of this recipe....Thanksgiving day is so hectic!  I found it a tad bit bland and had to add some more spices.  Folks liked it...great with turkey and stuffing!

This was very good, just add more seasoning, like poultry seasoning and lots of salt and pepper.

MADE THIS FOR THANKSGIVING & FOUND IT TO BE VERY GOOD.  I HAD 3 TURKEY LEGS ON HAND AND USED THEM INSTEAD OF THE WINGS.  NEXT TIME I WILL USE WINGS AS I REALLY WANT TO SEE IF THE WINGS ARE BETTER---OR NOT.  BUT I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT THE LEGS GAVE ME MEAT TO CHOP UP TO PUT IN THE DRESSING.  IN ANY EVENT, THIS IS A KEEPER.  PEGGY

Can't imagine ever making gravy at the last stressful moment again!  Yes it was a bit of an effort but entirely worth it and can be made days ahead and refrigerated.  Added cooked and chopped giblets from the turkey.  Servings indicate 32, but more like 16 which was a good thing since I was serving 8.  Then again, if you have lots left over, just freeze.  I used 3 large turkey legs instead of 6 wings as that was what was available at the store.  Excellent advice from a reviewer who advised to use a pasta pot and press the veggies with a potato masher.  Made for lots less cleanup.  Also added 3-4 ribs of celery for added flavor.

I followed this recipe (with the exception of using turkey legs instead of wings) up to step 4. At that point, I saved the broth and meat for my noodles and froze them separately. Wow, this makes the best noodle broth ever.

The most perfect gravy! Worth the wait! It does take a while to make seeing it simmers for most the day but you will really enjoy it once it is done.

Excellent recipe--a real lifesaver for me this past T-giving!  I made this two weeks ahead, put it in the fridge overnight, and then skimmed all the fat off the top.  Then I froze it until 2 days before T-giving, and it defrosted perfectly.  Then reheated it on the stove and adjusted the seasoning.  Thank you so much for providing this great recipe!

This should be a 10-star recipe! What a lifesaver to be able to make the gravy beforehand and be sure there will be enough! This gravy is now going in our 'family recipe box' and will be served at all our future holidays. It's the best tasting gravy ever! I made it the day prior, and as suggested by another cook, I used turkey legs.
THANKS for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is great for reducing the last minute rush to get everything done for the Thanksgiving meal.  I halved the recipe, using 3 turkey legs instead of wings.  It does take a long time to make, but, I was making other dishes anyway a day ahead so it was no big deal.  My mom wants to modify it for beef for Christmas!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful gravy! I liked making it the day before thanksgiving.  I placed the turkey wings directly on the roasting pan without the rack and had lots of yummy bits to add to the gravy. I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  I will make this again.

This has been my go-to Holiday gravy for the past four years and I always receive complements on how great it is. This year I re-read the reviews and went with another reviewers recommendation of saving the fat that I skimmed off the top of the liquid after cooling, and made a roux with it. It gave the gravy a much richer taste.

This was amazing! What a stress reliever! I was so much calmer having the gravy prepared the day before. Heated up beautifully and everyone thought it was great.   Only change I made was 3 turkey thighs instead of wings due to availability at the store.  I would use turkey thighs again though I suppose wings would fit better in the stock pot.

This recipe was a great find!  I not only make it for the Holidays  but also to have on hand for other meals as well.  It tastes great and saves me from standing over a hot stove right before we set down to dinner.  Whip some up for yourself, you won't be disappointed!

I made this with a deconstructed turkey removing the breast meat (used for ground turkey sausage). I also use turkey stock instead of chicken stock. This was just what we needed since we smoke our turkey on the Green Egg and don't end up with usable drippings. This is the perfect addition to our Thanksgiving menu.

We make our gravy a few weeks in advance every year - but I do it slightly differently... At the point in this recipe where the hot broth (gravy base) is strained, I then pour it into a few mason jars, seal the lids on, and put them outside to cool.  We store the mason jars in the fridge till Thanksgiving.  All of the fat rises to the top and separates from the broth.   On Thanksgiving day, a few hours before the turkey comes out, I skim off the fat and pick up the recipe at that point with the butter and flour.   It works perfect and the gravy is fresh.   Regardless of how you make this, its important to realize that the amount of gravy you can make is limited by the amount of fat you have.   Therefore its important to use as much fatty turkey (legs, wings) as possible.  You are boiling the fat off of them to become the foundation for your gravy.  If you boiled a lean cut of turkey, you'd have no fat to mix with the flour.  If you want to increase the amount of turkey fat that you have when you are making the gravy, you can blend in a little extra butter to the flour.   All in all, this is spectacular gravy and guests rave about it.   You will look like a pro chef with this recipe.

I can't say enough good things about this gravy.  It has taken the anxiety out of making the Thanksgiving gravy.  I make it the night before and heat it up and add the flour right before dinner.  It is so flavorful and you can make it any time.  I added fresh rosemary and substitute fresh thyme for dried.  I also added poultry seasonings.  The flour ratio should be to your liking - add more flour for thicker, and in my opinion less flavorful, or less for a looser gravy.  Perfection!

The store got turkey necks instead of wings.  So I used them for the initial stock and it was the best gravy I ever made.   I always add two or three beef bullion cubes at the end to enhance the favor.

Turkey has always made me panic weeks before Thanksgiving because I never had enough drippings from the turkey to make a decent amount of gravy.  This recipe allowed me to make as much as I needed prior to Thanksgiving so I didn't have to worry and make gravy last-minute after the turkey was done.  It was GREAT!!

Making this gravy a day or two ahead of the big day, has made getting everything on the table at the last minute, while still hot, a breeze the last two years!

Love that I can make this ahead without having to wait for turkey drippings on Thanksgiving day. However it adds the cost of 6 turkey wings. They're $4 per lb in our area and they were $10 for the wings alone. That is fine since it takes some stress out on the big day. The problem is the recipe turned out really thick. I could have cut the flour in half. And that's what I will do next year. It was tasty though. The house smelled like turkey the day before Thanksgiving after making the gravy.

I made this and took the advice of another reviewer and used chicken for the drippings.  It was delicious!  It held up well and I made it two days prior.  When I re-heated it, I added turkey drippings as well.  I will definitely use this again!

I make this every Thanksgiving but with a few changes. I do 6 Wings, package of necks, and giblets from turkey. Then after meat is baked I add all meat to stock and boil for 2 hours. Then I also add additional drippings from turkey next day, and add roux.

This turned out really well.  I did make a few changes, based on what I had on hand.
I couldn't find turkey wings, so used a 3-pack of turkey drumsticks.  I didn't have any carrots, so substituted celery.
Added 1.5 cups white wine instead of the water.
Added more seasoning (thyme, sage, Goya Adobo).
Definitely a keeper!

As has been mentioned several times, separate the fat to make a roux (you will need additional fat) for a proper thickening agent.  I also added the wing meat back in.  Tastes great and easy to make.  Now if only turkey wings were a bit cheaper.  LOL.

This is the best gravy I’ve ever had. I love the convenience of making it in advance. We didn’t find turkey wings, so I bought chicken wings. When all was said and done, we ate the chicken meat for dinner that night, saving the gravy for Thanksgiving.

Next time I’ll make twice as much. Yum!

I could cry this gravy is sooo good. I'm not a gravy maker and was very shocked when it came out so wonderful.  You can't believe how many bad gravies I have made for Thanksgiving, until doing this one.  Thank you for sharing this!!!!!
 It's worth every moment in preparation.

genius!  Make a week in advance and freeze! As others mention I use the drippings to make my roux, and add soy sauce instead of salt. Also used zaatar seasoning for the gravy. I heat it from thawed in a crock pot and adjust the thickness and seasonings right before serving.

Only change for me is substituting corn starch for the flour to avoid any flour tase. I've probably made this 10 or so times to date. Give it a try and good luck.

This was great to make while baking pies!  I added  fresh garlic and herbs for roasting and celery for simmering. It tasted amazing!  I stored it in a metal pitcher so all I had to do to reheat was put it in a pan of hot water.   Love it!

Very good and super convenient to make the day before.  would make again but next time place the onions below the turkey wings when roasting.  The onions burned and resulted in a gravy a bit too dark.  Made the roux as some reviews suggested and preferred this method.  Also adding turkey drippings the next day would make this a 5 star.

I made this recipe and I got so many compliments on it this past Thanksgiving.  It took a while, but wow was it well worth it!  And I had more than plenty to freeze for next year.  This is a must try for any Thanksgiving fanatic.

I did season the turkey wings with some caribbean seasonings and I added the meat back into it after straining it and it kinda put it over the top in my opinion.

I made this the week before Thanksgiving and it saved so much time on the day of.  I made a roux of the flour and butter, equal amounts of 1/2 cup each then added the strained turkey broth. I seasoned according to my taste, adding a dash of garlic powder, and a touch extra salt, but not too much. Froze for one week. Upon defrosting, and reheating in a pan on the stove, it seemed a bit lumpy, but after stirring with a whisk for a minute or so it became silky smooth and was delicious. I cut this recipoe in half and still had enough. It was fun to make.

This will now be my go to gravy to make. The gravy was so flavorful and tasty. I had trouble locating that many turkey wings, so I substituted turkey legs in with some of the turkey wings.  By the time this broth cooked down and was made into gravy, a person didn't even need salt and pepper. My family raved about the gravy and making it a few days ahead was a time saver.

I used the idea—my daughter was cooking the turkey at her house, but gave me the neck & giblets that I used to make broth. I roasted chicken thighs and neck with the vegetables. I also had a quart of my homemade chicken broth. I loved using the flour to make a roux. Then when we got to the house, I was able to get the drippings from the turkey pan to add in. It was great gravy!

I have never been able to make a decent gravy. Saw this recipe, and Decided to give it a try. It is time consuming,   the time of roasting and the time of cooking on the stove but it is all worth it and very easy. I got great reviews from my family they all loved it. It'll be on our table from now on. Thank you .

I used 3 turkey legs as that what was available.  It came out perfectly. It was one more step I didn't need to do on Thanksgiving Day.  I will do this every year now.  I even have a little left over and will use it for Turkey Pot Pie.

This gravy was very good and saved a lot of time on Thanksgiving Day.  I made it exactly as recipe said - except substituted one can turkey broth for two of the cups of water. Little seasoned salt too. Everyone (19 people) loved it. I’ll make it again.

I tried this recipe and it was just delicious!  We also enjoy having hot turkey sandwiches and we never had enough gravy or just enough that I had to add package gravy mix to make enough for the sandwiches.  This recipe solves that problem!!  Thank you for sharing!

Expensive to make. The 6 wings cost almost 30 dollars. I followed the instructions exactly. The broth tasted burnt and was not useable for Thanksgiving. I will keep and freeze it to add to soup at a later date. Would deffinately NOT make it again.

Excellent! I have always hated making the gravy when everything else is ready to go on the table! Here is the perfect solution and I doubled the recipe so I am certain I will have plenty on Thanksgiving. Would love to have hot turkey sandwiches over the weekend! I did NOT  throw away the veggies after straining. After taking the meat off the wings, I added that meat and the strained veggies to another soup I was making. If I did not have a soup cooking on the stove I would save them, throw them in the freezer for use later on.

I’m giving it a 4 because I made a few changes.  Like others said, it is a lengthy process, but the end result is very good.  I couldn’t get turkey wings, but my local supermarket had necks and backs.  They worked perfectly.  I also took the recommendation of others who said they used a combination of chicken broth and water.  I simmered it for two hours and ended up with a wonderful broth.  While making the gravy, I added in a jar of turkey gravy base by William Sonoma.  It gave me the volume I needed for a large group and a richer color for the gravy.  I didn’t add cayenne pepper, but did add herbs to the gravy.  It was delicious, and it was done early!

I really felt this was way too much work for something this tasteless. I only made one change to the original recipe which was to use chicken wings as I could not find turkey wings. I'm definitely going to have to add turkey dripping on thanksgiving to give it taste.

With adding the roux this is in my book a 5 star recipe. And the longer it sits the richer the flavor. The fact that it's can be made ahead of time, making one less thing to do right before presenting the meal, is a valued bonus for me. And my guests always note how good it is. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this gravy for Thanksgiving 2016. Huge hit!! It's October 2017 and I'm planning to double (at least) the recipt because everyone loved it. I followed the recipe with the addition of a garlic clove while roasting the wings and onions. This year I'll add celery while simmering.

This is a great idea and a great recipe. I used thighs because the wings were all sold out (apparently a lot of folks were using them to make gravy for this recipe they saw on-line). I followed the recipe as closely as I could and the gravy was a big hit at Thanksgiving. The video was excellent “as always”.

This is hands down the best gravy I've ever had. So easy to make and the house smelled heavenly the whole time it was cooking. When I roast a turkey, I never know if I'll have enough drippings from it to actually make a decent gravy, so it's absolutely wonderful to be able to make this ahead of time and have it be so delicious. 

I didn't have turkey wings so I used six chicken wings instead and I used a rondeau pan, which can be used in the oven and on top of the stove...which meant I was able to leave all the drippings and carmelized bits of onion and meat in one pan. Perhaps because the chicken wings are so much smaller, it didn't require nearly as much cooking time. I also used corn starch instead of flour to thicken, since I have friends who are gluten free. It worked perfectly. I plan to make another batch soon and not thicken it so I can use it as a soup base. So excited to have found this recipe.

I'm going 5 on this one for convenience and most importantly taste. My guests had no idea I made this 2 days before thanksgiving. I deglazed the pan with some white wine but other than that followed the directions exactly.

My son smoked two turkeys for Thanksgiving so no drippings.  I made this gravy the day before.  It was so delicious.  Everyone raved about it.  Takes some time for roasting the turkey wings and then making the broth but it was well received by all in attendance.  Will definitely make again.  It certainly  would free up the cook from making gravy when the turkey is ready to be served.

I made this gravy exactly  as written.  It was very easy and had very good flavor.  Made very slight adjustments on the seasoning.  Everyone liked it at Thanksgiving

So great to have this done ahead and have enough to freeze for later.  Easy ingredients and process.  Very tasty.

By far the best gravy!! I will use this every year from now on. It's a little time consuming but well worth it. I followed the recipe just as written and it was perfect.

This is outstanding...but a high-maintenance gravy.  I did two extra "moves" for a silkier, more flavorful recipe:  1) I used smoked wings & smoked necks.  There's no beating this for a memorable taste, and 2) I double-strained it so that there were no bits of veggies or thyme floating in the gravy.  I've made this for 5 straight years at Thanksgiving, and now my family asks me to bring "the world's best gravy."

I have used this great recipe for two years now--once with turkey wings, once with 3 drumsticks. It is a great time saver and you don't feel the pressure of 'What if my gravy sucks?' on Thanksgiving day! I do use cornstarch instead of flour, because that is my go-to thickener, and the gravy always tastes great. (Adjust the amount based on the cornstarch box directions.)

I made this last year as directed and it came out great.   It was a relief for my daughter as the gravy is the last thing made when cooking such a large meal and you are exhausted by then.   The only downside is the cost of turkey wings.  I pay more for the wings than I would a whole turkey.   It also does not produce much gravy after the long simmering time.   I think it could use a richer flavor so I am going to add an additional 2 legs to the stock.

I used carrots and celery when I boiled stock.  Mad a rue out of the fat and butter like suggested.  came out fabulous!  I realized I hate the stress of making gravy the last minute, and it never comes out the way I want it.  Now all I have to do is heat it up on Christmas!  Thank you!  Making turkey salad out of the wing meat tomorrow, which is possibly more flavorful than the breast meat!

I just finished making this gravy and followed the instructions to the letter.  It turned out fantastic and I am quite happy that I'll have an extra 20 minutes on Christmas day because the gravy is already done.   And it tastes great.  I will definitely  make this recipe again.

We have made this for a few years now and it cannot be beat!  With everything else going on it was nice to not have to worry about the gravy!!  We always question the flour slurry but we have never had an issue with it so we haven't changed it. Would give more stars if I could. Thanks!

I made this recipe using Turkey thighs and drumsticks, I roasted them in the oven, as the recipe called for.  After they were done roasting, I added chicken brother with the meat to a stockpot, along with the chopped carrots.  I brought it to a boil and reduced to low.  I cooked the stock overnight, to give it a richer flavor.  I did use more than 6 cups of broth, to make extra.  The next day, the broth was extremely flavorful.  I used Wondra flour- which is a quick acting flour used for gravies.  I used about 8 cups of the stock and transferred and skimmed it into another pot, brought to a boil and then in a separate bowl, I used a couple ladles of the hot stock, mixed with the Wondra.  I kept doing this and adding it back to the rest of the stock, until it reached the desired consistency.  After the gravy was done, I warmed it later on in a crockpot.  It was delicious!

I followed the directions fairly closely, though I made a smaller batch with only two turkey wings.  Maybe I didn't fully cook it down, but I found my scaled-down version produced plenty of gravy.  For thickening, I started with a butter-flour roux but it didn't thicken as much as I would have liked so I mixed up a batch of Wondra and water and that did the trick.  The flavor profile of this gravy was outstanding!  Will definitely make again when I want a tasty gravy but don't have any drippings handy.

I felt like this was a lot of work.  I don't eat gravy and pulling it together at the last minute is always a challenge so we made this the night before.  My daughter in law who loves gravy said it was great.  We doubled it at Thanksgiving and saved half for Christmas.

I've made this Make Ahead Turkey gravy for several years now.  I'll never go back to the last minute scrambling to make the gravy!  It makes a lot of gravy, too, so you've got extra for those open faced sandwiches another day.  I always add my brined turkey drippings to it, so it makes even more gravy and with lots of herbs.  Excellent!

God rest my Mom's soul but she was not a good last minute Turkey Gravy Maker! Therefore, I was not good at it either.  I hated putting a jarred gravy on my homemade EVERYTHING Thanksgiving table. I received the "holiday make-ahead newsletter" with this recipe and was thrilled that it could be done ahead of time. So the week prior to turkey day, I prepared this recipe. My house smelled like Thanksgiving! The recipe is spot-on. You can tweak it to your taste buds but I followed the directions exactly and it produces a beautiful gravy I was proud to put on my table! Thanks for sharing! Cant wait for Thanksgiving next year!

This is going to be a regular for future holiday turkey dinners at my house.  We normally smoke our turkey outside so I don't normally have the yummy pan drippings that you get roasting your bird in the oven.  I loved being able to make this a day or two before the holiday.  It makes it so much less stressful for me. I basically cut the recipe in half and used two wings.  It made more than enough gravy to serve 10 and have plenty left over.  I was skeptical how this would reheat but was great.

A great base to start with but seemed a little sweet to me, so I'll cut back on the carrots next time.  Other than that, it was nice to have that task out of the way prior to Thanksgiving with leftover gravy to boot for the follow-up turkey dishes!

I just finished making this gravy tonight to simply reheat tomorrow to go with Thanksgiving dinner. I substituted the neck and giblets for the wings since my husband prides himself on his turkey frying and doesn't let me touch the bird. I also used home canned chicken stock in place of the broth. It looks amazing for my first time making gravy homemade myself!  The flavor is awesome too. This recipe is easy and amazing- definitely will be used for years to come!

This is a fantastic recipe! So easy and great to have done the day before the holiday. I will probably use this throughout the year as well.

I followed my gut & made a roux with what I skimmed off the top and the butter which I doubled. I also minced  1/2 of the meat and added to the gravy. Tomorrow when I make gravy from the turkey dripping I will ad this make a head gravy to it. We like gravy on our turkey, stuffing and garlic mashed potatoes so there is no such thing as too much gravy. THANK U SUE!  I used to make my extra gravy using extra necks very similar to this. The neck meat is very tender and tasty but work to get the meat off the neck bones. Much easier to get the meat off wings.

Amazing! I had to use smoked turkey wings because that's all that was available. It was perfect! Only other thing is I added a touch of Chicken Bouillon to the gravy to give it a stronger overall flavor.

This is by far the best gravy I've made.  My husband loves it! I tweaked it just a tad, partly out of necessity.  After considering other reviews I roasted half wings and half drumsticks on convection.  Because I didn't pay careful enough attention the onions came out slightly burned.  So, I added some more quartered onions and some celery at second cooking. Then I remembered my gravy separator broke last year so I refrigerated it overnight so it would be easier to skim off the fat.  I then decided to make the roux as one reviewer suggested but when I added that to the simmering broth it was lumpier than I like my gravy to be.  However, a minute with an immersion blender took care of that nicely. The end result is wonderful.  I made enchiladas last night and used the leftover meat and the pressed veggies and they were yummy.  Thanks, Sue for a great recipe!  What a time saving this will be both at Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I've been making this gravy for years and just love it! As a matter of fact, I made a double batch yesterday and froze it so it will be ready for Thanksgiving. Only change I made was to eliminate any water and just use homemade chicken stock. I used 2 turkey wings, 2 turkey drumsticks and a turkey back. Used my blender to mix it smooth.

Results:
-easy to make
-absolutely delicious
-tastes warm and robust
-never going back to turkey gravy mixes! 
-time and stress saver

Alterations: 
-recipe scaled down to yield 4 cups

I was nervous to make gravy for the first time since my family is not a big fan of turkey, but it was so delicious. I don't think we can ever go back to store bought gravy! We used the leftover gravy to season a turkey leftover soup!

What a great idea to make the turkey gravy before Thanksgiving day! I made this gravy recipe the day before Thanksgiving and also made extra gravy from the Turkey drippings on Thanksgiving day. Everyone loved both the gravies and couldn't tell the difference between which gravy was made ahead of time!

I only had 4 turkey wings but kept everything else the same.  The process is long but worth it.  Excellent homemade gravy!  I added giblets with the carrots.  This made plenty!

Everyone LOVED this gravy. It is a bit time consuming but worth the effort.  Curious to see if freezing it alters the flavor at all.  I just emailed this recipe to two family members since they loved it so much ! We used homemade chicken stock instead of store bought.  WORTH THE EFFORT !

I was so happy to find this recipe after realizing that being our first year deep-frying the turkey we'd have no drippings for gravy! Ran to the store & found turkey necks very cheap. Used those along with some homemade chicken stock I had in the freezer. Added a couple ribs of celery to the roasting process & other than the above changes stuck to the rest of the recipe & instructions. Added plenty of pepper to taste (& a few fresh basil leaves I had leftover) & this was just some fantastic gravy that our meal would not have been complete without!!!!!

We always deep fry our turkey, so I made this gravy today. I did as some other reviewers suggested and made a roux with the fat, then whisked in the turkey stock and chicken broth. I used 2 wings and cut the recipe down accordingly, as there will be only 4 of us for Thanksgiving. I think something is wrong with the proportions, however, as I made a third of the recipe and came out with 1 cup of gravy (original yield=8 cups; 1/3 recipe should=more than 2.5 cups). Oh well, I have 1 cup of REALLY tasty gravy!

I would have given this 5 stars however, I changed it slightly. I used turkey thighs and legs for a more flavorable base. Then I made a roux with the reserved fat and added it to the base. Great time saver, freezes perfectly.

This is my first review.  I use this web site all the time and never commented on any recipe, though I've loved most of them.  This gravy was fabulous! I followed the recipe as written and everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving.  I was glad I made it because my turkey had very little drippings which would've been a disaster without this make ahead recipe.  Will definitely be making this again.  Like another reviewer suggested, buy the wings when they're on sale and freeze them. That will reduce the cost.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe and made last year's Thanksgiving dinner less stressful for me. I'd rather do the work ahead of time and know that everyone will love the gravy.  Thanks for sharing this - I'll be making it again soon for this Thanksgiving!

This has changed the way I do turkey gravy forever!  I like to do things ahead, and this is perfect so that I'm not trying to de-fat the broth for gravy.  Great taste!  I agree....turkey or chicken wings make for great gravy.

Excellent flavor, easily tweaked (I add celery and carrots with the onions when roasting), and reheats like a dream in a low temp crock pot.  Making the gravy always delayed getting everything to the table because of lack of stove top space.  Adding the juices after the turkey's cooked just makes this taste even better. It's not a difficult recipe, but it's not quick either with lots of steps.  I buy the wings months in advance with an eye to sale prices and freeze them to make this a very low-cost gravy.

This gravy was excellent. I made it ahead of time and added it to the gravy I made from my turkey and it came out delicious. What a lifesaver as I had 21 guests for dinner and there is never enough gravy.

I have been using this recipe every Thanksgiving for over 10 years.  It is awesome, tastes great & makes alot of gravy.  Best of all no hectic hassle of making gravy , when u have so many things to do at the last minute b4 serving a huge meal.  Only one thing i have added to this is celery, stalks & green leaves.

This is worth every star.  It doesn't get much easier than this! Excellent as written, but it's also easy to add the seasonings you like to flavor it to your family's tastes.  This is a lifesaver! Making gravy is probably the most stressful part of the meal. Now the only thing to do is sit back and enjoy the compliments.

I have made this gravy all ready for Christmas.  It is not only delicious (I had to try it, of course) - it's easy.  People have said it's hard but it's not - it's just a lengthy recipe to follow.  I can hardly wait for my guests to try it.

Great recipe!  I am a novice at gravy, so I didn't want to make it when I make the turkey.  I used 4 turkey wings, 4 turkey legs, and I added 2 celery stalks.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  The gravy tastes great with no extra seasoning.

I agree with SUNNY681 - the flavor just wasn't quite there for some reason.  I will probably just make the gravy as usual after the turkey is done in the future.  It was a good time saver in that regard, and wasn't bad, but I like the turkey gravy from the turkey drippings much better, must be because the turkey is seasoned differently than these turkey legs (which I used).

This gravy was delicious and very nice to have done ahead of time before Thanksgiving.  However, if you are someone who knows how to make gravy, it probably doesn't make much sense to go to the added trouble this recipe requires.  I do not know how to make gravy, so for me, it was great.  It is a bit of a project, though, since you have to cook the turkey just for this.  I used wings and legs and used the meat for the turkey soup recipe from this site.  The gravy and the soup were both delicious!

This is a tasty gravy and it's great to have one less chore to do on the big day, but it takes a sweet forever to make! It's well and good if making it is part of your holiday ritual, but if you aren't mentally prepared to be in some special gravy-making Zen-like state, you will likely be very annoyed to be spending hours making a dish that would take you take you 15 minutes if you were doing it T'giving Day.

But it's tasty, and if you're serving a crowd, guarantees you'll have enough. Mine was thin but I could've thickened it easily by adding a little cornstarch dissoved in cold water. Nobody seemed to mind. 

It makes a ton, so freeze it in two containers & you'll be set for two holidays.

WOW!  This was absolutely FANTASTIC!  I used 3 turkey legs and 2 turkey wings.  I lightly oiled the legs and baked per the directions.  I omitted the carrots as I am not a fan of the taste of cooked carrots.  I added the fat reserve to the chicken broth and flour and I really think that was the icing on the cake.  I don't think it would have been as good if I hadn't done that.  This is absolutely the best gravy recipe I've ever used.  I will do this every year from now on.
