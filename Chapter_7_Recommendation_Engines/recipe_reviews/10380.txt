The first time I made these I did it exactly as the recipe says using regular Jiff peanut butter. They were for a going away party at work and they were gone before the end of the day - wonderfully yummy, many people asked me for the recipe. Since then I have tried many experiments. This recipe is extremely flexible; you can really fun with it. So far my favorite way is to use about 1/4 cup more peanut butter (I now use natural and it makes a tasty difference,) I also use a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. They come out tasting like a confection. I have also discovered that this dough can be refrigerated, you can cut off a cookie or two or three at a time, bake and enjoy! Way better and cheaper then the pre-packaged ready to bake cookies.

Thank You for sharing this with us!!!

Mary, thanks for sharing Aunt Cora's recipe! They were so tastey! I made 1 batch according to the recipe and one batch with 1/3 cup roasted salted peanuts and 1t vanilla. Try the variation, they really enhance the peanut butter flavor!

A very respectable cookie!  I like the light peanut butter taste.  I even used less sugar (about 3/4 C of each kind) and about 3 TB less margarine then the recipe called for (to cut down a bit on calories) with good results!

These did not seem like they would be very spectacular because of their simplicity. But they were!! Very rich and chewy, but for those who thought they did not have much flavor, my suggestion would be to add 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. salt and just make sure you take them out of the oven when the middles look underdone but the outside just starts to turn brown. Let them cool a minute and they firm up fast.

Continuing the peanut butter theme, I used Nestle peanut butter and chocolate morsels.  I substituted half butter, half shortening for the margarine and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I baked them large, using a large cookie scoop, about 13-1/2 minutes.  This is a soft, sweet, very peanut buttery cookie.  Hubs declared them the best peanut butter and chocolate cookies he's ever had.

I love Aunt Cora!  These are great cookies.  Not only delicious but beautiful, too.  To the rater that ended up with the too flat cookies:  your eggs are probably too big.  Older recipes often used small eggs and today even our small eggs are pretty big.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs and 1 yolk and they were gorgeous.

Incredibly wonderful -- chewy, tender and full peanut-y taste.  One suggested variation: for less spread and a chunkier cookie, use a combination of butter and shortening. Very delicious!

These were pretty good. I made a few little changes just for my personal preferences (butter instead of margarine, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and a dash of salt). PS - to the reviewer who said their cookies were flat, try putting a layer of parchment paper over your cookie sheet next time you make any drop cookies. This will prevent spreading (which makes cookies flat and icky looking); plus, you can turn over the parchment sheet between each batch and reuse it!

I wouldn't say "worlds greatest", but they were good.  I still like my grandma's recipe much better.  I did add just a little bit more peanut butter, as well as, a bit more vanilla.  I had seen some reviews saying that the cookies didn't have that much flavor.  One thing I always do is use the best chocolate chips I can buy...Ghiradelli is my favorite.  It makes all the difference in the world.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was strange.  The batter was peanut butterylicious.  Was really looking forward to eating the cookies! They came out of the oven, and after they were cool enough to eat without burning my mouth, I tried one.  It was completely flavorless except for the chocolate chips...no cookie taste at all.  After sitting for a while, I thought I'd try another one, since I read a review saying they tasted better after sitting.  I would have to agree, that there was a little more flavor after sitting.  However, I feel that nothing beats eating a cookie fresh out of the oven, so I won't be making these again.

Wow, this is truly the best cookie that I have ever tasted. I used milk chocolate chips and they were sooooo good! I made them twice in one week. The second time I made them, I put the dough in a gallon frezer bag and stored in the fridge. I just made a batch at a time. My co-workers loved them. Several asked for the recipe.

Excellent cookies!  My 3 boys devoured these in no time, almost as soon as they came out of the oven.  I did reduce each the brown and white sugar to 3/4 cup each, as well as using all natural peanut butter instead of regular.  I also used butter instead of margarine, which I also reduced by a bit, only because I was almost out (maybe closer to 3/4 cup).  My chocolate chips were a mix of both semi sweet and peanut butter, YUMMY, not quite 2 full cups worth.  Thanks Aunt Cora, these were some super yummy cookies!

These should be known as Aunt Cora's World's Most Beautiful Cookies!  They came out looking like they belonged in a magazine!  I used butter instead of margarine and an extra dollop of peanut butter, otherwise followed exactly.  I had no problems with spreading of the cookies, they retained their shape  beautifully.  I couldn't keep my husband out of the dough as I was trying to make these!  Great tasting both the right after baking and the days after.  Thanks for a great cookie!!

These did not turn out chewy for me. Dry and sandy, better than fluffy and cakey but not chewy like everyone eles says. It was delicious cookie dough and made pretty cookies but they turn to sand in my mouth. I wish I could find pb cookie so chewy it almost pulls your teeth out chewy, you have to rip it chewy. I wasn't expecting that from this but this is not chewy at all.

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed the directions closely, my only 2 alterations were using salted butter (I'm a bad cook, it was all I had in the house!) and adding 1 tsp of vanilla as recommended.  I baked each batch for 14 minutes, and let them sit a few before taking them off.  I was worried at first because the dough seemed a bit too soft to me, but they turned out wonderfully!  Soft, a bit crumbly, and the hit of the party! EDIT: I have made these at least 25 times over the past few years. I would recommend adding peanut butter chips, as well. The result is phenomenal! I also sometimes add Reeses Pieces or M&Ms, if I have them on hand. (I adjust the chocolate chips accordingly, I never put more than 3 cups total of add-ins.) I have a pound of butter softening for a double batch of these right now, and I'll do 2 cups of chocolate chips, 2 cups of peanut butter and 1 cup of Reese Pieces. :)

Aunt Cora was a genius. This is the best cookie I have ever tasted. I have tries a whole lot of cookies. The batter was smooth and creamy, the texture of the cookie is light and just about melts in your mouth. I would say to everyone who likes peanut butter and chocolate chip to make this one. I told everyone who would listen to me about this one. If you do not like peanut butter and chocolate chip, I would like to say, what is your problem???? Aunt Cora, THANK YOU!!!!

I halved this recipe in case we didn't like them and man, am I kicking myself now. These are an all around pleaser (kids, husbands, etc.) Easy to make and makes a nice little gift for teachers, etc.

WOW!  I am a firm believer in baking with butter but when the recipe called for margarine, I thought I'd obey and am I glad I did!!  (especially since margarine is much less expensive in my neck of the woods)....follow this recipe EXACTLY and you have a phenomenal cookie on your hand!

I was very distracted by the kids when I made this...and forgot to stir in the chocolate chips!  How silly!  Anyway, my first dozen did NOT have chips.  While they were in the oven, I added the chips to the rest of the dough.  I actually like the cookies withOUT the chips better! The cookies with the chips were very good also, but it over-powered the peanut butter flavor.  Funny how you accidentally find variations to great recipes!

ok So I had the cook book and this is my Fav cookie to make. The only thing I change is I use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate because my hubby hates chocolate chips. I make this recipe times 3 at Christmas along with some others to give out as Christmas presents and people can't stop talking about them.

Aunt Cora did well!  These cookies are soft, peanut buttery goodness.  I chose to only make 1/2 of a batch and they didn't last long.

What a yummy cookie. I did as another reviwer suggested and added 1/4 cup more peanut butter and used a mix of peanut butter and chocolate chips. I used butter rather then margerine since that is what I had. Oh and by mistake I added 2 tsp of baking soda. I am not sure if that is what caused them to be nice a thick or if that is how they would normallt be, since we live at high altitude. I used an ice cream scoop to make them and got 3 dozen from this. These cookies where chewy, crisp, and flakey all at the same time. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is really a great cookie recipe! As another baker had suggested I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. vanilla and they came out wonderful. I have to say I was tempted to let them stay in the oven a while longer than recommended because they just looked too uncooked but they werent...let them sit a minute...they have a nice delicate texture. Everyone who tried them loved them.

These cookies are fanfreakingtastic!!  I used powdered egg replacer in place of the eggs (I'm vegan and don't eat eggs.), and that worked fine.  Other than that I used the ingredients and measurements listed in the recipe.  Next time, I'll probably use a few less chocolate chips (just a little too much for me).  Definitely give these a try if you love peanut butter and chocolate!

My family loves peeanut butter cookies. This is an excellent recipe. I subsituted butter flavored crisco for the margarine and chilled the dough a little. I am always afraid of flat cookies when I use all margarine. I baked for 15 minutes. Got rave reviews from the kids and hubby.

This was a very good recipe. I always add a little extra peanut butter; it gives it more of a peanut butter taste. I made two batches for our Cookie Exchange. It was a big hit. I had about four dozen cookies left over and they were gone in a week!!!

Great recipe!  I made a double batch the other night, and they turned out great.  Nice and chewy.  I also added vanilla (almost all of my cookies gets vanilla), and before putting in the chocolate chips, I split the dough up and used Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Chips in one half (they are oversized chips and dee-lish), and used Nestle's Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate Chips in the other half, but it was a little bit of a peanut-butter overkill (and I eat the stuff straight out of the jar!).  I then melted some milk chocolate and mixed it in with the dough containing the peanut butter and chocolate chips, and they were great as well.  This one is definitely a keeper!  Oh, and I baked these on the 26th and they are still as soft and chewy as when they came out of the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I mostly tried this recipe because it was rated so highly and because I had the ingredients.  I used three eggs and the cookies came out incredible. I soft backed half as instructed and crisped the other (10min at 375).  Both were wonderful!!  I took them to work, I got 20 thumbs up there...

This recipe, while good, needs much more peanut butter, I would suggest doubling the peanut butter and cutting the butter in half.

These were a very good peanut butter cookie. They had a good appearance and were nice and chewy. They are very sweet, but they are cookies so that is to be expected. I made 1/2 recipe and got 38 cookies, or over 3 dozen, using a standard cookie scooped. I also baked them on parchment paper. As the reviews were good, I decided to follow the recipe exactly even using the margarine. I used Blue bonnet margarine and Skippy creamy natural for the peanut butter. The only change I made, which I wish I didn't, was using a bag of half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. These are a very peanut buttery cookie and the all chocolate chips would have been perfect. Mine did take the full 15 minutes to bake.

Sensational - an absolute delight!  These had the perfect texture also, crispy edges with a chewy middle.  We cut the chocolate chips in half and they were still very rich.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These cookies are amazing.  Have been making them for years.  Everyone always raves.  I usually add 1/2 to 1 tsp of vanilla.  They're not really a peanutty tasting cookie in spite of the peanut butter.  This is our go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Beats the others, hands down.

GREAT recipe! This recipe made picture perfect cookies, and you can easily taste both the peanut butter and chocolate in every bite. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside -- awesome. I took others suggestion and added 1tsp vanilla and 1/2tsp salt; I also used real butter in place of margarine.

These are my very favorite peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  I have tried others from this site although none have compared.  If you like peanut butter try these.  I use real butter and milk chocolate chips and they are perfect and do not grease the pan.  A perfect cookie your family will love

I love these cookies.  Peanut butter and chocolate are just yummy!  They are soft right out of the oven, and are crispy after they cool.  I used a Tablespoon to measure out the cookies and cooked them for 8 minutes - Perfection!

Really good and REALLY easy to make.  You really only need one measuring cup!  6 of them were eaten right off the pan, so they must've been good!  The only reason I'm only giving them a 4 is because I find that there are just too many chocolate chips in them (never thought that was even possible!).  But other than that, they're delicious.

Really good, but mine spread more than in the picture, I wonder why?  These are very  tasty and the right consistency.  I will make them again.  I always add a touch of vanilla to all my cake and cookie recipes.

Perfect! I used Smart Balance buttery spread, smooth natural peanut butter, 3/4c white sugar, 1/4c turbinado sugar, 3/4c brown sugar, 1 1/2c AP flour, and 1/2c whole wheat pastry flour. The cookie to judge all cookies by!

I made these for my boyfriend and he absolutely LOVES them. He ate 2 dozen of these huge cookies in 4 days!! They turn out nice and big and chewy and gooey. 
Oh yeah i made them with Fleishman's lactose-free margarine and President's Choice Decadent semi-sweet chocolate chips to make them dairy free because we are both lactose intolerant. They are wonderful and I know i will be bribed into making them again.

I must say I have been using this recipe for a few years now and it is just great! If you're in the mood for something more than just the regular chocolate chip cookie, THIS IS IT! If you like a more peanut buttery cookie like me, add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. These disappear fast!

Very delicious. I didn't have any chocolate chips, and added about a tbsp. of cocoa powder instead-- it was good, but I am sure the chocolate chips are way better. To save time, I poured the batter into a 9x11 baking dish and baked it for about 40 minutes. The end result was more like "cookie bars."

I have made these cookies many times.  I use butter (instead of margarine) and milk chocolate chips.  Bake just until the edges get brown and they will stay soft and chewy.  I take these to work and people beg for more!  They think I picked them up at a bakery.

Very good cookies.  Though I have others that I prefer to these, there's absolutely nothing wrong with them.  They have a delicous peanut butter flavor with a dash of chocolate taste. I used half creamy, half crunchy peanut butter, and added a spoonfull more than the recipe called for. I also used a few peanut butter chips b/c I had some left over from another recipe.  I only had 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips around the house, so I added another cup of milk chocolate chips.  Lastly, I only bake with Lite margarine and it never seems to affect the taste of the final product. The cookies came out great after 13 minutes in the oven.  Yummy and gooey!

These cookies are very good.  Nice, crispy texture and not too flat.  Made them a few weeks ago and still have 1/4 of a cookie jar left.  We still prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies.

This recipe was GREAT!  The cookies were nice and chewy, not too hard or too soft.  Like recommended, we add a tsp. of vanilla.  We made half a batch, thinking that even 24 would be too much, but they magically disappeared in about 3 days!  Yum!

Great texture & flavor! Did not spread out too much like some cookies.  I used butter instead of margarine & mini chocolate chips instead of regular.  My kids & husband loved them.  Will definitely make these again.

Didn't realize I hadn't put in a review on this yet, but I've been making these cookies for quite a few years.  They are always a hit!  I use crunchy peanut butter.  They are the best.  I have passed this recipe on to many friends who requested it!  In fact, I got this from a friend.. they way I found this site many years back (Thanks Heather!).  YUM!!

While making these cookies, I tasted the dough and thought these cookies would be the most amazing cookies ever but once baked, what a let down!  Not exciting, just an average chocolate chip cookie with a hint of peanut butter.  
The dough was very sticky and I actually chilled it to make it easier to work with.

Oh my goodness!!!  These are the best Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookies I have ever made.  I took the advice and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and they were outstanding.  They are the best when eaten the same day they are made though.  The dough froze beautifully which is nice when I don't want to bake the entire batch of dough.  I can pull out just the number of fresh cookies I need and bake them in only a few minutes.  I would highly recommend them!!!!

Hmm. Well, I'm not sure what I could have done wrong, but these cookies came out really dry and way too crumbly. They were edible, but that's about it. I even tried doubling the peanut butter as some of the other reviewers suggest, but they were not very good. I also tried playing around with the baking time, but still no good. Oh well, I guess I'll keep looking for that perfect peanut butter cookie recipe.

These are delicious cookies that are easy to make and use standard ingredients--you couldn't ask for more! (Although the people who taste them always ask for many more.) To the bakers who thought they didn't carry enough peanutty flavor, add a little more peanut butter to your liking.

This is my favorite cookie EVER. I did add the vanilla/salt that one reviewer suggested. My favorite way to make these is to split the amount of chocolate chips with mini M&Ms.

Great cookie. I used whole wheat flour instead.  It came out great.  I also cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Plently of sweet. :0)

The recipe is easy enough to prepare and the cookies are very good, maybe not the world's greatest, but good.  However, the recipe neglects to instruct the baker to make small cookies.  If you make scoop #20 or #30, only 4 cookies will fit on a cookie sheet.  Also, I had to reduce the cooking time to 11 minutes.  The cookies are brown and hard at the edges and they stick to the sheet even if you pre-grease the cookie sheet

Very good. I substituted unsalted butter, added a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vanilla. Baked at 325 on convection for 12 minutes. Cookies puffed, but flattened on cooling. Good and chewy!

I've been making these four at least four years and everyone always loves them. They are nice and moist. I would tend to agree with one reviewer who said there may be too many chips..if there ever was such a thing. Start with 1 and a half cups and judge..you can always stir in more. I have tried vanilla, as another reviewer suggested, and I wouldn't use it again. I have also substituted the white flour with one cup oats and one cup wheat flour with great results.

...This is a very flavorful and delicate cookie...I used butter, substituted 1 cup pb chips and added a little vanilla, salt and baking powder.  I refrigerated the dough and used a cookie scoop...After baking for 12 mins had to leave them on the cookie sheet to cool...These MELT in your mouth..try 'em..you'll like 'em :)

I have made these many, many times!  I always use real butter and about 1/4 c. more pb, for more peanutty flavor.  They are terrific, a winner with everyone from kids to adults...there are never any left overs!!!  Thanks for the cookie staple recipe!

I'll give these a 3 for taste, but I'd give them a 0 for appearance. These cookies are the flattest cookies I have ever made. I would never serve to company as people eat with their eyes first. I tried chilling the dough, but that did not help. I won't be making these again.

These were delicious! I used whole wheat flour and added a t. of vanilla and also an xtra 1/4 c. of peanut butter. I chilled the dough for about 30 minutes before baking. The taste is wonderful and the "chewiness consistency" is just right. One of the best cookies I've made!

yum. i made these to mail to a friend and ended up eating half of them. i added an extra blob of peanut butter and used peanut butter and milk chocolate chips. very soft and chewy but you have to take them out long before they look done (they really are done).

I've been using this recipe for years and it always gets rave reviews. I did find that you have to use the full fat versions of ingredients to get the best flavor. I prefer making these to regular chocolate chip cookies.

My family LOVES these cookies. I make some in regular size for the little folks and use large scoop for the rest of us. I always make a double batch. I use chunky peanut butter and use the whole jar for a double batch:)

These cookies are soft and delicious! Changes I made to recipe: used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup shortening, added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also used chocolate chunks because that's what I had on hand. Cookies are done baking when just lightly browned around the edges even though they look like they could use a few more minutes.  Mine were puffy but deflated when I set down the cookie sheet.  I did not remove them from the sheet for several minutes so they were firm enough to not fall apart.  Excellent!

A little bland on the peanut butter, but the texture was great and the p.b. taste came out a little when they had sat overnight.

These cookies are awesome.  I found the recipe a week ago and already have made them twice.  A co-worker suggested adding more peanut butter, but he could eat a jar of peanut butter with nothing else so I just ignored his comment.  I plan on trying with peanut butter chips and/or chopped nuts next time.

A few mods (I'm not really one for cooking with measuring utensils) turned out really well.  This recipe is great as is, but is also really flexible and works well as a starting point for creativity!

I've made this recipe several times...in fact, I've all but scrapped my other cookie recipes.  My whole family loves it and guests have requested the recipe.  Every batch I've made comes out thick and stays soft and chewy.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Very easy, I omitted the chocolate chips, and made Chocolate Kiss Cookies instead (put hershey's chocolate kiss in the center of each cookie half way thru baking time)  But to do the Hershey Kiss Cookies, I had to increase the flour, but it was really great.

This is an excellent cookie recipe!  I am traditionally a chocolate chip cookie fan, but adding the cup of peanut butter gave these an all new, wonderful flavor.  My husband loved them and took a Christmas tin of them to work.  Thumbs up!! from everyone there.  P.S. I also added chopped walnuts to half the batch.  ALso excellent, Thank You!!

These are the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. My family was eating them faster than I could make them.  I did change a couple of things.  I subbed about 1/3 cup of butter flavoured shortening and about 1/4 cup more peanut butter and combined milk chocolate and white chocolate chips to make 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups.   YUMMMMMMMMMMY! I love this recipe site.

I found this recipe in the new cookbook and couldn't wait to try them.  I used two substitutions because I lacked some necessary ingredients (margarine and baking soda).  I instead used butter and baking powder instead.  The cookies were phenomenal!!  They were very soft with a perfect peanut butter taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, are these good cookies!  My husband said they are excellent.  The peanut butter flavor is not too strong -enough to know it is in there, but different in taste from a true peanut butter cookie.  What I love about these cookies is that they hold their shape very well - they did not spread all over the pan and look like perfectly shaped cookies when cool - just like from a gourmet cookie shop.  This recipe makes LOTS of cookies too.  A real winner of a recipe!

I used all butter and chocolate chunks instead of chips.  They were delicious, but a little flat for my taste -- maybe this is due to the butter vs. margarine?

Good tasting cookie but they flatten out a lot. They're a crispy cookie. Don't put them close together.  Be aware that they're pretty greasy with all the oleo and peanut butter.

These were absolutely the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies I could have made. The only things I did different was add a teaspoon of vanilla and used about a cup and a half of extra crunchy peanut butter to compensate for my two extra large eggs. These were perfect! This is a keeper recipe! Thanks Mary Hays!

Perfectly beautiful recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of salt. To give them the crackly top, I added a half teaspoon of cream of tartar to the flour mixture. I also opted for natural peanut butter. Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading these reviews I had to make these cookies.  They are as amazing as everyone said!  I added the vanilla, touch of salt, tad less butter and used the chocolate and peanut butter chips. They are now a gift to a colleague who is retiring. I'm going to be pleased to present these delicious and beautiful cookies to him. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! I agree with another reviewer that they are not the most peanut-buttery, but they are still extremely satisfying and easy to make! I did add 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt, only because ;I feel every cookie should have those.

I have made this recipe several times because these cookies are awesome.  They are practically no-fail because the peanut butter makes the cookies bake up super nice, but the flavor is much lighter than plain peanut butter cookies.  Now I always make a double batch so there are some left the next day; the kids love them as much as Mom.

Absolutely wonderful!  I did halve recipe and still ended up with over 3 dozen cookies.  Used half chocolate chips and half peanut butter.  Delightfully moist and chewy - a new favorite!  As someone suggested, I tried chilling dough and using parchment paper and ended up with minimal flattening.  Will definitely make again and thank you so much for recipe.

These cookies are the best cookies I have ever made/eaten.  I could not believe it.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the pb and chocolate chip combination, but they are delicious!  I only baked them for 9-10 min, though.  That way they stay really soft and moist even after a day or two.

These are really good! But I did use about 1/4 cup more peanut butter because I didn't feel that the flavour was quite strong enough.

These cookies looked/tasted amazing. Not the healthiest cookies, but if you don't care about the calories, made the cookies! Perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. I've made them for my family and a group of 23 year old guys. Disappeared within an hour both times. I recommend taking them out when just about to brown, bc they will turn more golden on the pan. If you wait until golden in the oven, they will turn out drier/crispier.

These were good.  Everyone loved them.  I'm still in search of the perfect peanut butter cookie.  I think they would be better with more peanut butter.  I will try it that way next time.  They did, although, get better with time.

Seriously these are so good!  I used butter instead of margerine; that's just a personal preference of mine.  Everything else I did as written.  I don't like peanut butter cookies, but I love these.  Will make again and again!

Excellent cookie, but make sure you tell your guests BEFORE they try the cookies that these treats have peanut butter in them. Otherwise, the taste can kind of be alarming to a person expecting a regular chocolate chip cookie

4 stars because I'm nice :-).  3 stars for me personally, a little oily (try putting them on a paper towel and leave it a few hours!  you get a puddle of oil!), but other people loved them.  You do taste the peanut butter!  Followed recipe except I added a few peanut butter chips in addition to the chocolate ones.  These do have great cookie texture (NOT cakey, imo) and they're easy, but not world's greatest for me.

i love peanutbutter and i love chocolate, it was the perfect mix.  My 3 year old son who is very picky and never really shows interest in too many foods, was caught red handed taking another cookie off the cooling rack, which I've never seen him do before. He had chocolate from ear to ear, grining. I couldn't help but laugh and give in.

These are great cookies.  I didn't change a thing (a yummy chocolate chip cookie with a taste of peanut butter).  I was a bit nervous after I tried a few right from the oven, but they tasted so much better the next day.  Great for when you have to make ahead (and this recipe makes a lot of cookies!).

I think it is great - tastes like a choco chip recipe with a subtle peanut butter taste. We used butter and added vanilla. I'm not sure about adding more p'nut butter, that can make it more crumbly. I love the goey texture. I baked for 13 minutes on a silicone baking sheet, and it didn't burn at all. It could have gone 15 minute, but I like them gooey! We love it. It makes a ton of cookies too!

These cookies were great. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first attempt at making cookies! I would give the cookies five stars for taste but my cookies fell apart when I tried to pick them up so I only gave four stars.  Very soft and full of peanut and chocolate flavors. Next time I would put a little less sugar.  Great cookies.

Oh WOW!!! These were the best cookies that I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. I chilled the dough for about 20 minutes before baking. My family loved them! I cant wait to bake more (They were all eaten in 3 days)

This is a GREAT recipe !! I've made 2 adjustments that makethe cookies a bit different - I use the little M&M bits, and also use the skippy doubly-delicious peanut butter with bits of chocolate IN the peanut butter. These cookies are sinfully rich and delightful - my family and co-workers love them !

This recipe is the best cookie recipe ever.  It was super easy!  I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and instead of all semi sweet chips I use 2/3 c peanut butter chips, 2/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chunks and 2/3 cup milk chocolate chips and they are THE BEST COOKIES EVER!

Instead of chocolate chips, I used white chocolate chunks and macadamia nut pieces.  They turned out great!  The only bad thing I could say about them is that they are very fragile cookies.  Soft and yummy but not ideal to box and ship- as I had intended to do.  My boyfriend and office mates loved them, however (and ME, too!)

This was a very good cookie!  I took them to work and everyone just loved them.  They didn't want the recipe because they don't bake.  They leave that up to me.  Ha! Ha!  I added just a tad bit more peanut butter (I used chunky), and a little vanilla.  I also thought they had a better shape when I rolled them into balls(about 1 1/2 inch).  Everyone of them were perfectly shaped. I know, because the first batch I made, I didn't shape into balls and they weren't near as pretty.  The cookie also has a great texture..  Thanks for the recipe, Mary

I made these cookies this afternoon and they're just great. I have no problem giving them 5 stars. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla extract as recommend by reviewers and I also added a cup of chopped walnuts. Family and friends loved them too. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yummy yummy!  I thought the amount of peanut butter was just fine, although I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  One thing Aunt Cora, or Mary Hays, didn't tell us though-- how big should the cookies be???

Great recipe =) Made a couple modifications based on some of the comments I read, like adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract and extra peanut butter. The next time I use it, though, I think I'm gonna reduce the number of chocolate chips by a 1/4 cup. Maybe a little too sweet, but otherwise a great recipe and (the best part) very easy to make.

A great tasting cookie, lovely and soft.  I used chunky peanut butter and I think that gave it the extra peanut flavour it needed.

This was an excellent recipe with exactly the results I'd hoped for.  I used milk chocolate chip instead of semi-sweet and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Excellent!

These cookies were a good change from your basic chocolate chip cookie.
I also added 1/4 cup more flour. Really didn't have that much of a peanut butter taste, so 
the addition of peanut chips probably would have given me a more stronger peanut butter flavor.
I would probably make them again, but it will not replace my current chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I personally prefer chewy cookies, so for a crispy cookie, I thought these were pretty good!  They have a really nice texture and flavor.  For extra peanut flavor I used half chocolate and half peanut butter chips.

These were really good.  I did add ~1/4 cup extra peanut butter and 1/4 cup extra brown sugar as well.  I also reduced the baking time by 2 or 3 minutes.  My first batch was overdone.

These cookies are great. Made them when my sons family came to visit.  The cookie jar was always empty.  The batter seemed a little soft so I added about 1/4 cup extra flour.  They were perfect.  Will definately make them again.

I cut this recipe in half and still had plenty of cookies.  After the first batch came out, I thought that they needed more peanut butter; so, I added about a 1/4 cup more and found that those were better.  I would say this is a good cookie recipe but not close to the world's greatest as the name implies.  I would make them again though, they are good.

I made this recipe with my two year old, and the 9 and 11 year-olds that I babysit--it was super easy and quick.  The cookies were tasty but I wouldn't call them the best I'd ever had.  They were on the crisp side, rather than chewy, even when I reduced the baking time a few minutes.  I don't think I'd use this recipe again--I have had better cookies of this kind.
