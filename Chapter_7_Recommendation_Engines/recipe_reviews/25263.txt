I make these green beans often (I needed a way to dress up my green beans one evening) I do not use any butter (just a lot of dressing).  To avoid the green beans being over cooked I have found if you simmer the dressing for a while before adding the green beans it will thicken up and coat the green beans nicely and you will avoid over cooking them. (By the way I use the Zesty Italian Dressing) *Update: I have now started using a Fat Free Italian Dressing.  So there is no oil to worry about!  (When using the Zesty Dressing I would just turn the bottle updside down and let the oil float to the top so when I removed the cap there was less oil).

Absolutely delicious.  I added only 3 Tbsp of butter, used Splenda and added some fresh mozzarella in the last minute and it's awesome.  Very tasty the next day too!

I was quite disappointed.  The recipe has you using way to much butter to begin with, has you cooking the beans a lot longer than necessary, and the taste isn't that great.  Tastes like green beans with salad dressing.  We were all unimpressed.  This recipe may be better with a different kind of salad dressing, but I think no matter what you do, it will taste exactly like what it is:  green beans with salad dressing!

This recipe has become my go-to comfort food. So easy, so delicious, and always a crowd pleaser! My daughter loves these kind of green beans too!  My husband adds a little balsamic vinegar to change the recipe up some times. A++++++

This was a side dish at my mother's day dinner.  It was a hit!  I added extra dressing, and I used a Pesto Italian dressing, it was yummy.

Very tasty but the beans got overcooked in only 15 minutes, I will make them again but won't cook them as long.  I also used a Greek Feta dressing that was delicous.

Delicious! I didn't have fresh green beans, so I used frozen and brought 2 tablespoons of butter and half a cup of Italian Dressing to boil then added in the green beans. I also added black pepper and garlic powder and simmered with a lid on about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. When they were done, I drained the excess dressing out, put the green beans in a casserole dish and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top! I will definitely make this again!

this recipe is just to over done.first it is cooked way to long and with tons more butter than is needed. I used just enough butter to saute the beans and I only cooked them for about 5 to 7 minutes , this made them crisp and didnt rob them of any flavor. Instead of adding more dressing for a stronger taste, I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and then added mince garlic to taste I get the garlic already minced in the jar at the store. makes it really a great dish.

This was ok, but I'd never make it again. It did taste like green beans with salad dressing. I think it would be better cold (if you like cold bean salad).

I have to admit that I scoffed when my husband suggested making these.  Dumping Italian dressing on beans, that doesn't sound good.   They turned out great!  We both loved them.  I would guess the quality of the Italian dressing would have a lot with how this turns out.   We used Marsetti's Roasted Garlic Italian Vinegrette and fresh green beans from our garden.

good way to dress up green beans. i reduced the butter, used a balsamic vinagrette and reduced cooking time - seems they would be overdone if cooked that long. Turned out pretty good.

OMG!  This was soooo easy, and sooo tasty!  I will definately be making this on a regular basis!  Where it says let it cook for 25 minutes with the lid on, then remove and continue to cook, I didn't need to continue cooking it.  It was ready for the table.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

I'm not sure what went wrong...but my husband said it reminded him of eating "grasshoppers".  The beans were dried out even though there was sauce still in the pan.  Will not make this again.

This recipe was okay.  We eat green beans often so it was nice to switch it up but I definitely recommend reducing the amount of dressing.

I am not a green bean fan, but I really liked these.  My boyfriend, who DOES like green beans, didn't like them. I would use less butter next time.  It added for a little sogginess.

I prepared this dish as a side dish to a lasagna dinner, I just had to modify the type of green beans, as all of the store's that I went to had terrible looking green beans! I went with a frozen Italian-cut green bean, and only cooked them for about 10-15 minutes. Everyone at the table loved them! I could have handles a stronger flavor, actually, but hey, I'm just one voice of the eight at my dinner party! I only gave it four stars just because I didn't think they were exceptional, just pretty good.

I made this dish to go along side prime rib.  My husband and I thought it was OK, but not much different from just blanching the beans.  We used Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing and real butter.

Loved them!  Made them exactly as written with the exception of letting the dressing simmer for moment before adding in the green beans (as others suggested).  Such a quick & easy way to jazz up green beans and they went perfectly with the Bruschetta Chicken I made from this site.  Thank you for sharing!!

I want to start off by saying that green beans are not my favorite. I have been looking for a recipe that just really makes me say WOW that's a GOOD green bean. This recipe didn't do that for me. However, with that being said, if you LIKE green beans, I think this is a great idea : )

Yummy!  My two year old shoved these in his mouth by the handful (after I got him to actually open his mouth and taste them).  I used drained, canned green beans because they were on hand and about half the butter.  After bringing them to a boil, I just let them simmer, while I prepared the rest of our dinner.  I will definitley make again.  Hey, whatever it takes to make my two year old to eat something green!

I have never had vegetables as good as these.  I added no extra seasoning to them as the flavor was strong.  My whole family loved them.  I don't think I'll ever make green beans any other way ever again.

I thought these were really good.  I used the italian dressing from Olive Garden (which I got at Costco) and they were more than just beans with dressing on them.  Definitely depends on the quality of salad dressing you use.

Delicious!!!! I was in a hurry and looking for a quick recipe, I came across this one and it was more than what i was looking for in the best way possible, I am a very very picky eater and this just tickled my taste buds, I normally don't rate stuff but this needed to be rated.

This was a pleasant surprise.  I only used a tablespoon of butter though, and added some bell peppers and onions and a bit of garlic salt.  Really good, will make again!

Finger licking good! I normally sautee my green beans in garlic and olive oil (another great recipe!) but I didn't have any fresh garlic for it so I decided to look up a different way to sautee them (since its the only way I can eat them). So I tried this recipe! I didn't have any zesty Italian but I used Ceaser Vinaigrette instead along with a little garlic salt! It was DELICIOUS! I'll try them with zesty Italian next time. Also, a tip, blanching the green beans before you sautee them makes them come out JUST right. You can look up how to do that online, its pretty basic! Five Stars!

I really liked these green beans. I was in a pinch for a side dish and happened upon this recipe. It was a little bit greasy, but the taste was excellent. I will make again.

For the first time since I started using allrecipes, I am completely unimpressed by a recipe I chose... Partially because I didn't have a lot of time to find a recipe, so I didn't do the proper research.  This recipe called for far too much butter, and I used a quality Italian dressing but still the flavor was horrible.  The beans were practically burnt after 15 minutes.  This recipe needed more liquid and less butter.  I will not make it again.  The only reason I give it two stars is that my husband actually did like it.

These beans are shocking because they look like regular green beans but then they taste almost sour because you're not expecting it. To be fair, it may have been bad because I used Light Italian dressing...but I will not make this again.

took a LONG time to cook, and had a vinegar-y taste in the end. Maybe it was the dressing I used - Kraft fat-free italian.

These were pretty good, but I would definitely reduce the butter.  I think I will totally omit it next time (possibly just spray the pan).  Good flavor but a little greasy w/this much butter.  Will make again.

These were eh. The cook time was way too long - I cooked them for 15 minutes and they were overdone. To me, they just tasted like regular ol' string beans - maybe the dressing I used wasn't flavorful enough. I'd try them again with different dressing and a shorter cook time.

I used frozen green beans butter and a packet of italian dressing (powder).  I melted the butter and added the dressing then the thawed beans and cooked to  our liking (just till warm).  Not bad I would make this again.

Not impressed. Too much butter and just tasted like green beans in salad dressing. Might be better cold, but won't be making it again.

I marinated the green beans in the Italian dressing all day, then cooked them as the recipe directed, using only half the butter called for. Also added some minced garlic. We enjoyed the recipe.

Yum!  Thanks for the tasty and easy dish. Nice to have something to serve with lasagna other than salad.

Cooking Italian for dinner, I needed a side dish that I could literally whip together in minutes.  I used 2 cups of frozen green beans and a drizzle-drizzle-drizzle of Wishbone Romano Basil Vinaigrette in a Pyrex bowl covered with a Corningware luncheon plate. Microwave for 2 minutes, stir, microwave for 2 more minutes. Serve. Couldn't be easier, and no fat but for the oil in the dressing. Yes, it tastes like green beans in Italian dressing because THAT'S WHAT IT IS! But my family took about as much time to eat it as I did to make it, so it's all good. Thanks for the inspiration!

Eh...this was I don't know...disappointing. It was just off to me. Perhaps I would try it again with dry Italian powder and butter, but with liquid Italian dressing I didn't overly care for it and neither did anyone else. Sorry :(  Glad I tried it though :)

Super easy and great flavor.  I will be repeating this one!  I didn't use the 1/4 c. butter - instead I reduced it to 2 Tbsp and the green beans had great flavor, just the right amount of crunch and were delicious!

These green beans were edible but not great. It was fast and easy but tasted like pickled green beans. It sounded good but I won't be making these again.

Made just as recipe says using Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Midway through, I threw in 2 cups cooked chicken, but the bean would've been lovely on their own.  Excellent!

O so good.  I added some sliced onions and about a 1/4 teasp. minced garlic.  I would have added mushrooms if I had them. Another keeper.  Thanks John.

This was excellent! I will not use butter next time and the cooking time was off. I would say about 10 minutes instead of 25. I was looking for a green bean recipe that I already had the ingredients on hand and this was perfect. I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed someone else's suggestions and heated the dressing on the stove before I added the green beans.  I also added forthed cherry tomatoes.  Both the beans and the tomatoes came from our garden, so that made them extra yummy!

Usually these rating are dead on but maybe it was the Italian dressing I used but it was way too sweet and greasy. I only ate a bite. Caution...test on a few beans first. I used a Robust Italian Dressing. On my fingers tasted okay but not on beans.

Another wonderful way to use Italian dressing.  I don't quite understand the reviewer that said that all it tasted like was green beans and Italian dressing, seeing how that's what the recipe is.  I thought they were great.  The recipe used stuff I always have around, and was simple to make.  I reduced the amount of butter, and will probably leave it out next time.  I used fresh beans and cooked for ~15 minutes 'cause I like them tender-crisp.  Next time I'll put them in a serving dish after cooking since the last ones are VERY drippy with sauce.  I probably got my whole day's worth of veggies from this recipe.  Thanks!

My husband and I really loved this recipe and he's not a veggie eater.  I decreased the butter by half.  I leave them on the stove for our second helpings, so the beans overcook and start to crisp.  It really brings out the flavors of the dressing.  yum.

I was looking for a way to jazz up a can of green beans and this worked great! I eyeballed 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of italian dressing, then added a small can of beans. There was a lot of sauce left, but it still gave the beans a nice flavor- I will try it with fresh next time, but we loved it with canned!

This is great base recipe.  I used drained canned green beans, added a little minced garlic, seasoning salt, and sprinkled with parm cheese...and it turned out great.

This was a big hit served at a home bible study pot-luck.  It ended up being served luke warm, but everyone still loved it!  Added about 1/4c extra onion and deseeded the tomatoes.  Will make it again!

I'm sorry, I just didn't like this recipe and neither did my family. I had read the other reviews so I decided to cut the butter and dressing in half. They still came out very oily.

This was okay- I wasn't wild about the yellowish color the beans turned after cooking, and they were a little soggy. Next time I'll probably use less butter and more Italian as the taste was good, just not strong enough.
