Patrica, Thank you for posting this recipe. My Mom made this salad quite frequently during the summer when I was growing up. I have a tip for those making this recipe for the first time. Mix the sugar and cornstarch for the dressing together, add to your saucepan the and your wet ingredients. This will help avoid a lumpy dressing.
