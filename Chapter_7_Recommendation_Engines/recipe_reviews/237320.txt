Chef John's recipe is excellent! It is "Julia Child-esque" in its simple elegance and richness. 

Two firsts for me:

This recipe compelled me to write my first ever review (can't believe this recipe doesn't have one!) And...

This was my first time eating short ribs let alone cooking them. I am a chronic, habitual recipe tweaker, but this time I refrained. The only changes I made were the serving size--I cook for 2 and these are rather expensive--and I did do them in the crock pot. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and thickened the gravy a bit at the end with a flour slurry. The gravy is rich and delicious and had so much of it left over I froze for later. Served with scratch made mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots in a lemon chive butter.

Next time I plan to do them on a weekend and use the Dutch oven. I bet they'll be even better! (Also plan to use this recipe for a roast) Thanks Chef John!

If I could rate this 10 stars, I would.  Followed recipe exactly with the exception of the cooking time.  I added an extra hour in the dutch oven.  These were melt in your mouth, divine tasting and a huge hit at the dinner table.  Will definitely make again.

This is one of many of Chef John's recipes that I have tried and every time they are a winner.  This recipe is no different.  Bacon, onion and beef - what's not to love?!  I had never cooked with dry sherry before  (usually use regular wine) so that was new to me but the short ribs turned out perfect and very tasty.  Will be putting this one in my "keeper" recipe rotation.  Thanks again Chef John!  Keep the recipes coming!

I made this the other night and it was a big hit. Really, really goooood. I will mention that I learned braising meant cooking the meat in broth that only covers 1/2 way up the ribs. Otherwise, covering the ribs to the top or over is actually boiling it. 4 quarts of broth was too much. 2 quarts was perfect. But towards the end I did put the rest of the broth in because I threw in carrots and Yukon gold potatoes. I'm no expert but it worked well for me. The meat fell off the bones when I was transferring it. This recipe takes a long time but it was great.

I decided to make this too late in the day to have for dinner that night so after cooking for close to two hours I took the short ribs out and put them on a platter and the braising liquid in a bowl and refrigerated.  The next day all the fat came to the surface and I was easily able to de-fat and discard, then resumed braising til totally fork tender, maybe another half hour.  Served them with mashed potatoes and roasted carrot rounds and my family RAVED about them.  I highly recommend this two day process if you're trying to limit the fat in your diet.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe sounded so delicious that I went out immediately and got the ingredients to make it for Sunday dinner.   It wasn't cheap but the flavour and the way it made our house smell was reminiscent of Sunday family dinners when I was growing up.  I made it exactly as laid out in the recipe except I forgot to "bring ribs mixture to a simmer" before putting it in the oven.  For us, I think Chef John's timing worked better.  I left it in for the extra hour as several reviewers stated and it was fall off the bone delicious but we prefer ours still on the bone like he has it in the video.  We served it over homemade mashed potatoes with thyme roasted beets.  It was simple, straightforward, tasted unbelievable and SO worthy of company.  As Chef John says "Enjoy"......you will!

This is excellent.  My husband gave it 10 stars.  I live in Mexico and did not want my oven on that long so I put them in a crock pot and they turned out excellent.  I did not use all the broth as I did not want them to get like stew. I covered the meat about 1/2 way with broth.  I saved the additional broth and added it to the additional juices from cooking that I skimmed off during cooking  and put it in the refrigerator to let the grease harden.  Just before serving I brought all the juices to a boil and it was perfect.

My entire family went crazy for this meal. It was absolutely fantastic, I didn't change a thing to the recipe. Served ribs and sauce on a bed of mashed potatoes.  I can't believe how much my 2 year old ate. This will definitely be part of our dinner rotation.

This is another of Chef John's winning recipes, but please don't limit yourself to short ribs.  I have made this many times now with a chuck roast, tri-tip, and even a pork shoulder. Always awesome!

This was excellent!  I made it exactly as directed and it was the best I've ever tasted.  I asked my boyfriend what he would like for dinner for Valentine's Day and he said braised short ribs.  He then started telling me how to make them, and I decided I would use this recipe instead of one with a tomato base.  I'm glad I did!  afterwards, he told me that it was better than the dish that he usually got at his favorite restaurant up in San Francisco.  No doubt about it, this is restaurant quality.  
I did add some fingerling potatoes & carrots in the last half hour of cooking--and they were delicious!  I also added some mushrooms to the sauce and...yum!  Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely the best short ribs I've ever made.  I made this over two evenings, one to brown the ribs and make the sauce and the second one to cook in the oven.  They were so tender and delicious my husband asked my why I have never made them for him before.  I used the leftover ribs and sauce to make beef and noodles the next night.  Thank you chef John for a fabulous recipe!

John rocked it. Turned out perfect. I served this with Mac & cheese and topped all with baked kale crumbles. Well done John, thank you for sharing this with us.

I sort of combo'd this recipe with Chef John's Short Ribs Braised With Mushrooms and the dish came out AMAZING!   I was not able to find bone in beef ribs in any of 4 local grocery stores.    I settled on a 2 pound package of boneless ribs. Following Chef John's recommendation on the Sherry ribs, I browned them very well in some bacon fat.  I  drained and reserved the bacon, then set the ribs aside to drain on some paper towels.  I diced 2 medium onions and sauteed them with some minced garlic.  I added the 2 TBSP flour called for in the Sherry recipe as well as the bay leaf, cayenne  and rosemary from the mushroom recipe.  I de-glazed the pan with about a cup of port rather than the sherry.  Followed that with about 2 cups of beef broth and a can (14 oz) of tomato puree.  I added back the bacon and ribs and brought to a low boil. Rather than putting in the oven, I simmered on top of the stove in a cast iron dutch  oven with a tight lid for around 2- 2 1/2 hours.  I let it cool down and refrigerated over night.  The next day, I skimmed the fat that had solidified then simmered for another 2 hours or so on the stove.  I left the pot only about half covered to let the sauce reduce.  Served with mashed potatoes and butter braised brussels sprouts.   It was SOOOO good!   Since there are only 2 of us, we had plenty of lefties.  Even better left over with some candied carrots and white rice

This was definitely a keeper! Didn't change anything, except that I browned the ribs in the cast iron dutch oven (much easier to get them really brown) and didn't use all of the liquid.  After I had poured both the sherry and beef broth into the pot, the ribs were basically submerged. Knowing that with braising the meat should only be partially covered , I scooped out about 1 cup of the broth.  (To the person who said that this didn't have a lot of flavor, I am sure that is because the sauce was diluted from adding too much broth.)  Other than that--I  followed the recipe to the T.  It was delicious and even better the next night as leftovers!  Will be making this again! Thanks Chef John.

I've tried many short rib recipes and all have been great but this one tops the list.  I didn't have sherry wine but substituted it with marsala wine and it was fantastic. You've got to try this if your looking for a great short rib recipe! I love Chef John's recipes!

Great!  I used boneless beef short ribs.  I followed the recipe except, I didn't have any dry sherry.  I did have some very dry vermouth, so I used that mixed with some balsamic vinegar.  I served it with mashed cauliflower, honey baby carrots, Le Sueur sweet peas and Parker house style rolls.  Great autumn Sunday dinner!

Did everything exactly as stated and was very disappointed. It tastes like pot roast! I was expecting something that was salty, sweet and with flavor-this isn't it.

Absolutely delicious! This is a wonderful dish to make on a cold day; it warms up the kitchen and makes the house smell wonderful. I've made it several times, and the recipe is terrific as is. I have also made it with the following adjustments, and it is equally good:

Step 3: I omit the salt.
Step 5: Since there is quite a bit of fat from the bacon and the browning of the ribs, I remove a good deal of it before I add the onions.
Step 7: Sometimes I substitute red wine for the sherry. It gives a different flavor, but it is very, very good.
Step 8: I cook mine for three hours. Two hours just wasn't enough.

Such good flavor! Simple ingredients with an awesome result.  I served over mashed potatoes.  Perfect for starting on Sunday afternoon and enjoying a wonderful dinner with crispy dinner rolls and a nice salad.  10 star worthy.

Really good.  Takes longer to reduce the sauce than stated here.  You need to put some sort of vegetable (like carrots) in it at the end, or on the side.  Served it over polenta.

What a fabulous dish! My only change was to use low-sodium beef broth and reduce the dry sherry to 1/2 cup combined with 1/2 cup water. I also cooked everything in my Dutch oven, just removed the meat when it was time to cook the onion a such. Saved a little clean up time! I'm going to try this with a roast instead of short ribs next time. Update: My family noted that it was kind of oily last time I made it. So this time, I braised the short ribs and made the sauce, then refrigerated it overnight. The next day, I was able to easily scrape all the fat off the top, then pop it in the oven for three hours. Yummy, easy, and almost no grease!

I am one those people that has never made Short Ribs either. But will never quite now. This is such a wonderful and unique taste that I too can't give it enough stars. Oh and I never changed a thing except maybe added more of the wine and broth if needed. Thanks again John.

I would not change a thing about this recipe. The flavor is incredible and it is really so easy to make.
I served it with mashed potatoes. Perfect. I asked my husband what he wanted for dinner this weekend and he wanted the same recipe. (not  happening there is too much good stuff out there) A keeper.

Wow- just Wow!  I used 1-1/2# of ribs (for two people), cooked them for the same amount of time and the meat literally fell off the bones.  The recipe seemed a little labor intensive but every extra step was well worth the end result. The deep, rich, warm sauce was wonderful over Parmesan Roasted Potatoes, too.  This dish has become an requested favorite in our house. The only thing I might change is replacing the Sherry with Burgundy just out of curiosity.  Thanks, Chef John for another real winner.

As expected, Chef John delivers a delicious and easy, yet extravagant dish!  We had a little more than half the short ribs needed, and should have halved the sauce, but am glad we didn't, as it is sooo good with mashed potatoes (another of Chef John's easy recipes).  Yummm

This is a variation of bouef bourginoun but made with sherry instead of red wine. Followed the instructions but made the day before as to let the fat congeal overnight for easier removal. Short ribs tend to be fatty. It had good flavor but nothing to rave about. One thing some reviewers indicated was the saltiness of the dish - one of the basic rules of cooking is to taste while cooking so I don't understand why some people just keep adding salt without first trying whether it needs it or not. I felt adding mushrooms would enhance it.
All in all it was a pretty good dish, but not great in my opinion. I would not make it again.

So awesome as written. I tried few minor changes The 2nd time I made it (always tinkering), and may have brought it up to 6 stars.  I added chopped celery and carrot to the onion, added a couple splashes of worchestershire sauce, and increased the oven time an additional hour.  Served it over a mash of steamed cauliflower and rutabaga.  So good.

Mine turned out great! Excellent recipe and was a hit! One thing I will do next time is probably not add that last bit of salt just before putting in the oven.  I think seasoning the meat plus the bacon already being in there was enough for me. Still a great recipe. Took about an hour and a half for me so definitely do the fork test part-way through.

I had made these sherry beef short ribs just the other day and I am happy to say that they were just perfect to the taste.  I will always refer to this recipe when requested. My family enjoyed it so much.

Made them tonight and they were so tender they .
fell off the bone, no knife needed! Incredibly tasty, hearty cozy comfort food for a cool Fall evening! I enjoyed using the dry sherry, which I have never used before. A definite keeper recipe which I can't wait to try    again for company.

LMAO.... I keep trying to edit my comments but there’s an issue going on with the internet. New review....great base recipe but lacks flavor. I added parsley, more seasoning, three diced mushrooms and 1 cup of spinach to the onion mix. I had a lot of liquid over the ribs even though I simmered the Dutch oven extra to accommodate the extra water from the veggies. Changed the sherry to a Cabernet which was a way better complement to the meat. prep time is total BS. It took more like an hour+ depending on what you use. I made my broth from “better than bullion”, cleaned and diced my onions and garlic. Bacon takes about 12 minutes to cook. Caramelizing short ribs took roughly 20 mins alone. Prep and finally getting everything in the same pot took way over an hour so just be prepared. Perhaps the prep time is if you have everything lined up which I feel is unrealistic because that’s not how the recipe is written as the bacon and caramelizing alone are over 30 mins. I liked this recipe and chef John however this recipe was not what I expected.

Made this recipe as written, all most.  Even thou Chef John said don’t even think of using cooking sherry, that is all I had on hand so that is what I used.  The sauce was DELICIOUS!  Meat was so tender and great flavor. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots.  Thanks for the recipe Chef.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. First off, it takes two days to make this dish. You cannot eat it the first day because of all the grease from the short ribs. I had to take the ribs out of the sauce, seal them in foil, and put the sauce in the frig. There was a half inch of grease, that I removed before finishing the dish. I reheated the ribs, and boiled the sauce until it slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The meat was fatty, even though I purchased my short ribs from a butcher shop and they trimmed some of the fat off. I paid $10 a pound for beef short  ribs, it took me two days to make this dish, and it wasn't good. I will never make this dish again.

This is terrific!  I confess I dumped all the ingredients in a crockpot (minus the flour) and cooked on high for 4-5 hours and it came out amazing!  Removed meat, strained off the fat from the gravy, added the flour, and cooked it down on the stove when I got home from work.  Served with mashed potatoes (the gravy goes fantastic with it!) and mixed veg.  My 6, 4, & 3 year olds cleaned their plates!  Try this - it's a keeper.

I have made this recipe three times now, and each time it comes out to perfection - tender, juicy and flavorful.  It has been a hit with everyone I have shared it with and they think I am this amazing cook!  (I am, but that's beside the point! ??)
I made mushroom couscous as a base for the meat and gravy and served it with a nice Argentinian Malbec - pure perfection!

Made this tonight for 4th of July (after finding the ribs in my freezer from last November).  I followed the recipe exactly, only halved it as I had a little over two pounds of boneless short ribs.  They were perfectly fork tender after 1-1/2 hours.  I couldn't believe how thick the gravy got after ten minutes.  Served with baked potato and string beans almandine.  May put the leftovers over pasta or polenta.  Thank you, Chef John, for another excellent recipe.  My husband also thanks you!

Don't  change a thing. I operate  a scratch  kitchen  restaurant  in Cleveland. Chef John is my go to guy for  cooking  at  home. I had 12 pounds  of short  ribs. Doubled the recipe and slow  cooked  the rest of them in the same recipe smoked  them  outside for 2 hours. Now  it's a  Party. Thanks  Chef.

Absolutely fabulous!  We had some short ribs and needed a recipe for them and this really fit the bill!  Chef John never ceases to amaze me with his delicious recipes.  I did 50% the gravy/sauce(had 4 1/2 lbs. short ribs) because I wanted to make sure we had enough for mashed potatoes and leftovers and I'm so glad I did.  The gravy stands alone in it's own right, having left over gravy only makes for delicious next day over rice/pasta/mashed potatoes. Of course we will be making this again!  Bravo Chef John, bravo!  You know you're killing me right??

Chef John never disappoints with his recipes! Made this following recipe except for using bacon but I did use bacon fat to brown the ribs. This was outstanding and had such a rich flavor. I served the leftovers over egg noodles. Thank you so much!

This was a great recipe - I followed it exactly per instructions and the ribs came out delicious!  I made this for a family gathering and the recipe was requested several times.  I will definitely do this again but next time I make sure the quality of the ribs is better.  But even with a lower grade meat, it was fork tender and delicious!

I loved this. My husband and two toddlers loved this. I did the recipe as stated with an addition hour or two in the oven. The sauce was insane over rice. The meat fell off the bones. The taste was heavenly. Delicious

Chef John has done it again! Made these last night to the "T". Before I even put them in the oven I felt like I was in a restaurant with the aromas that were going on from the bacon and braising of the meat! My husband had a VERY hard time waiting the 2 hours for these to finish cooking in the oven but it was SO worth the wait! SO tender and flavorful. Every recipe I have tried of Chef John's has been the best I've ever had. He makes me look like a skilled Chef to my family! The aroma was still very strong and enticing when I woke up in the morning, making me realize that this is definitely one of my top 3 favorite recipes! Thanks a million Chef John!

Excellent! Do not change a thing! Made as written, which is hard for me to do.  First shot at making short ribs. I have made this twice now and wonderful both times.  Actually did change one thing, cooked 2 1/2 hours both times because we had 4 1/2 pounds of meat to make 6 ribs. Meat is so tender and the rich flavor is awesome! Thank you Chef John for sharing!

I followed directions exactly and my family loved it! I served it with two side dishes: roasted sweet potato fries and roasted cauliflower with parmesan cheese. If you are a new cook, don't feel intimidated. This recipe was easy to follow. Also, I love my beautiful red dutch oven, $50 from Walmart. Thank you, Chef John! Can't wait to check out your other recipes.

Update: I made it again and everyone loved it!

This was very good! It was the first time I cook short ribs in this way. I am used to stew them as we do in my country which is more like making a soup with it. I really liked it all! The only change I would do next time is to lower the salt. While cooking, I had forgotten that my dry sherry cooking wine already had a bit of salt. I am quite sensitive to sodium contents in any food. I recomment to cook this recipe as is. This is a keeper.

I made this for dinner guests and there were rave reviews all around. I stuck to the recipe with no substitutions. The only change was doubling the oven time to 4 hours after reading another review. Perfection! This is definitely going to be a go-to! Chef John rocks!

We really enjoyed this dish. I added some baby carrots and they were delicious. I also sautéed some baby Bella mushrooms in the Sherry and added these to the thickened sauce as a last step.

We had this for Christmas. Started w/ Edna Lewis' Shrimp Grits. Sides were Creamed Spinach and Truffle Mac N' Cheese. Plus mini-croissant, Apple Pie a la mode. My daughter was my sous chef. Electric oven>"janky". Preheated @ 500° for 1 hr. Used bacon, onion powder, sherry, flour, Lawry's Season Salt, Better than Bouillon, minced garlic, had to crush some black cracked pepper. Forgot thyme & bay leaf. Added dried thyme and 2 bay leaves 1 hr. after went in oven. Turned down to 350° at same time. Still tough at 2 hrs. Done after another 45-50 min. So tender. The meal was GREAT!! Will be making ALL of this again. Oh, we had St. Germain with it. Yum!

Followed to the letter (almost). Only had dried thyme and left in a little longer due to errands.  Awesome and wish I could give more stars.

Made these and they were very good.  I did not change anything other than like some reviewers I took two days to do this.  These had a deep beef taste along with the sherry.  My only complaint is that it is a lot of time for so little meat.  You need to plan for at least two ribs per person.

This is my go-to recipe for short ribs. I sometimes don’t use bacon and just brown the ribs in vegetable oil and the gravy is usually thick enough when it comes out of the oven so I just strain it. These are melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the gravy is amazing!

Another hit from Chef John. This was absolutely outstanding and will definitely go into the rotation. My husband is about to fall asleep from a food coma as a very happy man haha. I made it exactly as written and it was divine as is, but will make a few small tweaks for my personal taste in the future. One, I’ll only pepper the ribs as I found the sauce to be a bit too salty (again, to my taste) and I will either drain off some of the bacon grease before cooking the onions or I will cook and then chill the sauce overnight to defat it and then resume braising. I found the gravy to be too greasy, but the taste was fabulous. It didn’t stop me from having seconds regardless. It was a long time in the kitchen for a weeknight, but it was well worth the effort. I wouldn’t mind trying this in the future with the slow cooker as others have done to save time. Try it, you won’t be disappointed!

Chef John recipes are almost always a hit at my house.  I deleted the flour as I am Keto--but added some xanthum gum to thicken slightly and to keep it Keto!!!

As an absolute beginner making short ribs for the first time, I wish I knew these couple things before even embarking on this recipe. 
1) Make sure to buy ribs that actually have adequate amount of MEAT on them! Sounds like a 'DUH!' moment, but I really did not know what the cuts of meat would look like. (The cuts of ribs I got were so fatty, I felt like I paid for fat and bones only!!) 
Which leads me to the next point..
2) Be aware that it will be VERY smoky when frying that short rib in the saucepan! There was soooooo much fat that came off the bone, I had a POOL of oil in the pan which made my house look like it was on fire. lol. 
3) Short ribs are expensive!! Spending $50 on ribs with barely any meat on it is ridiculous!

I did end up following the recipe exactly, and would have to say the ONLY thing I liked about it was the gravy it made in the end. That was very delicious! (Although, I will have to refrigerate the sauce to skim off the ridiculous amount of fat on top of it). I don't plan to make this recipe again, but I do feel like I learned some valuable cooking experiences! For those that are skilled cooks, this is probably right up your alley. :)

I decide to make this in the Instant Pot and it turned out perfectly. Preheat the Instant Pot to the "Saute" option.Season your short ribs with salt and pepper. Saute bacon until crisp.  remove bacon and brown short ribs in bacon drippings. Follow the rest of the recipe...except...do not add flour mixture. Cook on high pressure for 35 minutes and then use natural release method. After releasing, create a slurry with 2 tbsp of corn starch and 2 tbsp of water and add it to the liquid while stirring constantly to thicken.

It was OK, and that was my fault likely because I used the slow cooker because I couldn't be around while the oven was on and I needed to prep it earlier. The flavor was great in the gravy/sauce, but the short ribs weren't fall-apart as I usually get with that cut. I liked that they weren't dredged in flour (for calories and wheat avoidance). Just wasn't a big hit with the family like the last time I made them with a different recipe.

It was really good! I was looking for a recipe to use sherry since I had opera bottle for another recipe, and this one was a winner! I did substitute a boneless chuck shoulder steak (thin cut, about 3 pounds total). Otherwise I followed the director and served it with garlic mashed potatoes & cauliflower and salad. The reduced sauce was a little salty, so just be careful.

This was an excellent meal, which I made for my honey for Valentine's Day 2019.  He loved it!  (and he loves me, too!).  

I like my meat, not just "fork tender" but "falling off the bone tender"....(chicken, turkey, beef, you name it.... gotta fall off the bone!).  So I cooked these for well over 2 hours, almost 3. They were excellent.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I paired it with parmesan polenta.  Not only was it decadent with the rich gravy, it was beautiful to behold!  Definitely not my mother's short ribs!!  Happy Valentine's Day!

I didn't have all of the beef broth or sherry that it called for, so I used what I had. It still turned out amazing. 

My wife made mashed cauliflower and asparagus for sides and we had a remarkable dinner.

This was at the top of the list of the best things I've ever eaten. The meat melted in your mouth. Very rich so choose your side carefully. People at my table were dropping forks and raving. followed recipe exactly. The gravy reduction is worth bottling. When the meat was all gone I didn't want to throw it away. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Colorful recipe. This base is great to do things to if changes need to be made due to lack of ingredients! Very good taste!

This is my go-short ribs!!  Always met with rave reviews.  I do cut the sherry with a little bit of red wine though.  But I’ve made it without the wine and it’s still fabulous

Wonderful recipe! I first made this exactly as instructed and it was delicious, tender and given 5 stars by my guests. I decided to try to reduce the fat content by caramelizing the ribs on a hot grill while cooking the rest of the ingredients in the Dutch oven.  Before reducing the gravy in the final step, I used a fat separator to eliminate the grease but retain the yummy juices and the bacon/onion pieces. The result was as tender and tasty as the original with less kitchen splatter and fat. I just served it this with mashed potatoes and marmalade carrots  to  more friends who raved about the meal.  A 5-star winner!

I love this recipe and usually make it as written except I cook it all in one pan! My LeCruset Dutch oven works great for the whole process with less to clean up! I serve these over creamy, cheesy grits that I make in the crockpot, while the ribs are cooking in the oven, best short ribs ever!

Being a Chef myself i have always admired Chef John's recipes. This is basically the same recipe i use except i use 2 cups of Bisto Beef Gravy Granules. You can order it on Amazon. I serve it with Roasted Garlic mashed potatoes. It adds an extra hearty beef flavor that is still smooth & pleasant.

I am still a fairly new cook, so this was a little bit of a challenge. I followed the recipe to a T. It turned out awesome! I served it with my own smashed potatoes & asparagus. I will make again for my dad when he comes. Thank you Chef John!

Very simple and flavorful. Easy to put together.  Make sure you get a deep sear on your ribs. They are fall off the bone tender. I'm going to try this recipe with a roast and see how it turns out.

This was one of the best dutch oven recipes we've tried to date. I did modify a couple things: doubled the bacon amount- we love bacon! We cooked the whole thing in one dutch oven pot. Browned the bacon, removed to plate with paper towel, browned the ribs, moved to same plate. Removed some of the bacon grease from the pot with paper towels, then sauted the onions and garlic : followed the recipe word for word from there. House STILL smells like heaven the next morning!!!

Substitutions by necessity and cooked in slow cooker. 
Fantastic recipe and process, the results were outstanding. I did modify but only for the purpose of using what ingredients I had on hand in our Chinese American household. Instead of Sherry I used shaoxing cooking wine, instead of bacon I used butter. No Bay leaf so I used oregano. No floor so used cornstarch. After browning I could on slow cooker for 5 hours on high then 1 hour on low. Served with mashed cauliflower, just outstanding!

Wonderful recipe!! I believe it was a bit too much beef broth. However I am reluctant to reduce as the meat was so juicy and not dry at all. It's a keeper for sure. It's a  bit time consuming, but surely worth the effort.

Tastes more like a fatty, bacony pot-roast. If you're expecting something sweet and tangy and "rib-like", this is not your dish. Prep time takes longer than stated. The meat tastes bland and doesn't take any flavor of the mixture it's put in; not to say the mixture has much to offer. The mixture tasted more like a fatty, gamey bacon. Will not cook again.

Once again Chef John presents a fool proof recipe that assures the successful results of a delicious Sherry Braised Short Ribs dinner. I added the complete mirepoix (adding 3 sliced carrots and 3 sliced celery stalks), and served it over some jasmine rice. Thanks again Chef John!

I made it as is ... no changes, except I extended baking time to 3 hours.  Absolutley delicious.  I think next time I will bake at 300 degrees for 3 hours. And the next time after that ... adjust liquids for my Instant Pot.  And the next time after that .... 

These short ribs were a big hit in my family!

This is a Good recipe, my dish came out perfect, i wished it had more flavor. Meet was so  tender, you could  cut it with a fork. I salted the heck out of the meat. And the bacon bits and oinion's. Next time i will put my own Spices and that will make the meat really POP !

Absolutely delicious! We don’t eat pork, so I browned the short ribs using oil and brown sugar, and it gives the meat a great caramel flavor.

Added more garlic just because I love garlic ...used more than suggested amount of short ribs (they cook down so glad I did), & I added fresh sliced mushrooms; I didn't have fresh thyme, so used dried, & did what others suggested & thickened sauce when meat was done.  First time cooking short ribs...this recipe is a keeper...had only a very few left when dinner was done.  Rated it 5 as I really didn't change the basics of the original recipe.

I'm sorry - I normally agree with the reviews in Allrecipes, but this one made my family and me very sick.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  The thyme was overpowering and the bacon grease - flour - sherry combination made the "sauce" nauseating.  I believe that less is more when it comes to beef, however, I went out on a limb and tried this.  Very disappointed.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent! I made sure to spoon off the fat at the top. The Sherry was a great flavor. Next time I'm going to try adding the mushrooms from one of Chiefs John's other recipes. Oh, I did add a few small cut carrots. Perfect over mash potatoes. "Lady D"

The only problem with this recipe is my wife is always requesting I make it. So delicious! I do cook them in a Crock-Pot. A warning though, braising the beef will smoke up the house, be sure to open some windows.

I made this recipe twice, exactly as shown, and it was fabulous.  Each time I made this it was for a New Year's Eve dinner and our company loved it.  I found you have to really spend some time up front with the browning to be sure the ribs are browned enough but then, the work is basically all done.  Being able to have the meal braising for at least a couple of hours gives you time to get everything else done and the meal is ready & waiting when your guests come.   We really enjoy it.

Delicious. I didn’t have sherry so I used dry white wine with a little brown sugar instead. (I read online this is a good substitute). I also added about an hour cooking time in the oven. Big hit with the whole family.

Really tender and had a good flavor. A little fatty though. I would make it again. I paired it with mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans & carrots.

Update: We made this a second time using merlot instead of sherry, and it was even better!  Excellent recipe!
Original review:
I made this recipe as written. It's quite delicious. It took me about an hour to get it in the oven, and we served it over mashed potatoes along with a salad. My husband and I agreed that next time we would try a recipe that called for red wine instead of sherry. We bought a nice bottle of sherry and finished it off by making cocktails of sherry and lemonade. Delicious!

I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars not based upon flavor, but based upon time discrepancies. First, 20 minutes of prep is wrong. Searing the ribs on "all sides" is the main culprit. Plan an hour to get everything done and your dutch oven into the oven Second, cook time in the oven was a solid 2:30 to get my ribs to fork tender. Lastly, I added an extra piece of bacon, two extra cloves of garlic and an extra onion.  It was my first time making short ribs and the result was excellent.  I'll be making these again.

This was delicious and relatively easy to make.  Only modifications I used were an extra piece of bacon, some extra thyme, and added some carrots.  i also removed the bone and chopped the meat.

a new arrow in my quiver.

I love love Chef Johns recipes! This is the first review I’ve written ever!! His recipes are so good that I have a separate folder for all of his recipes. This one was so easy to make and I served it with mashed potatoes and oven roasted Brussels sprouts for Christmas Eve!! Thanks Chef John.

Outstanding recipe - very easy to make and makes the house smell wonderful.  I only added a few dashes of hot sauce before putting it in the oven - otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Definitely a keeper in the weekend rotation.

AMAZING! The gravy developed such richness in flavor without a drop of butter and very little effort. I only strayed by cooking everything in the dutch oven as opposed to using a pan to brown and such. One less thing to wash and I can’t imagine this turning out any better due to a second dirty pan. The beef was tender but still had a meat texture and although my wife wasn’t thrilled with the fat she had on her pieces, I found the fat to be wonderful so gladly ate hers. This is a lick your plate clean recipe for sure. Thanks for passing along Chef John!

Made this today for a special occasion, and it was FABULOUS!! Followed directions exactly, and it turned out perfectly (like all of Chef John’s recipes).  Served with mashed potatoes, broccoli and cauliflower.  Loved by adults and kids of all ages!  The gravy is delicious on the potatoes. Will try with  polenta or grits next time. Thanks Chef John!!

Followed the recipe without making changes.  The meat was tender as I expected with braised beef but I was disappointed with the lack of any special flavor.  I had anticipated a dish that would knock my sock off but found nothing special about this recipe.  My expectations are always high when I cook and this was not my favorite.

I talked myself into overlooking the negative reviews but it turns out they were spot on.  This was so greasy and did taste like pot roast.  I won't make it again.

BEST short rib recipe I’ve ever eaten in my life (at home AND in restaurants)!!! There are no recipes by Chef John that I’ve made that I haven’t enjoyed. I’ve made this recipe three times now, and shared it with two others that gave it rave reviews! We served it over garlic mashed potatoes...SO good!!!

this is an amazing way to enjoy beef spare ribs.  The only thing I changed was adding the bacon at the end, still crispy to the gravy.  The ribs are already so rich that next time I will skip the bacon, it just didn't add anything to the dish, other than more saturated fat.  Wonderful dish!

I made this exactly per the recipe, but did cut down on the sherry a little, which turned out to be a good thing.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE sherry!  Glug! Glug!  But it somewhat overpowered the flavor of the beef, and my husband did not care for it.  He wanted to taste the beef ribs.  The flavor decreased somewhat as they cooled, but the next time, I will use maybe a little less than half the sherry called for in the recipe.  Otherwise, they were yummy!

The ribs were on sale so I looked for a recipe once they were in my cart.  Got home too late to make them that night, so I seasoned them with salt and pepper overnight. Next day I followed the recipe as written, since this was my first time cooking beef ribs. Amazing.  Guest worthy.  Won't change a thing next time.  My husband says this one is a winner!

This was fantastic as are most of Chef John's recipes. Did not have any sherry so I used red vermouth. Used slow cooker on high for 2 1/2 hours. Meat was very tender and gravy was rich and tasty.  Was able to skim some fat after cooking.  I will make this again for sure and will try adding celery and a few carrots an hour before completion. Served over mashed potatoes.

I used half the amount of meat, since there were only 4 of us, and kept everything else the same.  My guests, and picky hubby loved the dish.

Chef John is  an amazing cook.  I have never had one of his recipes fail me.  This Sherry Braised Short Ribs is no exception.  So delicious!  The short ribs I found on sale were boneless but they were  still incredible.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  Love you Chef John!

Pretty good. I enjoyed, but Hubby-not so much. Followed directions exactly except used dried thyme. Easy to make, sauce is good, just not anything that wowed us. He said he preferred a simple roast.

Wow, this is good stuff! I don't own a Dutch oven, per se, so used my copper-bottomed stock pot instead. Possibly because of the shape, there was way too much liquid in the recipe for use in a braise. No matter, I'Ve saved it (and the roasted bones) to use for soup starter.

Amazing ! Served over mashed potatoes. Seasoned ribs with pepper and Tony sasheries seasoning omitting the salt. When done baking I thickened the sauce into a gravy consistency. I also used thick cut bacon which was amazing with every bite. My husband loved this one ! Tons of flavor. Super easy recipe to follow

It's a keeper. Used day-old bacon fat and iron skillet to caramelize beef and sauté onion & garlic, then completed in stockpot - oven is unnecessary. Sauce may require more thickening (with cornstarch vs flour). Also, no matter how lean the ribs, there may still be a lot of rendered fat; make the day before. Add mushrooms.

I love Chef John's recipes but will stick to making his Beef Burgundy or Coq Au Vin next time.  This was disappointing for the amount of work it took!  It tasted like pot roast, a very expensive pot roast.  Followed directions exactly, don't get me wrong, it was good but not amazing like the other reviews indicate.  I won't make it again.

Followed the steps initially.  Didn't have enough sherry to deglaze, to threw in some apple cider and mango juice.  Put it all in a crock pot on low for 6-8 hours.  Fall off the bone.  We loved it!

No changes. Made it exactly as listed and it was amazing! I have used recipes for short ribs that always called for tomato paste and usually red wine and that is a great version too. But we really enjoyed this recipe more. It had a depth of flavor and great balance.

Now, only because I had a chuck   roast, I used that. And because of my job, cooked it in the crock pot. Beyond yummy!! I always heard if you can't drink it, don't cook with it and I used cooking sherry. Oh yuck, but to save that sauce, I added more thyme leaves, some more black pepper and a little sugar. It fixed that odd taste from cooking sherry. This is a keeper!! Delicious, simple and versatile with various cuts of beef

I made these a day ahead following the recipe exactly. Reheated them for our dinner party and they were absolutely delicious. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again!

First class! I made a few minor adjustments - first I used pancetta instead of bacon, because we had some on hand that was needing to be used up. Second, I had a jar of demi glaze on hand that we had picked up awhile ago, so I mixed that with 1 quart of water and just kept tasting it until it got to a nice beefy taste - not to weak, but not overpowering. Because of this, I did not add ANY salt whatsoever. I find that you can always add if needed, but you can't take away once it's in there, and we didn't need to add any to suit our tastes. The beef short ribs were so tender and delicious, and the "gravy" was fabulous over mashed potatoes. We served this with honey roasted carrots on the side. It was a five star dinner, for sure. I can't wait to make this again for guests.! Thanks Chef John!

I've never been a short rib fan until today.  I followed he recipe as written (for a change) and will do so in the future.  

Some notes:  
1)  Extended cooking time to 3 hours (Denver altitude correction).  
2)  Didn't serve enough rice -- should have doubled our normal serving.  
3) These are rich, not greasy.  There is a difference.
4)  My thyme plant looks like it went to the punk barber.  Don't skimp on the thyme.

The recipe was very easy to follow and it made it's way to the oven quickly.  I think I would have enjoyed it more had I used red wine instead of the sherry.  My only real complaint was the high level of salt. I followed his instructions and salted the meat liberally. Maybe I followed the instructions too well.  Chef John has never failed me before. I think it's just a matter of personal taste.

I really wanted to love this.  Disclaimer, it was my first time making short ribs. They turned out tender, but a little bland. I followed recipe exactly other than after cooking, I cooled them, removed the fat, then heated up for dinner. They were good, but not crazy good. The next day, they were a little better.  High points for the recipe being easy to do for this newbie!

Awesome recipe. I was a bit worried because of the strong flavor of the Sherry but when mixed with the beef broth and reducing it for gravy...man, this was good!!

Fabulous! Recipe was easy to follow and  I made no substitutions.  I cooked the ribs in a slow cooker since I did not have a dutch over.  Rave reviews from all age groups.

I've made this recipe every Christmas for the last 3 years-The only thing i've changed were the portions and added some home made spicy pimento paste, they keep getting bigger and bigger every year. This year I'm cooking for 30 and adding a mushroom risotto as a side dish! Well done cheff John

So savory and tender--great comfort food suitable for company.  As shown in the video (http://allrecipes.com/video/3974/sherry-braised-beef-short-ribs/), no need to bother stripping the thyme leaves--just lay the entire sprigs on top of the ribs.  I served it with a side of barley cooked in beef broth and paired with a Sonoma County merlot.  Delicious!

This was great. My husband loved this meal had seconds or thirds couldn't keep track. Asked me to make it again... gladly super easy dinner time. Made the house smell awesome :) Served it with some rolls, mashed potatoes, and a froz veg. 

Made a couple changes. Used Pinot Noir/red wine instead of Sherry. Used thyme leaves instead of fresh herbes.... just what I had on hand. Subbed half the beef broth for water accidently didn't have enough... didn't seem to affect the flavor. Used pork ribs instead of beef - was on sale. Last, I reduced the sauce but seemed thin so added a bit of cornstarch and it became a amazing gravy to pour over everything. 

Seemed easier - instead of using two pans I cooked everything as written in my dutch oven on the stove, just removing it to a plate while other things cooked then put it back in the dutch oven and then finished 2 hrs and about 20 minutes in the oven until it was fall off the bone tender - less dishes that way.

I don't have a Dutch oven so I cooked in a crock pot. I did brown the meat first. The meat was a little dry and I just thought the flavor was OK.  Won't make again.

Chef John you did it again!  I followed along exactly, except I did everything all in the one pot.  Just bought my Enameled  Cast Iron Skillet/Oven and christened it with this recipe.  It came out perfect!  I will certainly make it again.

I think this is one of my favorite Chef John recipes yet.  The meat was succulent and the taste was fantastic. I did skim fat off the top before serving but it was great over home made mashed potatoes. I served it with roasted root vegetables (carrots, celery and onions) since I had the oven going anyway! Just put them on a baking sheet after tossing in a little evoo and hit it with some salt and pepper. Delicioso!

My husband really liked this. I doubled the recipe because I had 7 pounds of short ribs. After browning the ribs  I reserved the drippings as the recipe directs. Big mistake. The sauce was way too greasy. Will definitely drain the fat before adding flour to the onions if I make this again.

I made it as the recipe except I only had sweet sherry, and I used rib steaks, but it turned out great. My husband said it was the best beef he'd had since we moved to Spain from England ( six years )
Thanks Chef John

Through no fault of Chef John's recipe, my first attempt at this recipe was a flop....my short ribs were greasy and fatty.  I was kind of bummed out, cuz I really liked the flavors.  When I read some of the reviews, one reviewer suggested chuck roast...well, I tried it and it came out fabulous.

OK here's the deal...this is a very flavorful delicious recipe.  I'd never had short ribs before so this was my first undertaking.  What I have discovered is I don't care for short ribs...too fatty.  The little pieces of meat that I was able to find amongst the fat were yummy.  And the gravy I could eat with a spoon.  I'm wondering if I can make this with a leaner cut of beef.  My husband  who has no fat phobia absolutely loved them.  He said it reminded him of his years stationed in Germany.

Made this last week, and it was spectacular! Just my husband and I, but went all out and sat a formal table with candles, cloth napkins , best dishes, etc. plus a good wine!  This is really a fine dining meal!  Served it with mashed gold potatoes, sautéed haricot verts, and freshly made bread.. so worth the extra effort, and the meat was so tender and succulent......good enough to impress company as well, and would make a nice elegant dinner for 4

Love it just the way it is. Agree with poster that would like to give it a ten. Likewise, I cooked-e it longer, unintentional, but it tolerated this well. Reheated it once more, It could be  a crock pot dish.

Ribs because that was what I had, but other than that followed directions as explained.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is really good and really easy.  Only change I made was using beef broth instead of sherry.

Made this last night. It was delicious!!! Will definitely make again. Because I made it on a weeknight, I didn't have time to let the sauce reduce at the end. Next time, I'll make this on a weekend night, when I can start it earlier. Even without the sauce reducing, it still tasted great, my husband couldn't get enough of it.

This is a savory dish and one my husband really enjoyed. I used a burgundy wine instead of sherry,dredged my ribs &browned them. Everything was browned in my dutch oven & then placed in the oven at 325 for 2 1/2 hours

Hard to mess these guys up! Just as the description said, as long as you caramelize correctly. Make sure to taste as you go along! I ended up replacing the Sherry with a whole bottle of Yuengling, oops. I used about one a half times the flour and maybe twice the garlic. I could've drank the mixture before it even went into the oven it was so good!

First time rating a  recipe and wish I could give this one more than 5 stars! Followed the directions exactly with the exception of the cooking time (added 1 hour). We loved them just sorry that I didn't double the recipe!! Definitely a keeper!

I'm a big fan of Chef' John but I was a little disappointed with this.  For one thing, they were pretty fatty, as short ribs tend to be I think.  I tried to skim fat but if I made them again I might do as many suggest and chill them overnight, remove the solidified fat, then reheat.  I think it's the nature of the beast with short ribs.

These were the most delicious short ribs I have ever had! I made them almost exactly according to the recipe, except I used sweet red wine instead of sherry & cooked them for 2 1/2 hours. The prep time took much longer than shown. I would definitely make them again.

As good as anything you will find in a great restaurant - perfect for a cold winter's night.  For an even deeper flavor profile substitute a tawny port for the sherry.

Was delicious.  For those that said it reminded them of pot roast it maybe more the cut of meat than the recipe.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was cooked for the 3 hrs then refrigerated, the next day took the pan out and skimmed the fat off and then put back in the oven for another hour.  Waiting until the next day got rid of most the fat, plus the flavors "ripened or melded".  The only thing I would change is to use less salt.  Have not tried, as or yet, a recipe from Chef John that wasn't good

Turned out fantastic. 
Had it over mashed potatoes with a mango-walnut salad (by Sara..on this site).  
The quality of the flavors surprised even me...I love it when that happens!

I really liked the technique. It taught me some stuff.  
The seer (#4) appears to be very important to how this turns out.  
I skipped the bayleaf...I'm not a fan and thought it would make it "taste like a roast".
I also skipped the last step (#9) by taking the lid off during the last hour in the oven and turning the ribs every 15 minutes.
I will put this in my private favorites and make it again soon.

Followed this recipe exactly except that I used regular sherry in lieu of dry sherry, and I had a lot more juices than shown in the video so I had to add an extra tablespoon of flour for the gravy.It really turned out good and I will definitely make it again.

Fabulous! Used half the ribs for just 2 people but left the rest unaltered to make enough sauce to put over noodles. Added a container of baby Bella mushrooms along with the onions and an extra Tbsp of flour since shrooms give off some liquid. Shredded the rib meat and served over egg noodles--any wide noodle such as pappardelle would also be  delicious--with lots of sauce. So good!

These ribs were very tender and have great flavor, however, I didn't wind up with the gravy that shows in the picture, or is stated in the recipe.  I would make it again.   I tried to follow the advice of not cooking long enough, and may have cooked too long as a result.

VERY GOOD I really liked this it was good. It is Easy to prepare and FAST but the mess is the clean up because of the bacon., I hate cooking bacon in the house. So pick your day, it's easy , but it's bacon., that being said, I will make again. I made as written and wouldn't change it. Only used 2 Ib. Ribs and was cooked in 2  hours.. I wouldn't have gone any further. Lots of  excellent sauce left, not greasy at all. I am going to buy a roast and just put both in slow cooker on a busy day. BONUS

Loved this! The only change to the recipe I made was to remove most of the fat from the bacon and ribs after sautéing the onions and garlic but before adding in the flour simply because of preference. There was over an inch of oil and I know I just don't deal well with really high fats in a dish. I left just enough for a roux, it may have just been the cuts I was using. I added broth up about half way on the ribs which was less than the recipe but I think that was because of the size of my Dutch oven. I was scared I was taking out a lot of flavor but it was amazing  and I did not have to do the final step to reduce the sauce, perfect gravy. After 2 1/2 hours they were perfect. I just let everything sit in the covered Dutch oven while I prepped the sides. So good!

Don't have a Dutch oven, so baked it with a covered saute pan.  Followed recipe exactly except thickened sauce with flour/water mixture at the end to speed process a little.  Guests raved about it and even asked for the recipe!

DELICIOUS! Read many of the reviews and opted to follow the recipe as is and they turned out perfect! I did a trial run before Christmas dinner because frankly I don't cook very often. There were no leftovers, and a few more added to the guest list for Christmas dinner. If I can make them TWICE anyone can make them.

These are absolutely delicious; so good that we used a spoon to eat ALL the gravy from the Dutch oven. Off the chain good and we will make again.

We made this but use a crockpot on low for 10 hours. It was pretty good but I missed the blacken, salty, surface. The meat was very tender and represented a good braise. About four hours before eating, we added carrots and potatoes to the crockpot. These also came out great! All in all, it was a good meal. Maybe next time we make it, we will put it on high for about four hours and use more salt to see if that improves the surface.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I LOVE salt but ... I wold say, be careful the salt, as chef John states. I ended up with it a bit too salty. I would say between the salt in the bacon, and the salt in the beef broth you only need to moderately season your short ribs. That's just my opinion. But again, amazing recipe. Also, do try to skim off the fat. There is a lot of fat from the bacon.

The flavour is great but it was too greasy... If I make it again, I would most likely use Olive oil in lieu of bacon grease.

After mixed reviews on the flavor I decided to add a pinch of brown sugar to avoid the meat from tasting like regular pot roast.   Turned out great!

These short ribs are awesome! The first time I made them, I had all the ingredients. I thought I was in a fancy restaurant! This time I made them, I had everything but the sherry. I substituted chicken stock, and they turned out superb! This has become another of my favorites.

Really fantastic! My family request a repeat soon after making this! Definitely a keeper. No modifications needed, but I made these out of necessity. I didn't have a dutch oven so I used a deep stainless steel skillet. I halved all the ingredients including the beef broth and sherry. Instead of fresh thyme I used about 1/2 teaspoon of dried. Again really fantastic! Will definitely be making again.

My parents, husband and son loved this dish. I used boneless short ribs (slightly more than 3 1/2 lbs) and bought a good quality dry cherry. Following what other reviewers said, I used low sodium beef broth and did not add salt other than prior to browning the meat. It took 3 hours not 2 hours for my meat to be fork tender. I also reduced the sauce for about 15 minutes and sprinkled some chopped chives prior to serving. Another thing I did with about half the sauce, after it was reduced, was to press it through a strainer because I dont like too many soft pieces of bacon (I am a crispy bacon lover) in my sauces.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. One last thing, I added a tiny bit of smoked paprika (maybe 1/4 tsp) and turmeric (maybe 1/8+tsp) to the beef broth prior to pouring it  over the meat and placing it in the oven.

Fantastic recipe, as usual.  I did not have sherry and it is Sunday; so could not buy alcohol until after noon.  Did not want to wait that long to cook; so I used half a cup of some really good cognac.  It was delicious!   Though will use the sherry next time.  This makes a lot of food -- yum, yum, yum!!!  So, I added some carrots, celery and mushrooms to the onions to  add more flavor and an extra clove of garlic because garlic is my  friend.  This was really delicious.

I've made a lot of braised short ribs and brisket, etc.  These were among the best. Followed recipe, except added a handful of celery and carrots to the meat/liquid, because I had some to get rid of.  Served with mashed potatoes.  These were great!  I will probably try the same recipe, only with brisket, as I think that will also be very good.

I have made these twice now and will make again next week for company.
Fantastic restaurant quality recipe!
I plate it with mounded mashies with steamed veggies laid on one side, place a rib on the other side and then pour the fragrant sauce all over it.
They literally lick the plate!
Excellent, Chef John!

Broke in my new enamel coated cast iron Dutch oven with this recipe. I did change only two items. Since I was cooking for just myself I used 4 short ribs (about 1 & 1/4lbs) and used dried thyme since I did not have fresh. I boiled the sauce but it did not get real thick and I was afraid it would break so I stopped boiling it at 12 min. Very flavorful and tender.

Baked it for 2 hours and it was just right. Even though the sauce reduced in the oven it was still thin. Next time I might try a little more flour. I don't want to reduce the liquid or the ribs will possibly dry out.

Cooking in a Dutch oven is great. What I thought was burned on came off without soaking. I am going to use this more often (even though it weighs a ton).

These Braised Short Ribs were excellent! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of not having any sherry on hand so I substituted 1/2 vermouth and 1/2 brandy). I was afraid the sauce was going to need more seasoning, but it was perfect!

This has got to be one of the best from allrecipes website.  Flavor is perfect and it melts in your mouth. I quick sear the beef on the BBQ to lock in the moisture.  Extra time cooking in the dutch oven just enhances it.  I use Bristol Cream for the sherry and get boneless short ribs from Costco at the same price as bone-in at the grocer. Makes it more affordable which means I can make it more often!  Don't know how many hands Chef John has, but it took me an hour to get it in the oven... not 20 min.

Another excellent dish from Chef John!  Followed recipe, except did not use bacon, just bacon drippings to brown ribs.  Also, boneless short ribs were my choice, and I did bake for 2 1/2 hours.  Received  rave reviews from all!  Served with polenta, which was excellent with the sherry sauce (gravy), and asparagus.

Though this dish took a lot of time and a bit more prep time than I anticipated, it wasn't difficult at all.  Best part we have leftovers and a day later my husband is still raving about it.  I followed it almost exactly (no sherry in the house and had to use a dry red wine)- I wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  Served it on top of mashed potatoes and both our plates were wiped clean!

Absolutely delicious. I served with a lemon polenta; the bright lemon taste was a nice contrast to the richness of the meat and sauce. Can't wait to make again!

I'm sorry to say, this was the most tasteless and expensive meal I've made in a very long time.  Omit the bacon and the grease and it might stand a chance, I won't be trying it again.

I made this just like chef john except I used a pressure cooker and cooked it for 25 min.  I served it with mash potatoes and green beans and a roll.  The gravy was very good when it was done and the meat was delicious.  I did not use beef broth, and used two cups water.  I did marinate the meat in a little worcheshire sauce and used a meat tenderizer.  Very good with the cooking sherry!

Delicious.  My first time cooking this particular cut of short ribs.  Made pretty much as written, but adjusted recipe for 2 servings.  Used original quantities of onion and garlic, however, and a whole small bayleaf.  (I'm a firm believer that there is no such thing as too much garlic!). Only used one pot (small cast iron Dutch oven).  300° oven was just fine.  I did need to add about 1/2 cup extra beef broth.

The one change I made was to add about 3 tbsp of a Baco Noir BBQ Glaze purchased from a local winery a while ago, which put the flavour of the sauce over the top.

This is definitely a recipe that will be used again!  Thank you, Chef John.

Loved these, really tender. I didn't have any sherry on hand so I substituted red wine with a tsp of sugar. Next time I make these (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll try with the sherry.

I normally do not write reviews however, this was fantastic. My husband can't stop talking about it. I didn't have the right sherry so I substituted with red wine. I would also use low sodium beef broth next time. I served it with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Really good.  I took one other suggestion and served over polenta.  Had nice flavor.

I had boneless short ribs and dried thyme versus fresh.  Absolutely fabulous recipe.  I served with polenta and green beans.  A hit!

Really great! I did let it cook an extra hour, though. Could have possibly added another cup or two of broth, as it did cook down a lot! Will definitely make this again! ETA Making again now, it's in the oven! Suggestions, no need to remove thyme leaves, just throw them in the pot, leaves will release, then just pick out stems. Don't skip the Sherry, that flavor makes this! Can't wait for dinner tonight, my house smells amazing!! Serving over mashed potatoes, peas, again, too. And you simply must have a good glass of red with this! Oh, I doubled the garlic, and just rough chopped.

Everyone said it tasted just like pot roast. Flavors were good and the meat was incredibly tender. Unfortunately no one in our family really cares much for pot roast. I followed all of the directions except used dried thyme. I don't have a good Dutch oven but do have a really big skillet with high sides. Once the onion sauce was done, I just returned the ribs and bacon to the skillet, stuck on the lid and put it in the oven. I let it cook an extra half hour and it fell off the bone.

I just made Chef John's Coq Au Vin last weekend. It was really amazing. I guess we expected this to equal that recipe.

I rated this recipe  three stars, because it was way too salty for me.  I will make this recipe again because I can taste all the flavors behind the salt, they were very good. When I prepare it the next time, I won't salt the meat and use a low sodium beef broth.

Followed the recipe for my New Year's Eve Dinner and I cannot wait for leftovers tonight.  I made it with baked Mac/Chz and asparagus w/ mushrooms.  Oh, and Fried Pork Chops as an appetizer :p

Fantastic. Simply fantastic. Used more liquid in the form of oxidized bad red wine. Cooked it in the oven in an open roasting pan at 225 for six hours. Reduced the sauce to finish and served with wild rice. Ridiculously good.

I just didn't think there was all that much flavor to them, and my family was definitely not very impressed.

Made it for my husband's birthday and he RAVED. He actually ate all of the remaining sauce out of the Dutch oven with a spoon. I made this with only a few variations: I used marsala wine instead of dry sherry, but only because the store was out of sherry. The marsala is a bit sweeter, but not too sweet. I made 2 lbs. of ribs instead of 1.5, yielding 4 ribs instead of an uneven 3.  I also ended up cooking it for an extra half hour or so, but only becuase I was busy cooking a side and I saw another reviewer recommend an additional hour of cooking. The ribs fell off the bone. Thanks for another wondeful recipe, Chef John!

Utterly delicious.  I did alter the dish a bit by adding chopped celery and chopped carrot to the onion base.  Also I ran out of dry sherry so the wines were 1/2 cup dry sherry and 1/2 cup tawny port wine.  That gave the dish a savory sweetness.  This is a KEEPER!
