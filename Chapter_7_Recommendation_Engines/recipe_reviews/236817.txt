This was quick and easy, and while a bit bland, was very satisfying in the stomach.  I used frozen corn rather than canned and it cooked up fine in 40 minutes. Good comfort food with good a good nutritional profile.

This was fine for an easy, quick week night meal. I used frozen corn and added in some leftover green beans. In addition to the ingredients called for, I sprinkled the chicken on both sides with Creole seasoning and also added some dried parsley on top. My son wasn't too crazy about it, but my husband and I both enjoyed it. *4/20/17 I made this again and forgot to put the aluminum foil on top. It still came out perfectly fine. Next time I want to skip the fresh garlic and sprinkle the chicken all over with taco seasoning.

I love the simplicity of this dish. All I did was add some zesty Italian dressing just a pinch like maybe 2 tps if that and on top of salt, pepper, garlic, & onion powder and a little water. Used frozen corn and a can  drained green beans. I cooked the chicken first then added the veggies. I let it all simmer until it thickened up some. It turned out amazing! If I would of had any broth I think it would of made it perfect.

The chicken was bland. I would probably add some additional seasonings if I were to make it again.

My family LOVED this, and it was so simple to make! I do like a bit of extra seasoning myself, but my family is happy with light flavouring, so this was an instant hit. I personally would add more seasoning next time, but they were really happy with it. Will definitely be making this for them again!!!

I used frozen corn and  cooked per package instructions as I did not have canned. Simple to make meal that both my children and husband liked.
