This was delicious! I used EVOO instead of the butter. I added a minced garlic clove and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper while I sautéed it. I didn't remove the chicken before cooking the rice either, I just cooked it all together. Also, a quick note about the recipe itself, it should read that the milk is replacing the water or to omit the water in the package directions. I'm not a novice cook so I already know that, but to someone who doesn't have a lot of cooking experience I could see them adding both the milk and water the way it is written. 

This was so easy and delicious and I will be making this again!

Very Good. I cut down the milk as well.  But I’d make it again.

I have to say for a quick Monday night dinner this didn’t disappoint.  It tasted a bit sweet but I am sure it was due to the packaged rice. I doubled the recipe and 4 cups of milk was just right.

It was good, the only thing I would change is using 2 cups of milk.  I would use only 1 cup of milk instead.  I found it watery and I had to let the milk evaporate.  Otherwise, it was a simple recipe with few ingredients.

Overall I thought this was pretty good, I just felt it needed some salt and pepper and maybe a little acid (like a touch of lemon juice).  It came together really quickly and I liked that I was able to just add some additional ingredients to come up with something a little different for dinner.  Next time I think I'm going to try artichokes instead of peas.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. No changes,  I think it might benefit from a little bit of garlic next time.
