I thought this was great, certainly something I will make again. Iâ€™ll use less pepper next time because the amount called for gave it too much of a kick for me. I had some cheddar cheese to use and to get more protein, I threw in a regular sized bag of cheddar cheese at the very end. The leftovers have been great!
