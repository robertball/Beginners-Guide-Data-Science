I sifted the dry ingredients before adding the wet.  Also, I added vanilla to the batter. I used an electric mixer before adding the chips and that made for a much easier job.  These are flawless pancakes, very fluffy and melts in your mouth.  The best recipe ever! I did not care for the honey butter syrup.  I just added butter to store bought and heated that up.

With 6 kids at our house, we eat lots of pancakes.  This is a favorite.  I sprinkle the chocolate chips on the batter while it cooks, rather than mix it into the batter.  The pancakes are good without the chips as well.

This is the best pancake recipe that I have ever tried!  I like to make blueberry pancakes instead of chocolate chips - this recipe is nice and fluffy, holds the blueberries well.  I didn't bother with the syrup, omitted the chocolate chips, and added a splash of vanilla.

This is undoubtedly the best pancake recipe I have ever tried!  These would be wonderful even without the chocolate chips.  I did substitute maple syrup for the honey since I didn't have enough honey on hand.  Surprisingly, the sryup was not at all too sweet- just enough with a touch of cinnamon and very buttery.  Made this for my daughters 7 friends- and ended up making an extra batch- they all loved them!  I will be using this recipe over and over.  Try them with the sryup- you won't be disapointed!  thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe!!

I serve pancakes nearly every week, so we've become pancake connoisseurs, and these are winners. Like others, I added a splash of vanilla, and a bit more milk. Also, rather than add the chocolate chips to the batter, I sprinkled them onto the frying pancakes - this way they didn't all sink to the bottom of the bowl. This is great with cottage cheese or sour cream; no syrup or sauce needed.

these were great!  I used half regular flour and half wheat flour, added a bit more milk than in the recipe, and used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe.

These pancakes were Delicious! We didn't have any chocolate chips, we did have white chocolate chips and added some vanilla extract as well. I ade them for my gramma, she said that they were a little too sweet, but all together delicious.

These were awesome. The wifer and kids ate them up. I had to add some more milk but they turned out excellent. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was easy. Will not buy the store stuff again. I omitted the syrup and they were plenty sweet.

The kids wanted pancakes.. And I wanted to try a new recipe..I mixed these with my handheld mixer, added a tsp of vanilla, added a canola oil blend in place of the veg oil( I never have veg oil) anyway they turned out perfect! I made some without the chocolate chips and the ones I did add chocolate too I sprinkeled on once in pan. If my picky teen loves them they are a keeper in my book! Thanks for the recipe, will make again:)

The family really enjoyed these!  I only added 1/2 of the chocolate chips to the batter, then sprinkled extra chips onto the pancakes after pouring batter onto the griddle (to fill in empty spaces). And used regular size chips - what I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

Very tasty. It's like a combination of cake, muffin and a cookie all in one.   I'll admit due to their thickness they dud take a while to cook and sometimes proved a bit difficult. But the end result was awesome.

Da Bomb!!!  Made 'em gluten-, corn-, and dairy-free using no salt, almond milk (unsweetened), vanilla, 2 c. tapioca flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar, and 1/3 c. tapioca starch.  Kept everything else the same.  Absolutely awesome!!!

Very good. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out nice and fluffy. I made the honey syrup but did not care for that at all. It was a waste.Way to sweet. We ended up using regular syrup. Pancakes were awesome though.

I just did the pancake part, and they turned out great.  Perfect consistency, and I'm glad to find a recipe that doesn't require buttermilk.  I made happy faces with the miniature chocolate chips and served them with a cup of syrup for dipping for my son's 3rd birthday breakfast.

My teenagers loved these. I got thick fluffy pancakes.  Didn't make the syrup so I can't comment on that - we used freshly whipped cream.

Very good! The only problem is the chocolate chips didn't really melt during the cooking process, but I nuked the pancakes for a bit before eating them and that worked. I used 1/8 cup applesauce and 1/8 cup veg oil to cut calories/fat and I didn't even notice it! Next time I'll try all applesauce. Didn't make the syrup so my review is only for the pancakes. The batch was huge so I was able to freeze some - delish! Thank you!

To make these pancakes even more delicious, change the 1 1/2 cups of milk to 3/4 of a cup of milk and add 3/4 of a cup of Carnation evaporated milk. Also, add a teaspoon of vanilla.

These were AMAZING! My husband made them for breakfast for us this morning, and they are the best pancakes I have ever had. He increased the chocolate chips by about 1/4 cup, but other then that, followed the recipe exactly. I think next time we make them, I would add a little vanilla, but they are pretty much perfect!

These pancakes are so fluffy and delicious that I don't even include the chocolate chips 99% of the time! This recipe is my go-to for pancakes whenever I want "plain" -- yet incredible -- pancakes. 

EDIT: I just tried a new variation on this recipe, and it was phenomenal! A friend brought over a jar of pumpkin butter so I subbed it for the 1/4C oil. I also added 1t vanilla, plus a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. They were phenomenal!

These were scarfed down before I was even done cooking the last one!  I used regular sized chocolate chips and also added some peanut butter chips.  Did not make the syrup.

I have tried several different recipes for batter, and this one came out moist and thick. The pancakes really held together well, and tasted great. I did add a dash of Vanilla as I do to most of my recipes. I am really pleased with this one and have already saved it to my file.

Very good pancakes! I made no changes and the family gobbled them up faster than I could make them. I scattered extra chocolate chips around the plate for good measure ;) Will make again for sure!

These are so good!  5 stars for sure!  These are light, fluffy and turn out perfect every time.  The cinnamon-honey syrup complements the chocolate flavor that the mini morsels give.  Thanks for sharing!

I just wanted to add that my own change to the recipe was to add a ton of vanilla to the wet ingredients.  These pancakes turned out amazingly well!  They were light and fluffy and incredably easy and quick to mix up.  I'm never going with a boxed mix again!  I didn't make the syrup, but then we've never had any with chocolate chip pancakes.

Daughter loved it. I had used half chocolate chips and reeses chips. The batter itself was okay; wasn't quite fluffy like other pancakes.

These were excellent.  My one criticism is that the batter was too thick -- It made spreading it out to make a round-shaped pancake impossible.  I'll try adding more milk next time!  I had the best luck with not overcooking these using medium heat.

these were excellent and so fluffy even with the change I made.  I substituted 1 cup all purpose flour with 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ to give them a little more nutrition.  I also added a dash of vanilla.  Definitely the best pancake recipe I've used.  Thanks for sharing!

OMGosh my children and all their friends LOVE these!!!   I double the batch and freeze the extras so as they are able to just pop one in the microwave at any time and theyre much better than the store bought ones....I add a tsp of vanilla as well.
Thank you for sharing!!!

I had to make an egg free version, so substituted banana for eggs.  Used whole grain flour instead of all purpose and the batter was thick.  Had to double the milk almost, since I added little at a time and the chocolate chips sprinkling on the top did not work for me.  However all in all aver the fixings, it turned out so nice and moist.  I loved it and so did my picky eater child.

This was my first time making pancakes. I would say it wasn't the best experience but the pancakes still came out fluffy. I had no chocolate chips so i made this morning tradition without them. I put the heat on high and ended up burning these babies. Almost all the other commments were good so im assuming i made a gigantic mistake b/c i added no choc. chips and i still managed to burn them. I hope to try this recipe again and get a better tasting outcome.

The batter was very runny, and if I were to make these again, I would decrease the milk 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  Because it was so thin, it ran all over the griddle and made huge, but thin, pancakes.  We prefer a fluffier pancake, but the kids still enjoyed these.  I did not make the syrup because my kids like peanut butter on their pancakes.

We weren't fond of this recipe at all. I sifted the dry ingredients, and followed the recipe except added a splash of vanilla. The batter was very heavy, so I added a bit more milk part way through. The pancakes were very chewy and dense. I won't use this recipe again.

Why buy pancake mix from the store (that sits on your shelf and gets stale), when you can put together these great pancakes so easily with stuff you have in your cupboard? These are great as is - my husband loved it with the honey cinnamon syrop, but it was a bit sweet for me. I halved the syrop recipe and still have lots left over. The next time I make this I will sift the dry ingredients first, as I did have some flour lumps this time. Thanks for sharing this!

Absolutely amazing pancakes!!!  Made exactly as is, except I used regular size chocolate chips (it's what I had on hand).  I would recommend using the minis if you can, so they melt properly, but they were still delicious!  My fiance, who never had Choc. Chip pancakes before LOVED them!

PERFECT! It was like the other pancake recipe I had. Fluffy and not soggy. I halved the recipe because I knew it would be too much for us to eat since our parents don't like eating pancakes. What I did was I mixed in the dry then measured out the milk and mixed in the oil and egg in with the milk. Then Mixed it in with the dry. Just enough that the ingredients are blended well togerther as not to toughen the gluten. I heated my griddle to 325 degrees and cooked each side til golden brown then flipped it. I didn't do the syrup recipe cuz we already had a store-bought one that was from 2 months or so ago.

Delicious! According to the TOH website, this recipe is 702 calories per 2 pancakes (with the syrup I'm sure). But I make mine about 320 calorie by using skim milk, part WW flour, and Smart Balance Light (instead of butter). I didn't make the honey syrup and they really don't need maple syrup since I couldn't even taste it. Try some lite whip cream if you just want some moisture on your pancake.

This recipe has become our standard pancake recipe.  My daughter asks for it at least once a week.  My husband, who is not much of a pancake eater, loves these and doesn't mind having them two mornings in a row!  I did change the amount of baking powder after making these a few times.  When making the recipe as written the batter would thicken up too much always requiring me to add more milk.  The normal ration of flour/baking powder is 1c flour/1tsp bkg powder.  I thought maybe I had copied the recipe wrong and tried just adding 2tsp of bkg powder. The batter consistency was perfect and pancakes still turned out light, fluffy, and just as WONDERFUL.  I now only use 2tsp of bkg powder, instead of 2Tbsp, every time I make this recipe, which is helping my baking powder supply to last MUCH longer!

My 15 year old son found this recipe and made it for my Mother's Day breakfast, including the cinnamon honey butter syrup.  They were FANTASTIC, including the cinnamon honey butter...but just a little drizzle works, and I'm sure they would have been almost as good without it, but what a great special occasion breakfast it made!

Very tasty - although I did change the recipe a tad.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, as was recommended by other reviewers.  Also, thanks to the reviewer who recommended just putting a few mini chips on top of the pancake after pouring it onto the griddle, as opposed to mixing the mini chips into the batter.  This was a great idea for ensuring even distribution.

We tried this recipe for the first time about 6 weeks ago, and my husband wants to make these pancakes every Sunday. They're easy to make, delicious, and thick n' fluffy. If you leave out the chocolate chips, you still get great pancakes. You won't want to go back to just-add-water pancakes after eating these. We haven't yet tried the Cinnamon Honey Syrup because we keep forgetting to buy more honey.

Fantastic! I dont have a griddle - so in the past I have been using 2 frying bans to make pancakes. - What an pain! Ater each batch, I would need to wash out the pan, and dry it - and then start again - and I couldn't make the pancakes that large because i wanted to make a bunch at a time. Last night my kids wanted pancakes for dinner - so I had a nifty idea to do it in my oven! I heated the oven and 2 pizza pans to 500 degrees. When it was hot enough - i sprayed the pans - one at a time with PAM and I poured some pancake batter onto them! I sprinkled the pancakes with chocolate chips and rainbow sprinkles. It cake out great!!!! and all were ready so quickly! I did not have to hover over the stove top while keeping a close eye on the pancakes - as i normally do when I do it the regular "PAN" way. After 5 minutes I took one tray out and flipped the pancakes - and they were done a minute later. I did not flip the pancakes on the second tray beacause my kids liked how the pancakes looked without the top side getting dark. _ they did look pretty! The pancakes looked like fluffy cookies and had pretty rainbow speckles on them! I think I might continue using this as my pancake method!!! By the way - less fat too!!! and they did not burn!

Yummy!! I skipped the honey topping and instead drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream. These were a big hit!

HaPpY BiRtHdaY Eddie! 
I made these for my son's 7th birthday. I told him he could have a special birthday breakfast and this is what he wanted along with eggs,bacon,toast & chocolate milk! I followed the recipe but my first pancake was a little thick so i added a couple drops of milk until it was right. I will never buy pancake mix again! i put a candle in his pancakes and sung HB~what a great way to start the day! Thank you allrecipes

These were delicious and very easy to make.  The syrup recipe went well with them, but I still prefer the thick bottled syrup to eat with my pancakes.  It tastes just like a chocolate chip cookie in a pancake!  The bf loved them.  This is a keeper!

These are delicious--best pancakes ever. I did add a splash of vanilla and sifted in the dry to the wet, as suggested by other users. I also read a few tips online that prevented me from burning my pancakes (which I've always done prior to trying this recipe): preheat your pan to medium high with no oil for 2-3 minutes; after that, drop the heat down to medium low/medium, add a light coating of canola oil to the pan, and then start cooking your pancakes. Also, instead of stirring in the chocolate chips to the batter, scatter them on top of the uncooked side of the pancake after you've placed the batter in the pan.

Mmmmm these pancakes are awesome. They taste even better than my old favorite one's from blueberry hill. I had no honey so i couldn't make the syrup so i used creamy whipped cream instead. I do want to make this again and try the syrup.Thanks so much!

These were the best pancakes I've ever made. I always add the chocolate chips to the pancakes after they've started cooking on the griddle, so they don't burn an make the pancake hard to flip. I did make some of these without chocolate chips, and they were still deliciously fluffy. 

I think I finally found my pancake box mix replacement :)

We all really liked these pancakes. My DH claimed that he thought it was like eating a really soft chocolate chip cookie, so next time I might back off the sugar a touch. My 5 year old loved these, which is great because he'll get the large quantity of frozen leftovers for breakfast this week. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These are truly the best pancakes ever. Easy, and yet wayyy better than the ones from a pancake mix. I love that it uses oil instead of butter, because it is so much easier to whip up in a pinch, No need to melt anything! The batter is thick, but it's okay, cuz that's what gives those cakes their awesome fluffiness, so don't go and thin the batter!! I also did not add the chocolate, but they still cam e out great.My kids told me that I should never go back to making the ones from a mix. They were really good, I did add some vanilla extract, which made them that much better. I served with corn syrup and fresh fruit. This recipe is a winner, thanks for sharing!

They were a little too thick for my taste.  I added a tsp. of vanilla and used regular chocolate chips.  I think they will be better next time if I add more milk.

The recipe was good for a basic recipe.  I did add a little bit more milk as advised by other reviewers.  I did not want undone batter in the middle.  The pancakes are very fluffy which is the way I like them.  I think next time I will add a dash of vanilla and it will be perfect.  I did not add chocolate chips as I just like plain pancakes.

These were great!  Not too sweet, just the right chocolate.
First we did strawberries on top.
We did the cinnamon honey syrup with leftover frozen pancakes the next day.  It was tastey.

Delicious. Perfect pancakes. I doubled the recipe and used half the batter for choc chips and the other half for blueberries. I didn't make the sauce and then found I had none in the cupboards, so I wish I had. Next time...

Fabulous pancakes! Very light & fluffy. The only change I made to the recipe was to cut it in half. I did make the syrup & thought it wouldn't need it but it complements the chocolate taste well. You only need a light drizzle though so you might want to only make half the syrup. My grandson loved these...thanks!

Really easy and quite good! I, too, added vanilla extract and put the chocolate chips on while they were cooking instead of mixing them into the batter.  I fed my husband, myself, and two kids without doubling the recipe and had one extra pancake that no one could eat because they were full.  These are light and fluffy and filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmmm! My 3 yr. old and I made these this morning and they were great!  Didn't let her have the syrup as they're sweet enough on their own.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour and added about 2 Tbs of heavy cream for richness and to thin out the batter a bit.  We didn't have mini chocolate chips so we added the regular ones.  I tried adding them to each pancake individually (making letters and smiley faces) but stopped after 3 because the chips burned.  Better to just add them to the batter.  I bet this would be good with carob chips too!  May try adding a few Tbs of pumpkin puree or chopped walnuts next time.

These were pretty good although I found them more dense than the recipe that I normally use.

This recipe was easy and yummy!  Very fluffy and tasty pancakes.  I substituted half of the milk for whey, which my sister had left over from making yoghurt.  The whey reacted with the baking powder to make the pancakes even fluffier!  They were a big hit.

I've made this recipe about 5 times, only the 2nd time turned out well. All the other times, the pancakes turned out dry, but I'm not sure why. I am certain I'm following the proportions and directions on the recipe.

These is seriously the BEST pancake recipe!! I LOVE the cinnamon honey syrup, it's so delicious! The pancakes I made turned out amazing, much better than the boxed ones! And I've never had better syrup. The best part is: it's such a quick and easy recipe!!!

These pancakes are exceptional.  I made them with almond milk and whole wheat flour from Trader Joe's and they turned out very well.

This is a great recipe as is, however I was not a fan of the syrup.  I make changes to the recipe just to make it healthier for my family.  I substitue 1 c. of all pupose flour for: 1/2 c. wheat, 1/4 c. wheat germ, 1/4 c. flax meal.  I substitute brown sugar for the white, and apple sauce for the oil.  Great recipe that I can change as I see fit!

One of the best pancake recipes I've tried.  Great with or without chocolate chips.  I used a coconut/almond milk blend that worked perfectly with this recipe.  The pancakes were super fluffy.  I was worried at first because they were slow to rise but when they did, all concern went away.  This will be my go to pancake recipe.

This was the best pancake recipe I've ever made! The only changes I made were adding vanilla and cinnamon and a little extra sugar. We had them without syrup or toppings and they were delicious all by themselves. This is a new family favorite.

Probably the best consistency of pancakes I have ever ended with before. I've never been the best at making pancakes but these were excellent. They are much like the texture of pancakes you would get at Ihop, but with chocolate added. Also, I added white chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips. It was a perfect mixture between sweetness and not! Will definitely make again! Also I added just a little bit of vanilla and used cake flour instead of all purpose, but followed the rest of the recipe to heart. Thanks

This recipe makes very fluffy pancakes - my family likes this so I consider that a plus.  Sometimes I also add a dash of cinnamon or vanilla (depending on my mood) to play with the flavor a little, but the chocolate chips make it plenty sweet to fit anyone's sweet tooth craving.  My kids love these pancakes!

Seriously some of the best chocolate chip pancakes I have ever had. I added 1 tsp vanilla but other than that, made exactly the recipe. Makes quite a bit son I froze the rest.

The kids loved these pancakes!  My hubby and I weren't as thrilled with them, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate chip pancakes anyway.  The were very dense pancakes - I'm not saying this is bad, they fluffed up nicely on the griddle, but they were still dense.  Per other reviews, I added 1 tsp. vanilla and increased the chips to 3/4 cups.  We didn't do the syrup, so I can't say how that was.  Even though the hubby and I didn't care for them, I will keep this recipe for the kids.

Truly the best pancake recipe ever, this is a staple in our house on weekends.  You can add banana, cinnamon apple, raisins or all manner of other stuff instead of chocolate.  After so many years of making bad pancakes I am thrilled to have found this no-fail recipe.

These are wonderful.  I woke up on Saturday morning craving Chocolate chip pancakes and I was so excited to find out I had everything in the cupboards to make these!  I didn't make the cinnamon honey syrup, so I can't rate that, but it sounds good and I will be making that next time.  The only thing I did differently was I used regular sized chocolate chips (since that's what I had) and they were great!

I use this recipe everytime I make pancakes. The only modification is leaving out the chocolate chips. With pancake syrup there's more than enough sweetness to go around. For other beginners, I recommend letting the batter sit off to the side for about 20-30 minutes after mixing it up. The resulting pancakes are really fluffy.

I used regular, not mini, chips and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. These were yummy and fluffy. My husband said that these do burn easier than the other pancake recipe we use, probably because they have more sugar. We also didn't have enough honey to make the honey syrup, so I used maple syrup (real maple!) instead of honey, adding the butter and cinnamon and a little vanilla - delicious!

this recipe has quickly become our family's favorite "breakfast for dinner" recipe.  I have to watch for sales on mini chocolate chips to make it.  Thank you for the great recipe!  Great with sour cream or whipped cream on them as well.

My kids and I really enjoy this. I usually will use buttermilk instead of regular milk and top with sliced strawberries and whipped cream or strawberry jam. My kids get so excited when I make these. NOTE: It's much easier to get a good amount of chocolate chips on each pancake if you sprinkle the chips on each individual pancake after pouring on the griddle. Give the batter a couple minutes to sit on the counter before using, too.

YUMMY. No changes made, made recipe as is and was a great breakfast for Valentine's Day! Didn't make the honey syrup, I topped with whipped cream instead. Great recipe.

I can't remember if I reviewed this already or not but ever since I made it the first time I have made it at least four other times! Such a great pancake recipe, one of the best I have found! I will be using this as a base for all my pancakes. I do like to add some Vanilla and Cinn. for regular. If I am making The chip ones just vanilla. Thank you so much for sharing, my kids say a really big thanks too!

THE BEST PANCAKES I HAVE EVER MADE! I always loved going to IHOP for chocolate chip pancakes, but these top the ones at IHOP! These are so easy to make and the whole family will love them. I add the chocolate chips after pouring the batter into the pan, this way I can accomodate my families specific request.s (bananas with choc. chip, blueberries w/o choc. chip, etc.) Thanks so sharing, will be using this for years to come!

I just used this recipe this morning for our special Valentine's Day breakfast.  The only change I made was to add a little vanilla extract.  This recipe is just perfect on it's own and the pancakes are restaurant perfect!  To make them extra special I used mini-chocolate chips and added a few drops of red food coloring to make the batter pink, then before serving I used a large heart cookie cutter to cut out heart shapes.  We used whipped cream and pink and red sprinkles on top and the kids LOVED them!  The pancakes were sweet enough for a dessert...but hey, it's Valentine's Day!  Thank you so much, I can't wait to wow my family again with this recipe!

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried.   The pancakes were very light and fluffy.  I'm sure they would be good without the chocolate chips.  I did not make the cinnamon honey syrup.  They  were good with maple syrup.

These are AWESOME panakes!!!  Had them for breakfast, but was also snacking on them all day.  Don't let the chocolate chips burn!  I didn't make the syrup for them, but I don't think it is neccessary.

This is a very rich pancake! I initially believed that the syrup wasn't mandatory so I tried both with and without the syrup. I was amazed of the blending of the pancakes and syrup and concluded that the syrup is a must.

These were great!  So easy to make and so yummy!  I put extra chocolate chips in them, and in half I added fresh blueberries....  wow.  These only need a little pat of butter on top.... YUM!  My new number one pancake recipe and I will NEVER buy store mix again. :)  THANKS!

Best basic pancake recipe ever!  Didn't have choc chips on hands so used M&M's for the kids.  Tried them plain and with blueberries and they were GREAT!  You could really do anything with this one.  No bitter aftertaste, just a perfect balance between sweet and salty and just the right thickness too!

Didn't need to change a thing! I did use half whole wheat flour, but that's it. Everybody loved them. Have to say though, the syrup is a waste of good butter.

added a little extra milk, separated the egg whites and beat individually before adding to mixture. also added vanilla essence and cinnamon. *Update* I have recently tried making these pancakes, adding smooth peanut butter to the egg/milk. Irresistible!

A great basic recipe!  I did add some vanilla and used whole wheat pastry flour.  I use regular chocolate chips but just add them to the pancake when it is on the griddle.

Made these for a giggling group of 10 year old girls after a sleepover and they were so excited to eat choco-chip pancakes.  The basic batter is good with or without the chips.  Nice and fluffy and light.  Since some people wanted plain cakes, I added the chips onto each one after pouring out onto the griddle.  Worked great.

These are very tasty! I prepared the triple amount of the dry ingredients, mixed them together, including the chocolate chips and stored the mix in an airtight box as a homemade pancake mix. So I just had to combine 1 cup of the mix, 1 egg, 2 tbsp. oil and 3/4 cup milk, which made enough pancakes for me and my boyfriend for breakfast. We ate them with normal maple syrup and they were excellent! Maybe I would prepare the mix as a gift as well.

An excellent pancake recipe. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and moist, and the homemade cinnamon syrup added a lot to the richness of the dish. With the syrup though, if you put too much on, it will drown out the taste of the chocolate chips. Other than that, these pancakes are perfect!

Very easy and they turn out very fluffy.  The first time I did change it a bit by adding blueberries instead of chocolate chips and they turned out great.  I made it again this time with nothing in them, just the batter.  I still love them.

I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars.  While these were not "the best" pancakes I've ever had, they were definitely quite good.  Very fluffy and just the right texture to cook perfectly inside without burning the outside.

I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I think that helped give them a little punch.  :)

This recipe was awful!!! I followed the directions exactly and they came our very thick and heavy. They didn't bubble like pancakes are suppose to. I've never made pancakes that looked, tasted or felt worse than these! With such positive reviews from others, I thought this was going to be a winner, but I can honestly say, I'll NEVER do this one again!

I made these pancakes for the family. They made more pancakes than I could even imagine. The first time I made them I put the amount of baking soda it calls for. I felt like it had the baking soda after taste. So now when I make them I add 1 T.Baking soda and 1 tsp. Baking soda. Rather than 2 T. They are so fluffy and so wonderful. Best pancakes ever.

On a Sunday morning, my son and I whipped up a batch of these pancakes in 15 minutes. It was fun to make the recipe together. Recipe was very easy. We both agreed that these were the best pancakes that we had ever had! We didn't have any chocolate bits so we cut up a Hershey Candy Bar into bite sizes. I put the chocolate on the top of the pancakes before flipping. My son said that they were VERY GOOD PANACKES!

Delicious pancake mix. I was looking for a good simple mix with basic ingredients I know are in my cupboard (no buttermilk, no quick oats, no wheat flour). I mixed in 3 very ripe (turning brown)cut bananas instead of chocolate chips (since I don't always have them around either). The pancakes were thick, fluffy and the kids gobbled them up.  I think I'll just keep making these, because they are just as easy as buying pancake mix in the store. I didn't try the syrup.

These pancakes were DELICIOUS!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and did not use chocolate chips.  I also just used maple syrup.  My only suggestion would be to cook them on a high temperature quickly instead of a low temperature for a longer time.  They can get very dry if cooked for too long.  I will definitely be making this recipe for years and years!

These pancakes are AMAZING! They were super easy to make, and one recipe made enough for another breakfast! I followed the advice of others and added extra sugar, but I think next time I'll just follow the recipe to the letter.

Thank you so much!

deliciously light and fluffy!  was a bit harder to flip.  I would suggest adding more milk until the batter is a slightly thinner consistency.  I added vanilla extract and cinnomon to taste. yum!

Batter turned out very thick when made according to recipe and were difficult to cook all the way through.  Ended up with several burnt pancakes with gooey cneters.  Those that did turn out had wonderful flavor.

Soo yummy...I used regular chocolate chips (about 3/4 so there'd be enough in every pancake), and added about 1/3 cup of milk when I decided the batter was a bit too thick after my first attempts.  Could probably use a bit more liquid than that, actually.  Other than that, fabulous.  The syrup is wonderful on this too!  Trust me, you will try to eat more than you should when you take your first bite of these!

These ROCK!  I made them with my son for a special treat tonight.  I'm not usually a big pancake fan, but these were light and fluffy and wonderful!  The syrup was the perfect touch.  Not too sweet.  Just right.  Next time we make these, we'll be sure my husband and daughter can enjoy them as well.  YUMMY!!!

Delicious! I made them for my daughter's 16th birthday breakfast. I have four kids from 2 1/2 to 17 and they all thought they were great, my husband was not home but I know how he likes his pancakes and he will love them too. They were light and fluffy just as other reviewers said. I made the pancakes per the recipe except I am out of white sugar and used brown. I did not make the syrup, used maple syrup instead. I will be replacing my die hard pancake recipe of the last 14 years for this one! Next time I will make some without chocolate chips too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These pancakes tasted so good I didn't even need the syrup. The chocolate was wonderfully gooey..

I substituted about half a cup of oats for flour, and added a dash of cinnamon to the mix. Turned out great.

These cooked up very tasty with a great texture.  I was a little worried about the amount of baking powder, but I put it in anyway.  It did make the batter extremely thick and fluffy, so I had to add a little extra milk.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and regular-sized milk chocolate chips.  I only used a fraction of the salt.  I didn't make the syrup.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are good - and rich!!!  I was only able to eat one...but that is probably a good thing!!!!  I went without the syrup in the recipe and stuck only with the pancakes.  Made a nice brunch when served with Scrambled Eggs Done Right also from this site.  Thanks!

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried! However, the recipe for the cinnamon honey syrup is NOT good at all. The pancakes are perfect was a syrup made from butter, brown sugar, and milk.

Made these for the grandkids - they loved them. Just used reg. syrup and sprinkled the chips on top while cooking.  Since I only made 1/3 the mix - they decided they were still hungry for more - so I made more - and of course by the time they finished the first helping - they decided they were full!?! So I just cooked them all up - let them cool and refrigerated them overnight since they were spending the night again - a low microwave heating - wala - loved them again the next morning!!
GREAT RECIPE - THANKS! EVERY TIME the grandkids spend the night - they want these pancakes - today I taught the nine year old to make them. WE NOW SKIP THE SYRUP AND USE POWDERED SUGAR - lets the taste of the chocolate chips shine!!

This was my first try at pancakes and they turned out really good!  I did use whole wheat flour, no calorie sweetener (and less than what it called for) and some more choc chips and they were still really good!

Oh my goodness.  I used Soy milk with this recipe (I can't drink milk) and these were the most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted--and I have tasted a lot. The homemade syrup with these pancakes is a beautiful marriage.  Without the syrup, I'm not sure they would be as good.   

I also used olive oil for the vegetable oil, sea salt, brown eggs, and I didn't have any chocolate chips, but broken up bits of dark chocolate worked well too. 

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Hands down, one of the best pancake recipes I've come across...even without the chocolate chips and cinnamon honey syrup.  We added white chocolate and milk chocolate chips to the batter and they were great!  They're also great with slices of banana mixed in.

I thought this mix was pretty good.  i wish i would have used all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat.  i would not recommend using whole wheat flour because the pancakes were ridiculously thick and took longer to cook.  Nonetheless, they were very delicious.  Also, i added amaretto to the syrup.  Nothing wrong with a little liquor in the morning.  :-)

I've made this twice now and they keep getting better.  I do add cinnamon and vanilla.  Used regular sized chips the first time and mini the second.  Definitely better with the mini.  Kids love em!

Loved this recipe!  Very simple ingredients and I didn't have to worry about buttermilk or making a substitute.  I didn't have mini chips so I made the batter plain and then right after putting some in the pan I dropped some giant dark chocolate chips into it and they got sucked into the middle.  This way they are more evenly distributed and don't melt all over the place (if you mix big chips into the batter they tend to clump more).  I'll definitely use this one again!

My husband told me today that his grandma used to make him chocolate chip pancakes with honey butter on them...so I did a search for chocolate chip pancakes & came across these.  He really likes them.  And I tried them both with and without chocolate chips.  Without chocolate chips, I tried with regular syrup.  These are great as a standalone pancake and as written with the choc chips & honey/butter/cinnamon mixture.  We really enjoyed them.  Thanks!

This is my first, and only, pancake recipe I've ever used. As stated in other reviews, I sifted the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients to it. It was very light and fluffy. 

I've tried it with and without chocolate chips. Still good, nevertheless. The picture I added doesn't have chocolate chips in it...sorry!

I use this as a base for all of my pancakes now. It is a great mix. However, I sub coconut oil and often omit sugar by replacing it with bananas or some other fruit.

I started making this recipe a year ago for  some company that came over. Everyone raved over how wonderful it was. So I have been making it ever since. My family and friends love it and its now apart of our recipe box here at home. Its such a good pancake recipe that even if you didn't have chocolate chips. The pancakes would still be delicious.

My family loves this recipe.  We have these pancakes almost every weekend.  The only change I make is to use about 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  And we only occasionally use the chocolate chips.

I didn't make the honey syrup w/these. The pancakes were super thick(thinned out w/ another 1/4c of milk & they were still really thick:). Good flavor but the kiddos weren't wowed by them.

Delicious! I sliced a banana, mashed it, and added after the choc chips.  Came up very fluffy and tasty! Haven't tried the syrup though.

Very fluffy and filling pancakes....kids didn't like them ~ mom did!  Tried w/ half wheat flour...difficult to cook, but hearty/yummy for adults ~not a kid favorite.

great recipe! this is a great pancake recipe, and will replace the one I have been using for years! loved the chocolate chips, like another reviewer, I just dropped them in after I put the batter on the griddle. Topped with home-made cream & syrup. Also, used whole-wheat flour.***In addition, I didn't use butter or oil in the batter, instead I used the butter to lightly grease the pan & they turned out wonderful!

i dont think i did it right... i tried making half the amount, but i dont think that was the problem... anyway long story short they were slightly bitter and flour-y or baking powder like, and burned easy on the pan... this was my first time cooking pancakes so i will defiantly try again, maby just not this recipie...

Delicious and easy enough for a poor college kid to make! Made a huge batch of them for my boyfriends and his roomates this weekend and they said they want me to live in their fraternity house so I can be their "house mom" and call me Betty (Crocker).

I've got a new favourite pancake recipe! Even without the chocolate chips, these were delicious. They weren't too cakey and looked as good as they tasted. I was startled at first by the soupiness of the batter, but they cooked up beautifully. Can't wait 'til the weekend to make these again!

These are pretty heavy but they taste great! For some reason I forgot to add the eggs but it tasted great anyway. I might make it tomorrow WITH the eggs. So just so you know: this works fine without the eggs.

I used butter instead of oil, melted in the pan before cooking!  Used too many chocolate chips!!  But oh well!!  Probably shouldn't rate b/c of it but I bet it would have been even better if I had measured them!  Hee hee :)  Super good!  Didn't use the syrup recipe but I bet it was good too!  Thanks!  :)

Great recipe! I made them for breakfast for my dad and brother and they absolutely loved them! They also loved the cinnamon honey syrup...but i suggest cutting it down a bit, it makes a lot of syrup. Overall great pancakes! :D

Absolutely fabulous! We had these for breakfast this morning and we loved them! I normally don't like anything with cinnamon but I made the syrup anyway... so glad I did! It was the perfect compliment to the pancakes. I will definitely make these again!

This recipe was delicious! I made these for my brother, who LOVES chocolate, and he loved them! The only complaint I have is that they never cooked quite right. They were either burned a bit or the middle was slightly gooey. This might've been the recipe or maybe it was just my ancient griddle. :) Thanks for a GREAT recipe! I will use this again in the future, no doubt!

Wow yummy! I did try to make it a bit healthy though, I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1 1/2 Cup AP flour, I also replaced the oil with applesauce. They were still great!

These were fantastic.  I had never made pancakes before ever, and I made these...very good.  I did take another review's advice and reduce the baking powder to two teaspoons, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It's sweet, very sweet...and filling.  I would definitely like to try this with blueberries.

Good recipe. Used half white whole wheat flour, which gave it a bit stronger aftertaste, but the kids still ate them up. Did not use the syrup, chocolate chips are sweet enough!

Wonderful pancakes! To make them healthier for my kids, I changed or added the following... instead of 2 cups white flour I used 1 1/2 unbleached and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour,  add 1 T cinnamon, add 1 T vanilla, add 2 T flax meal, add 2 T toasted wheat germ, and an extra slash of milk if needed. My kids could not eat them fast enough!

Added vanilla and blueberries in lieu of the chocolate chips. The batter was so nice and creamy, and held the blueberries suspended in the batter (no digging around for them!) perfectly! I sifted the dry ingredients together and mixed the wet seperately before combining, and the result was nice and light! Delish!

Such a great recipe for pancakes! I didn't make the syrup suggested, but these taste wonderful alone or with regular maple syrup. The recipe does make a lot of pancakes, so I usually split it in half and still have plenty.

A delicious, rich pancake.  I made some with the chocolate chips and they were over the top!  I made some without chips and they were delicious and light and had a wonderful flavor.  This recipe makes a large batch. I did not make the syrup.

Hands down one of the fluffiest, tastiest pancakes I've ever made. A great base pancake recipe....the baking powder makes it super fluffy. For a richer flavor, substitute white for brown sugar. Oh, and double the chocolate chips :)

This is the first recipe from taste of home that we have actually enjoyed. The batter was thick enough to hold the chocolate chips so they didn't sink to one side. I added a tsp of vanilla and that was my only change. The servings were accurate as well. This made 2 thick pancakes per person.

These pancakes tasted really good, but they are only getting a 4 star because they were not better than a lot of other pancakes I have tried. Batter was a little thicker than I like, but just added a bit of milk to thin it out and they cooked up nicely. Didn't make the syrup, but sprinkled with powdered sugar for a sweet morning treat!  **Update: I decided to try to make a "low-fat" version & did so with success! They were just as good; only difference was the texture (a little bit chewy) but the flavor was still there. The changes I made: Used eggbeaters instead of egg, melted promise low fat butter instead of oil, used fat free milk, replaced the sugar with Splenda & used less choco chips and after I cooked them up sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar. Delicious!!

This recipe is fantastic. I couldn't make them fast enough for my two little girls. We used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. Also added 1 tsp. of vanilla per other suggestions. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This is a really great, really easy recipe that anyone (and I do mean anyone) can make. I use regular chocolate chips instead of semi sweet ones, so no worries about bitterness and the pancakes still cook just fine. Haven't tried the syrup yet.

I made these this morning and we loved them! My 2-year-old kept going to my husband and me for more after he was done with his. I added a splash of vanilla, but otherwise, the recipe is perfect. The pancakes were really fluffy. Delicious!

Easy and delicious.  I've made several pancake recipes from this site, and this is the family's favorite "plain" recipe.  I omitted the chocolate chips, used brown sugar instead of white, and added a dash of vanilla.

Very fluffy.  Worked well with 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This would be good, as others have pointed out, with blueberries or even plain.  I added a touch of vanilla and a bit more milk.

I am so glad I picked this recipe to make this morning as a treat for my son and husband. My three year old ate his pancake in record time. I have made other pancake recipes before but this one was super easy and fluffy. You can add in anything you want to them. I didn't make the syrup, I don't think they needed it. But it sounds good too.

Made these this morning and the family loved it! I sifted the dry ingredients, added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and used mini chocolate chips morsels. Following the recipe (using 1/4 C of batter for each), it made 14 extra fluffy pancakes. Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious!

These were great, almost wish they hadn't had any chocolate chips in them, as they were very fluffy and best tasting in bites without chips.

This is such a GREAT starter recipe! I am not a big fan of putting chocolate chips in the batter (on special occasions for the kids we do) but we do put fruit in it alot. I also put tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter for a festive feel! We dont use the cinnamon honey syrup b/c we like regular. Love this recipe!

These were really tasty. Nice and light and fluffy. The only change I made was that I used half whole wheat flour. I wasnt too sure about the syrup because Im not a huge fan of honey, but it was really good. My kids loved these too so I'll definitely be making these again :)

Very easy to make and very tasty, reminds me of a normal pancake recipe my mum used to make with added chocolate chips.

These were really good. We used extra chocolate chips, and forgo the syrup for just butter as a topping. They are actually really tasty reheated up in the microwave. Thanks for sharing.

Oh.  My.  Gosh.

I made these twice, as an easy dinner, as written (except for the syrup as I didn't have that much honey).  We loved them.  The third time, again as a dinner, I added about 2t orange extract and made the syrup.  Fabulous.  We've decided these are an easy dinner that most certainly don't need a desert!  Leftovers are great the next morning (or for lunch).

These pancakes are AMAZING!!! Not only do they turn out beautiful and fluffy everytime but they taste wonderful! We usually omit the chocolate chips and the syurp listed but we make these all the time. I do add a splash of vanilla (thanks to one reviewer). I have shared this recipe with so many people they love my pancakes and i just can't steal all the credit...although i wish i could! I have found they do better if you whisk all of the wet ingredients togegther prior to putting them in with the dry ingredients, not sure why that helps...but they are amazing!! Thanks!!

Wow - these are great! By far the fluffiest pancakes I've ever made, and so simple. The only thing I changed was to substitute 1 C flour with 1C whole wheat flour.

Delicious!!!  The pancakes taste so good and cook up perfectly!  The only thing I changed was that I used unsweetened applesauce for the oil and omitted the salt.  We like the chocolate chips, but we'd rather have fruit, so I probably won't make these with chocolate chips every time, but will mix up what I put in it each time.  We thought these were so good, I even took a picture, which I had never done before.  Definitely a keeper!  As for the syrup, I haven't tried that yet, but plan to, as it sounds delicious.  :)

Awesome recipe! I made them exactly as the recipe called, and they were perfect. The pancakes had a great flavor and the texture was light and fluffy. As others have said, I think they would be delicious with blueberries substitued for the chocolate chips.

Me and my siblings really enjoyed these. I followed this recipe as is basically, except I added in a dash vanilla extract to the milk mixture. Also when mixing the milk mixture and flour mixture together I added in a bit more milk because the batter was a bit too lumpy and thick. I folded in the half cup of chocolate chips after. Just a note, I did find these took longer cook then regular pancakes and that your non-stick pan has to be at the perfect temperature. Our first pancake broke into pieces because of this but we got the hang of it quickly. I did not make the honey butter syrup, I ate mine with bananas, blueberries and yogurt with a drizzle of honey. My sibling had theres with maple syrup. Everyone loved these, will make them again!

Delicious!!! So light and fluffy.  I skipped the syrup this time and added some vanilla to the batter.  SOOOOOO  Good and easy.   Will try with blueberries next.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked fine.

Thanks so much for this easy and versatile recipe.  I am never buying a packaged pancake mix again! Usually when I get recipes from allrecipes.com, I make some modifications according to our taste. The only thing that was different, is that I used butter flavored shortening because that was all I had on hand.  I ran out of vegetable oil a few day prior.  My children loved it!  Next time I am going to make them without chocolate chips and put individual bowls of toppings on the table.  Thanks again.

These were very good and very fluffy perfect pancakes but only AFTER I added more milk. The beginning batter was way too thick and I tried to give them a shot since that was the orginal recipe but that pancake went straight into the trash. Once I added extra milk the pancakes were perfect. I did use all whole wheat flour though instead of regular.

This is great pancake recipe.  It's the first I've come across that my kids have actually eaten and has made me cross Bisquick off of my shopping list.  I altered a tiny bit.  I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all purpose and added 2 tsp each of vanilla extract and lemon juice.

These were some of the best pancakes I have ever had! I made them as a treat for my husband and 2 year old on a Sunday morning. They were great! I followed the directions and they were light, fluffy and chocolatey! Even if I didn't add the chocolate chips, it would still be a great pancake!

I was eager to try this out, as it would be the first time we ever ate chocolate chip pancakes.

I followed the recipe, and mine weren't all that great.  In fact my 2 kids, and their friend, asked I could make regular pancakes.  

Must of done something wrong, 'cause a lot of members gave it high ratings.

This is a really good pancake batter, but it's a little thick. I always follow the recipe, but increase the milk, by at least half a cup, if not more...i kinda add till I get the consistancy I like.

These were great and easy to make!  Batter seems too thick at first but lowering the griddle temp made them cook through.  Its amazing how well the honey butter goes with chocolate chips!

Yummm! I reviewed these a LONG time ago with some changes but I just made them again, following the recipe to a T, and they're just as delicious as ever! These are the softest, fluffiest pancakes you'll ever make--that 2 tbsp baking powder reeeeally does the trick. I didn't use the syrup even though I'm sure it would have been yummy; this is the best drizzled with Hershey's chocolate syrup!!!

Great recipe.  I like my pancakes a little thinner, so I added a bit more milk.  The kids LOVED them!

These were very easy and pretty good! However, I don't know if none of the other reviewers that gave this one 5stars mentioned it but after I first mixed the batter it was very heavy and thick, more like pancake dough. I know another reviewer had the same problem. It was easy to fix though by adding SMALL amounts of milk, and mixing after each addition until the right pourable consistency is reached. Good basic recipe! Will make again.

I was looking for a basic pancake recipe and picked this one because of the high ratings it got - I omitted the chocolate chips and made no other changes.  They were  very light and fluffy, next time I will add some vanilla if I omit the chocolate chips again.  

thanks for the quick simple recipe!

I did not use the chocolate chips but served them with the apple pie filling recipe on this site and boy, all I could hear at the table was "mmm"! Came out really nice and fluffy.

Very good recipe! I followed the suggestions of some previous reviewers and added some vanilla.  I didn't make the syrup, just used whipped cream for me and maple syrup for him.  It was great!

Delicious!  Light and puffy.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, soy milk and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Added 1 tsp vanilla, a shake of cinnimon and some flax meal. The batter is thick and can be thinned with a little more milk. This recipe made a big batch of pancakes, so I will freeze some for an easy school breakfast.  I used maple syrup instead of the syrup recipe. Update: I never got to freeze these; I left them on the counter and eveyone helped themselves to them throughout the morning - they are like healthy chocolate chip cookies - these are not floppy flapjacks. I've also used this recipe in my waffle maker with great results. Another update: my girls were begging me for strawberry shortcake so I made this recipe as waffles and topped with sliced straberries, whipped topping and a drizzle of chocolate syrup - heavenly!

This is coming from my dad (he made them)- he says to make sure the pan is really hot, the first 4 didn't come out so good because of this. He put chocolate chips in some and apples in others. They tasted good, even plain.

These were good, but my husband and I both said that if you told us they were box pancakes, we would believe you.  I think I will stick with Aunt Jemima, but this is a good back up if I run out.

This is my default pancake recipe now. It is wonderful with or without the chocolate chips. I usually add a tablespoon or two of extra milk, but other than that it is great. I don't usually make the syrup, but it was pretty good the one time I did.

I'm not a big pancake fan, but for chocolate chips I'll make the exception.  My problem with this was that I found the batter was far too thick, and I had to add a great deal more milk before it was the consistency of pancake batter.  But once I had them more liquid, they turned out quite nicely and tasted very good.  The syrup was too heavy a butter flavour though, although the roommates liked it just fine.

My husband normally makes pancakes from bisquick, but we were out.  So I whipped this recipe up for him. These were pretty good, but I doctored the recipes a little bit. I added a tablespoon of vanilla.  I also cut back on the milk just a smidge and added two tablespoons of lemon juice to counter the bitterness of the baking powder.  (You could also just use buttermilk instead of sweet milk.) My husband sprinkled the chocolate chips on top of the batter after pouring it on the griddle, and this made for a very even distribution of the chips.  All in all, pretty yummy, and we had enough left over to put some in the freezer for quick school day breakfasts.

WOW! Great recipe. Nice texture and flavor (I did add the vanilla though). I am notorious for AWFUl pancakes. In the words of my very honest 7-year old this morning. "OH, make these again ok mama? They were really good, not like the other ones you make" So there you have it - this recipe even makes a pancake disaster like me look good) I threw the extra cooked pancakes in the freezer to make me look good tomorrow too! 

new note: Works nicely in the waffle iron! YUM

These were great the first time around - I had batter leftover which I used the next day and they were a bit heavy. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make these next time I'm craving chocolate chip pancakes.

Good recipe.  I took the advice in the reviews and added a bit of vanilla.  I also just poked the chocolate chips through the top of the pancakes immediately after I flipped them.  Very good fluff and taste although I prefer buttermilk pancakes.

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and it turned out divine. Great for when you need a chocolate kick! I upped the chocolate chips a bit because I have a serious sweet tooth, haha :) But I didn't use any syrup either. Tasted just great plain!

Making them at night and refrigerating the batter for the morning saves time and makes the pancakes taste better somehow; try it!

My DH made these pancakes for breakfast this morning and we thought they were ok.  The end result was a bit more of a doughy pancake than we're used to...but we did make some modifications.  We only used 1 Tbsp of baking powder (2 is way too much IMHO) and we reduced the amount of chocolate chips based on other reviews.  We may make these again, but will modify the recipe further to make for a bit of a thinner batter.

This recipe was really good! The overall batter was too thin though. I had to add a bit more flour.

Wow, these were SO GOOD!  Great texture, taste and SO easy!  I have tried several other chocolate chip pancake recipes and wasn't impressed.  As a result, I usually just use Krusteau Buttermilk Pancake mix from Sam's Club and add chocolate chips.  I know it's cheating but the kids prefer this mix version to all of the other homemade chocolate chip pancake recipes I've tried!  The kids definitely noticed the difference with this new recipe!  I skipped the cinnamon sauce but may try it next time.  Now that I've found this recipe, it's time to bid farewell to the Krusteau mix...

This is a really great recipe!  I've made about three times now and have experimented with different extra ingredients.  I have tried adding bananas and orange juice.  I've also used blueberries instead of chocolate. The pancakes have always turned out great! They were  a big hit with my family and my boyfriend.

These were fabulous pancakes!  They were light, fluffy and beautiful!  Yummy!  My husband loved them.  I used blueberries instead of chocolate chips, but I will try them in the next batch.

I have never been able to flip pancakes so mine always turned out messy.  The texture of these flipped perfectly and for the first time I made pancakes that worked!

I'm sorry, but this recipe was just terrible for me. The batter was really thick and when I cooked it on the skillet, It was so thick that when I tried to flip it, it came apart, and the outside burnt so quickly that by the time I pulled it off, the inside was like gelatin. I tried to thin out the batter and when I was finally able to taste it, I really didn't like the taste either. I ended up throwing out the batter and making everyone eggs for breakfast. Thank you for posting, though!

I loved them. They were so good, I had them for breakfast and dinner. My father who is not a fan of sweets ate more than one of them. I don't know what it is about these, but they are just right in every aspect. They were chocolatey enough for the kids and those with sweet tooths (me) and just perfect for those who are not in love with chocolate chip pancakes. I'm certainly making these again.

These were very rich, but very good.  My daughters loved them.  The syrup was a nice touch as the cinnamon really compliments the chocolate chips!  Definitely a keeper!

These were very good! With or without the chocolate chips. I used a small amount of oil to grease the skillet and it made the pancakes nice and brown. Lovely!

These were wonderful. Next time I won't add so much more milk - they make les fluffy. I didn't have any choc chips but they were fine without them. I also substitute the sugar with splenda and they tasted great!

These were really good.  The texture was smooth and fluffy.  They were really rich.  And the syrup was over kill.  I tried them the next day with a store bought maple, and could eat the whole thing without my sugar and fat meter screaming at me.

Great recipe. By replacing half the white flour with meat it made it heartier and more filling. Definitely had to add more milk to the recipe but did it little by little. I even used the regular chocolate chips instead of the miniature kind and it still came out great.

These are good pancakes.  I did use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour (try to make them a bit healthier).  Also, I only had regular chocolate chips and they worked fine.  We enjoyed these pancakes and will make again.  The honey syrup is awesome!  Definately give that a try.

This is a great pancake mix! Very easy to make in the morning when the kids are circling. Really different flavor then a box mix. I did add some vanilla when i didnt have any fruit/choc and it gives a nice simple taste. i Also added some brown sugar since i dont give my kids syrup and it makes them really sweet, and NO sticky mess!
Great recipe, will use again! thanks

My children made this recipe and I watched. I thought they were just a little too heavy because they did not cook right at the recommended temperature of 350 on my electric griddle, They had to turn it down to 300 to keep them from overcooking. They did not bubble properly.
  Since we did not have chocolate chips we substituted the mini chocolate chips for chopped up chocoalte bunneys.
  My son had five pancakes and loved them he says they were the best pancakes he had ever tried as of yet. I give them a four however he rates them about a four and a half. My daughter didn't care for them much.She rated them a three and a half.

We JUST got done eating these and I had to come rave about them right away.  These are absolutely THE BEST pancakes I have ever had!!  I substitued 1/2 cup of the flour for white whole wheat and only used 1/4 cup chocolate chips (to make them healthier)... They were still wonderful!  No more pancake mix in my house!

These were really good, amazing with the sauce. I almost skipped the sauce as I usually don't use syrup, but it is amazing! I didn't eat all the pancakes right away but heated some up in the toaster later: they were even better!!!

Yum, Yum - these turned out great. I made half with choc chips and half with diced apple - my kids and husband also loved the honey cinnamon syrup. I will definitely make these again! Next time I am going to try using some chopped banana. And the best part - very quick and easy.

These were tasty.  Not my favorite pancake but very good and easy although we had trouble getting the pancakes done all the way through to the middle.  We used splenda for the sugar.  The honey syrup was fantastic.

I found that I had way more sauce than pancakes, so you may want to double the pancake part of the recipe. It was delicious! The pancakes were very thick and fluffy - my favorite kind!

This is a great recipe.  I just changed the baking powder from 2 tablespoons to 3 teaspoons and used 2.5 cups of 1% milk.  It was delicious.  My 4 year old daughter loved it!  Thanks!
