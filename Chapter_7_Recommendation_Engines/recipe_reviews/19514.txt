I don't know why these were rated so poorly.  I used medium sized shrimp to serve over salads and found them wonderful.  The flavor may not be super stong but it is a nice touch to the right dishes.

These were a nice change of pace.  The family definitely prefers grilled shrimp over steamed shrimp...I would use the marinade but grill them after letting them rest a while.  Loved the addition of the brandy!

Very little flavor. However, it was very easy to do, so in the future I can look for a more complicated marinade (aka I have buy more Chinese ingredients) without worrying about "how to cook the shrimp."

The recipe is kind of lacking, I would have added grated ginger (about 2 tbsp worth) as well as some black pepper to improve the taste.

Also don't use low-grade brandy or you'll end up with bad tasting shrimps.
