4-5-2017 The description of these in the recipe indicates the chicken is held together with a béchamel sauce (aka white sauce). The ingredients list however calls for chicken broth in the sauce this would be a veloute sauce not a béchamel. Since croquettes are indeed traditionally bound with a béchamel sauce that s what I chose to do; this amounted to substituting milk for the chicken broth. That said I can t say I was impressed with either the recipe (I chose to execute it differently than written) or the finished product which was fairly tasteless and I m not one to generally complain about a dish being boring or bland. As for the sauce this too was a disappointment plain and depending on a trio of herbs that didn t benefit the sauce. So glad I limited it to just thyme. I think a turkey or chicken gravy would have been a better accompaniment.

I thought these were very good. Next time I will add a bit of chopped celery. Other than that they were great!

This was absolutely delicious! I only made two minor changes. I did add one rib of diced celery and for the sauce I used dried herbs (didn't want to purchase fresh for just a pinch of each). At first I wasn't sure about the sauce. I thought it was kind of "meh" but when added to the crunchy chicken it was perfection. I'll most definitely make this one again!

Don't make it. Followed directions exactly. Including overnight in fridge. Bland and fell apart. Looked like cat food. I even used fresh herbs in the sauce. Yuck. I'm sorry this is my first bad review but goodness these are bad.
