I currently live in Germany, and as I could not find any sugar free hazelnut syrup the recipe requires, I substituted hazelnuts with almonds, and used a couple drops of an almond flavor concentrate. 

The taste of the biscotti is great and they are easy to make. My husband, who has Diabetes Type II, loves to have one with his espresso. The down side is that they do not have the consistency of biscotti; a biscotti is a hard cookie that can be dipped into an espresso or coffee. 

Your recipe is rather like a cookie then biscotti (soft), and perhaps needs to be renamed. However, most important they taste great, not too sweet just perfect!

The first reviewer's biscotti were soft is they should be baked again after they are sliced.  This was omitted from the recipe.
