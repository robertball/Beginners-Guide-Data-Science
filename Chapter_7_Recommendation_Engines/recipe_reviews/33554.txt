Okay, I usually try and stick to the recipe as written but after reading all of the reviews I decided to tweak as needed while I went. I made as written except for the fact I started with one egg only and no milk. I planned on adding milk as I went but it turns out I never needed and it was perfect without it. My husband loved these and even talked about them the next day. Oh and one more thing to note is that I was not able to find 6 oz. cans of tuna. They had 5 ounce (4 after drained) and 12 ounce cans. I used 2 5 ounce cans. Next time I will add some Old Bay but that is the only addition I will make. One helpful note is to freeze your tuna balls for 30 minutes before frying and that will help them hold their shape.

Recipie was quite soupy when I made it, but I added some extra tuna and some bread crumbs and it firmed right up.

Recipie is a bit vague on the frying section.  I used 350 degree oil and about golf sized balls.

I had to triple the recipe to feed my bunch. They just loved them. Some dipped them in cheese sauce and some used cocktail sauce. Very good.

I never got to the end of the recipe as stated. I only added one egg and the mix was very wet almost soupy.  No way this could be molded into balls.  I did glop a few onto a griddle patty style and they firmed up but basically  tasted like rice with too much pepper. Maybe it would have been ok dropped in oil by the spoonful but I didn't think it was worth the time or calories that would have added.

I just made these and they're so good!  I made a few adjustments though:  Instead of the 1/2 cup milk, I used a splash of almond milk.  Apple cider vinegar (that's all I had) instead of white and no onions (didn't have them on hand).  I wanted to make it a little more Asian, so I added a sprinkle of ginger and some toasted sesame seeds to the mixture.  Also added a little sesame oil to the canola oil I fried them in. I ate them dipped in soya sauce.  so yum!

This recipe is just ok.  It is very bland. If their is a way to spice it up it may be good. I really liked the idea of adding more fish into my kids diet, but they would not eat them.

This is a great way to eat tuna. It was a little wet like the reviews said but because of the reviews I decreased the milk and it held together fine.
