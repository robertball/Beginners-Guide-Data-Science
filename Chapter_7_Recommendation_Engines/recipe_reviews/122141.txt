I used one large garden zucchini which gave me 4 cups grated. I reduced the oil down to 1/3C. I put the whole amount into one pie pan and baked it for 45 min.  It was EXCELLENT! Everyone in my family enjoyed this. I will keep this recipe and make it again for next summers crop! THX! (Tip: Put shredded zucchini into a potato ricer and squeeze out the extra liquid.  This method works great and takes most if not all the liquid out of this vegetable)

5 star with my changes. I increased the baking mix by 1/2 cup and didn't remove water from my veggies. I used fresh basil and dill from my garden instead of parsley. The best addition was that I crumbled up some feta cheese into the mixture. I still used about a full cup of cheddar. Three of us finished two pies in a few hours. Try this with those ever plentiful large zuchinis.

I read several reviews that called this bland, so I made some changes to eliminate that problem.  I sauteed my onion first with minced garlic and added some Italian seasoning.  I upped the zucchini to 3 1/2 cups and also added a cup of shredded carrots.  Because of the extra zucchini, I also added an extra half cup of baking mix.  This was very good- my whole family enjoyed it.  I will add a little salt next time- maybe one half teaspoon.  Thanks for the recipe, Peggy.

The first time I made this, I found the raw onion (shallot in my case) disconcerting...I realize it cooks some in the mixture, but I prefer sauteed...I made this again today and used shallot I'd sauteed in a bit of olive oil. I cut down a bit on the vegetable oil and squeezed as much water as I could out of the zucchini. It was good the first time, but it was WONDERFUL today. I will reheat a slice for breakfasts this week...I'm really looking forward to it! Thanks for a good recipe.

This was a EASY winner.  I would add another 1/4-1/2c. Bisquick next time for a firmer texture.  I did not chop my onions fine and they were still soft but held there shape.  There is no seasoning in this recipe. Salt and pepper would make a favorful difference.  We topped ours with taco sauce.

Great easy recipe!  I subbed 1/3c olive oil for vegtable oil, added garlic, salt an pepper.  Great for a lunch.  Squeeze the water out of your zucchini to avoid a soggy texture.

This is just like my Aunt's recipe for spinach squares, so I made zucchini squares. I baked everything in a 13 x 9 pan, it took about 45 minutes. I used half butter and half oil and cooked the onions first as I do for all casseroles. I also added green onions. Really delicious Farmer's Market meal and 5 thumbs up from the boyfriend too. I will try it will less oil next time to make it a bit healthier.

This was so good!  I sauted the onions along with a couple garlic cloves first.  Instead of parsley I used a little basil, and I added just a tiny bit of prepared horseradish.  Loved it!

I make a dish we call Broccoli Cheese Pie using this combination of ingredients that we love.  Use broccoli chopped small in place of zucchini.  Never thought about changing it up a bit...Thanks!

Like other reviewers, I would add another 1/2 cup of baking mix (see Complete Pancake Mix recipe on this site by Kay King, which is very close to my recipe for home-made biscuit mix) rather than to squeeze the liquid from the zucchini.  In the interest of economy, calories and better nutrition, I usually substitute fat-free cottage cheese or buttermilk for the Parmesan cheese and the oil, but since I like the cheddar flavor, I leave that as called for in the recipe.    This is a very versatile recipe that lends itself to many changes, including substituting spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant or a mixture.  Grated carrot and/or chopped yellow or red bell pepper, and/or chopped black olives can be added for color.  I like to throw in a little nutmeg, salt and pepper.... sometimes lemon pepper.  This is good hot or cold, freezes well.

I have made this twice now, making a few changes the second time. It was good the first time, but I felt it needed a little more flavor. The second time I used 1/3 cup EVOO instead of the vegetable oil; Swiss cheese instead of Parmesan; 1 tsp. dried Italian seasoning instead of fresh parsley; 4 cups of zucchini (squeezed dry), 1 1/2 cups Bisquick; added 1/2 cup of chopped green pepper, minced garlic and 3 slices of chopped bacon. Listening to the other reviews, I sauteed the onion, green pepper and garlic with the chopped bacon first. I baked it in a 13x9 inch baking dish for 45 minutes and topped it with chopped tomatoes. Everyone loved it including my husband who gets pretty tired of zucchini this by this time every year!!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made this a while back and only just commenting. It was missing something; perhaps more zucchini - because the other ingredients only covered up the taste. Good, but not a memorable dish. Probably won't make again.

Using the existing reviews as reference, I used 4 cups shredded zucchini, undrained, but increased the biscuit mix by 1/2 cup. I added salt, pepper, a bit of garlic powder, and fresh basil and parsley. I just put the onion, fresh spices, and a half of a green and red pepper in the food processor after shredding the zucchini (which made short work of any extra chopping). It turned out great and the peppers gave it a bit more colour.

I love this zucchini pie. What a great use for the overabundance of zucchini from my fathers garden. I made a few changes based on the reviews, increased baking mix to 1 1/2 cup (used a high fiber mix), and decreased the oil to 1/4 cup. Turned out wonderful!!! Even my 1 and 3 year old love it!

This is a great easy recipe.  I've made it several times now, and it's very good when I follow the recipe, but also very flexible.  I just include whatever veggies I have in the fridge, and it turns out great.   I have sucessfully used yellow squash, bell peppers, roasted red peppers, and spinach (with the spinach sauteed first so it's not too watery).  If I don't have fresh herbs on hand, I use a dried Italian herb blend.  I don't have two pie pans, so I bake it in a casserole dish.  If I end up with more than 3 cups veggies, I just add a proportional amount of the other ingredients.

This is a great recipe!  It's easy, quick and does a great job of hiding a large amount of zucchini!  I loved the texture and flavor of this dish.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of Bisquick like other suggested, and next time I think I will saute the onions before mixing them in so they aren't as crunchy.  Other than that, this was a great recipe and I will be using it very often!!

Excellent recipe.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of the baking mix and it turned out perfectly.  I served it with sour cream and that was excellent.  I think serving it with gravy would make it into a wonderful side dish similar to stuffing. A very easy recipe to jazz up by adding whatever veggies and seasoning combos you happen to like.

Everytime I make this pie, it disappears!!! Even substituting veggies (brocolli, squash, spinach), it's a winner.   Highly recommended.
