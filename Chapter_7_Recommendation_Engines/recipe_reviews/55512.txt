I have had this cracklin bread several times and each time is an experience in itself.  I have cooked it for several other people and everybody just loves it.  Being from the South it is hard to find any true southern cooking in Lansing, MI until I came across this recipe.  It is very easy to make and does not consume a lot of time.  Will definently make this again very tasty and reminds me of a taste of Alabama very good recipe.

I felt challenged by this recipe.  I generally only go for those with overall 4 or 5-star ratings, but it didn't seem too much to lose if this one didn't work out.  Given the previous review, I increased the amount of buttermilk to 1.75 cups and, accordingly, also increased the cracklin' to 1.5 cups.  This was tasty!  My husband is from the south and grew up on cracklin' bread; he liked it a lot.  We all agree that some jalapeno next time will make this perfect!

Not so good. The batter was so dry that I had to add extra buttermilk to stir it enough to pour it into a pan. As expected, once it was baked it was very, very dry. I didn't like this one at all. Still searching for a good cracklin cornbread recipe...

What an amazing recipe...I did have to use bacon, I had no luck finding Cracklin's in PA...but I fried thick cut, diced bacon until crispy, and I added in some scallions and shredded cheddar cheese!  This went perfect with my Cajun Jambalaya!
