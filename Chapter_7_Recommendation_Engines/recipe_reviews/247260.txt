I followed the recipe as written without changes.  I was skeptical because I'm known for making great lemon bars, but I liked seeing methods different from my own and thought it would be fun to give these a try.  First,  I would like to note that I have hens and used very fresh eggs.  Also, I had organic lemons that I used.  I don't know if that would make a difference for others in taste.  Also, Land O Lakes butter is an excellent butter to use while baking.   I used a coconut oil non stick spray.  Despite the recipe totally being different from my own,  they were almost as good as my recipe (I HAVE to say that, right?).  I personally like to have a 50/50 ratio with lemon bars regarding the cookie versus the lemon filling because the cookie part is just as important in my life.  I give these five stars for taste and because it was great using every day ingredients I had in my house (yes, I had a bag of lemons).  I really enjoyed them.

These were ok. The ratio of crust to lemon filling, IMO is off.  I made it in a 7" x 11" pan as called for in the recipe and the crust was as thick as the filling. I also prefer a bar with more lemon as I found these to be more sweeter than lemony tasting.

Taste was good but lemon to cookie ratio was off.  Too much cookie and the lemon almost seemed to sink into it.

I think the flavor is terrific. Mine did not turn out as they should have. In fact, the filling leaked underneath the foil lining of the pan. (My mistake!!!!)

So, my advice to others is be very careful about lining the making pan. I am going to try this again is a 9"x9" pan because  I préféré  the cookie crust to be a little thicker.

I will say again, although mine were not "présentable", I will make them again because they are not overly sweet and if you like lemon flavor from fresh lemons, you will LOVE thèse.

I made this vegan by substituting butter for vegan butter the nature balance original style (same amount) and substituting the eggs for coconut yogurt (1-1/2 tablespoons per egg) it turned out really yummy also the filling I like quadrupled the lemon juice, I added vanilla, as well as adding more sugar and cornstarch. So bomb! I recommend just messing around and following your instincts!

The lemon bar filling and crust SEPARATELY turned out pretty good, but when they baked together.....They stuck together with a chewy unsatisfying taste.

I want to say, I made these and three crust was hard as a rock. The next day even harder. I checked and rechecked the cornstarch measure. Won't make these again

It's quick and easy, but tastes too strongly of corn starch. I'll try to adapt the recipe next time.

I used coconut oil in place of butter in crust  It gave a nice flavor.  The crust was thin, I should have doubled it

Made these for a dessert booth for church bazaar. Really liked that the bar seems sturdy enough to handle the occasion in which they will be served. Nice flavor; more lemon zest could be added for those liking a tarter lemon bar. Really like the texture of crust; some lemon bars really need to be eaten with a fork. These make a nice addition to a cookie platter. Made recipe exactly as written.

Very tasty and I even made it gluten free. My first time making lemon bars and they are the best that I have ever had. I gave them to my parents and they loved them as well. I would recommend these to a friend.
