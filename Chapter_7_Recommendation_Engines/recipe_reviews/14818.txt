this was a good recipe but we did something a little different. we used frozen shrimp, peeled and diced then stir fried it with garlic, minced celery, butter, and diced onions. the mix was then added to the rest of the ingredients with its sauce. 

the entire dip was the biggest hit of this past thanksgiving's party. it went really good with ritz crackers or any kind of cracker that doesn't have too much salt on it. 

i'll definitely be making this again, and again, and again.

Awesome and extremely easy!  I'll remember this when I need a quick emergency snack for drop-in company. I agree with a previous critic that there may be just a little too much mayonaise in it.  Next time I'll reduce the mayo by maybe 2 tablespoons.  Also, make sure you use fresh or frozen shrimp rather than canned to be assured of that wonderful shrimp flavor.  Great on Triscuits.

I like this recipe.  I  altered it just a bit by using 1/2 the mayo.  Also, I use steamed shrimp, steamed with Old Bay and I add more Old Bay in the mixture.    I'm from Maryland and we use Old Bay in all sorts of seafood recipes.  It gives it a delcious flavor and spices up this delicious and simple recipe.

Truly the "Best Ever"! !   I use only fresh cooked shrimp, none of the fake tasting canned or frozen stuff for me! !  I also use a little more celery & very mild onion than is called for, all chopped very fine.  I think this would be good with crab or clams, too, but haven't tried it yet.

If you are not tasting shrimp, try using only domestic shrimp.  It is wild caught from the ocean, so it has the wonderful shrimp taste and flavor you grew up with.  If you don't ask for wild caught shrimp, you will get farm-raised from a foreign country.  They are mushy and have no flavor.  The recipe was great. Thanks.

I love seafood...especially shrimp.  I originally doubled this recipe and made it for a pool party.  My husband and I ended up not going to the party, but we've been enjoying the shimp dip at home for two days now!!!! It's really tasty!  We've had it with Ritz crackers. I highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this dip twice now, once leaving the shrimp whole, the second time pureeing the shrimp, but each time the dip has no shrimp flavor and merely tastes like mayonnaise and has watery consistency. Thanks anyway!

I used 3/4 C. mayo,  added about 1 tsp. lemon juice, and some dried chives.  Honestly, it needed some color!  Next time I will add Old Bay.  Yum.  Everyone loved it with crackers, sesame sticks and pretzels.  Easy and great appetizer.  Thank you a bunch  :)

I used (1) full lb. frozen, large shrimp, in coarse chunks (those canned tiny shrimp I think are completely tasteless), added Old Bay, green onions, reduced mayo by at least 1/4 as others suggested. Took it to neighborhood Christmas party with crackers and everyone loved it! This was gone by the next day. If you make it with real shrimp, it will not last at your house. This is now my go-to shrimp dip, thanks for sharing!

This dip tastes fantastic.  The problem I had was that it separates when it sits out.  The clumpy was unappealing.

This dip was delicious.  I cooked the shrimp with EVOO, Tastefully Simple Seasoning Salt, and Pepper.  Everyone loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I will be making it again and again.

This is an excellent recipe. We buy shrimp at our local deli and have it steamed with cajun seasoning. We chop shrimp and add to other ingredients. We love it and have shared this recipe with family and friends. Mary Goodenough Fayetteville, TN

I hate to give this a bad review when everyone else loves it, but I did not like this recipe at all. The consistency was too thick and it tasted to much like just plain mayo.

Very good recipe but I made the mistake of using 'light' mayo.  It seperated and was watery.  I put it in a sieve over a bowl and got almost 3/4 C. of liquid drained though.  After the leftovers sat in the fridge another day, I still poured off a bit of liquid. I also chopped the schrimp a bit so it was the same size as the onion and celery.

This was a surprisingly good recipe!! I wasnt sure what to expect. I made sure to cook the shrimp in butter to give it a little more flavor. I also used more cream cheese than mayo. Just make sure to refrigerate before serving. Thanks for the quick and delicious recipe.

Mmmmm. This is really good stuff. Now, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so I'll tell you what I did different: 1 cup minced cooked (not canned) shrimp, 1/4 cup mayonnaise (thats all I had!), and no celery (didn't have any). I just made it a few minutes ago (I was barely able to wait for the shrimp to cool off!) and I'm eating it right now.......probably going to polish off half of it right now.....really good stuff! One could add and subtract from this dip to make it their own. I wasnt too sure I would like this, but it's awesome and lends it's self to customization. I'll use this simple yet wonderful recipe again for sure! So glad I tried this dip. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a tasty, easy and fast dip to make!! I used 2 cans (yes cans) of shrimp, fat free cream cheese, 2 heaping Tbsp of fat free mayo, green onions and Old Bay Seasoning.  Make ahead and let the flavours meld some, delish!!

Sorry, not a fan.  Bland and runny.  Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream as others suggested.  Even tried to add more seasonings and veggies to add flavor.  Didn't work.

What a quick and easy recipe! I agree with others who said the mayo needs to be cut in half. I would also use less cream cheese. Despite that, this dip disappeared fast at my most recent dinner party, and I will definitely be making this again.

Due to a recommendation, I used *1 lb*large-chopped frozen shrimp, and was so glad I did. Otherwise, IMO, there would have been way too much cream cheese mixture for only 8 oz. of shrimp.  Was very good but needed some spice and I agree with using green onion to give it a fresher flavor.

Too much mayonnaise (sp?) for my taste and I am 
a big fan of mayo. since I already had the mayo and 
cream cheese mixture done, I added another 4 ounces 
of cream cheese and took out just over 1/4 of the 
original mix. This made it creamier and less mayo tast
ing.

This is almost just like my grandma's shrimp dip recipe that has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. The only difference is her recipe adds a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and we always used the canned shrimp (tiny or small) which has a much better flavor than the regular cocktail shrimp. Yum!

This won rave reviews at my New Year's party, but it wouldn't have without a few alterations I made.  I added a tsp of fresh dill weed, about a 1/2 tsp lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.  I served it inside cucumber cups.  What a hit!

I loved this recipe! When I first made this I didnt realize the shrimp was part of the dip so I used it as an actual dip for my shrimp. Luckily it turned out even better! I cooked the shrimp on olive oil added salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.

I made this with fresh shrimp and brought to a party. Everyone loved it and now I am asked for my "secret" recipe all the time.The only thing I added was red pepper on top and that was just for looks.  Now for every party this is all I bring and its ALWAYS the hit of the party.

Waste of shrimp! This recipe has too much mayonnaise in it which totally drowns out the flavor of the shrimp. What a date night disappointment!

I would not make this again.  It was a waste of ingredients.  It ended up tasting like mayonnaise.  I had to doctor it up to be able to eat it so I was not wasting groceries.

Great recipe and I made minor modifications like the rest of the reviewers.  Used fresh shrimp (1 lb) which I cooked with some butter, garlic, onion and old bay. When done, put cooked shrimp mixture in  food processor to chop shrimp a bit.  Added that mixture to cream cheese, finely chopped celery, mayo / sour cream, dash of Worcester sauce and lemon juice. Let sit in fridge overnight. Came out really delicious!

I just added dill, red pepper and Old Bay Seasoning to suit our own taste preferences.  Had it for a book club meeting and it was such a hit! None leftover! Boo-hoo for me and hubby...guess I'll have to just make another batch for us!

I loved this recipe.  I made a few slight changes.  I boiled the shirmp, strained them and added some Old Bay Seaoning and Seasoning Salt.  I mixed about 9-10oz of the cream cheese spread with 2 tablespoons of mayonaise and some diced onions.  I cut the shrimp into small pieces and mixed it in.  After getting really scared about the possibilites of a bad outcome, I just dove in and added the Ritz crackers as a side item and it turned out great.  I do not think that I would like it too cold though.

Made it according to recipe but I agree with others, it was too much mayo.  So I added a bit of season salt and tabasco sauce which gave it some better flavor. Next time I will use less mayo and maybe try some lemon juice and chives. It definitely needs a little something.

This was a very quick and easy dip to make and was very well liked. One thing I added was a touch of garlic and next time I will cut the shrimp up into smaller pieces.

But, yes, I will be making this dip again!

I thought this was just ok, rather than the hit I hoped for.  Had trouble blending the mayo and cream cheese.  Could still taste clumps of each.  Didn't add celery as I don't like the taste.

A very hearty, super rich dip. Loved it. Couple of notes, I did add old bay seasoning as another had suggested and that cut the richness and I used fat free Greek yougurt as we don’t like mayo in dips. Also, you need sturdy chips!  Ritz crackers or Triscuits would be good. My Tostito chips were breaking up. Will definitely make again.

Very good and easy to make! Too much mayo for us, though. Next time I'll only put in 1/2 cup of mayo. We added some lemon juice with Tabasco chipotle sauce too! I will definitely make it again

This dip was a hit!! It's awesome as is! I sauteed my shrimp in olive oil with garlic, white wine, and lemon juice. The dip definitely needs time in the fridge to let the flavors come together. So tasty!

This recipe may work just fine as is however, I made several minor changes and it worked very well. It is a huge hit around our house. As mentioned by many other reviewers, I used slightly less than half the Mayo, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, substituted the Cream Cheese with half Greek Yogurt and half Neufchatel cheese and doubled the shrimp using freshly caught NC White Shrimp. Gotta love having a father that owns a Shrimp boat - Thanks Pop!
