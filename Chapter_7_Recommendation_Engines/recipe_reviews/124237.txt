This is the BEST chicken EVER. I have to admit the marinade smelled very sweet so I only made a small batch, but when I tasted the chicken it did not taste sweet at all. Everyone RAVED about the taste and since I made a small amount, everyone started to fight over the last piece. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I already handed this out to all my coworkers.

Easy to prep, great tasting recipe with very little modification if any needed.  If you are looking for a new taste to grilled chicken that has a zest but is not too spicy I would highly recommend this.

I made this with both chicken breasts and tofu. I marinated both overnight and grilled them the next day. It smelled great making the marinade, but I was a little concerned it would be too sweet. It wasn't sweet at all though! It smelled great on the grill and tasted even better. I served it over pasta.

This was amazing!  Marinated it overnight, then grilled.  It was very moist and had a great tang that I haven't ever tasted on chicken.  We will be making this a lot!

This chicken was very good, and I didn't change anything about it. An easy, quick recipe so since my whole family liked it I'm sure I will be making it again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was going to be quite spicy, but there wasn't a lot of heat. There was, however, a lot of flavor and I'll be throwing this one on the grill a lot this summer.

This was delicious!  I made it according to the recipe....(well, I used chopped red onions, but other than that. )  Just that perfect sweet but tangy taste.

This is very good chicken.  I used 2tbsp of sweet onion chopped, because that is what i had on hand.  Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I let the chiken sit for 2 1/2 hours and then grilled it.  I will definately make this one again.

This recipe is really great! I was afraid it would be too tart with all the lime juice and vinegar but it was perfect!  One word of caution, the curry will turn your plastic bowls yellow... :-)  The chicken had a nice tangy flavor to it though; great grilled with some pineapple! I served it on shish-kabobs! It was a huge hit!

This was simple to make and gave the chicken a lot of flavor.  I marinated for 4 hours and didn't change anything else.  A definite keeper.

Not too spicy and not too sweet . . . just full of flavor. The only change I made was instead of chicken breasts, I used a whole fryer chicken cut up into pieces. It was great!
