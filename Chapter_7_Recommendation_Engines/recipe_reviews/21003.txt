This was a great recipe.   If you don't have garam masala, you can make it yourself.  Just look up garam masala in the encyclopedia here and use those spices.

I would recommend adding more vegetables, and not adding them until about halfway through the cooking time.  Otherwise the veggies are total mush by the end.

This was really good!  The spices/seasonings were just right.  My husband who has never had Indian food really liked this.

Really good. Instead of regular onion, I used green onion that I already had cut up. I hadn't bought Basmati rice, so I used brown rice and adjusted the cook time accordingly. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I used vegetable out of a stir fry mix, which had baby corn, red pepper, peapods and bamboo shoots-- not entirely Indian vegetables, but good nonetheless. I did not add them until the last 15 minutes of cook time. I think I may play around with the spices a bit next time, but this is still tasty.

A very nice spiced rice, if nothing particularly special or exciting.  I am a vegetarian college student and so I am always looking for quick, easy, and cheap main dishes.  This one fits the bill.  I will definitely be keeping it around.

variations:
I used a little over a cup of frozen peas and corn, and added them after the rice had been cooking about 10 minutes.  I also left the pieces of onion quite large.
I added another 1/4 tsp of cumin and some ground black pepper.
This works equally well with short-grain rice.

This had a really good, almost sweet flavor (could have been the type of onion I used) and was a nice contrast to Curry Chicken.  The only problem I encountered was that the cooking time was too long.  Had I not checked the pot, I might have burned the rice!  Good recipe, overall!  If you have more Indian dishes, please submit them!

It was great however, next time i would use less water, maybe just 13/4 cups, use 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of garam masala since i'll like the spices to show more, will maybe even add a stick of cinnamon.  Will make it again for sure!

Made exactly as indicated in recipe. Results were very good. Was a great side dish for Indian Butter Chicken and Naan bread. Will absolutely make this recipe again.

This was pretty good.  I agree it's a little bland but I understand it's usually accompanied by a saucy entree so it probably is a perfect side dish.  On it's own would be bland.  I'm thinking of adding more spices next time and mixing in the vegetables AFTER the rice is done cooking.  I didn't like how the veggies turned a dull brownish color after cooking - I'd prefer a brighter color.  Overall, would make again.

Tasty, but definitely needed something.  I added more spices and vegetables and my family liked it, though I felt it was a little bland.

Wonderful, flavorful rice!  I took the advice given by others and did not add my veggies until about half way thru the cooking.  Also, cut back on the cooking time.  25 minutes is too long!

Good! I did use home-make chicken broth instead of water. Used my own veggies peas/carrots and corn. I also doubled the cumin, garam masala and added a cinnamon stick. Put a few caradom pods in there also. With these changes 5 stars. As is, 4 bec I did make this prior. This is now my go to Indian rice recipe. Thanks.

This is decent.  It definitely needs more spice and I would serve it as a side rather than a main dish.  It's a little boring on its own.

This was a pretty simple and tasty dish. I didn't have rice, but I had couscous and it made a good swap. Went well with the tandoori chicken recipe on this site

While not terribly flavourful on it's own, this is an excellent side dish. I served it with pan-fried salmon marinated with lemon juice, cumin, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala and chili powder, with some raita on the side. This combo was perfect. I might make it again to serve with a creamy curry. I used a rice cooker instead - I combined the ingredients on the stove, the poured it into the rice cooker. I also doubled the veggies. Next time, I'll add the veggies in halfway through cooking as I prefer them still bright and colourful, not dull and grey. The onions are essential I think (I used yellow ones). They add a lovely sweetness to the dish. As a side dish, this serves 4.

With a few changes we really enjoyed this as an addition to our dinner - following some other suggestions I increased the garam masala to 3/4 tsp.  Also, I added the mixed veggies at the 10 minute cooking mark.  The total cooking time was 30 minutes and the rice was great.  A keeper...

A nice simple rice to use when pairing with something more spicy/flavorful. I would maybe double the spice, and note that this is for 2 servings only.

This was wonderful!  I wouldn't say it was bland though, like some other reviewers said.  It wasn't super flavorful, but then again, it's made to be served with sauce (I think).  I made it with Makhani Chicken and the sauce complemented the rice nicely.  Even my super picky 5 and 4 year old sons ate it!  I'll definitely make it again.

This is a great side dish if you are making a main course or fabulous as a meal in itself.  I have made this recipe time and time again and even my 3 year old loves it.  The flavors are amazing.

Made my own garam masala a recipe from this website. It is a no frills recipe.
Probably would make again.

Quite good, especially with some plain yogurt with it.  I served this with the Indian Barbequed Chicken and sauteed eggplant.  Very good.

A nice rice dish, but somewhat plain.  I followed Jenn G.'s suggestion and increased the cumin and put the veggies in after 10 minutes of cooking.  Rice cooked perfectly, but seasoning was rather mild.  Tasted great with the channa masala and naan I served, but I would rather have had something that really resembled Indian cooking.

This Indian Vegetable Rice is so yummy and it just gets better the next day and the next.  I probably could eat it for breakfast on the fourth day too!

This is a good style pilaf. It comes off well with the garam masala and frozen mixed vegetables. I serve this with many Indian recipes from this website.

Really good!  Used more veggies than recipe called for. Goes well with tandoori chicken and a yogurt sauce.

It was an easy recipe to follow and tastes great. My family loved it. The only change was that I added the vegetables at the half way point when the rice was cooking to avoid it being too soft, but they were already thawing so I guess if frozen then it would be fine at the beginning of boiling the rice

Delicious!  Whole family loved it including husband who thinks he doesn’t like cumin and two young children.  Made it 6 days ago and I’m making it again already!  Going to try adding eggs this time towards the end.

I have yet to find an Indian biryani recipe - which is basically what this is - that I like online, though I love biryani in restaurants. This recipe is bland and boring, and I even doubled the spices (except the salt). I'll keep looking.

Thank you! I was looking for a simple rice recipe that provided flavour. Got it! Thanks to you. However, I did not add frozen vegetables - I had beans steaming on top of the rice :) The rice was 'stickier' than I expected, but very flavourful. Thanks!

I served this rice with Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari) from allrecipe.com.  It was a perfect complement to the entree.  Everyone went back for seconds and even third helpings.  Instead of frozen mixed veggies, I used frozen peas and carrots.  It did not take the full 25-30 min to cook the rice but could be because I used a large sautee pan instead of a taller saucepan.  I made my own garam masala from what I had in the dry spice cabinet (cumin, coriander, crushed cloves, pepper, dry mustard, and red pepper flakes).  I used peanut oil instead of veg oil.

This was okay :( I was slightly disappointed. I felt as if the dish was missing something.

taste is not overpowering but still good! Substituted frozen veggies with chopped red and green peppers. Kiddies loved it!   Served with with Slow Cooker Butter Chicken (I did not use the slow cooker!)
