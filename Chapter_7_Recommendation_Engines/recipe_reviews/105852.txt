Tried these last night and they turned out great! Instead of doing individual packets I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and bought an 8x8 throw away aluminum foil baking pan.  Mixed them up in a bowl and dumped them in the pan and covered it with foil.  Put them on the grill for 25 minutes and they were done.  Very good and easy to make - will make again!

We have cooked this twice now, and it can be tricky.  The first time, we did a test run before we went camping and cooked it on the gas grill.  We substituted yellow onions with green onions and substituded cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken soup, and add more cheese than the recipe calls for.  The packet we tested after 20 minutes still had raw potatoes and took 40 minutes to cook.  The other two packets we didn't test, and, what I didn't realize at the time was my husband had cooked the other two packets over direct heat, cooking them faster and they were burned by the time we caught it (after 40 minutes).  The burning was our fault.

The second time we cooked this when we went camping.  We skipped stirring the ingredients in a bowl.  After spraying both sides of tin foil with olive oil non-stick spray, we just compiled the ingredients directly on the tin foil.  (We were tent camping and wanted as few dishes to wash as possible.)  We again substitued green onions with yellow onions and cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken soup, and added more cheese than the recipe calls for.  We didn't use any butter.  We layered the potatoes and onions and kind of tossed with our clean hands, then added the rest of the ingredients.  We cooked over charcoal briquettes in a camp fire, but had to add some pieces of kindling occasionally to keep the fire hot enough to cook.  We cooked the packets for about 30 minutes, and they were perfect, not burned at all but cooked well.

This recipe is a staple for us while camping.  Little fuss, little muss!  We rotate back and forth between cream of mushroom and chicken soup depending on what's grilling...  HELPFUL HINT: To cook a little faster precook your potatoes, but do not slice them until you are ready to cook - this saves on propane or briquettes.  Or buy the Simply Potatoes which are already pre-sliced and ready to go.  Great timesaving steps!!!

This is a good recipe.  I changed mine up... made it a little differently.  I used frozen diced potatoes, diced onion & green pepper, cheddar cheese soup, butter, garlic, medium sharp cheddar, sea salt, garlic, paprika, fresh cracked pepper, parsley & foil over an 8x8 baking pan on the grill.  Everybody loved it.  Thanks! :)

AWSOME!!!  These are fantastic!!!  I have tried doing potatoes several different ways on a campfire and they have never come out good until now!  I wasn't sure how we would know when they were done well, but the soup creates steam and the foil packs began to inflate.  When that starts to happen they are done. I cooked these first and then pulled them off and cooked our chicken, which also took a while.  These were still piping hot when we unwrapped them even after sitting all that time.  My suggestion would be to cook these first.  As they sit the flavors blend together better!  The only change I made was that I had no cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken.  Even my finicky three year old LOVED them!!!

Fantastic flavor and wonderful addition to campfire meals. I only wish we'd brought more ingredients so we could make them again. We used 2.5 really large potatoes.

This tastes great!!!! I I put heavy duty tin foil in a retangular baking dish and layered all of the ingredients, except the cheese...folded it up (poked 2 steam holes in top of foil)and baked for about 40 min. or so at 350...The time depends on how large or small the potato's are diced..The smaller the dice, the less cooking time...then I opened the package, springkled the cheese on top -- along with some grated parmesean cheese and let it bake a little longer until the cheese was melted and bubbly...The flavors are really terrific, and no messy cleanup -- just serve and toss the foil.

If you find that your potatoes (or anything else cooked in tinfoil) try layering tinfoil, wet news paper and tinfoil again.  It really helps to keep food from burning!

My bf and I thought these were great! I peeled and thinly sliced the potatoes and cut the slices in half. I highly recommend the medium heat as they will burn on the bottom if the coals are too hot. These were perfect in about 15 minutes. Also, make sure to grease the inside of the foil really well. Next time I will try Cream of Chicken soup and add the green onions. TIP: Try sprinkling a little powdered parmesan on the potatoes once they are off the grill, wonderful!

Excellent recipe!  I love scallop potatoes but I hate the sticky mess they make in pans so this is such a time and labor saver not to mention they taste wonderful!  Didn't change a thing!  Thanks!

Excellent, easy recipe. I cooked them in the oven at 400 for about 40 minutes. I let them cool for a bit and then packed them in tin foil, will reheat for camping tomorrow (I thought it would be easier to pre-cook them rather than mess around later). I would making these again to take camping or as an every day side dish.

Grilling potatoes on the grill is nothing new for us, and adding cheese and onions and bacon has always been nice additions. However I never added a can of soup, not a fan of canned soups, but I did have a can of Campbell's Healthy request mushroom soup in the pantry. So I tried it...and wow was that a wonderful addition, the soup really adds a wonderful creaminess to the regular cheesy potatoes. I used red potatoes, sliced thin, cooked for an hour on the grill over indirect heat in a foil pan. Comes out perfect and taste is out of this world. We will be doing this again and again. Guess I need to stock up on that soup. Thanks Rebecca for the recipe submission.

This is a great recipe.  I find that instead of dicing the potatoes that slicing them works best.  I also use one aluminum pan covered with foil and add the cheese at the end of cooking.

TEN STARS Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, only reducing it to feed two adults with one giant potato.  I did slice the potato thin instead of diced.  I used real bacon (from the jar!) and did not have any mushrooms to add (but it would be good to add them!).  I sprayed a tin foil pan then added the mixture (and topped with a little bit more cheddar then sprinkled a little bit of parmesan cheese) and covered tightly with foil.  The grill was still too hot but I was hungry so I just kept a careful watch, turning the pan around every 4 minutes or so.  It was on the grill for 30 -45 minutes and was wonderfully cooked all the way through with a little crunch on the bottom, but not burned.  It was really a treat to have scalloped potatoes without turning on the oven on a hot summer day!  Thank you Rebecca for a wonderful addition to the rotation!

Made these today on my gas grill, would rate 5 stars for taste however I cooked these for over an hour. I thought I was going to run out of propane. Potatoes were still hard. Had to nuke these to soften up after all that so I would microwave just the potatoes prior to grilling as to help them cook in a normal amount of time.

These were GREAT!  I fully expected the cheese to make a horrific mess and didn't think 20 minutes would be long enough to cook the potatoes through.  I was wrong the cooking time was just right and the cheese didn't burn.  They were absolutely delicious.  We served with brats, corn on the cob and a tossed salad.  Thanks!

We cooked these when we went camping and I must say, they were pretty good!  In order to avoid burning it, we double foiled it using the extra long aluminium foil, heavy duty kind.  So basically two very long sheets, instead of the 8 seperate ones.  Placed directly in the coals and it cooked up nicely!  Very good recipe!  Will use again when we go camping!

I would have given four stars but only two of the five packets we made turned out. I was lucky enough to get one and thought the taste was really good--would have been even better with the optional sauteed mushrooms. The rest of the packets burned so bad that it was embarrassing.

This recipe was delicious.  I did it on the grill, and it was perfect!  I would like to take the ingredients with when we camp next.  I didn't change anything, and I can't think of anything I would change anyway!

Loved this!  I mixed everything in a bowl and then cooked it on the grill in a heavily greased (with Pam) foil pan covered tightly with more foil.  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom soup.  My husband, who normally doesn't eat potatoes, had several helpings.  We finished the whole thing in one meal!

When my picky husband says something is good ... its good!  We grill alot and this recipe is perfect and can be changed up to suit your taste.  I had cream of chicken soup on hand and used it with some onion powder instead of the garlic.  I did not use the green onion, butter or optional ingredients and it was delicious, easy to make and cleaned up with no effort.  Foil must be sprayed with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Thank you for sharing.

I cut the recipe way down for the two of us and made just two packets. Only ingredient I didn't have was the mushrooms (but might use them next time). These came out just great. Best part was that on a hot,humid day the entire dinner was on the grill! Love it and will be making these all summer long.

So good! I used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom and added in the optional bacon. It was DELICIOUS! However, I had to cook these longer on the grill for them to be done. The taste was amazing!

Superb!  I wasn't cooking on the grill the night I craved this recipe, so I cooked the potatoes in a baking dish.  It worked out perfectly.  The only change I made was that I didn't use mushrooms, but I did sprinkle shredded cheese on top near the end of cooking.  I'll use this recipe again for sure.

This was a perfect side dish on a very hot Philly day.  Cooked it on the gril, on lower rack for about 22 minutes.  The Adults and kids both loved them.  Don't forget the oil on the tin foil like I did.  It took me a little more time to remove them from the foil.  I'm going to try them again after a day at the pool......... ye hee hee...

Very nice. I got mine ready for the grill but we had issues and ended up putting them in the oven. These were devoured. I plan on making these again!

I was looking for something to have with grilled steak and these were perfect.  Quick and easy to prepare and cooking time was short so we could cook everything at the same time.  I used the "optional" ingredients and added crumbled bacon and sauteed mushrooms.  I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and a little red salt.  We cooked them for 20 minutes but I think a couple of minutes less would have been better.  Definite hit in our house and we'll make them again.

This is awesome! I didn't have cheddar so I used what I had at the time (Colby ) and reduced the butter by a 3rd and turn out great. This will be a go to side!

Great recipe!  This was an easy way to make homemade scalloped potatoes.  I made it when I had way too many lbs of potatoes and it was a great hit.  I had to go and buy more potatoes to make more for the family.  :)

I loved this recipe! It met and exceeded my expectations as to what it would taste like. I have tried many variations of scalloped potatoes but these are at the top of my list. Definitely will make these again.

I made this in a tin pan and ended up only needed 5 potatoes.  I sliced the potatoes thin.  Left out the butter completely as I forgot.  Before serving I put more shredded cheese on top.  I cooked this over a camp fire and everyone LOVED it!  Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious – everyone loved it and rated it 5 stars immediately.    I omitted the mushrooms and took a page out of America’s Test Kitchen tips by zapping the potatoes in the microwave first to get a head start.  In the future I will use heavy duty tin foil and flip it because it did burn on the bottom.  This is a great side dish which is perfect for a hot day when you don’t want to use the stove.

We forgot to bring mushrooms and used all the bacon at breakfast (d'oh!) so I found this to be pretty bland without it.  It was easy and interesting, but pretty blah so I will definitely try it again with the bacon and mushrooms next time.

These were quite tasty.  My fiance loved them!  I scaled down the amount of potato for just the two of us, but left the cheese/sauce mix the same as published. Instead of dicing the potatoes, I sliced them into coins, and they needed longer to cook than this recipe called for. Very yummy. However, I made the mistake of using just one foil packet.  Next time I will either use individual packets as directed, or go with what another person said and use a foil baking pan covered with foil.  Why make the dehydrated boxed kind when you can make these?  It's a keeper for sure.

These were AMAZING!!  I was only cooking for two, so as others suggested, I just mixed everything up in an 8x8 throw-away aluminum cake pan and covered with foil.  This worked very nicely, as I could easily peek and poke to see if the potatoes were done yet, and there was no mixing bowl to clean when I was done.  I scaled down to 2 potatoes sliced in circles and used half a can of cream of mushroom, but did not skimp on the cheese or mushrooms at all.  In fact, I used 2 cups of cheese instead of just 1, and it worked out perfectly for us, but then we LOVE cheese.  This dish is incredibly versatile, and could be easily dressed up by tossing in different garnishes, but it's perfectly fine all on its own.  I'm thinking I could even make it an entire meal by tossing in ground beef or some smoked sausages and maybe even some veggies .  If you go the aluminum pan route, do not forget to spray with cooking spray before dumping everything into it!  These were done in about 15 minutes on my charcoal grill, but this particular batch of charcoal was burning much hotter than normal, so it might have taken more like 25-30 mins under normal  circumstances.  Can't wait to try them in camp!

Made this while camping.  This was the BEST potato dish I have EVER made.  My partner begged me to make it again......not once but several times.  I served it with sour cream and it was absolute heaven (if you don't think about the calories you are consuming.....).  Highly HIGHLY recommended.....

Really nice change of pace with potatoes on the grill.  I used 3 Russets ( 8 would too many for us ) and used an aluminum pan with raise ribs in it like a broiler pan . ( It was a single use pan I buy at my grocery store that works great on my grill.) Would make it again but would add more cheese …….. too much is not enough are my words to live by !

Made for girls' camping weekend - prepped the sauce ahead of time, sliced potatoes and put in foil when we were ready to eat.  I would strongly suggest spraying oil/butter on the foil before wrapping to avoid all the good stuff sticking to the foil.  I also cooked "upside down" for the first 10 minutes or so, to make sure the potatoes on the bottom were soft.  And I used bacon bits instead of "real" bacon and chives in place of green onion but everything else was the same and this was so easy and delicious!

I made this recipe this evening, and it is no longer in my favorites.  Read the warnings about cooking times, kept that in mind while cooking everything else, and the potatoes were still not soft after one hour.   The potatoes were eventually presented and there was a lackluster response.

I used a disposable aluminum pan instead of making individual packets. Because there was no room on the grill I used the oven. Otherwise I used the ingredients as listed, and because I have made this type of casserole before I planned for a longer cooking time. Everyone liked the potatoes, but I thought they were a little bland. I will make it again adjusting the seasoning to suit my taste.

This recipe is perfect for me.  I use a wood cook stove for all my baking and cooking. Unless it is summer and we have a fire on the outdoor grill. The only thing I did different was omit the mushrooms... the grocery store is 30 minutes away, on snowy back roads! Otherwise, the dish was marvelous. I was happy to find this unique and tasty dish on this site. Potatoes can be so very boring, hence the reason we eat a lot of rice dishes. A refreshing change to the ordinary! Will definitely make it again, next time I manage to get to the grocery store through all this snow and ice! Thanks for sharing!

You need to:
- Add bacon bits
- Slice potatoes into slivers and rotate potato, onion, potato, onion
- Keep top bent over so you can rotate left to right and check to make sure they aren't burned
- cream of chicken or chicken stock works well

These potatoes turned out amazing! I had to find a potato recipe that take up room in my oven so I tried this & let me tell you, I will ALWAYS make these in the future. Here are the few changes I made to suit my needs. I found I only needed (& could only fit) 4 large potatoes, thinly sliced, instead of 8. However, they were russet potatoes & very large. Instead of only using cheddar I used half sharp cheddar & half pepper jack for a nice little kick. I also used 4 garlic cloves finely chopped. I didn't use the mushrooms. I put the entire mixture in a large foil pan covered with foil (but not before sprinkling a little extra cheese on top of course). Then I placed on the grill, medium heat for 40 minutes. They came out bubbly & perfectly cooked!

delicious!  Cut down on the amount of butter (used only 1/4 cup)- the potatoes may have stuck a little more because of it, but the taste was not affected.

I first tried this recipe while we were stationed in Italy and all the displaced Americans loved it. I've made it several time since and have been asked to the recipe every time. I've found it also works to place the packets in a moderate oven when the weather doesn't cooperate outside!

Excellent!  I have shared this recipe with several friends who loved it just as much as I did.
