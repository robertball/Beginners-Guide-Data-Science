Thanks for the recipe Lola.  I found that more water was needed for the rice flour - close to one cup.  I also rolled the buchi in untoasted sesame seeds prior to frying (that is how I remember it from the chinese restaurants in Manila).  I also used red mung (monggo) beans cooked in syrup and mushed them up (I wanted to find it in paste, but only found the whole beans - it is also a halo-halo ingredient!)  This is a good reference if I can't find the red mung beans in syrup, the dried, green mung beans are more readilly available.  Thanks again!

I love buchi and it was nice to find a recipe on here for it! I've used a red mung bean paste in the past for the filling, but the green mung beans were delicious too! I too rolled the buchi in sesame seeds for added crunch before frying them. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the recipe; I love Buchi.  Had to add enough water to make it more like a Play Aough consistency.  Also rolled them in sesame seeds.  My problem was that they popped with cracking while frying...hot oil went everywhere.  Can you tell me why that happened?  Has anyone ever tried to bake them?

I am excited to try this recipe!
When I was a kid my mom would buy these from one of the local markets. In her country it was a version of what they called a Filipino donut. Very yummy!
