This definitely is a "lighter" version of a wonderful classic recipe! I opted to put the seasonings and flour in a bag to coat the chicken. After frying it in some Land O Lakes light buter, I removed the chicken from the pan while making the sauce. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and sauteed them with a bit of minced garlic. I used all Marsala wine for the sauce along with the chicken broth and added a little browning sauce along with a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. It turned out great! Perfect served with roasted potatoes and asparagus!

This was very good but I'm not exactly sure what makes it healthier than any other Chicken Marsala. I didn't use the oregano because I forgot to add it (oops) and I did use 1/2 grapeseed oil and 1/2 butter only because my butter seems to burn too quickly if I don't add a little oil with it. I also used all Marsala wine because I didn't have red on hand. I used about 1/2 - 3/4 cup Marsala because it needed a bit more flavor than the 1/4 cup (combined wines) gave it. Could be because I didn't use the red? Sherry is mentioned in the directions but not in the ingredient list so I didn't use it. Very tasty dish that I will be sure to make again.

Made it for the in-law family and they liked it.  I oven fried the chicken and substitute chicken broth with white wine.  Where is the sherry in the ingredient list?  It just show up in the direction though.

My whole family is in LOVE with this recipe. MY daughter is constantly asking me,  can you make chicken marsala, chicken marsala? This is her favorite dish I make. We all love it and it is so simple to make. Both of my children aren't huge fans of mushrooms so I just take them off before I serve it to them. I would definitely recomend this meal to anyone.

For a healthier version, this is very good. It is definitely a light marsala, so if you're looking for a true marsala chicken, this isn't it. However, it is tasty. I quadrupled the sauce (we like sauce), and added some more mushrooms.

I decided to follow the recipe this time but the first time I added more Marsala, more mushrooms and more butter skipping the sherry and the red wine.  It was much better but of course this is a "light" recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to double the sauce mixture of wine and sherry because the first round we made was not enough to cover our chicken.  Other than that the recipe tasted great.  I would def make it again!

This is a wonderful dish, only it doesn't re-heat very well.  Not near as yummy once it is re-heated...

This was great and I followed it almost to the tea (not my usual m.o.! It was yummy and very flavorful .. I may have added a little more wine and sherry than it called for which ended up making a bit of a thicker sauce when it all boiled down.

Make this about twice a month, I follow the recipe and it turns out very well.   Easy to make and its a one pan dish, great for the motor coach when we travel.

We all liked it a lot.  I added a bit more oregano, also wine to jazz it up a bit.
