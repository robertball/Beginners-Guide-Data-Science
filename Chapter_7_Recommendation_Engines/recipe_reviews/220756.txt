Great flavor! I do think the bratwurst need cut into more manageable pieces. I actually did this in my Instant Pot and it worked great. Saute the onions and brats first, then add everything else, lock the lid and set manual pressure for 15 minutes.

Made it  with no changes to the ingredients, but I cooked in my dutch oven as I got started cooking late in the day and wanted it quicker.  Browned the brats, then the veggies and added the brats back in with the rest of the ingredients.  Super easy, and quick to assemble.  My family loved it.  I thought it was pretty tasty.  I think I will add a little hot pepper flakes to mine next time.  I think it would work with some kind of spicy smoked sausage as well.  I might try that next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe! Great flavor! Easily adjustable in terms of what vegetables you want to add. I added a green and red pepper. My fiancée really enjoys it as well!

Excellent recipe.   Different flavors and textures complimentary  

Followed the recipe and was good as is. Might add red and yellow peppers  next go around. Did not thicken with flour and probably won't next time.  Don't like glowing reviews and am critical of most recipes but this one was an all around winner.

I needed a recipe to use up some sausages I had on hand and I needed a hearty meal to serve the whole family for lunch.  No time to cook in the morning so I threw all of this into my crock pot just before bed, left it on low till noon the next day when we served it up with some good bread from a local bakery. Everyone raved over it! 


I used half bratwurst and half Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand. I cut them into 6 pieces each so they'd be a little closer to bite sized.  Other than that I did it just as the recipe calls for.  Oh, except I stirred the flour into some of the broth and didn't add the extra cup of water.
