Great Recipes I changed a few things though I add and extra 1cup of grain Alcohol and an extra .5cup of vodka (WE LIKE IT REALLY STRONG) I also put a cinnamon stick and half a vanilla bean in each jar before bottling. One other thing due to the alcohol Content being so high you can store them at room temp... thanks for a great recipe everyone enjoys this stuff...

I've been making apple pie for about 5 years now. I prefer to use applied cider vs apple juice, but that's just me. 
A few times I have sliced apples and put them in the mason jars when I fill them.....it's like eating the tequila worm, very high alcohol content. Lol

Also, as a few have said, due to the high alcohol content, you do not need to refrigerate, I'd advise not to. If you you open a jar and don't finish it,then yes refrigerate it or it will go bad. 

During my years I've found that the longer it sits.....the better it gets. I let mine sit for a min of 3 months in my storage area before drinking it. I have a few that I still have left that are just over a year old and opened one the other day.....holy cow! Very great taste and we'll aged....yummy!

This fall I'm going to get one of those 30qt turkey fryers for outside and going to try making large batches and furthering my experimenting.  

When I bottle, I put 1-2 sticks in and sometimes some sliced apples.  If you have a filter or strainer that helps take out alot of the "floaties".  

Also try this- instead of mixing the alcohol in the pot, put some in the jars first,  and then pour the cooled cider into the jars. That way it will be easier to tell just how much alcohol is in your jars instead of guessing. Try it with different levels and strengths, find your sweet spot. :)

Hope this helps alot of people.

My hubby, Mitch, made this recipe! Only gave it 4 stars because we did not add the white sugar! Thought it would make it too sweet for our tastes. We didn't miss it! It was great! You can serve this hot or cold! We tried both and it's great as a hot toddy if you have the flu! Just warm a bit before bed, sip it and get a great nights sleep! ;)

This is delicious! Since a 750 mL bottle of Everclear comes out to a little more than 3 cups, I just used it all.  Other than that - made the recipe exactly & it tastes awesome!  The alcohol content is about 30% (you can barely taste it), so I might try it again with a little more Everclear to get it closer to 40% and a little more kick.

Wow, the flavor is awesome!!!  I used less alcohol than what it called for, but imagine if I did.  I kinda ran out because I made another apple pie moonshine from this site.  I don't mind it being strong; I'm just making this as xmas gifts for my dad and father-in-law and wanted the alcohol to be subtle.  I found some good and cheap apple juice and unfiltered one from Trader Joes.  Get both the organic ones if you decide to go there.  The only thing I left out was the clove.  Also, here in California, we're only able to purchase 151 proof.  I'm going to age this for a week or two then I'll give an update.

This was delicious, easy to prepare, and indeed quite strong.  I made so much that I was able to take some of the excess to a party, where it was very much a hit.

This is a great base recipe. I add nutmeg and more cloves, and a third of a vanilla bean in the pot. Also this time i added four minced apples to steep. Also i simmer for two hours to get the deeper flavors. Also I double the recipe and add a total of 5 fifths, four bottles of everclear, and one of decent vanilla vodka. Then add the cinnamon stick and vanilla bean to each jar.

Very good recipe! I've made it two years in a row for fall and football season. Couple things tho I did change... no vanilla vodka, no clove (didn't have any) and I doubled the recipe. I put it in mason jars and let set for a couple weeks and it gets real good! (:  Also I added actual moonshine cause you really can't call it moonshine without it! Lol so between that and the ever clear you have to really watch how much you drink.... :-)

I made a batch last night and I suggest using a home made apple pie spice when you heat it up and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The spice is 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 Teaspoons ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground cardamom.  Just make sure too filter when you poor into jars.  
 is in point.

Made this last night.  So good!  Didn't want to make any expensive purchases, so I substituted what I had on hand.  Captain Morgan for the Everclear and plain vodka vs. vanilla.  Added powdered vanilla bean into the apple mixture.  Tasted just like apple pie filling!

I made it just as written I would have rated it higher but it was way too much of alcohol taste for me. I may be a light weight too when it comes to liquor. It smells really good and does taste somewhat like apple pie.

Been making this recipe for about 3 years now and have tried different vodka's and different apple juices but I just noticed the last word in the recipe, "refrigerate". I have never done that last word. I've always made the batch, bottled it and stuck it away in the closet for at least six weeks.  Gets a little stronger with age, taste great and everyone I share with says its the best they've ever had.  Once I open a jar, then it goes into the fridge.

OUTSTANDING. Used authentic moonshine, organic apple juice, organic cider, and instead of the vanilla vodka we added 1 T. organic vanilla and one cup of filtered water since our 'shine has some kick. :-)  We didn't want to add commercial spirits since it was so authentic already.  WILL MAKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!

I've given this away as Christmas gifts for a few years now, and everyone, to include me, loves it. I split a whole nutmeg and steep along with the clove and cinnamon stick. I usually make a double batch and have a little bit of a large bottle of Everclear and vodka left over, so I just dump it right in. I know a lot of people consider this recipe to be too strong, but it's fine to me. You should REALLY sip this, 'cause if you don't, it'll be too late and you'll be on your butt texting people you shouldn't.

I gave most of my batch away and everyone loves this stuff. I have a little stash of my own but haven't had a chance to taste it. I may have to change this review once I actually get to have some of this!

This is an amazing recipe! Very delicious.  I added some allspice and used ground clove because I did not have whole cloves.  Turned out delicious.  I will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

So excited to start this until I realized I had to go out of state to get the grain alcohol. After finally getting it from a friend that was traveling, I got to work.  Just the smell of the cider and juice with the sugar fixture is awesome!  I added more cloves than it called for because I wanted one in each bottle. I doubled the recipe to get 12 bottles.  I also used half a vanilla bean for extra flavor.  Hot dog...what a fun Christmas gift!  Something totally out of the ordinary and GREAT tasting too.  I don't think you can really go wrong.

Love the taste, easy to make and store.
I used 151 as you can't by grain alcohol in NH.

I LOVE love this recipe,
I made it exactly like recipe said and I modify it by making it with 2 cups everclear and two cups vanilla vodka. I like it a little weaker so usually I just make those batches for me.. Also I've started adding mulling spice to it when it's boiling..usually like 4 pks.. It adds more spice.. And I also use the foggy Apple juice I forget what apples they are..but I think I like that better... Yummy

It was good and I made this pretty much to directions. I added 1tsp vanilla after simmering and cut the white sugar in half and found it still to be plenty sweet. I placed a clove and cinnamon stick in each jar. It is good as an aperitif. It is strong and meant to be sipped. A friend of mine used it as a base for 'appletini's' adding some cider and shaking as a smoother cocktail.

It's was so easy to make and it tastes great. Only had a few sips so far, it's nice and smooth. I can see this getting you into trouble real quick. My batch made just under 10 pints. I did omit the clove in my batch just not that big a fan of it..I may try adding some fresh vanilla bean next time

I thought this turned out great.  In hindsight I wish I would have added 2 cups of Everclear then  added incrementally to it.  I wanted a classic Everclear experience of not being able to taste it and having it sneak up on you and kick your arss (think purple passion).  I thought adding 3 cups produced a hot sensation but if it's true moonshine you want, then add the full 3 cups.  I would rather people not taste it straight away. But truth be told,  the Everclear burn does calm down after refrigeration.  I put a cinnamon stick in each mason jar before in refrigerated it.

I liked the recipe although it was way too sweet! I wouldn’t add any sugar because of the already sweet apple juice and apple cider vinegar. Also, DO NOT LEAVE CINNAMON STICKS IN JAR! I made the mistake of leaving them in the jar because it looked cool but the next day the drink was nearly ruined do to the overpowering cinnamon flavor. Basically made an overly sweet fireball.

Just made this, of course I modified it. 3 Cups of ever clear but instead of 2 cups vanilla vodka I used 1 1/4 cup captain Morgan spiced rum and threw in a little vanilla extract. Very delicious.. New favorite drink

Delicious! Skipped the vodka and added extra everclear and a little bit of vanilla extract instead. 
Because I live in California- had to use 151 proof as they don't sell 190.

Made it last night for a family campfire. Had it in a slow cooker with sugar and spices sans alcohol about 4 hrs, then served kids first, added more cider, then the alcohol (whipped cream vodka sub for vanilla vodka). It was a huge hit with all ages.

Good flavor especially with the addition of whipped vodka.  I used a gallon each of cider and apple juice to cut the strength.  It was a bit strong to me going by the original recipe.

Great recipe, but keep in mind that this will yield a 36 proof (18% abv) alcoholic beverage, which hardly passes for moonshine.  If you want to make a true moonshine-strength liquor, then double the alcohol to make it 72 proof (36% abv). This will be a sipping drink, like whiskey... so keep that in mind and drink lightly.  Here's my alteration: same recipe, but added an extra cup of brown suger; 1 tsp salt; 2 extra cloves; 1 tsp ground cinnamon (along with the 4 sticks); a full 1750ml bottle of 190 proof grain alchohol; no vanilla vodka; and added 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract.  Oh, and I also used unfiltered apple juice, to give it that home-squeezed look.  The result... a true 72-proof apple pie à la mode moonshine. Delish! But drink lightly!

Doubled the recipe. It turn out great. This is a fall favorite for my family and friends. I like more of a cinnamon taste so I put a stick on each jar. Very smooth.

This us a real good recipe I have made it several times but I have change it a little a coupleof times. I have used fresh pressed Apple cider and replaced the Vanilla Vodka with Whipped Vodka. I have also replaced the 2 cups of sugars and have used a jar of real honey.

Incredibly tasty.  Made it with 3/4s of the the alcohol content and it was great.  The house smelled like Apple Pie.  Highly recommend.

Great recipe. Followed it exactly. Tastes a lot like Apple Pie. If you like your drinks strong I would add at least another cup of Everclear.

A great beverage , tastes just like apple pie!  Everyone we know loves it. We find it a bit too sweet, so omit the white sugar.

I’ve made this recipe before and it’s a HUGE WINNER!!  The thing of it is, you gotta make it in June if your gonna hand out pint size jars for Christmas.  The longer it sits in a dark closet, the less alcohol burn you’ll taste when you serve it.  NOW IT BECOMES VERY DANGEROUS!!  LOL

I've been playing with this recipe for a few weeks now and I think I nailed it. Half gallon of Everclear, 3 pints of Captain Morgan,( 750ml bottle), one gallon of apple juice, 1/2 gallon of apple cider.. one cup of brown sugar. 3 cinnamon sticks and a good spash af vannilla,and the best part 8 oz of honey. Heat everything except the alcohol for 30 min or more if you want. Mix in the everclear and captain morgan. And it's done

Love this recipe! I used organic apple juice and cider, and also decided to change things up a little and used Vanilla Crown instead of vodka! It made the flavor slightly richer and really brought out the cinnamon flavor!

I followed the recipe for the most part. The only thing I changed was I used the whole bottle of everglades since 750 ml is much more than 3 cups. It's turned out really tasty, I can't wait to share it with friends and family. Does anyone know what the proof of this would be?

This stuff is amazing!  I used 1/4 tsp of ground clove while it simmered and added 1 tsp of vanilla after it cooled, as I had neither of those items on hand.  It was fabulous.  Can't wait to see what steeping with the cinnamon sticks for a couple weeks does to it.

We used an entire 1L bottle of Everclear when we did it. The ratio is then:
.7 gal cider
.7 gal apple juice
5-6 cinnamon sticks
1-2 cloves
1.4 cups white sugar
1.4 cups brown sugar
1 Liter bottle Everclear
2.8 cups Vanilla Vodka

This made just about 24 8oz jars, 12 4oz jars, & 2 pints of Apple Pie Ala Mode. 

We skimmed the impurities off the top and filtered the last couple inches of it later with a coffee filter.
 
We figured it was best to use up the entire bottle of Everclear rather then watch it collect dust in our alcohol cabinet. Great recipe!

This is absolutely delicious. I made two batches and put it into mason jars. I gave them as gifts to people for Christmas. They loved it! Very smooth. I plan on making another batch for myself for after Christmas.

I cut way back on the added sugar because it's too sweet for my taste as written. I buy 100% apple juice and cider, and added only a 1/4 of the sugar called for, and it is excellent. I also added some apples and simmered longer, and then strained them out before jarring. I put a cinnamon stick and portion of a vanilla bean in each bottle, as well. Can't wait to taste it in a few weeks!

Oh my gosh!  I thought this was great stuff.  I made it for Thanksgiving.  It made a TON.  My husband didn't like it as much as I and my grown son did.   We happily had it as a nightcap off and on through the holidays.  For me, it is a "sipper" drink, enjoying a glass slowly on the cold nights  My son took some home with him for when he had guests over, and he said everyone loved it.  As much as I love it, I am going to reserve it for special occasions, else I could be an Apple Pie Moonshine addict.

Very Tasty recipe ,  Made a change or 2 but didn't stray far from the recipe.  Used my homemade 180 proof shine instead of Everclear . The shine gives it a very distinct flavor. As for the flavored vodka, I skipped it. The  store bought stuff doesn't taste right, too many man made chemicals. I  used a little more shine.  I added vanilla beans to the boil and divided in them into to the jars.

The first time I made this, I made it exactly as written except, 151 proof is the highest everclear available in my state so that is what I used.  This was a great drink as written.  The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe and used the large 3 qt size apple juice instead of a full gallon just because it was easier and I cut the white sugar in half.  I may try as others suggested when I make it again and switch the vodka to regular and add vanilla extract.

I made this for a bonfire party we had, and everyone was blown away! I used whipped cream flavored vodka because it was on sale and put apple slices and a cinnamon stick or two in each jar. Made with these measurements exactly, I filled up about 5-1/2 large Ball jars. I will absolutely make this again and it has given me the homemade moonshine bug (oh no!)
Thanks Grandma!!!

Love it! Good sipped over ice as it cuts some of the sweetness.

This is amazing. However, we used organic unfiltered apple juice and unfiltered cider. We also used pure cane unrefined sugar but this made it darker. It tastes fantastic but is very cloudy and dark because of the sugar. We have decided to call our version "Moonshine Mud."

I made the recipe as written and thought it was pretty harsh. I made another batch and used vanilla schnapps instead of the vanilla vodka. I mixed the two batches together and found it made a very smooth drink.Maybe a little too smooth!

I have had the real apple pie moonshine on multiple occasions. This tates just like it without the high cost of real moonshine!

this is a big hit with my family and friends.  I am making it again for a winter weekend at the cabin in Northern Michigan. Mine doesn't look like the picture it is not clear.  What am I not doing? Excellent anyway! h added vanilla with the spirits.

This is awesome and very easy to make! I used ground cloves since that is what I had on the spice rack. I left 1 cinnamon stick in the bottle and it just got better.

Such a fun and easy drink to make ahead for parties or to give as gifts. It really packs a punch though. I just like a little bit in a mug of hot cider.

Delicious! Substituted 1 tsp allspice for the clove.
