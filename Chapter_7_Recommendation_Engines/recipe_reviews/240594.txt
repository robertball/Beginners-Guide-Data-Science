My Simple Chili Haiku: "4 cans tomatoes, to only 1 can of beans, was just way too much." I really, really wanted to like this chili b/c it WAS simple, and it didn't have any funky ingredient that tries to set it apart from a good humble bowl of chili (not that I'm against occasionally using a non-traditional ingredient or two in my chilis), but this was tomato overload, and I really like stewed tomatoes. Thankfully b/c they were so big and chunky, we were able to fish some out when serving, especially since my daughter was like "are there beans hiding under the tomatoes??" The flavor profile of seasoning was right on (although my husband and I tend to add Chipotle Tabasco or Texas Pete to our bowls), but if I make this again, I would use 1 lb. meat / 1 can stewed tomato / 1 can beans.

Basic recipe, but good flavor. I added some beef broth and used chili beans instead of kidney beans.

Great recipe  -exactly what I was looking for - THANK YOU!.  

Made the following course corrections:
1)  Used LIGHT RED kidney beans
2) Substituted garlic powder for garlic
3)  Omitted carrot
4) Added 1/2 cup of granulated sugar to enhance flavors.

The recipe easily lends itself to smaller output by simple division - I made a fine small batch using 1/2 of all ingredients.  My personal preference is to simmer such agglomerations for a few hours so that flavors intermingle thoroughly - be mindful of liquid replacement.

Simple recipe. I didn't add celery (don't particularly care for it) and added fresh basil leaves from my garden. Also used black beans instead of pinto.

Yes, I will make it again...very yummy. I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans. I left out the celery because I don't like celery. I added two small cans of mild green chiles to replace it. Good flavor!

I cut the recipe in half and used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I subbed chili beans for the kidney beans because this was going over hot dogs. Everything else stayed the same.
