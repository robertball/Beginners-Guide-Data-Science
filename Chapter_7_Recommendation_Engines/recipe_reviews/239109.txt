This was just okay for me. To save on time, I used frozen/prepared mini tart shells. I then followed the recipe exactly, and found it be a bit bland. Perhaps this is best used as a 'base' recipe, to which you would add your own raisins and/or walnuts? As is, it just misses the mark. I wouldn't rule out this recipe in the future, however if/when I make again, I will certainly try adding some extra goodies to jazz it up.  Tip:: Pop the shells into the oven for 5 minutes or so BEFORE filling them, so that the shells can get a bit of extra cooking time (they'll need it).

Hubby and son liked these. They were simple to make, but I found they puffed up and then the filling itself sank, but the crust was still high. Biting into them made a huge "hole" between crust and filling. Will make again but still on the lookout for the ultimate butter tart.

Wonderful recipe! We really like the fuller flavour from using brown sugar where my standard recipe used white sugar. I baked the frozen tarts for 5 minutes, filled them and baked for a further 15 minutes. The batter went a long way, I was able to get 45 tarts out of filling calling for 30 tarts. That method worked great! I will definitely be saving this recipe for the future.

Turned out amazing. I used heavy/whipping cream instead of half half and on my second time making the recipe I left them in the oven a few extra minutes. I found 15 minutes I still had some granular sugar in the tarts.  Maybe my tart shells are a little bigger or more full than expected.  The extra time made them perfect.

This was super easy to make. They look perfect. I added some half pecans to the top right before putting them in the oven. Waiting for them to cool in order to taste.

For 36 - 3" tart shells I added 3 eggs and divided batter into 2 parts.
1/2 was for one type (Raisin)
Rest for pecan and plain

Yield: 60 - 3" tarts! :)
The filling was still as sweet as one would want.

I added slivered almonds, which worked nicely.  This is a very tasty recipe, but the tarts are very greasy  :(

These turned out great only thing I changed in this was instead of using half&half I used heavy cream the whipping this is a great option for those who don't like raisins in their butter tarts !
