This was a very interesting recipe.  I had it without the topping.  It creeps up on you and then it explodes into flavor.  At first, it tasted like a piece of bread with some huckleberries in it, but as my palette got used to it, I loved it.  Will definitely make it again!!

Very tasty ! Thanks for sharing. Just a note to the critic Pam-3BoysMama . Huckleberries are grown mostly in the cool mountains here where I live and in other areas. They are purplely blue and 1/2 the size of a blueberry. If you tasted them side by side , you would taste the difference right away. You have to fight the black bears for them ! VBG I know lol

Very tasty, but after sitting overnight the bottom of this cake became very wet. I used blueberries, which, after a little research I learned are actually huckleberries. Apparently it's a difference in terminology as we only seem to have the blue ones in my area and they are always marketed as blueberries. I loved the topping on this cake - don't skip that! This looks so pretty topped with whipped cream and sliced almonds.

I tried this recipe and loved it!  Everyone that I have made it for has loved it also.  We were fortunate enough to have a lot of huckleberries so instead of a 1 & 1/2cups of berries we added 2 heaping cups.  Excellent recipe!  Will definitely use again!

Yum! Now this is what I think of when I dream of coffee cake. Crumbly, crunchy topping. Moist, rich, fruity cake. Makes fighting the bears for the huckleberries so much more worth it :)

Huckleberries are not blueberries. This recipe came out a bit dry so I think an increase in the huckleberries would do it. A good recipe, it just needs some tweaking.

We loved this cake. I changed a couple of things. I baked it in a bundt pan. I also reduced the brown sugar to a cup. The topping I did was a 1/4 cup brown sugar, oatmeal and sliced almonds with the butter and cinnamon. It is light, not too sweet so it doesn't take away from the flavor of the huckleberries. Enjoy!!!
