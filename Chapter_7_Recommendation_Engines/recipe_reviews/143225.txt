The best, best barbaque I have ever made.  I cut it down to feed 6.  Big mistake- this is something you want for leftovers.  So good.  Didn't change a thing.

I did not get to cook for 24 hours, so I started the brisket on high for 4 hours then reduced to low and cooked for another 16 hours. Was very tender. I did use kosher salt and black peppered the meat before cooking.  I also trimmed alot of fat off the brisket. There was still plenty left to flavor it.  The sauce was good, but a bit sweet for my family's tastebuds. (I liked it though) 5 stars for my opinion, but gave it 4 because of the opinion of my bunch.  I will do it again...but with a different sauce. Also served with kaiser buns and aged swiss cheese slices.

I cooked for only 6 people so my brisket weighed only 2.5 lbs.  I adjusted the amounts for everything else to suit the size including the time.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours in my crockpot, and then I turned it to Low for 6 hours.  It was tender and DELICIOUS!

There is no option to give NO Stars, because this one was a total waste.  I wasted good money on this cut of meat!  I wasted 25 hours of electricity!
The meat was burnt on the bottom, it was chewy like leather.  The only moist part was the FAT on the meat.  Now I have to get take-out.
I followed the directions to a tee.  I used the servings converter to 4 servings for my husband and me.  This is the first recipe I've tried on here that I totally hated it!

People who are saying that this was burnt and chewy.. listen up! lol you can't reduce the size of the cut to accomodate less people and NOT change the cooking time as well!  1 reviewer wrote that she calculated for 4 people, which is only 1.5Lbs of brisket - then it states that she still cooked it for 24 hours!! Of course it was leathery and inedible - reduce the cooking length too!. This is a 5 star recipe when done properly. I did add some chipotle and some hot cayenne sauce to counter the sweetness.

A very tasty dish that needs to be a little more bold and spicy. I will use this recipe again, however, I will add some character of my own the next time! I was only serving six people and needed to cut the recipe by 2/3, but it still turned out wonderful. I followed the directions exactly and even used the strongest of coffees you can find here in Italy to cook it in, Caffe Kimbo. Very tender, very juicy and a excellent base to build from. This could be a definite crowd pleaser when served with the right vinegar condiments.

My son and I couldn't resist making this, because of the weird combination of ingredients.  It was an interesting experiment, lots of fun!  Not bad tasting! - but there are much better recipes for beef brisket on this site.

If you follow the directions for this recipe you will be pleasantly surprised.  I actually did cook it for the 24 hours on low and my family loved it.  Unfortunately there was only a 2.5 lb brisket available but none the less there was none left.  I will and have cook this again.

The beef turned out nicely, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. It had a mild sweet taste, rather than something more bold. I would add some spice next time to enhance the flavor. This recipe makes a lot (I even cut back to a 5 lb. brisket) so it's good for a crowd.

There is no way I would cook an 8 lb brisket even on Low for 24 hours.  Any crock pot worth having and working properly should have it sufficiently cooked in 8-10 hours.  So that is why there are so many reviews that say it was burned.  I have used the combination of ingredients before and it is excellent.  However, i adjusted the cooking time to 1 hour per pound on Low.

This turned out great.  I read reviews before making it and saw some said it was dry and burned.  It seems only a few had that issue but it made me take extra precautions. I used a roasting bag made for slow cookers and also used parchment paper under the lid.  This was far from dry.  It was the most tender, moist and delicious brisket I have ever made.  The sauce is wonderful and I did add about 4 TBS of Louisiana Hot Sauce just to kick it up a bit.  My husband really liked it and he's not a big BBQ fan.  I put my slow cooker out on the patio because I didn't want 25 hours of even a small heat source in my kitchen since our air conditioner runs 24 hours a day this time of year.  I'm a displaced Washingtonian living in Texas for the last five years and have eaten a lot of Texas BBQ.  I think this is best I've tasted.  Thanks for this recipe.  Can't wait to send it to my son who is well known for his BBQ.

I have made this several times. Even if you have NO cooking experience, you will be able to make it perfectly.   I usually use a 4-6 lb brisket. It is super easy to make and I never have leftovers.  I don't make the sauce ahead of time.  I make it  right in the slow cooker after I take the meat/broth out.  It requires little attention and makes your house smell graat.  I am making it for our Memorial Day cookout.  The flavor is awesome.  The 24 hour cooking time can be adjusted by a few hours if you run out of time and start cooking it late!  Don't be afraid to try this.  For those who gave it a poor rating, they couldn't have cooked it properly.  I use a "mug" of coffee rather than just a cup, but it still makes a lot of broth during the cooking.

I haven't made this yet, but I was looking at the bad reviews. I noticed some people scaled the recipe down for 4 people then complained that the brisket was burned. If you're using a 1 1/2 to 2 lb brisket, you can't cook it for 24 hours. You would have to reduce your cooking time. Try it again and see!

I was always afraid to make beef brisket till this recipe.  My 1st time at beef brisket and it turned out tender and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and cooked the meat almost 8 hours on low.  The BBQ sauce is heavenly...PERFECT blending of flavors.  I intend to make a large batch up of the sauce and can it for other beef, pork and chicken recipes.  I'll try to cook it down some just to thicken it a little.  Delicious reccipe, Ly, thanks!

This was awesome. I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, and I used a 3lb pot roast (brisket is nearly impossible to find where I live), cooked it on high for 4 hrs, and I also doubled the sauce. You couldn't taste the coffee at all and the meat came out very tender. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent, tender meat.   I'm not sure I really consider it "Texas" barbequeue.. as some say, the sauce isn't overly bold, but it's a pleasant tasting sauce.   You can always ad lib the sauce ingredients to your taste anyway.

I think that for the issues people are having with tough meat, one problem might be the cut of meat.   The recipe calls for "untrimmed" beef.   That will produce enough juice that the meat is basically floating in it's juices by the time you're done and can't possible dry out.   I would avoid the trimmed brisket unless you add more liquids yourself (I actually spooned out about two cups of juice about halfway through cooking because the crock pot was so full.

I figure that I discarded about 40-50% of the original weight in juices and trimmed fat, so an 8 lb untrimmed brisket isn't as much as it seems like it would be (of course it's a fairly cheap cut of meat as well).

This is the best barbeque beef I have ever had!  Usually beef comes out chewy but this recipe is not only delicious but it is sooo easy to make. I love that!  The only thing I am going to change next time is that there wasn't enough sauce.  Next time I am going to most likely double the sauce recipe.  I served this on rolls with coleslaw and everyone ate it up and kept asking to take some home!! I hope you enjoy this as much as we did!!

This is an awesome recipe that makes great barbecue sandwiches! I'm not sure why some reviewers meat burnt...I had so much juice with mine that I had to take quite a bit out! I used the juice I removed to make Yorkshire Pudding (Mort Tibble's recipe, this site) cause I love Yorkshire Pudding! The sauce with this recipe was sweet (which I like, by the way), but after adding it to the meat with the juice in the slow-cooker, it toned down the sweetness a lot. Next time I make this, I will probably add a little more brown sugar! I cooked this a full 24 hours, and it was just fantastic! Highly recommended!

This was excellent.  I used beer in lieu of cola, and I like to throw in the whole garlic cloves you can buy that are already shelled and in liquid which gives a lot of flavor.  There was a bad review on here that said she scaled to 4 servings and still cooked for 24 hours.  It does tell you when you change the servings that the directions do not change, so you have to change the cooking time on your own.  A small roast up to I'd say 3 to 4 lbs should always be done in 8 hours.  I always use a thermometer and have great results every time!

If you want to get a man to fall in love with you follow this recipe! Its even better the next day! However drain the extra juice out before you stick it in the frig for left overs or it will become waaaay to salty.

Nice work.  I am 18 hours in right now and turned it to warm while added a little Dale's to  spark up some early flavor.  Before I added the couple T's of Dales I did sample the beef.  It is amazing what a 7.5 lb brisket and a cup of coffee can do with left alone.  This is my first "off-smoker" brisket and I fully endorse the recipe.  The sauce is spot on too with minor adjustments (a little less ketchup and some habenero chile).  Onward!

This recipe is easy and excellent! Make sure you use liquid coffee, not coffee grounds. Dear Husband assembled this in the crock-pot for me and I came home to a brisket covered in coffee grounds! We had to wash the coffee grounds off, and despite this it was still some of the best brisket we've had...and we're from Texas!

This was really good! We had a smaller portion so we didn't follow the cooking times, but the meat and the sauce were delicious.

Very good.  I would characterize this as a midwestern barbeque due to the sweet sauce.  Substituting some of the ketchup for chili sauce made it better in my opinion.  It would need a much less sweet sauce to be Texas style.  Slow cooking in coffee is a bonus, though.  You can adjust the sauce to individual, regional tastes easily.

For a 4-6 lb brisket, trim about 80 percent of the fat. Use the same ingredients as shown but kick it up by adding some hot sauce and replace the ketchup with a good thick bbq sauce. Then place it in a large roasting pan and pour the sauce over and cook at 200 in the oven for 8-9 hours and it will be one meal to brag about.

Put it on last night so it would be ready when I got home from work.  Left the last hour for my daughter to do.  Well the sauce got poured over but it didn't get pulled apart.  I will never cook a brisket on the grill again.  Loved it and we are in Texas.  Nanc

This was the best brisket we've ever eaten! Not greasy, very tender, the sauce was wonderful!  For my cola drink I used diet pepsi with cherry - because that is what I had in the fridge. Turned out great!!! I cooked this over the 7/4 weekend and my family loved it. Will definitely use this recipe again...it was easy and delicious!

wonderful!  we adjusted the time for a smaller brisket - about 6 lbs and cooked 18 hours or so.  I'm not wild about liquid smoke flavoring so left it out, i'm sure if you like smoke flavoring, i'm sure this recipe would still be exceptional!  My husband was impressed because it didn't have the typical BBQ sauce flavor, it was subtle and a bit sweet.   Excellent recipe!  thank you for sharing...

I suppose everyone is different and no one's taste buds are the same, but this recipe was a HUGE hit. One of the best beef recipes I have ever made. I scaled the recipe down to a serving of 6 and did things only slightly differently (mostly just adding a bit more of what the recipe already called for).

*covered the bottom of slow-cooker with 1/2 cup of beef brother before adding brisket & coffee
*added two extra teaspoons of liquid smoke
*added a few extra teaspoons of worcestershire
*added four tablespoons of Louisiana Hot Sauce
*added an extra couple splashes of cola
*added 1/3 cup of my favorite bbq sauce to the homemade sauce

cooked meat on low for approximately four hours (only had 3 1/2 pounds of meat), removed dish from slow-cooker, added sauce mixture and refrigerated overnight. The next day I cooked the brisket w/mixture on high for an hour, then low for one more hour. I can't thank allrecipes enough for this fantastic recipe!!!

Basic and good. I cooked in slow cooker for 24 hours and then moved it to the stove -- I think the taste is better. I also kept ALL the liquid it was cooking in, mixed in the sauce ingredients with a couple of tablespoons of some pepper/garlic seasoning I have, pulled it and let it simmer for an hour. Let it sit another couple of hours and it reduced to a thick sauce. Lovely.

One probably would not imagine putting coffee, cola and brown sugar together on some meat, but I tell ya, this is absolutely by far one of the best recipes!  I found it on here about a month ago and this will be my 3rd tirme making it.  It has become a staple recipe in my house.  If you know you will have a busy day, put this in the crock the night before and dinner will be pretty much ready when you get home!  

My husband is a pretty picky eater and he can't get enough of this!  

The only bad part about this recipe is you have to smell it all night and the next day, you won't want to wait until dinner to have it!  

Thank you Ly for sharing this recipe!

I made this today and it was soooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly except when I opened the packages of brisket it said to use the juices that came in the package when you cooked it. I cooked the brisket in the coffee as well as about 2 cups of juices that came with the brisket. I will pass this on to others and make it again. A huge hit in my house.

Fantastic!  Not dry at all and better than many of the brisket sandwiches that I have had at really good BBQ places.    I followed the directions but reduced the meat to 6 lbs but kept the amount of sauce. I cooked for the full time as in the directions.  Added just a little hot sauce since others said it was a little too sweet but seemed just fine to us.    This will be a family favorite!

I don't normally follow recipes, but I was looking for a brisket that used Coca Cola in it.  I tried this one, and the only thing, and I mean the only thing that needs to be amended on this recipe is, how does one shred the beef?  I followed the instructions and the meat came out stringy and tough like some of the users have reported here.  Normally I would cut it across the grain, and this would have been out of this world.

The beef was very tender, but the sauce was lacking. I'm not sure if it was because there was a lot of juices and I didn't drain the juice off before I added the sauce? I did skim the fat off first. I've had better pulled beef, and will keep looking for one our family enjoys.

The meat is good and tender, but I feel like it should have cooked with more seasoning rather than just the coffee.  Next time I will make that adjustment.  The sauce was a little bland for our taste, so I added some of our favorite sweet bbq sauce while it cooked for the last hour.  Overall, it was average if you followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sure I'll make it again, though and adjust it for our personal tastes.  It was really easy and convenient.  I'm all about that!!

This was great.  I used a smaller brisket and omitted the liquid smoke. I'm all for cooking things is strong black coffee, so had to try it. I have a freezer full of elk [thanks to my hunter] and I'm going to try this on one of those roasts- see if it can work some magic on that!

I loved this recipe. The largest brisket I could find was not quite 8 lbs.  I have a large oval crock pot and had to fold the brisket (fat side up) to fit it in the pot.  I added the coffee and set the timer for the max...20 hours.  After 4 hours, I added the other 4 hours.  We ate it the first time right out of the pot without sauce.  I shredded it and added the sauce for our second dinner.  It was good as well.

I love beef brisket but have never cooked it in a slow cooker until I tried this recipe.  I followed the instructions for cooking the meat exactly, though I did add a dry rub to the meet.  My brisket was about 4 pounds so I cut everything in half.  I set my crock pot on low and began the process.  After about 16 hours of cooking, I realized the house smelled like the meat was burning.  Boy was I glad I checked it!  The coffee had all burned off, the drippings in the crock pot had burned, and the meat was starting to burn.  Fortunately, I was able to salvage the meal, but if I hadn't been home and just trusted this to cook for 24 hours, my family dinner would have been completely ruined.  I've read the other comments about burned meat and I'm wondering if you need to cut down the cooking time when you use a smaller brisket.  Also, I used a different, bolder recipe for the sauce (also on this website).  It turned out great, but if I try it again, I'll either cut down the cooking time or stick with the oven.  The advantage to the crock pot is it doesn't heat up the whole house.

I am curious to know if the people who complained abt burned meat adjusted the cook time.  The recipe calculator reminds you that the directions remain for the original recipe, it only calculates the amt of the ingredients.  Obviously you are probably not going to cook significantly smaller amts of meat for the same time.

I've made this twice and both times it has turned out absolutely delicious.  The first time I halved it for a smaller brisket.  I wonder if the people who wound up with a burnt brisket forgot to cook it on low, and used high instead?  This has become a favorite for my family!

Awesome! Cooked an 8 pounder on low for just over eight hours. Perfecto! Wouldn't change a thing!

Tip: If you have a picky eater, take some of the meat out and set aside, covering it with some of the sauce from the crockpot, before you add the sauce to the crock pot. It's great plain, too!

Lose the coffee.  I've tried this several times as I've searched for a brisket recipe that my honeybunny will like (he doesn't like the traditional Irish application) and I keep trying to tweak this one and it's come down to the coffee - lose it.  I also added some smoked paprika, cumin and a packet of beefy onion soup mix.   MUCH BETTER!  Seriously though, the coffee needs to go.  I finally put my finger on it and that's what it was.  With those additions and the omission of the coffee it's fabulous!

This is my 7th time using this recipe. My whole family loves it! We usually top a baked potato with this brisket and some spicy BBQ sauce. It is delicious!

This is the best brisket I have ever made!!! 
I didn't have the 25 hours to cook it in, but I left it on high for 5 hours then on low for 2 hours. It was so tender!!!! This is going in to the box.^V^

Excellent recipe! Made it several time, turned out great each time. IMO the key is to get a good roast for a slow cooker.  Went to a butcher, he gave me a blade roast.  He said it won't be tough when cooked for 24 plus hours. GLTA

This was so easy to do. It just took time, that's all. I am a beginner when it comes to cooking meats other than chicken and ground beef. This was an excellent recipe and my family and friends loved it.

I had 2 lbs of brisket, so I followed the advice of cooking it on high for 2 hours in the crockpot, and then low for 6 hours. I wasn’t 100% sure if I was supposed to keep cooking it in coffee along with the other liquids, or dump the coffee. So I drained the coffee before adding the sauce for the last hour. My only experience with brisket is Armadillo Willies, which seems really all about the BBQ sauce. At first, I thought this recipe was just okay when I took a bite from the pot. But then my boyfriend came over with a big sandwich from the local cheese steak shop (he didn’t know I was cooking). I made a sandwich with this brisket, and we did a taste test of both sandwiches. This recipe was 100x better than the recipe from the sandwich shop. Even though they tried to flavor theirs up with peppers, onions, and cheese... theirs wasn’t as good… and I didn’t even put all that stuff on mine.

It was excellent. I made it for 4 people and reduced the cook times due to the much smaller portion. It just made sense. Very tender and tasty.

This recipe was fantastic!  I always used the oven to slow cook my brisket, but never again!!!    This meat had a wonderful beef flavor and superb, tender texture.    I used a 2 1/2 lb brisket I purchased at my local meat market. and adjusted the recipe accordingly (6 servings).  I also lessened the cooking time to 13 hours.  The meat pulled apart with ease.    I can recommend this recipe and I will definately be making this again!

This was pretty good. Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but decent nonetheless. My fiance wasn't particularly impressed, but he can sometimes be picky lol!!! For the expense incurred, I think I'll stick with my standby BBQ beef recipe (also made with a homemade sauce - which is absolutely delish!). I ended up using a 2.5 lb. brisket since I was cooking for just the two of us. It cost me $14 bucks (whoa!). If I didn't have all of the other ingredients readily available, I probably would have used a different cut of meat to keep the cost down (since I'd have to buy all of the other stuff) or skipped this recipe alltogether (which I didn't want to do). I pretty much followed this exact except for adding several shakes of Tabasco hot sauce due to other's warning of sweetness. I don't think it made much difference though (oh well!). Served on fresh kaiser rolls with a generous heaping of coleslaw (on our sandwiches, but you could serve as a side if this idea doesn't float your boat) and kettle chips on the side, this was an easy-to-fix, filling Sunday evening meal. I must say, you can't beat the convenience factor, and for that alone, I give 5 stars (minimal cleanup!). Thanks for sharing! :-)

I made this in my Crock Pot which I consider a "slow-cooker" and it was well done within 10 hours.  There was no way I would have been able to cook it for the 24 hours as indicated in the directions. Is a Crock Pot not a "slow-cooker"?  The recipe itself was very good, but would have been better had it not been overcooked (in the 10 hour time frame). Haven't made it since, but willing to try again.

This works great in a slow cooker or  the oven at about 250 degrees.  When I use the oven, it just cooks all night.  There are only 3 people in our household, so I like to cook enough for our freezer.  After all, I don't want to spend a lot of time cooking every day, especially in this Texas heat.  When they are on sale, I always buy the largest untrimmed brisket I can find,   After cooking, removing the fat, skimming fat from the broth and pulling the meat but before adding any kind of sauce;  I freeze packages with enough meat and broth for one meal each.  We can then use this nice tender, juicy meat for a variety of different meals.  i.e. add taco seasoning and make taco/burrito, season and use for a type of French Dip sandwich, add the BBQ sauce and serve on a bun.  It is so versitile and handy to have a supply of this wonderful meat in the freezer and be able to use it in a number of different ways so you don't get tired of the same meal over and over.  
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  Those who had problems with the meat being dry, must have done one of two things; 1 cooked a trimmed brisket or 2 used a slow cooker much too large for the amount of meat being cooked.  There should be a LOT of liquid in the pan at the end of cooking time (a lot of which is fat, so be sure to skim it).  Love Love Love this recipe.

I put it in my slow cooker for 11 hours.  It was very tender, but not a lot of flavor.  I used my own bottled sauce (because I love it) so I can’t speak to the sauce in the recipe.  We used the leftovers in tacos and they were good.  Overall, good recipe and got me over my fear of fixing brisket.

I followed the recipe as written, turning the meat to warm after 22 hours and the meat was tender and so juicy. The sauce though is incredible! My husband is a tough critic and he said it was amazing! He told me print out this recipe and put it in my cookbook to add to our rotation! Love this recipe!

This slow cooker brisket was a homerun all the way. I followed the recipe as written. The BBQ sauce came out good and was neither on the too sweet or on the spicy side.  I ended up adding some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce at the table and it was awesome. I paired it with twice baked potatoes, sweet corn, and followed it up with red velvet cheesecake swirl brownies for dessert.

Everyone loved this. We use root beer for the soda, and cold brew for the coffee, but we cover the meat with the coffee...Way more than one cup! Soooooo very good. Kids loved it, even my picky eater, guests loved it, hubby loved it... cooking it right now, again!

I used strong black coffee (Community brand) and Royal Crown Cola.  First, 24 hours is waaaay too long.  Secondly, I'm not sure the coffee added anything to the taste of the final product.  The sauce part of the recipe is okay.  What it tastes like in a bowl is way different than the taste you get when you add it to the brisket.,  I really wanted to slice the brisket but the 24 hour cook time made shredding it the only option.

A new and different way to cook a brisket - We have avoided buying brisket for the past few years because of the extremely high price, but we found one that was reasonable so I decided to give this a try - you need to scale down the recipe and time if you have a smaller roast and I also cut up a whole onion and placed the thick slices under the brisket in some of the coffee before cooking - this way the meat was not directly on the bottom of the crock - this not only worked well to keep the meat from burning, but the onions caramelized in the coffee/juice mixture - added the sauce to what remained at the bottom, then poured the rest over the top and let it all blend together for the last hour - excellent!

So good! Used about a 3 pound brisket and came out very tender after 24 hours. Tastes like it came off the grill! Had to drain the liquid a couple times to keep it from getting too submerged. Also added some spices after pouring in the coffee (salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic and onion powder, cumin, oregano).

This was my first brisket and I made it for visiting family. It was a HIT. Made as directed, except I had only 18 hrs to slow cook instead of 24. No matter - it turned out great and the sauce was excellent!  Only minor change I made was to brown the beef prior. Will definitely make again. Don't shy away from the long slow-cook time!

This was delicious! I adjusted the cooking time for a 6 lb brisket,cooking it for about 16 hours. Definitely reduce the sauce before because it is runny.

I was quite skeptical because of the ingredients, but will use this as our main brisket recipe now! Was a good mix of sweet and spicy. Will add a bit more spice next time though to accommodate my family's taste!

This is by far one of my husbands all-time favorite recipes.  I do spice it up quite a bit by adding jalapenos and ghost peppers (he loves spicy).  It's a very simple recipe with very little prep time.  Great for parties and picnics.

I made this for our wine club.  I had to make two huge briskets to serve about 40 people.  Everybody raved about it!  There were NO leftovers.  Tonight I'm making it again as everyone begged for a repeat performance.

First time trying a brisket in the slow cooker...after reading all the reviews, both good and bad, I must say it turned out quite good.  My 5-1/2 qt slowcooker was just barely big enough for an 8lb brisket, but I cut it in half & it fit! I only cooked it for 12 hrs on low as my Rival SmartPot crockpot cooks way too hot, even on low & it was done perfectly. I shredded it last night, refridgerated it & will add the sauce tonight, warming it stovetop. I also just ordered a new slow cooker (a different brand)! Hopefully the new one will be more reliable as we want to have this again & again.
Perhaps other are having the same issues with their slow cookers, if so decrease the time on this and other recipes. Apparently the manufacturer does make quite a difference.
Thanks for posting!

Very good. Used a 10 lb brisket. Had to remove drippings as they got close to the rim. Did the whole 24 hour cooking method.

Cut the servings down to 5 (2 lb brisket). Cut the cook time down to 6 hours. Could possibly be seasoned with garlic or cayenne, but delicious as is!

This recipe isn't too bad. When I think Texas Style though, this isn't exactly the flavor I envision. However, its quite simple and despite the fact that my crock pot picked this recipe to go haywire on the temp settings, it was quite palatable. The In Laws loved it as did our Aunt and Uncle down the road. There is lots to share and still we will have some for tomorrow. I'll make it again. I was thinking it would be a great dish for a reunion or pot luck gathering.

i have never cooked a brisket before- this was the first time- delicious and easy!! served it at a dinner and it was gobbled right up! next time I will add a little more "spice" to it - maybe some hot sauce to the recipe.

Temperature is so very important when cooking something for that long but all you say is LOW. I cook mine an hour and a half per pound around 220F but maintaining the temperature is difficult on an outdoor grill.

No zip to this. I will continue to search for a better brisket recipe.
