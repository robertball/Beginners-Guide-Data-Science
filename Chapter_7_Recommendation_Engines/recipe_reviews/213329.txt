This recipe turned out well with a few health-conscious changes.  I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of beef and cut the butter in half.  I wanted more vegetables so after I browned and drained the turkey I added half a chopped onion and half a cup of frozen corn and cooked them together in the skillet for another 3 minutes.

I substituted a can of fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic because that's what I had on hand.  I used the juice from the tomatoes in place of some of the water.

This version made 6 lunch-sized servings, each with 306 calories, 8g total fat, 2.5g saturated fat, 54mg cholesterol, 500mg sodium, 26g carbohydrate and 19g protein.

Next time I'll make the same changes but I'll add more corn and use cream of onion as the soup base.  The golden mushroom soup made the potato topping a pretty orange color but it's not my favorite flavor.

I made several changes to the recipe and it came out GREAT! I used ground turkey. I added the Pictsweet seasoning blend (onions, green peppers, celery), in addition to the garlic while browning the ground turkey. I couldn't find "cream of vegetable" so I just added some water in it's place. After putting ground turkey mixture on bottom, I topped with half of the cream of mushroom soup. I also added some shredded cheese and bacon crumbles (the kind near the salad dressing). Really added a lot of flavor. My husband loved the casserole. It doesn't "look" very appetizing :), but it totally is! I will definitely be cooking this again!

I think it would be better with real potatoes but it was very good. I also added onions to the beef when I cooked it. The kids loved it and I will make this again for sure:)
