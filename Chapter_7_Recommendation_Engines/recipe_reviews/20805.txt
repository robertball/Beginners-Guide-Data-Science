YUMMY!!! To cut down on the mess, I wrap the chestnuts and THEN pour the sauce over them (careful not to get too much of the sauce on the toothpicks...makes for guests' sticky hands!) Also, I don't cook the sauce prior and it's fine in texture and taste. I do cook the wrapped chestnuts for about 1/2 hour before putting the sauce on them though. I've taken these to several get togethers and they've always been a hit!

delicious, great cold too! don't eat too many! the best way to get the most out of this recipe is to cut the bacon once lengthwise and once widthwise so you get 4 pieces out of each strip of bacon, instead of 3 strips like the recipe says. then, cut each water chestnut in half, so you get 2 half-moons. i only used one can instead of 2. delicious!

This recipe was a HUGE hit at a recent party.  They were gone in a matter of minutes.  I was in a pinch for time so I cut some corners.  I microwaved the sauce, cooked the bacon and water chestnuts in the oven for 30 min., then added the sauce and microwaved for another 3-5.  It was easy and YUMMY!

I also make these, but cut the bacon into 3rd's, then wrap the chestnuts and secure with a toothpick. THEN bake them until done, and drain all the grease.  Just before the guests arrive, I pour our favorite bbq sauce on them and bake again until the bbq sauce is a little sticky.  Enjoy!

Big hit! Wow these went fast. As the bacon cooks, the sauce turns into a thick yummy goo. I only needed half the sauce, which I dabbed on w/a BBQ brush. Use bacon thicker than Oscar Mayer, which tends to tear during the wrapping process.

Wonderful, Wonderful.  I served these for a get-together we had & ended up back in the kitchen making more.  Don't use thick slice bacon tho, it doesn't work well.  Thanks Julie.

My otherwise picky family ate ALL of them.  Huge hit at a party.  I added one tsp of soy sauce to the recipe.  I cut the water chestnuts in half since each was the size of a walnut from the can. I also cut each strip of bacon into four pieces (vertically so 3 cuts across of equal size) and each was the perfect size to wrap the half water chestnut.

I used the tip to cook first then drain some fat after about 15 min.  Then I added the sauce and cooked for about 45 more min, definitely needed a longer cook time.  Delicious!

Great and easy recipe.  I found it worked best to cut the bacon in thirds, wrap the waterchestnuts and then bake them on a cookie cooling rack that's on top of a baking sheet (to catch the grease).  This makes the bacon super crispy.  Then I put them in a crockpot with the sauce with tootpicks on the side.  I also add a little more Worschester sauce.  My husband and I have a hard time not eating them before the guests arrive!

This was a big hit at my son's first birthday party! I cut the bacon into thirds, then wrapped and then dipped to avoid a big mess. I will definitely make this again for our next party!

These were pretty time consuming to make - but definitely worth the effort!  I had mixed reviews from guests, they liked the sauce and the bacon but some were not too crazy about the water chestnuts (which I think are the best part!)
An all around good appetizer to serve at a cocktail party.

This is pretty much the recipe I've been using for awhile. My homemade bbq sauce is different but I can't give that away ;) I normally cook for 45 mins, drain grease then spoon bbq sauce on and cooking for another 1/2 hour to let the bbq sauce carmalize.    My recommendation: If you have extra time, cook bacon prior to wrapping the water chesnuts I normally cut the bacon in halves instead of 1/3s because the bacon will shrink in the frying pan.  Once the bacon is mostly cooked I wrap the chesnuts. This makes the end product much crisper than just baking them. Then I stick them in the baking pan, spoon on bbq sauce and let the bbq sauce carmalize.

These were very good!!!  1 package of bacon equals about 3 cans of water chestnuts if you cut the bacon into 1/3ds.  I did cut the brown sugar by half and they were still delicious!!  I also broiled them for about 5 min at the end just to crisp things up a bit!

I make these all the time but the temperature needs to be turned way up. 350 degrees is way too low to get these done in 45 minutes. I had the oven to 350 and they did nothing in 40 minutes. My oven is usually always correct. When I turned the oven to 425 they started cooking and getting crispy. I wrap the water chestnuts in bacon (cut in thirds) and secure them the night before. The next day about an hour and half before whatever party/event, I make the sauce and then I dip the bacon and chestnuts and then place them on a rack and bake them. The rack helps because they aren't just sitting in their fat, it allows for them to get crispy all around. Any extra sauce I pour on them about halfway through and let it get nice and sticky. Also, for very easy clean up - wrap a baking sheet in foil, place rack, and then cook chestnuts on the rack.

This was a hit! Its sweet, a little salty, and crunchy all in one bite...yummy  I did follow the others suggestion to cook the bacon wrapped water chestnuts for 30-40min first so that the bacon gets a little  crispy and them added the sauce.

I have tried almost every recipe for these on this website. Every sauce is slightly different, but this combination was outstanding. I have even used a honey based bottle barbeque sauce recipe on mine. I highly recomend that you at least double the recipe, because they will get eaten. Last weekend when I made them, I used 4 cans of water chestnuts and and 3 packages of bacon and there still weren't any left over.

I've made this a good dozen times and it never fails to please a crowd...which means I'm never carrying home leftovers after a potluck.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's best to wrap the chestnust first and then pour sauce over top.  I've also wrapped the chestnuts, left the sauce off, baked, and then added the sauce toward the end, thinking this would cause less burnt sauce to be stuck to my pan in the end, and it did help, but you could just line your pan with tin foil probably.

Cooking the Bacon wrapped water chestnuts first, and then draining off the grease makes for a crispier, more delicious appetizer.

FABULOUS!! I followed a couple of the suggestions from others who had tried and reviewed this recipe.  I used sliced water chestnuts so I was able to control the size of the finished product.  I used a cookie-cooling rack and placed it over an aluminum foil-lined pan and baked the chestnuts for 45-minutes at 350.  I made the sauce the day before so the flavors could meld and the sauce thickened.  After 45 minutes of baking, I dipped the water chestnuts in the sauce and returned them to the cookie-cooling sheet and baked for an additional 18-minutes.  The sauce carmalized around the bacon and WOW.  Also, after cutting the bacon slices into thirds, I then cut the third pieces vertically so I had two even strips of bacon.  I then layed out the bacon pieces vertically and horizontally and wrapped them around the water chestnut.  This appetitizer got rave reviews from our guests.

I've made these quite a few times in my life, even as a teenager since it was somethign my Mom used to make. She would put a dab of ketchup on each one before rolling up, which interestingl enough carmelized and was an extra flavor that adds to the picture. We dip in warmed barbeque sauce now and there are NEVER any left. If watching your calories in addition to carbs, try turkey bacon. Butterball brand tends to crisp up nicely!

Definitly not what I was expecting.  I followed the directions exactly and they certainly didn't taste like any bacon-wrapped water chestnuts I'd had before.  Very thick and sticky ketchup flavor.  None of my guests seemed to like them either.  I won't be making these again, sorry.

The ones that turned out were very good~I set my timer for 40 minutes and it was far too long, many burned.  I too cut the bacon in to quarters, which I think depends on if you do the chestnuts in wholes or halves. Otherwise the sauce was great!

I think these are really good.  To avoid the mess: make the sauce as instructed but don't pour it over the bacon and chestnuuts first, just set it aside. Wrap and bake as instructed and take them out of the oven 5 min early.  DIP the bacon-wrapped chestnuts in the sauce and put them back in the oven for 5 more minutes until they glaze.    It's less mess and a littie easier to do

I broiled the bacon wrapped chestnuts, drained all the fat off and then put in a crock pot with the sauce poured over.  Also I cut the ketchup amount in half, and reduced the amount of brown sugar.  Yummy!

These are amazing!  Be sure to make a lot as they will go fast.  To keep from getting soggy, I baked them without the sauce first on a broiling pan for 35-40 min.  Then while they were baking, I made the sauce.  I then dipped them into the sauce, shook off the excess and baked them in a 9" x 13" pan for 10 - 15 min. longer.  I used the regular bacon so I got more.  I only had two water chestnuts leftover.  I also stood mine upright with the toothpick being vertical.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've had a recipe for these in my box but this time I couldn't find it so I turned to this one. They turned out better than my original! :) I didn't have ketchup so I used bbq sauce. Also, I used about 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce instead of the 1 teaspoon and 2 Tablespoons of teriyaki sauce. The teriyaki really added to the chestnuts to make them unique. Everyone asked for more. I catered a Christmas party and my whole family told me to double the batches so they could have some. They were gone before I could transfer them from the pan to a serving dish.

I've only had the version of these where the water chestnuts are soaked in Soy.. Thought I'd give this one a try.  It was a HUGE hit at my holiday party, these were the first to go.

Have had these made the recipe way and substituting fresh pineapple chunks for the water chestnuts....the fruit version was OUTSTANDING! Needed to cook both versions longer than the recipe stated.

I made this for a 30th bday party and everyone loved it. I baked them for 45-50 minutes generously drizzled with the sauce. I then kept them warm in my crock pot with more sauce poured over top. I did not use all of the sauce, but I did double the recipe so you can make it to your liking. They were crispy and sweet and it smelled liked baked beans. I am a vegetarian so I cannot account for the taste, but people INHALED these things and everyone told me I had to make them for every party/family get-together from now on. They were easy, too. A classic for a reason, I suppose!

I had these at a party and she wouldn't give me the recipe but found it here!  These are so good.  I love making different foods and they turn out yummy every time I make them.  I am always passing out the recipe.

A friend made these for my Tree Decorating Party last December and I couldn't get enough of them! It had been a VERY long time since overindulging in ANYTHING, but these, even though it sounds like some odd ingredients together, were worth it! Try making some for a carry-in at work, appetizer, or just to taste them...!!!

I made these a couple times, and they are really good! I did find that using sliced water chestnuts tasted better for some reason though. Great appetizer!

These are excellent. When I am lucky enough to have some fresh venison tenderloin or stew meat, I add a small chuck right on top of the water chestnut before wrapping.  Have had many good comments from my hubby's hunting buddies, they love them:)

Always a hit! Although some disagree, I think thick bacon is a must, but I pre-cook it a bit in the microwave so it removes some fat and reduces oven cooking time. You can reduce the sugar for less sweetness.  Really, you could pop 10 of these in your mouth without thinking, they are so YUM.

These are always a HUGE hit - I usually make half the way the recipe says and the other half I add a slice of fresh jalapeno for all my heat loving family and friends. Gives it another layer of kick - try it!!

I loved these little morsels. However I had to cook them about an hour to get the bacon fully cooked and crispy. I just have one question. How do I not eat all of these before the party? Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This is always a hit at the parties!  I have made it several times and it is the first dish to go!  I have to say that there is a lot of sauce so I don't put all of it on.  I also increase the cooking time on the bacon so that it gets crispier!  Love this!

These are tasty little treats for a party. They are time consuming to make, and pretty gooey and greasy. Good if there are lots of appetizers to choose from, you wouldn't want to only have these to eat all night because they are so rich!

Absolutely love this sauce. I added some hot sauce, about 1/8 cup, you can add more or less depending on your preferences. I used a lb of turkey bacon and a lb of bacon. I also used 3 cans of  water chestnuts and a package of lil smokey's. I wrapped the smokey's in both types of bacon and repeated with the water chestnuts.
What I would do different is sprinkle them with some brown sugar and bake them until almost done (about 45 min), drain the fat, then add the sauce and bake for another 15-20 min or put in crockpot to cook on low.

They are amazing and SO ADDICTING! And you can make the sauce and water chestnuts ahead of time, storing them separately in your fridge. Then, make them right before everyone walks in the door and they come out delicious and crunchy.

These are really tasty, but time consuming and messy to make.  They are so rich and good that they are worth the time and the mess.

These were pretty good but I think I was a little disapointed because the sauce is very much like BBQ sauce.  Overall not bad though.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.

This is the exact recipe my mother prepared for 30 years as a private chef .   It is excellent and always one of the first appetizers to disappear.

This recipe does "not" have to be served warm.   It tastes great the next day without reheating.  The sauce after cooling really caramelizes and tastes wonderful.

This is a terrific recipe!  I took the tip of wrapping them first and then I kind of dipped them into the sauce and used a brush to hit the tops....  I also baked them about 20 minutes prior to putting the sauce on and then baked another 30 to 40 minutes or so.....  I used a 9x13 pan that has a rack that inserts on top and placed a foil lining underneath to catch the drippings, easy clean up! I had some leftovers and if you remove the toothpick, you can use the Presto Pizzazz pizza oven to heat them up, works great!!

I bought fully-cooked bacon by Oscar Meyer so I could easily tear them in half lengthwise and width wise.  Wrap the chestnuts and THEN pour the sauce over them.  Took it to a party in an electric fry pan to warm them up and had extra toothpicks. I needed a quick and less messy solution.

I cut the bacon in half before wrapping, and bake for 30 minutes at 325.  Then I drain the grease before adding the sauce.  I then cook for another 30 minutes.  I also found dipping the water chestnuts and bacon into the sauce covered them more evenly.  Then I spoon the remaining sauce over each one to make sure it is good and thick.

I will definitely make it again.  I agree with turning up the heat to 425, and then crisping it under the broiler for about 3 minutes or so.  BBQ works fine instead of the sauce.  Cutting the bacon in half lengthwise and also width-wise is also good advice - you still end up with plenty of bacon per water chestnut.

I made these for Christmas Eve and they were a hit. The only thing I did differently was dip each bacon wrapped chestnut in the sauce after I had inserted the toothpick, rather than pour the sauce over them before wrapping. I thought it would be messy to try wrapping them after the sauce was poured on.

Don't follow the instructions as shown! 
This is a great recipe if prepared properly!
Wrap the water chestnuts with bacon, and then bake until brown and crisp -- around 40 minutes. (I use a broiler pan so the fat drains off.) Drain the bacon fat. Put into an oven proof baking dish and pour the prepared sauce over. Bake another 20 minutes. If you follow the recipe as shown, you won't get crispy bacon, and your sauce will be filled with grease from a pound of bacon!

I have made this at least six times and it is a favorite at every function I've taken it to.  I have used both thin and thick sliced bacon.   With the thick bacon, I microwave it a little in advance and that makes it easier to wrap around the chestnuts.  I also found with the thick cut bacon that it helps to bake it about half the time without the sauce and then drain the grease and add the sauce.

I have made this three years in a row for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family loves these and they are so easy!!! I did as another reviewer suggested and wrapped the chestnuts first and then poured sauce over them. Much less mess. Yummy! The new tradition in our house.

Really good. I bake the bacon/chestnuts without the sauce until bacon is almost done. Drain off grease, then add sauce. Also half the sauce.

The best tip I can give for this recipe is to replace the ketchup with Devil's Spit bbq sauce. The little bit of spicy kick will complement the sweetness of the brown sugar extremely well.Also, wrap the chestnuts then pour the sauce over it.
