I liked this recipe.  I didn't have red wine, so I used white and it was just as good.  I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

Very tasty.  I used a a homemade BBQ sauce.  It blended perfectly with the rest of the ingredients.  I thought it might be a little bit too spicy for my young son with all of the chili powder but it wasn't at all.

This recipe is too easy, and very good. I used a crockpot to make it even easier.  The base recipe is great.  To be creative, I threw in some garlic and onions at the beginning.  Once it finished cooking, I threw in more onions and mushrooms.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was perfect - very tender. Served with Au Gratin Potatoes from this website as well along with fresh roasted broccoli. Yummy!

I'm a vegetarian and have no idea how to cook meat.  This was my first attempt cooking meat for my family (all carnivores) and they loved it!  I got rave reviews and was asked to make it again soon.  Thanks for the great (and truly easy) recipe!

Made exactly as written, scaled for a 4.5 pound brisket (not 'flat cut', just nicely trimmed). Took about 4-5 hours on my stove, but was totally fantastic. No changes needed!

great with "a very popular BBQ sauce".  mine was slightly overdone in 2 hours. I think next time I will bring to a simmer then transfer to a 300 degree oven. I used grass fed beef and a Dutch oven over a gas stove.

My whole family enjoyed this delicious meal.  I will make this one of our staple meals for the home.  It is very rare to see my kids devour a meal this isn't Mcdonalds, chicken fingers, and pizza.
