Wow. I was somewhat cautious about this recipe, because uncooked eggs scare me a little. But I had a house full of 11-year-old boys, so I knew the cake would be eaten. It is *wonderful* frosting. I didn't use the rum ('cause of the kids), but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Smooth and creamy without being sickly sweet and fatty. I'll definitely make this again, though I admit I'm still a little queasy about the raw egg yolks.

I made this recipe with my 4-year old grandson for his parents' anniversary. We substituted hot orange juice for the coffee and rum to accommodate individual taste. It was the fastest, easiest, tastiest recipe we've ever made! Lots of possibilities for variations!

It tasted great, but was very thin.  I had to add a lot of extra powdered sugar to make it thick enough to stand up to icing on a cake.

Use pasturized eggs and you don't have to worry about the raw eggs, or even egg substitute.

I was kind of skeptical when I read the recipe.  I didn't have much confectioners sugar so I tried this one.  I was pleasantly surprised! Very easy and good flavor! Turned out glossy and the perfect consistancy.  I just dipped my cooled cupcakes right into the blender and they came out with a perfect little curl on top! I will keep this recipe and use it again!  My kids even liked it and they are my worst critics!

I used no-added-sugar carob buttons instead of chocolate buds. Definitely, you have to watch how much liquid you put in this. I used 1 Tabsp boiling water instead of coffee, and proceeded from there. Added more sugar to compensate for the NAS Carob. It was a great consistency at that point. I added maybe 2 teasp of extra water at that point so I could sweeten it with more sugar, and I ended up with a sloppy mix that could have taken heaps of sugar to thicken up again. I only added one egg yolk (all that I had) and it still seemed to cope with that. Overall, great recipe.

This did not work at all for me. It was more like a ganache and not a buttercream (as I know them). I added quite a lot of powdered sugar and it worked out okay.

The coffee was way too strong for me! Also, it had a weird twang to it. Tasted OK on the cupcakes, but wasn't what I was looking for.

I followed the recipe (except used coconut rum instead of dark) and it turned out great. To people concerned about consistency, remember that  butter cream frosting is temp sensitive. when it comes out of the blender, it will be very liquidy, but put in the fridge for a bit and it will become thick. Tastes great!

recipe was very runny, not at all what I wanted. I had to add lots of powdered sugar trying to stiffen the frosting so I could use it.

I loved how easy it was to make but the flavor was not what I was looking for.   The texture was all wrong for a buttercream.  I ended up having to add a total of 2 CUPS of powdered suger.  Next time I will use 1/4 c hot heavy whipping cream and exclude the rum.  That suits my tastes a little better.

great deep chocolate flavor.  i just melted the chips and added 1 yolk, also didn't add any sugar as we like the flavor the chips without it.  it's a little fluid but thickening up as it cools so may or may not need to add a pinch of sugar.

This was just a great recipes.  I was really pressured for time and throwing everything in the blender was so fast.  My company really loved it.  I had made a three tiered chocolate cake and used this for the filling and the top.  Definitely a keeper!

I used Kahlua instead of rum, had to add lots more coffee to get my small blender to mix it.  Great Flavor, I will try amaretto next time.

Pretty good frosting!  It is, as others have mentioned, quite thin, and different from traditional buttercreams, but it does thicken up as cooled.  

My biggest issue with it is that the flavor is definitely more mocha than plain chocolate, thanks to the coffee.  I'm sure I could sub it with something else to change the flavor (I'm excited about trying orange juice like someone else mentioned!)  I also did vanilla instead of rum, for preferences of the individuals eating the cake. 

I loved how easy and quick it was to make!  That was my main reason for trying it.  I'll def make it again when doing simple cakes, I don't see this working with decorating.  I was able to pipe a few cursive words, but it's very runny and wouldn't hold up without lots of refrigerating first. :)  Thanks for the recipe! :D

This was the easiest recipe and quick. My father-in-law came by unexpectadly and I needed a quick frosting. My husband who's very picky had seconds. A winner. I didn't find it too thin I even took last little bit in bowl to make little curls.
