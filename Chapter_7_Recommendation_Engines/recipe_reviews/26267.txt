This was fast and good, but I doubled the spices and added a tblspoon of cocoa powder to make it a little more Cincinnati Chili style. Also did it on the stovetop just as quickly.

This is so quick and easy. I made it a bit more "mexican" by substituting rotell for the crushed tomatoes and black beans for kidney beans...yummy!

Good, good stuff! I was going to make just regular old spaghetti, then decided last minute I wanted spaghetti with a test, so I found this!  I want to stress that I DID NOT make this in the microwave, though I suppose it would be okay.  I just thought it would taste better after simmering on the stove for awhile.  The only change I made was using ground turkey rather than ground beef.  Oh, and the sauce....do not leave off the sauce.  The sauce makes this, in my opinion.  Yum, yum, yum!

The adults loved it, the kids not so much.  They didn't like beans with their noodles.  I think it was the texture rather than the taste.  This is a creative recipe and worth trying.

Hey, this reminds me of a recipe my dad used to make too! I have been looking for this for sometime. A good hearty recipe for cold nights, and a nice change from regular spaghetti. Yum!
