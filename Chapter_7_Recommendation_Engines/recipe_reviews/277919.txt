OMG!! These cookies are phenomenal! I made them per recipe instructions and didn't vary anything. They are amazing and so easy to make. Be sure and don't over bake them or they loose that special fudgyness. My husband and sons love these cookies!

I stuck to the recipe, but the salt on top added too strong of a flavor so I brushed it off and the cookies were perfect. Overall this is a delicious recipe that everyone in the family will enjoy.

My daughter, my husband and myself  loved these cookies.  The recipe was easy to follow.  If you are chocolate lover these are great and the sea salt just adds even more flavor.

I only used 6 tablespoons of butter and left out the 1\3 c of brown sugar . I doubled the recipe and used a small scoop cause like the other review not keen on huge cookies. The batter was a lot wetter than any cookie recipe I have made. A lot like a brownie. I also put the salt on before baking. I was glad I used unsalted butter cause the first batch was too salty. After tasting the second batch I decided to add some chocolate chips and chopped walnuts, and didn't put the salt on top. I liked these better but still won't be making these again. I made 24 that were meh and 24 that were just ok

Very tasty cookies! The batter reminded me of a brownie.  I followed the recipe for the ingredients, with the addition of 1/2 cup chopped pecans.   Since we like smaller cookies, I used a #30 disher, and they were a perfect size for us.  I added the salt (flaked sea salt) before baking so it would stay on better, adding a little extra on the edges after baking for 11 minutes.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe.
