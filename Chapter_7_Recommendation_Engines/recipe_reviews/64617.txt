Not much flavor to this recipe.  I am glad that I tasted it before making the sandwiches.  I added paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, a little oregano and basil.  I also add just a pinch of brown sugar to minimize any tartness of the tomato paste.  Next time I think I will use chicken bouillon instead of beef.  I just like the flavor better.

I have hungry teenagers, and they gobbled this up.  I added some extra spices, some red wine vinegar and some sugar.  Much cheaper than going out to eat.  The delicious smell filled our house for hours.  I will make again soon.

Very nice recipe that is simple to prepare. Added some additional seasonings for our own personal tastes.

This was pretty good but I wasn't wowed by it. Nothing spectacular, but pretty easy, which is nice. I'll probably make it again.

I thought this was pretty good and certainly very easy--which I loved! I did add some minced garlic but other than that followed the directions to a tee--it was good on buns with reduced fat provolone.  It's pretty healthy--only 4 ww points for the meat but I do agree it's pretty salty--will cut back on the bouillion next time!

I thought this was pretty good. I served it sliced instead of shredded-no buns-and my family loved it. I was told to definatly keep the recipe. The leftovers were even eaten and I can't get them to eat leftovers for nothing!

I wasn't terribly thrilled with this one, it just tasted like standard stewed beef. It was good on fresh rolls with provolone cheese though. It was easy to make, but I don't think I'll make it again. This one definitely smelled better than it tasted.

I didn't really find this very different in overall taste from a basic slow-cooker pot roast or stew-type recipe, except there are no vegetables in this one. It was decent, not much to rave about although I did like the touch of provolone on kaiser.

I purchased and eye of round roast to add variety to our meals since our tight budget dictates nearly all home-cooked meals.  This is one of the only recipes I could find that used that cut.  My husband liked the flavor, but wanted to give this recipe 3 1/2 stars because it was too salty.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt since I used a smaller cut of meat and I can see why other people might enjoy it.  I wasn't enamored with the tomato-based sauce, being more of a BBQ purist.  I won't be trying this or the eye or round again.

Just tried this tonight, it's very tasty! I only had bouillon cubes instead of the loose powder and I used four instead of six because of sodium concerns. I also added 1/4 cup more water just because 1/2 cup didn't seem like enough. It probably would have been fine but I wanted it more saucy.

Good basic recipe. I added additional spices before cooking as another reviewer suggested. I would also recommend doubling the sauce. It comes out a little dry otherwise. But we enjoyed it, it is AWESOME on toasted onion rolls.
