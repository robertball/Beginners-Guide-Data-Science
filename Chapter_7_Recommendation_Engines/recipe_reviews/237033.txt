Great flavor and not real spicy. I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken this and I ended up adding some ginger... but it would have been fine as written.

We loved this. The wings were delicious. They were sweet with a little spice. We made them exactly as the recipe said. It may be a little heavy on the garlic but we didn t mind. We fried them extra crispy and used Frank s Redhot. I would almost go as fair as saying they were as good as any take out wings.

Delicious! I don't think I used quite as much garlic as called for but I think I was close (I didn't measure it). Great sticky spicy sweet flavor combo...a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

So good.. Tasted like a sweet Asian sauce. I made a double recipe of the sauce and saved the extra for another night. wasn't spicy at all. Granted... I used Frank's Red Hot WING sauce instead of just hot sauce. Thanks for the recipe!
