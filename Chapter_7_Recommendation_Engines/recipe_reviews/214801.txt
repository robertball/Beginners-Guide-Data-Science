As written, I really didn't care for this. The triple sec and sweet and sour mix were way too overpowering. I ended up tripling the cola (I used Diet Coke), and it made it much more enjoyable.

I forget where I first heard of this recipe, but this is my go to drink at home! Easy to make and remember, and the ingredients are usually kept in any bar. Not to mention, the taste is fantastic!
