Easy and Quick to prepare. WOW did it impress the guests. I made a batch with Brandy and without and both were a huge hit. I had to make more and I've since used it for another party. The only warning I have is you have to chill it for quite some time. It's not a make it and drink it recipe, although we used ice the first time due to time constraints and it was still GREAT!

Make sure you use whole milk, not skim.  That was my mistake.  Otherwise, very good.

Needs more spice... I added some 1tsp of Nutmeg before chilling and then also for garnish.

Easy and delicious.  Could use a bit more spice to my taste but I tried without the bourbon.

We usually drink light egg nog because of the calories and fat in regular eggnog so I used Borden's skim condensed milk and 2% milk instead of whole.  It was delicious and so easy - thank you!

I just made this and thought it was pretty good.  I like being able to control the amount of nutmeg.  My son,(who is 4 and has been asking me for eggnog since last Christmas)on the other hand, told me "Yuck!", the store eggnog is better.  Oh well, I guess you can't please everybody.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I do not drink egg nog but my family and guests do. I have made this several times and the only complaint I have received is that it is too sweet if you are not adding brandy. If you will not be using any alcohol I would suggest adding more cinnamon and nutmeg, or just add less condensed milk. It is perfect with more cinnamon and nutmeg. Very tasty

This recipe turned out well with the thickness and taste of store-bought egg nog.  I'm partial however to the varieties that use only egg yolks, milk , and cream.  This wasn't bad.  I'm very leary of uncooked eggs though and cooked the whole mix (minus the alcohol and one cup of the milk) over low heat in a heavy saucepan until the mixture started to appear thick like custard.  I then removed it from the heat and poured in the last cup of milk and whisked well to remove any lumps.  It still turned out great, yet was less risky with the eggs cooked.

This was good.  I did not make it with the brandy made it for our family of 6.  It was sweet but did not remind me of eggnog.  It really tasted like the sweetened condensed milk.  Maybe adding more milk and eggs would make it better.  Just was a bit different for me.

I thought this was a bit too sweet, but used it as my base to experiment. This is what I did, I doubled all the other ingredients but kep it to one can do condensed fat free sweetened milk. Gave it out as Christmas gifts. Everyone loved it!

This is an annual make every Christmas. I skip the salt, but add in cinnamon instead. I use skim milk to decrease calories, and I think it tastes great...whole milk isn't needed. Especially if you serve with whipped cream and your alcohol of choice. Very good!
