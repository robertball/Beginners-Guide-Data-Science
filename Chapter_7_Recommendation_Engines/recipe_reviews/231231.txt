I winced a little when I added the cream of mushroom soup to this recipe...I actually really like cream of mushroom soup in certain dishes, but I just didn't think it would be right in this dish. Surprisingly -- it was ok. However, the recipe was really missing something. If I were to make it again, I would cut down on the cheddar cheese a little (even though I'm a cheese LOVER...it was a bit much, and it made the consistency of the spaghetti a little off), use a little less pasta (maybe even half), and add more seasonings -- like garlic, black pepper, etc. I might even try adding about a half a pound of Italian sausage for a little more flavor. Overall, the dish was okay, but it was just a little too bland and boring for the expense of the ingredients. If I make it again, I will tweak it significantly. Thanks for a good base, though.

I absolutely loved this dish. I would probably add garlic salt for a bit more flavor. I added a red bell pepper as well as a green, and I'm glad I did; it added just a hint of sweetness. The thing that really sold me on this, though, was how filling it was. I made the pan for my husband and me, and it lasted us almost a whole week. So, just a few tweaks to serve personal taste, and this is a fantastic and filling meal.

interesting twist on my regular spaghetti and meat sauce. I used sweet Italian sausage vs. hamburger, added garlic, Italian seasoning and ground pepper. Also, don't waste your time prepping a 9x13, it won't fit. Use 2 or a larger baking dish if you follow the recipe.

Great recipe and directions!  I'm allergic to mushrooms so I had to skip that part but everything was yummy.  I added fresh garlic to my veggies and seasoned my ground turkey a little more to ensure I had really good flavor and it came out deeeelicious!!!

Made this dish for a party... It was hit! The mushroom soup really makes the sauce rich. I make baked spaghetti a lot but the changes this  recipe suggest were great.

Love this hearty dish. Used cream of mushroom soup with garlic for even more flavour. Need to use a larger dish to avoid spill over.

Turned out pretty good.  Wasn’t as flavorful though. Next time I’ll add some garlic too it.

Very good and easy, with ingredients I most always have on hand. Added some garlic/pepper for our taste.

I omitted the onion and green pepper and seasoned the beef with Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt. I also added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce for some flavor. (a tip I learned from a friend years ago)  Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was amazing. Definitely a keeper.

I added 1lb of mild Italian sausage. I felt like it was too much noodle for 1lb of meat. It turned out great! My family loved it!
