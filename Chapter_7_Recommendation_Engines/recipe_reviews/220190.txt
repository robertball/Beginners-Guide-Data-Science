This is one of our family's favorite pizzas. I like to use my own homemade taco seasoning,  homemade salsa and homemade refried beans. If I don't have time for a homemade pizza crust, I use two cans of refrigerated crescent roll dough. If you have it leftover, this is a good way to use leftover taco meat or even leftover chicken/beef fajita filling from the night before. This is good either hot or cold--my family likes it both ways. GREAT spin on mexican-themed dinner night.

So easy, and so "D"elicious! If you love tacos and you love pizza then this combination is for you! I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef and used "Taco Seasoning II" from this site. For the prepared pizza crust I opted for a Boboli bread shell and used homemade salsa I had on hand. I also opted out extra the cilantro. After the "pizza" cooled a bit, I topped it with all the "taco" toppings to make it nice and pretty: de-seeding my tomato and adding a little homemade guacamole. The leftovers are fabulous too, that is is you have any....

I made this recipe for the weekly recipe group selection. We really liked this pizza and wonder why we never thought about it ourselves. I used regular pizza dough, pre-baked it for five minutes at 425° so it won't be soggy and it held the pizza just fine. Couldn't find the canned tomatoes specified, so I used a 10oz. can of tomatoes and diced green chilies, with the salsa and just added in some fresh minced garlic and onions, used my immersion blender to mix it up. I did mix a bit into the beans to make them easier to spread onto the dough. For the ground beef mixture I used my own taco seasonings, and added in some fresh garlic, onions, and chopped green chilies, then let it simmer for a bit, no need for the extra water addition. It all baked up at 425° in 15 minutes to a perfect golden brown crust. The little bit of sauce leftover was great for dipping the crust. We will make this one again when we can't decide, Tacos or Pizza?

Exceptional! Taco pizzas are not liked in this household...not even restaurant quality taco pizzas...but D's Taco Pizza changed that! It even reheated very well for the next 2 days. I made homemade pizza dough since I could not find the one referred to in the recipe and it still turned out great! This is a definite remake!! Thanks D! :)

This is a great taco pizza! I doubled the recipe and made two pizzas.  This was a big hit at dinner last night!  The "sauce" makes quite a bit extra (like twice as much as we needed) but it is really yummy drizzled on top of the pizza and also as a salsa with chips!!  Also, I pre-baked my thin crusts for about 5 mins. and my pizzas still took probably about 30 minutes to be done to our liking.  Next time I might try increasing the oven temperature.  I've never been a fan of taco pizzas in the past - but this recipe is the bomb!  Thanks for sharing, Daisy K!

Yum! I never had a taco pizza and was looking forward to making this (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*). Made two changes only to make it easier for myself. The first was after the beef mix was prepared and the diced tomato mix was prepared I mixed the two of them together (yes there is sauce leftover). The second was using a whole wheat flour tortilla instead of prepared pizza crust. I used my judgement in the amount that I layered on the tortilla knowing it wouldn't hold the weight that a pizza crust would. This change allowed me to make about 8 pizzas. Very forgiving, adaptable and delicious pizza that will be made again!! Thanks Daisy.

Taco night or pizza night? Stand your ground and have BOTH! I've made this twice and liked it both times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, using Seasoning For Tacos (AR recipe) and an Against The Grain pizza shell. It was very good, but I thought the beans could be a little more saucy, so the next time I used the same seasoning and crust, but mixed some of my homemade picante sauce with the beans, then spread them together on the crust, omitting the extra work of prepping the sauce. Faster and even better!

FANTASTIC!! Made it for a work party and it was gone before I knew it. I added taco sauce atop of the beans instead of using the diced tomatoes and salsa, then sprinkled the cilantro and garlic atop of the pizza (skipping the lettuce) and also added black olives and black beans...YUMM-O!! thanks for the post :)

Made for Recipe Group. This requires quite a bit of prep to put together. Even with the salsa the 'sauce' needed some extra flavor and made way too much. I think taco sauce mixed in with some salsa might be a way to go here. I skipped the olives and cilantro, not a fan of either. I put the sour cream in a bag, cut the tip and squeezed it over the pizza, worked great! It was tasty once all the ingredients are put on and tastes like a soft taco. Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  18, May 2013 ~ My DH is a huge fan of taco pizza and I am not.  This recipe made me a “homemade” taco pizza fan.  I wasn’t positive on the crust it called for, so I used 2 Betty Crocker® pouches.  I mixed it up, spread it and pre-baked at 450° for 5 minutes.  When making the sauce, you will have a lot leftover – we used it in place of the additional 1 cup salsa.  I layered the ingredients as called for and baked at 350° for 20 minutes.  Knowing that we would not finish the entire pizza in one sitting, and not wanting to reheat the lettuce and tomatoes, I only “topped” half of the baked pizza.  This worked perfect.  The next night I reheated the pizza in the oven and when it was hot I topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and green onion.  I did omit the black olives, as we are not fans.  It tasted like I had just made the pizza.  My hubby and son topped their pizza with crushed taco chips, sour cream and the leftover pizza sauce.  This recipe was wonderful and knowing how much my family enjoys taco pizza, I would not hesitate to make this version again.

I used a thin prepared crust and did not adjust the toppings correctly. The other half said it was OK but missing something, I think it had too much cold toppings for the thin crust. It would have been better on a regular thicker crust, or the thin would have worked if I used less toppings. I will give a little time to past for the other half, and try it again on a thicker crust, and post a update to this.

Fantastic recipe!  Wouldn't change a thing.  I used a Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough crust and skipped the cilantro in the "sauce".  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  I used homemade pizza crust (that I had previously partially baked and froze).  It was thin and crispy, so it gave it a taco shell-like crunch.  I put green onions and olives on it before baking, and added tomatoes, lettuce, avocado slices (we love avocado with our tacos), and sour cream to it afterwards.  I made it per the recipe, but the thing I would change would be the sauce.  I think there was way too much.  Too much on the pizza itself, and then too much leftover.  Although it was really a delicious sauce, I don't think it needs a whole can of tomato and a cup of salsa.  Maybe next time I'll use just one or the other, still adding the cilantro.  Otherwise, it was really delicious, and I will make again!

Pretty good! While I prefer a more traditional pizza, this was a fun change of pace nonetheless. My husband especially enjoyed dipping his tortilla chips in the remaining taco sauce. :) I think I would have liked this much better had my crust crisped up. Despite baking my Boboli crust directly on my oven rack, it was pretty soggy. I'll try a different crust next time or bake this as a deep dish pizza using frozen bread dough instead (this seems to crisp up better, IMHO). All in all, this was a great compromise between my husband's request for tacos and my taste for pizza. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Daisy! :-)

This was excellent.   To make again, I would cut the total sauce in half, but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.   Thanks for the great recipe.

We all loved this.  I used homemade whole wheat pizza crust, homemade refried beans, and cooked/peeled fresh tomatoes in place of canned.  I also made 2 pizzas, so doubled most ingredients.  However, I only used 8 oz cheese between the two pizzas.  Still turned out great!

If you like tacos, you'll like this!  I was making three different pizzas for a party, so to save time, I skipped making my own tomato mixture, opting for purchased salsa. Added garlic and oregano to my homemade crust. Spread in pan, coated it with olive oil and spread garlic on it. Cooked at 425 for 10 minutes. Topped with refried beans, beef mixture, salsa, cheese. Cooked 10 more minutes. Topped with lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, olives and sour cream. I had intended to also add diced avocado, but forgot them in the rush. Was a hit with everyone!

Pretty good taco pizza.  I left off the olives more bc they are what I like, and hubs doesn't, plus the only thing of olives we have right now are a huge Costco can of them and I wasn't sure I wanted to add that to the fridge today.  I used the Italian Pizza Dough recipe on here for the crust, and that worked well--I parbaked it at 425 for 10 minutes, then put the toppings on.  I don't know that I would make the tomato salsa mixture again--there was enough for 2 pizzas, and we didn't really use it for dipping.  I liked it, don't get me wrong, but it made a lot.  Perhaps I'll make another taco pizza with it later this week, or use it as picante sauce in something.  All in all, this was a pretty decent taco pizza and we enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe but it was lacking a tad in diverse flavor but I will make again and add some items.
