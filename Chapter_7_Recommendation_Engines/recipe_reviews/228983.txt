I made some fresh homemade pesto sauce for the pizza.  Next, I roasted Roma tomatoes, jalapenos, and shallots which had been tossed with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).  By roasting my veggies, I bought a slight sweetness to the toppings to nicely balance the bite of the pesto sauce.  Sauteed some Baby Portobello mushrooms in EVOO.  To assemble the pizza, I used a pre-baked whole wheat pizza crust and then added the following in this order - pesto sauce, baby spinach, tomatoes, jalapenos, shallots, mushrooms, feta cheese, and freshly shredded smoked mozzarella cheese.  Wooooooo, Buddy!  This was the absolute best pizza I've ever made.  It was an "Out of This World Meal" which earned me the prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

Crazy fast and easy, perfect after a long day at work. My only complaint is that the pesto gave off a lot of oil that just puddled on the plate. Next time I'll use less. Otherwise this was perfection.

This was very good, a little intense and I burned my crust a bit which didn't help. I would bake it at a lower temperature for longer next time.

This was yummy. On the rich side - I may experiment with making my own pesto next time and using less mozzarella (the feta added more flavor and the mozzarella may have added to the heaviness). I used slices of Roma tomatoes this time. The spinach got a little crispy, which was really good.

YUM...I knew this was gonna be a winner and it was! Great combo of flavors. I used homemade peasto sauce, and I know that made a huge difference. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing! :)

i did not use a store bought crust.  i make my crust from a recipe on this site (pizza dough III) but i add oregano, garlic powder, basil and dried italian seasoning to the flour.  then i layered the pesto, a little motz, spinach, tomatoes, caramelized onions, more motz and then the feta.  it was fabulous.  didn't even miss the ham or pepperoni or bacon.

I made it and kept to the recipe.  I however, I only had only a portion of the pesto sauce that was called for.  This could have been the reason I thought it was just a little dry.  I however loved the taste of the spinach and tomato. The Feta was alright.  May or may not make again.

This is great!  I used homemade pesto which I really think makes a difference and I didn't have feta cheese so I use blue cheese.  Loved it!
