After a few modifications, this was amazing!  I happened to have all this stuff on hand and I wanted to use it up so I tried this recipe.  I added peanuts to the dry ingredients and the chocolate powder went into the wet ingredients, as suggested by another reviewer.  I thought that the wet ingredients were not wet enough, so I also added 3 tbsp of butter.  I originally tried pouring the wet ingredients on top of the dry ingredients, as written the recipe.  However, they would not seep down (wet ingredients still too thick), so I ended up just mixing them in.  I'm so glad I did; it was not crumbly at all, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again, with the modifications as described.

Quick, easy and delish!! Will make again. I used almond butter and no sugar, just the honey. I bought some healthier grain rice cereal at the helathfood store.

We really enjoy these bars and what I do is pack the mixture down into the pan to keep the bars from being crumbly. I also stir the cocoa into the hot liqiud before mixing with the cereal.

I hate giving bad reviews but this was a crumbly mess. I didn't change a thing either. What a waste of some expensive ingredients too. This recipe is for the birds...

I love these bars!  They are not so healthy with all that sugar, but there is some good nutrition in them, especially if you add in some extras like flax seed and nuts.

This is a great, healthy snack to make!  The cocoa gives the granola bar great flavor, while not being overly sweet.  Very good.  My kids gobbled this one up!!

Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!  This recipe is easy and fast to make, healthy, and it tastes great!  I love the fact that you can use whatever you have in the kitchen and it still turns out yummy.  I've made this twice -once with coconut, once without.  Both times it was good, although i did like it with the coconut better. I used chunky pb, didn't have sesame seeds, so i added slivered almonds and flax seeds instead.  Came out delicious. One thing I did notice is that it doesn't taste so great right after you make it.  Wait a day or so, and it's perfect! Next time, I'm going to add even more coconut, and I'll add some marshmellows too. (not very healty, I know, but still good.)  Happy non-baking!

These were really simple to make, and I didn't find them to be at all crumbly.  I also packed them into the pan, so perhaps that's why.  I prefer these to the usual no-bake cookies.

I left out the coconut and added some wheat germ.  This is a good recipe to mix and match with whatever is in your cabinet.  Husband gave it 4 stars.

mmm, I like these birdseed squares!  they are a nice energy boost before (or after) jogging, a great chocolate fix...and i love the peanut butter flavour, and the variety of seeds/cereal/nuts.  It will be fun to try different variations!  thanks!

These were a great treat to throw together for a family treat reminding me of the calssic chocolate no-bake cookies that my grandmother made.  OOPs, I left out the peanut butter.  We'll just mix that in now.  Uh oh, too bad I forgot to add the crispies.  No problem, just toss them in.  Oops, I forgot the oatmeal too!  Ah, it's only been a few minutes, stir those in too.  
After finally getting ALL the ingredients mixed in I pressed them into the pan (again) and let them set up.  They ended up being a bit crumbly, though next time they will be perfect.  Also I substituted flax seed for the sunflower seed.

I hate to give a bad review too but these were just a crumbly mess for me as well. There did not seem to be the right ratio of dry of stick ingredients, because there was so much loose cereal left over afterward, that I will just have to throw out.

I LOVE this recipe.  It's the best way I've found to get plenty of raw nuts and seeds into my kids.  (Baking them compromises the natural oils and makes them much less nutritious.)  Tasty without being too sweet.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup, and substituted some of the oats with ground flax.

I work in a school, so nuts & peanuts are a big no-no. We made this recipe in my baking class, using tahini (sesame paste) instead of peanut butter. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you for this recipe.

This is very good and easy.  I have made it twice and it disappears quickly.  I cut down on the brown sugar after the first time because it was a little too sweet for us.

The taste was great, the idea wonderful, however, it was somewhat crumbly.  I will try this recipe again and revise it to make it more "stay together".

I make these often and love them! I do change a few things though. I add the cocoa to the saucepan and cook it with the sugar/honey mixture. I also don't add the vanilla until it is done cooking. You have to work fast. Pour the hot mixture into the cereal mixture right after taking it off the burner, mix it very thoroughly and press into the pan firmly immediately. If you don't go fast, your mixture will become crumbly.

I had some not all of the ingredients so what I am reviewing is my interpretation but it turned out fantastically. I did not add the coconut nor the oats. I used Alpen (sugar free)muesli cereal and had some seed and fruit mix sachets added as well. Melted Dark chocolate was sprinkled over the top. Also I didn't use peanut butter but a mix of butter and olive oil which was all I had available.Muscovado sugar (light)was used for the brown sugar. Delicious and almost feels healthy if it wasn't for the sugar and fat dosage!!

I swapped in millet for the sesame seeds.  Next time I will try using prune purée in place of the honey.  I really liked the original, tho!

Very good and relatively speaking, healthy, treat. I didn't have any problems with the mixture being too dry or crumbly as some have reported. The only changes I made were: only 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup and I didn't have many sesame seeds so I substituted flax seeds for most of the sesame. I also used a mixture of smooth and crunchy peanut butter.Packed it tightly into a 9x13 using a rubber spatula then cut and stored them between layers of wax paper and put in the frig. Fun snack I hope the children will enjoy as an after school treat.

I'm so glad I found the recipe again! I've made this so many times but misplaced my well loved printed copy!

I toast both sesame seeds and flax seeds, sub. 1/4 of flax seeds for the sesame. I also use salted sunflower seeds and unsweetened coconut.

Also, to make things easier, I put the cocoa powder in the wet ingredients, mixes better this way. I've made for many people and always get asked for the recipe, I give them the original, never MY changes!
