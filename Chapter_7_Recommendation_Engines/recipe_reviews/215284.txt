Wow, this was SO good! I made my own poppy seed dressing, and it already had a lot of oil in it, so I just used 3 tablespoons of dressing on the salad. I can't wait to make this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. I searched for a healthy canned salmon recipe and this is it. If I were making for a party I would do the fuller recipe and Iâ€™m sure it would be amazing. I was tying to make it very low fat so I used only lemon and white vinegar and 1 tsp of oil  as the dressing. It was still wonderful. I will make this a staple of my diet. Thank you!!

I used quinoa because that's what I had on hand. I also used a lemon poopy seed dressing from allrecipes. I used about a tablespoon more dressing, as well. Turned out great! I cut the oil by 1 1/2 Tbls and will cut it by another (at least) next time since the dressing itself is pretty oily. All in all it is good and we'll definitely make it again!

I have made this last evening. I didn't have the couscous, but used a bag of rotini pasta instead.  Used 2 cucumbers instead of 1. Added some chopped onion (and a small amount of turmeric 1/4 t. use turmeric  in everything for its health benefits) No hard boiled eggs. No lemon poppyseed dressing but added the juice of 1 lemon. Followed remainder of recipe. Hubby said this was the best salad I ever made, bar none. He said the crunchy cukes made all the difference.
