This was simple & delicious.  We BBQ'd the trout in foil on the grill...it was amazing!  I would reccommend it to anyone as a flavorful delight that wowwed some veteran fish eaters.  Kudo's Allison!

Loved it!  I didn't put in as much lemon juice since I'm on a huge fan of lemon flavored fish.  I also added some onions but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I'm sure I will make this again soon.  Next time I'll probably try it on the grill.

Fantastic dish.  I used OJ instead of lemon juice, and added Ro-Tel diced tomatoes for a little heat. Served over Rice-a-Roni, substituting OJ for 1/4 of water requirement. My husband said it was the best dinner he's ever he'd (and we've been married 10 years)! Thank you, Prettypie!

Loved it!  I followed the directions except I didn't have Sherry Wine, I used a nice Petit Verdot and it turned out fantastic.  I've made this now at least four times and every single time the family loves it.  This is by far and away one of my favorite fish recipes.

I thought this was a wonderful dish - I used canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh, but fresh would have been much better. Very tasty!

Awesome!! Added 1/2 an onion sliced and a minced clove of garlic... We also made a cream sauce with the reduction after removing the fish from the oven....  served with butternut squash cakes with fresh rosemary... they went together wonderfully!... will definitely make again...  maybe spice up the squash cakes next time.

The fresh mushrooms absorbed so much lemon flavor from the fresh-squeezed lemon juice (and I only used two lemons instead of three) that I could barely eat them, but then I'm not a huge citrus fan.  However, my husband, who LOVES lemon, thought the dish rocked.  The only sub I made was using marsala wine instead of sherry since I didn't have any.  I'll make again, but without nearly as much lemon.  Oh, and you can finish this on the stovetop if you don't want to heat up the oven; after cooking the mushrooms etc., I added the trout and cooked for about 10 minutes, flipping twice.  I used a cast-iron skillet, so this was a one-pot dish!

I was disappointed in the flavor of this preparation. I won't make it again, because there are much better trout recipes.

This was really good. It took about 40 minutes.  Afterwards, I flipped over the fish and put it in the broiler on high for 5 to 6 minutes.  This made the skin crispy.

It was only ok. But admittedly trout is not my favorite fish and this was frozen not fresh. Had over wild rice with asparagus and spanakopita.

Made with mixed gourmet shrooms and truffle butter.  Less butter than per recipe.  Also added fresh thyme as suggested by one of the reviewers.  Made with ruby trout because it was available.

Hubby rated this "restaurant quality" and "best trout I ever had". Can't believe how easy it is to prepare.

Having never cooked trout before, I searched through the recipes and found Allison's Trout.  So glad I did!  I was only cooking two fillets, so I reduced the amounts and made a few changes to incorporate the ingredients I had.  No lemons, so I substituted orange/pineapple juice.  I also thinly sliced a shallot which I cooked briefly in the butter before adding the mushrooms and juice.  I served this with some mashed potatoes and steamed green beans and decided this meal was a keeper.  Might try adding some thai chili for heat the next time, but this is very, very good as it is.

Tried it tonight and everyone, young and old, liked it.  Just happened to have picked up trout instead of salmon so I was on here looking for a quick recipe.  I was not disappointed! I had all the ingredients and now I have a new fish!!! Thanks so much!
