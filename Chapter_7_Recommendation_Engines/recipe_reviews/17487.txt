This is a very good recipe.  However, there are a few things that people don't understand about puffed oven pancakes.  They don't really taste a lot like griddle pancakes.  They have a more eggy texture and flavor, so if you don't like eggs, don't try this recipe.  One suggestion, this recipes calls for too much butter.  I only added two tbs. and I baked it in a glass pan.  This allowed the pancake to get crispy on the top and bottom.  More butter can be added after it is baked (if desired).

Wow, this is great!  My husband said this is definately a keeper.  I agree :) I used only 3 eggs, thinking it was going to taste too eggy, but it didn't next time I will use 4. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 TBS of brown sugar.  Very scrumptious!

This is a european style oven pancake most often referred to as a German style oven pancake (basically it is a big thick crepe.  My whole family loves this one and there are a couple pick eaters in the mix.  I have made several of this type in the past and what makes this simple recipe the best is the cinnamon.  Top it with whatever you like.  Anything from pancake syrup to berries.  Very easy prep, even kids can do it.

I love how people say, "Well, this recipe wasn't the best..." and then proceed to list all the things they changed until the recipe wasn't even recognizable as the original.  Sigh.
THIS WAS AWESOME! Kids wanted pancakes this morning but we have 7 of them and it takes ALL morning to cook enough for all. This is the PERFECT solution! They all LOVED it and it was so quick and easy! Thanks for posting - it's a keeper for sure

I wasn't blown away by these, but my diabetic husband loved it. I used splenda & my homemade pumpkin pie spice. A lot less butter. Whole Wheat instead of AP and I added in about 2 heaping T of both ground flax & wheat germ. Didn't use the confectioners sugar. Topped it with strawberries, sugar free syrup & pan toasted pecans. He loved it & was thinking of other fruit combos to eat on top.

Delicious, rich oven pancakes that taste like non-sweetened custard.  The second time I made these I doubled the sugar so they could be eaten on thier own with no syrup.

This was fun to make and really easy. I think a touch of salt added to the batter would be just the thing to bring out all the flavour and make it 5 stars. After blending up the batter and putting it in the pre-heated pan, I blended up some wild blueberries with maple syrup and a bit of sugar, and then warmed that up for a sauce.

super good pancake, I have made oven pancakes before but this was much better. The pancake here was a little thicker (custard like)which was nice for a change. I added 1tsp of cinn. just because i like it, also added ? about 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm glad I went with other reviews and used half the butter.  I made a few small changes.  added half tsp vanilla, did 2tbl white sugar with 2tbl brown sugar, then used half white flour and half wheat flour and it came out perfect.  This is quick and easy and I'll definitely make it again!

My husband adores german pancakes, andhe loved this recipe. I hate eggs and I really liked it, too. It was more like a bread pudding, next time I  will probably split it between two cake pans and see how that turns out. I preferred it with some vanilla, and then sprinkled liberally with lemon juice and powdered sugar. Yum!

This was very good. My whole family loved this one. So much so that I will have to double the recipe each time that I make it. I did take the advice of other reviews and used less butter. I only used 2 T and it was plenty. I also added 2 tsp vanilla and 2 T brown sugar per the advice from another review. Since there was white sugar and brown sugar, I just completely omitted the confectioners' sugar. I will be making this often. It was really good.

A little too buttery for me, but overall a yummy, easy recipe. I added vanilla to the mix, and we were out of cinnamon, so I used Pampered Chef's Mocha Hazelnut Sprinkle in its place.

Absurdly greasy and very thick...nearly inedible. If I made this again I would use half the butter and a much larger pan.

Sooo easy and quite delicious!  Only change I would make is to cut back on the butter to 1/4 cup.  Thanks for a great pancake!

I have tried several variations of this recipe because I like the idea of an oven pancake. This is my favorite of those recipes. Doesn't need so much better but works just fine with it. Can be topped with anything, I prefer syrup to confectioners' sugar. This is the one that went into my recipe box. Compared to other similar recipes this one has less eggs and this makes for a fluffier consistency that I prefer. Now a weekly staple at my house, everyone loves it.

Very tasty.  I used 3 eggs, 1/4 cup butter, and whole wheat flour, but followed everything else.  I couldn't get mine to puff up though.  Maybe I overmixed it? It was like the texture of french toast vs a bread pudding...which is what I liked. Either way, I'll definitely be making this again.  The boyfriend enjoyed it too.

According to my husband this was "addicting" though my kids would rather have regular pancakes.  I added some brown sugar to the mix (not sure how much). After baking I cut it into dunkable pieces  and served it with little cups of syrup and preserves.  The family had fun experimenting with the different flavors.  Quick and easy, it'll be a go to on those rainy Sundays when I don't feel like doing much, thanks for the recipe!

Easy recipe, very easy preparation and excellent outcome.  Was so tasty that we devoured the whole thing.  We ate it with raspberries and strawberries on top and a bit of whipped cream.  Paired it with eggs and hash browns.  Will definitely be making this again, and again and again.

I made the recipe as indicated with the exception of the butter... I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and could have done with a bit less.

Back when our eldest was little, we used a recipe identical to this only titled "Dutch Oven Babies".  Sadly, we lost the recipe and went many years greatly deprived until one day I happened upon this one.  This version is just as awesome and delicious as we remember from all those years ago.  I changed nothing in the recipe, making it as is.  I *love* the cinnamon/sugar on top of it.  And yes, I also found this recipe to be very good with my blood sugars.  Yay!

It was ok, but kind of tasted like bland french toast, and I added brown sugar,  vanilla, and topped with syrup  Quick and easy and edible in any case.

Although, it was not pancake texture, my husband loved it and reminded me that with apples it would be identicle to the "Big Apple" served at a famous breakfast chain restaurant.  My 10 yr old didn't like it. I added vanilla and a little sugar in the blender. WILL make it again, maybe with fruit topping!

This is becoming our "day after a holiday" breakfast. I reduced the butter to 3 T and also added a tsp of vanilla.

These are just like the ones my mother used to make although she called them Dough Babies. I did cut the butter down when mixing and then when it came out basted the top with butter. It was wonderful. Thank you I've been looking for this for YEARS since my mother passed away.

Easy to make, but I agree with the people who said it was too "eggy." I took the advice of others and used 1/4 c butter and it was still too much.  I will not make again.

My son & I weren't looking forward to having cereal or bagels again and I remembered this recipe...couldn't believe how quick and easy it was!
We topped it with strawberries and blueberries and my picky son LOVED it!
I'm wondering if the recipe can be doubled or tripled?  I think this would be great for my big family for Christmas brunch or the Teachers at school for Teacher Appreciation Day.
I will be making this again and again.

Way easier than traditional pancakes! I'm terrible at flipping so this is a dream. They taste delicious too. I would be hard pressed to go back to regular pancakes after these. Mmmmmmmm! I added Vanilla too.

My experience with this recipe was a comedy of errors, but even with everything that went wrong, it still came out tasting very good and with the texture described by other reviewers. I tried this recipe because I was lazy and out of pancake mix. I put the 1/3 cup butter in the oven then discovered I only had 2 eggs in the fridge, so I halved the milk & flour to compensate. I eyeballed vanilla, brown sugar, white sugar & cinnamon. I fumbled the cake pan as I placed it in the oven, spilling half the mixture onto the oven floor. I baked it until the spilled part smoked then moved the pan to the microwave, covering with plastic wrap for 5min on 50%. It came out exactly as others described. While I wound up not caring for the texture, the recipe is awesome. Use it if you are looking for a bread pudding-type texture. Delicious flavor. Have fun. :-)

I loved that this was quick and easy. I saved time, and eggs making breakfast today! I thought about putting vanilla in it, and should have. Next time, I will start putting some fruit in it or something savory. I'll be making this often!

I did a lot of changes to this recipe but the end result was delicious!  I used 1/4 cup butter as previous reviewers suggested.  I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar, 3 eggs plus 1 banana, and added 1 tbsp ground flax seed to the topping.  My kids loved it!

This is a really great recipe.  I did take other's reviews into consideration and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, I actually think it could be cut down a little more (maybe to 2 or 3 tablespoons?) and still be great.  I also didn't use the powdered sugar.  I paired this with some extra crispy bacon, strawberries and blackberries, a little drizzle of caramel and a few drops of Valentina hot sauce!  It sounds weird but believe me, the mixture of salty, sweet and spicy is amazing!

Delicious and super easy. The cinnamon and sugar make a nice crust. I used 3Tbs butter as others suggested and it was perfect amount. My husband who is of british descent thought it looked like a giant yorkshire pudding but the taste was totally different.

I thought it was really good. Needs a little more flavoring so syrup tastes great with it. The cinnamon topping is delicious and I also used only 2 tablespoons of butter

When I was cutting this up for my kids this morning, it seemed to be a custardy, french-toast kind of pancake. I used lowfat buttermilk, half whole wheat and Splenda. I didn't use all the butter called for, just a couple tablespoons was sufficient. I think if I'd used more, it would have been swimming in fat. I spooned Supreme Strawberry Topping over the top (also made with Splenda) and a little bit of FF whipped topping. My kids flipped for it. I again was a rockstar mom. And it literally took minutes this morning. This one's a keeper.

"Can I have more..." was heard throughout the kitchen. I would specifiy that it is imperative to use UNSALTED butter. We are already sensitive to salt but the first thing we tasted was salt. It was easily masked with syrup, however.  Overall, I'm sure we will make this again and again.

This was a quick and easy recipe that my whole family loved!  I read the previous reviews and cut back the butter to 1/4 cup I also added 2 Tbs of brown sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  I put fresh strawberries on top that I had prepared by slicing and adding about 1/3 cup of sugar and letting them sit to produce a strawberry "sauce".  My youngest son LOVED them and kept asking for more!  Great recipe!

Use half the butter, but otherwise this recipe is great, fast, and so easy.  Very filling and delish.  I made mine in a 9" silicon baking form, ontop of a cookie sheet just in case, and it worked out fine.  Will be making this again.

This looks beautiful coming out of the oven!  I doubled the recipe & made it in a 9" x 13" pan.  I only used 1/2 cup butter (instead of 2/3) and 1/4 cup sugar.  It's somewhat crepe-like...a little heavier than your typical pancakes.  We like to eat this with syrup.  When you pour the batter onto the butter, some of the butter will get on yop of the batter.  That's fine as it makes the edges a little brown & crispy.  If you like crepes, give this recipe a try!

I'm sorry to say but this recipe ended up being a complete disaster for me.
My boyfriend doubled the ingredients because he figured this would only be big enough for one person. 4 eggs for one person, or 8 eggs for too people is a lot and not good for you. It also had way too much butter and the entire pancake was floating in liquidy butter which made it crispy on top but mushy on the inside.
I am also very sorry to say that we could not eat it. It tasted nothing like a pancake but more like a very thick omelette and very buttery.

This recipes tasted really good, but it wasn't the "pancake texture" I was hoping for.  It reminded me more of a bread pudding.  I may try it again, but with one less egg.

i added 3 more Tablespoons of flour and 2 teaspoon vanilla. Next time I will add apple and brown sugar and maybe a crumb topping. It was a lot of butter but we liked it.

This reminded us more of a huge popover than a pancake.  My family really enjoyed it.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added vanilla (1 tsp) and sugar (1 tbsp) to the batter.  We will be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

These have become a staple at my house.  We have doubled, tripled and quadripled the recipe - the only thing to watch is that you really beat those eggs.  We have nick-named these Papa's hat because when done in a round dish, it resembles a sombrero.  We usually skip the lime juice.

Simply amazing! It doesn't get easier than this. I did almost everything "wrong" and still got perfect results. I don't have a cast iron skillet. I baked my in a large round ceramic baking dish. I didn't warm the ingredients first. I finished the batter before the oven was ready so it sat for several minutes. It still came out perfect. The presentation is beautiful. It looks like you have been slaving away. My mother absolutely loves the "dutch baby" from the Original Pancake House. This is a total knock off. It was awesome to be able to make this for her over the holidays. She said she liked mine even better than the restaurants. Thanks for the recipe!

I added 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tbsp sugar to the batter, then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over top.  It was great with honey, and hubby said it tasted like french toast and loved it!

Very good I added a little bit of vanilla.  I would use a lot less butter (it came out almost dripping) but overall quite good.

Essentially these are flavored popovers, they're quite tasty but as other reviewers have mentioned, these do not taste like a traditional Pancake.  Infact, they really shouldnt be called Pancakes at all, considering the name itself means that you are making a cake in a stovetop pan.  All and all a nice mulitpurpose baked good.

This was really good! I think the butter called for is a tad to much. Next time I will probably scale back to 1/4 C. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and about 2 TBL of brown sugar to the bottom of the pan with the butter. I then added the batter and it was yummy! I love the added flavor the brown sugar gave! My 2 little girls loved it! My husband thought it was ok. He was not thrilled at the custard texture but he said he would eat it again.  Overall great recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was a big hit in my house but I did make a few additions to the recipe.  I added syrup to the melted butter in the pan, just enough to coat the bottom and then added 4 tsp. of brown suger (I mixed it all together) then poured the batter over that.

My favorite recipe of this type! I added a tsp of vanilla, used brown sugar instead of white and threw in some cinnamon for good measure. It did stick to my pan so I will spray with PAM next time. Delicious and beautifully impressive as well!

My mother used to make an oven pancake as a treat growing up, so I was excited to try out this recipe.  It did not disappoint, we thoroughly enjoyed it Easter morning.  As mentioned in other reviews, I used a little less butter than called for, and I think I could have gone with even less, probably closer to 1/4 cup.  The Cinnamon sugar mixture on top was great.  I will make this again for sure.

I went into this without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. This was unlike anything I have ever had for breakfast. I followed the directions as stated but next time I will cut back a little on the butter. It was good with syrup over it. I will make this again as a treat occasionally.

I was wanting pancakes this morning, but had no baking powder in the house. I found this recipe and even though it's not a "pancake" in the traditional sense, it was wonderful - reminded me alot of french toast and bread pudding - will DEFINATELY make it again!

I have made this MOST satisfying version of pancakes since discovering it over a year or so.  I love the texture of the pancake.  I usually double the recipe for a thicker pancake. I always serve it with a mixture of blueberries and strawberries with a drizzle good Ole Canadian Maple Syrup. YUMMY!

Fantastic recipe. I've tried several Pfannkuchens in the past. This a great one. Like others, I reduced butter to 1/4 cup. However, as the cake cools, the butter swimming around and on top of it is reabsorbed into it. The crust was perfect and the texture was superb. It has to be completely cooked through. So, give it time. I simply had it with maple syrup (with scrambled eggs and sausage) and it was divine. I used a 9 x 2 cake pan, by the way. Also the butter needs to be absolutely sizzling hot before the batter is poured in. I used salted butter for a delicious crust.

It's good!  Quick and easy recipe that feeds about 4-5 adults.  Has more of a French toast taste with a crunchy 'crust' and moist center.  I took some advice from the previous reviews and used 2 Tbsp of butter. Goes great with fruit.  Thank you AR-members for being accurate on the rating.

Pretty good!  Hubs said it was a bit weird but I'm not sure why.  He thought it was a bit like a cross between French toast and bread pudding.  I agree and think it's better than bread pudding in some ways,  which can be ridiculously difficult to get to a consistency I like.  This was not soggy or too hard and wasn't too sweet although I used splenda which I swear has an aftertaste I dislike.  It was incredibly  easy and quick.  Baking times were perfect for my oven.  My only complaint is the amount   of butter;  I cut it down and it was almost too much.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this and am really pleased with the recipe. This reminds me of egg custard pie minus the crust and not nearly as sweet. I did not use all of the sugar or the conf sugar. Really nice and quick. This could be turned into a dessert with a couple of adjustments. A keeper for sure

Reduced butter to 1/4 cup only because it works out to 1/2 stick (easy to measure).  Added some sugar and vanilla to the batter based on other reviews.  No need for a blender, works just as well with a bowl and wire whisk.

Delicious with the addition of a half teaspoon of real vanilla. I can't imagine it being as good without the vanilla, but then, I'm not a real fan of egg flavor.  Since I did alter the recipe I gave it what I think it would have been without the vanilla, since it wasn't a part of the recipe.
Thanks for the recipe JHERCIK!

The only thing this shares with a pancake is the ingredients. It's an entirely different textureâ€”kind of like a baked custard, very eggy and dense, sweet but not overly so. The family liked it but didn't love it; I loved the ease of preparations.

I halved the recipe and used a small skillet. Added cinnamon & sugar to the pan butter. Tastes like a combination French toast & Pancake and we love both! Puffed up well but the center was a tad mushy and flat.  Going to play with the different oven temps used in other "Dutch Baby" recipes. We look forward to trying different fruit fillings for the center. Will probably never make pancakes again!  It's a keeper.

We love this recipe as is! So easy to make and tastes delicious. Sometimes I do change it by adding a little less butter and only 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon (just cause I love cinnamon) just to try to make it a tiny bit healthier and I find I don't notice the changes. But the original is fantastic and we continue to make this a regular breakfast item on weekends for us! Thanks for the recipe!

These were so wonderful! My whole family was so shocked at how good they were! I think they didn't need as much butter next time I make them. Also, I might try to add some blueberries. Amazing recipe!

This is OK.  A little too gooey in the centre.  Not as good as another version called Volcano Pancake.  Won't make this version again.

My family loves loves loves this recipe!!!  I double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 pan for full fluffy delicious pancake. I also serve with strawberry sauce and home-made whipped cream. This recipe is perfect for making with my 9 year old son.  Literally, neighbors, friends and family come out of the woodwork on Oven Pancake Day!

This is ok for what it is. Exceptionally easy to feed a crowd for breakfast all at the same time without standing over the griddle cooking while everyone else is eating. Overall I would say this is more egg-y than a pancake. Reminded me of Yorkshire pudding. I agree that 1/3 cup of butter is not needed, 2-3 Tbs was enough.

This was very good.  I didn't know what to expect, but it came out very good.  Per other reviews, I took out 1 egg and used much less butter. I also added some vanilla extract and some brown sugar.  I just like that combo in breakfast foods.  It was pretty sweet, especially with added syrup.  But my husband, who has a big sweet tooth loved it.  So it passes with flying colors.

I used just 2 tb. of butter and swapped the white sugar with brown sugar. Served this dish for dinner with pineapple chunks and chicken patties. My family really liked it! I enjoyed having "all" the pancakes done at once so I could sit down with everyone and enjoy my meal.

I made this for dinner tonight for something quick and easy. This was the first time my family and I have tried anything like it. I didn't change a thing to this recipe and I loved it. The right combination of sweet and savory. Thank you so much for sharing this, we will be adding this to our arsenal here, lol!

One of the few dishes that I make for dinner that I know everyone will eat! I add a dash of vanilla and double the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I sometimes add fruit to the batter such as fresh or frozen peaches or top the finished pancake with sautÃ©ed apples. Turkey sausage on the side finishes it off. Delicious for breakfast or dinner!

Compared to Chef John's recipe for Dutch Baby on this site, I didn't care for this one. His has only 1/2 cup flour, 3 eggs, 2/3 cup milk, and no sugar or cinnamon.  So yummy with fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar sprinkled on top!

This was a hit!
I followed the other reviewers suggestions and cut the butter in half and added a TBS of brown sugar to the cinnamon/sugar mix.  Next time I'll add a little salt and vanilla to the batter too.  But this recipe is a great jumping off point and makes a yummy, beautifully puffed oven pancake.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I followed it exactly and we added pancake syrup over it once we ate.  It does have more of an egg consistency than a cake consistency (just in case anyone is wondering) and it tastes delicious...full of flavor!

How yummy! It's  like a cross between a pancake and a crepe. This was so easy to make!

Loved it, the only change I made was that I did'n use all the cinnamon-sugar blend (used +/- half of it). Will definately make it again. Then I might add a bit of vanilla and a pinch of salt.

Delicious! My family loves it. My oven is old so we needed to bake it a little longer. My picky 5 year old are it with fresh strawberries and my less picky 6 year old opted for blueberries. All are it without maple syrup which means it is a great dish!!!

Wow, the name pancakes is a bit misleading, as the taste nor look bear any resemblance to pancakes. My way described it best, the combination of Popovers and a Flan. Fantastic, but we drizzle a bit of Maple Syrup rather than dusting with confectioner sugar.

I made 2 changes: I used a mix of brown and white sugar and 6 eggs instead of 4.  I put in in my small oval 9" glass pan.  The only word of caution is that the sides of pancake rise above the pan though it doesn't spill over.  I have a 2 oven range where the top one is very small/short in height.  The dough rose into the upper burner. I will use my bottom, large oven next time.  Also I served with this simple blueberry sauce: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/70112/blueberry-sauce/#recipe-toolbar

I used a slightly smaller pan which gave me much more defined edges. This recipe is amazing and ive had a difficult time NOT making it practically everyday since the first time.

I love it. Great for sleepovers.  I added vanilla to the egg mixture. And I added brown sugar & some cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I just sprinkled two tablespoon white sugar on top with little more cinnamon   Bon appetite.

Excellent and way easier than making individual pancakes one after the other. Especially when you're feeding 3 teenage boys and a husband.  I threw a cookie sheet of sliced Taylor ham in the oven right along side of the pancake and breakfast was ready in one easy step.  Plus clean up was a breeze.  I'll use this recipe for breakfast for dinner, too!

My whole family loves it. Extremely easy to make. I made it as directed except I added a little Vanilla. I'm going have to double it next time tho! Has anyone doubled in in one pan? Not sure if it would cook all the way through if I did.  Thx for a great recipe.

Where have I been not to have tried this before?!?  Easy, quick to mix up and looked too fancy out of the oven.  Based on reviews, I used less (1/4 cup) butter and a tsp of vanilla, but everything else just as listed.  Used food processor as it was handy.   Delicious with just powdered sugar or a bit of syrup.  I really liked the cinnamon/sugar layer that sunk near the bottom and might up that by half next time.  Will definitely make again for guests and grandkids - so much easier/quicker/tastier than traditional pancakes.  Thanks for the easy to follow, delicious recipe.

This was perfectly delicious! I followed recipe exactly. For my husband & myself, it was perfect to eat alone, just the touch of sweetness from cinnamon-sugar & powdered sugar sprinkled on top. My kids wanted syrup. The possibilities seem endless for topping

This was a PERFECT recipe,  once I decreased the butter,  per other reviewers'   suggestions.    Family LOVED it,  and have asked to have it added to weekly  rotation,  dinner or breakfast, they don't care.   Easy to prepare,  great when cooked in a cast iron 9" pie pan.   We will enjoy often.   Thanks for the wonderful recipe,  JHERCIK

This recipe uses all the same ingredients that I would use for french toast, without the flour. Butter would only be used to grease the pan.

This so tasty and easy! I also cut WAY back on the butter, two tablespoons worked well. I also baked it in a cast iron skillet which made it crispy on top and bottom. My husband doesn't normally care for german pancakes but loves this recipe.

This recipe is fabulous. It reminds me a great deal of bread pudding. The first time I put  a little syrup on it then the second I ate it with a little milk over it.  I will make this over again many times.  This is a winner in my book.

Wonderful!  I made as directed, but added some thin sliced apples on top, and then sprinkled with a little more cinnamon and sugar.  It tasted just like a local pancake house's specialty!  A fraction of the cost, and we didn't have to go anywhere.  Delicious and easy.

This is more Flan or Custard than pancake.  Too much egg, not enough flour.  We will not be making this again.

I just made this and it was delicious. Reminded me of a French Cruller donut! I followed the recipe exactly as published and it came out of the oven looking and smelling divine. This is a dead easy recipe. I don't have a food processor and my blender is packed away, so I just used a whisk, then decided my old-fashioned egg-beater would work better. Both worked equally well. So any of you out there without a blender or food processor needn't worry. You can do it the old-fashioned way and get perfect results. Plus, if you use the whisk, it will help firm up your arms and get rid of the bat wings.

Made it for brunch today.  Delicious, wouldnt change a thing except it doesn't need the powdered sugar, drizzled maple syrup instead.  Oh, and I used Irish butter, yummy!

very good recipe but...... I doubled it and next time will only use 1/4 cup of "no Salt" butter. very quick and easy to make 
also I dumped the butter out of the pan after 18 mins and cooked it another 5 mins. Makes a big difference and was not greasy at all. Could be my oven but cooked it at 400.

When I first attempted this recipe in 2010, it was nearly a disaster. Since then, I've revamped the recipe to suit my taste preferences (see custom versions of this recipe). I reserve this recipe for a lazy weekend breakfast and serve with fresh fruit on the side. You can EASILY adjust the butter down to 1-2 tablespoons total and still get a perfect oven pancake. If you love a custard-like consistency, give this recipe a whirl.

I made this exactly as suggested and thought the result was fantastic.  I will say that one must appreciate quiche- or custard- since this is the result of the center portion of this dish, whereas the puffiest sidewalls are more airy and like a pan-cake.  REALLY reminded me of funnel-cake and quiche.  Yum!
