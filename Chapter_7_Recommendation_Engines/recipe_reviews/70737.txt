Very good, filling, great taste, and healthy.  However, I found the length of the cooking times to be absurd and unnecessarily long.  The first cooking time (for the broth), I cut back to 30 min; also, I used all the broth and only added a little extra water.  I cooked the lentils for about 30 minutes, until tender but not mushy, the way I like them, and I did not simmer it a full 15 minutes after adding the remaning ingredients.  I think this would also be very good with spinach or any other green in place of the chard.

I highly recommend, the dark greens are so tasty in this soup unfortunetly the lemon really over powered the flavors, because of this the soup tasted better the next night. I'll make again with half the lemon suggested.

I loved this soup! I was skeptical about the quantity of broth and water called for, but after all of that simmering, you end up with the right amount. I made this vegetarian by using veg broth instead of chicken. I went a littler heavier on the thyme sprigs and used a little less than 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I suggest adding 1/4 cup at first, tasting it and then adding lemon as needed. The soup has a lot of depth when it comes to flavor and the lemon and thyme have your taste buds craving more. I highly recommend this wonderful, hearty soup!

It's so healthy, that is the biggest benefit. The directions were a bog lenthy...Just boil the broth and put in lentils and later on at greens.You could use any green like mustard or kale too. Immidiately I wanted to eat it all but by the next day, I was sick of it!

I didn't realize this required pre-seasoning chicken stock, so instead I created a bouquet garni with the herbs, and used straight chicken stock in lieu of the water.  I loved the lemony flavor and enjoyed the addition of swiss chard.  Like many, I shortened the cooking time for the stock and for the lentils.

I like this!!  I agree with a previous comment about shortening the cooking time.  I would only cook the lentils about 20-25 minutes and simply because I absolutely adore lemon, I think I will add more than 1/2 cup next time. I would also add the TIP to those not familiar with chard, that like spinach, it is important to wash sufficiently to get the dirt off the leaves.  I am sure I will make this again.

The best part of this recipe was adding my own home grown Swiss chard, parsley and lemons!
A nice trick is to blend, (in a blender,)  about 1/4 of the lentil soup part (before adding the chard.) Add blended part back to soup before adding chard. This makes it a bit thicker. To the soup mixture step-while sauteeing the onion and garlic ADD a teaspoon of garlic. YUM!
Great recipe.

Living in Italy it is hard to find all the seasonings this soup required (!) so I replaced the parsley and thyme with sage, and added a sprig of rosemary while simmering the broth.  Everyone I served it to really loved it, but I found the salt from the prepared chicken stock to be overwhelming.  I think it would be good with feta cheese sprinkled on top.

This is a delicious soup! We've grown a huge amount of Chard in our 'Square Foot Garden' and we were really glad to find a recipe that used a lb and a half!  We did use all of the broth and just added about two cups of water.  The lemon flavor was surprisingly good, we'll be serving this again soon. Yummy!

Excellent soup with robust and tangy flavor. I love serving this with stuffed grape leaves and pita bread. Makes for a great meal.

This recipe was tasty.  I didn't follow it exactly, rather used it as a loose guideline.  I'm sure it's delicious as specified, but I used about half the ingredients and came out with quite a bit of flavor.  I didn't have parsley or cilantro, (and I kind of felt like the flavors clashed a little anyway) so I upped the thyme and added some bouillon.  I also subbed kale for swiss chard, because I'm on a kale kick and it's so nutritious and its texture holds up well in soups.  Finally, I used canned lentils- really saved time, definitely just as good.  Being a lemon lover, (particularly with lentils) I didn't think the lemon flavor was too much, especially if you let it sit for a while and let the garlic and onion flavors absorb.

Overall a good soup. I added a lot of extra lemon and ground black pepper. Followed the suggestions of others and only cooked the lentils for  25 minutes. I served it with some warm pita and everyone seemed pretty happy. I will make it again.

This recipe made so much soup! I would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't gotten tired of eating it and ended up throwing some out.

I really liked this, but it made a bigger batch than we anticipated and it was more than my husband and I could eat. We got tired of the leftovers very quickly. But the taste was good, even reheated.

I had this soup at a restaurant near my work on several lunch occasions.  It was sooo good and healthy that I longed to find a recipe similar to what the Lebonese chef created. I have found it right here and have made it several times for guests accompanied by fatttoush salad.  Always a hit.

I was incredibly suspicious of the lentil-lemon combination, but I had lentils to use up and wanted a nice, inexpensive soup to make - and  it turned out amazing. This recipe blew my mind! So much flavor and very satisfying. The only changes I made were using vegetable broth since it was what I had on hand, and dried thyme since I didn't have any fresh. I can't wait to use up the reserve broth from the soup. Served with homemade whole wheat pita - don't tell my husband he just ate (and loved)  a completely vegan meal!

This was very good! I did not use the swiss chard because it looked bad at the store. I held off in putting in the lemon juice until the soup was done and we squeezed in as much as we wanted. I think 1/2 cup would be too much. A nice hearty soup for a cold winter day! I will make again and try it with the swiss chard or spinach.
