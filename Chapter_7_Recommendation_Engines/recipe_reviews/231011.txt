If you make this for lunches, put the dressing in the jar first, then layer other veggies, making sure you put the greens in last, so they don't touch the dressing.  Don't shake until ready to eat.  It will keep a few days in the fridge this way; as long as the greens don't contact the dressing!

This a great and unusual picnic course and I do agree with one reviewer who suggested putting in the dressing first and greens last thus keeping the greens fresh and crisp.

What a great idea!  Get so sick of making and eating boring lunches.  This was anything but!  Full of color , textures, and yes, even flavor!!  Delightful!  Could have played around with it, adding other stuff, but glad I didn't.  Was perfect as is!
A keeper!

Put dressing on bottom.  Keeps veggies from getting too soggy and saturated.

I know you're thinking "What's the big deal? Just put a salad in a jar."  The dressing in this salad is the big deal. I adjusted the ingredients of the salad to accommodate the contents of my fridge (subtract beets - add sprouted lentils, fresh zucchini, and radicchio). Put the dressing in a small container and take it with you. Thank you for the recipe.

I use a tall container that is plastic and a screw top lid for the unbreakable storage. I place the heavier salad items at the bottom and the lighter items on top so it doesn't crush the whole salad. I pack my salad dressing separately in a small spill-proof container.  It is a great thing to make in advance and have ready to go to work for lunch.

If you are making these for later use, the dressing must go in the jar first, topped by hearty vegetables sush as julliene carrots, or sugar snap peas,followed by whatever layers you want,finishing with the greens on top. Otherwise the salad will get soggy.
