We loved this! I marinated the chicken (used breast because most of my family won't eat the dark meat) in white wine for a few hours.  Followed the rest as written.  We had rice pilaf and asparagus for the sides.  This was so good!

This recipe was amazing. After cooking,  I chopped up the chicken and mixed in pasta to make it like a soup or casserole. I can't wait to try it tomorrow when it thickens up. Even my young ones liked it, 6 and 10.

Made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit with my husband.  Me too, as it's easy to prepare and tastes really good. Apart from letting the sauce cook down a few extra minutes, I followed the recipe pretty much as written.

Chicken was very flavorful. The sauce tasted like water. I had to add more heavy cream and a lot more seasoning. Iâ€™m probably not going to make this again.

I used 10% cream and really should have used the 35% as the sauce was a little runny. It was yummy!

This recipe was delicious and super easy.  I served this over pasta, so for a creamier sause, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.

A winner all around. This chicken is fantastic tasting with a simple preparation, using ingredients generally on hand. I made a few subs but nothing that would make a huge difference; I used prosecco for the white wine, red onion, olive oil and half and half. I did thicken up the sauce with an arrowroot slurry near the end of cooking, which I'd do again. Thanks so much for this great recipe, Kim!
