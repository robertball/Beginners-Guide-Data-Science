I have made this at least 5 times in the last month, adding 2 eggs instead of 1 makes it denser, it is delicious, not too sweet, great for anytime.

This bread is very moist, but a little on the bland side.  I'll make this again, but next time I'll add some cinnamon to it, and maybe a bit more brown sugar.  Decent starter bread to add things to.

Also, if you don't have buttermilk on hand to make this with, just adding 1 tbs of lemon juice to a cup of regular milk will give you the same effect.  Just as tasty, only cheaper.  :)

This is a nice bread recipe and a great way to get rid of leftover buttermilk.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and it tasted great!

Easy to make. It tastes good, but a bit greasy and too crumble. I tried again with less oil (1/4 cup Canola oil) and use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, in order to have a healthier version. It comes out good but it needs a little bit more sugar when using whole wheat flour (3/4 cup brown sugar). And make sure to get rid of the lumps in the brown sugar before adding into the buttermilk oat mixture.

I have made this 5 times in the last month, it is that good and easy to make.  I have made changes to the recipe each time and finally perfected it this time around.  I use 2 eggs instead of 1 and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. Add a little more brown sugar. Also add about 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I also add fruit to it, rasins, dried cherries, apples; whatever you think will taste good.

I added cinnamon and baked it in an 8x8 cake pan.  Because it is crumbly it makes a great base for strawberry shortcake.  I have served it several times this way to rave reviews.

This is one of my favorite quick breads! Think cornbread type of taste but made with oatmeal and not sticky like some quick breads can be and you will appreciate this recipe. It is light, tender and wholesome with a hint a sweetness. I use a 1/4 c. of melted coconut oil without compromising the recipe and usually sub out 1/2 c. flour with white whole wheat flour (it's lighter than regular whole wheat flour) and leave out the salt. Delicious with a smear of soft butter and very adaptable to the addition of spices or made as muffins (12 regular sized or 6 jumbo).

Made this recipe to use up some buttermilk. I added raisins, nuts, and spices as suggested by other reviewers but felt the bread still needed something.  Maybe needed to be sweeter? Also, although the bread is moist it's very crumbly and had to be eaten with a fork as there was no way you could pick up a slice. This was an okay recipe and smelled great while baking but I probably won't make it again.

Oh my goodness, these are YUMMY!!!!  The only difference: I used butter instead of oil and I added cranberries and walnuts, plus I made in a 9x13 pan, cut into squares.  My husband and I finished off an entire recipe in 2 days!  Not sweet, but sweet enough for breakfast or snack.  I also added ground flax seed.

This is a great start.  I cut the recipe in half, but used the whole egg, and it was the best quick bread texture I've ever had.  But it is a blank slate, and you have to add other flavors to really make the most of this bread, because it is a little bland as written.

I thought this was okay. It is hard telling by the recipe what it is exactly. It was way too sweet for a savory dish. Yet, its not quite sweet enough to be used for a dessert. Like the previous reviewer I decided to do half white whole wheat and reduced the salt. The salt taste was plenty using half. This does taste more like the oatmeal version of a corn muffin. I think the recipe would have more justice in a muffin shape brushed with a little honey. The loaf is also very flat and soft.  I am rating the recipe based on the potential to be something good and interesting and a change from corn muffins.
**Edit note: I followed the recipe exactly as is this time. I used the AP flour and no wheat and used the full amount of salt. It was totally different. It went from more of a slightly sweet bread to brown sugar and oatmeal muffin and almost cake like taste. I baked them in my Cuisinart chef classic muffin pan and they slipped right out just using a light spray of PAM before filling. I got 12 muffins and they took 35 minutes to bake. TY

I was looking for a quick way to use up some buttermilk and this was fast and easy. I made the following changes: 3/4 c. brown sugar (instead of just the 1/2 c.), 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 c. raisins. My family eats muffins better than bread so I baked them in greased muffin tins (1 1/2 doz) at 350 for 20 minutes and my kids loved them. Moist and tasty, but they do tend to fall apart easily. I will make again adding diced apples along with the raisins.

i made this bread just today;  used 2 eggs, as someone else suggested and replaced wheat flour with 1 1/2 cups oatmeal flour made in a food processor.
i wanted a sandwich bread without wheat. i like this bread and will make it again. however, next time i will cut back on the sugar. this bread was actually the first time i have made bread other than cornbread!

This is amazing bread!!!!!!!!!!! I was out of eggs and substituted 1/4 cup applesauce instead, as well as using partially olive oil in place of the vegetable oil (I didn't have enough). I also added 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. After 55 minutes, the bread seemed a bit mushy, but I took it out & it was perfect. This bread is very moist, and only a little crumbly. Perfect amount of taste and not bland at all!

Made a ginger glaze with powdered sugar for the top after baking and sprinkled with pecans....yummmy! This revision was for a double batch.

This is more like a quick bread / dessert.  It was good, don't get me wrong but the texture was very heavy (which I was expecting due to the oatmeal) and it was slightly sweet.  I would like to try it with less oil next time as it was really dense and crumbly.  Not bad but not my favourite either.  Like some other reviewers did say, it is a good starter recipe.  I think it would make a terrific banana bread but the ingredients would have to be altered to compensate for the moisture in the bananas (not sure how to do that LOL).  The only thing I have to give it 5 stars is the crust it makes.  It is crispy and tasty! Probably due to the high fat content.

I just made this bread for the first time. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg; also used half the amount of oil called for. It is absolutely delicious. I did not have a prolem with it crumbling. Let it sit for ten minutes in the pan before taking it out and cool completely before slicing. Next time I make it I will add raisins.

Usually when I make a recipe for the first time, I follow it to the "T".  After reading the reviews, I decided to add cinnamon, nutmeg, walnuts and some wheat germ. My husband and I loved it!  We didn't feel it needed more sugar.  Also, I didn't have any trouble with it crumbling when it was sliced.  This is a keeper for my left over buttermilk.

This bread is very moist, and tastes a lot like a bran muffin.  I added a handful of raisins, but I think it would've been better with more raisins and some walnuts.  Another easy way to use up leftover buttermilk!

Well, I don't know about anyone else but I was disappointed and have no idea why this cake crumbled up while trying to slice it. I did not over bake it at all. I did add coconut but can't see how that would make it crumble. Did this happen to anyone else. The taste was pretty good but a tad dry.

I found this recipe when looking to use up leftover buttermilk. I think it turned out really well, though I made a few changes. I used applesauce instead of the oil, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. The texture of the finished bread was really nice - a bit chewy from the oats. I didn't find it to be greasy or crumbly at all; maybe the applesauce helped the texture in addition to REALLY cutting down on the fat content. The applesauce also gave the bread just a hint of apple flavor, which really went well with the cinnamon and spices.

Followed all directions on this recipe but bread turned out short and too moist for slicing without breaking apart.  Tastes rather bland, might require something extra?  Sorry, but wouldn't make again.

The aroma of this bread cooking smelled delicious.  I didn't put anything extra in the batter as suggested, because my kids don't care for nuts or raisins.  This bread tasted good plain, but would probably be even better with some walnuts and raisins.

I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Yummy!! I love the rich flavor of the brown sugar, too. Maybe my oven runs hot, but I also needed to reduce the temp to 325 and the baking time to 40 min.

This is a tasty, moist bread.  I added one teaspoon of cinnamin and chopped pecans.  As mentioned by the person who submitted the recipe, raisins, and spices add to the flavor.  I'm sending this recipe to my friends.

Moist and delicious, as a little loaf or mini cup cakes. I used whole wheat pastry flour, flax and chia seeds for a chewy and crisp texture. Instead of vegetable oil, a mixture of safflower, and coconut oil was the replacement. Plain yogurt was substituted for buttermilk. Just the right sweet for morning bite with coffee!! I will make this many more times!

I've made this recipe three times, and it is delicious. For richness I substitute sour cream for the oil.  I use honey rather than brown sugar, and I top with chopped walnuts that I press into the top.

Nice, simple recipe for a quick bread.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and did 2 eggs, as suggested by a few reviewers.  It is a crumbly "bread", and was well suited for the pie pan I baked it in (another reviewer's idea).  Will make it again.

I doubled it; added some flax seed, subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour; added pecans, dried cranberries, and a handful of butterscotch chips. I used some applesauce to  lower the amount of oil. also added 2 tsp of cinnamon (remember, that's for a double recipe), a sprinkle of ground cloves, nutmeg, and orange peel. My family LOVED it, and I've made pretty great quick breads before; this one is definitely a keeper!

I made this 3 times already! First time it lasted 3 hours. Second time I used applesauce in place of the egg. I added pumpkin pie spice all 3 times. Next time I make It I will use baking olive oil. I will also add dates and walnuts. Always tweaking baked goods to make them healthier. This would make a nice gift to anyone on any occassion

Fantastic.  Disappears as soon as I take it out of the oven.

This recipe had an overall good flavor. It was a bit crumbley. I made the recipe without any nuts or raisins as it was an accompaniment to pork stew. I will make again but perhaps add the nuts and such to make a breakfast bread. If you want something denser, then this probably isn't for you. This was super easy to make. Thanx for the recipe!

I added cinnamon and raisins as suggested by other reviewers.  It had a nice, mild flavor, but I prefer a slightly sweeter bread.  Also- it seemed to fall apart after cutting it even though I allowed it to cool completly.  There are many better bread reipes I've tried in the past.

Like most quick breads eat it quickly after it comes out of the oven for best flavor.

This was not the best quick bread I've ever made.
