This is not your average cream cheese spread; this is something special indeed! I used slightly less then 1/4 cup of each herb and an extra garlic clove, and it was perfect.  I tasted it before adding the lemon juice and I have to say that the lemon really brightened the flavor.  I used kalamata olives and was glad that I didnâ€™t use canned black olives. This spread will become one of our staples when we have an all appetizer gathering.  Finding this recipe felt a little like winning the lottery!  Thanks!

OMG! I made this for my boyfriends Art Gallery reception and people were begging me for this recipe! Very tasty...The only thing I changed was I used lite Cream cheese and I rosted some garlic cloves threw those in rather then minced garlic.
Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I doubled this recipe for a New Year's party. Using 4 Tbsp. of lemon juice was a big mistake! Too lemon-y. Ugh. But okay on a Wheat Thin. I can't comment on the original recipe, but I will NOT be using that much juice again (only 1 Tbsp. for the normal serving size). Other than that, everyone seemed to enjoy the cheese ball. I would make this again. I also think it's easy to adjust by adding some different herbs. Overall, it's a keeper.

This is really good-let this sit in the fridge a while before serving so the flavors can blend properly.

I served this to my family and guests during the holidays---EVERYONE loved it!  I was concerned about the herbs being too "serious," but it was perfect, and I'll make it again.

I thought that this was really good. I served it on some sliced baguette toasts brushed with a little olive oil. I love garlic and I never care how much garlic something has but I served this at a get together and some people weren't crazy about how strong the garlic came through (so if you are serving it at something...I would suggest only 1 clove of garlic.)

I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong with this when the softened cream cheese was so difficult to combine with the other ingredients.  So, I added a little milk and beat it with an electric mixer.  That was a bad idea. As it sits in the fridge it somehow comes together and softens.  Our friends loved the flavor, but I thought it was too runny, so next time I'll stick to the original recipe.  I think I might try whipped cream creese too.

Excellent recipe - I made it for our company christmas party and could have quadrupled the recipe instead of just doubling it. Even my boss' wife asked for the recipe! I used Gulden's mustard for the "prepared mustard" and it tasted great.

Gone in a flash! Took this to a party last night and it was devoured quickly with everyone asking me for the recipe. Will definitely make this again. (I did reduce the amount of herbs by half and it all still worked very well - just made it by eye and by taste) Lovely!

I love this recipe. Had lots of herbs leftover from other dishes so I tried it out. The garlic, wooster and mustard add tremendous flavor! I can't wait to make it again!

Serious dill would be more like it. This recipe was good but I think it will be on my reserve for summer list. It was cool and fresh.

Good recipe but a little too lemony.  I will start with 1T next time and add a little more if necessary.  I used dry herbs, so a little over 1T of each.  I left out the olives as well, and it was good.

Four stars because it is so simple and can be elegant or football food the next day. I followed the recipe except I used dried dill weed and herbed kalamata olives. I also garnished with olives and parsley. I think the mustard goes a long way...in a good way. It would be interesting to add some spice like crushed red peppers or cayenne for an extra surprise.

This dip is so fresh and herbtastic! Everyone at the party loved this dip, I only changed the green onions to chives, and used no mustard, and was delicious! I wanted to take a pic, but it was gone before I had the chance. I served with sesame breadsticks. Delicious!

This was a hit! A great way to use up some dill, with a lot of ingredients that might already be in your fridge! Yum.

Very strong flavor, which for me was excellent but might be too much for others.  Most people at our party really liked this, definitely more women than men though.  I thought it was delicious.

For the reviewer who couldn't mold it, I usually put plastic wrap on the inside of my mold, then line the inside of the mold with cheesecloth and then just pack it in with a spatula to the top and fold the plastic wrap over the top and refrigerate. Once it is refrigerated for a few hours,the cream cheese should harden and mold. Try it.

A wonderful recipe for an appetizer with all kinds of crackers. Mix in your food processor for ease in preparation. OK to use dried herbs, but use far less of them. They are stronger in taste than fresh. I use fresh green olives, rather than canned olives.

Very good.  Like anything else, it's better the more it sits.  Also, take the chill off of it before you serve.

I traded the fresh herbs for 1/8 cup dried except for the dill & I only used about 2 tbsp of that, since it is pretty strong.  This stuff is awesome on triscuits!

This is our first year making this recipe and we really enjoy it! We did make some alterations as we thought some of the herb amounts were a bit too much. We used bagel chips to scoop it up.

Just made a double batch of this for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I followed someone else's review and didn't double the lemon juice. It came out wonderfully with a really great flavor! I did use kalamata olives and all fresh herbs. Can't wait for my family to try it!

This was delicious! I took it to a party and I it was gone in a flash. I thought a friend  was going to pick up the dish and lick it! I had to give out the recipe to more than one person. I used fresh parsley but dried basil and dill and it still came out fantastic. This was the hit of the party.

This stuff is scary looking if you don't know what it is.  I made this and Hubby asked me, "What's that green (explicit) in the bowl in the fridge?"  I left out the black olives, 'cuz I hate them. Not only does it taste  good on crackers but on carrot and celery sticks too.

This spread is DELICIOUS!!!  I made this for a church gathering and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  This spread is extremely easy to make and is just so refreshing with all the fresh herbs and lemon juice.  I will definitely keep this one on hand for many future uses.

Fabulous.  I leave out the olives and dill.  Almost everyone loves this.  The only ones that I came across that don't care for this is those that prefer the package mixes.  Great recipe.
