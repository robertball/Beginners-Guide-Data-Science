This was so yummy!  I used potato and onion peirogies and an additional cup of sauerkraut, just because we like it so much.  It is a great variation on my standard pierogie dinner.

This was very good. Very flavorful! Made exactly to recipe. Will make again when we get the craving for sauerkraut and corned beef. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

We thought this was pretty good.  The flavors mixed well, but I wish there would've been more pierogie for the amount of stuff that was on top.  For the rye crumbs, I toasted and crumbled pieces of rye bread - I ended up using at least a cup to cover the top and add a little crunch.  It definitely takes the whole 40 minutes!

for a 9x13 glass baking dish, I ended up adding more to the recipe (so it made 8 servings).  I doubled the amount of butter and sauerkraut.  I ended up using 3 quarter pound deli sliced corned beef.  Used 8 slices of Sargento's swiss cheese.   An entire bottle of Wishbone's light thousand island dressing and mixed it with 1/3 cup of French's spicy brown mustard.  Couldn't find rye bread crums, so I baked 5 slices of rye bread separately at 350 degrees for 15 minutes to make it hardened.  Broke up the bread and put it on after the mixture boiled for 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!

It was good. In addition to thousand island dressing I also added spicy brown mustard. Next time I will add more dressing/mustard and some garlic and onion powder. It seemed a little bland to me

Really great for a quick and easy meal.  I made mine in a 7X11 casserole dish which worked perfectly.  I also used regular bread crumb instead of rye.  Very good!

Just made this today and it's very good!  I used potato and cheddar pierogies because that's all the store had.  It did take a good 40 minutes to cook, but well worth the wait!

This was really good. Tasted just like a reuben sandwich. Even my daughter enjoyed it. I didn't have rye crumbs so I just used regular ones

I made some mistakes & adjustments, so not quite ready to review properly yet - giving a neutral so as to not skew the numbers. Wanted to log in now with a warning: single layer of perogies ONLY. Any that get "doubled up" become raw slimy pieces of dough.
Willing to try this again properly and re-review.

We loved it as first and leftovers. Improvements for the next time. I would double if not triple the meat. As another recommended make sure the pierogies are in a single layer. I would also use the mini ones. They won't change the taste any but may make it a bit easier for kids to eat

Was very unimpressed way to much topping for the amount of perogies.  The swiss, sauerkraut, dressing and corner beef make a salty gross tangy mess. Maybe there's a good recipe  in there somewhere but for me its not worth trying to figure it out

This was really good! I followed the recipe except I used regular breadcrumbs. I've tried at least 2 other Reuben casserole type of recipes and didn't care for any of them. Glad I gave this one a chance.

Made this as suggested other than doing amounts "to taste".  Maybe I have a slow oven, but it needed more cooking time. The bread crumbs didn't quite work with it, but maybe because they weren't cooked enough. Other than that, I thought it was a nice way to disguise frozen perogies i

We love Pierogies and we love Reuben casserole and have both in our frequent rotation of dinners, but combining the two was not as great as I'd hoped for.  Of the six in my family, only my husband really loved this and said it was better than our typical Reuben casserole.  The rest of us like our usual Reuben casserole better.
