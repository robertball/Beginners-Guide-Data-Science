I thought this chili was amazing! It's very simplistic and basic which makes it easy to add ingredients to your liking. I added 2 cubes of beef bouillon a whole onion in place of the flakes 2 chopped carrots 1 T of yellow mustard and 1 can each of kidney and black beans.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I think the recipe name is a bit misleading though; I don't think there is any more garlic in this than in any other chili I've made (maybe even less in fact). Having said that this chili has great flavor. I followed the recipe but also added a can of sliced mushrooms and some water (with a cube of bouillon) as we like our chili with a bit more liquid. Served it topped with shredded cheddar and pickled jalapenos. Thank you:)

Down & Dirty Garlic Chili Haiku: "Needs more of something. The title is misleading. Maybe more beans too?" I agree w/ another reviewer that despite the recipe's cute title it doesn't call for any more garlic than any other chili recipe that I've made. I also didn't find it to be spicy at all and I even used fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes. The only thing that I changed was swapping onion flakes for diced onion that I sauteed w/ the beef. It's a nice basic chili that in my opinion needs a better ratio of beef to beans more garlic (to suit its title) and more heat.

This got good reviews at our house and is a good thing to whip up when you're short on prep time. But it's basically just a regular chili -- all the garlic gets overwhelmed by the chili powder. And if you want to control the heat worry about the red pepper flakes AND the chili powder; two tablespoons gives it quite a kick and was too spicy for some of my family.

Very easy and delicious! However the name is very misleading. I upped the garlic to 4 gloves and still couldn't taste it. All in all it was a good recipe that will be added to our rotation.

I rate this one 4 because I had to make a few changes but overall this was a good and quick chili recipe! I ended up chopping up a small onion and adding for a little more flavor. I also filled the diced tomato can 1/2 way with water and added otherwise it was WAY too think. I added some pickled jalapeno's for a little more heat and a tsp of mustard (it gives chili AMAZING flavor). I will definitely use the recipe as a base recipe from now on though so thanks!!

This is a good basic Chili recipe to add your own flair too. I read a few reviews that said this was really spicy but we didn't think it was spicy at all! I ended up adding hot sauce and pickled jalapenos to give it some kick. I'll probably use this again but will definitely doctor it up a little bit more.

I used left over roast beef rather then ground beef. I used stewed tomatos. I used "Bushes" chili beans. I increased all the spices slightly. Didn't salt and pepper at all. Pretty pleased with the results. I froze it to use for a gathering in the near future hope everyone else likes it too!!

This is a great chili recipe! It's been a staple in our house for at least every other week for a couple of years now. Thank you!
