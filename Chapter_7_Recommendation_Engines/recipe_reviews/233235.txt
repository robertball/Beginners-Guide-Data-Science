I added mushrooms and would try olives. I replaced the Italian seasoning with summer savory and parsley. My mistake: to avoid a soggy crust, I pre-baked it until it had a drier surface, as I usually do with quiche crust, but this crescent crust came out dry and overcooked from the par-baking. And bready. I looked forward to the crescent pastry, but ended up preferring regular crust, because of the breadlike texture. However, I've liked puff pastry with such dishes, so maybe the overlooking was the problem. I look forward to being creative with the crescent pastry!

Delicious! I didn't measure my ingredients but it all worked out. I did use all ingredients listed.  I will make this again and likely change up the veggies.
Thanks for sharing.
