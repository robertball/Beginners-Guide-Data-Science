These were WONDERFUL and so easy to make.  I did not add the salt because there is plenty in the Cheddar cheese.  I rolled them out to about 1/2" and used a biscuit cutter and was able to get 9 biscuits.  For a change of pace, I will substitute the green bell pepper with a can of chopped green chilies, just for a spicier biscuit, but they are perfect the way they are!  Thanks for agreat recipe, Nell!

Pretty good. I had to add an extra tablespoon of milk, elevation propbably. Omitted peppers and pimnto, although I do think it would be good. Added 1 tsp garlic. Nice and light. Next time I am going to roast a head of garlic and add that with a few minced pickled Japeleno's. Yum, thanks for the recipe!

Of course I had to leave out the green peppers and pimentos,kids won't eat the biscuits with that in there.I added extra cheese and I think crumbled bacon would be tasty in there.We made the potatoe soup V with the biscuits and everything was delicious.I give these biscuits a thumbs up.

Worked great for a non-bread baker (= I added 1 clove minced garlic and some finely chopped shallot (instead of the bell pepper and pimento.), 3/4 c grated parm, and used 3/4 c  of a cheddar jack mix. I used a fork to cut in my butter flavored Crisco. I just wish I had some butter on hand - I want melty butter on my warm biscuit (=

Very tasty biscuits and couldn't be simpler to make! I used diced peppers that I had frozen during the growing season (a combination of green and red). These biscuits went well with two venison meals I prepared. Thanks for a keeper!

Really good!  10 stars because they don't use Bisquik which I never have and is always called for in biscuit recipes.  Would actually give them 4.5 . . . I didn't add the peppers because of the kids but I think they would add a lot of flavor as they are a tad bland without.  That's ok though, they were meant as an accompaniment and were perfect for that.  I used butter instead of shortening (personal preference).  They were fast, tasty, easy and very much enjoyed!  I will definitely keep this recipe-it's a great recipe as is, but I can imagine adding herbs or different cheeses, etc.  Thanks so much!  I've been looking for a quick savory bread recipe for ages and this was really great!

Made these with my 3 year old son tonight to go with a beef stew.  They turned out great, even with the uneven thickness we got when he rolled out his own batch.  We omitted the green pepper and pimento because we didn't have any, and not quite sure how much cheese ended up in the batter.

I've made this recipe about 3 times in the past month, and it's great! Goes wonderfully with stews and soups. And they are great leftover with raspberry jam!
The changes I made were to leave out the peppers and pimento, and I increased the cheddar a little. Other then that, left everything the same. Thanks for this great recipe! :)

These biscuits have a really light airy texture. They were pretty good, but I didn't like the pepper flavor. Neither did my son, so if you don't care much for the pimento and pepper flavor leave them out as I will next time. These were simple to make and very quick too. If you are expecting these to be like the cheddar bay biscuits, they aren't. They are really good though, and I loved the lightness. These were a great side with a bowl of soup. Thank you Nell for posting this.

These turned out pretty well. They puffed up nicely, but could use a little more flavor. I added bacon, but maybe a touch more salt. Overall they were very good!

I really loved this recipe.  I added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1 tsp each of basil & parsley.  I would cut back on the flour tho'. 1-3/4 cups would be plenty.  I also saut√©ed 1 small onion and 3 cloves of garlic and added that in as the last ingredient.  It rolled well and 10 minutes was plenty for baking! I didn't add pimento or pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  These are genuine homemade biscuits!

a great from-scratch starter recipe, thanks! all the other cheddar biscuit recipes use biscuit mix...eww! I omitted the peppers and pimentos as well for the sake of family, added a tablespoon of garlic, used margarine instead of shortning because I think that makes all biscuits better, added more cheese and increased the milk to a whole cup so that I wouldnt have to roll them out...just drop them on the tray. Turned out fantastic! A little sweet, so I may decrease the sugar to only 1 tbs next time, though.

These popped out of the pan nicely; even out of heart shaped muffin tins but, the flavor was dull.  The texture was good but they tasted like Bisquick. Not particularly better with butter or gravy. Very surprising, actually, since they looked so good. I followed the recipe and am an avid cook. Alas, I will need to find a better recipe.

Made these with chives (instead of pimentos and green bells) and shredded cheddar, with a few red pepper flakes on top for the adults. They were light and fluffy and tasty. I think I might increase the white sugar a tad next time.

These are simple to make, and delicious. I made them to go along with some barbecued ribs I was making for a cookout, and everyone loved them. Even my mom, who doesn't eat biscuits much, had two because she liked them so much.

Didn't add the pimentos but they were great without them. The green bell pepper was a nice addition.
