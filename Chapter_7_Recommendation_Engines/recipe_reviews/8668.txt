I'm giving this recipe only four stars as written, after working with the recipe I made the following changes and believe it's a five star: don't batter the chicken, just flour (added salt, pepper, and paprika to flour), use real butter and olive oil to saute chicken, double or triple the sauce using good white wine, and add several tablespoons of capers to finish.  I served with parmesean/parsley mashed potatos on a large platter with lemon slices, beautiful presentation.  This dish is definitely for lemon lovers, and the flavors are mild and mellow, so you can finish the meal off with a big bang of a dessert!

We really love this recipe.  I always triple the white wine and lemon juice for the sauce in the end, but let it cook down until it is not so runny.  I also put two cloves of crushed garlic in with the oil and butter, and let that saute before adding the chicken.  And definetly use olive oil!  Awesome taste.

OMG This was sooooo good - finally i was able to fry and have the breading stay on - i pounded the chicken real thin, dipped it in the flour, than the egg, than the bread crumbs and fried it in butter and olive oil, and the crust stayed on !!!!! i was so excited!!!! i made the sauce with chicken broth because i didnt have wine and added capers too. Served it over angel hair pasta, and had fresh broccoli and green salad on the side. Hubby and his friend inhaled it, and the kids loved it too!!! definitely a keeper, will be making this again -- thanks so much for posting this recipe -

This recipe is great!  When I haeted the butter in the skillet I added 2 pressed cloves of garlic to it.  And I also added about a 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the lemon juice and wine, then reduced down with the drippings in the skillet.  What's piccata w/out fresh garlic?  So much better this way, I think.

I made this dish for dinner last night and scaled the recipe to 2 servings.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the amount of sauce (good thing too!).  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added two cloves of minced garlic to the pan when cooking the chicken.  I don't know what I was thinking...but don't do this!  The garlic cooks too long and as a result, turns bitter.  If you want to add garlic, do so after removing the chicken; saute it a little before adding the sauce ingredients to the pan.  Another point to mention is that I don't feel there is enough bread crumb mixture to coat the chicken breasts...much more is needed to get a good coating on the breasts.  Anyhow, in the end, this dish was "ok", but we probably won't be making it again, in our opinion, it didn't have any wow factor.

Agree with other comments regarding using olive oil, more lemon & white wine.

We also made this using pork tenderloin instead of chicken. Cut the tenderloin into 1" pieces and pound them until they're as thin as veal scallopine. Continue as if using chicken, only the thin pork will only take about 2 minutes per side to brown & cook. Then continue with the rest of the recipe.

We found the sauce to be very tart and added some chicken broth to smooth it out.  This also made more sauce to drizzle over the chicken and the rice we serve with it.

I'd never had chicken piccata before, let alone made it!  This was a FABULOUS dish!  I made it for a friend who thought the sauce was a little too strong, so I calmed it down with some chicken broth.  I like to make my sauce with some freshly sliced mushrooms.

The chicken turned out great on its own but it is just a basic breading technique.  The lemon juice and white wine was too lemony and simple with no depth.  I tried adding capers like others suggested but did not care for the taste of them.  Maybe if fresh garlic was added to the sauce like others suggested it would taste better.  Definitely need to triple the sauce or more b/c not even close to making enough the way it is written.

I would have only given this recipe a 3 as-is, but think it deserves a 4 based on one easy addition that increases the flavor immensely. I followed every step to the letter, but meant to add garlic at the end to the sauce like other reviewers suggested. Without this (or something similarly flavorful), there just isn't enough flavor/spice to be really satisfied.

The directions for breading the chicken and frying is pretty basic and delicious (although not quite enough). But the "sauce" was  almost non-existent. I decided to "triple" like other reviewers. I added some chicken stock (to make up for the extra lemon and wine) and the "sauce" was too "tangy".  So I added some chicken boullion granules. Still not much flavor other than lemon juice "tang", and now salt. I used a Chardonnay, so maybe the wine was too sweet (or not sweet enough)? IDK. But this "sauce" just tasted like straight-up lemon juice to us.? I think it needs butter.

Huge hit with the boyfriend!  Added flour and juice from 1 lemon to the sauce at the end to thicken it.  Sliced the lemon I just squeezed and mixed the slices, fresh flat leafed parsley, sauce and chicken together before serving.  Amazing flavor!

I made this for company, but instead I added fresh garlic, and added capers at the end.  It came out very yummy.  I will double the sauce to have over asparagus.

Very good...quick & easy!
One thing I forgot to do was flatten the chicken, so it took a little longer to cook.  Next time, I'll be sure to flatten it for a quicker cooking time.  Overall, very good and I would definitely make this recipe again!

This was a great base recipe.  I didn't use the butter/veg. oil combo, I just used Olive oil and browned some crushed garlic in it before browining the chicken.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added one cup of chicken broth to the drippings, wine and lemon juice.  I then put the browned chicken back in the pan, covered it and let is steam for about 8 minutes.  I think next time, I may add some grated cheese to the bread crumb mixture.  (Romano cheese would be my choice!)  Very tasty chicken dish!

I like this recipe but I had to adjust some amounts.  I needed 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and more of the lemon juice/wine mixture.  Tasty though.

This was very tasty - I added a little butter with the wine and lemon juice to make more liquid. Maybe will try to add broth also next time. I almost fell out of my seat when all three of my children gobbled it all up - one even had seconds!!! Will definitely make again.

Mediocre. Basically, just a lemon kick to plain 'ole breaded chicken breasts. I made this recipe to use up some odds and ends before going food shopping. I basically think this would be the only situation in which I would make it again. It was good, but not worthy of making twice.

I sliced the chicken breast to make more, and took the advice to add some orange juice to cut the bitterness.  It was perfect, much easier than I thought!  Works great served atop angel hair pasta and whole green beans as a side.

I would give this recipe 4 stars as written and 5 stars with some minor changes.  I added capers to the sauce for starters.  Also, instead of cooking it in the pan I browned it in butter and oil and then finished them in a 400 degree oven to cook through.  Well loved by myself and company!

I thought this was great...rather than adding parsley I just added capers to the sauce in the end. I also added just a little extra white wine.

This is my go-to chicken recipe, we love it!  I do triple the sauce and add some capers at the finish.  Thanks for your recipe!

This was an excellent Piccata recipe.  However, I did slightly modify the sauce.  Two tablespoons each of the wine and lemon juice was inadequate, in my opinion.  I instead added about a 1/2 a cup of each (slightly more wine than lemon juice) instead of the two tablespoons.  I also added a tablespoon of cornstarch so that the juice thickened up a bit.  It was outstanding.  A great recipe that you will want to try.

I agree with the others... a little bland.  Why only 2 tbs of wine and lemon - it should be more like a cup full of sauce to pour over the chicken.  My daughter kept complaining that it needed sauce, as I served this over linquine.  I agree with others that the bread crumbs should be deleted, as this made the chicken at little crunchy.  I have never had this in a restaurant, so I cannot compare.  I made this primarily for my husband and he liked it.  I shall try again, but I will triple the sauce and just use flour and seasonings to bread the chicken next time.

Pretty good!  It did need some tweaking (extra wine & lemon, add chicken broth to sauce) and will probably tweak some more for next time, but for a throw-together dinner it was great! I had everything in the recipe already so it came together very easily!

This is a restaurant quality recipe. I followed the recipe to a T. It was delicious. Who ever rated this below 5 stars must have not followed the directions. Thanks alot. I added this to my recipe box and I will be using it often.

Definitely double or triple the sauce at the end (lemon juice and wine) -- it really cooks down quickly. Like other reviewers: Also added paprika to bread crumb mixture, minced garlic to chicken while cooking and capers to sauce after removing chicken. Followed the directions from the recipe: coated chicken with flour and stored in fridge for an hour before cooking, then dipped in egg and then the bread mixture. Turned out great.

Hello, lemon!  Wow, you guys weren't kidding about that : )  I followed advice in some of the reviews, and tripled both the lemon juice and the white wine in the sauce, plus I added a touch of flour to help it thicken up.  To layer the flavors in the breading, I put the salt, pepper, and garlic powder in the flour, added a bit of lemon juice to the egg wash, and added some dried parsley to the bread crumbs.  The only thing I would do differently would be to reduce the ratio of lemon juice to wine in the sauce and maybe add some chicken broth and/or a touch of sugar.  I love lemon, but this made me pucker up a little too much.  Otherwise, yum!

Fantastic- made this for a dinner party. I made it and knew it just did not appear to be Picata without the capers.- had none so I added some Lesure peas as substitution. Added parmigiana   to bread crumb coating mixture. Served with angel hair noodles, seasoned with Cavinder's Greek seasoning and tad of butter. We ate leftovers with sprinkled feta on it- awesome.
** Wine and lemon additions should at least be doubled.

This COULD be a 5 star if you add about 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream to the sauce and DO NOT add PARSLEY.  Chicken piccata does NOT have parsley in it but it does have capers.

Well, I would give it 5 stars for easy to make. However, when hubby took first bite, he gave made a face, i asked what was wrong, and he said "it tastes weird". I tried it, I didnt think it tasted weird, it was ok, but thats about it. Probably won't make again. Oh, and I followed recipe to a T except I doubled the lemon juice and white wine as others had suggested.

I really enjoyed the recipe and so did the other 5 people that ate it! Even my young kids asked for more! I gave it a 4 star because I didn't use the flour...didn't think it was necessary. I DID triple the sauce amount & capers would go perfect with it. Wonderful recipe & I can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was OK---a little bland and a little oily for me. I think I might skip the bread crumbs next time. I think the lemon was very important in cutting the fattiness of the dish. I also did add capers. It was very quick and easy to make, so with a few adustments I think it could work---my 15 month old toddler loved it!

This was GREAT! And simple! I substituted OLIVE oil (for the vegetable oil).  Also, I found Purdue thin sliced chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound regular breasts.

This is my husbands very favorite recipe!  It really is delicious and though the sauce is a bit tangy for my kids I just keep a couple pieces of chicken out before I pour the sauce on.  I also double the sauce to have extra.  Of course, if you don't like lemon this may not be the recipe for you.

This was good. It was a little greasy for me, and I doubled the chicken broth etc. for more sauce but still wasn't enough. Next time will make with less oil/butter and make more sauce.

We really liked this recipe.  The original recipe needed some modifications, so we added about a cup of chicken broth and doubled the wine and lemon juice for extra sauce for pasta.  We also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The sauce was excellent with pasta, but next time we will add some extra lemon juice.

Excellent and easy.  Never made chicken piccata, but this was delicious.  The breading technique is great.  Only change I made was to saute some mushrooms in the drippings, and then added probably twice as much lemon juice, wine and about 1 cup of chicken broth so I would have plenty of sauce.  I will add this to my favorites.

Delicious! I made it using butter and olive oil and only breaded one side and it was perfect. Definitely triple the sauce and add a couple cloves of minced garlic after removing the chicken. I also added a small handful of capers to the sauce. Everybody loved it

I did change this a bit. I am on a diet so,I used 2tsp.ovoo and 2tsp.butter total. I also used chicken broth, not wine and I added 1tsp. lemon zest to the pan with the lemon juice. Delish.

This recipe was quick, easy and absolutely delicious! It is also one that you would tend to have the ingredients in the pantry. I made the recipe as is, but did serve over angel hair pasta. My kids loved it also. I will make it again!

Great basic recipe! My favorite crumbs to bread the chicken with are Toasted crackers cut with a little flour. I also add extra garlic powder. Definitely needs more sauce. I approximately quadruple it, add a quarter cup chicken broth, then let it reduce. Also I find that 2 parts wine to 1 part lemon juice plus a little broth made the sauce less bitter. I also add capers, chopped marinated artichoke hearts, and diced fresh tomatoes. Next time I'm going to chop a little fresh spinach and throw that in the sauce too for more color and a little extra vitamin umph!

It is definitely a good idea to make extra sauce (triple usually works), but other than that this recipe is quite good as is.

Very good.  Even the hubby, who "hates" chicken, said it was a tasty change.  The only thing I did differently was use white wine with lemon flavor, it being the only white wine I had on hand.  Will definitely use this recipe again, but will double the lemon juice and wine because it was so yummy!  Thank you for sharing, Allison.

This dish was ok, but the lemon was too strong for me.  I couldn't taste any of the other flavors.  Plus, I kept thinking this would be SO much better with fish than chicken.  Just ok, probably won't make it again...at least with chicken.

Delicious. I added four sliced cloves of garlic to the oil/butter mixture and it added a nice spice to the recipe. Only complaint is that there wasn't much sauce to pour over the chicken so double the lemon and wine. Great dinner with angel hair pasta and fresh broccoli.

The first time I made this I followed the directions and made the sauce like it was printed.  We did not care for it.  The second time I decided to take other reviewers advice but we did not like the sauce that way either.  We did like the meat with the breading but the sauce was just not for us.  Thanks anyway

This was great and I had everything I needed at home!  The breading was perfect.  Following the advise of other reviewers, I doubled the lemon/wine and added a cup of chicken broth to make extra sauce.  This will be a regular meal at our house.

Everyone loved it and it was so easy to prepare ahead so I just had to cook the chicken at the party.  I used more wine and lemon juice than the recipe called for.

The chicken was excellent - tender and tasty.  I'm going to use this breading method with many recipes.  The sauce did not come out well - I'll use one of the other reviewers suggestions next time.

This was very tasty. I like lemon so I added some lemon zest to the sauce. I didn't get any dripping from sauting the breasts so along with the lemon juice and wine I added some evaporated skim milk to make a creamier sauce. This is terrfic and fast once I got past butterflying the chicken breasts.

very good recipe.  when I'm lazy or in a hurry I substitute chicken tenders and simply toss them with Italian seasoned bread crumbs in a plastic bag to coat.  but I never skimp on the parsley or the white wine!  I'm going to try capers with sauce, and fresh garlic next.

This recipe only gets 3 cards from me, as it is, because this recipe was bitter when I made it. After I replaced orange juice for lemon juice it was great and worthy of 5 cards! Also I only use 2 breast halves, cut into strips, instead of 6 breast halves and I double the amount of juice & wine that I let reduce slightly in the pan before I pour it over the chicken & 1/2 lb. cooked & drained linguine tossed with 2T. olive oil, 1T. lemon juice, 1/4tsp. pepper & 1/8 tsp garlic powder.

Although just a little time consuming, I was very pleased with the result.  I have never made chicken piccata before and this was great.  My husband nad my kids loved it.  This is a great dish to make for guests, very easy to garnish and serves beautifully.

This recipe is awesome! My picky 4 year old LOVES it and eats more than I do when I make it. It's easy and also very versatile. I add my own ingredients to it (artichike hearts, cajun seasoning to the bread crumbs) and it always turns out perfect.

I love this. It's my go-to recipe when I want something easy and delicious.  As an empty-nester I can make this in a small portion size.  I make pasta ( thin spaghetti or  angel hair) mixed with a little butter olive oil , Parmesan and garlic and serve  with the chicken. Delicio!

I made it exactly like the recipe. It was tender, moist, and delicious.  Although I loved it fried, the next time I will bake it in the oven and make a sauce separately.

Worked pretty well!!  I added capers (of course) and fresh chopped garlic (rather than the garlic powder).

I made this recipe for my family.  My son said this recipe is much better than the local Italian restaurant we frequent.  I did add capers to the wine sauce because I love them.  Purchased my chicken breasts already flattened which made the recipe even easier.  Will become a recipe requested every month I am sure.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe for family or guests.  However, I did make some alterations.  Intending to serve four, I started with 1 1/2 lbs. of Costco chicken breasts.  I doubled the sauce, making it in a small sauce pan first, adding one large crushed garlic clove fried up in a bit of butter.  I also thickened it with 2 t. corn starch dissolved in a splash of chicken broth.  I then added 2 T. capers, a dash of salt, and 2 t. honey (as it was very tart.)  After cooking, I set it aside to meld.

I doused the egg-covered breasts in the flour and spice mix, but held aside the cracker crumbs.  The floured breasts I recoated with egg and then pressed the crackers into the chicken breasts on both sides.  I fried them in a large heavy fry pan (more olive oil and butter than recipe calls for) on med. high. until golden and crispy. Remove the breasts to a warm plate. Drain the grease from the pan, reserving chicken bits, add the sauce to the pan and reheat for serving.  Mmm, good!

I made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful.  I used wafer thin pork chops instead of chicken which didn't make any difference in the flavor of the meal.  I did need at least double the amount of egg, flour and breadcrumb mixture.  The flavor was fantastic and my family ate it up!

The recipe was a great base.  I used Panko bread crumbs for a great flaky crust.  The sauce needed heavy cream to make less "tart" and thicker.

This dish is so tasty... I also took the advice from one of the reviews to add mushrooms and capers to the sauce and it came out PERFECT! Highly recommend this dish!! I served it with garlic roasted mashed potatoes too. ALSO, I incorporate this recipe with Chicken Parm, just lose the sauce part of the recipe and add your favorite marinara sauce, serve over angel hair. MMMMM

I agree with the last reviewer that the flavors are "mild and mellow". It's got good flavor, don't get me wrong...you need that sauce too. Add extra wine to the sauce and let it boil and reduce down. It was good, not over the top fantastic, but it's a good, easy keeper recipe that was done in a hurry.

I thought this recipe worked out very well and the chicken was very tasty adn cooked fast.  The only addition I would do is to add capers, mushrooms, and add a thicker sauce.

This was delicious. I will say, however, that I tripled the sauce and it still was not enough. Added capers, and they really made the dish special. Also, I ended up doubling the egg/water, flour and breading mix. There's just wasn't enough to cover the four chicken breasts. The breading stayed on GREAT!  I will definitely make this again. It tasted awesome.

It was a great recipe my family loved it. Just make sure that you follow the cooking directions when it says to cook over medium heat. The bread crumbs cook really fast (I learned that the hard way , I'm not all that patient some times). Also I'd get chicken breasts that aren't too thick, they take longer to cook.
