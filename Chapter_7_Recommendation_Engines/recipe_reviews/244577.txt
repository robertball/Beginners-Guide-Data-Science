Loved this quick, easy, and wonderfully tasty soup! I used a low sodium broth, so added in a little of the chicken flavored ramen packet for a little bit of extra flavor. The ginger and soy sauce were wonderful additions. My almost 2 year old LOVED the broth and noodles in this one and didn't want to stop slurping it up.  I will definitely make this one again - Swanson broth is delicious for any chicken noodle soup base!

I was looking for a base for ramen soup and this fit the bill. I did add bbq pork and shrimp instead of chicken which was really good. When i stirred in the package of ramen noodles it didn’t look like it was enough so I added the second package. Big mistake. The recipe was correct. My mistake not the authors. The broth on this was really good with the ginger and soya sauce addition. Will be making this again.

I loved ramen noodles as a kid but they became boring to me as an adult. Until I started dressing them up that is and I fell back in love with them all over again. I loved the flavor and color combo in this one and the ginger was a nice touch. Swanson broth has such deep rich flavor but the best part was how fast this all comes together. This is one I see me making often for lunches!

Really easy and really good, my husband had 2 bowls!  I used celery and carrots only and had to add a bit more broth since I added almost 2 full ramen packets. Topped it off with sriracha and it was awesome!  Will definitely make again!

Made this twice. Followed recipe first time except for red pepper which I don't care for. Next time substituted Bok Choy for celery to add to Asian taste. Almost any vegetables could be added. Makes a perfect amount for me - dinner, lunch, and enough to freeze for another meal! A family may need to double. Quick and easy to make. Tastes good too!

I loved this soup. It's simple and quick to prepare, and the Asian flavor is a nice change from the every day chicken noodle.
I did need to add more broth after the noodles cooked, because it all absorbed. So I added a smidge more soy sauce & ginger as well.
This was a great lunch and bonus points for ease of preparation!

I did change a few things due to preference.  I had to split the pot in half to make two, some like ginger, some didn't.  Personally, I liked the ginger!  I used dried red bell pepper instead of fresh as that is what I had on hand, and spaghetti noodles instead of ramen.  Regardless, the family loved it and the ginger loving ones REALLY loved it!  I chop my vegetables smaller and sauté them first to speed up cooking time.  It helps get the 'soup on' faster.

This was great!  I bought a rotisserie chicken and used some of the dark and white meat.  I also used a half an onion instead of green onions, added in the noodle flavor package and I tripled the recipe, except only one and a half packages of noodles as that was perfect.  I'm glad I made more as everyone loved it and it was very filling!

My family LOVED this recipe. My husband said "it's dynamite" and my picky eater child called it "phenomenal." It was barely enough for 3 people so I would recommend doubling it. Everyone wanted seconds but sadly there were none.  (I replaced the pepper with red pepper flakes.)

This was very enjoyable! It would be a good soup to have if you're under-the-weather, too. I purposely got bok choy (which I love) to use in this recipe in place of the celery. I used good quality, low-sodium chicken broth. I added about half of the seasoning packet because of that, to give it more flavor. I probably used about half of the ramen noodles, because they'll probably absorb the liquid after the leftovers stand. I did not use the red pepper, and I don't think I'd like it here. Mushrooms would be good in this. I can also see adding cooked shrimp just before the soup has finished cooking. Both mushrooms and shrimp would give it an Asian flair.  Personal preference, I'd like to spice it up a bit, too with hot sauce or cayenne. This is a keeper - thanks!

We've often made this soup with and without the vegetables and sometimes without the cut chicken! It makes a comforting broth when your sick and a nice meal when you're healthy. Well done.

Wonderful easy dish to put together. I used some chicken based demi glaze in mine which added an even deeper flavor profile. A great quick dish to make especially here during the Arizona  summer when you want to spend as little time around the stove as possible.

This ramen noodle soup is like pho soup. I used fresh ginger root and instead of carrots and peppers, I used bean sprouts, Ba Choy, and fresh tomato.

So good! One of my favorites from this site. I made it exactly according to the recipe and it's fantastic. I added a hard boiled egg as well - and sriracha  on the side. Highly recommend!

Yum! This recipe was fantastic. I didn't have any celery on had so I omitted that, but followed the recipe other than that. I did substitute gluten free ramen noodles per my own needs.

Made this recipe with a bunch of tweaks. 1) used leftover ham and duck from Xmas dinner instead of chicken. 2) used at least double the suggested amount of noodles  ) used 50% more broth than suggested. Other than that, follow the recipe. Those amounts above fed three hungry people. I don't think the recipe would actually serve four people. Turned out EXCELLENT!

I really like the idea of this soup.  Tweaks for the next time would be: 1) hold off on the bell pepper and replace with something more traditionally Chinese, like bok choy, snow peas, etc and I would NOT boil the heck out of the veggies, but that's to each his own!  2) I added another cup of chicken broth or even water might lighten it up a bit, 3) flavor was a bit bland so I added a smidge of extra soy sauce and fish sauce and. . .hello! 4) I would leave the ramen noodles whole, more fun for the kids to slurp.

I used one teaspoon each of onion powder and celery salt to take the place of the green onions and celery.  I loved the flavors of this recipe!!  So unique... and yummy!  I bet it would be good with broccoli cuts as well.

I'm rating it as is.  I added the full quart of broth, frozen peas toward the end and the seasoning packet from the ramen.  It was very good and didn't take long.  I also added a little regular chopped onion along with some green onion & tops.  We both loved it.  I simmered till veggies were real tender, don't like them crunchy or too big in soups.  It doesn't make a whole lot so for a big family you might need to double.  As others have mentioned, other veggies would be good in it also.

This was a much healthier version of ramen soup. My husband really liked it and I liked all the fresh veggies in it.   I used the Swanson's Organic chicken broth and it was very good.

The flavor of this soup is so good!!  It is also very quick and easy to make, which is great for a busy night!  I didn't have any celery on hand so I added a handful of spinach and that was great!  I would agree with other reviewers that it needs a little more broth.

I really liked this chicken noodle soup with the Asian flair. My only problem was that I personally prefer more broth, and I even used only 3 oz. of noodles. So next time, I will add another can of Swanson Chicken Broth in the very beginning and then taste to see if I need to add more soy sauce and ginger as well.
