I love the taste of cooked whole barley, so this recipe appealed to me.  But, good grief!, it was waaay too involved and time-consuming for what it was.  I just used the ingredients as a guideline, and prepared the whole thing in my rice cooker.  Delicious, and took only a few minutes of prep time and about 55 minutes in the steamer.  MUCH easier!

I love this recipe.  I left out the cheese to make it healthier, and it was wonderful.
