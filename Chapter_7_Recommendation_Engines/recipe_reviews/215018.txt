Made these using grapefruit Perrier instead of club soda, because its all I had handy. These were great!! Refreshing, and paired with  the shredded pork tacos very well.

Great with Simply Grapefruit juice.  Also used Sprite instead of Club Soda to make it a little sweeter.

I'm not a tequila fan, but once in a while (like Cinco de Mayo) I get in the mood for a good one.  This is a GREAT one!  I absolutely love it.  I really don't like all the sugar in normal margaritas at 450 a drink, this one has half the sugar and half the calories.  Nicely done!

A nice variation of the margarita.  Some of us had to add a splash of simple syrup.

Good drink but I added some limeade and a little sugar, to balance out the tartness!  Yummy!
