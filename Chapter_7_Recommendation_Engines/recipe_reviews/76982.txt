This was really good! I used dill instead basil. The kids loved it on mini bagels. It was an easy lunch for our picnic.

I love the idea of this, I love all the ingrediants in it and I love this cream cheese, but this was terrible. I dont know what I did wrong, but I followed the directions exactly. I feel bad, but I just did not like this at all.

Came out really good!  What a fun way to have tuna!  I might try dill next time.

Made this for the Faceless Frenzy weekend 2013.  First let me say that I never thought to add tuna and cream cheese.  I went outside my box and found a terrific addition to my lunches!  I bet this would go over big at a party on those mini bagels.  Bonus points because DH really liked this too!  I toasted the bagel.

I made this with regular cream cheese and imported tuna.  Very easy to make, tastes great.  The lemon zest really punches up the flavor.  It might be a little too sophisticated for kids, though.

I thought this was okay.  It took all of three minutes to make in the food processor, so I have to give it credit for being such an easy recipe.  It's nice on a bagel thin.  It tastes good, but not amazing.  I do think there's too much cream cheese, and next time I'll either use half as much cream cheese or double the tuna.

This is an excellent quick recipe!  Great when you need something quick and have "nothing" on hand.  It was great as it was but I generally like spicy. Next time I might try a touch of cayenne pepper.  I served it with larger round crackers and formed it into a cheese ball shape.

Not really impressed.  It was good, but one can of tuna and 8 ounces of cream cheese?  I used half that, and it was still a bit to much.

It was good.  I'm not a big tuna fan so I might use chicken next time.  I used cheap tuna and spread it on a toasted wheat bagel.  I also ended up eating it on my potato chips!

I had this spread on white bread with lettuce and it was pretty good. I think it would be much better on a bagel as intended.

This is one of my favorite recipes. We were snowed in for a few days and my family enjoyed it as a quick snack.
