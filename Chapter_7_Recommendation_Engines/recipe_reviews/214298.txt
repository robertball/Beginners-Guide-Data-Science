I love this cake for the summer time. It's light and very good. I do make it into a cake and I put regular vanilla frosting or coolwhip.

These were very good. I made these into cupcakes for easy individual servings. The JELL-O added a bit of sweetness and kept the cake extra moist. I used Black Berry Fusion JELL-O.

Thought this was a fun recipe. We are gluten free at my house, so we made these with the White Cake recipe from the Irresistibly Gluten Free cookbook. It was great!

A good, basic, and easy recipe. My children, 9 and 7, did all the work (minus the handling of boiling water and working with the oven).  We used blue-berry Jell-O as that is all we had.  The resulting cupcakes are moist and tasty.

These cupcakes were a hit at our house! Instead of buying coolwhip, I made mine homemade ( 2 cups heavy whipping cream- whip until it creates peaks, 1/4 cup confectioners sugar- whip in) it turned out great. These really should be called strawberry shortcakes! It would've been nice if the batter was homemade though- instead of boxed.

Great! I used this idea for some patriotic poke cupcakes! I used fat free cool whip, but a 12 oz tub and piped it with a big ziploc bag with the corner cut off. Tasted like strawberry shortcake!

These were just "ok" for me, I did 1/2 of them with strawberry jello and 1/2 lime. I think it would be easier as a cake then cupcakes because when pouring the jello it sometimes slid off the edge of the cupcake and ran down and under the cup liners so they were a little messy.

I make the cake version & I make this often. My family loves this. I always top it whip cream & fresh sliced strawberries. It's good anyway, but the fresh strawberries make a huge / delicious difference.
