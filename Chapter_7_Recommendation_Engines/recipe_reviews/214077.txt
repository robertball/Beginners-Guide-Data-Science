Didn't have rum and used Chuck Roast instead of Sirloin. Didn't matter to my discerning household, thumbs up all around and a drop of the recipe into the "Will Make Again" folder of the recipe box. Great recipe!!

The marinade for the meat is not very tasty. The yogurt thickens into clumps while cooking on the grill, not a very pleasing texture.   Gave this 3 stars because the grilled fruit is very good! In fact we ended up eating the grilled fruit with the rice and threw the kabobs away.

I love the grilled fruit in this recipe. I used rum extract as I didn't have any rum, and you wouldn't know the difference. The marinade imparted a subtle citrus flavor to the meat. You must be a fan of citrus to like that. It was a good counterpart for the fruit. I served this with the asian coconut rice recipe from this site. Nice all round change from the ordinary.
