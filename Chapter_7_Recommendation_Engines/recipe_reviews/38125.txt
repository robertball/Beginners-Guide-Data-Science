Delicous, and has just a little sparkle of an aftertaste.  Much too good to give the kids--although they love it.

This is a very good recipe if you don't like the extra sweet style of regular chocolate chip cookies. My family and friends loved the cookies, and I wiil be making them again. For an added twist, put in half the amount of ginger, and and 2 tables spoons of cinniman. Very good!

Absolutely loved these! Definitely do not omit the ginger-it is what makes these cookies delicious and unique. Perfect soft and chewy texture. The recipe was extremely easy to make and chopping the ginger was not hard at all. Also instead of using chocolate chips try using chopped up pieces of chocolate, it melts better and is more flavorful.

Ok, a pain to make especially chopping the ginger. Baked 350 for 10 mins, otherwise they turn out too dark.

Great!  I followed recipe almost exactly.  I forgot to add milk, but they came out fine without it.  I also, omitted the crystalized ginger, and just used 1.5 tsp of powdered ginger.  This added just the right amount, I can't imagine how strong the ginger would be if I had used the amount the recipe called for.  I also only used 2.5 cups of mini chocolate chips, and that was plenty.  My family LOVES these cookies.

Finely chopping the ginger is a pain so instead I made tiny cubes and cut them back to a 1/2 cup. The sweetened chunks of ginger adds an extra chewy surprize. I love these cookies

I despise ginger, so getting a 4 star rating from me for a ginger based recipe is a pretty big deal! My hubby and I are boaters and this is the PERFECT food to eat at sea. Simple carbs are stomach settling and so is ginger; combining the two makes for a happy tummy at sea! This is the first super gingery food I have found that I can stand to eat, and I have tried a zillion recipes.

I can't see how the picture listed for these cookies actually goes with this recipe. My first sheet of cookies flattned like pancakes until I added about 1/4+ of flour. The rest of the cookies kept their shape well enough, but the flavor was nothing special. I halved this recipe to begin with, but I kind of wish that I'd made even less.

Not what I expected, but they are very tasty... The texture is similar to that of lace cookies.  The ginger added a great zip.

The ginger was very overpowering in these cookies, or at least that's what I thought originally, and I used less.  However, after they had cooled and been frozen (I do that with my holiday baking) and tried them again, they weren't as overpowering and most of my coworkers liked them.  Maybe the flavor just needed some time to mellow.  I can't remember my other changes and my review was cut off, but they did turn out to be pretty cookies.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is like a choc chip cookie recipe with spice. I didn't have crystallized ginger, so used 2 tsp powdered ginger, 1/8 tsp grd cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice. I also don't believe in shortening so subbed butter for the shortening. Btw I also don't have choc chips, which makes the cookies want them for sure. This is def not your typical ginger cookie. I think they could have used molasses.

Didn't come out like the pictures, but tasty! Never cooked with shortening before, but I liked the results.
