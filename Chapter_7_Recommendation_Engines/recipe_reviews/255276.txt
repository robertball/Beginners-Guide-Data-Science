I also added cheese inside burrito and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  After tasting just the meat mixture, I thought these would be way to hot for us. One all assembled with added cheese and sour cream on top, they were perfect. Delicious flavor.

Excellent!! Very Good!  I didn't however add the jalapenos, cayenne, hot sauce, but everything else I used.  You could always make it half  hot and half not depending on who is eating with you with the heat they like or not.  When I placed the meat on the tortilla, I added a little cheddar cheese then rolled them up (it rolled 6).  After placing them in my dish then I topped it off with Hatch Valley 505 Green Chile Sauce, I sprinkled cheese on top and in the over at  350 for 10 - 15 min.  After over, I then dished one on a plate topped with lettuce, cheese, tomato, sour cream and avocado!  Deeelicious!!  Excellent!!

I made these last week and they were definitely a hit in my home. I have already been asked to make more. I haven't I would like my grown kids to learn how to make their own ha ha ha. What would I change? Nothing the heat was perfect to my liking and the texture was great. Very Good!

This was very good and super simple. I used some homemade taco seasoning since that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, followed the directions as written. I also added a cubanelle to the peppers, because I had some. Everyone enjoyed the burritos! Thanks!

This is delicious!  I used two 10 oz. cans of Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilies) instead of 1 tomato and 2 lbs of ground beef.  The rest of the ingredients I did not change.  It was just right for my families tastes.  This is a keeper!

So awesome, my whole family loved these (even my little guy who does not care for beans at all). The only change that I made was to omit the cayenne to take down the heat, and omit the green pepper because they're my least favourite food.
