This is a very moist, tasty and good cake.  I read the reviews about the bland cake.  I then added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. almond flavoring.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I used leftover fresh peaches that I had sliced with a little sugar the night before. I poured the peaches and the juice in the bottom of the pan.  It all cooked into the cake and made a very pretty and moist looking cake.  Very easy and very good!

I made this recipe for my mother, I used canned peaches instead and in the batter I used 1/2 cup of oil instead of the butter.  The cake was SO FLUFFY and good that my mother just LOVED it!
I will be making this recipe again.. Thanks!

Note: I will try pineapple too and I'm sure it will taste good.

This was my first time making an upside down cake. I must admit this is now my new favorite recipe. I used fresh peaches and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It was delicious. I have four kids 2 of which are fairly picky and they also gobbled it up. Thank you.

It is delicious.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9X13 inch pan as I have so many peaches to use up.  It turned out fine. 
I would highly reccomend this one and would suggest you use butter instead of margarine if you can.

This was OK, the cake part was a little bland, maybe some vanilla or almond extract would make it a little more interesting. The presentation leaves a bit to be desired - I think I would slice peaches and maybe do a spiral design in a round pan if I tried this again, The peach halves just looked like big hunks.

This recipe is so easy and the end result is WONDERFUL!  I followed suggestions and added vanilla,cinamon and some of the peach juice...had to use canned because the peaches in the store were HARD...

I varied the recipe a little like the other cook by adding some almond extract.  I didn't have fresh peach but used drained canned peaches, cutting the sugar in the recipe by 1/3.  Otherwise, this was exceptionally delicious!  It tasted like something my grandmother would make!

This is a great recipe which I made my own with a couple changes:
added fresh strawberries
added cinnamon to the nutmeg and brown sugar
added vanilla extract to the cake
replace regular milk with buttermilk.
The cake was moist and delicious. A great treat for kids and adults!

This is a very good recipe.  I couldn't get fresh peaches so I used drained, canned peaches.  When I turned the cake over I left the cake pan on for awhile to help hold the cake together while it cooled.  It turned out beautifuly.

A delicious recipe, no doubt.  Check your cake carefully, though; mine took about 55 minutes to bake.  I would recommend letting it cool longer than listed, too, as mine fell apart when I flipped it out onto a plate.  But crumbled or not, it's definitely tasty, and not very difficult. (Especially great when you have lots of leftover ripe peaches!)

The cake was very fluffy when warm, but more of a coffee cake texture once cool.  I added some cinnamon to the batter, but overall I didn't feel like this was anything special.  Simply put - we ate the whole cake, but I can think of several other ways I'd rather use 1.5 sticks of butter.

This was a delicious cake. I used a larger pan, so I increased the number of peaches to eight and increased the amount of cake mixture by one half. I stirred the sugar and nutmeg in to the melted butter and poured it over the pan (lined with parchment paper). I also added one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cake batter. The result was delicious.

This cake is truly good.  I used more peach than called for because I needed to use up many that were too ripe and even with what that did as in adding extra bulk and juice, this cake was delicious.  It absorbed the excess and was incredible. I was hoping to share these with family and friends so I made a number of small cakes, baking them in individual crocks.   Well, so much for giving away homemade goodies...we went through these puppies one after another while they were still hot.  Follow the recipe, it's a good one.

I added Marascino cherries and a little more spices (pumpkin pie spice) and it came out fabulous. This is great for family and friends. UPDATE: I found that it needed less baking time for me @ 30 mins. plus I think a little more milk. It was a tiny bit dry but that couldve been from baking too long. A true favorite! Even my mother loved it!

This was a nice cake although i felt it was more a pudding than a cake to be honest. i used tinned peaches as i didnt have fresh, but maybe i didnt drain them well enough as the cake was very syrupy, this is not to say it wasnt nice though. i added some cinnamon to the peaches and some vanilla to the sponge, it was very moist and delicious served with double cream.

I doubled this recipe and used fresh peaches.  They were extremely juice and really threw off the consistency of the final product.  Next time I might cook down the peaches in the brown sugar sauce for a while first and then add the cake batter topping.  Very flavorful and best eaten on the first day.

So good! I sliced and sugared my peaches, then let them set overnight, and added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon when making up the cake. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white in place of the 1/2 cup white called for. My peaches were pretty juicy, so once the cake was browned, I reduced the heat to about 250 and let it cook until the liquid had reduced. This came out delicious! I served it with vanilla ice cream - this is a great way to use up peaches.

Great recipe- cake turned out lovely & moist! I cooked it for 45 min & added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the recipe. May reduce the brown sugar quantity next time. My family & friends loved the flavour of this cake!

This recipe was okay - I was actually looking to make my pineapple upside down cake but none of the major supermarkets had pineapple rings (everyone in town must have been thinking the same thing being Easter and all). I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as other reviewers suggested and, surprise, all my eggs had been hard boiled to make easter eggs with! LOL So I used peach flavored apple sauce, 1/4 cup. The cake came out nicely risen and browned and I turned it out onto a platter - when it came down to dessert, it had kind of "settled" and was more like a pound cake with peaches. It actually tasted lovely, just not the right texture. I don't think that the egg would have made a difference. Try it this way if you like a denser texture.

I made it worse b/c I used whole wheat flour--it is all I had.   Used canned peaches and let them dry for about 30 min.  I followed the instructions to the letter, including bake time.  It tasted OK, but it reminded me of a fancy pancake (wheat flour) rather than a cake.  With butter being almost $5/lb, I won't spend any more time or effort on this recipe.   I took a pic and it is nice--nicer  than it tastes.

I doubled this recipe to put in a 9x13 inch pan.  (See photo)  I did add vanilla after reading the reviews.  My husband and I are diabetic so I used Splenda brown sugar blend in place of regular brown sugar and spenda grandular in splace of sugar.  I also used a diet margarine in place of butter.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat pastry flour.  Even though I did all that, the cake turned out great.  We really liked it!

Not being a great fan of pineapple I have never had an upside down cake. I saw this one that used peaches and thought this would be a good introduction to this kind of cake. I followed the recipe without changing anything. What a nice turnout. The sliced peaches made the cake pretty enough for company. The overall taste and texture were elegant. Thanks for posting the recipe Judy Wilson.

Wonderful!! Delicious!! I used fresh peach slices. I read the reviews and added cinnamon with brown sugar. I added almond flavoring to the batter. I made it in a 10" square pan so I made 1 1/2 times the recipe-using 2 eggs. It took 40 mins to bake. Very moist and tasty.

Quick, easy and delicious!  Great for when fresh peaches are in season.  Cake is moist and not too sweet.  Best eaten the same day that you make it.

Made it tonight with my 14 year old grandson. We did not change anything. It was delicious with the fresh peaches.

This was easy and delicious.  I added the vanilla to the cake batter.  Many compliments from those who tasted.  I used tin peaches too which worked just fine.

3.5  Tasted good but WHAT a mess!!!  Maybe my peaches were extra juicy?  Couldn't have baked it more as the top was quite brown.  Best I stick to crumbles I guess.

Great cake!! I took the advice and added cinnamon  and almond extract to the butter/sugar mixture in the pan, turned out great. I was worried the cake mixture wouldn't be moist enough, but it was perfect: light and moist. Just the recipe for my extra farmer's market peaches!

This is my favorite dessert recipe.  Since finding it last week I have made it 3x's.  First with fresh peaches, second with fresh peaches and pineapple and the last time w/2 peaches, 3 pears and 1 pineapple slice (using up ripe fruit).  I always cook it longer (23 year old oven) so after 40 minutes I put a foil tent over it to prevent top from over browning and cook until it passes the toothpick test (about 15-20 min's. longer).  I let it set ten minutes before I flip it and it comes out perfect. Also, it absorbs some of the extra juices when it sits.  My husband eats a slice everyday and is the reason I bake it so often.  Thank you Judy Wilson.

Fantastic recipe for fresh peaches. I used fresh peach slices that I sprinkled with a little sugar and water the night before use. Since I did not have nutmeg I substituted it with 1/4ts of cinnamon. I poured most of the liquid from the peaches in the bottom of the pan. To the batter I included 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, and a tablespoon of the peach juice. My oven cooks quickly, so it was done in 30minutes. It came out just wonderfully. My husband and I loved this cake.

I used this recipe to make Apricot Upside Down Cake and it turned out totally scrumptious!! I didn't really make any changes though, I didn't make this in a 9x13 pan because of which this baked faster ( the cake layer was just a little less than an inch), but everyone loved it this way coz it turned out better with ice-cream!! Oh and do add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla to the cake batter it turns out even better!!

This is a good recipe, but I mainly used it as a jumping off point.  I used fresh pears not peaches, added pecans to the brown sugar mix, and then dusted the pears with cinnimon.  I doubled the cake so I could use a 9x13 and also added vanilla to it.  The cake was still a little bland and I also had some issues turning the cake out.

I used fresh apricots from our tree. I agree with other reviewers about the cake's texture and spices. I too added cinnamon as it seems strange without it. I might reduce the butter. I used Splenda Brown Sugar and regular Spenda for the cake mixture as I did not have Splenda for Baking on hand. The recipe worked fine anyway. Baked using regular (not convection) bake.

excellent cake!!!  I did not have any fresh peaches and used canned ones.  I would advise anyone doing this to make sure the peaches are very dry or decrease the amount of butter in the bottom of the pan, otherwise you will end up with soggy (still delicious) cake.  I added cinnamon and vanilla extract to the cake batter and it was perfect.  Will definately make again!!

We all absolutely loved this cake!  It was so moist and delicious!  I used sliced peaches instead of the halves and I think that worked a lot better.  The only problem I had was that I had to cook it 55 minutes since at 40 the middle was still very runny.  That meant the edges got burned, but since it's an upside down cake I was able to cut them off easily and no one was the wiser (except my husband when he found the edges in the trash).

I made this recipe in an 8 inch round pan, with the peaches in a spiral so it looked really lovely. My main problem was that in the round pan, by 25 minutes at 375 the outside of the cake was burning, while underneath it was totally raw. I lowered the temperate to 350 and cooked in awhile longer, which worked (although the outside layer was too overdone) but if I try it again I'm definitely cooking it at 350 instead. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp almond extract as others suggested. It tasted good, but was definitely a heavier coffee cake type cake.

This is my second time making this cake and my family has enjoyed it both times. I agree with some people when they said that the cake part was a little bit bland so this time I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. I turned out very well. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

Loved this cake!  Two friends who claim to not like peaches both tried it and said it was delicious!  It is best eaten warm, so I put one piece in the microwave for about 25 seconds and it was good to go.  I spiced my batter up with vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and added just a light sprinkle of ground ginger over the peaches before I added the batter.  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and the batter was very thick.  I thought I had messed something up, as I actually had to spoon and spread the batter over the peaches and throughout the pan, but it turned out fine.  Its taste and texture reminds me of eating Peach Cobbler.  Awesome!  Thanks Judy!

I did as other users suggested and added cinnamon and vanilla. I also used frozen peaches instead of fresh. It's winter and i didn't have any. I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan. I think I might have used a little less butter in the bottom of the pan and made sure that i didn't use any real thick peaces. But I thought it was delicious!  Where there was a thick peach the cake in that one spot was a little under done.

My nieghbor gave me five large peaches and I had to do something with them as they were getting overripe. I sliced my peaches and since they were large, I increased the recipe by 1/2 and used 9x13. I used 2 eggs. I did not increase the peaches.  I also added cinnamon and allspice.  It was real good hot. A keeper. A delightful change from pineapple.

Very good! I sliced my peaches and used about 3 and they were plenty for an 8X8 inch dish. Judge according to the size of your peaches. I think I might add more butter and sugar in the top part. I like it a bit more gooey, it kind of got lost in the peaches.

We loved this cake.  I made a few changes myself.  I uped the recipe by 1/4 for the cake pan size I had to work with.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the brown sugar/nutmeg mixture.  After I mixed the melted butter & brwn sgr mxtr, I added 1 1/2 tsp of granadine sauce by dropping a little in each area where the peachs would be (instead of marachino cherries). I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to egg/sugar mixture.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and used fat free milk.  the wheat cake had a neat texture and yummy taste. Very tasty with vanilla ice cream melting on the side of the warm cake.

I waited 6 months for fresh peaches just to make this upside down cake.  It didn't come together for me.  After the required baking time the batter was still runny in the center.  Even after baking an additional 15 minutes, the batter did't get done.  Needless to say I was disappointed.

Very good cake!  I didn't have fresh peaches so I used 2 cans of sliced.  Drained first, but either there was still too much liquid left or too many peaches because the center didn't cook all the way.  The flavor is awesome though; I topped with a dab of cool whip.  Definately a keeper!  Thank you Judy.

I was a little disappointed in the texture of this cake.  It was very crumbly and not very moist after 40 min of baking time.  It did have a good flavor though.

this cake was AWESOME!!!! i actually used an 7&1/4x11&3/4 pan insted of the 8x8 which also required an extra peach.  i served it warm with evaporated milk which made the cake a little sweeter. this is DEFINATELY a must with all those fresh peaches!!!!!!!!!

I was comparing this recipe to another trying to decide what to make. I chose this one and took advice from cooks of both recipes. One, my family does not like nutmeg-skipped. Two, Added 1t Almond extract, 1t Vanilla extract, 1/2 t Cinnamon In the doubled recipe for a 9x 13 pan. Use your own judgement on how much brown sugar you want on the top as you add it to the pan. I used a little less. I also used a little less white sugar in the cake. I read you can use brown sugar here if you prefer. I did not, I was afraid it would be too much of a brown sugar taste. The peaches, I cut into thick slices. Main advice (as others have noted) LINE THE PAN WITH PARCHMENT PAPER.  My family loved the cake, even those that don’t like peach cake. It’s full of moist flavors. The added extracts really make a difference.

This was a solid cake! I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts, and made in a deep dish pie plate. I left out the spices and the fresh peaches really were wonderful for this. Would make again!

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp almond extract to the batter. A tiny bit bubbled over in the oven so next time I would place a cookie sheet underneath just in case.

LOVE it! I used canned peaches too. I also added vanilla to my egg/sugar, and cinnamon instead of nutmeg with just a 1/4 of the nutmeg called for.
The 2nd time I made it I used cherry pie filling on one side, blueberry pie filling on the other, same vanilla and cinnamon add. I wish I had doubled the cake part it was a bit not a full covering.
Tonight will be Blackberry pie filling!

EXCELLENT recipe!

I made this in a 9x13 pan so I doubled the recipe. I used way more peaches than called for and mistakenly sliced them.  I was out of milk and butter so I used buttermilk and oil which I had on hand. I added almond favoring to the peaches and vanilla to the batter.  Because of the buttermilk, I added a touch of baking soda as well. Not sure how it will work out. If it doesn't work it will be because I altered it too much but what can you do?   Ok- it is out of the oven and cooled. Absolutely delicious.  The cake is tender and moist.  Tons of fruit. Yummy.

Made this cake the other day and i thought it was tasty and had a good texture. I was worried that it would be a bit wet, but I thought it actually needed some peach juice poured over the cake before serving. The only thing preventing five stars was having the mixture or sugar and butter over the cake tin created a glue that the peaches stayed stuck to when I turned the cake upside down! Quickly fixed but meant presentation was a bit iffy....... Definitely make again!

My husband loves this! Almost like a pudding as opposed to a cake. Quite dense but that could be to me practically steaming the cake!
Used a springform pan and it leaked big time! So I put a tray with water on rack below.
Have since read that I should envelop the pan in foil to catch the leaks.

I didn't have milk, so I substituted vanilla yogurt.  It turned out great and very moist.  I did add some nutmeg and cinnamon to the top of the cake before cooking it, but those were the only changes.  My daughter and I at half of it and had a hard time stopping.  Can't wait to finish it tomorrow. :)

I'm not sure what exactly happened. I followed the recipe but made the peaches in slices and placed them in a 9in round. It's so soggy I'm ashamed to bring it to work. Anyone else have this happen to them? Cake definitely needed some flavor help too. 
Giving this 2 stars because I'm guessing I should have just done the peach halves in an 8x8. Disappointing.

I had to share how good this cake was using drained,canned pears.  I used the irregular pear pieces.  I also added a teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of vanilla to the batter.  It was delicious and very pretty. Best cake I ever made from scratch.  The recipe is a keeper.

I made this with apple instead of peaches and it was pretty good! 
I will repeat it, but in a smaller round pan. In my opinion, the cake is too "low". But it's very tasteful and moist. 

Good one! :)

This is old fashioned goodness. The cake is almost a shortbread and the nutmeg adds the perfect touch. I didn't have any milk, so I used sour cream. I also added about 1/2 t vanilla to the batter. I will make this every time I have peaches. Thanks for sharing!

I left out the nutmeg but didn't miss the flavor. I agree that the cake had an unusual texture but the flavor reminded me of a shortbread. Very buttery tasting. I used fresh sliced peaches which are in season now so they were great. I cooked this in my convection oven for 40 minutes and it cooked up fine. I gave it only 4 stars because it was too rich tasting for me.
Thanks for the recipe.

This is great!!  We always had Pineapple growing up this is a great way.  We live near tons of peach farms so this is a great way to use some of them up! I do agree that adding almond or Vanilla  makes it so much better!

Try canned peaches, my fresh peaches were a little too bitter. I drizzled a tiny bit of liquid heavy whipping cream over and around my slice. Excellent! I also added a bit of almond extract to the cake mixture and topped the peaches with a bit of cinnamon and sugar. When I tried to spread the mix over the peaches, it made the cinnamon kind of swirl a little into the batter, which tasted great. Mine would have burnt if I kept it in the oven 40 minutes. It was done at 25. Yummy! Next time I will try canned peaches.

I followed this recipe exactly and it seemed to be a little soggy, which might have come from the amount of brown sugar called for.  The taste and presentation were great which is why I gave it four stars

I made this in a 10-in. round cake pan. I didn't have any nutmeg, so I used cinnamon instead. I also used fresh, sliced peaches and added the extra juice to the cake batter. They were really juicy peaches, and there was a lot of juice around the sides of the pan when I spread the batter over the top. But the cake turned out beautifully. It was done right around 40 min. We had warm slices topped with whipped cream—divine!
