I made a couple of changes based on personal preference. Baked beans are a little too sweet for our liking and with the addition of brown sugar and ketchup we wouldn't have cared for them at all. I swapped out some of the baked beans for pinto's and then cut the brown sugar and ketchup in half. Because I cut some of the called for liquid out, I did not drain my chili beans or one can of my pinto's. 45 minutes uncovered at 350 degrees gets these pretty thick but the bacon flavor comes through nicely. This is one you can play around with until you get the perfect combo that suits your taste.

These beans get nice and firm and are easy to make. I put them together the night before and refrigerate.  Just make sure to let them warm up a little at room temp before baking.
