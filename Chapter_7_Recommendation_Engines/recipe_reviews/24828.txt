This recipe was not that great.  The blueberries and plum did not blend well with the melons and pineapple.  It may have made a pretty salad, but the flavor left a lot to be desired.

I made this for a church cookout and it was very well received!!  Only added a couple tablespoons of sugar to juice it up a bit.

I made this recipe this weekend for a cookout and it was fantastic, despite a lot of the fruit not being perfectly ripe since it is early in the season.  I added strawberries to the recipe as well, since they are my favorite.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

This recipe is better with a teaspoon of cinnamon.  The cinnamon helps bring all the flavors together, yet keeps each one separate.  The cinnamon also gives a sweeter note to any of the fruit that may be slightly under-ripe or tart.
