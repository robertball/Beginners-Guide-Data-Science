I have never had Irish Soda Bread before, so I have nothing to compare this to. This was very much like a big, yummy, buttery biscuit. I didn't have caraway seeds or currants, so I only used raisins. I made one round with the raisins, and one without, because some of my family doesn't like raisins. I liked the one with the raisins better. They gave it a nice mildly sweet flavor. Maybe it was my oven, but I found that I needed to increase the baking time about 5-7 minutes and I had to drape foil over the bread for the last 10 minutes or so, to prevent over-browning. All in all, this was good.

Loved it!  I made two different recipes for Irish Soda Bread and far-and-away preferred this one for the following reasons: 1. Texture.  This was so light and flaky.  The other one I made was very heavy and dense. 2. Quick cooking time:  Only 30 minutes!  (I did need an additional 5 minutes.) 3. Round loaves: I like my Irish Soda Bread in round loaves, not in loaf pans.  This makes 2 round loaves, so we ate one and gave the other away!

Best soda bread recipe I've made from this site. Saves really well as long as you have it covered. Toasts wonderfully. As far as traditional goes, because this recipe is one of the only ones to not have eggs in it, it is a bit closer to 'traditional' Irish Soda bread (which is just buttermilk, flour, soda, and salt). If you ask me, this variation is much more flavorful, but a lot closer to the right texture.  As far as dried fruit goes, I had a neighbor who immigrated from Ireland who made soda bread with currants in it all the time.

Absolutely delicious! I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all-purpose. I added an extra T of sugar. I omitted the caraway seeds, and used all raisins since I didn't have currants. My husband doesn't like raisins, so I reserved them until I was kneading the dough, then added them to only one loaf, kneading them in right before I formed the loaf for baking.  I had to bake for an extra 15 minutes at 375 F, for a total of 45 minutes baking time. I took the loaves out of the oven when the tops were golden brown and a knife inserted into the middle came out clean.   I'll definitely make this again -- possibly tomorrow! :)

Now THIS is what soda bread is supposed to taste like!  Perfect texture!  This is the best thing to come out of my oven in a long time.

Very good- like a giant british scone, only more crunchy on the outside due to the longer baking time. It was too mushy to knead, and needed a lot longer (and lower temp) baking to finish the inside. So when I make again (definitely will), I will use less milk. But it was really very good. I like that the sweetness comes from the dried fruit instead of white sugar. (I skipped the caraway, by the way. I think that would probably ruin it! But to each his/her own!)

This had a wonderful texture and the kids loved it.  I did not have currants or caraway seeds,but for our purposes I think that just raisins was perfect.  I think this bread would have been great even without the raisins.  It wasn't as powdery as some other soda bread recipes are.

Very Good recipes! A lot like scones.  I used my food processor to incorporate the butter which made it a lot faster than by hand.

I could tell this bread was going to be excellent by the beautiful, marshmallow-y feel of the dough!

I used white flour and all raisins - since I didn't have currants on hand.  Also didn't use the caraway seed - we really don't care for them.

I baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then covered with foil and baked for another 15 minutes at 375.....but at that point - they weren't done - so I baked them uncovered for another 6 minutes... - they still weren't done - so baked, covered for another entire 10 minutes....then were perfect!....must be my oven!

The flavor was perfect - not too sweet - not too savory - not too crumbly - if cut with a really sharp steak knife.

Thanks - will always use this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yummy-licious!!!!!

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  This is very easy to make.  It is so yummy that I made 2 loaves for this past St. Patrick's day, and then another 3 loaves since!  I love to warm up a slice and spread butter on it.  Other than making the 2 tsp of caraway seeds heaping, I don't change a thing.  Do not skip the currants or caraway seeds, they help make it delish!

This bread had a delicious taste but was very crumbly when cut into slices.  So we were buttering "pieces" rather than a "slice."  Maybe that's the nature of the beast, or maybe I did something wrong ... I very rarely bake anything.  I'm giving it a 4 only because of the consistency.  But the taste was definitely a 5.

A really good slightly sweet bread with a crusty outside and tender inside. I have never seen or tasted an Irish Soda Bread before, and this turned out very well.  The directions say to bake the ball of dough, but I flattened the ball into a circle about 1 1/2 inches tall as I thought that might bake more evenly.  The bread rose up with a nice rounded top.  I would recommend a lower baking temp or less baking time as my bread was already browning at 15 min. and was done before the 30 min. time specified.

A very reliable recipe! I omitted the currants and the caraway seeds. I also added an extra tablespoon of sugar ( a sweet tooth is a major trait in my family). Sometimes I use lemon juice instead of the apple cider vinegar, it adds a very faint lemon taste which my sister really likes. This recipe is definitley a family favorite!

Wowwweee! This is just what I was looking for in Irish Soda bread. I've made several others, but they cannot compare to the wonderful crumbly texture of this. I omitted the currants since I didn't have any on hand and used white vinegar instead of the cider. This will become a regular in my house for sure.

5 stars! Great recipe. I tried the amazingly easy Irish Soda bread from this site last year and it did not come out nearly as good it was very dense unlike this recipe. The only moderations I had was that I used 3 quarter cup and a Tablespoon of buttermilk instead of the milk and apple cider vinegar. I also made road loaves and cut an X in the top. Thank you for posting!!

Delicious and easy!  We used buttermilk in place of milk&vinegar and it was great.  I'll make this a few more times before March 17th!  Also, we got 2 loaves out of it, but it definitely wouldn't serve 24 of us.  More like 8.

I can't really rate the recipe since I modified the recipe a bit to suit my tastes. I used all whole wheat flour 3/4 cup + 3 tbs BUTTERMILK instead of the milk with apple cider vinegar. Eliminated the caraway seed, currants and raisins since I wanted to serve it plain with something savory. Used frozen butter ( to insure it will be flaky) and just cut it in with two knives.  Shaped it into 2 round loaves and cut a cross in the middle of each loaf. Before baking, I brushed the loaves with about 1/4 cup buttermilk to get a nice crusty outside. The baking time was just fine for me since I have a convection oven. Hope this helps! =D

I have made this now several times and everyone I share this with absolutely loves it.  To cut calories, I use skim milk and sometimes applesauce in place of the butter. Still delicious - just love those family recipes!

I had given up on finding a great recipe for 'sodie' bread until now. THIS IS THE BEST recipe ever! I did  use raw sugar instead of white, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extract. Did not have currants and omitted the caraway seed. These round loaves turned out beautifully! ~A big hit! I will make it again for Easter, can't wait to share it! Thanks so much!!!

this was a perfect recipe! and to to all the people having the problems with the baking time, if you cross cut the dough before you stick it in the oven (the traditional way of baking to "let the faeries out" while its baking) this cooking time is perfect. i added an extra T of sugar and put about a 1/4 t of vanilla in it to add a little extra oomph and that also made this recipe super popular!

This was a great recipe for irish soda bread.  I wish it was a little more moist.  That was my only complaint but I think that's the nature of soda bread.

Not exactly the Irish soda bread I remember as a kid...I had an Irish friend in school and her mother would always make it, however this is very delicious and easy to make on its own. Currants aren't the easiest thing to find, but I did eventually find them and they are quite delicious in this bread or on their own.  This bread also keeps well in the fridge - there was no way I could eat all of it on my own (even when I halved the recipe to get just 1 loaf) however it stayed tasty even after a week had gone by. I will surely make this again in the future :)

This recipe was perfect and absolutely delicious!  I used 1C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2C all-purpose flour, but that is the only change I made.  I loved the raisins and currants, but the caraway seeds were my favorite part! They add a depth of flavor to this bread that can't be achieved any other way.  Please don't leave them out! The texture was perfect, and everyone loved it! This bread will be added to my regular rotation. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Huge hit with my family and friends!! The best part is how easy it is and the fact that it's made from things you already have in the kitchen.

Really good fresh out of the oven.  I didn't have caraway seed and subbed raisins for the currants since my hubby doesn't care for currants.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of sweet dough flavoring just to see what kind of an effect it would have but would leave it out next time.  Overall a great addition to our St. Patty's day meal, thanks!

This recipe was great!  I made this for a St.Patrick's Day party and everyone there loved it. This was the first time I've made Irish soda bread; it reminded me alot of making buttermilk biscuits.  My husband said to put it on my "Make Again" list.

We loved this with our corned beef and cabbage soup. Couldn't stop eating it. But did need 5 more min to cook. I put foil over it for the last few min so it wouldn't burn outside was done inside needed more time.

I never had Irish Soda Bread before. I decided to make it today. This recipe is great!!! It took minutes to put together and my husband rolled his eyes upon tasting it and said, "Hmmmm....this is delicious!" I didn't have currents, but I will definitely get some now...I used caraway seeds and glad I did...Thank you! I will make over and over....

Not the *very best* soda bread I’ve ever had, but excellent nonetheless.  I put it on the table to go with a meal and it became the star attraction.  The reward for the effort  makes this recipe a good use of your time.

Very tasty with butter when it's still hot. I thought the temp was a bit high as mine browned to quickly (and I started at 375F). I suggest 180C/350F. The texture is like a homemade style American style biscuit.

This was yummy.  Not too heavy.  Wonderful hot out of the oven.  I did not put in the currants or caraway seeds because I didn't have them.  I served this with corned beef and cabbage.

This recipe is good, but it's not Irish soda bread. It's more like a gigantic, buttery biscuit. It's a very good buttery biscuit, but not the Irish soda bread I remember from childhood, so I could only give it 4 stars for misleading me. . .   This is a really quick and easy quick bread, and seems to please everyone. It's also very versatile and adaptable. Don't let the 4 stars make you reluctant to try it, just remember that it's just not Irish soda bread.

I didn't know what soda bread was so decided to try it because I love caraway seed. Well! I just love this and it is addictive. The only things I did different was to use margerine instread of butter and use buttermilk and leave out the vinegar. A deffinate keeper. Thanks

This was wonderful! I didn't have the caraway seeds on hand so I omitted them, but there wasn't a crumb left by the end of my St. Patrick's Day! It turned out rich and dense--almost creamy in its texture. It was a definite family hit.

I love you Nana Dot! This was OUTSTANDING. The only changes I made were: no carway seeds (it was optional anyway) and I did not have any currants so I used craisins along with the raisins. Excellent!

I substituted 3/4 tsp. anise extract for caraway seeds. Recipe made 2 small loaves, which tasted very good; more like a scone or muffin texture. It was moister and tasted even better after a couple of days. Good recipe!

I’ve made this recipe quite a few times and everyone loves. We enjoy it at St. Patty’s Day with our corned Beef and Cabbage but we also enjoy it with a nice cup of tea or coffee. Outside of St. Patrick’s Day, I add a variety of dried fruit: blueberries, cherries, cranberries, apricots, and golden raisins

Will definitely make again!  Made it the lazy way, with my breadmaker.  Substituted golden raisins for raisins and substituted buttermilk for milk.  Dumped all ingredients into pan  in order as listed on recipe, set breadmaker to mix Dough, removed paddle, scraped down sides of pan, set breadmaker to Bake for 1.25 hrs.

I have used this recipe every St. Paddy's day for the last 5 years and it always gets rave reviews!  I usually leave out the caraway seed (I think it's too strong of a flavor for a crowd.)  When I split it in 2, I put raisins in half and leave the other half plain.  I haven't had leftover bread yet! Yummy!

Excellent flavour!  Can also be made into scones if desired.  I did have a bit of a more crumbly texture than I wanted...slicing was crumbly and messy.  Anyone know what can prevent this as I really would like it to be a bit more 'together'.  I did not over-knead.

i replaced milk + vinegar with same amount of fat-free plain yogurt (plus a tiny spoonful more 'cos i think the dough was too dry to stick together completely), and i had made them into 8 small loaves instead of 2 big ones, so i know my version is not the genuine irish soda bread.  but it still turned out to be tasty.  overall, this recipe is simple, easy, and quick.  really worth a try!

AWESOME! Easy recipe and so good. I used 1 cup of soaked raisins and 1 scant cup of buttermilk...because I had it on hand . Good thing it made 2, because we gobbled up the first one in no time flat. I will make this again and share with all my friends. Thanks for sharing Nana Dot's delicious recipe.

I chose this version of Irish Soda bread because it originated from someones mom. In my opinion those are some of the best tried and true recipes. It was wonderful!!! I did have to bake it a bit longer, about 10 minutes) but over time I'll perfect that part of it too. This recipe is an absolute keeper!

My whole family loved the taste of this bread. I also like that you don't have to go out and buy buttermilk just for the recipe. The milk plus vinegar used in the recipe is a perfect substitute. Preparation was fairly simple and we only used raisins (1.5 cups) since that's all we had on hand. As far as baking goes, I found that after just 15 minutes in the oven on 400 the bread was already brown AND crunchy on the outside. So I had to cover it with foil for the remainder of cooking time. And we noticed it was quite crumbly when we cut into it (so on the dry side) but still the taste was delicious! Next time I bake it, will have have to watch it like a hawk to make sure it doesn't brown too much or get too dry.

Yummm..Meeeee!!! I made this for St Patty's day and it was devored by my entire family!!! I left out the raisens and currents b/c my daughter would not have eaten it otherwise. However next time I will make a double batch and put the currants in half and nothing in the other! Super easy!! :)

I've always used a recipe from Epicurious for Irish Soda Bread before trying this one. Now this will be the recipe I use for Irish Soda Bread. The texture and consistency of the bread is wonderful. I didn't have currants so I used cranberries...next time I may try dates as I also have those on hand regularly.

Every year on St. Patrick's Day I try to make Irish Soda Bread, and every year I've been disappointed... until I tried this!  It's light and buttery.  I couldn't care less if it's authentic or not, as long as it tastes good.  -Totally ruined my diet when it came out of the oven :)

Also, I was worried about caraway seeds together with raisens (don't know what a current is), but it works somehow.

THis was so easy to make and so tasty.  Perfect amount of sweetness from the dried fruit (I only used raisins).  As another rater stated the top of mine was very brown after the first 15 minutes so I did tent it with foil for the remaining time.  Based on other reviews as well, I left it in the over to about 10 minutes AFTER I  the oven off at the specified time just to be sure it cooked all the way through.

Best bread I've ever made (and the first I've ever bothered to rate, heh). Absolutely excellent, wonderfully buttery and soft. I used both raisins and currants in the amounts given, but no caraway seeds, and it was amazing. I will definitely be making this again!

This was a good recipe, but it isn't a "traditional" Irish soda bread recipe. Dried fruit was only a rare occasion to add and butter was put on the bread after it was baked, not in the dough. So your recipe was changed as it got passed down and got "Americanized" if you want the real traditional Irish Soda bread check out the Society for the Preservation of Irish Soda Bread to get the real thing.

This is the best recipe I have found for Soda Bread!  Just in time for St. Patrick's Day.
I brushed a bit of buttermilk on the crust before baking to brown / crisp it a bit.  It came out delicious... Definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe as written! I made minor modifications, omitting caraway seeds and currants because I did not have any on hand. I also used golden raisins in place of regular raisins, increasing the quantity to 1.5 c to replace the missing currants. It came out with a wonderful texture and taste. Thanx JerzPixelPusher!

I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough flour but it turned out wonderful anyway.  The loaf it made is small and it baked up more evenly than another Irish Soda Bread recipe I tried.  I had some chopped dried dates so I threw in a bit with the raisins.  Husband raved about this bread and he is not that big of a bread fan, especially with raisins.  It is a wonderful, very easy recipe.   Recommend.

Very easy recipe to make, and the final result is delicious! The completed dough during kneading was very sticky, so prepare for that. Using a fan oven, the dough needed a fair amount of time extra baking time, but that could be a factor of the thickness / shape of my loaf. I did not incorporate caraway seeds.

I was looking for a Irish Soda Bread recipe that was quick, easy, and made with ingredients I keep on hand, and this was the one. Only exotic ingredient was currants - no one sells them around here. I made do with extra raisins. Also, I am allergic to common wheat, so I used spelt flour. No adjustments needed. Very nice!

The taste is great. However,  the texture was not what I am used to for Soda Bread.  This one comes out more like a cornbread.  I had noticed that the dough was a bit too sticky for what I expected, but since it was my first time using the recipe I left it as directed. Next time I will add a bit more flour and knead it a bit more to get that dense texture I am searching for.   Tastes great with a little butter though :)

Just made this using my food processor.  Only used the 1 cup of raisins (no currants) and no caraway seeds.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  It was absolutely delicious.  It was quick and easy and served 8 people with a little left over.  Yes, the dough was sticky, but I used a little flower and was able to form the two loafs with ease.  I've saved this to my book of favorite recipes, it was that good.

This is my go-to recipe for Irish soda bread. I use 2 cups of fruit, a combination of raisins, craisins & golden raisins.  No caraway. I bake the loaves in two 9" round pans & I brush the loaves with a mixture of melted butter & buttermilk (optional). Delicious.

This was my first time making this bread and WOW is it a good recipe!  It reminds me of what my Irish neighbor used to make.  Absolutely on point!  I made two batches, one with raisin and the other with mini chocolate chips.  I used silicone muffin cups and hit them with a little spray of oil.  They slid right out and were perfectly browned.  The muffins took 18 minutes in my convection oven at 400.  Each batch gave me 22 - 24 muffins.  I made these for my daughter to take to work and I am going to have to make two more batches because they are just THAT good!

Not sure how other people kneaded this bread since mine was more a quick bread consistency. Orher than that, it was great! Will definitely use raisens and currants from now on. Also, this recipe made 2 6" loaves = 8 servings.

Great tender Crumb and nice yellow color.  I used irish butter, plumped the raisins in warm water, and put turbaned sugar on the outside.  After shaping it I let the loaf sit for 10 minutes before baking to let the loaf rise a little, like a mini proof. Made a half recipe and came out wonderful! perfect size little loaf.

I halved the recipe (ended up using about ~3/4 cup butter), used GF flour, buttermilk instead of milk, and only the caraway seeds as a mix-in.....the result was a deliciously salty, buttery and satisfying bread that is worthy of eating year-round!

Wow, this was delicious! I have never made Irish soda bread before and did not know what to expect. I gotta say, going into the oven and while it was baking, it just looked like a big biscuit and I was prepared to be disappointed. But hot out of the oven, my boys dove into it and LOVED it! I will absolutely make again.

I needed a good basic recipe to start from and this hit the mark. I think pretty much everyone adjusts recipes to their taste, so here are my adjustments. It was wonderful, and I will make this again.

I used 3/4 cup (plus a splash extra) buttermilk instead of milk & vinegar. I added an extra Tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla and omitted the raisins, currants and caraway seeds.

I formed the dough into two round loaves, cross cut the top and brushed with a mixture of buttermilk & vanilla (when I poured my 1/4 tsp over the measuring cup a little spilled over so I went with it)... Then I sprinkled a little white sugar on the top before baking at 375 for 25 minutes, turned the oven off and allowed the bread to finish baking as the oven cooled slightly (~5 minutes).  

Absolutely delicious!!!

Good God, Nana Dot knew what she was doing. I figured I'd bring a soda bread to the family dinner on St. Patrick's Day. I've never made one before but this turned out light and tasty and it was not a hassle to make. I didn't see currants at the store so I chopped up some dessert dates (the kind that come ready to eat; very sweet and rather sticky) but other than that didn't change anything. This is about as easy to make as homemade pancakes.

Love this! I've been using it for years. I use golden raisins because my family doesn't like regular ones. The caraway seed it a must!

this was my first try at irish soda bread and we agree with ~S~ that this reminds us of a yummy buttery biscuit.. we're not partial to sweet so we made it without the raisins/currants and did include the caraway seed.. sliced this up and enjoyed with some vintage dubliner.. very yummy.. ty so much for the recipe

Great recipe. Tastes just like the Irish soda biscuits they used to serve at the Irish pub where I had my Irish step classes. Brought back good memories and a great addition to our Americanized yet family traditional corned beef & cabbage meal !

I had trouble getting the dried fruit to stick in the batter, and the baked loaves were a little delicate, but the texture and taste are fantastic! I also needed to add some time to the end of cooking—maybe ten minutes.

I was really excited to make this soda bread and was so disappointed! It had such a distinct flavor of too much baking powder/soda combination and was actually a bit salty.  I followed the directions exactly only varied by omitting the currants and caraway seeds. I'm giving it 1 star because I thought the consistency was good, but not the flavor.  Also, I'm not sure what size loaves you're making cause it's not possible to get 2 unless they are only 4-5 inches around.

I love this recipe!  My son is has dairy and egg allergy so I used plain soy milk instead of milk.  Came out great! Now he will have something to bring to his St Patricks day party at school that everyone can eat.

This is the first time I ever tried to make Irish Soda Bread, but we have some every year, usually store bought. This is THE best soda bread anyone in my family has ever tasted, and my next door neighbor loved the loaf I gave her, too. Didn't use currants, only raisins, simply because no one sells currants around here. Also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and used Splenda instead of sugar. Out of this world good!

Very good!  I don't care for caraway seeds so I omitted them.  I also stirred the vinegar into the milk and let it sit to make a buttermilk (before pouring it in the mix).  I've never had Soda bread before but it had the texture just like a scone.  It is sweet like a scone too, so if you want more savory, reduce the sugar.

Really, really quick and easy - baked perfectly.  Thanks Nana!  My nine year old made it as directed, but left out the raisins, caraway seeds and currents (yes - picky eater) - I added tablespoon more sugar (not necessary).  It was very tasty and none was left-over.  We will make this recipe again.

The combined taste of raisins and caraway seeds in this recipe is wonderful.  I'd never had Irish soda bread before, but this was great!  This recipe will not give you cake-like bread, but a denser, scone-like loaf; I imagine it’s more of a traditional Irish soda bread recipe.  I halved the recipe, left out the currants, and didn’t need to cook it quite as long as suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!
