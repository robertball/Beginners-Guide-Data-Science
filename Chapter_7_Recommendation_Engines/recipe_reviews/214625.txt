These were really good!  I did make one change, though not a huge one.  Instead of using dried oregano, I used fresh since mine is growing so fast in my garden.  I served with mango chutney and cream cheese, with sliced red onion - fabulous!  My husband and son both loved them and said I can make them anytime.

Excellent burgers, we loved them!  I did make a change though by making and then topping the burgers with homemade greek tzatki. The slightly gamey taste of the lamb worked well with tzatki (made w/fat free greek yogurt)and allowed to skip a fattening condiment like mayo.  We added a greek side salad and glasses of sangria for a great friday night meal.  Would definetely make again.

This recipe is just AMAZING!   Very very easy to make and my kids love it!   My husband and I took the suggestion of having Syrah with them and it was a very delicious pairing...my son made shoestring french fries and added a little fresh rosemary and sea salt to them - wow what a meal!

These were good but I made a few changes. I added Italian seasoning instead of all the separate herbs. I added mint sauce instead of fresh mint and served on wholemeal rolls with garlic mayo. Really tasty and very moist.

these were really good, i did not have some of the intredients like cilantro, fresh mint and white wine vinegair, and no grill  or barbeque. I cooked in some ghee in cast iron pan, and everyone including the kids loved them. served them with sliced tomatoes and onions. Also fried some onions until soft and brown in the leftoever fat, and topped the lambergers. Will be making again with missing ingredients added!

Great seasonings though I did tweak the meat and omitted the egg/breadcrumbs. I did half beef and half lamb so I wouldn't have to use the egg/breadcrumbs and make it juicier. Other than that, this is a keeper!

Made this for a tailgate and added grilled portobello mushrooms (marinated in balsamic vinegar, touch of oil and black pepper), red onion, tomato and romaine lettuce. Very good!

Made these as sliders and served with marinated onion, cucumber and tomatoe salad on toasted whole wheat dinner rolls with chipotle mayo on bottom bun. Served with an Amarone- the sweet complimented the spice.

These were wonderful!  One tiny change - i didn't use the sherry.  Other than that i made them exactly like this and they really were amazing.  Moist and tender and flavorful.  They smelled so good and tasted even better.  THANKS!

This was a tasty recipe and a great way to use ground lamb. I just made a few adjustments, including using fresh oregano (as another reviewer suggested) and I doubled the bread crumbs as the consistency of the burger mixture was too 'wet.' I served the burgers on buns with garlic mayonnaise, lettuce, and feta cheese. A delicious meal!

Pretty tasty I must say! Along with infusing the lamb with eggs and tiny bread crumbs, I put blue cheese crumbles in there as well. It works very well with the dry sherry. I also didn't use the red pepper or oregano. Still just as delicious.

I love this recipe so much. I hate cilantro, so I just eliminate that. And I'm grain-free, so I replace the bread crumbs with cashew meal. The burgers have such a great flavor and they are always moist and delish! Thank you for posting it!

This was a HUGE hit in our house.  The preschoolers loved it (I may lessen the spices just a tad for them next time), and my husband has declared it to be a new "staple" in the house.  We use toasted English muffins instead of hamburger rolls (something my mom used to do). I have made it with dried mint and fresh (the latter is preferred, but the former will do).  This summer I'm likely to use all fresh herbs instead of any dried, but in the meantime, however we need to make it will make the whole family happy.  Now if I can just remember to make the Tzatziki the day before...
