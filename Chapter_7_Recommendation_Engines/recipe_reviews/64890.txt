We looked forward to having this for quite a few weeks, having to wait until my local store got fresh apricots in stock. I collected genuine spring water from one of the many live local springs in Manitou Springs, CO. The juice was easy to make, but frankly, I was a bit disappointed. The juice was pretty weak-tasting. It was okay, but nothing special, so I'll give it a 3-star rating. I only had some of it, and gave the rest to The Woman I Love. She, on the other hand, loved the juice, and would give it a 5-star rating herself.
