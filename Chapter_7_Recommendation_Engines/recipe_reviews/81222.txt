Sorry- I don't like to give bad reviews, but I followed this recipe to a "T" and you have to REALLY like the flavor of blue cheese to enjoy this burger. Sorry.

I loved these burgers. Next time, I will use a little less blue cheese than what is called for. Other than that, this recipe is fantastic.

WAY too much blue cheese, and we love blue cheese. Next time I'll leave it out and serve it crumbled on the side - burger itself would be really good.

I tried these after reading the reviews, (and yes you have to like blue cheese. I solved the falling apart problem with an egg. It doesn't alter the taste or texture. It's what I call FOOD GLUE, They were Great I'll make these again.

The name says it all!!   I was asked to bring burgers to a picnic.  I do not eat burgers anymore so I had to find a recipe and happened upon  this one.  I followed the recipe to the letter but omitting the blue cheese. I tried one to see how they turned out and OMG!!!!   It was incredibly moist and delicious!  I was able to make 12 bun sized patties.

These burghers were wonderful!  I split the recipe since I was only cooking for 2 people.  The shredded potato was a nice touch because it kept the burgers juicy.  You didn't even know the potato was in there!  They also had a lot of flavor!  I would make these again!

These burgers were so good, the best recipe I've ever made. Blue cheese really does make the burger. I've made it 3 times already and my family can't get enough.  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

I found this recipe in a newspaper and I have made these burgers for over 40 years!  My family prefers them without the buns and blue cheese.

OMG!!  Love, love, loved these.  Suprisingly, the blue cheese was not too overwhemling and they were the the most moist and tender burgers I've ever made.  I re-heated one the next day in the microwave, and it was still tender and juicy.  My mom is not a big fan of blue cheese and even she like them.  Will definitely make these again!

These were pretty good. My boyfriend loved them, but I thought it was a little too much for a burger. Which was ironic because usually I'm all for complex flavor and my boyfriend usually enjoys more bland foods. My biggest turn-off was the bleu cheese. Again, ironic because I usually love it. But I think it just didn't work for this. We will probably make these again when the occasion arises, but not anytime soon. Still tasty and enjoyable, but not high on the list of my favorite dishes.

Despite the fact that I didn't measure out the Worcestershire sauce, and ended up adding way too much, we enjoyed these. I was skeptical about the grated potato but it did indeed keep the burgers moist. I cooked them on the Foreman grill. Thanks!

Fell apart, but other than that, they turned out pretty good. I will make these again but will grind up the onion and potato into really small pieces. Thanks!

Nice change from the usual burger, very moist and flavorful.  I didn't have bleu cheese so I used shredded mozzarella instead, and used bleu cheese salad dressing as a topping.  Great flavors!

We loved this recipe.  I've been making it now for nearly two years and every time I have a bbq, everyone asks if I'm cooking these burgers.  After the first time, I cut back to 2/3 of the blue cheese from the recipe and haven't looked back.

We just got done eating these - They would have been better with 1/2 blue cheese or none. I LOVE blue cheese but was way too much for me. Probably 1/2 would be good.

I don't eat burgers but I served these at a bbq and they were a huge hit.  I omitted the blue cheese (didn't have any) and substituted hot salt for seasoned salt and a red onion for the yellow onion because that's what I had on hand.  Several people asked me for the recipe, including a 63-year old who said it was the best burger he ever had in his life.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the first time and couldn't believe how good these were.  I would pay for these at a restaurant if I didn't have the recipie.  My husband loved them too.  We will definitely make these again.  I did use just a tad less blue cheese than it called for after reading other reviews and it seemed to be perfect.

Lovely Burgers!
I'm not normally a blue cheese lover, but it went perfectly in this burger. Lovely and soft, didnt fall apart on the BBQ either.

Definitely will be making again!

These were really delicious. I didn't tell anybody what was in them (and I mixed all the ingredients while everybody else was outside), and the only thing my boyfriend could see was the onion (and he had all kinds of things to say about why you DON'T put things in the burgers!). Also, we were out of bleu cheese... but anyway, after all the plates were cleaned, I very triumphantly listed off what was in the burgers. Nobody's going to argue with ME about how I make my food again! At least, not until the next meal...

This is the best burger I've ever made myself! I didn't have any potatoes, so I skipped that, and I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese because that's all I had, but it was still fantastic! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I didn't have any potatoes, and we don't care for blue cheese, so I omitted those 2 ingredients.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe, and these were fantastic!  They were the best burgers I've ever made at home!

My family really enjoyed these. I placed the patties in the freezer for about an hour before cooking to help them hold together, and they did.

My family loved them, I can't wait to make them again.  Very juicy & flavorful.  I did cut back on the blue cheese a bit and they were delicious.

A pretty good burger! I don't care for a big dose of blu cheese, so I used a single serving (2-3oz.)of blu cheese salad dressing and fried them on the stove top. They would have fallen apart if I had tried to grill them. I will cook them again. Thanks for posting.

Well I did not use Bleu Cheese though I love it..but was most intriqued by the idea of a grated potato. So..I put an onion and a small tater peel and all in the food processor. Gave it a whirl and added it to some 80/20 ground beef. Oh MY!! THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!!! There is no tater taste at all and the burger was luscious and moist and cooked perfectly. Probelm though...it is addictive!

These burgers were absolutely delish! Made them over the weekend for my two best friends. I  less than halved the recipe because I only had a 400g packet of minced beef. Added 100g blue cheese, smatter of mixed herbs for added flavor. Didn't use the worcestershire sauce cos didn't have any on hand. I baked them for about 15 mins, was great because all the oil came out of the patties, so it felt "fairly healthy" gosh absolutely love it. Will make these when my family comes to visit in 2 weeks time.

Surely the 12 ounces of blue cheese for 10 patties is a misprint. i'll cut it back to 4-5 oz when I make them. The blue cheese flavour is best enjoyed in a more subtle context I think.

Basic recipe is good and is mostly the one I use all the time.  Potatoes was new to me but interesting. As far as the blue cheese, if you like blue cheese, use no more than half.  If you have another cream dressing, use that..at half amount.  Think will stick to using Bar-b-q sauce with a few drops of liquid smoke instead

These burgers taste wonderful - moist and flavorful.  However, they don't hold together well at all; they fall into pieces when trying to flip them on the grill.  Still, I'll make them again.

These burgers really are some of the very best I've made.  Be sure to keep the proportions of ingredients exact, though, or they may turn out too moist or the blue cheese flavor may be too weak/strong.

Great burger! I didn't have any blue cheese so I couldn't add that. I used corn meal in place of the bread crumbs. I have 3 kids under 10 and they all loved them. I will absolutely be making these again!

Just made these burgers & dayum were they delish, I just made it in my own way, beef fajita seasoning,garlic salt, black pepper, an egg & the shredded potatoes like u suggested & they were sooo juicy!
