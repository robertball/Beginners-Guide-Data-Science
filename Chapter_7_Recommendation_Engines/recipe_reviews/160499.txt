I thought this was great and pretty easy to put together.  I substituted the hash browns with frozen potato o'brien (the added peppers and onion gave it good flavor).  I also would add a little extra cheese next time.  Overall this was a quick easy recipe.

Good, easy recipe.  I used  a generic brand of sausage and hashbrowns, and 8 large eggs.  However, 450 is far too hot an oven, my rolls were almost too browned to serve.  350-375 would suffice.

I made these for a breakfast gathering at work and they were a hit!  I made them with a dozen eggs instead of the egg substitute.  I must admit they are a tad bland, but I whipped up a dipping sauce that made them spectacular.  Mix one cup ketchup, 1 tbsp mustard, 1 tbsp A1 sauce, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce and 1 1/2 tsp hot sauce.  Serve dipping sauce cold.  The ketchup-y sauce goes really well with the eggs.  Also, instead of brushing the rolls with butter, I coated my hands in vegetable oil and subsequently picked up each egg roll and coated them with the oil before I baked them.  They turned out golden and crispy!

This was perfect replacement to the breakfast egg rolls that they no longer sell at our work.  I used 10 eggs instead of egg substitute.  I sealed the egg rolls with a thoroughly whisked egg.  This yielded about 34 plump egg rolls.  I froze them all, and we pull them out as we want them and deep fry them at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes.  Served with salsa, these are a great hot breakfast.
