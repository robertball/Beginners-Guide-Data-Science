This was pretty good.  I left out the mango as my husband doesn't like them.  The salad is light in flavor and refreshing.  My husband didn't like the salad that much as he has a phobia about eating cold seafood.  Oh well I guess I won't be making this again.

This recipes was great!  I was looking for something that didn't have a cream sauce or cheese and this was wonderful!  It was a cold day when I made it, so I sauteed the peppers, then added the crabmeat and the lime juice and zest.  I served this over rice.  Everyone in the family loved it, and I can't wait to make it in the summer as a salad!

This one was great.  I was looking for something light and tangy but with a kick.  I used less hot pepper and substituted salad shrip(it was on sale).  It was great!  ^The recipie doubles nicely and I tripled the lime dressing-just in case.  I got RAVE reviews on a hot summer day.

All of the ingredients meshed well together except the cumin. It was too strong and did not go with the citrus flavor of the salad at all!!

Made this recipe twice.  Took a few shortcuts - used Del Monte (I think) mango which comes in a jar peeled, sliced, and stored in it's own juice in the refigerated section of the grocery store.  I found this recipe worked best when I made it the day before, and let it sit overnight in the frig.  The flavors really blend together well that way.  This salad was a big hit.  I'll be making it again soon.

This salad is incredible. The fresh mango really makes it. I used fresh ginger instead of powdered, extra cilantro, and a slightly under-ripe mango for extra bite! This would also be excellent without the crabmeat (if you're vegetarian). Yum!

Very good.  For a lighter version, substitute lettuce and shrimp for the pasta and crabmeat.

This recipe sounded fantastic.  However, I completely botched it up.  I tried to use fresh mango, which I have never dealt with before and I had an awful time.  I don't know if my mango's were not ripe yet but they were almost impossible to cut and they tasted extremely acidic.  In fact, the whole recipe once I finished it tasted way too  acidic.  I tried to salvage it by adding extra honey, but it was too late.  I had to throw it all out.

I think this is one of those recipies were you are either going to love it or hate.
  Unfortunatelly no one in my family liked this salad at all.  Maybe because we are used to a mayo based crab salad that we didn't care for this , because we love the citrus & fruit seperately.  We really tried to eat it, but had to throw it away.

I made a couple of alterations.. used whole wheat pasta and frozen mango chunks, defrosted. It tasted really good. A nice light summer salad.. perfect at the end of  a hot day.

We think this is fab.  I've used both frozen mango and canned mango (you have to be careful with canned cause it "smushes" easily) when fresh has been unavailable.  If you don't like the taste of cumin (I looove it) try fresh grated ginger and/or black pepper and/or a dash of chili.  I like a lot of dressing and a lot of veges in relation to pasta so I add plain yoghurt to the dressing and throw in some mizuna and extra cilantro, too.

This rating may be due to the fact that I did not have imitation crab meat and so I used the canned stuff. It's a little less than the recipe calls for, and I'm sure I'd have loved this salad a lot more if it were meatier. So taking that into consideration, I still felt this salad was lacking a little bit of something. It was definitely a pretty dish and visually appealing. Maybe if it had a little more "dressing" or "sauce", I found that my salad was a little dry after refrigerating overnight to soak up the flavors.
I would make this again if I find myself with a bunch of imitation crab meat! But until then, I don't think the work that mangoes require to prep is worth it! :)

This dish was excellent, perfect for a BBQ or light meal and very easily customizable.  My GF has celiac's disease so we used gluten free rotini pasta and it turned out surprisingly well, rinsing the pasts prevented it from having the typical mushy texture that gluten free pasta is known for.

I loved this salad but did not get the quantities.  Next time, I will half the pasta and double the crab.  I will also double the dressing and maybe even triple the lime juice.

I found this recipe here several years ago and have been making it ever since. The only change I have made is using the spiral pasta instead of the rotini, other than that it is perfect!! When I take it to pot lucks, everyone asks for the recipe! Love This Salad!

This was great!  I had to tweak it based on ingredients on hand (substituted crushed red pepper for jalepeno & omitted mango).  I cannot wait to make this with the missing ingredients!  Very refreshing alternative to the heavy mayo salads.

Beautiful and delicious. I used mini bowties and probably would have gone with a more "sturdy" pasta like penne or rotini as suggested. Loved the zing of the jalapeno. It got better the longer it sat. I'm looking forward to having leftovers all week for lunch!

This was Yummy!!! We wanted something refreshing and different. This recipe deliverers! We are big fans of bold flavor, so couldn't resist adding 3 cloves of minced garlic and 3 chopped scallions. I used one pound of spaghetti noodles broken in thirds. Tripled the faux crab. Doubled the dressing, cilantro, and mango. Only used 1/4 teas cumin per others suggestions. Weak tummies, so I went with 1/4 of the jalapeno. I am telling you this is the bomb! THANKS 4 SHARING LEIANE!

I made this with real crabmeat instead of imitation, skipped the jalepeno and added extra lime zest, and loved the result. Definitely add oil to the pasta water to keep it from sticking, as well as rinsing pasta with cold water afterward. Also a very ripe mango is key.  You should feel the mango give under the peel when you buy it, and after you cut the mango into big pieces, the peel should come off relatively easily under your fingers.

One of my all time favorite pasta salads.  Love the bright, sweet, smokey combination and it's the only recipe I like fresh cilantro in.  Always a hit at work potlucks.

Delicious flavour.  I made this and left out any of the actual Carribean spices, as I don't like them.  It was fresh, and delightful for the palate.  A true keeper for the summer months ahead.  I could see adding cooked shrimp to this also if you like it.  Lovely presentation as well.  Mango makes everything a hit!

Tasty and a good alternative to traditional salad dressing based pasta salads.  I don't think the hour in the fridge made any difference.

I've made this dish to take to three dinner parties so far and have received rave reviews.  It's a great summer dish - light and refreshing. It's especially great right now since mangos are in season.  The only thing I changed was I used whole wheat pasta.

Really good recipe. The only thing I would do differently, is make and add more of the dressing.

Will definitely make this again, it was delicious. In fact it was the first time I got my husband to try something this different from his steak and potatoes menu preference. Made n changes.

This was fair.  The cumin over powered the rest of the ingredients.  I let set in the Ref. several hours.  I could not taste the seafood-just the dressing.  I tasted the dressing before adding the ginger and the cumin, and it was very good.  This dressing would probably be good as a topping on baked or grilled fish.

This was a delightfully tasetful salad for a warm summer evening.  Made more than enough for the 2 of us, and leftovers for lunch the next day were even better.  This is a keeper...thanks!

Yummy!  Very fresh tasting.  The husband and kids liked it too.  I will make this often as it gets warmer!

I was really excited about trying this dish, but found myself completely disappointed.  I'm not for sure if it was the mango or the cumin that threw it off for me, but I found the whole thing quite inedible.
