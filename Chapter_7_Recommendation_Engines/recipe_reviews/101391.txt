This was very easy to make and tasty.  I doubled the recipe to feed more but changed the proportions a little - 1/2 c barbecue sauce and 1/3 c Italian dressing.

I had no idea what I was going to do as dinner time quickly approached and I had some mostly thawed out pork chops.  Then I came along this recipe.  It was great!  And it only took minutes to make.  I wasn't sure it was going to be worth anything, but even my picky husband said he wants pork chops that way more often!  The only thing I did differently was to season the chops when I fried them, oh and used a TBS of oil, instead of just a tsp.  I kept them simmering a while longer on low heat and the sauce thicked up a little and was delicious spooned over the chops.  I may even put some fresh green pepper strips and onion in it next time to liven it up even more!  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this again and again...

AMAZING as directed, but I tweaked it a little to suit my taste even more.  I combine 1/2 cup each of bbq sauce and Italian dressing and add 1/2 packet of mild taco seasoning. Marinate in the mixture for at least two hours then cook with oil over medium high heat. SOO GOOD!

make sure when you cover and simmer that you turn the heat down enough so the sauce does not burn
