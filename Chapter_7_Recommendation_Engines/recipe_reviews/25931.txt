Just finished dinner, with this recipe served over jasmine rice -- we loved it!  My husband, and four- and two-year-old sons both devoured it.  I used 2tsp of cornstarch in place of the flour, and half the amount of scallions.  I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I subsituted 1/2 the water with regular orange juice.  Made a wonderful sauce that was perfect atop white rice.   I recommend adding the mandarins just prior to serving -- I cooked them too long, and they disintegrated. No added salt is needed, as the bullion cubes provide more than enough.  This recipe would work really well with beef or shrimp, as well. A definite keeper!

We both enjoyed this dish, over rice as others suggested.  It is very colorful and would be nice enough for a casual company meal.  Easy to do some of the steps ahead (cook the chicken, broccoli, etc) so there is little to do at the last minute.  Heed the advice of a previous reviewer:  don't cook the mandarin oranges. :)

Very good and very easy.  Doubled broccoli & mushrooms, used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken, cooked mushrooms more than recipe said & had to add more butter to pan when mushrooms were done.  Wisked flour w/melted butter before adding 1 cup OJ(skipped concentrate & water).Added onions and broccoli same time as chick & rooms.  Waited until very end to add two cans of Man. oranges (already at room temp).  Just mixed & served over rice.

Easy and quick recipe for a change in chicken preparation.  Instead of using the 1/3 cup of OJ concentrate and 2/3 cup water I used orange juice 100% -- and also added the drained juice from the mandarin oranges.  A bit more sauce would have been desired.  Enjoy!

Excellent flavor, not to sweet, just different enough to make it special.  I don't ever use bullion cubes (MSG) so I used 2 packages of Lipton Cup-a-Soup Cream of chicken instead of the cubes and left out the flour.  Take the advice of others, add the can of orange segments at the very end of the process.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. It was easy and quick to prepare, but not as good as other mandarin chicken or beef I've made. I feel that the addition of canned mandarin orange slices detracted from the dish a great deal.

Although this was an easy recipe, I felt it need a bit more flavor. The flavors were just too mild for my taste. It was ok, not great. The chicken didn't seem to pick up any of the flavor, Maybe season the chicken before cooking. I served it over rice. It was a very attractive dish. I really rate it 3 1/2 stars.

This turned out better than I had expected. Of course I changed a few things (as I do with all recipes)but the base recipe was yummy! I added ground red pepper to my chicken as it sauteed in olive oil, not butter. I sauteed my onion and mushroom before adding the fresh broccoli-raw. Then started on the sauce. I put in about 1/2 tblsp of soy sauce. Served over basmati rice. Will make again, and soon!

I was trying to find a similar recipe that my mom used to make, this one fit pretty well.  Though, I did change a few things.  I left out the bouillon and added between 2-3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce (I love that stuff) to give it a little more flavor.  It's great over rice.

I changed a bunch of things, and my family LOVED it!  Here's what I did:
- Doubled the sauce
- Used more (2 sm. bunches) broccoli
- Omitted mushrooms (I just didn't have any)
- Omitted green onions
- Served over brown rice (yummy!)
- The best thing I did: served it with freshly toasted sliced almonds - YUM!  I had them in a small bowl and everyone sprinkled on as much as they wanted.  I highly recommend them!  They added a nice nutty crunch.

Next time, I will either use less bouillion or a lower sodium variety.

We really liked the combination of most things in this recipe even though my hubby and I thought the orange flavor was a little strong. That being said...I used orange juice instead of the water and concentrate, and I do believe the concentrate would have made it less citrusy and more sweet. I added garlic to the mushrooms. When I try this again I may use cream instead of the OJ. Thanks for the recipe.

Just made this for the family tonight, and it was delicious.  I'm adding it to my list of regular meals.  My only problem is with prep time.  It certainly takes longer than 10 minutes to clean and slice the mushrooms and green onions, plus rinse and cube two pounds of chicken (don't really need two pounds, by the way).  Quantity of sauce is just right.

I really did not like this recipe. My family ate it but didn't seem to enjoy it. I omitted the mushrooms and used 1/3 cup of juice from oranges since I did not have any orange juice.

This was good, not great. The sauce didn't have much flavor. I sauteed in olive oil, instead of butter. I used cornstarch instead of flour (as some reviewers suggested). Served it over rice. I will make this again with some additions to make it more flavorful. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I was looking for something to use up my supply of Christmas oranges, and this did the trick.  Instead of OJ concentrate, I just squeezed two Christmas oranges. Didn't do the mushrooms (allergy) or onions (didn't have any). Overall a good recipe. Would be great over rice.

This was definitely something different.   I am forever looking for new ideas for chicken, because it gets so boring.   However, I feel like it was lacking something... I did not use flour.   Rather, I used cornstarch (as another user suggested).   I just kept adding it until it was the texture I pictured it should be (about 2 tsp). Also, to cut back on the high sodium, I only used 1/2 of a bullion cube, and it tasted fine. I did half OJ concentrate and 1/2 water instead of the measurements provided. It made the orange flavor a little stronger. I also added about a tsp of sugar. I only made 1 1/2 lbs of chicken instead of 2, and increased the broccoli and mushrooms. It made more than enough for my husband, my daughter, and I. I served it over whole grain brown rice to make it a little healthier too. I will probably try this one again...when I am out of ideas. It's easy enough to be a back-up recipe.

Well, i was in a huge hurry, so I used this recipe as a guide.  I did not really measure anything but the liquid ingredients...which I increased due to other reviews.  I used o.j. that was already made which made it less sweet.  (my family turns their noses up at things too sweet with meat in them)  I for got the green onions..darn! I did add about a 1/2 tsp or more red pepper for a bit of a bite and I cooked the chicken with a good heaping tsp of minced garlic. I did make the mistake of adding the oranges too early & they broke apart.  Iwould have liked themn whole but the fam. liked it that they wer undistingishable.  I will keepthis one!

This recipe was frankly awful. Made it for the family, followed the recipe exactly, and none of us could eat it; wound up ordering pizza for dinner. It tasted like someone had poured hot orange juice over what might have been a tasty combination of ingredients. Orange juice and mandarin oranges actually have very different flavors, and those flavors do not blend particularly well. Perhaps omitting the orange juice completely and using a store-bought orange sauce might make it palatable.

Interesting flavor, but bland.  Another reviewer made fajitas out of the leftovers.  Me too.  Wonderful.  Will make again.  
So here are  my notes.  Use 1 cup orange juice and skip the concentrate.  Cornstarch instead of flour.  I bouillon cube.  Definitely wait till the pan cooking is done to add the orange segments. At the end,  mix most of a packet of taco seasoning into the finished chicken mix.  Satrt with 2/3, and keep sprinkling it in to taste.  Scoop some into  large flour tortillas. Add some shredded Mexican cheese .  Fold over, lightly spray with oil, top with some cheese for looks.  Bake in 400 oven for 8-10 mins.  Great dish.  I froze some for later - should do ok.  Hopefully.

Delicious and easy!  Added some sliced bell peppers, a few dashes of sesame oil and soy sauce.  I'll definitely be putting this into regular rotation.

Just made this for dinner. Delicious. I used vegetable bouillon because that's what I had. I also used a half of a yellow onion and sub'd the water and oj concentrate for one cup of reg oj because I only had those on hand. Served with brown rice.

I gave it 3 stars just because it was way too citrusy for me.  Next time I'll cut the OJ to half and maybe add some water chesnuts.

Didn't care for this recipe. I put the oranges in at the last minute, but they still turned to mush. I think this dish needs more flavor.

I made several changes to this recipe after reading all the reviews. To serve, I put a layer of rice on each plate, added the chicken cubes, broccoli and mushrooms on top, and then poured some of the sauce over all. I topped all this with refrigerated, drained Mandarin oranges and toasted sliced almonds. My son stated this was in his top 10 favorite dishes, now!

Easy to prepare but lacked flavor punch! Adapt this to your own taste.
