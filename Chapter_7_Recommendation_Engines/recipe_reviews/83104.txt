I already rated this once before, but I had to write again! So good and so easy. I used plain yogurt mixed with mango chutney as a sauce and served with warm tortillias. Thank you so much. I only used about 3/4 of a teaspoon of each spice... perfect!UPDATE ON REVIEW: I now usually serve with warm whole wheat pita bread and mix the mango chutney with light sour cream....YUM!

Very easy and surprisingly authentic tasting. My husband told me that these taste as good as the kafta (beef sausages) he gets at our favorite Middle Eastern restaurant. We ate them two to a pita with tzatziki sauce. My only complaint was that they were a little dry -- I think I cooked them too long. Next time I will not let them brown so much in the pan or only bake them for four minutes.

We love these!  I mix the spices in early in the day and refrigerate until just before dinner.  It is wonderful to have another low-fat decadance up my sleeve.  Thank you!

Fantastic!  I have made these sausages into patties as well.  I never thought i could enjoy a low fat sausage without bread or egg.  i like to dip these in dijon mustard and eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

We thought this was a great change from "the usual".  I thought before I made them that it seemed like the recipe called for a lot of spices, but we decided after eating the meal that we wouldn't change any of the spices or amounts.  The one thing we did do, was to check to see if they were done after 4 minutes in the oven and they were.  We ate them in wholewheat pitas with Tzatziki sauce, and loved them!  We will definitely make them again!

This had a great taste, but I didn't form it into tubes as directed.  I ended up making this a loose meat sandwich, using pitas and a california style israeli salad from this site.  The seasonings were great.  I would recommend getting in there and using your hands to mix the seasonings in with the meat, I made the mistake of not doing that, and ran into spots of heavily seasoned meat.

This was really good. I used large tsp amounts because I love strong flavours and I made mini loaves and as others suggested, put them in pitas with tzatziki, onions, tomatoes and they were sooo yummy! Thanks! Definitely a keeper. :)

Wonderful!. I followed recipe exactly except for rolling out the meat. Instead I formed the meat around wooden skewers and cooked as per instructions. I served it with a peanut curry sauce and pita bread. The smell of the meat cooking wa great. Spiced/seasoned to perfection.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the directions exactly, using the 1tsp of each spice.  I hand-mixed it into the ground turkey early in the day to allow the flavors to blend.  Even my 10 month old grandson could not get enough!  Great tasting recipe!

Wow, wow, WOW!  I was looking for something a little different to do with my ground turkey last night for dinner and decided to try this recipe.  I was a little leary of it, because I'm extremely new to the idea of using cinnamon in main dishes instead of just in baked goods, so I was concerned by a couple reviews saying the cinnamon was overpowering.  After talking with a couple people on The Buzz, I decided to go for it and make the recipe as-written, except I shaped the meat differently.  I copied the idea of the reviewer who flattened the meat and just fried it (no baking needed, since the flat patties cooked completely through in the frying pan).  I served it on pita bread with Tzatziki Sauce I from here at AllRecipes, shredded romaine lettuce, and sliced fresh tomatoes from our garden.  My daughter, my fiance, and I all agree this recipe is a definite keeper and will absolutely be part of our regular rotation from now on!

This is delicious as is. The hot dog shape is a good idea, but I like to just press the meat mixture into a glass baking pan and bake as a meatloaf- much easier. If I cut it into serving size pieces and refrigerate it, it lasts me all week as a breakfast on the go. Very good with honey mustard dipping sauce.

These are very good and easy to prepare.  I think they take a little longer to cook than the recipe states.  I just check them after about 10 minutes with a meat thermometer and put them back in for a few more minutes if needed.  I have made them several times and have made a few additions according to my own personal tastes but they are still very good when made as the recipe directs.  I grate about 4 T of onion on a cheese grater and add that to the ground turkey (I think this gives them a little more moisture, I do this when I make meat balls and hamburgers too).  I also add about 1/2 cup of wheat bulger (plumped in warm water then drained) this adds a little lightness to the turkey and I think makes them bit more authentic. I up the seasonings just a bit to compensate for the addition of the bulger.  Very good, quick and healthy dish.  One of my favs!

YUMMY!  I made these for dinner tonight and I LOVED them!  I served them in a whole wheat pita with lettuce, tomato, feta cheese, and homemade lowfat tzatziki sauce.  I only used about 3/4 teaspoon of each spice and subbed dried cilantro for the ground coriander because I didn't have coriander on hand.  Absolutely fabulous, and healthy to boot!  I'd make this recipe again in a heartbeat!  Thanks for sharing!

Not bad, the spices were a bit overpowering though. These were good in a hotdog bun or on their own.

Instead of "dogs" I flattened the meat and fried it up pseudo-gyro style.  It was a nice change from our everyday dinners, but the cinnamon was a bit overpowering and it needed more salt.

Different, not bad. Someone suggested 1 tsp per spice was too much - so I used a little less - mistake - lacked flavor. Next time. I'll follow the recipe. Good with Tahini or Spinach dip rolled in pita. Served it with a broccoli salad.

Easy and excellent.  I served these with some yogurt and dill dipping sauce and plain rice.  The rice took longer to prepare and cook than these "Turkey Dogs".

If you are a fan of Middle Eastern food and are short on time and supplies, but not spices, then this is the meal to cook.

These were so easy and so good!  My husband and I are trying to eliminate simple carbs and cook with lower fat meats; I served these turkey dogs over spaghetti squash topped with marinara sauce.  Yummy!!

The recipe is a very good start.  Hubby and I agreed that next time we will make into oblong patties, quickly brown then briefly bake (probably 3-4 minutes).  We too will add more spice, likely a touch of cayenne pepper because we prefer more spice.  Tomorrow night I plan to slice and serve atop a greek salad.  I think it will be really good.   I topped the turkey dogs with the Tzatziki Sauce I recipe which was the perfect compliment.

AWESOME AND HEALTHY This dish is stupendous.  It is easy to cook and if you have a well stocked spice drawer all you have to pick up at the store is ground turkey.  I added diced onions in mine just to spice it up a little more.

My kids absolutely loved this.  I served on oblong shaped naan, so I shaped the turkey into ovals and served with yogurt/cucumber/dill/garlic/lemon sauce.  My kids ate it like a sandwich while my husband stacked everything & used a fork.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were amazing!  I flattened them rather than made tubes, and pan-fried like mini-hamburgers.  Bf had seconds and couldn't stop talking about them.  Served on a thick pita with a yogurt/garlic/lemon sauce.  Maybe could have used some chopped tomato like the gyros.  I'm definitely making these again.

I had to use up some ground turkey, followed this recipe to the "T", and we thought it was pretty darn good.  i don't see why it can't be in hamburger form either.  We liked the combination of spices a lot., thanks for the post.

These are really good!  I made them for some skeptics a couple of weeks ago, and everyone enjoyed them.  Quick and easy to prepare (mix well with your hands) and stayed moist - even left over the next day.  Could use even more spices if you like a kick - not  overpowering as is.  Great way to have some flavorful protein without added fat!

Very yummy! My 5 year-old son ate two of them. I served it on flat bread with tzatziki, hummus and chopped tomatoes. I did put an egg into the meat mix because I accidentally broke one while putting them away. Seemed to hold the turkey together well. I will definitly make this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I bought a package of 1.25lb ground turkey and did patties rather than dogs. Next time I make this (very soon) I am going add a bit more spice to make up for the amount of turkey. My girls 9 & 11 scarfed it down! My hubby is out of town and when he gets home I am going to make this again! Served with sliced red onion, tzatziki, feta and whole wheat pita. Forgot to halve the cherry tomatoes I had or would have thrown those in too! Delish! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious, even hubby loved these! Instead of cinnamon I used chili power and paprika. I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper for some zing! I eye balled all of the spices but I definitely used less than 1 tsp. of ginger -- I didn't want to over power the rest of the ingredients. I served these in a pita topped with caramelized onions and tzatziki sauce.

Made it into little meatballs hoping the kids would eat them with toothpicks, but it wasn't a hit with them.  That just meant more for me!  I will make it again for me and the hubs, but not for the kids until their taste buds grow up.  :)

This smelled good while it was cooking and was easy to make.  They have a tasty, interesting flavor.  I will make it again.  I served it with a avocado,tomato, lettuce salad with feta vinaigrette; and a slice of bread.

These were pretty good but I tried to skewer and grill and they fell apart. I think next time I would grill as patties like a regular hamburger.   Served in a whole wheat pita with red onion, tomato and tzatziki sauce. Yum!

Woah!  I took a bite, dipped into a bit of thick, whole-fat yogurt and I swear, my socks went flying across the room they were knocked so hard!  I cooked mine entirely in a skillet just for ease.  It took longer than the recipe said to get it brown.  It's possible that med. on my stove isn't like the poster's stove.  That said, I also used pork instead of turkey.  I'm finicky about the quality of my meat and the only "all natural" ground white meat I could find was pork.  I'd make this recipe with any white meat and will likely next time serve it with a rich tzadziki instead of plain yogurt.  As a side I ate baked kale chips, also found on this site.  Not exactly authentic, but delicious and satisfying.  This recipe will be making a regular occurrence in this house.  Thanks so much for sharing!  UPDATE:  I had to share that I just ate the leftovers for breakfast.  I only had two left and I don't use a microwave so I ate them cold.  Still FANTASTIC.  I think I'll be making these again next week!  Maybe twice, even.  :-)

I made these twice. The first time I only used garlic and cumin to season the turkey dogs - my husband and i loved it, but the kids didn't like it. The second time I just added garlic and some Italian seasoning and the kids took to it! I only baked the turkey dogs and did not fry them. I placed them on the ends of skewers and my kids loved the idea of having "dogs on a stick!" I will make this again.

I tweaked these just a bit to suit my family's tastes-- I used only about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and added some garlic powder and onion powder.  Also, the package of turkey was slightly larger than one pound-- it was 20 ounces.  I mixed up the meat and spices and let it sit for about 30 mins, then made small patties out of it (hubby said they looked like sliders) and cooked them in a non-stick skillet.  Tasty, especially with some tahini dressing I had on hand!  I'll definitely be making this again-- always looking for a way to eat less red meat and this was *so* quick & easy.

This was a good way to spice up ground turkey.  I served it with honey mustard, tomato, onion, and avocado.  I kept the spice measurements the same but grilled it.  All in all, it was pretty moist and flavorful!

Pretty good.  I liked, but, no one else was that crazy about it.  I love shish kafta & these are kind of like it.  I served the turkey tubes in pita bread (pulled apart so you just roll up everything in one side) with tomato, lettuce, tzatziki sauce & a thinly sliced pickle (like I get them back home).  I would make these for myself again.

The 3.5 and 7 year olds approved it! Pretty good! It does need a little sauce. I used ketchup. Served it with white rice and peas. (I was working with what I had.) Definitely saving to make again!

yum.  these are meant to be spicy, & they are. but if you can,
crack your own whole spices (i crack mine on a napkin on the rug with a hammer, stupid, i know...but it works faster than a 
cheap spice mill) as it really adds to flavor.  Dip in cornbread
batter and deep fry for superior "corn dogs"

I love this recipe. i used lean ground turkey, (not sure of the fat content). the only thing i did differently is added a diced shallot to the mixture. i love the flavours in these. not overpowering. i thought the cinammon might be a little strong, but it was PERFECT! and sooooooo easy to put together. i served mine with lebanese pita, tatziki sauce , lettuce and chopped tomato. YUM. thanks for sharing your recipe curiouskangaroo! :)

This was delicious!  I made it with some quinoa and veggies with the same spices as a side dish and some spicy banana ketchup.  The recipe for the banana ketchup needs a little work but it sure did go amazingly with the turkey dogs!

Pretty interesting.  It's a very middle eastern flavor which might be too strong for Americans unused to such cooking.  I like the idea of patties better than tubes and put yogurt cucumber sauce on.  Actually I think it would even be good with mustard and  sour pickles.

Thanks for the great recipe.  Tried this last night and my husband didn't sound too enthused when I told him what I was making, but he was convinced afterwards.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  Great flavor and something a lot more flavorful to do with ground turkey.  I'm going to make a large batch next time and freeze some for lunches.

My husband and I ate these but didn''t really care for them.  My kids wouldn't touch them.  Lots of remarks about the unappetizing appearance.

This is very good and simple to make.But needs a sweet sauce.
