I had made this from the Kraft magazine last year and we really enjoyed it.  Just right for winter weather coming up, comfort food.  Thanks for submitting it

Good for a quick and easy meal.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which worked well-they were nice and moist.

I found this an excellent and tasty dish. It was easy to bake though I had to extend the time a little bit. But all in all, I liked it and will probably bake it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Most everybody loved this dish at my house.  Served with my grammy's green bean recipe, and garlic bread with spinach dip.  A HIT!

this was pretty good, i felt like it lacked big cheese flavor, which i love. i used chive cream cheese because that was all i had, and it came out good. in the future, i think i would add some grated cheddar cheese to the sauce and probably throw in some celery, broccoli or other vegetables when cooking the chicken

Good meal, nothing fantastic, but plates were cleaned off.  I did use the new philly cooking cream cheese with Italian Spices and Chives and kicked in a few of my own like garlic powder and dill.  I served over Orzo and thought it was overall pretty easy and quick.

I had some chicken breast marinading in Italian dressing, but wanted something cheesy for dinner and found this recipe.  I had to modify slightly since the chicken was in the marinade, but it turned out fantastic.  It hit the spot and we will make this again and again.

I've made this a couple of times from the Kraft magazine. It is quick and easy, and appeals to picky kids. I was happy to find it here so that I could access it faster. Thanks!

This was very easy to make.  I added a bit of white wine to the broth.  Gave it a nice, sweet flavor.  I'll definitely make it again.

Me and most of the family really enjoyed this, love the flavour from the zesty dressing.  We've had it with both mash and rice and both times it was a success.

Yum!  Normally I have a hard time making sauces but this was easy and delicious!  My kids ate every bite and asked for more!  Perfect blend of different tastes, colors and textures!  Will definately make again and again!

This was pretty good - I did serve it over orzo pasta because I thought the sauce would taste very heavy and that the orzo would be lighter than the rice - it was a good choice.  Not sure I'll make it again but was enjoyable.
