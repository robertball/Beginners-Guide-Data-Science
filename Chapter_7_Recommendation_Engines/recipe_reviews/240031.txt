Ahh darn it!  I put all the  Marinade ingredients on raw chicken cubes!  Let it set overnight and Broiled the whole  shebang. Rest of the recipe was the same. Excellent chimichangas. I've been asked to make them again.  I kept them in the toaster oven on warm while I fried the rest. About 3 at a time. That marinade is so so good!!  I don't think I'll change what I did- even though it was wrong.
