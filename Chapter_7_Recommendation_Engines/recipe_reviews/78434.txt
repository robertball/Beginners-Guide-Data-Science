I made this and found it to be wonderful. The only thing I changed was to par boil the potatoes before hand (after reading other reviews that the potatoes were not cooked completely thru). Ended up marinating for about 18 hours as we had a grandbaby born the day in which these were intended.  I Think because they were partially cooked before marinated helped to ensure they soaked up the flavor.  Super Yummy!!!  Took some to the hospital for my daughter and she really liked!!  By the way, beautiful baby boy!!!!

I didn't have time to marinate these, so I just tossed them with all the ingredients, minus the water, and roated them in a baking dish. Delish!

In one word, Fantastic!  I used a few more potato's (enough to fill a lasagna casserole dish approx 9x13) and cubed the potato's about the same size as tater tots.  Followed the spices exactly but did not have time to marinate just covered with foil and baked 1-1/4 hours covered and another 15 minutes uncovered, turned out great and they were even tastier as left overs.  A good recipe to make ahead to avoid last minute prep when you have company.

I loved these! And I didn't even have any wine on hand so just used a wee bit more water and bouillon.  The trick to making these is to cook them long and slow (especially if you don't have time to marinate). Otherwise, yes, they don't have enough time to absorb the flavours.  I suggest 2 hours on 350 and then turn down to 300 (or even lower depending on your oven) for another half hour, taking the lid off for the last 30 minutes. They come out browned and full of flavour! (Greek potatoes are intended to be a little mushy).

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Despite making a special trip to the store to make sure I had all the spices listed, taking the time to marinate, and basting twice during cooking, the result was decidedly bland, except for the overpowering rosemary. I definitely will not try this again.

Love making a dish that can be prepared ahead of time and still turns out to be a pleaser.  Marinated the potatoes the night before, did not pre-cook as some have suggested and didn't think they required it, followed recipe exactly except I doubled it as i was serving 13 people, no leftovers they were devoured. Excellent!!!

I parboiled the potatoes as some others suggested, but ended up over-cooking them and some got a little mushy. I still went ahead and tossed all of the spices in (minus the lemon pepper and rosemary, I put more thyme in instead). I also added 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the Italian salad dressing and garlic and a little lemon juice. (I had to use the zest in something else.) And then I stopped there (no wine or water) because I tasted it and it was delicious. I just ended up serving it as a room-temp potato salad and it was great.

This recipe was very good.  I didn't cook the potatoes long enough, but that was my fault.  I will definately make it again.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I added a little extra lemon.  It was really good anyway.

Marinated for 24 hours and tasted GREAT! Suggest longer cooking time ( I cooked for 2 hours ) or raising temperature to 375 and cooking for 1 1/2 hours.

delicious recipe...i made them to go with the chicken and herbs recipe because many of the spices used were the same, and i was very impressed. I recommend cooking the potatoes for an extra 20-30 minutes to ensure that they are soft. (BASTING IS KEY)

We really enjoyed these.  And I love the fact that they can be assembled the night before, cutting dinner prep time for those busy weeknights.

Made these last night with small new potatoes with the skin peeled only from the middle. Marinated for about 24 hours, the flavor was good but to me there was too much liquid.  I would have preferred them to be more broiled. Still my guests really loved them. Thanks

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I bought all the ingredients from the grocery store and did everything in the recipe, but besides just not enjoying the flavor (I felt the lemon pepper along with the lemon juice was a bit overpowering), I tried cooking the potatoes in my oven on 375 degrees for an hour and a half and they still weren't cooked all the way through.  So I would advise allowing 2 hours to cook, or perhaps turning your oven up to 400 degrees and trying for an hour and a half.  Oh well, I'm still happy I tried something new :)

This was excellent. I was unable to marinate overnight, but I did for one hour. It still came out great.

I agree with others that the potatoes should be par boiled, maybe for 10 minutes or so. Or you can probably even fry them instead for 10-15 minutes or so. Frying might give them a nice crust.

I made the mistake of stirring after they came out of the oven. I should have just left them as they were. It didn't change the taste, but did not present as well. Fortunately, the taste won over.

I am going to try this recipe with just chicken tonight.I am substituting chicken broth for the water and did not have fresh lemons, so used bottled lemon juice instead.

Unbelievable!  I parboiled my potato quarters for 5 minutes first, and then marinated them for about 4 hours.  I won't give any advice on cooking time because mine was a little confusing (we had a ham in the oven as well for the first hour, so the temp wasn't high enough at first - the temp really needs to be in the 400s to get them crisp on the outside like I want them).

The flavours were absolutely perfect.  I added a little extra lemon rind and garlic, and we had no white wine so I used Cinzano.  I found the marinade very forgiving in quantities... we love oregano & basil so I used a looooot more than suggested.

Great ingredients!  Thanks so much for this recipe, it was a huge hit.  I served it with homemade garlic/cayenne/paprika mayonnaise and it was simply divine.

So tender and yummy. I used little baby potatoes instead of medium quartered ones; they were pretty tiny so I didn't cook for quite as long. Also  I gave them a pretty thorough poking with a fork before marinating. I brushed the leftover marinade over some pita wedges and baked them in the oven too, sooo good!

I expected a little more flavour from the potatoes as I did marinate overnight. They were very good though but I did have to cook for a little bit longer than recommended to get them to crisp up properly. But then everybody's oven is different and mine is ancient. Thanks.

These had a very nice flavor, despite my only marinating for about 90 minutes. The only problem I had with this recipe was the cooking time. I cut the potatoes into 16 pieces each and roasted them at 400 degrees, otherwise following all directions. The potatoes were still not done after the suggested cook time. They took an extra 15 minutes to cook through.

Nice simple recipe.  I didn't have fresh lemon so used RealLemon juice so also did not have the lemon zest. We are also not wine drinkers so I had no white wine and used chicken broth. I usually do not like Rosemary but I don't like when someone changes the recipe then comments on it so I added.  It really tasted great - would use the rosemary again when I make.  I did not have the time listed to marinate so I parboiled the red potatoes as had be recommended by others then marinated as listed for about 2 1/2 hours cooked in the oven at 350 then increased to 450 to brown and finish off as I was pressed for time.  Great flavor.  Combine this with the souvlaki recipe by Abby Benner on this site (recipe is for pork but I will try with chicken also) for a great Greek meal  - both recipes use a lot of the same ingredients so makes prepping easy.  A keeper - different from our normal roasted potatoes

I baked the potato's for the called for 75 Min's but they came out a little tough. May have to add another 10 or 15 Min's to the baking time or par boil before baking next time.

It was great, I didn't want to bake them, so slow cooked them for 2 hours on low. Flipped them, and cooked for another 2 hours and they came out perfect.  I didnt quarter the potatoes, I peeled and sliced them in half.

I thought they were pretty good but alot of flavor which is always a good thing.I just dont think it was my favorite taste. I even left out some of the Rosemary because I dont care for that spice to much. I think it had to do with my taste.

I loved these potatoes. Like others stated, I didn't have much time to marinate the potatoes but I covered them until the last 10 minutes in the oven and they turned out very tasty. I also added a little kosher salt to help bring out the other flavors.

I did only a portion of the recipe using four medium-sized red potatoes a little parboiled and cut in slices.  I added a little extra salad dressing and omitted the water.  This took an hour and a half to bake, and we really enjoyed the results.  Hubby especially loved these potatoes.  This MyPlate recipe will be a repeat!  Thanks!

Made changes here too.  Didn't have marjoram, wine or dressing.  I went heavy on the lemon and that was the predominant flavor.  Cooked at 400 for 45 minutes.  Enjoyed the texture alot.  Will make again with Italian flavors.

These turned out terrific. I think you could adjust the amount of seasonings to your own preference but I liked the flavor they had. Used new red potatoes, more olive oil and garlic.

Loved these potatoes and make them for Greek night. The flavour is amazing. I didn't parboil them as others suggested, just cooked them a little longer.  Worthy of far more stars!!! Thanks Maddie.

These potatoes were excellent.  I used 5 lbs regular size Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced thick and place them in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I also used more garlic than called for, just because we like it.  I baked them for 1 1/2 hours covered with foil and then took the foil off for the last 1/2 hour.  I didn't add the water.  The lemon and zest made them taste so fresh.  I served them with chicken, but these would be excellent with fish or shish kabobs on the grill.  We'll definitely be having these again.

Husband loved but really way to hot for me.  Next time no pepper flakes.  Took over the flavor of other seasonings I thought.

this was so incredibly tasty.. i didn't take the time to marinate it.. used 9 little yukon gold potatoes in place of the 6 medium potatoes.. used half the olive oil.. forgot the lemon zest.. left out the water.. added 8 oz of button mushrooms b/c they were on their last leg.. use it or lose it.. didn't quite take the hour 15 minutes to bake.. but we covered with foil the whole way through.. served with Spicy Italian Pork Cutlets and Sauteed Swiss Chard with Parmesan Cheese (both on this site).. ty so much for this recipe

I really like the flavor in these potatoes. I did marinate them all day long and cooked them, covered, at 400 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then I removed the foil and continued to cook them until they were done, about 15 more minutes.

This was good, I just thought it needed a little more salt. But when I make again, I'll add maybe a half to a teaspoon of salt.

I found I had to cook the potatoes much longer than indicated in the recipe, and when they finally were cooked, they came out rather flavorless.  I certainly will NOT make this recipe again.

I only added 1 tsp of lemon pepper(not 2tsp), I left out the wine and used chicken stock instead of water, 2.5- 3 tbsp of  bottled lemon juice , and 1 large clove of garlic.
