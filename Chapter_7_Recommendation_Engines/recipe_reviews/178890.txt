This recipe caught my eye just before
Thanksgiving 2010, when I was determined to find something completely new and completely delicious to whip up for the holidays at my parents' house.  As fate and a chaotic supermarket trip would have it, “Blueberry” became “Blackberry.”  Nevertheless, the Chill, blue, black, red, or yellow turned out to be a crowd pleaser.  Easily made and proudly claimed… this dessert became my go-to dish for several events on the special occasion calendar.  Blueberry, or in my case, Blackberry Chill is the ultimate frozen treat… I dare you to serve it at a dinner party and get through the evening without hearing “how refreshing,” at least three times.  Love it!

I made it for the first time to bring to work.  So far, I have had to email the recipe to 5 different people because they all loved it - as did I and the person I made it for.  Very easy/very good - a great combination!

This is yummy. I have been making a similar simple kind of pie. instead of the cream cheese part I use vanilla pudding. after it cools in fridg I add the blueberry topping. I have been making it since I was a kid.
