If you like a very dense and fudge like brownie this is it. Personally, I am more of a cake brownie person. However, I know most love this type. I was surprised, but there is a hint of banana taste. Donâ€™t make this if craving brownies quickly either.I had to let it set up for 2 hours, as suggested, before cutting. I even put it in the fridge overnight. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 pan. It took 1 hour to bake at this size.
