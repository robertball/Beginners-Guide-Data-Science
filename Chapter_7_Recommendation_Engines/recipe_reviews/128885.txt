This was excellent, it is very similar to the black-eyed pea salad that I order every time I go to my favorite restaurant.  I have been trying to pinpoint the ingredients for ages, I never would've guessed a pinch of cumin was the secret weapon!!  I also loved the combo of vinegars...balsamic alone is just too much for me.  I forgot to get a jalapeno pepper and didn't care to add bacon, but otherwise followed this recipe to a T, and it was VERY VERY good.  I rarely give 5 stars, but having this in my arsenal has made my day!!!

I took this to a pot luck last night and everyone loved it. With black eyed peas selling at $1.49 a can, I decided to make my own peas in the slow cooker the day before (they were $1.49 a bag!). I put them in the refrigerator overnight and drained them the next day to make the salad. I used cilantro in place of parsley.   Yummy!  Absolutely yummy!

AMAZING! This stuff is so good. i followed the recipe exactly, and it was eaten quickly. we keep it in our fridge to eat with chips and even in fajita tortillas for a light meal. let marinate at least overnight, it gets better and better the longer it sits.

This was a wonderful addition to our New Year's lunch and a creative way to serve black-eyed peas. Instead of using it as a salad, we served it as an appetizer with tortilla chips. My brother returned to our house later in the day to see if we had any left -- it was that good!

To make it a little healthier, I substituted a cup of lowfat italian dressing in lieu of the olive oil and vinegars and omitted the bacon.  Also substituted fresh cilantro for the parsley because that is what I had on hand.   This recipe gets better over time, so plan to make it at least 24 hours in advance.

Fabulous! I was looking to recreate the black-eyed pea salad served at our local BBQ joint -- this is it! My only tweak was to use jarred jalapenos, no yellow pepper, and extra cumin ('cause I LOVE it!) I agree with other reviewers -- make it at least a day ahead, because it gets more fabulous the longer it sits!

This is a great recipe! The only changes I made were to use a bag of dried black-eyed peas and an orange and a yellow pepper instead of red. This salad has just the right amount of spice to satisfy spice lovers but not overwhelm your more cautious friends. When I got home late and hadn't eaten dinner, I found myself eating way more of this than I should have, but then I reminded myself how healthy it is and kept eating!

Really good!  Followed the recipes exactly and marinated for about 6 hours.  The cumin really is the secret ingredient in this recipe!  My 3 year old loved it too.

I've made this salad twice now, and each time everyone went back for more, and wanted to know how to make it!  I omit the garlic because I'm alergic, and it tastes great without it! :)

I was trying to duplicate a salad I had in Gatlinburg, TN.  I made this one and while it did not taste the same, it was simply outstanding!  Rather than use a yellow and red pepper,  I used a large orange one instead and added some cut cherry tomatoes.  I also left out the bacon and jalapeno peppers because I had none on hand.  Other than those changes, I followed the remainder of recipe as written. I CAN NOT wait till tomorrow to taste it!  It is SOOOOO delicious now, I can't imagine it being better tomorrow!!  I definitely plan to make this again but WITH the bacon and jalapeno chilies.  This one is a keeper!! 


UPDATE 5/17/2018:  Made it with jalapenos but it was too hot for me, so the next time I used banana peppers and that worked for me.  It was a HUGE HIT at a birthday party that I brought it to. 


Also tried it with bacon and didn't care for the bacon, but that's just me.  Regardless, this is still one of my favorite dishes to bring to cook outs and pot lucks.  It always disappears. =9

Healthy, simple, vinegary, and delicious.  I doubled the cumin because I love it so much & dry roasted it in a pan before adding it to the salad to release a bit more flavour.  A great side dish, or a healthy lunch.  Thanks for posting!

I loved this salad! The two different vinegars and the cumin gave this a fabulous flavor. I just ate it as a salad, but I can definitely see it as a dip with tortilla chips at a barbecue.

Followed the recipe exactly except only used 1 lred bell pepper. (Between the parsley, beans, and red bell, the dish was colorful enough so I saved some money and elimiated the yellow bell.) Recipe was easy and good but I wouldn't say it was awesome. The bacon can be eliminated; it only adds fat and calories. It didn't add any taste to the dish. I will make it again because it was so easy .

This is a great side or dip with tortilla chips. I prefer to let it marinate overnight to get even better flavor.

The longer it sits the better it gets. I made it without the bacon and adjusted the recipe by adding a tad more salt to compensate

Absolutely love this and it's so easy!! Used coconut oil instead of olive oil, omitted bacon and used fresh black eyes peas. Soaked beans over night and cooked. If you cook your own just make sure to turn them

I made this without the bacon, and it was great!  It makes a lot though.  Unless you're going to a potluck, I recommend making a half-batch.

As this is primarily a Southern dish, and we live up North, I miss this salad when I am home.  We go to Florida in the winter, and I can’t wait to get it at our favorite restaurant.  This recipe, made exactly as described  far surpassed my favorite restaurant version.  My spouse said it was the best he ever tasted. I’ll be making this for my friends in PA and Florida.

As a caterer, I use Allrecipes as my “go to”research site. We live in a farming area, and one of our clients is a bean Co-op. For their annual dinner we alway prepare black eyes. Most people, even growers, feel the black-eye has a distinct taste, not always pleasant. This salad was raved about at the dinner, and even growers who don’t normally eat them, came back for seconds! This recipe will definitely stay in my files!!

I halved this recipe since I was making it for only my husband and myself. We had plenty for two days as a side dish with Oven Fried Catfish and a bit left over.  I didn't change anything but if I make it again I will use a little less vinegar; it was a bit too acidic for my taste but nonetheless delicious and I will make it again.

This is an excellent side dish even without the bacon, which I will try another time.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was quick to put together, used ingredients in my pantry and fridge and turned out great. I'm sure it will taste better after marinating overnight. This is a great warm weather side dish that would complement a variety of main dishes.  It would be easy to change it up by using different kinds of beans and substituting different add-ins in the mixture, like celery, corn, black olives, cilantro or mint.  You can really use your imagination for this dish!

I was trying to find a black eyed pea salad recipe similar to my mom's, and this was even better than hers.  

I skipped the jalapenos only because my family is not into spicy food.  Instead of bacon, I used cod fish because that's what my mom used to make hers especially around Christmas time.  So I bought 1/2 lb of cod fish (the salted kind), soaked in water overnight to get rid of the salt, pulled it apart in small pieces (uncooked), and mixed with the rest of the salad.

I made it without the bacon to be vegetarian, but I still think it's excellent.

So good! I used half black beans and half blacked eyed peas. Suggestion: double it!! Add more hot peppers if you like some kick.
