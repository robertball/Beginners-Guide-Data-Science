Great recipe!  Made it twice, couldn't find the stew vegetables so I got bags of peas and carrots.  I now know where to get the stew vegetables so I will try that next time.  The only other thing I changed was adding a can of tomatoes along with the tomato sauce.  Will definitely make again!

I used half an onion, not a full one and the only thing I can taste is the coconut oil. Next time I'll add more onion, less oil. Other than that, very easy and quick.

Tasty soup. I liked the addition of the frozen stew vegetables.. never used this blend before. The first night, this was really quite onion-y.. between the onions in the broth and the onions in the stew blend, it was a lot.  The next night it mellowed some, so that was good.  I blended this up and served it cold as well... I liked it that way too
