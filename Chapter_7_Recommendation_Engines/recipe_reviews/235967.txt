I had a lot of kale to use and found this pesto recipe. I added more garlic and a full cup of basil. It was a bit dry so I added a 1/4c of water and another 1/4c of olive oil. It turned out perfect!

Not going to make it again.  Kale flavour is too strong, overpowering the great pesto blend.

I had a bunch of kale on hand and wanted to find something to use it up on. This pesto was pretty good. It's a bit intense in flavor, but a nice change to usual pesto I make. The walnuts were good with this recipe too. Definitely tastes "healthy". I shaved some Parmesan on top to give it a bit extra flavor and saltiness to the pasta.
