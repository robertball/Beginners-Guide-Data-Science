Great recipe!  First time I made this exactly as written and really liked it!  [Cooked it until it started to 'brown' - YUM!]  Second time I added soy sauce to the mixture for a little different flavor... and again really liked it!  Next time I think I'll add a little vinegar for yet a different flavor.  Love this recipe because it's so versatile!

I used green cabbage since that was what I had.  I sliced the cabbage in fine ribbons and sliced the onion in similar fashion.  I like the flavor boost from the peppers

Great way to cook cabbage! Add a little sesame oil in place of olive oil and add soy sauce. Delicious!

This was so easy and delicious!  We used red cabbage, as recommended.  Also added a bit of garlic pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used green cabbage (what I had on hand) and added garlic. Also, I lowered the amount of olive oil to saute the vegetables but added a pat of butter at the end of cooking. Will try with red cabbage next time.

Yummy! Followed others suggestions and added garlic, carrots for more color and scallions because I had no onions!

I used green and white cabbage as it's what I had available. I put a bit of fennel seeds in the oil to fry a bit before adding veg. When almost done I sprinkled a pinch of brown sugar and a dash of vinegar. Cooked a bit longer to get some brown bits and sprinkled a little celery seeds over (Celery seeds go great with cabbage) in addition to the salt and pepper.

I found this to be a great base for a cabbage recipe. I had cabbage, but not the peppers. So I added the onion and 2 cloves of garlic, paprika,and a little cumin, salt & pepper to taste. Sorry, I never measure, just add what looks good.

I absolutely love this recipe! So colorful and flavorful.  I used green cabbage and served with Balsamic White vinegar.  I have sauteed cabbage and onions before but never thought of adding the peppers.  They are a delightful addition.

When the husband says it turned out great, then I know I'm in the loop. He ate it the next day as well.

Surprised at how tasty this turned out! Used the green cabbage I had, plus red onion and yellow pepper. Sautéed in olive oil with splash of sesame oil. Added almonds to mix. Easy & good! Since it only uses 1/2 head of cabbage, I’ll make ramen noodle cabbage salad too!

Took a little longer for the cabbage to soften. It was a great side dish with a sirloin steak.

Just wanted a simple way to prepare the cabbage/brussel sprout mix from Trader Joe's.  This was easy and delicious.  I even added some yellow pepper but I'm sure if I didn't have it on hand it still would have been great.

I used this recipe as a guide. I started with sautéed butter with onion and shallots. I added thin sliced mushrooms and cooked for a few minutes longer. I then added finely shredded cabbage and cooked for a few more minutes. The butter gave the hearty veggies a good flavor. I served it as a base for stuffed chicken breast.

I was looking for a simple warm cabbage recipe. This

I tried this a few times with green cabbage recently and I loved it. Makes a great side dish. I added garlic and some nice green onions. the one thing I do differently is I add a little olive oil to coat the mixture and stir fry in a little water.

Yes, it was fast and easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.
