Following the recipe exactly, I could only fit 1 cup cream into pan.  Also, even after being refrigerated, remained very runny.  Perhaps I had used to ripe of peaches, thus producing more liquid.  I will try again as it is a very easy, and tasty recipe.

Very easy to make, but of course it's a bit runny so put it in the fridge a while before serving.

This is a weird one.  I only used 4 peaches, medium to large sized, and I could barely fit a cup of cream in there!  It was tasty, though.

The recipe turned out like peach soup.  But tasted fabulous!  Of note, I received a similar recipe from my grandmother a while back, using corn starch instead of flour. Rather than slicing the peaches, she would cut them in half and put them in the uncooked pie shell face up. Then she would stuff the gaps between the halves with any remaining peaches cut into chunks.  The recipe works every time when I make it this way.  And it tastes quite differentâ€”the sugar, cream and juices become firmer, like a custard, and the flavor is much fresher!  Mmmmm!
