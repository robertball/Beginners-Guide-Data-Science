We loved this!! I had an 8 lb. turkey breast and wanted to cook the whole thing, so I used a whole lemon, the lemon pepper and garlic powder.  After squeezing the lemon juice I stuffed the 2 cavities with the lemons and sprinkled the lemon pepper and garlic all over.  Then cooked the breast at 300 for about 5 hours.  It was delicious!!!  Just used the broth to make gravy and everyone raved!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was okay. I like that it is a very healthy recipe. I used a 2-1/2 lb. boneless, skinless turkey breast (aka "turkey london broil" in some supermarkets). Just make sure that if you use a boneless breast, you don't overcook it; it will cook up much faster than a bone-in breast. My kids and husband ate it up enthusiastically. I guess for me, I would like a bit more flavor. I plan to experiment with this and see if I can add something to it. I will try it again; it just wasn't my favorite.

This method of using the slow cooker yielded an incredibly moist and delicious turkey! I had a 7.5 lb bone in breast. I didn't cut it in half, i just seasoned it (on the skin and underneath) and placed the lemon in the cavity. Since it was larger than the size of the breast used in the recipe, I slow cooked the turkey on high for 7.5 hours before the pop-out timer popped. It was WELL worth the wait! Thanks so much for this easy, delicious recipe!

very tender, the lemon can overpower the turkey. Next time I'm going to use the prepackaged gravy to help.

maybe I overcooked it, but the turkey and gravy were very bitter tasting.  I was able to use the turkey, but threw out the gravy and made a packet.

We have food allergies in my family, so this worked out spectacularly for Thanksgiving this year.  I agree, though, don't overcook it.  I knew I left it in the crockpot a little longer than I had planned.  It got a little dry; however, it kept a really good lemony flavor!

This was OK...I probably could have made it better, but it turned out a little too lemony for our tastes.  Also, I cooked it as directed in the slow cooker and the turkey came out pretty dry.  The gravy was the only saving grace. I'll try again, and maybe back down from the lemon a bit.

I found it to be pretty much inedible –– the sauce was very bland except an extreme bitterness, perhaps from too much lemon, to the point that I couldn't enjoy it. (My boyfriend could eat it with a lot of hot sauce, but he eats everything.)

I think it would be improved if only half a lemon was used, plus the addition of some honey and a fresh herb like parsley or rosemary.
