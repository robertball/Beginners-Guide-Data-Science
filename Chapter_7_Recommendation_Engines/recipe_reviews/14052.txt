Excellent!  Tastes like pickled greenbeans- a delicious side for sandwiches.  And, much better when left to marinate for a few days.

These are great!  Been making them all summer long, and the grandkids just love them as well as the rest of the family. They all enjoy just snacking on them especially the grandkids. Thanks for the recipe Christine.

This is a fine basic recipe (don't rush the marinade time -- it'll be worth it in a week!), but I just had to play with it. For a great warm-weather side dish, halve a good number of grape tomatoes, add crumbled feta cheese and toss. It's a pretty -- and pretty tasty -- green/red/white salad.

Delicious!  Pickled green beans, essentially.  I made this over a week ago and forgot about it.  Found it today and was worried it wouldn't be okay.  It is!  Nice and vinegary--just how I like it.  Thanks!

Delicious. I made the batch without red pepper flakes, and just sprinkled them over Husband's serving. Good stuff. Thanks, Christine!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and these beans are delicious! Of course I had to try them after one day but they are definitely best after marinating a week.  I was fortunate to find the little tender french green beans.

I followed recipe exactly except used dried mustard instead of mustard seed and this is a great side dish, cold marinated green beans (from the garden!) and they were very flavorful, yum!!

This is a fantastic way to prepare green beans! I made them for Thanksgiving instead of the "traditional" Green Bean Casserole, and no one missed the casserole! I didn't have any leftovers, so I had to make another batch just for my family! Great for meals, or even just snacking!Thank you for sharing!

These were good. I wasn't expecting them to be as sweet as they were. I would recommend only cooking the beans for about 3 minutes instead.

Delicious. How long can they be safely refrigerated?
