This recipe is worth every single calorie!  Yes it is rich and sweet, but you also don't have to use as much as other toppings to get extreme flavor. It took me back to sitting at the fountain counter at Sanders as a kid.  Thanks so much!

Tastes REALLY rich, however not sure it's worth all the calories contained in it. Might try this again, not too sure. Jazzy

So yummy!  I have made this and put in jars to give as gifts.  Put it together with other ice cream items for a cute gift theme gift.

I have been making this hot fudge since the mid 70's.  I found it in a Detroit newspaper.  It is delicious. So easy now that I melt the caramel with the milk in the microwave. One minute at a time and stir till melted. Add the chocolate after caramel melts and when that melts add the ice cream and vanilla. I use my immersion blender to stir in the ice cream.  It makes 4 half pint jars.
