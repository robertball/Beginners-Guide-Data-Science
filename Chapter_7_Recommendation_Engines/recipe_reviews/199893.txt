I made this for my boys this morning to have over pancakes. I had a couple ripe bananas that needed to be used. I cut this down to 6 servings, which was enough for my two boys. They loved it. Loved. I served it over oatmeal pancakes. There was nothing left on the plate and I think had I not taken their plates, they would have hoover-ed the remains.

This is very sweet, but still very good.  I was trying to impress my grandson, who loves french toast.  I made peanut butter sandwiches (no butter), dipped them in egg, fried them as usual, and then topped them with this sauce.  I thought my grandson was going to burst.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great syrup for a banana fritata recipe I found on this site.  I would love to find one that is a little thicker than this recipe but this was really good and easy to make.

Very good and very sweet.  Next time I will cut back a bit on the sugar or syrup.  We put it on Belgian waffles and it tasted great!

This was so yummy!! I made it exactly as directed and I also served it over oatmeal pancakes. Each "serving" really only covers one pancake, so make sure you take this into account before you scale it down. Also, make sure you don't cook too long after the bananas are added or they will just mushy. Just cook them long enough to heat them up.

I made this for one person using one slightly ripe banana and 1/3 of the ingredients. I added a splash of vanilla extract and served over two gluten free pancakes--my uncle LOVED it! He said it was like something served at a fancy restaurant.  Two pancakes, 1 serving of this banana topping, and a few sausage links...delicious!  My aunt and I ate it over pancakes with gluten--I wouldn't change a thing. A definite keeper that impressed!  Thanks for sharing!

As pancake topping for the 3 of us, I cut the butter, sugar, and syrup in half, but still use 3 bananas.  I simmer for a little longer until the bananas are soft.  Make sure you use really ripe bananas for a lot of  flavour.

This is delicious and very simple to make. I put these bananas on oatmeal pancakes. The pancakes didn't turn out well, but with this sauce, no one cared. I will be making this sauce again.

This was a nice, different way to dress up our usual pancakes.  After reading the reviews, I used half the amount of brown sugar which was plenty sweet enough for us.  While this isnâ€™t my favorite topping, it was a nice change of pace.

Super sweet, I cut the recipe in half and used three bananas, but it was too sweet.  We used it on vanilla ice cream, and it was good.

Just made this with pancakes and we all loved it. What an easy but flavorful sauce! I added a touch of vanilla extract but it wasn't really necessary. Delicious!

WAY to sweet.  Did not like at all.  Pancakes were better off with just sliced bananas and maple syrup the normal way.

It makes a real thick result. I think I may try reducing the bananas to one and a half to make it more "syruppy." That way it pours better and is less of a banana jelly.

After trying 1.5 bananas and 3/4 cup syrup, I got the consistency that I wanted. You can spoon it or pour it! A big hit in our house.

Poured this over some vanilla bean ice cream along with whipped cream and it tasted like Carvelâ€™s bananas Foster sundae dasher. All that was missing was the crunchy stuff (forgot what it is exactly, maybe crushed vanilla cookies) they add.

Disclaimer: I have a sweet tooth.  If you do not, then this recipe isnâ€™t for you - It is sweet.  Nothing like some Banana Foster French toast on Sunday morning! 



As the recipe is written, itâ€™s perfect as a liquidy syrup.  The taste is excellent.  I personally prefer more of a compote that is thicker and a little chunkier.  To accomplish that, I added a little over a tsp corn starch to thicken it a tad without altering flavor.  I also sliced bananas somewhat thin and simmered 1-2 minutes longer so they fell apart more to make it chunkier.  

Iâ€™ve made it with both apples and bananas and itâ€™s always a crowd pleaser, especially with Kids that like sweet things.  If you wanted to tweak flavor a little, you could add rum (real or extract), vanilla, and nutmeg but itâ€™s really good as written.

I needed to use up five BLACK bananas and didn't want to turn on the oven (100 degrees outside!) This recipe looked promising. . . I followed it except to add all five bananas, mashed. It IS very sweet, and mine was over-the -top banana-y (what would I expect?) I added more cinnamon on a whim (1 T) and tested it over vanilla ice cream. Really good.

This is one of the first "recipes" I've tried, and I like it because it was quick and easy to make. It's very sweet, which is exactly how I like it, but I would understand the people who said it was too sweet. I put the bananas on my crepes and it was DELICIOUS!

I made banana blueberry pancakes for breakfast today and had two more over ripe bananas so I decided to make this sauce. It was AMAZING. I actually used my immersion blender to purÃ©e the bananas and the sauce thickened really nicely that way.  Will definitely make again.

What a great way to "dress up" maple syrup!  I followed the directions exactly, and we loved it.  I'm thinking I might try the syrup with sliced peaches or apples next time, because the syrup was pretty good by itself, before adding the bananas.  Yummy!

It was just too sweet.  Will definitely try again using less sugar.

Loved this recipe!  I fried banana slices in butter before adding them to the sauce.  I did not simmer long after adding the bananas because they started getting mushy.  I served it over pancakes and it was a hit!

I made this using Guanabana which is a tropical fruit found here in Costa Rica similar to the consistency & flavor of bananas. I served it over Banana Bread Pudding and it was a huge hit with a group of 15 travelers. They licked their plates! I will definitely make this again.
