Seriously, this is the real deal. Just the way Mom used to make it when we lived in Japan. Don't try to substitute dried ginger because it just doesn't give you that bright hit of fresh ginger flavor. And when you do the cornstarch thickener, make sure your water is cold when you mix it in. Thanks for a good recipe, Bob!

The best sauce I've made so far and the whole family loved it.  I like the boldness.  The one thing I haven't yet conquered is getting it to be less salty.  Adding more sweetness isn't the answer as it's then too sweet and too salty. I'd make this again.

I made this and used this as both a marinade for steak and dipping sauce (thickened as directed)  and hubby loved it.  Next time I would just thicken the whole batch and use some for dip and some for marinade.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Not a bad recipe, but the reason this comes out way too salty is most people will use common soy sauces used for seasoning (like kikkoman from a sushi joint).  Instead try using an all purpose shoyu (soy sauce) meant for cooking; not usually carried in your average U.S. grocery store, it's considerably less salty.  Unfortunately it really doesn't work with your typical kikkoman sauce available to most markets.

Robster...and anyone that wants a less salty teriyaki sauce...there is a lower sodium soy sauce put out out by Kikkoman that helps.  Unfortunately you may still find it high because of the nature of the beast (soy sauce) so to speak.  Kikkoman is my favorite brand I admit (it's what I grew up on) and I really like the lower sodium version as it retains the original flavor.  I can't speak for any other brand.  You can certainly try and find others that are lower.  Good luck and hope this helps...with Kikkoman it has a green bottle cap.
