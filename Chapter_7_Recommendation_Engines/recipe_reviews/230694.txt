love this recipe! easy to substitute vegetables or pasta for your taste!  I reduced ground meat to 1 pd and added 1 pd mushrooms which gave a more earthy flavor, reduced sodium by using 2 cups broth and 1 1/2 cup water, same great flavor!

Used all veggies as recipe called but unfortunately cut the garlic in half. Found it better with added garlic salt. Will learn next time to keep garlic as indicated or even more. Didn't have cherry tomatoes so used 2 whole tomatoes cut up. Also added 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro, white pepper, & a bit of italian seasoning. Made a huge skillet full so looking forward to leftovers.

I tried this recipe as written. Even though I use quality turkey, the end result was a "bleh" taste with a unpalatable texture.  I think this recipe would do better without meat or perhaps leftover chicken, rather than ground.  I'm going to keep this recipe and give it a tweak with zucchini and some onion added for a meatless version.

I added about a half cup to a cup more chicken stock into the turkey after it browned and definitely added more garlic. I also added a couple pieces of bacon, cut into small slices to brown with the turkey. While stirring in all the ingredients, I added feta, which everyone loved! Thanks for this great recipe. It was super easy and a great way to use orzo!  This was a sure hit in my household!

It was pretty good, but what made it was putting a fried egg on top of our serving.  I won't make it again.

Light and tasty dish for a warm summer evening.   Omitted the peas since my spouse doesn't care for them.

I made this to have our family try something different....WE ALL LOVED IT!! We used fresh, not frozen....Switched out carrots & peas for yellow squash & zucchini....I saut√©ed all the veggies (except spinach) w/a little bit of extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt & pepper before I put them in. my hubby & picky 18 yr old son went back for seconds!!!

I want to start by saying that I think this is an amazing base recipe that can be changed up in so many ways to suit personal preference! I used all fresh veggies instead of frozen, and cut up roma tomatoes instead of whole cherry. Mine came out soupy, and I'm guessing its because the fresh veggies had more water content than frozen. Next time, I'll reduce the broth by a cup (I generally try to cook with fresh veggies). Its bland as is and definitely needs seasoning, but a couple teaspoons of your favorite blend instantly takes it to 4 stars.

So good! Made this tonight for my fella to try something different. Just added extra garlic, and only used the ground turkey, regular tomatoes, black olives, a little olive oil, broccoli, and a good amount of salt and pepper.  Definitely a hit, and will be great cold for lunch!

Everyone loved it. I used fresh shredded carrots & broccoli.  The table added soy sauce and hit-sweet sauce making it Oriental!

Loved it!! I used homemade shredded rotisserie chicken.. It was lovely ... Maybe could have cooked the orzo less - but that is a personal preference to how I like my pasta. Yum!
