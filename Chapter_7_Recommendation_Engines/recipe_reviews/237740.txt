Not particularly inspired or creative, but quite good just the same.  As the Japanese steak houses do, I gave this a a plop of butter and a squeeze of lemon to finish. Oh...and I used FAR less soy sauce than specified; just a few shakes'll do ya.

I used all I had in the fridge which was not the same as it called for, however it was great with just the garlic, soy sauce and sesame seeds . Use green onions, cabbage, peppers, broccoli and mushrooms.

Drizzled soy sauce rather than 1/4 cup and it was terrific

This recipe was quite yummy. We ate it with rice. I wouldnt add the onion next time or if i did i would only use half and chop it up small. I didnt pre-cook the broccoli or snow peas as we like our veggies with more of a crunch. Though i did stir fry it for a lot longer then 2 min. I really liked it!

I did not have snow peas so replaced with carrots that I found in the fridge.  Works with many types of veggies!

Good recipe. I used up a few extra peppers that I had on hand.
Also used a bit less onion than the recipe called for.
I used a combo of low sodium soy and a teriyaki sauce.
I will make this again.

I made it, but it was missing something. Same as with making it without the garlic. The garlic covered up most of it but there was still something missing. Maybe ginger?

For something as simple as this, it was filling and quite good. As written, the recipe is just good, not great. But it’s so easy to make your own. I’ve been making this recipe for years now and every time it’s slightly different.  My base recipe is this exactly like this one except I use 2 scrambled eggs, red pepper flakes and a bit of fish sauce. We serve in rice and add meat if we have it.

I cut the sesame oil back to 1 tbs,  and it still was overpowering. Step one says to blanch the broccoli and snow peas and step two has you adding them to the wok at different times? Before serving I tasted the dish and it needed something so I added 1 tsp of rice wine vinegar. I probably won't make this again.

Was too salty for us, I would cut back on the soy sauce.  I will fix it again, just adjust for the salt (and I like salt).

It was only okay, I liked the sauce from a different recipe better and will use that next time.

Ya it's a good basic recipe. Add some sweet and spicy sauce to your individual bowl, delish.

It's pretty good! I made it without the sesame oil (because I forgot to buy it when I was shopping) and I made some rice to mix in with it. tasted like it was missing something... maybe next time I should use the sesame oil

I found this to be a little bland, I ended up adding oyster sauce to give the dish more flavour.  A healthy dish from a vegetable content standpoint, but the sodium level is high.  (I'm assuming that the nutritional information below is based on using low sodium soy sauce, and even then it says that this recipe constitutes 50% of one's daily recommended instake!  And that's before I added the oyster sauce!)
