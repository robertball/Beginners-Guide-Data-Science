I've been making this cake with consistently excellent results for over 25 years. I make a homemade buttercream frosting that I frost similarly to a german chocolate cake - just between the layers and on top not the sides. It the most requested cake for family get togethers.

Ran out of milk; just used water and it was still moist. I put a caramel frosting on it instead of the cream...yummy. So easy; like the "dump" cakes.

And amazin' it truly is!! I cut the recipe in half and it made exactly 18 cupcakes which were perfectly baked at 20 minutes. I added additional spice per personal preference. If you like a little kick you can add a couple good shakes of white or black pepper which will leave a pleasant warmth on the tongue. I frosted them with a basic cream cheese frosting gently laced with allspice. The cupcakes did not dome even slightly but came out just about level with the tops of the papers when filled about 3/4 with batter. The crumb is exquisitely fine and tender and they're so moist that they don't even shed a crumb when bitten into or pulled apart. For this reason they freeze perfectly when wrapped airtight. Old-fashioned wholesome deliciousness.

Excellent cake that's a hit with family and friends. I have a buddy who bakes cakes as a side job and he absolutely loved it. My amendments to the recipie is replacing the milk with apple juice and adding two teaspons of vanilla extract. This would also make a great carrot cake.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the frosting I had a can of cream cheese frosting on hand so I used that instead and oohhh man is it delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I used non dairy ingredients and it was still very good! Only thing is it was a little bit too sweet for my taste. I'll add a little less sugar next time.
