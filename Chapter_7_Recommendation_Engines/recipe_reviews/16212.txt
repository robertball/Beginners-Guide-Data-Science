These cookies are the best cookies I have baked to date so far. I have baked this cookie three times and there are a couple tricky techniques to make this cookie completely out of this world. 

First, it really makes a HUGE difference on the amount of grease you spread on the pan. More grease means the sides will bake quicker than the structural integrity of the cookie. I spayed the cookie sheet with Pam and then wiped excess off with a paper towel. This did the trick.

Second is the time and placement of the Andes mint chocolate. I admit I did have trouble trying to figure this one out. The solution is you first let the cookie cool about a minute or until the cookie looks pretty deflated. Second, you place the mint on top (logo facing down) and press it into the cookie. Try only on a few until you start to get a hang of it. Then when the sides look shiny, but the middle still have a flat surface. Take a teaspoon and lightly flip the mint. Then drag the mint on the inner rim of the cookie. After the cookies have finished their decorative process. Promptly place them in the refrigerator still on the tray. Placing them on a cooling rack only delays the initial chocolate hardening.  

Well I hope this review and these key tricks helped. Happy Baking!!

Wonderful! Easy to overcook. Don't cook with your eyes. I could have sworn these were not done by 9 minutes. Consequently, I cooked one batch for 12 minutes and they were hard, not soft like I prefer. I got the hang of it after the first batch. These cookies freeze well. Good for gift giving.

These are great!  Pretty easy too.  I didn't have regular Andes mints, just Andes mints baking chips, so I mixed them into the dough before baking.  I set some aside and sprinkled them on top of the cookies after coming out of the oven, and swirled them around.  Used a cookie scoop and my cookies turned out perfect!  Crisp around the edges (but not too crisp) and chewy in the center.  Will try again with regular Andes mints.

Great cookie!  I used only half an Andes mint chocolate on every small and larger cookie - a whole piece was too messy.  I also waited a good few minutes before I placed the candy on the cookie so it wouldn't slide off and drip.  
Love them!  Thanks!!!

These cookies also won for me at a cookie exchange last year. Since then, I've had people ask me for the recipe.   A slight change I make is instead of the two tablespoons of water, I use freshly brewed and cooled down coffee.  Coffee sets off the flavor of chocolate really well. You don't taste the coffee, you just taste the chocolate MORE. I sometimes also use a teeny bit of peppermint extract when I want them REALLY minty. They're a favorite every time.

I won first prize at a cookie exchange for these cookies!  I baked a lot of extra to freeze and take to different holiday functions and they were always a big hit.

after the first batch, I realized the cookies were more like brownies, so used mini muffin tins and they were such a hit!!! I also used Peppermint Patties, which were messy to spread, but turned out yummy.

These cookies were AMAZING. They were gone within two days! I was a bit hesitant to make them, since the recipe seemed a bit complicated for me, but it actually wasn't hard. 


I was worried for the Andes mint on top, because it didn't seem to smear very well....but once the melted chocolate cooled, they were splended. Everyone loved them, and I didn't even get to eat that many!

These cookies are wonderful!!  They taste like Girl Scout Thin Mints, especially when 1/2 of an Andes candy is melted on top.  Yum!

Mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm good! These are so amazingly good! I was scared at first when I took them out of the oven since they were all lumpy. But once I put the  andes mint on top (which I smushed so it would cover the cookie) it was honestly so pretty. Oh and the taste, its absolutely decadent. Thank you so much for such an amazing cookie recipe!

The melted andes mints are a five star idea. The cookie, by itself, is not. As one person already remarked, it is kinda 'greasy'. I will not be making this recipe again, however, I will be melting andes mint candies on my own chocolate cookie dough recipe (and my own sugar cookies and my own shortbread cookies) in the future. Thanks for a great idea.

DELICIOUS!  I'm usually wary of trying recipes that don't have at least 30 reviews, but I really like Girl Scout thin mints, so I thought I'd try. These don't taste like thin mints, but they're still very good.  I made small cookies and used half an Andes mint for each one.  The chocolate takes some time to cool down and harden again.  I think it tastes better when the chocolate is hardened and not melted.

Excellent! Instead of the chocolate mint wafers, I used candy cane hershey kisses. When you swirl with a spoon, the red and white look amazing.

VERY good! I must say, though, I almost threw these out.  I followed the directions perfectly, refrigerated for one hour...and it was still very wet. There was no way I was forming balls out of that dough. So I put it back in the refrigerator for another hour or so and it was better, but still not rollable. I spooned them onto the cookie sheet like a regular cookie and baked them. They came out big and flat as a pancake! Tasted alright, but did not look pretty at all. I threw those cookies out and luckily stuck the dough in the fridge overnight. Tried again the next morning. Rolled my little balls, baked for 8 minutes and voila! They came out perfect. I melted 1/2 the Andes mint on each cookie, swirled it with a spoon and let them harden on the counter. They tasted just like a Girl Scout Thin Mint, except they were chewy, which was awesome. Definitely making these again, but I'll plan to leave the dough in the fridge overnight from now on.

Oh man, these are TO DIE FOR. They have the consistency of a chocolate crinkle (just make sure not to overbake!--take out while still a tad gooey looking) but the mint is the real winner here. Be careful, though, these taste deceptively "light and refreshing," to the point where you can down four or five without batting an eye! Thanks for my new favorite cookie recipe!

One of the best cookies ever!!!  The only change I made was to use mint chips and semi-sweet chips on the top instead of the mint candies.  They swirled together beautifully.  I love the colors, the texture, and the taste.  Love them!

Edit since Original Review - These cookies are great but, after about 36 hours if there is any left overs they get kinda blah...even though they were stored in a tight container.   It took some time to get the feel of the cookies.  I ended up putting the dough into the fridge overnight (even though it was a lot harder it seemed the cookies turned out better.) A  metal cookie scoop from Pampered Chef made scooping the hard cookie dough out no problem even after sitting in the fridge all night.  These cookies are definitely a cookie you do NOT want to over bake.  I found 10 minutes cookie time was exactly perfect for these (and letting them sit on the cookie sheet for 1 minute.  I ended up using only half of a Andes Candy on each cookie a whole piece just made the cookies to rich if you make the cookies walnut sized (this is with using parchment paper on my cookie sheet so my cookies didn't really spread out much.)
I loved the ones that have a lil bit of green left on the top of the cookie I wish that more of the cookies had the brown/green swirls in them but unfortunately it is hard to keep the swirls in sometimes.  I think I may add a  1/8 teaspoon of mint extract to the cookie dough next time (I just want a hint of mint in the actual cookie so figure 1/8 of teaspoon might just be enough.) If you overbake the cookies they seem to taste a bit more like thin mints (crunchy) but I prefer them soft and chewy.  I found taking them out when the cookie began to crack that it seemed

These cookies are amazing! They melt in your mouth! Just don't let the cookies cool too much before putting the chocolate mint piece on or they won't melt onto the cookie. I didn't work quick enough for some of my cookies and had to put them in the microwave for a few seconds to get the chocolate to melt.

My girlfriend says that these are the BEST cookies she's ever eaten - and I agree.  They are AWESOME.  I was a little concerned about the mints not adequately melting, so came up with a very easy solution.  After placing a mint on each cookie and realizing that they were not melting quickly enough, I simply returned the cookie sheet with the cookies back into the oven for about ten seconds, and this did the trick.  Then I spread the mints around with a spoon.  Make these; they are fabulous!

AMAZING!! The only change I made was add chocolate mint wafers that are made of Splenda. It made the cookies a little more calorie friendly but they were perfect! I have had 5 people ask for the recipe already!

I made three batches of these and put them in little Christmas bags as Christmas presents.  I made 1/2 with Andes Mints and the other half with Andes Cherry Jubilee flavored candies (for some green and some pink).  Everyone that I gave them to raved about them and asked for the recipe.  I will definately make these again next year.  Thanks for the recipe Jackie!

First, I have to say that I din't post a photo because my cookies look just as pretty as the all the other photos. These cookies makes the best freezer cookies.  I honestly did not like them warm and I am a huge cookie fan.  My husband doesn't like cookies unless they are frozen, so I tried freezing them...and then wow, when you take them out of the freezer, that is when they taste similar to a girl scout thin mint (only chewy).  I definately will make these again, but only as a freezer cookie=)

Great recipe! Used only half of mint, on each cookie and that was plenty. Used parchment paper on my cookies sheets, that way there is no need to grease the sheets, placed the mint on the cookies while on the cookie sheet and swirled the candy with the back of a baby spoon when melted. They turned out beautiful!

Didn't change a thing, except doubling the recipe and cutting the Andes mints in half.  The back of a spoon works a lot better than the toothpick for swirtling.  Everyone R.A.V.E.D. about these.  I stayed true to Weight Watchers and didn't even try one.  But they smell great!

Delicious!  This was the easiest cookie recipe I've ever made, and the cookies were amazing.  I only used half an andes mint on each cookie and I'm glad I did, because I think a whole one would be too overpowering.  I also used a spoon to swirl the mint, a toothpick wasn't working for me.  But these were great and I plan on making them for my holiday cookie swap.  I halved the recipe and it still made 42 cookies.

Really easy to make, and super tasty.  We used Andes mints, can't wait to try it with another type of candy.

Boyfriend's dad loved it.  His opinion is what mattered.  I dont like mint candy so i personally didnt try it.  However Andes Mints worked wonders and looked great when swirled.

This cookie was a hit at our Christmas Party.  Everyone loved them, even the folks that don't care for mint.  Delicious and rich, but not overly minty, which I like.  My daughter is mint crazy, and loves these.  Thanks Jackie!

Love these!  These have become one of my "go-to" cookies for Christmas (and, well, for any time). Just realized I've made them multiple times without reviewing! 
This past Christmas I made them but couldn't find the Andes (bulk or namebrand) chocolates ANYWHERE... except in the gourmet section where they were handmade in little baggies and SUPER expensive. So I used mint-chocolate-chips and they are NOT the same.  Ok, but definitely lacking. Before I moved to Ontario, I used to be able to find the bulk-style (in BC) at many different grocery stores... so not sure if it's a regional thing? Anyway, if you can get the Andes-style chocolates, USE them, it's worth the difference. Next time I might even cave and buy the gourmet ones if it's for something really special. These also make a great chocolate cookie "base" (try other additives - crushed candy cane, peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips or skor/heath bar bits etc). I used them for "ears" on monkey cupcakes and they were a hit.  Definitely a recipe I've used over and over and over again!

My youngest daughter (age 8) chose this recipe for our "one-on-one cookie baking time" at Christmas.  She was able to do a lot of the steps without my help.  The cookies were delicious and disappeared quickly.

These taste GREAT! I made them a bit small and used 1/2 a mint - mostly because I purchased one bag while at the store one day not realizing I needed more. Next time I will use the whole one as I was able to on the last two dozen - not only more mint - but they look prettier. I did do one thing different - since I really like mint - and it also made up for the 1/2 mint on top - I put one cup mint chocolate chips and one reg. chips into the cookies - that way the mint wasn't only on the topping. I'm glad I did that!!  I think too much thought has gone into swirling the chocolate from reviewers - just set the mint on the cookie - fresh out of the oven - give it a couple minutes - use a fork (or something) and swirl it. Just don't get why all these people talk about flipp'in it - waiting 1 minute - etc. Just swirl it - it turns out great - I thought it was going to be a big deal----NOT! UPDATE:
These are now a must at Christmas - not only for my family but for my co-workers! I've been putting in Andes Creme De Menthe Chips (I can only find them at Thanksgiving & Christmas time) for 2/3 the amount of reg.chips called for - brings out a great mint taste. Also - be sure to use parchment paper...for all your cookies - you can reuse it MANY times!!

This recipe was pretty good. The first few spread out WAY too much. I chilled the dough and the second batch turned out much better. These are best eaten warm as they tend to crisp up when cooled. These are good with icecream and hot fugde.

Oh, yum!  These cookies are so tasty.  After reading other reviews about them being "lumpy", I decided to roll them into three "slice and bake" logs, once the dough had become chilled enough to be easily handled.  It made preparation very easy, and created a uniform looking cookie.  I was "snowbound" the day I made them, so used some brown and white thin mints that I had on hand.  It wasn't as colorful as the Andes mints, but still looked fine, and tasted great.  The finished cookie has a crackle finish, like gingerbread cookies, and a slight chewiness, like a good brownie.  My son's first comment was "they taste like the Girl Scout cookies!"  These will be a regular part of my annual Christmas cookie tray.  Thank you for listing them.

I was looking for a recipe to use the bag of Andes mint baking chips that I had in my pantry. This recipe is perfect! I just mixed the chips in with the batter before putting in the fridge. I just can't stop eating them. I am looking forward to trying the individual mints on top!!

I used 3/4 Andes mint per cookie. If you cut the mints into pieces before putting them on the cookie, it's easier to get a nice green mint swirl pattern. After removing the cookies from the oven and letting them cool a minute or two, I put them on paper towel lined plates (to absorb oils from the greased pan) in the fridge to cool and harden the chocolate.

This is a great recipe!  Im very glad that I tried it out even though I was a little hesitant becasue Ive never made a cookie recipe that called for boiling any of the ingredients.  I used all of the ingredients listed and added a tsp of vanilla extract.  I also had bags of andes candies chiped-pre chopped on hand so I used those insead of buying whole candies.  There is NO NEED to grease your cookie pans if you use parchment paper-not to be confused with wax paper.  You can find it in all grocery stores near the foil.  Once I pulled the cookies out of the oven they still were very slightly dome shapped so I took a spoon and gently pressed on the top to make a little divot in the center to sprinkle the andes chips on it.  A minute or two later I swirled the melted candy and let cool.  In order to make the green and chocolate swirl effect you need to just swirl and not spread the melted candy.  This is a keeper of a cookie recipe for sure!

I was a little concerned that mine deflated after I took them out of the oven but I noticed I didn't use enough baking soda. 
They were still AMAZING. I took them to work and they were all gone before the second hour. I even had someone ask for the recipe. 
I put them in the freezer after I melted the mint on top to harden the chocolate. They were just as good cold as fresh out of the oven.

I've been making cookies like these for years and they are very good. I always get compliments and requests for these cookies.  Being diabetic, I also make a sugar-free/reduced sugar version --> substitute Splenda Brown for the regular brown sugar and your choice of sugar-free/reduced sugar version of the chocolate chips and thin mint wafers, Russel Stover makes a readily available one. (just as a warning: the sugar-free/reduced sugar version may be chewier and can have a laxative effect if too many are eaten at once.)  Also, for a "Christmas cookie" you can use the green-mint filled mints.

I decided to give these a try as my "new" cookie recipe for the holidays.  I will definitely make them in the future.
1.  EASY to make.
2.  Great cookie to make with kids.  I had my 5 year old rolling the balls of dough and helping unwrap mints.
3.  On one batch I used Andes mints with the green on the outside and chocolate on the inside.  This made for a much nicer topping on the cookie (appearance-wise).
4.  On a second batch I used the Andes baking pieces.  Messier and not as pretty on top.  I won't use the pieces again.  I'll stick with the regular candies.
5.  Good reviews from everyone that has had a batch delivered to them so far!

These are one of the best cookies EVER! My family and friends loved them. They are soo chewy and the melted mint on top just makes them even better. I made these for Christmas and put them in goody baskets. To give them a festive touch, I sprinkled red and green sugar on them right after the mint had melted. They set up great and looked perfect!

Everything a mint lover could desire. Nice and soft cookie with yummy "frosting".  Very good.  Don't overbake or they get to crunchy.

A better title for this recipe would be "DEATH BY CHOCOLATE MINT!"  This sinfully outstanding dessert is so much fun to make (especially when you swirl in the mints) but even more fun to EAT!!  Definitely one cookie recipe I'll never stop making.  Thanks What A Dish!

YUM!  These got voted "best cookies" at my recent in-laws cookie day for Christmas.  Their statement:  The Girl Scouts ain't got nothin' on you!  I used half an andes mint on each.  Yummy!

These won me the best tasting prize at a cookie exchange as well.  I will say though, they don't keep well. I made a batch a week before Christmas and they were just ok by Christmas Eve.  The first 3 days we couldn't keep our hands off them.

These cookies are GREAT!  Thank you Jackie.  I'll definitely make them again.  I used 1/2 mint per cookie as other reviewers suggested.  I found the back of a spoon to be the best way to mush the mint and get a nice swirl pattern.

Very Mintie.  I made some without the Andes mint and they were good too.  Very chewy and moist cookie.

I made these for a work party and wanted a smaller cookie so I used a 2 tsp cookie scoop. The recipe ended up yeilding over 8 dozen cookies.  Instead of the wrapped Andes candy I used a bag of the Andes baking chips.  When the cookies came out of the oven I put aprox 1/2 tsp of the chips on each one.  I then spread the melted chocolate over the cookies with the back of a spoon. These cookies came out fantastic!  I'll be adding these to my Holiday cookie platters for sure.

These taste wonderful, and were a big hit with the family.  Didn't change a thing.  And a word to the wise, when the timer goes off at 8 minutes and they don't look done, take them out anyway.  They stay chewy this way.  If you keep them in longer than what it says until they "look done" they'll be crispy.

I have been making these cookies for years. You do not have to take the chocolate mix and mix in a bowl with flour, do it all in the pan. Also Andes Mints come in a variety of flavors and all work. So if you want variety, pick up the cherry jubilee and toffee flavors of  Andes Mints. The only place I can usually finds the other flavors is places like Walgreens. 

Let cookies cool a little gently set mint on top, put tray back in over for 15-20 seconds,  pull tray back out and spread melted mint over cookie. I see some people are trying to turn this into rocket science, but this recipes is truly very simple. :)

These cookies are so neat! They will be a Christmas cookie this year. I used the chopped Andes mint candy pieces in the baking isle. These cookies would be pretty with the red and white peppermint candies to I think. They taste very good also. The base of the cookie is a mix between a brownies and a chocolate cookie. What really makes this cookie, though, is the mint candy. It looks very fancy with the mint and chocolate swirls. I did 1/2 recipe and got 2 dozen. I did have to cook mine a bit longer than suggested. Putting them in the fridge for a bit, I found, will set the chocolate to take to a party or wrap for later.

ABSOLUTLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!  Followed recipe and the dough made 44 good size cookies, 2 of which didn't last long enough to cool all the way! :-)  5 stars for taste and ease of prep.  I used a TB cookie scoop, which I would highly recommend to anyone who is even a casuel cookie baker.  They make the task of dough portioning WAY easy!!  Can you tell I liked these?????!!  Oh, one more thing that I personally found put these yummies OVER THE TOP, was to double the amount to salt called for.  Chocolate and salt play VERY nicely together....give it a try!!!

I made these for a Eurovision party the other night. I skipped the mint topping (hard to find those chocolates here in Russia), and replaced the chocolate chips with four bags of M&Ms. Everyone loved them, and I've had to share the recipe, they were so popular! Got well over forty with the recipe, and they keep amazingly well.
Definitely take out at ten minutes... thought they weren't done, but trusted another reviewer's advice, and took them out. Deliciously firm outside, chewy on the inside. Amazing.

I made these for Christmas (4 months ago), and my husband and I were reflecting the other day about how good they were. They are that good! I used a half of an Andes mint on each one, and I felt that was plenty. I also opened up the mints and broke them in half before taking the cookies out of the oven as others suggested.

Mmmm!!! If you're not eating them in a day or 2, definitely freeze.  They thaw well. I also added some crushed candy canes to the top before it dried for a little extra mint and texture.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! They are so good, I cannot even put into words!  And I am a "problem baker" and they STILL were that good! lol. I also used only a half a mint and it was perfect. Can't wait to take these to my cookie exchange at work!

So wonderful. Like a Girl Scout thin mint, but chewy and more decadent! Some tips: bake the cookies until they are very crackly all over and until the edges are almost firm to the touch. I pulled my first batch too soon--just after the tops started to crackle and stopped looking "wet"--and the cookies were delicious, but semi-raw inside. I baked the next few batches according to my tips above, and they came out wonderfully. In my opinion, these cookies are even better the day-after.

Followed the recipe as indicated, chilling for 1 hour as in recipe.  Found these cookies fell flat when cooking.  Added 1/2 cup more of flour and they didn't flatten out and were less greasy.  Used mint flavoured chocolate chips instead of mint candy chocolate.

OUTSTANDING!  So easy to do and great results.  Just follow the recipe exactly and you can't go wrong.  I did use parchment paper, however, as I have a heavy hand when greasing a cookie sheet.  Thank you Jackie Schmidt for sharing such an OUTSTANDING recipe!

These cookies are FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and the cookies turned out perfectly.  I tried swirling the candy with a toothpick but had better success using a long handled iced tea spoon.  I will never buy this cookie from the girl scouts again.  They don't even compare!  THANKS!

Very rich and tasty cookie! I didn't change anything except to use up some milk chocolate chips (about 3/4 cup) along with the semi-sweet. I had about 4 cookies that I didn't have Andes for, so I put some leftover Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting on them. 8 minutes in the oven gave me cookies that were still a teeny bit raw so 9 minutes was just perfect.

So good! I made these for an office party and was thanked the entire night. I did find that an entire andes mint was too much. Cut the mints in half and they are PERFECT!

Instead of buying the packages of candies, there are precrunched Andies Mint Candies you can buy, it's in the chocolate chip section. They work great!

Absolutely Delicious! The best cookies I have evermade or ate. Everyone loved them. I couldn't get the swirl to look quite right with a toothpick or spoon, my finger worked alot better! Also, I ended up with around 80 cookies! Will definetly make again! Yummm...

I made these to take to work for St. Patrick's day.  They were a huge hit with the entire office, and I received compliments on them for the entire week.  The cookies turned out perfect, chewy with a delicious chocolate mint shell topping.  I love these easy to make and delcicious crowd pleasers!

These are REALY GOOD! I had some "Andes" Creme De Menthe baking chips on hand and wanted to make something with them. This was the right thing I only had 1 cup of regular chocolate chips so I used 1 cup of the "Andes" chips with it. Then sprinked  the chips on when the cookies were done. A piece of mint would have been less messy- but sometimes you use what you have- I made small, 2-bite size cookies and got almost 100.

Very yummy.  Easy to make and soft.  They took about 9 minutes to cook and came out perfect!  I may add a little more sugar next time but otherwise really good.  I could not get the toothpick thing to work so I just mushed the candy with a spoon.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed but I used Andes Creme De Menthe Baking Chips only because I already had them in the house.  When spreading the chocolate with a toothpick these chips become marbleized with green and brown. They were excellent!

I made these cookies for our neighborhood cookie exchange today and they were a HUGE hit! One person even said I left all the other cookies in the dust!  And I have to say, I totally agree! I used dark chocolate mint truffle kisses. Mmmm. Just the right about of chewy-ness to them. Even when stored in the fridge. This is a keeper for sure.

these are the best cookies I've ever made!! I make them over and over, especially at Christmas time because of the green swirl. I usually use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet for a little less sweet.

Best cookies I've ever made. I always do about a dozen different types of cookies at Christmas time and these are always the first to go. The cookie itself has a brownie-like consistency, and the addition of the Andes mint makes them heavenly. They freeze well, too. Found some hidden in my freezer from two months ago and they still tasted fresh and yummy!

I made these cookies for my boyfriend and the rest of his Navy buddies. It really wasn't that difficult and they absolutely loved it. I waited maybe 30 seconds before I put the chocolate on the cookies (even though I know some of the comments say to wait a minute) and they turned out fine. I actually liked doing that better because I like how quickly the chocolate melted. I used half an andes chocolate on each cookie. This recipe made around 50ish small cookies for me.

Great cookie, was a favorite during a cookie exchange.  I took another comment's advice and used the Andes pieces... but I wouldn't do that again I felt the crumbles were too messy.  Will make again with the pieces cut in half.

Awesome! Delicious! These are my husband's new favorite cookie.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe, no changes are needed! I think the cookie part reminds me a little of a brownie, but they are a nice firm cookies, something about the denseness of them though but these are rich and delicious and I think we're addicted!

After reading lots of the reviews here is the method I used, very easy.  Do not grease the cookie sheet, just line it with parchment paper.  Bake for 8 minutes.  Let the cookie sit on the cookie sheet for a minute then press the mint into each cookie (I used Andes mints and laid them on the cookie with the Andes name facing the cookie, not sure it matters).  Put the cookie sheet back in the oven for about 15 seconds to soften the mint.  Take the cookies back out of the oven, swirl the mint with the back of a spoon.  Slide the parchment paper, with the cookies, onto a cooling rack.  Let cool a bit then put the cookies, cooling rack and all, in the fridge until the mints firm up again.  These are yummy.  My son thought it was too minty but we were much too lazy to cut the mints in half.  I like them just the way they are.

loved the final result of these cookies but oh my were they a mess ... they stuck to my pans sooo bad i wanted to scream.  i then made the mistake of putting them on wire racks to cool, and the cookies literally melted through the wires.  it was a disaster.  made a second batch on parchment paper, and cooled them on parchment as well.  this went much better.  i also used hershey's bliss mint chocolates because i couldn't find andes anywhere...but i highly doubt this had anything to do with the cookie sticking/melting issue.

These were great!  I tried making them with both Junior Mints & Andes Mints.  They both were tasty but the Andes is prettier looking when swirled.  I put them in the refrigerator and they were so good cold!  Yum!

I have made THOUSANDS of these through out the years. LOVE THEM. My preference is with half a mint. Also makes a great batter for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie. I have even x5 the recipe for Christmas (I did say "thousands," didn't I?). They always come out EXCEPTIONAL, without fail.

These are incredible! I've had so many people ask me for this recipe. TIPS: Follow the directions exactly! Use semi-sweet HERSHEY'S chocolate chips. For some reason, it isn't as good when I use anything else. I would suggest the dough gets refrigerated for at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours since the warmer the dough is, the flatter they'll turn out.  And take them out RIGHT when they're done! (I even take a minute or so off my time.) They might not look done, but they are!  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!

I don't agree with calling these cookies, I believe they should be chocotazzles with a slap on the tongue with minty goodness.  Loved them, and they get better with age, because being a great baker I sort of over cooked a little, so they were pretty hard, but give them a few days and they were as chewing as could be.

Excellent!  Just don't put in fridge for too long.  I made the dough early in the morning, did a lot of other Christmas baking, and then got back to these.  The dough was as hard as a rock and took forever to get to a workable stage.  These will definitely be added to my annual Christmas baking day.

Perfect just the way it is.  I couldn't find Andes mints so I made it using Trader Joe's dark chocolate mints, which I had to break up into pieces. Worked great.

WOW!  I am starting a bakery that features cookies and then the other baked goods are also available, so I am absolutely thrilled to find this new cookie - it is fabulous!  
A few changes I made because I wanted faster and less expensive - I substituted part marg. with the butter.  I also didn't refrigerate dough and didn't make balls - just spoon it onto trays and they turn out perfectly round and great!  I ran out of Andes (which I cut in half and it was plenty of mintiness) so I used Hershey's Kisses on some and then swirled it around and also choc. and peanut butter swirled baking chips to give it a nice peanut buttery taste.  Have fun and don't eat too many!

I have made these cookies for years. I do not grease the cookie sheets. Instead, I line them with foil. I never had a problem with the cookies sticking to the foil. Also, I melt the Andes mints, frost the cookies, then put on candy sprinkles before the chocolate hardens.  Great cookies!

These are delicious and beautiful cookies! I do think that half of a mint is enough for each cookie, a full one seem to be a little bit too much.  There are definitely on the Christmas cookie list!

Quite a good recipe! I added raspberries to make it even better and it came out delicious! Extremely sweet and chocolately though- maybe a bit too much?

Tastes unbelievably good.  Reminds me of grasshopper cookies which I love.  I melted Andes creme de menth baking chips on the top and the result was a delicate mint flavor that seemed to permeate the entire cookie without overpowering the chocolate.  These are very decadent cookies and I will definitely be making these again.

What fabulous cookies! My boyfriend and his roommates annihilated them the first time I tried this recipe out - they are amazing just the way they are without any substitutions. Be careful not to overcook. I cook them about 7 to 8 minutes and they're perfect. Don't eat any of your Andes Mints while they bake! You'll need ALL of them for the cookies. :) I've tried different toppings like peanut butter cups, white chocolate, crushed candy canes, and peppermint patties but my testers and I agree that Andes Mints taste the best. Enjoy!

These cookies were so good!  I only used half of a mint on each cookie and that was plenty.  I made these for Christmas gifts and received so many compliments.  One of the teachers said she was going to start getting me to make cookies for every party!  Warning:  Don't chill the dough too long, especially not overnight.  I chilled some of the dough overnight and it was so dry and crumbly!  I managed to get them into cookie form, but the cookies didn't even taste as good.  I wouldn't recommend chilling more than the hour that the recipe calls for.

My family and friends voted this the best cookie they've ever eaten!  They demanded I pass the recipe on to them immediately.  The key to this recipe is:  Do NOT overbake them.  Everyone likes them a little "gooey".

These are outstanding. When at room temp they are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. When refrigerated, they are crunchy (like girl scout thin mints). I used Andes Candies pieces (with the chocolate chips at the grocery store) but next time I'll get the little rectangles and use half instead. The pieces roll off the cookies and melt on the tray, making a mess and wasting the candy. And the amount of candy melted on top was inconsistent. It was fine... just a little harder to work with. I made my dough balls about the size of superballs and this recipes yielded 95 cookies. These will keep you busy though... by the time I got done spreading the mint chocolate on batch 1, batch 2 was coming out of the oven. It was constant work - no down time while they were in the oven. Well worth it!

These cookies are great. A couple things I did were sprinkle a bit of powdered sugar on before baking them and if you have them and want a different option other than mint is to put a peanut butter cup or caramel filled chocolate. Absolutely amazing!!

Amazing! I made this recipe as is for a bunch of my college friends and these cookies got gobbled up! They were a little hard to eat at first because the chocolate was so runny, but after cooling off the chocolate solidified  and they weren't messy. I made these cookies again and stirred in some white chocolate chips instead of using the mints.  They were really good this way too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've used these a couple of times for cookie exchanges and they are a huge hit!  I'm not much of a baker and I haven't messed these up yet.  I used Peppermint Patties the first time around and they were delicious like that as well.  These cookies are still delicious (perhaps even more so) a couple of days after baking them!

Yummy! This cookie is very fudgey and the chocolate mint frosting from the Andes mint looks and tastes a lot more complicated than it is. I followed the recipe exactly except for using a whole mint for each cookie - I definitely recommend doing this.

Excellent! I first tried these at a cookie exchange a few years ago and had longed to make them. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I was a bit worried during the process, and after refrigerating, the dough was very fudgy... I even thought I had done something wrong. But it was all in vain - they were perfect. Thank You!

Super easy and really good. The chocolate cookie dough is a great base for add ins like heath bar pieces or peanut butter chips if you're not a big fan of mint.

This recipe was fabulous!  The instructions were perfect.  The only thing that I did differently was that instead of using the Andes mints, I used junior mints.  They are each about the size of a dime. I placed 3 on the top of each cookie.  I gently pushed them down and they cooled firm into the cookie looking like chocolate buttons.  Thank you for your wonderful recipe.  I know my family and friends would thank you also.

These are delicious! I managed to veganise these by using a dairy-free mint thin candy, dairy-free semi-sweet chocolate chips, dairy-free margarine, and King's Mill brand egg replacer instead of eggs. I also halved the recipe and ended up with 30 cookies. Also, I added 1/4 tsp each of vanilla and mint extract to the dough. I'm very impressed with this recipe :) Oh, be forewarned that they spread out a lot when you bake'em!

This cookie was a big hit at Christmas and the start of a new tradition. I used only 1/3 of an Andes mint on each cookie. I found bigger pieces made the cookie look messy.  I used a toothpick to round out the corners of the melted chocolate.

What a great cookie, especially for the holidays.  My friends and coworkers raved about these cookies.  Be prepared for the amount this recipe makes - I halved the recipe and came out with almost twice the amount I expected.

Excellent Cookie!  I split the chocolate dough in half before I put it into the fridge and added nuts to one half.  I broke the ande's mints in half before I put them into the plain chocolate dough as others suggested.  No mint in ones with nuts.  I used a mellon ball scooper to make perfect size cookies.  GREAT RECIPE and EASY

I was trying to find some different recipies for cookie platters for a wedding.  This one sounded very interesting and easy.  It is great! In making a single batch I got over 100 cookies using the smaller version and just half a mint.  I must say again these are great cookies...Thank you for sharing this.

Made 1/2 of this recipe as a trial run. My package of mint baking chips were chocolate, white and green. I used the chocolate and white for the batter and melted the green mint chips along with 1 teaspoon of shortening and piped on top of the melted, swirled mint patties. These are so easy to make and have a delicious minty, chocolate flavor. I only baked for 7 minutes on parchment lined cookie sheets. I can't wait to make for our upcoming St. Patrick's Day party.  Thanks for sharing your 5 star recipe, Jackie Schmidt!

My son suggested I bake these after having them at a friend's house.  While I wasn't so sure at first because the dough can be pretty crumbly, the end result is fantastic.  The cookies are moist and taste just like a thin mint Girl Scout cookie.  Yum!

As usual I read the reviews before starting - I have to say the advice was spot on.   The helpful tips were - 1- make sure the dough is very cold before you start (it's almost fudge-like).  2- Parchment paper instead of greasing your pan.  3- Half an Andes mint on each cookie about 1 minute after you remove them from the oven, and then go right back and flip the unmelted mint over.  This was the hardest part, to get that swirly mint look.  Mine cooked for 9 1/2 minutes - they are EXCELLENT.  This is a keeper for sure.

These are very good!  I added Andes mint chips to the dough to get a little more minty flavor.  I also used dark chocolate chips.  Excellent!!

These taste just like Chocolate Mint Girl Scout cookies!  I've made this the past 2 years for a cookie exchange and get rave reviews.  I only use 1/2 an Andes mint on the top and it's just the right amount of chocolate/frosting!

So good, but be warned- a lot more work than normal cookies.  That being said, the chocolate, cake-like cookies were the perfect complement to the melted andes candies.  A favorite with my family this Christmas.

These are the best cookies that I ever baked.  I could not find chocolate covered mints at my store.  I substituted a 12 oz. bag of Andes creme de menthe chips.  They were excellent!

I made these in my mini muffin pan and ended up with 35. Baked them at 300 for 10 minutes and then topped with 1/2 an Andes. Next time, I'll try a full Andes.

These cookies are now my favorite cookie! I've made them twice now, first time with the Semisweet Chocolate Chips, second time with Milk Chocolate chips.. I made them for my husbands work place and they were a HUGE hit. Everyone is convinced I'm a professional baker (Haha yea right!)

These are good (and I have to say the dough is one of the yummiest cookie doughs ever!) but I find with the thin mint on the top of the cookie that it made for a funny texture clash, the chocolate just stuck to the roof of my mouth and was chewy and then the cookies was so nice and fluffy... I think if I try this recipe again and will make it so the thin mint is within the cookie.

fantastic, I usually bake these like a brownie in a 9x13 pan for 15-20 mins and dump all the candies on while still fairly warm then swirl them around and serve when cooled.

Sorry, but for me this recipe was much ado about very little. My cookie-loving grandsons didn't care for them. Chocolatey, minty, but nothing special. Won't be using this recipe again.

Absolutely wonderful chocolate cookie dough! I was looking for a nice one that had no milk in it and was very delightfully surprised.

I did do a few tweaks. Used Dark Chocolate chips and dark brown sugar for the dough, as well as adding in 2 tbsps of Hazelnut Liqueur, white chocolate chips, and chopped hazelnuts. Recipe made about 72 cookies total.

Boyfriend took roughly more than half to work (small business) and brought none back. Was a wonderful success!

I just made these and they are WONDERFUL!  Instead of whole mint candies I used a bag of chopped up Andes mints (found them right by the chocolate chips), just added them to the cookie dough at the end.  I'll have to make these again really soon because the family has eaten almost all of them in 2 days!

These were a huge hit at my office, but I modified them, using crushed up Andes candies in place of the chocolate chips, and skipping the frosting bit. AMAZING.

I made these as per the original recipe.  They were very easy to make, and tasty.  I am a huge mint fan, but found these super rich!  I could only eat one at a sitting (which was good).  Would make again for sure.

These are fantastic. I used the chocolate mint candies from the bulk section at the grocer, they're about the size of a silver dollar. These cookies turned out perfect. I ran out of chocolates because I was expecting the batch to make about 44 cookies, and it made 62. I tried using mini York patties on the remainder, and it did not work. York patties are too thick and chewy. You need mint chocolates that are firm and crisp.  I will definitely make this recipe for years to come.

I followed the recipe except using chocolate morsal chips instead of semi sweet chips, for the mint I used andies mint baking chips, I just used a 1/2 teaspoon to put the mint chips on the cookies when they came out of the oven, waiting for a minute before doing so.  I spreaded the mint chips around with the back of a spoon and it worked great. One thing the dough got hard after 2 hrs in the fridge, id say it was the chocolate morsals, maybe leave in the fridge an hr or less.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were perfect also mine were not lumpy as others said theres was.  another tip you can use you thumb or the back of a spoon and make an indent in the cookie when the first come out of the oven and fill the indent with the mint baking chips, only if you love mint lol.

Wish there was a 10 star option.  These cookies rock!  Made it just as the recipe said.   AWESOME!  It made a lot so I rolled some of the dough into balls and put in freezer.  Hopefully they'll be just as  good.  Thank you so much for this recipe.   It is a KEEPER for sure.

My mom has been making these cookies for years, and they are by far my favorite Christmas cookies!  I make a double batch every year.  I bake them on aluminum foil to make clean up easy.

five starts this is a very yummy cookie. It also makes a lot. I had only one egg but it did not make a difference at all. No changes needed just perfect.

The mints on the top make this cookie.  I would never make them without it.  Besides that, the cookie was good, but I think the mint made it phenomenal.

I'm not a huge mint chocolate fan, but these are really great.  The cookie is soft with just the right amount of chocolate.  These cookies also freeze really well.

These cookies are fantastic! Sprayed the cookie sheets with Pam and used half of an Andes mint on top of each cookie. They are best warm from the oven.

This is really a good recipe.  To those that found it too dry/crunchie you might have over cooked them or were too generous with the amount of flour.  I would suggest you fluff the flour with a fork before lightly measuring it out.    When I made them, I used 1 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips and 3/4 cup semi sweet.  I added 2 tsp of mint extract and 1 tsp vanilla to the melted chocolate.  I also only added 1 Tb of the water so it would firm up quicker in the fridge.  Be careful not to make the balls of dough too big because they really spread out while cooking.    These will be a keeper in our house.

This cookie has been a family favorite for years.TIP..Use parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets.You will cut back on calories a bit and cookie removal is quick and clean. I use the same sheet of paper for the whole batch. GOOD LUCK !!  YUMMY!!

This is a wonderfull recipe,I didn't change a thing. I did find that if you keep them in the icebox they stay fresh a whole lot longer and they taste great that way! My family just loves um! So try it that way and see if you agree with my findings. YUM,YUM,YUM

I uused the thin mint chips and mixed them in with the dough.  This was a lot easier and I'd seen previous reviews recommending this.  I thought this was just an ok cookie, the mint flavor was a little too strong for me and the cookies were crispier than I prefer.

Oh my, these are delicious! And so simple to make, since the recipe doesn't involve the perilous creaming method.  I experimented with both andes mints and halved ghirardelli chocolate mint squares and surprisingly preferred the andes mint hands down.  I also found that a spoon worked much better than a toothpick to swirl the chocolate at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super fantastic! The mint is a good surprise as most expect it to just be regular chocolate. I had absolutely no troubles with this recipe, it worked like a charm! I see many have different techniques for the spreading of the mint - just plop it on, wait about a minute and flip it over. Wait another minute and take the back of a spoon and spread. Use a knife if you want that swirled look with the mint color. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Very very good cookie, the kids thought they tasted just like brownies. I didn't have enough of the mint candies for each one so microwaved them and used a knife to ice each cookie.  Excellent!

the cookies were amazing, but one thing the recipe calls for thin mint cookies which in fact are girl scout cookies which in fact have nothing to do with this recipe; the recipe actually needs Andes Mints (the mint that you get in restaurants after dinner.) we wasted a lot of time and money on purchasing grasshoppers (thin mint substitute.)

They were good, I followed the recipe and the reviews respectively... and well, yeah.  They were good.  Nothing spectacular.  Then again, I don't know as if any chocolate mint cookie can compare to Hershey's Double Chocolate Mint Chip recipe on the back of the chocolate mint chip bag.

These cookies taste like a softer version of the Girl Scout thin mints.  Absolutely amazing. I used 1/2 an Andes mint on some and a full on others.  I prefer the 1/2 mint, but the boyfriend prefers the full.

These cookies were outstanding!!! The chocolate cookie without the mint is even great! I did as some readers suggested and put the mint on the top about a minute after they came out of the oven (after the cookie had flattened a bit). Then once it melted halfway I flipped all the mints over. Once I finished flipping a dozen of them they had melted enough for me to spread out the candy over the cookie like an icing. I put them on a plate in the fridge for about 3-5 minutes just until the mint hardened. It didn't seem to dry them out any and certainly sped up the process.

Wow - AMAZING cookies!  
They have a chewy texture and get better and better over the course of a few days.
I made slightly larger cookies than suggested and topped with one Andes mint each.  
Do not be intimidated by the multiple steps of this recipes or the many "tips you must follow to get it right" listed in the reviews.  They are great tips, but just relax and play around with these cookies - you'll do fine!  
I have eight and twelve year olds who can now make them independently and who had a blast making lots of batches to give holiday gifts.

This recipe has been around in my family for as long as i can remember.  I grew up with my mom making them around Christmas, never through out the year. It has become tradition for me now to make them around the holidays.  

There is a trick though that i know of that i havent seen in any reviews or in the recipe itself.. LINE YOUR PAN WITH FOIL.. and the cookies will turn out perfectly each time.. i spray a lil pam on the foil.. but just a tiny bit.  Hope it helps anyone out.. Enjoy

Fantastic!  I made these cookies for the county fair and won first prize in the chocolate cookie category.  At first, I used 1/2 a mint on each cookie but that was not enough as the chocolate did not spread over the entire cookie.  For the cookies I entered, I used the whole Andes mint.  It's easiest to spread the mint with the bottom of a fork to obtain a swirled pattern.  Great recipe...my brother says it's now his favorite cookie.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and chewy.  I couldn't find andes mints here in Canada so I bought Cadbury thins with mint pieces.  They come in a package of 6 which is just right for breaking up and putting on the cookies.  The only thing is that there is no green colour, so they look a little blah with brown on brown - but they taste great.

For the past 3 years, I have been making this cookie as well as Beth's Spicy Oatmeal cookies (from this site) and a white chocolate/cranberry/machademia nut cookie for gifts for my friends, neighbors and coworkers. So far this year, I have made 26 dozen cookies and tonight I will be baking another 15 dozen (at least). Today, my next door neighbor at work came over and asked me to bake him 2 dozen of these mint cookies and then he paid me $15 a dozen for them! That's how good these are!

I made these at Christmas time as one of the treats in my Christmas tins I gave out to teachers and they were really great.  A nice change from regular Christmas cookies.

The taste of the cookies is really good, however they aren't very good looking (they are bumpy on top).  I was going to give them as part of my cookie tray gifts but decided against it due to their appearance.  Used a whole Andes mint on each and swirled with a spoon.  One batch made 6 dozen.

The chocolate wafer was delicious and the finally application of the Andes mints was very easy. The only issue I had was the cookie really didn't seem to present well. I tried swirling the Andes mints with both a toothpick and a spoon to see if I could get a better swirl of the green mint through the chocolate. Just felt like I needed a "prettier" cookie for my Christmas cookie gifts.

These cookies are excellant!! Now would someone please come take them away?? If they stay in my house, I will eat every single one!!! I made these a bit smaller than directed because I wanted more cookies. I placed half of a mint on each. I think next time I will splurge and place an entire mint on each.

This cookie was terrific!  I used the exact ingredients listed in the recipe (using Andes candies) and it was delicious.  In order to ensure that the dough was adequately cooled, I chilled the balls of cookie dough on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator prior to baking.  Also, since I was using a dark cookie sheet, I lowered the oven temp to 325.  Lastly, after my first sheet of cookies, I decided to use parchment paper.  I would absolutely make these again!

Love these at holiday time! I’ve made them a number of times and never had an issue. Just be sure to follow the directions and let the chocolate mixture cool a little before you add eggs or they will cook before fully incorporated. Add 1/2 or 1 tsp peppermint extract if you really love the peppermint. Place on parchment paper to bake. I make small cookies using a small cookie scoop. They spread and are  flat so small looks best, then just add 1/2 of a candy on each one. Bite size and great addition to a cookie platter, they also freeze well.

My favorite holiday cookie!  These tasted so great.  I was a little leery of the batter when I pulled a rock of batter from my refrigerator, but it baked beautifully.  I couldn't find Andes mints anywhere, so I sprinkled Andes chips on top for the same effect.  I couldn't stop eating them!

These cookies have become a Christmas tradition at our house! I will say that the dough becomes very thick while mixing in the mixer (I broke a cheap handheld mixer one year on these) But these cookies are well worth it!

I took these cookies to a Christmas cookie exchange and won a prize for them. They are wonderful!!! I only used 1/2 Andes square on each and it was perfect.  I think any more would have made them too minty.  Thanks for the recipe.

A New fav!!Outstanding and easy cookie. I made about 5 dozen and used dollar store thin chocolate mints. Pressed them in the center after taking them from the oven. They look beautiful and taste great! Make sure you refrigerate dough for the full amount of time to make it easy to work with.

These are easily one of my favorite cookies.  They have been specially requested by my boyfriend different times.  I tried making them with no-name mint candies and found they didn't melt properly as the chocolate layer was too thick (had to put them in the oven for a minute to melt it).  I find After Eights work best.

I have made these cookies several times now and always get RAVE reviews. They are everyone's favorite. 

An awesome trick I use is to melt white chocolate on the tops of about half the batch instead of mint. They are to die for!

I've made these more than a dozen times and friends and coworkers are still begging me to make more! The melting of the chocolate and having to swirl it around is tedious so I will probably just add the mint pieces directly in the batter the next time I bake these. **using good quality ingredients (butter/chocolate chips) does matter and determine the outcome of your cookies

I didn't even get to try these because they were gone before I could!! But I'm guessing they were a five because they were a HUGE hit with everyone I made them for; I was told that there was practically a riot over them amongst the guys. This was about three months ago, and just today my friend mentioned them again and asked me to make them.

Presentation-wise, these were not the prettiest cookies I've baked but looks can sure be deceiving because, oh my, they tasted AMAZING. By far the best cookies I've made. The consistency came out perfectly chewy and with half an Andes mint melted on top and solidified, they really made for that extra something that made these cookies go from great to spectacular! The danger about them is they are addictive so of course be sure to share them with lots of people.

excellent cookies! I made them for the first time and they were very easy to make. I did not grease the pan, instead I used parchment paper which worked very well and I used Giradelli mint chocolates, I just cut them up.

After someone brought these cookies into work, I had to try to make them for myself.  One of the best cookies I've ever had! They were a huge success at my house.  They seemed fairly soft after coming out of the oven and a couple of them fell through the metal on the cooling rack. Next time I will put the andes mints on while still on the cookie sheet and then place them right in the fridge as another reviwer has suggested.  I also only used half a mint on each cookie which turnedo out great.  I will be making them again this week for Christmas. Great holiday cookie!

This is an amazing holiday cookie recipe. I've made several batches and am going to be making 5 or 6 batches this year. If you roll the dough between your palms until they are really smooth they will come out of the oven very very pretty. I make them in about 1 inch balls and only use half of an Andes mint on top. They're the perfect size for snacking and have a really festive flavor.

a great cookie for an exchange, and soo easy to make, I made them exactly as it is written and they come out soft every time, Do NOT overbake. when U put the mint candy on top, it deflates the cookie, but no worries, they come out perfect.

Holy Cow. These turned out great. Tastes like a mint brownie. I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of changes... I put a half cup of Andes in with 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and also I only refrigerated the dough for 20 minutes. They came out looking exactly like the pictures.

These were the bomb. All you really need to do is set the chocolates on the cookies after they're out of the oven. They will look solid (and sweaty) but they will be liquid enough to spread.

I use this recipe all time and they are always a hit. I recommend using margarine instead of butter for a thinner more brownie-like cookie. Either way these cookies are sure to please!

Amazing cookies! Made them as part of a birthday gift for a friend. I did use Andes chips instead of the mints as that is what I had. I also used about 1/2 cup of the andes chips in the mix because I was short of semi chips about that much. Also, I added 1 teaspoon of Coconut extract. (We love coconut.) :)  Everyone LOVES them!! Definitely adding them to my regular baking repertoire.

This was an aggressive attempt by me b/c I NEVER bake. I didn't realize how much work it would be but it definitely paid off. They came out amazing and look and taste wonderful! Since it makes a double batch and the cookie is just a chocolate cookie i made half the batch with the mint topping and the other half with peanut butter choco chips topping.

These cookies were a lot easier to make than I thought.  I think that I might have put a cup less of flour than called for by accident but they still turned out fantastic!  I made them for a Super Bowl party and they were a hit.  I counted out 40 Andes Mints and chopped the rest up to use as part of the choc chips that the recipe calls for.  This really intensified the mint flavour (which I love!)

I have to tell you that this is the best cookie recipe I've ever made.  The only change I made and it was very small was I added .5 cup of the chopped mints into the hot mixture and deleted .5 cup of the chocolate chips.  AMAZING..  We've made these many times and you just can't go wrong with these.  I use a round TBS scoop and drop them onto the cookie sheet like a ball.  No need to refridgerate either.  Perfectly round and don't over bake so that they come out nice and chewy. Enjoy!

Wow, possibly one of the best cookies I've ever baked..and I've baked a lot.  I made a couple of changes per the ingredients I had on had.  I used 1/2 cup regular chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup mint chocolate chips from trader joes to melt into the batter. Then I used the remaining mint chocolate chips and folded them into the final cookie batter for some chunks. I baked these closer to 8 min as I like my cookies pretty cakey. These came out incredible. Lots of compliments and lots of cookies! Will be making them again. :)

These cookies were delicious!! I followed the recipe verbatim except for that once I put the mint on top, I popped them back into the oven for 10 seconds and then swirled the mint in. The crispier these cookies are the better, but be careful not to overbake. These get done quickly!

I had to make mine Gluten Free--but this was one of those recipes that was easily altered... I just used 1/4 cup less of my gf flour mix and added 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum.  I really felt I was making the balls too small, only 1/2 T however they really expand so while they may seem too small...they will turn out perfect!  I eat them right out of the freezer and they remind me of the Thin Mints that I miss so much!! Thank you for the great recipe! It will be one of my regulars--throughout the holiday season and the year!! I like to eat them

These cookies could quite possibly be the best ever! u have now made them for the past 2 christmas's, and they are gone almost immediately.  Just be careful on the baking time - a minute too much and the cookies will be crunchy (if u like crunchy then its ok) ...but if u like chewy take them out immediately! They dont looked fully cooked - but once they cool u will have chewy cookies! enjoy!

Great cookie!  Soo yummy, I just can't get enough of it.  Relatively easy to make.  Turned out looking exactly like the ones in the picture.  Only baked it for 8 minutes and they came out soo chewy and soft.  Would make this over and over again!

These are great! Really easy to make and they are delicious.  I've made them a couple of times but this time I tried them with the Andes Cherry Jubilee candy and they are equally as good.  It was cute for Christmas.  I had some red (pink) and some green.

As written before, I would recommend not to "bake with your eyes"--the cookies will appear to be underbaked when taking them out of the oven--but do not fear (and overbaking makes them hard!).  Freezes well, and yummy!

I wanted to add a new recipe to a cookie exchange and this was a great pick!  Used Hershey's kisses (dark choc mint truffle) and Premium mint M&Ms.  No need to spread, just press into center after removing from oven.  Yum!

These are hands down the best cookie I've ever made! If I could rate this recipe more stars, I would. Not only are they delicious, this recipe also makes a ton of cookies. It does take a little extra effort to make them, but it is definately worth it!

These were great!!! A new holiday favorite! The cookies were soft and rich and the mint flavor was a great addition, without being too minty. I used a bag of Andes mint baking chips instead of the actual candies. After baking, I immediately pushed down on the middle of the cookies with the back of spoon to make a small well. Then added about a teaspoon of candies into each well. Once soft, spread candies with the back of a spoon and then topped with red, white and green candy sprinkles to give it some christmas color. They were absolutely delicious and looked festive too!

all the reviews are right on...best cookies ever.  I found that if you bake for exactly 8 min, take them out (you will think they aren't fully baked), place 1/2 an Andes in there...and then put them back in for 15 seconds it will allow you to spread them out better.

These taste great, but I found the dough very hard to work with. Refrigeration for one hour is not enough, but when I took the advice of another reviewer and refrigerated overnight, the dough turned into a slab of granite. Then, they did not bake all the way through. Perhaps a few hours in the fridge would be ideal.

Oh man...oh man...oooooh man these are AMAZING! Next time I'm going to try them without the mint - mostly because I don't normally have them on hand and they're pricey. I just KNOW they're going to be amazing! ooh man these are out of this world.

The taste was good, but they didn't really seem to hold up very well. After a few days they were fairly stale, even though the other cookies I had made the same day (peanut butter blossoms and sugar cookies) were still fresh and chewy.

These are a must bake!  I was baking them for friends as I am not a big fan of mint and chocolate, but I cannot stop eating them myself.  1/2 Andes per cookie is plenty and make sure to put the imprinted side of the candy face down.

I made these for the first time as a last-minute addition to my holiday cookie trays and I'm so glad I did. They've been a BIG hit, people are begging for more of them. They're sooo easy to make too. I just mixed everything right in the saucepan and it was fine. 

I refrigerated the dough overnight and also put the mints in the freezer for awhile before placing them on the cookies. I'm making at least one more batch before the holidays are over.

Made these little gems two times now this holiday sesaon with a slight variation....used Andes Peppermint Crumbles (found in the baking isle during Christmas season) on top instead of the regular Andes mint.  You don't have to spread the crumbles, just put them on top while the cookies are still hot...they will melt a bit, then harden and stick to the cookie once cool. In case you are wondering...no, they are not just crushed candy canes.  They are more like a peppermint chocolate chip with tiny bits of candy cane mixed in. Otherwise, left the recipe as is.  And let me just say, they are D-LISH.  If not my all-time favorite cookie now, they certainly are my favorite holiday cookie.

Even though they were a bit on the buttery side, I'm still giving these cookies 5 stars. They're addicting, and they really do taste like girl scout cookies - but they're chewy! I didn't like the idea of having green and brown swirls on my cookies, so here's what I did: I melted Ande's baking pieces (they're the exact same thing as the regular mints, only chopped up and cheaper) in a double boiler and mixed it so it was a uniform color. Then I took the cooled cookies, flipped them upside down,and twisted the tops in the melted mint chocolate. This covered the cookies very evenly and made them look much better than the method I tried first, which was spooning the melted chocolate onto the cookies and then spreading it with the back of the spoon. If you use this method, please let the chocolate cool a little bit before you start dipping - I got some on my fingers and would hate for anybody to get burned!

i love these cookies.  instead of using andes mints, i used junior mints.  i put 2 mints for every cookie.  once i took them out of the oven, i put the mints on them, then put back in the oven for a minute or so, then used the backside of a spoon and smeered the mints over the cookie.  then after about 10 minutes in the fridge, i put a small layer of milk chocolate icing on top, then refridgerated again.  happy holidays to everyone!!

Wonderful recipe. I made these exactly as the recipe stated, except that I didn't grease my pans at all. I had no trouble whatsoever with sticking. I agree with another reviewer that these taste like Thin Mints, but better. I like the chewy-gooeyness of these better than the crispness of Thin Mints. The cookies are as beautiful looking as they are tasting. They will make an excellent addition to my Christmas cookie trays and to my recipe box!

These cookies are AMAZING!  Taste just like a girl scout thin mint.  Instead of melting a candy on top, I used a bag of chopped andies candies mixed into the batter.  Second time I made them, I split the batter in two and added peanut butter chips to one, and the mints to the other.  Both were delicious.  My husband and son actually liked the peanut butter ones better, my daughter and I liked the mint ones better.  I think from now on when I make these I will have to do the half & half batch again.  Definately a keeper!

Very, very good! It was hard to tell when they were done because they stay SOOO poofey and soft while in the oven, but as long as I took them out after 10 minutes regardless of what they looked like, they were still nice and chewy. The first batch was crunchy. I also turned my oven down to 325 after the first batch, but I just think my oven is goofy.

I used the Andes baking ships, which are crushed andes mints, and I think it resulted in a prettier product than the whole mints. I used a 10oz bag for the whole batch. 

I put half the batch in the freezer for gift trays for Christmas, so lets home a few weeks in the freezer doesn't ruin their flavor and texture. 

I'll definitely be making these again, probably in a few weeks!! I might try to find a chocolate cookie recipe that uses cocoa powder though for a more economical cookie since the mints are pricey.

I didn't have butter, so I subbed with shortening and these are the most delicious cookies I've ever made! I also topped them with a Hershey kiss as they came out of the oven. They're good, but the tops of the cookies deflated a little... I also was baking these with another batch of cookies, so I baked them at 330 for 10ish minutes.

I had the worst luck with these cookies. They ran all over the pan! A few would look really good, others ok and atlease one would be horrible looking! They tasted good though.

I have to agree with all of you~ delicious. The tip about putting them in the refrigerator was great, it set up the mint in no time. I did take them back out to eat them though. I'll be make these again.

These are so good!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!  I used a tablespoon cookie scoop and ended up with a little over six dozen cookies.  I had 2 boxes of the Andes Mints and used 1/2 mint per cookie and had plenty of mints left over.    Thank you for a great recipe!

Love these cookies!  Watch the mints as they melt because they slide off the cookie very easily.  I only used 1/3 of the mint for each cookie and it was plenty. (I think they're making andes mints bigger these days.)

These were really pretty to look at.  The andes mints gave a great flavor.  I made some with the traditional chocolate mint andes, but also found cherry chocolate, and the pink swirled in was beautiful.  Sadly, they didn't taste quite as good as they looked.  

The actual cookie part lacked something, though I won't pretend to know what that was.  Everyone who tasted them loved the mints and the beauty but said the cookie was just so-so.

Delicious!  This was a favorite in my family's annual Christmas Cookie Baking Day extravaganza.  To me, they tasted a lot like a Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie.

Next time I make them, I will be looking for ways to dress up the presentation.  I would advise using the green Andie's Candies for contrast against the dark brown cookie.  I used the brown candies with the green middle, and you don't really notice the green at all.

Also, I scaled the recipie to make 60 servings, and we ended up with twice that amount!

Really yummy!  I have a severe sweet tooth so I used milk chocolate chips - delicious.  Next time I'm going to use half a mint on each of the cookies.  With semi-sweet chips, a whole mint would probably be great.

HELP! I've tried this recipe many times and no matter what, the chocolate seizes. I've tried adding very gradually, melting the chocolate first then adding, and it always seizes. I tried to save it by reheating everything together to combine but all the oil separated and I had to throw it away.

I have made this cookie for 25+ years.  When I got the recipe from a lady who was a very experienced baker who would provide her product for catered events, the instructions said to line your baking sheet with aluminum foil - do not grease.  The key is to make the ball a little smaller than 1 inch and bake them no more than 10 minutes!!!!  They appear very soft but they remain chewy.  Also, put only 1/2 a mint on top.  Let sit for a bit so the chocolate softens and swirl with the back of the spoon.

I really think the key is a foil lined sheet!  It has worked for 25 years so far and then your cookie is not greasy at all.

Love love love this recipe! As others noted, do not overcook - mine are usually done by 8-9 minutes. I find it easiest to work with when the dough is only chilled for 1-2 hours. Finally, now that they sell Andes chips (like chocolate chips but crumbled Andes instead), no more unwrapping individual candies! I find one bag will do a whole batch.

These are my favorite cookies!  Instead of greasing pans, I used Reyonds Baking Sheets.  I doubled the recipe, which made about 100 cookies.  I did find the baking time was longer on my stove, about 15 minutes.  Another comment stated hers got hard.   Dr.  Oz just had a show where if you add a piece of regular white bread to lay on top of covered cookies, it makes them soft again.  Haven't tried it yet, but thought I'd pass along.

A nice, chewy cookie, as long as you don't over cook them.  They are a thinner cookie and flatten a bit upon cooling.  Don't wait to put the mint on the hot cookie.....just set HALF a mint on each cookie as comes out of the oven, let set for a minute or two, take offset spatula or knife and gently spread the melted mint over the cookie.  A favorite in our house.

Terrific recipe. No problems the first time trying.  I didn't even offer one to my husband as he doesn't like mint. He wandered through the kitchen and popped one in his mouth. "Hmmm.  These are really good", he exclaimed.  Coulda knocked me over with a feather. I will be adding this recipes to my personal cookie arsenal!

These are amazing!  I baked on my stoneware so I didn't have to mess with grease. 10 min perfect. I used 1/2 a mint per cookie and followed the previous suggestion by flipping each mint as it was melting. Waited for the mint to melt completely and smoothed the mint around with the back if the spoon. I'm sending these to a bake sale tomorrow and I know they will be a big hit! :)

Cooked for 8 minutes and they turned out great.  These are by far the best cookie I've ever made, but then again I love chocolate and mint together.  AMAZING!

Seriously the best cookies I've ever made (not that I've made many, but I like to think of myself as a connoisseur:) I subbed a cup of mint chocolate & put mint chocolate chunks on top. They're so addictive. 5+ stars.

After all the amazing reviews I had to try this. Great cookie if you LOVE mints. It really just tasted like a mint to me but the cookie without the mint tasted like a brownie so I started playing with other ideas. A Rolo candy wrapped and baked in this cookie dough is fabulous! I'm currently adding pecans and a Rolo simply because the cookie with the mint was a bit too rich for me. I felt it needed something salty!

I loved these cookies. You have to be a chocolate and mint lover to enjoy them this much. They are very sweet. My husband wasn't as fond of them but he doesn't like sweets so I will still rate them all thee way up. I will make them again :)

They were good but not outstanding. Mine turned out soft. I think others were overbaking. Bake for 8 min. total and wll have a soft cookie. Use parchment paper so they won't flatten. Will probably alter the recipe next time by using mint chips in the cookie dough and white chocolate on top.

Really good cookie recipe! I've using mint chips which I add to the top of the cookie halfway through baking when I rotate my cookie sheet. Agree with others, they are easy to overcook so take them out on the early side & let cook on cookie sheet.

I followed the recipe exactly, cooked the first batch for 8 minutes. The top and edges of the cookie were cooked. I then added the mint, then let them cool on the cookie sheet for 10 min before attempting to remove them. When I tried to use the spatula to get them off the cookie sheet, disaster struck. The center of the cookie where the mint melted buckled, and the cookie would only come off the pan in a U shape. It was a big gooey mess. In my second batch, I cooked them for 10 min. Exact same result. Having a cookie taste good doesn't make up for the fact that it doesn't actually look like a cookie.

These are fantastic!! I read through the ingredient list too quickly and missed the chocolate chips. I still had about 1/4 cup left at home, but I substituted Andes mint chips for the rest. Those melted fairly quickly in the saucepan, and it was not as thick as I thought it should have been. I added 1/4 cup of cocoa to the mixture to thicken it, and after mixing the rest of the ingredients in, the dough turned out nicely. I put it in the fridge overnight and baked the next day. For those of you who said yours came out greasy - use parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet! Mine were not oily at all. Everyone loved them, even with the extra mintyness!

These are now a family favorite!  Better than the thin mint girl scout cookies! (And I love them) Perfectly chewy!  As suggested, I put them in the freezer to set-PERFECT!  Also, I only use 1/2 a mint, my cookies were a rounded Tablespoon size and that is the perfect balance of chocolate and mint for us!

These cookies are the best, every year I get asked if I will please make them. One year I ran out of the chocolate morsels & only had 1 1/2 cups. & they were still fantatic. I now only use 1 1/2 cups. Most bags of morsels are only 12 oz. & that seems to be just wonderful.

This is the best cookie recipe I've tried in a LONG time! I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of mint extract to the cookie dough and it was wonderful.

It's funny because I'd never heard of Andes mints before until I read the comments here and happened to find some at the drugstore. They were in the holiday section so they might just be a holiday item.

Easy and a fan favorite.  I've used Hershey mint kisses, Dove peppermint nuggets and Andes candies, all work.  I suspect peppermint bark would work as well.
I bake on parchment paper so the pan-greasing is non an issue.  
The trick for me is to get the dough chilled but not so hard I can't scoop it.  That's trial and error.

Amazing!!  Just made these and they are now going on to the top of my christmas cookie list.  I made the cookies a little smaller and used 1/2 a mint for each cookie so now I have more cookies (this is good because my kids gave them double thumbs ups!)  Will definitely make again.

AMAZING. Added a sprinkle of crushed Candycane to the swirled mint to add some Christmas flair.

These turned out really nicely and are very rich and delicious. I left the dough in the fridge overnight and it was hard as a rock in the morning. I was afraid I'd ruined it, but I managed to scoop it out and shape it into balls and they baked up fine.

I found I had to put them back in the oven for 30 seconds to get the chocolate to melt - probably because I didn't have the right kind of chocolates, I couldn't find thin mints so I used small bits of mint chocolate bar.

I made these for the first time yesterday.  I omitted the mint since I was making plain chocolate cookies as a birthday gift for my dad.  I flattened the balls of cookie dough on the cookie sheet & cooked them for 10 minutes.  They were PERFECT!  I will be making them again tonight for my family to keep & enjoy.

Very tasty, but very time comsuming. They are quite rich, so I made smaller cookies and ended up with 6 dozen that are just the right size.

I loved the coolness that the mint candy brought to the cookie. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the mint over-powered the chocolate. Next time, I'm going to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also melted whole mints ontop of the cookies despite what some reviews said. I think the cookies would have been too bland without whole mints ontop.

These are super-chocolately and have a brownie-like texture.  The kids loved them.  We couldn't find thin mints so I used Ghiradelli mint-filled squared which melted and worked just fine.  They are a bit too rich and chocolately for me.

I first made these last year for my niece at Christmas. She loves Andes Mints, and chocolate..so, perfect fit. I used Andes Mints until I ran out. The rest I used the Hershey Kisses Mint Truffles on. They worked very well, almost the same taste. This year I made them again,using the mint swirl kisses on part of them.Came out nicely, still minty, but with a pink color. This recipe is a keeper for me.

This is my go-to recipe for Christmas cookies.  Everyone loves them, and they keep well.  I bake the cookies on parchment paper rather than greasing the cookie sheets.

I am obsessed with these cookies, and when I share them with others I'm proud to say I made them.  I brought these cookies to a potluck last weekend and everyone LOVED them.  My friends went back for multiple cookies and said they "put those girl scout cookies to shame".  This recipe is seriously amazing.

Ohh my! So delicious! I baked for 9 min and that was perfect! I used 1/2 an andies mint on each and the mint taste was strong. I think a whole mint would've been too much. I put the mint on the cookie for about 1 min. then just turned it over with a toothpick. It made a perfect swirl design and let it melt the rest of the way! I got 4 dozen cookies from one batch!

These are wonderful. I broke the thin mints in half and that worked fine. Served to friends and the comment was 'to die for.'  Doubled the recipe, makes a lot. Melting chocolate, butter & sugar together makes it really easy. Will make these again.

These were a huge hit.  My husband and friends compared them to GS Thin Mint cookies, but said they were better.  I used the andes chips rather than the wrapped thin mints.

Awesome soft chocolate cookie! I used Andes mints on the top, and put them in the freezer for a few minutes after spreadnig the mint over the cookie to harden the melted chocolate and make them stackable. The cookies stayed soft was worried they wouldn't. I will make these again very addicting to eat.

This cookie is very good but I wouldnt say the BEST. I will make again though. If you want the cookie to look anything like the photo smash down the dough in the shape of a cookie. Otherwise you get a ball cookie. I made a golf ball size of dough and smashed that down to look like a cookie and put 2 mints on it.

So good as is, went really fast at the holiday party.  To make even better, I used 60% bittersweet chips instead of semisweet, and added some baking cocoa (not sure amt, maybe 1/4 cup or less).  Made really rich.  Freeze well.

I accidentally used junior mints instead of the andes mints.  They obvioulsy didn't melt as well but they still added the mint kick to the cookies.  These aren't extremely difficult to make except that they are done well before they look done.

All I can say is WOW these are good.  I used Necco thin mints and the cookies look really great.  These are so easy and taste so good.  They are going to be my new bake sale cookie.

These cookies are very good!  I thought the dough took a while to make but maybe that's just me.  I agree with everyone else.... do NOT over cook!  Mine only needed 8 minutes tops.  I found the Andes mints in a bag and was able to break them in half and it was more than enough to cover the top of the cookie.

Tried this recipe without any modifications and my cookies turned out perfectly. I made a batch to "try" before participating in a cookie exchange. Definitely think these will make the exchange.

DELICIOUS!!! These cookies are amazing! The only thing I changed was using 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips. This is only because I am not a fan of dark chocolate. I also took the advice of other reviewers and took them out after 8 minutes exactly. GREAT RECIPE!!!!

I love these cookies and so does my 2yr old.  I did try to make them a little bit healthier and used 3/4 cups splenda brown sugar and 1/2 butter and 1/4 light margarine and they still turned out fantastic.  This is a must make every year for us at the Holidays.

Made exactly as written and they were the best chocolate cookies I've ever had. I baked 3 dozen and gave them to friends and family as part of a cookie collection for the holidays... and everyone loved these the most. They will be my go-to cookie from now on!

These have a similar flavor to girl scout cookies!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE these!  Instead of using chocolate covered thin mints, I have also used Andes Mints, which are wonderful!  An excellent holiday cookie!

I like to try and reduce calories in all my cooking, and these cookies take it like a champ. I made the cookies with half and half splenda brown sugar and low fat butter. They came out great, still delicious and beautifully formed. I made the mistake of buying the no name mint thins though ( all I had was $3 in change ), they didn't taste so great. I very much suggest you buy the proper mint thins. Also, the base cookie is so nice you could put other things in the middle. Next time I'm going to try mini peanut butter cups.

This cookie is very rich! I could only eat one and a half and usually i can eat a dozen :).  Making these i only used half a mint for each cookie because i think i made the cookies smaller and anymore mint would have been over powering. I crushed up candy cane and sprinkled it on top of some of them and put some CANDY cane in the dough of others and baked them. I also tried usuing different mints (misty mints) to melt on top which were green, pink yellow and orange. They looked really pretty with the candy cane sprinkles.  I melted 2-3 of these on top since they were smaller and found that 2 little mints works just fine. Thanks for the recipe though. It can be tweaked in so many different way! Next time i might try melting a chocolate caramel on top and put chunks of white chocolate in the batter!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is ALWAYS a hit. This one cinched my status as "cookie lady" for my son's 6th grade class. Andes Mints now makes baking pieces which can be mixed into the cookie dough instead of using the full-sized mints on the top. This cookie is still tasty several days after baking, so I sent some in a care package to my daughter at college.

I made a batch of these for my Dad and Bro and while I was sleeping my Dad at all the extras I had set aside for me and my room mates lol. But its ok because I just made more and put in 2 tea of peppermint flavoring into the batter. Much better. I warmed the butter/sugar/choco chips in the microwave using the defrost setting. And the second time I greased the cookie sheet, very good idea. The first time they spread like crazy but I think that was because the refrig door didnt close all the way when they were being chilled. The second time they didnt spread enough and I had to push them down a little.

This cookie is so gooood! I made a batch and sent them home with my brother inlaw. He was driving from visiting with us in San francisco back to his home in Los Angeles. The drive is about 6 hours long and not one of those cookies made it! He ate every single bite! I didn't need to change a thing, perfect as is.

These chocolate cookies are DELICIOUS! This was my first time making home-made cookies & Im glad I chose this recipe. Not only were they super easy to make, but they turned out great for a first timer. A little crisp on the outside, moist & soft on the inside. I agree with another review... Yummy either way, but taste best when completely cooled.

These cookies really are wonderful. They stay soft for days! The only drawback is that they are very putsy and take quite a bit of time. If time isn't an issue for you, then they are a great holiday cookie. I used them for a cookie exchange at Christmas time and they got rave reviews.

These are good, but very rich. Make them smaller and use 1/2 of a mint candy. I made these for two friends who like chocolate mint candies. They liked them, but no "wow" factor.

Another 5 star rating! These were the favorite of the 7 Christmas cookie recipes I made this year. I sprinkled Andes baking chips on cookies - no swirling required. I also mixed everything in the original pan and left the dough in the fridge overnite. Set out to soften about 1 hr. before shaping. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made these several times.  They are easy and delicious!  Parchment paper works great.  I use a small (~1T) cookie scoop and half a mint per cookie (yields ~6 dozen cookies).  Since the cookies are rich, this is a nice size.  There are 28 mints in the usual Andes package, so you'll need a little more than one package if you make them this size and use a half mint each.  At 10 minutes, they come out a little puffy and underdone-looking, but they deflate quickly and assume a perfect crunchy, chewy texture as they cool.

Fantastic! I made this yesterday for a cookie exchange. I am making more today. 
I followed recipe exactly and baked for nine minutes. This was the fave in the group! Easy, easy easy and delicious!

I made these for a chirstmas party and they were a huge ...I am not a big chocolate mint fan so instead of using the thin mints I used mint buds ...a little less minty taste and even I ate my fair share

Excellent cookies.  People are still talking about this cookie, months after they had it.  This is by far the best cookie I have ever made.

OMG everyone must try these cookies at some point.  I am not a chocolate cookie gal but these were fabulous.  I was hesitant about the consistency when they were freshly baked.  However, give them a day to settle and they are the most wonderful chewy and chocolately cookies you've ever had.  They remind me of chewy Girl Scout Grasshopper cookies but with more flavor.

This recipe is simple, delicious and fun to make. I made it last year for my girl's christmas cookie weekend and it was a big hit. This has been added to our christmas cookie recipes that will be pasted down to our daughters.

I made these for my professor and since the recipe yields alot of cookies, she shared them with the chemistry department. I made these a couple weeks ago and Im still hearing about how good these were!! Everyone keeps asking me for the recipe. I definitely reccomend these and make sure you use Andes mints. Also, as some of the other reviewers said, take them out at exactly 8-10 minutes or they will be overdone. They dont look like theyre cooked all the way but they are.

i was so excited to make these because of all the raves it got but frankly, i'm disappointed. i followed the recipe exactly. i think 8 minutes for these cookies is a bit too long. mine ended up drier than i would have liked although the mint chocolate did help. the balls of dough don't spread very much, these come out looking like crinkles.

These are delicious. I brought them to a graduation party and got RAVE reviews from everyone. I followed to a T. I personally thought the cookies were delish even without the mint. I did put 1/2 a mint on some, a full one on the smaller cookies seemed to be too much. But delicious!!!

Awesome cookie!!  Every month I try to make new cookies and within the past year this one is by far the best - will add to the Christmas list!  At first I was concerned that the candy would not melt but by the time I finished placing candy on the last cookie the first one was ready to be spread.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!

Another 5-star rating -- we loved these cookies!  I found that I had to let the mint set for several minutes (not just one) before it was soft enough to spread, but otherwise, the recipe went off without a glitch.  I'm already thinking ahead to Christmas - these will be great for my neighborhood cookie swap!

Before making these, I read a review where it is described in great detail how to make the mint melt and swirl properly -- giving me the impression that these were going to be difficult, and that I was going to have to play around with them to get them to look good.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  When the cookies were done baking, I immediately put a whole mint on top of each cookie.  After placing each mint, I immediately took a spoon and swirled each mint.  My cookies came out perfectly swirled and beautiful.  I don't think there's really any reason to make this more complicated than it has to be.  I've baked better chocolate cookies, but as far as the mint aspect of this cookie goes, it was a brilliant idea and all too easy for the attractive and impressive result!

This cookie is definaltely good! I was eating the dough as fast as I could get the things cooked! The description is good- they "melt in your mouth" more than other cookies. It is just a very smooth, soft cookie. I will make this one over and over again!

These were very good! Not spectacular but very good nonetheless.
I admit it's a lot of work, but if u love mint, you'll love these cookies.

My cookies lack crunchiness, but perhaps that happen coz i reduced the sugar (with 200gr, the sweetness is just perfect, not too sweet, but still sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth).
I use parchment paper so i didn't grease the pan, and it still slides of easily.

Oh, and they didn't spread much too.

I am so grateful for this site because I have found absolutely the best cookie recipes here.  I made these for my boyfriend (who I bake cookies for every 2 weeks or so - he's in the navy) and each week he declares the cookies I sent "the best ever".  Well these were no exception.  He said they are the best cookies he's ever tasted and all of his fellow navy friends all gushed about them too.  As a cholcoate/mint lover myself, these tasted absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe to a tee. Thank you!

We loved these, and my 7-yr old wants to take them to class for his birthday. The only change I made was to use 2 C mint chocolate chips (very minty!) and 1/2 piece of After 8's on each cookie.

Easy, delicious, and got rave reviews.  I used an Andes mint on each and just let it melt and then swirled it around - they looked very nice.

These cookies are amazing! Rich, fudgy, chewy mmm... I made mine fairly big and used a whole andes mint, swirling them around with the back of a spoon. They are fabulous with the mint, but could just as easily be used as a base for other chocolate cookies as well.

i had to find out what the rave was all about and i must say, i'm pretty glad i was a curious cat with this one.  this recipe is EXACTLY the same as the chocolate mint cookies I in the site, except the topping is different.  if you're wondering, without the topping this cookie taste like brownies in a cookie form.  and another thing, i used some hershey's huggs to substitute the andes, and they didn't spread nicely but they were tasty.  (overall, delicious but not the best.)

I love this recipes.  Each time I have made it, they are gone in a few seconds!  It is a little tricky when putting the mint on the cookie.  Make sure to have all of the mints unwrapped and ready to work with.  It works best if you wait about 1 minute for the cookie to cool then add the mint to the top.  Let the mint stay on the cookie for a few seconds then flip over and swish around with a toothpick or a small sppon.  You may not get the white/green color variation....but they still taste awesome!

So I made this recipe exactly as stated except instead of the chocolate mint candy, I mixed in crushed candy canes.  The cookie part was absolutely delicious, but the only thing wrong with my variation was that some of the candy cane chunks were too big and melted all over the place.  It wasn't a mess to clean up after it cooled, but it looked messy.  Otherwise taste and texture were great.  Next time I might add some peppermint oil to make it even mintier.

WOW, these are really easy, delicious, and attractive-- but look and taste like you slaved!  As suggested by others, wait just long enough for the candy to start melting and carefully flip it over with a toothpick so the green center can be swirled on top.

This cookie was very good. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. One word about this recipe, though - after I refrigerated the dough, it was hard as a rock! I mean hard as in I could barely cut it with a knife! Rolling into balls was amazingly difficult.

SO EASY TO MAKE!  I was worried after reading some of the reviews because they seemed a little involved, but I can't emphasize how easy these are!  And the taste is amazing!!  My batch made about 60 cookies (I guess mine were a bit smaller!) and I used half an Andes mint on each cookie.

This was good.  I made it according to the recipe, with the exception of adding 1 tsp peppermint extract to the dough.  It is important to chill the dough before trying to roll it into balls!  I rolled mine into balls and then froze them so I can pull out a few at a time to bake.  They're very good!  Be patient with the candy on top - I expected it to melt faster.  It does take a few minutes to melt enough to spread it around, but it will work eventually!  All in all, a very good cookie!

These will satisfy a choclate craving after the first bite!  I was worried while making them that they would not be sweet enough, but they are so rich, I wouldn't want them any sweeter!  Plus, the andes mint candy on top takes care of the sweet factor.  YUMMY!

This recipe worked very well and everyone loved them!  The chocolate cookie dough works well on its own or with the mint! I would definitely suggest using only half (or less) of the mint.  The first time baking this cookie, I used whole Andes and found the mint to over power the cookie and completely lose the taste of the chocolate dough.  
Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone who tasted these loved them.  They were gone in two days.  My mother asked me to make them for her school.  After the first couple batches came out of the oven, I started putting two Andes mints on each cookie, and the topping ended up thicker and tastier.  Next time I make these, I will put two mints on each cookie - makes it all the better for chocolate/mint lovers.  Some people told me they tasted like Girl Scout Thin Mints only chewier.

These were my contribution to a Labor Day potluck and they were simply devoured! I got so, so many compliments on them. We put them in the freezer for a couple of hours before serving and it really gave the mint flavor a kick!

Wow!  very good.  I had a difficult time finding thin mints in the grocery store, so I ended up buying Junior Mints, and used 2 per cookie.  Worked out great, and tasted awesome.  Thanks!!

I was looking for a new cookie.  I make the perfect chocolate chip cookie and everyone asks for them, but I was tired of the same old thing. I have tried multiple other recipes but this was by far the best!  Wow - is the first thing my teenage son said.  Thanks!

I make this recipe every Christmas, and have even gotten requests for these cookies instead of birthday cake!  I always follow the recipe exactly (if it ain't broke...), though I've occasionally run out of Andes mints and used various flavors of Hershey kisses as a substitute.

These were great.  I ended up with 60-70 cookies.  I had to cut the mints in half so they wouldn't spill over the sides of the cookies once they melted.

These are so very rich and delicious!  They are almost like a brownie with mint chocolate frosting!  I used Mrs. Fields mints, because I couldn't find Andes, and they taste wonderful!  They aren't as pretty as some of the other Christmas cookies I made, but the taste is out of this world if you love chocolate and mint.

Delicious!  I'm not sure what size cookies other reviewers are making, but I made walnut (slightly larger) sized balls and ended up with about 40 cookies.  After pressing the candies into the hot cookies, I "stirred" them with the flat handle of a plastic fork and it worked very well.  These cookies are awesome and I'm looking forward to serving them at my cookie exchange!

I will make these again.  I used 1/2 a Andie's Mint on each cookie. I wish my peppermint extract bottle was not empty. I forgot that I kept the brown glass one because they are all plastic now days. But the cookies were good. 

They were not pretty cookie tray cookies. The green swish is odd - but all in all they were YUMMY. I took them into work on trays with other cookies. Once people found them they disappeared fast.

My only suggestion is to press the mint patty into the cookie at 8 minutes and return it to the oven for 2 more minutes. While warm, the mint patty is like a chewy marshmallow...

I liked this but it was not minty at all. As a plain chocolate cookie, it was delicious. I am planning to mint mine out by melting some Andes candies and drizzling it over the top.

This is the best recipe!  I melted a whole Andes mint on top and then sprinkled the Andes pieces on top of that after they’d cooled slightly!  So good!!!

These are a new favorite in my family.  I also used a Dove peanut butter square instead of Andes mints and they were also excellent!  I've made so many batches this holiday season, everyone keeps asking for them.  I followed directions and chilled dough and had no issues.

Bake these on a foil lined cookie sheet- it is a must for these cookies. I have been baking these for over 35 years and always line the baking sheet with foil. Also I recommend using half and mint. These are one of my favorite cookies to bake in the holiday's.

I LOVE this recipe when a friend made them. I will be making them soon. It looks like it will be easy, I'm not much of a cook so hoping they come out as good as hers.
  again Fabulous tasting recipe.

Super delicious cookies!!! I took notes from others that made it and put the mints on top and then put them back in the oven for 10-15 seconds- it made it super easy to spread around. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out SO TASTY! They were an absolute hit at the party I took them to

I have made these cookies every year for 20 years. They are the quintessential Christmas cookie and always a hit.  Andes Mints sells many flavors of mints and I have used all the flavors. Stores used to sell all the flavors, but not any more. Order them online. The Cherries Jubilee works fabulous. The peanut butter is good as well. Here is  their 4 pack: https://www.amazon.com/Andes-Thins-Pack-Jubilee-Peppermint/dp/B01M299A41/ref=sr_1_9_s_it?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1545692410&sr=1-9&keywords=andre%2Bmints&th=1

I refrigerated the dough overnight because I ran out of time.  Worked out great.  I used a tablespoon measuring spoon and cooked them straight from the refrigerator for 9 minutes.  Came out chewy like a brownie and good size.

Yummy and easy to make. Chocolate  and mint, what's not to like? 
I made half with the Andes candies and half with small York patties, both delicious.  Baked 10 minutes.

Easy recipe, baked cookies for 9min. and they came out perfect! Only substitution was I didn’t have Andes candy so I used York patties that part was a little difficult because they didn’t melt as easy! But they still taste great! Will make again, very nice chocolate cookie!

Excellent! I surprised my (adult) daughter and her friends with some cookies for their holiday gift exchange. They were very impressed. My supermarket didn't have any Andes, so I used Junior Mints Perfect size for the centers. Pretty enough that it isn't necessary to burst and spread with a toothpick, but I did so to spread the flavor a bit. I would definitely make these again!

These are sooooo good, very sweet. I let the dough rest for a few hours in the fridge, made it very easy to deal with. I used Andes Mints.

Delicious! I exchanged the water for hot coffee, as it enriches the flavor of the chocolate. I only used 1/2 of an Ande's Mint Candy on top of each cookie and that was plenty.

I used After Eight mints since I couldn't find Andes mints. I also should've made the balls bigger than walnut, as they came out smaller than expected. I also decorated with Christmas colors to add to the festive presentation. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the "T" and I'll be making it again. Love it.

I made these yesterday I wanted a chocolate mint mix for my Christmas cookies.  They turned out awesome!  They are the family's favorite!  I also brought some to my co-workers, and they were a big hit with them too!  Love the mints melted in to the top.  I used Andes Mints which are afave in out house,  Hersheys Mint Kisses would be good too, may try this next time!  Love the Recipe!  Thanks Jackie!

I did make changes, I used Andi candy pieces a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of  macadamian nut pieces.  I also made chocolate frosting and used a teaspoon of peperment flavor in it. I suggest you start with a half teaspoon, test then add more if you wish. The cookies are excellent, moist, delicious. My grandson (15) takes home made cookies once or twice a week for his lunch friends. Everyone enjoyed these. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are wonderful chocolate cookies. I will definitely make them again. They are chewy and chocolatey and the candy glaze on top makes them fantastic. I didn't have any chocolate mint candies so I used Hershey's Chocolate Kisses and they turned out great. This change eliminated the mint flavor, but the result was just as yummy.

Super easy yet tasty recipe. I made this for a cookie exchange and then again for my children's Christmas school parties and they were a HIT! The melted mint chocolates (I use Andes) were perfect.

TIP: don't wait. Put the candy on top of the cookies almost immediately when you pop them out of the oven so that they fully melt and you can use 1/2 of a candy per cookie.

These turned out perfect, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a small 2 tsp cookie scoop and it ended up being the perfect size; these turn out quite rich, so I wouldn't recommend making them big.  Rave reviews from co-workers, husband (and his co-workers), and family!

I don't actually know what the size of a walnut is so mine were a little bit small and ended up baked perfectly and not a bit underbaked. I also through half of the dough in the freezer to make later. If you make them a bit small like me, i would knock off a minute on your cooking time.

These are super easy to make. I ended up with a lot more cookies than I expected. 1/2 mint is more than enough to melt on top of each cookie.

Delicious as always.  This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  I use Andes mints on the top.  These cookies provide a very light minty flavor on top of rich chocolate.

A nice, gooey cookie. Instead of chocolate chips, I used mint chocolate chips and it was great. Also, I could not find Andes thin mints, so I melted Guarendelli mint chocolate squares and drizzled over them. Also, I placed them in the fridge for a few minutes for the chocolates chocolate drizzle to set.

This cookie has become a family favourite for the holiday season. I have experimented with the mint chocolate used. I like the darker chocolate flavour that half an after eight wafer gives. My kids prefer the taste of the mint aero. I always make some of both.

Made exactly as written and they came out perfectly.  I thought about adding a couple drops of mint extract and I'm glad I didn't, these are perfectly minty with half an Andes mint  on top.  Phenomenal cookie.

Nice cookies! I modified a bit to cut down the sweetness. I used 1 cup packed light brown sugar and 1/2 piece of Andes mint chocolate. Also substituted 1/4 cup butter with margarine. Baked 8 minutes. Turned out very nice!

I made this recipe as directed, except adding in Andes baking bits in with the dough before baking to make them extra minty. The dough sat overnight before baking, making it necessary to let the dough sit at room temp for awhile before rolling out the cookies. These taste delicious, and I can't wait to share them with family and friends!

Just baked these yesterday for the first time with my girlfriend for our annual all day Christmas Baking Marathon! I chose this cookie because it looked good and easy! First, we made the dough according to the instructions and instead of using the mint chocolates, we used the Hershey's peppermint kisses which looked so festive! I have very thin non-stick baking sheets so no spraying or greasing was necessary!  Also, we waited about 30 seconds to place the mints on the cookies when they came out of the oven! They are delicious!! We will bake these every year now! Thank you for such a easy awesome recipe!

cookies are a hit every time I make them!!  Only change is cooking time - if mine cook to 9 minutes they'll be hard and crunchy by the time they cool, so I cook about 7-7.5 min for soft chewy  cookies, I'm at high altitude

Super easy!  The flour seemed really off to me, I had to add at least an extra 1/4 C. so it wasn't so sticky. Turned out fabulous!  I broke the Andes Candies in half and that was plenty for each cookie.  YUM!

These are great! Pretty easy too. I didn't have regular Andes mints, just Andes mints baking chips, so I mixed them into the dough before baking.

These are to die for! I used 1 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of lt. brown sugar.  I also used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Chips.  I couldn't find the mints so I used the andes mint baking chips.  I just put a spoonful on top of each cookie, let it soften, then spread with spoon.  Oh my gosh the family went crazy!  Made about 70 cookies. Thanks for sharing this fabulous receipe!

Best cookies I've ever made. Perfectly soft and chewy. Followed the recipe exactly.  Used both Andes chocolates and mint Hershey kisses.  Both were spectacular and it was an easy way to have a little variety.

I made these cookies for a work Christmas party and out of dozens of cookies they were gone first!! The mint was a unexpected surprise and I made sure that I watched them carefully as they were in the oven so they would be soft and delicious. I made them the night before and kept them in the fridge until about an hour before I had to take them to work. I will be making these cookies again!

Excellent cookie! I added a dollop of peppermint extract and should have added more, as that only gave a hint of mint. I used Andes chips, and subbed about 1/2 cup for the chips. The chips made the melting on top fairly easy, as well. Garnished with some crushed candy canes for a Christmas cookie exchange and they were a hit! Definitely a keeper, and a cinch to make.

This is truly an amazing cookie! The only thing I slightly tweaked based on personal preference was to double the salt as well as switch out one of the tablespoons of water with 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Definitely make sure not to overcook. Between 8:00-8:30 minutes works out perfect for me even though it doesn't look done. These stay chewy and delicious and are really good cold too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Some one at work made these and they were gone in a heartbeat. I had to have the recipe. The first time I tried, they turned out too flat.(of course we still ate them. I just made them tonight they were perfect. I made my balls about 1/2 inch. and lined my pans with foil. Also I had some dark choclate chips with mint chips from tollhouse, so used those instead. they are so amazing!

I didn't use mints because my sister is allergic, instead I drizzled white and milk chocolate over the top to make them pretty.  These cookies were delicous.

Very good - very satisfying!  Great for kids to make - they can practically do everything. My 10 year old son made them.  Cookies are even better after they are cooled.

OH MY GOSH!!! These are to die for, and I love that I can eat until I'm stuffed.  They aren't too rich, and just the perfect amount of chocolate for a true chocolate lover as myself.  Gotta try these and they are wonderful for the holidays.

They were so good when I made them last night. They remained soft until the next day. However, they turned out a little bit flatter than I expected. They were delicious though so I didn't mind. Also, I used chopped up bittersweet chocolate block (500g -- slightly more than the 2 cups in the recipe) instead of chips so maybe that made a difference.

I made these for a cookies exchange at work!  They were a HUGE hit.  My husband loved them too.  I made the cookies larger than normal and put 2-3 mints on each.  So yummy!  One of my co-workers said "It tastes just like Christmas!".

I have to say yum :)  I made these for my dad for his birthday.  He absolutely loves GS Thin Mint cookies so I made these for him.  He did say they don't taste like them, but they are still very good.  

I did decide to make a dozen without the Andes candies melted on top just in case they were too much for some people, and they too were amazing!  I definitely will make these again.  Oh, I did one thing differently; I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup mild chocolate chips instead.

Sooooooo good.  Like a Girl Scout Thin Mint, but chewy.  I make these every Christmas.  You really only need to use 1/3 of an Andee's mint on top of each cookie if they're small (2 in. diameter).  Excellent recipe!

The actual cookie part of this recipe wasn't great, the only thing that makes this recipe good is the melted mint on top. However, the melted mint makes it very good with a taste reminiscent of girl scout thin mints.
Very easy to make and I will make again.

Yummy!  I used half butter, half margarine as I do all my cookies. Margarine helps keep them from spreading too much (keeps them thicker).  Once done, I let the cookies settle for about a minute, placed the mint into the top of the cookie, and flipped it using a knife once the edges started to look melted.  These aren't good until the mint is hardened after melting, so if you really can't wait, pop them in the fridge and they will harden quicker.:-)  Very good, very different, very enjoyable. Try them zapped a few seconds in the microwave with mint chocolate chip ice cream on top. WOW! :-) 
Update: Just a thought, the cookies where I spread the chocolate mint around a bit (and made a thinner layer of chocolate) taste a lot better than the ones where I left the mint to melt in the center. Those basically taste like a chocolate cookie with a mint in the middle. The others have almost a mint "icing". Those are the best!:-)

Delicious. I actually made a variation of the recipe without the cocoa powder(I didn't have any) and I used peppermint candies instead of chocolate chips. Tasted great and works around the holidays.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange and for a family get together and they went like crazy! People loved that they were soft and chewy and super minty! Not hard to make at all! They also froze really well.

4 out of 5 b/c they just didn't knock my socks off. The tips were great: turn Andes down for a minute first, then flip over. But I do think the cookie needs an entire mint to cover the top. I guess I was hoping they'd look prettier.

These were truly phenomenal.  I followed the recipe as stated except we made them slightly larger and used the whole mint instead of half.  I made them for Christmas and they vanished in no time. Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing. We took After 8s, and cut them in half diagonally before putting them on top, and did not push them around. This led to the best proportion of melted chocolate, and gave a neat appearance as well. I'll be adding this to my best-of recipe collection.

These are fantastic!!  I did make one minor change.  I used one package of 10oz. chocolate chips (1 2/3C.) and 1/3 C of Mint Chocolate chips.  It was GREAT!  Then instead of the thin mints I topped with three or four mint chocolate chips.  So Good!  Thanks.

These were really delicious and I must say that I am a very experienced cookie maker.  You do need to be a mint lover, however, to appreciate these.  If you are not, try them anyway, they are even great without the mint. By the way, I used only 1/2 an Andes mint per cookie and that's plenty.

These are fantastic.  I've made them twice, once following the recipe with melted chocolate chips and once using a cocoa-based substitution for a 12 oz bag of chips.  Instead of the chips, I used 3/4 cup of cocoa, 3/4 cup plus 2 Tablespoons of sugar, and 1/2 cup of butter (shortening would also have worked, and maybe vegetable oil as well, though it might have messed with the texture; I'll have to test it).  I melted the butter and sugar with the rest of the recipe and added the cocoa powder right before removing from heat, stirring very well to avoid those powdery lumps.  No discernable difference in the final product.  Have used and will continue to use in my Christmas gift-giving.

If you love thin mints, you will love these cookies. They are easy to make, and they turn out great with a moist, perfectly chewy consistency that will keep for days. I got rave reviews for these cookies and will make them again.

Oh so yummy!  I used half of mint on each cookie.  After they melted I spread it around the entire surface of the cookie.  Sooo chewy, great flavor.  My mother said she believed them to be the best cookies she has ever had, and she loves to bake!  Thank you

Delicious! I will definitely be sending these out this Christmas. Half a mint is perfect and results in a very minty cookie. I think a whole mint would overpower the chocolate taste. My boyfriend said they tasted like Keebler's Grasshopper cookies and I agree! Also, they taste fantastic frozen. Mmm...

I found this cookie easy to make...there were a few more steps then normal baking cookies.  But they were awesome...I also didn't know what kind of mint to use so I used the After Eight mints which turned out I'm sure just as good as the Andres.  Thanks for the recipe!
