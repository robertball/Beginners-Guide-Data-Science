Quite delicious. The crust is more like a batter, so it is easier to spread it with a wet rubber scraper than able to be pressed into the tart pan. I used a 9" pan. There is a strong taste of maple syrup in the crust. I used fresh pears. Next time, I will lower the temperature a bit and cook it longer. Thank you for the recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe. Made with fresh ripe thinly sliced pears. Also, cooked it a little linger at 300 after 15 minutes at 350. Will eliminate the almond extract next time but will make this with fresh, ripe fruit in season all varieties. Truly love this recipe.

This was excellent, my guests loved it as well. I didnt miss a crust. Only thing is i would double the recipe next time. I baked it in a bread pan, made a rectangle tart, it was 4 portions imo.

I used fresh pears from our tree and sprinkled them with coconut sugar. This was delicious and I plan to use the crust with just about every fruit I can find.
