Excellent recipe.  I added another 1/4 a cup of peanut butter, just because, and used chunky instead of adding the peanuts at the end.  In my oven, they were done perfectly at 10-11 minutes.  Turned out great! Thanks!

This recipe works a lot better with two eggs, cookies tend to fall apart other wise.

Delicious! I used half whole wheat and half unbleached flour and they turned out great.  I wasn't sure how much crushed peanuts to add so I put in about a 1/4 cup.

Although the taste is nice, these cookies are flat and lifeless. Also, unless you plan on making cookies that are smaller than nilla wafers, there is no way that this recipe yields 5 dozen cookies. I will not be using this recipe again.

WOW! Delicious! I changed only a little so that I had everything I needed in my cabinets already - 3/4 crunchy peanut butter and nixed the dry roasted peanuts. I also used margarine and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (chocolate and peanut butter sooo go together!) Cookies came out AMAZING!

Yum! I loved the addition of the chopped peanuts; that was a nice touch. The only criticism I have is that 8-10 minutes was not long enough to bake. After 10 minutes the cookies were still soft inside. It took about 15 minutes.

These cookies were delicious. I thought they were nice and moist - not dry at all as the previous reviewer had said. We used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter - only because we were out.

Very easy recipe.  I added about 1/4 cup vanilla flavored chocolate chips and chopped pecans (I was cleaning out my baking cupboard).  The cookies looked awesome when I took them out of the oven.  8 minutes was long enough on the middle rack.  Any racks lower than that will burn the bottom without cooking the tops.  Be careful.  I spooned mine into 1.5 inch balls to make 2.5 inch cookies.  Don't forget the signature fork marks on the top!  The recipe only made 25 cookies, but I probably made mine bigger than the original recipe poster.  Overall the cookies got a huge thumbs up from my husband who taste tests all of my baking adventures.  Well done!  Thanks for sharing!

very good and easy- I let the butter sit out all day and the batter was so soft I could not roll it or press it down with a fork,    so i made PB drop cookies.

Honestly, these really didn't work for me. They turned out crumbly and dry. I think if I added another half cup of peanut butter, I might have had a whole different outcome. I won't be trying this recipe again to find out. As is, it was a waste of ingredients.

Was looking for a very basic peanut butter cookies recipe and while this is pretty basic the cookies were a bit too dry and crispy for my taste.  I made the recipe exactly as is being it was my first time making it.  May try again and play with it to get more of a crunchy/chewy texture.

Followed the recipe exactly and made two batches in two days.  I personally found them a little plain and a little dry. I think they need something to give them a bit more chewiness.

Peanut butter cookies are my favorite and I have eaten alot of them.  In my opinion, this recipe is by far one of the better ones.  I used crunchy peanut butter, and chilled the dough for about 10 minutes so I could roll them into balls, but the first batch I used the drop method and they were perfect too.  They came out with crispy edges and a soft  chewy middle...perfect.  With this recipe I made 2 dozen good sized cookies.

I just made these cookies yesterday. I think everyone is being too nice. These cookies turned out flat, and not very peanut-buttery. I am looking for a sweeter and fluffier recipe!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I yielded barely 3 dozen making the walnut sized balls. For those reviewers who had a dry cookie:  try using 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of the 3/4 soda.  Chill the dough in the fridge for an hour. Also, 8-9 minutes should be enough baking time.  If you leave them in longer they will be dry.  The bottoms should only be slightly brown when you take them out and remember not to let them sit on the hot stove cause they'll keep cooking.  Remove them to the rack no more than 2 minutes after taking them out.  Let us know if this worked for you.

These cookies were awesome! I have made many different cookie recipes I found on here, but these were definitely the best. I followed the recipe as is, but did not add the peanuts, instead I made a few with chocolate chips, they were excellent!

Awesome cookies. Did not substitute, follow recipe ingredients exactly. Turned oven down 25 degrees, since I used a dark cookie sheet and they were perfect. Saved Recipe. Thank You Robin. You are a great baker. :)

Turned out fantastic!  Will definitely keep using this recipe, and maybe add chocolate chips now and then. I used 3/4 cup of extra chunky pb instead of adding nuts.

I had to add a little milk to mine, because it was not blending well; it was still extremely powdery. I also substituted the peanuts with hazelnuts. But the taste is PHENOMENAL! GREAT cookie recipe!

I just made these cookies for the first time and they are wonderful.  They are perfectly crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle and the flavor is spot on.  The only changes I made were I added extra vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe.

Very good! I tweaked it a little though to. Used Almond extract instead of vanilla, and used crunchy peanut butter. Also added honey roasted crushed peanuts, and peanut butter chips! Very happy the way they came out, so was the family :)

These have become my favorite cookie to make & eat, they are so easy!! Moist & delicious. I tend to not measure the peanut butter, just scoop some out and prob tend to add more then 1/2 cup.  These are also very good with chocolate chips added in. Most recent batch I added chocolate chips and carmel chips, good but probably won't do carmel agan.
Reading new reviews - "after 10 mins they were still soft inside" my opinion that's what makes them so good, but my husband is one that likes a crunchy cookie

Very good peanut butter cookies. Not too sweet. I used 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter and no peanuts. After they cooled I melted some milk chocolate chips and dipped half the cookie in the chocolate. Delicious!

Delicious and very easy recipe.  However, the yield was far less than the recipe stated.  I used 3/4 cup of chunky peanut butter and didn't use the peanuts and I only got half as many cookies as the recipe said I would get.  Fabulous tasting and very light.  Thanks for a wonderful cookie!

This was a very good cookie base! I added a cup of peanut butter because I love a lot of PB flavor. I baked some plain, some with chopped honey roasted peanuts, and some with the chopped nuts and chocolate chips. They all came out great! Thanks for a good recipe :)

Really good! I put in extra peanut butter (made it a heaping 1/2 cup instead of leveling it off) but kept it at one egg like recipe states.  I made my cookies small (balls were the size of avocado seed) and only cooked them for six minutes, as we like our cookies soft. I got roughly 40 cookies per batch. Everyone raved about the rich flavor! I think next time I'll experiment with chocolate chips or peanut butter chips!

They're good enough for tea and coffee moments, so I'll eat them. Easy to make and bake. But they lacked depth in the flavor. Not enough sugar to be "sweet". Not enough peanut butter to be peanut-buttery. I'm still looking for a better recipe. :)

These cookies were a home run. My boyfriend isn't even big on eating sweets but he ate so many of them. Every time I turned around he was munching on one I loved that they stayed soft even after they cooled. The only change I made was to sprinkle some sugar on top of the cookies before baking. Other than that it is a great recipe.

These are the PERFECT Peanut butter cookies and I've tried a lot of recipes. They don't spread out very much and they are soft and chewy in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside. Their flavor is outstanding, I didn't use the peanuts I just used creamy peanut butter and they were sublime. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

Perfect, except be careful not to add too much flour. It needed a little more flour, but I added too much and they came out dry. I also added some little chocolate chips on top and didn't add any chopped nuts and they tasted great.

I love how fast and simple this recipe is. I already had everything on hand. I baked on the top rack for 8 minutes and they turned out beautiful, nice and moist but slightly crispy around the edges. 

I do agree that it would be tough to get 5 dozen cookies out of this! With my "walnut-sized" balls of dough I got cookies that were about 3.5" in diameter and that gave me about 28 cookies (I counted AFTER my husband began taste-testing, so that's an approximation!).

These "went down like a house on fire"!  Excellent!  (I'm a tough rater, that is the only reason for the 4 stars.  Others would have given them 5 stars deservedly!) Served these for a community meeting that my husband hosted and not a crumb was left on the plate!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

WOW! These cookies are really great, tastes like the ones my mommy used to make me as a kid growing up in the Bronx. I would recommend removing the brown sugar and adding agave nectar juice, its much more tasty, and better for you. Peanut butter could also be removed without much notice.

The search is over people!  If you want a large, chewy peanut butter cookie.....this is it!!  I used only butter as we like richer,  chewy cookies.  I followed a fellow user's recommendation and added the extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  I used crunchy instead of adding the nuts at the end as well.  Using only cool cookie sheets, I then spooned HEAPING tablespoons and baked for 9 minutes at 375. I then left the cookes on the sheet to cool for 10 minutes and then removed to cooling racks. The result was large, chewy cookies with a slightly nutty bite.  PERFECT...REALLY!

They were delicious! Great texture and taste! I didn't add the chopped peanuts but did add some semi-sweet chocolate chips, which I enjoyed.

This recipe was a lot of work to end up having no taste and made only 20 cookies. I can’t imagine how anyone got 60 cookies out of this recipe.

Thank you Robin for this wonderful recipe, I tweaked it a bit adding one cup wheat flour for part of the flour. Another reviewer suggested using more peanut butter so I probably added about a quarter cup more plus honey roasted peanuts crushed because I had them. I did not roll them in sugar. They are big so in the end it probably took about 12 minutes to bake starting out with eight minutes and moving up two minutes each time. This recipe was very very good.

These were delicious! I used crunchy peanut butter instead of adding nuts and that was great and wasn't too nutty! They weren't too soft or too hard and were surprisingly moist granted the peanut butter made them dry, but amazing easy recipe (:

My daughter made these for her Pop Pop for his 75th birthday. We were a little disappointed in the flavor ... very little peanut butter taste. We followed the recipe to the letter, except to roll them in a little bit of sugar before pressing with fork. The texture was great and 8 minutes was perfect for us. If there is a next time, I'll definitely add more peanut butter!

I substituted oats for the peanuts as I did not have peanuts and don't particularly care for them in my desserts, and I must say they turned out with only a subtle taste of peanut butter instead of what I was expecting.  When I make again, I think I'll add 1/4 c. more peanut butter.  I also used only 1 stick of butter and substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce for the rest.  It seemed a bit runny, so I topped it off with maybe another 1/3 c. flour.  The result baked up perfect!  Great recipe, easy to make.

Yum!  I did use 2 small eggs, omitted the dry peanuts, used nearly a cup of chuncky peanut butter, and added 3/4 cup chocolate chips (as previous reviewers had reccommended).  Because of my changes, the dough was pretty sticky, and I wasn't really able to do the fork smooshy thing, but they were still delicious!  I was able to make 30 good size cookies with one batch of dough.  10-11 minutes in my oven made them perfectly chewey, just the way I love them!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

A good classic peanut butter cookie my family likes softer baked cookies so I only baked them about 7 minutes they were perfect. I also used a little over 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter instead of the chopped peanuts they came out fine and did not fall apart like some other people had mentioned theirs did.

The taste of these cookies is nice and peanut buttery... but they came out of the oven burnt on the bottom (after 8 minutes) and with a strange texture. I won't be making these again.

I am by no means an experienced baker so I loved the fact that these cookies were simple & used basic ingredients. I altered the recipe a bit, skipping the crushed peanuts, using a tsp baking powder (out of soda), two eggs, and  a lil' extra peanut butter & flour. My version yielded only two dozen cookies, but I also made some larger ones. I think they could have have been a little sweeter/ buttery, but that is probably my fault for playing with the ratios. Overall quick, easy, tasty.

I have never made cookies before, ever.  These were my first try and I am pretty sure I did it wrong... but nonetheless, these were fantastic.  Kids loved them, husband loved them.

I baked these cookies for the children and they raved about it all day long.  I added peanut butter chips and 1/4 cup of sour cream to make it a little softer.

Very Good recipe. I didn't have brown sugar so I added a tsp. of molasses and a tsp. baking powder instead of soda. I also used a little more flour due to being in the Seattle area moisture in the air until it had the consistancy of playdough. =)

After reading the reviews on this recipe I thought I'd give 'er a go. Wanting and looking for a good peanut butter cookie for awhile. Although great to work with and has convenient ingredients, I found it lacked in the taste department. Don't know if I will give this one another go.

these were a bit flat when they came out of the oven, tasted ok but not very pretty. Maybe they would be good for homemade ice cream sandwiches

I followed this recipe as written (used 1 large egg), and the cookies turned out amazing! They were slightly chewy, just the way we like them. The added chopped peanuts gave them that extra oomph!!
