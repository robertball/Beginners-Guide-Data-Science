Many thanks for this lovely recipe! Prior to whisking egg yolks with the sugars and spices, be sure to remove the 2 'strings' from each yolk or add step of straining it before pouring into ramekins. The hot cream should be added, about, 1 TB. at a time so yolks won't curdle. Lastly: a bain marie (water bath) is necessary for a creamy texture so, ramekins should be placed in a 1-1/2 inch deep baking dish, placed on oven rack and hot water poured into dish to a depth of 1/3 the ramekin. Be sure to check at 13 mins. - a knife inserted, about, 1/4" from center of ramekin should come out clean and this means it's done as they will continue to cook once removed from the oven.  This recipe is, also, nice with the ramekins coated with caramelized sugar and served as creme caramel which is how I did it since my torch isn't usable. I topped with a TBsp. of whipped, unsweetened, heavy cream (the more cream, bacon or butter in a receipe - the better!). Plan to serve in the small squash shells for Thanksgiving.

I just tried these and they came out perfect the first time, rarely do recipes go well the first time but this one did. I didn't have any cloves so I just doubled up on the cinnamon (I am a cinnamon fiend anyways). They were not really set after 15 minutes so I baked them for 10 extra minutes and it turned out great. Excellent recipe!!! Thanks.

I don't think I did anything wrong, but I had to bake these for about 30 minutes.  They tasted okay, but not good enough to make again.

Very nice recipe.  I used the hot water bath and the texture was great.  I like to top with brown sugar rather then white sugar, but I otherwise followed the recipe just as written.

I made the recipe for a cooking contest at work where we had to use pumpkin as a main ingredient.  I did place 3rd and I didn't adjust the recipe at all.  I love Creme Brulee it's my favorite desert.  That being said the pumpkin taste was different, almost lacking some sort of spice.  But it was good, just not amazing.

This makes a great Thanksgiving dessert - not the same old pumpkin pie.  Only issue that I had: it took me about twice as long as stated in the recipe to get the brulee to set.

Tasted great - basically just like pumpkin pie and even had the same consistency of pumpkin pie.  I couldn't find mini pumpkins that would fit my ramekins.

I too had to double my cooking time and was using  Ramenkins of a small size. Other than the cooking time the flavor was amazing and I will definite treat the family with this dessert next holiday season.

I've made various iterations of creme brulee many many times. These were delicate and lite. I made just over twenty and they were a huge hit. The pumpkin flavor was lite and smooth. I made my own puree by baking a fresh pumpkin then pureeing it, this made for a fresher, lighter flavor. We also used fresh eggs from our chickens that day. I had my kids caramelize the sugar tops with a brulee torch. Great recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. Made this for dessert at a harvest dinner. After carmelizing the sugar, it actually turned into liquid before serving (I have never had a problem with traditional cr√®me brulee). It was like eating pumpkin pie filling.
