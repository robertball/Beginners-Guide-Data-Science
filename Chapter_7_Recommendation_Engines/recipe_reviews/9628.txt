These turned out wonderfully soft and moist. I often adapt cake recipes to muffin tins, as it makes them more portable. I did the same with this recipe, and it turned out great! I also sprinkled the confectioner's sugar mixture on top, as soon as they came out of the oven. 
I did notice that they firmed up a bit after cooling on the rack for about 1/2 hour.
These have a nice, mellow banana flavour, not overwhelming.

I made this recipe for a Hawaiian B-Day party for my 11 yr.old nephew.  The kids like the way they tasted.  They were just like banana bread; however, they weren't very pretty.  They sort of fell apart easily.  I would probably make them again just for the house, but not for a party.

These were very easy to make and very moist. They didn't have a strong banana flavor like some recipes do. Very good.

Very Nice. I added some shredded coconut and instead of cutting while it was hot and rolling in sugar and cinnomon I sifted the mixture on top while it was hot and let it cool befoe cutting. It is very moist but did seem to be more like a cake than a bar. Still super good.

This is an easy and tasty way to use up bananas.  I did not have confectioner's sugar, so I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top.

This is the most excellent banana recipe I have ever eaten! Definitely better than banana bread.

Very sweet, probably could cut back on the sugar a bit, and also needed more time to bake.  It was still raw in the middle when I baked it for 35 minutes.

I thought they were pretty good, not the greatest. I enjoyed the overall result although probably should have used riper bananas to get more of banana flavor. Pros: Cinnamon topping was great and i added some crushed cardamom (black seeds only) to give it some kick! I added egg to make more cake like. Nice side thing for work party or potluck. I will try it again without egg.
Cons: Cooked faster in my gas oven, in 20 mins. it was done. Also, don't be worried if 11x17 pan sounds too big when you are pouring batter in, it was just right. 
Conclusion: Had to try this because it sounded so good. looks pretty with topping, which was easy to roll in when bars just came out of oven. A few pieces did get wasted because mine got burnt due to time I had set for cooking.

Very tasty, but when I tried to cut the bars while still warm, they crumbled apart.  It does work to roll them in the cinnamon-confectioners sugar mixture when cooled.  I added some coconut flakes to the mixture before baking.  Yummy!

I did not want to take the warm bars out of pan to roll them in the powdered sugar/cinn. mixture so I just put it on the top like a frosting and then when we ate it we rolled the pieces on the top and it was still yummy. Great for when you need to use up the really ripe bananas and do not want to make bread.

These are sooooo good.  The only thing I had to change was the baking time (about 25 min).  These are so great right out of the oven.  Absolutely wonderful!

Perhaps I did something wrong...mine were moist - but they turned out like a cake (not like chewy bars). I did substitute macadamia nuts for the walnuts.  It tasted fine, but was more like a moist banana flavored cake.

these were OK...they are moist...almost to the point of being sticky and gummy.  My kids enjoyed them....even with the nuts (I didn't mention there were nuts in it, and he didn't seem to notice!)

I thought the mixture was a little low on banana and a little dry, but I didn't have anymore bananas, so I added a little orange juice. They were very good. I halved the recipe and it made a perfect six bars. Not too sweet.

This recipe is good for using ripe bananas that need to be eaten. It probably isn't a recipe for everyone, but a banana lover will find it delicious. I appreciated that the recipe called for ingredients I typically have on hand. This also makes a good breakfast treat with coffee.

My daughter and I made this recipe together, it was so easy and tastes fabulous! We also added 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Try the variation it makes it more tropical :)

There appears to be something missing from this recipe or the amount of butter is incorrect.  My husband is allergic to eggs, so I am always hunting for recipes without eggs, I ran across two recipes for banana bars...I tried the other one first and really liked it, but decided to try this one and see, I ended up throwing out this batch and making a batch of the other recipe - they were more than chewy, they were tough

These were really good... used pecans instead of walnuts and put a layer of sweetened flaked coconut over the top.
