This slaw has a great blend of flavors. I toasted the sesame seeds for that added depth of flavor and added more lime juice to taste. The slaw without avocados is good too.

Really nice and easy recipe. But it takes much longer to prepare and I added more avocados and more lemons juice. Also I didn't have sesame seeds so used toasted sunflower and pumpkin seed instead. Even my hubby who always prefers mayo said he likes it.

No changes, just lacking. Maybe more juice would have helped. It just seemed like it was missing something. Would probably do a mixture of red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar and Italian spices on it next time.

Not what I was expecting. I had to add more limes to make it enjoyable.

I didn't have seeds so we did without. The avocados balance out the lime juice really well.  I also did without onions. My 8yr old usually loves all coleslaw but this one she liked less than others.

Maybe I shouldn't admit this, but made with "broccoli slaw" and "Yucat√°n guacamole" because I was short on time and that's what they had at Whole Foods. The whole thing took me about 5 minutes, mixed easily, and was a big hit.  I'll definitely make again!

My husband thought this was yummy.  It seemed a bit tart to me with the lime juice, but the leftovers tasted smoother the next day (although of course the avocado was a bit mushier).  I halved the recipe - maybe that doesn't always work.  I'll make this again, just because my husband enjoyed it so much.  And it's healthy, too!
