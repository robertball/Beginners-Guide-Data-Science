This recipe is great.  I have made this for years although instead of mandarin oranges I use strawberries.  Maybe next time I will try the oranges.

I'm on my 3rd time making this right now and it has been a huge hit both previous times. I used pine nuts both times instead of almonds (just cuz that's what I had, I think the almonds will be better though) and it turned out great too. I'm cutting the sugar a bit each time, but wanting to keep the vinegar balanced.

This was a terrific recipe!! My family loved it. I did make one modification though and used less vinegar. Everyone loved it. This will definitely be a repeat for me!!

We really liked this salad. I used fresh clementines instead of the mandarins and added mushrooms. I had quite a bit of dressing leftover, so i'll cut it by 1/3 or so next time.

This is fantastic! I used all spinach and I subbed walnuts for the almonds because of an almond allergy- I brought it to a party and everyone ate it- there wasn't anything left in the bowl!

Delicious salad. I used a whole bag of baby spinach; didn't have the salad greens. Added sliced strawberries along with the mandarin oranges. I used organic mayo from TJs instead of Miracle Whip, and added a dash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing.

This is a very nice, refreshing salad!  I used a mix of organic baby spinach and mixed baby greens.  I used Hellmann's Light Mayo for the dressing.  Update:  I just added real bacon bits to the salad and it is sooo good (it's what the salad was missing)!

Oh, yummmmmm! Really enjoyed this one.  Added strawberries (kept the mandarin oranges) and chopped up some roasted almonds.  Even "The Hubbs", whose reason for eating most veggies is "because their good for me", said "feel free to make this any time!"  Thanks for a great recipe!

The dressing is very good. I use it on salads and crepes. It keeps really well in the fridge. It is very thin.

I made this for a family dinner at my in-laws and it was a hit. I even had request for the recipe so this is a keeper. The only thing I changed was I used stawberries. Thanks for the recipe.

So simple, tasty and a hit!  Loved the creamy dressing and I used eggless mayo for those (like me) who are allergic.  Yummy!

So extremely yummy - I didn't have any salad mix so I used all spinach (no nuts for allergy reasons), but my 5yo and 7yo ate it up.  Now I just mix the dressing and keep it in the fridge and I just have it on plain spinach.  Thanks for a yummy recipe Siobhan

Excellent - I'll definately make this again.  I didn't have any red onion on hand.  Like one reviewer suggested I added real Hormel bacon bits! My husband wanted seconds!

This is an easy, toss together in a hurry, salad. The sweet creamy dressing makes a delightful all-purpose salad dressing with just a few basic ingredients. You can't go wrong with this one.

Made this as directed but subbed strawberries instead of oranges, and as other reviewers suggested I added some chopped bacon pieces.    Got great reviews and DH requests this salad now.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it.  I had LOTS of leftover dressing.  This salad is so good, it hardly needed any dressing!  I used just a small drizzle and it was perfect.

I didn't have any red onion, so I just made it without it.  Great salad.  We will be making this frequently.

add 1/4 to 1/2 c of plain yogurt or sour cream to make creamier.....cut back on sugar from 1/3 c to 1/4 c
