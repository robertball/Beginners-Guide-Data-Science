1.28.20  The taste is very good, but the mousse texture not so much.  A mousse is supposed to be very creamy, but unfortunately, the texture on this is grainy resulting from undissolved sugar, and thick, almost fudgy.  If thatâ€™s not important to you, go for it, because the taste definitely is decadent chocolate deliciousness!  Served with a dollop of whipped cream and grated chocolate.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
