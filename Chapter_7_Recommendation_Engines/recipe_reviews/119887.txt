I love a recipe that has flexibility.  I substituted shredded leftover turkey for the sausage and since I did not have mushrooms I used celery.  I used a multicolor spiral pasta that my kids love and the whole thing came together very quickly.  It did need a bit more seasoning but most likely I lost a little flavor because of not using the sausage.  This one goes in the quick-easy-good-on-a-school-night file.  *UPDATE* Made this with Turkey sausage this time and the flavor was perfect.  4.5 Stars!!

Wow, this was so good! I used smoked pork and beef sausage, broccoli instead of asparagus, 4 cloves garlic, added oregano and basil to the thyme, seasoned with salt and pepper, and added a piece of turkey bacon that needed to be used up.

The turkey sausage gives it a lot of flavor so if you substitute this for something else, it's going to be flat.  This is a nice basic stir fry recipe and easy to change to your own personal tastes.  I added a 2 tablespoons of soy sauce with the the chicken stock out of habit but I am sure that it would have been fine without.

I'd like to rate it 3.5 stars.  It didn't have much flavor.  With salt & pepper and some extra cheese it is decent.  I liked it, but probably wouldn't make again.  It is quite easy to make though.
