Awesome! I made a few adjustments- I coated the apples in cinnamon suger before placing in the dough. I also cut the apples in half and used 1/4 a pie crust for each 1/2 an apple (So there was a little less apple per dumpling and more crust) I served them at a dinner party and people were absolutely floored at how good they were.

For a quick simple dessert they don't come any easier than this! Use Granny Smith Golden Delicious or similar baking apples. I used puff pastry dough and lightly sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. We made extra sauce and kicked it up a notch by adding dark rum before reduction. Yum! Have some vanilla ice cream on hand too!:)

My husband love's apple dumplings and this is the first time I have made them. They turned out very tasty but the sauce carmelized while baking. Maybe I should have taken them out of the pan before they cooled because they stuck to the pan and I had a horrible time getting them out. Will make this again but will do something different with the sauce maybe pouring over after 20 minutes of baking or just remove dumplings before cooling. Anyone has an idea please let me know.

YUM! These were so good and so easy to make! No one would ever know that you use ready made pie crust. The sauce is delicious. I highly recommend!

These are wonderful! I too coated the apple in cinnamon/sugar before wrapping them and I also added a pat of butter into the cored apple and sprinkled a bit of nutmeg into it. I baked them 20 minutes before pouring on the sauce then finished the baking. They are heaven!

These were absoultely delicious. Since my husband and I are both diabetics I used Splenda and they turned out great. I used the suggestions of others by coating them with cinnamon/sugar and adding a small pat of butter in the center. I will be making these again and again.

This is really good! I used puff pastry instead of pie crust. I baked it for 20 minutes before pouring the sauce over the wrapped apples. I took the advice of other reviewers and rolled the apples in cinnamon sugar before wrapping. One apple per person is too much. I think the next time I'll cut the apples in half before wrapping in pastry. Everyone loved them!

These were pretty good. They just didn't look appealing to me. Maybe my technique but they looked like lumps and it didn't look good even though it tasted good and flaked nicely. I think the cinnamon in the sauce made it a little purple. The sauce was a little too sweet but the apples were tender. I made homemade crust from this site. If I try them again I will spend time trying to make them look better.

Apples sugar cinnamon all wrapped in crust - what's not to like?! I used 1 heaping 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 heaping 1/4 cup white sugar and an extra half teaspoon of cinnamon in the syrup. As other reviewers suggested I rolled my apples in sugar and cinnamon before wrapping in dough. I also added the syrup after the first 20 minutes of cooking.

Very good. I think I would like more liquid in the bottom next time. I added dried cranberries because I had about 1/4c left in a bad. That was a delicious addition.

My whole family LOVED this recipe. It came out really good. I followed the recipe except when it came to the sugar. I didn't use as much as the recipe said and I'm glad I didn't because it would of been too sweet. I used the Pie Crust IV recipe which is also on this site. So simple but it was sooo good!

This is a very easy recipe that I have made a couple of times already. My only change was to add a tsp of vanilla to the sauce mixture just before pouring it over the dumplings. I even used the little blue "box" pastry mix. Very Yummy!

Yummy! So quick and easy. My four year old was able to help makes these. We followed someone else's suggestion and rolled the apples in cinnamon and sugar before covering with dough. This is def. a keeper:)

Great recipe! I did make tiny changes; I greased the pan with butter and sprinkled cinnamon & sugar before placing dumplings in pan. I did not pour the sauce on until 20 min before done baking. My boyfriend just LOVED these! I will be making another batch today!!!

Best dumplings ever. I used slenda instead of sugar and dipped the apples in Splenda and apple pie seasoning before wrapping and baking. Taste as good as the ones at the State Fair.

This recipe was perfect for the apples from my parents' apple tree. I ran out of white sugar for the sauce and finished with 1/4 brown sugar and it still worked fantastic. I read some other reviews and did dust the apples with cinnimon and sugar as well as the pastries before going in the oven. My husband LOVED the pastry crust and the perfectly soft sweet apple center.

I rolled the apples in cinnamon and powdered sugar before putting on the dough. I'd also use 3 pie crusts just to be safe. Someone else mentioned that the sauce carmelized on the apples and were hard to get out of the pan so I poured the sauce over the apples after they were fully cooked. They were SO GOOD. I made them for my in-laws and they were a hit:) (thank you for those bonus points!!!).

Great recipe! Tried original recipe then on second run sprinkled apples with cinnamon sugar before wrapping. A little better flavor this way.

Easy and very good!! Put cinnamon sugar and dab of butter in each dumpling. Used Granny Smith apples. Served warm with ice cream. Used jiffy pie crust mix. Tastes most like homemade. Family loved these. Will make again.

Yummy! Don't go any smaller than 1/2 apple per dumpling. May try 1/2 c sugar next time.
