I made this for a wine club party and it was the hit of the party.  Not a single one left!  I used baby shrimp instead of crawfish. Yummy!  I also added diced jalape√±o for a little heat and served them with a spicy plum sauce.  My husband wants me to make it for just the 2 of us.  Easy and delicious.  Doesn't get any better than that :)

I made this for a NYE party.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.   I used trinity seasoning instead of just onion.  I think it needs a little sugar or more creamed cheese.  I also added more crawfish.  I joined the corners of the wonton to make a triangle shape instead...and a tablespoon deemed to be a bit too much stuffing.  But all in all....I received several raves and request to make it again.
