I really like this soup.  It's super easy and the cayenne pepper gives a nice little kick.

I'm a novice soup maker and this recipe was easy to follow. I did add some nutmeg and a few drops of habanero hot sauce.  I replaced the fat free half and half with half the amount of heavy whipping cream as it was all that I had on hand.  I will be making this again!!!!

I loved how easy this recipe was! That said, it definitely needed some tweaking. I made it exactly as written and felt the soup was missing something. I ended up adding 1-2tbsp of brown sugar and that really livened things up. I also thought it was too heavy on the nutmeg. I'd suggest using half the amount of nutmeg, but doubling the cinnamon because I could barely taste it.  I also couldn't really taste the Cointreau, so I suggest doubling the amount. This makes large portions, which I liked. No wimpy tiny bowls of soup like some other recipes I've made.
