Absolutely loved this one! I did use cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage and carrot...kept everything else the same. They were so tasty. I got 6 decent sized patties out of the mixture. Served with turkey kielbasa and a salad. Will make again...thanks Sanzoe!!

I really liked the flavor of this, but I had too much trouble trying to get them to stick together as patties. The second time I made it I decided to just make it as casserole and it worked out great! I made it exactly the same way but instead of frying it as a patty I put in in a casserole dish and put grated cheddar over the top. 15 minutes at 350 and it was ready to go. My husband says "great leftovers!".

The patties didn't really hold together, but it was definitely tasty!  We ate them all with sour cream.

ETA:  I have now made this a few times and I've done better at getting them to stick together.  It helps if you don't make the mashed potatoes too wet before mixing it all together.  These are quite tasty!  DH loves them.

These are great!  I've never heard of them, but encountered the recipe when I *met* sanzoe on the RE and was intrigued by them.  I cheated (I'm kind of lazy) and used left over mashed potatoes (made w/just 1% milk and a tad of butter), bagged coleslaw mix, and pre shredded 2% cheddar.  Since I'm a cheater, i had to *guesstimate* the amounts (esp since Mr. LTH got home from work early and helped himself to some of the potatoes I'd set aside!).  I also realized I was out of onion, so I added a couple of dashes of minced/dried.  I had no problem forming the patties...the only problem I had was my impatience in waiting for them to cook...I kept flipping them early, resulting in not the most attractive looking patties.  I made mine first and made them in a non stick pan sprayed w/Pam.  I do NOT recommend this!  Mine had a very *off* taste to them.  I then made Mr. LTH's in the same pan, coated w/a bit of butter and they were FABULOUS!  I also added a couple of dashes of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  TY for a great recipe, sanzoe!!

I thought this was really good!  I tripled the recipe to take to a pot luck, and it was well-received.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I sauteed the onions in a little butter before mixing them into the rest.    I did cook it differently, as suggested by another reviewer -- I spread the veggies into a 9 X 13 dish and topped them with the cheese, then cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes (until it was warm and bubbly).  The food was almost room temperature by the time I did this, though, since I'd made it an hour or so before I needed it to go in the oven.  I will make this again, but will probably try it as the patties next time.  I will add more Dijon, too -- it was there but not strong enough for my taste.  Leftovers are apparently pretty good, since my husband just ate them for breakfast with lots of Tabasco and some sunny-side-up eggs!  :)

Delicious! This is a "keeper". Similar to potato pancakes but, with another layer of flavor from the cabbage & carrot. We enjoyed topped with sour cream & dill. I am part Scottish and have never had Scottish food before. Thank you, Sanzoe, for sharing the recipe.

These were pretty good. I used the cabbage mix and that worked well.  I was guessing what a pound of potatoes looked like, and I think I was way off.  I only used about 5 small/med. pottoes and I got about 8 large patties.  Anyway, I salted the whole mixture a bit, but I also decided to salt the patties as they were cooking.  I think this helped with taste. I might try adding more cheese next time simply becuase I couldn't really tell there was any in there as I was eating them.  And my hubby LOVES cheese with everything.  Lastly, I was wondering if a whole onion would be too much-- I love onions in things like this and I thought it was perfect.  My hubby doesn't like much onion and he has to have them cooked.  He didn't complain at all- in fact he said "I didn't like potato pancaked growing up, but these are really good."  I did serve these with a sourcream and dried dill weed dip.  We loved that. There you have it!

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think there was anything really great about this.  My potato patties held together just fine, but the flavor wasn't much better than just using leftover mashed potatoes and browning them.  And that would be with a lot less effort than what was put into shredding cabbage and cheese, grating a carrot, and mincing an onion.  Won't be making this again; sorry, it's just too ordinary in my opinion.

These patties are great. I added a splash or two of red pepper flakes to add the ZIP I like! Fabulous!  Low calorie, easy, delicious! What more can one ask for!

I used coleslaw mix and cooked the onion with it and the carrot.   I decided to fry these in a little butter.  The patties held together okay, but just didn't seem to brown very well.   I added a little flour to the last batch, and they browned much better.   I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.

Had this in files since October with good intentions but didn't make it until over the past weekend. I have no clue why I waited so long.  Simple ingredients, even easier to put together and a delicious dish everybody loved.  Gk's fell in love with the name and asked when I'd make it again.  Soon, very soon!!  Thank you, Sanzoe.  Grrrreat recipe.l

I came across this recipe while looking for a way to finish off some coleslaw mix. That was my only deviation from the recipe other than not peeling the potatoes. They had great flavor and everyone really enjoyed them. Quick, simple and delicious comfort food. I didn't have the problem some reviewers had with them falling apart. Just be sure to mash your potatoes as the recipe directs, without adding any milk or butter to them.

Never mind that my patty making skills were a disaster-I ended up frying it all in a little oil in a skillet & putting it in  casserole dish to serve. YUM!!!! I'm officially addicted! I even managed to hide some in the fridge so I can have some for breakfast-shhhhh! Without a doubt, I'll be making this again & again & again!

Very tasty! Used instant garlic flavored mashed potatoes and the whole family gobbled them up. Added some extra minced garlic and a little seasoning salt to kick it up

I took this to a Scottish-themed potluck and everyone loved it!  I tripled the recipe and didn't have enough cheddar, so I added some Parmesan petals. The only problem I had was that the patties kept on sticking to my electric skillet, so they got a little misshapen in the cooking process.  I'll have to try cooking them on something else in the future.

I made this in May and put it on my list of comfort foods for any meal of the day. I was surprised how good they were. We grilled them on foil and only one stuck a little. I'm going to try freezing them since I read that it worked out.

I'm rating these primarily on flavor, as my patties did not stay together well because of the way I made this.  First, I used leftover mashed potatoes and in hindsight I realized they probably had a fair amount of milk and butter in them, and secondly I know I did not drain the cabbage/carrot mixture as well as I should have, so as the patties started to cook the liquid came out and they got pretty mushy and difficult to flip.  However, they tasted AWESOME! I thought it would be too much onion - it was not at all! And I also kind of wrinkled my nose at the mustard, but it really worked in this, giving them a little extra twang of flavor.  Funny thing is, as I was eating this I remembered that my grandfather always put mustard on his boiled cabbage, so I guess it's not as strange as I thought! :)  I'll definitely make them again, but I'll used plain potatoes, mashed, and be sure to drain out as much liquid as possible.  Thanks, Sanzoe! I definitely waited too long to try this recipe!

Wow!  These were great!  I used a hot mustard in this and used a regular nonstick pan to cook them in.  Mine browned up nicely in about 4 minutes on each side.  They were a little hard to keep together but it worked out okay in the end.  Thanks Sanzoe!

I essentially doubled the recipe, but because I was short on time I left it in a mashed potato state with the addition of a little margarine and milk. I used a coleslaw that contained carrots instead of just the cabbage and carrot separately. I cooked down the coleslaw mix & onions (added fresh garlic, would use more next time) before adding to the potatoes. I used a mild cheddar and Dijon mustard instead. Tasty, I'm sure as patties they would have been great but the first few I tried were taking far too long to brown and the rest of dinner (sausages and salad) were ready, and the guests were too hungry to wait lol.

This recipe is unique and very tasty.  I cooked the onion with the cabbage & carrot so everything was cooked before browning in the pan.  To brown the patties, I melted a minimal amount of butter then just plopped a large spatula full onto the butter in the pan, then formed it into a patty with a fork.  There is plenty of time to form these initially, and as you flip them, you will need to form them back into shape again...you are essentially trying to brown a mashed potato patty.  The patties took a while to brown, but the end result looked nice.

Excellent flavor in this recipe but had an awful time trying to get them to stay together as patties.  I tried non-stick spray and oil both and neither worked very well.  After trying this recipe a second time and being unsuccessful with the first batch, I just ended up making a kind of "hash" with the rest of it - threw it all in a pan unformed and turned periodically.  Very tasty nonetheless, despite the form issue, and this has become a regular meal.  My family likes to top these with mustard.

These were GREAT! I made half exactly as written and added jalapeno to the other half to add a little zing. They were great both ways. I will be making these again. Thanks Sanzoe!

I used leftover colcannon that I made from Diane's Colcannon from this site. So I didn't have the carrots in it. Great way to use up the leftovers. Thanks!

Yum, these were delicious and reminded me of potato patties my mom used to make with leftovr mashed potatoes.  I think I may even get the kids to eat cabbage in this dish (provided I don't tell them it's in there).

Superb.  Amazing how something so simple
can taste so good.  I, too, had problems
keeping the patties whole so I added an
egg (actually egg substitute) and bingo !
Many thanks sanzoe.

Don't think the ingredients are too weird to put together, it's really delicious.  They remind me a little of potato pancakes, they have a hint of that potato flavor.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

This was a very good recipe, simple and fun to make, my husband loved them! Which is good because there are only two of us and we had lots of leftovers :)
 Already recommended them to my sister in law.

I read some of the reviews and here are the changes that I made: I boiled the potatoes in vegetable broth, then when mashing I added salt & pepper to taste, a pad of butter, and the cheese while the potatoes were hot. This kept the patties together nicely. I used a salad spinner to drain the cabbage & carrot mix, used less than a full onion and served with sour cream. Great recipe, simple to make, will make over & over again!

We loved the flavor of these.  Had trouble keping the patties together though.  However, that could be out fault becase we madethe mixture earlier in the day and them shaped them cold.  It didn't matter though because ecooked it "hash" style and let it get crispy in spots.  Thanks for the recipe.  We will make it again and next time we will follow the directions and shape the patties while it's still all warm.

this is a fantastic side dish! I added a little milk and butter to the potatoes and they held together without a problem. I needed to be careful when flipping them but it was fine. I may leave out the mustard next time but thats just personal taste.

Wow! My 2 year old dug IN to this! I couldn't get it to stick together, so I think I will make the patties smaller and squeeze more liquid out next time - and believe me - there WILL be a next time! These were SO yummy!

Amazing!! I didn't have raw cabbbage ate the time, so I used cooked cabbage instead. I used 3 potatoes, and 4 carrots, and it was enough to make 6 huge patties. For seasoning, I added honey mustard, onion and garlic powder, plus salt and pepper.  If I made this next time, i would add either sausage bits or bacon to it. That would be grand. I am definitely making this soon

I will make this again even though my patties didn't hold their shape well.  I almost felt like maybe an egg added to the ingredients might have worked well here.  I did follow to recipe closely though.  My recipe yielded 7 good sized patties.  I put the left overs in the refrigerator and eat them for my breakfast after a little heating up.  Thank you for the recipe.

I've made these potato patties for years.  Didn't know I was making Bubble and Squeak.  I have always pre-cooked the onions a little too, I fry them in a little olive oil.   Makes a very good and easy side dish.  I remember eating these at my Grandmothers house when we were little.  She was a full bloded Scotchman.  I don't remember ever hearing her call them Bubble and squeak.  Just potato patties.

Delicious and simple to prepare.  I sautéed the cabbage and onions for a deeper flavor and left out the cheddar because I thought it would get lost with the other flavors in it.  Served with a horseradish cream sauce which was a great accompaniment!

I made these almost exactly as described, although I left the potato skins on for additional nutrition. I really liked these a lot! I would definitely recommend them and I'm sure I'll be making them again in the future, should I happen to have the ingredients handy. I ate these with Forfar bridies (another recipe I pulled from AllRecipes.com) and the two complimented each other nicely. 

As a side note, if you are a fan of the Outlander book/TV series, these are one of many Scottish dishes mentioned. Eat these and feel one step closer to the lives of the characters in the book.

The previous bubble and squeak I have made was kind of bland so went looking for a new recipe. This is it! Simple yet tasty. The mustard really sets it apart for us. I may have added more mustard than called for as I just eyeballed all of the ingredients. 

A bonus is the mix keeps well if you cannot get through all of it at once.  Just wrap it in plastic wrap like cookie dough!

A different side dish when your tired of the same old thing night after night. I did make a few small changes. I used 3 c. cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage and carrot, omitted the fresh onion and used powder and omitted the mustard altogether. I also added in 2T. chopped fresh parsley for color. Garnished with a bit more chopped parsley and a dollop of sour cream.  Will make these again. Thank you.

Great recipe.  To make it vegan, I replaced the cheese with nutritional yeast and a bit of smoked paprika. I think the onion was a bit too strong and should be cooked a bit.  I might very slightly carmelize it first next time.

Really, really good. I think the next time I make them, I'll make 8 smaller patties instead of 4 large ones, and pan fry them rather than use the grill pan, so that there's more crispy outside. But definitely making this again!

My sister and I followed the recipe, but the patties were so flimsy that we couldn't even flip them! So we just left the mix alone and ate it uncooked... it was good then, which is the only reason this gets two stars instead of one... :/
