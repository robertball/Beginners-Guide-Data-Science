Like the recipe, but changed it to match what needed used up. My family like it but  not with great enthusiasm.

I sauteed an onion, garlic, and mushrooms which were sliced. Moved to baking dish. Browned one pound of ground beef, drained and and moved to baking dish along with a half a small jar of salsa, tomato paste, and filled the salsa jar with water and added that too.  Seasoned with basic stuff, and sprinkled cheddar cheese. Put a layer of tatter tots and sprinkled more cheese on top of the tots. Baked for 40 minutes at 350.

Would make it again cause I really like it. Would use and full can of salsa and enough water to get the last of the salsa out of the jar

Yum! I made this as written, except I put the tots on top because I like crispy tots.

Good, but nothing of nutritional value in it. We ate fruit on the side, but the sloppy tots were pretty filling on their own.

Sorry, but I found it disappointing. The sloppy joe mixture overwhelmed the tots so much I could barely taste them.

My family loved this recipe.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.  So easy!  The only addition was a little bit of ketchup on the top.

This was a nice and easy weeknight meal.  The kids loved it and so did the grown ups!  The recipe as-is would feed a family of 4 with no leftovers.  Next time I will double it so we can have larger portions.
