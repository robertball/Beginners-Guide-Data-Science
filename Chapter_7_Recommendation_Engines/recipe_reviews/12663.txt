Tasty but recipe instructions need clarification.  I removed the casing from the sausage and mixed meat by hand with ketchup and seasonings.  Layed uncooked meat filling down the center of pastry, taking up approximately one third.  Pastry strips should be cut at an angle and folded criss-cross fashion over filling to resemble a braid.  An egg wash turned the pastry a pretty golden brown.  Baked at 400 for 15 minutes then reduced to 375.

Since I don't eat pork, I substituted Turkey Sausage, stirring in about 1T crisco.  Because I really wanted to try this, but was feeling lazy after work, and because I happened to have puff pastry in my freezer, I used that as my dough, brushed with a beaten egg before baking.  The tastes are wonderful! I will be serving this often.  Thanks for the recipe Syd

This recipe is easy and the flavor is scrumptious! We love it! My only trouble is that the pastry ends up all "melty" on the bottom b/c of the oils from the sausage...anyone have better ideas?

This tasted good but was a bit too labor-intensive for me. Hard boiling the eggs,pre-cooking the sausage and making, rolling and cutting the dough took a lot of time, made quite a mess and left me with a lot of dirty pans and utensils.

The dough for this was good.  Not sure we liked the filling too much.  I seemed like more dough was needed to cover the meat and it was a little too soft to work with.  Edible but we probably won't make it again.
