It's great; I make it all the time. The only change that I would make is I melt a stick of butter (not margarine) and then cube 2# of velveeta up and add to the butter. Stir until the cheese is melted. The butter makes the cheese creamier. I then add the 1# of cooked and drained "hot" sausage and 1 can of drained rotel.  So delicious.

This dip came out delicious. I used a pound of sausage and also 3 slices of american cheese and a stick of butter. I melted the cheese in the microwave and added everything to the croc pot to stay warm until later. Great recipe.

This is an awesome dip.  I use sausage or ground beef and I also add a block of cream cheese to the pot.   Because cream cheese makes everything better, right?

I added 1/4 stick of butter to make it creamier. I also added  1/2 can Ro*tel diced tomatoes with chilis and 1/2 cup mild salsa as we don't like it too spicy hot. Wonderful recipe thanks for sharing.

I forgot how sinfully good this is.  I prepped this the day before Super Bowl, on top of the stove.  Could have eaten a bowl right then!  Microwaved for our scoops at lunch.  Then had ham and cheese sliders for our party for 2.  He asked me to make the dip more often.  I used leftovers on top of fried potatoes and he had some on top of his burger.  You can't go wrong with this dip.

I made two changes based on what I had handy. I used taco seasoned beef because I already had some. The other change I made was the Ro-tel, I used the Chipotle flavor. This gave it a whole new flavor that went over very well at a friends birthday party. The sausage recipe would benefit from this, and I'm thinking of trying the Fire Roasted tomatoes next. I've come to the conclusion that this recipe is very hard to mess up. I love this because it's SO easy to make.

This is a staple in our home for parties. Everyone loves this dip!  We've did half and half with the meat before (half sausage, half ground beef) and used salsa instead of the tomatoes (just to change it up once and awhile.) We haven't found a way we didn't like it yet!

This is one of those dips where people say, "Wow!" and think you're much more talented than simply throwing everything into a crock pot.  I highly recommend this.  

I'm going to experiment with adding some amount of ground beef to this too.

I love a chunky queso, so I added two cans of black beans, two cans of pinto beans, two cups of kernel corn, one onion diced, one small can diced green chilies, and used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage.  My family loves it and I've been asked for the recipe multiple times. Yum!!

Added a package of cream cheese and cooked it all on the stove in the same pan. Makes it thicker. I don't even like sausage and I absolutely love this along with everyone who tried it. Always getting asked for the recipe!!
