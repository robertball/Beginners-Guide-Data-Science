These are great!  A little time consuming (but that is the nature of bread baking).  I have 2 small sons, so I made 18 smaller rolls, it cut cooking time down to just over 15 minutes.  The house smelt amazing while these were baking - excellent while still warm with butter!!!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I was desperate for a good hot cross bun recipe to make at Easter and this worked really well.  I changed some of the ingredients and method slightly to suit - I omitted the egg, and instead creamed the butter and sugar with the cinnamon (I also added nutmeg, vanilla essence and citrus peel to the fruit).  I prefer to make smaller buns so I cut the dough into eight pieces and made four small buns out of each piece - 32 total.  I found them sweet enough if using a sugar glaze on top.  Thanks very much Arvilla - you saved my first Easter in Japan.

The buns came out huge and beautiful looking but taste wise, they were bland. I guess I expected them to turn out sweeter. Maybe next time I'll add more sugar.

I thought the dough could be a little sweeter but my husband thought it was perfect, so there you go.  I used a combination of dried and candied fruit.  The texture is spot on.  We both agreed that an icing drizzle on the top enhanced not only the appearance but taste.
