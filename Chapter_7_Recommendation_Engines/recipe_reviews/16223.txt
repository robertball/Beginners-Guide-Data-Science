These rolls are tasty and foolproof.  Letting them rise the longer amount of time results in a softer, fluffier roll.  I skipped the eggwash step to minimize the fuss. The rolls turned out delicious.
I also tried tossing in about a tsp. of dill, oregano and basil at the beginning, then shaping the rolls a little larger for hamburger buns. Again, the recipe turned out delicious.
Note: For bread machine baking, it is IMPERITIVE to measure the flour carefully, by spooning it into a measuring cup and leveling off the top.  If you scoop the flour from the bag using the measuring cup itself, the flour compacts and the resulting bread will be dry, dense, or worse.

These are wonderful!  I have made these several times already, and the only two changes I made are 
1. I use butter on the top rather than an egg wash.
2. I make them a little smaller, with up to 18 in a batch.
That having been said, these really are wonderful, homemade rolls!  
     Another review mentioned freezing the dough, and I have found that it works well.  Here's how: make the dough, then divide it into the rolls, shaped appropriately.  Do not let the dough rise, but freeze the pieces on a flat baking sheet.  After they are frozen, you may store them in a freezer-appropriate container - I end up with two layers, separated by waxed paper.  Freeze, then when it is time to bake a few, take the desired number of rolls, then thaw the dough on full power in the microwave for 50 seconds (this worked well for me, but is more than was recommended by an earlier reviewer).  Let them rise in a warm place for at least 40 minutes, then bake them as the recipe says.  This is a great way to make just a few rolls, as you need them.

Good luck!

Absolutely delicious! I was a little leery after reading the reviews about the bread being sweet, so I cut the sugar down by 1/2 tablespoon. I also didn't have any powdered milk, so instead of the water, I heated some skim milk and added it. I found these rolls to be superb, and not sweet at all. I think the criticism that the rolls were heavy can be fixed by letting the rolls rise an additional 15 minutes. Also, you needn't bother with the egg white wash! If you want glossy rolls, just rub a little butter on the tops after they come out of the oven. They will wow your family at dinner, with such little effort!

Outstanding! I followed the recipe as written, but didn't have a pkg. of yeast. FYI - 1 pkg of yeast is equal to 2 1/4 teaspoons!!! These will be a common item on our table!

Lovely, yeasty rolls. Make only what you will consume in one sitting, as they lose a lot of quality by the next day. Easy to make. Not the absolute best I've ever had, either in texture or taste, but a very good everyday dinner roll. 

Make them "brown and serve" style by baking them about 15-18 minutes at 250 degrees, removing them before any browning has occurred. Cool completely and freeze. When ready, take out what you need, brush with egg wash, and bake on a cookie sheet in preheated 400 degree oven for 7 minutes, or until nicely browned.

Thanks for the recipe.  These rolls are very easy to make.  I wasn't sure how much yeast was in a .25 package as I buy the jars so I used 1 1/2 tsp.  They came out great.  Can't wait to try them today on a sandwich.  Best roll recipe I have tried yet!

This is the best roll recipe I have found.  With my bread machine, it takes 3 hrs from start to finish from the oven.  Also, I use a metal 9 x 13 cake pan and it takes exactly 20 min.  I don't use the egg white and water but instead when they come out of the oven, I coat them generously with butter.  That makes them nice and soft. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious rolls! These tasted amazing. I will definitely be making these again. The first time I made them, I shaped them into 12 large rolls and they came out looking something like hamburger buns. The second time, I shaped them into 18 smaller rolls. Both times they disappeared fast!

Excellent recipe. I divided the dough into clover shapes (three round balls of dough in the same muffin round)and egg washed. They pull apart beautifully!

I'm sorry, but.... I have tried this recipe twice and neither time seemed correct to me. I will echo the 11/29 reviewer's comment that the dough was dense and sweet. This is not a bad recipe; I think it would be great for cinnamon rolls. I'll keep looking for a dinner roll recipe, though.

These are awesome!!  I feel justified in keeping my bread machine now.  :)

I didn't have any powdered milk, so substituted 1 and 1/4 cups skim milk in place of the water and milk powder.  My husband absolutely LOVES these and requests them at least once a week.

thank you!

My family LOVED these rolls. If you follow the recipe to the tee (although I didn't do the egg wash) AND take the advise of another reviewer and spoon the flour into the measuring cup instead of dipping the cup in the flour, I promise you they will turn out perfect! 

Just a little tip that may help those who are making a lot of rolls at one time, you can pull the dough out, divide and roll and place in the frig for the night. I pulled them out the next day, let them rise for about 45min - an hour and baked them. I didn't use the egg wash and they browned really nice! I will be making these A LOT in the future

My husband and I are trying to stay on a healthy diet and this recipe was easily adapted to fit in with our lifestyle. I used 1 1/2 cups of bread flour and 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of 3 cups of bread flour and I replaced the three tablespoons of white sugar with 3 tablespoons of Splenda Sugar Mix to reduce the sugar content. The rolls turned out great and even my teenage daughter who's not thrilled with wheat bread was impressed, in fact she finished off the last of them!

I used this recipe to make hamburger rolls. I rolled the dough out and cut them with a large round cookie cutter, let them rise, than used the egg wash and a sprinkling of sesame seeds and poppy seeds for each roll. Baked for 20 minutes and voila, perfect hamburger buns! Great recipe, will use again.

Absolutely delicious!  I am munching on one right now.  The only caution that I have is that it took longer to bake them than 15 minutes.  I pulled them out at 15 minutes and they were golden brown, but doughy on the inside.  I added seven more minutes and they were done.  As a twist, I added shredded cheese to them and topped them with a little more.  Lovely!  My little bread secret is to add four teaspons of vital wheat gluten and one crushed up vitamin c tablet to every batch of bread that I make.  Makes the yeast rise more effectively and the dough to hold its shape.  I'll be making these again and again!

This roll recipe is super easy and tastes great! I ended up making these with a fussy 6 wk old baby in one hand while I measured out the ingredients into the bread machine with the other, and I still didn't manage to mess them up!!  ;-) I made changes based on other reviews as follows: fresh milk, not powdered, so added an additional 1/4c flour, subbed 1/2c wheat flour for reg. Brushed with butter out of the oven instead of egg wash. I didn't find them too sweet, so I wouldn't decrease the sugar. To serve these with something like roast, in the future I will make 18 smaller rolls. Due to the previously mentioned fussy baby, I made 12, 6 lovely round rolls, and 6 odd shaped rolls that were the product of cutting the 2nd half of dough into 6 'equal' pieces and throwing them on the pan to rise. Again, they all turned out soft on the inside and brown on the outside. Given my experience with this tonight, I would call this recipe fool proof for sure!

These came out great. I used milk 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup water at 110 degrees (because no powdered milk in house).  Added yeast plus a bit of the sugar to the liquid ( had to check because my yeast was a bit old).  Then dumped yeast mixture into dry ingredients in bread machine. Used 2 cups AP and 1 cup whole wheat white flour. Added 3 teaspoons of gluten which essentially makes Ap into bread flour. Used dough cycle on machine and but checked as the dough was kneading in machine. Added 2 tablespoons of water because the dough felt dry. It varies sometimes because of humidity in air etc. Then followed recipe. Great results. Happy results. Only 3 roll/buns left and they will be headed out for lunch sandwiches today. We will make this again and again.

Wow, these rolls are HEAVENLY!  They come out looking just like the picture and taste even better!  This recipe is a keeper, I will make it again and again!

Do keep in mind that most bread maker dough cycles are 1.5 hours, then it has to rise again for another 40 mins, so this does take longer than the prep time listed.

These rolls were SO easy to make and SO delicious!  I've never used the bread machine to make rolls before, it's amazing!  This is great when you need to work on other dishes while the dough is being made.

I used your recipe then made garlic pull aparts. After the dough is fininshed in the bread machine i made individual rolls. Then dipped them in a mixture of butter garlic salt, chives, minced onion. Then put them one by one in a bundt pan. Baked at 350 then buttered the top and shook some parmesan on them. My hubby just raved about these. Thank You

These are excellent and easy to make.  Everyone loved them.  This will be my staple for easy good breadmachine rolls! I don't know how much a package of yeast is, i put 2 tsp of yeast in breadmaker, its perfect!!  I think this is the best dough recipe you can make into bun yourself.  A fresh yeasty tasting bun.  It makes an easy dozen. I won't make ANY other recipe.  A SUCCESS!!

What can I be doing wrong?!  I have a Panasonic bread machine, and not one bread recipe listed on this web site turns out!  These rolls failed to rise, (with new yeast--should I have used Rapid Rise?) even with following the directions exactly.  The mixes in the box turn out great, as do the recipes included with the machine.  Any help would be appreciated.  These were awful.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy to make in the bread machine.  My husband and kids devoured them, and then requested that I make them again with our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for an easy, delicious dinner roll recipe!

These are great. I set the timer for 40 minutes to let them rise and I must have been outside when the timer went off... they sat longer and they were great. REALLY light and fluffy. Thanks for sharing :-)

I made these for the first time last night.  They were very easy to make, and my husband absolutely loved them.  I thought they were pretty good, but I'm not a big bread eater.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I don't normally make bread because they either don't rise or they are rock hard or both. These are easy and great tasting soft rolls. Not to sweet just enough. I will make again.

Kay: thanks for posting this recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly and my entire family raved about them.  I did have dry milk on hand for other bread recipes, however, I've read that if you don't simply reduce water to 3/4 cup & add 1/4 cup regular milk. Both work great!  Once the dough was done I followed original directions. I seperated it into about 18 pieces, rolled them, loosely covered them with sprayed saran wrap & let rise about an hour.  At first I thought that each roll didn't appear that big but as they baked they rose a bit more. I brushed each one with softened butter. They turned out amazing....a definite keeper.  Freeze: after shaping, freeze either on sprayed sheet or muffin pan until frozen. Place in container seperating layers with wax paper. Take out what you need, microwave on high for 50 sec, cover loosely with sprayed saran wrap, let rise an hour. Bake at 350 for 15 min.

No need to look any further. These were absolutely THE BEST. I didn't change anything except I forgot to add the butter.  I also used 1/2 white 1/2 wheat flour and added 1T wheat germ just because I'm trying to use it up. I made them into hamburger buns. Never again will I pay $4.00 for a pack of organic hamburger buns when these are a fraction of the cost and taste 2000% better.  Oh yeah, I skipped the egg wash at the very end and brushed olive oil instead. Sprinkled sesame seeds on top and put them in the oven. Mmmmmm.... SO GOOD!!!!

Wonderful recipe!!! Hard to find good recipes for rolls to make with a bread machine.  I made them tonight, and they turned out excellent with a great flavor.  I don't know what some of the other "reviewers" are doing that they turn out so sweet, but these were not sweet at all...but perfect!!!! Thanks for sharing.  I'll keep this one!

My family thought these rolls were great!  I used 1 cup of wheat flour, and 2 cups of bread flour.  Next time I'll probably try more wheat flour, just because of preference.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Easy to make even for beginners! I substituted 1/4C rolled oats for 1/4 C flour, but otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Made perfect burger buns and my house smells delicious!

great recipe.  we have used it for hamburger buns and hot dog buns.  both times I've made it I haven't had any dry milk, so I used close to a 1/4 cup of almond milk (due to a milk allergy) and the rest water (rather than a full cup of water).  we had leftover buns each time and my family ate them either plain or for a sandwich.

This is our family's favorite recipe. I didn't have any powdered milk, though, so I omitted the water and milk powder and replaced it with 1 cup warm milk. I also add an additional Tbs of sugar. We eat it with homemade honey butter. Yummy! (And easy!)

I am constantly asked to make these rolls when I'm hosting a holiday dinner, or bring them if I'm not!  I measure them out into 30g balls, place on a pie plate (I spray with Pam) and let them rise before putting them in the oven. Makes 3 pie plates worth (8-9, with one in the middle). I also followed the advice of one reviewer, and to make ahead, I let them rise, then bake for 15-18 minutes at 250F, cool and freeze.  Then I bake from frozen on a cookie sheet for 7 min in a 400F oven, keeping close watch to make sure they don't get too browned. I never use the egg wash, I found I never needed to. People will have 3 rolls with dinner, they are that good.

If you don't have any dry milk powder (like me!), omit it and replace the 1 cup of water with one cup of milk. This is the only change I made and these came out wonderful! I used the recipe for hamburger buns instead of dinner rolls, so instead of making 12 small rolls, I made 6 big buns. They were the perfect size, and they came out so flaky no one believed that I had whipped them up with my bread machine! Thanks!

Really great rolls. I have even used them for veggie burgers and made mini pizzas out of them. Very easy, great taste and texture...all from an inexpensive bread machine that I am only beginning to learn how to use. Update: I am still making these light and tender rolls with no problems. You should be sure to spoon the flour into the measuring cups, not pack it, and don't roll the dough out, just pat into balls. My husband says they're "too light" for his "man sandwiches", but otherwise we love them!

Yummy...I made these last night to go with our spaghetti meal.  We had family over so I doubled the amounts and used 1/2 unbleached flour, 1/2 whole wheat and omitted the milk.  We're vegan so I'm always trying to make recipes that our visiting family doesn't think are too weird or different.  These are perfect, the family loved them, just gobbled them up.  Instead of the eggwash, I brushed them with "butter" fresh out of the oven and they were perfect.  I can definitely see how these would make good burger buns when made larger.  I did let my buns rise about double the time I usually do so that made for an even lighter roll.  The dough did start to rise up out of the breadmachine as it was rising (I doubled the recipe), but I just propped open the top of it and it was fine.

I Left out the milk and egg white wash.  My dinner guests arrived early so the bread sat out 10 minutes instead of 40. Regardless, they doubled in size in the oven and everyone loved them!

I was making something else at the same time I was making these rolls and used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  I thought for sure I had ruined them.  To my surprise, they still turned out great!  I will be making them again with the right type of flour this time and I'm sure they will be even better.  Took another reviewers tip and made honey butter to go with them.  Thank you so much for a recipe that will be used very frequently in our home!

After the egg wash I sprinkled sesame seeds on the rolls. Instead of baking at 350 degrees f. I baked at 375 degrees f. for 13 minutes. They turned out great.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Words cannot express how good these rolls were.  My 5 year old son told me I can make these everyday and that he wanted to eat 100 of them tonight at dinner.  My husband and his brother both could not remember when they had tasted better rolls-these were just incredible.  I am making another batch tonight-they are so easy and so terrific.  Try this recipe-you will be a star for it!

Excellent!  I have used this recipe many times. 

I open freeze them, then pop into a plastic bag. I can then use them one by one if necessary. I thaw them for about 20 seconds in my microwave and they are just as good as when freshly baked.

I always have a stock of them in my freezer. Thanks for the recipe.

I decided on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving that I wanted to make homemade rolls.  This recipe was simple.  I made two batches. I am new to bread making, so I was somewhat worried that they would not work.  The recipe is fool proof.  I rolled the dough in balls and placed it in a disposable round foil cake pan.  I covered with glad wrap and put in the refrigerator.  I took them out the next morning and let them warm up to room temperature so that they could rise.  I brushed them lightly with olive oil and popped them in the oven.  They looked like they came off a magazine cover.  Great recipe that made it look like I knew what I was doing!!!

Great, easy recipe! I didn't have any powdered milk on hand so just used 1 cup of milk in place of the water. Also, went ahead and used a whole egg for the wash before baking. Really nice color and shine on the finished rolls. Definitely a recipe I'll keep and use again.

These were absolutely fabulous! This was the first time I've made rolls with my bread machine, but they turned out perfect! I divided the dough into 36 balls and put 3 in each muffin cup to make 12 over-sized pull apart rolls. After reading the reviews, I let them rise for an hour.  I put a dab of butter on each one before baking instead of the egg whites and they were delish! I will definitely be making these again soon!!

Excellent bread rolls.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of honey for the sugar and 2 tablespoons of canola oil for the butter (didn't have butter on hand). Used 2cups bread flour, 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal, just to make it healthier.  Let rise for 1 hour after splitting into rolls.

Very nice dinner rolls.  I didn't have any powdered milk, so I used powdered buttermilk instead, which worked fine.  I let mine rise a good hour and a half.  Baked exactly 15 minutes, and they turned out beautifully.  Can't wait to serve these with dinner tonight (although I did try one already with a little Nutella - just so I could write this review).  Thanks!

I have made this recipe without the dry milk powder and actually like it better. Great recipe. I have also added onion or garlic bits after the egg wash,before baking. Just love them and make these rolls several times a week.

These rolls are EXCELLENT.  Not sweet or dense like some other reviewers said.   The only thing I did different is brown them by cooking them an additional 5 minutes.  Perfect.  Thanks for this new Thanksgiving roll for my family dinner.

I'd never used the dough cycle on my bread machine before, but it worked just fine with this recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and brushed melted butter over the finished rolls rather than use an egg wash.  I got twelve very generously-sized rolls out of the recipe, and they came out dense and chewy like the ones at my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I set butter out on the table, but nobody used it because the rolls tasted buttery enough already.  I often prefer a crisp crust on my dinner rolls, but my husband loved these exactly as they were.  I'll definitely make them again, perhaps trying them with poppyseeds sprinkled on top.

I misread the recipe and put half a cup of dried milk instead of a quarter and put the egg white in by mistake.  Made the best rolls ever!

I have made these rolls, so many times now.  They are great.  I have frozen the dough, pre shaped as recommended by an earlier review, its a great idea, but I do find the dough does not rise as much as when you make them straight from scratch.  I have now stared to brush the top of the rolls with milk, instead of egg.  It seems to have a more crunchy finish and I would prefer the finished colour.  I know I will be using this recipe for a long time!

I always substitute warm milk for the water and powdered milk.  I have made this recipe many times and I love how versatile it is!  I have made dinner rolls, sandwich bread, hoagies, and even pizza crust with this recipe.  For some flavor, I sometimes add garlic powder and Italian seasoning for delicious sandwich buns.  This is my go-to recipe when making bread.  Try this recipe and don't be afraid to experiment and make it your own.  It is very adaptable and gives excellent results every time!

Soft and squishy homemade rolls!  I am a novice - didn't know if I could use bread machine yeast or if I had to use a packet of active dry.  I did both and they turned out perfect both times.  In fact, the second time I put in 1/2 cup too much water and didn't realize until three minutes into cycle.  I added more ingred. to compensate and it was perfect.  Very forgiving.  Also brushed with butter prior to baking.  Yummy.  If you make them small, roll some cheese in them and bake for less time.  So good.

These rolls were great. My 6 yr old girl loved them. I found them to be a little too sweet and would most likely cut back the white sugar to 2 tblspns next time I'm making them. Instead of just doing a regular bun, I rolled a piece of dough to form a log about 1 inch in width and 10 inch in length. Then, I simply tied the dough in a basic knot and pushed the ends up through the middle so there were no holes. I let them rise with a teatowel covering (not damp) and then after 1 hr I brushed with a beaten egg and sprinkled them with sesame and poppy seeds.(see photo)Update for Bonnie - instead of using a teatowel, use clingfilm sprayed with oil & make sure it doesn't overrise. My advice is make sure your liquid in the yeast is warm enough to bloom, once you roll them into buns don't put a cover over it.

These are Fantastic!! I had never made yeast rolls before & I didn't have any powdered milk,so I had to leave it out,but they turned out so wonderful I can't wait to make them again,With the powdered milk. I just sprayed the tops with some butter flavored spray, after I had shaped them & covered with wax paper,that way I could see how much they had risen. I didn't use the egg wash,but they looked just like the picture & They tasted marvelous!! The Best!!

Fabulous!  I made these for some mini burgers.  Really wonderful flavor, and perfect light texture.  The best rolls I've ever made.  I'll use this recipe over and over again.  I didn't have any milk powder on hand, so I just used a little milk, and a dash of buttermilk.  I don't know if it made a difference, but the result was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

For those like myself that buy yeast in bulk, I got this off the Red Star Yeast site

A 1/4 -ounce packet of active dry yeast contains approximately 2-1/2 teaspoons; the measurement will not be exact as yeast is packaged according to weight rather than volume.

This recipe is GREAT! I made them for a small dinner party and they were perfect. They turned out just like the picture on the website (for once). Would definitely make again - with no changes to the recipe. Only comment: Length of time to make them. The recipe says 1 hour, 35 minutes - but the dough cycle on my bread machine is 1 hour, 30 minutes alone - not including the prep time and the time it takes to rise a second time and bake. If your bread machine is the same way, plan on some additional time. Thanks for a great recipe!

These rolls are just like "store bought" but better.  The first time I made them about 2 mos. ago and they were perfect.  It is worth purchasing a bread machine to make these rolls.  I make these rolls on a daily basis.  I pack my son's lunch with one of these rolls and they are regular side at dinner.  They look exactly as the picture accompanying the recipe.  And the best part they are really simple and easy to make.  Trust me!!!

WOW!! These were delicious, and easy.  Everyone loved them, and they will be great for the holiday's.  I also left out the egg wash to make it easier, and they were still great.  Also, I found that they did take longer, my machine also takes 1hr and 30 min on the dough cycle.  Great!

The first time I made this recipe I was completely distracted and just tossed all the ingredients in at the same time. Egg whites, everything.... the result was the most fluffy and buttery rolls!!! (I did spread butter on the rolls before baking) My guests flipped over my goof!! Now I am required to bring these rolls to every large meal. 

I did try a test and made 2 batches. One my goof recipe and the other the originoriginal recipe. There was a significant differedifference and my goof won. One of the best mistakes I have ever made!!

This is a heavenly recipe.  I made the rolls yesterday using my bread machine, and no alterations to flour or liquid was necessary at all.  A perfect dough to work with....perfect consistency.  Since I had leftover meatballs, I made four long rolls with half the dough.  With warm weather predicted this weekend, I made four burger rolls with the other half.  Topped the rolls with sesame seeds after brushing with egg white.  The only addition to the recipe I made was adding 3 rounded teaspoons of vital wheat gluten, which I do to all my bread.  At 15 minutes at 350 degrees, they were nicely browned, and so so soft, fluffy and slightly chewy.  They held up great to our meatballs, and now can't wait to try them with the burgers.  Really a terrific recipe.  Thanks so much!!!

AMAZING!  I wish I could give it higher stars.  Reminded me of the rolls they serve at Ryan's Steakhouse.  I froze half the batch - separated into rolls and before the last rise (out of the machine) - so I'll update when I see how well those do.  One reviewer said to defrost for 50 seconds in microwave, let rise 40 min, and then bake as directed.
UPDATE:  Freezing and rethawing method works perfectly.  This is my go to roll/bun recipe.

These are my husband's new favorite roll.  I make them for him at least once a week.  These are so easy to make - I dump everything in the bread machine right before I go pick the kids up at the bus stop! I use All Purpose flour b/c that is what I keep on hand.  I also dont use the milk powder - I just substitute the warm water with 1/2 milk and 1/2 water.  I also skip the egg white/water wash at the end and they still brown nicely.

So great! Best bread roll recipe, hands down. Great with garlic butter or anything else I'm sure. Slightly sweet like french bread usually is. Perfectly fluffy, soft and flavorful :) I don't think I'm going to buy french bread loaves anymore!

Wow!!  Not only were these easy, they were incredibly delicious!  They were good right out of the oven but exceptional after they cooled.  My husband ate 3 of them in the first sitting (and hes not a "big" guy). I WILL be making these again.  I look forward to trying variations with seeds, herbs and seasonings.

The rolls were great! I acually put some fried chicken tenders between them with swiss cheese and made sandwichs. The recipe was super easy. It took me around 2 hours to make, my breadmachine on the dough setting took an hour and a half, and then let them sit for 45 minutes, but the 15 minute bake time was perfect timing. I will make this these rolls many more times! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These were outstanding!  Nice and soft and tasted great with the Slow Cooked Buffalo Chicken (recipe from this site).  I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 Tbsp and formed the dough into 8 hoagie shaped rolls.

Oh my goodness...these were heavenly!!  I added one more TBS of sugar because I like bread a little sweeter...  Also, I didn't add the egg wash....  I just paint a little butter on the tops when they are done.  This recipe was goooooood!!!

I made these rolls yesterday and they turned out wonderful.  I brushed them with egg wash after the rose and sprinkled them with "everything" spices.  This is the only recipe I will ever use for rolls as there can't be a better or easier one.  Have already passed it along to two friends.

Followed recipe (somewhat lazily and eyeballed some ingredients)- came out perfect. soooo easy and yummy.  I've made this about 5 times.  Absolute keeper.  I've varied whole wheat and white with great success as well.

I've made this recipe twice, and have been happy both times. My one change was using fresh milk, and adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour. Tonight I rolled into small balls and added three to a muffin tin. Thanks for an easy recipe, and a nice change to the bread on our dinner table.

Theses were really good. If you want to use them for sandwich rolls, I would recommend you divide the dough into 8 rolls rather than 12. I did 10 and they were still a little small for a hamburger. They tasted delicious and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly.

I love this recipe. I have made them three times this week. Once for dinner rolls and then for sandwich rolls. They are excellent. For dinner rolls I rub tops with butter for sandwich rolls I do the egg wash. Nice and soft better than the store rolls I bought. I do add 2 tablespoons vital wheat gluten to the recipe. This one is a keeper.

I made these the night after making Slow Cooker Pulled Pork SUBMITTED BY: LORIWAGNER on the allrecipes.com site and used them as rolls for the leftover pork.  The consistency and flavor was perfect for a "sandwich roll" and worked equally as well as a roll for Bread & Butter.  My family LOVED them and asked that I not wait too long to make them again!  Definitely a repeatable dish!!  :-)

Delicious!  The bread rolls are ever so slightly sweet.  I paired them with a roast beef stew for dinner last night and needless to say there weren’t many rolls left today.  In fact I currently have another batch rising in the bread maker.  The change I did make was because I did not have any powered milk I substituted it for whole milk and cut the water back to ¾ cup to keep the liquid portion to ratio.  I also baked the rolls without the egg white wash.  Wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I use this bread recipe for all my bread needs! I just toss every thing in the machine then 1.5 hours later take the bread out put it on wax paper and use a pizza cutter to roughly divide the dough to as many rolls as I need. I also use this bread for pepperoni rolls (which I may add taste better than the country club bakery's and anyone who knows any thing about pepperoni rolls know that in its self is a feat!)I also eat this with cheese fondu just cut the dough in to quarter size pieces-Perfect!!!! Or use as bread bowls- you can not go wrong with this recipe!!! Yummy!!!!

This is an awesome recipe.  This is my second time making rolls. The first time I used a recipe from someone else.  This one is is better by far.  I did use less sugar and more salt because some reviews mentioned them being a little too sweet and not salty enough.  Personally, I did not think they were sweet at all so I will probably use the exact amount of sugar next time and still use a little more salt.  I did not have powered milk so I used a cup of 1% and I still think they came out well.  I will probably try th powerdered milk next time to see which is better.  Thanks for this recipe.

I made half a recipe and used 2 teaspoons of yeast, I don't use packages.  I also don't used powdered milk, so I did not use it.  I also skipped the egg whites.  My husband went crazy over them. They turned out great!!

Fantastic! I just made these today for our Thanksgiving dinner. I had a little extra time on my hands so I thought I would give it a try even though I had brown and serve rolls already. I'm so glad I took the time. They were so quick and easy and so tastey! I used whole egg wash and they were great.

Outstanding flavor!  These rolls are a little on the sweet side, but I like them that way.  My husband agreed that they were wonderful, but suggested adding a little more salt (but that may just be his bias as he loves salt).  Very easy recipe to follow, and the dough is easy to work with.  I will definitely be making these again!

I used King Arthur flour for machines and it made a very STRONG dough.  Probably a dough relaxer would have helped.  We all thought the rolls were excellent!  I didn't even bother with the egg wash, just rubbed them with butter when they came out of the oven.  It was a very easy recipe to complete.  Also, one reviewer noted that they weren't as good the second day.  I kept the last remaining roll purposely closed up tightly on the kitchen counter for several days.  I kept tearing a bite off each day and tasted it. It was still very tender and fresh on the second day.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  I will be making them again!

These rolls turned out beautifully. I didn't have an egg but the rolls were a perfect color regardless - they looked just like the picture! I actually made 20 rolls out of the dough, not 12, and they puffed up to a perfect dinner roll size. I will be making these to accompany Christmas dinner. :)

These were the BEST, would give them more stars if possible!  Made them to go with Beef Barley Stew and family of 5 gorged themselves on these.  Only changes-took previous reviewers idea and used 13x9 pan, taked 10 minutes and got 12 nice size rolls.  Also, didn't have an egg, so I brushed tops with butter when they came out of the oven.  Will be using this regularly...once a week or more.  Thanks Kay, this is a winner!

Great rolls! I have made them twice this week. My two kids loved helping--actually they did most of the work! We did let them rise for longer than 40 minutes--more like an hour or maybe a little longer. But overall very easy. Little work for a big reward!

The rolls taste great, but I can't seem to get the golden color on top so they don't look as good as I would like them to.

I didn't break it up into rolls. I just made a normal loaf. 
AWESOME!!!  Best sandwich bread ever. Soft inside, flaky outside crust. Thanks so much!

Perfect basic dinner roll recipe.  Made these last night and served along with chili.  Yum!  Broke my own rule of never substituting when trying a first time recipe - no powdered milk.  Used 3/4 c. warm milk and 1/4 c. water.  Easy, delicious, inexpensive!  What more can one ask?  Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent and easy! I used one cup of milk instead of the milk powder and water. I stuffed them all into one 9"x11" pan, and they expanded almost to the point that you couldn't tell one from another. Next time I'll give them more room to rise!

I did a practice run of these today for Easter tomorrow and they turned out really well!  I may bump up the sugar just a touch tomorrow and see how they turn out.  But these were delicious and soooo easy!

Love these rolls!  Been making this recipe for about 1 year now.  Delish!  Tonight replaced 1 Cup Bread Flour with Spring Wheat - very good!  (Use 2 1/2 teaspoons of Yeast - rather than the package.)

There are NOT enough stars!!!  I ran out of bread flour so I had to improvise at the last minute.  So my bread is based on 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 AP flour.  I made these because my kids prefer a roll to bread slices on their sandwiches when they go to school.  Not only will they be sandwich rolls, I will use them for hamburger rolls and hotdog rolls too!  They are so soft and the crust is so light and tender with just the right "snap" when you bite into one.  I did not brush butter or the egg white on the rolls.  Truth be told, I saw how pretty the rolls came out that I totally forgot...and did not miss it.  When I shaped the rolls..or "unshaped" maybe, I used English muffin rings.  I only cut the circles out after rolling the dough, let them rise...less than 40 minutes (it only took 30 min), and baked.  The recipe made 12 4" rolls...so pretty, so tasty!  Thank you Kay for a wonderful recipe!

With no changes, these always turn out beautifully! One change: 1/2c. of mashed sweet potatoes add an extra sweetness (too much and you weigh down the rising of the rolls.)
I may swap out 1/2 flour for wheat flour. I have to make two batches because they are so yummy.

These are awesome! My husband and daughter LOVE them and they are great with burgers, sandwiches, pulled pork sliders, etc. FYI... I tried adding a cup of wheat flour in place of one of the cups of bread flour to make them a bit healthier and it didn't work. They didn't rise and were hard. I'll stick with the original....

I wish I could give this receipe 6 stars.  I LOVED these rolls.  I made 8 HUGE ones.  They kept fine wrapped in tin foil in the fridge, then microwaved.  No alterations- perfect the way it is.

Good bread, made 11 small hot dog buns I would doule for 12 or 14 reg size. Made changes only as necessary for allergies, but may help those w/out certain ingredients. 2T butter- 2T oil, 1/4 dry milk-1/4 oat milk and decrease water by 1/4c.

These rolls are excellent. My only deviations from the recipe were 1.) that I let the rolls rise in a warmed oven with greased plastic wrap over them; 2.) that I brushed with butter after baking rather than using the egg white mixture. So yummy!!!! Even my husband liked them and he's not a big fan of breads.

These rolls are wonderful!  I followed directions exactly, using a spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup which a comment said compacts the flour and results in a dry roll.  We've eaten two already and they're supposed to be for dinner.  Rave reviews - they are perfect!

1 pkg yeast = 2 1/4 teaspoons.  Make larger (only 6 to 8) rolls for sandwiches.  1 C flour = 4.25 oz.  Weighing is more accurate.

****update**** change review from 4 stars to 5, after you make these a few times they get better.  I now make a batch ever week and have them for breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches during the week.  So much better for you then over processed grocery store bread. I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, instead of sugar I used honey, all the flavors work really well together.

I LOVE this roll recipe!  I'm making it for the 3rd time since Thanksgiving and it's only Dec. 9th!  The last time I made these, I used half the dough for cinnamon rolls.  I just spread butter on top of the rolled out dough and topped it w/ br. sugar and cinnamon.  Cut them into rolls and baked them on their side.  I usually cut the dough into 8 pieces for my mini loaf pan.  It's so fun to see people's reaction when they get their own mini loaf of bread.

Edited to say that I don't use softened butter.  I just cut up my 2 TBLS. of butter into 4 chunks and place in the corners of the my bread machine after all ingredients have been added.

An excellent recipe that turned out great!! I substituted one tablespoon of honey for one of the tablespoons of sugar for a little sweeter flavor. Other than that I made no other changes. Will make these for Thanksgiving this year!!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  I doctored it up by adding 1/4t Italian seasoning and 1T dried rosemary.  I added them because I was tossed between making this and making Jo's Rosemary Bread (another great recipe from this site.)

I've never made rolls using my bread machine before, and I'm wondering what took me so long.  These were great!  I subbed 1 cup of wheat bread because I just can't make white bread...  I baked them for 20 min in 250 F b/c I'm freezing them.  However, I finished one in the oven (a few min at 425) to test them. Since I was baking only one, I skipped the egg wash.  They are a bit sweet but very good! Yum!

Great rolls - my son had three! I didn't have milk powder so I used 1/2 c. warm water mixed with 1/2 c. (soy) milk. Next time, I'd add 1/4 c. more flour since the dough was very sticky, but otherwise they were a dream.

These are the best bread machine rolls I have ever tasted. They taste just like sarah lee dinner rolls. I baked them and let them cool before putting in a bread bag and freezing. When we want rolls with dinner I wrap a couple in foil and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. FANTASTIC everytime. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

Not the best but good enough for a quick taste of yeast rolls.  I used fat free milk and added an egg to the ingredients.  Let them rise in a 200 degree oven for 30 minutes.  I'd make them again.

Yum!! I used the egg white and boy, was it worth it! The tops of the rolls were a beautiful, golden brown. I had honey butter to dip them in.:-) I froze some of them like others have suggested.  I microwaved them for 45 seconds on full power, then let them rise under a damp cloth for about 20 mins. Ideally, you want to let them rise longer, I just ran out of time. I didn't use the egg white, only butter brushed over the tops this time, and they weren't quite as good.  But these are WELL worth the effort!!:-)

Yum.  I doubled this recipe and it lifted the lid of my breadmaker while it was rising, but everything turned out fine.  Baked them in 9X13 pans (high sided) and kept the dough kind of close together so they had a nice shape with soft sides.  Taste *just* like my grandmother's rolls, and I'm thousands of miles away from my family so I'll be making these often!  (I didn't use the egg wash - just brushed them with a little melted butter after they came out of the oven)

It was soft and came out great.  Also very easy to make.  I did not give 5 stars because it was little too salty for my family!  I think I will cut the salt in half...  Pretty good though!

My family absolutely LOVES these tender dinner rolls. They fill the house with an amazing aroma while they bake, so don't cook them too far ahead of the meal, or you may find they "go missing".
At holiday meals, when I want to create some dining room drama, I only bring one batch. Everyone fights to get the last one!
The only adjustment I have is on timing. My breadmaker takes 1 1/2hrs for dough, so my total time to make these is more like, 2hrs, 20min.

This is so simple to make and so good. I no longer buy bread for sandwiches.  I make several baggies of dry ingredients in advance; then add wet ingredients in the bread machine.  Dividing into 12 rolls makes dinner; into 8 Hoagie-sizes makes great sandwiches.

I've made this recipe several times for special occasions and the family loves it.  I get requests for these rolls at holidays and gatherings!  They're easy to make.  They're even better the next day for making sandwiches with the leftovers.

I have been looking for a great pasta dish like I would order at a restaurant.  This recipe is WAY BETTER than anything I've had at a restaurant!!  I made it for the first time for company and doubled it and it was a hit, the recipe is large as it is, and would have easily fed atleast 3 people.

I skipped the egg white, but just after baking I brushed them with butter mixed with parsley, garlic and parmesan.  These were better than going out for italian.

I made this recipe this weekend and it turned out great. The rolls tasted just like my Mom's (that she make's by hand.) I took someone else's idea and did not do the egg wash but brushed with butter when i took them out of the oven.. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent rolls, the best I've made yet using the bread machine.  They take a long time, but the fact that I don't have to put in any elbow grease makes it worth it.  I'm off to make some more, so my husband and I have rolls for sandwiches this week while at work.  Thanks Kay!!

The absolutely best white roll recipie. Makes yummy rolls and try making em a little bigger for sandwiches or substitute 
1/2 bread flour for whole wheat flour and this makes a hearty whole wheat dinner roll.

These were AWESOME! Followed the recipe exactly and they were soft, and slightly sweet.  Perfect dinner roll, the family loves them!  I have also used all-purpose flour and it works just as well.  If you have trouble with them sticking to the wet towel, lightly spray them with Pam before placing the towel over them.  The egg wash really makes them look nice. Thanks!!

Great recipes. I have made it many times and my family loves it. I also use it to make breadstix. I roll the dough out flat, cut it into 1/2 inch strips. Twist the strips, fold in half allowing it to wrap around itself. Immediately after baking, I brush it with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt. Yummy.

Wonderful recipe all the way around. Super easy diretions. The most work you do is throw in the ingredients, wait, throw it on some flour, cut it up, wait. How much easier can you get than that? The flavor was just as wonderful. I forgot the egg wash and it was super anyway. Probably for the better because I like really soft bread. This recipe is definately a keeper. THANK YOU!

I really liked these buns, mine usually turn out like hard little rocks that everyone politely eats, but these were terrific .Nice and big and fluffy, I will be making these ones a lot. Thanks for a great recipe!

Family loved these, I thought they were just OK considering the effort to make them. They were more dense and sweeter than I imagined they would be. But the dough was easy enough to work with and everyone raved over them. Might try again and diminish or leave out the sugar. Also took quite a bit longer.....dough setting on my bread machine is 1 hour 30 minutes alone, plus rising time (I let them rise about an hour) and baking. Thankfully I didn't go by the time listed in the recipe...just thought I would mention it though.

This was a wonderful recipe . My machine must vary on its rise time from  Kays ,because my total time on these rolls was 2hrs and 20 minutes ! My machine takes 1 hour and 30 minutes on dough plus the forty minutes to rise under the cloth & then the 15 minutes to bake. Dinner was a little late .

These rolls are wonderful! They are so easy to throw into the bread machine, and then letting them rise and baking them gives them a home-made goodness. They make great sandwiches too. I highly recommend them!

This is a great go to recipe for rolls.  Love that you can make them in the bread machine.  I often make them in the morning and put them in the pan and cover with plastic wrap in the fridge for the second rise and cook them at dinner time. They come out great.  I also rarely brush them with egg white and they are still great.  Good basic recipe.

These rolls are great. I served them as dinner rolls but they would make great hamburger or sandwich buns as well.  I made only a few changes.  I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons and included the 1 egg white in with the wet ingredients. I also used All Purpose Flour because that was what I had on hand.  I brushed the rolls with melted butter both before and right after baking.  This ensures a beautiful brown color and also keeps them soft.  I sprinkled them lightly with poppy seeds as well after the butter brush and before baking.  You could also use sesame seeds, etc.  I always put my dough ingredients into the bread machine in the order of wet at the bottom, then all dry ingredients, then yeast on top.  Have never been disappointed using that order for dough.  It did take my rolls a little longer than 40 minutes, more like an hour to double after coming out of the bread machine.  I made 18 smaller rolls which were perfect for dinner.  12 would be a good size for a large sandwich. Thank you for sharing.

have to have the right ingredients to get perfect rolls.  they do turn out nice if you have exactly the right ingredients.  whole wheat dough doesn't turn out so well.

Great recipe but it took a lot longer in my bread machine for the dough setting. Worth the wait though. :) next time I might try dividing it into about 14 rolls and bake about 10 min. Some of the rolls were pretty big.

Another poster said that this is a fool proof recipe--I agree! So, before I read all of the directions, I accidentally added both of the egg white and the water that was suppose to be used to brush the tops of the rolls into the other wet ingredients. I added about one extra cup of flour while the bread machine was going and the rolls turned out well anyway! I added some butter, rosemary, and cheese to the top before baking them. They were a hit for our thanksgiving dinner!

I tried this recipe the other night when dh had a co worker over for supper.  They turned out really good.  The co worker ate 4 of them! I did as others said and made 18 rolls and the size was perfect. I put them in the over to rise and checked on them after about 45 minutes. They had not risen at all. So, I turned the over on 150 when it reached that temp I turned it off. I checked them in about 20 minutes and it worked! I also put melted butter over them before I baked.

Very easy and delicious. I have made these rolls several times and they have been devoured by my family & friends. Two changes: 1) I use 5T of sugar instead of 3T. (I like a sweeter tasting roll), 2) Instead of brushing with egg white, I brush with an olive oil/garlic powder mixture. Taste like garlic bread rolls. Lastly, I am no longer buying store bought rolls b/c these are so easy to make and taste a lot better. As a result, my family is enjoying fresher ingredients and I am saving money!

Accidentally put egg white in the mix (I was on the phone and not paying attention) and the rolls rose beautifully. I also added garlic and herb Mrs. Dash (about a tablespoon and a half) oh wow, they were the best rolls I ever made.

Soo disappointed ! I don't think it's the recipe though, think there is either something wrong with my machine or its operator . Followed directions and though it was set on dough it cooked the bread on the outside. Any help would be appreciated.

Great, easy recipe. I also decreased the sugar to 2 TBSP and added 1 TBSP of honey. Didn't do the egg wash but brushed with melted butter instead. Yum!

After reading the reviews I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp. I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to make garlic rolls. I shaped them into 18 balls, let them rise covered in the microwave, and baked them. They turned out wonderful. Next time I might use 2 tbsp sugar but I think 3 is definitely too much. I also topped them with a butter/garlic/herb spread before baking. (I also used 1 total cup milk/water because I didn't have milk powder)

Love it!  I use 2TBSP sugar for buns.  3 TBSP for sugar, and 4TBSP honey for sweet rolls!  Overall, this versatile recipe is a WINNER!!!

Good rolls, however I did add 2 eggs for better texture and 1 tbl spoon more milk.  Smells like a bakery in my house. I use all purpose flour but add 2 tbl spoons wheat gluten to make bread flour. Its cheap, easy to get on Amazon and you can use the cheapest AP flour in your store. My son loves the rolls.

Revision:  I've probably made these 100 times.  The first time I ever made them I accidentally added the egg white to the recipe instead of using it later and it works out great!  The best rolls, period.  These are really good for buns too if you can keep them thin enough.

These rolls were excellent even though my yeast was expired by over a year! The only thing I had to change was to use 1 1/4 cup 2 percent milk instead of the water and powdered milk because I didn't have any powdered milk. After my bread machine did its thing, I formed the dough into 6 sandwich rolls. It took them 60 minutes to rise again, but that was probably the fault of the expired yeast. When done, I coated them with butter instead of the egg wash. Delicious for pulled pork sandwiches!!! Thank you for the recipe!

They were easy, tasted great and I think they were even better the next day!!!
I used warmed up milk (1cup) instead of the 1/4c dry milk powder and water (since I didnt have dry milk powder handy)

I folded a pesto in the center of the rolls and rubbed a little olive oil on the surface once they finished cooking.

WOW.............If you let them proof 1 to 1/2 hours, they are the most superb HB Buns. Light, fluffy, and no yeast taste. Next time I will make 16 instead of 12. They turned out too HUGE. Which is OK if you have a big appetite. These rolls are versatile. By different shaping they are easily adaptable for many different type of rolls. Thank you Kay for a great recipe.

Super yummy and super easy! I haven't bought rolls from the store since I found this recipe. I spray my non-stick baking sheet with a little butter flavoured spray before placing the dough to rise. It gives the rolls a nicely browned, buttery bottom.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it seemed that everything was going alright until I lifted the cloth from the top of the rolls when they were finished rising.  The cloth stuck! Down deflated my nice puffy rolls when I pulled the cloth off.  I am not sure of a way to keep the cloth from touching the rolls when using a cookie sheet.  Any suggestions?

These are awesome! I didn't have any dry milk powder so I used skim milk instead of water and they turned out great! I also didn't bother with the egg wash - they were still yummy and barely lasted one day in our house :)

I do cut the sugar back to only 2T and I do not do the egg wash either, as my boys prefer a softer crust!

Too sweet for a dinner roll.  Didn't turn out great.  Maybe I'll try again using my Bosch and letting dough rise instead of using bread machine.

I told my husband we were having dinner rolls the other night and he evidently assumed they would be the bland "brown & serve" ones from the supermarket.  I served these fresh from the oven with butter.  After just one bite he looked up and asked, "Where did you get these?"  I explained that I made them.  He's still talking about how delicious they were!  Two hands full of thumbs up!!!

Made these today for 8 not 12. Added parm, garlic and onion powders, italian seasoning and a sprinkle of pepper along with the salt. So far so good they are rising right now and I will put in the preheated oven and cook for 15 minutes then serve with Hearty Split Pea Soup also on this site that i cooked today in my CP

Extremely Easy. Made a loaf last night. My husband ate half of it before he went to bed. I plan on making it into rolls tonight for sandwiches tomorrow. At least with this bread I know whats going into it, unlike to store bought breads.

Very tasty if a tad sweet.  Following others recommendations, I made these into 7 large rolls.  They didn't double in size after an hour of raising, but did finish rising while baking.  Excellent consistency - light and fluffy.  I was asked which bakery I bought them from and my partner was very happy to hear they were so easy to make.  Next time I'll cut the sugar by half a tablespoon and make 8 or 9 rolls.

These were very good -- easy to make, and the recipe was very clear.  I followed it exactly.  With the honey butter recipe on this site, it was a nice Thanksgiving Day treat.

Wonderful! These are like the rolls my aunt makes, old style. I wanted a good recipe that I could throw into the bread machine. This is IT!  Love it.  It makes 12 large rolls. All were eaten day one. But easy enough to remake. My son made a turkey sandwich on one. Nice and large.

PERFECT.  I prepared as directed, except I didn't have any dry milk, so like another reviewer, I used 3/4 c. warm water and 1/4 c. milk.  I served these with SLOW COOKER ITALIAN MOOSE ROAST SANDWICHES (I'm in AK), and my whole family ate and loved them! I'm adding this recipe to my recipe box.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have powdered milk, so I used powdered creamer as someone had suggested to me...it worked out perfect.  I don't think I'll be purchasing store made rolls anymore since these were so easy and so much better.  I definitely recommend giving them a try!  Thanks Kay for the yummy rolls.

I didn't have milk powder and thus just replaced the water in the recipe with milk, and these came out fantastically! I added a little more yeast, as well (just a pinch) after reading some of the reviews, too. Absolutely great recipe.

A favorite in our house!  I make these often.  I don't keep powdered milk on hand, so like a previous person suggested, I decrease the water to 3/4 cup and use 1/4 cup of regular milk.  Delicious!

Amazing! I have made these rolls at least a dozen times in the last month.  They make the best hamburger,hotdog and hoagie buns. We have not purchased our own since! I do half bread flour half whole wheat. I have also used evaporated cane juice crystals in place of the sugar when we ran out of regular sugar with the same success.  The recipe is absolutely perfect as it is! When doing hamburger and hotdog buns I make about 9 even size buns.  Dinner rolls about 12. Sometimes I use the egg wash, sometimes I do not.  The egg wash does add a nice sheen and a wonderful smell but is not neccesary. I cannot say enough about these! So easy and oh so good!

I love this recipe, If I want to make cinnamon rolls, I take cinnamon sugar mixture and roll the balls in melted butter and then in the mixture first and then put into pan to let rise. Also very good in melted butter and then sprinkle with garlic salt for garlic rolls.

I was in desperate need of a hot dog bun for my daughter's lunch and there was no money for going to the store. I also needed something that I could have the bread machine mix since I was going to be gone most of the day. I stumbled across this recipe. It was so good. The texture was great. Not too dense and not too crumbly. Thanks so much for sharing!

Love this recipe. I made the rolls into hedgehogs with some kids who loved them. I will say that they are a little sweet to my taste, so will definately lessen the sugar next time, but other than that, they're great.

This is the best roll recipe I have ever tried. I made if for my in laws and now they want me to make them for all of our family functions. My sister has requested that I make them as a part of her birthday dinner and my husband absolutely loves them. I baked them in a muffin tin and they came out perfect. They are so good that I am making another batch tonight.

I first used this recipe about 5 years ago.  It is a great recipe.  The rolls are VERY light and tender.  I sprinkle 1/2 of them with sesame seeds and the other 1/2 with poppy seeds.

Yum!!!  I kept all measurements exactly as written, and made 18 smaller rolls.  They were delicious and my dinner guests were blown away.  Seems like such a simple recipe but the end result was out of this world!  I did spray the rolls with some Pam before placing the damp cloth over and had no problem with it sticking.

These rolls are soft, light and tasty! I use the measurements for sugar and salt per the recipe.  The only thing I change is skipping the egg wash and brushing them with melted butter/parmesan mixture when they are done. I, too, have had times when the dough sticks to my cloth.  I found that I don't have this problem if I make sure the water is at 110 degrees (using a thermometer), only slightly dampen the cloth by sprinkling a little cold water on it and make sure that they don't get too warm during the final rise.  I usually put in a cold oven to rise and it works fine.  These are now my "famous rolls" and I get many special requests to make them :)

These rolls are wonderful, and so simple to make - even for me, a non-baker.  I divided the recipe in half and cut the dough into fourths so I could make sandwich rolls.  Because I wanted sandwich rolls I didn't use the egg wash, but they turned out great just the same.

Just delicious. Frankly I eat them like brioche. Hubby prefers them when to make sandwiches. I forgot to add oil in the dough and it was still delicious so I'm gonna keep it fat free from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought these rolls were very good... maybe a little on the sweet side but I will adjust that next time by adding less sugar.  The texture on these rolls is amazing!!  You would never know these were made in a bread machine.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I cannot review this because I have to be doing SOMETHING wrong....  I have made these twice now, and each time they turn out like cornbread, not rolls.  It must be me, and they sound great.

Good rolls, but not quite as soft and fluffy as I wanted.  I'll keep looking for another recipe, but don't get me wrong...I'll keep using this one in the meantime.

I was expecting a totally different kind of roll when I made these, but they were so good I didn't care. These are so soft on the inside and golden on the outside. The results turn out just like the picture! I did have to let them rise for a longer period of time than the recipe called for. I will make these again!

Soooooo good!  Everyone who has tried these has loved them!  Easy to make and taste great!  I would highly recommend this recipe!!  (We usually don't have any left over, but when we do, I put them in the refrigerator and pop them in the microwave to eat them left over, and they're still delicious!)

I hate to be the sole voice of dissention, but I'm still searching for a really good bread machine recipe for dinner rolls.  I followed the recipe exactly and was completely unimpressed.  They were OK, but nothing special.  Considering the many 5 star reviews, I thought I was in for a treat but was very disappointed instead.  I ended up throwing out most of them.  I'll be generous and give it 3 stars even though it's doubtful I'll ever make these again.

Very easy to make, and turned out so well they got munched inside 15 minutes! I'll be scaling up this recipe and using again! Dividing into 12 gives an excellent size roll to accompany soup, and the dough was easy to work with. The rolls have a really light texture, and are only slightly sweet... great with fresh butter! Thanks Kay!

This rolls are SO good!  I've made them two days in a row and am looking forward to having them for dinner again tonight!  They taste just like the rolls from O'Charley's.  Thanks so much Kay!

Tasty but they were heavy-- I didn't have any milk powder so following another reviewer's suggestion, I substituted milk. However, I ended up pouring the dough out of the pan! :(  Next time will have to decrease the water or add more flour... or just add milk powder to my grocery list! :)

I was very impressed with this recipe.  Had a wonderful flavor, very light & fluffy.  The only thing I did different was instead of the egg wash, I mixed a little butter & garlic and brushed the tops after they were done.  Delicious, served them with Clam Chowder, was a big hit with everyone.  Will definitely be making these again!  Thanks Kay!

Not bad....although my memories of my mom's yeast rolls beat these out.  Consistency was a little chewy and hard to form into a round shape.  They smelled great while baking, though!

These were so good!  And especially easy, since our bread machine does the yeast rising step for dough for us.

Kay... We loved these rolls! I had been looking for a good hamburger roll. The only thing I did different was let them rise for  1 1/2 hours. They were just the right size and tasted great.

I have been looking for a roll like this for a long time.  I don't care for the sweeter rolls and as far as I'm concerned, this IS the "ultimate" roll recipe!  This opinion is shared by my married children.  We all love them!

These are a really easy and wonderfully textured roll.  I was really expecting a sweeter roll, but I don't have any complaints with the way they turned out.  The flavor is just a really nice fresh bread taste.  I will make these again, but am still on the look out for the "ultimate" roll recipe.

These rolls were absolutely delicious, even the day after I made them.  My 8 year-old and my 18 month-old both loved these rolls.  I have never been able to get yeast rolls to turn out the traditional way, but these turned out great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.-----------Sandy

This recipe wasn't all that great as compared to the reviews.  I've been making yeast breads for quite some time with bread machine and by hand and have made much better recipes.  These just don't measure up.  They were ok for flavor, but not particularly light. Certainly did not allow for the time it took from start to finished product - nearly 3 hours. My family said not to make these again - not worth the effort.

What could be easier! Just dump in the ingredients, shape, rise and bake! This is the first time I've tried rolls in the bread machine and I'll never make them any other way (or buy them from the bakery either!) Everyone at my Easter dinner loved them.  We'll be making them often.

These are absolutely delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers - used 1/2c milk and 1/c water because I didn't have dry milk on hand. I also used all-purpose flour since I didn't have bread flour. I did a straight egg wash including the yolk. They turned out perfect!

My family loved these rolls!  I would add a picture, but they were eaten so fast, I didn't have a chance to take a picture.  I will definitely be making them again.  They were easy and delicious.  Next time, I might make smaller rolls.  By cutting these into 12 equal pieces, they were still pretty big rolls.
*update* I now make these into 16 pieces.  The rolls are a little smaller but still eaten just as quickly!

The only change I made is to replace 1 cup of the bread flour with white whole wheat flour and add 1 teaspoon of Vital Wheat Gluten.  This is something that I do with every bread recipe to increase the fiber without changing the taste.  On my bread machine, I used the 1 pound setting and that was perfect.  I really like these rolls.  They're soft and buttery.  I put all the leftover rolls into a zipper bag and froze them.  Today I took out 2 for dinner and let them thaw on the counter.  Delicious!

I took the advice from another poster and used warm milk instead of water and milk powder, but I used almond milk and earth balance for the butter to make this dairy free. I also used 1/2 a tbsp less of sugar than the recipe called for. It rose for an hour in the bread machine and 30 mins outside of it after I punched it down. Best rolls I’ve ever had!

These were absolutely delicious! I added the egg white to the dough by mistake (Oops) but they ended up delicious! I snapped the top crisscross with scissors before  heading to the oven.  I baked them for 15 minutes and they are golden brown, perfectly done on the outside with a lovely center. Thank you!

These rolls were my first attempt at dinner rolls to go with beef  stew.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  I didn't have any dry milk, so I followed the suggestion of someone else and used warmed milk in place of the water. I pushed the dough flat on a floured surface and used a glass to make rounds.  I let them rise for 15 minutes and popped them into the oven.  Excellent!

i have made these rolls every week since i first tried them. first time they didnt rise well but they still tasted great so i didnt give up. i new i had to do something wrong. I found out by doing some research what the problem was "cold kitchen" not good for rising dough, i corrected the problem because we love these rolls. they are great as is or as sandwhich buns.

I made them and they tasted really good. I did change it some and added garlic, onion and oregano. I will CAUTION anyone that makes bread. Watch how you use your yeast. I went against my better judgement to let the yeast bubble and well they weren't like a roll. My family always busts on me for my lackluster baking skills. They still liked the taste just. Not the look. Cheers!

I liked the ease of making these. 5 minutes hands on in the beginning and about 10 at the end of the dough cycle. They came out beautifully golden and fluffy inside. But they were too sweet for dinner rolls. Also, they were too big, almost  like a burger bun.  I will use less sugar next time and divide the dough into 18 rolls.

i tried this today and it was completely dry and crumbly. i added an extra cup of water or more and remixed it to try salvaging it. sort of recovered,  but was overworked and ended up with the texture of bad whole wheat rolls. i will be adding significantly more liquid if I make it again

Awesome and quick. Only things I did differently were adding 1 cup milk (instead of the dry powder and water), and I threw in an egg. Didn't bother with the egg wash at the end. Delicious and beautiful!

Very good and very easy.  The rolls were firm on the outside and soft on the inside.   Everyone liked them and I will make them again.  I made a couple of changes but nothing that changes the integrity of the recipe.  To make it healthier  I swapped oil for the butter. (butter would taste better) I used 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup milk instead of the dry milk because I didn't have any dry milk.  And because I didn't want to separate out the egg white,  I did not use the egg wash at the end I just baked the rolls plain (again the egg would only make the rolls better)

I followed the recipe, except with one exception. I made the dough the night before, and left the uncooked rolls, covered in plastic wrap, on baking sheets in the fridge. I baked them today for Christmas dinner and everyone was happy with them.  I will  definitely make them again.

2016:   These rolls are delicious, actually perfect.  My family loved them.  I made them according to the recipe.  I used a pizza cutter to cut into 12 pieces as someone suggested.  I will make this recipe again and again.

          July, 2019  Another perfect bunch of rolls. I used 1 cup white wheat flour with 2 cups of bread flour. Added 1/4 cup flax. Made these slightly larger for BBQ chicken rolls. Baked 20 min. So good.

I made these rolls exactly as the recipe called for. They were great for dinner the first night. I did find though,  even when heated,  that they were quite dry the next day.  They were stored in an air tight container over night.

These were super simple and delicious!  Very doughy and yummy!  I  made 3 changes: I didn't have powdered milk on hand, so I just substituted 1 cup of warm milk instead of warm water, and also after reading the reviews saying it was too sweet, I cut down the sugar to 2 tablespoons instead of 3.  Also, as some of the other reviewers, I skipped the eggwash step, and the crust was perfect still.  These were a hit with all 6 of my family members.  We had NO leftovers!

These were really good and pretty easy to make. Made few changes... 1 cup warm water with 1T sugar and the yeast and let sit for 10 mins to foam. Then added all dry ingredient first into bread machine followed by liquids. I didn't have powdered milk so just subbed 1/4c skim milk for that. I also subbed the white sugar with brown sugar and added an extra 1T. After dough was done in the machine I made 12 biscuits and then let them rise again for about another hour. Baked for 15 mins. I didn't do the egg wash because I was out but I think it would've made the biscuit a nicer brown color rather than the pale white it was. These were light, fluffy and delicious. Thanks!

This is now my "go to" roll recipe for family dinners. I've made them over and over and they get eaten quickly! I also leave out the egg wash step to make it easier. We enjoy them with butter and honey from our own honey bees. Yum!!!

This was my first time forming rolls (besides the crescent rolls from the can).  I was nervous, but it turned out well.  I got drunk off the smell when they came out of the oven!  :-)  I'll be making Salisbury steak from scratch tonight, and these rolls will be wonderful for dipping in the gravy!  And in a couple evenings a good friend and I have some things that we need to do, so rather than starving and eating  when we get home, I'm going to make more of these rolls and bring along stuff for sandwiches -- should make for a yummy quick meal!

I used this dough, then rolled it out. Sprinkled shredded cheeses and fresh oregano, then rolled up and cut into buns (cinnamon bun style). Turned out so delicious! I lessened the sugar a little bit when I made the cheese buns.

Makes 18 perfect rolls!  This is my go-to recipe. I have used milk instead of the powdered milk when I was out, I’ve used all purpose flour when out of bread flour, made with and without the egg wash (brushed butter on after baking) and I’ve made them exactly as written.  They have came out great every time!

I really love these. I had never used the dough function on my bread machine bcuz I was gone when it was recieved and person who unpakd it disposed of instructions. I made these because I needed sandwich buns. I divided into 8 parts, baked 15 min, then returned for another 5 for total 20-done at 15 but I wanted them a little firmer and browner for my purpose.  Nice soft crust on outside and soft and airey inside. *see note below. Delicious. I used almost 1 c milk, and rest (to mke 1 1/4) was water. As sandwich buns they are tasty and I will use them again, but they are very soft so if you are making heavy duty sandwichs, better use something else. Light for hamburgers, but if u aren't adding a ton of extra "dressings", they will be fine.  *NOTE: MY MACHINE RISES TWICE ON DOUGH FUNCTION-since it beeped before the second kned and rise, maybe I was supposed to take it out then.  I left it in there almost halfway through the second rise-since i don't have the handbook and recipe duznt say, I didn't know if I was supposed to take it out or not. Then I took dough out, broke into 8 pieces (buns) carefully shaped and put on large baking sheet to raise again for about an hour before baking. I don't know if this was right or wrong, or affected the outcome, but they were really good.  Next time, when I make them for rolls, I will probably do the same again.  Apparently, you can't mess these up.-- if anyone knows what the "right thing to do" was, let me know. Also, I proofed the yeast.

These were pretty yummy & hubby was pleased I surprised him with a batch of homemade rolls for Sunday dinner.  Added sesame seeds on top over the egg wash which added a nice taste & touch.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

These are delicious rolls with simple ingredients.  You can taste the sweetness in them and I've made them with the recommended amount of sugar and also have decreased it to 2TBS depending on my mood. I also let my rolls rise longer... I tend to eyeball the rolls to determine when it is time to bake so I did not experience some of the other reviewers' comments on density. This recipe is in my recipe box!

These were the best rolls that I've ever made and they looked like they came from the bakery! Instead of using powdered milk, I used 1/4 cup of buttermilk and added about 2 tablespoons of extra flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  When I let the rolls rise, I covered my pan with saran wrap and placed them in an UN HEATED oven with a bowl of warm water on the rack below them.  They turned out excellent! Although you do not need to brush the rolls with the egg mixture, it gives it a a shiny coating, just like the better bakeries, so I recommend that you take the extra 2 min. and use the egg wash on the rolls!  Great recipe.

simple and elegant... no fuss or frills. i like the idea of proofing the yeast. 1 min warm water in microwave, dissolve the sugar. add and dissolve the yeast. for a bread machine i adjusted to 15 servings to get a proper loaf

I made this today and thought my bread machine had messed up because the dough was dense and not as soft as I thought it should be.  I almost threw it out.  I let it rise anyway and baked them after using the egg wash and sesame seeds.  They turned out wonderful!  I think you can't mess this recipe up.

Excellent. My boyfriend raved about them during the entire meal. I made 6 large sandwich rolls and skipped the egg wash. Will definitely keep this one.

I followed the recipe, exactly and they turned up really good. I spent the day trying out different roll recipes and this was the second recipe i tried...wish i would've tried this one first cause then my day of baking would've just been that batch.  This is definitely a keeper.

I've tried this several times now, and the best way I've had them is to sub in a half cup of whole wheat flour for a half cup of bread flour. The rolls are scrumptious dipped in garlic butter. Oh, and I don't brush them with the egg wash, I just brush them with melted butter when they come out of the oven, makes them nice and soft on the outside.

I've made these twice.  The texture and taste were good.  But they weref not as high as in the picture.  I am thinking that I did not add enough flour.  The second time I made them they did not come out at all.  I think it was because I doubled the recipe.  I am just starting to bake my own bread so I am sure that it is something I did.  I will try these again.

Followed the recipe exactly for making the dough. To shape the rolls, I divided the dough into 12 balls and then split each ball and rolled the 2 halves into balls. I put the balls into the cups of a greased muffin pan, 2 balls in each section. I let them rise about 50 minutes. I didn't use a damp cloth to cover them for fear of sticking. I covered the rolls with greased waxed paper and still had one stick a little, but it didn't deflate. Followed the baking directions in the recipe. The end result was delicious, professional looking dinner rolls. I'll definitely be making these again soon!

This are the easiest and most delicious rolls ever. I rolled into 12 rolls and baked in a 9x13 cake pan. Eliminated the egg wash. Rolls came out beautiful, light and fluffy. Since there are just two of us at home they lasted through the week and let me tell you, they were just as delicious on Thursday as they were on Sunday.

These rolls are wonderful. I made 6 large rolls like a hamburger bun. I used 1/2  cup 2% milk and 1/2 cuo water instead of powdered milk because I didn't have any. We made delicious ham sandwiches and the rolls were perfect. I would also like to say how easy these were to prepare. Will be making again. Thank you for your great recipe.

These came out great. I did a dairy/soy free version substituting rice milk for the water and milk powder, and canola oil for the butter. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat + 1/2 cup rye flours with the remainder plain white.

I'm not a fan of white bread, but my guys liked these.  I split the dough in half and made 6 rolls out of one half and 4 larger rolls out of the other half.  The 4 will be used for sandwiches in tomorrow's lunch.

my rolls turned out to be cocktail rolls.
Not sure what i did wrong. I only wanted to make 6 so I halved the recipe. I used about 1 tsp of yeast. Was that too little?

These were great! I used them as buns for pulled pork sandwiches (w/ Sarge's pulled pork and Mom's Coleslaw from this site which were both fabulous) and as hamburger buns. Will definitely make again and again!

I have made these rolls dozens of times are they are beyond delicious!  I use 2 1/4 teaspoons of bread machine yeast (from a jar) instead of the yeast packet.  For the egg wash, I use a whole egg thinned with water.

This is a GREAT stand alone recipe. The most versatile bread recipe I have found. I only made one change, but only because of the elevation where I live.....I added just a bit more water to the recipe.

It was great! When i go grocery shopping it's hard for me to find decent sandwich buns...either they are too hard or too doughy or they come in jumbo family pack value, or you only get 6 small ones in a package....but with this recipe it is just perfect. It makes 6 or 8 good sized buns and my fiance LOVES them too. I might changed it up every now and then like use whole wheat flour, or press some sesame seeds onto the tops of them, or add flaxseed, or what have you...but as is; it is great, thanx for the good recipe.

Grr....followed the directions to a tee.  DO NOT COVER WITH A CLOTH for the second rise.  The dough gets all stuck to the cloth, and the rolls fall when the cloth gets peeled off.  Haven't tasted them yet, but they look horrible!  Next time i'll use greased plastic wrap like I usually do.

I added 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano and divided the dough into 7 rolls and used them for hamburger buns. They were a big hit.

These were really good as hamburger buns, but they would have been great just to eat with butter too! I did as some of the suggestions said and measured my flour out by spooning it into the measuring cup and leveling it off. They were fab!

Holy moly these were good.  And so very easy and just about goof proof.  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't do the egg wash at the end.  No need...they were the perfect accompaniment to Allrecipe contributor Brandy's Slow Cooker Barbeque. I will be making these rolls quite often.  Better than the store bought, that's for sure.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Great rolls! The recipe was easy and the texture of the rolls was perfect. I did let them rise for 1 hour as was suggested by some reviewers.Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made these a few times.  Since I don't keep dry milk powder in the house, I use half water and half milk.  I also sometimes replace one cup with whole wheat flour.  I've used these for hamburger buns, sandwiches and dinner rolls.  So far, they've always come out great.

Easy to makes, and delicious straight out of the oven.  For an italian meal, I've thrown in dried rosemary, thyme, sage (all together and/or separately) along withgarlic and onion powder for what we jokingly refer to as 'Simon & Garfunkle' rolls... they are delicious!

These are to die for! They didn't quite double in size in the allotted time, but I put them in the oven anyway. They are light, flaky and downright yummy.   The one change I made was to brush melted butter on top before baking instead of eggwash. It made them extra buttery and flaky on top.

These rolls were really good.  Next time I would probably make more than 12 from the dough so that they are smaller.  These were pretty big. My carb-aholic husband liked them.  Since homemade bread doesn't keep that long, I froze the leftover 1's in a freezer bag.

These turned out great!  Great flavor and texture.  I made some large for hamburger buns and they're perfect!  Who ever had trouble using them as buns must not have let them rise enough or something.  They are also delicious just plain, they leave your mouth wanting more!  Update: they do not store well though.  Even in a ziplock bag with all the air pressed out, they were already starting to get stale the next morning.

My rolls came out looking exactly like the picture.  I made six large rolls instead of 12 smaller ones and I am using them for sandwiches.  They are very soft.  Very yummy.  I will definately be making these again.  Thanks!

This recipe is very similiar to the one that came with my very first bread machine years ago. I have found that I switch the butter with the Crocks brand honey butter and after dividing the dough into 12 rolls let rise 30 min and then roll into teardrop shape and roll. It then looks like a crescent roll. Let rise another 50 min and bake. The sweetness of the butter reminds me of the yeast rolls you get at restaurants. I use this for my family every Thanksgiving and Christmas. They love them.

This was a good basic recipe, but I agree with another reviewer that it might be too dense for a hamburger bun.  Overall it tastes like a simple white dinner roll.

I made these to bring to a Christmas luncheon and I have never made anything that got such rave reviews!  Everyone loved these and many asked for the recipe.  I scaled it to serve 20 and made smaller rolls (about 30) but letting them rise extra long allowed them to puff up beautifully.  I also omitted the egg wash and rubbed with melted butter.  Delish!!

This recipe was easy as can be, and got rave reviews from my co-workers at our holiday party. I didn't use the egg white glaze, nor did I add butter. Just as delicious the second day, and no need to re-heat.

I really love this recipe and so does everyone that ever eats it.  I am still perfecting it as I am a new cook.  I have trouble shaping them.  Thanks to other cooks for the advice to spoon the flower in and also not to roll it out.  I will try that.
Overall though you can't really mess it up.  When you eat it you just want to get it right so it will be even better.

This recipe worked well for me; it was easy and the rolls tasted pretty good. However, it seems to be lacking something; there's nothing really special about this recipe, so I'll probably keep looking for a dinner roll recipe.

These are very easy, plain rolls.  They were incredibly sticky to work with, so if I make again I'll add a bit more flour.  They rose pretty well and made decent buns, but I have other recipes I prefer.  Bf was happy since I made basic white bread (I don't do that often!).  Thanks.  With a few tweaks--adding some more flour and maybe garlic or onion flavoring--these would be wonderful.

These were easy to make and taste very good.  I also used skim milk instead of water and dry milk.  They turned out very well!

I made these, froze them then baked them up. They turned out ok. A little tough. Next time I will avoid the freezing. I'm thinking if I pop them into the oven right away I'll get that fluffy goodness. Thanks

They were great hamburger buns. I just split it into 8 so they would be a tad bigger. Next time I am going to turn them into onion rolls.

What a great yeast roll recipe! I made these tonight and they were completely gobbled up... even after a few mishaps in the kitchen. I didn't have time to measure out the flour by the spoonful and when the dough was mixing I thought it looked a little heavy so I added 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of water during the mixing cycle. I used a little more yeast than what the recipe called for and when it was rising it began to overflow out of the bread pan in the machine so I went ahead and took it out abut 15 minutes before it was finished. I made 1 and 1/2 recipes and got 24 decent size rolls. I accidently hit one of the pans of rolls against the side of the oven and they fell and because of the lack of time I only let them re-rise for about 15 minutes and the group said they liked them even better a little heavy. Needlesstosay, I will be making this recipe again and with all my mistakes it seems pretty fool proof!

Oh My Gosh!! These are so good it's a miracle any of them make it to the table before I gobble them all down myself! They're even good the next day, I took some to my sister with the Quick Chicken Soup from this site when she was sick and she LOVED the soup and rolls! I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased with the results!

The rolls came out denser than I hoped they would be.  They were also pretty sweet, I'd definitely cut the sugar in 1/2.

This recipe is greattttt.  I made it for the first time last night.  The few times that I have used bread flour for bread, the result is VERY heavy.  So I used all purpose flour.  I did spoon the flour into to a measuring cup as was suggested.  My bread machine book says that a small package of yeast (.25 oz) is 1 tablespoon, so that is what I used.  This time I did not use the egg wash but I most likely will try it in the future.  My machine is working on another batch as I want to try freezing some as was suggested.  By the way, my picky son inhaled these rolls and requested that I make another batch for tonight.  According to him, they are better than store bought.

Wow! I am stuffing my mouth as I speak err...type! I have been cooking and baking ever since I was big enough to hold a pan and I have NEVER been able to successfully bake homemade rolls until tonight! These are delicious! My family has forgotten about the rest of our meal and stuffed themselves with rolls! Great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!!! The rolls turn out so soft and so fluffy! I did not change a thing with this recipe. The best way to eat them is straight out of the oven with a load of melted butter and some vegemite! DELICIOUS!!

These are great and I didn't change a thing.  I am certain that I am the world's worst baker. My mother(I'm sure she was one of the best bakers)she was manager in a big bakery for many years. Unfortunately none of her talents rubbed off on me. I have tried many times to bake different things and nothing has turned out. This time it turned out just perfect. I was so proud that I even took some over to a neighbor.  Have to wait for her verdict later :-) I would like to say that if I can do these, then anyone can.  I served these with the "Sloppy Joes 11' recipe also from this site,and a coleslaw. It was very good. For the dessert I used the "chocolate cobbler" from here also.  It was all very good.
Thank you for a great recipe.

I made 2 things in my bread machine this weekend and these were the winner!!  So good and so easy.  I did them exactly like the recipe except for the egg wash (didn't want to waste one) and they browned and turned out lovely.  Doughy and good and will be making these again.  Thank you for sharing an easy and good recipe.

My attempt at these buns would have come out better if I had read the note about NOT scooping the flour straight from the flour sack. It said this might turn out too dense or hard. My batch although delicious did not raise well and was somewhat dense, but will definately give it another try, was very easy, Thanks, Sandra

These turned out excellent !
Im new to using a bread machine and have had mixed success with bread recipes but these rolls redeemed me to my family for all the hard doughy bread they have endured !
This was my first attempt ever at dinner rolls and with butter and honey there is not one bun left !

My family devoured these rolls - no leftovers! I didn't have any dry milk powder so I substituted with 1 cup of milk warmed to the temperature indicated in the recipe. The directions were simple and easy to follow. This is a keeper - thanks!

I use this recipe over and over again.  I make dinner rolls and sandwich bread with an egg wash that my husband loves. I also use half wheat flour and make bread in a bread pan with a butter wash.  

This recipe makes me glad all over again that I kept my bread machine (and bought a second one!)

I made these for thanksgiving and there were none left at the end of dinner.  I'm going to have to make another batch for the leftover turkey...../sigh.  It was a wonderful recipe and easy to make.

I was honestly kind of disappointed with these after reading so many good reviews. They were OK, not specatacular though. A word of caution...don't let the dough overrise, or you'll end up with collapsed hockey pucks.

I MAKE THESE FOR HAMBURGERS AND ANY SANDWICHES THAT MY HUSBAND TAKES IN HIS LUNCH.  THEY RAISE NICE AND HAVE A GREAT TASTE. I DONT BUY BUNS ANYMORE. MY GRANDSONS ALWAYS ASK IF I HAVE ANY MADE WHEN THEY COME OVER.

These are easy to make and taste wonderful...Thanks for the recipe.  I did add 1-tsp Italian Seasoning and I also eliminated the salt and added 1-tbsp grated Parmesan Cheese.  I also allowed them to rise twice as long as noted in the recipe.  The result was lighter, softer rolls.

Super yummy! We try to eat mostly whole grain bread, but I decided to make these for  a turkey dinner, and they were so good! I sprinkled them with sesame seeds before baking. I was rushed and got a late start, so I didn't have much time to let them rise the second time and they were still great.

I made these today a cold and drizzely day with my 2 older sons (19 months and 3).  These were so easy!  The kids loved forming their own rolls (8 slightly larger ones) and eating them for lunch! I would love to try these with wholemeal flour (we don't normally eat white bread).  I loved the texture, only added 1 tb of sugar, next time won't bother at all and simlpy added milk to create a glaze prior to cooking.  Thanks for the recipe a real hit and kept the boys amused for a short while and then had silence while the ate, definetley worth 5 stars!!

These rolls were very good once I got them done.  I had to cook them for 15 minutes beyond what the reciped called for in order to get them done.  They had good texture and flavor though.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  These were the first rolls I've ever made and they turned out great.  I took them to my inlaws for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I got tons of compliments and they even requested that I bring them to other family events.  There were only a few leftovers and the kids used them for sandwiches and said they were great.  Thanks!!

The dough was easy to work with and the finished rolls do look just like the picture. I thought they were one of the best roll recipes I had tried, but no one at Thanksgiving even mentioned them, and there were a lot left over.  I did add 4 teaspoons of gluten to my dough and I loved the end texture.  I will probably make these again when I am having a smaller dinner where the rolls stand out.  Maybe my family is just not that interested in the rolls LOL.

These rolls were delicious! Very easy to make. I've never tried making dough in my bread machine and then baking rolls. They were delicious reheated in the microwave the next day, too. We froze some of them, using the brown and serve instructions left by another reviewer and we haven't tried those yet. I'll be making these rolls a lot. 

I wish the recipe gave a teaspoon or tablespoon measurement for the yeast,though, because although I used a packet this time,now I have yeast in a jar and I want to be sure I get it right next time I make these rolls. 

I plan to add sesame seeds the next time I make them.

I can't believe this was so easy.  My husband raved!  They tasted just like the ones my mother makes by hand--will probably be a staple in our home.  I followed the bread recipe exactly and rubbed butter on the tops when they came out of the oven.

These were ok. The dough turned out a little tough which led to a heavy texture.

easy, fast & turned out perfectly.  I topped with Sesame Seeds, as was suggested earlier & it definitely made it look nice.  Very moist & soft.

These rolls were so good and so easy! My 2 year old was sneaking them off the baking sheet. The only thing I did differently was use honey butter because I had run out of regular butter. It gave it a little sweetness which was great. I will make these all the time now. Thanks for making me dust off the bread machine.

My 5 and 3 yr old are bread eaters! So you know I have tried every recipe out there and this is their favorite!!  These rolls turn out great everytime and we make them weekly, and they are gone as dinner is done!
Even my picky yankee mother-in-law loved them!  Thanks so much!

I was looking for a hamburger bun recipe and decided to try this.  Not only were the buns delicious for hamburgers, but my family ate all that were left--without any meat or anything!  I had to "steal" one so I could have it for the next day's left over hamburger.  Wonderful tasting buns!

My Dad used to make his own yeast rolls.  Even he thought these were really good.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and the rolls turn out light and fluffy.

These were so big and light.  They were just as good as the rolls I used buy at our neighborhood bakery, but so easy to make that I'll never buy rolls again!

I used this receipe for Bierock's I was making, it turned out real well.  I will try as dinner rolls too.  Very simple to make, and nice flavor.

I was a little disappointed when I tasted these rolls.  They were easy enough to make but I think I'll keep looking for a good dinner roll recipe.

Couldn't be any easier!  Just dump in the bread machine and let it do it's job.  Bakes quickly.  These rolls have a wonderful texture.  Thanks a bunch for a really neat and easy dinner/sandwich roll.

These were really easy and REALLY good! I only baked for 10 mins. Nice flavor, nice texture.  My family loved them.  I will be using this recipe again and again!
