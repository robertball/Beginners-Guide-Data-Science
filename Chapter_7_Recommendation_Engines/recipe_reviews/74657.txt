Moist, delicious and YUMMY!  I've made without altering and it is delicious but ofcourse I always take it to another level which is even YUMMIER!  I used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2, 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar and added a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I also make a  crumb topping( 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 stick softened butter-mix altogether with hand) and sprinkle all over the top of the loaves before baking.  Now- that is one heck of a good loaf of blueberry zucchini bread!  Will not leave my recipe box!

This was wonderful!  I did make changes:  half white/half whole wheat flour, used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and less sugar.  I also made a crumb topping with equal parts flour, sugar and oatmeal mixed with cinnamon and enough smart balance spread to make it crumbly.  This was to die for, really, I couldn't stay away!  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful recipe and an ingenous way to use up the mountains of zucchini that come out of summer gardens! Increased the zucchini to 2.5 cups and ensured that I squeezed the water out of the zucchini by lightly salting it and letting it "weep" for 20 minutes or so.  I changed the flour ingredient to: 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil vs 1 cup of oil for a healthier recipe.  On a side note;  to prevent your blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the pan, coat them in flour before adding.  This will help them bind to the batter.  Enjoy!

I made this twice.  The first time it was terrible!  I made a half recipe for a standard loaf but there wasn’t enough batter to fill the pan adequately, so I had to sub  with a smaller pan that just didn’t seem right to me.  As it baked it rose unevenly,  with a square, level top, not the nicely rounded top it should have.  After repeatedly checking it for doneness I finally gave up – I didn’t want to mess with it anymore.  As I turned it out of the pan directly into the garbage can rather than onto a cooling rack,  it somehow finally dawned on me that I forgot to include the zucchini in this Blueberry ZUCCHINI Bread!   So I tried it again.  It was just the right amount of batter for an 8x4” loaf pan.  As it baked it was fragrant and developed a nicely risen, rounded top.  It was moist, with a compact yet tender crumb, chock full of blueberries and pretty specks of zucchini.  It was full of flavor, delightfully sweet with a delicate hint of cinnamon.  It was perfect.  I am not.   Don’t forget the zucchini.

This is a great recipe as is, and also works well with some healty substitutions (1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 white, 1/2 applesauce for the oil).  I have also made muffins from this recipe, just up the baking powder to 3 tbsp for a more cake-like texture. I also like to sprinkle them with a little raw sugar before baking to add a nice little crunch. Thanks so much for this great recipe!  A family favorite!

We loved the bread. I used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce.  I also cut the sugar to 2 cups and cinnamon to 1/4 tsp.  I've made large loaves, mini loaves and mini muffins.  They've all turned out great.  This recipe freezes well too.  Enjoy!

Just made these for the first time this morning, but followed some advice from previous reviews.  Substituted half the oil with applesauce, used only 1 1/2 cups sugar and sprinkled a combination of 2T sugar and 2T brown sugar on top.  Baked as muffins for 25 minutes.  This recipe made about 21 muffins.  Next time, I'll use a little less blueberries--maybe 1 1/2 cups.  Great recipe!  Will definitely make again!

This bread came out so good.  My 2 year old "helped" make it and when he figured out that we were eating what we made he couldn't get enough of it -- and also it was really good.  I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup stone ground wheat flour. And I used about half a bag of frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  We loved it, and with 4 mini loaves we gave 2 away and still had alot.

This is only the second time I have left a 5 star review.  I made this bread for a work event today.  I have to say it is one of the best.  The zucchini & blueberry combination is to die for.  I normally don't review if I have made changes.  I feel the recipe should be rated as printed.  However this one I did reduce sugar to 1-1/2 cup (personal preference), baked in a bundt pan (took 1 hour @ 350*) and when cool dusted with powdered sugar. Nothing too major.  I will definitely be making again.  The great thing about this recipe (besides it is just great) is you can make as a loaf, muffins, 9 X 13 or bundt pan style.  Don't hesitate to try this one.  You will be glad you did.  Thanks for posting.

Very good recipe. Like others have said, this is a great way to get the family to eat fruit and veggies w/o even knowing it. I modified it slightly to make it more healthy. I substituted half of the oil for applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and substituted 1 c. whole wheat flour for the white. They were excellent!!!

Loved this recipe! This recipe made 4 mini loaves and 1 regular size loaf for me. The only thing I did different was add 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and it turned out GREAT! It was sweet, moist and delicious... and everyone ate it up!  UPDATE: I added a struessel topping before baking and it made it even more delicious! (1/2 cup flour, 1/2 oat meal, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 6 tbsp. butter. Mix all together and sprinkle on top of bread batter before baking).

I have made this several times and followed some tips from other chefs, and added my own twists. Here is my favorite version:  Use half white and half whole wheat flour; use ALL unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil; use 3 c zucchini instead of 2 c.  Cut sugar down to 1 3/4 cups and use half white and half brown sugar; add 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut to the dry ingredients; and substitute 1 tsp of the vanilla for 1 tsp of coconut extract. Since I prefer muffins to loaves, I also used 5 tsp of baking powder to give it extra rise (you need more baking powder than the original recipe calls for when you use whole wheat flour).

Total calorie count on 12 servings is 5500, so 1 slice would be  460 cal. If you substitute 1/2 oil for 1/2 apple sauce, 1  cup of sugar for splenda, 1.5 cup of flour for 1.5 cup of whole wheat, total calorie count comes to 3500.

100% kid (and mom) approved!  These were fantastic, and the recipe holds up incredibly well to some easy healthy changes.  I used 3/4 cup natural applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil; used only 1 1/2 cups sugar (which I will further reduce next time to probably only 1 cup); and used 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup oat flour (made by grinding oats in my food processor).  I used 2 cups frozen blueberries and didn't waste time rinsing them - some of the muffins were blue in color but that was kind of fun for the kids and still yummy.  Everything else was as specified.  The recipe doubles incredibly well.  I filled muffin tins to the very top and got 30 muffins from this (when I doubled the recipe).

Delicious and easy recipe! I followed recipe exactly and I ended up with 5 mini loaves. In case you are wondering how much is one pint of blueberries it's 2.5 cups. Also, I used one large zucchini and that was exactly 2 cups of shredded zucchini.

This recipe is not very forgiving. I used a smallish zucchini (which I also drained of a lot of its liquid). It yielded a little more than the 2 cups indicated in the recipe. The batter ended up being the proverbial 10 lbs. of stuff in a 5 lb. bag. It rose like the dickins in the oven and overflowed the pan. So... the 4 mini pans don't begin to cover the room needed for this batter. Try using at least 5 if not 6 mini pans. Also, the recipe indicates a "light" greasing of the pans is needed. I greased them well and yet two of the loaves stuck to the bottom of the pans. I only used 2 C sugar instead of the 2 1/4 C required by the recipe, and it still was overly sweet. Also, even when it's cut the next day, it doesn't cut well; it easily crumbles.

OK, this rocked, although I made a lot of adjustments.  I made it more healthy, and it still was raved about. I halved the oil, and added applesauce. I used half whole wheat flour. I cut the sugar to 2 cups, and then used 1 cup of Brown sugar instead.  I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed for the omega fatty acids.  Also, my blueberries were a very ROUNDED 2 cups.  This was so moist and delish. The kids inhaled it!  Yummy delish!

Wow, these were so adorable and delicious. I added the crumb topping suggested by cookiequeen and that takes this fantastic recipe to irresistible and amazing. For Christmas gifts I made these and two other different types of bread from this site and this recipe was hands down the winner. I used frozen blueberries with flour dusted on them so they wouldn't fall to the bottom, half apple sauce and half oil, 3 cups shredded zucchini, 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and a dash of nutmeg. I baked these in mini-loaf pans (8 mini-loaves per pan) and I yielded 16 mini-loaves (2 pans). Baked them for 20 minutes. I've already been asked to make these again.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!
I followed it exactly for the first batch, and it was AMAZING! I wanted to make another batch for my hubby to take to work tomorrow, but my store was out of blueberries! (I know! Crazy!) So I bought a frozen bag of mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries & blackberries) YUM! I could eat the entire loaf by myself! So glad I found this recipe!

AWESOME recipe!!  Of course, I made a few changes because I can't stand to follow a recipe without changing it to be my own!  :)  I used spelt flour instead of AP flour to bump the nutrition and fiber.  I used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2 cups.  I cut the sugar to 2 cups, but will cut it even more next time. Lastly, instead of 1 cup oil, I used 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of greek yogurt. This bread was SO yummy!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. I think this recipe calls for a little too much sugar though - I had super sweet fresh blueberries and didn't need so much sugar. I didn't have mini loaf pans so did one large loaf and then the rest went into muffins. If doing muffins you only need about 20-25 mins in the oven.

Awesome! On a whim I decided to try this simply because I had 2 large zucchinis and a ton of fresh blueberries to use up. I ended up with 2 1/2 cups of shredded zucchinis and a little more than one pint of fresh blueberries. Other than that, I followed everything else called for in the recipe. The ingredients is easy to put together and batter mixes up well. I filled two mini-loaf pans plus a little leftover for a total of 21 mini-loaves. They baked up beautifully all in 50 minutes. I could smell the scent of fresh blueberries baking up in the oven and the essence of cinnamon...oh my! I can see the blueberries bubbling up as they bake. This turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me. A nice combination of blueberries and zucchini this truly is! The zucchini bakes right into the loaves and works perfectly with the blueberries.  The bread is soo moist and tender. The berries itself is juicy with its sweet berries bursting in each mouthful! This is the cutest mini-loaf ever with all the purple/blue bluberries oozing all over the bread. And with the green little specks of zucchinis right along with the berries, it makes this so pretty! The lovely hint of cinnamon is also there. With the exception of the extra bluberries I added, this recipe is good as is! I would not change this at all. It is very moist, tender, flavorful and delicious!

I baked these for 20 minutes in muffin tins - made 24 big muffins (filled the batter the whole way to the top.) I also used about 3 cups of unpeeled shredded zucchini, that I mostly squeezed dry. Topped half with a mix of flour/sugar/butter/cinnamon and left the others plain.  I like the topping ones better, but these are all still great muffins.  Very moist and very good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these and took them to the office and they were a big hit.  I followed most of the suggestions listed (cut down on the sugar, used wheat flour, cut down on the oil, used applesauce, etc.), made them into muffins and it was great.  Next time I may cut down a bit more on the sugar.  I also noticed after shredding the zucchini that it was a bit runny so I squeezed the zucchini before adding it to the mix.  Almost everyone who ate it them didn't even know there was zucchini in the muffin which was the best part!  I will definitely make these again (maybe this weekend!).  thanks for the great recipe and thanks to everyone else for such great suggestions.

When I first made this zucchini bread, I thought it was good, not fabulous.  After it sat a couple of days in the refrigerator, though, it has turned into fabulous!!  Very good!  I didn't change anything.

I made this in 2 regular loaf pans and it turned out very delicious and moist. I made it again but used the 4 mini pans as the recipe states. I gave as Christmas presents and had many compliments. Thank you for sharing a delicious bread.

I used frozen blueberries, half whole wheat and half white flour, decreased the sugar to 1.5C, and used 1/2 C olive oil and 1/2 C applesauce.  It turned out great.  I did a dozen muffins and one large loaf of bread.  This receipe takes longer to bake than expected because of how dense and wet the batter is, but it is worth the wait.  My husband was wary of the veggies, but chowed on the muffins anyway.  A great and easy recipe.  I will make again.

Love it, love it, love it! My daughter and I made this this together and it was so simple. It was moist and delicious. If I could give it more than five stars I would! I will make this again. The only change we made was instead of 1 cup oil, we used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce.

Made this, but in a bundt pan. Turned out great.  Didn't change a thing.  Added frozen blueberries, but forgot to dust them in flour so they were all at the top of the cake (when I turned it out of the bundt pan).  I have more zucchini so I'll make another and freeze it.  Yum.  Thanks for this recipe!

Admittedly, I was skeptical about adding blueberries to zucchini bread, but it turned out really well.  I increased the shredded zucchini to 3 cups so that I could reduce the oil to 2/3 cup.  I also reduced the vanilla and cinnamon to 2 teaspoons each.  I used frozen blueberries.  The bread was moist and delicious and I will make this again.

This recipe was so good!  I had zucchini and blueberries that I needed to use, and this was perfect.  My family ate it up.  Then I made this recipe with chocolate chips instead of berries, and  butterscotch chips as well.  The bread turned out so yummy!  Thank you!

Oh yummy, but so bad for my thighs. I love it, but I will try it with half applesauce next time as some of you reviewers have suggested. I used frozen blueberries and they worked perfectly. An absolutely delicious treat!

Update: I have made this recipe several times since the first time. I now use about 6 ounces of applesauce and about 3 ounces of oil. I reduced the sugar down to 2 cups. It is still just as moist, sweet and delicious as the original recipe.

I used the suggestions to make it healthier.  1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 cup apple sauce (I made mine homemade). I subtracted 1/2 cup sugar and oil. I also used 2 regular loaf pans and cooked for about 70 minutes. It was GREAT!

This bread is so good!  No one would ever guess it has zucchini in it!  I followed the recipe as directed EXCEPT I added 2 teaspoons of pure lemon extract and left out the cinnamon.  Everyone raved about it.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did alter it a bit hoever, only added 1.5 c of sugar, 1 1/2 c of white flour and 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour.  I also added the zest of a lemon.  I think next time I will reduce the sugar to a cup and split the oil to half oil and half applesauce.  Will also probably add some walnuts.

Very yummy bread! I have lots of zucchini to use up (who doesn't right now!!!!) and this looked a bit different than your traditional recipe, so I wanted to give it a try. Boy, it didn't disappoint! The bread is so moist, sweet, and yummy. There is the perfect amount of blueberries, and the cinnamon adds a delicious touch. I did make a couple of changes...I used only one tsp. of vanilla, and  I cut down the sugar to 2 cups. The bread was still very sweet, so it could probably be cut back even more. I would also use applesauce instead of some of the oil next time...one cup is a lot! Thanks for sharing this recipe...it's really yummy!

Yummy in the tummy! After reading several pages of reviews I modified to my taste as follows and it turned out awesome!! I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. Used half  cup applesauce for half the veg oil. Used twice the cinnamon along with 1/2 tsp. clove. AND.... whoever suggested the streudel topping, I WANT TO KISS YOU!! It really rocks this recipe!! Mine had to cook 1 hour plus 20 minutes extra, keep your eye on it, every oven is different. Really, 4 and a half stars.

This was moist and delicious no matter what you add or change in this recipe.  I made 2 large loaves and substituted egg beaters to watch my husbands cholesterol, substituted 1 cup Splenda for the sugar and as as another reader did used 1/2 cup applesauce for some of the oil and 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  To add extra fiber I added 1/4 cup of Fiber One, 2 Tbsp. Wheat Bran, 1/4 cup Raisin Bran & 1/2 cup chopped nuts. I sprinkled the top of each loaf with Raw Sugar so it had a crisp top and very moist inside - My husband loved it and ate 1/2 a loaf in one sitting :-)

I used this recipe and made muffins.  I added about 2 tablespoons of molasses and a dash or so of nutmeg also.  I made a crumb topping with granola, softened butter and white and brown sugar, and cinnamon.  They were so yummy!

Have to say with the ratings here, I ended up being disappointed with how the taste came out.  I used fresh picked blueberries and our own zucchini, took the advice of others and did half applesauce, half oil and a few others.  Taste is okay but a bit too bland for me.  Comparing this to my own regular zucchini bread recipe - which gets rave reviews from family and friends - this did not measure up.  It's okay but not great.

I made these into muffins to freeze for my quick breakfasts on the run. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups & it was perfectly sweet for me. I did half oil, half apple sauce as well as half whole wheat flour and half AP flour. Very good & moist!

Great recipe Just a few changes for me.. I always substitute half applesauce for oil, added a 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups because I used super sweet fresh picked blueberries. I made two 8 inch loaves baking at 350 degrees for 40 minutes and they turned out perfect! Thanks for this great creation!

I used half the oil, replacing the rest with applesauce, and i ended up making one regular sized loaf and a dozen muffins. the recipe is very sweet, made sweeter i assume by my applesauce addition, but its very good! I would make it again.

Made this with exact measurements using frozen blueberries and frozen zucchini both thawed and drained.   Took about 63 minutes to bake and tastes delicious! Saving this recipe for sure!

At 461 cal per slice, no wonder it's good ;)  A bit too rich for my body so:  I also subbed whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the flour, 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and I only used 1 1/4  cups of sugar.   I added 1 tsp almond flavoring and about a cup of berries (strawberries and raspberries aside from the fresh blueberries and about a half cup of juice that was with them.  Baked in 2 regular loaf pans at exactly the same time.  Delish, moist, flavorful.  A keeper!  The only mistake I mad was that I let a couple of seeds from the rather large  zuchini get in and next time I won't do that. (Crunch)

I made exactly as recipe stated and it turned out very well and was so good!  I didn't have mini loaf pans, so I used two regular loaf pans.

I'm docking it one star because I believe the recipe uses way too much sugar and would be just as good by taking it down to just 1 1/2 cups or so.  I also think the amount of cinnamon called for was too much.  While I do love cinnamon, when I bit into the bread it was the first thing I smelled and tasted and it was rather dominating.  I think half the amount should work fine.  Plus, I think I may add in more zucchini next time.  Left as-is the recipe should be renamed Cinnamon Blueberry Bread because those are the only two flavors that come through.

This was so good! I made a few small changes/additions. I used 1/2 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce, used frozen blueberries instead of fresh because its all I had and I added a crumb topping before baking. I may add a little more shredded zucchini next time as I could hardly tell there was any in the bread. It was delicious and I plan on making it with all my extra zucchini from the garden.

Super yummy....but I would note that you need to cook it in a loaf pan for about 1 hour and 20 min. I would suggest doing it in a square pan or doing muffins they take a lot less time to cook.

I received zuc and blueberries from the neighbor's gardens.  I made them this treat as a thank you.  They got rave reviews.  I used only a cup and a half of sugar too!

This Blueberry Zucchini bread is simply excellent.  I have made it several times now and everybody in my very picky family loves it.  It has the perfect balance of sweetness and little tartness because of the blueberries, it is super rich in moisture and texture and bakes beautifully.  Definitively a keeper. Won't leave my recipe box! Thank you Laujra!

I followed another reviewer and made a crumb topping for this out of oatmeal, softened butter, and sugar.  I also used whole wheat flower for 2 of the cups of flour.  Even without the topping it would be delicious.

I don't consider myself a good cook, but I tried this recipe because we have so much zucchini from the garden.  It turned out GREAT!  My husband loves it, my kids love it.  I'll definitely file this one in the recipe collection for future use.  I used muffin tins, and baked for about 20-25 minutes, and they turned out perfect!

Great recipe.  I always try to change recipes to cut out as many simple carbs as I can.  I have a really picky kid, and it's one way I feel I can sneak in healthier choices. Sometimes it works well, and sometimes it is a flop!  With this recipe, it worked really well.  I used 1 cup applesauce (no oil)l, 1 1/4 cup brown sugar (no white sugar) and 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (no white flour).  I find the all natural applesauce has enough sweetness that you can cut way back on the sugar.  I also cut out the cinnamon as we don't like cinnamon.  My super picky daughter loves it!  Thanks for sharing!

These are very good.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and used half applesauce in place of part of the oil and cut the sugar (to 3/4 cup for a half recipe) to make a not-too-sweet, healthy breakfast muffin.  I would like to try these again with more sugar as written when I need a sweeter treat.  I also had 50 percent extra zucchini, so I just went ahead and used it all, and it worked out great.  A half recipe yielded a dozen muffins with nice, round tops.  Loved the blueberry, zucchini, vanilla, cinnamon combination...great tasting and healthy too.

OMG OMG OMG!!!!!  There is a reason this is a 5 star recipe!!!!!! I used half oil and half applesauce only because I ran out of oil and was determined to make these at that very moment.  Will be making double batches from now on and will be making these OFTEN!

I had my 11 year old daughter help me with this..(kid friendly recipe) She thought it the ingredients were completely gross, and when she tasted it, she said they were surprisingly good.  By that evening, she was eating them and proclaiming they were the best!  Even the 7 year old picky boy kept going back for more.  Instead of using mini loaf pans, I used mini muffin tins.  These were such a hit that I am shredding and freezing zucchini in 2 1/3 cup measurements and blueberries in 2 cup measurements for this recipe to have this winter.  Thank for a winner  recipe!

fabulous.  I throw in a mashed banana and decrease the oil to 1/2 c.  I use frozen blueberries all the time and it turns out wonderful!  Just as good with frozen raspberries.  I have tried it with loaf pans, jumbo muffins and mini muffins, but the loaf is still the best way.

I was looking for recipes to use my overabundance of Zucchini when I came across this.  It just so happened that my in-laws had sent me home with blueberries that we could ever eat too, so I tried this bread.  It was actually very good.  I cut down on the sugar a bit and substituted some ground flax meal for oil, but it turned out quite tasty.

Wonderful! 

I did change the recipe to healthify it up :) I cut the sugar in half and used 2 overripe bananas smashed. I also cut the oil in half and used a 1/2 cup of applesauce in its place. I then followed the direction of other people who reviewed it and used half all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.

I used two standard sized loaf pans and cooked for about an hour and ten minutes and they came out perfectly!

I just made this today and it turned out really moist & delicious. I wanted to add the crumble topping some reviewers mention, but didn't have the brown sugar on hand. I'm a huge fan of the crumbles, but after making it plain, I don't think it needed it after all.

I used frozen blueberries and they worked perfectly. I didn't thaw them or anything, but just stirred them in frozen. 

I didn't have mini loaf pans either, so I used 2 separate pans. One 9 x 11 glass pan, and a 4 x 9 glass loaf pan. This configuration required a cooking time of 1 hr 10 minutes.

My husband doesn't like blueberries, but I love them. I'll eat the little loaf and take the big pan to work tomorrow. I can't wait to be everyone's favorite! ;)

Excellent! To make the recipe more low fat, I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup olive oil. Used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour.  I also only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Used a crumble topping on top with 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1 T. cinnamon and 1/4 cup margarine.  Cooked in 2 loaf pans for 1 hour and 15 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, I used 2 cups and let them thaw while putting the rest of the ingredients together. Will definitely make again and again!

I made this exactly as written...except I did a few modifications to make this healthier.  First I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for half of the oil, reduced the sugar to just 2cups and used half wheat flour in place of half white flour.  I kept everything else exactly the same.  These were so yummy.  I made a quick little crumb topping using oats, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and enough Country Crock Light to make it wet.  These are a big hit in my house and a wonderful way to use up extra zucchini from the garden.  Will use this recipe for years to come!

This bread is AMAZING as is...the second time I made it I reduced the sugar by over half, replaced most of the oil with applesauce, and half of the flour I replaced with whole wheat.  I skipped the topping to save even more calories.  It was absolutely fabulous this way!  I also didn't bake it as long as the recipe stated...

EXCELLENT!  Didn't make any changes (except for using frozen blueberries b/c it's hard to come by fresh organic blueberries in February in CO) and it came out great.  May try substituting some applesauce for some of the veggie oil next time to cut back on the fat - but I've tried it before in other recipes with less than tasty results, so we'll have to see.  :)

Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  We really loved the bread and are sharing it with friends and family, too!  I took advice from other reviewers and replaced half the oil with applesauce.  Otherwise, followed recipe precisely (including the baking time, which is spot-on!), to great effect.  Next time, I might try adding a little sugar to the loaf pans and the batter-tops for a more interesting crust.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe has received top ratings from everyone to whom I've given some: family members, friends, neighbors. The bread is really moist and the blueberry flavor isn't overpowered by any other tastes. The recipe also responds well to substitutions, like whole wheat flour for white and applesauce for part of the oil. I've also cut the sugar back to a cup and a half without anyone even noticing, including my picky 3-yr-old! Thanks for sharing - now I have something new to do with the zucchini my garden seems to be producing on an hourly basis!

Easy to make with my kids. The blueberries make it a great way to hide the veggies so kids love it. I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf pan of great tasting bread. I also use half cup olive oil and 1/2c cup 0% Fage greek yogurt for lower fat version.

soooo good! we made muffins. added 3 tsp (instead of 1 tsp) baking powder to make more "cakey" as suggested my another commenter. subbed 1 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of some of the oil. used slightly less sugar. fresh blueberries in it are to die for. perfect!!

This was GREAT.  And ridiculously foolproof.  I halved the sugar, and found it plenty sweet; used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup white, substituted most of the oil for apple sauce, and a bit of yogurt that I was trying to get rid of, had lots of zucchini so used all that up, and used 2 cups of frozen blueberries.  I baked 2 regular sized loaves for 57 minutes.  Even with all these changes, it was incredible.   I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!!!!

Wow...this bread is delicious! I peeled the zucchini before I shredded it...just so there wouldnt be any green flecks in it. To make it healthier I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 applesauce. Also, I only used 1 1/2 cup of sugar..and a teaspoon of cinnamon. The blueberries were sweet enough. It came out perfect! My 5 year old loved it and asked for seconds.

I substituted the Veg Oil with 1/4 cup of coconut oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. It made 1 regular bread loaf pan size and 2 mini loaves. Excellent taste- we will be making again!

These are wonderful! I used the crumb topping suggested in one of the other reviews. I also decreased the sugar to 2C and added 1/4C brown sugar. I used a mini-loaf stone that had 4 mini-loaves and I had plenty of batter left over (I could have easily made 5 loaves) so I used the rest for muffins. Both were excellent but it was hard to tell when the muffins were done because of the crumb topping. I will definitely make these again! Everyone at work loved them!

Very good.  I followed another reviewers advice and omitted the cinnamon and added 2 tsp. pure lemon extract and it was fantastic.  I would cut the sugar down to 2 c. next time as I found it a bit sweet for me.  I used a regular loaf pan and it worked fine. Will definitely make again.

Very flavorful and moist - the blueberries add a nice touch to what so often is a ho-hum summer staple!  
I made in two loaf pans and cut the sugar back to 1 and a half cups.  I'll be making this again.

These are delicious!  The amount of blueberries is generous and fantastic!  I make them in jumbo muffin pans and made several changes to get the total calories down below 350.  First, for the muffins, I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 cups as other reviewers suggested and substituted half of the oil for applesauce.  I'm a sucker for crumb toppings so I used the crumb topping recipe from cookiequeen with a few exceptions.  For my crumb topping used: 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon,  1/2 stick softened butter-mixed altogether with hand.  You hardly notice the little cuts and don't have to feel as guilty about eating them.

Great recipe! I needed to use up all the zucchini had picked from my garden. This was perfect. But I made several changes to make it healthier. First, I used 1 cup of honey in place of all the sugar. Then I used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour in place of all the white flour and 1 cup applesauce (no sugar added) in place of the oil. I also squeezed all the water out of the zucchini (I probably used a little more than two cups, I didn't measure. I just had 5 small zucchini that needed using up) and I added 1/4 cup wheat bran and 2 tbsp wheat germ. I lowered the temperature to 320 degrees (because of the honey) and cooked it in muffin pans. I don't know how long it took to cook. I just used my moms method of checking on them soon as they start smelling really good. Worked perfect! Could maybe be a little sweeter though. Next time I might use a 1/4 cup more honey.

Yummy.  I've eaten it with and without changes noted by others.  This is a favorite for fourth of July events, I bake several loaves and slice them.  Then make a simple blueberry syrup (1 cup blueberries covered with water, 3/4 C sugar simmer until thickened).  I take loaf and syrup to even.  Place on slices on platter. drizzle syrup over slices, add a dollop of whip cream to each slice and garnish with a sliced strawberry.  Red, white, blue and easy!

Absolutely loved it!  Cut the sugar down to 2 cups as recommended; 1 c. white, 1 c. brown.  Added pecans.  Will try using 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil to cut fat.  Takes a lot longer to shred zucchini by hand than I thought it would.   2 cups shredded is about 2 medium zucchinis.
I also baked it in 2 loaf pans instead of the minis.  Took about 1 hr 10 mins to cook.
I will also try adding some cranberries next time.  
Overall a very flavorful, moist bread!

Moist and delicious!
Substituted squash for zucchini, since that's what I had on hand.
Used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.
Used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar.
Added 1 c. chopped pecans.
Try it, you'll like it!

This was really good and warmed up very nicely the next day for breakfast. I did two regular loaf size pans. Well one was silicone and the other was glass. The glass one came out way better then the silicone.  I cooked them for about an hour and 10 minutes. I also did the crumb topping but I think next time ill skip it, its sweet enough with out it :)

The bread was great, however, there is a reason for putting it in mini loaves or muffins.... I used two regular bread pans and even though I baked it 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated, the middle was still raw (the edges were brown).  Due to the extra juices, it would be wise to use smaller pans or less blueberries....

Very very yummy. I ended up with a ton of batter (perhaps because I put in about 3 cups zucchini) so I made 5 mini loaves instead of four. I doubted that mini loaves needed 50 minutes to bake so I pulled them out at 37 mintues - that was a mistake. If they look like they're getting too brown on top, just cover them with foil or something and keep them in for longer. The one loaf I've cut into came out all mushy in the center. :( It still tastes amazing! Just not something I'll wrap up and give to friends.

This bread was really good but I admit I didn't make as directed. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce; 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar; 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon lemon extract. I know that might seem like too much extract but the flavors weren't overpowering. I also used cookiequeen's topping (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, and walnuts) before baking. It makes a lot but I was able to pack almost all of it on between the two loaves before baking. The lemon flavor was a refreshing addition and went very well with the blueberries of course. Very moist and delicious!

Very good. Personally, i don't like zucchini bread terribly well, but this turned out fantastic. I had a HUGE zucchini, so i ended up using 3.5 cups of shredded/peeled zucchini and it ended up being a wonderful dense bread! Next time, i would cut it back to 3 cups. I also made a brown sugar/white sugar/ cinnamon crust. Somehow my mother ended up getting rid of my loaf pan, so i baked it in an angel-food-cake-pan and it turned out wonderful. 

I also tossed my blueberries in flour before adding them to prevent them from sinking to the bottom.
Can't wait to make again!

I read quite a few of the reviews and then decided to take some of the ideas. I did use 1/2  cup oil and the other 1/2 cup  applesauce. I used  1 1/2 cups each on white flour and whole wheat flour and kept the amount of sugar the same.  I also added a bit more on the zucchini and a 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I floured the blueberries lightly and didn't have the problem with them sticking to the bottom of the pans. This made 2 loaves for me and I used Pam on 1 and greased the other loaf pan with shortening. They both came out no problem but a little easier on the loaf pan using the shortening. This is one of the best blueberry loaves I have made and will continue to be the only one I use now. This is very moist and you don't even know the zucchini is in it. My 17 month old  grandsons devoured this.

This was delicious.  I used 1/3 oat flour.  I would use only 2 cups of sugar next time (and try less the time after that).  I use 2 loaf pans.

Sooooooo good! I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil. I've made it several times with both fresh and frozen berries. It is wonderful everytime and freezes wonderfully.

I made this in one big pan to yield 16 good-sized pieces (cut like a cake). I replaced half of some ingredients to reduce it from 8 pts (Weight Watchers speak) to 5 pts per serving. 1/2 oil replaced with applesauce. 1/2 white flour replaced with wheat flour. 1/2 sugar replaced with Splenda. Turned out fine. Not as sweet, I'm sure, but good.

I made this as regular sized loafs and added the crumb topping.  The loaves were mushy at the bottom. The crumb topping rose off of the bread so it all fell off when I took it off of the pan. Very disappointing.

Changes I made: frozen blueberries, only 2 cups sugar (half brown, half white), and for the flour, I subbed out one cup with whole wheat pastry flour.  It was delicious!  It baked perfectly, it tastes great without any spread on it, and I am looking forward to playing around with healthier variations, like sweet potato or apple sauce instead of the oil, and possibly replacing more of the white flour, perhaps with oat bran.  This is a great way to use up produce and eat your veggies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Made just like it called for, but made 1 large loaf, 1 mini loaf and 6 muffins.  Next time I would like to try cutting the oil in half and decreasing the sugar a bit!  A great way to use up zucchini!

Yum.  Some of the best muffins I've made.  Of course, I made a few changes...used 2 sticks butter instead of oil, made muffins instead of loaves, and used frozen instead of fresh blueberries.  Added a bit of crumb topping, too.  Everyone at work loved them.  Great way to use up my extra zucchini from my garden!

Even my veggie-hating husband liked this.  I made mini-muffins, muffins, coffee cake, and loaves, most of which got streusel topping (a great addition).  Other than that, the only change I made was to substitute melted butter for oil in the muffins and a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the AP flour.  This is a keeper--much better than generic zucchini breads.

Excellent flavor & texture all around. I used paper mini loaf 'pans' that cost .60 each and baked them on a heavy cookie sheet. They took a bit longer to bake than the recipe, but the toothpick test was easy and accurate. No need to grease the paper pans, they look very nice for gift giving (brown-ish w/a design), and peeled right off the bread without marring it at all.

Moist and delicious!! My husband and kids loved this bread.  They are not fans of zucchini and said they wouldn't have even known that there was zucchini in the bread if I didn't tell them. As cookiequeen suggested, I changed up the sugar and used 2 cups white and 1/4 cup brown and added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also added a crumb topping before baking (2/3 c. flour, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 c. quick oats mixed together and cut in 1 stick butter).  I made 2 regular sized loaves and cooked for 65 minutes.  Even though I used cooking spray, the loaves stuck a little to the bottom of the pans.  Next time I will line the bottom with parchment paper.

I am giving this recipe five stars instead of four because I feel that after reading the reviews the changes I made may have knocked it down a star or two from the recipe as written.  I used a half cup applesauce in place of half of the oil and I used two cups of King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour and one cup of all purpose flour.  Although the end result was very moist, I could taste the applesauce (I used all natural, no sugar added sauce) and the flavor did not wow me.  Although I thought that 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon was a respectable amount it just wasn’t enough oomph for me.  I made a topping of butter, flour, oats, and cinnamon as other reviewers suggested and I thought it added to the end product both in flavor and appearance.

Moist and delicious.  I replaced half the oil with applesauce and used a little more than called for.  Could add more zucchini and less sugar.  If you're using regular size loaf pans, it makes two somewhat flat loaves.

I made this bread last night and it turned out great. The only thing I did different was I used a half pint of blueberries and a half pint of strawberries and raspberries. It's really pretty. Next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I think I will coat the pans with cinnamon and sugar for a little crunch on the crust.  You must try this recipe.

With an abundance of both zucchini and blueberries, this bread has been baked every few days to share friends and co-workers.  I did cut the oil in half, and added cinnamon applesauce for the balance of the oil.  This bread is awesome!

I have made several different variations in Zucchini bread and this was the best I have ever come across. Everyone who tried it at my house was amazed at the flavor and how moist it was. I did not change 1 iota of the recipe and after making it, I don't feel the need to change anything.

I am suprised so many people think this is the best zucchini bread. It just didn't do it for me. There are much better breads out there. Also, make sure you realize that this is for mini loaves. I didn't realize it and was stuck using a regular size loaf pan and that didn't work out well.

I don't know if anyone else has done this, but I substituted freshly picked YELLOW CROOKNECK SQUASH for the Zucchini.   You'd NEVER know it!  This was delicious!

My husband HATES zucchini. I told him he would like it in bread but he didn't belirve me. He shreaded the zucchini & was in shock when I mixed it in. I found this recipe yesterday & read the reviews. I too did not think blueberries & zucchini would be a good combo, but I trusted the others who have  tried it. WHAT A HIT!!!! oh my gosh!!! SO YUMMY! I went with 1 1/2 c white sugar & 3/4 c. brown. The batter didn't look like what I was expecting...but I didn't make any other changes. I divided the batter in 1/2....1/2 I used frozed/thawed blueberries which were wonderful & 1/2 dried cranberries. I made 1 mini loaf and 4 muffins from each. I'm sure the bread will be great...but we were too full from eating the muffins. Next time I'll try pineapple. Thanks for posting this!

Very yummy recipe!  I really like the blueberries, but they make the loaf runnier than usual and so maybe I will omit them next time I make this.  Also, I baked it in a larger loaf pan, and it was hard to gadge the time and so next time I will try making them into muffins.  I also used only 1.5 cups of sugar, substituting 1/2 of brown sugar.  And I used more zucchini and only 3/4 c of oil.  All in all, it turned out delicious, and I will be definitely making this again!

*2nd Note* I made this again as muffins, and I thought they were even more delicious!  I think the less time it has to spend in the oven, the better!  I baked them for 20 min, and they came out beautifully!

Not usually a reciped tweeker, I read the reviews first and made some small changes.  Added a nutless crumb topping(because of allergies) and put equal parts white and brown sugar.  Cooked in BIG muffin tins instead of mini-loaves.  First day they were good, second day they were great, third day they were gone.  Making more tomorrow.

This was my first time making zucchini bread and it turned out great. My 2 year old loved it and I feel good that he's getting a serving of veggies and fruit. (Note: I used FROZEN blueberries and cooked it for a total of 60 minutes) Moist and sweet with a crunchy top. Will definitely make this one again.

Fantastic.  After reading the other reviews, I only added a cup of sugar and they turned out just sweet enough.  They came out like blueberry muffins, and you couldn't tell the zucchini was there at all.   I also added a little lemon zest, just because I had some i needed to use.

This recipe was awesome everyone raved about how good it was.  I wound up with 6 pans instead of 4.  It is good to put in the freezer to eat at a later time.  It is a good way to use up your zucchini.

I loved this bread and turned it into a cake with Lemon Buttercream Frosting from a recipe I found on food.com. I think next time I will add lemon zest and juice to the cake to give it more of a lemony taste.

My family and I love this recipe.  We make it often without any changes and it is perfect.  If we do not  have one of the ingredients we substitute something else and it still turns out.  I have replaced the blueberries with apples, strawberries and peaches and it has always turned out great.

I love zucchini bread and I love blueberries so I was anxious to try this.  I made it in a bundt pan and it took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to cook.  It turned out beautifully.  I followed many of the suggestions of other commenters to make it a little more healthy.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I used 1/2 cup of greek yogurt and 1/2 cup of oil instead of a full cup of oil.  I cut the cinnamon and vanilla back to 2 tsp each (3 tsp just seemed like it would be too much).  I cut the sugar way back to 1 1/2 cups and it was plenty sweet with that.  I also added the zest of one lemon, because I love the flavors of blueberry and lemon together.  I used fresh blueberries and tossed them in about a tablespoon of flour before folding them in.  They did not rise or sink, but stayed evenly mixed throughout the batter.  Next time, I will add chopped pecans.  I am sure this recipe would be wonderful as muffins.

Excellent recipe.  Extreamly moist.  Used 3 cups of zucchini, substituted in 1/2 cup w. wheat flour, substituted in lemon zest & juice from 1 lemon in place of 1/4 cup of the vegetable oil (since lemon & blueberries are a good combo).  Used 2 cups FROZEN blueberries instead of fresh. I folded them in quickly from the freezer, first coating them with some flour so they don't "bleed" while the loaves are cooking. I also used the crumb topping from most helpful review from "cookiequeen".  That topping was crispy and crumbly without too much sweetness.

just lovely. used about 2/3's of a giant zucchini, which yielded around 2.5 cups. i made muffins instead, only altering the recipe by adding an extra tsp of baking powder, and got exactly 2 dozen perfect muffins. i sure do love my food processor for dealing with the zucchini! (have made it a couple of times since, with raspberries, or half the recipe as a single loaf ... it's all fabulous!)

This makes really delicious, moist muffins.  I got six jumbo muffins (baked for 38 mins) and 20 regular sized muffins (baked at approx 22 min).  Very easy to make, as well.  Thanks for the great recipe, LAUJRA!

This was pretty good, but I, personally, didn't really care too much for the blueberries in a zucchini bread.  After a few days, it seemed that the flavor of the blueberries intensified and drowned out whatever other flavors were in the bread.  It was pretty good the first day, though.  Don't think I'd make again this way.

Fantastic!  I substituted apple sauce for the oil, brown sugar for white, and whole wheat flour for bleached and the zucchini bread was still delicious, even for my husband, 7-year old son and his friend.

This was awesome!!! I don't have mini loaves, so I split the batter between 2 regular loaf pans. Cooked for 65 minus. *Awesome addition - With 20 minutes left, I poured a mix of 2 tablespoons of melted butter with 1 tablespoon of a cinnamon/sugar mix and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. It made the top almost carmelly. Mmmm

This recipe was incredibly moist and delicious.  I made a couple of alterations/additions as suggested by cookiequeen.  I added 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2, used 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white, and added cookiequeen's struesel topping.  I made it in two standard loaf pans and baked for about 70 minutes.  I'll be making this for many years to come.

This recipe makes LOVELY muffins! I don't own a loaf pan, so I opted to make muffins instead of bread. I did not alter the ingredients in this recipe for the muffins, only the cooking time. I changed the recipe to yield 8 servings, and that made approx a dozen muffins, and I baked them for 20-25 minutes. My BF had never had a baked good with zucchini in it before I made this... he was skeptical at first, but after he tried it, he ate 3 more! I had sat down and had a muffin with a cup of tea and I just couldn't get over how good they were. I think I will prefer to make them as muffins because it's less messy. I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand and be making it many more times!

I'm glad i waited to rate this recipe bc it is SOOOO totally yummy the day AFTER baking.  didn't have the 4 mini loaf pans so I just used 2 standard size pans.  baked it for about 10 min longer than recipe said bc that was how long it took for my toothpick to come out clean,  the day of baking I thought this bread was good but not spectacular then this morning with coffee I had a slice...YUM!  the blueberries really are the star of the show in this recipe.  so so good!  I picked this bread bc my son LOVES blueberries but I am not a huge fan.  In this bread though they are delicious.  will 100% be making this again and soon as my zucchini plants are producing more squash than I know what to do with :D

I used 1/4 cup less sugar, because I read from other reviewers it was too sweet, and because I read another reviewer mention it lacked flavor, I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. I think it wouldn't hurt to put in even more cinnamon

Excellent. Per reviewers' recommendation, subbed apple sauce for some of the oils, subbed wheat flour for some of the white. Used thawed frozen blueberries (4 cups was perfect amount) and zucchini. I gasped at the cinnamon amount, but it was just right. Sprinkled raw sugar on my muffins for a nice crunchy top. Sprinkled Quaker Oats instant apple/cinnamon oatmeal (what was available) on top of a loaf for an attractive and delicious touch.

Excellent!  I made as muffins and did the following substitutions:  unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil (1:1 ratio); 1/2 oat flour 1/2 reg flour; splenda instead of sugar.  Would make these again and again and again...

This makes a great zucchini bread.  I loved the idea of blueberries and zucchini together.  I do have to say I prefer our original zucchini bread over this one.  But this was a nice change with the blueberries.  We ended up making loaves and muffins with this and added a crumb/oat topping.   We made some with the topping and some without.  I liked both but I think I liked the ones without just slightly better.  Thanks for this great bread idea!

These were very popular with all the neighbors I shared them with, they were very moist and absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did was add more Zucchini, I find it just makes it more moist as I do the same with my banana bread too.

Made as 2 loaves...way way way undercooked at the suggested cooking time.  Flavor was ok.  The house did smell great while baking but the bread was somewhat disappointing.

Everyone loved this when I made it for a party! It's really yummy! I decreased the amount of sugar by about half, and instead of 1 cup veg. oil, I used 1/2 cup veg oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I love this recipe!!

Very tasty bread though a bit too sweet for my taste.  Cut the sugar back by 1/2.

Wow, this is good!  I was a little uncertain about using zucchini and blueberries together, but it really works!  And makes sense as they're in season together.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and was definitely sweet enough.  Whole family loved it!

Oh my gosh I have to say this is the BEST zucchini bread I have ever had!! The blueberries are perfect with it and cookiequeen's suggestions made it amazing too! Great topping! I also subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour w/ 2 cups all purpose.  Delish!

I modified by making this into a bunt cake.

i also:

(1) used 1/2 pint blueberries instead of 1 pint
(2) added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts
(3) shredded the zucchini using a veggie chopper for slightly larger pieces than shredded
(4) baked at 350 for 60 min. instead of 50 min (since i used a Bunt Cake pan)
(5) drizzled a glaze made from vanilla, powdered sugar and milk over the top

doing thus, this turned into THE BEST CAKE i have EVER made.

Excellent! Next time I'd add a little more zucchini... and would definitely include a brown sugar/butter crumbly topping again as another review describes.

Made as muffins, baking for 25 minutes. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and nearly 1 1/2 cups white sugar and that was enough.

Made as-in with the exception of using a bit more zucchini and slightly less blueberries (because of what was on hand).  Maybe my mini-loaf pans are smaller than the OP but I got 3 mini-loaves plus 6 shaped muffins.  The flavor was much better once completely cooled and even better the next day.  Took 2 loaves to a picnic and they were gone in a flash!  Everyone loved it!

I've made this recipe two ways. It is wonderful as written. The other way , I used applesauce for 2/3 of the oil. This is also delicious but took 10 minutes longer to bake.

I made this a few weeks ago and we loved it, even my dad, who is the ultimate food critic said "it is the best zucchini bread" he has ever had.  I was afraid to try a new recipe, but I am so glad I tried this one! It is a keeper, I just bought blueberries today to make more this week!

Fabulous! I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and made 1 large loaf and 12 muffins. They turned out great; everybody loved them. Terrific way to use up those huge zucchinis I find hiding under the leaves! Thanks! :)

Delicious!!  I used half white half wheat flour and 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/4.  Also half applesauce, half oil and put in 2 large pans and baked for a little over an hour I think it was.  Also, sprinkled the top with sugar cinnamon.

I didn't have loaf pans so I used 2 8x8x8 glass pyrex pans. I am positive i used closer to 3 cups of zucchini as i wanted to use all i had. It cooked wonderfully and was a hit with my entire family. Even the ones that can't stand zucchini.

simple recipe. i too used 3 cups of zucchini. i also added the blueberries after i poured half of the mixture into 1 regural loaf pan. To the second half I added about 1/4 cocoa powder and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. My husband prefers chocolate and I prefer the blueberry. Also great for muffins.

Delicious bread.  Cut sugar to heaping 1/2 C of white and 1/2 C packed brown, grated 1 small fresh apple for half of the oil and used 2-3 C zucchini, plus a little nutmeg.  Made a crumb topping with 1/2 C flour, sugar and oats, 1 tsp cinnamon and mixed with butter and coconut oil.  Though topping was yummy it was messy, and unneeded. This is a keeper for fresh blueberry season - but seriously you can cut the sugar and it's still sweet.

Followed recipe exactly, used two large loaf pans, took 1 hr 20 min.  Nice and moist and very tasty. Hubby likes nuts in his breads, so I added 1 cup chopped pecans.

Loved the addition of blueberries - added a really nice moist and tangy component.  I substituted whole wheat flour and splenda, and my mini loaf pans are little larger so just made 3 loaves.  I have another recipe for zucchini bread but it is ALOT more work to make, and not as tasty.  I'm throwing that one away!  I absolutely will make again, but will probably add nuts, which I always like in my bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this bread on Sunday, it is fantastic. I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/4c brown sugar.  We loved it, it smelled so good had to break into one before it completely cooled down.  Couldn't wait until this morning to have for breakfast.  This beat my favorite banana bread recipe hands down...thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!! I also made a crumb topping with 1/4 cup oats, 1/4 c flour, and a bit of cinnamon and enough batter (~2 TBSP) to make it crumbly.  I also added almost a cup more zuke.  Wonderful!!

Excellent.  I used 1 c frozen blueberries, added the topping per the other reviewer, omitted the cinnamon and baked 60-70 minutes in 10" tube pan.  Delicious.  A new family favorite.

Yum! I health-a-fied it up some, too. Used 2 c ww flour and 1 c ap flour. Used 1 c br sugar and 1/2 c white. Replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce. Sprinkled in some nutmeg. And I even put in some shredded yellow squash that I needed to use up. Made muffins with the same temp, at 20-25 min like another reviewer suggested.

Made these again and got rave reviews from everyone...excellent recipe.

Excellent recipe. This is my first attempt at zucchini bread and it came out perfectly.  The only changes I made was to reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup and added another cup of zucchini and it still came out great.

AMAZING! My husband doesn't like fruit or veggies and he LOVED this recipe so much that it made his Facebook status! I bought my zucchini from my local Farmers Market which made it even better and more delicious in my eyes!

Absolutely fantastic!  Made a mistake and only used 2 cups sugar but it was perfect!  Moist & very tasty.  It's going to be hard not to eat an entire loaf by myself.  Used some blueberries that I had frozen a few weeks agos...only thawed them out 1/2 way before adding to batter.  YUM YUM YUM!  Forgot to mention that I baked them in 2 reg sized bread pans for about 1 hr & 20 mins, until toothpick came out clean. Love this recipe!!

I subbed the following: a little more than half flour for whole wheat pastry flour, half oil for applesauce, half sugar for Splenda. The extra fiber made it more filling and satisfied my hunger, so one slice with coffee will be enough for breakfast. I used less blueberries (BB) than called for because my BB were huge! I'm so glad I used less! Next time I'll use dried BB because while I like the flavor I didn't like the extra globs of moisture. This will be a staple recipe for me, and will be used in variation  by adding nuts or dried cranberries, pears, etc. I sprinkled the top with a little sugar for a little crispness...the family is going back for seconds as I write this review and my husband hates vegetables!

Made into 2 8x4 loaves, baked for 1 hour 20 minutes and otherwise followed directions perfectly (using frozen blueberries). Thanks! Extremely good and cinnamony, the blueberries add a really nice touch. Thanks!

This is a favorite at our house! I have made it many times and it is always devoured quickly. I used applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour and an extra cup of zucchini.

Good bread. As written, this recipe is pretty tasty, although it is very sweet as other reviewers have mentioned. I've made it with 1 cup of the flour replaced with whole wheat, 1/4 of the oil replaced with applesauce, and the sugar reduced by 1/4 cup. Made this way, the bread is still very sweet and moist. Also, this recipe works fine with a pint (2 cups) of frozen blueberries instead of fresh. Finally, this bread freezes well. Once the bread has completely cooled, slice it into thick pieces and freeze in a ziplock bag. Pull one slice out at a time and warm it in a toaster oven for an easy breakfast. It tastes just as good as when it came out of the oven the first time!

Excellent recipe!  To help cut the fat down, I use about 3/4 of a cup of mashed overripe banana (which is one to two bananas depending on the size) and only 1/4 cup of oil.  The bread still turns out nice and moist.  Delicious!

I made the recipe as listed and it came out great, just had a problem getting it out of the pan. Not sure if it was my blueberries or what, but one of the loaves broke, leaving the bottom half in the pan. Still, it was delicious and moist and I will definitely use this recipe again.

This turned out really good. I used two regular bread loafs and cooked it like the other user said for 1 hr and 20 mins. I think next time I'll do it for fifteen minutes less because the ends were more done than I'd have liked.   I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and added nutmeg and cloves.

This was great! I used 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 white flour and 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce, and it was wonderful. I also added the following topping:  1/3 cup flour 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 t. cinnamon 3 T butter (cut in with pastry blender or fork). This made 3 small loaves plus an extra small.

This recipe was sooooo wonderful, took it to work and everyone gave great reviews.  I made a regular sized loaf of bread and 12 muffins using this quanitity and they all turned out great.  I took other's advice and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I also used a crumb topping made up of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp flour, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp butter.  Yummy delicious!  This will definately become a favorite recipe.

What a wonderful way to use zucchini!!!  My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I used only 1/2 cup oil and did a 1/2 cup applesauce to cut  back on some of the fat.  I also ended up adding a 1/2 cup more flour as it looked slightly runny before I put it in the oven.  It came out fluffy and blasting with flavor!  I will use this over and over.  Thanks!

My family absolutely loved this recipe! It was moist and delicious. I did make a steusel topping to put on it before baking, I think this made all the difference in the world. I will definitely make this recipe again. It is a new family fave!! 2/3 C bisquick 2/3 C brown sugar 1 tsp. cinnamon 4 T butter

I know a main part of this recipe, heck it's the main title, is the zucchini. I didn't do this intentionally, promise, but I left that out and replaced with apple chunks. Also I added some oatbran as a replacment and it took FOREVER! to bake. At least 30 minutes extra but (now not even fully baked) now it tastes like warm cinnamon oatmeal, yum!

Very very moist even though I replaced 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  I could barely taste the blueberries so I'd suggest putting in less cinnamon so it doesn't overpower the blueberry flavour.  I took out about 1/2 cup of sugar and if I make this again, I'll probably take out another 1/2 cup of sugar.  Makes 2 full-sized loaves.

Delicious!  Like many others, I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil and it was still very moist.  I also made two large loaves instead of 4 small.  My baking time was 1hr 5 min at 350.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very good when made exactly according to the recipe - 5 stars. BUT... The 2nd time I made it I substituted almond extract for the vanilla extract, and it seems to bring out more of  the flavor of the blueberries.  I also added 1/2 C chopped nuts to the batter and  a light sprinkling of sugar & cinnamon to the top before baking. This time it scored a perfect 10!

This is the BEST zucchini bread ever! My husband hates zucchini and zucchini bread. He rolled his eyes when I was making it. I had to practically force him to try it and he LOVED it! I even forgot the blueberries (too many kids, lol) and it was absolutely perfect! The only changes I made were that I used raw sugar and 50/50 flour (half wheat, half unbleached). Super moist and sweet. It made quite a lot, but sadly it's all gone. Time to make more!

This was delicious and super moist!  My kids and husbamd loved it!  I made a few changes: used 1/2 cup reduced fat buttermilk and 1/2 cup canola oil. used only 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 was white and the other was light brown sugar and I used 2 full cups of both the zucchini and blueberries.  I also made a topping like other reviewers suggested of a equal amount of brown sugar, oats (old fashioned) then about a 1/4 cup flour and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and cut in a 1/2 a stick of cold butter cut in small cubes- I made 2 large loafs and one small....so excellent definately a saved favorite since I have a bummer crop of zucchini already starting this summer! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was absolutely wonderful to make and eat.  Made a little adjustment using 2 cups of splenda blend. Also used 1 cup of applesauce instead of oil to make it a low fat treat.

My kids and I loved this recipe!  It's a different twist to zucchini bread and I will definitely add this to our favorites.  I used two regular loaf pans and baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes, as was suggested by another reviewer, and I sprinkled  the bottoms of the greased pans  with cinnamon sugar. Also I followed the suggestion of using 2 cups sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  They came out perfectly.

I've made this bread on 3 occasions and it turned out delicious each time. I even used yellow squash in place of the zucchini (as that's what I had on hand) and the result was just as good. The baking time definitely needs to be increased to 60-70 minutes as the bread is not fully baked after only 50 minutes. Great recipe!

I made this exactly as written.  I put the batter in a muffin tin and made 24.  I baked at 350 for about 35 minutes.  I will make the brown sugar/sugar mixture for the top next time and use some applesauce.  Yummy muffins!

This was awesome zucchini bread.  I followed some peoples advice and used half applesauce instead of oil (sweetened), and I used half the sugar.  It was plenty sweet for me.  I only had a 9x5 banana bread pan, which worked fine except it took an extra 25 min to bake.  And it came out looking like a loaf of bread (which flattened when it cooled).  Baking rocks!

Wow!  This is great!!  I gave a loaf of this to a chef friend and he said he ate the entire loaf in one sitting because he just couldn't stop.  He said it's the best sweet bread he's ever had.

FABULOUS!! A true favorite- I will be making many more times, I promise! Blueberries were a bit expensive so I only bought a little box which didn't seem like enough for me but I happened to have a pomegrante on hand so I broke it open and added the seeds to the batter. The seeds are still a little hard but softend significatly- similar to the texture of adding nuts.  Simply delicious! The batter perfectly made 4 mini loafs- awesome for freezing and bringing out for the holidays and gift giving. I did do 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and topped with a little large grain white sugar before baking. So with all the fruit and zucchini and 1/2 the oil- this is a pretty healthy snack that even the kids will like! I would give it 10 stars if I could! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Moist, flavorful and delicious! It can be much healthier too! I substituted 2/3 cup applesauce for oil, using just 1 T oil.  also, i used just 1 1/2 cups sugar which was plenty!! I highly recommend making this one!

I made it this following the recipe exactly except for using 2 loaf pans and baking for 1 hour 20 minutes as one review said to do.  It was wonderful.  I am getting ready to make it again today and I plan on using half whole wheat flower and putting a topping in the loaf, of brown sugar,  nutmeg, cinamin and some oatmeal we will see which is better.

Amazing! I used 1/2 the oil and substituted the other 1/2 with applesauce. I cut the amount of sugar to just 2 cups and substituted 1/2 of it with brown sugar. Also substituted 1/2 of the white flour with all-wheat flour. I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and a bit more blueberries than the original recipe called for. My girlfriend made her own batch of this with gluten-free biscuit and baking mix and WOW! Just as good, if not better.

I have made this recipe twice now.  Absolutely delicious! Made it exactly as the recipe states.  Didn't change a thing. My family loved the bread. I used two regular loaf pans and got two big loaves. This recipe is a keeper especially during the summer when we are have so many zucchini.

I've never had Zucchini bread before and now it's my absolute favorite! I made it last night using this recipe. My husband and I loved it. The only changes I made were using frozen blueberries instead of fresh and one large loaf with 6 large muffins instead of the four small loafs (working with what I had). I will make this again...soon.

I have made lots of zucchini bread and they are wonderful. But this one beats all with the blueberries. I did make it with 1 cup brown and 1cup white sugar. I love brown sugar. Thanks for a home run recipe!

Very good and easy Bread! I substituted the applesauce for the oil (did not do half and half) and the bread turned out great.

SOOOO YUMMY!!  I made this yesterday morning and just loved it!  I did use 2 eggs and 2 egg whites, 2/3 c unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 c canola oil.  I decided to cut down the sugar, only using about 1 cup (I usually find loaves and muffins have too much sugar especially when using wonderful fresh fruit with all of its natural sweetness).  We personally found this to be sweet enough the way I did it, but just a personal preference.  I was able to get 2 large loaves, one for the freezer, yahoo!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

We have made this recipe so many times and will continue to do so.  I do make changes each time and will continue to do so as cooking for me in an individualized moment-to-moment experience!  To make it healthier we use whole wheat flour, add some walnuts, cut the sugar in almost half and often times we use maple syrup instead.  We generally make it into muffins and ALWAYS add a yummy oatmeal & walnut streusel.  The great thing about this recipe is it is a versatile,fabulous foundation from which you can make it your own!

Very, very tasty.  I did make some changes but I'm sure the original recipe is even better.  I halved the recipe to make one loaf.  I used Egg Beaters for the eggs, 1/4 c. oil & 1/4 c. applesauce.  I used almost 1/2 c. sugar and almost 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I used about 1 1/2 c. shredded zucchini.  I used frozen blueberries.  I baked for about 1 hour 10 minutes.  It's very dense and a great flavor.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  Very low fat!

This was delicious when paired with a streusel topping before putting in the oven. My streusel had 2/3 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 stick of butter, handful of oats, sprinkle of cinnamon. Combined and sprinkled on top of the unbaked loaves. I also used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil, and half brown/half white sugar. Also, after greasing the pans, dust them with a cinnamon-sugar mixture for a yummy surprise. Delicious!!

Excellent! To lighten it up, I used all whole wheat flour, 3 egg whites (no yolks), unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 1 and 1/2 c splenda along with 2T Splenda brown sugar blend instead of sugar. Added 2 T almond meal (Trader Joes) and 1/2 of a very ripe banana mashed. Baked 12 muffins for 26 minutes. Delicious!!!!

This is really fabulous! I wanted to use up my zucchini but not in the usual way. This is so yummy! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, changing the pan size (I used 2 IKEA loaf pans.) I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, since we all LOVE cinnamon. I also used frozen blueberries, stirring them into the flour before adding it to the wet ingredients. No problem. You could change the recipe a bit to make it more healthy, but this was delicious!!!

Very good. I used a combo of wheat and almond flour and only used 1 cup sugar and added toasted pecans and made 24 muffins cooked at 350 for about 22 minutes.

amazing!  I live at high altitude, so I adjusted it a little for that by adding 2T additional of applesauce (I did half and half with oil and applesauce), left out 1T of sugar, and only did 3/4 tsp of baking powder.  I also baked it in 2 large loaf pans at 350 for 1 hr 10 minutes.  ETA:  Not even 24 hours after it came out of the oven, we are well into our second loaf!  This is very yummy!

6/17 - I have made this about 50 times. One thing that I do is grease the loaf pans with shortening and then 'dust' them with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I also coat the top with the cinnamon/sugar mixture. My high altitude alterations work every time.

Delicious -- very moist, good flavor, holds up well next day, and can can be made much healthier without it *tasting* healthier.

I replaced the 1 c veg oil with a cup of fresh apple sauce (just blended up 2 apples, peels on) and a splash of oil.
Decreased the 2 1/4 cup sugar to a bit over 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (taste the batter to get a sense) and will decrease the sugar some more next time.
Replaced the AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour

I also toss the blueberries in a bit of flour before adding them to help keep them distributed throughout the batter.

I baked them up as muffins in the same temp oven but obviously shorter time.

ADD BANANAS!! I made it as written and it was really good...made it a second time using most of the other tips, except used 2 mashed bananas for half of the oil.  Probably could've left out the oil though.  Excellent flavor and very moist!

MAKE THIS BREAD!  It is really awesome.  I make 2 regular loaves, takes about 1 hr. 10 min. to bake.  Remember to squeeze excess moisture out of the zucchini after you grate it. I eat it w/Whipped Philly.  I've made it for our neighbors and friends on occasion too and they just rave about it.

Excellent recipe - came out great.  I followed with a couple changes - used 1/2 oil & 1/2 applesauce.  I ended up using 5 small pans instead of 3 - I think that mine are "mini" loaf pans - not small...  Next time I will follow others advice - use a bit more sugar.

Yummy! My husband was upset when he saw this recipe- I had promised to make him zucchini bread, but I wanted to try this. I promised him the next batch would be regular zucchini bread. Well, after tasting it- he said not to make anything with our zucchini except this bread!! I myself was WOWED. I will be taking this to all our "bring something" get togethers. Can't wait to "show it off"!

One thing- I made it in 2 regular loaf pans. You have to cook for about 20 minutes longer. I also used frozen blueberries- no difference.I WILL use a crumb topping next time.

update: I used the crumb topping, and it was delish, but be warned- it makes the bread much heavier tasting. Mu husband says he prefers no crumb topping.

Wow! This is fabulous! I too had the skeptical husband...I am sure he thought I was wasting the fresh blueberries HE PICKED. I followed some of the suggestions and my changes were as follows:
Oil (used 3/4 cup applesauce 1/4 oil)
Sugar (used 3/4 cup brown sugar & 1/2 evaporated cane juice)
Flour (used 2 cups whole wheat & 1 cup white)
ADDED 1/4 cup ground flax seed
Doubled blueberries
Topped with the mix of cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, nutmeg.
Delicous and moist! 
Hubby had one warm piece out of the oven and then asked for more!

Delicious!  I did cut the sugar back to 1 c white and 1/4 c light brown, and made a mixture of the light brown sugar, flour and just a little bit of butter for a crumbly top as someone suggested.  I used whole wheat flour, and 2 larger loaf pans as opposed to the 4 minis.  Next time I will sub half oil for applesauce as some people did, and make muffins.  Definitely keeping this recipe! :)

Have a bumper crop of zucchini so this is a great way to use it. Very easy recipe and it's also a good way to get veggies into your kids w/o their knowing. Made it in 2 full size loaf pans and baked for 1hr + 15 mins. Cut the sugar back to 2 cups also as prev suggested. Would be very good w/nuts also.

It was...okay. Very sweet and moist. But overall lacking in flavor. It was just sweet. Since this doesn't appeal to my family, it was a miss. But I think that it will definately appeal to those with bigger sweet tooths than us.

This recipe would be great as written and I will definitely be making as written if I give these as gifts, but for our household, I chose to make 12 muffins and modified the recipe to make them healthier. The modifications were as follows:
Used a little less than 1 cup of the commercial Splenda/brown sugar mix (1/2 cup is equal to the sweetness of 1 full cup), used 3 cups of zucchini (squeezed of excess liquid), used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of nutri-flour (like normal all purpose flour but has a higher fiber content).  I also used 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. Finally, I used frozen blueberries and tossed them in flour before folding them into the mixed ingredients.  The muffins baked for around 40 minutes. These were great even with all the healthy modifications.

This recipe is great!! I made it the first time when my Dad's farm had an over abundance of zucchini. I was asked over and over to make more. I added a lemon glaze on top and the results were just spectacular.

This recipe is excellent, need to double recipe, it disappears fast. i substituted 1/2 of amount of sugar with brown sugar as suggested. Also, i substituted 1/2 amount of oil with applesauce. EXCELLENT IDEA mixing zucchini with blueberries.

So good and very easy!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it delivered a very moist, dense bread that is wonderful spread with a little cream cheese.  Also had a nice, crunchy top.  I came up with 5 mini-loaves, and finished one off for lunch as soon as it was out of the oven.  I'll definitely make again - should be great with any number of fruits.  Next I'll try apple.

This is so delicious!  I make it all the time and give it as gifts.  Makes a big batch!  I usually make them in 2 regular loaf pans instead of the mini loaves.  It's also very quick and easy to put together and stays fresh for days.

Yummy.... My daughter and I have already finished one mini loaf today. We used cinnamon and brown sugar Philadelphia Cream Cheese on the bread. VERY GOOD!

My finished product didn't actually rate 5 stars, but I messed up the recipe so much and it still came out pretty good, so I had to give it a good rating.  I substituted 1/2c the oil for 1/2 c vanilla yogurt, which was deliberate.  Then, I ran out of flour AND sugar so I just reduced the sugar by about 1/2 c and used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat.  Then, instead of mini loaves, I made two larger loaves, one of which was eaten immediately. I would definitely reduce the oil and sugar, but not mess around with the flour.

This recipe was very good.  My husband and 5 yr. old loved it.  I did cut the sugar by about 1/2 cup and think that next time I will reduce it some more.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  It is very sweet.  More like a dessert, but still very yummy.  I will definately use this recipe again!  Thanks Laujra.

Great summer quick bread!  Rated 4 vs 5, due to a few "personal" and "health conscious" modifications and suggestions from prior reviews.  Used 1/2 C oil and               1/2 applesauce, 3/4 C white sugar and   3/4 C brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 - 2 tsp cinnamon (family preference).
Mini loaves are perfect for gifts, brunch buffets or freezing.

OMG!! The other reviewers were right..it is out of this world!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I added an extra cup of zucchini ( because I have so much zucchini from garden right now) and I put the crumb topping on top ( from another reviewer. 3/4 c flour, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 Tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 stick butter, 1/2 c crushed walnuts) this just put it over the top.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used two full-sized loaf pans and made two loaves. I grated the zucchini and placed it on a clean kitchen towel and wrung as much moisture out of it as I could before adding it to the mix. Aside from that, which made the loaves lighter, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit. Oh, I baked it in my Sun Oven. Deeelicious!

Been making this since last summer.  I used thawed frozen blueberries since this is also a winter time treat and quality fresh blueberries are hard to find during the winter season. I also halved the cinnamon as a tablespoon seemed to overwhelm the recipe for my taste.  I serve it often to my men's prayer group as it is one of their favorites as well.

I've made this a few times and it's always great. It freezes well too; so it's great to make in the summer and freeze it for a winter treat. I do make it healthier by using 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c Apple sauce. I use 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 unbleached flour. I also just use 1 1/2 c sugar, sometimes I mix white and brown.  I don't mesure my zuchini, but use a medium one. I ran out of vanilla so I used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract. I like extra blueberries. And it was awesome!!! Depending on your tastes, the cinnamon may be too much. Be sure to Greece the pans well.

This reviewer added a crumb topping which I also added. Without the topping, I think the bread would have been a bit bland. Also, if the loaf sits a day or two it tastes even better so don't hesitate to make this recipe ahead of time. 
Next time I am  going to to try and and the crumb topping in the middle of the bread (pour 1/2 batter in loaf pan, add topping, pour second half batter in pan and add more topping! Love the topping. 
I made 24 of these loaves and froze most of them. They freeze very, very well and I think taste even better after being frozen.

Cut oil in ½ and replaced with ½ c applesauce; replaced ½ of white flour with whole wheat flour; replaced ½ of white sugar with brown sugar. Otherwise kept everything the same, took other user's recommendation and coated blueberries in flour before adding to mix. Delicious!!

Family approved! I used 3 cups of zucchini, 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown. I made muffins instead and baked for 25 minutes at 350. Yum! Great way to use up zucchini.

Whenever I make zucchini cakes, I put the zucchini in my cuisinart until shredded.  Put into containers and freeze it for later making cakes.  No need to drain.  Just use the amount you need and Whala!!!!  Great cakes!  I also freeze fresh parsley and basil from the garden.  Instant ingredients when you are in the mood to make something.

Absolutely delicious. I used less sugar and it is superb. I suggest less oil, the zucchini makes it so moist, it almost seems wet. But awesome.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice and it was great both times. I will make this recipe for my next office pot luck. I followed the recipe but I made just a few exceptions: 1stick of soften Butter insteadof 1cup of oil; 1cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 1/4 cups of white sugar;almond flavor instead of vanilla; added one well smashed bannana. WOW...Iit was AMAZING!!!!

So good, this will be my "go to" recipe now. Nice and moist but not too moist, I didn't get to try it warm but it is very good refridgerated. I did make two small changes though. First was I quickly found out that I apparently don't have ANY bread pans so I used a 13x9 glass baking dish (it would be great as muffins too), also instead of 2-1/4 cups of white sugar I used 2 cups and then sprinkled the top with about a 1/4c of brown sugar which I HIGHLY recommend (it gives it just that little bit of crunch that it needs). The recipe doesn't mention this but zucchini has a lot of liquid when you shred it so it needs to be drained or shredded right into a strainer over a bowl or something.

This recipe deserves the awesome rating it has!  Like a lot of other people, I made a few modifications.  First, I used frozen zucchini and blueberries from last summer (thawed).  Second, I used 1/2 and 1/2 white/whole wheat flour.  I also halved the sugar and used 1/2 and 1/2 applesauce and oil.  I made them into muffins, baked about 25 minutes at 350.  These were great just out of the oven and even better cold the next morning, which is rarely the case with muffins.  Stop reading reviews and try it!!!

This is my new fav for berry muffins...I use the recipe as above with reduced sugar and sub coconut oil and add walnuts and whatever berries I have, fresh or frozen. I have a large garden and chickens, and have found that I can freeze the oil, eggs and shredded zucchini together in a zip-loc bag at the high time of production and only have to add dry ingredients for quick muffins full of good garden stuff all through the winter. Cook muffins 25 minutes or so at 350.

We own a B&B and this has gotten rave reviews. The only thing I changed was I replaced half of the oil with applesauce. I also highly recommend you check out the Extreme Banana Bread and the Jewish coffee cake. Both are excellent, just not as good as this recipe. PS I can't stand zucchini but I LOVE this bread

This is *so* good.  I was grateful for this recipe when my zucchini was coming out of the garden in truckloads.  I told my son it was just "blueberry" bread (God forbid the child eat something green), and he scarfed this up like an animal.  I also substituted chocolate chips for the blueberries once for extra kid appeal, and that was (not surprisingly) also delicious.  One morning I decided to slice up one of these loaves and use it as french toast bread, and I had to keep the serving plate weighted down so it wouldn't float up to heaven.  Love, love, love this recipe!

Made this with frozen blueberries that I had on hand and it turned out great.  Nice combination blueberries and zucchini, would've never mixed the two.  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it again.

This bread is yummy. I did not change any ingredients.  Recipes states to lightly grease pan but doing this makes bread stick to bottom. Next time I will crease & flourvpan!

OMG!!!  Had an abundance of zucchini and blueberries were on sale.  Had a bridge game in the horizon and decided we girls deserved a treat.  And what a treat it was!  LAUJRA, your recipe is a great base.  Just about anything is possible.  After reading several reviews, I found Red Hat Milli's making it into a bundt cake -- what a great idea.  Using her comments along with others, my chances:  subbed 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup oil, used only 1 1/2 cups sugar, half my flour was whole wheat, and upped the baking powder to 1 tablespoon (misread the comment that said 3 tablespoons).  Almost cut back on the amount of cinnamon, but given the amount of dry ingredients decided to use the full amount.  Good decision.  Something to think about:  Beat the liquid ingredients with the sugar, and then fold in the dry ingredients until just well mixed.  You'll avoid a tough product that way, be it bread, cake or muffins.  There was just the perfect amount of sweetness and spice.  I had baked it the day before serving and stored it in on a cake server (the kind with the plate for the cake and a lid for the plate).  When I removed the lid before serving the aroma was enough to kill for.  Unfortunately, this is not as healthy as I would like.  Even with using healthier ingredients, the calories only shrinked to 339 calories (assuming 12 servings); but given bridge players and their very unhealthy eating habits, I won't be hesitant to serve this again.  Again, great recipe.

wonderful bread. Moist, and flavorful. I made mine into 4 mini loaves and they came out perfectly. They did require an extra 10 minutes baking time. I did substitute 1 cup of the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and used 2 cups of white sugar and the extra 1/4 cup I used brown sugar.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have mini loaf pans so I used two loaf pans and baked it 1 hour. Came out perfect.

Absolutely delicious.  I baked mine in a 9 x 13 pan for 50 minutes and will leave it in a little longer next time as the center wasn't quite as done as the rest.  But it's a very yummy recipe and moist.  And it stays moist for days after it's baked.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I have made this twice. We don't have mini-loaf pans.  So, I put it in 2 bread pans.  It is so good that my husband told me to not lose the recipe.  The only thing that I tweaked was reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup and cooking it longer since it takes longer in a regular bread pan.

It's hard to decide how many stars to give a recipe after you've tweaked it. But since I really didn't make any drastic changes, I'll give it 5 stars. I used half white and half brown sugar and also used half white and half wheat flour. I would have cut the oil down if I had applesauce but I'm happy to say that the bread was not greasy. I added chopped walnuts on top of one of the pans before baking. I was able to make 3 large loaves, only filling the pans up about halfway. I took a couple loaves to work and got some weird faces when I told my coworkers it was blueberry zucchini bread but as soon as they took a bite, their faces lit up. This was even a hit with a picky eater!

I absolutely love this recipe. I have a garden and am always looking for new zucchini recipes. I pre shred and freeze my zucchini so that I can make zucchini bread all year. This recipes was a great addition. Sometimes I make a lemon glaze to go on top...yum!

Excellent! The only change I made was adding more blueberries and a touch of maple syrup. I did also top with a buttery-cinnamon crumb topping. This is one of the moistest (Is that a word?) recipes so far. Freezes well.

I made the Blueberry Zucchini Bread this morning and it's delicious.  The only thing I did different is that I added a crumb topping made of 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/3 cukp of butter and 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  This was yummy!

I would give this 3 stars, but since my husband is on his 3rd slice from a large loaf pan I'll give it 5 stars! The bread itself is excellent, I'm just not crazy about the blueberries being in it - strictly a personal taste!

Okay, this is tremendous!  I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: I do not have mini loaf pans, so I used two regular sized ones, and baked for about 60 minutes.  And, while mixing I remembered I had one very ripe banana, so I added that in as well.  I do not notice any real banana flavor, but this has got to be the moistest bread I have ever had!  I mean, I have reviewed quite a few baked goods I have called "moist" but this is hands down the most moist of them all!  Very scrumptious!  I can see adding chocolate chips to this recipe...but then, I can see adding chocolate chips to just about anything.  And I think next time I may try a streusel type topping for something different.  Truly yummy as is, though, and thanks to Laujra for a terrific recipe :)

Absolutely fantastic.  I cut the ingredients in half for one loaf.  I've used fresh and frozen blueberries and didn't notice a difference.

I've made this a bunch of times now so I can comment on making it healthier.  First, if you use whole wheat flour, do half whole wheat and half white.  All whole wheat doesn't taste right.  You can get away with 2/3 whole wheat also.

Second, you can't really overdo the zucchini.  I always use one medium sized one and grate it.  If you want it to totally disappear in the bread, puree  it.  Otherwise you'll see little flecks in the bread.

Third, use applesauce instead of oil.  It tastes better, and doesn't get as soggy after a day or so.  It's also much healthier.

Finally, store it in the fridge.  It goes bad fast in the heat, and if you made it with whole wheat flour, it'll spoil even faster.  It's not as good cold but you can always zap it in the microwave for 15 seconds.

I started making this recipe and realized it called for 2 and a 1/4 cups of sugar.  Wow is that a tremendous amount of sugar.  I couldn't bear putting that much sugar down the family and so I tried it with only 1 cup of sugar.  It was delicious.  I also substituted  applesauce for half of the oil.  Still has a lot of calories, but it makes for a nice treat for the family.

This was great!!! My family didn't even know that the zucchini was hidden inside. What a great way to sneak in some veggies. I made this recipe as is, but would like to decrease the sugar some for our taste preferences. I will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I subbed 1/3 whole wheat flour (1 cup whole wheat, 2 cups all purpose) and I used a recommendation to sub 1/4 cup brown sugar with 2 cups white.  I also used 3/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup, but didn't have applesauce like some recommended.  I had enough batter for one large loaf and about 12 muffins.  This came out pretty good!

Have had this recipe saved for a long time - finally made it.  And, so glad that I did!  Delish!  Cut back the oil by 1/4 cup and cut the sugar by 1/2 and it came out perfect!  Blueberries are the star - my fam didn't even look for the zucchini.  :-)

A. Maz. Ing.   This bread is incredible. I tripled the recipe, and it was enjoyed by my kids and their swim team, my hubby and his National Guard friends, my 'breakfast friends' at work, and more people at a swim meet. I will make this again, for sure!

These JUST came out of the oven!  OMG they are amazing!  I made jumbo muffins and it made 20 of them.  Because of dietary issues I changed the oil to 1/4 c and then used 3/4 c applesauce, used whole wheat flour, 1/2 agave syrup and 1/2 splenda, and put a tiny bit of fresh lemon juice in!  I will make these again and again!  VERY YUMMY!

This is really, really good.  My husband and I can barely keep ourselves from eating it all at one time. Just make sure you squeeze any water out of the zucchini.

Superb recipe!  I decreased the oven temp to 325 and made muffins.  Only took 30 to cook.  I did use whole wheat flour instead of white.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made 2 larger loafs instead of 4 small ones.  It was delicious.  My husband and kids who hate zucchini loved it.  The blueberries were the best part.  YUM!  I'll definitely make this for my family again and maybe even give a loaf as a gift.  Loved it!

We have an abundance of zuchinni and blueberry in our garden this year. I did make one modification. Instead of one cup of oil, I used one cup of plain yogurt. It came out really well. I didn't tell my husband I did this and he devoured half the loaf before I could mention it.  I can definitely tell that there is a lot of sugar in this. So, maybe next time I will cut it back the sugar too. But saving this recipe so that we can make it again. YUM!

Easy and delicious. More like a cake :-) Similar in texture and sweetness to banana bread. I did as another reviewer suggested and mixed together 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon white sugar and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and I sprinkled it in the loaf pans prior to pouring in the batter.

I have made these multiple times and even taken them to a bake sale. I have had a couple people ask me for the recipe too. So yummy. I don't have mini loaf pans so I use muffin tins instead. This recipe makes about 2 1/2 dozen muffins.

I altered this to make lemon zucchini bread. I added the zest of a lemon, as well as the juice. Then I added half of the vanilla and replaced the other half with lemon extract. I also replaced the cinnamon with half nutmeg and half ground ginger. Finally, i used whole wheat flour and added ground flax to make it a little healthier. SOOOOO good!

My family loves this bread! I boost the nutrition by replacing 2/3 of the oil with applesauce and 1/2 the flour with whole wheat. The addition of the applesauce also allows me to cut the sugar to 2 cups without losing any sweetness. I went with the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 brown sugar for the sugar.

This was amazing!! I followed some others' advice and added half oil and half applesauce and decreased the sugar just a tad. Someone else also recommended putting a little dusting of spices and sugar on the bottom of the pan, and I also did that, which seemed to add a nice touch. This is the most delicious bread ever!! I'm giving a couple of loaves to my kids' teachers, too...it's too good not to share! :)

I took other reviewers' suggestions and did 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I also cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  These were pretty sweet so I think the original amount would be really excessive.
They were great!  I made 20 muffins.  They taste like blueberry muffins with some extra spices.

Sooo good...I make these exactly as the recipe states, which is rare for me.  They are delicious without being too sweet.  

I can actually get enough for 5 mini loaves from this recipe, instead of the 4 that it states.

Lovely recipe.  Moist and very tasty.  Definitely be making again. Used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil.  Also used only 2 cups sugar (1.5 white and .5 brown sugar). Thanks for sharing....

Great recipe!  Added chopped walnuts (about a cup) and a crumble topping (basic, flour/brown sugar/butter).  For anyone else wondering about the mini-loaf thing: it filled 6 of mine, which is the equivalent of 2 standard-sized loaves.  I baked them for 43 minutes total and they turned out great.  I'll also grease & flour my next pans (though they were non-stick).  I just Pam'd these and removal was tricky -- blueberries, once baked, become sticky to get out of the pan.  Wonderful gifts for neighbors for the holiday-tween times though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! Used 1/2 applesauce , 1/2 oil and made a crumb topping out of flour, brown sugar, raw sugar, cinnamon and a bit of butter. The blueberries are the best part! Don't skimp!

Wasn't quite sure what to expect but this recipe was easy and tasty.  I used pear essence instead of vanilla and I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I doubled the baking powder and added a pinch pumpkin pie spice.  I added a oatmeal crumble topping. Very pleased with this recipe.

Excellent recipe. I only made two changes, I used 2 cups of sugar and halved the flour with whole wheat flour. My mini loaves took 1 hour to cook.  Really yummy and I am excited to have these and make again.

a bit bland. A streusel topping would really make this sing.  But my husband likes sweets that aren't too sweet ( I know right?)  and he ate 3 muffins within 10 min of them coming out of the oven.  So this will definitely become a "go to."  Very moist and if you peel the zucchini I'd guess no one would suspect there are 2 cups of veggies in this delish treat!

I loved this bread. I used wheat flour only. I didn't have a grinder, so I stuck the zucchini in the magic bullet. It turned into a paste, but yummy all the same!

I made 2 batches... both were made with 1/2 whole wheat flour... 1 batch I added a cup of chopped walnuts into batter with the blueberries, then sprinkled some on top before baking... 2nd batch, I replaced the blueberries for chocolate chips. Baked both batches in jumbo muffin pan for 45 minutes. They turned out wonderful. I will definitely make them again.

A big hit!  I made mine a little healthier by using applesauce instead of the oil, 1/2 whole wheat flour, added ground flax seed, and cut down the sugar by half.  Turned out great!  I made several and froze them for later.

This bread is delicious. I only use one cup of sugar and it is still very good. My kids ask for it NON STOP!

This is the best bread EVER!!! I've made this 4 times in 2 weeks. I made it per recipe and with changes for lower calorie and u can't tell the difference. Used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda. You can make it in the 4 minis but I like 3 disposable aluminum ones or 1 regular and one smaller (to give away.) Bake time was one hour with above. Gave some to husbands friend and he called next day just to say how good it was, gave some to 2 gfs and both texted me same day. Made some for guy party with rave reviews!

Made some changes.  Substituted the 1 c. oil for 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce. Substituted 2 1/4 c. sugar with 2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  Everything else stayed the same for the bread, plus added extra blueberries because I have no clue what a pint looks like, so I am sure I over compensated for my lack of knowledge!  In the pan before adding the mixture, I greased it and put in a mixture of 1 tsp each of cinnamon, sugar, and brown sugar and a 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Shook it around like flour.  And I made a crumb topping with 1/4 each of oatmeal, sugar, and flour, a tsp. of cinnamon, and a few tbs. of butter to make it crumbly, sprinkled on top and put in the oven.  I also made it in 2 large loaf pans and bakes for 1 hour 20 minutes.  Came out perfect.  This was my first Zucchini bread ever, and I just took off what 5 other reviews said and put it all in one.  Turned out SO GREAT!!!!  Can't wait to share it with the family and then next time figure how to make it healthier!

I loved this bread and so did my family. The first time I made it I followed the recipe. The second time I made it I used 1/2 the oil and used applesauce in its place. I thought that it turned out great and with less the fat.

I am gluten intolerant, and I changed this recipe to my gluten-free all purpose flour with 1 1/2 tsp xantam gum added. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 tsp nutmeg. Remainder of ingredients used as listed. I baked it for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degress. This cake came out moist and flavorful. Baking gluten free is not easy and this recipe came out Fabulous. Even my gluten eating family loved it!

I love this recipe, so different than the usual zucchini recipes. I wanted to use up some frozen rhubarb, so I substituted it for the blueberries. I tossed them with 1/3 c brown sugar to downplay the tartness and then in 1/3 c flour to prevent them from sinking. It turned out amazing, but there was not a hint of tartness, so I may cut down the brown sugar next time to give a little zing.

I made this bread about an hour ago.  This bread was delicious.  My whole family loved it, even my picky 3 year old son liked it and went back for seconds.  It was very moist, and very yummy.  Thank you for the chance to make something different for my family.

This recipe was SO good!  Followed recipe pretty closely with the exception of cutting back to 2 cups of sugar (which was plenty) and used more like 2 1/2 cups of shredded zucchini as I wanted to use up what I had.  I only had 2 regular sized loaf pans, so I increased the baking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes. This was SO moist and flavorful...my husband is hoping I don't give the 2nd loaf away!!!  Will certainly be making again!

Summer Perfect! I added chopped pecans and topped off the loafs with a Strudel topping as follows:
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter
This receipe surpasses all other zucchini bread receipes for sure.

It tasted like it was missing something. Great texture. Would've been very bland without the sweetness of the blueberries.

I made exactly as stated, except I put into 2 regular loaf pans instead of 4 small loaf pans. I wasn't sure how long to bake, so I just kept testing with a toothpick. Took about 15 extra minutes. They were delicious! The blueberries added just the right amount of zing. I will make again, trying in muffin cups so I have more control over serving size. YUM!!!

I made this for a house full of relatives and just about everyone asked for the recipe.  I used fresh wild blueberries and zucchini from my garden and followed the recipe as written the first time and it was excellent.  The second time I used a crumb topping as another reviewer suggested and used half white sugar and half brown sugar and it was even better!

I just made this super moist and tasty- and a great way to use freshly picked blueberries and those giant zucchinis from the garden.  

I made some changes: I added amaretto liquor, and cut back the vanilla.  I also added nutmeg and allspice, to make a more spicy bread.  And I used Earth Balance instead of the vege oil.  Finally, I added a simple strudel to the top made from flour, earth balance, brown sugar and cinnamon.  This kicked it up a notch.  Yum.

This recipe is amazing!  I went to a local farm and got fresh blueberries and zuchhini.  I really enjoyed this.  Only thing I would change next time is the amount of cinnamon - if you like it and are not allergic the recipe is fine as is but can be reduced or omitted.  So tasty and delicious.

Fantastic recipe.  I cut down the sugar and added applesauce instead of half of the oil.  Does not taste like it is missing anything!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! My husband, our son, our friends, and co-workers LOVED it! Very moist, yet semi-crispy around the edges. I had to play around with the timing and temperatures because my oven cooks hotter than most, but once it was ready to eat that didn't even matter! Will definitely be making this again. I'm even going to try other ingredients in the bread mixture!

Made this today according to directions. Vi thought it was average, but my kids (7 & 2) thought it was the best!  Hubby gave it 4 stars.  Easy to make; I used a food processor to grate the zucchini.  A nice way to use up some of the garden's zucchini!

I LOVE this bread! Another option in using my zucchini harvert! I followed the recipe just as printed. I only added a sprinkle of cinnamon-sugar on top of the batter before baking. This gave the bread a crunchy topping and additional cinnamon flavor, which I love!

Made exactly according to recipe, but baked in 2 large loaf pans for 1 hour 10 minutes at 350 degrees and it turned out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing!
UPDATE: Try substituting 1 teaspoon of the vanilla with almond extract.  Delicious!

I was so disappointed with this recipe after all these glowing reviews. It's a pretty bland bread when you consider all the calories. Wasn't bad,just not delicious. BTW, for those having trouble getting their bread out of the pan, mine came right out with a spray of Vegalene.

For me, the oil gives it an off taste and isn't worth the calories. Perhaps if I used an expensive nut oil or butter, it would have been better. Otherwise, it comes out nice and moist. I can see how some of the additional ingredients some reviewers used like lemon and butter, would make it better but I won't be making this again.

I had a ton of zucchini from my garden and had to find new recipes.  Absolutely loved this one.  The bread was so amazingly moist and tasted great. Will definitely make again. It's a keeper.

Delicious moist bread. I replaced half the oil with applesauce. Next time I may add more cinnamon just because I love the flavor. Great way to use up your zucchini in a fabulous recipe.

What a great recipe.  The other night I wanted to bake something and couldn't decide if I wanted to bake with blueberries or zucchini as I had just picked both.  So I went searching on this site and found this recipe that uses both ingredients.  It was the best thing I could have done.  I made it in 2 reg. loaf pans and baked for 1 hr. 20 min.  I kept one loaf for us and sent one to a relative.  My husband was upset that I gave away a loaf.  So I made the recipe again and this time I made 24 muffins, topped with brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Brought some to work and they were a big hit.  Would recommend this recipe 100%.

I have made this twice.  The first time I used Pam and the second time I used Crisco shortening to grease the pans.  Although the flavor is good, both times only the top half of the loaf came out of the pan.  If you are looking for something to give as a gift, this is not the one.

I made this with my garden zucchini.  Our family had a swim party and cook out.  I could not cut the bread fast enough.. Needless to say, I am making several more today(they all want one).  I followed cookiequeen and added the crumb topping.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

I really liked this recipe and did as one reviewer suggested and did two regular loaves at 1 hr 30 min @ 350.  I miss calculated the blueberries and only used 1/2 a pint, and turned out fine.  Next time I think I will cut down the sugar to about 2 cups or a little less.  It is tasty, but really sweet.

The amount of oil makes this a very moist bread and the amount of sugar gives it a tasty crust.  Very good and the kids loved it! However, this is not guilt free if you are looking for something healthy.

I did all whole wheat, did 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce, reduced sugar to 1 cup (and still thought it was plenty sweet - i can't imagine how sweet it'd be with all that sugar).  My zucchini and blueberries were both frozen.  This was a very delicious recipe!

This was a fabulous way to use up the ton of zucchini that was shared with me. I also got a great deal on blueberries, so went looking for a recipe that used both. Sooooo glad I found this. My husband and kids loved it. I made it as bread and as muffins. They were great for school snacks, breakfast, after school snacks, and as a side with chili. I probably made at least six loaves worth! Too bad I'm out of zucchini, or I'd be making more now!

I have had rave reviews from family and friends on this bread.  I have topped it with a streusel topping and loved it.  I have also sprinkled it with raw sugar to give it an added crunch on the outside, it was fantastic.

Wonderful! Excellent taste & easy to make. I only used 2 cups of sugar and baked in two 9x5 loaf pans for about 1 hr and 15 minutes. Next time I think I might double the blueberry! My husband didn't even know there was zucchini in there. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an awesome recipe and was very easy to make!! I didn't change one thing from the ingredients. I baked the bread into muffins instead of loaves. Delicious and moist!! I made them for Thanksgiving and they were a hit.

This is one of my favorite breads.  It is very moist and wonderfully flavorful.  Great way to use up blueberries!  We make this several times each summer.  Also bakes well as muffins!

Wonderful!  Add brown sugar crumble on top for crunch.

I loved this recipe!  I made two loaves and had to take them to work, otherwise I would have eaten them both!  I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesaucse and 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour.  Very moist bread.  Will definitely make again!

Really good. Switched the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1 cup white. Added a few more blueberries that what was called for...wanted to use up what I had. This was a big crowd pleaser.

This is a great recipe! I took the advice of others and used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2 but I think maybe 2 would have been enough..but that's just my taste. This went over great with the family. I also used applesauce in place of half the oil. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this bread 5 times now. I make it in the bread maker and typically have to finish off in the oven on low for 10 minutes to cook the middle. I add 1/2 of the sugar, use canola oil, whole wheat flour, and thawed frozen blueberries. Comes out great!

I made this for my 1 year old, so I followed some of the other reviews to make it a little healthier.  I substituted 1/2 of the oil for applesauce, and use 1/3 wheat flour.  Also, I cut the recipe in half and it made 9 muffins (baked at 350 for 25 min).    It was delicious and even my husband who said he wouldn't eat a "vegetable" muffin loved it!

Possibly the best zucchini bread I've had! The blueberries add such a nice, moist touch and I don't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy zucchini bread without them now. I cut back on the sugar and will cut it back further to about 1 1/2 cups next time; also like others used half oil half applesauce and 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour. I made two regular size loafs and they cooked in just under one hour. I froze one loaf and it was just as good a week later.

Delicious! I too baked the batter in two large load pans and then topped the batter with a sugar, brown sugar, butter, and flour mixture (butter crumbs). Yummy!

As per others' recommendations, "healthed" it up a bit - half oil half unsweetened applesauce, raw sugar instead of white, whole wheat flour and egg substitute.  Made it in a bundt pan and it was very dense so it needed longer to bake, about 1 1/4 hours.  SOOOOOOOOO yummy!  Thanks, this is a keeper!

SO delicious. I cut the recipe in half and made one loaf out of it. I used a normal-sized loaf pan. It popped nicely, but did take over an hour to cook. I was worried about the cooking time, but it was unbelievably moist and bursting with blueberries. My husband seemed freaked out about having zucchini in there. We were fighting over the pieces!!

Wonderful recipe!!!! The amount of sugar used seems excessive so I may cut back on it next time, but the bread is delicious! My mother-in-law called to thank me for her loaf and said it was one of the best she'd ever tasted. :)

This recipe is a keeper!  Used my Pampered Chef stoneware mini-loaf baker and the recipe was perfect for the pan.  (Had to bake an extra 10 minutes)  Very moist and not too sweet.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Great way to use some zuccini from the garden during the height of blueberry season in CT.  Everybody loves this recipe and I will make it again.

This was excellent. I did use the recipe alterations that cookiequeen had in her review. I doubled the batch with the additions from cookiequeen and the batter was enough for three lg. loafs and 4 mini loafs. They were in the oven for 1hr 30 min. before the knife came out clean. The mini loafs were done in an hour. I,m glad I found this recipe. I grated 6 cups of Zuchini from my huge zuchini and that was only about a third of it. My husband wants me to make more bread with the rest of it. So I best get busy.

Delicious. I did make a crumb topping(minus the nuts) as directed in lanaiah's review & it was scrumptious. I made them in 7in loaf pans and got 3 gorgeous loafs.

Delicious! I followed a couple recommendations and replaced 1/2 the oil with apple sauce, and it was still moist. It's a little sweet, so probably could reduce the sugar a bit. This made 3 of the 4.5" x 8.625" foil loaf pans for me. Make sure you only fill 2/3 full, because they do rise. Took 70 minutes in my toaster oven.  I didn't see this mentioned earlier, but you shred the zucchini with the skin on. I used a cheese grater, and it worked perfectly. Two 6-inch zucchinis make the 2 cups. You can freeze after shredding to have some on hand all the time.

This is really good -- the only change I would make is next time using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white!  The blueberries make it a bit tart, but so good!

This was the most delicious homemade bread EVER! I kept everything the same except I substituted half the oil for applesauce and used canola oil for the other half rather than vegetable oil. Also used half unbleached flour, half whole wheat flour. So incredibly moist! I had enough mix to fill five mini loaf pans and didn't need to cook any longer than instructed, they were perfect. Best right out of the oven with some butter, YUM!

Yummy!  Next time I will use three cups of zucchini, though.  I made two large loaves, baked for 1:10.  Used a little under 2 cups of sugar and did half oil and half applesauce.

I followed some other's advice and used whole wheat flour.  My husband really likes the bread, but I think the whole wheat flour makes it very dense and heavy.  I'm not giving up on the recipe, but I think next time, I'll try with half and half whole wheat and all purpose flour.  I'd also like to give the applesauce in place of the oil a try.   Thanks for the recipe!

Sweet, moist & tart.  Yum!  Made a few changes to make it a tad bit healthier.  First I used whole wheat flour, replaced the sugar with splenda and I added only half the oil, replacing the other half with chunky applesauce.  Divided the batter between two 9x5 loaf pans and baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Amazing.  I'm taking this to work tomorrow to share with my office.

Excellent and delicious.  I made this exactly as written and it came out perfect.  Next time I'll use half applesauce and half oil, just to cut down on some of the calories.  Thank you for a great zucchini bread recipe.

This recipe was delicious although I changed it a bit. Instead of vegetable oil I used unsweetened apple sauce. I also subbed half of the sugar with splenda and used bread flour instead of white flour. It turned out amazing. So yummy and the kids don't even realize they are eating veggies. I can't wait to make it again.

Delightful recipe!  I made muffins and mini-muffins with this.  Light, moist, yum!  I used coconut oil and cut the sugar to 2 cups. 1 C brown and 1 C white/splenda mixed.  VERY tasty!

This recipe is delish and very easy to make! Does not feel heavy its a light healthy treat.  I substituted 1/2 applesauce for oil, added one cup extra blueberries and added 1/2 cup of flaxseed meal and they came out wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this bread twice and both times the reviews have been phenomenal.  The first time I made this, the two loaves I made were gone within an hour. The second time, I froze some of the bread to save for Memorial Day. People loved it.

I love this bread.  I was a bit skeptical of the blueberry/zucchini flavor combination, but it is wonderful.  I do cut the oil in half and use applesauce.  I also bake all of my quick breads in mini-loaf pans so they cook evenly and it is also nice to be able to keep a few and give a few away.  This makes about 5-6 mini loaves.  Wonderful!

I used some of the other suggestions- I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, 3 C zucchini, 2 C sugar and a bit fewer blueberries. This was delish! I made a crumb topping with equal parts  (about 1/3 cup) oatmeal and flour, 3 T brown sugar and 1 T vanilla sugar. I made one large loaf and it took about 1 1/2 hours in a 350 oven. YUM!

I personally prefer this recipe over the traditional zucchini bread since I love blueberries.  Sweet without being too sweet.  I've saved this one and I make it several times a year and it freezes well.

Awesome!! I halved the recipe and made it as muffins, baking for 30 minutes. They were delicious and the texture was perfect... the recipe itself is perfect! This would also be wonderful with raisins in place of the blueberries. Wonderful recipe... thank you! =)

This is a really wonderful moist bread. I followed the recipe except I used frozen blueberries (slightly thawed, rinsed, & drained.) I made it into 2 regular size loaf pans, since I don't own any mini loaf pans. My husband thought zucchini and blueberry together didn't sound very good together, but after tasting it said I should make a loaf for him to share with his co-workers. I did add a crumble mixture to the top also because my family loves breads that way. I used a mixture of oats, flour, cinnamon, chopped walnuts, and a little brown sugar and butter. My mother-in-law also really enjoyed this. Will make again!

Sooooo good. Thanks!!! Tom thanks you too!! xox" I'll take that kind of response anyday!

Love this recipe as is.  I have made it 4 times now.  The last time I used 1/2 the oil with 1/2 c applesauce.  Still terrific.  My family can't get enough.

This bread was a HIT with my entire family and everyone at my work!  I have never gotten a reaction quite like it when I told everyone it was zucchini!  So easy and quick to make, although it took 1 hour, 15 minutes to bake rather than the 50 minutes suggested in the recipe.  I also used 2 cups of packed zucchini though, so perhaps that's why.  Regardless, this recipe will become a staple in my kitchen!

Absolutely delicious!   I also made this in two regular size metal loaf pans, but in my electric oven I baked them 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Next time, I would check on them after 60 min. (max baking time would be 70 min.).  Only change I made was half white sugar, half brown sugar as others suggested.  It was excellent!  My personal opinion, its even better the second day.  A keeper!!!

very good recipe. I used half white half brown sugar, half regular and half whole wheat flour and instead of blueberries, I used 2 cups of frozen cranberries which I always have on hand. The sweetness of the bread was balanced by the tartness of the cranberries. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful-I'm hooked on zucchini!  Used 1C whole wheat/2C all-purpose & 2 cups frozen blueberries in 2 mini-loaf pans and one 8.5 X 4.5 pan.  My kids & I inhaled 1 whole loaf in 1 day.  Also enjoyed the zucchini-chocolate chip muffins recipe on this site (double the recipe & increase the choc. chips if you try that one!)

Delicious!  I used 1 1/2 cup all-purpose, 1 cup oat and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour,  1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  I made in one large loaf pan and baked for about an hour total, doing a toothpick test until done.  Since I reduced the overall sugar, I ended up with a less sweet bread, which was what I was hoping for - you could certainly used the recommended amount of sugar if you like it sweet.  Also, I like others' recommendations of subbing a little brown sugar - makes for a slightly crunchy crust.

I used the suggested healthy substitutions (1/2 unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 whole wheat, reduced the sugar) and made these into muffins, and they turned out wonderfully! I put half in the freezer for enjoying later.

I wanted to add milled flax seed to this and forgot so I spooned about a teaspoon on top of the batter (I made muffins)and this fooled the brain into thinking this was an added sweet crunch. Thanks so much for submitting this great recipe!

Excellent! I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for half of the veg oil. I also increased the baking soda to 2 tsp to make it less dense. Made 6 giant muffins (baked for 40 minutes) and 1 regular loaf bread (50 minutes). Will make again. Thanks!

Absolutely the most moist and luscious quick bread I have had in years. Went through 2 loaves in minutes!! I didn't have any mini loaf pans but I did have 2 regular size loaf pans. They baked beautifully with the directions given. This is a keeper. Yes, definitely drain or squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini before adding!!!

What a great change of pace from the standard Zucchini Bread.  And a great way to use those fresh picked blueberries.  We loved this recipe and will make every year.  Great for breakfast and freezes well.

Two words: lemon zest!!! It's brilliant. I omitted the cinnamon and cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup, down to two cups. Made muffins (25 minutes) and one regular sized loaf (60 minutes). Great recipe. Hubby and three young kids loved it!

This was great bread but I made it with cherries instead of blueberries.  Used half applesauce, half oil & whole wheat flower instead of white.  Also cut down on the sugar by 1/4 of cup & used half brown sugar.  Lots of changes healthy changes but it was great!

My husband says this is the best thing I've ever made for him, and I make a mean chocolate cake.  I did less sugar, 1/2 applesauce and oil, and crumb topping like some others.  325 convection for 55 minutes for two large loaves.

Very yummy and moist - even better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed applesauce for 1/2 the oil and used 1 c br sugar with 1 c white sugar. Also added sugar on top just before baking for a crispy top and it is delicious!

This was great! I had a GIANT zucchini, so I doubled the recipe and made four regular size bread loaves (and still had enough to make a week of zucchini baby food!!). They did take significantly longer to cook full-size, which threw me at first. Yummy and looks so pretty! Thanks for the recipe!

This was better than I expected. Yum! I followed the recipe almost exactly: I  substituted some apple sauce for a portion of the oil. Because of what I had on hand, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour, and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar (and I decreased the total amount of sugar used).  I made one normal-sized loaf, and some muffins. I made a crumb topping (oats, brown sugar, corn meal, flour and margarine) for the muffins. So good!

Instead of making in suggested mini tins, I used the 9x5 loaf pans and baked 40 minutes but thought this recipe called for way too much sugar and would make again using only 1-3/4 cups of sugar.

Very tasty, moist and hardy.  I added a small box of raisins and split the sugar between brown and white and only added 2 cups of sugar since the berries are so very sweet this time of the year.  Will definitely make again, it's a keeper.

Everyone in the family loved this!  I did not make any changes except I used two large loaf pans instead of the mini ones.  One of the loafs was all gone within an hour my husband had started on the second!  Awesome recipe!

I rarely add a rating - but I definitely give this one 5 stars.  Great use of both the zucchini and blueberries. Everyone in the family loved it!

Yummy!  I will surely make this again. I decided to make this today because I had some zucchini and blueberries that I needed to use.   I took some of the advice from other reviewers and used 2 C. white sugar and 1/4 C. brown sugar; 1/2 C. oil and 1/2 C. applesauce; and 2 C. all-purpose flour and 1 C. wheat flour.  I almost forgot about the topping:  1/2 C. brown sugar and 1/2 C. white sugar and a stick of butter.  I waited to put the topping on until there was about 20 minutes left.  My four mini loaves were done after 45 minutes.

I'm a fan.  Very moist, and almost kind of eggy, but awesome if you keep them refrigerated.  I made muffins and used applesauce in place of the oil.  Also decreased the total amount of sugar to closer to 1 1/2 cups (maybe a little more) and substituted about 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of white.  Really yummy - good way to use up zucchini and get a healthy muffin.  We ate the first batch in just about a week, so I must make more today!

Made these over the weekend. Had fresh blueberries & zucchini to use from my CSA. I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful these were. Easy to make too! The cinnamon and berries were just fantastic. The recipe makes a lot of yoummy bread.

My kids love this bread!!I only make some simple changes...use a mixture of whole wheat and white flour. Substituted applesauce for the oil and decreased the sugar to 1 cup and it is still plenty sweet enough. This bread goes fast at my house!!

Moist, tasty, and healthfully adaptable!  I used applesauce + 1 T. oil, 1/2 white ww and 1/2 ww pastry flour, banana and flax instead of the eggs, and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  It was plenty sweet, and next time I would reduce the sugar even more.  I also cooked it in two regular size loaf pans for about 50 minutes.

YUM! YUM! Double triple dog YUM! Recipe is easy to assemble, forgiving, and chock full of moisture and berries.  Like most others that made this recipe I tweaked it suit my needs by adding two small bananas and cutting oil in half.  For some reason I had enough for five mini pans (banana addage?) and the cooking time was increased slightly by five to seven mins.  I would definitely make these again!

This is one of the best quick bread recipes I have tried.  I changed a couple of things to make it a bit more healthy.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups, and I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  Very very yummy...even my 2-year old loves it!

This recipe is so YUM! I cut back the sugar to less than two cups,used half the oil and replaced the other half with applesauce. Made a crumb topping and used two loaf pans, which of course took a bit longer to bake. So delicious and thank you!

This was a good recipe, but I decided to add a basic oatmeal crumb topping which I thought really improved it. This is a great breakfast bread.

I did make a bunch of changes to this recipe (adding lemon, subbing yogurt for oil, drizzling with a lemon sauce) so my review isn't of the initial recipe, but my outcome was AMAZING.

This bread is FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe as written...didn't change any of the ingredients.  The only thing I did differently was used 2 regular sized bread pans, instead of the 4 mini loaf pans.

My garden has exploded with zucchini, so I was searching for recipes and came upon this one & boy am I glad I did!  This bread is beyond delicious!  It won't last long here with my 2 teenagers.  Will definitely be making this again & again...

Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME!  to make this more health conscious, I substituted a few things.....
1 1/2 c. spelt flour and 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose flour
Splenda instead of white sugar
and I also added a 1/2 cup walnuts
A complete meal; you have your veggie, fruit, whole grains and protein!

This is my new favorite recipe.  I tried it in 2 large pans but didn't get the same results; 4 small pans - perfect!  I plan to share it with everyone.  A delicious way to use up some of that zucchini, and the blueberries make it better.  So glad I found this - thanks.

I made muffins as one of the previous reviewers mentioned  I used most of the other ideas for lowering calories.  Everyone loved them.  Unfortunately I was half into the recipe and realized I didn't applesauce.  I happened to find a can of lite cherry pie filling so I used some of that instead and reduced the sugar even more.  They were scrumptious.  I'm making them again with unsweetened applesauce.

When I made this bread I used a big bread pan instead of mini pans. It took over an hour and a half to bake in the oven (and at times it had me very worried) but it turned out great! The top was burnt a bit, but the rest of the bread was perfect. Will definately make it again!

UPDATE---We also made it a second time instead using rapberries ---absolutely heavenly!----

OUTSTANDING!!!!  Just took 4 loaves out of the oven.  My kids devoured a loaf in 5 minutes.  I also substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce, and used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 c., and will probably cut it down to 1 1/4 c next time  (the taste was good, just trying to eliminate unnecessary sugar for my family).  We just ran to the store for more blueberries.  I hope the bread freezes well.

I really wanted this to be good since I love Zucchini Bread and I love blueberry muffins, but it just tasted kind of strange to me like the flavors didn't mesh.  Maybe it was the cinnamon taste with the blueberries.  Not horrible, but not great.

This combination is great!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and added 1 tsp. of almond extract.

Oh so yummy.  I used 1/2 Tablespoon of  extra cinnimon and after greasing the pans sprinkled them with cinnimon and sugar, like you would sprinkle toast with.  Also works well with half applesauce and half oil and frozen blueberries.

What a great sweet bread!! All I had was frozen blueberries and frozen shredded zucchini. I drained the zucchini once it defrosted, but did not drain the blueberries. When I made this for my family they could not tell that there was zucchini in the bread! I topped it all of with a cinnamon cream cheese glaze. Thanks so much for the recipe, this is a keeper.

Excellent bread - I doubled the recipe, froze several loaves and got requests for more. I did as several posters suggested and cut back on the sugar a bit and made it half white, half brown sugar. I'm making it again this morning!

This recipie was wonderful!  I made a small variation to the recipie; I used 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil instead of a full cup of oil.  I also used blueberries that had been frozen.  It was delicious and made 2 full size loaves although the cooking time was a bit longer than it would be for smaller loaves.  All in all, this recipie is a definate keeper!

WONDERFUL!!!  I do agree with a few others that the sugar could be increased a bit, and I will probably add more zucchini next time.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I never would have thought of the blueberry zucchini combo, but it's delicious. Following the other's suggestions I did half oil and half applesauce, decreased the sugar - and added the zest of 1 lemon. Fantastic! I baked this as 24 muffins for 25 minutes. I have more zucchini so I'll be making these again.

Absolutely loved this!  I baked in a bundt pan for 50 minutes and it turned out great.  Threw away a little of the batter, but could have made a few muffins with it.  Made some substitutions for health - replaced 1/2 of oil with no sugar added applesauce, replaced 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour, only used 1 3/4 cups sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Looks very appetizing with the blueberries.  Used fresh.  Will definitely make again!

This bread is really moist.  The blueberries are a great addition to ordinary zucchini bread.  I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour (2 cups whole wheat) and I used honey in place of the sugar.  I also added dried cranberries.  It was delicious.  Received many compliments on this bread.

I made this bread today, after getting a  BUNCH of zucchini at the farmer's market. I was a little short on blueberries, I only had about a cup and a half. I added a bit more cinnamon because we love it. This bread was fabulous. It's going in my recipe box!

I forgot to rate this when I made it but it was very delicious. I always use half white four, half whole wheat to add some fiber. I also add two tablespoons flax seed to up fiber and make it healthier, and replace half the fat with applesauce. No one notices the difference and it makes it a bit healthier!!

I have zucchini coming out of my ears, so I came across this bread in my quest to make every possible recipe out of the stuff.  I'm glad I did and so is my entire extended family and neighborhood! I put it in two regular loaf pans and add more berries than called for. Yummmmm!

I modified this recipe a bit, I had fresh saskatoon berries, so I replaced the blueberries with those, and I made them into muffins. I brought half the batch to work, and they vanished so quick, everyone keeps asking me what I'm bringing next!! This is a great recipe for zucchini, especially since i had a lot to get rid of!!

I made these last night and they turned out great!  They were a big hit with my boyfriend and his mom.  Very moist.  However, if you are looknig for a more traditional tasting zucchini bread I think these taste more like blueberry muffins.  Have fun with this recipe and experiment other ingredients like nuts, cranberries, or raisins.

Who would have thought that zucchini and blueberries could be so delicious together? This is so wonderful ... very moist and addictive. I halved the recipe and made one large loaf. I'm already wishing I had made two! Next time, I'll make a glaze to go on top. Not that it needs it ... just a personal preference.

I made these for my coworkers.  Overall they liked them, but I thought they needed some texture.  Oh, I baked them into about 24 muffins.  Maybe some oats mixed in or a streusel topping would make this a 5.

I altered the recipe.  Half white and half brown sugar and cut back total sugar by 30%.  I also add 2 Tbsp blackstrap molasses.  It was still plenty sweet.  Increased zucchini to 3 cups because I had a lot.  And I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  My husband said it was the best zucchini bread he had ever eaten.

Best zucchini bread I’ve ever had.  Only had a cup of white sugar, so I substituted a with a cup of brown sugar. Also I topped the loaves with about a 1/4 cup of course turbinado sugar, which made a nice crust. I divided the batter between two loaf pans and baked for one hour at 350F.

I adopted the suggestion to use 3 cups of shredded zucchini and swapped 1/2 cup of oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce. Wonderfully moist and tasty.  I sprayed and floured 1 large loaf and 3 minis.  Filled 2/3 full and had no overflow.

A winner of a recipe. Husband and kids absolutely loved it. I made 12 muffins and 1 large loaf with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as specified and it turned out beautifully. Thank you!

I adapted this recipe because I wanted to use up my unsweetened applesauce and wanted my bread to have a lemon taste with no cinnamon to dominate that flavor.  So the used about 3/4 cup of applesauce and filled the rest of the one cup message with veggie oil.  Then I added 1 TBS of grated fresh lemon zest to the liquid ingredients.  My batter made four mini loafs and 2 jumbo muffins.  I also made Cookie Queens review on here for a crumble topping, but used a lot of lemon zest instead of cinnamon and pecans instead of walnuts.  It was the best zucchini bread I have ever tasted and I am a avid baker!  Great base recipe!  Blueberries and lemon with zucchini are heavenly!  I will make again for sure!

This was great!  I took some tips from other reviewers and reduced the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also added 1/4 t. nutmeg to the batter and used frozen blueberries instead of fresh after  tossing them  in a little flour so that they wouldn't sink to the bottom of the pan. I baked the bread in a bundt pan that I greased and sprinkled with a combination of 1 t. white sugar, I t. brown sugar, 1 t. cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg - shaking off the excess.  I baked for an hour and 15 minutes and it came out perfectly.  Our bumper crop of zucchini will be put to good use this year since I will definitely be making this again!

I had fresh blueberries that were a little past their prime, I picked out few ones that had mold, the rest were fine.  I rinsed them off first and still even used the ones that were a little dry. I then followed recipe to the exact.  I divided in 2 regular bread loaf pans sprayed with Pam and baked about 15-20 mins longer ( I used toothpick check method )
It turned out moist and delicious ! So don't toss your days old blueberries !

I have a ton of frozen blueberries that I had picked during our summer vacation to Michigan so have been experimenting. This recipe makes a really nice bread with a great moist texture and flavor.  My only complaint is it is really too sweet for my liking. Next time I'll cut down on the sugar.

If there is one thing I have learned this summer making any recipes that call for shredded zucchini: One MUST drain lots of water off  before using. I have a salad spinner which works wonderfully for this purpose. 
I followed this recipe exactly, except for using 2 regular loaf pans instead of 4 smaller loaf pans. I kept testing the middle of the 2 loafs until my knife came out clean. The baking time increased by about 30 minutes.
The bread is delicious and I will no doubt make it again.

It was very tasty and moist but the zucchini flavor was not strong. Next time I will add more than the 2 cups of zucchini the recipe called for.

Super Delicious! My son is allergic to eggs and soy so I thought I'd give this a try with Greek Yogurt in place of the eggs and Canola oil for the vegetable oil and it worked perfectly and is super moist with good flavor and texture! (3/4 cup yogurt for the 3 eggs).

The last time I made this I used self rising flour ( no need for the baking powder or salt this way),  cut the sugar to 1 cup and added a cup of chopped walnuts.  I also baked it in a 9 x 13 pan to make into bars.  My oven did it in about 45 min on 350.   Super easy to dish out .  Hope you guys enjoy this recipe as much as we did.

Love this recipe. I used gluten free flour, 1 1/4 cups brown sugar + 1 white and added some nutmeg. Baked in two 4x8 pans for 1 hour & 20 mins and they came out perfect. I tried one non-stick pan lightly oiled and a tin-foil pan also oiled - both loaves came out easily after 20 min. rest but definitely prefer the easy cleaning with the tin foil! I made a streusel topping but made the mistake of making too much and the top was pretty hard/crunchy! The flavor of the loaf is spot-on though :)
Note: I used two packed cups of well-drained zucchini but did not use the salt/weep method - just squeezed it out in a dish towel.

I used yellow squash instead  because I had an abundance of it in my garden. I pressed the Shredded  squash btw. Paper  towels to get rid of some of the moisture.  There still was plenty left so after checking with a toothpick  I ended up increasing bake time about 10 minutes. But it was still delicious.

WOW!! This is incredible. I followed the recipe exactly except I did flour my blueberry before adding so they not sink. I also did half oil and half applesauce (I do this with most my baking to help keep it moist). The smell while baking was incredible-I wanted to eat it right then. 

I made a few mini loaves (5X3 1/4) which took 50 minutes--it didn't look like it was baking until the last 10 minutes. I also made a couple  8X4 loaves which took a bit longer than the 50 min--not sure how much more as I used the clean knife test. Half way through I rotated my pans half way around. Did not open the oven any other time until timer went off. I know some reviews say their bread was soggy and mushy--not mine. Nice and moist and the crispy crunchy outer that all my breads have. I will admit as I started to mix ingredients together I was worried as it was soupy when I added the zucchini. It thickened up a little bit when adding the flour mixture but, it baked wonderfully. 

I did not squeeze or drain my zucchini. I shredded it right before using it. I also kept the skin on as more nutritional value. You can see flecks of green in the bread. It does have more of a blueberry than zucchini taste in my opinion. 

I did forget to grease my pans but had no problem when slicing and taking out--no sticking at all. 

This is a keeper and I know I will be making more.

The BEST zucchini bread that my family as ever tasted.  The blueberries are the perfect compliment.  There is only one change to the recipe that I made: instead of using all-purpose flour + salt + baking powder + baking soda, I used 3 cups of self-rising flour.  It made all the difference in the world AND cut down on unnecessary work.  I recommend this recipe to all of you.

These turned out delicious!! I made them as written and they are moist, not too sweet, and a great way to use up garden goodness. I quadrupled the recipe since I had 5 lbs of blueberries, 2 huge zucchini, and 1 giant yellow squash to use up. From the quadrupled recipe, I yielded 6 loaves, 24 muffins, and 48 mini muffins. The loaves baked about 55 mins in my oven, the muffins about 25 mins, and the mini muffins about 15-20 mins. I will be freezing most of these for use through the winter or to give as last minute gifts. The hard part will be keeping my husband and kids away from them while they finish cooking!!

It was great!  not too sweet.  I did 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil.  I also used only 2 cups of sugar and sprinkled some white and brown sugar and nutmeg on top.  i used 2 large loaf pans and cooked them for 1 hour.

After making it exactly as written, I altered a bit to make it more my taste.  Used a bit more zucchini (maybe 2.5 cups, drained of liquid), 1.5 cups sugar, and substituted 1/2 the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  The more blueberries, the better :)

Bake in 2 normal sized loaf pans (about 8 x 5 inches) for about 1 hour.  Makes a very moist and flavorful bread!

This was moist & delicious...I didn't have enough white flour, so subbed a third of the amount with whole wheat.  I always use half applesauce instead of so much oil in any baking recipe.  After reading other reviews, I cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  Overall a great recipe.  I made a double batch and ended up with 4 small loaves and 2 large loaves.

As other reviewers recommended I used 1/2c oil & 1/2c applesauce, 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown.  I did a dozen muffins and one large loaf.  Very yummy.

Delicious! I made half a recipe (using 2 large eggs), which was the perfect amount of batter for (2) 3" x 7" loaf pans, and baked them for 47 minutes. It's moist, with a nice, tender crumb and absolutely delicious served slightly warm with a slather of butter. Yummy!

Oh. My.  Best zucchini bread EVER.  I swapped 1/3 of the flour for wheat flour.  I didn't bother to squeeze the water out of the zucchini, its moisture seemed needed in the batter.  And it came out perfectly moist and absolutely delish!  Will absolutely be making this again and again.

Delicious!  I made it with the whole wheat flour and apple sauce substitutions and it was moist and yummy.  The blueberries make it special.  Both of my loaves stuck to the bottom of baking pans so I will have to figure that out but will definitely make again.

This recipe is great - after reading reviews I must comment. Please DO NOT drain the zucchini.  Zucchini is inherently watery, which is what is considered when making any zucchini bread.  The water is there for the moisture. You can add more zucchini without ruining the recipe, but do not drain, squeeze out, salt or otherwise reduce the liquid.  It will not be as good. This is a great combo - delicious bread as is, or with sugar or applesauce changes. But just because it has vegetables in it does not make it healthy.  Flour and sugar in near equal amounts is not healthy....delicious yes, healthy no.  Enjoy this because it is good.  It's not a healthy diet food.

Tried it again today.  Came out great, I didn't have blueberries  so I used dried cranberries .  Delish.

I hate to rate things when I have altered, but based on reading many reviews, I decided to take the plunge and do the half and half idea with whole wheat and all-purpose flour and the half and half oil/applesauce. My zucchini was very wet, so I did gently squeeze it before folding it into the batter. Other than that, I followed the original recipe. It WAS FANTASTIC!!! So moist and delicious. I sprayed my pans, and did let the loaves cool as recommended and they slipped right out in one piece. Gorgeous. Now I am urging my zucchini plants to produce even more!

These are great!  I didn't have applesauce but wanted to cut the sugar and oil so I mashed up a ripe banana and used 3/4 cup of oil and 1 cup and a half of sugar. I haven't used zucchini before, so I appreciate others suggesting how to get the water out.  I grated a large zucchini and used all of it.  Putting the grated zucchini in a dish towel to squeeze out the water worked very well!  I put the batter in muffin cups and baked for 25-27 mins in the oven.  They turned out very good!  Made 22 medium sized muffins.

I made this exactly as the recipe states. It made 8 mini loaves and 1 large loaf. I sprinkled the tops with coarse sugar for some crunch. This bread is by far one of my favorites!! DELICIOUS!!!!

I substituted Pamela's artisan gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar cup for cup for the flour and sugar and it came out perfect. I used a bunt pan, increased the time to 60 min, and used the convection setting. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Moist and delicious!

Made this delicious recipe today and followed the directions for the most part. I added carrots and used blackberries instead of blueberries since we have wild ones growing in our yard. I also used more brown sugar verses white sugar. Put in muffin tins and turned out scrumptious! I'm gonna make more to freeze for quick treats for later!

Amazing recipe. I use half unsweetened Apple sauce and vegetable oil. I use a bit more zucchini and blueberries, and cost the blueberries in flour before tossing it in. I make sure the zucchini is as dry as can be before tossing it in. I bake the muffins for 25 minutes and top them with brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and walnut bits. It's always been a hit!

Just made this...delicious! I used a little less than 2 cups sugar and will probably cut more out next time, and made muffins instead of loaves. I will probably substitute applesauce for the oil next time and try it that way for healthier version. This one is a keeper!!

I followed the recipe ingredients almost exactly and was amazed that this bread is so delicious!  My husband loved it too!  I used 1 cup of coconut flour and 2 cups of regular flour.  I used a large loaf pan (didn't have mini's) and used remaining batter to make 12 muffins!  I am not sure on exact time of muffins.  I just checked them periodically and pulled them out when an inserted toothpick had only a small amount of crumb on it.  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it. It was perfect for 8 mini loaves, 4 small metal pans and 4 paper holiday ones. The metal pans were done in just a little over 50 minutes... the paper ones took a bit longer. It's a great treat to have with coffee. I don't find it overly sweet... I used fresh blueberries and don't really taste the zucchini but it's very blueberry tasting and moist. The recipe was easy to follow. I will make again for sure... it's different then the traditional zucchini bread the rest of my family makes and I've never seen a recipe with the blueberries mixed in.

Holy mother of all that's good in this world,  this recipe is heavenly!  My family was doubtful and thought I was trying to trick them (I'm the only zucchini lover in our house) but it was unanimous...this rocks.  I kept to the recipe with the only exceptions being subbing 1/2 cup of oil for applesauce and making muffins instead of bread.

Yummy! Moist and lots of flavor from berries. I used frozen whole blueberries that I partially thawed and rolled in a bit of flour before folding into the batter. (That helps them not to sink to the bottom of the pan.) This recipe isn't specific on the size of the "mini-loaf pans" but I needed 5 of them...mine are 5 3/4 x 3 x 2 1/8 deep. It's a keeper!

Very good and tasty loaf.  I used large frozen blueberries but next time will be sure to use SMALL berries.  Large ones are too messy once baked.  Maybe if they were fresh berries the loaf it would have been fine.

AMAZING! Used reviewers tips- 1/2c applesauce 1/2c oil. Made a crumb with 1.2c sugar 1/2c brown sugar 2 tsp butter. Filled muffin baking liners all the way to the top. Looks like something you'd buy in a bakery. Thank you for sharing! If hubs approves I'll be making these all the time!

The recipe is great but I substituted 3/4 cup canola oil  and 1/4 cup of applesauce for the oil, and cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  I also substituted a cup of oat bran for a cup of flour.

Very good!! I too cut back on the cinnamon.  all I could think of when I read 1 tablespoon cinnamon, was  the "cinnamon challenge"!!!!! So I only used a teaspoon and a half.   1/2 cup less sugar.   Everything else left the same. Although,next time I will use less oil and sub in either yogurt or applesauce...maybe even sour cream.   All in all this was a good recipe to use up extra zucchini and blueberries. As towards the end of summer we kinda get burned out, thank goodness they both freeze well.

This is a great recipe. I make this into two small loaf pans and bake for 35 minutes or into muffins and bake 25-30 minutes or until the top springs back when you touch the top. I like the idea of 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce instead of all oil. You can do this with almost all baking recipe that calls for a large amount of oil. It taste better also.

I just tried this recipe and followed it as per the directions except I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It turned out surprisingly well.  It was probably a bit more dense than with sugar,but as a diabetic it was wonderful and I appreciated being able to have a taste.

Absolutely terrific!! As many others suggested, I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat. I didn't increase the baking powder, because since I had really small eggs today I used 4 of them. It rose beautifully. Cut the sugar by 1/3 and used a Splenda-like sugar substitute. Next time I will reduce the sugar/sweetener combo to 1 3/4 cups total as suggested by others. Bread was moist and not too heavy. Delish!

Love this!!!! Followed the recipe to the letter the first time --- yummy! Then I made muffins from this --- moist and delicious. Since I do not have the time to bake every morning, I froze the muffins individually with a vacuum food system in plastic bags using the pulse/gentle setting as not to crush the muffin. Before going to bed, I put a frozen muffin on the counter and microwave 15 seconds to warm it the next morning.

I don't know what I did wrong!!  I followed the recipe and all the blueberries sunk to the bottom of the little loaf pans and the dough was almost liquid at the bottom of each pan.  It tasted good, but I was planning on giving a few of the pans away, but I'm not going to.

This will be our fave from now on.   The only change I made was substituting one cup of white sugar with one cup of demerara  sugar.   Wonderful  rich taste...  One loaf for freezer and one to enjoy now.....

Loved these...tasty and very moist. For half of the oil, I subbed applesauce and replaced 1/4 cup of sugar with brown sugar. I think you could definitely cut back on the sugar with no problem. Dusted the blueberries with some of the combined dry mixture. I did end up with 4 mini-loaves AND 2 Texas-sized muffins! Topped them all with turbinado sugar that I mixed with a bit of cinnamon. Just had a slice with a little whipped cream cheese. YUM! Thanka LAUJRA!

This is  a very moist and flavorful zucchini bread! It's not too dense and has a really good texture. I will definitely save this recipe and make it again. I tweaked it slightly according to some suggestions, but these are minor. I used coconut oil instead of veggie oil, 2 Cups of sugar, and only 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon. I also cut back on the blueberries as I used a heaping cup instead (maybe about 1.5 cups). 
I used two regular sized bread pans and divided the batter between them. It cooked for the recommended time and then about 5 min. more, but just watch it so that you don't over cook it.  The batter would probably fit in one regular pan, but I think you would have a longer cook time. 
The bread popped right out of the pan (don't over cook and allow it to sit for the full 20 min before moving to a wire rack.)

Great recipe!!  I doubled it and I made 10 mini loaves (bought the tins at the grocery store) and one dozen muffins.  Exactly 50 minutes for loaves and 25 for the muffins!!  I filled the mini tins about 2/3 full and they were perfect!  Will be making this again.

My stepson brought me a bag of blueberries and one  so I tried to find something to do with the blueberries and ran across this recipe. I followed the original  recipe and it is wonderful. So moist and full of flavor. Thank you for the post. I will definitely make again.

I really liked this one. I made muffins instead of bread. I followed the advice of some others on this site and they were very correct. Substituted: 1.5 cups white,1.5 cups wheat flour. 2c white sugar,1/4c brown sugar. 1/2c oil,1/2c apple sauce. 3tsp baking powder. cook time 40 mins.

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out wonderful. It does take a while longer than stated - after checking, I added 10 minutes to the time. But that could easily be the temperature variation in ovens. Will definitely make this again.

I made this bread this weekend due to a plethora of blueberries and zucchini. We brought it to a friend's house and everyone loved it. I, too, made it in two larger loaf pans and baked for 1 hour 20 minutes. it came out perfect and it was very moist. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe!  I also substituted raspberries for the blueberries added white chocolate chips and instead of oil used 1 cup of applesauce.  I received raving reviews!!  Think next time I will make a crumble topping to put on top.

Just made this morning and they are the best ever! Followed the suggestions of others. Used applesauce and canola oil 1/2 each. 3 cups zucchini.   Used white and wheat flour. Reduced sugar to 1  1/2 cups ...split between white and brown.  Increases baking powder to 3 tsp.  Added a crumble on top.  Absolutely fabulous!

Excellent!  Followed the recipe using baking sticks instead of oil, and made two standard loaf pans.  Can't keep these around longer than two days at the longest.  Moist and delicious!

YUM!!!! After reading a bunch of reviews.. I made the following changes..
- 3 cups shredded zuccini, measured then drained/squeezed to get rid of water (instead of 2C Zucc)
- 1 C white, 1 C brown sugar (instead of 2 1/4 C white sugar)
- 1/3C oil, 2/3C applesauce (instead of 1C oil)
- 1 1/2  tsp baking soda (instead of 1 tsp)
- 1 tsp cinnamon (instead of 1T cinnamon)
So good, my 7yo picky daughter loved it and said it's the best muffin! My 5yo super non veggie child got turned off by the zucchini. :( maybe I will peel the skin next time I make it so there's no green showing..

I made this recipe to the "T" the first time and it was pretty good a little sugary but good however the second time I decided to shake it up a bit and change a few things including one of the main ingredients! When it came to the oil a full cup seemed like an awful lot to me so instead of one cup of vegetable oil I did a half cup of apple sauce and a half cup of coconut oil. for the sugar I reduced the white sugar down to one cup and added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  lastly, I didn't feel like blueberries this time and wanted to go a naughtier route so I replaced them with chocolate chips.  after I poured the batter into my loaf pans I sprinkled the top with a little sugar in the raw.  These modifications to an already top notch recipe turned out to be the most decadently rich dessert I have ever had!  super moist and absolutely irresistible!!!!

I made this recipe last night for the first time.  The only change I made to the actual recipe was substituting unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil to cut the fat.  I baked mine in the individual mini pans and the full recipe makes 16 individual serving size loaves.  My husband,who is quite critical of most quick breads, absolutely loved this. I will definitely be making this again. Enjoy!!!

OMG this was the best zucchini bread I've ever tasted in my 56 years of life! I did throw in extra cinnamon and some nutmeg but other than that I followed the recipe as directed. I used 2 loaf pans and baked them for 80 minutes. The top of the bread came out muffin-like, crisp and brown. The inside was moist and just plain delicious. Glad I liked this, I just picked 8 large zucchini from my garden... off to the grocery for more berries!

I made this exactly as shown, but since I was making muffins I did increase the baking soda and baking powder to get nice crowns.  This was exceptional.  I seldom give five stars, but this one deserved it! I topped them with a little bit of sugar before baking to get a little crunch on top and they are disappearing quickly.  I have more zucchini than I know what to do with, so this will be a frequent go to recipe this summer.

Everyone loved this bread at my neighborhood gathering!  And I had several requests for the recipe : )   I used yellow squash (sometimes called yellow zucchini). I made a large loaf, a small loaf and 8 muffins from the batch. Thanks for this recipe!!!

Other than using half brown sugar and half wheat flour, I stuck to the recipe and made them into muffins, baking them for about 20 minutes.  They were moist and tasty.  I plan to make them again and add the crumb mixture on top as others suggested.  This is a yummy way to get your veggies. :)

I just made this bread, and it was amazing! So moist inside, slightly crunchy on the outside. I think I've found a new favorite!
Followed the recipe exactly. I considered subbing in some brown sugar for white, but after tasting results I will not change a thing. 
Definitely need to cool 20 minutes before removing from pan. Would easily fall apart if not partially cooled. Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was a great change up in our brunch menu.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed it.  I have just this one note to add.  I got blueberries from Sam's Club and they were HUGE.  So they ended up mostly settling to the bottom of the loaf.  No big deal what so ever as I used two meatloaf pans to make two loaves instead of four mini loaf pans but just thought I would mention it.  The tops of mine did not come out looking as similar as the photo in the recipe.  Very tasty!

Was SUCH a huge hit!  I made a crumb topping (flour, sugar, brown sugar and butter) that really topped it off nicely.

I'm so glad I had an abundance of both blueberries and zucchinis from the farmer's market last summer, otherwise I would have never thought to put these two together, which is a shame, 'cause they are great together! I did make some adjustments though, to make it a little healthier and feel better eating it :)
used white whole wheat flour, substituted apple sauce for half the oil, and decreased the sugar a bit. Also, I used a little more blueberries and zucchini, mostly because I didn't want to waste it after I had shredded it and because I like blueberries :)

I put frozen mixed berries instead of fresh blueberries and it worked great! everyone really like it! I don't have mini loaf pans so I used just normal loaf pans and cooked it for ten minutes longer. It browned the outside a little more than i would have liked, but everyone else said it tasted and looked delicious!

This is a good recipe, but there seems to be way too much sugar.  2 1/4 cups leaves the cake very sweet even when baked through.  Plus all the sugar tends to cause the cake to stick more to the sides of the pan.

This was yummy but my daughter and I wish we could have tasted more of the zucchini. I made two big loaves. Had to cook just about 15mins longer.   I did cut back a little on the sugar, instead of 2-1/4 cup, I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  As far as the cup of oil, I use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup coconut oil(first time using it), worked great!  My daughter said it was even better the second day, a 5 then.  I still would have liked more zucchini taste.

Great way to use veggies from the garden; even spicy banana peppers one summer. Sub half of applesauce for oil, add choc chips, add pecans, and brown sugar a top.  Never the same; family rmbrs the cchips, nuts, and berries. Use frozen berries or fresh. Makes great muffins; share or freeze. Friends/Family ask for the recipe!

This is one of the best quick-mix breads I have had!  It has a great cinnamon flavor which makes it very festive.  I have made this recipe a few times now, once following it precisely, the second substituting applesauce for 3/4 of the oil.  Both times the bread came out moist and delicious.  I have received so many compliments on this bread.

Yum! Love this recipe with the healthier alterations I made. I use melted coconut oil instead of veg oil, only ONE cup of sugar (that's where I took away one star. It calls for way more sugar than necessary), milled flaxseed mixed with water to replace eggs, and whole wheat flour instead of white all-purpose.
Just to note: the batter will slightly solidify if using coconut oil and frozen blueberries, making it a bit more challenging to get into the pans (you kinda have to press it in) but it all softens again once in the oven and turns out fine :)

These were awesome.  Bought zucchini to add some different veggies to our diet.  I followed tips by others and used half the measuresments for flour and added whole wheat flour and did the same with the sugar, using a little less thn half brown sugar.  I also used frozen blueberries.  I rinsed them a slightly mashed them to remove the excess juice.  They smelled soooo good baking.  My 4yr old son and I devoured ours while they were warm.  He said they were better than my browies, which he loves!! My 12 yr old and husband loved them too.  I'll tell them later that they had zucchini in them:)  Thanks!!

This recipe according to my kids is the "bomb diggity"!  I followed the recipe according to cookiequeen's suggestions adding the crumb topping and I must say it is absolutely delicious.  I might caution anyone that bakes in stoneware, you will have to bake it approximately 1 hour 15 minutes as opposed to the 50 minutes called for using a metal pan(s), but other than that, it's a winning recipe.  Follow exactly as it is, or with the couple of changes made by others with the brown sugar, and crumb topping and you won't regret it.

I thought I'd try this as something different from pineapple/zucchini bread. Not my favorite. It wasn't all that sweet. It really needed a glaze or something sweet on top. The bread was kind of ho-hum. I doubled the batch... bummer.

I tried this recipe and instead of making the mini loaves I made 2 regular loaves and two min loaves.  I didn't drain the zucchini just measured the amount needed.  I used my grinder to grind up the zucchini.  It was great.  Very moist and not dry and it did not crumble,even after several days.  I did keep it in the refrigerator. My family loved it.

Awesome.  Used half applesauce, half oil.  Used 1 cup gluten free flour and the two regular cups of of flour.  Baked for 60 minutes and covered the two regular sized loaf pans with foil so it would not get too dark.  My husband and his band ate one whole loaf and gave it five star which I do too!

This was sooo good! I followed the recipe except for baking them in one huge metal pan, and they came out beautifully. I made this with frozen blueberries and regular blueberries and it came out great both ways.

This is a great recipe! However I made just a few changes. I cut the sugar down by half and used the brown sugar blend for the 1/4 cup. I added just about 3/4 cup more berries.  It is rather dense but extremely tasty.   I could not keep my husband out of it and the first loaf is almost gone.

I made the modifications that Cookiequeen suggested... 3 cups of zucchini, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the crumble topping. Smells so good while it's cooking that it is almost to much to handle, but worth the wait!. I used 2 full size loaf pans and cooked just over an hour.

I have made these more times than I can count.  I do not alter the recipe at all.  They are delicious!  I make a ton of loaves while my zucchini is plentiful and then I freeze them.  They are just as wonderful after they thaw out and what a treat to eat this in the winter.  Thanks for sharing!

I made enough changes from reading so many reviews - I posted them on my blog . . . making this the first time to take to church . . . I was a bit concerned - had enough batter to make a couple of cupcake sizes - sampled and was pleased. The samples did not have a topping and still were plenty sweet. I cut the sugar, used honey . . . the topping with shaved almonds - got the idea from one of the many photos - the almonds gave the contrasting crunch that really turned up the 'tasty' value.

Made this today.  Had a large zucchini from the garden and went to pick blueberries at a local farm. followed recipe exactly. Came out perfect!  OMG! My husband, kids, mother, father...everyone was in love with this bread!  I will definitely be making this again and again!  They were so good and cute, these would make nice little gifts to give to family and friends at the holidays!

A great use of our CSA zucchini and blueberries!  I didn't have four mini-loaf pans - I only had one large loaf pan and a muffin tin, so that's what I used, and it turned out awesome!  Update: I have now made these into muffins a few times and they always turn out amazing.  This recipe is now a staple for me!

Wasn't for sure about this recipe at first; but I figured since it got great reviews we should try it. IT WAS DELICIOUS! I made two pans because I didn't have small loaf pans, just cooked it a little longer.  My husband said the only thing he would add is walnuts.

This is so delicious! I took the advice of a reviewer and added a crumble topping. I also think baking it closer to 60 mins worked best for me. This is a favorite in our house and I love taking it to neighbors, teachers, etc. as well!

Great recipe, definite keeper!  I made with slightly less sugar, used frozen blueberries (thawed for a little while) and I sprinkled 2 T white sugar and 2 T brown sugar mix on top, an idea from another review. I put the zucchini in completely wet without drying off at all.  I used 1/2 batter for one normal size loaf (350 for 50 mins) and the other half made 12 muffins to save time(350 at 18 mins).  Both turned out fantastic!

Loved this bread!  I usually do a chocolate zucchini bread but found this recipe and decided to try it.  Amazing!  The only change I made was I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/4.  And I made in two large loaf pans, cooking for 1 hour they were perfect!  My kids and my neighbor loved it, will definitely make again.

YUMMY!!  I hadn't had zucchini bread since I was a kid, and this didn't disappoint.  I tried it ALMOST as written for the first time, the only things I changed was I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and I tossed the blueberries in flour.  After mixing the batter, I was a little nervous, because it was significantly denser than most quick breads I'm used to, so I was worried I had made a mistake.  I went ahead an baked them and they turned out yummy.  I did the mini loaves, and came out with 4 beautiful loaves.  I do see the simplicity of changing this recipe up to meet not only tastes, but health preferences, and sizes - Hubby said he thought he'd prefer these as muffing, 'cause then he could have a whole thing instead of just a slice ;)

This is the second year I've used this recipe.  We love it.  I've made it per the instructions the first time and loved it.  Then I made it with 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar (dropped 1/4 cup, and used 3 cups of zucchini and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  It was super fantastic.  Next I'm going to try the 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and try using Splenda.  Thank you Laujra for a great recipe.

I've tried this recipe before and it was great! I'm actually baking this exact recipe right now minus the blueberries because I didn't have time to buy some earlier. But I love this recipe, it's easy and delicious, my whole family loves it even my sister who's not really into zucchini :)

This is so moist and delish! I use frozen blueberries (do not thaw) and I use two 9x5 pans.  It freezes great! I wrap the completely cooled bread in foil then place in a gallon freezer bag.

II also was looking for something more hearty than a "muffin" so I used half oil and half applesauce as well as half whole wheat andhalf white flour.  This was a big hit, even for the 15yo who hates zucchini.

These were fabulous- definitely the best thing I've EVER made! I did use a mix of fresh and frozen blueberries, since I didn't have enough fresh berries on hand. I also substituted about half the sugar for brown sugar, which was an excellent change. Oh, and I only had a full size loaf pan, so I just put the dough in that and baked accordingly. I also added a butter and brown sugar mixture on top afterwards and stuck in the oven on broil for a nice caramelized brown sugar topping. I will make this over and over, because I can't get enough of it!

This bread is great! It was moist, sweet, and not too dense. I never would have thought that blueberries and zucchini would taste good together, but I had some extra zucchinis from my garden and thought I'd give it a try. I made some changes to make it healthier- 1/2 applesauce + 1/2 oil, egg substitute, 1c. sugar + 1c. splenda, and half the flour whole. The batter made 12 regular-sized muffins and two mini- loaves. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Meh.  Plain zucchini bread is better.  The blueberries didn't add that much and they are such an expensive fruit.

Don't look any farther! Great bread especially with the addition of the blueberries. I did sub half of the oil with applesauce just to use up some that I had in the fridge. I also used more like 3 cups of zucchini. I subbed the white sugar with sucanat because I never use white sugar and I used only 2 cups instead of the 2 1/4. And then I rolled the blueberries in flour before adding then to the batter so that they would not sink to the bottom. Also I baked 2 loaves instead of 4 and baked for about 1 hour and 10 min.

You can't go wrong with this one.  I made it into 24 muffins with crumb topping for a brunch at work.  They were fighting over them.  Great as is.  Personal changes crumb topping (equal parts ww flour, brown sugar, old-fashioned oatmeal and butter with a dash of cinnamon), switched out the flour (1 cup unbleached and 2 cups whole wheat), added 1/2 a cup of zuccchini and swithced out the oil with olive oil.

Great recipe! Added a little more zucchini than called for (maybe 2.5 cup?) and used part honey part sugar (less sugar). In muffin pan, I filled each tray about 1/3 full with batter and placed about 1t of homemade cherry jam and covered the jam with the remaining batter and finally sprinkled some sugar on top. Very delicious! I think I will try some topping like others suggested next tie.

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband is not one to eat anything with zucchini in it and he gobbled it up.  Instead of baking four mini loaves, I made two regular loaves and baked it for an hour.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good zucchini bread followed recipe exact. Next time will decrease the sugar a bit and add a crumb topping then I think it will be a five star. Will definately be making this one again.

I made this bread several times this past summer.  It is by far the best zucchini bread I've ever had!  I also made a couple changes...I put in less sugar and cinnamon.  It turned out perfect everytime.

Wonderful recipe!  Made muffins and only change was wheat flour.  They were light and sweet and moist.  Definitely going into my favorites.

I have made this recipe several times. I used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil in a aluminum pan. If you use glass pans plan for less cooking time.

Yum! This is great! I did switch out two ingredients. Coconut oil and coconut extract instead of veg ok and vanilla extract. I love coconut and it is a wonderful base for the zucchini and blueberries.

Really enjoyed this bread/cake! Just made it tonight.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I didn't have cinnnimon so I threw in a bit of honey, didn't have quite enough blueberries so I also cut up some cherries, and I used half whole wheat flour.  I would have also used the applesauce as many recommended but I didn't have any so I used the full cup oil.  Also I used 2 cups sugar.  Oh and I made a crumble as many others did with what I had, almonds, sunflower seeds, oats, and the usuals.  Very good !!

I did make three small changes but not drastic ones.  For all recipes that call for white flour I split it half white and half wheat (this time I did spelt flour so it wasn't quite as chewy as wheat).  I used half white, half brown sugar and cut it to 2 total cups.  I can back off a little more next time especially if my blueberries are not quite so tart.  I also went down to two teaspoons of cinnamon.  I think the recipe would have been great without my changes.  I made them for our personal preferences.

These are yummy!  I used 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 c oil, half of the flour was wheat flour, and 2 c sugar - 1 white, 1 brown. It turned out great! It tasted best once it had cooled a little bit!

Best bread ever! Other than using half white flour/half white whole wheat flour, plus 1/2 apple sauce & 1/2 cup oil vs. 1 cup oil (just for a healthier alternative) I didn't change a thing. I didn't have mini loaf pans, so baked in 2 regular loaf pans for 1 hr 20 mins. I made the streusel suggested by cookiequeen in her review and topped 1 of the loaves with it, leaving the second one plain (note: cookiequeen's recipe makes a lot of topping. Next time I will half the recipe). Both loaves were amazing, although I prefer the plain one. My sweet-toothed family; however, loved the one with the streusel topping. Both were gone by the end of the day and my mother-in-law requested it for a mountain getaway. Thank you for posting. Love finding recipes that truly work.

We love this. I got 5 of the small loaf pans of it. Thanks for sharing.
UPDATE - I have subbed chopped nuts and dried cranberries in place of blueberries with great results. I may try chocolate chips next time.

Taste was amazing BUT I used a bundt pan and it was a mess... the cooking time was over an hour and even though knife came out dry during the poke test... it fell apart... maybe I used too many blueberries.  I didn't toss it, taste so good I think they guys at work will still have at it!  Will try again.

Made these as muffins yesterday with 2c raw sugar, 3c zucchini.  Awesome!  Trying another batch now in the oven using gluten-free baking mix, 3c blueberry, handful of gf oats, and slivered almonds.  I'm sure they will rock!

used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c oil and about 1 3/4 c sugar. Second time I made it I only had about 3/4 c zucchini so I added 1 3/4 c shredded carrots. Made crumble topping with equal parts of oatmeal, brown sugar, flour, butter and crushed pecans. This makes about 48 mini muffins (bake for about 12-15 mins)

This recipe is perfect as it is. I only used 2 C of sugar because I try to be somewhat responsible when baking for my family however I followed all the other ingredients to a tee.  I added the crumble as all the others did and will definitely be keeping this in rotation. Thank you so much, LAUJRA!

Made this recipe today and it was AMAZING!

I substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of using the full cup of veg oil. (still used 1/2 cup of oil)
I also used only 2 cups of sugar.. 1 cup brown and 1 cup white. I also did as others suggested and put a crumb on the top of the loaves! They taste absolutely fantastic and I will def make them again soon!!!

Thanks for posting, this is a great recipe! I put half the amount of blueberries called for. I also left it in for 7 more minutes in oven. (I may have a slow oven) 
Looked pretty and tasted great! 
It's a keeper recipe!

subbed out some of the sugar for applesauce, and subbed some of the white flour for whole wheat, added strawberries, as I felt I had too few blueberries.  cooked for 45 mins in two med sized pans and it was perfect :)

Light and fluffy.  I didn't make any changes except I did one large loaf and one cake pan and just adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  Next time I make it, I might decrease some of the sugar, add another 1/2 pint of blueberries and do a crumb topping like others suggested.  Excellent

This recipe is fantastic.  My family had no idea they were eating zucchini and my teen boys ate a whole loaf the first day (I had made 2 larger loaves).  

I used 1/2 cp of oil and 1 1/4 c sugar (mixed with splenda) for health reasons. 1 cp sugar went in mix and the quarter cup went on top of loaves for a crunchy texture.

Delicious recipe whether you like zucchini or not.  I made this into 24 muffins which baked for 25 min. Used lots of cinnamon which we love.  To increase the healthy aspect of the ingredients without changing the flavour, I substituted the flour with a whole wheat + white flour blend.  I used half the oil and added applesauce until batter was the right texture.  I also used "Sun Crystals" a stevia/cane sugar blend instead of white sugar.  Turned out great!  Thanks for this, will definitely make again.

Beautiful cake, everyone really enjoyed it. I also followed several tweakings: half of the oil was replaced by applesauce, half the White sugar by raw brown sugar, and also one teaspoon of allspice for a twist.

So moist and delicious! I did change it slightly though. I used 3 cups of zucchini, a very well rounded tablespoon of cinnamon (I love my cinnamon) and I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the top of the loaves. I will be keeping this recipe in my recipe box! Thanks!

This recipe was good. It was sweet and crispy on top and soft and moist inside. It was perfect. We had an abundance of zucchini and blueberries so this worked great. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is OK. I think its a little too heavy probably due to all of that oil! Next time Id cut out some of the oil. Its more like a cake than a bread and its a little...bland? Maybe it will taste better tomorrow after the flavors blend a bit but eh..

This one was really good...I thought the flavour would pop a bit more but it didn't...not sure why. I used the topping of cinnamon, white sugar, and brown sugar as others suggested, it was a nice touch. I made them as muffins, came out to 24 and baked for 25 minutes. This was perfect.

This is excellent.  I didn't change anything except added some extra blueberries.  I baked in 2 large loaf pans for about 1 hr 15 min or till toothpick came clean.  My husband told me never to make regular zucchini bread again.  This also freezes well. Note if you add extra berries be sure to grease your pan well or they may stick and tear the loaf on the bottom when removing from pan.  
Pam baking spray did not work well with this.  Better to stick to conventional pan greasing methods.

My husband and coworkers loved this recipe.  I used 2 large bread pans and baked for 80 minutes.  Top it with butter and enjoy with coffee for a delicious start to your day.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good recipe!  I did tweak it a bit to use half white flour and half whole wheat.  I also added 3 cups of zucchini and only 2 cups of sugar.  I make a lot of zucchini nut bread and the blueberries are a nice addition!  Very moist bread with tons of flavor!

I also did not have mini pans, used one fullsized metal nonstick pan and one loaf cooking stone. My metal pan finished in 50-55 min. and the stone one was ready in 55-60 min. Awesome recipe as is though. Thanks!

Very yummy! Instead of 2 cups zucchini, I did 1/3 cup of banana and 1 2/3 cup zucchini. Wasn't sure this combo would work but the kids love it! Thanks so much!

This bread is amazing!  Follow the recipe just as it is.  I tried to reduce the calories and it was still edible but not nearly as good as it was with the recommended ingredients.  Even my husband who hates zucchini loved it!

I was looking for something different to make with all of the zucchini that a friend was passing on to me. Tried this recipe and brought a couple of loaves to a large gathering and received great compliments on how much everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe, this is definately a keeper!

YUMMY!! This has become the most requested of all the baked items I make. The berries add a pop of flavor to the moistness of the zucchini. I will be making this often.

Not only is this instantly consumed at our house, but I've taken it many places.  It is always complimented, and there is rarely any left at the end.  I sprinkle some brown sugar on top before baking.  I've also baked it in two square Pyrex dishes and added a little time.

I had fresh blueberries to use, so I gave this recipe a shot-AMAZING. Dont even taste the zucchini, what a healthy way to keep this moist! I make this in muffin pans and throw a couple in ziploc bags and throw them in the freezer for breakfast or snacks on the go-just pop them in the microwave and they are yummy and warm all over again.   I used the recipe again with frozen blueberries, and it tasted amazing even still. Good to know i can make this all winter long. This is something I have to have in the freezer at all times!  -I also tried this recipe but added chocolate syrup, melted chocolate (unsweetened and bittersweet) and some mini chocolate chips-it was great! But i definitely think we love this with berries the best. Thanks for a great recipe!

Similar texture to banana bread.  I substituted 1c. frozen blueberried for fresh, decreased sugar to only have 1/4c. white sugar, 1/2c. packed brown sugar, 1/2c. splenda.  I also followed others and substituted half the oil for unsweetened applesauce, used half unbleached white flour and half whole wheat flour and decreased salt to 1/2tsp.  I thought this bread had great flavor and I will make it again (just with the healthier adjustments I made).

Very yummy and a keeper! I made this according to the recipe without any changes. This is the first time I have made zucchini bread, as this is also the first year I have zucchini in my garden.  What a great garden treat. I love the addition of blueberries, too. Next time, I would like to try the adapted version (applesauce substitution) and I would like to add CookingQueens crumb topping.

This was awesome! I made it for my first dinner in our new home for my fiance's parents, and the loved it! I was scared because I had to substitute almond milk and it did not rise, but still came out delicious--especially with vanilla ice cream.

After reading the reviews, this recipe was modified quite a bit from the original.  I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla extract (use the real thing, please), 1 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, 3 cups zucchini (left in a sieve to drain), and a bag of defrosted blueberries. Baked in two regular sized loaf pans.  Topped them with a crumb topping made up of 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tbsp flour, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp butter. Baked both pans at 350 for 1 hr.  Even after reducing the sugar and adding the crumb topping, it was still sweet so do not put in 2 1/4 cups sugar.  This bread is very moist and delicious.

Wish there were 6 stars for this recipe!  I used 3 cups of zucchini and one defrosted bag of blueberries as well as using 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white sugar.  A big hit.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! We grow our own zucchini and blueberries and were pleasantly surprised to find a recipe to pair the two. Don't skimp on the blueberries as you'll want to taste a blueberry in every bite of this yummy bread!

Never would have paired blueberries and zucchini myself, but they were great together and it got rave reviews from coworkers.

This was yummy and a great way to get some fruit and veggies in your diet. I made it a little healthier by using half whole wheat flour and half white. And also using unsweetened applesauce in place of half the oil. Cut the sugar down to 2 cups and then sprinkled about a teaspon each of sugar and brown sugar over the tops of both loaves. (Oh yeah, I used 2 9x5 inch loaf pans and baked for 1 hour).

I have a bumper crop of zucchini so I have been experimenting with a variety of zucchini recipes.  This once was excellent! I increased the amount of zucchini by 1 cup, substituted 1-1/2 cups of organic unsweetened apple sauce for the cup of oil, used 2 cups of brown sugar instead of white and added more blueberries. The result was a delicious moist cake rather than a bread. Kids will love it as you cannot detect the zucchini at all!

I made this recipe  and after reading some of the reviews, I substituted half whole wheat flour and half applesauce for the oil, upped the zucchini to 3 cups and reduced some of the sugar.  I baked the batter in two regular sized loaf pans and knew I had to increase the baking time but wasn't sure how much longer to bake the loaves.  One reviewer stated 70 minutes and another said to bake them for one hour twenty minutes.  I kept checking for doneness and after almost an hour and  a half, the tester looked like it was coming out clean and I was afraid the outside of the loaves would start burning if I left them in any longer so I took them out of the oven and let them cool.  Mu daughter came up to try some and cut a piece for herself and for me and the centre still seemed kind of doughy although we still ate it and it did  taste wonderful.  I don't know what went wrong.  The batter did seem kind of thin so I'm wondering if there was too much water in the zucchini.  I still gave the recipe 5 stars because the bread tasted so good.  I'll try it again and this time I'll try to squeeze out as much water as  I can out of the zucchini to see if that makes a difference.

I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat flour, mostly applesauce for the oil. I reduced the cinnamon by half and added more zucchini. I reduced the sugar by half and it was still sweeter than I like...I'll reduce it more next time. Yummy and will be better when less sweet

Excellent and easy recipe.  I would have only changed one thing - not as much sugar.  The blueberries I used were so sweet that I could have used 1/2 the sugar.    I will make this again and again; it was a kid and adult favorite!

Wow this turned out so yummy!  I brought it to my parents house and it was a big hit!  I did make a few changes:  used coconut oil instead, used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans, topped with cinnamon and sugar before placing in the oven. Will make this again for sure!

YUMMY!!!  I brought this over to a family get together and everyone raved about it!  The only thing I changed was cut the vegetable oil in half and seemed to be much lighter. Don't have mini loaf pans so I used 2 large loaf pans and baked it at 350 for 1 hr 20 min.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Great recipe, this one will be added to our favorites!

Fantastic bread!  I made it this past weeked to take out to the lake for a family get together and have had my family asking for the recipe!  I also made some slight changes.  Replaced the vegetable oil completely with apple sauce, cut the sugar back to 2 cups and bumped the zucchini up to 3 cups.  Also added the crumbly topping and some nutmeg.  Very moist and delicious!

We LOVED this bread at my house.  The only thing I did differently was to add a crumb topping made of equal parts flour, oatmeal, and brown sugar with cinnamon and enough smart balance to make the topping crumbly.

I made this recipe spur of the moment and was very pleased. I did take the suggestions of some of the others. I used 1/2 oil/applesauce, 1/2 white flour/wheat. I also used splenda instead of sugar. This is an easy delicious recipe.

Excellent recipe and a nice way to use some of that prolific zucchini. I add fresh or frozen raspberries or blackberries instead of blueberries. Truthfully, I use whatever is in my freezer or on sale at the grocery store. Very flexible recipe!

Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.  One of the best breads I've made.  I replaced my former blueberry bread recipe for this one.  Don't let the amount of cinnamon scare you.  It's perfect.  Bakes nicely as 2 regular size loaves or as the mini loaves.  I've made it both ways due to need.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I would give 4 1/2 stars. :) This was a good recipe. I used half applesauce , half oil to cut down on the fat and also 3/4 tsp almond extract and some freshly ground nutmeg to the mix. I used 2 1/2c white flour and 1/2c whole wheat flour. I topped it with some strudel made out of butter, brown sugar, a bit of flour, and a little cinnamon. I had enough for 5 mini loaves and baked for 50 minutes. Its a good way to get veggies and fruit.

I made 2 loaves out of the batter.  The bread was good, but not as moist as I expected it to be.  My family enjoyed it.

These are good.  I poured batter into 1-loaf and 1-pan lg. muffins. Used a crumb topping as suggested.  i also increased the zucchini by 1-Cup.  I used fresh-frozen blueberries, they held up well.   I have the muffins frozen individually for quick access.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I'd love to give this 3.5 stars.  I thought this was good, but was missing something.  Not sure what yet.  The flavors were good, but were overpowered by the tartness of the blueberries.  Not as good as my Mom's :)

This recipe was excellent. I ended up following another member's advice and I baked 2 full-sized loaves for 80 minutes. They turned out great. My 13 year old son ate one loaf by himself-in 24 hours! I will be making this over and over again!

This was delicious!  As recommended by other reviewers, I also made some substitutions..1/2 cup unsweet applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil for the oil, 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour and only used 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I made 2 dozen muffins with this mix and sprinked a little white/brown sugar mix over the top before baking.  Baked for about 25 minutes.  This recipe is great and will be used many times again!

Delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and upped the zucchini and topped with a crumb topping.  Glad I did!  I also upped the baking powder and made them into muffins (baked them for about 30 minutes).  I made them GF using GF flour (I use the one from the GF Gourmet) and 1 tsp of xantham gum.  Came out great!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I had very high expectations for this recipe, and decided to give it a try since I had an abundance of fresh homegrown zucchini on hand. The overall taste is good, but sort of dry, and I think a pint of blueberries is too much. The bread also stuck to the pans, which were thoroughly greased

Wonderful bread!  I just ate a warm muffin, and it was so delicious!  I would love to make the recipe as written, but I've recently lost 30 lbs., and want to keep it off!  So, like many others I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil, and I used 1 cup Splenda and 3/4 cup brown sugar, instead of the 2 1/4 cups of white sugar called for in the recipe.  I used frozen blueberries.  It made 8 mini loaves and 6 muffins.  I'm going to freeze the mini loaves and take them as a snack for the grandkids on a camping trip this weekend.

The previous reviewers were absolutely right. This is amazingly good. I made the suggested changes to make it less fattening; however, I wish I knew just how much these changes will make to the fat, fiber, and calorie counts. If anybody can help me out, I would appreciate it.

I used 6 egg whites, 1/2 c. of vegetable oil, 1/2 c. organic applesauce in place of some of the oil, 3/4 c. Splenda, 1 large mashed over-ripe banana in place of part of the sugar, all whole wheat flour and two tsp. each of baking powder and baking soda. I made one medium loaf and 12 muffins. My kids thought the muffins were great, I did gift the loaf and can't wait to hear what our neighbor thinks. Next time, I might add some orange zest and maybe some cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract. NOTE: I did smush the zucchini inbetween several layers of paper towels to drain the excess liquid. That helped quite a bit.

This is very tasty bread, although it's more a cake-like consistency.  You could easily make this in a 13x9 pan, frost it with cream cheese icing and have a great cake!

This was yummy and eating a warm slice right now. I followed others advise and cut the oil in half and substituted applesauce for the other half and added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg. Also used frozed blueberries so the batter didn't turn out purple. This is a very good recipe.

Delicious bread.  I have more zucchini that I need in my garden this year so I will be making this recipe a lot.  I used frozen blueberries that I picked at a local farm and they held their shape so much better.

YUMMY!  Made this with my 4 year old and so far, everyone in the house loves it.  Only change I made was to use 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil in place of the 1 cup oil.  Well, probably used a little more than 2 cups of shredded zucchini and a little over 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  We made 12 muffins (baked about 30 min) and 1 regular sized loaf (baked about 80 min).  Perfection!

Great recipe- made 24 muffins and cut cooking time to 20 minutes without any other changes to bread recipe.  Did mix 1 Tablespoon of sugar and 1 T of brown sugar to sprinkle over top of muffins as suggested by other reviewers.  We will make these again.

Lost this recipe years ago and I'm so happy to have found it again on this site. This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe as is. No need to make alterations. I get skeptical looks from people when I tell them what this bread is, followed by amazed delight after they've taken a bite and discover how good it is. It's actually quite funny to watch.  Thanks for posting.

This was really good. I made 2 loafs, so we ate one and I froze one. I later defrosted the frozen one and it tasted just  as good.

Everyone from great-grandma to my 2 year old liked this recipe.  I, as suggested by another, dusted my pans with cinnamon sugar before pouring the batter in.

Wouldnt change a thing! I use this omitting the blueberries for regular zucchini bread too, or even omit blueberries and add apples, cinnamon, and pecans which is very yummy too!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it several times, and each time I get different results.  It works best with freshly shred zucchini rather than frozen shred (I shred the zucchini and freeze it for use in the winter).  I have even made this using the Sneaky Chef guidelines (sweet potatoes for 1/2 the oil, egg substitute and whole wheat flour), and its delish!

I made 2 mini loaves, substituting 1/2 apple sauce for the oil, like some other reviewers.   Came out very  moist and delicious.

This was a very excellent  bread. The only thing I did wrong was fill the loaf pan to the top. It took way too long to cook. Still turned out delicious though.

This is really good and oh sooo moist!  I used 1 1/4 c. white sugar and 1 1/4 c. light brown sugar, which was 1/4 c. more sugar than the recipe called for. I cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp, which I thought was plenty. I didn't have any mini loaf pans so I baked in two bread pans. Wasn't sure what to make a topping of, so I just sprinkled a little brown sugar on top.I had to bake longer than 50 minutes, but I lost track of how much longer. I just kept testing it with a toothpick untill it seemed done liked a cake. The blueberries and zucchini sounded like a odd combo, but was supprisingly good.

This is a delicious recipe.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I felt that the amount of cinnamon overpowered the bread a little bit.  I would reduce it at least by half next time. I made two normal sized loaves and they ended up taking closer to 1 hour, 20 minutes. (!)  I also did half white, half whole wheat flourr (which I highly recommend!) and substituted half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I also ommitted 1/4 of the sugar and probably could have left out even more - it was still plenty sweet.  Always looking for ways to make recipes more healthy!

This bread is so delicious.My husband and I both really loved it.I made it exactly as written and I thought it was perfect.I love using the mini loaf pans to make bread in.It makes it a lot easier to get the middle done.The loaves turned out super moist and I loved the blueberries and zucchini together.Next time I may substitute half the oil for applesauce but other than that I won't change a thing.

Great zucchini bread recipe!  I've used this recipe exclusively since I found it.  If I don't have blueberries, I add an extra 2 cups of zucchini.  I also added frozen raspberries last time I made it and it turned out awesome!  I usually bake this in two regular bread pans rather than the mini-loaf pans.

I own a coffee shop and my patrons LOVED this bread. I substituted 1/2 unsweetened applesauce for the oil and it was still plenty moist and sweet. I didn't have fresh blueberries so I just threw in frozen ones and they were great.

I cut down the sugar, added half whole wheat flour, and increased the zucchini a little.  Delicicous! Moist, tasty and easy to make. I also used frozen wild blueberries, and they worked great.  Love it! We'll make it once a week or so for breakfasts.

This bread is outstanding!  It goes together easily and comes out perfect every time.  My family and friends love it, and they're always pleasantly surprised to learn that something that tastes so great contains both fruit AND vegetables!    I substituted half the vegetable oil with applesauce, and used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.

Excellent, I definately needed to add a little more bake time because I didn't drain the zucchini.  Held up well to the low fat substitutions i made.  Freezes very well!

This is an excellent recipe. The only tweaking I did was I substituted one cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour to add a bit more texture to this delicious bread! I will make this bread again and again and again! :-)

Yum, yum, yum.  LOVE this bread.  It turned out so moist and wonderful.  My 18 month old son can't get enough of it!  I did use raspberries instead of blueberries because they were on sale, but otherwise made just as directed.  Yum!

This recipe is definately a keeper. I substituted whole wheat for white flour, half brown sugar for white and half applesauce for oil. I made it in 2 9x5 loaf pans instead of the mini loaf pans & took one to work. It's a wonderful alternative to the traditional zucchini bread & everyone that tried it loved it.

This is the best bread recipe I've made yet! I took it to my MOPS breakfast meeting and everyone wanted the recipe! My modifications: I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I made a crumb topping based on some other reviewers ideas. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

WOW! This is amazing bread!! One of the best recipes I have ever taken from this website. The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar a little, but everything else was spot on!! The texture is very good and the cooking time is perfect! I actually had enough batter to make 4 mini loaves and  2 ramekins! Will 100% make again!!

Killer good!  I made it exactly to the recipe and my husband was crazy about it. I will make it again--maybe substitute half the oil with applesauce next time and try frozen blueberries when I can't get fresh in the winter.

This recipe is fantastic for someone who is not a huge fan of traditional zucchini bread, like myself. I used frozen blackberries and it turned out so good and SO moist!

Everyone loves this bread!  It is very moist and delicious.  I've made it several times and the loaves disappear quickly.  I made it with huckleberries instead of blueberries, added an extra cup of zucchini (you gotta get rid of the stuff somehow!) and used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar instead of the white sugar.  I've also made it without berries and it is wonderful plain zucc bread.  I also use 2 regular loaf pans.  This recipe is a favorite!

this is the best quick bread ever! i was at my grandpa's house, and he had a ton of blueberries and zucchini that he needed to use up, so i tried this recipe and added 3 cups zucchini and a pint and a half of blueberries and put it in two regular loaf pans and it came out so moist that it was almost like bread pudding! one and a half loaves vanished in less than 30 minutes! THIS IS A TOTAL KEEPER!!!!!!

Absolutely the best bread since banana walnut!! I made this with 3 cups of zucchini and a walnut crumb topping suggested by another reviewer. Mouth watering!! Very good fresh out of the oven. This made 5 mini-loaves. Perfect for a family breakfast or gathering. This will become a family favorite this holday season for sure!!

I had a bunch of blueberries that I bought on sale...so I made this for our bible study group ( I made sure that I tasted it before I unveiled it, just to be on the safe side!). Everyone was skeptical at first after all, the combination does sound a bit strange...but after tasting it everyone raved about it and a few people asked me to bring the recipe for them next week. This recipe made three regular sized loaves(I made them in the throw away aluminum pans). This one's a keeper,thanks!

Great Taste and Texture! I followed the recipe except for adding crushed walnuts. Baked it into a bunt pan which may be why it took twice as long to bake through?  Next time I will try replacing oil with applesauce and splenda for sugar.  Everyone in the family LOVES this recipe and my son has requested it be put into his recipe book for when he marries!!!!

Wonderful, moist muffins - makes 12 in paper liners.  Cut back on sugar, used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, added a little more cinnamon and baking powder.  Toppings suggested add to the muffins.

What a great combination. I used 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup applesauce and half the sugar, and it was still on the sweet side for me but delicious!

Thanks for sharing. This recipe is amazing!! I used only 1 Cup of zucchini because it was all I had and it still turned out wonderfully. I did take the advice of other reviewers and substituted 1/2 C. of Apple Sauce for half of the oil to cut down the calories and fat a bit. I'm so glad I stumbled across this recipe! This is one I'll make over and over again.

Everyone who has tasted this bread has loved it.  I did make a few changes, used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat, used 1/2 apple (or pear) sauce and 1/2 oil.  Put a strusel on the top and it is well loved.  My 1st grader loves to take this to school for her lunch instead of a sandwich.  Good and healthy and had been made lots this summer!  Thanks for sharing, it has become a favorite that has been shared alot!

I put this into two large pans instead of the smaller ones and cooked for about 55mins.  It came out great!  I also cut the sugar to only 1 cup and it still came out wonderful.  These breads were quick, easy, and delicious.

This was absolutely the best recipe for zucchini bread i have ever used! I made this with fresh blueberries and zucchini given to me from a friends garden and it was amazing. I brought one of the loaves to my company picnic and had many people asking me for the recipe. Some people who tried it didn't even like zucchini bread but after trying this said that they could eat it all day. I will definitely be making this again!

This is AMAZING.  I made it like another review suggested with 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 brown, and added a pinch of nutmeg.  I only had one bread pan on hand, so I took the rest of the batter and put it in a muffin pan, and baked for 15-20 mins.  They were great individual little breads!  Will make again and again.  Gave recipe to my mom and she loved it too.

A really lovely bread--so delicious! Kudos to Laujra! I made the recipe according to "cookiequeen"'s (Jul. 26, 2006) modifications, and I made a few other modifications myself: 1) I used half canola oil and half roasted hazelnut oil, which I think gave the bread a nice depth of flavor; 2) instead of the dash of nutmeg "cookiequeen" suggested, which I didn't have, I threw in a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice; and 3) to make it vegan, I subbed boxed egg replacer as well as some apple pureed with water (for moistness--a half cup of applesauce would also do) to replace the eggs, and I used vegan cold-pressed (non-trans-fat) margarine instead of the butter for cookiequeen's scrumptious crumb topping. Eight mini-loaves took 35 minutes to bake in my oven. Thanks! My friends, family, and I are all enjoying these delicious little loaves.

So good and so moist!  You'd never know there is zucchini in this bread!  I subbed half the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups.  I also added an extra cup of zucchini.  I like to peel my zucchini so the little ones don't see the green specks.  I topped mine with an easy streusel topping to give it a little extra crunch.  I combined 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, two tablespoons of butter and a few dashes of cinnamon.  I sprinkled it over the bread before baking.  This recipe made one full sized loaf plus one six-inch cake pan.  I baked the cake pan for about an hour, while the loaf pan took about 70+ minutes to bake.

Very good. I increased the zucchini to 3 1/2 cups because that is what it yielded, reduced sugar to 2 cups and used applesauce for 1/2 the oil.  I am on my second piece now and it is so moist and tasty.

after reading other reviews, I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and I also added only 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 allspice. 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 buttermilk and OMG!!!  This was absolutely to die for!  I made another version after awapping out the zucchini with 4 ripe bananas and putting on a pecan strusel topping.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I would give this more stars if I could.

Hmmm...  One of the best quick breads ever!  I baked it in one larger loaf for about 10 extra minutes and it was great!  Perfect way to get a little extra fruit in and use up the 400 pounds of zucchini in the backyard right now!

This is a wonderfully moist and tasty bread. My whole family loved it. I did substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the 1/4 cup of white sugar. It was very good but it did make the bread brown. I also always grease and then sprinkle sugar my pans to give a nice crunch to the crust on sweet breads.

I usually don't care for zucchini bread, but this was WONDERFUL!  I made as the directions stated and made 1 large loaf of bread and 12 regular muffins.  Will definitely make again!

Amazing!  If you're short on time, use mini-muffin tins; baking is done in 15 mins. I cooked at 325 degrees convection (375 reg oven) for 15 minutes.  Loved the 1/2c oil, 1/2 c applesauce & 2 c sugar + 1/4 brown sugar option.  My kids LOVE these and the mini muffins are perfect for them-no slicing.  No one detected the zucchini.

This recipe is so good!  I made two large loafs and baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I also substituted blueberries for fresh huckleberries, and used organic sugar.  I took a loaf to work and it was gone before noon.  This one is a keeper.

So, so good!  I made a loaf and also made muffins, I baked the muffins for 25 minutes, the loaf took longer to cook than the recipe stated, I must have filled the pan a little more than intended, it was 35 minutes for that to bake.  Will most certainly make again.

Followed the recipie as is and wouldn't change a thing.  A great way to use up the extra zucchini from the garden.  The bread is VERY moist and freezes well.  If freezing, I highly recommend placing the bread on a baking sheet in the freezer for a few hours first.  Once bread has formed a 'brick' use a food saver bag that sucks out any remaining air before storing for good.

It's ridiculous how fast this went.  I made muffins and bread and everyone has scarfed them down and asked for the recipe.  I made a few healthy changes:  used 1/2 applesauce for the oil, 3 cups zucchini, 1 1/2c. white flour, 3/4 c. whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup wheat germ.  Still delicious and moist.

These were WONDERFUL! I "healthified" them as usual, with the following modifications: used 1 1/3 all purp flour, 1 c whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup buckwheat flour, and 1/3 ground oats (oat flour). I also added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed AND 1/4 cup oat bran. I used the juice AND rind of 1 lemon (my modifications made the dough thicker and stickier, so I needed additional liquid). I love lemon and blueberries together! Even with all of these changes, the texture and taste were out of this world .. even my husband, who doesn't care for baked sweets, ate 4 of them soon after they came out of the oven!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and my family and friends went wild.  After making it several times in one week due to a bumper crop of zuchinni I did make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and got 5 regular loaves of bread.  When I doubled the recipe I reduced the oil to 1 1/3 cup and it did not change the bread texture or taste but made me feel healthier.  Great recipe and now the first one I reach for when zucchini is out of control!

This recipe is excellent - a great way to use up zucchini from the garden.  I did make a few minor changes as others did:  only added 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 c canola oil and equal parts white and wheat flour.  I also made it in a bundt pan and baked at 350* for 1 hour.  The taste and texture are wonderful and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good!  I put it in a large loaf pan and large cupcake tins since I didn't have mini loaf pans. The cupcake tins took about 20 minutes while the larger loaf pan took much longer than the 50 min.

The bread is delicious in-and-of-itself, and truly does not need the "topping" suggested by other reviewers. However, if you choose to add the topping, a word of warning . . . the batter fills these mini-loaf pans to the very top, and the bread mounds nicely (almost overflowing) over the tops of the pans. IF you add the topping, it may be too much for the loaves to hold, so consider a fifth mini-loaf pan to hold all that batter and topping.

An unbelievable zucchini bread recipe. I even subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil to make it lower fat and it was SO moist! I also used frozen raspberries instead of blueberries. My kids love this recipe. I did muffins, baked 35 minutes; and a large loaf, 1 hour, 20 minutes, at the same time. Everything was perfect! Thank you!

I was given a torpedo sized zuke and a half bucket of blueberries on the same day. Found this recipe with it's rave reviews and just had to try it. I did it exactly as written except I put it into two regular sized bread pans and I think I probably added more berries because I didn't actually measure them! It turned out really good! My husband and kids like it too but I suspect he'll be the one to eat the whole thing. Next time I will try it with the crumble topping and maybe some nuts in the mix and see what happens. Oh, and mine stuck to the pan evne though I buttered it liberally.

Excellent! I followed reviewers' recommendations and used half white flour/half whole wheat flour as well as half brown sugar/half white sugar. I also made a crumb topping. In the future, I will use less sugar as the cake gets quite sweet with the topping. I made one large loaf and baked it for 45 min at 350 degrees in a convection oven.

I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and mixed brown and white sugar together.  Didn't have enough blueberries so I add chopped fresh peaches.  I also added walnuts.  Good, basic receipe for all that extra zucchini around this time of year.

Easy and very tasty! I added extra cinnamon, less sugar and some nutmeg. I got a full loaf and about 9 muffins, delicious. I live at higher elevation so the cooking time was a little bit longer than listed here. I also subbed applesauce for half the oil and can taste no difference, what a great recipe!

I will use this recipe over & over again. It is so good and moist. I used my first zucchini from the garden, and halved all the ingredients, except eggs (I used two), and made one large loaf. I had to bake it 10-15 min. longer than the smaller loaves called for, but it came out perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best bread ever!  My neighbor gave me some zucchini the other day and I came across this recipe on this website.  With everyone giving it 5 stars I knew it had to be good and I was right.  I am 9 months pregnant and this recipe hits the spot!

I made 24 muffins, baked for 35 to 40 min. and will make again. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I usually put nuts & mini chocolate chips in my zucchini and banana bread and I forgot this time but they still tasted great. I will use this recipe again.

I made muffins instead of bread, My entire family loved them. My two 10 year old daughters said they were the best blueberry muffins they had ever had-neither had any idea zucchini was an ingredient!

Even after we finished this bread, I don't understand the benefit of the zucchini (green squash) except to temporarily turn the raw batter green. I used strawberries to make up my blueberry shortage. I also mixed the strawberries & blueberries w/ honey and then added them to the batter...the dessert/breakfast cake hot/cold was delicious...gone in record time. Good recipe, the honey increased the moistness changing the bread more into a cake    :)

Loved this recipe. Perfect for using two ingredients so readily available at the same time of year. Great for gift giving. I think I'll try some of the healthy substitutions suggested by reviewers next time, but it was wonderful just as written. I did have to adjust baking time for my oven to 1 hr and 20 min.

I made this recipe as written, except I didn't have mini loaf pans, so I used 1 regular loaf pan and 2 muffin pans. I took the muffins out about 20 minutes before the bread, and both turned out great. The blueberries really add something special to the recipe.

This was a very good bread.  I made exactly as written and it was a sweet, moist bread.  The addition of blueberries was great and added a nice dimension to the flavor.

I made this as written however, I baked in two glass bread pans.  I had to increase the cook time to about 65 minutes.  My husband liked this but the kids and I didn't care for it.  I like the idea of adding fruit and veggies to bread however, I didn't feel like this flavor combo worked for me.  The blueberries were good by themselves however added to such a sweet zucchini bread, they tasted very tart in the mix.  I also thought that maybe too much zucchini was used and made the bread too moist.  A day or two after making this, the bread was mushy and had a lot of liquid seeping from it.  I typically make zucchini bread with just 1 cup grated zucchini.  With the addition of fruit, I don't think 2 cups of zucchini is needed.  I prefer the traditional zucchini bread however I may try again with sweetened fruits and less zucchini.

Perfect! Very moist and flavorful bread. Made exactly as stated, except for using frozen blueberries and 2 regular size loaf pans. I have made ALOT of zucchini bread and this is one of the very best recipes I've used! Wonderful! Wouldn't change the recipe at all!

Everyone likes this bread.  It's very moist.  I often use frozen shredded zucchini (thaw and squeeze out water first) and blueberries.  Also, I subbed apple sauce for half the oil and use a little less sugar.  As one review suggested, I also mixed up some flour, sugar, cinnamon, oats, & butter to make a crumble for the top (about 1-1.5 Tbsp of each).  It can make 2 full loaves of bread instead of the 4 small ones the recipe calls for if you prefer larger loaves.

This is one of my favorite breads to make every summer. Next time, I will take other's advice for 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil since the calorie content is quite high! I hope it works out :o)

I used 1/2 cup less sugar and instead of oil I used apple sauce.  It still tasted absolutely wonderful.  My kids didn't even notice that they were eating zucchini. I make this whenever I have blueberries.

This is a great quick bread!  My husband loved it!  I only had about 1.5 cups of zucchini, so I added a few extra blueberries.  I used 1 cup applesauce instead of oil and used egg substitute.  It came out great!  The bread does rise, so don't overfill the the pans.

This was probably the best bread I have ever made.  The only problem was the baking time was different everytime I made this due to the water content in the zucchini.  I actually thought a loaf was done, toothpick can out clean, took it out of the oven and it fell like a rock.  Totally undercooked and ruined.  Anyway I highly recommend giving this recipe a try it is delicious, but bake it longer than you think it needs.  No fun to throw underbaked bread in the garbage.

Delicious and moist. I made it in a 9x13 cake pan with great results. Baked it for about an hour. I did top with a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, white & brown sugars as others suggested. I usually don't mess with a recipe I haven't tried before, luckily it was very good. I'll be baking this again, perhaps with a bit more zucchini next time as was also suggested.

I doubled the batter because I had enough zucchini and blueberries.  I made four mini loaves, and two regular loaves.  The mini loaves baked 50 minutes and the regular loaves baked 55 minutes.  I used fresh blueberries and coated them in flour before putting them into the batter.  They were evenly disbursed in the batter.  The bread turned out perfect ... thanks for a great recipe.

This bread was amazing!! Like eating zucchini bread and blueberry muffins at the same time. The first loaf was gone in a day! Thanks for the great recipe! Update: I like my loaves a bit bigger so I changed the servings to 16 (still easy to measure) and baked in two 9x5 pans. This serving size gives you a loaf that tops the pan. I baked mine for 1 hr, 20 min, but I would check them a few minutes earlier. Trust me, you'll appreciate the extra because this is incredibly yummy bread & it goes fast!

I made this bread for a party and it was a HIT! The only thing I changed to the recipe was cutting back on the sugar. I used 2 cups and could probably cut back another 1/4 cup. It's a wonderful recipe, quick, easy & delicious.

This is so good! My husband who doesn't really get into quick breads requests this and after he's done we are lucky to get a piece.  I have made this also with a bag of frozen mixed berries and we still loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

What is not to like? The bread itself has a great cinnamon taste.  I made it in to reg. loaf pans and simply adjusted the cooking time a bit.

Tasted fine, but I think I'd prefer blueberry muffins for my blueberries, and normal zucchini bread for my zucchini.
That said, I did use half and half sugar and splenda, and half and half oil and applesauce.

This was so good - I had a pint of blueberries and a zucchini from the CSA and was looking for something to do with this.  On a whim, I decided to sub lemon extract for the vanilla and add lemon zest.  It was wonderful!  I made 2 full size loaves and brought one to work, where it was immediately decimated.

Fabulous as is; my husband refuses to eat vegetables in 'sweets', but he decided he liked this! The tip of rolling the fresh berries in some of the flour mixture helps them from discoloring the batch and melt slowly through the loaf.

I cut the sugar down -1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c white granulated sugar. I used half of the oil and added 1/2 c canned pumpkin. I used half white, half wheat flour. Delicious!

OMG.....I have always baked zucchini bread for at Christmas,but I never thought about adding blueberries before, I had plenty in my freezer..This is a great recipe, I did use 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda, I think I will try whole wheat flour next time to see how that goes.  I husband has to watch the sugar,but this is great...

This recipe is an easy and delicious variation of traditional zucchini bread.  I do change the sugar a bit...I use 1 and 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown to complete the amount of sugar needed.  Like others, I also just make two regular sized loaves rather than the 4 mini loaves.  My kids ( 6 yrs and 3 yrs) absolutely love this bread as did eveyone else that was lucky enough to get a loaf!  I must have made this recipe at least 6 times this summer, as it is a wonderful way to enjoy all of that zucchini that you just seem to end up with.  I HIGHLY recommend giving this bread a shot - you won't be disappointed!

This is wonderful. I upped the amount of zucchini, added a few more blueberries, used both all purpose and whole wheat flour, and cut the sugar just a bit. It came out a little too moist, but I think that was my fault, not the recipe's. I topped it with an oatmeal crumb topping, which just made it even more delicious. I will be making this again.

This is my 3rd time making this recipe and just noticed something. The first 2 times I made this I used a small grater to grate the zucchini and it was more watery and this last time I used a larger grater and it was less liquidy cuting the cooking time a little. I also made muffins as I haven't bought the small loaf pans but I'm sure it would have turned out great in the large loaf pan as it was more dry then the first time. I used raspberries this time around too and YUMMY!!!!! My girls ate them up.

OMG.  This is the best ever.  I might try to add a little glaze to the top to make it even sweeter.  But what a great find as is.

I had a HUGE zucchini and needed something to make with it so I found this.  We had a pint of blueberries that needed to be used soon, so I thought it was worth a shot!

This turned out SO moist and delicious.  I was out of vanilla so I substituted almond extract, just half as much.  I only had one large muffin pan so I baked the remaining batter in a 9x9 pan and it came out great in the 50 mins bking time.  I did need to bake the large loaf pan longer though - closer to 70 mins.  It turned out great and I will definitely make it again!  I might try applesauce next time in place of some of the oil and maybe cut the sugar with a part of Splenda.  We'll see!

Made this bread as muffins(makes 2 dozen)this morning. They were great! As I read others' reviews, I decided to change things a bit. I used half whole wheat flour/half white,only 2 cups of sugar (that was still plenty sweet),and added a dash of nutmeg. I used muffin liners and baked them at 400 degrees until the center was done. I really thought the combination of blueberries and zucchini was odd, but it's actually very good together...and good for you! Thanks for this recipe..it'll stay in my collection!

Very good recipe! 

I made muffins, here is what I did differently-

I used 3 tsp. of baking powder, although less would have still been okay I think.

I substituted half the oil with 2 mashed bananas (which I had in the freezer and just defrosted for 55 seconds.)

I used a little more zucchini- about 2.5 cups. 

Baked for about 23 minutes. I made 18 large muffins and 12 mini muffins.

At first I wasn't so sure about them, but once they cooled down they were great!!

This bread is excellent!  My husband and I loved it so much that I made another batch a week later.  I did make one loaf in a standard size bread pan which came out fine but I had to cook it longer (about 15 minutes).  Because the bread is so moist, it made it difficult to cut the larger loaf so the next time I stuck with the mini loaf pans.  Either way, it was delicious.

Delicious little loaves!  I followed other reviews and replaced half the oil with applesauce, used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour, and replaced half the sugar with brown sugar.

Everyone I have made this recipe for has loved it! Following the advice of other reviewers, I combine white and brown sugar to get the amount called for, same with white and whole wheat flour. I half the recipe and make muffins with a crumb topping made of a couple pinches of white and brown sugar and crushed Special K flakes. Yummy!

Very, very good!  I followed the recipe precisely.  Well, except that I made muffins instead of bread loaves.  They turned out perfect, and delicious.  They are moist and flavorful.  This recipe will be added to my box of favorites.

Oh My!!  Added extra zuc, apple sauce, spice, needed to add 1/2 C flour extra because it was so loose, but cooked up perfect texture in 11 x 13 pan.  It was gone before it was cooled.  I will plant extra zuc's next season, there simply isn't enough!!

I followed the suggestions of several others and substituted 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce for the 1c oil, as well as using only 2 1/2c sugar. I also made large muffins b/c they work better for my husbands needs for a quick breakfast. Oven temp stayed the same and the cooking time was about 15-20min. My family absolutely loved them! This one is a keeper.

What a great combination.  I love blueberries.  I used 2 reg loaf pans for 1 hr and 10 min.  Just a tip- 2 cups zucchini is 2 zucchini, and 1 pint of blueberries is 2 cups.  I decreased the sugar and used half brown sugar.  I used all whole wheat flour to make it healthier.  I squeezed the moisture out of the zucchini like others suggested.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made mini loaves and it took on a muffin like texture and taste.  I also subsituted 1/2 of the eggs with milled flax seed to add nutriution and cut the fat.  I also used apple sauce instead of oil to reduce the fat.

This was amazing! I did make a few changes. We went huckleberry picking last weekend so I substituted those and used 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 white flour. I used less sugar by using 1 1/4C white sugar and 3/4C brown sugar. I used 1/2C of applesauce and 1/2C of vegetable oil. It was very moist and delicious! Everyone gobbled it up!

AWESOME!!!!! This was the best bread I have ever made, I did a few slight adjustments. I tossed in a couple extra berries and 1.5X more cinnamon and also substituted 3/4 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. YUMMY, Will make this again for sure!

I made this bread last night and brought it into work this morning and have 4 people ask me for recipe.  It is so moist and the flavor of the blueberries add to the zucchini.  Its a keeper

Very tasty.  Instead of making a loaf, I decided to make mini muffins as I was serving a continental breakfast with other baked goods for a number of people.  They took only 15 minutes to bake and yield 36 muffins.

I'm nine months pregnant, so I have an excuse:), but my whole family inhaled two regular loaves of this wonderful bread in 2 days! I did use half veg. oil/half applesauce and used 1 cup white, 1 cup brown sugar. Although my husband was wierded out by the thought of zucchini an dblueberries, he really loves it - my son(5) and I loved it warmed up with lite cool whip spread on top---SO good!! Am making several more loaves for neighbors who are donating zucchini.

This bread is awesome the first time i made it, it made 5 little loaves and well let's just say i only got the chance to give 1 away (I ate the rest!!!)  They're delicious.  I know it may sound like an odd combination but the zuchini makes it very moist and the blueberries give it a scrumptious little tang.  **My anti fruit husband though thought it would be better with chocolate chips**  I'd have to disagree.

Really Yummy...I will decrease the sugar next time--found it a bit sweet.  I did change it a bit....
1 cup white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup soy flour
1 1/2 cup white sugar (will cut by 1/2 cup next time)
3/4 cup brown sugar
I used frozen blueberries and did have to increase the baking time
Very nice loaf!

Followed recipe pretty close, may have added a little more Zucchini.   I also added a cup of walnuts.   Superb !  Definitely will make again.

Made 2nd. time with other berries.  Just as good, but liked the blueberry better.  Walnuts really help a lot. 
Excellent recipe

I thought this bread was ok.  Everyone who tasted it though really liked it. The only change I made was using 1/2 cup grated apples along with 1 1/2 cups zucchini (that's all the zucchini I had).  It was definitely moist.  Took a lot longer to bake than the recipe suggests.  Maybe using part brown sugar along with the granulated sugar would improve the flavor.  I might make it again with a few changes.

Fantastic and Tasty!!  I double the blueberries and didn't really measure out the zucchini(so there was probably more then 2 cups).  I also went off other suggestions and made a crumb topping using sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I really like the taste of this recipe - 2 pints of berries was probably too much, but 1 pint would not be enough for my taste!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was absolutely delicious. We told my niece who is very picky that they were blueberry muffins. She asked for more. Now she is willing to try anything with zukes in it!! I modified the recipe as others did. The topping made it look so much better as we made some with and some without. I also made it with olive oil and it came out fine. We live in high altitude. I put some extra flour in it and it did have to cook much longer. Thanks for such a GREAT recipe.

Very good recipe with no changes at all.  I made these into 22 muffins, baking them for 30 minutes - until the tops were lightly browned.  They came out perfectly.  When properly cooled, the top was crunchy and the inside texture was very nice. Okay. So I cheated and ate the first one warm and fresh out of the oven.  I like the idea of another person who suggested adding a pinch of nutmeg to this recipe.  I think I'll do that the next time.  In the meantime, I'll simply eat all the ones I've already made...or perhaps I'll share them. There's no way anyone is going to know there is zucchini in these muffins unless they spy a speck of green here and there! :-)

I was looking for a different zucchini bread recipe and found it. This was delish! I made it in 4 mini Pampered Chef pans, but I think I could have used 5. I also put waxed paper  in the bottom of the pans and sprayed with Pam to help from sticking.

This recipe is definitely a keeper but will probably add less blueberries and more zucchini next time.  I did as others suggested and used 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and did 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of splenda.  I also omitted the cinnamon but that is just because of my personal preference.  All in all a great recipe that you can make into a healthy treat with just a couple substitutions and the best part is the kids don't realize they are eating fruits and veggies!

I baked this bread yesterday and it was delicious.  The first time I always follow the directions exactly and the only change I would make is adding less cinnamon as someone else stated.  It is still good but was a little too much for us.  I used three loaf pans rather than the mini pans.  They came out perfect and are so moist.  I will make this THE zucchini bread recipe in my home.

As Rachael Ray would say, "Yumm-O!" I was anxious to eat this right when it came out of the oven, so I ate it warm last night, and it was delicious, but I just finished eating a piece today for breakfast, and it's even better! Like many others, I healthified it: I halved the recipe and used one regular size loaf pan, used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil, used 1 cup of sugar and 1 egg. I also didn't have baking powder, but I don't think it made a difference (what is the purpose of baking powder anyway?). I also used 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries and it is chock full of them -- delicious! Thanks for the recipe, it's a definite keeper and will probably be made for holiday gifts at the office in mini loaf form.

A few changes: I added walnuts, 1/2 c oil with 1/2 c applesauce, only 1 1/2 c sugar and 2 more tsp vanilla. My husband said he could just eat the batter by itself. They are shockingly blue, but so delicious. The zucchini makes it!

This is truly a great zucchini recipe and believe me, I've tried my share. I made it in 2 loaf pans, and cut out 1/4 c. of the sugar (I'll use even less next time). It ends up tasting just like blueberry-muffin-bread, but it's an excellent way to use up zucchini AND make something a bit healthier/dairy-free!

Made these as muffins and they were very good.  Made the struesel topping suggested in one of the comments and it was a needed touch.  The struesel recipe made twice what I needed and next time will half the amounts. Also reduced the oil and the sugar as suggested.  Will make again.

this was very good - just the right amount of cinnamon - although i did not really care for the blueberries - luckily i didn't put a whole pint in so it was okay - i would make this again - but only as regular zucchini bread without the blueberries - one other reviewer said they added lemon extract in place of the cinnamon - if i did that next time i would go ahead and use the blueberries - but blueberries and cinnamon is not a good combo to me.

Just got done baking this bread.  It is a very good, moist bread.  A nice way to use some of the bumper crop of zucchini and yet please those who don't necessarily like zucchini.  The zucchini provides a nice moist crumb to a basic blueberry muffin-type batter. One thing, I used both aluminum and glass and had some problems with sticking.

With an over abundance of zucchini in our garden I was looking for a good recipe for zucchini bread! FOUND IT!!! I didnt have the little loaf pans so instead I made them into muffins and baked them for 20 minutes.   Very good.  I would just add a tad more sugar the next time as my family likes things on the sweeter side!  Thank you for a great treat!!!

I doubled the recipe and made 2 large loaves which turned out just beautiful!!  Made no changes and it was by far the moistest zucchini bread I've ever made.  Who'd have thought-blueberries and zucchini??  Yabba Dabba Delicious!!!
Thanks for a new family fave!!

Due to dietary restrictions in our multi-generational household I made these as follows: used monk fruit and coconut sugar (1c each), rice flour, GF baking mix and tiger but flour (1c each) and 2 VERY ripe bananas instead of the oil. Topped with a monk fruit / cinnamon sugar.

This is a staple at my house. I use a combination of white flour and whole wheat flour instead of just all white flour. I also make multiple loaves when my blueberries and zucchini are in season (since I grow both). I also freeze them, after they're cooled and wrapped several time.  You can also substitute yellow squash instead of zucchini.

Instead of muffins  I chose to bake it as a cake in my cast iron skillet serving it as a breakfast coffee cake.

I also added chopped almonds, extra berries, zucchini and flour.
  
Instead of the full sugar amount I went with 1 3/4 cups, though I will take that down to 1 1/4 cups next time.

I made this in two bread pans and extended the time. It is very moist and is more like a blueberry muffin than bread. I also used 2 cups of frozen blueberries. I still dusted them with flour to prevent them from sinking.

I have already made this bread several times. It is wonderful. My husband loves it. I made it in disposable pans so I could freeze them for the winter. Well that fell through because my husband has been taking loaves of this bread to work every week. I started with 10 loaves in the freezer and now have none. That is how yummy this bread really is.

Made it with 2 cups frozen blueberries and 2 tbsp cinnamon.  Soooo yummy! did it in 2 large bread pans, took a bit longer to bake  had to broil it a bit as it was a bit wet up top. I kept checking in on it to not burn it

This turned out great! I did this in muffin tins however, which freezes greatly and is easy to pull a few out at a time for bite-size portions.

It was absolutely fantastic.  I followed what the other reviewers said about extra zucchini. I also added some ground flax.  I tried freezing it but it’s not lasting as everyone, mostly my husband is eating it.   Great recipe

I used only 2 cups of sugar and did half and half white and brown.also used my homemade applesauce for half of the oil
I folded the zucchini ( which I squeezed the moisture from) in to the flour mix and I dusted my fresh but frozen blueberries with a bit of flour.made mini mini breads and mini loaves got 8miniminis and 4 mini's.made a streusel topping also
Cooked in convection oven mm took 25 min. And the minis took 30 mins. Thank you for a great recipe

Use suggestion of 3 cups of zucchini, use brown sugar and white sugar and butter and oil. Use the regular loaf pans and maybe mini muffins

Excellent recipe for a breakfast bread.  I made a double batch and used 1 cup brown sugar for the sweetener and added sliced almonds.   It made 14 mini bread loaves that are now gone.

This is an outstanding recipe! I've made it several times,  and have  had several requests to share it with people who've tasted it at church functions.  I use 3 cups of zucchini and  press as much liquid out as I can. I use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 1/4 cups white sugar.  Everything else is the same as original recipe.  It makes 3 loaves 8 x 8 3/4 foil pans.

I made it in two regular size loaf pans instead of the mini ones.  3 people ate both loaves in 3 days so I made 2 more.  Big hit here!

This bread is absolutely the bomb. ( in a good sense) I’ve been baking for 40+ years and this bread is one of the best zucchini breads that I’ve eaten.   I add  about a nice rounded teaspoon  or so of lemon zest to the wet ingredients.

Like others, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil  I used 2 cups WW flour and 1 cup white.  I omitted cinnamon and changed the vanilla extract to almond extract.  I reduced the sugar slightly to 2 cups but will reduce further next time.  I also made it into 2 loaves.  It turned out great and I will make it again!

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I also tweaked it up a bit.   It was good....but thought it could be even better.   So I got out my other zucchini bread recipes and tried it again.
I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup oil with 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/4 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 cups zucchini,   2  cups white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking powder, 3/4 tsp. baking soda, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2-2 cups blueberries and/or aronia berries.   Aronia have less sugar and very high with intoxicants, but only had 1/2 cup at the time.   This time I just combined about 1/2 Tbsp. of white sugar and brown sugar with about 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to sprinkle on the top of the loaves.   Not much variation to my 1st go around but I do really like this and will follow it again next time.   Zucchini bread is rather boring and sometimes dry but with the added 1 cup (I did not squeeze it the 2nd time), cutting back on the flour and the blueberries....so very good!

I made this recipe with a few changes. 1/2 C of butter and a 1/2 c of oil. I also substituted 1/4 c white sugar for brown. I added nutmeg and sour cream because it seemed like it wasnt wet enough. I also took half the batter and added chocolate chips instead of blueberries. I think that it was good but not enough zucchini and too much cinnamon.

Unfortunately, did not have the mini loaf pans. Used two standard recyclable aluminum loaf pans and sneaked in a small hand full of chocolate chips. Very yummy

No changes. Tasted wonderful; the whole fam enjoyed it immensely. It does rise pretty heftily, so make sure you leave about a half inch when you're filling each pan. Had some batter leftover and just make 10-12 mini muffins, same oven temp for about 13-15 minutes.

Super great recipe! I used slightly less sugar, a bit more zucchini, and frozen blueberries instead of fresh (used what I had on hand) it turned out moist and delicious. The kiddos love this in the lunch box for a snack or for a quick breakfast with milk.

Turned out amazing! As others suggested, I used 3 cups zucchini, 2 cups sugar, 1/4cup brown sugar, and added nutmeg. I didn’t realize the recipe was for 2 loafs (2 8x4 pans) so I had poured all of it in one deep 8x4 pan...still turned out great! Baked for 1 1/2 hrs on 350F. I loosely covered the pan with foil after 50 min to avoid the top from browning too much. Can’t wait to try it with the whole-wheat modification next time. There will definitely be a next time!

This bread is so amazing. So heavenly soft yet moist and you would never guess there's a vegetable in it. It is nice and sweet but I can see people lowering the amount of sugar, it would still be amazing. I will be making this over and over.

This is a great recipe - we love the blueberries in it. Makes it extra moist and flavorful. I did use less sugar only 1.5 cups and then 1/2 cup brown sugar. Next time I make it I will only use one cup white sugar and then the half cup of brown sugar as the bread is still sweet.

I have made zucchini bread before but never blueberry.  My husband, who is a little picky, tried it and just loved it.  Now whenever I say I am going to make zucchini bread he always asks if it is going to be blueberry.

Delicious!  I used part whole wheat flour for the flour, and part brown sugar for the sugar.  Used a combo of vanilla extract and almond extract because I didn’t have enough vanilla.  Then had to add walnuts because, well, everything must have nuts. ??.  I would never have guessed there is zucchini in this bread if I hadn’t made it.

The whole fam loves it. I make it with two slightly bigger pans and create 2 loaves total. Bake it for a few extra minutes to account for the larger pans, but best bet is always to do the toothpick trick and see if it comes out clean.

I made this and it is delightful. I did add 1/2 cup grated apple and I floured the blueberries, otherwise I didn't change anything in the recipe. I did top with brown sugar, flour, oatmeal, cinnamon and butter topping as suggested by someone else. Remember if you do that, you need to line your pan with parchment paper to get the loaf out easily. Very good!

I did enjoy this and I followed some of the other reviewers advice and upped the zucchini to 3 cups and I baked them regular loaf pans. It took quite a while to bake and next time I think I will try and squeeze the zucchini a bit drier first. I still have like 10 zucchini's to use up so I will see how that goes with those adjustments.

I used 2 regular sized metal loaf pans and baked for 60-70 min, rotating the pans half way through. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it's amazing. A warm slice with butter....

Used frozen blueberries and it turned out great. Have made twice - once using all the sugar and once replacing about a third of the sugar with stevia. Both turned out excellent.

This recipe, as written deserves five stars and I have made it in the past following the recipe exactly.  Well, yesterday my neighbor gave me four giant zucchinis so I decided I would make this delicious bread.  Unintentionally what started out as a few minor changes (I wanted to make a healthier version so I substituted apple sauce for the oil and used half white half whole wheat flour) turned into multiple changes to the recipe.  I had a taste for lemon blueberry bread so I added a teaspoon of lemon extract and some lemon zest.  Then, oops, I accidentally put in almond extract instead of vanilla extract.  I did not have fresh blueberries but I had a bag of dried blueberries that I needed to use up so I used those.  I was not sure how the almond lemon cinnamon blueberry combination would turn out but it is delicious.  Thank you for publishing a truly five star recipe - one that is not only excellent as written, but is also forgiving enough to handle a few mistakes.

I love this recipe and it’s flexibility! I use spelt flour instead of all purpose, I only put in 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, but then I sprinkle brown sugar on top and I use apple sauce instead of oil! Huge hit with the family

Very moist and delicious. I cut sugar by half a cup. May cut it even more next time. Used 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups all purpose flour. My tablespoon of cinnamon was overflowing. Good texture and flavor.

I made this recipe for a brunch party, and it was a hit! just enough cinnamon, sweetness and perfect texture. I don't like baking in the summertime as it heats up the house, but this recipe is very much worth it!

Delicious!  It sounds like a weird combination but it tastes so good.  I followed the directions, the only change was I made it in two large loaf pans.  Thanks for the recipe

Very sweet recipe. You could probably reduce the sugar if that is your taste.  I baked it in two loaf pans, so the bake time needed to be extended.

I made this last night. I really liked it a change to the average zucchini bread. My girls prefer my regular zucchini bread so they were disappointed when they saw it come out of the oven. However they both have eaten it. This recipe was enough for two loaves. I’d make it again.

It tastes great and is moist.  However,  it stuck to the pan and all the berries fell to the bottom.  Next time I will use parchment paper.  I used two loaf pans rather than  minies.

It was delicious !  I made it exactly as directed, but used 2 regular loaf pans.  We liked it so well, I decided to make more, but substituted fresh peaches I had for the blueberries.  DELICIOUS!

Normally, I make the recipe, as written, the first time and change various items on the second attempt.  However, I will not change anything from this recipe.  Perfect as it is!  My batter yielded enough for two normal-size loaf pans and I had to bake it a little longer due to this reason.  Instead of 50 minutes, I kept it in the oven for an additional 25 minutes.  It still slightly "jiggled" on top, but the edges were brown.  As the loaf cooled, it continued to cook and turned out exceptionally moist!  I used fresh blueberries as I felt that frozen ones would add additional water.

I made Muffins with this recipe using the advice of the reviews and replacing half of my oil with applesauce.  They came out amazing!  This was my first time baking with zucchini and fresh blueberries and I’m just thrilled with how they turned out.

Four stars because I did make a few of changes. I replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and reduced the sugar 1/2 cup and used part white and part brown sugar.  I will make this again and reduce the sugar more.  It was still a bit sweet for our taste. I used 3 cups of zucchini and did not squeeze the liquid from the zucchini. Also, I baked it in two 9x5 inch loaf pans (because that is what I had) for about 1 hour. It is very moist and delicious.

I made this in a regular size loaf pan and used butter to grease the pan. It came out perfectly! Enough to make 2 loaves.

Great flavor, and moist.  Adding pecans was the only thing I did differently.  Well, I may have added a few more blueberries!  
Will make it again.

This was an outstanding bread/muffin or whatever else you can think of to do with it. Cooking time was longer than advertised so be patient, it is worth it.

Great recipe! 
My minor changes: 

I used two 8" x 4" foil loaf pans instead of the mini pans. These were perfect for the amount of batter and I had no spill-over. I increased the cook time to about 1 hr 15 min.

I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the 2.25 cups of white sugar.

I also added a tsp of nutmeg.

I would definitely make this again, although I might try to see if I can get away with 3 cups of zucchini next time.

The first time I made this I made muffins instead of loaves as I was doing an office event and wanted to make it easier. It took 35 minutes for them to bake and they turned out perfectly! Today I am making them again in mini loaf pans. I’m sure it will be just as perfect if not more as I just picked the blueberries yesterday.  I believe that the fresh blueberries will make it even better!

This is my first time posting and I have to say, BEST RECIPE EVER! I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used half oil and half applesauce, as well as, using one cup brown and one cup of white sugar.   The result was sheer bliss!

Ive made this many times and love it but could anyone tell me what happened today? I did something wrong. Forgot some thing or added too much of something,  i have no idea. But it all came out flat, didnt rise at all was very dense and the top had a shiny appearance. Im very curious as to what i must have done.

Awesome recipe! Will definitely make again. I only had 1.5cups of zucchini so I added 1/2 cup shredded carrot, and I didn’t have blueberries so I used chocolate chips. I also made muffins instead of loaf (baked for 15mins at 350F). I think blueberries would have been better than chocolate chips but these were still SO delicious and the perfect consistency.

Yum Yum Yum..I just made this and my kids already ate an entire mini loaf. At first I thought it would be to sweet but after seeing how many loaves you get it is not sweet at all. I made it as written and used 4 mini loaf pans & 1 large loaf pan.  Tip is to not drain the zucchini, the moisture in the squash is what makes the bread moist and delicious! I even used frozen blueberries. Definitely will make this again!

I made a few changes to try to make it a little healthier. First, I only did 1/2 cup of oil along with about half a cup of applesauce. I only  did a total of 1 1/4 cups of sugar (of which 1/2 was brown). Instead of 3 cups of flour, I did two and the third cup was oatmeal (you can put in in the blender if you want it as oat 'flour').  I always add about 1/2 - 2/3 cup of low-fat sour cream to my breads--along with just enough milk to keep the batter from being too thick.  It turned out great.

My kids loved this!  I used dried blue berries as that was all I had and I used greek yogurt instead of butter and splenda instead of sugar.  The dried blue berries added more sweetness so next time I would cut the sugar in half.  Kids already want to know when I will make it again.

Love this recipe! I made it with King Arthur Gluten Free flour, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil and 1 3/4 cup sugar just as other reviewers suggested and it came out so good. Made 4 mini loaves and 12 muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly. Sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top before baking and then brushed it with butter right after taking out of the oven. It didn’t need it but I liked the light crispy crust it created. I’ve never tasted zucchini bread before but was given a humongous one the other day. This recipe had so many rave reviews I decided this was going to be my first experience. It’s absolutely fabulous! The blueberries sort of melted into the bread as little pockets of sweetness. I filled the mini loaves up to about 1/2” from the top. They rose well and is moist and delicious. Definitely a high five!

This is such a great recipe!!! My coworkers are asking if I would bake them for them constantly! I used the recipe as stated, and tweaked a bit and both turned out sublime! My alterations were : Instead of 1c of oil 1/2 cup oil 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 cups white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar packed, and 2 1/2 - 3 cups, or at least a pound to a pound and a half of shredded zucchini (not drained/ dried) .   Do not dry the zucchini, it adds to the moistness of the bread/muffins.  I made muffins in large tins and cooked them at 350 F for about 23/24 minutes. I also omitted the blueberries and put in 2 cups chopped walnuts and it was fantastic!  Almost like a banana walnut.  Even people who do not like veggies will eat it....if you don't tell them it has zucchini in it!

I've made this many times and it has always turned out delicious. I use two large loaf pans and place a cookie sheet under the pans. I use zucchini I shredded and froze from the garden and frozen blue berries. I usually have to bake longer then recipes call for so I test for doneness.

I like this recipe. I made it as directed.  I liked it so much I bought extra zucchini at the farmers market, shredded it and froze it.  Now, what you need to know about that is there is a LOT of water in zucchini and it separates when it thaws.  I debated whether I should use the water, I did, and it turned out fine.  When I used frozen blueberries the bread turned purple which was a little less appealing but tasted just as good.

I added a little bit of milk (4 teaspoons) and first mixed the eggs and then incorporated the sugar and the rest ingredients.

As another commenter did, I made these into muffins instead.  Cooked for 18 minutes on 375 and they came out perfectly.  I used whole wheat flour as that was what I had on hand.  I wanted to cut down on the oil and sugar so I used 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and Splenda in place of half the sugar.  Definitely will make again; will follow the recipe to the letter next time to see if the different flour and the additional oil make for even better muffins.

I rely on this recipe as a staple in my home however, I have made numerous additions and alterations. Like I said it's a great staple recipe to work off of if you are inclined to replace and add goodies. 

In the past, I have swapped blues for raspberries, as well as added flax meal, chia seeds. I consistently keep the sugar low and replace the veg oil with coconut oil. Used maple syrup in place of the white stuff and added unsweetened shredded coconut . 

Very versatile and easy to alter on the fly. Keep in mind the more you add, the longer it takes to bake through.

Have fun and be creative!

I substituted a half cup of the oil with unsweetened applesauce and added extra blueberries. I also made them as muffins instead of bread. They are so delicious that I made 6 dozen to keep handy in the freezer!

I hate when comments are like, "I used kumquat instead of blueberries and kale instead of zucchini and it was disgusting!" Of course it was, you changed the whole recipe!

But I did change out the AP flour for Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten Free baking mix and it was delicious! I didn't have fresh blueberries available because they're insanely expensive right now, but the frozen ones worked out great. Final change was, in my double batch, I cut 1.5 cups of sugar and subbed unsweetened apple sauce... cuz my kids look cute with teeth :)  I'm making another batch today!

OMG yum. I made this but with other's suggestions: used half coconut oil and half apple sauce (1cup total), used half brown and white sugar (1cup total), used 3 cups of zucchini (water not drained), used half fresh and half frozen blueberries. I only had one 12 hole muffin tin so used that and a loaf tin. Baked muffins for 20mins and loaf for 40mins. So happy with the flavour. Dividing it by 24 serves makes it only 100cals per muffin/slice which definitely fits in my calories (if I can stop at one..) :D stoked!

Easy to make two loaf  recipe. Recipe is perfect as is but if you want a little healthier version, substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour and use apple sauce instead of oil (same proportions). I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Moist and delicious. We add the crumb topping mentioned in another review, and that made it a little hard to know when it was baked through. We made two standard-sized loaves, and they overflowed a bit. They also took an extra ten or fifteen minutes in the oven. I was worried that the recipe called for too much cinnamon, but it tastes just about right, without overpowering the taste.

Made as per recipe, and should have known the batter was too thin..in future will up the amount of flour. Taste is good though, was just too dense.

This is really quite good! I wouldn't have thought that the two main ingredients would go together. Definitely a good way to get zucchini in you if it isn't a favourite veggie.

My only comment is that all the blueberries sank to the bottom, otherwise the flavor was good.

Really, really good!  I used 1/2 cup veggie oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce, cookie nip, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown, 2 1/2 cups zucchini, 2 1/2 cups frozen blueberries tossed in flower.  I used a sugar mix in bottom of pan, but think I'll  try a crumble on top next time.  My small loaf pan took 1 hour, the larger one took 1 hour 10 minutes.

Delicious. A true 5 star. Did use almost 3 cups shredded zucchini with juice as I didn’t want to waste it. and used topping recommended by CookieQueen.  It would have been great without topping, but that did make it that much better. No other changes.

So delicious!! I added a little extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg, but it would be wonderful as wwwritten too.  The baking time was not long enough for me tho, I had to bake another 10 minutes ~ definitely a keeper!

I JUST posted a Question and Review, but I accidentally pushed a button that posted it before I was done. To add: I made the recipe as instructed with only one change—I used 2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. It is very yummy.  You don’t need to squeeze the water out of zucchini, it helps with the moisture of the bread. It does make more better than I think will fit into for small loaf pans though. I poured it into a Bundt pan instead.   This one is a keeper.

I love this and I do like to add my own little changes like 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, an extra cup of zucchini, switching up with part brown sugar instead of all white, and adding a crumb topping. I use two greased loaf pans and it comes out great every time!

the best ever. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. I made sure to squeeze out the excess water in the fresh grated zucchini. This is the perfect recipe for someone who has a garden overflowing with zucchini.

I  have only ever tried traditional zucchini breads, but decided to try this one today based on its high ratings.  I followed CookieQueen's suggestion of using 3 cups of zucchini, using 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and making a crumb topping made of 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon, chopped walnuts and 1 stick softened butter, mixed together by hand and sprinkled all over the top of the loaves before baking.  I used 1 cup chopped walnuts instead of the 1/2 cup in her recommendation.  I also used frozen blueberries because that's what I had on hand.  I used 2 large loaf pans cooked at 350 and it took them about 90 to 95 minutes to bake.  I would start checking them at 1 hr 20 minutes.  It is very good and would be good with some powdered sugar, a thin glaze drizzled over top, or some vanilla ice cream, but I like it just the way it is.

No I didn’t make it but planning to do it in the near future.  What do you call miniature pans, what are their dimensions?  The recipe looks very good, but I’m planning to use regular baking pans.  How much longer do I bake them?

I made this for a husband that DOSEN’T like zucchini anything. I tried something new with out telling him what was in it. The results!?  He Loved it. I almost didn’t tell him what was in it, but I have an evil streak so I told him just to see his reaction.  He still loved it!!! Wow what a great recipe.

Insanely good. Subbed banana and applesauce for eggs to make it vegan; subbed more applesauce for half the oil; subbed whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the white flour; subbed brown sugar for half cup of the sugar. I made a regular size loaf and six muffins. I can't stop thinking about how good this was.

I made this as a GF option. Splitting half of the total flour it calls for between a GF cup-for-cup mix and Bob's Red Mill Almond flour. It came out perfect! My daughter made it as well with basic flour and it is still a hit. Thank you for sharing! Recipe is easy to follow for a beginner.

Way better than expected.  A little sweet.  I'd reduce the sugar to 1  1/2 cups.

Came out beautifully and tastes great.  I followed the suggestion of substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce (homemade with cinnamon in the sauce) for half of the oil.  Also made 2 full-sized loaves instead of 4 mini-loaves and it worked well.

Everyone who has tried this just loves it!!!  The blueberry with the zucchini is unexpected but delicious.  As I always do, I swap out the massive amount of oil with applesauce.  Also, a bit sweet for our tastes so cutting back the sugar, although I do do as another reviewer indicated and use part white, part brown.  If you like zucchini bread, you will love this.

Added one large ripe banana(smushed) and1/2c. Lt brown sugar and 3/4 c. White sugar to liquid ingredients, otherwise as written.  It filled two one pound loaf pans perfectly.....no overflow.  Baked for 65 minutes or until a skewer or knife comes out clean.

This Blueberry Zucchini Bread is truly the best of both worlds.  

I did make a slight change; I used only 2 cups of white sugar instead of the recipe's 2 1/4 cups.  I think the next time I will use a bit less sugar, perhaps 1 1/2 cups. :)

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2 large loaf pans (instead of the mini ones) and baked for approximately 1 hour.  The bread came out perfectly moist. Really delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper! I’ll be making more very soon to share with friends/family.

Tasty muffins, but VERY sweet. I used 2 cups of sugar instead of the 2 1/4 and they were still too sweet for my liking (my 2 year old on the other hand loved them). Next time I will use even less. Otherwise good recipe that I will use again!

I didn't add all the sugar that was called for and I believe I could have cut out more. Its very moist with the blueberries so that meant that it didn't hold together as well as I would have liked. Will definitely try it again...tastes yummy!!

Super moist & delicious!!  I reduced the sugar, and used white plus wheat flour, including 1/2 C almond flour.  I did follow the cooling instructions because the bread needs time to hold its shape since it is so moist.

I made it for the first time and my family loved it.  Made 2 full sized loaves and the only change to the recipe I made was 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and I lowered the sugar to 2 cups as was mentioned in the other reviews.  Also cooked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Came out perfect.

Great bread.  Had to make a three batches to use up the huge zucchini I had.  All were good, but the best was the last when I reduced the sugar by 25% & took the hint of dusting the blueberries with flour before adding them in. 
   Gave loaves to two friends, both of whom demanded the recipe after tasting it. 
   Gave it 5 stars only because I wasn’t able to give it 6 stars. ??

I followed this recipe exactly (except I had to use extra light olive oil since I don't use vegetable oil) and made muffins for a quick out the door kind of snack. My daughter took 18 of the muffins (it made 24) with her to visit her boyfriend's family, and she said they raved about them. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you!

This recipe turned out great! The only things I did differently was add chocolate chips and make 2 regular sized loaves because I don't have mini loaf pans. This is going to be a favorite in my house, I will definitely be making it again and again.

FANTASTIC!!!
This zucchini blueberry bread has become a staple in our home. I cut the sugar in half and used 1/2 C of white flour and 1/2 C Whole wheat flour. Everyone loves it and I never have any to freeze.

This  bread is to die for!  Shared it with my family and friends, everyone loved it!  I modified the recipe by using 1.5 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup olive oil, and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also used 5 mini loaf pans instead of 4--this makes a lot of batter.  The loaves were beautiful golden brown, very moist, and slipped right out of the pans with just a little bit of butter rubbed on the bottoms and sides before baking.  Will definitely make this again!

I made this per the recipe except I used about half Stevia and half sugar. I debated using lemon zest in place of the cinnamon but decided to stick with cinnamon this time. I baked it in 2 large loaf pans instead of 4 small. I had to bake it for about 65 minutes before it tested done. The batter seemed quite thick to me. I squeezed the zucchini in a towel but gently since I wanted to leave moisture in the zucchini. I am pleased with the results but would like to add a simple glaze to this bread before I serve it.

This is my go to bread for my garden of zucchini! I have made this bread for many friends and family and it always gets rave reviews. I will usually add 1/2 to  1 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter.  I will also, occasionally, add a crumble topping to it, at my husbands request. Other than that, this recipe has all it needs! 
It is a yummy, delicious bread that we love toasted with butter or cream cheese,  the day after it's made!

I increased the zucchini to about 3c making it very moist. I cut the sugar down to 1 3/4c and it was still sweet. I only had half a pint of blueberries but that was still plenty! Flexible recipe and delicious! Thanks for sharing.

I made this GLUTEN FREE and it turned out great! I made it exactly how it’s written except substitution of the GF flour for regular flour. Only my husband has to eat Gluten Free, but we all enjoyed it. I made half in a loaf pan and muffins out of the other half. I will be making it again!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was a big hit at the gathering I brought it to. Since then, I’ve experimented just a little bit with subbing out oil with applesauce and it’s still really good at 3/4c applesauce and 1/4c oil. I’ve also added a bit more zucchini to the last batch (the zucchini I used was 2 1/2c and I didn’t want to waste it) and this recipe is rather forgiving on that front. It’s moist and delicious!

followed as is, and put in muffin pans, baked until toothpick in center was clean.  the flavor was good, but not great, but they were too well done on the bottom.  maybe a lower temp would have been better?

No changes, doubled the recipe and it made 3 large and 1 medium size loaves.  Needed to cook a little longer due to the size. They came out moist, delicious and perfect.  Next time I may try making it a little healthier.

I turned this into a cake and added lemon to the cake and a lemon buttercream.  It was delicious.  It is very dense(more of a bread than a cake texture), but it was delicious.  I omitted the cinnamon since I added lemon juice and zest.

Followed the recipe exactly and used two bread pans vice four mini pans.  After 50 minutes at 350 deg, was still VERY moist on the knife.  Left in for another 10 minutes and the edges started to burn while the middle was still uncooked.  Cut off the bottom and sides to salvage some and it was quite tasty.  

Used metal pans well greased so maybe use glass pans next time?

I made this bread as a compliment to a chicken and root vegetable salad dinner.  I substituted yellow summer squash for zucchini and added one third cup of coarsely chopped walnuts.  I used frozen blueberries coated in flour to keep the bread from turning blue and to suspend the blueberries in the batter.  The finished result was superb.  Both of my guests asked to take home a loaf. We finished one loaf with dinner, sent home a loaf with both guests, and saved one for ourselves. You can be sure I will be making this recipe again very soon.

Waaay too much sugar in this recipe. Definitely cooked more evenly in my mini loaf pans. Despite properly greased pans, every loaf stuck. I won’t be making this again.

I didn’t have blueberries, but had fresh strawberries. So added those and substituted the cinnamon for nutmeg and cloves. Served it with fresh strawberries and mangoes and a light lime fresh mint glaze. It was a hit!

Absolutely delicious.  I'm not a big fan of "too sweet" so I stopped at 2 cups of sugar, and replaced 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of apple sauce because I'm always watching the cholesterol.  Had to make myself stop after 2 slices.

This was a delicious recipe.  I used 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil and upped the vanilla a bit.  I also cut down on the amount of sugar and used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup cane sugar. The bread was moist and so good!

Made without altering, it's really delicious! I recommend draining the zucchini a little bit before using. The only reason it's 4/5 is because I think it needs a little more in the spice department. I baked it in muffin tins for about 30 mins and they turned out quite well.

This is the BEST sweet bread ever!  I've even made it GF by using oatflour and/or a mix of GF flours.   I usually make enough to share after our annual June blueberry picking trip.  I always get a ton of compliments.  

It seems to have a lot of sugar, so I usually cut back a wee bit.  I've also made "healthier" versions by replacing some or all  of the oil/butter with applesauce, and cut out 1/4 -1/2 cups of the sugar.  Even with these adjustments, the bread is still amazing!    

Be prepared, if making a GF loaf, to have sticky bread.  Oat flour tends to have a stickier and thicker consistency.

Overall, this will always be a keeper for me!  Definitely a favorite!

Great recipe and new household favorite. Only changes were adding more zucchini (1/2 to 2/3 cup) only because we had a lot on hand,  then topping with raw sugar the last 15 minutes.  Family finished it off so fast we’re making it again today!

I made these for a few special people at church (as a way of saying thank you) and there was enough batter to make my husband and I a small one too. It was fabulous!!  Perfect taste and texture with bursts of blueberry at all the right moments. Mmmmm! With my morning tea it was definitely a 'bit of alright'! :-) For those of you that turn your nose up at the word zucchini you don't taste it. Even my husband who stops listening after I say the word zucchini had some and enjoyed it.

Easy and delicious. Entire family really enjoyed it.  I did find that the loaves took longer to bake than originally expected because I only had a large loaf pan, just kept checking until a toothpick came out clean.

Better than just zucchini bread. It was the perfect blend of flavors so that neither flavor overpowered the other.  Hubby couldn't believe that it had zucchini in it.  I did add the crumble topping and made 1 loaf and 1 dozen muffins instead of 2 loaves. Thanks for sharing.

It was so good the first time, I made it again and tried a few changes this time -- not that it needed any changes at all, I was just experimenting.  I used two eggs (that's all I had on hand), added 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 3 cups white sugar, added an extra 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and allspice. Perfect amount for a 12x9 cake pan.  Definitely a go-to recipe with or without my changes.

I was a little bit lazy and bought the zucchini pre-shredded at Publix but otherwise followed the directions. Gave my batches to three people and they all had rave reviews. Can't wait to make it again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread come out terrible.  I made two standard loaves  an it took more like an hour and a half to cook. The loaves were heavy and dense and did not taste good at all.

This was great.  It took quite a bit more time to cook the regular sized loaf.  But the mini loaves were just right.  Next time I might just use the mini loaves.

This is an excellent recipe and deserves a five star rating.  It is very moist and very easy to follow and make.  I have made it a total of 6 times now and at times using fresh blueberries and other times using frozen blueberries.  Using either fresh or frozen blueberries turned out very moist.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the sugar down to 2 cups, used all of I medium-large zucchini and I had to baked it for 80 minutes for two loaves.  I have given this zucchini bread to 5 different families and everyone that has tasted it have raved about how moist and tasty this zucchini bread is.

This has to be one of the most delicious breads ever!  I really had no idea that this combo existed.  I just had an abundance of blueberries and zucchini  here that had to be used!  I made the recipe twice, thus making 4 standard-sized loaves.  I actually forgot the cinnamon in the first batch, and it was scrumptious!  I made the second as per the recipe, and it was equally good, just a bit less tart.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I first made it with no changes.  Good recipe.  I know the oil keeps bread moist, but it was a little too oily for me.  I made it again and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil for the original 1 cup oil.  It still gave plenty of moistness without the added oiliness when touching it.  Four stars for the recipe as written.

I followed the ingredients exactly, but had to make this in two regular loaf pans because I have no mini loaf pans.

I take issue with these methods employed. For example, I have always put my dry ingredients together and whisked them.  Moreover, I add the undrained zucchini after the wet and dry ingredients are mixed. I have never before heard of checking your bread with a knife! (Ahem, toothpick?)

I made a point of not reading any of the reviews here, before trying this recipe to use up some blueberries we had on hand. Just looking at the reviews now makes me worry it will be too sweet.

Update: I couldn't wait until morning to try this bread, so I take back the statement about it might be too sweet. It is a little on the sweet side, but moist and delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

Great little recipe, but much too sweet. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and found it still too sweet. I will try 1 cup sugar next time and it will probably be just right.

I made this recipe as written with exception of decreasing the sugar to 2 cups. I did not squeeze out the  excess liquid from zuchinnis after they were shredded because recipe didn't call for it. This did not seem to affect the recipe. I cooked in 2 mini loaf pans and one regular sized loaf pan all together in a toaster oven with convection fan running for 50 minutes. I took the 2 mini loaf pans out leaving the larger pan in for an extra 5 minutes.  The bread is very moist and flavorful. Next time I think I'd like to add more zuchinni  and due to the larger amount, squeeze excess liquid from zuchinni.

I got loads of raves from the family on this bread. I made minor changes based on the comments from others: used 1/2  vegetable oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. It turned out just perfect and I will be making this again. It's a wonderful way to use all that zucchini from the garden!

This was very good and I've made it a few times. However, I can't figure out how you only get 4 mini loaves - I always get 8! And actually, it makes sense. Other bread recipes I have typically make 2 loaves (or 8 mini loaves) and they use about the same amount of flour and what not. So maybe a misprint?
The only "problem" I have had is that it seems to stick to the pan. I have to use a spatula and really pry the loaves out. 
Once again though - a very tasty zucchini bread!

Followed the exact recipe and turned out very moist. Kids can't even taste the zucchini they just see chocolate. I would definitely make it again.

My husband is Gluten free so I had to alter this recipe a bit, however he was SO excited.  This was incredibly tasty.  We sliced it and used it as a pancake with eggs and sausage.  Finding anything bread-ie that is gluten free and tasty is very rare.  I substituted my homemade flour (2 cups brown rice flower, 2/3 cups potato starch, 1/3 cup tapioca flour) I used the same amount that the recipe called for, and I reduced the sugar to only 2 cups.  It was great.

Don't follow cookiequeen's recipe. Adding a third cup of zucchini was nuts, and using 4 miniature loaf pans is also nuts. I used two large loaf pans, and they were not fully baked at over 1 hour 10 minutes. The pans were definately over filled to bake properly. Crumb  topping was good though.

When I was putting it together I was thinking this is a lot of sugar.  I was right, it was too sweet.  Other than that, it baked up okay.  I only had two large loaf pans and so it took longer to bake.  I did grease both pans and even with a CUP of oil it still stuck to the bottom of one of the pans.  We'll eat it.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

I made this for the first time and it came it great!  Next time I think I'll try to use less sugar though so they are a bit more healthy

Great recipe. I made 2 standard sized loaves from one batch and a bundt cake with the second batch. Very moist inside with a nice, crispy crust on top. Not too sweet (I substituted ~1/3 of flour with whole wheat flour)... just right for breakfast... or mid-morning... or mid-afternoon... you get the idea!

Great recipe. Made gluten free by using 2 cups gf flour and 1 cup almond flour. Subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil and added 3 cups blueberries coated with gf flour. Made 5 mini loaves and baked for 50 minutes in toaster oven. Family loved it and great use of zucchini.

WAY TO MUCH SUGAR, I decreased it to only 1 cup 1 cup and it was yummy. Thanks, but please watch the sugar. P.S. next time I'm going to use on 3/4 cup sugar, so we'll see. Over all very good, and the family loved it. The recipe made two loaves of  bread.

Delicious! Subbed out half cup white sugar for brown, used 3 cups of blueberries, added chopped walnuts....made four mini-loaves and a small "cake".  Served it with vanilla ice cream topped with--of course--fresh blueberries!  What could be better!

This bread is delicious! I used almost 4 cups of fresh shredded zucchini and needed 6 mini loaf pans. The time, taste and texture are incredible. This is a new 'go to' recipe as long as I have blueberries on hand.

The blueberries overpowered the zucchini way too much.  The loaf was moist and flavorful and I will probably make it again using less berries.

I substituted 1 cup of Applesauce for the 1 cup of oil.
I added 2 cups of frozen Blueberries, rolled them in flour so they would be throughout the bread. 

Wonderful bread! Stocking the freezer with this one!

I didn't want to make in mini pans. I used my largest bread pan and it was a big bread when done. It took 1 1/2 hours and I thought it would burn going that long, but it did not.  I wish I hadn't had to guess about the timing. We did all like it but I thought it had a tad too much sugar. Next time I will leave out the 1/4 cup, and only use 2, one of which will be brown sugar. I actually feel the batter was a just a bit much for my bread pan.  Next time I may put it in the Bundt pan instead. Yes I would make it again. I am making this again, using the 4 mini loaves as I plan to freeze a few loaves. Also switched to five star instead of four. I still decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup.

I threw in a ripe banana, cut back on sweetner, and it turned out moist, sweet, and delicious. Liked the addition of blueberries. I also used 1/2 almond flour in place of white wheat.

After reading lots of reviews, I opted to do half oil and half applesauce, add nutmeg,  seep then increase zucchini to 3 C, coat blueberries in flour to keep from dropping,  and added topping of 2/3 C flour, 1/2 C each brown and white sugar, 1T cinnamon,  2/3 C oatmeal and softened stick of butter.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  My grandson loves this bread. I usually make a triple batch and put the extra loaves in the freezer so we have them during the winter. It's one reason I grow zucchini every summer.

This is a go to recipe I have used many times.  I always bake it in 2 regular loaf pans.  This time I subbed 1 cup applesauce for the oil. I think it was even better with the applesauce and fat free. For anybody struggling with frozen blueberries, toss them in a small amount of flour. That will keep them from sinking to the bottom.

I made a few alterations to make it more healthy.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 stevia and substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce and it still turned out to be the best sweet bread I ever had!

very good..I made it as the recipe said., except I used 3 C. zucchini and frozen blueberries that I had from this past year.
I also added some chopped pecans.  I baked it 50 min. which was a little to long.  Very moist in the middle but a little dry on the out side.  Yes, I will make it again.

This recipe is the bomb.  Everyone in my group ranted about it.  Since it makes two loaves, I split the batter and put blueberries in one and chopped walnuts in the other.  Amazing.  Next time I make it I think I will add more cinnamon and nutmeg along with some raisins in the walnut loaf.

I used applesauce in place of the oil & used about a 1/3 less total sugar than what it called for - turned out great!

This is the best Blueberry Zucchini Bread I have ever made or tasted. It is so quick & easy to make.           I rolled blueberries in flour before adding. Delicious.

Delicious. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup of white and 3/4 cup of brown and it was still plenty sweet enough. 
I divvied up the batter between a muffin pan and a bread pan. The muffins came out about 5 minutes before the bread. I preferred their consistency. The bread was amazing, but stayed a bit sticky throughout consumption while I never had that problem with the muffins. Love this combination and never would have thought of putting them together!

Great recipe. Followed the ingredients to a T, baked in 2 regular loaf pans for 1 hr 20 min. (as another reviewer recommended) because I have no mini pans. Turned out great! I'll never make zucchini bread without blueberries again (if I can help it ;P).

This was awesome. I did drain the zucchini first and then  I followed the advice of others to make it a little more healthy by using half of the oil and half unsweetened apple sauce.  I also used half whole wheat and half unbleached white flour.  I decreased the sugar to 2 cups but next time will decrease to 1 3/4 cups (and there will be a next time).  Everyone loved it, super moist and delish!

Wow I never thought I'd like zucchini bread until now.  Definitely use the topping in the previous recommendation.  I did amp up to 4 cups of shredded zucchini and next time I'll probably go with 5 cups.  You really can't taste the zucchini and the kids love it for breakfast.  Next one I'm going to go with even more apple sauce and less oil.  This is definitely a keeper!

My garden was overflowing with zucchini and I had to get rid of some so I tried this. Excellent!  The whole family loves it!  I made it as directed except if I have a little extra zucchini I will use it instead of wasting half of one. I've used about 3 cups each time instead of the two. And I did 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4 of brown. But I'm sure it tastes almost the same just as written. My changes weren't major at all. Definitely something I will make often.

I used ball squash instead of zucchini because I had an abundance of that in the garden.  I'm also gluten free, so just replaced flour with gluten free flour.  Everything else was the  same.  My husband and I loved these loaves. I will be making this recipe often!  Going to plant more squash.

Loved the recipe!  I made a few very small changes that I think made this recipe perfect for us. I kept the amount of zucchini the same, added a few more blueberries, reduced the oil by about 1/8 cup, and did 1 1/2 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar instead of 2 1/4 of white sugar. I also sprinkled a bit of turbinaro sugar on top. I actualy ended up having to bake it for 1 hour and about 20 mins.

This is not only the best zucchini bread I've ever had, it's also the best blueberry bread I've ever had. I loved the strong, but not overpowering, flavors of cinnamon and vanilla. It's also "fluffy," as opposed to dense, like some zucchini breads. As another reviewer suggested, I made 2 large loaf pans, making it in a 350° oven for an hour and 20 minutes. It sounds like a long time, but it is perfect. Try this recipe! You won't regret it!

Absolutely delicious! I subbed applesauce for the oil and reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cup since the applesauce was sweetened. The recipe made 12 muffins and three small loaf pans. This is a definite keeper!

This is an excellent dessert bread.  It is very moist and has alot of flavor.  I did not make any changes to the recipe except for that I did not have fresh blueberries so I used frozen blueberries.   my family loved the bread.

Yes,  I modified. Half light agave and half sugar. Half coconut oil and half applesauce .  It made 4 mini loaves plus 3 muffins. The muffins didn't have to bake quite as long as the loaves. So good!

AMAZING!!!!! I ran out of baking soda so I substituted it with triple the amount of baking soda and left out the salt. Forgot to shred the zucchini and cut it instead and it still turned out amazing!  Super sweet and easy recipe to follow.

This is delicious. I used 2 eggs, cut the sugar and oil in half, added in 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 oz. maple syrup and extra blueberries. I also left out the cinnamon due to allergy. After mixing I filled baking pan that has 8 mini loaves with the mix and cooked -checked frequently and froze the little loves when it was done. Has nice slight crust that is so good. Definitely making this one on my next baking day.

This turned out much better than expected!  I did use 1/2 C applesauce in place of 1/2 C of oil, and decreased the sugar by about 1/2 C or so.  I also added a crumb topping which I just made off the cuff.  Very delicious bread.  I'm always looking for ways to use up zucchini, will definitely make again!

I followed many suggestions previously listed.  I used half whole wheat flour, substituted 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil for the oil.  Decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I also had some cranberries I wanted to use, so I substituted cranberries for the blueberries.  It was a great sweet/ tart combo.

I've made this recipe several times.  It always comes out great.  I reduce the sugar and sometimes use applesauce for some of the oil.   I usually make a double batch since my family loves it so much!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I tried recipe as it was written, (times and oven temps included) and it turned out great!  It was moist, sweet and delightful!
Next time I might try some sort of crumble topping, just to give it a little crunch.

A cold, rainy day means bake something!  This was the perfect thing. Excellent recipe, but since I must do things differently, I made a few changes. I always go organic, as well here. Used 1/2 applesauce/1/2 avocado oil. Only 1 cup turbinado sugar, 2 cups Eikenhorn flour, 1/2 cup teff flour, 1/2 cup flax seed meal. Added 1/2 cup dried cranberries soaked in warm orange juice for 15 minutes. Put the walnut/flour/cinnamon/butter on the top as suggested by others. This was amazing. Great recipe, Laura. Thank you.

This is an excellent recipe my whole family enjoys it - the only thing I revised in the recipe was less sugar than it called for and with that revision it is sweet enough.

I've made these several times now & they always taste great!   I also get FIVE mini loaves from this recipe.  Once I forgot to purchase the mini-loaf pans so I used a bundt pan.  The only issue I had with the recipe is the bake time.  I had to bake much longer than stated but it could have been because of the difference in moisture in the zucchini.  I have some Gala apples so I am going to try this recipe replacing the blueberries with the zucchini!  Thanks for sharing the awesome recipe!

Not what we were expecting, texture and flavor was very much like a blueberry muffin. If you're craving similar density to traditional zucchini Bread this is not for you. Not a bad muffin though.

I made this per the recipe written.  But made it 2 loaves. It  was very good. The blueberries all went to the bottom of the loaf. Next time I will put a little flour on the blueberries so they don't sink to the bottom.

Although I did make changes, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Used 2 larger loaf pans and baked 1 hr 15 min.  
We loved it, was so moist.

This bread was delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception that I took the suggestion from one of the other reviewers and used 1/4 C brown sugar and added some fresh nutmeg. I will definitely make this again but will try making it in two regular size loaf pans .

My husband loved it, I liked it but found it a bit too sweet. Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar. I took some of the other suggestions, added walnuts, replaced 1/4 white sugar for brown sugar, added nutmeg, oh and I used apple sauce instead of oil.

This bread is lovely and moist. The flavours work very well together. The first time I made it, I had to halve the recipe. This time, I made it as written, but put it into two standard loaf pans.

Delicious.  I added an extra cup of blueberries and next time I'll cut back on the sugar by 1/2 a cup, but this was tender, light and moist.  I'll definitely make it again.

I made it in 2 nine inch loaf pans and followed the recipe except that I upped the cinnamon to a rounded tablespoon.  The breads were moist and the blueberries became almost like jelly.  I will use this recipe again.

What I Loved about this recipe was that it was simple and I used ingredients  I already had in my kitchen. Oh yea and I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen (thawed them out) and it still came out Yummy! But Make sure if you use frozen Blueberries you Fold in gently! Don't want the batter to look Blue!

Delicious! I did not make any changes. My kids couldn't even detect the zucchini! My only suggestion is to avoid a loaf-shaped pan. I split the batter into a quiche pan and a loaf pan. The quiche pan came out perfectly and very uniform. The loaf was uncooked in the middle when the crust was close to being overcooked, so I had to keep cutting out the cooked area and putting the uncooked portion back in the oven.

I made this as written and it was moist and delicious.   The only change that I will make next time is to coat the blueberries with flour as they did sink to the bottom of the loaves.   Great recipe.
Made this again, coating the blueberries with flour,  using coconut oil as the oil and adding a topping of flour,  brown sugar,  cinnamon and butter  - absolutely delicious!  Love the mini loaf pans as it is easy to give them to friends and family.   Love this recipe!

When I make carrot cake I use half as much oil and replace it with applesauce.  That's what I did with this recipe.  I thought this recipe was too sweet for my taste, so if I make it again I would definitely use less sugar.  This has nothing to do with the applesauce as I use unsweetened.  Also, I think the zucchini should be added last with the blueberries and be folded in for a better final texture.

I made this yesterday. I substituted all purpose flour with Bob Mill's 1 to 1 gluten free baking flour, 1/2 of the vegetable oil with apple sauce and used half the sugar called for. I separated the batter in to two cake pans since I don't have bread pans. Then baked them for about 30 minutes(until the knife came out clean). It came out moist, delicious and just sweet enough for my liking.

I followed the recipe precisely and it turned out terrific! It made a lot of batter! I was able to make 12 muffins and a regular size loaf of bread. The muffins and the bread froze well also. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I only had 3 baby sized zucchini, so I halved all ingredients, except the eggs (I used two).  The bread came delicious and super moist.  I frosted it with a basic cream cheese icing - delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written; the results were 4 mini loves of the absolute best zucchini bread I've ever eaten. 
The bread has a nice rise to it and the blueberries were a nice addition. 
I made the recipe without the blueberries in two normal size loaf pans and got wonderful results with that as well.
This is now my official 'go to' zucchini bread recipe.   
Thank you Laura!

Delicious! I have made this twice in one week: the first time exactly as recipe states with only white sugar, and the second time I traded one cup of the white with golden brown sugar:  More depth of flavor with the golden brown sugar.

I will also note that I add about eight more minutes of baking time, and all of my loaves come out BEAUTIFULLY perfect,  with glass or dark bake-ware.  Let them sit for at least 10 minutes in pans after taking out of the oven before turning out on a cooling rack. 

EXCELLENT! Even better the next day (if it lasts that long).

Everytime I make this recipe it turns out great I always put 3 cups zucchini and I don't drain the extra water out. It makes it super most. I am so glad I would this one. Very very very happy

Excellent recipe! I did use another reviewers recommendation of 2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I also made 2 traditional loaves instead of 4 mini loaves. Baked for 70 minutes. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Love love love this bread!  Made it for the first time last summer (2015). Was such a success that I've made it many times since. I did use cookiequeen's suggestion and added a streusel topping & used 3C zucchini. But I also lined loaf pan with a strip of parchment in the pan (down two side and the bottom) and greased pans like crazy. Came out of pans great!  I'm here today reminding myself of the recipe because everyone is asking for it again this summer! Fun! Thank you!

I am diabetic so I used one cup Splenda and one cup regular sugar.   The berries were so sweet since it is summer.  It was great.  Also used some coconut oil and applesauce to reduce the oil to 1/4 cup.

This was delicious.  I didn't change a single thing.
It had great texture, was easy to cut (no crumbling).
And stayed fresh for a week out of the freezer.
Can't do much better than that!

This was great.  I took it to a picnic, it was all gone and people raved about it.  The recipe was a little heavy handed on the sugar so I would cut back by about 1/2 cup next time.   I also used frozen blueberries  without any problems. Yum!

I love making this bread! I'll be honest, I did not follow this recipe entirely. I added ingredients, I used more of some ingredients, I even cut some of the ingredients back. Also, I added a crumb topping like I would with a pie and it came out great! My friends, family, coworkers, and even my dog (who ate it off of the counter) love this!  Definitely keeping this recipe in my book!!

I made this pretty much as the recipe said except added more zucchini. The bread was very good. I used full size loaf pans and didn't bake long enough though. Next time will do 2 full size loaves for about 70 minutes.

Awesome!  Was afraid it was going to be too sweet, but it was perfect!  I used two disposable loaf tins.  I cooked for 74 min.  I would suggest checking at 70 min.  Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe!  My family raved about it.  I subbed a little, to cut down on some fat/calories.  I used used about 2 Tbsp. oil, and about a cup of applesauce.  I used 1 cup of Palm Coconut Sugar, & 1/2 cup raw honey instead of white sugar.  I added a little light brown sugar mixed with a sprinkle of nutmeg & tsp of cinnamon for the top prior to cooking.  Superb!

VERY good and works great with Namaste gluten free flour! Moist and surprisingly light for this type of bread. Sweet enough to be a cake, too. Bakes up with a lightly, flaky top crust. You'll probably want to squeeze some liquid out of the shredded zucchini rolled in a paper towel before adding it.

These were good. I made muffins instead of loaves and it made 24 mini and 12 normal sized muffins. I only put blueberries in half the batter since one child likes with and one without. I also added a bit of nutmeg which I wouldn't do again. I also used 1/2C applesauce and 1/4 C walnut oil and 1/4C canola oil. Next time I'll just do half applesauce and half walnut oil.

One of the best things I've ever eaten!!  I always make a recipe exactly as written before rating it and this one is 5+!  I have made muffins using dried cranberries and while good, they didn't compare to fresh blueberries. This morning's variations: cut sugar to 2 cups (will decrease further next time to reduce calories); used coconut oil; increased cinnamon to 2 tbsp.  The recipe made 24 muffins that I baked for 25 min. Superb! Very versatile recipe that I'll be using forever. Thanks for sharing!

I made this today and it was delicious and moist.  I finally got another loaf pan as I only had one the last time I made a zuchinni bread.  I baked two 9x5 loaves instead of 4 mini loaves, and it took 60 minutes to bake.  At 50 minutes as recipes calls for the inserted knife in center of bread came out very wet.  So I baked them another 10 minutes and that worked out perfectly.  I also only used 2 cups of sugar as 2 and a quarter cups seemed too much.Thanks!

I used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2, 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar and added a sprinkle of nutmeg. I also make a crumb topping( 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 stick softened butter-mix altogether with hand) and sprinkle all over the top of the loaves before baking.

Only change I made was by reducing the sugar to 1/2c and I added a little nutmeg. I added a bit of salt to the shredded zucchini and let it drain over night which removed most of the water content. The bread turned out ok but the blueberry juice made parts of the bread some what soggy.  Not sure how to avoid that happening again, I think next time I'll omit blueberries and use chopped walnuts.

I make this every year when zucchinis are plentiful and look forward to it every year, too!  It's a forgiving recipe - I've used more and less sugar, 1/2 whole wheat flour, replaced some of the oil with apple butter/sauce - added nuts, streusel topping, made it in muffins, loaves and bundt pans - it's always delicious and turns out perfectly!  The baking time varies with those versions, of course, but it always does (especially if it's humid).  It is possible to underbake it, though.

Made muffins instead. 12 VERY large muffins. They were done in 30 minutes and a very big hit. The only change I had was no vanilla as I was out, and 4c zucchini with water all squeezed out.

Very good bread; terrific way to use a bumper crop of zucchini. Made it with a combo of all-purpose, whole wheat, and gluten-free flours and with frozen wild blueberries (little ones....so flavorful). It came out almost perfect consistency-wise. Might cut back next time on the sugar....2-1/4 cups made it a bit too sweet, I thought.

Absolutely magnificant! I made it as directed, but didn't have mini loaf pans. I used 2 regular sized loaf pans. I also used organic cane sugar which measures the same (from Aldi). Due to different pans, I had to bake a bit longer...say maybe 20 minutes--and during that 20 min., I turned oven down to 325. Both loves turned out so moist and light and DELISH!!! Thank you for posting this one!

I made a mistake and followed some of the reviewer's suggestion rather than the exact recipe, and it was not good.  2 1/2 cups of blueberries was way too much and I think is more than one pint.   I also used 3 cups of zucchini, again too much.   A huge disappointment, but I can't blame the recipe since I didn't follow it exactly.  I will make this again but will stick to the exact instructions.

The blueberries are a great addition to a traditional recipe. Very moist and yummy.  The only changes I made were to use 3 cups of zucchini and substitute part of the white sugar with brown. I also made it in two regular loaf pans, and they had to cook longer, for about an hour. You'll need to check for doneness based on the size of your pan and your oven. In the future, I might cut to 2 cups of sugar. Also, for those who complain that it's dry, you can't squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini! It's essential to keep the bread moist. I will make this again.

I have an over abundance of zucchini this year. I made this recipe, but I ran out of blueberries. So I used some blueberries and some strawberries. What a berry surprise! My mini loaves came out moist and delish, PLUS..they are the perfect patriotic  red white and blue dessert for the 4th of July celebration!

Sorry it should have read I increased the baking soda to one teaspoon, not the baking powder. So...one tsp baking powder plus one tsp baking soda.

This was a great recipe! It did seem to have to much sugar so we cut back 1 cup of sugar. Overall, great taste and very soft. Will definitely use this again.

Family loves this blueberry zucchini bread! We are trying to stay away from sugar so I used 1/4 cup white sugar plus  1  1/2 cup Agave and then lowered the vegetable oil to 1/2. I also added blueberries to the top.  Making more today, since my garden is overflowing with zucchini.

This is delicious. Tomorrow will be my 3rd week of making this bread. I make it in 5 mini disposable loaf pans per batch. I usually give 2 away to neighbors or work and we munch on the other loaves the rest of the week. After it's gone, we all get sad. It didn't last 15 minutes in the break room. All neighbors asked for the recipe. The top gets a little crispy, the middle is so moist, it's not too sweet and then you bite into a blueberry, oh and the cinnamon. GAH! Ok, I'll go make it now instead of tomorrow.... 
I only made one change to fit my pantry, 1/2 cup of softened butter and 1/2 cup of coconut oil to substitute the 1 cup of veg oil.

I never use vegetable oil so I substituted 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of cinnamon apple sauce in place of the 1 cup vegetable oil......got the apple sauce idea from some other reviewers on here but did not want to take out ALL the oil.  The result was amazing and I had to control my self!!!  I gave some away and they ate it all the same day!!  Will definitely make this recipe again and again.  Thankyou for such a wonderful treat.

Delicious! I used berries I had picked in the summer and frozen. Just adjust your flour depending on how wet your blueberries.

Great recipe! The bread came out perfectly! I follow the recipe And only used less sugar, 1 and 1/4 otherwise it too sweet for me. My picky eaters kids didn’t even know it has zucchini in it! Will bake it again!

Fabulous recipe. Made a few changes to try to make it a little healthier.  Substituted applesauce for half the oil.  Also used half whole wheat flour half white.  I freeze my grated zuchinni in sandwich bags and then use the plenteous zucchini all winter long.  I also sprinkle a little oatmeal crisp topping on each loaf, but plain oatmeal works too.  My crisp topping recipe is 1 c oatmeal, 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I just keep a small container in my fridge to use on banana bread and zucchini bread.  Love this stuff.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

GOOD FAST EASY  I made  24 muffins with 2 cups blueberries.
Use as much zucchini as you can. I drained out a lot of 
liquid . Made a moist but solid muffin. Nicely rounded with a 
little crunch to crust.,very nice we enjoyed.

This was absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe verbatim except my daughter accidentally used 1 tsp of baking soda vs. 1/4 tsp. Still came out great.  I also pureed 1 cup of zucchini and shredded the other cup.

I have made this bread several times.  I love it.  I do make a couple of changes by using unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and use brown sugar for 1/2 of the called for sugar.  I use (4) small loaf pans and cook the same time and temp.

I was looking for something to use some of our blueberries and found this one to use some of the zucchini that was in the freezer.  Defrosted the zucchini and drained nearly a half cup of water off.

Reduced oil to 1/2 c. and used 1/2 c homemade applesauce.  Used 1 3/4 cup white sugar and 2 duck eggs, because I had them and they are great for baking.

Followed the rest of the recipe as written.

Did put a sprinkle of white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon on top.

Put in 2 loaf pans and baked at 350 degrees F for 65 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly. When it came time to remove the loaves from the pans, none of them would come out. I almost floured the pans, I should have.  I won't try this recipe again.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever! The changes I made are half applesause/ half oil. Half white sugar/ half brown sugar. Roll the blueberries in flour before adding them. They stay spread out more evenly. Also made a crumb topping. (flour/sugar/cinnamon/butter) It made 4 small loafs. So yummy!

Amazing! Moist and delicious!  The only changes I made were to use frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and I made as two large loaves instead of the mini loaves and baked for 1 hr 20 mins due to the larger loaf size. I will be making this again! Yum!

This was really good and very easy. I try hard to find ways to get my boys to eat better. I know there is a decent amount of sugar in here but hey, everything in moderation. My boyfriend and my son both make sour faces when you say zucchini bread. I had to force my boyfriend to even try it. They both loved it. My son (10 yo) asked me to make it again so we are making the second batch in about a month with zucchini he helped me grow in the garden. I add about a 1/4 cup extra zucchini in my attempt to make it as healthy as I can and extra blueberries too. After the first attempt this quickly went down as one of our favorite recipes.

This recipe was not a success with my family. They thought the combo of zucchini and blueberries was not as enjoyable as just zucchini or just blueberries.

What a great way to use fresh berries and a vegetable!  My DH absolutely raved.  I would love to give a 5 star rating but I did make some changes - - - I followed others advice and cut the sugar and used applesauce, and half wheat flour -- plus I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  Will be making again and again as I have a freezer full of frozen shredded zucchini and blueberries.  Thank you Laura for a great recipe.

Absolutely amazing!!! My whole family loved it, even my little siblings who aren't fans of zucchini! Lol! I puréed the zucchini instead of shredding so it would be harder to notice and baked it in 2 regular size loaf pans. Fed my whole family breakfast, had part of a loaf left to bring to neighbors, and even had some leftovers! When blueberry season rolls back around, this will definitely be one of my go-to recipes!

Love! It made so much I ditched the loaf pans and used a large casserole. I also took advice from a reviewer and made the crumble top. Perfect.

Only problem I had was the loaves sticking to the pans, even when I sprayed them. I'll try wax paper next time. Also, cooking time was about 10 min. more. Very tasty zucc. bread!

Don't get me wrong here with the four stars, we loved it! But the amount of sugar added was so overwhelming for us, very sweet, and I even left off the extra 1/4th, crazy. Having said that, the bread was everything we wanted it to be otherwise! Love the blueberry/zucchini combo! However, next time I will cut way back on the sugar, maybe 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar. Thanks!

By far the BEST bread that I have EVER made!!! Fresh zucchini from my garden, and blueberries picked fresh as well. This was such a moist bread; I brought some to work, and everyone that tried it insisted that they get a copy of the recipie!!! They all turned out perfectly; I've made four already!! What a wonderful way to use up all of my zucchini!!!

As a novice baker, I was really happy with this zucchini bread. I followed the recipe as printed except for some minor changes. As others have suggested, I subbed in 1/2 cup of applesauce (cinnamon flavored) for half the cooking oil. Because one of my sons loves berries, I mixed in cut up raspberries with the blueberries.  I also inadvertently used 1 tsp of baking soda instead of the called for 1/4 tsp, but the bread still turned out well. Maybe it's a little fluffier but I have nothing to compare it to. I'll have to make another batch to compare.

Well, overall it came out fine however I don't taste or see any of the zucchini.  It tastes more like a blueberry cake. I used 2 regular loaf pans instead of the minis. Worked just fine. I did have to cook the loaves an extra 10 minutes. I lightly greased the pans and had no problems whatsoever. So all in all I am satisfied.

I can't give this 5 stars only because I tweaked it. 2cups whole wheat pastry flour +1 cup white flour. I followed others suggestions; increased zucchini by 1/2 cup, used 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/2 cup oil, then zest of 1 small lemon, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp blueberry extract, 1/4 tsp nutmeg; used less sugar ( 1 cup white sugar + 3/4 cup brown sugar), added 1/4 cup quick oats, 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Then sprinkled tops with a streusel crumble oat topping with pecans. Made 4 mini loaves & 8 large muffins :) will be freezing a few. Check out my resulting pic.

I read many reviews and followed the recipe to a T. I thought I would love it as I am generally a fan of quick breads. This bread was a disappointment. First, I found it too sweet. Second, the texture was a little too dense. I'm still giving it 3 stars because it certainly was not awful, but not good enough for 4 stars.

Love, love, love this! I made it and mixed flour, cinnamon, and butter together as a topping. I was the absolute best "coffee cake" I've ever made. At least that's what my husband and co-workers said. I made it in a cake pan rather than a bread pan. I WILL make it again!

Love this recipe!  I look forward to the local farmer's market having fresh zucchini to make this bread.  I use egg substitute instead of real eggs and it turns out perfectly.  Depending on what I am making it for I will also alternate between a full loaf & the mini-loaves.

YUM! Just what I want from zucc. muffins.  Used our stash of frozen local-picked blueberries and farm share zucc and it was phenom!  Solid muffins, with the right ratio of sweet to satisfying.  I did 1/2 the oil and subbed applesauce.  I also wanted to use up more zucc. so I did a batch and a half w/ 3 c. zucc. and 5 eggs and it worked beautifully. Enough for the 4 mini loaves and 18 muffins.  Thank you!

I made this recipe with a few adjustments.  I substituted one cup of wheat flour for the white flour,  used 3/4 cup of applesauce and a 1/4 cup of oil,.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and I added an extra cup of zucchini.  It tasted delicious and my whole family loved it.  I am making it again next week and I am going to be adding more whole wheat flour this time, less sugar, and substitute one of the eggs with flaxseed.  Also, I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar on my first try.

This is a fabulous recipe. I even used frozen blueberries and it all was very tasty, a good solid zucchini bread that had a lot of flavor.

This batter was way too much for the small loaf pans. The batter rose and rose and spilled over into my over and caught fire!  I had to wait to clean my oven before I could make anything else!  I tasted it before it went into the oven and it tasted great.  I only wished I could have had the actual bread.  Very disappointed.

Fantastic recipe! I opted for muffin tins versus a loaf pan but they turned out phenomenally. There a quick breakfast muffin when you're rushing out the door in the morning!

I had lots of blueberries from our produce co-op and decided to try this recipe. I love zucchini bread and was intrigued by the idea of adding blueberries.  I followed tips from other reviewers -- half oil/half applesauce, decreased sugar by 1/4 cup, increased zucchini to 2.5 cups and put the blueberries on flour before folding them into the batter. I got five small loaves. It is tasty, but will not replace the zucchini bread recipe I've tweaked from high school cooking class (39 years ago!) Thanks for the inspiration!

Very Good. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used soft whole wheat flour, added an extra cup of zucchini, used only 2 cups of sugar (actually evaporated cane juice), substituted applesauce for half the oil, added one cup of walnuts and a dash of nutmeg. Makes great mini-muffins also as I had more than four mini-pans and the extra exactly filled a min-muffin pan which baked for about 20 minutes.

Followed the recipie exactly with the exception of using small wild frozen blue berries. Came out moist and stayed that way for a week in airtight containers. Prepared in muffin tin! Hardly tasted the zuchini but loved the texture! Worth making!

This was delicious! I cut the sugar down (1 heaping cup) and I replaced all of the oil with applesauce. I meant to toss the blueberries with some flour to prevent the berries from sinking as another reviewer suggested, but forgot--oh, well--there's always next time. Also, I topped it with a streusel topping as others have suggested. The recipe made 2 standard-sized loaves. I'll definitely be making this again!

Absolutely amazing! After a friend's garden explosion of zucchini, I needed to find recipes. I tried 4 different breads, this one was hands down the best.  Not only was the taste amazing, the texture was great! We did other fruit recipes as well, and they were too wet. We have 5 children 10 and under, they couldn't get enough of this bread.  I am not a huge fan of the texture of zucchini alone, but it makes a wonderful bread.

So delicious! Pretty simple recipe with excellent results. Liked it just as is. The only thing I might do if serving at a brunch or for guests is add a little streusel topping. This can be made with a mix of flour, brown sugar, unsalted butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. Just did it to step up the presentation. Also, if you don't want to make streusel, you can always reserve thin, circular slices of zucchini to place on the very top to add to the presentation. But really--it's a great recipe as is, too!

I've baked several times & it always a hit! I too was a bit confused whether to use dry or fresh cranberries, personally I like the fresh, then I read Cookiequeens suggestion for the crumble topping & if I could give more stars I would.

Didn't change a thing. Super moist and delicious. Will absolutely make again. My family couldn't believe there was zucchini in there until they saw the small flecks of green here and there.

Tried this recipe as is the first time and it was a huge hit at a morning tailgate!  Made it many times since and try different variations on spices & berries.  It's a no fail recipe no matter what I do to it.  Love it!

I made this zucchini bread for some friends as a thank-you for a favor they did for me.  They absolutely loved it.  Their son claims the bread is as addictive as a drug.  He said he couldn't stop eating it!  The only thing I did differently was to use two 8"loaf pans instead of the mini-loaf pans.  I also added a little nutmeg and sprinkled coarse sugar lightly on the tops of the loaves before baking.  I will definitely be making this recipe again - what a great way to use zucchini!

Very yummy! I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce to cut the fat a little. It was very moist and dense. This is definitely on my repeat list!

Love this recipe!  I also made the change of 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce, used only 2 cups of sugar and added some slivered almonds since I had them. I made 2 large loafs instead of the 4 smaller ones and baking time was increased to 70 minutes since there is more batter in the pans.  I have made zucchini bread with pineapple which is great but the blue berries also do a terrific job.

I found this delicious.  Very moist and the blueberries made it awesome.  Will for sure make it again and again. This recipe uses 4 mini loaf pans. But there is enough batter left to probably make 3  more.  I made 4 mini loaf and 1 regular loaf pan.

I had a recipe for years I thought was "the best zucchini bread ever" ...but I am always willing to try and new one.  This is moist and sweet.  I tweeted the recipe using only 2 cups of sugar and a handful of brown sugar with frozen blueberries. I also grated some lemon zest the batter.  My kids said to never try a new recipe again...this one is a keeper!

This was one of the best loaves I've had so far. It was moist, and incredibly tasty. Plus the batter tasted great! There is nothing I would change and I will definitely make it again.

This was a winner.  I made it to the recipe and liked the texture.  The blueberries added just the right amount of flavor.  I would make it again and maybe substitute strawberries instead.  Welcome change from banana bread.

Took it out of the pan(2 lg.instead of 4 mini)and its mushy on the bottom.  baked it for 1 hr. 20 mins., did the toothpick test.  Thought something was wrong when it didn't have a nice round top.  Maybe too wet zucchini?  All the berries were on the bottom and not done.  I will try again since it has such high reviews....must be me.

I used 1.5 C whole wheat and 1.5 C regular flour. I used 3 C zucchini and cut the sugar to 1 C. I added 1 C applesauce and reduced the oil to 1/2 C. Finally, I used 1.5 tsp baking soda and .5 tsp salt. I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.

I made 12 muffins and 2 medium loaves.  Adaptions I used - 3 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup quick cooking oats, and 1/2 cup Hemp seeds.  One of the loaves I added some left over blueberry pie filling instead of the blueberries.  The other loaf I added a crumb topping (oatmeal, butter, sugar, cinnamon, hemp seeds)....

Easy recipe.

I made this in the afternoon today and made two standard loaf pans with this recipe.  After dinner we sliced one loaf and everybody, including my picky eater, loved it. I can't wait to wake up to the rest.  The kids are picking blueberries while I eat this and drink coffee so I can make more while the berries are prime.

I made this today and it is truly one of the best zucchini breads ever!  I did use the changes that one reviewer used - 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 bn sugar, 3 cups zucchini and the streusel.  Oh boy, don't forget the streusel!!!  I live in the mountains with a higher altitude so I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I also used frozen blueberries (thawed) which worked perfectly.  My husband loved this bread.

Awesome recipe!! I made it 2 different ways and was still very tummy. 1st way was w/o the cinnamon and 2nd way was with 1cup (oil) organic cold press coconut oil & 2cups sugar. Batter was thicker but it still baked the same and the only obvious difference was the loaves were slightly denser. Will be making again very soon!!!

Awesome.  I made this as written just rounding down the sugar.  I pureed my zucchini til it was basically a lumpy liquid and you couldn't even tell the bread was a zucchini base.  I made two loaves with this - they were a little low in height, but perfectly fine - probably baked better than if there was more batter in the pans.  I would definitely make this again.

I replaced the all purpose flour with an equal amount of gluten free flour blend (namastefoods), substituted some of the oil for applesauce, and used slightly thawed frozen blueberries and it phenomenal! It's basically cake. Perhaps next time I may put a little less sugar so it's not SO rich, but seriously, I could eat it all in one sitting.

I attempted to make this as is, but because I usually mess up or mix a step when I bake I did not make this as is.  The only intended change was I added walnuts.  I accidently added twice the amount of cinnamon and I forgot the baking powder.  So, although a bit "cinnamony" I thought it was delicious and so did everyone else.

This was a great recipe!  I did change some tiny things but I always do in a recipe.  Read some other reviews and so I tried the 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce as well as just 2 c. of sugar.  Added more shredded zucchini only because the one I had was larger so it was about 3-4 cups. And 1/2 t. baking soda.  I also added a topping.  The differences caused it to bake longer about 1 1/4-1/2 hrs not to mention I used a bundt pan.  Got lots really good responses on this recipe and it was the first time I had made it. Yum Yum, thanks

My veggie hating husband didn't want to try it because he thought it would taste like zucchini... but he ended up eating half the cake himself.  So delicious.  Followed recipe exactly and was divine!!  Used a bunt pan as some had suggested and baked 1 hr 15 mins.

I love this recipe!  I reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp (I love cinnamon, but it's too much even for me).  Although sometimes I make it more like a cake.  I bake it in a bundt cake pan and pour lemon glaze over the top.  For the glaze I use 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice and a tbsp of lemon zest.

Really good!  Used other suggestions and did half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, did half the oil then applesauce in place if the other half.  Also used half white sugar then half sugar free sweetener.  Made muffins at 350 for 25 min instead of bread loaf.  Next time will do more blueberries and maybe a pinch of nutmeg or pumpkin spice.  My fiancé said he can't wait to have another one for breakfast tomorrow!

Awesome recipe!! The only change I made was baking a little longer because with the time it states to bake them, the center wasn't done with my size pans.

Yummy with or without blueberries.  I made it healthier by substituting honey for sugar, olive oil for the vegetable oil and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  Delicious!

Amazing - better than the usual chocolate chips! I used 2 large loaf pans and baked on convection 50 min at 325.  I dare you to not eat the whole loaf warm out of the oven!

Just made it again for the second time.....I got 6 mini-loaves out of the recipe.  This time I only used about 2/3 the berries, a full pint was way too much.  My friend's son-in-law and his office staff declared it was the best bread they had ever tasted!

Love this recipe. I lost my stand-by recipe, and thrilled to find this one. It is even better than my old recipe - moist, tender, and loved by the whole family! I plan to take this to an upcoming pot luck dinner. I did not change any ingredients, but I didn't make it as bread. This makes a wonderful cake baked in a 9"x13" greased cake pan and baked for 55 minutes. Test with a tooth pick to be sure the center is done. When it came out of the oven, I dusted the top with powdered sugar. Let cool completely and cover. The next day the powdered sugar will have 'melted' into the cake. Serve with whipped topping if desired (my hubby's favorite way to eat this cake). Although you can serve this the same day it is baked, it is even better the next day. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'm sure this would make wonderful bread, but we like it as a cake :-).

This was really good!  I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1  1/2 cups of white sugar, 1 1/2 cups of white flour, and 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 2 cups of frozen blueberries (thawed).  I squeezed the excess moisture from the zucchini with paper towels. I used 2 regular loaf pans sprayed well with Pam. It took about an hour with my oven. Lots of compliments!

Amazing! I followed the recipe as written except made them into muffins. It made 24 muffins and I topped them with the crumb topping from the banana muffins on this site. They are wonderful and are disappearing fast. I'll definetly make these again.

Delicious! I loved it and will be making again any day now with garden zucchini.  I also used 2 large loaf pans instead of several small and upped the time to 70 minutes.  I only used about half of the sugar the recipe calls for and it was totally delicious.

This bread was amazing!!!  I didn't change a thing to the recipe but bake at the same temperature in a bundt pan. It was very moist and not too sweet. Can't wait to make again!

Fantastic! I have received many compliments on this recipe. Great way to use over sized zucchini. I baked it in a bundt stone for 70 minutes then added a white vanilla glaze. A real crowd pleaser at work!

I never write reviews but I am for this fantastic recipe! I am not very good at baking breads and am easily intimidated by a recipe but I had some fresh zucchini from my garden and wanted to use it up. I made this recipe according to directions with only one modification and that was cutting the oil down to 1/2 cup and substituting the other 1/2 cup with apple sauce. This turned out so beautiful and delicious that I made it two day in a row for a total of 4 loaves. One loaf was gone within hours and the other three went to work with me for three days in row and were devoured! LOVE IT!

This was a hit with the family.  I recommend lining the bottom of the pans with parchment paper and greasing and flouring the pans well.

Loved it! A nice, thick, moist delicious bread. One thing I changed. You don't need SOOOO much SUGAR. You only need a half of a cup. I always cut back on sugar for recipes. I also didn't put salt in it either. I try to cut back on the sugars and salts because why ruin a recipe's healthiness when you can avoid the extra ingredients you don't need? So remember just 1/2 cup of sugar and no salt.

Second time I've made this, and it came out perfect, even with doubling the recipe!  I substituted applesauce for the oil, and also used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups white, instead of 4 1/2 cups white sugar - the brown sugar added a special flavor that made this just perfect.  Very yummy!

I made the white sugar/brown sugar and oil/applesauce changes.  I also used frozen blueberries but did not thaw them.  I cooked in three small pans for 65 minutes.  My whole family loved it.

One of my favorite things to make quick easy and delicious! I used half brown sugar in place of white. :)

Great recipe. I didn't have blueberries so i used apple and carrots instead. I think in the future i am going to use applesauce instead of oil and switch out some white sugar for brown.

Looking for a little twist on traditional zucchini bread and wow... this is it.  SO MANY COMPLIMENTS!  Although, i found that it made 5 full mini loaves instead of 4.

I did the half n half applesauce/oil and white/wheat flour. I also made 2 large loaves and baked them for 1 hour 10 minutes and they came out perfect. I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because there is way too much sugar in it. I used 2 cups and it's way too sweet. Delicious but way too sweet. Next time I'll halve the sugar as well. Overall, great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I used a GF flour blend with oat and almond flour.
1 1/2 c sugar was plenty: 3/4 brown & 3/4 raw
Combine 1 tsp each of flour, both sugars, cinnamon &
sprinkle in greased pan
Bundt pan takes 1 hr

I made this delicious recipe a few days ago and am now making it again (3 days later). Brought a loaf to work thinking it'd be there for a bit but it was gone in 15 minutes! My husband and I have been craving it every morning and I just finished it off today. The only substitution I made to the recipe was to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. So fresh and so good every time! Thanks for this gem!

I keep coming back to this recipe for zucchini bread.  It's healthy and I substitute white flour for whole wheat, I add flax seeds and walnuts.  My family LOVES it and I have 6 children to please.

Every year I plant a couple zucchini plants, and every year I am at my wit's end about what to do with all my zucchini! This is definitely a recipe I will use again and again. The addition of blueberries to the bread makes it snap with deliciousness! (And I'm not a huge fan of blueberries!) This is one of the best zucchini bread recipes I have ever come across. Thanks for sharing it with us! Oh, and I made it exactly as directed in the recipe and it turned out perfectly.

I did not change the recipe at all, but I cooked It in two larger loaf pans. It was AMAZING! My boyfriend ate almost a whole loaf by himself and I brought some to my friends at school and one of them has been referring to it as "heaven bread". Great easy recipe.

I say 3 stars, my 7 year old daughter says 5 - so it gets a 4. I had both blueberries and a zucchini I wanted to use up - so tried this. For me it was a little bland and the blueberries didn't pop with flavor as I hoped. I did used a mixer to mix all but the blueberries - so maybe that just melded the flavors together too much. I like that it made 2 (regular size) loaves so I had one for home and one for work - they were both all eaten.

Very good!  Definitely a hit with everyone that tastes it.  Thanks for sharing.  The only tip that I would give is to line the bottom of your bread pan with parchment paper to keep the blueberries from sticking.

I actually did everything the same except I didn't have zucchini, so I used a red apple instead. But it was amazing and I can't wait to try it with the zucchini as well!

This recipe is phenomenal! I just found a new go to recipe. I love the taste of lemon and blueberries together so I added some fresh lemon juice and lemon zest to my loaves.  I also used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2.

"Perfection"...quote from my husband! I also upped the zucchini to 3 cups and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  I made half brown sugar and half white.  Topped with a crumb topping.

So yummy!!!  The only change I made was that I only put a teaspoon of cinnamon because I don't really like a lot of cinnamon mixed with blueberries.  I love how it made a crust around the outside!  Awesome recipe!

I have never used zucchini before and this recipe is to die for!!!! Really easy to do....hand folded everything and didn't drag out the mixer. I think, however, it's actually a little too sweet. I won't use as much sugar next time. I used 1 large loaf pan because I didn't have little ones. I just had to cook it longer. LOVE THIS

Amazing. Did substitute applesauce for 3/4 of the oil and only used 1/4 cup  of oil, and just 1.5 cups of sugar. Incredibly moist. Made muffins instead of mini  loaves, will definitely become a family favorite!!

This is so similar to my Banana Zucchini Bread.  It is wonderful.  I will probably try adding blueberries to my recipe, whic requires more flour because of the bananas
  Next time I get bananas, I will also get blueberries and try them together with Zucchini.  One reviewer at ARM also used a strusel topping and I might try that too.

Omg this is delicious. Especially with the crumble topping that one of the reviewers suggested.

Update for myself: made this in a regular size loaf pan -halved the recipe. Knife kept coming out with gooey batter so I kept  baking and checking on it every 5 min. Ended up overcooking... the gooeyness may have been from the blueberries. Next time will lower temp to 325.

This is a fabulous recipe that I found and it is a hit among all!  It is so wonderful when it is warm with butter.  I make it from zucchini from my lake home garden.

This was really moist and delicious!  I had a large zucchini left from the garden and it was the perfect way to use it.  I substituted frozen wild blueberries which worked fine; just use right from the freezer.  Like many others, I substituted Splenda for some of the sugar as well as 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the white.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

This is an all time favorite at home and as a house gift when travelling.  I adjusted the seasoning from 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to 3/4 tbsp cinnamon and 1/4 tbsp cloves.  That spiced it up nicely!

My new favorite Zucchini bread. I love the blueberries mixed with the zucchini! I did use 1/2 WW flour and 1/2 brown sugar as recommended by other users. I also added about 1-tbl of fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and made a crumb topping out of oats, flour, brown sugar, butter and a dash of cinnamon to add a crunchy topping. These didntt last a day in my house!

this is super good. It actually can make 8 small loaves. If you don't want the blueberries to sink in the bottom, toss them in flour first. Oh and it's not crumbly on the top. the photo in misleading.

This turned out great! I love the blueberries in it. I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 plain yogurt. I also cut the sugar to 2 cups, since that's all I ever use in a bread like this. I misread the ingredients, and used 1 t baking soda, but it still turned out fine. I was able to fill 4 mini loaf pans and make 4 regular size muffins. I had to take the muffins out after 20 minutes. I see why this has so many great reviews.

I made this recipe into mini-muffins and loved it! Bake for 20 min at 350 and the yield was 48. I also substituted half of the flour for whole wheat flour, and half of the oil for 1/2 cup applesauce with great results. I just had one cup of blueberries on had and there were still several blueberries in each mini-muffin.

Super tasty. Although to be honest it took a long time to put together and a freaking long time to bake. I made two large loafs and it took nearly 2 hours to bake all the way through.

Made this in a bundt pan(with the flour spray)the first time and served it plain.  The second time in as many days, I made it in a bundt pan and dusted powder sugar on the top just to make it look a little more festive.  Both adults and children loved it!  Made it exactly as the directions stated (except for the loaf pans).

This recipe doesn't necessarily need another fantastic review, but I still feel the need to add. This "bread" is more like manna from heaven. You don't just eat it, your mouth makes love to it. Like other reviewers, I did use half applesauce, half oil. I used oats, brown sugar, flour and butter for a topping and will def use this recipe again.

I reduced both the vegetable oil and sugar by half, and added a splash of almond milk. It made about a dozen of the super mini loaves.

It was pretty good. Family enjoyed it and loved the blueberrues..but I think I prefer my mother's old time recipe. I did replace half of the oil with applesauce.

Like many others, I subbed half of the oil with an equal amount of apple sauce but I also used 1 cup of white and 1 brown sugar instead. It turned out awesome!

This is wonderful!  I made as is except that I ended up with 5 mini loaves.  For those who thought it was too sweet, it may be because the blueberries were sweet.  My blueberries were plump and tart and blended perfectly with the sweet, moist bread.  You really cannot tell that zucchini is in it.  I will be making this again.

Cinnamon adds a great taste to loaf but overpowers the taste of the blueberries. It is a waste of blueberries when you can't taste them.   Also  ---- too much sugar.

WONDERFUL recipe! I made this last night. Used one bread pan and used the rest of the batter to make muffins. (thought we could have them for breakfast)They turned out SO well that they all disappeared last night. The only thing I changed was the sugar..just cut it back by a 1/4cup. This recipe is going in my keeper folder!

Good recipe.  Used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce. Upped zucchini to 3 cups. Used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Changed baking powder to 3 tsp for making muffins.  Top muffins with crumb topping or cinnamon sugar. Bake for 22 minutes. This freezes well. You can add chopped pecans to batter if you like them. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing, and well worth your time; I got my family and coworkers all to devour this bread KNOWING that there was zucchini in it; they couldn't get enough. I switched out all the veggie oil for applesauce, reduced the sugar by a 1/2 cup and made half of the flour whole wheat. Terrific recipe.

My daughter made this (12years old).  What a great recipe.  Best blueberry muffin I've had in a long time!  We might try going half and half with applesauce and oil next time.  She did 1 1/2 times the recipe.  There was 3 cups of berries in our fridge.  Definitely a keeper!

AMAZING!  And I even goofed up the recipe a bit (plus made it vegan with egg replacement instead of eggs)!

First off, I accidentally used squash instead of zucchini - but I think it actually added to the fantastic moisture.  I know, how do you goof that up?  Welcome to my life...

I also didn't have any loaf pans so I just used a 13x9.

Finally, I forgot to put the cinnamon in until after I had already put the batter in the 13x9, so I sprinkled it all over the top and then swirled it into the batter.

Seriously - so amazing!  Hubby and kids (and me) can't get enough!  I will definitely be making this again.  I plan to follow some of the healthier replacements other people suggested.

Very moist and delicious. I used frozen blueberries and it turned out perfect. Per other reviews, I did 1/2cup applesauce and 1/2cup oil and I used 2.5 cups shredded zucchini.

Awesome recipe! I did not change a thing but I did make a crumb topping of flour, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon and butter. It tasted like the best blueberry muffin in the shape of a loaf. This recipe will be one that will be passed around and kept in the family forever!

Fabulous! My kids ate all our blueberries while I was at work today, so I had to substitute blackberries. 
Then, I discovered we didn't have enough white sugar, so I had to make the recipe with half white sugar and half light brown sugar.  Still tasted wonderful!

We just picked a bunch of fresh blueberries and I was looking for a good bread recipe.  Oh, my! This is it.  The only thing I changed was that I substituted half of the white sugar for sucanat.  Even if I didn't do that, this recipe still would have been great.  It's not too heavy and lots of blueberries.  I doubled it right away and I am glad I did.  Instead of putting all the batter in mini pans, I put it into 2 regular loaf pans and  3 mini loaf pans. I baked the regular loaf pans for about and hour and 10 min.

I made this in a 9x13 pan (I forgot to note how long I baked it) and it was DELICIOUS.  I have a husband and two small children who gobbled it up and kept asking for more.  The whole pan lasted just over two days!  YUM!  I'm making it for the second time now and I follow the recipe exactly.  Love it.  Thank you!

I loved this, my husband loved it, my kids loved it! made some changes to make it healthier and it still turned out fantastic. Substituted all oil with no-sugar added applesauce; used half whole wheat flour, half white; used only egg whites; used one cup Splenda, one cup regular sugar. Also cooked just one large loaf, and it took about an hour and 15 minutes total time. Going to make more once the next zucchini in the garden gets big enough!

I made this with 1 1/3 cups of sugar, and it was still too sweet. The blueberries add sweetness. Also, I used 1/2 cup of applesauce so that I could reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and that could have added sweetness, but really 2 1/4 cups of sugar is way too much.

My new favorite zucchini bread recipe.  I did add a butter/sugar/flour/cinnamon topping, but otherwise, didn't change anything.  Lots of flavor and moist but not heavy.

Loved this recipe! I made 2 mini loafs and muffins and my siblings and friends thought they were great. You could really taste the cinnamon.  For the blueberries I used frozen ones and they still turned out good. Even people who don't like zucchini should try these. *For the muffins do about 20 minutes in the oven.

Wonderful! I changed flour to 1/2 wheat and 1/2 all purpose. Changed oil to 1/2 canola and 1/2 applesauce. Added a tsp. of lemon extract.

Great recipe as is!  Such a wonderful change of pace from the usual cinnamon raisin zucchini or chocolate zucchini bread recipes.  I am going to make this again next weekend with another batch of zucchini.  I want to try adding lemon zest and/or lemon verbena to the recipe.  Best tip I got was after rinsing the blueberries is to coat them in flour.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made small change, instead of 1 cup oil, i did half oil, half applesauce.  I found that this turned out a little too sweet, not sure if it was because of the applesauce.  Will make again, but maybe use a little less sugar if using applesauce.

I made some suggested changes and a few of my own and it came out great! 
First I subbed half wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. Then half applesauce for oil and I used coconut oil for the other half. I upped the baking soda to 2 tsp and the baking powder to 1 tsp(by accident, but it worked out fine). And I used only 2 cups of sugar.
Then because my oldest doesn't like biting into stuff in his bread I pureed the blueberries and drained out a little of the juice. I shredded the zucchini small and pressed out as much of the juice as I could as well. 
This made 6 mini loaves for me. Kitchen tested, kid approved. ;) Thanks for all the suggestions everyone! :)
Next time I am going to try replacing half the sugar with some stevia for a lower carb option.

I found this bread was rather bland. Perhaps I missed something? I do like the addition of blueberries.

I made it as is other than I halved the recipe and only had one loaf rather than 2 mini loaves (half the 4).  When halving the recipe, you can only do one egg as it is very hard to get 1 1/2 egg.  I put in 1/2 cup of white whole wheat and one cup of white flour.  That's the only adjustments I made.  It was way too sweet.  There was way too much oil.  I had no problems with it sticking.  It was kind of crumbly and didn't hold together too well when slicing pieces off of it.  My husband loved it though but he loves all things that are very very sweet.  The blueberries were a good addition to the vanilla and the cinnamon.  Next time I will reduce the sugar and substitute some yogurt for the oil.

Yummy! I used 2 cups frozen shredded zucchini with all the liquid and substituted the 1 cup oil with a 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 oil as well as reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup and using half white sugar and half brown sugar. I didn't have mini pans so I used two regular bread pans and baked them for a little longer but kept a close eye to make sure. I will love using this recipe!

I think this is a good recipe, but i agree with others that 1 cup oil is too much. Cut it by half and use 1/2 applesauce or greek vanilla yogurt (and cut the sugar a little). The second time i did this and I substituted a 1/2c whole wheat flour for all purpose. I used frozen Maine blueberries which I like for baking because they are nice and small.

OK so there might be something more delicious in this world, but I am not so sure.  Used cookiequeen's suggestions (part brown sugar, more zucchini) and made her struesel topping - this is unbelievably good.  I made it in loaf pans also. Certainly will be a regular recipe in my repertoire.

Oh my goodness... SO YUMMMMMM!  I did a 1.5 batch and made two larger loafs as well as a few muffins... I had to use dried blueberries, which probably wern't as good as fresh but still tasted nice in this recipie... like others recommended I added the crumble topping... it sounded like a decent recipie, but I never exspected it to be this good!

This really is the BEST recipe for Zucchini bread ever!  I ended up adding some yogurt and sour cream because I added to much Zucchini and the batter was stiff.  I made into muffins and put blueberry jam into the middle...DELISH!

Wow...these are delicious!  I was looking for a recipe to make to get more goodness in my child who is a picky eater.  These hit the spot! I followed others advice and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  Used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 and 1/4 cups white.  I also added a pinch of allspice and tossed the blueberries in flour before adding to keep them from sinking to the bottom. I made muffins and the recipe yielded about 23 muffins for me.  I baked at 375 for 25-28 min.  I also chopped my zucchini into almost a puree so it wouldnt be so noticeable to my kid.  Definitely a keeper!

This is really good bread. Instead of using 1 cup oil, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I also added a cinnamon streusel topping. Yum!

Absolutely the best!  I don't know why, but it is!  I added almost 3C of zucchini just because I wanted to get rid of it, and we had some berry applesauce that I used in place of some of the oil.

I used frozen bl berries - all I had. coated in flour while still frozen and added to batter.  It took longer to cook -it's fabulous recipe (pretty sugary sweet tho).  Crumble to (which made it sweeter but added to the texture) as suggested by others put it over the top.

Very very sweet. Almost too sweet. I would add less sugar next time and a pinch more salt. Moist though. Took 60 minutes to bake rather than the 50 called for, and I used a disposable aluminum bread pan.

Wow...these were AMAZING! My extremely picky 9 year old had no idea there was zucchini in them. (Made them in to muffins.) The only thing I did was add the crumb topping.

DELICIOUS!! Thank you Laura - very moist & full of flavour.  The zucchini disappears.  Bundt pan worked perfectly with this recipe - cooked for an hr but watch closely as oven's cook at different temperatures. (Threw in a ripe banana & that worked, too)

Also made an fresh orange juice/lemon glaze but not necessary.

Best Zuchini bread recipe I've tried.  I changed up the recipe by using whole wheat flour and it turned out awesome!   Also split recipe in half and used semi-sweet chips instead of blueberries so I could please my whole household.

This was my first zucchini bread recipe and it was the absolute greatest! My dad usually can't eat banana bread b/c it's so sweet but this didn't hurt his teeth because of the balance between the zucchini and the sugar i did 2 cups of white and 1/4 cup sugar. It was really great. But the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was, the recipe says 350 for 50 min. They had it totally wrong, if your going to do it for 350 it needs to be in for 1 hour and 20 min. So if you want it to take less time then that your going to have to raise the heat. 
But over all I will definitely be making it again!

This was a big hit at work and with my teenagers!  Very moist and flavorful.  The blueberries were tart and off set by the sugar.  It made 5 of the mini loaf pans for me.

What to do with all the Zucchini's??? Make this delicious bread! We are watching our diets so I made some health conscious substitutions. Apple sauce for oil & 1/2 sugar for Splenda. The bread didn't rise as much as I would imagine it would had I made it exactly as written. The taste with the healthy substitutions was still fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fan-friggin-tastic! I followed the recipe as is, the only deviation being that I don't have mini-loaf pans so I used one large pan for baking. This smelled amazing while baking and cooling. My husband and I both loved the final product. I will definitely make again.

Really good.  I used Splenda white sugar blend - 1 cup and 2 tablespoons - too sweet, cut down the sugar next time. Made my long tin and the small round cake tin.

I cut down the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  I also used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I baked them into muffins in about 22 minutes.  Hubby and kids loved them.

I love to bake and wanted to make something with my blueberries. The only thing I changed in the recipe was substituting half of the white sugar for brown sugar. This was an amazing bread! Everyone I baked it for loved it. No one could tell there was any zucchini in there. Also, if you don't have as much time, make muffins from this recipe (I forgot the time I baked them...16-18 minutes, I think?) They come out as very moist and dense muffins :)

***update: I baked them in a 13x9 glass pan at 350 for 50 minutes, turning the pan around once in the middle. That works too!

This is excellent, made just as the recipe reads.  I did add a light glaze drizzled on top.  Conf. sugar, milk, butter, vanilla and 1/2 tsp. lemon juice.  Will be making this again for sure!

This recipe is awesome.  I use whole grain flour instead of all-purpose, raw sugar instead of white sugar and coconut oil.  I was a little concerned at first when the batter turned out more like cookie dough, however it turned out beautiful and flavorful.

Everyone loved it and didn't even realize there was zucchini in it!  I added walnuts because we love them in all fruit breads. I'm thinking this will probably replace my annual banana bread gifts this Christmas.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly except I used more blueberries.  It was really delicious.  I made part into muffins and the remainder into a loaf of bread.  We all love zucchini bread but the addition of blueberries makes it even better.  I'll be preparing this recipe a LOT.  Next time I might use part brown sugar instead of all white but that's the only change I'd think of making.  Thanks!

This was fantastic! I tweeked it a little, used egg beaters instead of real eggs, and used applesauce instead of oil. I didn't have fresh blueberries, so I used the store brand of frozen blueberries, and wowzers, it was soooo good.  I made 12 muffins and 2 mini loaves with this recipe.

Moist and yummy! I will make this again and again. Per other suggestions, I used 3 C zucchini, 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C oil. I used two regular sized cake pans and baked them for 55 minutes. I am not usually a very good baker but this recipe turned out great.

This recipe was wonderful.  It made 5 loaves instead of 4.  It did take about 10 minutes longer to bake.  The blueberries dominated the flavor. It was very refreshing. I added sugar on the top before baking and I wont do that again.  It makes a mess when slicing and doesnt stay on.  I will definitely make this again, without the sugar.

I added an extra cup of zucchini and about 1/2 cup extra fresh blueberries.  I also substituted 3/4 cup brown sugar for part of the white sugar and sprinkled the tops with turbinado sugar before baking which added a nice crunch.  This made 3 disposable loaf pans and had to bake for an additional 15 minutes.  This was very good and I will definately make again.

I prefer this zucchini bread than any other zucchini bread.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I did have a hard time getting the bread to cook all of the way through but I will keep working at it.  Update: I halved the recipe and here are a few tips.  1) if you can't find zucchini grate 2 italian squash with a box grater, 2) use about a cup and half of shredded italian squash, 3) use 2 eggs, 4) thaw frozen blueberries 5) use 1.5 cups of blueberries and 6) bake in a 9X5 metal loaf pan for 48-50 minutes.  Enjoy warmed with butter...divine!

Yum! I was getting ready to leave for a vacation, and was concerned about some zucchini I had been given going bad while I was gone. I also happened to have blueberries that I also didn't want going bad. Perfect solution! I followed other user's suggestions, and used 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil, and was happy to increase the fruit content. It was so easy, my 2-year old even had a blast helping by both mixing, and adding the blueberries all by herself (one at a time, but hey, she was happy). I made 2 full-size loaves and baked them for 1 hr. 15 min and they came out perfectly. Nice and moist, slightly dense. I still have one large zucchini left. Debating whether to take it on my trip and make another batch while away.

8/3/2010 Best bread recipe ever!!!!!  I know this recipe is called blueberry zucchini bread, however, I added dried cranberries and cherries along with the blueberries.  I was out of zucchini.  It was a big hit with my family.

6/15/2018 Still the best zucchini blueberry bread.  I blended the zucchini well.  It was great!!!   My family still loves it.

WOW   What a awesome treat.  My family and I loved this and it was eaten very quickly.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I used too much zucchini (because I had extra) I wouldn't recomend that it makes it wet.  But still so so good

I made this as a treat to bring to church, and I have to say, this was a HUGE success.  I followed the recipe exactly, making not a single change.  It was perfect.  Moist, flavorful, easy to make.  I will say for my personal tastes, I think the next time I make this, I am going to add chopped walnuts to it.  I used fresh blueberries and fresh zucchini (both from the farmers market just that morning).  Seriously, this is probably one of the easiest and tasty recipes I've made in a long time.  I really recommend trying it.  Oh, and it was a huge hit at church!

Soooooo good just the way it is!  I did not change a thing and have made this 4 times in 1 week.  People keep requesting it so I keep making it!  Do be aware that if you make a reg. size loaf cooking time increases about 20 min.  Thanks so much for the GREAT recipe!

Outstanding!  One large homegrown zucchini, along with 3 pts of amazing Michigan blueberries just yielded 12 loaves of bread!  I added the crumb topping to half of them.  This is going to be the new classic and a fantastic addition to my "signature" dishes!

This is the best Zucchini bread ever! Without blueberrys this bread seems bland to me but the blueberrys increase the flavor. With our garden abundant with zucchini, I gave a friend one and 2 boxes of blueberries and this recipe and they too loved it.

Terrific!  I made it just as is.  Wonderful, moist, tasty.  The first time I made it, I found that  it was a little too much batter for 4 mini-loaf pans- they dripped over while baking.  The next time I split it among 6 pans.  Perfect little loaves and no messy oven!  Freeze well also.

Excellent zucchini bread!  I used 6 mini-loaf pans; and to lighten up on the oil, I used 3/4 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.

Despite an overflowing pan situation (even with using some batter for 6 regular-size muffins in addition to the four mini loaves), the bread was delicious!  It was a little on the sweet side (although no complaints, really), so next time I may follow some previous advice and use a bit less sugar and try to incorporate some whole wheat flour.  All-in-all, an excellent go-to, easy recipe for the copious amounts of zucchini in the summer!  I froze 3 of the loaves, hopefully they will keep well.

YUM!!!!! The only thing I will do different is add more blueberries. These were melt in your mouth good. I just got a case of blueberries and need to use them in other ways besides fruit smoothies and muffins. Thanks Laujra.

This was so moist! Followed the recipe almost to the end but could not help my self and made some changes! After shredding the Zucchini I like to put it in a bowl with some salt( about 1 tsp) and let it sit for 15 min. There is allot of water in Zucchini and Salt renders most of the extra water out. You can do that with cucumbers too! Then rinse the shredded zucchini under running water and squeeze the extra water out as much as possible! I take fresh blueberries and freeze it befor adding to the dough, that way they stay whole and don't get mushy when stired with havy dough! I cooked it about 30 minutes longer then suggested in this recipe! Great the next day with cream cheese! Enjoy!

I just made this recipe tonight and it is absolutely the best bread I have made yet! (and I have made many, many, different kinds of bread) My family ate a loaf warm and I shared with the neighbors, who also loved it. I used fresh picked zucchini and blueberrys.  Thanks for an awsome addition to my bread recipe collection!

Too sweet.  Reduce sugar by at least 1/2 cup.  Not enough zucchini.  Increase by 1 cup.

I've been making these the past three years when our zucchini comes in. The ONLY change I make is to make muffins instead, and add a streusal topping. I get about 30 muffins, they bake in 30 minutes. It's the only recipe I use now.

Very good as written.  I took about half of the bread to my husband's oncologist's office for the patients receiving chemo(a small snack helps the nausea) and it was gone with requests to bring more next week!  I better get grating! Thanks for the recipes

I made this yesterday and it was great.  Used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup wheat flour.  Will being making this over and over, nice change from the chocolate zucchini bread I had been making.

This is a great bread.  I had two loaf pans so it only took half the time to bake.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 3/4 cup and used half oil/half apple sauce as others suggested.  The bread looks beautiful and tastes good too.

I just made the four loaves as the directions stated only added chopped pecans. Gave one away to the neighbor and we devoured two. I can't wait for breakfast so I can eat it again :)

This was yummy and easy!  I followed other reviewers and used sugar and splenda.  Next time, I will substitute some of the oil for applesauce in order to make it a bit healthier.  My super picky nephew even loved these!  I didn't tell him there was zucchini in it until after he ate. :)

I'm confounded by all the great reviews.  We thought this was just okay--won't make it again--a definite waste of beautiful home grown blueberries (and even zucchini).  Even the kids don't like it...the crumb topping suggested by cookiequeen was by far the best part.

This was excellent bread and made great use of the gigantic zucchini I grew in the garden.  If I make it again, I will use less sugar and more zucchini.

Mmmm... good stuff. I actually skipped all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil 'cause I grated too much zucchini. I used a little brown sugar, some demerara sugar, and some white. I also used half raspberries and half blueberries. I know that lots of people get angry when a reviewer changes that much about a recipe and still has the nerve to review it, but I have a feeling that just as it was it would be just as good. Moist, not too sweet and a great way to showcase a shopping spree at a local fruit and vegetable stand. Again, mmmmmm....

Perfection - best zucchini bread ever, and the blueberries send it over the edge!  I did do slight alterations per the previous reviewers - 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil, and also 2 cups of sugar.  My zucchini bread-hating husband even loved this, as did my picky toddler  :o).

We just made this for a Mother's Day brunch and the recipe yielded 3 deliciously flavorful and moist loaves. They took a bit longer to bake, but that was because the pans were pretty full. Very, very yummy and the slices were gone in minutes. Thanks for sharing!

A friend gave me a HUGE zucchini last summer, and I found this recipe for it. I make these as muffins and they never last long in our house. This summer I'm growing my own zucchini, just for this recipe!  The only modification I make is I substitute the vegetable oil with an equal amount of applesauce or extra zucchini. I also use 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white. The brown sugar is a nice touch, and the muffins certainly weren't lacking in sweetness.  Love them!

I made some changes, and really liked the results!  Used 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. spelt flour, 1 c. brown rice flour.  Used 1 c. agave nectar instead of 2c. sugar and it was PLENTY sweet!  Also, substituted 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. sunflower oil, plus 2 "Flax eggs" and only 1 regular egg.  Made it healthy... and still delicious!  Crumble topping was 1/4 c. spelt flour, 1/4 c. evaporated cane juice, 2 T. applesauce, and 1/2 t. cinnamon.  YUM!!!

I just finished sampling this recipe and let me say just this...WOW!  This is a wonderfully moist bread that I sincerely hope freezes well.  Otherwise I'm afraid there will not be a morsel left in our house by morning.  I made a crumb topping as other reviewers have and included the zest of one lemon.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I'm looking forward to this years zucchini crop now!

This was wonderful. I was looking for a recipe to use of some blueberries, and when i came across this I realized I also had 2 zucchini's sitting in the fridge, which is exactly how much you need. I ran out of white sugar so I only used 3/4 white sugar and another 1 1/4 cup brown sugar. Everything else was the same. Not overly sweet, just perfect. I cant wait to try the crumb topping on it as others mentioned next time I make it.

Everyone loves this bread!! During the summer I make fresh loaves to take to my Dr.'s office and at Christmas time a mini loaf goes into a goodie basket for neighbors and friends. A fresh loaf won't last thru the day at my house. I have been making this for a year now with nothing but raves!!

Delicious!  I had to make this twice in two days since my family ate it all up before I even got to try it myself!  I made this exactly as stated using zucchini and blueberries I had stored in the freezer.  I did use two large loaf pans rather than the mini loaf pans and I did substitute 1/2 of the flour with sifted wheat flour for a little health boost.  I didn't have any applesauce on hand but I would like to try to use half applesauce and half oil next time because a cup of oil does seem a little unnessary for the waistline.  ;)  Alltogether a great recipe and I expect many requests for this in the future from my family!  Thank you so much!

This was quite tasty, but I see no need to put that much sugar in them.  I cut it down and it was still delicious and plenty sweet.  I also subbed out 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  It may have been that I used to many zuchinni or didn't drain the zuchinni enough.  The bread turned out a bit burnt on the bottom and soggy and undercooked in the center.  I think next time I will try using 2 larger loaf pans and cooking it longer.

Love it!  My husband and kids don't like zucchini, but i had gotten a few from family.  I made this recipe and told them it was blueberry bread-they inhaled it!  After, I told them there was grated zucchini in it, they were surprised!

This recipe is wonderful! I baked for about an hour and twenty minutes.  I dusted the inside of the pans with sugar, and this made a crispy, sweet crust.  It was even better the second day.

this recipe was really good but on a healthier note i made some  minor adjustments. i used 3 egg whites.3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 canola oil in place of veg. oil.2 cups of brown sugar in place of the white. used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour. was just as good. i love this recipe. its even good without the blueberries.

Pretty good, I don't think that either the blueberry or the zucchini shine more than the other. They just sort of get along really well, and make a tasty bread. I didn't add the topping- cutting calories- and it was still really good.

This recipe gets better and better each time I make it.  I like to make smaller loaves and give them as gifts.  This last time, I ran out of white sugar, so I subbed 1/2 cup of white sugar for dark brown sugar (it's all I had!), and it turned out deliciously!

Absolutely PERFECT!!  No need to change a thing.  Be sure to really grease the pans as the blueberries will stick.  My batch was enough for 4 mini loaves and 1 mini bundt.

Very tasty and moist.  I doubled the recipe, reducing the sugar by a cup, and using apple sauce in place of half the oil.  Makes great muffins as well.

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I made them in muffin pans as well as loaf pans.  I've tried it with other fruits (one batch with pureed strawberry and rhubarb, another with pineapple, cherry & coconut) and they were great.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly, took longer than 50 minutes for my two medium loaves to cook.. closer to 1 hour 15 minutes.  My husband kept saying how wonderful it smelt while baking and we both thought it tasted just as good!

I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups of dark brown sugar (might try honey or molasses next time) used whole wheat flour instead of white cut the oil to 1/2 cup and just added more zucchini added ground flax seed next time I think I will add grated carrot as well. Made them into muffins instead of bread for a grab and go breakfast

I'd like to give it more stars if I could. I've tried it 1. as written, 2. with a crumb topping (sinful) and with whole wheat pastry flour subbed for 1/2 the regular flour. They've all turned out well! Not just for summertime; I'll use frozen blueberries and zucchini for the rest of the year!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I've made it twice now, and my guys love it.  I used frozen blueberries, so I put in a whole 16 oz. package--didn't bother thawing them.  I have a Wilton pan w/eight 2 1/2" by 3 1/2" loaves in one pan--baked for 25 minutes.  Perfect!

I can't believe I forgot the brown sugar on top. I ate them hot because I could not stop myself. Very moist and the blueberries need to be fresh.  I also added wheat flower and an oil substitute.

This bread was excellent. I would give it more stars if I could. I followed the recipe completely, except I added chopped walnuts (my husband's request). It was easy to make and very moist. I took a loaf to work and it was a big hit. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This will now be our only zucchini bread recipe!  I also added some extra zucchini just because I had it on hand.  I made this in two regular size loaf pans and baked for 1 hour, 20 minutes.  Delicious!

I had great compliments on this bread as I shared it at work, I used Olive oil instead of vegetable & I also used to cut up the Zucchini with my tupperware chopper which worked great instead of shredding.

This is wonderful!!!  My neighbor who hates zucchini bread ate a whole loaf without evening realizing it was zucchini!  I also "healthified" the recipe slightly ... I divided the flour in half and used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour.  The sugar was split into half brown sugar and half regular sugar.  I also eliminated the oil and used an equal amount of natural applesauce.  Other than substituting healthier ingredients, I followed the recipe totally as-is.  I did set my oven for convection baking, and all four mini-loaves were done in about 40 minutes.  (So you might need to adjust the time if your oven bakes differently.)  As a fun trial, we also kept the recipe as-is and substituted mini-chocolate chips instead of blueberries.  My kids loved both!!!  Enjoy!  :)

Ok.  Too much cinnamon for me.  I think it could have used more zucchini as well. I don't think I will make again.

This bread was great! I substituted 1 C. applesauce for all of the oil, used a flax seed/water mixture for one of the eggs and used 2 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. all purpose. I also cut down the sugar. So even making the bread 'healthy' it tastes great.

So Good! Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Baked it in 2 loaf pans for 45 min. All of the kids loved this! UPDATE: I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil for the first time in a recipe. I couldn't tell the difference. I made 24 muffins and a small loaf. Cooked for 25-27 min.

I followedthe advice of others & made a few changes that were good.  extra zucchini, subbed 1/2 of flour with wheat & a dash of nutmeg.  I also did the topping which really made it to die for--butter, sugar, br. sugar, oatmeal & flour.  equal amounts...I think the topping could be improved upon...maybe less butter next time so it is more crumbly.  Very good recipe!

As stated, this recipe is YUMMY.  The only change I made was to cut the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown.  I made muffins, and they cooked in 23 minutes...Just delicious!

My family really liked this bread--definitely not too sweet so I wouldn't cut down on the sugar.  I did substitute 1/4 brown sugar for white sugar, and used frozen instead of fresh blueberries.  Oh, and 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2.  I made 4 small loaves and 1 large, cooked for 1 hour.

Amazingly yummy!  I did not alter the recipe at all; perfect as is!  I made one loaf of bread and made the rest into muffins.  I will be making this recipe again!

AWESOME! I did add chocolate chips which just made it even better. Also, coated loaf pan with sugar before adding batter.

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was just perfect!  It was moist and it was a hit with all our family and friends.  I put them into mini loaf pans (8 in a pan) instead of the regular loaf pan.  I am making these all the time for friends and neighbours and of course my family!  What a perfect recipe for anytime of the day!  Thanks for sharing it.

It's baking now, but I am scared.......i mixed up the sprinkle for the mini loaf pans I read in one review( cinnamon,  sugar, brown sugar, nutmeg) but mistakenly used 1 tsp of all....but it says only 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I am so hoping that does not ruin the whole thing.  I am giving it 5 stars...because I cam't imagine this being bad when made correctly.

Delicious!  Followed other's recommendations for a crumb topping, and it is great!  I used 2 cups white sugar, and 1/4 c dark brown sugar.  Bread turned out pretty dark in color, next time I will use light brown sugar instead, but tastes great.  My 3 year old wont stop eating it, and said it's tastes like pie!

this recipe is excellent !! i agree with other members it is a kid friendly recipe. my girls did help make it.i however did make one change to the recipe. i did not have blue berries so i used fresh black berries and drain off the juice before adding them to the dough. it was really good , have had people brag on the taste and some did say they thought it tasted better then the regular way to make zucchini bread. i even made it today. next time i go to the store will definitely purchase the blue berries .

The only thing I changed was to add 1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries and the 10 or so blueberries that I had on hand in the garden.  But with the moisture from the raspberries I needed to bake 10 min. longer.  Great!! thanks for sharing.

This was really good. I substituted applesauce for the oil and added more zucchini because I had extra and didn't want it go to waste. I made two large loaves. Will definitely make it again.

Yummy - kids and hubby loved it.  I used one cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Plenty sweet might see about reducing it a tad.  I made the two larger loaves and baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes.  Next time will try reducing the oil using applesauce.

I made the four mini loaves so I could share them and keep some for my little family.  Me, my husband and my 3 yr old son ate two of the loaves ourselves.  Everyone loved it! I've never been much of a baker but this recipe was easy and turned out great!

This is the best zucchini bread that my husband and I have ever tasted.  It is moist and delicious.  I added the crumble topping that one of the reviewers suggested (exchanging pecans for walnuts) and used 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  Thank You!!!

I really love this recipe. I didn't put all the sugar in. I used 1 3/4 cup of sugar. I also chopped walnuts and put on the top while baking rather than put directly in the batter. Enjoyed this particular recipe.

Very tasty.  I did use 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil, and I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  It was plenty sweet.  I think next time I will add either more cinnamon or cinnamon and nutmeg.

this is "mom's zucchini bread" w/blueberries...i'm not sure if that has been mentioned yet.  anyhow, there was operator error on this side.  it took waaay longer (like 90 mins) for my bread to cook.  and that was just one loaf.  so i improvised and decided to go with a pancake making method.  Voila!!  they are wonderful.  my kids love it...as a pancake or slice.  like other reviews i should have cut the sugar cause they are a bit SWEET but that is fine.  i will definitley be making this again.

The 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil worked beautifully.  Moist and lovely.   Glad the blueberries were in the recipe because it would've definitely been "missing something".

LOVE this recipe. I'm guilty of making changes right away (half oil half applesauce, 2 c white sugar .25 cup brown and 3 cups zuke). Fab recipe, great flavor, super moist and delish! Made muffins and added some flax and crumb top to some half of them. Thanks for the recipe!

delicious, moist and flavorful.  to make it healthier, i substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for half of the oil and also mixed in some ground flax seed.  i also sprinkled chopped pecans over the top of the batter before baking.  oh, and for those who were wondering: 2 cups of shredded zucchini = 2 fairly small zucchini or 1 medium/large zucchini.

Made 2 loafs with the one recipe.  Also made it healthier by doing half wheat flour, half white.  Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used applesauce instead of oil.  Great way to use the zucchini from the garden

great recipe that i will definitely make again.  i used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 zucchini (which only gave me 1 cup).  definitely dont need all the sugar.  i would reduce that by half and it still should be great.  also, i put it in 2 loaf pans.  there were ALOT of blueberries in it so if you arent a huge fan, maybe decrease those.  thanks so much for the recipe!  my kids ate a whole loaf in one day!

This was ok, I just don't think we are fans of the combo and just prefer a zucchini bread by itself. We didn't even fiish the bread before it got moldy which is just weird for us.

Very good recipe! So simple and moist. It was more like blueberry bread than zucchini. Next time I will add more zucchini. Other than that, great as is!

My toddler (20 months) and all of her little friends LOVE this bread (I make mini muffins).  I use 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 all purpose, and use a little more zucchini than is called for...more like three cups...and reduce the sugar to two cups and use 1/2 brown, 1/2 white.  They are so delicious!!

Excellent.  I followed others' suggestions and used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 vegetable oil.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Made into muffins.

This recipe was really good!  I tried the suggested streusel recipe by cookiequeen and that made it even better.  I doubled the recipe but reduced the sugar to 3 cups.  2 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  It was still plenty sweet and really moist with 5 cups of grated zucchini.  Next time I might make it with honey and applesauce to replace some of the oil!

This was heavenly divine. Instead of using 2 1/4 c sugar, I used 3/4 white sugar and 1 1/4 c brown sugar. I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top before putting in the oven. Delicous!

I am not sure what happened...  I used an aluminum pan and the bread was pretty doughy still after the time was up.  I should have baked it longer but the top seemed well cooked so I turned it out onto the counter only to discover the bottom was still pretty much uncooked.  I think next time I will used a glass pan and see if that helps - at least I can see through to the bottom to check for doneness!  I am giving it 4 stars because I believe this was operator error and it was still delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a little more zucchini than the recipe calls for because I had a huge one to use up.  I also used whole wheat flour to make the recipe a little healthier and the texture was still wonderful.  I love the blueberries!  I made muffins and they turned out great even though I forgot to put in the extra baking powder.  I will definitely make these again!

This Blueberry Zucchini Bread was tasty but very dry. It was much better with a cream cheese spread. I cut back a little on the sugar and that came out well. I might try it again with more zucchini so it will possibly be more moist. It this doesn't make it more moist I wouldn't make it again.

This was super easy to make and super yummy to eat. I used dried blueberries because that's what I had on hand. I soaked the dried blueberries for 20 minutes in hot water to plump them up and no one would ever know the difference once it's all baked in. I'll be making this one again, and again.

This bread is so good!  I substituted the vegetable oil with a third olive oil, a third canola oil, and a third applesauce.  I had fresh frozen blueberries to use, they worked fine. I made some muffins out of part of the batter, and baked the rest in a large loaf pan.  This bread is very moist and has good flavor.

WOW! This is the best zucchini bread I have ever made! Cook time for me was 55 minutes. I made one batch to start with and then ended up making several more to give to friends and neighbors. Have had several requests for the recipe already. My children loved it too. I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!

Made it today- ate it today!  I mixed white/brown sugars instead of just white and added a little pumpkin pie spice.   It had a wonderful crust on top with a moist middle.  Blueberries and zucchini?  Who would've thought?

This recipe seems to be very forgiving because I made some alterations and it still came out very well.  Used about half the oil (olive) because that is all I had left - used half and half splenda/brown sugar (about 2 cups total) for the sugar, and half and half wheat/white flour.  I also used one regular loaf pan and had to cook probably about 20 min longer than listed.  Came out really tasty though.  Smells AWESOME while baking!

Yum yum yum, awsome bread. I used half white/wheat flour. I made a second batch with frozen blueberries which I don't reccomend, stick with fresh.

Very good!  I changed it up by using...

-1/2 cup "Lighter Bake" (prune puree) instead of oil (fat free but still good)
-1 1/3 cup fructose instead of table sugar (lower glycemic index sugar but not an artificial sweetener)
-1 cup whole wheat flour 2 cups white

Next time I think I'll use raisins instead of blueberries because we LOVE raisins.

Excellent recipe! Fresh blueberries worked very well. I did a little brown sugar topping that added a little crunch as well as sweetness to it.

This is an excellent recipe.  The blueberries really keep the bread moist and flavorful.  We'll be using some of our garden zucchini to make this one again!

YUM!  I zested 2 lemons and added with the zucchini (which I used 3 cups of only because it is coming out of my ears).  Otherwise I followed recipe exactly--so delicious. thank you for another way to use up my zucchinis.

This is a wonderfully delicious recipe.  Definitely the most moist zucchini bread I have every made.  Did not make any changes to the recipe, my husband and I both loved it.  Will make again for sure.

This is very good. Per a few other suggestions, I put a topping on top but think I'll leave it off next time. There's enough sugar in this bread as it is so there's no need to add more in a topping or under the batter. It's great without anything else added. Thanks for a great recipe filled with fruit and vegetables!

I made it into a coffee cake to take to a potluck.I made 1 1/2 times the posted amount.It made enough for 13x9 glass pan and a little loaf pan.I baked at 325 for about 1 1/4 hour.I made many of the same changes that other posters made~whole wheat pastry flour,1/2 applesauce for oil (used unsweetened,apple-blueberry),brown sugar for white and only 2 1/4 cups in all(plenty sweet for me,even w/out crumb topping),a little more zucchini~3 1/2 c. in all,a little more baking soda(for the extra acidity in brown sugar) and a crumb topping with 3/4 c. each brown sugar and flour and 6 Tb.butter cut in.Several people asked me to write down the recipe for them! It really was excellent!

Good, easy recipe to follow.  I didn't have any blueberries on hand so I added shredded apple to the mix.  I have a habit of making recipe's without reading them through first...so I didn't realize how much batter this was going to make until I was actually mixing it altogether.  I ended up pouring it all into a bundt pan and it came out great.  I also forgot to add the vanilla...and I'm a freak about vanilla but it came out okay.  I don't usually  mess around with recipe's on the first go around but this one is so easy you can do what you want with it and it will still come out great!

This was very good! It was so good, that I baked 2 loaves in the morning and by the same afternoon my family of 5 had them both gone. I was a little hesitant about the blueberries being paired with cinnamon. The pair just didn't seem like a good combo to me. However, I was completely wrong. The blueberries give this a nice added flavor and the cinnamon is barely noticeable.

Was really moist and flavorful...especially good with fresh picked blueberries.

I also substituted 1/2 and 1/2 on oil and applesauce, along with using whole wheat flour instead of regular flour.

This is one of the yummiest breads I've made in a while.  I did make it with a crumb topping, but I think it would be good with or without.  Subbing some w.w. flour and applesauce are good ways to make this a little more healthy.

Interesting, but a good interesting!  I didn't have any mini loaf pans and after reading some reviews saying using regular loaf pans didn't work, I made these as large muffins in my deep fill muffin tin.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 and I got 11 large muffins from it.  I made all the usual healthy subs.  A great breakfast muffin.

I have made regular zucchini bread which is always yummy but when I had a lot of blueberries on hand I found this recipe was worth a shot.  I am so glad I tried it!  The blueberries complimented the zucchini bread so nicely.  I used 3/4 cup of oil and 2 cups of sugar.  I also used 3 cups of zucchini and it came out perfect.  Thank you for this yummy recipe, I will add this to my favorites!

This is by far the best quick bread recipe I have made!!  I can't say I made it exactly as written because I made one small change.  I only used a half cup of oil and added the rest in applesauce.  The bread was perfectly moist and the flavor was outstanding.  The blueberries shine in this recipe!  I made the recipe and added the whole thing to one bundt pan and it was great.  I didn't watch the time exactly but it did take quite awhile to get done!

I have my second batch of this bread in the oven as I type. We loved it, a nice change from the everyday zucchini bread. It freezes well and I made mine into two large loaves instead. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband loves, loves, loves this bread. I followed the recipe except that I subbed a cup of turbinado sugar for one of the cups of white sugar. I added about 1/2 Cup of chopped walnuts for a bit of texutre. Great flavor. Yum.

I liked this very much!  I would make it again, but I would not say it's the best I have ever had! Nice change, though, from your typical zucchini bread!

WOW!  This is so good!  I followed the recipe except used a 12 muffin pan and 1 regular bread loaf pan.  When I make it again I will add more zucchini and cut some of the sugar, and I may substitute 1/2 banana and 1/2 blueberries.  Yummy!

I used the modifications by cookiequeen and the crumb topping by luv2cook and the bread was absolutely delicious. It is the best zucchini bread I have ever tasted and the blueberries were such a bonus treat! Yum! I had left over  batter after my 4 small loaf pans so I buttered/floured two mini bundt pans. They turned out great too. Great for portable snacks.

SO delicious!!! I did make a few changes based on the other reviews. I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. I subbed 1/4 cup white sugar for brown sugar. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 of all purpose flour. I didn't have as many blueberries as it called for, and it was still fabulous! Can't wait to share it with others.

I never made zucchini bread before, and didn't know what to expect.  This was great!  I followed the suggestions of others by using more zucchini, substituting half the oil with applesauce, and half the flour with whole wheat flour.  The only change I would make next time is using mini loaf pans rather than a large loaf pan like I did this time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummmmm. I made this for my boyfriend this past summer and used fresh zucchini and blueberries from the local market (I prefer buying from local farmers market whenever possible because it’s better for you and tastes much better) I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. My boyfriend has been begging me to make it ever since (did I mention he ate the whole loaf within the week). I think the blueberries really make this recipe – just make sure the blueberries taste good before deciding to make this recipe because sometimes the blueberries at my local grocery are really lacking in flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I'll admit I was skeptical about the blueberry-zucchini combination but I'm sure glad I went ahead and tried it. Very good...may even be my new favorite zucchini bread recipe. Tastes like blueberry muffins especially if you use the full amount of cinnamon called for so if you're thinking of cutting back on it, (like I was) don't.

Absolutely loved this recipe! We poured the batter in each loaf pan and then sprinkled fresh blueberries on top.  It was perfect...because the blueberries didn't sink to the bottom and there weren't too many blueberries to make it soggy.

Awesome!  I have doubled the recipe so I can make ten loaves at a time.  Everyone I give these to wants more and/or the recipe!  I have really big and sweet blueberries, so I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup. and the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I have made 50 loaves of bread and still have people ask me when I will be making more!

Yummm!!!  I made these today with some zucchini donated from a friend's garden.  I substituted 1/2 cup white sugar with brown sugar.  And made them as muffins instead. It made about 30 muffins, so I have some to freeze.  Again, super good!

This is incredible!  We added walnuts to the mix for some crunch...it's a hit in our home.

Such a nice break from traditional zuchini bread.  I, too, applied a cinnamon crumb topping.  So moist.

This is sooooo yummy.  I'm going to try it with raspberries as well.  I finally found a way for my hubby to help eat the zucchini.

Delicious! I made this for the first time today, and even though I forgot to put the baking soda in, this bread still came out moist and tasted fantastic. I never would have thought of putting blueberries in zucchini bread, what a nice change of pace. Thank you!

I can't give this a fair rating because I tweaked the recipe. I was trying to go the healthy route and I subbed applesauce for the oil and I think it affected the texture. It came out somewhat gummy (very similar to a dessert we made back home) but the taste is wonderful.

This bread was so yummy I couldnt stop eating it!!  The top was crispy which I loved!!  I did have a little trouble with it baking all the way through so i had to bake it for longer.  The first loaf was still a little gooey in the middle but the flavor was still wonderful.  I also didnt have zucchini so I use cumcumber intstead, it still tasted like the first time I made it.
