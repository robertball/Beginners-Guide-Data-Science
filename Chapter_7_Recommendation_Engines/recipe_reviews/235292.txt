These were good.  I liked the butter between the folds of the rolls.  Will make again!  Great addition to any dinner.

I did not use the recipe for rolls,  I followed it however, while kneading it I realized it had a texture simular to many standard breads.  Instead I made 4 small (5 inch diameter)round loaves I used for bread bowls with a soup, and used the remainder to make a large loaf which I braided to give it more pizazz.  The texture and the taste are very nice, just a hint of sweetness, which added to the soup I'd made.  Good stuff, I save it for future use.

Only thing I did different was use my Kitchen aid mixer with dough hook to knead the dough. Also put some in freezer to see how they would do. Fresh ones were great and frozen were pretty darn good!

Seemed to be dense and on the dry side.
