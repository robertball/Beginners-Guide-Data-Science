The only thing I changed was to omit the tomatoes. 
The sandwiches were delicious! I eyeballed all the other amounts. Four stars because I wouldn't mix tomatoes and cranberries.

Hands down one of my favorite leftover ideas.  The bacon is a great addition.  The only thing I changed was I added stone ground mustard instead of Mayo, but that's just me!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husbands favorite sandwich of all time.  Rather than toasting the bread in the broiler I spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the cut side of the bread and toast it in a non stick skillet.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I made it to use up some Thanksgiving turkey and homemade cranberry sauce I had made. I used lite mayo and butter and just added it to taste. I didn't think the ingredients all blended together, but what made this sandwich was the cranberry sauce. I will definitely use that as a condiment, in the future, on a turkey sandwich.

One of my all-time favorites, although I did modify mine a little. I did not use the butter and mayonnaise. I used cream cheese instead. I added finely chopped celery to the cream cheese to give it a little crunch because I also did not use the bacon.  I love bacon, but I didn't have any. It really doesn't matter too much what you use as long as you keep the turkey and the cranberry sauce. That combination is heavenly. It's very good on any seeded bread. Very hearty and rustic that way. I also added alfalfa sprouts.

instead of provolone cheese, i use smoked gouda - it compliments the turkey and the bacon perfectly. i also omit the lettuce and tomato. my favorite sandwich of all time :)

I'm allergic to eggs, and can't use mayo, , but what I did was use Catalina dressing and left off the cranberry sauce.  If I use cranberry sauce it's warm and used as  mayo to give sandwich some moisture.
