This was very good!  I made it as a joke for my husband, since he developed a facination with Curling during the Olympics, but it turned out to be an easy, yet flavorful recipe.  I cooked it in the Crockpot, and added some mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

I really wish that I could give this recipe a rating of 3.5 stars.  I don't often leave reviews of recipes, but I just felt that I had to comment on this one.  I followed the recipe just as it was, but added 1/2 cup of diced green peppers and a 4 oz drained can of mushrooms to the dish.  I will say that the flavor of the dish was wonderful, but the meat was tough.  I had to remove the food from the oven, transfer it into a pan and simmer it for another hour before I was satisfied with the tenderness of the meat.  I highly recommend that this recipe be prepared in a crock pot.  As a crock pot recipe, the few ingredients that it calls for, the ease of preparation, the flavor of the sauce, and the tenderness of the meat would have earned it a 5 star rating from me.

I cooked this in the crockpot for dinner last weekend and we ate it on fettucine.  It was wonderful.

I really doctored this up.  I placed my beef in the bottom of my dish and seasoned it really well with pepper, parsley and garlic.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup.  I added a little milk to ease in stirring and added more pepper and garlic.  I added half of a package of onion soup mix and sprinkled the chopped onion as well as some chopped fresh mushrooms over the beef before pouring the soup mix over it.  I baked for 90 minutes and had to add more milk  milk to keep it from becoming goopy.  Next time I add about 1/2 can of milk right off the get go.  My kids asked for thirds and LOVED it over mashed potatoes.  This will definitely be a keeper in our house!

The taste of this dish was delicious, I would recommend putting it in the crock pot because the cooking time in the oven did not leave the meat tender, it was still tough.  Other than that it was wonderful!

Very comforting meal. I added two small cans of drained mushroom pieces and used a whole onion. I also added pepper and stirred in a little worchestershire sauce and sour cream before I served it. I cooked this in my crockpot all day, the stew meat turned out tender and wonderful. I served it over rice for my boys and over potatoes for my husband and I. We all loved it. NOTE: This was extremely cost-effective for me to make. The stew meat I bought marked down and the remaining ingredients I bought cheaply at the Grocery Outlet for half what I would have spent at the corner store. Cooking it in my crockpot cut down on energy costs. Rice and potatoes are always cheap or on sale. All around, I'm quite pleased with this meal.

This recipe is wonderful. I too made a few subsitutions. First I used a 3lb. pork roast chopped into bite size pieces. I fried that in 1/2 cup oil. While the meat was frying I chopped 1 cup onion and 1 cup green pepper. After the meat was browned I removed them from the oil and sauted my onion and green pepper. Drain the oil off and add 3 cans cream of mushroom soup 1 package onion soup mix 1 4oz can drained mushrooms. I also added 3 Tablespoons of the sesame oil. It was kinda clumpy so I added milk until it was smooth and creamy. Then added the meat back in and simmered for 30 minutes to blend the flavors. It was wonderful. I am thinking to make this with chicken breast too. Thanks for the recipe. It is always fun to add your own ideas and be creative with someone elses recipe.

This recipe is good with fettucine or rice. Very easy to make, just mix all the ingredients and bake in the oven. Also, be careful with the dry onion mix as it has a tendency to give this dish a salty flavor.

This was a very good dish and easy. I used Campbell's cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup and also Lipton's onion and mushroom soup mix it added a great flavor. Also I  added 1 small can of mushrooms. Served it over brown rice and had asparagus and biscuits with it. My family enjoyed it. Even my picky 3 year old.

With a few adjustments this turned out Great!! I followed the recipe exact except I added 1 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce, a Tble of dried parsley, a tsp of fresh chopped garlic, and a couple shakes of crushed pepper. And a can of corn (my husbands suggestions). I put all of that into the Crock Pot, and served over Garlic Mash Potatoes.

My husbands fave meal is beef tips in gravy, but he hates mushrooms. I ran the soup through the blender and used beefy onion soup mix. He LOVED it. It was an easy meal and he has no idea it had mushrooms! Thanks for a quick meal that everone loved!

I wasn't sure about this but I threw it into the slow cooker and it worked out really well, nice and tender.  
I thought the sesame oil would over power everything else but it didn't it worked great together.  This is a new staple in my house.

sorry, nope not a winner. Too salty. I made in the slow cooker. It tasted like a salty Beef Stew. Never again would I make this. I give it credit, the one star, for easy.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly. This is not a great meal that I would serve to dinner guests but it is good enough for your everyday meal. You know, when you come home from work and really don't feel like cooking but want something different. I served this over linguine which I think was a mistake. I think this would have been better over yellow rice or with mashed potatoes. Also I think a litte wine would be a good addition or even some chicken broth to thin the sauce out a little bit. Oh, for those who said the meat was tough. Some of my meat chunks were tough also. I think we probably need to use a better cut of beef or just need to cook longer or cut into smaller chunks.

Everything cooked just fine.  Followed recipe as posted.  This just wasn't very good.  The sesame oil was quite strong.  The meal was salty and just not anything I'd make again.  Don't even know what to suggest to make it better.

Not really a huge fan, sorry to say. Kinda bland. I'll spruce them up a bit before dinner but wanted to leave my review before tinkering.

This was delicious!!  I made it in the crockpot, it took about 5 hours on high. I sauteed the beef before I added it to the pot.  I made 2 additions, fresh broccoli about 15 minutes before I served it and I didn't find the final color very attractive so I added some Kitchen Bouquet gravy darkener and served it over rice.  I used the mushroom and onion soup mix and I think a can of mushrooms would be great in addition to the soup, I like them alot!!  My mother made a similar dish we called Beef and Bacon over rice (I'll try to post it here). There weren't any leftovers, I might have to double it next time!!! I will make it again.

This was a very tasty meal!  I used sirloin steak and dredged it in seasoned flour and then pan seared the meat with garlic and onion.  I added the canned soup and dry soup and also a can of mushrooms with the juice.  I simmered on top of the stove for about 2 hours.  Oh my gosh was this flavorful, I served it on brown rice.  Had leftovers and will serve that over pasta!  thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like the sesame oil flavor with this recipe, however it was okay and easy to make without much fuss.  Will probably make again and not add the sesame oil or the whole packet of onion soup mix.  I think that made it a bit salty.

Very yummy! The only things I did differently -I cut the meat into smaller pieces and added twice the onions since we love them.  I also sprinkled sesame seeds (just because I had them) over the top before baking. I served with mashed potatoes and we all loved it.

My super picky son went back for seconds!  I cooked it in the crock pot after sprinkling some of the soup mix on the meat & browning it, first.  The meat was very tender that way.  I don't know why people are saying that they wouldn't serve it to guests.  It was great!

My family really liked it. I've tried a few things since I'm out of work and for now a "Mr. Mom". So far, this is one the kids and wife said they would like to have again... Just more of it, though.. I don't think I could server six with this. Barely made four.

Absolutely delicious! The only things I added were 8 ounces sliced mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of chopped garlic. Threw it all in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Served over mashed potatoes....Excellent!

This was wonderful! I served it over rice and my husband ate two servings. The thing that makes that so great is that he hates rice!

I baked this for one hour covered, but the meat was still raw in places.  I ended up cooking it uncovered for another hour.  My family couldn't wait that long to eat, so I had to scramble to make something else for dinner.  I reheated this the following day -  covered for half an hour.  The flavor was good, but the meat was tough.  The next time I make this, I'll cook it in the crock pot.  ***  I just found out that my oven is 50 degrees off, which accounts for the long cooking time.  ***

It was great!!! I added some garlic herb seasoning and golden mushroom soup. It took over an hours to cook but once done it was melt in your mouth tender.

Great as written, though if you use golden mushroom soup it is even better. It's like a recipe I've used for years with all that venison the "boys" bring home. You can even slice/cube  potatoes and carrots, layer them in a casserole, cover with the meat and then soup mixture. Cover then casserole tightly (or do the whole thing as a packet in heavy duty foil ) and bake for 1-2 hours. My aunt always called this "forgotten stew".

I cooked this for my BF who's the typical "steak and potatoes guy." I served it with mashed potatoes and veggies and he loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe shows. Meat was tender and savory. There wasn't a whole lot of sauce/gravy so next time I will double the soups. Very easy and yummy! Will def make again.

I used at least 3-4 lbs. of steak, can't remember what cut, cut into small cubes, a large onion, one green pepper, several cloves of garlic and at least a lb. of fresh sliced mushrooms. After reading some of the other reviews, I added a little worcestershire sauce too. I had the time so I made this on top of the stove in my cast iron french oven...just let it go for a couple of hours. It came out very tender and the time gave all the flavors a chance to meld. Everyone approved and all the leftovers were consumed within 24 hours! I will be making this again. Thanks!

Very Good!!  I added a packet of sliced button mushrooms and 1/4 cup of water (seemed a little thick), and my family loved it.  Did find it slightly salty, I will try it using low-sodium mushroom soup next time.  I baked 2 hours at 350 degrees, beef was not tough at all.

I make this recipe for my family all the time. It is a huge hit, which is a very big deal since we have 5 kids and us. Even my little ones (ages 2, 4 & 5) love it. It is very easy and pretty quick, both a major plus in our home.

We had this the other night with crispy potato wedges and veggies, and EVERYONE enjoyed.  For all three of my kids to devour it with no complaints is a pretty big deal.  Simple, and good.

Made this tonight in the crockpot and OMG it was fantastic!  So easy to put together in the morning and the smell of it slow cooking was out of this world!  The meat was fork tender and so flavorful!  I added some frozen mixed veggies and broccoli to the pot in the last hour and served over rice...deeeeelish!

This is good if you are just looking for something different.  Recommend to cook is a slow cooker.  It will make the beef more tender.

This was very well received, even my 3 year old loved it!  We served it over fetticine noodles, and the only changes I made were to add a little bit of milk and not use a whole package of the onion soup mix, to try and cut down on the sodium.  I reduced the amount of onion as well, since I'm not a huge fan of onion, but didn't want to cut it out entirely.

I thought this was extremly simple to make and tasted really great...I did kinda tweak it a bit though. I made this in the crock pot and it made it so quick and easy...I also used mushrooms as some of the other users. I chopped a bit of fresh garlic in it, and used about 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of white dry wine to kinda loosen it up a bit...it was totally a hit.

I thought it was too salty.  I served it over mashed potatos and some of us had it over white rice.  Needs something to mellow out the salt.  I'll experiment with it.
