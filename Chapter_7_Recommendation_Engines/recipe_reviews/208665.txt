This was okay but it was very bland. Even the salsa didn't give it much life. Just toast and boiled egg basically and I only ate half. Sorry, I wasn't impressed enough to make this again and I love avocados. This was a waste of a good one as far as I am concerned.

YUM!!!!! This was wonderful.  If I may make a suggestion, the salsa MUST be fresh.  If you can find it there is a great brand Herdes that makes AMAZING salsa, they use all natural ingredients and no preservatives, the salsa actually tastes like homemade Mexican salsa.  This was yummy.

Yum! It only took me 5 minutes to make this! I added a little cheese to the egg, and some basil and black pepper. Then on the avocado I added some garlic salt (very little). I used whole-wheat bread. This is quick & easy!

This was outstanding! I was worried because I love my eggs benny with hollandaise, but I am so glad I gave this a try. I put some cheddar on top of my english muffin before adding the egg. WOW! Thanks so much!
