Quick, easy and soooo good.  I'm making my 2nd batch today but going to omit the parmesan, just roll dough in butter, rise and bake.  I'm sure these would also be very good rolled in cinnamon/sugar. Made these to serve with home made hamburger veg. soup and it was the perfect comfort food meal.

So so so good!  And so simple too, which I love.  My husband said "you can make these any time you want."  I used fresh grated Parmesan and little frozen rolls in place of a whole frozen loaf.  I put two rolls per muffin slot, then let them rise about 4-5 hours and bake.

Delicious and so simple! I added some garlic powder, parsley and paprika to the parmesan cheese, but that was my only change. A BIG hit at dinner tonight and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Super simple 3-ingredient recipe!  It starts with thawed frozen bread dough, and I happened to have a loaf of that on hand.  My hubby is a total ‘bread man’ – it doesn’t matter what type of bread, he just enjoys bread with his dinner.  Well, this recipe did not disappoint!  In fact, he ate 6 of them with his ‘Pork, Pear and Walnut Salad’ another recipe from AR.  They baked up nice, light and fluffy.  The butter and cheese added nice flavor to the rolls.  As with most rolls, these were best warm from the oven.  But, it didn’t stop my husband from finishing the cold ones the next day.  Easy recipe that will be repeated.

I followed recipe as directed.  These rolls are so good and yet easy to make.  I omit cheese for those who are allergic or lactose intolerant; just dip in only the butter.  There are none left at any dinner!

I really have to disagree about this not being a recipe. I would never have thought to do this to my rolls! My whole family loved them, and I will be making them regularly.
