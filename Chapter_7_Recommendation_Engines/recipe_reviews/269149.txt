Love it. I used orange juice and honey bell marmalade.  It is quite tart but thatâ€™s what I love about it.

This recipe is easy and delicious!!  It went perfectly with my thanksgiving dinner and tasted fabulous on the turkey sandwiched the following days. It is more tart than sweet, which I loved.   Mine came out more like a jam once it was cooled.  A keeper for sure!

Fantastic! I just made it to take to my dad's for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I made it as written except I had a 2-lb bag of cranberries, so I adjusted all ingredient amounts to 2.5x what is stated and used the whole bag (I have the 6-qt Instant Pot).

Making it in the Instant Pot was easy--I didn't have to babysit it. I've never made CB sauce with orange marmalade; I never thought of it before. It's sure easier than grating orange peel! I of course had to sample some while it was still warm. It's tangy and not overly sweet. I suppose those who prefer it sweeter could add more brown sugar, but I prefer mine on the tangy side.

Thank you for sharing your recipe!
