I have never made tahini sauce in the food processor before; this was so easy! I was really pleased with this recipe, it tasted great.

Keep this dressing handy! I used a liquid yogurt in order to use it as a salad dressing. Itâ€™s simple to throw together and can be used for so many things. I might add a bit less tahini next time but this was because my yogurt was light tasting. This would go very well with sweet potato fries. Thank you for the recipe.
