I made these for Easter. Very big hit, although I used about 2 lbs. of green beans and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar-no white sugar. I think that was a good move as I think it would have been way too sweet otherwise.

YUM!!
I used chopped almonds instead.  I also added some finely diced shallots and balsamic vinegar.  This is an excellent side dish!!

I made a few changes to this recipe, as I didn't have walnuts and I don't eat dairy (butter): I cooked the green beans in olive oil instead of butter.  I had to pour off some of the water as it was too much.  I didn't use the white sugar based on some reviews that said it was too sweet.  When the beans were done with the brown sugar and salt, I found it a little bland for my taste (could have been the missing butter), so I threw in a little more salt and about a tablespoon of garlic, and sauteed it all for a couple more minutes.  Then they were amazing!  I will definitely be making it again with my revisions.

Definitely too sweet.  If I make it again, I would reduce the sugar by half.

Anything to try and get a kid to eat his veggies!  The sugar was an interesting touch to the green beans, but this tasted really good!  I ALMOST got them all down the 8 year old!  Thanks for sharing.

I thought it was very very sweet. I even added alot of soy sauce because I tasted it before it was done. It needed alot more then what it was besides a sugared greenbean. You could hardly taste the walnut. When I seved it to my guest. I told them I was trying something new. I got mixed ratings. Three said they have had better and two said it was good. I think it just depends if you like sweet things.

These beans were pretty good. I prefer saltier, more savory green bean recipes but these were a nice change of pace. My boyfriend said the walnuts really made the dish and I agree! Don't skip them!

Just tried it tonight, and was a bit skeptical due to myself being a non-vegetable eater.  I can truthfully say that after over 35 years of not eating green beans I found a green bean dish that I like.  The crunch of the walnuts was the perfect touch!

This was really good.  It was very easy to make.  I substituted sliced almonds because that's what I had and that was good as well.  I did notice that the water seemed to be a little excessive, but I managed my way around it.  My husband was really impressed with this dish.  Thanks!

Family favorite now; took the place of green bean casserole for Christmas even!
I only used the brown sugar.  Doubled the green beans. Walnuts are best, but I have used pecans since we have many frozen.  Less water/or drain off most before adding brown sugar.  
Thank you jayceeboyer!

This is great- I have a sweet tooth and my boyfriend likes salty, meaty entrees, so this is my go-to side dish when I'm making an entree for his taste. Doesn't keep that well though.

This recipe has been a Thanksgiving staple for our family for the past few years.  I make 2lbs. of green beans, a little bit more walnuts and keep everything else the same.  It's a huge hit, everyone loves it!

These are good but the water never cooked off so they were kind of runny.  Other than that, they were very good.
