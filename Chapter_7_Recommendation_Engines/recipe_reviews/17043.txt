I read all of the reviews first and went with using one 16oz package of beans.  I boiled for a while and probably went over 10 mins and let them sit a little over an hour.  I just took my time about it. I started the crockpot at 12:30 on High and the beans were perfect by 4:30.  Right amount of sauce too and never added more water.  I still stayed casual and finished the recipe with the final steps and ingreds and went another hour on low for fear I've over cook them.  These are professonal, afordable, and gormet-looking and tasting!  This recipe is what your teen boys will brag to their future wives about!  No can will ever compare.  These are a wow!  I will memorize this one!

I love this recipe!  I soak the beans over night in 48 oz of water for at least 12 hours.  I do not do the boiling technique at all.  It turns out excellent.  I think we all need to remember that our crock pots are different heat and different ages.  So cook until yours are done.  I had some leftover ham last time and did not use the ham hocks just added the ham chuncked at the beginning.  I do use Heinz Cocktail Sauce instead of plain Ketchup and a nice deli brown mustard.  Gives it great flavor.  I have made these three times now and Love them!  I even use low calorie maple syrup because that is what I have in the house.

This is a 5 star with the caveat that a slow cooker is for cooking food slowly!  I started this recipe in the early evening by boiling the rinsed beans on the stove then transfered them (with original water) into the crockpot.  My father has always insisted you never throw away the water you cook your beans in.

I used bacon instead of hamhocks and I added 4 garlic cloves.  I think my quantity of beans was close to 4 or 5 cups, all said, my 1 gallon crockpot was full to the lid. 

I cooked them on high until I went to bed.  I had to watch my water level in the first few hours and did fine just adding more as needed.  I cannot imagine this recipe working with the prescribed amount!

The beans were ready the following evening.  They totally hit the spot for us particularly since we cannot get canned baked beans here.  I had been craving Bush's baked beans for weeks and these definitely worked.  Now if only we could find some kielbasa, LOL!

A very easy and tasty recipe. I will boil the beans more next time - or soak them overnight. I found they needed more time in the slow cooker (about 6 hours). I also added more liquid at the end (a combo of all of the liquids already added) to make them 'saucier'. I used molasses instead of maple syrup.

I have made these a couple times. I soak the beans overnight for about 18 hors. I then boil them for 2 hours. I used all the ingrediants listed minus 1 tablespoon of mustard. I put the mustard and ketchup in at the beginning. These are great, and taste good reheated too.

I have only tasted a few Tbsp. of this recipe and I am impressed considering I screwed up at the beginning.  I didn't read the whole recipe and added the ketchup and mustard at the beginning.  Opps, it took over 7 hours for the beans to be fully cooked even though I soaked them overnight.  Make sure you add enough water to the beans if soaking them overnight.  I didn't and the next morning there was almost none.  That might have effected the cooking time the next day.  Leave a couple inches of extra water on top of the beans.
Th two pork hocks I used were big and I was surprised how much meat I was able to get off them.  The meat just fell off.  When the beans were finally cooked I added the same amount of ketchup and mustard again and some water because it was way too thick.  Cooked another 30 mins. and it was done.  Froze all of it for lunches.  So thanks for the recipe.  Grab the Beano and enjoy!!!!  Michele, Cambridge, ontario

This is a very nice tasting recipe, but did require several hours more cooking for nice soft beans.  Next time I will soak the beans overnight as I have with other recipes.  I used ham pieces rather than the ham hocks and that worked well.  I used only 16 oz. of dried beans and the same amount of sauce in the recipe.  AND the beans taste even better the next day. Thank you for the recipe--will make again.

When making any kind of recipe with dried beans, it is best to add the salt at the end, otherwise they won't soften

Best ever from scratch baked beans I've made.  These turned out nice and soft and great flavor and texture.  I did add more brown sugar and maple syrup for a sweeter taste.  Also, added beans with water into the crockpot which may have resulted in soupier beans, but took the lid of off the crockpot for a couple of hours and turned out perfect.

This recipe was absolutely simple and it was delicious!  My husband came home after a hard, cold September day to his home smelling like (his words) "heaven".  Even the picky 3 year old loved this.  Perfect with some cornbread!  Yum!  I'll make this again and again!

Usually in Allrecipes, I can get an idea of how a recipe will turn out based on the reviews, but the reviews for this one were all over the board.  One review might say "I followed directions and it turned out bad" and the next review says "I followed directions and it turned out great."  This concerned me but I went for it anyway.  I didn't know the capabilities of my slow cooker so to be safe, I soaked the beans overnight, then boiled ten minutes in the morning and let them soak for an hour as the directions stated.  By the end of the slow-cook time, they were fully cooked.  I also took the advice of one reviewer and used tomato paste instead of ketchup.  The sweetness was perfect, so I am glad I did not use the ketchup or it would have been too sweet.  The beans are now two days old, and I can no longer taste the mustard but only the maple taste.  If I were to do this again I would double the mustard, because it seems to fade over time.

We love these beans! I make them vegetarian (we don't generally eat pork of any sort), add a touch more water (about 1/2 a cup to a cup) and use honey instead of maple syrup though if I had molasses on hand at the time I'd do a honey-molasses mix. I also use homemade ketchup from this site. I don't soak them overnight but do the quick soak method. One thing about the quick soak method is you need much more water than "just to cover them" as this recipe suggests. Add water to at very least about 3 inches above the beans in the pot. Boil for 10 minutes and then let them sit covered and untouched for at least an hour but more if you've got the time. Another thing is stirring the beans often. Maybe two to three times an hour. This prevents some from overcooking. I use 1lb/16oz of dried beans but I leave the rest of the recipe as is. To be fair this recipe, in our opinion, is much more "mustard-y" than standard baked beans but we like that about them. All in all I give these beans 5 stars with my alterations. I give the recipe here 4 because it suggests too little water both in the quick soak and in the crock pot. HOWEVER the water amounts as written in this recipe may work for you. All crock pots are different.

So these beans have now been cooking for nearly 10 hours and are still not cooked. No - really - TEN hours. I soaked them overnight, boiled them for half an hour this morning and cooked them on high all day. They've been bubbling - cooking - are dark, but are hard and not edible. Pretty frustrating.

For those of you who have hard beans you may need to put 1/8 tsp of baking soda in your water when soaking (this is stated on the back of the navy bean bag for hard water or use bottle water). I was scared after reading many reviews but my beans came out soft in the amount of time stated in the recipe.  I did use the quick method, used the water they boiled and sat in for an hour. I also filled my crock pot up with this water to more than cover the beans while cooking. As others stated used a can of tomato paste during the cooking process, and then at the end used some ketchup and mustard.  Also used cut up pieces of country ham for the meat and a small vadilia onion.  Taking to the lake today, looking forward to hearing great reviews.

I didn't have any ham hocks and couldn't find them at the store, so I just chopped up bacon and added it to the beans.  I also couldn't get maple syrup, so I just used a whole cup of brown sugar and added a bit of maple extract.  I soaked the beans overnight, but still had to cook them longer to get them soft.  We don't live in the States and you can't get baked beans here, so this was a really nice dish to take to the July 4th cookout and remind all the ex-pats of home!  They were so easy, even if I were back in the States, I would make these because they taste so good!

I am not a big bean person, but everyone who ate these loved them!  I didn't know what a ham hock was so instead I picked up a ham bone from my local Honey Baked Ham Store and used that.  It added tons of meat and flavor and I'd definitely do that again.

I cooked these just as the recipe read except for a few minor adjustments in time and amount of liquid. This could be because of difference in slow cookers. Everyone said they were the best they ever tasted. I will be making these a lot. Thanks.

This is a great recipe.  We loved how the beans turned out.  Salt can be added any time during the recipe as studies have shown it has no effect on the toughness of the bean.

These were good but I found I needed to add quite a bit more water than what was called for.  They did taste even better the next day.

Vegetarian version-- Flavor and color were great. They did dry up after being on warm setting during our party. I didn't use hamhocks, but added a dash of liquid smoke and worcestershire. Also replaced 1/2 water with 1/2C vegi stock. Used 20oz of beans. Still thought there should have been a little more liquid. Cooked for about 4.5 hours after soaking beans overnight.

Who needs a doctored CANNED recipe when you can make them better from scratch? I also rated this shy of a 5-star, only due to tweaking. 
     I soaked the beans ahead, then added them in with the rest of the ingredients to the crockpot, using a ham shank and subbing 2 Tbsp. maple with molasses. I cooked them about 8 hours overnight only to find the water had absorbed and the beans had begun to crisp - Aaaah! 
    I quickly added about 2  more cups water since the beans were only a little toasted, then let them cook another 8 hours, adding 3 more cups water about halfway through. The ham cooked right off the bone, making yummy meaty morsels among super-soft beans, now chocolatey brown (maybe from some of the toasting!). They were delicious! I added more ketchup to my bowl because that's the way I like 'em, but I might add a little more ketchup to the pot itself when I make these next time. 
    They also freeze very well - don't be afraid to make the whole recipe if your friends/family like baked beans, they'll love them just as much as mine did both the first and second time!

This is a good recipe but don't do the boiling part of the beans. Just let them soak overnight. And yes, I had to cook them longer. What I did was.......soak them overnight on Friday. Cook them with the ham hocks only on Saturday. Then Sunday morning add all your stuff and let cook until dinner and they will be awesome. The flavor is excellent! Oh yeah, I used dijon mustard instead and it gave it a a little zing!

Got to give these one star.  Although the flavour was good, i spent all day cooking these exactly to the directions and my beans were still hard and inedible.  The directions should be ammended to ensure that the beans are fully cooked before placing them in the slowcooker.

I followed the recipe, but the beans didn't turn out well.  I ended up having to cook them for 7 hours and had to add water to them several times.  Although they had a decent flavor they were very dry and not at all what I had hoped for.

Yummy recipe, but too sweet! Next time I will reduce the maple syrup to 1/4 cup. I used a half pound of bacon, chopped, and it was divine. I soaked the beans overnight, drained and then cooked on low for about 10 hours. The beans were cooked but it would be better to make this when you're home to give it a stir, as some of the beans on top were a bit more al dente.

I thought they turned out great! My 2nd time trying (but first with this recipe) and I was very happy.    I made a few modifications:  - doubled the bean portion - 6 cups  - Kept the sugar and maple syrup measurements the same  - added 3/4 ketchup  - Didn't boil the beans after soaking. Just soaked    Turned out fab!!

Great basic recipe...   as will all recipes, I tend to change them up a bit...    1.  Soaked beans overnite 2.  I could not find a hamhock - so used bacon and sliced it up (did not cook bacon first, just added to slow cooker) 3.  Used Molassas instead of brown sugar and maple syrup (its what I had on hand) 4.  Added a few shakes, about 1 tablespoon, of Cumin 5.  Kept the water, mustard, ketchup, salt, onions, just eyeballed the amounts instead of measuring.  6.  Put directly into the slow cooker by 9 in the morning.   Turned out fantastic!  I still need to try it with a hamhock...

I don't know if I can every eat canned baked beans again after eating these.  This is an easy, healthy recipe that is lovely to make the night before on a winter's night and have something delicious for breakfast the next day.  I had to make some substitutions due to things not being the same in Australia: - I used a 500g package of dried lima beans as this was all there was at the grocer.  Soaked them overnight before cooking and also got rid of the husks as well. - Used a 400g can of crushed tomatoes and 2T of tomato paste instead of the ketchup - Added 2 cubes of bacon stock to the water  Will make again and again!

I overcooked my beans...so that was my fault...they came out way too thick...more like refried beans..lol.  However, I rate it a 4 for flavor...it was the flavor I was looking for.  Next time I'll be more careful with the beans.

These were very good.  Shame on me tho, I soaked the beans overnight thinking that would eliminate the boiling process, but it did take mine longer to soften up.  I will definitely be boiling next time.  The flavorings are spot on but 1 lb. of ham hocks didn't yield much meat.  Maybe next time I will add more or use smoked neck bones. So much better than canned.

This was a great recipe!  I was a little scared after reading some of the reviews that my beans wouldn't be done on time, but they were!  I took them to a party, and everyone loved them!  I will be holding onto this recipe for sure!

I do not know what I am doing wrong but I tried this recipe and followed it. I am still trying to get the beans to soten up after 18 hours in the crock pot. Yes my crock pot is working right beans are bubbling. Now they are at the point of a better taste. No tthe first time I have tried to do backed beans from scratch and have the same problem no mater what method I use.

This is almost the same as the beans my Mom used to make, slow cooked in the oven, except she used molasses.  The recipe used to be on the package of Great Northern white beans but I have not been able to find it anywhere.  I love beans with maple flavoring and will definately give this one a try.

My first try at home cooked baked beans and it was very good.  I used thick cut bacon (6 slices) and the water from simmering the beans.  I added a bit of crushed red pepper but maybe next time a little cayenne for some spice.  A keeper!

This recipe was great. I needed something simple for a dinner party on Father's Day. This did not take any time away from attending other foods. Once prepped and in the cooker I left it alone. I will be using it again.

The texture of these were great but I found these to be too sweet. I followed the directions exactly. Next time I will cut the sugar and maple syrup in half. It is a good base though for tweaking the recipe.

Traditional American-style baked beans are always way too sweet for my Brit palate, so I cut back significantly on the brown sugar and syrup (just a pinch/splash of each). After stirring in the ketchup, it was still a bit too sweet for me so I added a smidge of apple cider vinegar. The sweet/tart vinegar perfectly complemented the spicy Colman's English mustard I used. The smokey ham hock flavor took it to another level. Thanks!

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe but I could never get my beans to soften.  I took into account everything that was suggested here and thought I'd have no problems.  I soaked them overnight, I boiled them like mentioned here and I slow cooked them for ages.  My beans would never really soften.  I even took them from the slow cooker and then cooked them on the stove to try and get them softer before adding them back to the slow cooker.  It was a real shame because I made this for my English in laws who had never had American style baked beans before.  Not sure I will try this again.

35 hours + 8 mins, start to finish...at 7220 feet elev. and the beans are still hit and miss with respect to being "done".  Taking the advice of others, I started with more water so that I wouldn't have to add any additional.  I soaked and cooked the beans off and on for the first 24 hours, then cooked another half day... There was still so much water, I finally added 6 cans of plain beans (pinto, great northern and navy).  I doctored these up so much with alterations on the seasonings (using more catsup, adding Worcetershire, more brown sugar, molasses instead of maple...) there is no comparison to the original recipe.  This one experience was enough to never wish to cook beans from scratch again.  Had my pressure cooker not been broken, I would have used that trusty cooking method instead...

Great recipe!  Just needed a little more spices for our tastes - I added some worstechire sauce, browning seasoning, seasoned salt, cajun seasoning, and chili blend seasoning, along with about 1/2 c more ketchup.  Turned out wonderful!  We all loved all the meat that came off the ham hocks...  almost like a barbeque pork/baked beans dish!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these today and they turned out really great. I have made homemade baked beans for years so soaked the beans overnight, then boiled for an hour. Slow cooker for 6 hours and they turned out great. I added the ketchup and used dry mustard both at the beginning. I added only the cup of water called for in the recipe and beans were very moist.
The colouring comes from the ketchup so it is best to add early so you get that nice brown colour.

Love this recipe! My picky eaters even love it! I agree with a lot of the other reviewers though, the beans definitely need to be soaked longer. I made the mistake if following the time in the recipe and it failed the first time I made this. So now I soak them in the crockpot on the warm setting overnight then I don't need to boil them. Other than the time this recipe is perfect and I will be using it for years to come! We always used to buy Busch's Baked beans in the can and we will never do it again. I always make a double batch and freeze or can the extras.

This recipe took me 3 tries before I got it right. You have to soak the beans overnight for 12 hours minimum. THEN you rinse the beans and boil them for an hour.  While they are in the crock pot, DO NOT open the lid.

The problem I believe is the salt. Salt should never be added to dried beans until they are already cooked to the tender stage.

I knew this before starting, so made the recipe as indicated, but no salt till the end. The result was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Greetings from Johannesburg, South Africa

Beans have to be cooked before adding any sugars.  Once sugar (brown sugar, molasses, syrup) the beans will not get any softer.

I love this recipe! I've used navy beans or great northern. Either will do. Generally I soak my beans for about 6 hours and then boil them for 30 minutes. The trick for me is to triple the rest of the  ingredients. I cook them in my crock pot for 10 hours. Flavor is wonderful and everyone loves them. Nice and soft beans too. This will be my baked bean recipe that I use over and over!

I soaked the beans last night and even so today I cooked them on high in my crock pot for 9 hours. I did reduce the maple syrup to 1/4 cp and reduced the onion by half. Still there was something lacking in flavor so I added 1/2 cp bbq sauce. They are great and I will use the revised recipe again and would definitely recommend this to friends.

These were Great!  I used 16 oz of beans (mostly navy but some pintos since that is what I had) and left out the ham hocks.  Didn't have real maple syrup so I used Hungry Jack pancake syrup.  Also forgot the mustard.  Nevertheless, they were wonderful.  I didn't  need to add any extra water--but I boiled and soaked them for about 8 hours before putting them in the crock pot.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Loved it! We left out the ham hocks and it was still delicious. I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli as a healthy dinner and everyone ate it right up! Very easy to make and cheap! I will definitely be making this again!

Had a snow day today and thought this would be good...I added chunks of leftover ham (about 3/4 cup) and chopped in two slices of bacon.  I accidentally cooked it all with the ketchup mixed in and not added later, as was described and I did not add mustard.  Instead I put in two dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Came out great but I'd like it a bit more liquidy! This stays in my recipe box!

Very good! Thanks for sharing. I did make a few alterations. I made a vegetarian version, omitting the ham hocks. I also added a can of crushed pineapple, used 1/2 molasses and 1/2 maple syrup, a bit of garlic powder, and probably used a bit less ketchup and mustard than called for. I will definitely make this again!

The taste was excellent, but the beans were still hard after the cooking, soaking, and slow roasting.  Need to soak much longer.

Finally, proportions for Mom's Baked Beans. She was one of those that only knew an ingredients list, she'd put it together, let them simmer several hours and then add more of certain ingredients to taste.  Start with drained, canned baked beans to make it easier.

I had to throw this recipe out!  The beans did not soak up any of the flavors.  While cooking, my kitchen didn't even eminate the usually mouth-watering smells.  I was very disappointed, and am now a canned baked bean convert.

I had to cook these a little longer than stated.  It was closer to 6-7 hours.  Time may have been cut down if I had soaked them overnight.  I also needed to add water during the cooking time so that they would not dry out.  I added chopped ham instead of hamhocks and got a great result.  Overall, taste great.

Very nice! I added about a half a cup of extra barbecue sauce, since my family likes them sweet. 
So much better than the standard pork and bean

These beans are fantastic! I have made them several times and there have been no leftovers. I have used the boiling technique and the soaking method. Both work. I have added a dried chili pepper to the beans while cooking. It gives the beans a little bit of heat.  My daughter who is nine requests these beans.  I do use a hammock, and bacon.

used the quick boil method, omitted bacon, used a little pulled pork and liquid smoked, reduced brown sugar and added grilled hot dogs the last 10 minutes.  Excellent potluck meal.

Amazing recipe, the only problem was it took over 10 hours in crock pot, even though I soaked the beans overnight.Next time, I will soak for 2 days,and boil for a few hours. I also did exactly what the recipe called for, except I added the mustard and ketchup with all the ingredients.

This is delicious, but I only rated it 4 stars because the beans wouldn't have been even close to done if I had just followed the directions.  I soaked overnight (about 10 hours) and then proceeded with the recipe as written.  Cooking time was accurate after soaking overnight.  

I'm not sure of the quantity of beans I used...I had about half of a 2 lb bag.  I followed all the quantities of ingredients stated in the recipe but added more water to my crock pot--enough to just cover all the beans.  I also did not use ham hocks but instead used about 3/4 cup of chopped ham that I had left over from another meal.  Turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again!

Not a bad recipe to play with. I followed other reviewers suggestions and had to increase the amount of liquid as 1 cup was not enough. I think I wound up adding another 1 or 1 1/2 cups of water before the cooking was complete. I did not have enough maple syrup on hand, so I used 1/4c maple, 1/3c honey, and almost 1/2c of homemade BBQ sauce that I had on hand. I also added about 1/3c molasses based on another reviewer's post.

Lastly, we like our beans vegetarian so did not add any meat (ham hocks, etc). These turned out pretty good! Thank you!

I switched molasses for the maple syrup because I hate the flavor of maple beans. I used 3/4 lb thinly sliced pork chops because I have to watch my fat content. The beans were delicious and I plan on saving this recipe on my favorites !!

Many posters have said the beans didn't cook--mine didn't either. I'm convinced it's because the sugar was added at the wrong stage. Most recipes I've seen have you add the sugar AFTER the beans are already tender. I'm trying to salvage mine right now--I drained off the cooking liquid, added some water, and have been boiling the beans hard for an hour and they do seem to finally be getting soft. Then I'll add back in the stock.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I've been looking for a good homemade baked beans recipe, and I finally found it!!  I have a limited "convenience food" diet because of an allergy to artificial colorings...and EVERY can of baked beans has caramel coloring in it.  I did not use any ham or bacon in the recipe as I wanted them to be MSG-free...so I did salt them to make up for that difference.  I also soaked the beans overnight in water as another reviewer recommended to avoid boiling them, which also made these quicker to make!  And for the maple syrup, I used half blue agave syrup, half real maple syrup that we always buy in northern Michigan.  Mmmmmm!!!  I first made them last Saturday and I've already been asked to make them again this weekend.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good beans.  As others have said, you may have to adjust timing or water as everyone's slow cooker is different. I adjusted the water a lot; I put several inches of water above the beans and then had to add more in while soaking.  I did not drain the beans before putting in the slow cooker.  This did make for rather soupy beans while cooking in the slow cooker, but eliminated the need to add water back in to the cooker while they were cooking away.  I also waited to add the meat (I just used cooked and chopped bacon pieces) until about 4 hours into the cooking process.  I didn't have maple syrup, so I used maple flavoring and honey.  I'm not sure that adding salt up front means beans won't cook or not, but I prefer to add seasonings like that at the end--so hard to adjust down!  So, I waited to add the salt and pepper with the mustard and ketchup at the end.  I had a 2 pound, so 32 ounce, bag of pinto beans (no navy or Great Northern beans at Target) and per hubs this needed another 1/2 cup of brown sugar at the end to bring it to his preferred sweetness, as the only adjustment I made for the increased beans was the water.   I did have to keep the lid off halfway for the last 1 or 2 hours of cooking to bring the liquid down.  All told, we ended up with about 5 meals (there are two of us) of baked beans, so I froze three of them for another time, and it cooked for about 8 hours on high.  Thanks for sharing!

So far, so good. Just shy of 4 hours, I made a combo cup and 3/4 of all the liquids (no more added mustard) and added, it's definitely necessary. The inners of the bean are perfect the shell, is almost there (@ about 5 hours) will pull the plug around 6 hours...? The flavor, is perfect. Little sweet, little savory. 100% organic which feels good. Anyhow, I soaked my beans (24 oz) for 19.5 hours. Boiled as instructed (10 minutes) and let sit an hour as instructed as well. Left out the hamhocks as we're veggies over here....will make this again :)

My girlfriend and I tried this recipe exactly as it was written. We cooked those beans for over 10 hours and they were still not done. I will try again but will soak them overnight first. Hopefully I will be able to give this recipe a better score.

I was VERY apprehensive to try this recipe (or any bean in the slow cooker recipe I found here), but I just checked out the most helpful review (by ZEPHERSNOW) and went from there. Soaking the beans overnight and also boiling them for a bit I think was key in this not being a disaster as some people experienced. My beans didn't look quite as red as they do in the picture but the taste was awesome!

My mom passed away in 1994 and made the best beans ever! This is as close as I have ever been able to come to her recipe! Only difference was I soaked the beans overnight instead of boiling and I increased the water by about 3/4 of a cup.

After years of trying to make baked beans without any success (beans always came out too hard) I came across this recipe and tried once more.  They were the easiest best beans I have ever made or eaten.  I will make this again and again.  I omitted the ham hock just because I don't like meat in my beans. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I had some leftover beans in the freezer & was looking for a way to use them up. I left out the meat and use a vidalia onion. I also added 2 sliced jalepeno peppers at the end with the ketchup. They were awesome, sweet with a little kick.

This is the first time I've been disappointed in a recipe from this website.  Should have used far less onion as it overwhelmed the taste of beans and the recipe did not call for enough liquid.  I added a cup of water halfway through and still the beans were too crisp.  My husband tried to eat it, but we did not.  Now that is something we've rarely done!

These were very good...however, it is a must to soak the beans overnight beforehand.  The quick soak methood just isn't enough, even though I cooked my beans for about 8 hours.

I'm only going to rate this a 4 because of the changes I made after reading the reviews.I cut the recipe in half and let the beans soak in water overnight before boiling them. I also used an extra 1/2 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of molasses in the mixture as it was quite dry. The beans were cooked but not as soft as I would have liked. Next time I will let them soak for 24 hours. The flavour was fantastic though!

Delicious, easy, and easy to tweak. It also stays delicious for days after you make it. I added some molasses and made it in the slow cooker.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  It took a few minutes a couple of times during the morning, and we had delicious baked beans with rice for our lunch.  The can cannot compare!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Good first time. Wife who is of English decent loves'm so do I. A little dry, so I added more water which seemed to do the trick. BTW my store was out of smoked pork butts, so I used smoked pork neck bones, hmm good.

Pretry good. My family liked them too. I am not sure if it was the type of beans (I used navy) or I didn't let them cook or boil long enough, but they were a little el dente (if that applies to beans). They weren't bad, but I'm going to try to add some juice from the pineapple brown sugar honey ham I made and let the beans slow cook for a few more hours to see if that softens them up. Good taste, though.

This is the same recipe that came with the Crock Pot i purchased in the 70's.  Yes, it still works!  However, that recipe booklet recommends cooking at Low for 10 to 12 hours.  It's also important to leave the lid on as much as possible, no peeking!  That could explain why some people are having trouble getting the beans soft enough.

Loved them and the fact that you don't use canned beans. For just the two of us I freeze them in small batches. A squirt of bbq sauce is a nice addition.

I probably should have used the ham hocks....I used chicken broth with no meat and the dish just wasn't that tasty. I probably won't make it again.

First time I make beans in a slow cooker.  They were delicious. I replaced the maple syrup for molasses and doubled the water because they would have been to dry. I will make them again.

Delicious! I only had canned white beans so I basically just added all the ingredients into the pot and let it simmer on med-low for 30 minutes. Out of necessity I used sliced smoked ham instead of ham hocks. I also threw a couple of hot dogs. I'll be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is an excellent variation on baked beans with the maple syrup replacing the standard molasses. You will never need to buy another can of baked beans once you try this recipe. it can also be made changing the syrup to molasses or to a honey molasses or honey syrup mixture. it works well with the ketchup but requires more liquid if you substitute tomato paste as some have suggested. I would recommend sticking with ketchup. To insure your cooking times, it helps to stretch aluminum foil over crock then placing the lid on top. This maintains the temperature & moisture levels a little better. I added more ketchup & syrup/molasses/honey (whatever I used each time I make them) at the beginning of the time in the slow cooker. I have also added BBQ sauce for a variation. They are a complete meal with the ham (also good with browned breakfast sausage added in place of the ham!) When soaking beans over night or doing the "quick soak" method, always add baking soda to the water they are soaked in ,& do not add salt til the end of cooking. I've read this in many older cookbooks & had many elder cooks tell me this. A friend whose culture has a diet based on beans says this is how people in her country always prepare beans. The only caveat, do not use more than 1/2 tsp baking soda to the pound of dry beans or they will taste bitter in the recipe.

I made it with 20 ounces of dry baby lima beans and a leftover ham bone with a fair amount of ham left on it. Boiled the bone in water for about 20 minutes before adding the dry beans, brought back up to boil for 10 minutes, then let it sit for the recommended hour. Pulled the ham bone, removed the meat, drained beans and added all to the crock pot as directed, with the ketchup and mustard for last hour. It worked really well and it tastes great.  The baby limas are nice for this recipe.

I started by soaking the beans over night 12 hours. I added all ingredients at the beginning, but substituted a mild "chicken and rib" BBQ sauce for the ketchup and added 3 cups of water because I was cooking them all day on hi! OMG soooooooo good with homemade drop biscuits. I'm not sure if the bone from a spiral cut ham is a ham hock but that's what I used.

super easy to make and very delicious! don't hesitate to use the ham hock as they can be intimidating to look at. These are even better the next day after having sat in the fridge for a little while! :)

This was the first time trying baked beans and these were so easy and delicious. I did soak the beans over night and uses half maple syrup and half molasses. I also uses chilli sauce instead of ketchup. The beans cooked for about 8 hours and were soft. I will be making these again for sure.

I soaked the beans overnight as some suggested but they were still too hard after cooking.  The flavor was not great either.  They were much too salty.  I will not try these again.  I will search for another recipe and will most certainly not use hamhock.

1st time I Made this in the slowcooker, came out ok. Still a little tough. Second time I made this in the dutch oven while camping  with 3 cans great northern beans drained - came out great, until I added the mustard and ruined it. 3rd time I made it I didn't have any bacon so I used a tsp of bacon grease, left out the mustard at the end and it was perfect !! Only used 16 oz of dry beans though.

Like others have said, the flavor is great!  But the water content is a bit too low and you need to be prepared to watch them throughout the day the first time or two that you make them.  The first time I made them they ended up mushy because they cooked way too long.  So I cut the time down the next time and they were totally burnt around the edges and had to be thrown away (I used only just over the 1 cup of water called for that time - I had forgotten I used quite a bit more the first time, you do need to put enough water to cover the beans by about an inch or you will have to add water during cooking).  Just be prepared to take them off early if need be, or to have a back up for dinner if not done yet.  The third time I made them I added more water again, but used Navy beans (I used Great Northern beans the first two times, not sure if that made any difference or not) and they were still hard at dinnertime so I kept cooking (I still had to add a little water toward the end to keep them cooking and they ended up cooking [with a prior overnight soak] for about 12 hours, but I do have hard water and had forgotten to add baking soda until the last two hours).  I did not use any meat or meat flavoring and they were excellent!

So be ready to play around with them the first few times to determine your cooking time, water level, etc.  Then write it down for the next time so you can improve upon it.  It is worth it as they are great (healthier than canned and cheaper, too!)!

I'm making these now. I used 16oz great northern beans soaked overnight and then boiled for 15_min. I added a Tbl molasses, 1 Tbl minced garlic and a cup of brewed coffee (Emeril's secret ingredient). Can't wait for these to be done. The sauce tastes great!

I use cocktail winners instead of  hocks. Soak beans overnight. (Change water to cut down on gas.) Spray crock with oil. Added beans and enough water to cover with diced onion. Cook on high for about 3 hours. Beans should be soft enough to squish with a spoon on counter but still firm. Added all other ingredients and cook on low until done. I like using cocktail wieners and bacon if available vs hock.

Made this for the 4th of July for a large gathering and it was a huge hit. Following the direction as given, as others have noted, the beans are a little less soft than most people are used to. No one seemed to mind but if you do like softer beans, it will take additional time.

Great recipe, great flavour! A little free advice, though: make sure you boil the beans in a large pot as they will expand and need quite a bit of water.

Unless preparing kidney beans, beans don't have to be boiled. If you don't soak overnight, put unsoaked beans and a carrot in slow cooker in early a.m. on either high or low depending on your pot. When carrot is soft, remove carrot (discard it), drain the beans, and continue with your recipe. I never achieved the right texture of BBQ beans in the past, so thank you, Laura, as the texture of your beans is spot on (as long as each given slow cooker is given long enough to allow the beans to finish cooking). I don't eat pork right now, so I used liquid smoke instead (would like to try smoked tomatoes, but I don't have a regular source for them yet). The liquid smoke helped quite a bit, but the ketchup flavor was too strong which I suspect would be a mute point w/hamhocks in the pot. In the past, I got close to the pork-n-bean flavor with my own 'made the recipe up myself type of recipe,' which includes apple. Now w/instructions from your recipe, I see the timing of the soaking, draining, & adding sauce more clearly. (Again, kudos to you, Laura, for getting that right, which helped get it straight in my mind.) Now, back to the drawing board on the flavorings sans pork. I'll need to dig up the notes on my old attempt at BBQ'd beans with that apple...., then I think I'll have it just almost perfect.  Not long until I get this baby spot on without pork!  Enjoy your hamhocks, while I enjoy my beans without ham - or ketchup.....!
