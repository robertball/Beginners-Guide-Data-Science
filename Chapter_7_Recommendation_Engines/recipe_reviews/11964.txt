Oh yes!  This one tasted great and we just loved all the veggies!  Do be aware, though, that it will take MUCH longer than 20 minutes for the prep time.  I made the sauce one evening and then refrigerated it.  The next evening, I assembled the lasagna and refrigerated that.  The third day I finally baked the lasagna.  I simply didn't have all of that time in one block to do the whole thing.  The homemade sauce was great and fully worth that amount of chopping and cooking time.  I made these changes: 1) just spray a little olive oil on the pan instead of using a whole 2 Tbsp. 2) used 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned. 3) omitted the brown sugar. 4) added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce. 5) used 16 oz of ricotta instead of cottage cheese. 6) DIDN'T BOIL THE LASAGNA NOODLES!  This was definitely a hit!  By the way, if you've never made lasagna using the no-boil method, you really should give it a try.  Such a time saver and then you don't end up with wiggly, slippery, tearing wet noodles to handle.  Just make sure they are layered next to one of the wet ingredients (mine were right on top of the sauce layer) and they are perfect when the baking is done.

I really found all the other reviews of this fantastic recipe really helpful in adapting it to the way we like to eat.  Some advice ...  1)  Triple the amount of garlic.  Come on, let's live a little.  My guests loved that this was so flavorful.  2)  Use fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms.  I steamed the spinach with a little salt and it worked out fabulous  3)  I used a can and a half of crushed tomatoes.  Several of the other reviews advised using only one which is up to you.  4)  I used lowfat ricotta instead of cottage cheese - much better,  Finally, I sprinkled a little olive oil on the top of the lasagne, and I got this wonderful crust.  Thanks to everyone who shared their thoughts.

I have been looking for a good vegetable lazagna recipe for a long time, and this one was great.  The homemade red sauce is a little time consuming but definately worth it.  I added an additional 2T of garlic, 2T of itilian seasoning, and 1T of onion powder to give it more flavor.  I also used low fat cottage cheese and whole wheat noodles to make it even healthier.  In order to prevent it from being runny I only partially cooked the noodles so they absorbed the additional fluid while cooking.  My husband and his friends loved it, they didn't mind that it was meatless.

This is a great recepie if you are not afriad to tailor it to your tastes- I did away with the "Sweet" in the sauce and replaced the sugar with red pepper flakes, and I used yellow squash as well as zucchini in the sauce.  I agree with the other reviewer who has used the sauce recepie again- I had too much sauce left over the last time I made this recipe and so I saved it and used it like a primavera sauce later in the week with all those extra lasagna noodles (only make half a box!!)!  All in all a great healthy alternative to typical lasagna!

This proved to be a very tasty recipe.  However, it only makes 12 servings at best, not anywhere near 24 servings as the recipe states.

I substituted 15 oz of ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I also used fresh spinach leaves instead of frozen, and just placed them on top of the ricotta cheese mixture.  

I served this at a pot-luck last night and it got very good review.  I definitely recommend it.

My first attempt at a meatless lasagna and it was delicious.  I made a few small changes - like others I did not cook the noodles I used pre-cooked no boiling required (the only way to go). I halved the recipe as cooking for two.  I used Fresh mushrooms, added a carrot and chopped all vege's very finely using the chopping attachment of my blender. The sauce came out looking like meat sauce as the veges were cut up fine, and cooked quicker.  DH raved about it and we are looking forward to the leftovers.

Made this recipe for a vegetarian friend of mine right after she had a baby.  Her family loved it and asked for the recipe.  I made it in two 8x8 pans and then froze them.  Once frozen, I put them in foodsaver bags so they could store them and eat them when they were ready.  She said the one she ate the night she came home was delicious, and two weeks later, the second was just as good.  Thanks!

Excellent!  I was looking for a healthier alternative to my 1000+ calorie original lasagna recipe, and this one was no disappointment.  I was afraid that the spinach or zuchini might over power the dish, but the flavors blended together nicely.  The only change I made is that I didn't have enough tomatoes (or enough room in my pan) for the 2- 28 oz cans, so I ended up using 1- 28 oz can and 1- 14 oz.  It wasn't dry at all.  That and I saved some mozzarella to top it off and covered it with foil while baking.  My kids were a little hesitant because they could see the spinach (I told them it was parsley ;), but they ended up finishing it without complaints.  It has 8 WW points, if you're counting.  Delish!

Very tasty recipe.  I used at least double the garlic and substituted green pepper for the zucchini as that is what I had on hand.  You may want to drain some of the juice off one of the cans of tomatoes.  I did and it still boiled over my pan.

I made this recipe once a few years ago and absolutely loved it. I thought I had lost the recipe but found it today folded in an old cookbook so I immediately logged on to add it to my favorites so it never can get lost again, and to leave a much derserved 5 star rating! I recall making a few substitutions as suggested by others: I doubled everything except for the sauce, used zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, spinach, onion and mushrooms as the veggies and doubled the mozzarella (hey, I LOVE CHEESE!) and ricotta and added some red pepper flakes for some heat. I substituted the oregano with dried italian seasoning and I also did not bother pre-boiling the noodles - there is no reason! There is plenty of moisture with this amount of sauce to cook the noodles.  For those of you that have wondered - it freezes well. I had plenty left over and cut into individual servings, wrapped in foil and froze with excellent results.  I am so happy I found this recipe again! Fantastic recipe - even for meat lovers!

Love the idea of making your own sauce, you can make it as healthy as you want. Used all fresh ingredients rather than canned/frozen and whole wheat pasta noodles. Omitted any salt or sugar. Also used 2 bulbs of garlic rather than 2 tsp. Delicious. Added some ground turkey to my sauce, which I know defeats the veggie purpose.

As a true meat-lover, I have to say this was wonderful.  I made this for a vegetarian friend of mine and we both loved it!  This recipe makes a great sauce, and I also used fresh spinach instead of the frozen, and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Yummy!

Made w/ changes. I would keep those changes and incorporate a few more when making this again. Used 8 oz. box oven ready lasagna rather than 16 oz. reg. ones. There were 12 lasagna pieces in a box, and 3 pieces for each layer fit perfectly in a 9" x 13" dish, leaving 3 unused. Used fresh mushrooms vs. canned when making the sauce, and added red pepper flakes. The 4 lbs. canned tomato products included in the sauce overshadow the other vegetables in this dish. Fortunately, the sauce was quite tasty. Next time, I’ll cut the tomatoes back to about 35 oz. to bring more balance so other veggies have a chance to shine through. For the cheese/spinach mixture, subbed ricotta for cottage cheese and 10 oz. tub fresh baby spinach for the frozen spinach. Steamed the spinach for a couple minutes to make it more pliable. Next time, I’ll at least double the spinach. With a Misto, lightly sprayed olive oil on last layer of cheese mixture before placing in oven. This lasagna is flavorful and healthy, and a great starting point to customize a version best suited to the preferences of each cook. With changes, this recipe is 5*. See notes.

YUM! This is one of the very few recipes I found that used veggies in a lasagna along with a red sauce. Most used a white sauce. I made the Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this site the day prior. I added to it more oregano and garlic. I too used fresh mushrooms which I diced same as the zucchini. If you haven't made lasagna without pre-boiling the pasta, DO IT. I used my regular ole lasagna noodles and it cooked up beautifully. I followed the recipe besides the aforementioned changes. I do tend to stick to freshly grated cheeses which I did with this recipe and of course freshly minced garlic. I'm not a "no meat in my meal" kinda girl, but as another review mentioned, it was not missed at all!

This was delicious. I made it for my vegetarian boyfriend and we were both thrilled with the result. I also used fresh (wilted) spinach, fresh mushrooms and added fresh basil instead of dried. I used full fat cottage cheese and I cheated a bit by using seasoned chunked tomatoes rather than just the plain crushed.  Great recipe!

I'm sorry I don't like to give negative reviews, but I didn't care for this recipe. The spinach filling was too sparse, and the tomato sauce was overpowering. Maybe cooking it longer than 15 minutes and increasing the spinach filling would have helped. Also the veggies in the sauce almost disappeared. I might make it again with these changes. Thanks anyway.

So good! I brought this to a work potluck, and everyone asked for the recipe. Most people didn't even notice it was vegetarian. 

I added some extra black pepper and chili flakes to the sauce to an extra kick. Will be making this again next week!

Ok, to be honest, I didn't eat this but I made it for my husband and he loved it! I also used precooked noodles, and fresh spinach (just added it to the cottage cheese) and fresh mushrooms. Also added 1 lb ground beef. A bit puttery but hubby loves it and it made a huuuuge pan, so he's happy for a while.

Yummy! A great way to get your veggies and also a vegetarian dish that even meat eaters will enjoy. I made this with corn lasagna sheets which luckily didn't effect the consistancy. Not a "classic" lasagna...better!

I made this recipe just as it is written with no substitutions and it was wonderful! Next time I will use more spinach and cheese mixture just because my husband and I love spinach. There was quite a bit of sauce leftover but I think it is great to top off left overs. It did take me longer than 20 minutes to prepare but totally worth it!

This veggie lasagna is GREAT!  I never really liked cottage cheese in lasagna, probably because it melts chunky.  Blending in in the food processor with herbs is a great idea!  The cheesy layer tasted like it was an expensive bocconcini or mascarpone cheese.  What a great inexpensive way to add that to lasagna.  I'll definitely make again!

I agree with the prep. time not being accurate in this reporting, but it was not overly extensive either for the fantastic flavourful outcome.  I have made vegetarian lasagnas before, & this one - by far - exceeds any expectations you would have.  It is very hearty... I used fresh mushrooms & added carrots as well to the sauce.  In addition, I will be doubling the spinach mixture the next time (be sure to have a deeper pan if this is the case).  In addition, I used the ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.  Very flavourful, tasty, hearty, and healthy (I also used multigrain lasagna noodles instead of white or wholewheat).

This recipe was unreal!  It was exactly what we needed for a solid veggie lasagna recipe.  The only things I did differently were not cook the noodles (I never do.  It's not necessary even if you don't buy the 'no-cook' type) and I used an entire package of Kraft Italiano cheese, and mixed in the parmaesan into that.  The package was a little less than it called for but it still tasted terrific!  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm ... yummy! I followed the tips of several other reviewers and used fresh mushrooms and spinach, 3 cloves of garlic, only one 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes, and ricotta cheese. I also added 2 carrots, and some leftover broccoli stems. I omitted the brown sugar (the carrots add enough sweetness) and the salt (all that cheese has enough salt, and my crushed tomatoes contained salt too). To simplify the preparation, rather than sautéing the vegetables in olive oil, I chopped the onion, garlic, carrots and broccoli stems finely in the food processer and stirred them into the tomato sauce. The zucchini I sliced very thinly with a cheese slicer and used the slices to layer like the lasagna noodles. Same with the fresh mushrooms. I used uncooked whole wheat lasagna noodles, layering it so the wettest layers (sauce, zucchini) were touching the noodles. I just spread the washed fresh spinach over the ricotta mixture as another layer, rather than chopping it and mixing it in. It needed a little over an hour to bake, because of the raw ingredients, but also because I prepared it at high altitude. The changes I made reduced the calories to 240, fat to 8.1g, sodium to 441.2 mg, and carbs to 25.9g. This is based on 12 servings, for comparison, although I agree with other reviewers that serving this as a main dish to 12 people would make for rather small servings.

I made with all fresh ingredients (except tomatoes), just added the fresh spinach in with the veggies the last five minutes of simmering until wilted. I didn't blend the cheese in a blender, just mixed it in a bowl with some ricotta since I was falling short of 16 oz. of cottage cheese. I like to dash in some nutmeg for extra flavor. 
This is the first time I've ever tried the no-boil lasagna noodles, and they were great...just make sure you have the sauce layer next to them for moisture, saves so much time. 
This turned out so good and fresh tasting and the no-meat wasn't missed by my husband of son at all. I used all low-fat/part skim cheeses to make it extra healthy.

Next time I will use my own sauce recipe and use low fat ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Freezes well.

all i gotta say is DELICIOUS!!  Use the recipe as a base and use veggies to your liking. I used: fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, 1 yellow onion, 1 zucchini, 1 broccoli crown, 1 carrot, and 1 yellow squash. Definitely use fresh when you can. I also used ricotta cheese and Barilla no boil noodles work like a charm. I'm going to try eggplant next time.  The prep time is about 45 minutes...depending on the cook. A great veggie dish everyone will love!

This lasagna was very good.  I think I would cut back the sauce and the cheese 1/4th though.  There was too much for my pan and it was quite heavy.  I added broccoli to it as well with the florets and it gave the feeling of meat.  I wondered how this would do with the no bake noodles.  I might try that the next time.   All in all, I would give this a total thumbs up and would be awesome for a big crowd.  I think this would feed more than 12 at a potluck!

Having made this recipe several times, I recommend only three modifications to take the lasagna from great to super fantastic.  First, do not boil the lasagna. There is more than enough liquid to cook the pasta as the dish bakes. If you boil the lasagna first, it ends up kind of mealy and mushy.  Second, add chunky pieces of pan seared portebello mushrooms.  They are really chewy and meaty, and help to make this veggis lasagna satisfying to meat eaters.  Third, if you can find smoked mozzeralla, use some.  Every time I've added it, I've gotten rave reviews specifically on the smoky taste.  I use half smoked mozzerella, and half whole milk mozzerella.

Definitely took longer than 20 minutes prep. Used fresh mushrooms and spinach, also added fresh squash. To make it 100% veggie lasagna, I used sliced sweet potato instead of noodles. The sauce is very versatile - going to use it for a few other dishes. I would use more cheese - cheese is my downfall.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was using fresh spinach instead of frozen, I coarsely chopped 1/2 of a bag and stirred into the cottage cheese mix. My fiance LOVED it! I was torn on going with the white sauce or tomato and I'm glad I went with this one. Not to mention I didn't even miss not having meat in it. I would definitely make it again! :)

This recipe was fantastic!  It was the first time that I had ever tried to make a lasagna, and it was super helpful.
Like other people mentioned, I made several changes that I found worked really well.  In the sauce, I substituted a red pepper for mushrooms, and added more herbs.  Extra oregano, bay leaves, red chili flakes, ground pepper, and even some steak seasoning.  Basically, do what you think will taste good, and it should be fine.  I have lots left over for pasta sauce!
In the filling, I used ricotta cheese and didn't blend the spinach, I just chopped and sautéed it with garlic.
I used the type of noodles that you don't have to pre-boil, and I didn't use the whole pound of cheese.
It tasted amazing!

There is a lot of flavor packed in this recipe.  I used 1/2 pound of fresh, chopped mushrooms instead of the canned, and Italian seasoning blend instead of the oregano.  Those were my only subs, and I will make this again.  Didn't miss the meat at all, with all the cheese!

This is a keeper. I did substitute ricotta for cottage cheese and took others advice and got "oven ready" noodles. We aren't vegetarians but all loved this.

As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the spinach/cheese mixture and used fresh mushrooms in the sauce. I also used fresh spinach (squeeze out the moisture) and ricotta in place of the cottage cheese. It fit nicely in a 10x14 pan. Those were great suggestions. Great recipe. I'll make it again.

Hooray!  This is AWESOME!  And for once, I actually followed the recipe exactly!! (With the exception of not boiling the noodles first...they still turn out perfectly!)  My boyfriend and I both absolutely loved this!  I've been wanting to eat completely veggie 1-2 days per week (healthier and cheaper!), but he's pretty hard to convince...if I can find more recipes like this, we'll have no problem!!  (The cottage cheese provides PLENTY of protein.)  The prep work was a little time consuming, but I'll forgive it because it tastes so great.  I divided this into two 8x8 pans and put one in the freezer for a future dinner...I hope it holds up well!  (I think it should...)  Thanks again for the fab recipe!!  UPDATE:  The re-heated casserole was great immediately out of the oven, but the leftovers did not do quite as well after sitting in the fridge over night.  Still edible, but a little watery.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I made a few small modifications that were all excellent:  I used fresh spinach, I added summer squash to the sauce, and I did not boil the noodles first (they were perfect from the 60 minutes in the oven).  You definitely need to let the lasagna sit for 10 (or maybe 15) minutes before serving or it will be a bit runny.  This is an EXCELLENT recipes!  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe - I only made one change from the recipe, I shredded the zuchinni instead of chopping it, but otherwise exactly as listed.  I think it is the best lasagna I have ever made.  Mine was firm when I served it, not soupy as some have posted.  I always let lasagna set for a half hour or more after it is done just for that reason.  Also, if you double the vegetables as some suggest, it will be more watery.  Great recipe!

Wow, this is an EXCELLENT lasagna recipe.  I tweaked it a little, by adding 1/2 tbsp basil, 2 tbsp grated parmesan and 1/4 cup burgundy wine to the sauce, since that's what I like to add to my homemade marinara sauces, but that's about it.  I made the sauce a day in advance and let the flavors soak and blend in the fridge overnight before making the dish the next day.  I served it to my visiting parents and grandparents, and there were only 2 pieces left!  Even my mom ate it and loved it and she hates zucchini and mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper recipe for me, thanks so much for sharing!!!

As I was making this, my hubby was grumbling about NO Meat.  He ended up really enjoying it.  I did however makes some minor changes.  I used fresh mushrooms,herbs and spinach.  I cooked the spinach first in a wok with butter and 1 garlic clove, to add some more flavour. I then transfered the spinach to a bowl and added ricotta cheese and grated some fresh nutmeg in.  The nutmeg gave the lasagne a wonderful flavour and hubby actually commented that it brought back some memories of a lasagne he had years ago (obviously with meat though). I also used fresh lasagne noodles, as I find these easier to cut to shape of dish.  Oh and I also added 2 other cloves of garlic to the vegies. All in all a great healthy recipe and will definatley make this again, even though the kitchen was a bit of a mess with dishes etc.  Do try to add the nutmeg as it does bring a great flavour to this dish.

My boyfriend and his dad loved this lasagna. They're calling it the best ever. I doubled all the vegetable, including spinach, and substited a pound of fresh mushrooms for the canned. I substituted half the mozzerella with half soy mozzerella and I didn't baked the noodles, just put them in dry.

This recipe has all the perfect ingredients, but it's a good thing I read the reviews before I went ahead with the preparations! Once I figured out the amounts of everything I needed, I ended up with a very delicious meal! I will definitely make this again, including the adaptations I made.

I have been looking for a veg lasanga for a long time.
This not only was delicous, but all my meat loving family and friends loved it as well.  I did customize this a little, I added a lot more garlic, (fresh) and a bit more crushed tomatoes.  And I used ricotta instead of cottage.  But I let the sauce simmer for a good hour.
I could not get over how delish the sauce was!  I have since made it just to pour on pasta for a quick marinara type dinner.  Really good!

We enjoyed this but would recommend some significant changes in the proportions.  There is far too much sauce and too many noodles.  I would suggest 1 can of tomatoes and 6-9 noodles. Other changes I made include adding additional fresh garlic, using tomato sauce instead of crushed tomato for extra flavor, & less basil.  I also used 8 oz of lite cottage cheese and 8 oz of tofu mixed together in place of 1 lb. cottage cheese.  We enjoyed this healthier version of lasagna.  My children didn't even comment on it being different from the meat lasagna I normally make.  The sauce has a wonderful flavor, especially with added fresh garlic. Next time, I'll try whole wheat noodles as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for the recipe !

This was a really good vegetarian lasagna recipe.  I have tried many over the years and this one won the approval of my husband.   I used fresh mushrooms and next time will try it with fresh spinach as well.   I used one 28 oz can of tomatoes which was not enough- but I think 2 would be too much.  I agree with the other reviewed to use 1 1/2 cans for the sauce. I also used the seasoned tomatoes to add more flavor.

WAY too much garlic for this recipe! It's all I could taste! Less garlic (1 tbls, maybe) and maybe some tender carrots or other veggies added in and this would be great.

Superb!  Best lasagna ever!  I mostly followed the recipe, and am happy that it was a bit versatile to use what I had available.  I used extra fresh garlic, diced canned tomatoes and accidentally forgot the tomato paste, shredded carrot in place of brown sugar, lots of fresh finely chopped mushrooms, and an extra large shredded yellow squash in place of zucchini, and did not add salt.  I skipped step with the mixer to save time, so sauce was chunky.  I simplified into 2 layers -- sauce, noodles, sauce, cottage cheese mixture, noodles, cheese, basil.  I really think all the seasonings is what pulled it together.  Everything fit perfectly in my 11 x 14 inch pan.  This is good!  Thank you for recipe!

We LOVE this recipe. I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and add a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce instead of the brown sugar. You can play with the flavors all you want, and it's still a good dish. I disagree with the no-boil comments, though. Boil the noodles first for the right texture. If you don't, the crunchy parts that stick out that everybody loves to fight over get burnt and chewy.

This was fantastic and absolutely a keeper.  Hubby and I are new to the vegetarian diet and are thrilled to have a dish that is so satisfying without tofu (yuck).  I followed the reviews and skipped the brown sugar (I think the tomatoes and tomato paste make it sweet enough), but I did not substitute with red papper flakes.  I also doubled the herbs, and then added some dry spaghetti mix (which eliminates the no-preservative effect) because I like my sauce rich and robust flavored.  I used part-skim ricotta and fresh spinach and kept adding the spinach to the blender of ricotta until it was a little greener than the color of green goddess dressing. I also used fresh mushrooms because of my preference for them.  I shredded the zucchini/squash and doubled that as well.  I had enough marinara sauce left over for a quick night of small spaghetti dish. We ate half for dinner and lunch the next day (double servings w/o any other sides), and then I froze the other half for a future meal.

This was amazing, everyone loved it and went back for extras. Per other reviews I left out brown sugar, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and wilted fresh spinach instead of using frozen. I didn't use a blender to mix the cheese/spinach. I used extra veggies, cheese and seasoning to my taste, but other than that followed the recipe. Will definitely make again!

I really liked this recipe. I used 1/2 part skim ricotta and 1/2 fat free cottage cheese. Also, I only used 8 oz mozzarella to reduce the fat. I used extra zucchini and onions and whole wheat lasagna. I really liked the sauce and would make that again on its own as a healthy pasta sauce.

This lasagna was incredibly good.  I did make some changes based on what I had in the house.  Also, I reduced the mozzarella cheese to half and used low fat.  Instead of cottage cheese I used part skim ricotta.  I did not cook the spinach but let it defrost and drain and it was fine.  Also, I didn't have zucchini but I did have eggplant, which I sliced thin, brushed with olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper and baked on a cookie sheet until soft.  Then I alternated it with the cheese/sauce mixtures.  I am sure the recipe is great as is but it was also great with the changes.  I will definitely make this again.

Made for guests -- Amazing. I followed the recipe very closely except I used no-bake noodles and I used 1 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes and 2 15-oz cans of diced because that is what I had. In addition, I used fresh spinach and steamed it instead of frozen. I baked uncovered, but I put the dish on a cookie sheet so it wouldn't drip into the oven. It was awesome. I might add some chopped carrots next time, too.

I was skeptical at first because I always add some kind of ground beef or sausage to my lasagna, but hubby and I are trying to eat less meat so I figured I'd give this a try...and wow!!  So much flavor you don't miss the meat in it.  I doubled up on the veggies in this recipe & added a small package of munster cheese for some extra "kick" and flavor.  A little work to make this, but worth it!!

Even my non-vegetarian friends loved this. Such a great recipe--the sauce is phenomenal.  I made just a few modifications: 1) Taking the advice of other commenters, I doubled the minced garlic. 2) I used Italian Seasoning, rather than oregano, in the sauce. 3) Since I am not a huge fan of the texture of mushrooms, I minced them as finely as I could.  4) I used ricotta cheese, rather than cottage cheese. 5) I doubled the amount of ricotta/spinach filling. 6) I used almost 1 1/2 times the amount of mozzarella/parmesan as the recipe. 7) I baked it in a full-size lasagna pan, rather than a standard 9x13.

I am known in my family for my "meat" lasagna, but I gotta say...this is AMAZING!  My husband and I decided to try to replace most of our meals with vegetarian versions.  This is a keeper.  We both Loved it!  I did change a couple of things.  First of all, I used fresh mushrooms.  Also  added some chopped yellow squash, and used chopped red onions.   I used italian diced tomato for the extra spices. After the veggies cooked, I drained them so that the sauce wouldn't be runny. Last thing, used oven ready lasagna noodles, which really cut down on prep time!  Texture was perfect.  Again, try this recipe!  We will definately make this again...many times

Very good. I added a chopped yellow squash in with the sauce and a layer of sliced zuccini on top of the sauce. It turned out great. My vegetarian friends and even my meat LOVING husband said it was someof the best they have had.

It is a very hearty lasagna, but needs a little more flavor.  I added two tablespoons of red pepper flakes to the sauce and wish I had added more. Perhaps I needed to season the vegetables more...

THIS ROCKS!! I made two pans, one for a friend with a new baby, and one to keep at home! I made two adjustments for quicker prep time: I used a small bag of frozen chopped onions, and I grated the zucchini. DELISH!!

This was a great recipe. We substituted Prego mushroom sauce and added yellow squash to the veggies and served to my parents for Mother's Day. We will make this again ... this time for us!

I was a little scared by the fact that, blended, the spinach and the cheese made a bright green glop.  I felt like I was making guacamole!  It was very tasty and an interesting way to incorporate the spinach into the recipe.

Yes, it does take a long time but it's well worth it.

Changes: I didn't boil the noodles (no need to) and used only one can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added a number of miscellaneous vegetables and sauteed portabello mushrooms.  Per request of the boyfriend, he made soy sausage patties and we crumbled them in one of the layers.

All in all, this was one of the greatest dinners I've ever made and is still talked about by my roommates.

(We froze half of it... we didn't think it froze well?  Maybe others have had better experiences with it.)

Very good combination for a lasagna.  For having average sized pans, don't expect to use all the sauce mixture.  Grated the zucchini instead of chopping.  Very good recipe and will make again.

This was my FIRST time ever making lasagna and this dish came out awesome!!  Received rave reviews from all and I enjoyed making it.  I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and fresh mushrooms instead of canned...but LOVED it!  Thank you, I see many more of these lasagna's being made in the future!

A good base...

As others suggested, I'd double the veggies.  I also couldn't fit it all in my baking dish, so I'll tweak the sauce/cheese amounts next time.

This was a nice recipe. 

I used prebaked lasagna noodles, and doubled all the vegetables, and it came out great!!

It was a little dry for my taste, however, and next time I will use more sauce. All in all, a hit with everyone in the family, and I will definitely make it again.

Also, I baked for only 40 minutes, and mine was done.

This recipe turned out really good.  Instead of using all cottage cheese, I used 8oz of low fat ricotta and 8oz of fat free cottage cheese (I usually use ricotta and cottage cheese in my full fat meat lasagna recipe).  I also used low fat mozzarella cheese and fat free cheddar cheese.  My family thought the recipe was ok, so next time I may add ground turkey to the sauce.

I was a little weary of the amount of sauce and noodles but the result was an excellent, tasty lasagna!  My meat-loving husband has fallen in love with it....we will definately be having this again real soon!  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

This had a nice taste but I thought it was too saucy.  If I made it again, I'd try it with only one can of crushed tomatoes instead of 2.  I only used a dash of oregano and omitted the brown sugar.  I didn't sprinkle the basil on top either; I only put a little in the spinach cottage cheese mixture.  Also I substituted some fresh chopped baby spinach for the frozen spinach.

Great recipe.  I added 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes and 1 shredded carrot to the sauce.  The mozzarella on top overcooked on mine.  I'm going to cover with aluminium foil next time.

I made this for my dad on fathers' day.  Okay, to be fair, I USED it to make somehing else.  He wanted an eggplant lasanga, but I think he's the only one who ever heard of it.  Finally, I chose his recipe and substituted the noodles with sliced eggplant.  I also used fresh mushrooms. 
It wasn't to flavorful and I found that the recipe makes too much to fit in a 13x9 inch pan.  All and all it was an okay recipe, but anyone who gets frazzled in the kitchen might want to consider making the filling ahead of time, otherwise there's just too much to do at once.  I have used this sauce recipe on several other dishes including spaghetti.  It really beats the salt- packed  sauce in a jar.

Not bad, but way too saucy for my tastes. I loved the inclusion of vegetables and spinach, but the 16 oz of cottage cheese was completely overpowered by the two cans of 28 oz. tomatoes. If I made it again, I'd double the amount of cheese and use only one can of the tomatoes. I added a ton of mozzarella to try to pad it out, but once it was cut it almost turned into soup. Tasty, but I wouldn't make it again this way.

Best! Recipe! Ever! I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars!! This lasagna blew me away. It took so long to prep and only an hour to cook but it was so worth it. I was going to make it all veggie but the only vegetarian in the house didn’t want any so I did have a layer of 1lb of ground beef(73% lean. 27% fat) and 1lb of sweet Italian meat. I mixed that with two eggs, onions, garlic paste, some seasonings, and cooked it until golden. The spinach/cottage cheese mix was to die for!!! I thought that with everything I already had it would stand out but it blended in so well. It balanced the other veggies and meat perfectly. The tomato, zucchini, onion, and mushroom mix was outstanding! The brown sugar complemented each veggie well. I used a fancy parmesan(forgot the brand) and store brand mozzarella on each layer and put ricotta on the top and on the spinach layer. My lasagna layers went like this: olive oil, store bought sauce, pasta, spinach mix, cheese, pasta, meat mixed with the rest of store bought sauce, cheese, pasta, tomato/veggie mix, cheese. It was almost overflowing but everything went well. The prep time felt like hours lol. I used fresh spinach and put half of that and half of the cottage cheese in a nutri-bullet. It liquified it and I added the eggs and the rest of the cottage cheese in. I chopped up the rest of the spinach and added it in. Everyone loved this lasagna and when I have the time to I will definitely make this again!!!

I made some changes to this recipe and it turned out really good.  I used one package (8 oz) of no boil noodles and also used extra cheese and eliminated the mushrooms since a family member is allergic.  I would make it again as my family loved it.

This is a delicious meatless meal. I did omit one of the cans of tomatoes as that was way too much sauce for me. This made a large pan with enough left over for more. I added a few more fresh veggies I had on hand. I probably would have liked a lil more cottage cheese but other than that, this is amazing! Oh and I added in meatless chicken pieces. Yum!

Delicious, but heavy with all of the cheese. As a personal preference I'd prefer a less cheese heavy option, but nevertheless this was a yummy recipe.

I made it for a Sunday dinner. I added artichoke hearts, and red peppers to add heat to the veggie sauté. The sauce I added diced green chillies, as I was worried about not having enough flavor.  I didn't use the tomato paste and oven bake noodles and the result was the noodles absorbed the water sauce and came out great. The recipe is so great and allows you to be flexible with your own veggies.  You couldn't tell the difference between this recipe and a lasagna with meat.. The peppers brought the spiciness I like without using sspicy sausage. Will definitely make again. This is without a doubt the best veggie lasagna recipe i have ever tried.

Thank you so much for sharing this tasty recipe. I had fun making it. I started out with making my own lasagna sheets. It is very good with home made pasta. I also made my tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes. All ingredients were fresh and flavorful. No wonder this lasagna is such a hit. I had fresh herbs from my garden: parsley, oregano and sage. I omitted the sugar. 
It was faaaaannntastic!

This dish turned out great! I used organic veggies and organic ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I only used ricotta cheese because I'm not a fan of cottage cheese. Other than that, it turned out pretty tasty!

Made it with whole-wheat lasagna noodles. I haven't been a huge fan of whole-wheat noodles in the past, but it worked really well in lasagna.  Will definitely make this again.

recipe is great as is. put foil on the bottom oven rack to catch the spill-over, or you can have a big mess to clean in your oven  :-)

omg this was absolutely delicious!  I used fresh veggies (except frozen spinaxh), Lawry's seasoned salt, no basil and a little less onion and oregano than the recipe called for. I also used two pinches of brown sugar rather than one.  My family enjoyed it so much,  everyone went for seconds, my baby boy went for thirds!

Made it as is and the prep was much longer than 20 minutes. Our lasagna, while fine, did turn out rather bland which was disappointing for all the effort that was put into the recipe.

Way too much basil! Used ricotta, extra garlic, and 32 oz of sauce. I think if I don't use as much basil next time would be much better

Very tasty! Even my kids loved it! I did make the sauce as directed, which was easy enough and worth the time. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Overall, I'll definitely make again!

My family loves this. This Lasagna freezes well also so make a full pan. Must use fresh grated whole milk Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan. The second time I made it I omitted the Egg to cut down on Cholesterol and did not miss it. It replaced Pizza

Used fresh spinach and mushrooms as recommended by other reviewers.  Also only used 1 can of crushed tomatoes, white sugar instead of brown and 22 oz of cottage cheese.  Did not top with basil and used less overall due to personal preferences

Delicious! I took the advice of a few reviewers and added crushed red pepper flakes and 3x the recommended amount of garlic to the sauce. I also only used 1.5 cans of the crushed tomatoes and it came out perfectly.

The first lasagna recipe I've made that isn't super watery! I left out the sugar & realized I forgot basil so used some refrigerated pesto & it turned out fantastic. I also added the veggies that needed to be used from my fridge & it only made it tastier!

Delicious recipe!  Only problem is that [for me] the preparation time was over 90 minutes.  That is while also dealing with a family (1 and 5-year-old).  So I do suggest you make this in steps.  Otherwise you might find that you are too tired to stop and savor this lasagna as it should be.

Wow! I will make this again, and again, and again....  Had friends and family, including a vegetarian over for Christmas, and everyone raved about this recipe. I followed previous recommendations and only used one can of tomatoes. I also used fresh spinach. It was amazing!

This one's a keeper! A hit with my daughter's tennis team. I cut the veggies in chunky bits, used diced tomatoes coz I LOVE texture in my food. I want to try the food processor next time.  Used no-boil noodles & ricotta. A very delicious hearty meal.  I will make it again for another big group gathering.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've made this for multiple people, and they always love it! Like other reviewers said, it takes a good bit of time, but I feel it's worth it, and expected. All in all, it's a great recipe to play around with, and a delicious meal that lasts all week!

I did like this recipe a lot, but are my suggestions:  Use fresh mushrooms, double the garlic and cover for the first 30 minutes of cooking.  My top layer was soo dried out that you could not even cut it!

This was deilcious!  We all thoroughly enjoyed it, even my six-year old and four year-old.  The only changes I made were using no-bake lasagna noodles and adding diced carrots (3 of them), since I had no zucchini.  I think I like the combination of colors, and next time I may even add in some yellow peppers also...   Thanks for the recipe!  Big hit!

I rated this a 3 star instead of a 4 because I think jarred sauce would've been just as good or better. Not that hard to make, but there's a similar recipe on this site "Cheryl's Spinach Cheesy Pasta Casserole" that is very close in ingredients, only you just toss a jar of sauce in! Admittedly, both recipes need extra seasoning (to suit anyone's tastes), but I will stick with the Pasta Casserole for ease. Thanks for the decent base recipe though!

The best.  I use a combo of ricotta and cottage cheeses and add the mozzerella cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking.

I've always preferred meat lasagna over veggie lasagna... until now!! This was excellent. The only change I made was I used fresh basil (a must!) and used dry curd cottage cheese (just like ricotta but lower in fat and salt)

I did end up with way more sauce than needed but I just froze it for spaghetti sauce for later.

Thanks for the great recipe!

I took the advice of some other reviewers and made a few changes: 1. No-boil noodles (they cooked perfectly in the liquid of the sauce, just be sure they're  on top of sauce layers).
2. More veggies (I added green pepper and fresh portobello mushrooms coarsely chopped- it added bulk and texture to please the meat-eaters).
3. Half ricotta/half cottage cheese.
4. Fresh spinach instead of frozen.
5. Allow for about twice the recommended prep time, the sauce is delicious but requires a lot of chopping and simmering and a little less than the recommended cooking time. I found it was done to the point of the top cheese layer beginning to burn after 45 minutes. Definitely keep an eye on it.

I served it to a house full of fairly picky omnivores and got lots of compliments, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow myself. Very tasty and well worth the lengthy prep time.

This recipe is SO good! I threw in some extra veggies, and it was great! Don't boil the noodles! They cook themselves perfectly in the oven! Also, be cautious because the cheese burns!

I cut the recipe in half and omitted the mushrooms, other than that followed the recipe exactly.
I only gave it three stars because it was good, but not anything exceptional in my opinion. My husband thought something was missing...and it needed more cheese.
Next time I'd add more veggies and definitely more cheese.

this was very good, it took ALOT longer then the directions indicated, having a helping hand in the kitchen would be good. i useded the no bake noodles worked just fine i made sure i spread sauce to the corner of each piece and all was well. i added more cheese and it was a hit at my party.

I made this for a friends of ours that have 3 girls and everyone cleaned their plate. It does make a lot of sauce. I didn't use all the sauce and would probably use even less because it came out a bit too saucy for my taste. Was excellent as left overs.

This was so tasty!! I added ground chicken and some other things.  It was so tasty that I made it twice in one week and invited the in-laws over the second time. Everyone pigged out so they could hardly leave the table. Mmmmmm, Thank you!!!

This recipe was a great hit. Very tasty and very aromatic while cooking. I left out the brown sugar, and it was not missed. This is a “must try” recipe for anyone who loves great lasagna.

Definitely too much tomatoe sauce but I still made what it called for.  I felt like this recipe was lacking the cheesy quality--I think increasing the cottage cheese might have helped.

YUM.  The only reason it's better the next day is because you can serve it looking more like lasagna than lasagna-soup! This was awesome, made some changes (ricotta instead of cottage cheese, fresh mushrooms & spinach, used the dry lasagna noodles that don't need to be precooked) but the base recipe is great in terms of the amount of veggies.  I was worried that it would be too heavy on the vegetables since I'm used to traditional meaty lasagna, but they weren't overwhelming.  Great recipe!

My husband and I both agreed that this was good, but not as good as my regular vegetable lasagne, which includes sliced roasted eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper, and a gorgonzola cream sauce instead of the spinach and cottage cheese mixture.

This was awesome! Everyone loved it & I will make it again! I had to add a jar of spaghetti sauce (onion & garlic) since I had no onion. I just replaced 1 of the cans of crushed tomatoes with the spaghetti sauce. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I did need to cover with tin foil as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe!!

Reasonably good.  A little more healthy than normal lasagna and so a little less satisfying.

great recipe but time consuming so make the time to make this and we altered the amount of sugar in the sauce and used white instead of brown . but we loved it .will always make again. I cant give you the amount of sugar we added because we didn't measure it and we also added a little white wine to the sauce while cooking. thanks

This lasagna recipe is definitely a keeper!  I made it half veggie/half meat by adding spicy Italian sausage to half of the sauce mixture which gave it a nice kick.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I did have a lot of extra sauce and noodles left over, so I just used that to make individual lasagna rolls and stored in the freezer.  I also used part-skim ricotta cheese, as I like the flavor better.
