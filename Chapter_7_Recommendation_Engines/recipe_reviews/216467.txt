My mother made this, too (I'm 80)! The only difference was that she used the egg-white mixture as a "dollop" on top of each individual custard dish. She called it "Floating Island." Merry Christmas, and thanks for sending it in. Cay from FL

This is my recipe, and I really love it! and if you do it right, it is a fluffy, warm, yummy goodness in the morning, and honestly not too unhealthy either! :) Hope you all enjoy! :)
