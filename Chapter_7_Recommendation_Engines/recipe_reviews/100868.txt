Ok, I have to admit that I showed this recipe to my husband so we could make fun of it.  Little did I know he'd be intrigued!  He made it for lunch today and really enjoyed it.  I tasted it, and it wasn't bad although I did stick with a plain ol' grilled cheese for me.  Only change he made was to use a medium sharp cheddar instead of american cheese.  Thanks for the recipe, and sorry I doubted you!

I liked this recipe. I guess I must have a well developed sweet tooth, because I almost wanted to put more brown sugar on this sandwich! The brown sugar melts into a yummy syrup in between the cheese slices. I'll probably make this again :)

I just had to make this as soon as I read it because it sounded so interesting and it's easy to make.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I accidentally burned it and it still tasted good!

It definitely was different than a regular grilled cheese.  The sweetness was a little strong so I would suggest to others to put less brown sugar than the recipe calls for.  Otherwise I really liked this and will use again.

I had one of these sweet grilled cheeses 35 years ago at a friends house for lunch one day and loved it.
   I still eat them this way once in awhile. Worth trying people!

This was good but I only used half of the brown sugar that the recipe called for, muenster and cheddar cheeses, with medium salsa as a dipping sauce for the sandwich so I'd have sweet and spicy.

This recipe was really (REALLY) sweet. I wouldn't  make it again, but it tasted o.k.

I was intrigued by this recipe.  I thought that I would make it for my son and myself for lunch.  It wasn't bad, at all.  Just very different.  I made one with American cheese and one with cheddar.  I think I liked the chddar better.  My 3 yr old ate the american and said "I don't like sugar in my grilled cheese."  I don't think I'll be making this again.  Sorry.

I discovered many years ago (quite by accident) that cheese and sugar can work well together, but I'd never have thought of making it into a sandwich. It's a good change of pace from the normal stuff, and you can use dark or light brown sugar.

Not bad, I think as a previous poster wrote, I would have liked it with a cheddar cheese and maybe even some apple sliced paper thin on a nice sourdough bread.  It will be something I will experiment with, I think my kids will enjoy it after they get over the shock that mommy is letting them have sugar for lunch.

I just had this sandwich. In a million years I would've never thought to put brown sugar on my grilled cheese. This was really good! It tasted like a grilled cheese but with a nice hint of sweet to it. I measured out the 2 tsp of brown sugar. I thought 1 would be enough, but I really think the 2 are better. Clean up was a breeze, too! Thanks Teresa L!

Enjoying the Sweet Grilled Cheese Sandwich as I type this review and it tastes really good. Tastes lots better than the plain everyday Grilled Cheese.

When I was a kid, my family would always serve sliced cheddar with our pancakes, and the similar sweet-salty combination in this recipe made me run to the kitchen and make it right away. Wow!  I would never have thought these two ingredients would go together, but it was so delicious. I used whole wheat bread and cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Hmmm. What can I say? These were okay, but not fantastic. They tasted fine and I could have gotten by with using only 1 slice of cheese. The brown sugar tended to drip a little as it was runny when hot. Not bad, but not memorable either. I probably won't make it again, but it really tasted just fine, just not my thing. Thanks, it was fun to try something new as I would never have thought of this on my own.

I'm enjoying this sandwich now! My hubby and I have these once a week, and I usually just make mine a plain ol grilled cheese, and his gets ham and sliced jalapenos. I wanted to try something different, so I served these tonight! and let me say...I find them to be sooo good! Just the right amount of sweetness.  Having said that, I did not measure the brown sugar...just eyeballed it.  I served with what I like to call "Poor man's spaghetti": which is cooked noodles (I used whole wheat penne), and pour in ketchup, chili sauce, garlic powder, and black pepper to taste...serve warm.  A quick, easy supper! Thanks alot!

This was so good.  The brown sugar melts and sets off the saltyness of the cheese so well.  Definitely going to try this again and pass it on to my family!

A strange combination to think about however the kids LOVED it! I used colby/jack cheese with multi-grain bread and it really was good! We will be making this again, maybe not ever time we have grilled cheese but whenever we want that extra sweetness.

I thought this sandwich was just ok.  It was a little sweet for my taste (and I've got a sweet tooth), so if I do make it again, I will cut down on the amount of brown sugar.
