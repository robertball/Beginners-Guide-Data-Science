We LOVE this recipe and I will be making this for years to come! We have made it 3 times, and each time we follow the directions exactly. While the steak is grilling I like to caramelize some onions, then we make steak sandwiches with smoked provolone, caramelized onions & chipotle mayo. Put them under the broiler to melt the cheese and dig in! Thanks for this recipe!

This was awesome!  i let it marinade for 48 hours and then threw it on a hot grill.  The steak had wonderful flavor.  As far as the mayo, I think most people would have better luck if they made it to their own preference.  I just took a few spoonfuls of mayo (enough for me, my bf and daughter) and then added about 2 chipotles and some sauce and tasted, and then added until I had the flavor I liked.  My bf LOVED the mayo.  If you just take enough mayo to serve the number of people eating and then add a little of the peppers and sauce at a time, you will be a lot happier.  Too much chipotle can be really hot.  I cannot wait to make this again.

I think that this recipe was AMAZING!  I have made this twice and it is fantastic.  I do make the sauce a little differently though.  I use Sour Cream instead of Mayo.  I also add in Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Fresh Oregano and Fresh Cilantro.  Absolutely fantastic!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!!

This recipe was a HUGE hit!!  My wife is not much for leftovers, but she ate this until she was licking out the Tupperware.  I've since been conscripted to make this for her Bunko night and another time we had the neighbors over for dinner (mind you this is within 2 weeks).  I've found that you can substitued a London Broil if you can't find flank steak and also that there is enough marinade that two pieces of meat can be prepared at one time.  As one reviewer noted, a cup and a half of mayo is quite a bit of mayo, but my family liked it enough that they found other uses for it and it didn't go to waste.   Do remember not to overcook the meat because these cuts will tend to get tough quickly, so if you like well done, this may not be the recipe for your and also cut the meat on a bias and across the grain and you'll have an excellent meal... I've had nothing but rave reviews to date and this recipe is getting a workout.

This was excellent!! I didn't have any honey so I used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I marinated the steak for 36 hours. The dipping sauce was very good and so easy. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I was very skeptical about this recipe.  I thought it sounded like an odd combination of flavors.  I was influenced by the other reviewers, though.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite.  It was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for two things.  I didn't have any fresh rosemary, so I used dry instead.  I can see how this would be so much better with fresh rosemary, but my plants aren't that far along yet.  Also, I didn't have any canned chipotle peppers, so I used some chipotle hot sauce instead.  I just mixed it with the mayo until it had the right bite I was looking for.  So, so good!  My husband loved it too!

Great recipe! No problem with the Steak Marinade, I had all the ingredients for it and only marinated for 1 ½ hours and then broiled it. For the Chipotle Mayo, I didn’t have any chipotle peppers in adobo sauce – NO PROBLEM! I used ½ can green chilies, 1 tablespoon pimentos, a couple shakes of Habanera Pepper sauce plus, ½ capful of liquid smoke, then pureed together in a small food processor and it made a nice pinkish sauce with green specks (2 servings). Used it not only for the steak, I added it to a baked potato and used left-over’s to make sandwiches with. Then made another batch and add EVOO to it to make a nice creamy salad dressing. The steak came out great but my husband said the mayo was better than the steak. I served the steak with a baked potato and green salad with olive oil/vinegar/garlic vinaigrette.

Excellent!  Made for a big family dinner and everyone raved!  Will be making for Christmas dinner because it was so good and so much easier to prepare than turkey.  I only had time to let this marinade for about four hours, and it was still tenderr and flavorful.  The sauce is great, too.  The only change I made was to add a bit more honey - probably about 2 T more.

This was amazing. I used expensive flank steak (it was for a dinner party) and we used butter knives to cut the steak. I said it was the best steak that I have ever had. My fiance loved the chiptole mayo but if you don't make it, you don' t even need it. I would not modify the recipe at all. Truly, could not have asked for a better steak dish!

This marinated is simple and delicious! I let it soak up the goodness for roughly six hours. Popped it onto the BBQ to sear, and then placed it on the top rack to finish cooking. This piece of meat really does continue to cook while it is resting, something to keep in mind.

This recipe is a keeper!  I got a flank steak from the butcher and he scored it for me.  It was only a little over a pound, so I halved the marinade and it was enough.  We were half way through eating when I realized I forgot to make the clipotle mayo, hubby got up and just mixed a little ground chipotle red pepper into mayo and it was great, and really made a difference on the steak.  Can't wait to make it with the real chipotle mayo!

I made this recipe for my husband who loves spicy dishes. He absolutely loved it and that is saying something because he is hard to please! I used top sirloin steak and put it under the broiler for about ten minutes. I also used Cracked Pepper Olive Oil Mayo instead of regular and that added another element of burn to the mayo dip. It was a big hit!

Great flavors.  I marinated overnight but should have pounded the meat with a tenderizer first.  The mayo was very spicy. I'll just use chipotle powder next time.

I used a light soy sauce and omitted the salt.  This is a nice marinade and I am using it for a second time tonight.  The rosemary sure does hit the spot.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe, definitely a keeper.  We marinated the steak about six hours.  I served the sauce on the side so everyone could choose the amount of  sauce they wanted.

Ugh, this is a hard review.  I had two flank steak from Costco so I decided to do one this way and one with Yoshida's Teriyaki marinade from Costco.  My husband said this was very good but the whole family preferred the teriyaki one.  Not a fair comparison but while this one was very good, I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was fantastic! The chipotle mayo was a wonderful complement to the marinade. We will definitely make this again. The only negative is that the recipe made for way too much of the mayo and we have tons leftover.

This was one of the best steaks I've ever had!  I only used 2 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp rosemary, and 2 tsp pepper.  Marinated for a day and it was tender, flavourful, and delicious! I didn't use the chipotle mayo, definitely didn't need it.

I did not make the dipping sauce, so this could be a 6* recipe!!  Iused the marinade for some steaks I had....it was a great blend of spices!!!  I only marinaded them for 40 min...I just forked the steaks to make it easier for the juices to get into the meat.  I will def marinade them like 4 hours next time :) Mmmm

Amazing!  A new favorite that my husband grilled to perfection!  Used a TBSP or two more honey and let it marinade for 48 hrs.  Regarding the Chipotle Mayo -- I only measured out the amt. of mayo I thought we would use, then slowly added in the chipotle peppers (which I had put through the food processor), testing often, as I wanted to control the heat.  Will be making again VERY soon!

The steak was great, both with just the marinade and dipped in the chipotle mayo. For the latter, I was out of a can of chipotle peppers, so I just poured some dried chipotle spice in some mayo. I can't wait to use that on sandwiches for the leftovers. But even by itself, the steak was full of flavor. This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars.

My grillmaster husband thought I was the BOMB when I served this up last night!  He couldn't get enough!  He didn't even use the chipotle mayo...however...I think it will be awesome on some sandwiches later this week!  Needless to say....this will be a keeper!

This was pretty good but I didn't care for the honey. Next time I will cut it in half or leave it out.

This is easy! My family liked it very well. Adjusted the heat of the chipotle mayo to accommodate more timid palates. Thanks!

I slightly altered the marinade (used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce), but really enjoyed the flavor!  My husband hunts, so I used deer steak instead, and couldn't taste any gamey flavor.  Thanks!

The marinade was delicious, didn't even need steak sauce.  I only marinated this steak for a couple of hours and it was enough (it usually isn't).  The mayonnaise sauce was definitely not for my husband and I.  It was very heavy and the pepper flavor was very overpowering.

I only used the marinate actually.  I knew the kids wouldn't like the mayo sauce but the marinate was VERY GOOD.  I will definitely use it again.

The steak was good on it's own but the spicy mayo made it great. The Chipotle mayo is very intense, which I like, but if you don't care for spicy flavors use it sparingly. I marinated my steak for two hours. Then I seared my steak on my grill pan first, then put in the oven set to broil, and then took it out to rest.

Loved it. Followed another reviewer's suggestion to use sour cream in the sauce-- I used half sc and half mayo.  Didn't have rosemary and didn't miss it.  Grilled it inside, and it was still delicious.  Served it with marinated cucumbers and some pumpkin soup.

I only used 2 peppers for a cup of mayo and didn't add extra sauce.  This was good for our taste.  The mayo was really good on oven roasted home fries.

Love it!  We use more garlic and omit the rosemary. Never have any leftovers! Just a tip: it makes a huge difference if you use good, raw honey... Thanks for the recipe... we make this all the time and no one is ever tired of it!  And quests love it, too! I always double it, put everything in plastic ziplocs and let it marinade for a couple of days... it tastes much better that way :)

This we SO good.  I've never had flank steak before and it was really alot better then it looked.  Also, it made alot of chiptle mayo.  The mayo complimented the steak marinade perfectly!

I made this for guests this past weekend and it was a huge hit.  I highly recommend piercing the steak with a tenderizer or sharp knife before placing in the marinade.  It was incredibly flavorful and a recipe I will make for year to come!

Fantastic.  Tastiest flank steak I have made.  And I agree with the other raters - the mayo isn't even necessary.
