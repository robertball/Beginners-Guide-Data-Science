I made a few small changes in this recipe and they came out pretty good. I ran out of butter so I used a 1/2 c of shortening and a 1/2 c butter I added 1/2 t of butter pecan extract along with the vanilla and I somehow didn't have any semisweet chocolate chips in the house (a travesty I know) so I ended up only using milk chocolate white chocolate and dark chocolate chunks in addition to the toasted pecans and toffee bits. There was so much stuff in the batter that I thought an ice cream scoop would suffice to scoop them out and they turned out like big coffee shop cookies. Pretty tasty but nothing way out of this world.

I am amazed that more people have not tried this recipe. I have people placing orders and paying me for these cookies. I did vary the recip though. Instead of using vanilla extract I used Vanilla Butter Nut flavoring by McCormick (much richer taste). I also didn't use bittersweet chunks but used semisweet chunks. I also tend to be pretty heavy handed on the toffee chips. Additionally I used walnuts and pecans. This is a great recipe!!

These are the best cookies ever! I followed some of the other users' alterations and added some of my own for even better results. I substituted the following: 1 tsp. butter nut flavoring and 1 tsp. vanilla (instead of 2 tsp. vanilla) semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chunks add 1/2 c. toasted walnuts use a whole bag of toffee bits and add 1 c. toasted coconut. I also used Scharfenberger and El Rey chocolate for the chunks and Ghiradelli for the chips. Next time I'm going to try adding macadamia nuts!

It is a family favorite of ours for many years!! If you double the recipe you just add a package of each type of chocolate and of the toffee tibbits. I replaced the squares by the Hershey's chunks package. Much quicker than cutting the chocolate into pieces! I do the same for the white chocolate. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 1 month. We just pop them out of the freezer and re-heat in microwave for 6 sec each cookie.:)
