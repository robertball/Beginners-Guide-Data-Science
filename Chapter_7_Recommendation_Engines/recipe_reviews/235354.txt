There is absolutely nothing new, different or unusual about this recipe.  Then somebody please tell me why these were some of the best darned mashed potatoes I've ever had!  I mean all I did was add a little butter!

I try to do as much advance preparation as I can for the time-consuming tradtional Thanksgiving dinner.  This is one that ranks right up there with the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, and it actually instructs you to refrigerate overnight.  Is that convenient or what?  Out of the fridge, into the oven, and you have a mashed potato casserole that will WOW everybody.  Really, although very simple and basic, it is that good!

I made these potatoes during the holidays and got so many compliments on them. One guest made it a point to tell me he didn't even care for mashed potatoes (not sure how), but said these were awesome and had to go back for seconds. Didn't change anything in the recipe - did exactly as directed. Thanks for sharing this!

OMG these are the best mashed potatoes ever. Made them for Christmas dinner, and everyone had seconds. We were afraid we wouldn't have those precious leftovers! Used the exact ingredients, just didn't make them ahead of time since the day before was Christmas Eve. They sat in a crockpot for 4 hours and didn't get dry.

Denise - thanks to you and your husband's aunt for sharing this recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!   A lot of mashed potato recipes are bland or watery, but these had plenty of flavor and body.   These were definitely some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. (Used low fat cream cheese.)

Wow! I wish I could give more than five stars! I brought this on a weekend vacation, doubled the recipe and made it two days before I cooked it. I took it out of the fridge to come to room temperature for a couple hours before baking and then followed the recipes baking instructions. It was fantastic! Seriously best potato dish I’ve ever had! I did not change a thing about the recipe. This is now going to be my go-to.  I love that I can make it ahead and it still tastes amazing!

This was okay, but it didn't have quite as much flavor as I was hoping it would have, despite the fact that I (thankfully) used one whole clove of garlic even though I halved the recipe. However, maybe it having not too strong of a flavor is a good thing so it doesn't clash with the main dish. Also, it was a bit dry, even though I used more melted butter on top than what is called for. My husband, however, really liked it (hence, the four stars). But when I make it again, I think I'll increase the sour cream and/or creamed cheese a bit and maybe also add some shredded cheddar either in the mixture itself or on top. Hopefully that will help boost the flavor a bit.

Interesting I just made a similar recipe for a Christmas party last evening. About 3 dozen and pot luck at daughter’s house. Wanted same mashed potatoes I always make for Thanksgiving. Her huge dining room table looked like a gourmet buffet but what got the most compliments was the mashed potatoes!

Wow just WOW, removing all other mashed potatoes recipes from my file. This is our new potato recipe forever! As another person said there's nothing amazing in these just your basic potatoes type things but they are the best mashed potatoes we have ever had. My husband actually gave a these are really good, great job on the potatoes hun, best we have had. That right there's like finding a unicorn or a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. I think its happened like twice in 24 years. So thank you, really amazing recipe. Not sure how or why but these things are amazing and magical. Back to removing the other mashed potato recipes out of the folder.

Absolutely perfect!!!!! followed everything to a T. except the refrigerating only because I didn't have time. My Fiancé loved these, in fact he didn't want to add any gravy from the salisberry steak we had, he said gravy would ruin it. nor did we need to add any butter or salt. BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER!!

The convience of having the dish preprepared is great but I found it a bit tart tasting because of the sour cream & cream cheese. Still prefer the taste of basic mashed potatoes with milk & butter.

Wonderful recipe to turn ordinary mashed potatoes into something a little more tasty!  The ingredients work well together.  If you’re not a garlic fan...go easy on the garlic.  I didn’t have time to let them set for 8 hours or longer so I put them straight into the oven after mixing the ingredients and they came out perfect.  Thank you for the recipe...I will continue to cook mashed potatoes this way.

Agreed with other reviewers that this seems basic but turns out magically. It was a little heavy on the salt - and just heavy in general. Next time I am going to add salt to taste and cut back on the cream cheese.

I made this according to the recipe and liked it but will cut back on the amount of sour cream I use the next time.  Like another reviewer, it's a bit on the tangy side for me, but with less sour cream, should be just right.  I'll make this again

I don't know what part of the country Uncle Dick was from, but I'm from Iowa and I've had this identical recipe for over 40 years.... just called "make-ahead mashed potatoes".  Everyone does love them!  I make them for any meal when I know at least 1-2 days in advance.  I first tried it for a Thanksgiving meal because it freed up a lot of meal prep time! If I don't have any chives, I just chop up some onion and fold into the potatoes.  I actually like it better that way because the onion flavor mixes with the garlic, etc. overnight.  Best mashed potatoes ever!!!

Wow!!! These are incredibly delicious. I made them for thanksgiving and was tired of the same ole recipe I used (sour cream, milk, butter...and the consistency was always hit or miss). EVERYONE WENT NUTS over these. I sent the recipe to everyone. The only thing I changed was I added a tablespoon of heavy cream and I didn’t have chives. Thank you Uncle Dick!!

I made exactly as described for Thanksgiving, and they were a little too stiff and solid, but tasted delicious. I made them again for a Christmas dinner, but this time cut the cream cheese in half and added 1/2 cup 2% milk. Much better!

It was amazing and everyone loved it! I tweaked it a little and sautéed some shallots in butter and added that to the mixture I mashed. I added a ribbon of paprika, bacon, and chives for all the people who didn’t like those flavors so they could have some too and it was a hit!

I made this according to the recipe, except for the chives, and my family loved it!  Broiled it a bit to brown the top before serving.  My husband thought these were the best mashed potatoes ever!

I didn't like the over powering garlic taste (and I really usually like garlic). My family thought it was too creamy as they like their potatoes not quite to whipped. However the make ahead factor gets a big 5 stars from me. I think I'll leave out the garlic next time!

FANTASTIC! I halved the recipe and still got 6 decent sized servings. I will make this time and time again! This time, I had beef gravy, but if I were missing the gravy, I would consider adding cheddar cheese topping before baking. Also note: you could eat these right away, and not even have to bake them! Based on personal preferences, I added onion powder, garlic salt, parsley and additional paprika to potatoes while mashing.

Made 1/2 recipe with yukon golds, very easy and flavorful (consider adding some green onions inside instead of chives on top?).  The make-ahead aspect made things so much easier.  May consider adding some milk to loosen up just a little more

I made this for a church potluck and it was a hit.  There were no leftovers.  I could taste the sour cream a little too much so next time i’m going to lower the amount i use.  Also the mixture was a little too thick for me personally so i added 1/2 cup of whole milk to loosen it up a bit.  But overall all i liked this recipe and will definitely make this again.

I was in a rush and I only had 1 potato and half a container of ready made mashed potatoes so I boiled the 1 potato until soft (20 min.) and blended the ingredients with my one boiled potato and the half container of ready made mashed potatoes and heated in a pot. Poured into a casserole dish, sprinkled shredded cheese on top and put it under the broiler for 5 min. After taking out of the oven I sprinkled bacon bits on top. It was fast and yummy!

These are indeed some pretty tasty mashed taters. I couldnt help but notice that all the pictures have green onions instead of chives. I made sure to use chives and accidentally doubled them. Good flavor but I think I still prefer the simplicity and taste of milk and butter alone. Worth a try if looking to experiment though!

The potatoes were pretty good.  I think there were too many potatoes to mash and came out lumpy, but that's on me and not the recipe.

Oh my gosh! What a difference it makes by letting these potatoes sit in fridge overnight, then baking. I have a friend who makes these potatoes and serves immediately. These were so much better! I'm sorry for the loss of Uncle Dick, but thankful his wife passed on this recipe. Please people make this as written, these are AWESOME!!!!

I always cook extra potatoes this way and freeze any leftovers for another day. It is not necessary to keep in fridge overnight or even bake them, just add the butter & a little cream as you mix them up.  If you like smaller portions, freeze them in muffin tins for quicker heat-up in microwave. Time saving for the dish that is a must with lots of meals!

I have made mashed potatoes like this for years, they are awesome. You can also make them ahead of time and cover them well after they have cooled and freeze them. They taste just as good as if you just made them.
