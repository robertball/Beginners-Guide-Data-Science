I made this the first time by the recipe exactly.  I missed the sesame flavor without the sesame paste, but liked the reduced fat/calorie idea.  The second time I made it, I decided to use sesame oil instead of olive oil.  This way, the calorie/fat difference was negligible, but the sesame flavor was included--YUMMY!!  I also doubled the garlic and halved the cumin, as others suggested.  I used 1 T lemon juice and added bean juice, as needed, during the blending process.  For those on WW, 1/4 of this recipe is 2 points...put it on cucumber spears or carrot chips and you can't go wrong!  :)

great recipe, if you are looking an alternative to hummus without tahini.  i doubled the garlic, halfed the cumin, added a few shakes of ground red pepper, and some lemon juice.  you really need to add a little lemon, otherwise the recipe just isn't has "bright".  i really enjoyed this one!

This hummus was pretty good, but it was sort of bland. It was a lot better after adding paprika, a few drops of chili oil, and some sesame seeds.

OMG! Who would've thought a little can of garbanzo beans could transform into something so delicous! It doesn't get easier or much simpler than this! I put everything into a mini food processor, used sesame oil vs. olive oil and upped the garlic. I also added in the reserved bean liquid as needed along with a splash of lemon juice. I served it topped with a bit of paprika and surrounded by homemade pita chips - YUM!

"Impressive" my very picky husband concluded. He thought it was really good; I thought it was really good. The only thing this recipe was missing was lemon juice.  After tasting it I knew it needed a little zip and some of the other recipes had called for it. Just what it needed.  I just used the bottled stuff I had in the fridge and that worked wonders!  Also, I didn't actually measure out the spices, so I can't verify that the portions given in this are correct.     I'm pretty positive I didn't use the entire amount of cumin called for.  I also used kosher salt.  If you like garlic, I added an extra clove and I loved it. If your mix is gritty at all, don't fret.  Just add a little more oil or lemon juice and blend more in the food processor.  I think this would have not worked well in the blender.  I served it with homemade naan bread and cucumbers.  DELICIOUS!! (The first time I made I just ate it with some corn chips and it was great with that too.)

I made two variations on this recipe.  I left out the cumin and added fresh ground pepper.  To one batch I added sun-dried tomatoes and a little crushed red pepper to taste.  That was REALLY yummy.  To the other batch I added chili paste, minced ginger, soy sauce to taste.  The chili paste gives it a real kick.  I'm thinking kalamata olives and artichokes may work, too.  Awesome recipe.

This recipe is yummy and easy to make.  It is even better if you blend in the juice of half a lemon.

My girl scout troop made this, and it was a big hit with them! Parents are now asking for this recipe. Note: I liked it even better with 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice added.

Delicious and easy.  My two-year old and I made this together, and she thinks it is yummy too!  Leaving out the tahini saves a lot of calories.  Try it with a tablespoon of dijon mustard blended in for a more grown-up taste.

This was really good, and easy to make. Tastes even better the next day after the flavor has time to combine.

First, I'll say that if you have ever tasted homemade hummus, or good, quality hummus made fresh at a Greek or Middle Eastern restaurant, you will soon see that it's pretty much pointless to buy prepackaged hummus at your grocery store. I love this recipe because it's easy, I keep most of the ingredients on hand, and I feel that the lack of tahini gives the recipe broader appeal to those whose palates aren't accustomed to the flavors of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes.  I added a little more olive oil than the recipe called for, doubled the garlic, added some lemon juice, omitted the cumin, added some paprika and cayenne, and increased the salt a bit (but I also used no-salt-added garbanzo beans, which accounts for the need for extra salt).  Fabulous.  I love this recipe and will make it often!

This was very easy, and considering it was my first time trying hummus, I thought it was pretty good.  I think it would have worked much better in a food processor than in my blender, though.  I used less salt and cumin because I was sharing it with my baby.  He liked it too!

I didn't think that this hummus was good at all.  It was way too bland and the cumin made it taste like a bowl of blended up chili beans instead of hummus.  It was definitely easy to make but it wasn't worth even that little bit of effort.

REally Great Start. I like to add the juice of half a lemon, and a tablespoon of peanut butter. Adds extra protein, and is much cheaper and easier to come by than tahini. Also a little less bitter than tahini, for picky kids.

This was a very good basic recipe.  I added more garlic, a little bit of lemon juice, and some cayenne for a little bite.  In response to the reviewer who asked why we would want to leave out the tahini -- in addition to sesame being a pretty nasty allergen (as someone else pointed out), many of us live in areas where "international foods," especially Middle Eastern/Mediterranean foods, are not easy to come by, and when we can get them, they're not cheap.  The best thing about this dish is that it is cheap -- I can make it for approximately 72 cents.  If I were to buy tahini to add to it, it would make it about 6 dollars, because that's what an tiny, old, dusty jar of tahini costs at my grocery store. :)

Yum!  I use this recipe all the time for an extremely quick, easy, and delicious hummus.  It is easy to alter it to suit your taste.  Sometimes I will add oil packed sundried tomatoes (~1/2 of a jar, rinsed, per batch) which makes it extra yummy (if you like sundried tomatoes, that is!) but it is also great as is.  I use it to dip carrots, tortilla chips, pita bread, and even regular bread.  Yum!

This IS super-easy!!!  And very delicious!  I took some other's advice and cut back the cumin to 1 tsp. and added a dash of parsley, chili powder, paprika and I used minced garlic from a jar.  I also added sesame seeds[cuz I had em!]  Needed lotsa bean juice to get the right consistency, so make sure you save it!  VERY good alternative to the real deal, though the color was not my fav....but it didn't negate the taste, which was awesome!  Thank You!  OOooo...and lemon juice...the lemon juice I added was extra helpful I think with the flavor!

Great recipe! This hummus is super easy to put together, calls for basic pantry ingredients, and is healthy and so tasty! Plus, it's a really healthy dip for fresh veggies. I made it exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing, as it's delicious the way it is. I made it in my food processor and processed it for a really long time so that it was really smooth and creamy in texture. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's wonderful and I'll be making it again!

Very good- I did the garbanzo beans from scratch (not hard, just boil them until tender).  I did add more garlic, lemon, and oil- but the basis of this recipe is an excellent springboard. No tahini is the key I was searching for, and this recipe delivered. I paired it with the "Pita Chips" recipe by Dawn and voila! pita chips and hummus at a fraction of the cost with completely most excellent results. Do this- you won't be disappointed.

Thanks for a great tahini free recipe!  Just as an FYI, tahini is made from sesame seeds and while it has nutrients, many children who have nut allergies, are also allergic to sesame - it's one of the top 10 allergens. This tahini free recipe is great for when you have children over - nutritious and safe.

I agree w/ other reviews: 1/2 the cumin, add in 1 Tbl. lemon juice. I used less salt as my pita chips are quite salty already ;) I did add in 2 tsp. of fresh chopped parsley too. Also for kick, when it's done, put it in a bowl and swirl on some Siracha hot sauce on top, YUMMY!

This hummus is awesome and easy!  I tweaked the recipe after reading the reviews.  I doubled the recipe so I put in 6 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp of cumin and the juice of 1 lemon.  I also put in about 3 shakes of ceyenne pepper to give some zip and added some roasted red peppers from a jar.  IT WAS AWESOME!  Leave it in the fridge overnight for a better flavor!  I definitely will be making htis again.  It took about 5 whole minutes to make.  It took longer getting my blender out!

Thank you for the great hummus!  I took suggestions from the other reviewers and added sesame oil instead of olive oil.  had to make it in batches, but well worth the effort!

I always buy hummus for my two year old because she loves it.  When I came across this recipe I thought I'll give it a try.  Well she dipped her cracker in it and the first thing out of her mouth was "yummy, good more".  If a two year old loves this recipe...it's definitely worth trying!

This was a really good recipe for hummus without tahini. The cumin was a little much, and I love cumin. It is better halved. It is also better with about 1 TBS lemon juice. I'll make it again I'm sure. We ate this with pita chips (allrecipes) and cut up vegetables.

I had no idea that hummus could be so simple and inexpensive to make. This was awesome and will be a regular at my house from now on. I added a little lemon juice, decreased the cumin and increased the garlic to my tastes, and made it in a cheap old blender since I do not own a food processor. I thought the taste and texture were both fabulous.

Wow! This recipe was great for me since I can't get tahini where I live. I started with 3 cloves of garlic and 1tsp cumin, and then alternately added lemon juice, cumin, cayenne pepper and paprika until it fit my tastes. Then I let it sit overnight  for the flavors to develop. I served it  with homemade chips made from flour tortillas: brush a tortilla with olive oil, then sprinkle garlic salt and parmesan cheese, cut into 6-8 wedges, and bake until golden. My boyfriend ate almost the whole thing in one sitting!

I have tried a few times making hummus from scratch and was never very pleased with the taste. I made a few changes (no cumin, added 1tsp of lemon juice and 1/2tsp of peanut butter) but I really liked the taste without the tahini.

This is so tasty, simple and CHEAP compared to store-bought hummus.  I used the first reviewer's suggestion about sesame oil, and then halved the cumin and doubled the garlic for my own taste.  Thanks for a healthy recipe!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I have been complaining for a while now that I would like to make my own homemade hummus but tahini is just too expensive and I could only find large cartons of it.  This worked great!  Added a bit of lemon juice and a little extra garlic.  Next time I will add roasted red peppers for flavored hummus (and next time will be very soon!).

I reduced the cumin by a teaspoon, and added lemon juice and sesame oil.  I also doubled the garlic (as I do for EVERY recipe), but that was a mistake.  My 3 year old loved it!

The amount of cumin is grossly miscalculated. No amount of salt, lemon, and garlic could save it.

This is a good base recipe, but hummus without tahini? Mor like garbanzo spread .  Change this recipe with a few tablespoons of lemon juice, a few tablespoons of sesame tahini, and extra garlic and it is perfect basic hummus!  Sometimes I make it and add chopped roasted red pepper from a jar and grated parmesan cheese, for a nice change.  I haven't bought hummus pre-made since I began making it!

This recipe is very easy as well as very good, but is lacking something.  I will probably continue shopping around for an even better hummus recipe.

I always hate when recipes are rated and then the comments list all the changes that were done so really it's no longer the original recipe...and yet...that's what I'm doing.  Oops.  Used 1 tsp cumin, 1 Tbs sesame oil instead of olive and my garlic clove was huge and totally overpowering, next time I will def use less garlic.  I also added the juice of half a lime (most recipes call for lemon but I don't have any).  I would totally make this again and my guess is that original recipe rocks as well!

I made this for a quick and healthy lunch. I also liked the fact that it did not have any tahini which is hard to find and expensive. I have made it before without it, but wanted to try a specific recipe. I followed the recipe except I cut the cumin in half as I am not a big fan of that spice. I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice as others suggested. I thought it tasted pretty good. I did use a hand emulsion blender to save time. After it was mixed I put it on a plate with a little olive oil on top and sprinkled with paprika and dried parsley. The consistency was a little less thick without the tahini, and the spice and garlic taste came out a little stronger, but it must have still been pretty good because a lot of it got eaten. I did find that it is best made fresh, as the spice and garlic will get stronger as it sits in the fridge, but it is quick and easy to make anyway.

Excellent recipe! We didn't have Tahini and this was a good alternative. We added paprika and definitely follow the recommendations of lemon. It brightened it up! I'll never use Tahini again.

I have wanted to try hummus for a long time and after looking at several recipes, I found one that did not call for tahini (which I don't have).  I also didn't have garbanzo beans, so I used white kidney (canellini) beans, which worked so well.  I also only used 1 teaspoon of cumin after seeing that a few people thought the full amount was overwhelming.  The end result was one flavorful hummus that my kids devoured.  Will be making this often and next time will try it with the right beans.

I use a half a tsp. cumin instead of 2 tsp. and add just under a tbsp of lemon juice - and it's just awesome and SO quick!  I cut up pitas into quarters and split them, brush olive oil mixed with oregano on a baking sheet, put the pitas on, brush the tops of them with the olive oil/oregano and put them in the oven for 10 minutes on 350 degrees.  It's now a family favorite snack!

I was looking for a tahini-free, easy hummus and this is it!  Not the same as the local mediterranian restaurant, but a good substitute.  The versions are endless too!  Throw in some roasted red pepper, or sundried tomato.

Well I don't know how well this will keep but it doesn't need to because the BF and I can eat it up in one sitting lol. SKIP THE SALT I'd say, unless you rinse the beans like mad. Other than that the spices are great. AFTER blending, I might add some parsley or cilantro (chopped by hand or stirred in), some diced red pepper or paprika, or some lemon juice, depending on the end outcome you want.

This recipe is even easier than it sounds! I will be adding this recipe to my collection!! The reason that I only gave it 4 stars was that I like my hummus a little more flavorful, but was easy to alter. I added an extra clove of garlic, 3/4 tsp lemon juice, and then sprinkled paprika over the whole thing. I think the cumin was a little overpowering, so next time I will be adding a little less. I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe though! Easy and good!!

Wonderfully easy!  Even my 5 yr old could help.  I made this with 2 tsp cumin (we like the flavor), doubled the garlic, and added paprika and lemon juice as suggested by others.   I liked it blander as written but my family liked it spicier. Wonderful flavor either way depending on your tates.    I do recommend you taste it after mixing it as listed to see what you would like.  Also, Add bean liquids carefully.  One can I used had so many beans that it took all of the remaining liquid to get the consistency I wanted.  The next can of the same brand had fewer beans I guess.  I added all the liquid at once and the consistency was much thinner.  Even better the next day after being refrigerated.

This is WONDERFUL!!! My family and I just love it! It's great that there is no Tahini in it and the ingredients are ones that I keep on hand all the time. I made it in only 2 or 3 minutes. I did add paprika and cilantro. EXCELLENT!!!

Very good. I've made it several times in the past several years, but I'd forgotten about this recipe until today, when my daughter and I got into the hummus I'd bought for my boyfriend. We wanted more, and this is so cheap! I used 1 can of garbanzos, 1 clove of garlic, 1 tsp cumin, about 1/4 tsp salt, a few good squeezes of lemon juice, and about half of the bean water. I omitted the oil because we both thought it was awesome without! Thank you for sharing, Donalyn!

I made this for a get together about a month ago and everybody loved this.  This was the first time to make hummus without the tahini.  I'm making it again as my hubby really liked it.  This time I'm going to add some roasted red peppers.  It would be a great addition to a wrap or sandwich. UPDATE: I MADE THIS WITH ROASTED RED PEPPERS AND IT WAS AMAZING!!!  I LOVE THIS STUFF

This was a great base recipe!  I tried it just as the recipe calls for and then made a few adjustments.  I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice and just a few sundried tomatoes to add a little something extra.  I will make this again!

This was an excellent basic recipe. It has more of a dip consistency, and isn't as creamy as sesame based hummus, but all the same, I found it to be delicious. I added 1 tsp greek seasoning, lemon juice, white pepper, extra garlic and 1/4 roasted red pepper. I also added a few drops of sesame oil which it could have went without.

Just made this and it is fantastic!!  I did add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice from a bottle.  Other than that, made it per recipe with all the same measurements and it is very very good!  Only had to use about 1/4 of reserved liquid from beans.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Lesson learned: Listen to the WRITER and not the reviewers. 2 cloves of garlic is way too much for this - should have listened to the writer. Good, easy hummus. Takes seriously 5 minutes to make.  Yum!

Loved this! Followed other reviewers and cut the cumin in half, used 1/2 tsp of fresh lemon juice,  used sesame oil and a dash of red pepper. So good! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is the only hummus recipe I use!  Definitely switch the olive oil for sesame oil for best flavor, and I add a little lemon. I don't double the garlic like other reviewers because I am not a fan, but I do use a little less cumin.  My stepdaughter loves this and asks for it often.  I make this with an immersion blender, and it whips up in seconds.  Try this:  after you have your mix seasoned to taste, stir in a can of tuna and serve this in pitas or as a dip with naan bread.  Wow, it's good!  My nephew can't have mayo, so this is how they eat tuna salad in their house now.  Very nutritious!

I have to agree about the cumin.  I made the recipe as is and the cumin is just very overpowering.  I wish I had read the reviews before I made this!! I don't care for the taste!

I've been searching for a hummus recipe with no tahini because I haven't been able to find any at the grocery store. I used a 19oz can of beans. I added a tablespoon of sesame oil and used about 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil. I also used about a teaspoon and a half of an indian spice blend since I didn't have cumin and I also added about a half teaspoon of pepper. The indian spice gave it a delicious kick of flavor. I also added 2 tablespoons of golden flax seeds, which I ground first. Really easy and yummy recipe!

I actually think it's more like 3 1/2 stars. I thought it needed something.  I'd make it again, it's not bad. I might add less bean liquid next time and maybe a little less cumin. I may also add a little lemon juice (fresh).

It was easy ( though instead of a blender or food processor I you a potato masher) It wasn't the same consistency as usual hummus, it tastes amazing (I'm eating it right now)I also added a teaspoon on lemon juice.

I am addicted! When I found out how fatening Tahini was, I vowed to not eat hummus for a while, since I cannot stop eating it. This is a great way to get my hummus fix without all the fat. I do add pepper and 1 tablespoon lemon and it is delicious. Great with baked rice chips or carrots.

This one is a hard one for me to rate. I didn't like it as written. But, to be fair, I've never had hummus made by anyone but me. I really have no idea what it's supposed to taste like. I followed the recipe except for a bit of sesame oil for the olive. Didn't like it & had to spice it up with lemon juice, paprika, more garlic & cayenne. I'm sure that's not traditional for hummus, but I ended up liking it.

I agree that the amount of cumin is too much. The end result was tasty, but it still wasn't quite as good as some store brands, in my opinion.  I'd definitely make it again, however, as it's easy and still tasty!

This is really good hummus.  I did reduce the cumin down closer to 1-1.5 teaspoons.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and a good helping of lemon.  Very tasty.  This would be a great hummus to "dress up" with roasted bell peppers, sundried tomatos or fresh herbs.

For people who are still looking for the tahini taste, substitute a small amount of sesame oil for some of the olive oil. I've also tried with roasted red peppers. Definitely needs more garlic and some lemon, though.

Really great! I added a splash of fresh lemon juice and served with corn chips and cucumber slices. I like my hummus a bit on the chunky side so I use a potato masher to break up the chick peas rather than putting them into a blender.

Although tahini is high in fat (not a dieter's delight) it tastes wonderful and adds incredible texture and flavor, while low in Cholesterol and Sodium. It amply provides Thiamin, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Zinc, Copper and Manganese, so I believe its benefits outweigh a couple of calories - why leave it out?

Great recipe.  Sooo easy!  I have to watch my sodium intake, so used low-sodium garbanzos and less salt.  But I think the cumin really adds character to the taste.

I first tasted hummus while at college and just loved it.  I didn't realize how easy and cheap it is to make it!!  I really like this recipe because it's so easy and it's so basic.  I added extra garlic, 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice, some Mrs. Dash, onion poweder and some salt.  I can't wait to try it with roasted red pepper.  This is so yummy!  I don't like mine as a thick paste, so I added more EVOO and all the liquid.  Just yummy!!

This is easy to make and very tasty!  I omit the liquid and add more oil until I get the desired consistency.  Instead of cumin I use 1/8 tsp ground red cayanne pepper and I roast the garlic beforehand.

Read the notes; they are absolutley helpful. I halved the cumin, doubled the garlic, squirted in some lemon juice, lessened the salt - I love seasoning, but I'm trying to lower my salt intake, so do what you need to do with that - added a dash of black pepper, a pinch of cayenne and some sesame seeds. It was really good.

AWESOME recipe!  I LOVE hummus but I almost never have tahini on hand to make it with so I end up having to buy premade stuff at the store.  This recipe TOTALLY eliminates that!  

Two things I did differently.  I added 1 TBSP of lemon juice (just the concentrated stuff I had in the fridge) and I used sesame oil instead of olive oil.  It gave the finished hummus that sesame taste that is in traditional hummus without having to buy an expensive bottle of tahini.

I've also double the recipe and used 1 TBSP of sesame oil and 1 TBSP of olive oil and saw no difference in the taste.  Everyone I've served this too is totally wowed by it.

Absolutely delicious!!! Much better than store-bought hummus. Like other users, I added 1T fresh squeezed lemon, an extra clove of garlic, and only 1t of cumin. I used 1.5C of frozen chickpeas that I had previously cooked and just added a bit of water. I used my blendtec twister jar to blend it and it turned out beautifully! Smooth and creamy. Next time I may try adding a little fresh jalapeno.

This is a pretty good hummus.  I don't like tahini so tried this.  I use lemon flavored olive oil and added bit more cumin & big pinch cayenne pepper.   Also, I thin it out a little with water vs more olive oil or lemon juice.   We serve with baby carrots & celery sticks for low fat & satisfying snack.  A squeeze of fresh lemon juice at end brightens it up.

Note:  This review is for the basic recipe with changes.  Very good and super easy.  Due to personal taste and other reviews, I doubled the garlic and halved the cumin, added 1 T. lemon juice and a sprinkle of paprika.  Thanks Donalyn, I'll be making this often!

AMAZING QUICK RECIPE! I added half a lime, half a jalapeno and used 1/2 tsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp seasame oil...oh I found this awesome recipe for chapsti bread instead of pita bread which I find to be too doughy http://allrecipes.com/recipe/indian-chapati-bread/. I served it with the warm chapati and fresh cucumbers. Soooo good! I suggest using a food processor or hand blender something that makes your margaritas isn't going topurée it all that well.

Rated only 4 starts since I had to change it so much. Surprisingly, I had all of the ingredients needed for this hummus! I read the reviews beforehand and added in my own tweaks. I feel like these ingredients are a good BASE to a hummus recipe. 

I omitted the olive oil, doubled the cans of garbanzo beans, added 3 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of garlic powder (I like it garlic-ky!), the juice of a whole lemon (I like it tangy!), and a tablespoon of sesame oil since I had no tahini, salt to taste, and a dash of paprika. 

It turned out really yummy! I will be bringing this to class for my lunch break.

Good, but I agree with other reviews that it's a bit bland.  I mixed in some homemade taco seasoning (about a tbsp, no salt added) and now have a taco-ish flavored hummus that is quite tasty!

Great base recipe, as I didn't have tahini on hand. Only giving 4 stars because it required many adjustments for flavor: I used sesame oil instead of olive oil, fresh lemon juice instead of canned bean juice for texture, fresh parsley, extra garlic, and cayenne pepper to taste. Toasted some pita and had an excellent study snack!

I Just have one word to describe this recipe (AWESOME)!!! I followed the advise of others and  added sesame oil instead of olive oil, and lemon juice and of course since I love garlic I added about 2 extra cloves. YUM.....My 16 year old son who never eats anything but junk food gobbled it down on everything ( bagels, crackers, and chips etc. )and I had to make more. Thanks for sharing!! Finally something healthy my teenager will eat.YEA...............

I love this recipe!!  As a follower of "Engine2 Diet", I just omitted the oil. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the garlic, halved the cumin, added  red pepper flakes and added 1 TBsp of lemon juice. The first batch was gone in just a few minutes! So then I made a triple second batch. This is a new family favorite.

This was really tastey.  My 4 year old and 2 year old couldnt get enough of it, and neither could I.  We used it as a dip for carrot sticks.  Definitly going to make this again.  I used dried garbanzo beans, by getting them prepared and using half a lb of them.  Other then that the only thing I changed was using the juice of half a lemon, and in my portion I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.  Debated on 4 or 5 stars because the lemon juice was so important, but its such a great base recipe that I just had to give it 5 stars.

Delicious!  Was very easy to make.  I did make some adjustments based on some of the other revues.  I used 1/2 the cumin, added a couple squeezes of lemon juice, a tbsp of crushed red pepper.  I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I used the jarred minced garlic.  It was very good.

Very quick and easy, tastes great. It is a more familiar American taste since it doesn't have the Tahini and lemon juice of other hummus but it does taste wonderful!

This is great! We love the store bought hummus but it can get very expensive.  I had a hard time finding tahini paste in my small town, so I thought I would give this a shot. This will now be made all the time here.  I did decrease the cumin and added some lemon juice.  Thanks!

This is simple and good with a squeeze of lemon, but I like my hummus with a kick so I added chile oil from another reviewers suggestion. I only went with one teaspoon of cumin otherwise it's too strong.

Added some lemon juice, as recommended by others, and didn't exactly measure the other ingredients.  My 6 year old daughter gobbled it up, but my 4 year old son apparently has not yet acquired the taste!!  I'll keep trying with him, because I really enjoyed this.

Yum!  I took the advice of replacing olive oil with sesame oil.  Next time I think I'll do half and half.  1 Tbl of sesame oil was a little strong for 1 can of beans for my taste.  But the texture that came out of my food processor was just like the stuff you buy in the store.  Great with carrot sticks, celery, tortilla chips, crackers........

for a super quick, cheap easy hummus fix without the tahini this is it. After I made it, I read some reviews and another reviewer added sesame oil to theirs, so I did too. Cant really miss the tahini now :)

Modified as others have done.  Added 1 T fresh lemon juice, only 1 teaspoon cumin, added a few shakes of Southwest seasoning for flavoring (ancho pepper, onion, garlic, Mexican oregano, cayenne pepper chipotle & cilantro).  Also added 1/3 cup shelled, roasted pistachios which gave it a great flavor & texture.  Delicious!!

This was just okay to me. I have to admit that I am not a hummus lover to begin with, but this tasted more like a taco dip than hummus. My girls however liked it for that reason...never having had hummus before. Out of my two dips, this is the one I had the most leftover. I made it exactly as called for in the recipe.

I had to use more garlic than the recipe called for, other than that it is delicous!  i couldn't get the right texture for me, but that could be my food processor...

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to make a few changes to get it the way I like it.  Here's what I did: Doubled the garlic (I like garlic heavy hummus) Omitted the salt Doubled the olive oil Added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice Added a small amount of water as it was blending in the food processor instead of using bean liquid (I had drained mine for using a few beans to garnish a salad, otherwise I would have used the bean liquid)  Initial taste test:  Very yummy and should be more awesome tomorrow.

I didn't have any tahini, so I was pleased to find this recipe.  But, I was even more pleased with how easy it was to make, and how delicious it was.  My family loved it, including my picky kids.  I love that I can make it any time because it calls for ingredients that are pantry staples at our house.  Delicious with veggies, pita bread, chips, or on sandwiches.

I really did not like this.  I thought the cumin was too strong.  I even followed the suggestions of others and added some lemon juice and sesame seeds.

My hummus has always been a favorite among my social circle (I can skip the party and no one cares as long as I send my hummus in my place) but I've been frustrated by both the cost and the staleness of the tahini that my grocery store carries.  This tahini-free recipe seemed like the perfect solution ... but oh, I really missed the sesame flavor!  I took one reviewer's advice and substituted sesame oil (which isn't exactly cheap either) but a tablespoon wasn't enough flavor.  I wasn't content with it until I put in 2 or 3 tablespoons of tahini.  Ahhhhh .... just right!

Great recipe!  The only thing is the calories are WAY off.  It's actually 126 calories per serving, not 35 that was mention.  Still love the recipe, but if people are watching their calorie intake just wanted them to be prepared ;)

This was an awesome recipe for hummus without the tahini!  I enjoyed making it (nothing easier than putting all the ingredients in a food processor!) and my guests enjoyed eating it:)  I did add some lemon juice and pepper as others wrote because the cumin taste was overpowering to me.  No one else complained.

very good!  i don't like tahini much, so I didn't miss it at all.  I do think it's missing a bit of a kick, so I added lemon juice--maybe a tbs or so--and it gave it the flavor I was looking for.  thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time I try or make hummus. I added a bit of lemon juice, substituted half of the oil for sesame oil and half the cumin. It was really good! Also added some fresh cilantro to the mix. I will definitely be making this again! I loved it! And it's healthy too!

Great foundation recipe. The best part is, a 16 oz batch cost barely $1 for me to make - compare that to hummus that is sold at the grocery store, and the savings are huge. I added a teaspoon of sesame oil, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. This turned out extremely flavorful, savory, and rich - and healthy. Thanks for providing the recipe.

Super simple to make and so much cheaper than store bought Hummus. I used the recommendations to cut the Cumin in half, added 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and substituted Sesame Oil for the olive oil.  A big hit.

Quick, easy, and very easy to customize to your tastes. I never follow a recipe exactly, so I skipped the cumin (I was out) and added 1/4 tsp red curry powder, 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 tsp sesame seeds, then blended all the spices with oil before adding the garbanzo beans. I found adding in 1/4 cup of the reserved juice was just right for the consistency I wanted. Next time I will double the garlic and add lemon juice as well - I agree that this would take it to the next level. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the closest I'm ever come to store bought hummus. The cumin was a little over powering but I will definitely make again and play with the ingredient amounts.

I used this recipe for a unit I was doing in my classroom. I had 3 groups of 6 students and gave them all the materials in a bowl. I let them mash it up using forks and then I blended the mash in a blender and let them eat it on pita bread. I was worried they wouldn't like it, but they DEVOURED it. Some of them began eating it straight from a spoon. It really is a great, kid friendly recipe that is easy and yummy. I LOVE how cost effective it is too. It tastes just as good as the 4.00 tubs you can get at the deli and it only cost 88 cents for a can of garbanzo beans. You can't beat that :) I have begun making it at home for myself too.

This is a great basis for a hummus recipe. From this I sometimes put in cilantro or green onion. Sesame seeds or sesame seed oil are nice additions, as are red pepper and lemon juice. If you use sesame seed oil or lemon juice, leave out the olive oil.

I really liked this recipe! The kind I find at the store usually isn't garlicky enough, and way too lemony for my taste. This recipe was perfect, except I added a bit of extra garlic.

This was indeed easy, but I didn't enjoy it very much.  I was glad to find this recipe because I didn't have tahini on hand, but I think without the tahini, hummuss really suffers texture-wise.  The flavor was good, but I couldn't get past the texture.

We wanted to make a more orginal version of hummus, but didn't have any tahini on hand so I tried this. I read the reviews first and not being a huge fan of cumin I substituded 1 of the tsp cumin for paprika. I also added a shot of lemon and more garlic (since we are addicted). I am so happy to have found this recipe! Never again will I save money to buy the expensive prepared vesion.

Great starter recipe.  I added half of the cumin and it tasted perfect. I also added paprika and parsley on top and refrigerated for several hours. Used whole wheat pitas cut in triangles that I toasted in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll never buy hummus from the store again.

Very good and easy to make.  I cut the cumin in half, added a little lemon juice and a little ground red pepper.  I wish I would have cut the salt in half--the beans had plenty!  Other than that, this was great.

I would not make this again. The cumin was too overpowering and the consistency wasn't like hummus either. It was also very unappealing.

This is a decent hummus recipie for those who insist on leaving out the tahini.  The cumin saves it from being boring, but there is a distinct lack of creaminess.

I thought this recipe was very simple and easy to make! Mine came out a little runny because I wasn't watching what I was doing but it still tastes wonderful! Would eat again. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because it needs more zing! I put in some cayenne pepper. Lemon juice would be good too!

Easy to make, good amount of seasoning if you don't have many spices that are in other hummus recipes. Easy to choose desired texture.

This is a great alternative way for making hummus. I thought 2 tsp cumin would be too much (even though I love it), so I decreased it to 1.5 tsp and added about 1/2 tsp chili powder. Should be great with lemon juice, too. I'm happy I found this recipe that could easily satisfy my craving for hummus.

I had been looking for a hummus recipe that was easy, and this definitely fits the bill. I also added some cayenne pepper, and then a little extra water which made it more like a soup. Very good.

Very easy as titled, but a bit too much cumin.  I did end up adding lemon juice and also some sour cream I had around to dampen down that strong flavor a bit.  Next time, I'll knock the cumin back to 1 tsp.  If you don't like tahini as an add-in, you can use any kind of nutter butter you prefer instead or leave it out as this recipe does.

This was very good for only taking 5 minutes to prepare! I also added 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garam masala and upped the olive oil. The garam masala especially gave this a lot of flavor.

This is a solid, base recipe and since I didn't have tahini I wanted to use a recipe that didn't include it. I used dry beans instead of canned so you'll have to do the conversion. I started with the basics and adjusted based on my preferences.  The only thing I added was red pepper. So many creative ways to work with this but a great foundation to build from.  My kids loved it!

This is my go-to hummus recipe.  I am not a fan of tahini flavor, so this was perfect. It is excellent as written, with the addition of the juice of half a lemon.  Sometimes I choose to increase the garlic, and I almost always sprinkle in a little extra cumin (just because I love it!)  My favorite addition was a jar of roasted red peppers, which made the most delicious hummus. I, too, serve it either with veggies or I make my own pita chips to go with it. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Really good! Great alternative for my son, who is allergic to sesame. I added a little extra olive oil and a few squeezes of lemon. The one garlic clove I used ended up being too strong for my son, but I will make this again with less garlic for him. I think I would love some chopped olives or pickled jalapeños in this for myself!

Omg, this was SOO easy. And I am curses in the kitchen. I might use less cumin next time but that is just a personal taste issue. This is a GREAT base recipe to use for flavored hummus. Can't wait to add black olives!  Thank you for this. Also very kid friendly.

The only changes I made to this recipe was to add a little oregano and cayenne pepper. Didn't really use much of the bean liquid to avoid the preservative and reduce the sodium. Who needs store bought hummus when you can make your own. The only way thing better than canned beans is fresh ones, if you can get it!

If you want to make it less fattening, add a teaspoon or so of water while blending it. It will come out just as creamy, but without all the extra oil.

This is definitely extra easy! I had to add more of the spices and I added a little lemon juice. Was not disappointed. I would make this anytime I wanted hummus and didn't have tahini for sure.

I did like a few comments said and added a little bit of lemon juice and some water (didn't think and drained my beans before so couldn't use that). It was delicious though and my new favorite hummus!

I omitted the olive oil. It's not necessary. I halfed the cumin because 2 teaspoons seemed a bit much. 1 good sized clove of garlic is fine. I would only use 2 if they were small cloves. I used 3 tablespoons of the bean juice and added juice from half of a small lemon which was 1 tablespoon. Be careful with salting this as it is plenty salty to begin with from the beans. I blended it up in the blender tried it out and it was wonderful except for the lack of tahini. I added 2 drops of smoked sesame oil and reblended it. My girlfriend said it was the best hummus she'd ever had.

Fast, Easy & Delicious! I made a few modifications based on some of the reviews: 1T sesame oil in place of the olive oil, more garlic, less cumin. I added juice of half a lemon, a healthy shake of cayenne pepper, 2 T roasted red pepper and about 1/4 cup of the reserved liquid.

I wanted hummus but did not have any tahini (actually hard to find in my area for some reason).  I found this recipe and I am so glad I did.  My family loved this recipe!  Everyone gobbled it up.  Granted it's not huge on flavor but I love that it is so basic and that I can add to it as I want with a roasted garlic or roasted red peppers or other spices.  I added a little lemon juice is all, maybe a 1-2 TBSP.

Based on some reviews of it being bland, I added some paprika and sriracha to kick it up a little.  My guests ate a lot so I guess it was a hit!   I forgot to save the liquid from the beans so just used olive oil to get the consistency right, but wish I wouldn't have done that.

Used this as a base for my own hummus to which I added sun dried tomato and basil. Turned out really good.

Not creamy like regular hummus.  Not great flavor.  I used 1T lemon juice, 1T sesame oil, 1T olive oil, double garlic, half cumin.

Made this for Bible Study there was very little left.  Good taste without being heavy, I added a little lemon zest and more minced garlic, used some reserved juice from the beans & EVOO.  Wonderful - is definately a keeper.

Made this when I noticed my tahini had gone bad :( So easy and delish! I added juice of 1 lemon and a dash of hot pepper powder. Yum!

Tastes Great!!!! I made it as written except I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of one clove of fresh garlic. I also added a dash extra cummin after tasteing. Really liked it. I'm going to try adding more garlic next time to see it that makes it even better.

I made a few adjustments and this hummus was amazing!!! I omitted the cumin and added a marinated artichoke heart and a few tablespoons of sesame seeds. I also took the skin off the garbanzo beans, which made the hummus so creamy and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I just made it for the first time. It is WONDERFUL! I was looking for a nice healthy dip with easy to find ingredients. Tahini is not easy to find around here unfortunately, so I was pleased to see this recipe doesn't call for it. I was even more pleased after making this and finding it so delicious it doesn't need tahini or any other enhancements.

My hummus has never ever turned out quite right until this recipe.  I substituted sesame oil for the olive oil, garnished it with fresh cilantro, and served it with a black olive tapenade (recipe by TERESITA79).

I rated it 4 because it needed so many adjustments. I agree with everyone else only use half the cumin, next time i would even go light handed with it. It needed the lemon to brighten it up, I think thats definitely necessary. I used 1tbs. but I think that was a bit much. Im' still waiting for it to sit in the fridge and blend, so i'll know what the final outcome is in about an hour. 
    I wanted to make mine a roasted garlic version. I'm a garlic nut. I'll defn. add more of that next time. i roasted about 4 cloves in the oven with olive oil and added a few dashes of garlic powder and the cumin/sesame oil still overpowered it. 
 I read some reviews saying they used sesame oil instead of olive oil. In the same tablespoon i did half olive oil half sesame. I think it gave it that traditional hummus flavor but i'll use more olive oil next time. 
   I still think this is a great basic recipe. I live in Japan and tahini is hard to come by. I've been craving hummus and came across this recipe! I'll keep this is my books til i perfect it to my taste! Thanks for the post!

Very good base recipe but needs a lil something. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne, extra lemon, garlic powder and dried onion to taste. Even though my last ingredient sour cream is not very traditional, it made it creamier and added more protein. I used organic reduced fat sour cream and the final result was perfect.

Loved it! Only 4 stars b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But that's what the reviews are for, right? Per others' advice, I rinsed and peeled the garbanzo beans. (A little time-consuming, but easy and kinda fun - they squish right out of their skins!) Used 2 big cloves of garlic, only about 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, only a little sprinkling of salt, 1 T olive oil, 1 T lemon juice, a little paprika, and some sesame seeds that were on sale. I wanted a hummus recipe without tahini b/c my regular grocery doesn't have it and I'm too lazy to go to the fancy store. But they carry sesame seeds and sesame oil! Considered subbing sesame oil for the olive oil, but the seeds were cheaper and I'm not sure what else I would use sesame oil for. Added about half of the bean juice back in (gradually, of course!) and processed the heck out of it to make it super smooth and creamy (peeling the beans helps the texture, too.) Sprinkled a little more paprika on top to make it pretty and let it sit in the fridge overnight before taking it to work for potluck, where it was a HUGE hit. I just finished eating the scant leftovers and wish I had more, so I will definitely be making this again.

Yes, this was easy, and I tried it because I didn't have any tahini on-hand, and I only found out after the fact that I had sesame oil. This recipe left something to be desired (perhaps I missed the sesame taste and couldn't get past it?).  I almost tripled the cayenne and lemon and used a little more salt, and still this left my palate wanting.

This was super simple and really yummy!  I've always bought hummus at the store, but my daughter has a project over ancient Egyptian food, and we chose to make it for that.  I was too cheap to buy a tiny jar of tahini for $10, so I was excited when I found this recipe!  Probably best anyway with possible "nut" allergies at school.  I think I'll be making this a lot more now...MUCH cheaper than store bought.

After losing our Tahini-free hummus supplier when we moved away from Trader Joe's we requested and requested that our local grocery store carry a Tahini free variety (due to a sesame sensitivity).  I feel silly for that now that I know how easy this is.  5 minutes, just as it said.  I severely felt the lack of lemon, but one wedge of lemon added, and this was perfect.  With our new wand blender, this was incredibly easy to whip up (and no blender cup to have to wash).  Add the lemon though, it needs it!

Although I used a can of white beans (simply because I had them on hand), this recipe still worked out pretty darn well. I added an extra clove of garlic to personal taste and reduced the cumin to 1 tsp. Awesome, quick, tasty snack.
*EDIT* Made this again following other reviewers' suggestions. Used sesame oil instead of olive, doubled the garlic, halved the cumin, and added in about 2 tsp lemon juice. These changes really make it taste like the more authentic stuff I make with tahini!

I use 1 t. cumin and 2 cloves garlic.  I also add about a quarter cup roasted red pepper, and lastly I use the juice from a half a lemon.  Fantastic stuff!

this is nice exactly as is.  If you want it spicy, you may have to add more cumin or pepper or something, but for a nice, mild hummus -- this is great.  Very easy.

I love this recipe. It's simple and fast! I just found this recipe 10 minutes ago and now I have a batch of hummus in the fridge waiting to be eaten! Some users complained that it didn't have much flavor, but I think it's the perfect starting point to get creative. Just add some roasted red peppers, jalepenos, or chilli sauce and it your good to go.

Great recipe. Very easy and inexpensive to make. This is the second time I have made it. I add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a pinch of cayenne to punch up the flavor a little bit. Yum.

I made this yesterday and I was surprised at how good it turned out. I did however follow the advice of others who said to cut the cumin amount in half and add 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to brighten it up. It was great with my veggie cips, baby carrots and cucumber slices. I will be making this again soon!

I give this 3 stars because I made some modifications.  I added a bit of lemon juice and a dash of chili oil to kick this up a bit.  Still a very easy and delicious recipe.

I added a little more olive oil to get a creamier texture, and just a dash of sesame seed oil to get a "tahini" flavor.  Great taste!!

Great basic recipe!  You can easily modify this to suit your taste buds.  I love basil, so I tend to add that as a garnish for hummus.  Excellent for all levels of cooking!  If you are new to cooking, this would be a great dish to bring to a party and surprise everyone with your skills!  ; )

If I had known you could make hummus without tahini, I would have started making it years ago! This was exactly like the title says -- extra easy. I did add a little lemon to suit my taste.

This recipe was so quick and easy!  I made it for my 2 yr old daughter to try since she hasn't liked hummus before.  I thought maybe the tahini was what was turning her off.  I was right!  She ate the whole bowl and asked for more!  This was a big hit in my house!

I used a 19 oz. tin of beans as it was all I could find.  As per other reviews, I added more garlic (3 cloves), halved cumin, and added a tbsp. lemon juice.  I LOVE it!!  I serve it drizzled with olive oil, and finely chopped roasted red pepper.  This is definitely something I will make over and over again!

As a "base" recipe to go from, this was great. I made several minor changes and have to tell you that even though it was my first time making Hummus, I was thrilled with the end result. I used roasted garlic, sesame oil and olive oil, sesame seeds and Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy.  Even my husband who is not into my "healthy" stuff was impressed and he's a chef! Easy, great tasting and healthy - what more could you ask for?

Me and my Wife made this Well she made it for the most part. I have never had it but was looking forward to it so she tasted it then added things to get the taste correct to what she remember and I am in love with a new happy Dip that i can not thank her enough for she is so wonderful. She add, a little more EVOO and a Half of lemon's juice squeezed into it. (4 TBSP). The after taste makes me want to go back and fix more.

I don't care for tahini, so this was a great alternative. I added 2 large garlic cloves, halved the cumin, skipped the salt and added 1/2 tsp of ancho chili powder to add a nice roasted taste but without the hotness of true chili.  I garnished it with a sprinkle of paprika and it was a huge hit at ladies poker night.

It's pretty good, but definitely needs lemon juice (I added 1T and it could have taken 2-3 times that amount), and only half the cumin amount.  I did try adding a little toasted sesame oil along with the olive oil to total 1T; next time I think I'll just throw in some sesame seeds and see how that goes.  My Vitamix did a lovely job blending this.  I didn't realize there was actually a recipe in the Vitamix book for this as well, and it's quite similar to this but adds quite a bit of lemon juice (about 2 tablespoons for 1 can of garbanzos).  If it were just me, I'd add more garlic as well, but my husband and son are not big garlic fans like I am.  I think this makes an excellent base recipe to add your favorite hummus flavorings to.  Very easy.

This is a go to for me.  I always have these ingredients in my pantry so if I want/need a healthy snack, I am just three minutes away.  It is delicious.  Sometimes I throw in some Paprika for a little extra fun.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great. This was very a quick and easy hummus. Since I generally have all this on hand it will definitely be a keeper, however, occasionally I will have to make it with tahini (for the perfect hummus!)

This is a very quick and easy recipie. Like others, I doubled the garlic and halved the cumin. I still find it a little bland though. Next time I will use the 2 tsp. of cumin and add a bit of lemon.

Takes only a few minutes to make this yummy hummus. I have had a few people tell me it is the best hummus they have ever tried, and request the recipe.  It is so easy, I will make it again and again.

Definately easy.  I was looking for a recipe that didn't have tahini since I didn't have any and didn't want to go out to the store.  I took other's suggestions and used 1 tsp olive oil and 2 tsp sesame oil (instead of all olive oil).  I also added 1/2 Tbs lemon juice.

This was exactly what I was looking for since I had no tahini on hand. It was quite good, but I did add just a few drops of pure sesame oil to aquire that sesame taste that the tahini normally provides. I'm giving it 5 stars because this hummus lives up to its name - it's extra easy to make! And because it tastes just like the stuff you pay $3-4 for at the grocery store.

This was pretty good for the simplicity of it.  I did add a little extra garlic (daughter's request) and the juice of 1 lemon. Already got another request to make it.  Thanks!!

Incredible. I am so happy with how easy and delicious this recipe is! Seriously! I followed the reviews from others and added a bit of fresh lemon juice. Then...I took half of it and processed some sun dried tomatoes in it... I'm so excited to eat this and share this recipe with friends! No more buying it from the store!

Thank you! I also used more garlic and less cumin. Added some lemon juice too. Now I realize hummus is just chickpeas, garlic, salt, lemon, oil, and whatever else you like.

Wow!  This really is a GREAT basic recipe for hummus when you don't have tahini hanging around in your pantry or a natural food store within driving distance! I found this recipe and doctored it to reproduce kalamata olive hummus I got @ the store for FOUR BUCKS A CUP...and then this AM, decided to just "follow the directions" so I could at least know what it tasted like "for real!!" It was very good.  I am not a cumin fan but still wanted to follow the directions without making myself feel icky, so I reduced the amt to 1/4 tsp...but everything else I left as is.  You really can do SO much with this as evidenced by the other reviewers.  This is SO much more nutritionally sound than the stuff you buy @ the store... and no kooky additives...a real winner...and my kids will likely enjoy the "flavored plain-ness" of this combination.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was the first time I have had hummus. It is soo good! I doubled the garlic and used sesame oil instead of olive. It's a delicious dip for raw carrots, cucumber, and green pepper. I will definetly be making this again! Thanks!

Really good recipe with some alterations. I omit the oil (doesn't need it), add paprika, lemon juice (2 tbsp), another garlic clove, and crushed red-pepper flakes. Rather than use the reserved garbanzo bean juice, I add a bit of water. Mash it with a fork and voila, wonderful! I serve it with raw veggies, chapati or pita bread (both from this website), crackers, the list is endless. We'll be making this rather than the buying it in the store.

This was good a very adaptable.  Made it as written, then divided it into 3 different bowls.  One bowl left alone, 2nd one I added roasted red pepper, and the 3rd I added lots of garlic.

I thought this was delicious and very easy. Had all the ingredients on hand. I did not have any tahini at home, which was I wanted to try this recipe. Definately add some lemon juice to taste before adding the reserved bean liquid. 1-2 Tbsp. of lemon juice should work. Great with pita bread, crackers, or fresh veggies.

Very easy recipe to follow. I had to use a blender and it was a little tricky with getting the right consistency. I just took my time with the blender. Had to blend, stop, stir, add liquid, blend stop, stir, etc.  Taste was great!

I hate to do negative reviews, but this hummus just tasted like plain chickpeas. I tried it after I noticed that I didn't have any tahini to make my usual recipe, so maybe it was the lack of tahini. I ended up putting some lemon juice, more garlic, and paprika to make it tastier, but couldn't quite enjoy it.

This was excellent. I doubled the recipe because it was for a party added 2 tsp. paprika and 1 tsp. lemon juice. I ended up having to add a little honey to cut the bitter from the lemon. I don't think I'd add lemon juice at all next time.

nummy stuff!  I love how simple this one is, and no special/expensive ingredients!  I did add a little extra garlic (I'm a fiend), one jalapeno fresh from the garden, a dash of red pepper & a little lemon juice.  MMM!  the one thing I would do differently is to add less of the juice back into the mix & maybe save out a couple tablespoons of the beans to add later for a little more "chunk" - I prefer my hummus a little less fluid - but the flavor is right on!  thanks for this one, it will be a regular in my home!

Excellent recipe and great fat reducer! Try this for variety: reduce cumin to 1/4 t. and add 1 half of a roasted red pepper (from jar).  Excellent!

I had this strange craving for Hummus but I do not/will not ever need to buy tahini so this was perfect.  Had everything else and added a little fresh lemon juice too of course.  Pretty good, just make it how you like it, that's the fun part!

I wanted to make hummus but was didn't have any tahini, so I gave this recipe a try -- and it was pretty good!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used half of the cumin (only 1 tsp), and added lemon juice.  A good way to cut the fat and skip the tahini if you need to or want to...

Didn't really taste like hummus. Cumin was too over powering.

So while I was at the store the other day I decided that I wanted to make hummus, but they didn't have any tahini there, then when I got home I realized that I forgot to buy a lemon.  So I found this recipe and gave it a try, using peanut butter like some other reviewers suggested and adding extra garlic.  It turned out pretty good.  Not the best hummus I've ever had but definitely better than the packaged ones you can buy (which I hate).

This was my first experience with hummus, so I don't have any idea what it's supposed to taste like. I also hate Chick Peas. I put half the cumin like others said and I doubled the salt and olive oil. It was pretty good. I wouldn't crave it over brownies or anything but if you're into healthy, this is the way to go.

this is easy to make; however, i think there is too much cumin in the original recipe. I made mine with only 1/4 tsp cumin and that was enough spice for me - with this variation - i'd give it 5 stars.

This hummus was so yummy! Thank you for sharing. I have  afeeling I'll be making it a lot! I made a few changes: I didn't put all the cumin as I didn't want it to overpower the other lovely tastes. I also cut some of the salt as it was getting pretty salty. I added loads of fresh parsley and it turned it green! But it looked and tasted soo much like guacamole that way! Yuummmm! I also added a few squirts of lemon juice. Put it all in the vita-mix and ta-dah! I made the recipe times 6 for our church luncheon. We're having it with pita bread. Its definitely a keeper. Thanks again!

Since I moved to Tokyo, I haven't found any Tahini(so i'm glad I found this recipe).  After I blended all ingredients, I wasn't sure if this would be good. I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it turned out to be delicious! Thank you.

Turned out well considering that I forgot to add the salt.  I used the juice of one small lime instead of lemon juice, since I usually have limes around but not lemons, and I added about 1 tbsp. fresh cilantro.  In the future, I will try to find some tahini to add to what I made this time, but this is a good recipe for hummus without tahini.

Tasted great!  I don't make hummus often, so it was nice to find a recipe without tahini in it.  I added a little black pepper, cayenne pepper, and lemon.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe!  I agree with one of the other reviewers who suggested sesame oil instead of olive oil for that "real" hummus flavor.  Absolutely perfect with baby carrots and celery!! Yum!!

I used avocado oil instead of olive oil because that’s what I had on hand, but followed the rest of the directions as-is, but it was kind of bland, except that the garlic was too strong. I’ve made a better tahini-free hummus using another recipe here on allrecipes, but can’t seem to find it now.

Super quick and easy to make. I substituted 1 tbsp of sesame oil for the olive oil. As well I only used 1 tsp of cumin and added the juice from 1/2 lemon. So good - my husband went back for multiple helpings.

QUICK and EASY to make! It isn't quite as creamy as store bought but STILL GOOD! Also YOU KNOW what is in it and it is FRESH, None of all those emulsifiers and junk!,   I ADDED: 1/8 cup lemon juice, used 1 large and 2 small cloves garlic, and a PINCH of red pepper flakes for a little kick.   I ONLY used  1 tsp ground cumin. Did add a little of the reserved drained liquid to make it creamier and thinner.

As many of the reviewers said, I substituted sesame oil for the oil the recipe calls for. I now make this version of hummus rather than the ones that use tahini. Much easier and tastes great.

Love it.  Very easy healthy snack. I ended up using 2 cans of garbanzo beans though as I found it too salty/garlicy with just one.  Will use this recipe over and over again!

Tried it myself. I figured out later that it's actually meant to be used as dip by a friend... oops. Well, it came out just as described... which was surprising considering what the ingredients were. I personally don't enjoy it, but my teacher and classmates do.

I made it leaving out the garlic and increasing the cumin and lemon juice.  It was easy and good and I am thrilled to have hummus again!  Thahini was always a problem as I do not eat sesame!

I first followed the original recipe, but it was very bland and a lot like baby food. So I tried more garlic and I added crushed red pepper , some parsley, and sun dried tomatoes and a tablespoon of cream cheese for a smoother creamy texture and it turned out amazing!

I followed the directions exactly but it had no flavor.  Added extra garlic and cumin to get some flavor from it but still rather bland.  Just not to my liking.

Delicious!! I have severe  food allergies and sesame is on that list. I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and found this to be delicious. I think the trick is to use a really good olive oil the best you can afford to mimic the missing sesame oil taste. Sesame is very potent which is what most people are looking for in a good humus. I used carlino olive oil drizzling the top with extra oil and a  sprinkle of sun dried tomatoes. Delicious with vegetables and homemade pita.

Quick and easy recipe. I doubled the recipe. I reduced the cumin to .5 tsp for 2 cans of beans. The cumin was still very strong. I used 1.5 small meyer lemon sqeezed and 3 garlic cloves. I used the suggested amount of olive oil and the texture is too oily. I also added .25 cup of the drained can bean juice for a smoother consistency . I Will definately make again but next time I will try fresh dry garbanzo beans.

If your beans have salt in them, do not add salt until you taste it. It was over the top salty to me. Luckily I had a box of no salt added beans too so I doubled the recipe and didn't add any salt the 2nd time. 

Great basic recipe. Easy to alter to fit personal tastes. (I added some lemon juice, turmeric, paprika and additional garlic.)

After making once as is (very good), took the advice of many others: halve the cumin, double the garlic, add 1 scant teaspoon sesame oil, and add the juice and zest of 1/2 a lemon. Absolutely delicious!!!

It was so easy!  I modified it just a little.  Instead of the juice from the chick pea can, I used Jalapeno juice and chopped up Jalapenos and the carrots and onions found in the Jalapenos can.  I also added some Chipotle seasoning.  It is fabulous!!!!

I had to add another garlic clove to the hummus to actually get flavor in it. It was bland. I added some spices and more salt, and it was much better. I probably would make this again, but using two garlic cloves, more olive oil, and less bean liquid.

suggest 2:1 olive to sesame oil  (I did 3 tsp total) and the T of Lemon juice.  Also, you get a much creamier consistency if you remove most of the chickpea skins.  Excellent!

This was so good and fast! I did make some changes like I found on another review. I used 2 cloves of crushed garlic, about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin, a splash of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paparica, 1/2 teaspoon of dill, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and just a touch of the drained liquid. It was very good.

This does not taste like hummus at all! This is basically a chickpea spread with too much cumin.

Very easy to make, but far too much cumin for my liking. I recommend reducing the cumin to 1 tablespoon and upping the garlic. 

Because there was too much cumin I turned it into a jalapeno hummus to salvage it.

I made this, and it was great.  I followed the advice of others. I love garlic, so I add an addition clove.  I found a container of marinated garlic, in the grocery store so I used that.  I also, put in marinated artichokes, hot pepper flakes, and a few drops of fresh lemon juice.  I did half the cumin.  Well make again!!!!!

Delish.  Simple too.  My crudite appetizers just got a bit fresher, more economical, and less processed.  Thanks for the recipe.  I suspect that additions could give it different personalities, olive, pine nut, lemon, roasted red pepper, etc.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a pretty tasty hummus. I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was. I didn't miss the tahini at all. The cumin wasn't overpowering. It was quite garlicky, but I liked that. I let it sit for a few hours before eating to let the flavors meld and then drizzled some extra virgin olive oil on top to serve. Very impressed!

This is an incredibly easy recipe. I prefer this recipe than those that require tahini. Even the husbund aproves! Adding a bit of lemon juice and Hungarian paprika helps kick up the flavor. For those who enjoy a strong garlic flavor, add about 3-4 cloves.

Pretty Good recipe.  I did do a few minor changes.  I took the advice of a few others and added 1 TBL lemon juice.  I used 1 Tsp garlic granules and 1/2 tsp garlic salt and doubled the cumin.  Sprinkled a little paprika on top for garnish.  Everyone ate it up.

I've made a recipe similar to this for years because I absolutely hate store-bought hummus...because of the overwhelming taste of tahini.  I add a bit more garlic and olive oil to help with the consistency.  I also add a splash of lemon juice and chopped sun-dried tomatoes.  It's always a hit with family and friends.  Thank you for this tahini-free recipe!

My almost 2 year old daughter can't have sesame but has always loved hummus. This was a terrific, easy recipe that she was eating with both hands and had all over her face - she was so pleased. I will probably reduce the salt a bit but that's just personal preference. Thanks so much for the easy delicious recipe!

I just finished making this and I must say it was yummy(: I had a lot of cans of chickpeas in pantry that I needed to get rid of. So I needed something quick and easy this was a hit. I followed one of recommendations by doubling the garlic, cutting the ground cumin in half, and adding a dash of red pepper, and lemon juice ! Delicious(:

I made the recipe with half the salt and double the garlic.  It still just tasted like salty cumin.  Next time, I will not add any salt, will half the cumin, and use real garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.  I love how easy it is and that my son ate some by the spoonful; it just needs to be tweaked for my personal taste.

I thought this hummus was terrible.  It had no depth of flavors, and adding the chickpea juice just made it worse.  And because it was so thick, it was difficult to scrape from the blender (mine is a Vitamix and does not unscrew at the bottom).  A food processer would be a much better option for making hummus.

I followed the basic recipe, doubled it since we like hummus so much, modified it a bit for our personal taste, only added 1 tsp cumin, added a squeeze of lemon, a dash of red pepper and a splash of sesame oil, blended in food processor until smooth. Really good, I will make it again!

Very easy to make. Tastes great. If you're not a big cumin fan, I would recommend using less cumin.

This hummus was disgusting. I did everything as called for by the recipe, except switching out the sesame oil with olive oil. The cumin taste was too significant and overpowering. I will not try this recipe again.

A good base recipe, but be sure to cut the cumin in half, and double or triple the olive oil for the correct consistency! For a little extra flavor, add some lemon juice, yummy!!

I love this because I don't have to go shopping to make it. I didn't have to go buy tahini, or sesame anything. I just googled it and pulled things out of my pantry that I had (and I almost always have) and whipped up some really good hummus! It was a little too much salt for my taste, but that could have been me over-pouring. I added some lemon to the second half of mine, and it was really good that way as well. Thanks for the recipe!!

I liked this w/ the 1T lemon juice but only 1 tsp cumin. Only problem was using the blender. The mix just stuck to the sides. I'll keep a can of garbanzo beans handy for this recipe but will use the mixer next time!

This recipe can be improved immeasurably by using dark sesame oil instead of the olive oil. It supplies the sesame flavor without using tahini. I always use the toasted sesame oil instead of tahini and I get rave reviews for my hummis. I also use a lot of garlic and add lemon juice, in addition to the cumin. YUM!

A little bland and I had to add water, but very easy to make with ingredients you have on hand.  I used black beans instead of chickpeas because that's what I had.  I served it on bread.

Super easy to make and customize. I made the first batch following the recipe. It was a basic hummus. Then I added more garlic and paprika (as others suggested.) I will try using sesame oil the next time I make this.

Good and easy recipe. I'm not a cumin fan, so I only added 1 teaspoon. It was still a little too much cumin flavor for me, but that's just my own taste. The recipe is very good! So easy to make and customize, why haven't I made hummus before?

This is a great basic recipe that can be modified to your heart's content.  I added an oven roasted red peppers and two roasted jalapenos for some kick.  Best hummus I have ever made.  A definite keeper.

This recipe lacks lemon- I added 2-3 tablespoons. (From a bottle, still extra easy!) It was also missing something without the tehina, so I added 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds. Overall, good base recipe.

I only gave it a 4 star because without the tahini, you miss out on that tang. I only made it without tahini because I didn't have any. I added lemon juice and tripled the recipe for a party. I also added a lot more oil! I used my blendtec so it got really creamy with all the oil and blending. YUMMY

This was great! My boyfriend said he never tasted such flavorful hummus.  I doubled the recipe since we love hummus. 2 cans of garbanzo beans. 1 clove a garlic... it went along way! 4 teaspoons of cummin. 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil. and I only added one extra thing. 5 tbsp of lemon juice to give it some zest!

My first time having & making hummus...if this is all that's to it, YUMMY!  I did adhere to some comments and halved the cumin; also used 1.5 teasp jarred garlic.  Next time I'll try the tahini or sesame oil and compare.  Overall, very good.  One question; how long can I refrigerate?

I made this with the following changes: Only 1/2 tsp of cumin, and I added about a cup of sun dried tomatoes I lightly sauteed in the herbed oil it came in (BJ's brand, Berkley and jensen imported from Italy..which are THE BEST I have ever had! I couldn't believe it was their brand..LOL) then put the tomatoes and the oil in  the food processor and added the difference w/olive oil. This was sooo good!  I tried some w/tahini and just don't like the flavor of it...so this one was great! :)  I also added juice of 1/2 a lemon...and a bit of water only because I forgot to save the juice from the chick peas which I would definitely add next time to make it a bit softer.

Delicious and easy!  Took the advice from a few other reviews and added 1 tbs of crushed red pepper, and only 1 tsp of cumin. Also added slightly more olive oil.  Will definitely make again!

This tasted nothing like any hummus I'd ever tasted.  I'm pretty sure there was entirely too much cumin in this recipe! I followed the directions exactly, and what resulted was a waste of a can of garbanzo beans. I tried to "doctor it up" and tone down the flavor of the cumin, but it was really no good.  I would recommend using a different recipe all together.

Like the title says, this recipe is extra easy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it is a little bland. After tasting it, I added a few drops of sesame oil.  I am going to try it again, but next time I am going to add Serrano chilies and cilantro, or maybe sun dried tomatoes.

This was a GREAT recipe to base my own version. I tweaked, but only a tiny bit by adding a second clove of garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice and paprika. I can't wait to do a roasted red pepper version and an olive version. :) THANKS!

Good Hummus, but it needs something. I added lemon juice and wished for tahini. It was excellent!

I am glad I found this. I have seen Hummus on foodnetwork but didnt know what it was. I have told to use this instead of a mayonaise or other fatening things. I bought several cans of the beans but didnt know what to do with them. This gives me lots of ideas thank you.

Followed other suggestions, cut cumin in 1/2, added 1TBS lemon juice and a dash of basil.  Thought it would be for my lunch tomorrow but my daughter has already claimed 1/2 for her lunch and the rest of the family is eating from mine!

Great and easy. I halved the garbanzo beans, added only one clove of garlic, dash of salt, and lime juice (I didn't have any lemon). Then I toasted some pine nuts and added those. Tastes great! Can't wait to serve it! Thanks!

I just got done making this, and had to get on to rate it. I am fairly new to hummus, as I am slowly changing my eating habits to lose weight. looking for low fat, low calorie ways to dip my veggies, crackers and chips in. I did follow some reccomendations of other reviewers. I added some lemon juice, cut down cumin , and added some basil. OMG this was fantastic, I could hardly stop from taste testing it.again and again, and again. Even as I am typing this the flavor still lingers, tantalizing my mouth. Which I think will help because the flavor will keep reminding me I had a snack, and it is staying with you. Thanks so much for posting will be making this often

Awesome starter recipe for a tahini-free hummus.  I tend to add more spices (whatever I'm feeling at the time) as well as a tablespoon of lemon juice, a little more garlic and an extra tablespoon of sesame oil along with the olive oil.  More fat, but gives it that sesame taste.  Unless you don't like that sesame taste and that's why you're making a tahini-free hummus...

I used low sodium garbanzo beans and added 1.5 tsp of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper and 1 T of onion powder. Very good sesame free hummus that is lower fat and sodium than regular hummus.  Definitely a recipe to keep!

it is 100 % extra easy. i recently went to a fancy restaurant and ordered hummus. it was served with flat bread and apples. i love this recipe with a side of sliced apples and for a much less price than my fancy restaurant experience. Great easy hummus for a quick fancy snack!!

This was wonderful! I'm not a big fan of tahini, so it was perfect and easy to play around with! I added lemon...delicious!

Wow!!! Beyond easy and so yummy!!! I also added a quick squeeze of lime and some paprika and just the smallest drizzle of honey. I have made this several times now and it's just as enjoyable the last time as it was the first. My husband loves this. In fact, I'm making some tonite! Thanks for this great recipe!

YUMMY! Very easy, I found I had to use MOST of the reserved liquid so the blender would actually puree the chickpeas... I have made this recipe twice, and the second time I went and got tahini (found in the peanut butter isle of Whole foods) and it did make a little difference. I sprinkles with some of the same spices I used for when I make dipping oil for bread and YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY with warm pita bread!

I cut back to 1 tsp plus a dash of cumin as someone suggested. For those who thought this recipe was bland, I served with cracked-pepper/olive oil triscuits and the rosemary/olive oil triscuits which added lots of extra flavor. But I thought it tasted great all on its own - I must not be a hummus snob... Thanks for sharing this recipe! I will never buy $5 8 oz containers of hummus again : )

Yummy - the kids and I really liked this. Usually I make with Tahini, but because I was out I tried this version. Added some lemon juice and extra garlic and reduced the cumin some.

Tried this one because it was tahini-free and was disappointed.  Not much flavor and a weird canned-bean aftertaste.

This was very easy to make. I took some of the readers suggestions and added 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 2 cloves of garlic, and only 1 tsp. of cumin. Then sprinkled Paprika on the top.

This is so bland as is... maybe hummus just isn't the same without tahini, or maybe some lemon juice or pepper flakes would be enough to help it, I don't know. As is, it's like baby food - all you taste is mashed-up chickpeas, and guess what? Chickpeas don't have much flavor. Also, the amount of olive oil listed is not nearly enough.

It was the best I've had yet.  I used more ev olive oil than reserved liquid and added moist sun dried tomatoes, to taste, in food processor and some chopped on top.  Will also try a little lemon juice next time.  Very good, thanks.

This was very good, but I couldn't get the consistency quite right with my blender.  As suggested, I added some sun dried tomatoes (2 teaspoons) and a few splashes of lemon juice.

This is a good base recipe, especially if you don't keep tahini on hand. A lower fat version is always nice too! I like my hummus thick, so I used very little of the reserved bean liquid. I used A LOT of fresh lemon juice, probably 2 Tbsp. I also used A LOT of garlic, the minced bottled variety, probably 3 Tbsp. I started with 1 tsp cumin and after adding more to taste, probably 2-2 1/2 tsp total. I used sea salt, and added slightly more than the 1/2 tsp called for. At the end, I added a little paprika and ground red pepper. So much better, cheaper, and healthier than store bought! I'll never buy it again :)

This recipe lived up to its name.  I thought the recipe as written was a bit bland, so I added a few drops of sesame oil per another reviewer's suggestion, and then added more cumin, salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.  I love garlic so I used 3 cloves.  I will use this as my base recipe from now on!

Pretty good, although I did miss the flavor of the tahini.  I think I'll double the garlic and cut the cumin by half next time, just due to my preferences.

I've only tried store bought hummus and I prefer this recipe over those.  It was really easy to make.  I added some chili powder and lemon juice. I also sautéed the crushed garlic in olive oil.  It has turned out great the three times I've made it so far.  I use a blender and making 3 cans at a time makes it easier to blend.  I keep some at home and my husband takes some to keep at work.  Great recipe!

based on other suggestions.  I doubled the garlic, halved the cumin, added a tsp of lemon juice and 1 tbsp sesame oil.  I needed to use more olive oil than stated to get the right consistancy.

Was looking for an appetizer to bring to dinner with a guest who has special, heart-related diet restrictions.  Used lower-sodium garbanzos, only 1/2 T olive oil, kosher salt, and added both lemon juice and a pinch of ancho chili powder.  Will serve with veggies...  So easy and good!

Was bland on its own so I added paprika and about a tablespoon of lemon juice and it was pretty good after that

Delicious! I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil until the garlic got slightly browned to bring out the best of the garlic aromas. Blended as directed, and it was awesome. I served the hummus with Triscuit crackers. A great easy and healthy snack food!

Tastier the second day; after the flavors set in. Also, I added crushed red pepper which spiced it up deliciously.

Yum!  I added an extra clove of garlic (which I probably won't do next time), a tablespoon each of lemon juice and sesame seeds before blending, adding bean juice as needed.  I served the hummus topped with paprika, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a drizzle of olive oil with warm whole wheat pita bread on the side.  Thanks for a great recipe!

AWESOME! This recipe turned out great. It's a little hard to blend it in a blender, but it still comes out great. I added extra garlic and a little lemon juice... PERFECT! Sprinkle a little feta cheese on top too!

With the changes I made based on previous suggestions, it was delicious.  I decreased cumin to 1 tsp, added extra clove garlic, and 3/4 tsp lemon juice.  I had already drained chick pea juice, so I added water until desired consistency. For that sesame taste, next time I may try substituting the olive oil with sesame oil to see how it turns out.

This recipe was a good starting point. I did make additions based on other reviewers. Instead of 2 teaspoons cumin, I used 1 plus 1 teaspoon paprika. Instead of 1 tablespoon olive oil, I used 1/2 tablespoon olive oil plus 1/2 tablespoon toasted sesame oil. I also used the juice of 1 lemon. It turned out great.

Never having hummus before I didn't know what to expect.  This for me, will be an acquired taste.  I was looking for an after school snack for the kids that was actually somewhat healthy.  They weren't too fond of it either.  I did add a small amount of lemon juice.

Great recipe and easy to do.  Good consistency and reminds me of some great hummus that we used to get in a local dive around here.  Much different then most of the store bought hummus I have had.  Will make again for sure.

This is wonderful. I get cravings for hummus and this was easy to make with what I had on hand (no tahini). Next time I'll use the suggestion of a squirt of lemon juice, just to see how it tastes. I love it this way, though!

I really liked this hummus.  It is good with crackers and raw veggies.  My 2 yr old ate a ton of it.  I added lemon pepper, garlic salt and emerils original essence to mine.  Very Tasty.

This is a good basic recipe for hummus. I agree with the other reviewers that lemon juice is a must for this recipe. It also needed the creaminess that comes with adding the tahini, so I added some grilled eggplant while blending in the food processor. Delicious!

this is the first time I've ever made (or had) hummus -- it's great! extremely easy to make and delicious, and it gets even better after sitting in the fridge overnight. even my two-year-old picky eater ate some of it!

Great recipe.  I think 2 tsp. of cumin was a little much, so I will try 1 tsp. next time.  This is great hummus, even my 2 year old liked it!!!
