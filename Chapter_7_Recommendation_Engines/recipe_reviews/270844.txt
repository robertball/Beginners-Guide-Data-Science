Made the recipe exact but we just didn't like it that much. 
Think next time we're going to try some more season!

Perfect as is! Sometimes the simplest and easiest preparations are the best! I had about 1/ 2 lb asparagus and reduced the olive oil to 1 tblsp but still used 1/4 cup water. Cooking time is spot-on. Thanks for the recipe!
