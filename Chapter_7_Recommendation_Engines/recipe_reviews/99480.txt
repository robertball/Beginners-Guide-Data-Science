This did not enhance the spaghetti at all.  No one could tell the difference between this just boiling it.  It did enhance the was the kitchen smelled but that was about it.

This did enhance my spaghetti but my sauce has enough salt. I was thirsty for hours after eating.

Overall, did not find that this enhanced the flavor of the food.  It did add on extra calories and sodium.  Sorry this was not for us.  Thanks for the post.

Having tried his other recipes I had to look up more and found this. If you follow the directions and shut the heat off and let it sit, it works swell for a slight hint of flavor. If you just boil it you don't notice it so much. I have found out if you use less water (not more spices) it gives more flavor to the pasta.
Use 1/2 gallon of water and place pasta in the water when it is cold. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat, let it sit 8 Min. WOW!!

We had leftovers last night.  I had chicken and my husband wanted the homemade spaghetti sauce.  So I cooked some angelhair for him, using this method.  With the sauce, I don't think there was a noticeable difference in flavor.  But I decided to indulge in a little pasta with butter & parmesan and could taste a subtle flavor.  I do the same thing by adding marinara sauce to the pasta water.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used linguine noodles instead of spaghetti.  I didn't find it all that different from having plain spaghetti.

This was a change but I didn't notice it unless I ate the spaghetti noodle by itself.  Next time I will cook it the old fashion way just so I don't have to take the time to dump the extra stuff in.

I didn't think this changed the taste of the spaghetti at all.  I didn't rinse the spaghetti either.  Glad I tried it though.

Good for pasta aglio e olio...A waste for anything using a sauce.  Thanks, will use for my olive oil based pasta dishes.
UPDATE: Used this in Sausage & Broccoli cavatelli and it really added to the flavor.  Since I use chicken broth as the "sauce" I used chicken broth for the pasta too.  Much better!

Did not make a difference to us.  We use a little olive oil, which will float to the top during cooking but the noodles won't stick and a couple cloves of garlic which we throw away after the cooking.

To be honest, this didn't taste very much different to me than regular boiled spaghetti. I used beef bouillion granules because we didn't have the cubes, and doubled the amount, and it still didn't taste very different! So much for enhanced.

We really didn't notice a difference with this. I used whole-grain spaghetti (had to let it sit a minute longer), vegetable bouillon, and three large crushed garlic cloves (I don't have garlic powder), and I used less water than called for, but still no noticeable flavor. Thanks, anyway.

I've pretty much started to use this idea with all of my pasta recipes. (Vary the boullion and seasonings  depending on the dish, of course.)
I also love this exactly  as stated, with butter... YUM. Thanks, Face.

Hmmm.. I tried this yesterday and I can't say that there is much of a difference, although I'm ashamed to admit that I forgot to add the garlic salt.. However I don't think that made much of a difference.. Going to try it again tonight though, but add more garlic.

This very similar to a method I saw Frank Pellegrino (co-owner of Rao's Restaurant in N.Y.) use once. He said all his pasta dishes were cooked w/ the "segreto" method. He left the pasta a little undercooked, drained it & then added a couple of tbp. of whatever sauce the pasta was to be served in, to the drained pasta...putting it back on the heat & cooking it for a few minutes more. He said that allows the pasta to absorb just a bit of the flavors from the sauce. Anyway, back to this recipe, I used chicken cubes instead of beef & greatly decreased the paprika. Very good jumpstart to my pasta dish...thanks!

This had a beautiful color but I really couldn't tell it was "enhanced". I only used half the water called for. I didn't use salt as the bouillon cubes had plenty. Thanks, Whats His Face for posting this so we could try something different.

We eat A LOT of pasta in our household and this really did make the spaghetti taste so much better! We have used bouillon in the water before but adding in the paprika and garlic powder really made it different, in a good way! We will definitely be making pasta this way from now on! One thing we did have to different though - had to let the pasta cook for 8 minutes then sit covered for 4 minutes. After only 4 minutes of cooking it was still very tough. That's the only change though. Thanks!

What a great way to perk up your spaghetti. I didn't use paprika because I didn't have it and I cooked my noodles all the way, but the flavor was wonderful. For those of you who expect a big difference, don't, because like the name of the recipe it only enhances it. It definitely adds a kick to the same old boring spaghetti. My bf who doesn't really like spaghetti loves it now.

I really like this.  I have several kids who don't like spaghetti sauce and just eat the noodles so they thought it tasted great.  It was easy and the flavor was nice so I'm not sure what the complaints are about.  Sure, the sauce covers up the taste but did you really expect it to stick out that much??  Anyhow, I liked the cook time.  Easy to remember.  I will probably do this from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband said it was delicious although he couldnt tell a difference from the usual spaghetti I make. I could tell a slight difference. It was easy because I had all the ingredients in my pantry. I will make again.

I usually "enhance" my pastas by stirring in a spoonful of whatever sauce I'm using (after draining the pasta of course). I did like Bill's idea and it worked very well. I didn't measure anything though, so I'm guessing I had less water and more salt. So, I suggest: adjust to taste and don't dare eat plain old spaghetti ever again!

Having tried his other recipes I just had to try this. It adds a hint of flavor to the spaghetti but it is not overpowering at all, it was quite enjoyable. So much so that after trying it with spaghetti I made it with macaroni in my goulash. This too came out quite good. I haven't tried it yet, but I don't see why it wouldn't work with chicken, instead of beef, and use it in a chicken salad.

Okay. That's about all I can say. I think the concept is good, but the taste was not so profound. When you add red sauce or any type of heavy based pasta sauce to this it just knocks out the flavoar. Equally, the flavor of the pasta is not that intense even when eaten alone. Maybe tossing the pasta w/ fresh garlic or herbs would help. Do't know if I will make again. Not bad but not good either - just bland.

I really thought this did add just a hint of flavor and made everything more tasty.  My kids seemed more inclined to eat just the spaghetti without the sauce more than they usual.

A brilliant and ideal way to cook pasta, especially when using some of the cooking water to enhance or stretch a sauce.  If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  Thanks, WHATS HIS FACE, you done good!!!

I, like a lot of people, often add some bouillon to the pasta water, but the paprika and garlic in this recipe really make it something else. We loved the really subtle flavor it gave the spaghetti. Thanks so much!

This is an awful lot of spice to use to achieve salty spaghetti. From now on I will stick to just throwing in a beef bouillon if I want a little flavor. I felt like this was a waste of ingredients. Appreciate the idea, though.

Less water more seasonings. No salt. Make sure to let it sit and soak in flavors after cooking. DO NOT rinse, or else the flavor goes away. I let it sit for 10 minutes.

I liked it very much.  I used whole wheat noodles and I didn't rinse the noodles either.  I just scooped out and let drip for a minute.  This did not make the sauce watery at all.

Although I wasn't that fond of this recipe, I give it 5 stars because my husband loved it.  He told me that it was almost as good as his moms which is a HUGE compliment because he is critical of almost everything I make.  This is the first time he really liked what I made.  To me, though, it had an odd taste to it.  I can see how some would like it though.

Excellent, although I am a wimp and don't use the full amount of paprika. I have used this recipe with chicken cubes as well with chicken dishes. Thanks!
