This was so good and really easy!  I used boneless country style ribs and they were so tender.  Will definitly make this again.

Because others mentioned the ribs were bland, I used chicken stock instead of water otherwise used the rest of the ingredients as listed. The ribs were delicious and very tender and although my husband liked them, thought they were bland. I will make again but will experiment with adding ingredients to make them more flavorful, perhaps a little spicy.

This was extremely yummy! Everybody LOVED it!! The dog drooled over the bones, too! My only complaint (if you could call it that) is that it was a tad too bland. Otherwise, PERFECT!!!
I almost got killed browning it, though. I used a few substitutions, such as butter for browning, real garlic instead of garlic powder, and so on!

Not to be a hater but I agree with a earlier review of it being bland.  I followed the recipe as shown.

Love it! Best recipe for ribs. Meat comes out so tender. Even my hubby, who doesn't like ribs loves this!

when I transferred this recipe to the shopping list it changed Chinese vinegar to Chinese black vinegar.  I don't know what either of these are so I reduce water by 1/4 cup and used 1/4 rice vinegar and 1/4 soy sauce.  This was pretty good for ribs that have not been grilled but I don't think I will make them again.
