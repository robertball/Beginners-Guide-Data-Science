Great recipe. Didn't really make any changes.  The recipe called for an onion. I like onions so I used a larger onion.  I didn't use  a full two tbs of butter topping the ramikins prior to baking as I like to watch the fat and calories. I'm sure a full two tbs of butter would taste great though.  This is particularly a great recipe using canned clams and you need a quickie dish.  I will definitely make this again.

I hate to leave a bad review but my husband and I did not care for this.  Too much onion, too many herbs and not enough clams.  I don't know how this could possibly yield 4 servings even as an appetizer.

Added 3 slices cooked, chopped turkey bacon & 1 Tablespoon of hot sauce (Tabasco). After baking, topped with Parmesan cheese - AWESOME!!  Served as appetizer for pool party/cookout.

This was a good way to use up the can of chopped clams I had.  My husband, who swore the only clams he likes are when they're in clam chowder, smelled it cooking and stole a bite or two when it was done. He said it was good.  Instead of using oil, I chopped up a piece of thick pepper bacon and then fried 1/4 of an onion (chopped) with it.  I just couldn't see adding a whole onion to that little can of clams.  Also, since I'm on a low-carb diet, I used parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used powdered (which just isn't the same!) I also used rosemary instead of thyme 'cause that's all I had.  It only filled two ramekins, but that may be because I didn't use the amount of onion called for, I drained some of the clam juice, and I only used 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese for the bread crumbs.  It was pretty good, but I don't see myself making it again unless I happen to have chopped clams on hand.

This is a great recipe!  I baked it in one dish though and served it with sea salt melba toast rounds.  I always make too many appetizers, so I had some leftovers that I used to stuff button mushrooms and baked at 350 for about 15 minutes....YUM!!!!!

Very good. I don't like thyme, so I omitted that. Next time I would used 1/2 an onion, a whole onion was just a little too much. And I would probably pick up some clam shells and stuff them. This was a fast and easy recipe, canned clams are on sale often, good value.

Serving size was insanely tiny.  The taste was good, but the proportion of bread crumbs to clams was way off. If I were to do this again, I'd halve the bread crumbs and triple the clams.  I might also make patties and bake them rather than using the ramekins.

Very easy and even more tasty. Based on other reviews, I cut the onions down to 1/2 cup. Made these for my husband as an appetizer while he was grilling and he loved them.

I am not sure how in the world this recipe turned out to be a success.

It was just me and I wanted something quick and easy for dinner.  I had everything (I thought) on hand and decided to give it a go. After adding clams and seasoning  (thyme, dill, parsley and Old Bay,  cracked pepper) I realized I only had about half the breadcrumbs. I'm out of bread, crackers, etc so I got creative - I added several tablespoons of instant potatoes.  Once I had the right consistency, I topped it with some Parmesan, baked it for about 20 min and broiled the top for about 5 min.

This was much better than it should have been. It definitely reminded me of stuffed clams, though it is a bit salty. Next time I'll cut back on the clam juice and add white wine (and make sure I have enough breadcrumbs). This would be great as a light supper with salad and fresh bread or on a buffet table with crackers and crudite. It's probably not a 5 star recipe but I'm giving myself a pat on the back for just surviving.

Forget the canned clams and the dried spices.  Take the little additional effort and use fresh clams (just steam them until the shells open, remove the clams from the shells, let cool, split the shells to serve in, chop the clams in 4-5 pieces).
Use fresh oregano, fresh basil, fresh shallots.  If you want to make the reciepe a little easier, use good, seasoned packaged bread crumbs.
Squeeze a little fresh lemon juice and a small amount of fresh grated Romano cheese on top of each clam.

I had an extra can of clams that I wanted to use up. I was not sure about this recipe at first, but it was pretty good. The only changes I made was that I used half an onion, 1 tspn of fresh oregano and 1 tspn of fresh thyme and threw in some red pepper flakes with the onion and garlic. I did not use butter at all and put shredded parmesan on top before baking. You really can only get two modest servings out of this and should probably serve with a side to make it a full meal. Or it might make a nice clam-burger. In any case, it was a pretty easy and quick way to use up my clams!

This recipe was okay. It did not taste bad at all. I did feel it was too dry/crumbly for me.
