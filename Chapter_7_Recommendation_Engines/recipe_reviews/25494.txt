I loved this recipe! I made these for a large group and it was the first time I made stuffed mushrooms in my life.  Someone asked me what store I bought them from because they tasted too good to be homemade??? Anyway, an important note for those going to make this.  #1 - Use REAL bacon bits, NOT the crunchy bacon flavored salad toppings, because that is all I had and the bacon flavor was a little too strong that way. #2, the recipe takes a little more time than it says, but highly worth it - just give yourself some more time.  #3 Also the recipe as listed says that it serves 8 by making 24 mushrooms.  Increase this number, these are so good most of your guests will want to eat more than 3 each.

I really liked this recipe but there are two changes I would make the next time. They seemed to take a longer time to cook in the oven so I finished them in the broiler.  Next time I will use the broiler at less time than the recipe calls for in the oven. It also needed mozzerella cheese added to the top before broiling. The filling was incredible!

This recipe is TO DIE FOR.  I just made these mushrooms for a New Year's Eve party and they were a smashing success.  I got two recipe requests for it, the ultimate compliment.  And the recipe is easy to boot!  Thanks for sharing.

These stuffed mushrooms were a hit on Thanksgiving! I might have used too much butter, because they seemed a bit greasy. Also, try using unsalted butter, or less bacon for this recipe  as it did come out a little too salty for my taste, BUT there were NO leftovers!!

I was looking for a recipe to make seafood baked clams and then I came across this.  I followed this recipe and added fresh chopped clams, 2 cans of minced clams and 2 cans of crabmeat.  It came out delicious.  Thank you!

These were wonderful! I normally try not to make changes to a recipe until I try it once, but I made several changes out of necessity on this one and they turned out well. I didn't have green onion, so I used yellow onion (grated- 1/4c.). I also cut the butter that you drizzle before baking to 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 c. These are very rich, but extremely tasty. This was my first try at stuffed mushrooms and they were easier than expected. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Incredible!!!

I am ALWAYS surfing this site looking for "5" Stars and this is for SURE a keeper.  I made 2 types for New Years, this and a bacon & cream cheese filled and these were gone WAY QUICKER than the cream cheese!!! I cut the lemons in small "drink size" wedges and just dumped them over the plate for people to take and use if they wished.  Like the idea of the hot sauce, I will have to try that nest time.  

Also, I bought jumbo mushrooms for a "dinner" appetizer, but making these for the parties, I used the more "normal" size mushrooms for a finger food and it made about 30!  

Awesome and THANK YOU for sharing!!!!

these are addicting! the added butter (to drizzle) is not necessary. best served with tabasco sauce- just like with baked clams.

This was so easy to make. i didn't change anything in this recipe and it came out really well. i also had to cook them longer in the oven as stated by previous reveiwers though and i used real bacon bits as advised by another reveiwer. they came out great.

I had to cut back on the butter in this recipe quite a bit to fit my weight loss plan.  I cooked the chopped mushroom stems in only 1 tablespoon of butter, and instead of drizzling the stuffed mushrooms with butter, I sprayed them with butter-flavored cooking spray.  I also used panko instead of seasoned bread crumbs and toasted them before adding them to the mix.  These were quite good, however the clam flavor was very mild.  I think I'd like these clammier.  Maybe it was the brand of clams I purchased.  If I ever get skinny, I'd like to make these again with more butter.  Thanks for the post, DEBNJAMES, these were good.

Tiny salad shrimp can also be used, either instead of the clams or with them...please use real bacon instead of the bacon bits, it really does make a difference..Making the mixture several hours ahead helps to blend the flavors..sprinkle with a little paprika just before baking

This is by far the best new recipe I have tried in a LONG time.  I could happily eat these every day for the rest of my life.  I made them exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  The flavors blend perfectly together.  Thank you thank you thank you!

This was excellent. I did not drizzle the butter on top as suggested by others and I used bacon, not bacon bits of any kind. I used (2) 6.5 ounce cans of clams for a total of 13 ounces and it filled a lot of mushrooms. I used regular size mushrooms. I also put mozzerella cheese on tops and broiled for few minutes. I highly recommend adding the mozzerella cheese .

I'm definitely keeping this recipe.  Mushrooms got great reviews at our Thanksgiving potluck.  I didn't use the 1/2 c. butter over the mushrooms and used real bacon as others suggested.  Thanks!

I rated this 4 stars because it was good. Simply enough. However, I don't think I'd make again. Don't get me wrong - I ate my fair share! I made exactly as stated; with the exception of pouring a little white wine in the bottom of the pan to keep them from sticking. I think the salt in the Bacon Bits (the real thing, as reviewed by another rater) was overpowering to the recipe. Maybe just using less of it would be enough to improve on the dish; just enough to give the bacon flavor without overpowering. That is really the only reason I can't rate it a 5 - it was salty! Thanks for submitting this!

These were tasty & well received this Thanksgiving.  I used 22 cremini mushrooms and had plenty of stuffing left over, buy a few extras.  I used less butter, and a dash of black truffle oil to saute.  I also skipped the butter drizzle at the end.  I agree with other reviewers, the bacon really overpowers the clam.  I would halve it, or less.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, I enjoyed trying this.

Very tasty mushrooms, only thing I would change is to cook the mushrooms on a rack so the excess butter could drag away. We used less butter than the recipe called for and still had the mushrooms swimming in butter at the end. Took them to a friend's party and they were very well received.

Was looking for quick and easy recipe and was lucky enough to find this one.  I have never made stuffed mushrooms and now I will have no excuse.

Excellent! Followed recipe exactly except I drizzled less butter over mushrooms. Everyone loved them. I was asked for the recipe and guests said "tasted like a restaurant chef made them". I can mess up recipes because I'm not a great cook, but this recipe is easy and straight forward.

Made this one tonight after driving to the store simply to buy the ingredients I still needed. SO good and smells AmaZing. Like some of the others, I did not add additional butter on top since it seemed rich enough and it still tasted awesome. I ended up using much less butter than what the recipe called for. I do also have to agree that the bacon overpowers the clam flavor even though I used less of that also. Still delicious though. Tried this recipe on a group of guys and they asked for the recipe! Will definitely fix again.

These are great.  Use real bacon instead of bits, unless you go for that kind of thing.  Otherwise, these were great as written!

This was very yummy! I did everything as written, only I did not drizzle the extra butter on top. It still came out great! I think it could use a bit more cook time, or maybe a slightly higher oven temp. Thanks!

The filling on this was absolutely delicious. 

A few slight changes I would make to the recipe next time I cook it:

*Some of the mixture got stuck to the bottom of the pan so I would use a lower temperature (perhaps medium low) next time
*The mixture didn't easily fit in a small sauce pan so I ended up using a medium
*I substituted a three cheese blend containing romano, for romano and it worked fine, so I will probably do this again next time
*There was too much mixture to fit into 24 mushrooms. I'd try an even 30 next time.
*There was a bit much melted butter at the end. I'll probably cut in half next time.

Overall, still a very delicious recipe.

I made the recipe as stated, and it was very good.   Next time I make it, I may leave out the bacon.   This is definitely a keeper.

this recipe is great. made them last night and they disappeared right before my eyes. my most strongest critics said these were my new go to mushrooms for the holidays. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge success. I made 2 large boxes of mushrooms that made 40  with this recipe and I stuck to the recipe and just added some mozzerella cheese as the final topping also when mixing the filling i sopped up the extra butter from the mixture. This time i only used half the butter so i diddnt have to sop any of it up. if you like stuffed mushrooms you will love this recipe. it is so simple and so delicious. thank you for the posting. i give this recipe 10+ stars. dont believe me try it youself. next time i might even tweak it a little to make them on the spicy side cause thats how i roll. enjoy i know you will. oh yeah im an amatuer chefwannabe but love trying new things and this is a sure fire masterpiece. The cut up lemon on the the side is great with this recipe
