Yes this is an amazing recipe.  I cook at a Hospice facility and I get raves from patients and family.I just add 5 eggs and it is a little firmer.  I take this to neighbors when there is a person who needs to feel loved.

Delicious custard.  I did use 5 eggs so it would set better.  I love it covered with nutmeg.  Pure comfort food.

Made according to directions, but custard had a hard time setting up.  Continued to bake longer, but it never really set like any other custard I've made.

I baked this in individual baking dishes, each of which held about a cup and a half, which I placed on a large baking pan with enough water in it to cover the bottom of the dishes to about a half inch. The individual servings made a deeper custard than what would have been in the round pan called for in the recipe. The custard set to a jello consistency, which is how we like it, in about 50 minutes, and it tasted perfectly wonderful-just like the custard my Grandma used to make. I did use the suggested five eggs rather than four.

This is custard just like my Mom used to make.  It is not meant to be a 'hard set' custard. When it is done it will still appear to be soft.  The key is the knife test.  When it comes out clean it is done.  Brings back memories of childhood!  My whole family loves this recipe.

Hubby just loved this. It was just sweet enough and made a nice amount. It took much longer to bake, but that was probably because I didn't heat the milk enough. The benefit of not using very hot milk is you don't have to worry about it curdling when you mix it into the eggs, but the trade-off is the longer bake time.

I made this custard.  It was easy BUT i wish i read the reviews first and added an extra egg.  Took a long time to set up. It was a little watery but still delicious.

Loved it.  5 eggs is key to a firmer texture. Not too sweet, great with nutmeg!

Loved it.  Just like old time custard.  Not a firm set like custard for a pie, it was perfect.  Will make this again.

Did not taste sweet enough, had to add a little honey for a topping in dessert bowl.  I had to bake about 1 1/2 hours before this was set.
