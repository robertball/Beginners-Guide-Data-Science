Very good recipe! I did make some changes though. I used fresh red pepper instead of the jarred peppers and I also added 2 or 3 Tablespoons of finely chopped red onion. Would be a great salad to bring to a picnic or BBQ, tastes great chilled or at room temperature.

This was really great and refreshing. I added a little pasta I had leftover and used a little more oil and vinegar than what was called for. It was tasty!

Super simple, fast and tasty. Added more balsamic and added lots of salt & pepper but otherwise made a originally submitted. My entire family asked for the recipe!

I made this for the labor day picnic. This is such a wonderful side dish. I agree that extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar is needed. What a healthy dish to serve when summer's fresh vegetables are coming to an end. This is a dish I will continue to use. Fantastic!!!

Thought this was a good recipe, but thought it was missing something also.  I did a few modifications and added some fresh cilantro and some lime juice (my taste buds needed a little pep) grilled up some fish(I like my meat) and made it into a fish taco.yummy! I think I might try it in a Pita with some Tzatziki sauce tomorrow. All in all, its a good summer recipe...and wicked healthy.

This salad sounded great, looked wonderful, but ended up being a bit bland in taste. A bit of a let down. Family said it was not a "make again" recipe for them and I agreed.  I think the recipe could be played with a lot to come up with something really good, but it does need a lot of work.  If you prefer bland food though, then you might like this.

Excellent, and won me rave reviews from my boyfriend!  I didn't BBQ the corn, but it was still wonderful.

This is good and pretty refreshing but something is missing. I haven't decided what is missing yet. Many guests said it would have been better hot. Humm?  I guess I will try it again and see if I can improve.

Very good!  I didn't use as many basil leaves as the recipe called for and think I'm glad I didn't.  I might have felt the basil was a little overpowering if I had.  I added the extra oil and vinegar as other reviewers suggested and a little red onion also.  I will make again.

Made this as a side dish with dinner and it was great and light for summer time.  I grilled the asparagus rather than boil it since I had to grill the corn anyway.  Easier, more flavorful and less clean up!  Added a little extra balsamic vinegar.

This was great! I doubled everything, and added an extra tablespoon each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, based on other reviews.  Everyone loved it. I think it would be great as well if the basil were swapped out with any other favorite herb. Thanks for a new addition to our summer repertoire!

This salad was delicious. For my Fourth of July dinner it was perfect to eat outside by the grill. I loved the taste the corn brought after grilling it and the balsamic vinegar brought out the sweetness of the vegetables.

I made this with left over corn on the cob and asparagus that I had grilled the night before. Great alternative to just heating up left overs!

I didn’t have the peppers so maybe that was the problem but I didn’t especially like this. I’m not looking forward to eating the leftovers and I normally love asparagus. I don’t understand why you boil asparagus and grill the corn. I think it’s be better if you grill both. Won’t make again. I’d rather eat grilled corn on the cob and roasted asparagus.

I had leftover boiled corn, grilled asparagus and a red pepper and found this recipe.  I added diced red onion, as previously recommended and it turned leftovers into a whole new side dish.

This is an excellent salad! It is so bright and fresh. If the corn you use is nice and sweet, it's out of this world!
