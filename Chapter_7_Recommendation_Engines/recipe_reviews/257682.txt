This is a great sauce that could be used for many different things. After tasting it as written I did feel it needed tweaked a bit. I started by adding more lime juice and salt and then ended up adding more cilantro too. This is  a great recipe and one that is easily adaptable to suit your own individual tastes.

Makes a lot and tasted great..  I'll add a few more peppers to spice it up some next time.

This was soooo good!  It was my first time to make something with tomatillos, so easy and tasty!
I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted with plain yogurt.  It was delicious and now I have a  
 go-to,  low-cal dip recipe.  I think that it will be great on fried eggs & greens/onions.  I was even thinking of adding it to a chicken alfredo casserole for a different twist.  The heat was just right too.
