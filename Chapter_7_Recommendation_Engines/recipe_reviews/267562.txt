This recipe raises the bar on brunch menus. I used 2 leftover egg yolks from another recipe and a whole egg. I also dressed it like I do cheeseburgers, adding mustard and pickled jalapenos.
I didn’t have leftover bacon or hamburgers so I cooked the bacon, then the burger, then the omelet, all in the same pan. Wow! It was awesome. Just add a side of flapjacks and you’re good to go for your brunch table. Thank you for the recipe.
