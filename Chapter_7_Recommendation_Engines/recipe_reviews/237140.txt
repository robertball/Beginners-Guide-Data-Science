Wow! I've been making french toast for years and thought I was doing it right..."if it ain't broke don't fix it". I never knew about a "classic restaurant method". I just did it the way my Mom and Grandma taught me and never would have thought to lightly fry and place it in the oven. Since I love french toast I had to give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised. This came out crisp, light, fluffy and just plain delicious. I topped it with a dusting of powdered sugar and  REAL maple syrup. It was perfect served with fresh fruit and OJ! Thanks for a great recipe Chef John and an update on a truly classic breakfast favorite!

Made this for family breakfast and it was really good. I didn't have French bread on hand, but used a thicker sliced bread. The cinnamon and all spice give a nice flavor. I added a very small amount of powered sugar to the mixture. It was nice to put the slices in the oven as they were fried and also kept them nice and hot until all were complete so we could sit down and enjoy together. I will make these again, everyone loved then!

Still awesome! Only edit is to double the mixture if your using "country" type wider slices or thick cuts. I chopped up some apples and coated w allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin spice and a little honey. Baked at 350 for 20-30 and used as topping MMM! Also, out of of powdered sugar so put granulated sugar into the blender. Instant powdered (-: Huge fan of Chef John! He's my go-to for any recipe

Nothing fancy about this recipe.  It is the all around basic Frech Toast Recipe, except the unnecessarily added allspice.  

The real secret to French Toast is using stale bread (aka "Day Old") to soak up the egg mixture.

French toast is OK, but I think what I don't like about it is the custard-y texture.  This recipe is crisp and yummy!  Great flavors.  Cooking on the stove and then crisping in the oven is wonderful.  Also helps to make sure that everyone is eating a hot meal together.  Made it for "breakfast for dinner" tonight.  Definitely will be something we make again---for breakfast/brunch/dinner.  Yum!!!

Who knew I was making French Toast wrong all of these years????!!!  I will never make French Toast another way!  Delicious, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Absolutely delicious!  Even my kids who are only 5, 6 and 7 commented that these were way better than the other way I make them.  Says a lot when kids notice the difference. Thank you for a great recipe!

I didn't have thick bread, so I used regular instead.  Had in oven only ten minutes at 375*.  Very good flavor and crisp outer layer.  So easy and nice to be able to make other breakfast food while it was in the oven.  Thank you

Who knew I was making Restaurant Style French Toast all these years...Although, I add just a touch of sugar to make it brown more evenly and I don't use the allspice in mine as no one cares for it...

This time I used the spices..I LOVE the addition of the AllSpice..what nice touch that adds!
Best French Toast I've ever had and the family loved it, too.  It was crisp on the outside and fluffy, creamy tender on the inside; perfect!  I used only the vanilla for flavoring because I served it with cinnamon sugar apples saut√©ed in a little butter, which was flavor enough.  I rarely ate French toast in the past because I didn't care for the flavor or texture; it was just like bread dipped in raw scrambled egg mixture and fried.  Will definitely make this one again and recommend this recipe to family and friends.  Thank you, Chef John, your recipes have never failed me!

I'll start off by apologizing to Chef John. I wanted to make this when I read the recipe and watched the video. Took a look in my bread box, didn't have any thick bread or the Wheat French Bread as mentioned, all I had was regular bread and some thick frozen waffles, blueberry at that - Moved forward anyway, following the rest of the recipe ingredients to the letter, from the stove top to the oven, sprinkled with Powered Sugar and drizzled with Maple Syrup - The good thing, they turned out great, the family loved them and they are hard to please - Will definitely make these again, but will go to the store first - James

Easy to do. Allspice and bake are the key. Added topping during bake. Banana and walnuts.

My husband & I agree this is the best French toast we‚Äôve ever tasted (& we‚Äôre really old, so we‚Äôve got a lot to compare ??)! Made the recipe as written. The spices had the perfect amount of sweetness, & the time in the oven sealed the deal.

Best French Toast EVER! I didn't have allspice so used freshly grated nutmeg. The aroma coming from the oven was amazing. Hated to eat the last bite, because it meant there was no more.

This really works!  We like it a little more done so we  will add an extra minute or two in the skillet and add a minute or two in the oven. Also, we sliced our bread thick on the diagonal and let it soak up the egg mixture for an hour. Yummy!

Very good! Baking it off gave it the crisp and crunch I like in french toast. No sogginess here! Plus the baking time gives me a chance to make whipped cream.

Very good!! When the recipe says ‚Äúsoak‚Äù, it‚Äôs more of a quick dip if you like the bread fluffy in the middle. You certainly need the baking part to rid some of the moisture. Cooked up the accompaniments while these babies were in the oven. Will make again!

Instead of using Allspice and Cinnamon I used Spekulaas, and used Penzey's Baking Spice in another. All 3 were great I just like using recipes as a guide to play in the kitchen.

This is the way my Mom always made it except that she also added a little sugar and did not use allspice.  We always made sure to have some left over that we used for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  My kids grew up with this also and as adults we still like the PB & J with any that's left over.

Very good...  but no better, really, than the recipes we have tried previously.  I can see where someone who likes well done, firm, dry french toast might like this better though.

Really need to start with thick bread, like the 1" + size referenced. I used regular sliced sourdough and it dried out a bit. Still love the taste and crunch.

This recipe was very easy to make, and I was happy with the texture of the end result.  However, the allspice was a bit too much for my taste.  I think I will keep the method, but tweak the spice ratio.

I do not like French Toast, but my husband loves it...so I was looking for a recipe that didn't put regular bread in milk & egg and grill. This was wonderful! It has turned me onto grown up french toast that my kids will eat! I am now on the journey to try as many french toast recipes I can to see if any can top this one! Next time I make this one I will also make Chef Johns Strawberry compote to put over it!

I like it. I substituted milk for half and half. Added a smudge of nut meg and almond extract.I found cooking them on the stove a bit messy. Instead I skipped the stove and baked them in a convection oven on 390. They came out just as tasty!

I will definitely make French toast this way from now on. The flavor is great (The only change I made was to use only half the amount of allspice). And the second step of baking in the oven makes for a crispier toast, makes the kitchen smell fantastic and ensures everyone can have their breakfast hot and at the same time. I had to use Wonder bread, but this will be even better next time with French bread.

The cooking times need to be reduced, as after 12 minutes in the oven, the custard has been completely destroyed.

I would recommend a stovetop sear and maybe 5 minutes in the oven. Check w/ a thermometer for 155 internal temp.

Otherwise, great recipe! Thanks Chef John!

This was really good. I have been making French toast the old fashioned way as long as I can remember. The baking after frying gives it great texture. I used Texas toast, and passed on the allspice. Kids loved it, so this recipe gets 5 stars

I used crusty bread and it was delicious, I have never considered baked French toast. It was nice to have the family all eat together. 
I did need to double the egg dip as the original amount it was not enough to do a whole loaf of bread. Will make again

This is an excellent recipe.  I used day old french bread and it turned out beautifully.  The toast has a custardy center with a slight crunch to the exterior.  Delicious.

Pro tip: If you have a Great Harvest Bread Company within driving distance, go pick up a loaf of their cinnamon chip bread. Get it unsliced so you can cut your own thick slices for this recipe. I'm he only one in my house who likes French toast so I store it in the freezer and cut a slice or 2 when I need a fix. Divine!

I have been making french toast for years. All I ever did was follow my mothers recipe. After  following Chef Johns recipe I throw my hands up and just said WOW. If mom was still here she would fully agree. This toast was fantastic. The loger in the oven the crisper it gets, 14 min was just fine.
Thanks and have a great  day at the range.

The crispy edges kind of took away from the flavor.  I liked it because I don't like soggy French toast.  Needs more cinnamon.

The "baking" part is genius and I'll continue to do that in future recipes. The mixture was simply not enough & I used THIN slices of day-old, fresh-baked cinnamon bread. Agreed: powder sugar unnecessary. Thanks for allowing me to learn a new technique: baking French toast!

So awesome! I left out the allspice because I didn't have any on hand but other than that followed the recipe. The french toast turned out so good. I have issues with french toast that looks good on the outside but is soggy on the inside and this fixed it perfectly! Browned on the stovetop using a cast iron griddle and then just placed directly onto a baking sheet and into a 400 oven for 13 minutes! I was worried that the bread would continue to brown and possibly burn but  by some sorcery it came out looking the same, except with an amazing texture. Thanks Chef John!!!

Yes Chef John is my go to guy for great recipes.
This was no exception. Using the oven is genius because they all come out hot the same time.  I used Italian bread.
I doubled the batch.  Timing on both pan and oven seemed spot on.  
They came out great.

Have made it twice in the past week with all the wicked weather in the NE.  I always serve it with sausage on the side and real maple syrup.  No allspice for me.

I found medium heat in a cast iron pan was turning my toast slices black way before three minutes per side. Other than that this was lovely. The dipping mix use a higher ratio of milk to eggs than I normally would do, and that with the allspice (which I've never put in French toast before) gave the finished meal a really nice flavor. I'll be trying different heat levels/times for the frying step next attempt, but will use this again.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! 3 minutes per side is way too long on medium heat. Medium-low worked better and about 2-2 1/2 minutes.
Whole family raves about it!

I had about a half a loaf of french bread to use and it was perfect for this recipe.  The recipe was quick  and easy to prepare and I no longer have to worry about soggy french toast. I omitted the allspice. This would be perfect when cooking for a crowd.

4 stars because I think it could still use some work to taste less eggy (could just be my preference though). Baking certainly works well but I'd use only yolks and add some sugar. It also doesn't hurt to add more cinnamon and vanilla extract if the taste isn't strong enough for you.

Love French toast and wanted to see if this really kicked it up a notch.  The ingredients were consistent with what I usually use  but I didn't have  any allspice so I went ahead without it.  I followed the recipe  as directed and it was the best French Toast I've ever made! My granddaughter loved it! I'll make it this way from now on!

Other than popping in the oven to keep warm, this is the same recipe I've been using since I was kid.  Since I had some left over, I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  This helps the batter be very thick.  I also used way more butter in frying  these.  Instead of putting the cinnamon in with the egg mixture, I sprinkle the cinnamon generously on one side while cooking.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of sugar to the mix.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! I have tried to make French toast sooo many times but it never seemed right. I made this this morning just as described just added some nutmeg, splash of almond extract and tsp of sugar and it was excellent. I always wondered why it never seemed just right and was always soggy in the middle like it was not completely cooked! Thank you for sharing!

Great base recipe, even without putting it in the oven (which I didn't have time for)!  I can only imagine that cooking it as directed would improve it even further, and I'll plan to do that next time.  Proportions of egg/milk/vanilla/spices are spot-on!

I used thick slices of baguette instead of french bread. The result was good, but I think you need to make more mixture to soak all the bread. I served it for breakfast with blackberries and real maple syrup. My husband loved it!

This was really great. I haven't made French Toast in years and really had no desire to. Always seemed too custard like and not a lot of flavor. But I decided I would give this a try. It was very easy, ingredients were perfect, and baking to finish was the real secret. Crisp, light and excellent flavor. I made a few extra and stored in the fridge to bake to finish in a couple of days. I can highly recommend this, great recipe!

Did this recipe last week, it's truly the best french toast I ever had!!! Great recipe! Guests  loved it too!!!!Does  a difference  to put them in the oven for 10-15 minutes and in the meantime, you can clean the dishes and enjoy your breakfast with your guests!!!

This makes french toast for breakfast for a crowd much easier.  The recipe is the same my family has used for years, but with the addition of nutmeg.  Great idea, and delicious results.

I used  coconut creamer instead of milk because of a lactose intolerance and it was what I had. It was still wonderful.

So glad I found this.  Popping it in the oven has been the missing method all these years.  I omitted the Allspice, but otherwise followed the directions and it turned out fantastic.

Did not use AllSpice  because I didn't have any and I don't know what it is.  I will say that we liked this a lot without the missing spice and that I will get some allspice just to kick it up a notch.

We loved this.  I will never make french toast the old way again.  I had a lot of medium  peppers and thought why not.  I added them to my egg mixture as well as the cinnamon and salt and it was great!  Crispy on the outside and light inside.  Wonderful recipe as expected as all are from Chef John.

This was amazing! My daughter brought a large round golden raisin loaf over for our Father's Day Brunch. We cut it in 1" slices and the large pieces made a lovely presentation when cut in half and plated. Starting them in the pan gave them a lovely golden appearance, finishing them in the oven really cooks them through. I love the fact I can serve everyone together! I tripled the milk mixture, skipped the allspice and added a couple teaspoons of sugar. Served with a fresh strawberry syrup, real maple syrup, fresh fruit and bacon. Lots of nice compliments and will definitely make it this way again! Thanks Chef John!

This was wonderful & my family asked that I make it like this again.  Ok, now for my changes. We are part of a gluten & dairy free household so, I used Udi gluten free raisin bread, almond milk, no salt, & I had no allspice. Oh, we do eat eggs but, they're the healthy kind. These were delicious & I will be making then again!

Around here, every time severe winter weather is predicted, the stores are emptied of bread, milk, and eggs. I always said that apparently there is a ritual I know nothing of; that when severe weather threatens, one must consume large quantities of french toast! 
More seriously, thanks for the method tip! I love learning little things like that.

Before tonight, I had never found a French toast recipe that matched my mom's. This one exceeds it! I think that the key to it is the addition of both allspice and cinnamon. Baking it after frying it in the pan was a great way to finish it up. I used Pepperidge Farm's Italian bread instead of French bread, and it worked nicely. I think that you could easily use any thick sliced bread with this.

It is wonderful to know I've been making French toast correctly, many arguments have ensued with many people over my method, my mother's method, her mother's and so on, over how we've been making these; and we are French!!!!! I now rest my case :)

I used day old regular whole wheat bread and followed the instructions  exactly.  The toast turn out very crisp, no soft middle which is how I like it.  For this reason, I would not make this again, unless I have very thick bread to use, like french bread, etc.

Now I know what French Toast should taste like!  This was superb; a definite one to add to my collection and can't wait to serve it to others.  I didn't have Allspice, so looking up this ingredient for a close match, I found that an equal amount of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg come pretty close to the actual spice.  I did so and it truly added to the mixture.  Made this for my wife and I and she raved about how great it was.  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe.

Replaced milk w/heavy cream and served with homemade applesauce and pure maple syrup! Sooooo yummy! Loved how baking them afterwards resulted in a) a delightfully crunchy French toast, and b) everyone enjoying their breakfast at once!  Thanks as always Chef John!!

Best homemade french toast I've ever made. My toast usually comes out really soggy (which I don't really like).  My toast turned out moist but not soggy after sticking it in the oven for 15 minutes.

This was very yummy. I only had thin-sliced bread at the time so in the future need to find thicker bread to bring out the flavor even more.  Did not have, or use allspice which was perfectly okay.  I had not known about baking french toast in the oven before and that's what sealed the deal for me. Thanks!

After making Chef John's recipe I won't go back to the "other" way of making French toast. I used to buy Texas Toast, not any more! It is better than most restaurant French Toast recipes.

This is an delicious recipe. Putting it in the oven to crisp the outside is the key. I also added some caramelized bananas to put on top. Simply take brown sugar, butter or margarine, water, a dash of cinnamon, and vanilla. Then use the excess sauce to pour over the toast. For those watching their weight, I used low fat bread, liquid eggs and fat free milk. You can skip the bananas, but everyone deserves a little treat. Sprinkle a little powered sugar on for effect.

Very good and crispy. Didn't have french bread but used homemade bread and instead of allspice I used sugar. Very good. A keeper.

Wow!  I'm not a chef and that's how I do it!  I make a batter with eggs, milk, NUTMEG, CARDAMON, allspice, cinnamon, and vanilla.  I just don't throw it in the oven.  Maybe I will the next time I do French Toast. I use "gazillion grain and seed bread."  Usually "Dave's Killer Bread" brand.

Well, like most everyone else said, "who knew"?" It is just as easy &tasty as advertised. I loved how crunchy it was on the outside but still a delight inside. Cooked it in oven at 375 degrees for ten minutes because all I had was regular slices of French bread. Great recipe!

I used to make French toast without baking but I love this way so much more! I used wholewheat bread and didn't add much all spice and it turned out well. Maybe next time I would add a bit more cinnamon. Very delicious!

This is the only way I knew how to make French Toast.  When I would visit hotel or banquet halls, the stuff that was introduced as French Toast simply tasted like bread dipped in egg with no flavoring. My grandmother taught me this more than 50 years ago, and Chef John, those you have introduced to it, will never go back again!

Chef John is starting to become my go to! I used regular white Italian slices, because it was all I had. I was concerned it might get dry in the oven, but it didn't . Amazing the difference baking it does!

This made an amazing breakfast - Breakfast for 4 and we all agreed - 5 Stars!! Wife and daughter added chopped almonds and they loved it.  We all added a simple syrup (equal parts brown/white sugar and water - not as sweet as it sounds).  Baking really firms up what could otherwise be a soggy bread. Nice & crispy - use a good bakery bread - not pre-sliced - and you'll be much happier with your own thick cuts of French Toast.
