We have been making this dish for a while, it's one of our favorite ways to prepare salmon.  The balsamic sauce is so delicious, just simply drizzle a little of the sauce on a salad and you're ready to go!  Sometimes I substitute brown sugar for the white.  Thanks for posting this, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it already.

I thought this turned out very well.  I just sprinkled lemon juice on top and estimated the liquid ingredients.  It is a simple sauce that does go well on salmon, and although I cooked one filet a bit longer, it was a larger size so needed it.  thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have lemon and used maple syrup instead of white sugar... but it turned out very yummy! We don't have salmon often but this was a very easy and satisfying way to prepare it :)

I followed the recipe but used Olivio spray instead of the melted margarine.  I thought it was sooo easy and very tasty.  My husband, who can take or leave salmon, really liked it!

very nice and easy.  my wife was a little scared when she saw the sauce but liked it a lot. I made the sauce about one hour before starting and let it sit in the frig to let the ingredients marry. I think it brought out the combined flavoring of the sauce better. I also added a very little bit of shiracha into the sauce for a little heat.

I bake salmon about once a week and was looking for something different to switch things up.  Loved this-- simple to whip together and tasted great!  I'll be using this one again!

Just made this tonight - pretty good! I liked it, my husband prefers salmon with just lemon, butter and garlic, but I thought this was a fun variation to how I usually make salmon. I followed everything except I didn't have a lemon, so I just added about 1 tbsp lemon juice to the sauce.

Made this last night. I don't cook fish too often; I'm always afraid I'll the overcook the fish. I loved the flavor blend of balsamic vinegar, sugar, soy sauce and garlic! So easy to make : )

Delicious. I substituted brown sugar in place of white sugar. I melted the butter right in the pan I used to bake the fish. Delicious.

I made this tonight.  The only thing I changed was instead of butter, I sprayed fish with Pam spray.  It was delicious!  I used it on the salmon and the tilapia (2 of us don't like salmon) and it came out perfect!  My husband was thrilled, as I am not usually a creative cook with the salmon.  I have bookmarked this recipe and will definitely use it again!

Mmmmm! I really enjoyed this recipe. I only had 2 salmon filets, so I halved all of the other ingredients except the garlic; I added 1 minced clove. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Loved the sauce!  I used Monk fruit as my husband can not have sugar. Monk fruit is about 70% less sweet than regular sugar but  I used 1 to 1, same as Splenda. (We don't use Splendra anymore).Made sauce  an hour before and let it marinate. It was a little sweet for me but I was using the monk fruit for the 1st time.  Will adjust the mf next time.  He is on a version of the Keto Diet and needs fatty fish 2 to 3  times a week.  Needed  new sauces and this was a hit. Thanks!

Delicious! Dig this . . .I HATE FISH! First time making this this evening. My salmon fillets were frozen. I reduced the measured amount of the ingredients and added a pinch each of ground ginger and red pepper. It worked out great and I will bake again.

The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine.  This was easy and delicious.  I love trying new sauces and glazes for salmon.

Iâ€™m new to cooking fish, but this was simple and delicious. The first time I made this,  I had to improvise a bit because it was last minute and I only had stove top (no oven).  I pan fried the fish and cooked the sauce on low in a small pan and added it at the end. It was still very tasty!

I have made recipe several times. Vegan margarine is not a staple in my house so I use my Land O Lakes stick margarine.  Delish as written.
I have used brown sugar in place of white. I have combined and cooked down the components for a slightly thicker sauce. I have used this on catfish. Anyway I have used this sauce it turns out great.

Followed the spirit of the recipe. I  usually don't measure when adding spices and flavors, and this was no exception. Really like garlic so added more, don't need the sugar so only  added 1 tsp. The salmon was fresh so didn't need as much butter.  Very easy to make and tasted great.

I felt that this recipe was bland as written.  So, I seasoned each filet with black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  Next time I will add a little ginger.  It is a good recipe with the changes made.

This recipe is a favorite in my house! The proportions worked very well, the only thing I changed was the order in which I put the melted butter on the salmon. I put the butter on the fish last, as I found the balsamic sauce did not soak in as well if the butter was placed on the fish first.
