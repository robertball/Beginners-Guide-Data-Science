Yum! This was quick and delicious.  The whole family enjoyed it.  After reading the other reviews, I altered the recipe just slightly...  I added cumin, white pepper and salt to the chicken breasts, put tortilla chips on top, covered and baked for 15 min.  Removed the foil, added the cheese and baked for the additional 30 min.  Reminded me a lot of chilaquiles.

I thought it was pretty good. DH seemed to really like it. The kids weren't hungry so they didn't try it. I followed the recipe except I didn't have chicken breasts so I used chicken quarters. I partially boiled them first and increased the cooking time. I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients and I needed to thin out my pantry a little. I used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. And I totally forgot about adding the cheese! I'm sure I would have liked it better with the cheese. I agree with others that say the sauce would make a good chili con queso dip. But I would only use chili without beans. I didn't like them in the dish. The chicken turned out good and moist but while eating it I had to add salt to mine for flavor. I think I will try it with hamburger meat and also as a queso dip but without the cream of chicken soup. Overall, it was a pretty good recipe, different and very easy.

i probably shouldn't be reviewing this since i made all these changes, but i think the flavor came out like the original. i put in some ingredients and this popped up. i didn't have cream of chicken soup so i used cream of onion, left out the onions, and added extra chicken broth and some "Better than Boullion" chicken flavor. no corn tortillas so i toasted flour tortillas. i cubed the chicken for easier serving from the dish. didn't have chili with beans but had "chili beans" with chili spices so used that. it was good! simple, quick to put together. it's not too pretty but that does not matter. thanks for recipe.

Pretty good cassarole...Although I think I'd put the tortilla strips on top of the soup mixture because strips got very mushy.  I like a little more crunch to my food. The flavor was fantastic...made me think that the mixture of the soups would be a great queso dip for tortilla chips.  The chicken was super moist!

This recipe was very easy to put together and is delicious.  I did add crumbled chips on top of it to make it look better. We had some of it leftover from our meal, and it re-heated very well when we ate it at another meal. I will be making this again, and probably very soon.

actually a lot better than i expected! i decided to try this because i had all the ingredients already in the pantry, but i was a little wary of how it would all taste together. i'm glad i tried it because it really worked well. i sliced my breasts in half so it wouldn't be so "chickeny" and used flour tortillas because that's what i had. the chicken was very moist, and the sauce was excellent served with spanish rice! not visually stunning, but a nice hot meal that doesn't take a lot of time or finesse :)

I fully expected this to be gross, but it was SO good.  Instead of tortillas, I topped the chicken with broken tortilla chips, sliced black olives, and cheddar cheese just at the very end until the cheese was melted.  

I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts, so I cooked them at 350 for an hour, covered with foil until the end when I added the cheese etc.  YUM!

The sauce, thinned, would make a great base for tortilla soup, too.

This was ok. If I made it again (which I probably won't), I would use more tortilla and cut the chicken more.

It was pretty good but too soggy the tortillas need to be fried to a crisp similar to a enchilada cassorol

This was pretty good, especially for how easy it is. I omitted the chile peppers since they weren't on hand. I added bell peppers. I also added some potato because i had it left over. I only put about 1/3 of the tortillas ontop of the chicken, bcs i didn't want it too mushy. The rest of the tortilla strips I put on top, and topped that with the cheese. This added a wonderful crisp! My husband said he would have liked it with beef instead of chicken - i might try that next time!
