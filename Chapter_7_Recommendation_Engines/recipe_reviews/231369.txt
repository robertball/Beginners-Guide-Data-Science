Not in recent memory have I been so disappointed with a recipe.  I’ve always believed it’s just not good common sense not to use your own common sense.  My common sense (which I foolishly ignored) told me a half cup of milk just wasn’t right.  And it wasn’t.  I should have trusted that, followed through, and added milk as necessary, if at all.  I ended up with glop.  Risking destroying the integrity of the baked cookie I had to add another full cup of flour just to have the dough have some resemblance to cookie dough, and even then it was still sticky.  After chilling it in the fridge, it was still sticky, but I’ve made other chocolate cookies where the dough was sticky and they turned out fine.  Not this one.  While the photo I’ve submitted of these cookies doesn’t look half bad, it is total deception.  I handed a cookie to Hubs for a taste test, keeping my comments to myself for the time being.  After taking a bite he handed the cookie back to me and with an apologetic look on his face said, “These are bad.”  I tasted it too and agreed that outside of sweetness and a faint peanut butter flavor it was tasteless – this in spite of a full cup of very good cocoa powder.   I threw out the whole batch, the baked cookies as well as the unbaked dough  - effectively, that means one star, inedible.  I’m not sure, had the dough called for an appropriate amount of flour, that it would have even made a difference in the final result.

How can you go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter?  Right now my husband is enjoying them made into chocolate ice cream sandwiches.

The taste of these cookies is amazing!. I did have a problem with the baking process. They ended up taking approximately 13 1/2 minutes to cook. They ended up coming out flat.  They didn't seem to stick together after baking. And they got hard very quickly even in a closed container. It's not a bad recipe, and any number of things could have caused this.

Very easy to make, cookies remained moist, Very rich chocolate flavor, yet not too sweet.  I did not have peanut butter chips, only a small handful of vanilla chips, and even without, the cookies were delicious.

Overall, a good cookie. I undercooked them just a touch to achieve a more chewy consistency (rather than cake-like).  I used 1/2 cup bread flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour to for a more chewy, crisp on the edges cookie!

I followed the recipe exactly and other than peanut butter, there was no taste, no sweetness, very dry.  I had to toss the whole batch.  Other people seemed to have had better luck then I did.  Don't think I will make these again

If you soft bake them, they're like peanut butter chocolate lava cake cookies. Fantastic for chocoholics. 

My peanut butter chips were stale so I had to use semisweet chips. The batter is so good. This is being added to my short list of favorite desserts.

I followed the directions almost exactly (my husband asked me to add some almonds, walnuts and a few chocolate chips to the oats in the blender) and these came out great.  I was definitely a little weary reading the first person who rated them.  If you are too, just add 1/4 cup of milk at a time.  I used the full 1/2 cup of milk.  I did not use the peanut butter chips or any other chips other than the few that went into the blender.  These came out delicious.  My husband and children are very happy!

Hubby liked these.  I followed everything in the recipe exact except I didn't have peanut butter chips but hubby wanted the butterscotch ones we had on hand.  Seemed like a good combination.
