I  sometimes use a canned sloppy Joe  sauce if I'm pressed for time,  but when I do have the time, I make my own.  This is what I did for this recipe.  This recipe is very versatile as you, really can make the filling  that YOU like.
I will tell you this, it is delicious!  I wasn't able to find the Borden mild chedear shreds, but I did find their  Colby & Monterey Jack Shreds.  Both my husband and I loved it!

This was a quick and tasty sandwich to make, and the presentation in the scooped out roll kept it fun and neat to eat! 
I used a mix of half ground turkey and half ground beef, and we were happy with the results!
