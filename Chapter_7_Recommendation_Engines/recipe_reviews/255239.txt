9.29.16   It's so nice to have a tasty, new casserole recipe that doesn't have a can of soup among its ingredients.  I may have had a can of large water chestnuts, so I did halve the slices.  I had just enough Mexican 4-Cheese Blend on hand, so I made a substitution there, otherwise, followed the recipe.  The casserole has a nice "crunch" from the water chestnuts and celery, and that cheese and little bit of French fried onions was just the perfect topping.   I will try cutting back the mayonnaise a bit next time in an effort to reduce calories and fat (this is an indulgence for the way I eat) because I'm not convinced that you really need a full cup of mayo.   The one comment I would make relates to the number of servings.  I don't think we're really big-portion eaters, but this is six servings for us, not eight...but that's just a personal comment.  We enjoyed this, and it definitely will be made again (probably with leftover turkey from the not-to-distance Holidays).

This is a tasty dish but I do have some issues with the directions. The fried onions cannot hold up to 30 minutes baking. I should have known better and just added them the last 5 minutes. I had to pick burnt onions off the top of my dish. I agree with other reviewers that one cup mayo is too much. I halved it. I also added garlic powder, basil, and smoked paprika. I sprayed my casserole dish with Pam. I liked the crunch that the almonds and chestnuts gave the dish. I will make it again, with a few adjustments.

Came out fantastic every time; great base for other casseroles as well. —may use 4 cans of solid albacore tuna (water drained) instead of cooked chopped chicken since I always have tuna cans handy.  —use 1/2c miracle whip instead of 1c mayo (less fat while keeping the great flavor) —use chopped walnuts instead of almonds —may use 1 red bell pepper instead of pimento pepper —add French fried onions during the last 10 min of cooking to avoid overcooking

Delicious!  So easy to make and we all loved the 'crunchiness'.  The only change I made was to use a little less mayo, maybe about 3/4 of a cup (I used half light and half regular). Will definitely make again!

So quick and easy to prepare! It looks pretty unappealing going into the oven but quickly fills the kitchen with delicious smells, and in the end it was a hit! I only made a few changes to suit our tastes. First, I probably had closer to 2 1/2 cups of chicken because I used both greats off of a salt-free rotisserie chicken. I added 2 minced garlic cloves, bumped the black pepper to 1/2 tspn, used light mayo, and knocked the salt back a bit. I also forgot the almonds (realized they were still sitting on the counter after the casserole had been baking for 10 minutes) but will try them in next time. Mixed everything well in a large bowl before spreading into the baking dish. Baked for 35 minutes and served alongside steamed broccoli and brown rice. It was super tasty, husband loved it and requested it again soon, and I especially liked the crunch the celery and water chestnuts gave. Even with the extra chicken, this was closer to 5-6 servings for us.

Could be very good but too much mayonnaise - I would half the mayonnaise at the very least. It's delicious but I could be sick off of mayonnaise alone.

I am so glad I followed my hunch and tried this  recipe. The only changes I made: Did not use the almonds, added one garlic clove and used half a cup of light mayo (which seemed like plenty.) It was delicious! Served on top of warm Naan bread. And no it doesn't make very much....but then again my husband and I eat a lot. A winner.

I pan fried the celery with real onions before I added to chicken mayo mix.  Also added a tap of chili paste as I don’t like pimentos. Served with mashed cauliflower. Good!   Family likes it and I will repeat it!

This made alot! I had leftovers for my lunch and dinner the next day. :)
 I left out the fried onions,because I didn't have any,and placed the sliced almonds on top of the casserole instead of mixing them in.I substituted chopped red pepper instead of pimiento, because my hubs doesn't like pimiento,nor do I.
I, like other reviewers thought 1 cup of mayo was way too much,even though the chicken I used was a routissere which I got 2 1/2 cups chopped chicken.  I used 2/3 cup mayonnaise and the casserole didn't come out dry.

It was ok, but not a fan. At first it was good, but became too much.

Wow. My loaves turned out great. Instead of white sugar, I used honey. I found out on researching that for 1 T of sugar, can replace it for 2t of honey. So I used 6 t of honey, to replace 3 T of sugar.   I only put 1 1/2 t kosher salt instead of 1 T  OF SALT.

Easy and quick but the mayo tasted so overpowering. Maybe ill try just 1/2 cup next time.
