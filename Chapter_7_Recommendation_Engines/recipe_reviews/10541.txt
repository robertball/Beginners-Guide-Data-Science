After reading the reviews I still tried the recipe sans lemon or vanilla extract.  Instead I increased the lemon zest to 1 tablespoon.   I rolled the dough out to 1/8" and baked for 10 minutes without using the sugar coating.  The consistency was great; I got a nice golden color around the edges.  I drizzled the cookies with an icing made from ~ 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 tbsp. lemon juice and ~ 1/4 tsp. lemon zest. I let the icing dry (about 1 hour) before stacking for storage.  My daughters gave them a double thumbs-up for taste.  Most of the flavor intensity came from the icing instead of the cookie.  Remember that it's a lemon and butter cookie, and I tasted a good balance of both from my procedure.

All-in-all the recipe was pretty good.  I would probably swap the lemon juice for the extract next time around.  Also, the thickness of the cookie as stated in the recipe is not correct.  It says the dough should be rolled to 1/4" inch.  Using this thickness the yield is approximately half of the 2 1/2 dozen stated.  Not only is the yield cut in half but the cooking time hs to be almost doubled.  I suggest rolling these to about 1/8" thickness.

These were very light and refreshing!! I substituted 1 teas vanilla and 1 teas lemon extract instead of the lemon juice. Instead of rolling I refrigerated the dough made into small balls and flattened out into circles. I used the sugar cookie icing recipe from this site! Very Yummy and easy! Thanks Kathleen!

This recipe is excellent! I added a little more lemon zest to the dough.  I did not decorate with granulated sugar, instead I made an icing with powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  Every person that tried these cookies, thought they were wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.

YUM!  As a big lemon dessert person, I search high & low for decent lemon cookie recipes (no cake mix!!), and this one was a winner!  It's still a tad soft and just lightly cakey in the center, but the edges were crisp and the flavor was really good.  I followed the recipe as is, except I did not roll them out, just spooned them in sparse teaspoonfuls.  I did put sugar on the tops, too.  I usually prefer the lemon flavor to be more pronounced, but the light, delicate lemon flavor in this went well with it being a "butter cookie", so I really can't complain.  I decided to make a simple, easy glaze to top them.  I put about 1/4 cup of sugar in a glass mixing cup, added just enough lemon juice to barely wet it, then microwaved for 1 min 10 seconds, till bubbly.  then I stirred in about 1.5 oz of cream cheese and mixed w/a fork until the cream cheese was blended through.  The lemon cream cheese glaze really amped up this cookie, give it a try.

I don't understand how the taste can be so varied when you follow a recipe exactly as stated. I thought these were bland. I tried various icings to "fix" the flavor. This is first time that I have tossed a batch in the garbage. Sorry.

Just made these last night and followed all directions with the exception of lemon zest, didn't have any. The dough was easy to work with and as I couldn't wait I only refrigerated it until my oven preheated. Rolled small dough balls and rolled again in granulated sugar, flattened slightly and baked for eight minutes, perfect. There is a distinct tang of lemon so I can see why some subbed vanilla and omitted the lemon entirely. I also flattened the dough I didn't use last night, cut out small heart shapes this a.m., and baked also for eight minutes after sprinkling with red sugar for Valentine's, lovely. Such an easy recipe, will make again as I need more heart shaped cookies - will try vanilla flavoring alone this time. ( Also, my butter was really, really soft as it was sitting out near a heat vent, made no difference that I can see in how cookie turned out.)

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe with no problem, and made the lemon glaze icing suggested by another reviewer.  Delicious, light, delicate with lemon zing from the icing flavor.

Easy to make. Simple directions. 

I found that the lemon taste is too subtle though. Next time I would add more lemon juice or zest. 

It also took a long time for my cookies to turn brown. Not sure why but it was way more than the 8-10 minutes it says. They are definitely tasty though!

I have been baking cookies for many years, and know some of the "tricks' to fix a dough.  These cookies, in my opinion, should have been baked at 375, instead of 350.  I baked each batch for over 14 minutes, and they still didn't brown.  They tasted doughy, and bland.  I tried to add a lemon icing, which only helped a little.  I was looking for a light, buttery cookie, and this was not it!

If you like a cake like cookie, this is for you.  I added lemon extract to my dough and the lemon flavor really came out.  I was looking for a thin, crispy cookie but these turned out really well and very tasty!

These are the lightest most delicated little cookies... I made them just a bit thicker than suggested and added 1 tbsp more lemon juice to the recipe... They turned out excellent.... I did however try the original recipe first and thought that it needed something extra for my taste but overall a GREAT little cookie....

I added two bars of chopped good quality white chocolate to these, and they were excellent.  Be sure to chop the zest to nearly nothing - zest near the surface of the cookies became hard and not too pleasant.

After reading the reviews, and realizing I had no extract at all, I used the zest and juice of one small lemon with a little extra flour. I absolutely love this recipe! Tastes awesome, and was exactly what I was looking for! Thanks! :D

We really think these are great cookies. Just the way we like them, subtle and not too sweet! I didn't have a lemon, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1tsp. each of lemon extract and vanilla. I was also impatient. Instead of chilling and rolling, I scooped little balls onto the cookie sheets and used a drinking glass covered with a damp cloth to smash them down. After cooking and cooling, I tossed them in powdered sugar. Delicious!

These were pretty good and i would rate them higher if only they would not have been so crumbly. As i picked them up to ice them, the bottoms had gotten stuck to my plate! Over all they tasted great and looked super cute!

I am a huge fan of most anything lemon! However, these did not come out anything like what I was expecting! First of all the dough was too sticky for me to roll it out, even after adding a lot more flour. I ended up pressing it flat with my finger tips. After cooking them,  the taste was not what I was looking for at all. The sugar on top did not seem to help much, but maybe some frosting would help. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, but I do not plan to make these again.

These cookies are yummy.  With this frosting they are superb!  1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup shortening, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbsp milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Warm butter to soften then cream together with shortening (I use an organic non-hydrogenated one), slowly add sugar.  Then add milk and vanilla and whip (I just use a fork but if you have a nice mixer it would probably be easier).

deliciously crisp, not too sweet.  I doubled this recipe and yielded 32 3 inch cookies.  I recommend that the dry ing. be sifted first to allow air to be incorporated. I used fresh lemon and zest because re-constitued lemon juice contains too much water thus making the cookie hard. I also increased the lemon juice and the zest to 1 tbsp each.  The cookies do not brown on the top, but have a golden underside.  They required 14 minutes of baking - but check them after 10 or 11 min.  I also used a thin icing on top using the recipe of one of the reviewers on only half of the batch, to sweeten them up for those who like a sweeter cookie. They could also be used as a sandwich type with icing in the middle. 
I would rate them as 4 stars and would make them again.

These were really easy to throw together and they taste very lemony and have a nice texture.  The only thing I changed was I decorated the cookies with confectioners sugar instead of granulated.

Yummy cookie, just seemed like a lot time went into making these with very few cookies yielded from the process.   I added 1/2 lemon extract to the mix, very subtle lemon flavor.

I just made a batch of these cookies and they were not good. I followed the recipe exactly, but the resulting cookies were undercooked and bland. They were not crisp, nor lemony enough, and were barely buttery. Sorry! I also had to leave them in the oven for an additional 8 minutes and I only got a total of 14 cookies...which actually worked out for me because I do not like these cookies at all.

Although it technically classifies as a cookie, I found this recipe to be lacking the sweet stuff.  Next time, I'll be doubling the sugar.  Otherwise nicely textured with a great lemon flavor.

Tried making these exactly as stated.  I have a very small kitchen, so I do not have room to roll out dough.  I scooped by teaspoonfuls and then pressed with a sugar-coated glass to between 1/8-1/4 inch thickness.  Made exactly as many cookies as recipe stated.  However, with stated cooking temps and times these cookies burned to smitherines!  Even after I moved the oven rack all the way to the top...one batch was in there for 3 minutes and the bottoms still burned!  The ones that were edible were tasty crispy little guys, but definitely not worth making again.

The cookies were great and simple to make.  I love lemon flavor so I used the juice of small lemon and an extra teaspoon of the lemon zest.  The cookies were perfect!

This is a delicious, crispy cookie.  I only made one minor alteration ---I followed someone else's suggestion and used about 1 tsp of lemon extract instead of the lemon juice for a stronger flavour. Very good with tea.

They were really easy to make but not as lemony as I would like, I didn't add the lemon zest because I don't like it, maybe that adds a lot of lemon flavor but I doubt it.

The dough was extremely sticky even after being refrigerated for the 2 hours stated in the recipe. I had to use more flour to pat out the cookies as I was unable to roll them out. They turned out a little more cake-like than I like, but still like the lemon flavor.

This was a really nice recipe but maybe change it to 1 tbsp of lemon zest?  I thought that they turned out really well and when you first bit in to the cookie there was the buttery flavor and then  the lemony flavor came later.
I'm going to use this recipe a lot!

These are phenomenal. I added  a bit more lemon zest and juice than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed it exactly. My partner says these are the best home-made cookies he's ever had. Thank you for the recipe!

Made the the original 3 or 4 times. Wonderfully light and just crisp enough.  The last batch I made in a pinch and used bottled juice and had to skip the zest (no fresh available).  As my husband reviewed ... not lemoney enough!  So some lemon juice and icing sugar to make a glaze ... topped the rest with the glaze and let set.  Re-review ... perfect.  They were gone shorley there after!

I turned this into a Gluten Free Recipe with Namaste GF flour from Costco.  Absolutely wonderful! 

I added poppy seeds,  the juice of one lemon and the zest of two lemons.  

I think the secret to a crunchy cookie is to make sure it is a thin cookie before baking.  I also baked 11-12 mins. 
My glaze was made of butter, lemon juice, powdered sugar and agave.

Made these for a baby shower tea party in bunny shapes. Wish I'd cooked them a bit longer so they were crispier, but they were very good nonetheless. They were great with the different flavored teas we served.

I made these today had two sheets full of tiny star cookies, they baked just beautiful, pretty little cookies with a nice texture, I ate two bite size cookies, and they left a very very bitter flavor in my mouth that won't go away, is it the baking powder? I won't be making these again.

These cookies were just okay. It really takes a lot more than two tablespoons of lemon juice to taste the citrus, and the cookies get stale very quickly..didn't make it more than 24 hours in the tupperware. They would make good thumbprint tea cookies or just tea cookies in general, but I would recommend not making more than what you need because of how quickly they go stale.

I just made these and I think they would be great served with coffee or tea ( like our church social ) . I didn't have lemon zest so I am not getting as much lemon flavor as I would like ( my fault ) , But I am enjoying these as they are . I love the simplicity and texture of the recipe and will definately use this one again. I didn't refridgerate either , just dropped  by teaspoonfuls

I thought these cookies were great. It was the perfect combination of lemon and butter. I did not chill for 2 hours because I just don't have the patience, so I dropped teaspoon size balls onto the baking sheet and they came out round and delicious! I experimented by dipping half of each cookie in chocolate which was a fabulous idea....lemon and chocolate are a perfect match!

This recipe is a waste of time, energy, and ingredients. The cookies turned out bland and doughy. The cook times and temperatures are completely off, and I was using an oven thermometer. I am going to use a reliable Betty Crocker lemon buttercream frosting to try to salvage these cookies.

I was searching for a light butter cookie to serve with home made raspberry sorbet. This recipe sounded good, but turned out just "ok" .

These cookies were very good.  I didn't get too much of a lemon flavor, but I'll try again and maybe add more zest or juice, or both!  Either way, they are a delicious butter cookie.

I love lemon cookies, they are so light and crisp. They look pretty wrapped in celophane and ribbons and given as gifts.

I made this with my neices, it was a lot of fun and we decorated them for July 4th afterwards..the only thing that seemed to be lacking was more flour.. I think you need about 1 more 1/2 cup for it to really work. The dough was too runny to roll out. But other than that, thumbs up!

I made this with margarine and lemon juice & rind from 1/2 a lemon, it was just about lemony enough. Nice texture, doesn't flatten out. I liked it as is, but if you like a moister cookie, frosting may be a good idea.

These were a little dry, but I put lemon flavoured cake icing on top instead of sugar.  Still pretty good :)

I've made these cookies several times, sometimes substituting orange for lemon. They have a light, delicate taste, and the recipe allows for versatility. You do need to watch that they don't overbake, but the time set out in the recipe is pretty much on target.

These are very good.  I used more lemon zest than the recipe called for, about twice as much.  Also, keep a close eye on the cookies while they are baking.  They will overbrown if you give them half a chance.

These were pretty good- we liked the tart lemon taste, but I wasn't too crazy about the texture.. however, my husband and boys loved them!  I tried to cheat and use margerine instead of butter- I am definitely going to try them again with butter next time.
