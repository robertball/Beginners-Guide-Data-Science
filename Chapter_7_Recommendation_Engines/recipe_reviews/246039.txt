This is so refreshing! Turned out more like a granita than a sorbet really. I garnished it with some candied lemon peel and a sprig of mint. Turned out so pretty. Would make a nice dessert for a dinner party. Thanks for the recipe!

It's rather tart ... I might play with it a little next time but it was terrific. It took a bit longer to freeze than I expected but it worked well. It was finished in time and that's what was important.
