This is a perfect recipe for our familyâ€¦ quick and easy and adaptable.  I added a few mushrooms for my son and kept my Hubby's as written.  Using salsa couldn't be easier as we always have some on the go at our house so it is a faster option that other tomato sauces.  If you have a toaster oven this is perfect under the broiler and kid friendly to make.  This type of snack is the first thing I ever learned to make as a child.  Still love it.

This made for a really good lunch for me.  I wondered how the salsa would work when it's placed on the bottom of the muffin, but it soaked in just perfectly.  I did add some bacon (a piece that was already cooked from the day before), but it really wasn't very necessary.  The muffin, salsa, and cheese was perfect as it was.  Thanks for lunch, SgtSquishy!

These were good, but I wished I had toasted it a bit first before putting on the salsa. Also, 5-10 minutes is a big time frame. I left mine in for 5, but they could have come out at 4 min. I used more like 2 tsp salsa on each muffin and used regular bacon and black olives. Quick, nice lunch.

Simple and tasty! I used regular bacon b/c that's what I use at home. The family liked these. Thanks for sharing. :)
