This was wonderful. I took two photos of this..one a paleo version  the other. non paleo - served with corn crepes. Both ways were delicious.  I forgot to buy a yellow pepper and had to use oil instead of bacon fat to sear, but it all came out  great

I was looking for a recipe for pulled pork that was beyond the normal BBQ style and while not intended for that purpose,  it fit my needs perfectly. I substituted Serrano peppers and an orange habanero as that's what I had. Didn't roast the peppers, just cut them up and put directly in the crock pot, along with all the other listed ingredients.  Superb flavor for those who love a little heat. Served with homemade corn tortillas,  refried beans and rice made with spicy diced tomatoes.

This is delicious with just the right amount of spice! Followed recipe with only one substitution; used Trader Joeâ€™s Green Hatch Chili Salsa, that is what I had on hand, instead of the Anaheim peppers. Served with avocado, cilantro and lime. Provided small street taco tortillas for the kids (ages 15,14 & 11). I will definitely make this again.

This is terrific!  We loved putting it together and being done for the day.  The smell as it cooked was wonderful.  The flavors are so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an awesome alternative to "regular" pulled pork recipes. The whole family loved it.
