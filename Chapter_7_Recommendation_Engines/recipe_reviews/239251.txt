We love & eat a lot of Salmon. While this recipe was a little bit on the sweet side for us, we did like it. However, the STAR of this dish was the Spinach! Fantastic! The addition of the Pine Nuts was also good! I will make this combination of Salmon and Spinach again, but with WAAAAY less Honey or maybe even use Maple Syrup instead mixed with a tab bit of butter or mayo.

This was Wonderful! I followed the recipe to the letter. The only tiny issue is we wanted more of the spinach! Without the spinach, we found the salmon needed a little oomph, but when eaten together (as the recipe intends) it was really fantastic! Thank you, Mazola!

Excellent, although I almost doubled the spinach/garlic/onions because I really like them.

Very tasty salmon! I really liked the pine nuts but they are very pricey right now, you could leave them out IMHO.  Thanks Mazola, will make again!

This was an easy, but flavorful way to prepare salmon.  My husband loved it!  I served it with Berry Spinach Salad also a Mazola recipe on All Recipes.  They are great together!

Excellent recipe! My husband loved it. The pine nuts were a nice touch. Prepared it as directed except for the white wine. I drank all my wine so I had to use apple cider.

I make salmon 1-3 times a week and this is a great new recipe to add! Very tasty and using Mazola corn oil really lets the flavors of the fish shine through! I doubled the spinach because it was so good.

Great quick and easy recipe.  I adjusted for the thickness so as to not over cook.
Also I heated the remaining sauce and poured over just before serving.

Really enjoyed this. I had about 8 oz of salmon but used the full amount of the spinach mixture,and I was glad I did because there would not have been enough otherwise. I subbed almonds for the pine nuts since that's what I had on hand. Quick and easy and so flavorful, yum!

This recipe was an easy to make and tasty way to prepare salmon. I took the advice of reviewers to lessen the ratio of honey the recipe called for. This recipe will be used again in our household.

I make salmon a lot and for years I have been looking for new ways to change it up but easy ways.  I made this tonight and my picky teenaged son said this was by far his new favorite salmon dinner.  I had a 1.7 pound steelhead filet and I used the juice of a whole large lemon with 1/2 cup

We liked it.  The kids weren't excited about the "toppings," but I would make again.  We love salmon and are always looking for new ways to prepare it.

Delicious! With 3lbs of salmon, we used 1/2C honey and 3T of lemon juice and it was more than enough.  We made 10oz of spinach and doubled the other topping ingredients, using walnuts instead of the pine nuts.

This was good, but not fantastic. I doubled the spinach mixture, per reviews, and lowered the amount of honey. Maybe I lowered it too much because it wasn't sweet at all and not much flavor. I didn't like the wine flavor with it.. I would prefer vegetable broth, I think. It definitely needed to have double the spinach because we used that as our veggie.

The marinade was a little too sweet. Might add ginger or something to cut it next time, but we eat a lot of fish and this was a nice change from my usual recipe.
The spinach was great and nice to have something different.

After reading the reviews I used the juice of one small lemon & 1 Tbs honey for the salmon to reduce the sweetness. It was wonderful & a hit with my boys.

I added some extra lemon to the spinach just because I love it, and it perfectly complemented the sweet flavor of the salmon. Delicious!

I loved the sweet flavor of the salmon. Was super filling too. I did substitute orange juice in place of the lemon juice and left out the lemon zest. Also forgot to put the salt in. Tasted great without though. Thanks for sharing
