This is tasty, but not the way I have always had it.  This is the Spam loco, but if you just order loco moco, it's usually hamburger. Originally, you cook the short grained sticky/sweet/sushi type (Calrose) rice by rinsing and then soaking it in water, then cook cook it according to package directions.  Top that fresh, hot, rice with a salisbury steak or grilled hamburger patty. Then top the patty with rich brown gravy.  Then top everything with an over easy fried egg. MMMMMmmmm.

I made this to mimic the more traditional recipe that we had on our trip to Hawaii by using a hamburger patty (seasoned with worchestire and pepper) instead of spam. I also made my own brown gravy by using the hamburger drippings vegetable broth and corn starch. Delicious.

I also make it with ground beef patties, or with cubed steak, and I always make my own brown gravy... Just use lean ground beef, do not drain, stir in enough beef stock to cover, add a few tablespoons of flour mixed with 1/4 cup of beef stock, (And sweet rice flour for extra thickening, if you have it!) and reduce to make a wonderful homemade gravy!  Also, I make it with eggs over easy. Runny Yolky Goodness!

I saw this recipe mentioned on the Recipe Buzz yesterday and just HAD to try it. It's so good!! I don't care for scrambled eggs so I cooked mine over medium instead. Also I used the brown gravy in a packet instead of the canned gravy because it's basically the same thing but less expensive. This won't be a regular breakfast item because of the high level of fat cholesterol and sodium but it's definitely going to be a once-in-a-while treat!

This is much better with hamburger patties instead of spam. More traditional as well.

This recipe is easy to make and simple. Not the greatest. If you're looking for an easy spam locomoco dish and don't know where to start this recipe will suffice. However if you are looking for a more traditional local Hawaiian style hamburger locomoco you picked the wrong recipe.

This is really good with sausage as well not link sausage but the kind you make in to patties and fry. Use whatever kind you like but just regular sausage is really good.

I'll give this four stars because it has pieces of some of my favorite comfort food. Spam eggs and rice - I never have gravy with it. You don't need it... just use the yolk from the egg. Also if you fry the SPAM in some canola oil it gets crispy on the outside like bacon. YUM! (SPAM light is just as yummy as regular SPAM in my opinion... with less fat calories and sodium) My loco moco is always with hamburger too. I was curious to see if there was an 'official' recipe posted and was really surprised to see it used with SPAM.

This is great 'comfort food' that does not take all day to make. I usually make this with a seasoned hamburger patty instead of Spam... but love the Spam version just the same.

I would highly recommend making this with medium-grain rice, because that is the best-tasting rice (in my not so humble opinion :P ) and because that's more in the spirit of the original dish. You can use either Spam or hamburger patties--either is acceptable, and don't let anyone else convince you otherwise. I always make it with scrambled eggs, but that is because I suck at making fried eggs. If you can manage it so you can get a bit of runny yolk it is a wonderful compliment to the gravy! This may be crazy unhealthy, but it is also crazy delicious.

yep... major comfort food and way easy. I go with a burger and over easy/medium eggs though Hawaii probably consumes more Spam per capita than any state in the union. Cole slaw or lo mein on the side. Now for real traditional throw in some flying saucers (sloppy joe version)and malasadas...

This has always been a favorite of my husband who grew up on the islands and now my sons. It is quick easy and inexpensive. Not to mention tastes so good.. It has become a comfort food in our home.

I agree that traditional loco moco is made with hamburger and you can make the egg anyway you want I like mine over easy. Also very good with fried rice instead of white rice if you want something different.

This dish took me back to Hawaii! I know the traditional dish has a hamburger patty but SPAM tastes just as good!

Take out the Spam and insert a hamburger patty for a "real" loco moco. This recipe is for a Spam moco. You can go one better and replace the brown gravy with chili for a chili moco - my teenaged son's All Time Favorite!
