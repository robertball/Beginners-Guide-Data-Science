The flavor is there, but the directions were incomplete . . . missing steps for including the ginger, so I added it after the fact to the marinade, dressing & on the salad itself. There was no quantity listed for the olive oil, so I think my guess of 3/4 cup was too much.  I will try it again because the tuna turned out really good and flavorful.

This recipe was SO good and SO easy!  My husband loves seared tuna, and I've been looking for a raw watercress recipe, so this was the one for us.  Everyone in the family liked it, even my 1 and 3 year old boys... I cooked my husband's rare, but liked that I could cook mine and the boys a little longer... easy peasy!

sooo good!  tastes like the salad from a Thai restaurant.  I would make this again with shrimp or chicken too.

I loved this recipe thank you Alex!  I followed the recipe with few exceptions for personal preference. I omitted the sugar and used half olive oil and half sesame oil, and about 5 cloves of garlic. This recipe required very little tweaking to make me love it and my fiancé OFFERED to clean the kitchen afterwards! I have also made this recipe a second time using big mouth bass and grilling over a hot fire. This is a keeper. Very versatile.

Not a fan.  I made the salad dressing exactly as described and drizzled over my own mix of greens with seared ahi.  I love salads and am by no means a picky eater.  I couldn't eat the salad.  My husband gave it a 'B' though, stating the healthiness made up for the salad's lack of good flavor.

WOW!!! Really, really enjoyed this one.  I did it over a bed of spring mix.  Wish I would have put a little more salad in my bowl.  It was full on full of flavor and a very nice light meal.  I used a jalapeño because that is what I had on hand.  The only thing I will do different next time is to do the fish in my cast iron skillet because I didn't get a good seer using my heavy bottomed skillet.  Make sure it is HOT!!  Thanks for sharing.

Good dressing to start with for the tuna and the salad; however, adding soy sauce, wasabi paste really enhanced the flavor.  Thanks Alex!

Great salad. Cooked to recipe. Wasn't sure about the watercress and cilantro salad but it isn't as overpowering as it sounds. Good Thai flavors, very limey.

My husband made this recipe for me and it was by far the best seared tuna dish we've ever had ... if you went to a restaurant you'd pay $50 a person for this flavorful meal.  In fact, we're making it again tonight for out date night out ... in.

And the salad is just as good.  We used a lot of ginger because we love the flavor.  Highly recommend this to anyone who is a fish lover.

this was super awesome.. basically only used for the marinade.. might make the salad later.. but was mostly just craving seared ahi.. didn't need to salt or pepper the marinade/dressing as the fish sauce gave plenty of saltiness.. used 1/4 of the olive oil and quadrupled the garlic.. used serrano in place of the red chile pepper.. ty for satisfying my craving!

I only did the marinade and substituted 1 tsp ginger powder for the fresh ginger. The tuna turned out really great.

I did not have cilantro at hand, so next time I will make sure I have it ready. Yummy.

I made this tonight with what I had of the recipe: didn't have any chile, but had all the other stuff. Also put it over a bed of butter lettuce because that's what I had. Oh boy, this was GOOD! I agree with the other reviews...this is incredibly versatile and very tasty! I WILL save this and do it again. Thank you!!
