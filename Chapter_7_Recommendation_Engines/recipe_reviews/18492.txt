This seems to be identical to a recipe my mom has labeled as "Pistachio Mousse," and calls for pistachio pudding. This stuff is simple, but tastes great! Like a whipped cheesecake crossed with a cream pie, all on a shortbread cookie crust. I've tried a few different variations, including banana, butterscotch, and chocolate, but pistachio is still my favorite (and I'm not even a big pistachio person). As an added bonus, the spring green color makes it a good pick for St. Patrick's Day or Easter!

This is an easy and delicious dessert.  I have a friend who also adds 8oz. of finely chopped pecans to the flour and butter which is also very good.

This was so simple to make!  I was immediately asked to make it for another occassion.  I don't dread making it because it is so quick!  Very delicious, but definitely not a diet food!!!

Everyone loved it. Used pistachio pudding this time. Pretty color for Easter. Next time I am going to use chocolate pudding & slice some bananas into it. Had a problem serving it. Crust stuck to the bottom so next time I will spray the bottom of the pan with Pam. It's a keeper.

So easy to make which is my kind of dessert. I made it with 1/3 less fat cream cheese, low-fat milk, and sugar-free pistachio pudding mix since one of our guest was diabetic and another on a diet. They all loved it and were happy they could eat dessert. Great cool dessert for a warm day.

Try this recipe with lemon instant pudding instead of the chocolate - so refreshing and light!

What did i do wrong.? Mixing the pudding with milk never hardened...it was a soupy mess, much less ever being able to spread the extra whipped cream on top. I  tried adding cornstarch to salvage the dessert but to no avail. I re read the recipe and reviews to try and figure out what i did wrong. Too bad the picture looks sooo good. What happened?

So simple and so good! This taste like pudding pop. I really love the simple crust as well. I can't believe I had everything on hand and i needed my chocate fix. I didn't change a thing, just adjusted the servings to fit my pie pan.

My Mother-in-law made this many years ago (with a different name) in both the chocolate version and the pistachio. They were both very good. (She always added walnuts to the crust and sometimes sprinkled them on top.) To "jmellas", is it possible that you picked up the "cook and serve" kind of pudding rather than the "instant", by accident? This happened to me once (only in the reverse) since the boxes looked extremely similar. This would explain why your pudding layer remained a "soupy mess". Otherwise I don't see how the pudding layer would not have firmed up a bit. I hope this lends some insight on what might have happened.

This is really, really good! I think the serving size is incorrect. I halved this recipe and made in an 8x8 glass dish. It fit perfectly and took exactly one 8oz tub of whipped topping for the entire recipe. Also, when I cut this recipe in half it then called for  1 1/2 boxes of pudding. I had to figure out how much half a box of pudding was, so I measured it. There are approx 7 Tablespoons in a box, so 1 1/2 boxes of pudding = 1 box + 3 1/2 Tablespoons...that's how I did it anyway, and it turned out perfect. It was still a little soft after chilling for two hours, but after about four hours it was perfectly firm. I will definitely make this again.

The combination of cream cheese, cool whip, and pudding made this a wonderful easy dessert. I added  2 crushed up Oreo cookies to the top and garnished it with cherries. The recipe made around 16 servings.

This is sooo good!!  I made it with chocolate pudding and put in a 9 inch pie shell which was probably too small for this but it looked nice and pretty. :)

I made this yesterday and had to make substitutions with adding gluten free flour and xantham gum for the crust in order to make it gluten free for my daughter with Celiac Disease. It was absolutely wonderful and I will be making it again for church potlucks. Thanks for an easy treat.

I've made this many times as "chocolate yummy".  Always a hit with my family. Adding pecans or walnuts adds a nice crunch to the crust.

I used chocolate pudding...added 1/2 cups of crushed walnuts to mix....and then after pouring the pudding mix into a pan, I topped it with sliced bananas.  Put it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hous.  Right before serving, I topped it with Cool Whip and sprinkled chocolate Jimmies over it for a special effect.  You can use any kind of pudding.  Everyone loved it!

My MIL saw this recipe in the newspaper 30 years ago.  The dessert was titled, "Better than Tom Selleck."  In any case, this was easy to make, and rich tasting.  It worked great for a potluck.  I would make this again for family or a potluck.

One of the all time favorites - I am happy to find out that it can be made with other flavor of puddings.  We only used the chocolate pudding and will be excited to try other flavors.  One of the grandchildren's favorites at any gathering.  Thank you for the idea!

I have been making this for many many years and have even featured it on my blog.It's delicious and always a hit. Now my daughters make it for their families and friends.
