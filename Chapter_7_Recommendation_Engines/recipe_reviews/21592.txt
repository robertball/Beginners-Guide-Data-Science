This is a great cheesecake, if it comes out runny you did not cook it enouph, what I do is cook for one hour at 350, or until the center of the cake is at 165 deg f. then let it sit in the oven for another hour to cool slowly, then put in the fridge for at least 6 hours to cool all the way before you even take the pan off or try to cut it.  if the center is warm at all it will apear under done and be runny.  Also your ingrediants MUST be room temp. that is very important.  and if you lay a piece of tin foil loosly on the top of the pan it will avoid over cooking the top of the cake.

Thank you for this recipe!  I lost a recipe I had that was very similar to this one.  Now I will use yours in the future.  I HATE cheesecake recipes that start out with Graham Cracker Crumbs, or Cookie Crumbs.  That isn't cheesecake!  HELLO... Cake doesn't have a crust.  Pie has a crust.  So again, thank you for this recipe.  It was at the end of a long list of cheesepie recipes.

Excellant! Made it twice, at first with no changes, good taste but too fluffy. The second time I cooked it until done, about 40 minutes longer than called for, and at 325. That time it also tasted great and had the dense, heavy texture I love. Very easy to adjust the cooking time/temp for the texture you want, if you are even slightly experienced with cheesecakes. The taste is wonderful, not too sweet, and pairs well with many toppings. One thing though, if you want the "fluffy" texture, don't top it until right before serving, or it will fall!

I have made this about five times now and I have figured out how to do it right. Mix the cream, cornstarch and vanilla together before adding to the rest of the mix. Then mix well with the cream cheese mixture. It will thicken it even before pouring into the pan. I also used parchment paper instead of foil and it turned out very well. I cook it for exactly 1 hour and then let sit on the counter for an hour. Also leave in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. It's okay at 4 hours but much better if it has been refrigerated for a day.

This is the most wonderful cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I have never tried this recipe before and it turned out perfect.  Follow the recipe exactly except bake it about 10 minutes longer.  Let it stay in the pan until it cools some before removing the form.  -Also some of you may be mixing in the whipping cream with the mixer.  When you add the whipping cream, only stir it in.  That may be why some of you are ending up with too much for your pan.  Also, the pan with the water helps to keep it from cracking and helps it to bake evenly.  This is a very light cheesecake with a rich taste and delicate creamy texture.  Very pleasing!  I am testing cheesecake recipes for a future restaurant, and this just might be the one! Thanks

I posted this recipe, and I just want to clarify again that you must start with *room temperature* ingredients, add BOILING water to the roasting pan, enough to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan, and then you must let the cake cool completely and then refrigerate until set before even attempting to remove from the pan or cut.  Also, wet the knife slightly before cutting to prevent sticking.  Thank you to all of the people who left positive feedback.  This is a great recipe and if you follow directions it turns out spectacular.

Followed recipe exactly.  Have had good luck with all the other recipes I've tried.  The top looked wonderful, but when I took off the springform, the bottom of the cake was liquidy, like pudding.

Well, it sure looks good in the picture,but for some reason it just didn't turn out for me!!  I did exactly as the recipe indicated or at least I thought I did, and it rose and broke over the sides and never finished baking. I'm giving it a 5 star because it tasted excellent but it just wasn't servable to my guests, i'm sure from some error of my own...but I definitely will try again!!

I followed this recipe to a T. All ingrediants were room temp, the heavy cream was "stirred" in not beaten in, and I did boiling water up 1/2 the springform pan inside the roasting pan. I baked at 350 for almost 2  hours and it still wasn't done! Then I let sit in the oven at 300 for another 25 minutes. I allowed it to cool in the oven and then cooled overnight. The taste was ok. This is not a dense cheesecake, and I personally don't think it had much flavor. I'm usually very liberal with my reviews, but for the time and money I put into this recipe, yikes...I don't think this one will be made again. Is the original bake temp and time for a conventional oven or a conVECTION oven. That is the only thing I can think of for why the recipes finished time is so off.

after reading everything I could find on making cheesecake and trying all the different sugestions these are the ones you need to know. 1 all ingredients must be at room temp. 2 use water bath and put springform pan in oven turkey bag to keep out water 3 center temp of cake must reach 165 deg. 4 let cool down in oven 5 refridegate at least 6 hours. Happy eating

Flavor was quite good.  I would put batter in a larger springform pan than 9" because mine overflowed in the oven.  It didn't cut nicely--stuck to the knife, making it messy to serve.

This recipe was my first attempt at a REAL cheesecake and it turned out excellent! It has a really smooth texture to it and definately does not taste "Eggy" as others have said before me. After an hour the cake was still a little too jiggly for me so I left it in for an additional 20 minutes until it just started turning golden brown and reached the top of the pan since people had trouble with the cake spilling over the top. I will definately be making this again.

This cheesecake is fantastic!  It has a lightness that other "real" cheesecakes lack.  The taste is delicate--use a good vanilla extract because the flavor comes through.  To the folks whose cheesecake didn't set--follow the recipe exactly.  Make sure your ingredients are the right temperature and that the water bath is filled with boiling water.  Using cold water means extra cooking time and less heat to the bottom of the cake.  (That's how you get a very brown top and a pudding bottom.)

Outstanding, simple recipe.  Love graham cracker crust on my cheese cake so I added one to this and I think a great recipe is even better with this simple addition (1 & 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs; 1/3 cup melted butter pressed to bottom of pan and I bake for about 10 mins and cool before adding to cake mix).

My family absolutely loves this cheesecake!  I made it using the recipe as it was written with no changes and had great results each time I baked it.  I'm going to try it with a 1/2 cup cocoa and see if it's as good made with a chocolate flavor.

A friend gave this recipe and I must say this is the best cheesecake I ever ate. It has a wonderful taste and the filling is very smooth. I thought the 9 inch pan was a little small for all the filling and next time I make it I will use a 10" pan. I have baked meny cheesecakes in the past and always bake them in a pan of water.

If you like a more creamy cheesecake texture, this is the recipe for you. I made this and another cheesecake and liked the other recipe a little better because of its denser and less creamy texture. It is a texture preference. Both were cream cheesecakes and not as dense as NY cheesecakes.

I think this is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  It's soooo creamy and because it's a basic cheesecake you can put whatever topping you want on it.  Like the other comments though it does have to cook a little longer than suggested. No big deal.  It's worth the wait.

This is the recipe I've been searching for!  I don't generally like cheesecake due to the bitter-cheesy aftertaste, and the density of it.  I had recently had a cheesecake at work that was a lovely light texture, still creamy, yet didn't have that typical cream cheese taste. 
This recipe is just that!  Light tasting and wonderful! Thank you for posting it, and thank my lucky stars for me finding it!
As for the previously addressed volume issue, I used a 12" springform pan, and I also converted the recipe to 9 servings, and it fit in wonderfully, and bake up in just over 1 hour. 
Thumbs up for this one!

This is the first cheesecake that I ever did. I liked how it came out despite that I had to leave it cooking in the oven for two and a half hours, in order for the middle to set. I am real fan of cheesecakes because of its rich creamy texture. However, I did not find it to be so in this recipe.  It came out too eggy for me. It is a good recipe for any one who wants to learn how to make a basic cheesecake.

This is an excellent recipe.  It took about an hour and a half for mine to get set and golden brown on the top then I turned off the oven and opened the door and let it set for an hour and then took it out and let it set a while more.  I took the side off the pan and it was perfect.  Very light and creamy not heavy like most New York cheesecakes. Made it for Fathers Day  everyone loved it.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever had. Exceptional recipe. I highly recommend using it. I followed the recipe exactly and also used a tip from another reviewer to leave the cake in the oven for an hour to cool down before removing. Works perfectly every time!

This cheesecake literally started a fight at the New Years party I took it to. In fact someone made off with my cake carrier with what was left. I made an Oreo cookie crust for it and drizzled caramel on top just to make it extra extra rich.

Who needs a crust? I don't like the graham-cracker crusts, and always baked a shortbread crust with cheesecakes, but with varied results. This is my new cheesecake recipe. I've made it three times and it came out perfectly each time, but I had to bake it longer than stated in the recipe (at last 20 minutes longer) Amazingly light and fluffy, considering the(enormous) fat content. As others have noted, this cheesecake improves after at least a day's refrigeration. Family fought and bargained over the last piece, co-workers raved and asked for the recipe.

Whoo-hoo! The most excellent cheesecake ever.  Great flavor and wonderful light texture.  Not too sweet and not too cloying.  This is my cheesecake recipe from now on.  I'll try fredthegreg's timing tip next time, though, as mine came out undercooked in the center despite an additional 10-min in the oven.  I just took the center out with an inverted juice glass, put some berries in the whole and it was delicious and presentable.  I placed it in the kitchen at work and people came to my office wide-eyed to tell me it was the best cheesecake they'd ever had.  What a winner.

My son,. who always is careful about his diet tasted this cheesecake when I brought it to his home for a birthdat celebration.  This is what he texted me an hour after leaving the party."That was the best cheescake I have ever tasted. I've lost all my willpower. Please, NEVER BRING IT HERE AGAIN. It is simply irresistable.

This was excellent!!  I have never made a cheesecake before and was a little timid making this one - but is was quite easy.  My husband wanted a cheesecake for a birthday cake this year and both he and my son loved it!!!  Mine took about 1 hr & 50 minutes to bake and it was yummy!!!

I have mixed feelings about this cheesecake. I liked the flavor, but the texture was troublesome. I say troublesome, because it stuck to the knife so bad I couldn't serve it without making a mess! I will make again with less cream next time. The flavor was exactly what I want with more weight to the texture. Everyone I served it to enjoyed it though. Just too fluffy for me and I will adjust. It also takes a lot longer to cook than stated!!!

Very rich!  Duh, it's cheesecake.  This technique is the best I've used.  I don't know what the towel is for, but who cares?  It works.  The only thing is to dip the knife in warm water before cutting each piece.  It gets a little messy.  I didn't and my presentation sucked but no one cared because it tasted so good.

This is a very good cheesecake. I have made many cheesecakes in the past and this is one of the most easy ones I have ever made, it had a great tast, very creamy. However it said to bake in a 9in spring form pan, I only had a 12in spring form pan and the cheesecake baked way over the side.(I can't see baking this recipe in a 9in pan.) The recipe also said to bake an hour and I had to bake it for 2 hours.I will make this one again, but I think I will try cutting the recipe in half and see how that works.

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  I don't think real cheesecake should have graham cracker crust!  This recipe is very close to the recipe used by the Grand Finale Restaurant in Glendale, OH.  This is the only recipe I will ever use!  My husband craves it and he doesn't ever eat cheesecake.

Mine is still baking and I would start out by suggesting that a bigger pan is used because it has overflowed and still has 30 minutes left to bake.  I have never made a recipe like this and don't know if I will again.  Thank god for the roasting pan or my oven would be a mess.  Sorry Honeybake...I've made better but we'll see!

mine turns out nicely..very nice in fact..very rich and creamy..but it didnt look that 'high' i guess u used a smaller baking tray..as this is my first time baking cheesecakes..i found some general tips in baking cheesecakes..such as dip your knife in the water first before you cut it as it is very soft, put the eggs one by one, mix the mixture well so it wont sink in the middle i guess..and used the water-bath technique in baking cheese cake..i hope that will help

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and it is easy to prepare and delicious! I've been using this recipe for the holidays and my family claims that it is not a holiday if they don't take home a piece of this cheesecake! I also make it for birthdays. It is definitely a family favorite. The recipe calls for 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar, which I think is too sweet, so I only use either 3/4 cup or 1 cup. Try not to over mix it as well.

For those whose cheesecakes wouldn't set completely, you may need to get an oven thermometer and check your oven temp.  Some ovens run 25-50+ degrees below the thermostat setting.  If yours is low, turn up the heat in your oven to compensate. Check the temp of the cheesecake, too - it should be at least 160 F in the middle before removing from the oven. 

A larger pan (19-12 inches) would help, too, because it would be thinner and wider and cook quicker.

This is by far the best cheese cake on the face of the earth. 
I use a 10" pan and I make a graham crust (because to me that makes it better) and I usually have enough cheese cake mix to fill another 4" pan (that cooks sperately after)
I cook it for 70 min then I turn the oven off and leave it in for at least another hour. Then remove it from oven and water bath and let it come to room temp before I put it in the fridge
It is a long process to make. But it's certainly worth the wait. I'm making it again for Easter. It's always a huge hit. I serve it plain with caramel or sliced strawberries on the side. SO SO SO good.

On my first try I relized that there is a lot of batter for this cake, and that I did not cook it long enough. But it was still the BEST cheesecake I have EVER had.   I made this again for easter and to go over the top, a caramel bourbon sauce with fresh strawberries on the side.  On the bottom I used a pecan sandie crust.  I made two this year and I have snuck a bite or two and OMG!!!   I will NEVER use another cheesecake recipe again!   NEVER!

This cheesecake is SO good!  I did have to bake for an extra 10 minutes and then I left it in the oven for another hour after turning it off and it was cooked through.  EASY and delicous as is.  I served with fresh fruit.  YUM!

Great cheesecake!  I chose to layer the outside of my springorm pan with 3-4 sheets of foil, and placed my cheesecake on the top rack.  On the second rack i used a 9x13 pan filled with boiling water to create steam in the oven.  Let it bake for an hour, then crack the oven door for another hour and put in in the ref. overnight- This is by far the best tasting cheesecake ever!

absolutly wonderful, the only thing I did different was that I left the cake in the oven for 1 hour after I turned the oven off then I left it on the counter for maybe another hour, then refrigerated overnite. I served it the next day and the raves were great, my cousin said it was the best cheesecake he ever tasted.This is my only recipie to use from now on.I loved the taste and texture.

mine did rise over the top...but...then i saw another review that said not to whip the whipping cream...to fold it in ..that makes sense...besides that I chilled it for a day..then took the sides down..that made it sink quite a bit ..it was so yummy!  AND I got 3 spring form pans at wal-mart for 12 bucks!

This was the hit of christmas dinner!
I made the recipe exacty according to recipe. I left the cheesecake in the oven until it reached room temperature. This allows the middle to cook a little longer without over cooking the outside. 

The cheesecake had Souffléd and cracked in two places. Then I refridgerated for 2 days. As the cheescake cooled, the top sank back below the rim of the pan and the cracks closed! 

I removed the walls of the springform pan just before serving, and I left it right on the bottom of the pan. 

It stayed together nicely even after several pieces were removed. 

It was wonderful!

This is a tasty and very easy recipe. However, the center turned out a little too soft for my liking. Maybe more corn starch or baking a little longer may have done the trick.

This is really the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  When I made it...I used 2 1/2 cups of heavy cream instead of the 2 cups it called for and it came out extra creamy!  Yummmmm.

Excellent!  I love this cheesecake. Always have requests fo this recipe when I make it.
Followed exact recipe ingredients; baked in Convection 1 hour then turned oven off and left in oven approx. 1 hour.  Used 9 1/2 / deep pan.  Batter amount  seems to very by how much the batter is beat.

This cheesecake is fantastic. At first it was very soft, almost like pudding, so I thought the recipe might be a bust. Then I double checked the recipe and realized I forgot to add the cornstarch *smacks forehead* So the first one became the filling for a Christmas Eve trifle with layers of soft gingerbread and caramelized apples. The second attempt has passed the hubby's "sneaky" taste test. He took a big spoon of it out of the center then covered it over with the bananas foster topping so I wouldn't notice! I am very proud to serve this cheesecake to my loved ones for the holidays. Thanks so much.

Absolutely wonderful.  Since there was too much for the 9 inch pan I made one 9 inch and one 4 or 5 inch one.  We wrapped the smaller one and put a bow on it for my neighbors to use for Thanksgiving dinner.  She told me later it was so good she decided she was not sharing it!  So she put it away to save for them to have after all the family went home!  LOL

I have made this several time, I like to make it in a graham cracker crust.  It get rave reviews.  I am often asked to bring it when I offer to bring a dessert.  It is very creamy and a disappears quickly.

Fabulous cheesecake! I made it as written. It didn't quite firm up in the middle as I would have liked. I put it in a 10" springform pan.  Will be making this again soon!

Just finished making this for the third time. I’ve only made 5 cheesecakes as of yet and just because I’m not very experienced doesn’t mean I don’t know what excellent food tastes like. This one is simple and fantastic and a real crowd pleaser. Thanks for the recipe!

wow! I've made this about four times. Each time I've had rave reviews. I made as others suggested. Everything at room temperature, combine cream, cornstarch, and vanilla in separate bowl then stir into cream cheese mixture. I baked for an hour and twenty \ thirty minutes. Then let cool in the oven for another hour and half. Chill in fridge overnight in pan then remove.  Its my new favorite recipe. Now need to experiment with different flavors. Thank you!

Best cheesecake. This has made me famous lol. I use 2/3 of the heavy cream because it just holds better. I've made it over a dozen times. I just recently started addressing a crust and I like the balance of texture Better this way. My not-so-secret is 1/2 graham crackers and 1/2 vanilla wafers. ;) Oh definitely cover the bottom of springform or water will seep in and ruin. I make half recipe for a shorter 9 inch cake and cook 30 min uncovered and then 20ish minutes with loose foil on top. (My lame electric oven likes to burn tops)

I usually don't care much for cheesecake at all, but this cheesecake is very rich in flavor and has a light, creamy texture.  Mmmmm, mmmm!  I always assumed that cheesecake would be difficult to make too, but this was super easy and absolutely perfect!  I actually did a half recipe, so I only needed to cook it for about 40 mins to get the internal temperature to 150.

This cheesecake, like any other, should be pretty jiggly in the center once you turn the oven off.  You then let it cool in the oven with the door ajar for 30 min.  At that point, run a knife around the outside, leave in on the counter in the spring form pan until 100% cool, then refrigerate overnight before slicing and serving.  The key to know is that your cheesecake will never LOOK done.  Just check internal temp or go by the time and have faith that it's fine.

I made my daughter's birthday "cake" with this recipe (one 10 in. layer and one 8 in.). I added some pink food coloring, and decorated with strawberries and cupcake frosting, to go with the Strawberry Shortcake theme. It was a hit! Everyone said it was delicious, and many had seconds. I'll be making all my future birthday "cakes" with this recipe.

EVERY time I make this I have to make 10 copies of the recipe to follow!  The first time I made it, it took A LONG time to cook, just keep checking it, but once you have the time down, LOVE IT!  I did make 2 minor changes, I put a small graham cracker crust on the bottom and made a chocolate ganache for the top, this is now my official "birthday cake"!

Served this at Christmas and everyone loved it!!  This was the first cheesecake I ever made and it was easily better than anything I ever got from the deli!! I had to leave it in the oven for 15 minutes longer than called for in the recipe in order for the center to set up. Turned out great!

This recipe is perfect It was a big hit I made sure all the ingredients where room temperature mixed well buttered and flowered the pan added eggs one at a time
I did leave about 1 inch of room for the cake to rise it rose to the top while baking and when it shrunk it was a nice size I made mini cheese cakes with the rest I bake it about 1 hour longer for a firmer cake loved it

The name speaks for itself!  Really good recipe.  I just tried it this weekend.  I was just wondering if you have any tips on how to remove it carefully from the cake pan (bottom part).  This recipe is very creamy and mine just sticks right on to it.  Thanks!

This cheesecake turned out wonderfully and looked just like the picture.  It was my first attempt at a cheesecake and I was pleased.  It was an easy recipe.  I had to adjust the cooking instructions a little because I do not have a roasting pan.  I used a deep dish pizza pan, put a soaked kitchen towel in the bottom and set the springform pan on top.  Because my oven is older and a little off on temperature I had to cook it a little longer to get the firmness in the middle.  I took it to a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  The grandmother of the bride asked me for the recipe!
