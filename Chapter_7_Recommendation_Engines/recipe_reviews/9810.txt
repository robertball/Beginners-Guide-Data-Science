This one's a keeper!  I halved the recipe and still had enough to feed a hungry crowd.  We've nicknamed these "Peanut Butter Monster Cookies" since that is the defining taste. FYI for shopping purposes: an 18oz jar of peanut butter = just about 1 1/2 cups and an 18oz container of quick oats = about 5 cups.  Of course you use double to make a full recipe.  Also, a 14oz bag of M&M's will give you 2 cups.

These have to be the ugliest cookies I have ever made if you follow the recipe.  They were flat and dark and got hard really fast.  However, after the first sheet of them, I decided to add some flour to the mix.  This helped a lot--they looked better and stayed soft.  The flavor of them is awesome! (I scaled the recipe back to make 24 cookies, and for that amount I used 1/3 cup of flour.)

I have used this recipe doubled! believe it or not.And it is very good.The note I have for this says that it is called Monster Cookies because it makes a monsterous batch.So it has to be mixed in a roasting pan.I made this dough up one year at christmas time and kept it in the freezer to take out as much as I needed for cookie exchanges,potlucks,and christmas parties etc.So I wouldn't have to keep making up cookie recipes and it worked like a charm for that purpose.And the texture and appearance of these cookies baked looks like a New England Jumble cookie.All in all very good cookie.

I have had this recipe in my collection for years.  The only difference is mine calls for 2 tablespoons of maple syrup instead of the 1 1/2 teaspoons of corn syrup.  These are chewy and rich and are the cookie I'm asked most for at work.

Awesome recipe, mine didn't go flat.  Mine are good looking cookies, contrary to other reviews.  Made the cookies into balls and flattened them only slightly on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Baked them at 350 for 10 mins and let them finish cooking for 2 more mins on the cookie sheet out of the oven.  In my experience using parchment is key to turning out great cookies.  They are crunch on the outside and chewy in the centre.

Made half a batch and it almost overflowed my kitchenaid mixer.  I would not have wanted to try and mix this by hand, it is a very stiff dough.  Also used chocolate chips only, no m&ms.

A wonderful cookie recipe!! This is truely THE monster cookie. The recipe is pretty forgiving too. Once I completly forgot the brown sugar and they still tasted okay. I like to use 1/2 rolled oats and 1/2 quick oats, real butter and using JIF peanut butter makes a big difference. You can add whatever you'd like; nuts, different chips, coconut, raisins. But always good with the choco chips and m & m 's yumyumyumyum!! And I forgot to mention that obviously this makes a lot but they do freeze well!

These cookies are fantastic! They are thick, chewy and are perfect with milk. I added butterscotch chips also. I made the cookies big and cooked them for about 14 minutes at 340. Don't over cook them. Some warning though - add the first couple cups of oatmeal to your mixer, and then stir by hand the rest of the oatmeal. I burned up my mixer.

A very good and very easy to prepare recipe for Monster Cookies! Made these today b/c I was craving all sorts of flavors (I had a taste for PB, oatmeal, chocolate, butterscotch - you get the idea!).  The only change I made was to add a little bit of everything I had on hand - butterscotch, semi-sweet, milk and white chocolate chips, M&M's (a couple packages of candies are fine - no need to buy a large bag of baking bits).  I was able to clear out a lot of odds and ends in my pantry (hooray!)  These are now my "everything but the kitchen sink" "monster" cookies (monster b/c they DO make a MONSTER batch - perfect for bake sales).    Used a large cookie scoop (3 T.) to form cookies and baked for 13.5 minutes and they came out uniform in size and chewy.  Goes great with a tall glass of cold milk : ) Oh, and these keep well - a little crisp, but easily softened when dipped in liquid.  Thanks!

My first time making monster cookies although I bake a lot.  Followed recipe except I was out of corn syrup so used molasses.  I made half a batch and got 40 cookies.  Mine were large but not Monster size- 1.6 oz (45 grams) each.  I baked the first sheet for 11 minutes and they were great fresh out of the oven but my boys love "under-baked" pretty chewy cookies and 10 minutes was perfect for them.  I refrigerated my dough and the cookies baked up perfect, kept their shape, spreading a little but definitely not flat,  soft chewy centers, crunchy on the edges. Will make again.  Update:  kept well, if you're not getting the texture you want try a combination of quick cooking and old fashioned oats- the quick style makes fluffier, taller cookies, the old fashioned will give you chewier, flatter cookies.

Very disappointing recipe - I had to toss the whole batch because they were dry and flavorless (unless you count an overwhelming peanut butter taste). I don't understand all the rave reviews. The only thing I did diffently was used baking butter instead of margarine. Maybe that was the problem.

Recipe makes a pretty tasty cookie. However the monster cookies I remember as a child were called monster cookies because they were huge, about the size of your hand! These ones I doubled the recipe and followed it precisely, using a 2" scoop for portioning the cookies as instructed. The cookies came out slightly larger than a normal sized cookie, but by no means were "monstrous." Also I was supposed to get 144 cookies and I only got 115. I'm a baker at a retirement home and my residents sure would have liked to have more than one cookie each last night; unfortunately I went against my better judgement and trusted the recipe would yield as much as it says. Heads up for those who NEED to make A LOT of cookies!

This recipe is great, I got tons of compliments and the cookies last a while.  My local grocer doesn't have M&Ms so I just used choc and butterscotch chips.  The advice to cook just before they look done is also crucial to keeping them soft!

Perfect exactly as written!  I use an ice cream scoop when making these as gifts, and it makes exactly 3 dozen big, pretty cookies. I bake the big ones for 15 minutes and let them rest on the pan before removing them to wire racks.  Oh, and I never have margarine, so I use 1 cup butter instead.

These are probably the best monster cookies I've ever had. Definitely take them out just before they done so when they cool you have a nice chewy texture. I also cut the sugar in half (personal preference) and find them plenty sweet.

I love this recipe, but I tweak a few things to make it a little healthier. I sub steel-cut oats for rolled ones (this makes the cookies a little chewier, but I like it that way) and nix the white sugar and corn syrup completely. This makes a hearty, filling cookie that isn't (half) bad for you. I chow on one of these bad boys with a cup of coffee for a super filling breakfast.

I halved the recipe.  I also ground half the oats into a flour in the blender for a smoother dough.  I added in chocolate chips, m&m's, peanut butter chips, and peanuts.  They turned out pretty tasty.

These are great! I did add 1 cup of flour and used a mixture of swirl peanut butter- choc. chips, semi sweet, M&Ms, and walnuts.  For the peanut butter I used half creamy and half crunchy.  They turned out fabulous!!  I will be making these again!

This is the best Monster Cookie recipe ever! I found the same recipe on a different site and have made this for several years now! I've altered it at times when I didn't have the exact ingredients, but usually, I follow it to a T! I do typically use milk chocolate chips as my husband likes their flavor better... and I have used peanutbutter chips and even white chocolate chips in this! All with great results!

I have made this recipe for 20 years. I use crunchy peanut butter and always use real butter. They are always good. You can also freeze the dough in balls and bake as needed. I owned a B&B and baked cookies every day. These were always a hit

I wanted to point out that an 18 oz. jar of peanut butter equals 2 cups (not 1 1/2 cups like another reviewer posted).  So you'll need one and a half 18 oz. jars of peanut butter to equal the 3 cups needed for this recipe.  I like to use the crunchy kind.  Great recipe!!

My family thought these were excellent.  For those who thought these were hard, I suspect you cooked them too long.  They actually softened up after I put them in a plastic container.  They seemed to soften up over night.

Instead of putting chocolate chips in we put in 1 cup of M&Ms.We liked it this way .We also thought that we couldn't taste the peanut butter.We were a little surprised.I'm surprised that alot of other people thoght they tasted like peanut butter.

HOLY HUGENESS!  Talk about a giant batch of cookies, but I tell you what, they are worth making at least once!  Don't let the amount of eggs, peanut butter or oatmeal scare you!  I used a jar of crunchy PB, I bought it by mistake and I am the only one who likes it.  I love the extra crunch it gives.  I also ended up using a combination of regular m&m's and peanut butter m&m's.  My kid's are loving the combo.  This is surely a make again!  However I am going to try and half it!

Love them!  I ate these as a kid but could never find the recipe that my friends Mom made.  Looks like this is the one - no flour is the trick.

I have made these several times and love them!  I made them again last weekend and I think a little big more corn syrup, butter instead of margarine, and using a jumbo-sized cookie scoop then baking for 11-12 minutes makes them PERFECT!  Also, a warning for those using your mixers - I have a Kitchenaid and had to add the oatmeal a cup at a time since the dough is so big - and then had to pour into a bigger mixing bowl to hand stir the M&Ms and chocolate chips in.  Thanks for the recipe!

yum yum yum yum yum....have I mentioned these are downright tastey?  I can cook a lot of things, but cookies rarely come out right for me.  These were perfect!  I followed recipe exactly.  Be careful with bake time it's kinda hard to tell when they are done... they will be a little soft when they first come out but will firm up a little.  I agree with another reviewer, the promonant flavor is peanut butter.

I added walnuts and more m&m's, and it turned out good, but the cookies were hard to shape with all the goodies in them. Must make them smaller than what the recipe says, otherwise they are huge. I also added a little salt and a few tbls of flour.  Good base for a cookie!

Perfect cookies! I have a gas stove and I would recommend cooking them for 12 minutes. I added walnuts and it was good! I think I'll add more nuts next time, perhaps pecans.I think I'll add raisins next time as well. I gave mine a Halloween twist by using purple, black, and lime green Halloween MM's.I ended up freezing s batches (8 cookies each) and separting them so I can make a batch whenever I want or need to.In order to save your mixer, hand mix everything from the point you add baking soda.Great recipe!!!

I love these cookies and so does everyone else that tries them.  It does make a big batch.  So when I do make them, I bake half of the recipe and freeze the other half for another time.  They turned out wonderful!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  It's chewy and crisp, as well as offering a variety of good tastes and textures!  What an excellent treat if you can't decide which kind of cookie you want to munch on!  I under-bake these cookies (I only bake about 10-11 minutes) to maintain chewiness.  I also make them a little smaller to yield more cookies.  It's hard to stop eating them!

These cookies are very very good.  They come out great each time.  I make them at least once a month.  I use a cookie dough scoop to place them on the cookie sheet and I don't flatten them.  They are NOT dry, crumbly or tastless.  Just make sure you mix it well.

I thought that they were a lot of work for too little payoff - I thought they were dry, however, a couple of family members liked them.  I won't make them again, but I did pass the recipe to someone who did like them.

I thought this was a very good cookie, but nothing out of this world.

It did make A LOT of cookies.  I made 60 BIG cookies.

I used only 2 cups peanut butter (as this was all I had), and it was still very peanut buttery.  I also used honey instead of corn syrup, because that's what I had on hand.

I used white chocolate chips in place of the candy pieces... very yummy.

This was nice for a change in pace :)  I would make these again.

Ok one thing I will say is that I will never attempt to make these biscuits (cookies) again while trying to loose a few kilos. The day after i made them I had consumed my total days calories by 9am! So yes they are fantastic and I am the fussiest biscuit known. I used the recipe converter  for an Aussie to cook. At the same time I tried another recipe on the same page and it didn't come close to this one as far as I"m concerned. And as for the kids Umm I'll get back to you :)

These cookies certainly do have a little bit of everything! I love the peanut butter flavor, and I had to leave out the chocolate chips because I sent some overseas and I didn't want them to melt. I kept about half, which still filled up the entire cookie jar, so be warned: these make A LOT (in case the 9 cups of oatmeal didn't give it away)! They stay very soft, and I think these would taste even better with reeces pieces.

Fantastic recipe - I made these again tonight and they do not disappoint!  Like everyone else says, if you follow the recipe without changing the yield, you won't be able to fit it all in the mixer.  Tonight I changed the yield to 12 cookies, and I got 21 cookies using a regular size cookie scoop.  In the past I have just made half of the recipe, and it made lots.  They are so yummy you don't have to worry about them hanging around!  Also, I prefer to use butter instead of margarine in this recipe.

I have made this exact recipe MANY times and it turns out awesome every time!  I get SO many compliments from all who taste them!  I bake them for 12 minutes then let them sit on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before transferring them to parchment paper to cool completely.

It is really good, but a tad dry. I replaced margarine and corn syrup with butter and maple syrup. I added heath bits and coconut.

These are good but I think next time I'll add a lil more peanut butter or PB chips to bring out the flavor.  I halved the recipe as we have no need for 72 cookies.  Only had to bake for 13 min to get perfect chewy cookies.  My kids love them so they are a keeper.

Made as written scaled for half of a batch.  Our family loves these cookies.  Used Reeses Pieces on top for enhanced peanut butter flavor as well as fall colors.  Great cookies!

These cookies do not last long at my house.. I usually double the batch so I can share a few, but it still doesn't seem to be enough. I am not a huge semi-sweet chocolate chip fan, so sometimes I do use the milk chocolate chips instead. Of course this makes the cookies a bit sweeter, but we don't mind!

These where very good cookies and fairly easy to make, but not my favorite.  I found that I needed to bake them for 14 minutes or they were to gooy for my taste.  At 14 minutes they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I used butter instead of margarine, and also crunchy peanut butter.

Love this recipe, putting  patter in the fridge for at least one hour is a must or it will be way to runny. My Husband loves these cookies.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! I brought them to work and they were a HUGE hit with co-workers and roommates a like :)   The only change I made was to sub honey for corn syrup (didn't have any and don't like using it) and I forgot the baking soda!  I halved the recipe and made 3 dozen (or a little more). I baked them for 11 minutes at 350, and then let them sit on the pan for 3 or so minutes, and they were moist and chewy.

I changed out the margarine for butter, corn syrup for honey.  The cookies turned out awesome and disappeared very quickly.

Excellent!!!  I only made half a recipe because I didn't have enough oats on hand, it made plenty of cookies anyway.  Next time I'll make the full batch and freeze some.

This recipe is delicious and healthy! If you are looking for an all-organic cookie, you can use all organic ingredients for this recipe, and still get the great taste and sugar rush you are searching for! If you take the cookies out five minutes early, they will cool gooey and moist, which in my opinion tastes better! Be ready for a delicious dessert!

I made these to send to my long-distance boyfriend in the first package I ever sent him. I think I set his standards a little high - HE LOVED THEM! He keeps asking me when I'm going to make them again. I was SHOCKED at the amount of dough this recipe made though. My arm got quite a workout from mixing the ingredients. In the future I will definitely cut this recipe in half.

Love, Love, Love this recipe. I used to buy Monster Cookies from some Amish that lived near by, then they quit making them. I searched and found this recipe and it's an exact match, my kids and husband are so glad I can make them now.

These cookies are wonderful!  We had a recipe for them before but lost it, and these are every bit as good.  My husband and nephews have eaten entirely too many, which is proof that this recipe is wonderful.  I didn't think they were dry, and true monster cookie recipes never use flower, so I didn't use it either, and I'm glad.

These cookies are GREAT!! I didn't alter anything and they came out perfectly. My fiance and our roommates loved them. They might not be the prettiest cookies but, they aren't ugly, they look just like oatmeal raisin cookies and they are not too chewy and not too crunchy. I will absolutely be making these again.

I made these yesterday and they were fabulous. Yes they are a flat cookie but very chewy and yummy!! I put reeses pieces, milk chocolate chips and peanuts in the mix. I cut the recipe in half and then froze most of the batter because it still made a lot.

These cookies are everything WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used an icecream scoop to portion the dough.  I wrapped them individually and we ate them from the freezer for two weeks!  My kids LOVED them.... we are making another batch tonight.  This recipe would be GREAT for a bake sale.... I guessimated the ingredients cost me about 10.00.  The recipe made 36 giant cookies (you can only bake them about 6 at a time on a regular cookie sheet...) and I would charge 1.50-2.00 per cookie.  That would net at least 50 bucks!  Can you tell I am a scout mom??  hee hee!

I cut this recipe in half,and still had a ton of cookies!! Thank goodness they were good! My mom came over for a visit last night, and loved these.  She's not much of a cookie person, but said these were more like a candy. I didn't have M&M's on hand, so I threw in a handful of coconut and double the chocolate chips.  Very very good.

I wasn't as impressed with these.  They were ok- but nothing to rave about.  They don't bake very well and fall apart in your hands even after increasing the cooking time.  I won't make these again.  Sorry :)

these cookies taste really good.  i did have to modify the directions a bit.  i baked them at 325 F for 10 minutes.  also, they did turn out a bit flatter than i had hoped, but still taste quite good.  i would make them again.

Good Recipe!  These cookies have everything I wanted.  Good texture, taste and thickness and I cooked them for 12 minutes so they are nice and chewy.  I added extra chocolate chips & chopped up Peanut M&M's. Yummy & colorful!

These turned out pretty great. They're huge. I added a little of everything I had (semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, M&M's), coconut, marshmallows and I used chunky peanut butter. I think I'll 1/2 the recipe next time, though. I ended up with way too many.

I have been making a recipe like this since I found it in a cookbook from 1980, however, the ingredients are doubled. You have to make it in a large soup pot, hence the name "monster", and it takes the better part of the day.  I have found that with my oven I bake them at 360 for 11 minutes and leave them on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing them.  They will be fine after they have cooled so you don't want to bake them until they look done or they will harden too much as they cool.  They stay soft and chewy for several days.  Everyone I've given them to really likes them.

I cut the sugars by half. I could have cut it further as it's plenty sweet. Everything else I followed to the letter. I used my professional Kitchenaid stand mixer with no issues.

I think this recipe is perfect, and they taste just like my Grandma's recipe (which I can't find, darn it). To the people who think they need flour, Monster Cookies aren't supposed to have flour. That's why they spread out to "monster size." If you bake them properly, they will have a crispy bottom and chewy middle. Delicious!

These are amazing! Nice big bowl with lots of goodness! Made giant cookies that cooked well all the way through. 
I had a hard time getting the m&m and chocolate chips to stick in the dough but when the cookies baked they puffed up and held all the candy together! PERFECT! YUM!

This is a perfect recipe if you use butter instead of margarine, skip the corn syrup (unnecessary) & double the vanilla.  Don't be tempted to add in flour - the dough is pretty sticky to handle, but the cookies will bake up perfectly without it!

I made these for my "dessert-a-month" client at her request and they were a huge hit! I used my medium-sized scoop and flattened them very slightly with my fingers, baked them on my baking mat for 13 minutes and they turned out perfectly! The cookies were tender in the middle and crispy on the outside. I made no changes or substitutions. I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

I made a half batch and cut the peanut butter in half and used crushed butterfingers instead of m&ms and chocolate. These turned out more like a granola bar than a cookie. They were flat and sticky. Don't get me wrong they taste good but far from a cookie.

I have made these cookies many times now. I just love them. I tried it with the chocolate chips and M&Ms but my favorite is without any extra ingredients just the plain old ordinary cookie and they are awesome!  I also used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and they turned out just as good.  Shared the recipe with family and they loved it too. I'll make them again for sure

Yummy, gluten-free, hearty and sweet.  Easy to make. I will freeze half the dough in balls for future baking. I halved the recipe. It's a keeper!

Made recipe as written (with Grandma following Melissa's wedding) but used butter, super chunky peanut butter and used 1/2 Quick Oats & 1/2 Old Fashioned Oats. Spooned into 2 oz balls and slightly pressed onto baking sheet with fork. Cooked some for 11 minutes and let sit on baking sheet to continue cooking, then also cooked some for 12 minutes & put directly onto cooling rack - both good.

Great cookies! Followed the recipe exactly. They did turn out a little flat but otherwise good. I will also be cutting the batch in half next time, this is definitely a monster recipe.

My mom used to make these when I was a kid and store them in old bread loaf baggies; they fit perfectly in there and I just remember being super impressed by the loaf of cookies! I am not sure why, until i made them today, it just occurred to me to mix them with my hands (with gloves on, sub sandwich bags in a pinch) when adding the oats, and form them like little hamburger patties! super easy, and the same size every time. oh, and aside from using butter instead of margarine, I change nothing! thanks!

Amazing. Everyone will ask for this recipe. I "healthified " it a pinch with evaporated cane juice and organic brown sugar and also brown rice syrup vs corn syrup and they were still amazing. Easily the best cookies to make to impress someone. ;) and they bake so fluffy and chewy and flawlessly

This is my go to cookie recipe. When the grandkids come, they head for my cookie jar. I have cut out some of the sugar. Sometimes I just add dried cranberries. Years ago I used to bake giant ones and mail to grandchildren in California. Now cooking for greats and younger grand children. Probably been using this recipe for 25 yrs.

I made these last night. Everyone raved how great these were. I added everything as written..but used almond butter with flaxseed. .some regular organic peanut butter and more almond butter. I also added 1/4 cup flour and a packet of vanilla pudding mix and butter not margarine.  I did not bake the cookies until hard..I baked them until they started to turn brown and took them off to cool. They were most delicious. .gooey and very soft.  The amount of people that liked these increased with each taste.

This recipe makes a lot of cookies and it's a good thing because they are amazing! My husband, my children and I all love these cookies. One thing that I strongly recommend is making sure you allow them to cool as instructed for a few minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack, they come off the cookie sheet easier if you do.

We have made this recipe several times.  The best Monster Cookie recipe ever!  We probably use a little more than what is recommended for the corn syrup.  We don't measure.  But I think a little more helps them to stay chewy.

I have made this recipe for years and it is a family favorite. It really is an addictive cookie.  Perhaps that's why the recipe is so large!  A word of caution, for best results, measure oatmeal carefully.  A little too much  oatmeal results in a dry crumbly cookie.

I use this recipe all the time. We farm & have a large active family. I have been asked to bring this recipe, almost every time we send care packages for the basketball or volleyball varsity buses. Good balance of protein/complex carbs/quick energy. You do not need to add or change a thing to it. I use a large scoop and put about 6 cookies on a 12X17 cookie sheet. I don't press them out, but leave them to bake in the scooped shape, and bake for no more than 12 minutes,. I start checking them at 11 minutes. They will look slightly underbaked in the center.  When I remove the cookies from the oven, I allow them to set up on the hot cookie sheet for a few minutes, then I transfer to a cooling rack or cold, flat surface when they start to hold together.  As with all homemade treats lacking preservatives, package them in an air-tight container immediately when cool.  I believe the corn syrup keeps them chewy. The only hard cookies I've had are those last pans I've forgotten to check and overbaked! If you are really particular about wanting cute cookies, try adding the M&M's individually on each cookie after you've scooped the cookies, making faces, etc..however, that's an easier job for the little kids!  We've used team colors M&M's. Good Luck!

I have made this recipe several times now and the other reviewers are correct.  This is THE monster cookie recipe!  They make a nice, chewy cookie with awesome flavor!  I like a chewy texture so I used the half old-fashioned and half rolled oats and baked them just until they appeared slightly under-done, took them out of the oven and let them continue baking on the cookie sheet another two minutes.  They were just right!  Kudos to the reviewer that said she used molasses instead of the corn syrup.  The small amount of molasses gave them a fuller, richer flavor.  Also, you can put any kind of candy or nuts in them that you like; I put in Heath Toffee pieces and pecans.  Oh  my, were they yummy!

These are now my go-to cookies that I bake for parties and to give away.  I always get tons of compliments and requests for more!  Just be sure not to over-cook.  What makes them good is the chewiness!

Holy cow does this recipe make a bunch!  I substituted butterscotch chips for candy pieces and it turned delicious.  This are not very soft and get crunchy quickly.  I had to mix these cookies together in two very large bowls as they wouldn't fit in one.  I will make these again, but half of what the recipe calls for.

I use this cookie recipe (often with some variation) to feed an army, literally!  Every year I have a batallion or Army unit help out with an event and as a thank you, I bake these cookies.  I usually end up making at least a double recipe and mix the dough in a plastic storage tub.  After they've cooled, I'll put one or two in a ziptop bag and stick a label with the ingredients on it (especially important with the peanut butter in there).

My first batch of cookies tasted a little bit on the blah side. I would have given the recipe 2-3 stars except that I did find a way to save them (which was fortunate since I don't know what I would have done with such an enormous amount of batter). I ended up using every last bit of leftover Christmas baking "stuff" ( butterscotch chips, chocolate swirl chips, peanut butter m&ms, semi-sweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, mini m&ms, peanut butter chips). Yeah. That definately made them great! I will now call this my Everything cookie. It really was great, especially with the butterscotch chips to make them sweeter!

This does take awhile.  They are truely monsterous!  Very good recipe.  We liked them "just" baked.  The one pan we over-baked was a little hard, but still tasty.  Added this one to the "recipe box"!!!

These were pretty good.  I wanted to use up some peanut butter and oats, so it worked for that!  The mixture almost overflowed my Kitchenaid; it makes a ton!  Our family wasn't able make a dent in them, so my husband took them to work and they were polished off in no time.

This was fantastic! I had to have my husband stir in the last 3 cups of oats, and the choco chips and M&Ms, but I baked all of them. . that took about 1.5 hours! Yum!! These are for a bake sale at church. . .you can't go wrong with monster cookies for a bake sale! I have 6 dozen to sell, and still more than 3 for my family to enjoy! Thank you!

My Grandma gave me this recipe years ago, my cousin & I have a picture of us making htese in our jammies when we were about 13. They were so much fun. I make them now every christmas for the cookie exchange in our neighborhood. Its easy- not so fast- but certainly fun! 
I make the original recipe that calls for the 18C of oats.... 
I type the recipe up & turn it into a christmas card to go along with the christmas plate of cookies i give.

I found this exact recipe in my church cookbook - each time I've made it, it has been too runny, so I added 1 cup of flour for 1/2 batch.  My recipe also called for 3 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  Maybe less would have helped.  My kids loved the cookies and sure couldn't keep them for long!  They make great gifts!

The only change I made to the recipe was halving it, and they turned out great.  There is no need to add flour, just watch them carefully and pull them out when the edges are light brown.

Very tasty. I cut the recipe in half and I'm glad I did, because my little mixer wouldn't have been able to handle the full batch! It still made quite a few monster-sized cookies. I wouldn't change a thing, other than adding some more M&Ms!

This recipe is good if you are looking for a "flat" oatmeal based cookie.  Very chewy and good for about the 1st day.  After that I put them in containers and within a few days they all stuck together.  They are just a flat cookie with no desity to them.  DONT get me wrong, they are a tasty cookie, just not what I was hoping for.

These were okay, but more hard/crunchy than we would like.  We would have preferred a more chewy cookie.  Tried varying the baking time, but that did not solve the problem.

We made half a batch and it was still a lot of cookies.  We ended up sharing with my son's class.  All the kids loved them.  I used to have these when I was a kid, but couldn't find the recipe to share with my kids, it's good to have it again!

Everyone loves this recipe.  I made some and took them to work.  It was such a hit that the next pot luck we had they MADE me bring some in and give them the recipe.

I have never had so many compliments on such an easy cookie!  Even non-sweet eaters ate this up!  I will never throw this one away!

This is one of the best cookie recipes out there, kids pick these cookies over any other on a plate. They are tasty and packed full of goodness.

I love this cookie! All of my favorite things -- oatmeal, peanut butter and chocolate. And it's easy. What's not to love?
