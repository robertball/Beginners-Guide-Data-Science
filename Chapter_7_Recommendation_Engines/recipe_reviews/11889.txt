I usually hate it when someone rates something 5 stars and then procedes to tell you the tons of changes they made, but here goes: I made this for a 4th of July gathering and made a few changes. I used 1 lb. of large macaroni. I used three cans of soup and almost 2 cups of milk since my husband said it wasn't cream enough after a test run. Since other reviews said that the flavor wasn't strong enough, I grated a block of extra sharp cheddar cheese and used about 3/4 of it in the sauce and sprinkled the rest on top. I also used 2 T. of spicy brown mustard instead of regular. You'll need to make extra crumb topping if you make this much. It turned out really well and there were NO leftovers and several requests for the recipe.

I was attracted to this recipe because it doesn't call for eggs (baby is allergic) and I'm not at all sorry that i opted to go with this one.  Not only was it tinker toys to make, but I had everything on hand to whip this up quick.  I liked the bread crumb topping & I will double it next time.  Thanks Corwynn- 2 for 2!

Really easy recipe, but didn't have a strong enough cheese flavor for my family. I'll add some sharp cheddar to the leftovers, maybe that will be enough. Also needed some salt. Very bland to the adults, but my 4 year old ate it well.

It was just two kids and myself this evening and I was originally looking for a stove-top mac and cheese (without Velveeta) to quickly throw together when I came across this recipe. This is very easy and super fast with pretty good results. I added approx. 6 oz. freshly grated sharp white cheddar cheese and left out the bread crumbs and didn't bake it. Just cooked and drained the pasta, mixed the sauce (plus the cheddar cheese) poured it over the pasta, stirred and left it on low for a few min while finishing up the rest of the meal. Worked out great. I also added lots of black pepper and a little dry mustard right before serving. I would use this again for a very fast, easy side when we are craving mac and cheese and I don't have any of the blue box mac and cheese in the house. Thanks for sharing.

I sometimes make a mac'n cheese using the cheddar soup as well, but I like this one better.  The one thing I will still do, however, is use cheddar flavored fried onions on top.

Great recipe! It was hard to find one that would be creamy instead of firm. I think I mixed in more mustard than I was supposed to because it was pretty strong. But anyway, the creaminess is most important and I loved it!

This was ok - nothing to write home about. I used 98% fat free broccoli and cheese soup and also added in Sharp Cheddar cheese as well as 2 slices of Provolone (needed to get rid of it) it still didn't seem to have a very Cheesy taste. I am glad I tried it but won't make it again.

This recipe was delicious and very easy.  I added in a couple handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese to give it a stronger cheese taste and added a little extra milk to make it creamier.  Leftovers were almost just as good as it being fresh out of the oven.  I will definitely be making this again.

I would not typically use cheddar soup for mac & cheese but my kids kept complaining my mac & cheese was dry.  So i tried this recipe and like others I was surprised that it was pretty good!  Huge hit with the kids.  Creamy and moist.  I did not add the dry mustard (kids do not like the taste) and I did not have bread crumbs.  I would make again for the kids = quick and yummy

I thought this was great!  I could not tell that this had been made with canned soup when it was finished.  I used evaporated milk.  I multiplied this recipe by 5 and cooked that amount divided between two Nesco roasters for a crowd of 30 people.  (I did add 2 pounds of shredded cheddar cheese when I did this for added cheesiness.  The equivelent for a standard recipe would be around 6-8 ounces.)  Thanks for a great shortcut recipe!

I made this as the meatless dish for my son's birthday party (feeding about 60 people). I upped the recipe and made a few changes. I used 2 lbs of macaroni, 4 (11 oz) cans of cheddar cheese soup, 3 cups of milk, 1 tb and 1 tsp spicy brown mustard, 1/2 tsp pepper, 2 pkgs of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I topped the macaroni with about 1/2 pkg sharp cheddar cheese and an entire can of cheddar fried onions. Tons of compliments.

Very easy recipe. I too added shredded cheese but I also added a few dashes of hot pepper sauce. Gives it a zing and there is no need for salt. When I didn't have room in the oven, I've even put it in my warmed slow cooker.

Easy to make and tastes better after it sits for a day.  I ended up using 2 cans of the cheddar soup and 8 oz. container of sour cream to the recipe.  I added cheddar cheese to the mixture and then sprinkled cheese on top.  I also added parmesan cheese on top once it came out of the oven.

I halved this recipe, and used Campbells 98% Fat Free Cheddar Broccoli soup and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and while it was good as a munchy sort of side-dish, it still wasn't quite cheesy enough for mine and my boyfriend's tastes. This is a good recipe, however if one is watching their fat and cholesterol.

It was creamy but the flavour was just off. It was kind of sweet (maybe from the soup?) and that just didn't work for my husband and me.

Good recipe. I modified as per some of the other reviewers. I used 2 cans of cheddar soup, 5 cups of noodles, 2 cups sharp cheddar, and doubled the breadcrumbs and it was amazing. 
I don't know if I could go back to the boxed stuff again it was soo good.

This is surprisingly good. I didn't expect much from a can of soup and a dab of mustard, but this dish was actually decent. I would make this again. I did add an oz of velveeta cheese since it was all by it's lonesome in the fridge and needed to be used in something. This was creamy and a fast simple way to fix mac and cheese. Soooo much better than the blue box! I didn't bake mine and I didn't use the bread crumb topping, I just served it after mixing in the sauce. Thanks Corwynne this is another winner!

I made this and it pretty much tasted like Kraft mac and cheese to me.  I was also surprised to see the same exact recipe on the back of the Cream of Cheddar can.  I will look for more a creative recipe next time with different variations of grated cheese.

We love this recipe.  I added some shredded Colby into the mix and on top.  I also used whole milk, which made it extra creamy.  We'll be making this again!
