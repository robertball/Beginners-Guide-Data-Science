My family absolutely loved these cookies. I did not have the plain oatmeal cookie pouches but did have chocolate chip oatmeal ones. I doubled the recipe and used two of the cookie mixes. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. They were delicious and gone in a flash. Very easy too!

VERY EASY- I ADDED CHOPPED PECANS- THE MIX GIVES THE COOKIE A LITTLE MORE CINNAMON THAN I LIKE IN A RANGER COOKIE- COOKIES WERE ACTUALLY BETTER NEXT DAY- MY KIDS LIKED THEM ALSO--
