Wow - now this is a vinaigrette! And just as the submitter states - it's a light and lovely salad dressing that lends itself to a simple and elegant salad. This was so easy to put together and was perfect accompnaiment to a Thanksgiving meal.  And I must say I'll definitely be making this for other special occasions. It's a great combination of flavors and everyone enjoyed it. I did opt to used canned pears along with a little bit of the juice vs. a fresh pear. I also used a very nice Chardonnay for the white wine and after it was done blending I did add just a touch of honey for sweetness.  This definitely gets better over time and thickens up so be sure to make it the night before. This was fabulous over a mix of butter lettuce, dried cranberries, chopped apples and pears, toasted walnuts, and topped with goat cheese crumbles. Great recipe!

This is without a doubt one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. I loved how the combo of the sweet and the tart blended so well with a Northwest inspired salad. Rather than use fresh pears in the dressing, I did use 3 home-canned pear halves. The rest of the dressing was made exactly as written and will be made many times more. Incredibly delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very delicious dressing, especially when made with home canned pears.  My pear wasn't quite as sweet as I would have liked, so I was glad to have had Avon's first so I knew the difference!  As with all salad dressings, this gets better as it sits so the flavors meld together.  Yum!

I made this as written using light olive oil rather than extra virgin.  When I first tasted it, I thought the white wine (I used a nice chardonnay) was overpowering, but it seemed to mellow out as it sat, so I would suggest making this in advance.  I don’t think my pear was very sweet, so I did end up putting about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar in it which made it just right.  I served this on a salad of mixed greens  chopped pear, toasted pine nuts and feta cheese.  Very good!  I’d like to try it with apple next time.

Meh....I was hoping this would be a really different tasting dressing.  The ingredients really looked good to me, that's why I made it. It just tasted like vinegar with mustard in it to me.  I wouldn't guess pear at all.  I think next time I will increase the pear and only put it 1 tps of mustard.

Delightful!   I neglected to peel my pear and it didn't seem to make a difference.  I could not find white balsamic vinegar, so I used brown and I used yellow mustard, per personal preference.  I served it over a chopped veggie salad and it was wonderful.  This will be a regular in my salad dressing rotation.  THANK YOU, jill tall!

Awesome!  I would not use canned pears for my taste, like some others did.  I prefer the less sweet dressing I had from my over-ripe pears.  I did not have white balsamic vinegar, so used white wine vinegar instead, so as to keep the color light.  It was fantastic.

Very tasty dressing!  Great for winter  salads. I didn't have white vinegar, so I used the dark balsalmic.  I used about 1/4 cup oil.  Makes a lot!

This recipe was made for my daughter's bridal shower and it received rave reviews.  I served it over a mix of dark greens with dried cranberries, roasted almonds slivers, slices of fresh pear and let the guests choose either goat or parmesan cheese.  Easy and scrumptious!

My husband and I took a trip up the coast (hwy 1) in California.  We stopped in a small town named Cambria and had dinner at Madelines.  They served this pear vinaigrette over bibb lettuce with Roquefort and cashews.  It was to die for.  I recreated it with this vinaigrette and it was fantastic.  Not sure what tiny tim did wrong but this was great!! - geezy62

Wonderfully light, slightly sweet vinaigrette, and simple to make.  I was very happy with this dressing on a winter salad with greens, fruit, pecans and feta.  I made it with regular balasamic first but have since tried with white balsamic.  Definitely better with the milder white and it looks nicer too.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe! As is, it makes a lot.  I used it on a salad with arugula, Gorgonzola, and walnuts and it was delicious.  Sometimes vinaigrettes can be too sweet, but e pear was just mild enough and the garlic gives it a kick.  Will definitely make this again, next time to impress guests!

I wanted to like this dressing.  I used fresh pears and moscato wine -- following the recipe exactly.  I served on a red leaf lettuce salad with green apples, carrots, and feta cheese.  The dressing is bland. I had to add more salt and pepper every time I served it.

This dressing was just okay to me.  I thought the white wine was a little overpowering but maybe it will mellow out in the fridge.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I made it for a salad course ,  my only change was the white balsamic I had was a cranberry infused. I don’t think that altered the taste much. You really could not taste cranberry in the vinegar.   I did only half amount of dijon.   I would recommend highly.

Somewhat sweet but good if adding Gorgonzola or feta to the salad greens. I didn’t use wine but had a pear vinegar from the farmers market that I used. It gave it a lot of depth. Filled a pint jar

I thought this was a tasty, light dressing.  I didn't have white balsamic, so used regular balsamic vinegar.  Also, I used 2 pears, instead of one.I was in a hurry, and decided not to peel the 2nd pear.  The blender did a great job, so there's no bits of skin in the dressing. Other than that, I followed the recipe. With tons of pears on my tree, I'll definitely be making this again, but will try it without peeling either pear.

Similar to Trader Joes but without all the chemicals.

Made it exactly as written, we can't get enough! Lovely dressing for summer salads with fruit. I also used it as a marinade on tuna steaks, superb!

I doubled the recipe but used only a 1/2 cup of riesling wine, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar glaze 1/2 tsp white pepper.   It takes a few hours for this to mingle......lovely color and consistency.   Flavor is unique and wonderful.

Love it! If you don't have white balsamic vinegar, regular balsamic vinegar works just fine! I used Harry and David pears...yum,

I was worried about the strong vinegar taste that a vinaigrette can have so I used a tad less and I added a pinch of sugar as my pear was not very ripe but I don't think I needed it. OMG this is a great salad dressing! It is light and tasteful. I am not a salad person but wanted a healthy meal. I scarfed down my salad with no guilt afterwards. I will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this vinaigrette! I didn't have any white balsamic, so I used white wine vinegar in it's place. I used this to condiment a salad that had crumbled goat cheese on it, and the pear and goat cheese flavors went really well together (blue cheese would have been a great combo as well). Thanks for sharing the recipe!
