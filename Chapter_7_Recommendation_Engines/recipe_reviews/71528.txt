Delicious!! My new roll recipe. I, too, halved the ingredients, but used two pks of the yeast.  I've been trying other roll recipes, but this one is "it". Thank you.

I have been searching for the perfect roll recipe, this is it!  Just follow the recipe and you can't go wrong. I could not believe how light this dough was and the rolls turned out GREAT. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  These were EXACTLY the rolls I remember from school.  Thank you!!!  I read the reviews before I made these and noticed many comments said they were bland, so I looked up typical salt-to-flour ratios for yeast breads, and the amount was off by 2 teaspoons, more if more flour is used while kneading.  (Ratio is 1/2 teaspoon salt per 1 cup flour.)  I didn't have shortening so I substituted butter for that, and since shortening is 100% fat and butter is 20% water (if you use typical butter--European butter has a higher fat content), I used a tablespoon more butter (so 5 tablespoons were used) for rubbing into the flour, and took away a tablespoon of water from the 3 cups.  These were amazing!!!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!

Very easy. I followed the recipe to a "t". Very light and fluffy. Tasty with melted honey butter on them.Mix your honey and butter together. Pop into the micro for about 10 seconds. Pour over the rolls. Yum, Yum, Yum!!!

I made the full recipe and while the dough rose beautifully and the rolls looked very good they had absolutely no taste whatsoever.  I was really hoping for somthing a little better.  I'll stick with the "best rolls ever" also found on this site.  Thanks for sharing though.

These rolls were delicious - just what I was looking for.  I served these right from the oven at dinner, and they were the best part of the meal. I made half a batch (about 24 rolls) and they were all gone the next day - the kids wanted to take them to school for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe, MOMMY2THREEANGELS, I'll be making these again and again and probably during the holidays too. Update:  I like to scale the recipe down to 15 servings and make the dough in my bread machine. I've replaced up to 1/3 of the flour with ww flour. I don't make these as often as my kids request because I usually eat too many (the big reason why I never make a full batch). Enjoy!

My 10 yr old came home from school today BEGGING me to get the my friend (the lunch lady at his school) to teach me how to make the rolls they serve in the cafeteria. It would be 2 days before she had time to get together with me, so I turned to the internet! This being my FIRST time baking bread, not to mention my limited cooking skills in general.....I felt pretty brave just for trying. Well....I hate to admit allowing him to do this......but he ate FOUR of these rolls right out of the oven!!  His comment: "Mom, I never say this about your home cooking but (as he placed his fingers at his mouth and saluted me with a kiss!).....SUPERB!!!"  He then went on to tell me that my rolls blew the cafeterias OUT OF THE WATER! Wow! What a compliment! My heart SOARED and I was filled with pride! LOL. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

These were good and easy. I used 1/2 wheat flour and ended up not using all the dry/flour mixture, maybe a 1/2 cup or so was left. Oh and I didn't roll them out. It was just easier for me to pull chunks off and roll them into balls.

Wonderful!  Just like school...don't be stingy with the time for kneading, it's so important to get that texture right.  Fab flavor!  Making them again today.

Now these are some great, easy to make and tasty yeast rolls.  I did cut the recipe down to 15 and made 14 rolls, placed in a buttered 9x13 glass dish.  I did have to bake for about 17-18 minutes to get the nice browning.  They are light, fluffy and I think the flavor is just what I love!  Served with Brown Sugar Meatloaf and fresh greenbeans with little new potatoes.  What a gourmet meal!

Best darn yeast rolls EVER!!! Kids and husband absolutely LOVED these rolls. Even my husbands' supervisor requested these lovely balls of heaven! He said it tasted just like his grandma's recipe, but she let hers rise on the table overnight and then steamed them until done over a pot! This way is soo much easier and they taste fabulous! Wonderful recipe, everyone must try this one if they love yeast rolls!

Oh my!  This takes me back to my school days for sure!  As other reviewers have said, sure, these rolls could stand to have a little more salt.  But things like that can be adjusted.  The texture, fluffiness, and density of these rolls are what make this recipe 5 stars.  Just perfect, and will absolutely be my go-to recipe from now on.  Oh, and don't be afraid of the dough - it gets really sticky!

They are wonderful.  I make these rolls every Sunday for dinner, and have done for months now.  Instead of sugar in the yeast I use honey.  It seems to grow faster.  I also use quick rise yeast just to speed up the process a bit.  I have also used this recipe to make white bread.  It makes two large loaves.  I usually make braided bread and bake it on a cookie sheet.  It is wonderful every single time.

Outstanding.  We absolutely loved.  Scaled down to 15 and made primarily as directed.  Noting following changes for my records (as I *will* be making these again):  use 3T from the warm water along with sugar to proof yeast; 2 2/3 c flour; 1/3 c whole wheat + more when kneading.  Do knead dough after adding flour - not much, but give it a few nice turns.  Only added about 1T of melted butter after 1st rise and then kneaded for a good 3-5 minutes.  Baked in 13x9" buttered pan and mine did take a few minutes longer to bake - probably around 15 to 16 minutes.  Very nice!

This is, without a doubt, the best bread recipe I have found yet. Very light & fluffy. I added a little more sugar because I like a sweeter bread. Turned out wonderful. I will be serving these at our Christmas dinner.

I made these rolls today as a 'trial run' while trying to find a winning recipe for thanksgiving dinner.  This is it!  Although when I make them tomorrow, I will add about an extra 1/2 tsp of salt or so....  I brushed some melted butter on these before baking to add a light 'shine' to them, and to encourage browning.  These are AMAZING!  I can't wait to hear the accolades!

These were exactly what I was looking for! I followed the recipe to a T (although I scaled it down by half) and they were perfect. My husband and kids couldn't eat them fast enough. I ended up making a second FULL batch the same day! Since then I've made them several times and frozen the dough once the rolls are shaped. They thaw beautifully. I have made one small change though, I started substituting whole wheat flour for 1/3rd of the white flour. They don't rise as high, but the flavor is not affected, and I'm getting some whole wheat into my kids. Thanks for a FABULOUS recipe!

I scaled it down to 12 servings BUT once I had it mixed up I cut the ball of dough in half and made 6 dinner rolls and 8 cinnamon rolls! Best of both worlds! They were so amazing! I did the math myself because I forgot about the "change the serving" button. So my measurements were a little different, and laughable at the way I went about it, but they turned out A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! 3/4 c water, 1/2 tbsp + 1/4 tsp + 1/8 tsp yeast, 3/4 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp milk, 1/2 egg, 3/4 tsp + pinch salt, 2.5c flour, 2.5 tbsp + 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp shortening. I did end up mixing the butter in with the milk in the beginning, oops! I made the dough up and went through the first rise, punched down and kneaded for 2 more minutes. I did use my kitchen aid. Then I halved the dough and formed 6 balls of dough with one half and followed the recipes directions for second rise and baking. With the other half I rolled into a 6x11 rectangle (approx size) and then I smeared 2-3 tbsp softened butter, generously sprinkled with cinnamon, and 2 tbsp sugar. Rolled the short 6" end to the other short end. Cut with floss into 8 even pieces. For cinnamon rolls I preheated oven to 170 and turned off oven, then let rolls sit in oven for 30 minutes covered, took them out & set on top and preheated oven to 400. Then baked for 13-15 minutes. Frosted with 2 tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp milk, 1 c powdered sugar.  The cinnamon rolls were fantastic re-heated in microwave for 15-20 seconds!

Great recipe. Did change a few things though.7 cups of flour instead of 10 and used 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening instead of 1/4 cup shortening. Mixed dry ingredients together, then added milk,eggs and salt and mixed together. Added the yeast and water last, because I heard that salt will deactivate the yeast.I also used the moist towel over them after I rolled them into balls and used salted butter.A+

Halved the recipe, it made 27 good sized rolls. My family raved about these and said they reminded them of popular TR Steakhouse rolls. I'm getting ready to make them again and will be making the full recipe this time. I have found my new roll recipe! Awesome with honey and butter.

Finally, the recipe for rolls like we use to get in the school cafeteria! I did use rapid rise yeast for this. I used my stand mixer and dough hook and let it do all the work.  Make the rolls a good size (golf ball).  I also found that using a round pie/cake pan worked better than a baking dish as the rolls rose more evenly.  Yummy!

These are delicate, tender, delicious, and far superior to everything my school lunchroom ever produced! I made a half batch--now I wish I'd made a double! I will use this over and over and over! I didn't change a thing except method-wise--I kneaded in the bowl, and used the tear-off-and-shape method. I did have to add about a half cup more flour when kneading--it was far too sticky but that's probably something to do with halving the recipe. EDIT: 11/2009: Made these again, using the overnight rise method. Even more delicious. But do be sure to let them reach room temperature before you bake, otherwise the tops will get too done before the middles are done! I gave mine 2.5 hours to reach room temp & ran out of time...so at least 3 hours.

I made this twice, once for my husband, and then for a dinner with 12 people.  All the rolls were gone!  I did not substitute anything.

I don't think that rolls can get much better. I was worried that they weren't rising, but turned out great! Halved the recipe, used .50 ounces of yeast. Soft, big, delicious-tasting with butter drizzled over them. I am NEVER resorting to BISCUITS again. ROLLS are where it's at!

I used this for my 1st time baking rolls and it was a success! Now I use it as a guideline. We eat whole wheat so I substitute 7 cups with wheat and use less sugar. They turn out great everytime! Thank you for posting!!! :) also note: My mother in law is a great baker and is jealous of the texture of my bread! :)

I used this same recipe for the bread machine. I cut the measures by two thirds so that it would fit into the machine. This still makes two pans worth of rolls by the end.  I set the machine too the 'dough' setting which takes about half an hour and rises during that time.  Once the machine is finished I remove the dough and form balls of dough onto baking pans and let them rise again for about 40 mins. Then once I bake them at 400 for 12 mins and they come out like a dream.

I ended up making more of a loaf because I found the dough to be too sticky to make balls, but it was WONDERFUL!  This was a huge hit, and it is something that I will make over and over again.  It was also my first experiment with making bread from scratch without a breadmaker, so it was really pretty easy.  If I can make it, anyone can!

Great recipie, just like my old cafeteria used to serve.  I live in Spain and the powdered yeast we get here is practically worthless.  Once I figured out that I had to use real yeast instead of the powdered stuff the rolls turned out wonderfully.

Yep these are the ones!! Although I do agree with othere reviews that this recipe could use a tad more salt. I feel that is a personal preference and does not take away from the ease of making these delicious rolls. I was looking for a recipe for dinner rolls for Thanksgiving and I think I have found it! Makes plenty and they turn out beautiful. Scaled recipe down to 15 servings and they turned out great! Thanks for sharing and bringing back so many great memories!

I made these rolls for my Thanksgiving dinner for the first time on 11/22/07.  They were positively AWFUL!  They were dry and flavorless.  I think the recipe calls for way to much flour.  What a waste of time and ingredients.  It made 54 rolls.  I had 27 people for dinner.  What a flop.  They went begging.  They certainly weren't anything close to the school rolls we used to get which were high, light, fluffy and delicious.  Don't waste your time making these.

These rolls were good although they weren't just like MY lunchroom rolls when I was a kid!  I like the more doughy, gooey soft rolls.  If you're like me, reduce the bake time to 10 minutes and remove BEFORE the rolls are golden brown.  I also used unsalted butter b/c the recipe didn't say either way but next time I will use salted.  I also used square bake pans instead of the round.

Got on "Recipe Buzz" for a quick answer for a recipe I remember reading for cafeteria rolls. This was exactly what I was looking for. Very easy and yummy. I did half it and use 2 pkg of yeast as another suggested. All those recipes I have tried and now I have it!!

I was fortunate to grow up in a district where the school cafeteria food was pretty darn good.  These rolls are just like the ones I grew up on.  In fact, since my grandma was also my favorite lunch lady, this recipe takes me back to the days when she would bring me some of the leftover rolls to have at home.  The schools also used to use the same dough to make the best cinnamon rolls.  I'll be trying that this weekend.  Thanks for posting!

These did rise beautifully, and it could just be me, but I don't think there was enough salt.  Kind of bland flavor.

Oh my goodness, these are better than what I expected, especially with my bread talents.  :)  This was so easy and not time consuming at all.  And it made a lot of rolls.  Thank you so much this will now be my roll recipe.  I may add some herbs and cheese next time to spice it up.

Even tho this made pretty good rolls, they did not taste the way I remember schoolhouse rolls. To me, they had the taste and texture of commercial white bread..and there's nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Made a half batch of these in the form of garlic knots as my contribution to a friend's dinner. They were a hit. I substituted bread flour for the AP flour.  I found it unnecessary to use a floured surface to roll it out as kneading the butter in made it plenty slick and would have ruined that smooth golden finish that is such a large part of these types of rolls. I brushed them with butter and sprinkled garlic salt and Italian seasoning on them and they were perfect. I would up the salt if I were just making them as regular dinner rolls as they might be a little bland otherwise.

I halved the recipe and it still turned out great. I used a little more sugar just because I like a sweeter bread but other than that stayed right with it. Great recipe for beginners.

I think this was a great recipe. I used it to make pepproni rolls. I was out of milk so I used buttermilk and they turned out awesome and I brushed a egg wash on top before I put them in the oven and brushed butter on them when they came out

We made these at work for fellowship dinner. We make about 150 yeast rolls each week and wanted to try a new recipe. We like the flavor of these but did not care for the texture. They were a bit lumpy from the shortening. Perhaps we increased the batch yield by too much and it caused problems or didn't knead enough? I will try making a smaller batch at home.

Although I followed the recipe to a "T" and the rolls looked delicious before going into the oven, they came out dry and a little hard.  And they didn't puff up at all in the oven..not really sure why.

Delicious, soft, plain white yeast rolls.  If you are looking for a basic soft roll for dinner, this is it!  I halved the recipie (I didn't have 10 cups of flour on hand!). I also cooked enough for dinner, and froze the rest of the dough in balls so I can have fresh baked brea on another evening.  Easy and yummy!

These were not what I was expecting taste wise. They were very bland. I would have given only 3 stars, but I scaled down the recipe and did not make as posted. The rolls had a nice fluffiness and texture was beautiful, but taste was just blah.

These rolls turned out great and i have never made rolls from scratch before. However, it does make a lot of rolls! I should have read the amount of each ingredient first - 10 cups of flour - you will need a big bowl! Yummy though!!

These are the best rolls ever. It is so worth the time and effort. I have made these several times with no problems they are a favorite with my family. Just like the school rolls we used to have when I was little.

I, like other reviewers, am wondering how it is that I really didn't like these rolls, yet others really loved them.  Different strokes I guess.  The rolls in my school cafeteria were amazing and these just tasted completely bland.  The only flavor I could taste was the yeast, which wasn't appealing.  Since it made so many, I threw out lots of rolls.  My family just didn't enjoy them.

I've made this several times now and even my wife has followed the recipe for really good results. This is the 4th time I've done a large batch of rolls for a meal (Tonight was Thanksgiving) and even with volume measurements instead of weight it was close to perfect. Definitely recommend spacing out the dough balls or risk needing an extra 5 minutes to firm up the inside, but they come out fluffy, light, stretchy and a little bit sweet.

I use a kitchen-aid 5-quart for the initial mixing and it doesn't even take an hour to double in size most of the time, but it gets the gluten working.

I love doing artisan breads and long-ferment or overnight breads  but when I need to cook a load of rolls in under 2 hours, this is my go-to recipe.

Only thing I would recommend: Reserve a small amount of melted butter to brush over the rolls just before tossing in the oven. Gives a nicer shine to the top, though you and your guests will be tearing into them so fast they won't care.

For me, this dough was a dream to work with and it yielded fantastic results.  I halved the recipe and made 25 rolls of different sizes.  I wanted some as dinner rolls and others as hamburger buns.  I let the Kitchen Aid mix dough hook to do the work for me.  What most impressed me about the rolls was how 3-4 days later the rolls were still extremely soft and fresh tasting.  So many recipes I have tried are great the day I make the rolls, but the following day or two it is oblivious that they weren't made that day.  For that reason alone, this a definite keeper for me and a recipe I will be using again.

I made these today. They were wonderful and made so many. I have dough left over to make some more in the morning. I shared rolls with two separate neighbor families this evening. They could use a tad more salt next time, but they still were delicious!

This was a great recipe. My kids loved them and they smelled so good when they were baking. I did cut this recipe down to a 20 serving. I am a single mother with two kids so even this serving size is more than enough. The recipe allow for you to adjust and it gives adjustment based on size, but I further tweaked it by using a whole egg, 3 2/3 cups of flour 3 tablespoons of sugar and 4 tablespoons of shortening. My experience with baking allowed me to make these judgements and they worked great for me!

These rolls were awesome!  I even made a couple of goofs in the recipe (not paying attention!) and they still came out light and fluffly and tender.  I did add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the mix.  It made about 40 rolls.  I baked 16 of them, froze 8 of those and the rest of the dough I also froze after shaping it into balls.

I'm sure these rolls are yummy .. however there is no whole wheat flour in them .. we make a roll that has whole wheat flour over 51% (as required by USDA guidelines) and they are YUMMY and the kiddos eat them.

Delicious. It is just like the school cafeteria rolls! I made these for our family Christmas dinner and everybody really liked them. I made the full recipe and they disappeared fast! Went to have one for lunch today & they were gone!

Excellent! Follow the recipe and you won't fail. I found it easier to roll and shape into mini oblong loaves about 3" long, then pressing by hand to flatten about 1" thick rather than rolling them out and cutting them. These are the lightest rolls you will find anywhere.

These are good, but not the taste I was expecting.  Cafeteria rolls were denser and more buttery.  It's a good recipe, but my search for the best rolls is still on.

I decided to try this recipe and these rolls are really good. Almost like the lunchroom rolls I grew up eating. I tried to follow the recipe exactly but goofed it up a few times. It did not appear to rise properly, it was super sticky and I used more oil/butter on my hands so I could form these into balls. I had to bake mine longer and use the broiler to brown the tops. I buttered the tops as soon as they came out of the oven. I also used convection baking. So, this recipe is somewhat forgiving because they turned out perfect. I have never baked a roll in my life but will be making these again.

I found these a little messy to make but well worth the effort.  The recipe makes quite a bit so next time I am going to make half of it into cinnamon rolls.  The basic dough is great.

These rolls are really light and fluffy but I did agree with others that they could use a little extra salt. Needed just a little more flavor.

I calculated this down to 15 servings and I'm glad I didn't use the ingredients for the original 45 servings.  Unfortunately, I'll be tossing these out for the birdies in the morning.  They just turned out oddly.  The texture looked spot on but felt gummy & heavy in the mouth.  I had read the reviews so I increased salt slightly but apparently not enough to combat the lack of flavor.  I'm actually baffled by the result.  I won't be using this recipe again.

I was pleasantly surprised by these rolls-- I wasn't sure, since the name sounds kind of strange, but they turned out awesome.  I used fat free margarine substitute in place of the butter and shortening to cut back on some of the fat.  They were very good with soup or for breakfast the next day, and we thought they had plenty of flavor.  Honey butter is a great idea to make these even better!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is exactly the slightly sweet, doughy roll recipe that I was looking for, and it didn't disappoint!  So easy even a first-timer like myself could do it.  I added an egg wash which made them even more appealing.

These are very dense and lacked flavor..I guess they are okay if you are serving with a pasta dish, or a spicy dish, but for a dinner roll this is not the answer. The schoolhouse rolls I remember were light, fluffy and sweet. I will keep looking.

I made two batches of these rolls today.  I was skeptical at first as the dough felt too dry.  Still, I always follow a recipe exactly the first time.  They were easy to handle when it came time to knead and portion out.  They turned out good but we’re still just s tad dry.  Marco did batch I adjusted and added a wee bit more water.  These buns will be a keeper in our school cafeteria. They make a half sheet pan full - about 30 rolls.

I had to split this recipe in to 2 makings so that I could put in my mixer.  It was very easy to do since you are mixing yeast, eggs, milk and sugar together.  I approximated the 1/2 of all liquid ingredients and added a little water when necessary.  they turned out great!

My dough looked exactly as the video shows and was lovely.  I halved the recipe and made 18 rolls based on the comments of others as I couldn’t believe 10 cups of flour only made 22 rolls. I put them 1” apart.  While raising, they spread out and not up and they never touched while baking as they show in the picture. Next  time aI will not leave a space.  The recipe needs work but has potential.

I am going to keep working with this recipe since I bake by weight and the equivalent weight for 10C of flour yields a dough that is too soft and sticky to form easily. The rolls baked up nicely and had a good flavor.

I halved the recipe. I still used 2 packets of yeast. The only complaint was no flavor. I will definitely increase the amount of salt. I also made one loaf of bread and one pan of rolls. I baked them much longer than 12 minutes. About 18 at 400 degrees or 20 at 375 would be best.

These are the best white rolls out there.  I made these and it makes a huge batch.  I froze 1/2 the dough and then bake the other half later.  Just bring the dough to room temperature and they will rise in the pan.  My grandson ate 5 before we even started eating our meal.  He's a real "doughboy"!

I guess the rolls I had in school were different because these didn't taste like the ones I grew up eating. The ones I had were slightly sweeter, which the kids adored and had another flavor which added to the texture and flavor. These rolls didn't have the sweetness of the ones I grew up with, but I think it could be easily adjusted? I liked these, but they weren't the flavor I was looking for.

Made a half batch an we loved them. I didn’t modify the recipe except to halve all ingredients. Used my KA and has to add a bit of extra flour because it was so sticky. Very tasty!

I made these exactly to the recipe. They had a good flavor but weren't fluffy, which is what I was hoping for. They didn't rise a lot either (may have been too cool in the house).

Yum. I increased the salt by 2 tsps per other reviews. I baked 24 rolls (12 to a 9x13) and then 1 loaf of bread. Bread baked for approximately 20 mins at 350. So, so good. Tempted to start making this instead of buying bread.

Did half batch with a tablespoon of salt as the only variant... Wow!!!! Delicious, and super light. I got 19 large rolls from the half batch. Have a full batch rising now, and hope to get 70-80 smaller dinner roll sized. The first batch got a little too brown and crunchy at 12 minutes @ 400 , so will cook next smaller ones on 375 for 10 min. They are just what I've been trying for! Thanks for the recipe!

They didn't work out for me.  Tasted more like tea biscuits than rolls.  I will be looking for another recipe with more detailed instructions on how to shape the rolls so that they come out perfectly round.

These are delicious! They are light and airy inside and a firm texture on the outside... just like I wanted!
I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I substituted the same amount in room temp butter and pinched that into the dough, but other than that I followed the recipe and it rendered great results! I would like to know how people get their tops to look so smooth. I didn't want to over knead the dough (which could have been my mistake), but I rolled them into ball shapes and placed mine on one large greased cookie sheet instead of round pans. Mine came out looking more like artisan bread on top, but they were still scrumptious! Thanks!

This recipe says prep time 15 minutes, not true.  I consider rising dough prep time, so change prep time to 125 minutes.  15-20 minutes to assemble and mix ingredients 45 minutes each for two rising sessions 5-10 minutes for dough resting and assembling on tray to bake.  Overall though, after my whining about the time, DELISH, don't skip on the butter or rising times.  It was my favorite thing about our holiday meal of crab legs and prime rib.

I enjoyed them.  My dough did not rise - next time I will stir the yeast into the water-sugar mixture to see if that makes a difference.  If the dough had risen, they would have been lighter, but still very good!  I will definitely make them again!!!

I made them again, and dough still did not rise.   My last attempt will involve stirring salt into dry ingredients so it does not kill the yeast...

Rolls taste good & turned out as expected, however they do not rise in the fridge overnight so be prepared to let them rise before baking them. They will be the same size the next morning when you wake up unless you leave them out all to rise.

I cut the recipe in half, but otherwise follow exactly. These rolls are awesome! So light and fluffy - everyone loves them. I get requests for these again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Although my rolls did NOT look like her beautiful picture, they were delicious. I didn't have any shortening, but used salted butter. It was really really good and the kids loved them.

While this is a  good recipe is not exactly like the school recipe. I worked in a school cafeteria for sixteen years as the head cook.  One of my jobs was making the rolls, breadsticks and cinnamon rolls. School rolls contain no eggs, no milk, no shortening , and are not as heavy as this roll. But with that being said this is a good roll. It just has more ingredients, higher in calories and is not as light as the school rolls. Glad your daughter enjoys them and that you take the time to prepare your family homemade rolls.

Made the recipe today, except I made hot dog and  hamburger buns and a dish of cinnamon-type rolls.  I think a wash of egg would have given them the nice shiny quality as shown in the picture.  Also, I made two thirds the called for recipe , but have the luxury of owning my own chickens, so I used Banty eggs instead of the regular size as called for...

Very delicious. This recipe makes a ton of rolls. Good amount for a big get together, but if you don't want as many I'd cut the recipe down in half.

I needed a roll recipe for Easter dinner at a friend's house, so decided to give this one a try. I made a few changes as suggested by other allrecipe members -- such as I added extra salt (3 TBSP in total), used 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening instead of 1/4 c and allowed the rolls to rise again over night in the fridge (Make sure you cover them so they don't dry out). I allowed them to come to room temp before baking to make sure they baked evenly. Bake time was a bit longer than suggested but they were done when the tops were golden. I brushed with butter when done...HOLY COW these are good. Going to keep this recipe on standby for sure...there was literally three rolls left out of this huge batch, and the kids gobbled them down as soon as we got home.

I followed this recipe except I increased the salt to 3 tsp instead of one, per another recommendation. These rolls are exactly how I remember them to be at the school cafeteria when I was growing up. This recipe is a keeper. My whole family loves them. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are the best rolls ever. I made them to take to a holiday dinner and mom says I can make them anytime I want. I did not roll out the dough to portion and opted to use a large cookie scoop and this method yielded almost 3 dozen from the full recipe. Also, after portioning I let them rise the second time, which worked just fine. I will come back to these again and again!!!!

My family almost devoured 24 buns at supper! They were soft and fluffy. I used quick rise yeast and cut out 45 mins of rising time. The recipe made 48 buns. Used a cookie sheet to bake them on.

Made these tonight. I did cut the recipe down to 15 servings. Only other change I made was I added a little more sugar than what the 15 servings called for.  We like our rolls a little sweet. Turned out perfect. Will make again!

This recipe makes big fluffy rolls.  They are wonderful, no complaints.  I am still looking for a yeast roll that will remind me of the Quincy's Steakhouse rolls I used to love when I lived in South Carolina.

I made these for a family birthday luncheon and everyone loved them.  My mother and mother-in-law both had seconds and took some home. I followed other reviewers suggestions and upped the salt to 1 1/2 tablespoons. The suggested bake time was a little long, they were done in 8 minutes at the suggested temperature. They are prettier rolls baked in round pans-I baked some in rectangular pans and they were not as pretty.

this is my first review... OMG! these are soooo good and simple to make. my first batch no one could believe I made them. I followed the recipe exactly (never have had luck at making bread). Today I am in the mood for some cinnamon rolls so to the recipe I added 2 small boxes of vanilla pudding to the dry ingredients. I am waiting on the dough to rise now. mmmmmmm I CANT WAIT!!!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!

Made these to take for a dinner party at my sister's. Everyone raved about how fluffy and light they were. I did add a bit more salt from the first time I made them and it did give them a pop to the flavour.

I made this recipe the afternoon/evening prior to Thanksgiving dinner. Ten cups of flour should tip you off that you need extra baking pans. Anyway, not a difficult recipe but you will need to bake the rolls in a couple of batches.

The rolls are fabulous!  I individually froze them after making balls.  Then follow the recipe when you remove some from the freezer.  They turned out as well as the fresh baked ones.  I've made them a couple of times now.  They are just wonderful!

This is my family's favorite roll recipe.  They usually don't make it 24 hours without being all gone.  My only "amendments" are that I use honey when proofing the yeast instead of the white sugar (I like the taste in the final product--but I still use the white sugar in the flour step) and I use butter flavored shortening, or softened butter instead of normal shortening(also for better flavor in the final product).  Really great recipe!

Easy recipe with great results!  I used my dough hook attachment instead of using my hands. I also ran the dishwasher and used the warm dishwasher to proof the rolls.

Seriously. Awesome. The recipe is so very easy. I halved it and thank goodness I did because my scale is already calling me names. If you can just eat one then please don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you. Thanks for the easy to crowd please and indulge in my carb fetish recipe!

Great as buns for pulled pork barbecue. The leftovers, split and grilled with jam were a hit at breakfast too. Nice recipe, thanks!

LOVE THESE ROLLS. They're delicious. Follow the recipe you can't go wrong. Don't listen to others changing the recipe. Then, they complain  that recipe didn't turn out right.

Perfect rolls. The only change I made was to add a tiny bit more salt than called for, perhaps 1/4 teaspoon, as per another member's suggestion. I've made these twice and will again and again as they get scarfed down instantly. I cannot recommend the recipe strongly enough.

These rolls were deliciously light and fluffy.  However, I did make a few changes.  First, I halved the recipe, but I used 2 packets of the yeast, 1/2cup sugar instead of the 1/3, 3 1/2cups white flour and 1 1/2cups whole wheat flour, I started with 1/8cup milk but ended up adding about a 1/4 milk or a little more because of the thickness the whole wheat flour brings(although I added the extra milk after all the ingredients were in just to pull the dough off the bowl), 3tbls. shortening, and 3tbls. butter.

Fabulous! I made it exactly as the recipe said to and I love them! Better than any dinner roll I've ever had. Right now I have a pan of frozen ones on my stove. Tomorrow morning, I'll know if it works to freeze them in the pan before the last rising. Next time, and there will be many "next times," I'm gonna take someone's suggestion and use part whole wheat flour and honey, so I can pretend they are good for me...

It worked; they were fine after freezing. I left them out and covered all night. I should have baked them longer, though, maybe 15 minutes more.

Yes, yes, yes!  Fabulous warm, light, fluffy mounds of deliciousness!!  Don't improvise, just follow the recipe and be sure to let them double in size on the last rise!  We devoured them with butter and honey - YUM!!!!

Tried the school house rolls and compared them against the "old family recipe" this one was much easier and the rolls were a big hit. I added just a smidgen more sugar on the first kneading. We ran out of rolls within a couple of hours. They were GREAT.

I tried the recipe, making 1/2 the original. I was greatly disappointed.These turned out without much taste to them. I was looking for a recipe that really enhanced the yeast in the taste.Gonna try Sweet yeast rolls next.

Loved these. Have been looking for a soft roll recipe for ages. Halved the amounts but needed less liquid, but apart from that they were great.
Could I freeze the dough - before or after rising? and does it really rise in the fridge overnight?
Thanks for the recipe MOMMY2THREEANGELS !!

Going to have to try this recipe.  They look just like the rolls they made when I was in elementary school, they also used them for hamburger buns, yummy. The
fragerance was wonderful, nothing like fresh baked bread.

Perhaps I did not understand well when the direction said "you could refrigerate it let it rise in the fridge" so after the first rising and rolled them into balls in a pan I placed them in the fridge which of course stopped the rising process. I had however another set outside and this one I will  the process by placing in the fridge and bake tomorrow. Any ideas what to do with the unrisen dough?

I made a half batch of rolls.  The flavor of the rolls was great, but the texture wasn't.  They didn't turn out fluffy and light like so many other reviewers found.  I think there was too much flour because mine wasn't very sticky before baking.  I'm going to try these out again, reducing the amount of flour, and hopefully they turn out as wonderful as others say they were.

I loved how the rolls rose and were so fluffy. They looked identical to the rolls in our school cafeteria. Although, the taste was not the same. They need something....can't quite put my finger on it....maybe a bit more sugar. I love this recipe, but would like more flavor. I brushed on some melted butter when I removed them from the oven, which made them beautiful. My husband ate three. He loved them!!!!

This recipe is the closest one I've found to the rolls they used to serve in my high school. Absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe & it made about 20 rolls.
