Spiral-cut the cucumbers and did not salt them, as we wanted to eat this right away.  There are many dill-cuke recipes on this site, and although we enjoyed this, next time I would use less olive oil (just our taste preference).  This one is a "dieter's delight!"

Perfect side dish for a hot summer day. I skipped salting the cucumbers and doubled the dressing (personal preference), this recipe is spot on. Love it!

We have been keeping a fresh batch in the fridge.....replacing as the previous runs out!  It does not last long around here!
  I did change the vinegar to apple cider vinegar & we add onions or chives or both.   Also, used local honey instead of sugar & left out the salt.
