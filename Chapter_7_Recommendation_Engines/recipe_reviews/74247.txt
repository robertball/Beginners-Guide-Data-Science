This was a very tasty and low-fat meal.  I followed the recipe as it was. The only flaw was that the directions say to add taco seasoning and it's not in the ingredients.  I added about 3/4 of a packet.  Used combination of fat-free cheese and regular cheddar.  Also used the green chiles, instead of jalapenos. Garnished with a dab of low-fat sour cream as well.

VERY spicy if you use one full packet of taco seasoning!  My family likes spicy, so it went over well- just a warning that it was hot enough to make my nose run!

I had high hopes for this recipe with all of the 5 star reviews.  I like the concept of the filling ingredients, but neither my husband or I liked the sauce.  I think you would be better off with a canned enchilada sauce.  I like the salsa idea.  I may try this again, but I'd like to work on making the filling more cohesive and improving the sauce.

This is a very good recipe, it just needed spicing up.  Fills you up but not out. Instead of 28oz Tom Sauce, I used 16oz salsa & 2/8oz cans of Tom Sauce.  Doesn't say how much taco seasoning to use so I added one of those premeasured envelopes.  I baked covered without cheese topping for 15 min.  Applied cheese after removing foil & baked for another 15 min.

I have to say I was extremely sceptical about this recipe. I was sure it was something only a health nut would think was tasty. However I am happy to admit I was wrong. Both my husband and I loved this. I ended up using a combo of salsa and tomato sauce as per another review. Also, I used lean ground beef b/c it was lower in calories than the ground turkey that was at my grocery store.

This was highly rated, and while I was making it I was really beginning to wonder. The broccoli seemed like it would overwhelm the rest. But after all it was very good! And it made a very nice presentation, too. I made the red enchilada sauce by 'sara' to go with this instead of the sauce in the recipe.  (the sauce from sara is great).
Thanks we all liked it!

My husband and I loved these.  I was surprised how not broccoli like it tasted.  I'll definitely make it again.
