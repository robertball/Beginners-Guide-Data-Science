I used frozen salmon berries I had stored for this recipe. It turned out great! The cake stuck a bit when removing from the cake pans, I will flour the pans next time. My berry syrup was not sour, but the cake not was not overly sweet either. A little whipped topping was all that was needed. Great summer cake.
