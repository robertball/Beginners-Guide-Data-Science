I was really lazy with this drink, but it turned out really good.  I didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I used the regular.  (keep in mind...much more sweet!!)  I didn't add the chili powder because I wasn't sure how it would taste, and I didn't want to ruin a perfectly good cup of hot chocolate, so I wimped out on that part.  I had to add 3/4 of a cup of cold milk because my chocolate was really sweet and I didn't strain mine.  I had to reheat it a bit, but it tasted really good and I like the idea of using chips rather than cocoa powder.  Thanks Drew.

This hot chocolate was sooo good!  Warm and rich with a little kick to it.  It was just how I would imagine the hot chocolate to be in the movie Chocolat!

This recipe immediately caught my eye because my hubby's name is Drew, so I just had to make it. It's one of those days anyway where I'm craving chocolate in any way, shape or form. I didn't have any chocolate chips in the house, so I subbed with Hershey's syrup. I was literally eating spoonfuls of the syrup as I was making this. Well, Mr. Drew, I must say that this is absolutely fantastic!!!! I'm sipping as I'm writing and LOVING every taste. I'll definitely make this for the kids when they get home. Thanks so much!

Great stuff.  It is a bit grainy, but it's really chocolatey and reminds me of the spicy truffles my aunt made once (except it's a drink).  Give it a try!  (Upgraded my review to 5 stars because I've made this drink a million times.  I think it's going to make me fat!)

Hot chocolate for the true chocoholic, Drew! This was soooo rich, just the way we like it here in Rainy Northwest. I made it with espresso powder and little more than a dash of chili powder. WOW!
This is a keeper. And I think for summer time, I'll put this mixture in my blender with some ice cream. What a great shake this would make! Thanks for sharing.

Whoa - this was chocolately!!  I love chocolate, but this was a bit too much - I thinned it with additional milk and it was still a bit much.  Next time I will try 1/4 c chips instead of 1/2 c.  I loved the mix of the spices - this is definitely a "gourmet" hot chocolate!

Delicious!  The cinnamon adds a really nice flavour and the chili gives just a subtle "kick".  Very rich and great on a cold, snowy house-bound day!  Thanks for sharing this, Drew.

Oh this is fantastic! I LOVE chocolate, so this was nice and sweet for me. Some whipped cream on top would be divine! Instead of microwaving it, I melted the chocolate, and then heated up the milk on my stovetop in a small sauce pan. This is what I did: 1 Cup semisweet chocolate chips, let those melt completely to a smooth consistency. Add 1 cup of milk, wisk until well combined. Add another cup of milk and again wisk your heart you. The more you wisk it, the better it mixes together and the creamier it gets. I used 1.5 cups of milk in total. After it was all combined I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Heat it up to your desired temperature and pour into a mug!  I've tried it the microwave version first, and it was grainy as other people have complained. Doing it on the stovetop I had no graininess! Enjoy this fabulous recipe!

This was the best hot chocolate ever.  Omitted the coffee-- and only had milk chocolate chips (which I don't even like, they were bought by mistake), but did everything else- including pouring thru a metal strainer.  So good.

Best ever.  I had extra hot (habanero) powder so used very little, and my cinnamon was a drop of essential oil.  Otherwise followed pretty close and WOW!

This was delicious, but personally a bit too rich for my taste. I thinned it quite a bit with skim milk. Still, the chili/cinnamon/chocolate combo is a winner, and the coffee gives it a considerable jolt.

This was good, but for special occasions only. I didn't have a problem with non dissolved granules, because I stirred everything really well in very warm milk. It is rich and filling, but too much to have on a daily basis.

to get a spicy bitterness, i used bittersweet chocolate chips, and also tripled the amount of cinnamon and chili powder, adding an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of milk (i've made it twice already).  after all the ingredients were in, I churned it for 1 minute with one of those handheld devices.  it made it much lighter, fluffier, so that it was still rich, but no longer heavy. churning it also eliminated the graininess others reported---i would still strain it before though, for the ultimate smooth texture.  my family could only take a shot of it because it was so filling---but they LOVED the unique flavor.  next time i am going to add more milk so that people can actually handle a whole mug of this---a dark chocolate lover's wish come true.

The hot chocolate was ok, but as the recipe suggested, it definitely needed to be thinned with more milk, otherwise it is like drinking chocolate syrup. It was good enough, but I think I'll keep looking.

This was an amazing recipe!!! I cooked the chocolate chips and cold milk on the stove and used a whisk so i didn't have to strain it, it came out delicious. i added way more then a pinch of chili powder and it gave it a nice kick. i will be making this again.

Thick, rich, and delicious. I added more chili powder for a kick though. It's very quick to make too. I dont think I will use instant hot cocoa mix again. Good job Drew. You've outdone yourself.

Awesome. I didn't strain, but used a mexican hot chocolate "frother" that made it even creamier. I used Hersheys Special Dark chips, and added extra milk. Thanks, Drew!

Well, it was very rich and thick.  Very tasty though too!!  I didn't strain mine, and I think next time I will make sure to do that.  I also added a little more chili powder, and that made it darn tasty!  I'm going to be making this one over and over.

Different, but good.I used 2 sq. Ghiredelli semi-sweet choc. and the  rest choc. chips, used a mixture of skim and 2% milk. Because I found the coffee flavor a bit to strong for me I used a bit more milk and nuked it to heat it up some more.
next time I would do half the coffee amount.Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

I made this using vegan carob chips since it was the only form of chocolate I had on hand during an especially rainy day. It still came out great, the perfect blend of flavors! I will be making this again, it's super easy and very comforting!

Just the thick and rich - with a kick - hot chocolate recipe I was looking for! I did add a spot of half and half to thicken it up more, and picked a hazelnut-flavored coffee, but the recipe as is would have still been terrific.

Fantastic. I didn't have chocolate chips so I sweetened up some cocoa powder. Added a touch of vanilla just to see how it tasted. Love the chili powder and coffee flavor. Try it!

Marvelous!!!  I just made this and it is wonderful.  My only criticism is that it is a touch on the sweet side.  I would definitely add even more milk at the end.  I love the idea of chili powder, it adds that little something that you couldn't pick out was missing if it wasn't there.  I just had hazelnut-flavoured instant coffee on hand, but it still worked nicely. You could use different flavours to make a nice variation on the original recipe. This is going into the 'favourites' section of my cook book for sure.

I'm drinking a version of this as m typing this review, and let me say, IT'S AMAZING! I say version, because I really only used this recipe as a guide, because I only has chocolate chips, and no cocoa powder. I used about 3/4 cup of milk and a little over 1/2c. Of chocolate chips. I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I left out the chili powder, because I feel like hat would be really weird, and instant coffee and instead I added a little over a teaspoon of really maple syrup. So good! Creamy, and chocolatey and delicious!

This was to DIE for!! It is a "10*" recipe! I loved that it was thick and it took care of my chocolate fix! I think I overdid the cinnamon but it made it better! I did not have instant coffee in the jar but I had these maxwellhouse coffee singles (they look like tea bags but with coffee) and I cut the bag and put the coffee from that into the mixing glass I used and it came out super yummy! Thank you Drew!

Made a bunch of this and served it at a party and received many compliments.  I wound up adding quite a bit of milk to taste, however, since the recipe makes very rich hot chocolate.  People detected the cinnamon but were surprised to hear about the chili pepper!  Good recipe, just expect to use about 1.5x the milk/water the recipe calls for unless you like drinking chocolate syrup.

I was craving hot cocoa and had no cocoa powder in the house... and I am so glad that I didn't!  This is wonderful.  Thick and rich, and the coffee, cinnamon, and yes, even the chili powder, add such a depth of flavor that I can only say you have to make it with the chili powder.  The only change I made was to melt the chocolate and milk on the stove and then heat everything together, rather than use the microwave.  This is definitely "sipping" chocolate, as it is very thick and rich.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I can't wait for the next cold night to warm up with this.  Might try it with a touch of cayenne next time, to have a little more heat at the back, but wonderful as is.

THIS...is AMAZING!!  So I used milk chocolate chips because that’s all I had and also because I was making it for my kids and their palates aren’t exactly keen on what actual chocolate tastes like with ten tons of sugar dumped into it.  I actually quadrupled the recipe because it’s the first really raw day of the fall up here in Maine and everyone wanted cocoa in front of the fire.  I used cayenne pepper, some Maxwell House International Cafe Français I had lurking in the back of the cupboard, and the really nice Saigon cinnamon I keep for when I actually want to taste the cinnamon I’m using.  Then I substituted the last 1/2 cup of cold milk with the same measurement of light cream, served it to the kids with some marshmallows and twenty minutes later they’re asking me for more.  Mine I hit with a splash of Bailey’s, which was also excellent, but would be better if I’d had semi-sweet chips I think.  It’s juuuuust this side of too sweet with the milk chocolate.  Seriously though, this is favorited and going to be my go to hot chocolate recipe going forward.  mmmMMMMMmmmmYUM!!!!

WOW!!!!! I was leery of the combo of flavors, but it was incredible. I used one and half cups of milk—otherwise it would be way too strong—and also heated up all the milk so I wouldn't have a lukewarm drink.

This is too sweet for my taste (yes, I used semi-sweet, still too sweet), perhaps next time I'll use half semi-half cocoa...

In terms of time-quality correlation, this is great for being a 5 minute nuke chocolate

I made this exactly as directed, but after everything was mixed together, I strained it through a sieve and cheese cloth. I recommend making this in a glass measuring cup with a spout so it is easy to strain.

I was inspired to try this out after reading some of the reviews.  I couldn't find my Ghirardelli hazelnut hot chocolate so I melted a 1/4 cup of milk chocolate chips in just over a 1/2 cup of milk then added just under a tsp of hazelnut instant coffee.  Added another 1/2 cup of milk to even out the sweetness and sprinkled on some cinnamon.

Delicious!

The taste isn't too bad (though I'm not a fan of cinnamon) but even after straining the drink has a powdery texture. I couldn't drink it and ended up dumping it down the drain.

Delicious! Like the recipe says, I thinned it with more milk because it was extra rich!  But it's better to start rich and thin it than try to make a thin recipe rich! If folks had a grainy brew it's because they didn't let the milk get hot enough to dissolve the coffee.  Try Folgers Singles - it's like a tea bag of coffee - or add crystals when the milk is hotter and whisk, whisk, whisk!  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for it!

Excellent for a windy and chilly "spring" day.  I would suggest adding more milk unless you really want a thick, delicious syrupy chocolate drink.  Another flavor addition:  I added a fresh mint sprig to the milk mixture as it was heating.    This is so rich that I probably shouldn't make it on a regular basis...but I WILL make it again for a special chocolately treat.

This was a great recipe. I was a little wary about the coffee, even though I love coffee, but it was great. Every ingredient was evident in the taste and it was wonderful. Some people suggested adding more milk because it was to sweet but I don't think so. I did add about a tsp. of vanilla though. I also found it didn't really make enough for two people. I'd add maybe a half a cup of milk or more, a 1/4 a cup more of choc. chips, and maybe a bit more of the chili powder, coffee, and cinammon. You get the point.

I rated this 5 stars because my husband and I loved it. Anything with a little kick gets a thumbs up from me. But my kids would probably rate it a 2, I had to add a lot of extra milk to get them to drink it. I think they would have liked it better without the extra spices. 
 
 But still an A+.   :)

This was excellent, nice and thick and rich.  Nothing like the watery powder mix from the grocery store.  I have been looking for a hot chocolate recipe like this.  I had all the ingredients on hand (except for heavy cream…I really wanted whipped cream on the top)!!  I added about ½ tablespoon of chili powder and only a smidge of cold milk.

It is almost 95 degrees outside today, I cannot wait till it is cold and snowy to really enjoy this!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My children loved it and asked me to make it again before they were finished.  I don't think I will ever be able to give them the package stuff again.  We will definitely make this again and again.
