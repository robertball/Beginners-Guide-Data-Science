I love this recipe, however I made some modifications.  I added more curry, and also cayenne pepper, chili power, and red peppers...I like my food spicy.  Also, I made the sauce and broiled the fish.  That way the fish wasn't falling apart and disinigrating into the sauce (like some other members have said).

I love fish but this recipe didn't do it for me.  I love curry and think that if I would make this again I would specifically pick up fish balls at an Asian market or just use chicken instead.  The chunks of fish just fell apart and didn't taste like fish anymore, plus the consistency of the fish in general was just strange.  The curry itself was wonderful but I will use fresh veggies next.  If you are in a hurry though, the frozen mix is a great option.

Thought it was an excellent dish.  I used tilapia instead of cod and fresh  vegetables sauted that I already had in the refrigerator.  It was quick and easy and the best tasting Indian dish I've made yet.  Highly recommended.

This was absolutely delicious!  Taking the advice of prior reviewers, I broiled the fish separately.  I sprinkled it with the seasonings, broiled it whole for 10 minutes, then broke it up and added it during the last 5 minutes of cooking.   I used fresh veggies instead of frozen and sauteed them 5 minutes before using them in the recipe.  And just for the heck of it, I put some of the seasoning in the rice while cooking it, to give it a bit of flavor.  We will definitely be eating this again!  I can't wait to try it with shrimp and/or chicken as well!

Very quick and easy recipe to make, and a good fish recipe for people who don't like to eat fish. But overall, lacking in flavor. I would definitely suggest adding more of the spices since the dish comes out tasting quite bland. The fish tasted good since it was cooked with the spices, but the sauce and vegetables didn't have much taste.

My favorite curry recipe on this site so far. Delicious! I will try with chicken next. 
This dish does need a lot of salt! It will taste bland if you don't add enough. Try it.

Spicy, but suitably mellowed by the coconut milk. I used fresh vegetables (but I take the point for the reasons to use pre-packed stir fry), as they are so freely available in Spain generally.  It looked a treat with the rice on the plate, and it went down well with the Memsahib.  Thank you .... another nice recipe for the home portfolio.

I do not like fish at all, but I am trying to eat it for health reasons, and this was very good! I used 12 ounces of frozen cod fillets, cut up. I used lite coconut milk. I also used Lundenberg wild rice blend for rice. It all eventually ended up together in a skillet and it was great! Even my 15 year old daughter who also hates fish thought it was ok. Will definitely make again.

This was a great, easy, fast recipe. I used frozen vegetables, an assortment from Trader Joe's, but next time I will steam a different assortment. The level of spice was right for me. I broiled tilapia and will definitely try other fish in the future. Thank you for a great recipe.
Also, I omitted to cornstarch due to food allergies and loved it just as it was.

This was delicious with Trader Joe's Roasted Vegatables, instead of stir-fry. I also served it over orzo instead of rice. Our local Thai restaurant serves it's curry slightly sweet and I added 1 T brown sugar to the sauce, which was just perfect.

Holy fish curry batman, this was so YUMMY! The only thing I did differently was to use coconut oil to saute the veggies and I added cilantro because the hubs loooves it! Served over brown rice. My fish didn't fall apart but I left it in pretty big chunks. I also didn't find that I needed to thicken it with cornstarch, it was pretty thick already.

I found this recipe bland. I am not sure what I could do to improve it either. My husband cannot handle much heat, so I am at a loss at how to spice this up without burning my hubby's mouth. I was not impressed and will look for another curried fish recipe.

I love fish and love curry but this was not for me!  The fish fell apart and was all together very weird for me, and it was very very runny no matter how much cornstarch I tried to use.  I would recommend if you are going to make this to use fresh veggies as the frozen ones added the the runniness of the recipe.  I think if I where to ever make this again I would use chicken and not fish, but I'm probably not making this again.

Really enjoyed the dish. I used leftover brown rice from previous dinner. Was easy to make. Will use more fish next time.

Going heavy on the spices gives this dish a little more flavor, and even with all of the garlic, some serious garlic salt helped quite a bit, too. In the end, this is a quick complete meal, although hubby would probably rate it a 2 or 3. I don't have much experience with cornstarch, but I couldn't get it to blend in. Once it got piled on the plate, DH didn't notice the lumps, though.

Nice mix of flavors... VERY quick and easy, and plenty of room for adaptation-- Even for fish/spice phobics!! Great consistency without the added cornstarch for thickening. Served over rice-- Yum!!

This is delicious!!!!!Hereare my modifications. I used Orange Roughy instead of Cod becaue we love Orange Roughy. No need for the cornstarch since the sauce was already thick thanks to the coconut milk. We didnt use forzen vegetables nor did we cook our vegetables with the fish. We made steamed carrots and cabbage in separate pot as well. We added some BAdia Complete seasoning to the fish as we are islanders so we love our food super seasoned. As you can see we made black beans and rice and not the brown rice. This meal was fabulous!!!!!

I feel this was very bland. I even added more spices but something is missing as I had to over salt it just to be able to taste something.

I am sorry but it didn't work for me. No wonder there is no picture uploaded for this dish, It's not appealing at all and I cannot taste any coconut or anything else but hot curry.

Such a great dish, and so easy! Even my curry-hating DH liked this one, as did my 1 year old. He was shoveling it in his mouth by the fistful! (the 1 y.o., not my hubby, lol!) I left out the chopped onion because the veggie mix I got had onions in it, so that made it even quicker.

I love this recipe. We had some rock fish to use up and this was a perfect fit. I added some tumeric to the rice as it cooked and it gave it a nice flavor and the pretty yellow curry color. I used a oven baker instead of stove top. I baked the oil with the onions and garlic first. It worked great. Might have to add a little more salt to taste. Even the kids enjoyed this one!

I thought this dish was pretty good, but found it a bit bland.  It was easy and a good way to get my bf to eat fish because it masked the fishy taste pretty well.  With the addition of some extra salt (which I usually don't like) the dish became tastier.  I made changes according to what I had on hand.  I used a bag of frozen peas, corn, carrots, and green beans and added some frozen red peppers.  I cooked all the veggies in the micro before adding to the dish, to cut down on the water being added to the dish.  I used tilapia for the fish and cooked it separately so it would not fall apart.  I just added half of the coconut milk and spices to each pan (the pan with the veggies and the pan with the fish).  I didn't have tumeric so I used a little extra cumin, next time I'll cut down on the cumin and use nutmeg as I think the cumin took away from the flavor of this dish.  I served this over jasmin batsmati rice.  It was very filling and healthy!

If you like spicy food, this requires a lot of doctoring to make it meet that need.  I also found myself adding a lot of salt to it to make it more flavoral.  Once it had a chance to simmer for awhile, the flavors improve.

Loved it.  Not sure how anyone could say this recipe was bland.  I thought it was delicious and so did my bf, although he had to keep taking breaks because it was so spicy (i thought it was perfect!) I did add an extra garlic glove and didn't have tumeric :( Also didn't have corn starch, but didn't seem to make too much of a difference.  Sauce was pretty thick without it.  I cut pretty big chunks after reading some people had problems with it falling apart.  That seemed to work and the fish (not chicken) was very good.  Nice change.  Def make it again.  Oh, also used Lite coconut milk - thought that worked just fine too.

This was pretty good and easy to make. I did use chicken instead of fish based on other reviews and think that was the right decision. I will probably make it again.

I thought this was excellent.  I used Salmon and fresh red peppers, spinach, and peas, and omitted the tumeric as I didn't have any on hand.  My husband who is normally not a fan of curry, loved it.  I would definitely make this again.

The sauce was great.. Has a real thai taste to it. Unfortunately the cod did not go well with this recipe. I will definately use chicken next time.

Great recipe. The type of curry I used along with the other spices created a slightly bitter taste so I added just a bit of sugar to balance out the taste. I also served with Jamaican Peas and Rice instead of plain rice. The family loved it.

So glad I found this recipe! I didn’t have any frozen veggies, but I did have fresh onion, sweet bell pepper and cabbage. I sautéed those together with the garlic. I mixed up the coconut milk and spices in a bowl and added it to the sautéed veggies. Then added the cod. The cod only needed 5 minutes to simmer. Last minute decided to add some basil. Very yum.

I added tomato paste and used hickory smoked sea salt, ginger, and used way more curry. Had to broil fish first. I used flounder instead cod.

I needed to make a quick dinner with the cod that I had on hand and found this. Made some changes:  I didn’t have time to make rice and preferred a lower carb version anyway. Added a little cayenne pepper for heat. Used Silk Almond/coconut milk and dried coconut instead of the can of coconut milk. Added a little Splenda for sweetness along with a handful of golden raisins. My frozen veggies were cauliflower broccoli and carrots. And a little salt. Turned out great. Next time I’ll mix up the veggies and serve over iced cauliflower. Chicken would be good too.

I cooked my vegetables separately to keep them crisp and to give the dish a more colorful appeal.  I really enjoyed the cod this way, it took on a wonderful melt-in-your-mouth texture like sea bass.  I also used a yellow rice boxed rice and cooked it separately as well.  Made for nice colors and different textures.

Very good. I broiled the fish as others had suggested. I only had on small cod fillet, so when I cut it up and added it to the meal, never did find the cod. But will make this again. Probably leave out the fish next time and just stick with veggies.

I liked the combination of spices. The ratio was spot on.  I used chicken rather than fish. I'm not a fan of frozen vegetables so I used fresh sweet potato  (let simmer with the onion, garlic and coconut milk about ten minutes before adding the other ingredients), red bell pepper, snow peas and mushrooms. The cornstarch was not necessary either, was a nice consistency without it. I will make this again and try adding a little cayenne as someone else had mentioned.

it is possible that the frozen fish I used was just old, but the recipe felt like it was missing any pizzaz or kick.   It tasted bland, and i found myself adding more spices after completing the dish.

I thought this was a very good curried fish dish--I personally would not have added any more spices--so I advise anyone perusing these reviews prior to making this recipe to try it first before adding anything--you may very well find you like it as is.  I, for example, am not big on hot spices, so I cut the chili powder by half.  After tasting the finished dish, I decided a bit of sweetener would compliment the flavors and bring out its best--and my husband, who tasted before and after the sweet addition, agreed that was just the touch needed. But all of us are so individual--so try as is, unless you know yourself well enough to change something--but don't assume the rest of us have YOUR tastebuds. I also think broiling the fish separately is just extra work--it was simply delicious when made together with the spices, coconut milk, with the vegetables added a bit later--and "simply" is a key word--why go through more steps and more cleanup when this is so great as a "one pot wonder"?

I really liked this recipe but as always I tweaked it. Season the fish instead of adding the seasonings to the pan.  Added fresh bell pepper slices, cherry tomatoes,  and spanish olives. The olives added a the extra salt that was needed. I served it over boiled potatoes and carrots because I don't like fish with rice.

It tasted amazing.. I added a splash of maple syrup and it was really good. I wonder if one could add mango chutney, raisins or something very subtle. I will try that next time. By the way, cod fillets worked very well in this recipe.

This was very good.  I used green curry paste (you can get it at your local grocery store in the Asian section) instead of using curry powder and it turned out great.  I will make this again.  I would like to try this with chicken too!

Very good!  I didn't find that it needed the cornstarch, and I used fresh veggies instead of frozen, but it turned out great nonetheless.

I made this for a friends and they enjoyed it.  I added a few more veggies than suggested.  It is a really mild curry.  Good intro for people who have not had curry.  The cod was really good, it was almost as if we were eating chicken, great texture and absorbed all the flavors.

I am used to cooking curry dishes so I thought I'd try this recipe. Instead of cod I used salmon fillet and it didn't fall apart. I even turned it over to cook on the other side and it did not fall apart in pieces. I garnished it with freshly chopped cilantro and a spritz of lemon juice....yum!!!!

I really liked this recipe. I am new to curry dishes, but this was so easy. A great go-to recipe since it is easy to keep the ingredients on hand. I made it with chicken, and my brother and husband loved it.

Loved the recipe.  Made it last night want it again tonight.  I liked it the way it was but I think I would add a little more fish (would probably taste good with any meat).  You can also adjust the amount of curry & tumeric depending on which flavor you like better.

I agree with some other reviewers --- this is a decent recipe, but it really does turn out lacking in flavor. It's spicy, but does not have any really distinct flavor to me other than somewhat curry-ish. Oddly, I really couldn't taste the coconut milk at all. Something is missing, but I am not sure what. Adding more salt does not do it. That said, it was pretty good, if you use a good quality fish, and the spice is tasty enough. Just not something I would take the time to make again, since I think there are better fish recipes. I made this exactly as directed, by the way.

This recipe was a waste of ten dollars worth of ingredients...it was bland and tasteless.  Would not make again.
