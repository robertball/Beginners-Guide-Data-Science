This was a quick meal solution.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts.  The flavor was good.  I omitted the lemon verbena.

Very delicious and juicy chicken! I didn't add in the wine, mostly because we didn't have any, but I cannot wait to try the recipe again with the white wine!

Tasty.  I scoured the stores, but could not find any lemon verbena.

Was looking for a quick recipe for chicken in a pan. Made this tonight and it was awesome! Omitted the lemon verbena since I didn't have any on hand. The reduction was easy; the chicken came out moist and flavorful. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Made this with Italian seasoning instead of oregano, omitted the verbena and used lime juice instead of lemon.........everyone cleaned their plates! Definitely keeping this recipe close by!!
