I made this recipe with some modifications based on reviews and just what I thought would be best.  I made 2 cups of my own sauce instead of the chicken soup (bring 1 cup chicken broth and half a cup milk to a boil.  Stir 6 tablespoons flour into half a cup milk then whisk it into the pot.  Cook a minute or so.  Ta da!).  I was afraid the rice would be too dry which is why I made extra sauce.  I also used corn instead of peas and mixed it in at the beginning, and added half a packet of taco seasoning.  I baked it according to the directions and it came out quite well!  I can't imagine how dry it would be with only one can of soup and even with the taco seasoning it was very, very mild, so next time I'm going to use the whole packet.  Thanks for the idea!

Yummy! I added a extra can of cream of mushroom soup.  One and half cans of diced green chilis. One package of chicken fajita seasoning. LOTS of Cheddar cheese on top and inside. Actually cooked it for almost 2 hours stirring every 10-15 min. My husband cant get enough. VERY DELICIOUS and EASY, taste even better as a leftover.

This was pretty good for using just what you have on hand, however it needed either an extra can of cream of chicken or sour cream to make it more saucy.  It was a little dry.  I will try it again sometime with the changes and then it should be a good fall-back recipe.

This was tasty with a few changes…  I cooked the rice ahead of time in chicken broth.  Doing this, there was plenty of liquid with 1 can of soup and 1 c milk.  I cooked the chicken over medium heat in a skillet until the juices ran clear then cut into small bite size pieces.  I substituted frozen corn for the peas (peas didn't make sense to me in this dish).  I only added 1/2 of the green chile and added a can of black beans, rinsed and drained well.  Upon others suggestions, I added about 1/2 package of taco seasoning mix.  I will make this again!

Very good...I did add some chili powder, cumin and seasoning salt.  Next time I think I will try adding cilantro as well.  I baked for 1 hr and then stirred in some corn rather than peas and 1/4 cup chunky salsa.  Topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips and baked for another 10-15 minutes.

This is really good, easy week-night recipe. I made it as-written and experienced the same "dryness" as the first reviewer, but my family didn't mind it at all. I baked it longer than directed, though, based on the feedback of another reviewer and that may have contributed, so next time I'm going to bake as directed and let it stand 10 minutes. Standing time often makes a big difference with casseroles.  I'll also try adding a bit more milk, maybe just a half a cup and see how that works. It really doesn't need much. The flavor is very, very good and it makes wonderful leftovers.

Personally, I wouldn't cook the rice in advance because I think it result in too much liquid, but if any of you experiment with good results please post them!

Yummy - but I felt it needed an extra 20 minutes of cooking to make the rice done.  At one hour the rice was still hard.  Tasted great after that.

This recipe is quick, easy and very tasty. When I added the diced green chiles, I didn't drain them. I also added the original rotele, undrained, and sliced black olives, undrained.  Because I had time, I marinated the chicken in olive oil, cumin, chile powder for 2 hours and browned the chicken before adding.  I DID like the frozen peas and it made the recipe look like a paella.

I love a casserole that's quick and easy, uses things already in the pantry and is tasty. This is definetely it! I added only an extra 1/4 cup of milk and the rice cooked up fully. I'll definetely make this again.

We had this for dinner last night and it turned out really good.  We did take the advice of a couple other reviewers and used corn instead of peas, added a whole packet of "mild" taco seasoning mix, and added an additional can of cream of chicken soup, but used only 1 can full of milk.  It was filling, yummy, and easy to make.  In fact, my 12-year-old is the one who made it!  I think I want to try this as a burrito filling next time!

I have made this recipe approximately five times and have made my own modifications to it, primarily to make it spicier and I added an extra can of the cream of chicken with an extra 1/2 cup rice. Due to the extra ingredients I increase the temperature to 375 degrees and added an extra half hour on the timer. Thanks Kathy for a wonderful recipe that my whole family has enjoyed over and over again.

I also tweaked the recipe a bit. I used 98% fat free soup, skim milk, and reduced fat Mexican blend cheese.  I put in a fresh diced poblano pepper, a few dashes of cumin, skipped the peas, and had a lovely casserole with a Mexian twist.

This was sooooo good!  I did a few changes though.  I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom.  I used diced tomatoes with green chilies and 2 big cans of chicken.  I also used one drained can of corn.  I also cooked my rice in advance.  I also used a package of taco seasoning mix to season the dish.  It was very good and simple to fix.

This is a recipe I will definately make again.  I used brown rice instead of white.  I used cream of celery and added 3/4 cup light sour cream.  Also added a little bit of some pico de gallo I had in the refer.  Boyfriend LOVED it.  Will be making a double batch next time.

I followed others suggestions and added corn, chopped onion and frozen sliced bell peppers.  I used sage, lemon pepper and garlic powder for spices.  I used 2 cans of chiles.  I tried making it in the crockpot and turned the the rice into mush.  However, my husband and 12 yr old son, who are not big casserole fans,  loved it and  we finished the whole thing. This dish was very tasty, but I'll use the oven next time.

I took Shiloh's advice and made a broth/milk/flour sauce instead of the soup.  I also used brown rice instead of white rice to up the nutritional value.  I had to cook it about 1 1/2 hours (covered) and the rice was still a bit under done.  Next time I will add more broth and plan for added cooking time. I will be making it again.  My husband and I enjoyed it and look forward to the leftovers.

This was great - with changes!  You need twice the amount of liquid as rice when you cook it, and all the liquid in the recipe was one cup of milk.  So......I added one can of low sodium chicken broth, and one half cup of milk along with the can of cream of chicken soup.  I did add about two to four more tablespoons of rice since I'd added quite bit more liquid.  I
thawed the cup of peas in a collander under warm running water, mixed them in with the other ingredients, and added some low sodium taco seasoning - about one half of a packet , and I stirred in the chicken chunks as well instead of just placing them on top.  (I think I might like adding more of the seasoning next time.)  I covered it and baked it for one hour and ten minutes; it was done when I checked it, then I sprinkled on the cheese, (probably close to two cups), and put it back in the oven, uncovered, for a few minutes until the cheese melted.  It was YUMMY and I' ll be  making it again for sure!!

I was amazed at how the frozen peas cooked on top of the casserole after the casserole was already baked.    I thought it was delicious!     It required only a few ingredients, and you can make it all up in the baking dish.  Clean, quick, and easy!
I used a rotisoirre lemon pepper chicken and just tore up the breasts for this recipe.     I didn't have grated cheddar, so just sliced some from a brick of cheddar and laid it across the top.  It worked great.   Once the casserole was baked for the hour, I spread the peas on the top and covered it with aluminum foil.    The peas cooked on top, and it looked very pretty and appetizing.   Stayed warm for a couple or 3 hours.

This casserole was okay. I cooked the chicken and rice before adding all the other ingredients. I baked the casserole for 40 minutes. My husband thought the casserole needed more spices. He plans on making a tasty burrito with the leftovers.

I didn't waste my time cooking it in the oven.  I used minute rice so I cooked the chicken in the sauce and added the peas just before I added the rice and then turned off the heat and covered the skillet and let the rice absorb the sauce.  my family loved it.

I used thighs instead of  breasts, and cooked the rice and chicken ahead of time because I wanted to use the microwave instead of the oven. (Too hot outside!) After that it didn’t seem like it needed more liquid so I skipped the milk. I did add some sour cream though. I used corn instead of peas and threw in some of my homemade dry mix of spices for taco seasoning and some salsa. I did not skimp on the cheese at all and mixed some throughout as well as putting some on top. It was very good. We had enough for two dinners for 3 people and there were NO leftovers to sit in the fridge until it finally gets thrown out. To me, that’s a win! Thanks for a new recipe that was a family pleaser! Next time I might add even more sour cream and another can of green chilies.

Delicious and easy. Only thing I added was garlic salt to the chicken before putting in the dish. Definitely will be on the rotation.

Great!  I despise peas, so substituted corn.  Added cumin and crushed corn chips on top.

I normally try to make a recipe *as written* the first time... but this time I combined this and another recipe (and others' reviews). First I doubled to serve about 6-8. I subbed frozen corn for the peas (and included in the sauce mix before baking). I used a mexican mix of shredded cheese with cream cheese. And I seasoned 4 chicken breasts with 2tsp cumin, pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt & pepper before baking. It took a lot longer to bake than the recipe says... next time I will try 375 for about 45 min. Served with sliced tomatoes. We really liked this, will def make again!

This recipe was a good comfort food. I doubled it because I have big eaters!  I cut my chicken up in bite sized pieces & cooked in my copper chef pan. I used Lawry's seasoning instead of salt & pepper. Just a personal choice. Then I put the english peas in & poured the liquids mixed with the rice over that. Did not stir it. I then put cheese on top.  I cooked it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for to ensure the rice was done. Good!

This was yummy and easy, although definitely not as spicy as I thought it would be with the Chile peppers in it...I found it was actually almost a bit bland.

Good. Used cream of celery soup and didn't have chilies.  Put in half an envelope of taco seasoning and cooked in a 9x13 pan.

This was great! You can pretty much use any vegetables you want. I used green beans and corn. I also substituted quinoa for the rice . I added probably an extra quarter cup of water to make sure I didn't dry it out. My six-year-old can be a little picky and she took a bite and said Yum. That never happens!

Yes, added 1/4 C more milk and had it stand for 10 minutes after it came out of oven.  Delicious and easy.  Would be better for you if you made the soup and used brown rice.

Wow.. This is a fantastic, flavorful dish. Perfect comfort food, easy dinner. I read the reviews and came up with my own variation. I would honestly love to add some jalapeño, but this was just right for the kids. Used a 9x13 dish.

My rice wasn't completely done and it was a little dry. I had to adjust and change the cream of chicken soup due to my husband's gluten allergy. So I put in chicken broth and half & half. I should've put more chicken broth in. That being said, I really liked the flavor and will try to make it again. I think I will put less chicken in also, for me it was too much meat.

Used cream of mushroom soup but otherwise followed it exactly. VERY easy and I used rotisserie chicken breast so even easier.  Good flavors and a hit with my husband and daughter. I will make it again, the perfect dish for a busy day. Served it with fresh grilled squash from the garden.

It came out perfect with recipe. I added corn. I did not understand if chicken was to be chopped in an electric chopper or by knife. I chopped mine in an electric chopper and it was fine.

After reading other peoples reviews, I added chili powder and cumin to this recipe, and crushed tortilla chips on top. Still did not have much flavor, but I will certainly keep this as an easy go-to recipe!

My husband & son loved it.  I liked it, however, I felt the chicken was very blah.  I did use 8 chicken tenders, as opposed to 2 chicken breasts.  I waited to add the shredded cheddar until the last 10 minutes, so that it wasn't so liquified.  And I served the peas on the side.  If I could season the chicken prior to adding it, or soak it in a marinade to give it more flavor, I think I'd like it better.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added corn instead of peas and also mixed in a package of taco seasoning. It was very good, except the rice did not cook all the way through. Next time I will use minute rice or pre-cooked  rice.
I think the taco seasoning makes this really tasty. Without it, it would be bland.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and an onion to the recipe based on other inputs. When I make this again, and I will, I'll use Minute Rice, as even after 45 minutes at 350 and 15 at 450, the rice was still too al dente!

I agree with other users, this needs more liquid. I added a full can of milk, 3/4 cup chicken broth and I still think it could have used at least another half cup of broth. I omitted the green chilies but added an Anaheim and a jalepeno pepper and taco seasoning. Very easy good dinner.

For convenience and flavor and speed, this is the best! I made my own roux - why would ANYONE use that soup stuff? If I am cooking at home then I will make my own roux! Anyway, did that and added some hot chilies in a jar to the mix and the rice was amazing!!! SOooo creamy and delish! A real comfort-food dish here and was great for lunch the next day too.

Great idea and so versatile!  I used leftover cooked chicken, so to get more liquid I did not drain the chilies, and I added an (undrained) can of RoTel as well.  Like others, I added a packet of taco seasoning, and we're big fans of corn in Mexican style dishes so I added a cup of frozen corn to the mixture at the start and left out the peas.  With the RoTel I have to say it was not an appealing mixture in the bowl - looked a little "pre-eaten" so to speak, but once in the baking dish and covered with cheese (mixture of cheddar and Monterey jack) it looked OK.  Tightly covered with foil, 1 hour at 350 degrees and 10 minutes of "stand" time was perfect.  I like some of the other suggestions, like crushed chips on the top and using it as a burrito filling too.  All in all one of the best uses I've found for leftover chicken.

I used brown rice instead of white. Big mistake. Do not do this, unless you cook it first. I baked it, microwaved it for 15 minutes, and the rice was still crunchy. I added 1 packet of taco seasoning per other's suggestions and it was too salty. I would only recommend 1/2 a packet.

Delicious! Since people mentioned it was a bit dry, I poured some hot salsa in the rice mixture and it was fantastic! I didn't want it to be bland so when I cooked the chicken, I used taco some taco seasoning. Otherwise I followed the recipe and everybody loved it...no leftovers!
