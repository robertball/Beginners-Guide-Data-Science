I have made this for the last two years for Christmas and definetely plan on making it again this year. I would consider it a fruitcake; people who are not sure they like fruitcake love this. I leave the apple on 5-10 days, making sure it's sitting in a nice cool place, it just makes it moister and tastier........Here it is December 2011 and I must add to my review. This cake is so good, I have people that get me to bake it for them for Christmas each year. I have already baked 2 in November and I have 3 more to bake. It's like Lay's potato chips, you can't take just one bite.

I made this cake for Christmas. My family said it was the best one I'd ever made. The only change I made was the 1lb pineapple was reduced to add some fruit peel (orange & lemon). Very good cake!

This cake has been passed down from my Mother to me and my sisters, now my daughters. Fruity and moist fruit cake, I use marichino cherries cut up and drained, crushed pineapple drained. instead of candied fruit. we bake them in medium sized loaf pans for gifts for Christmas.
