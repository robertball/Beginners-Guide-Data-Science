I have never made a bad recipe from Chef John but this one is insanely good! I used more italian sausage and less chicken but only because thats what I had. My husband raved about this dish. I will be making it regularly. If you haven't been to Chef Johns blog Foodwishes go there and watch hm make this recipe, I have been cooking for 30 years and still I find his videos helpful! Thanks again Chef John

I RARELY give a 5 star rating. I'm not a picky person but to me 5 star signifies top restaurant quality, and THIS dish does that. I was searching for a chicken based pasta dish that was not the norm, this fit the bill and will become a regular dish in my house. I followed the recipe pretty close except doubled the meat. I used pepperoncinis and sweet yellow bell peppers (on-hand). Asiago and Romano cheeses. Marsala can make some dishes a little too sweet for my blood so  I used Merlot. It came out GREAT. It was my 1st Chef John but wont be my last.

Very good overall with excellent flavor. We followed the recipe as written since we’ve not eaten chicken riggies before and wanted to taste something resembling the local version (an image search using a search engine shows numerous versions based on ‘tweaks’ by different cooks). Used red, yellow and orange sweet peppers, along with 2 jalapenos. The creamy tomato sauce was spicy with moderate heat for our tastes. The sauce seemed to be about the right consistency in step 2 when it called for adding water if needed. The water was not added to avoid a runny sauce (btw, the video version is correct but the AR edited written version is in error by saying to add water to thicken the sauce as it will thin it). After adding the pasta in the final step, what liquid existed in the sauce was quickly absorbed. Next time, I would add 1-1/2 cups chicken broth and not be concerned about the sauce looking runny in step 2. This is another excellent recipe by Chef John.

i am a prepper.  I prep all the ingredients and then start cooking.  I didn't have marsala so I used white wine and therefore got the wine and the water mixed up and put the water in when the wine was supposed to go in.  Sigh.  I drank the 1/2  cup of wine and all was good.  I left out olives because I hate them.  Other than that, made it as written and was great.  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe with my favorite meat....chicken thighs.

Fantastic Recipe.  I slightly changed it b/c I don't like mushrooms or olives, so I added a jalapeno & half a red & green bell pepper.  Extremely tasty.

Really good, and the leftovers were excellent too.  Chef John tends to season a little hotter than my family likes, but easy enough to add a little less hot peppers and I also used mild italian sausage.  Will make again.  I didn't have any olives, but I think they would have made a good addition.

I am from Central NY (Syracuse, specifically) and Chicken Riggies is something my family makes every time I am home, because as Chef John says, you don't see this on a menu anywhere else.  This recipe is awesome and I will continue to make it again and again!

OMG...I never made this dish before nor did I ever hear of it but after watching the video and just loving all of Chef John's recipes and my success with them, I thought well, sounds good, let's give it a shot. I followed the recipe pretty closely only substituting black olives for the ones he has because they were a lot cheaper. I normally don't like olives in hot foods but did it anyway and loved it. My husband loved this meal and I did as well. I give it 5 stars and a really big pat on my own back for this one....it took 2 hours from the very beginning to the first mouthful but boy it was worth it and I will say company worthy for sure.

Tried it two ways. Exactly as written and found it a little spicy and rich. In the second attempt I did not add hot peppers and subbed a half  can of Carnation milk for the heavy cream. It tasted wonderful both ways.

I've made this probably three times. It makes a ton for our two-person household (like at least six servings IMO), but luckily the sauce freezes pretty well. So after step three I divide the sauce and freeze two thirds of it in two containers, then cook about 5 ounces of pasta and follow the remaining steps 4 and 5. Then I have two more meals waiting in the freezer. Mix up the peppers but make sure one kind is at least a little spicy. Also, in the Food Wishes vid I think Chef John used a combo of green and Kalamata olives so that's what I do.

CHANGES;  1/4 lb sweet Italian sausage
!/2 onion. 1/4 red pepper chopped and semi cooked in the microwave.. 4 boneless chicken thighs. 14 oz can diced tomatoes w/o much juice,( pureed tomatoes may have been better) 4-5 oz fresh mushrooms,  3/4 c marsala.  1/2 c. chicken broth mixed with 1 T tomato paste and 1 tsp cornstarch - warmed in microwave until thick
2 lg cloves crushed garlic,  1/2 C. kalamata olives
This is a real play it by ear recipe in terms of when to add what,

I like my chicken, mushrooms and peppers less cooked!!!

Next time I won't use the cornstarch!!!!  Add more tomato paste if necessary.

Chef John’s recipes have literally never disappointed, and this one goes well above that reputation. This is probably our favorite home-made dish of all time. The kalamata olives are a GREAT twist...DO NOT SUBSTITUTE with a different variety before trying them.

My family loves this recipe with some minor changes. I only use  one  jalapeno pepper , the rest are red orange and yellow for color. I also use half n half instead of cream. I toss the  al dente  pasta with the sauce and added black olive slices.  I will then place in a 9x13 pan and bake with Italian cheese blend on top at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes or until cheese is to liking. I have made this , stopped at tossing placed in refrigerator and cooked later with cheese for about 10 minutes longer . I have also frozen it in a lined aluminum pan and given to a friend who's wife had surgery their family loved it.

I made no changes to this excellent recipe. Chef John has perfectly captured the Riggies I loved from my Central New York boyhood home. Do NOT substitute anything for the Cherry Peppers! They are bright, sharp, and essential. 
I've made this a number of times since first trying it out, and it has become a major part of our dinnertime Rota!! Thanks Chef John!!

I figured I would try this recipe to switch my usual riggie recipe up a bit, figured the sausage and Marsala wine would be an interesting twist. Boy, was I wrong. The sausage overpowers everything, and the kalamata olives clash with the flavor of the sauce, leaving an awful flavor on the back of your tongue. Remove the sausage and replace the kalamata olives with black olives and this recipe might be decent.

"Wow - this is really good," said DH who doesn't like pasta or tomatoes. Then he asked, "Is there more?" and proceeded to have a second helping. So glad I made this because I could live on pasta! Plan to make  this often. I made following to a T Chef John's recipe and served with Chef John Corn Salad with Creamy Italian dressing. Yum!

This dish was really good and even better the next day!  My only concern is there are just so many ingredients that I really didn’t think were necessary and I didn’t even include the mushrooms because DH won’t eat them or the olives because I won’t eat them.  I tasted the sauce before I added the peppers/garlic and it was phenomenal – so much so I almost didn’t add them.  The sauce wasn’t hurt by adding them but I didn’t think they added enough flavor boost to warrant the extra pre-time for chopping the peppers (or the cost) – maybe I need better peppers?  Before I prepared this dish I noticed another reviewer complain that sausage doesn’t belong in Chicken Riggies and then proceeded to share their “real” recipe -- I have to say I really liked the combo.  If you want Chicken Riggies without the sausage either skip it or follow another recipe, don’t rip on this one.  I will make this again but skip the peppers, maybe add more sausage and try it with chicken breasts or tenders instead.  Thanks for another dish to add to the family rotation.

I followed the recipe with the exception of added spicy peppers. Hot Italian sausage was more than enough heat for my family. It was a hit. I will make this again. 
Next time I will add basil or oregano, because it needed something.

Tasted pretty good, but seemed like a lot of chopping of ingredients.  Used New Mexico chiles and Japanese chilies, along w the hot sausage, but it didn't seem all that hot to me.  I'd use more sausage next time, because the bites I got that did have it were better than the ones without.

This has been Chef John's recipes at our house this week and I haven't had one fail me yet and this one was outstanding. I usually like sauce to be sitting on my pasta and this sauce was thin but omg, the flavor was unbelievable!! I had to leave out the kalamata olives because I had none, but followed the recipe exactly.

I was unsure of this recipe until the final reduction, at which point all of the flavors came together. This tasted amazing over some homemade pasta. 
Alterations:
Replaced the Marsala wine with a Merlot. 
My wife is lactose intolerant, so I replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk. 
Additionally, I used a handful of mini bell peppers with a Serrano pepper for the pepper mix, which was the right amount of spicy for me. Also, I used shiitake mushrooms, which blends really well with the other flavors. 
The only change I would make to the recipe is cooking the chicken separate from the sausage mix, as the recipe as written overcrowds the chicken. Even with that being said, this recipe is very flavorful, and I will be revisiting.

This makes a high end restaurant quality meal that both my wife and I loved. However I ended up with very little sauce. I don’t know if I used too much heat but I would double the cream and stock next time to ensure more sauce.

I love this recipe. But as with all recipes I use, it’s a starting point. I’ve made this several times, I modified each time in different ways. I use chipotle peppers, they give this a nice smoky flavor and adds a bit of spice. This time I also added diced tomatoes. Mmmmmm.

I grew up in Utica and have eaten a lot of chicken riggies. The flavor of these was perfect, however the sauce was too thin. It should stick to the pasta like a spaghetti sauce.

Chef John! You didn't tell me I would need a 15 inch skillet...of course I may have cheated just a little bit on the sausage...and a few other things. Big hit with the whole family!

OMG this recipe is TOP NOTCH!  Highly recommend.  The only thing I changed was I used crushed tomatoes not plum tomatoes and I used basil rather than parsley. Delicious and even better as a leftover.  This will be a recipe I used again for sure!

I love Chef John. This dish was delicious and I followed the recipe exactly except I used my food processor to chop the chicken. Just pulsed the thighs a few times. I used the jarred sweet cherry peppers. They weren’t spicy but added something special to the dish. I hate olives. Having said that they were amazing in this dish. Next time I’m going to use a hot pepper as Chef John did. I thought the cherry peppers would add spice but they were more of a vinegar flavor. My family just loved it. Thanks for another great recipe.

What a delightful recipe!  I made it last night and was all set to have leftovers today, but someone (and not me) got up and ate it all in the middle of the night. I thought that it was just a tad greasy, so today I’m draining most of the grease before adding the onions.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly minus olives. What a winner!  Thanks for sharing, Chef John.

Well that was delicious.  Thanks again Chef John.  Made a double batch to freeze.  To speed up the chopping, I used my food processor to separately chop the the chicken, garlic and olives.  Excellent recipe I highly recommend for a cold winter evening.

Delicious.  I increased the hot italian sausage by half as much.  Used 1 1/2 patties broken up.  For peppers, I used on one red pepper, one green pepper and some jarred hot peppers,  I cut back on the olives and chopped them very small.  Lots of parm reggiano cheese on top when served.  I also added some crushed red peppers on my portion.  Not everyone likes it as hot as I do!

Made without changes the peppers that I used were a little overwhelming so next time I will use a milder type. Overall a great change to the usual pasta sauce.

Excellent recipe, but definitely cut the amount of pasta in HALF.  First time I made it I did not, this time I did ... what a difference!  The sauce is delicious, which is why you want less pasta, otherwise it is dry.  Also, I have a large family and big eaters, I made the 8 serving version, it definitely feeds 8.

Oh My Gosh! I don't know if I will ever go back to my regular sausage/hamburger sauce recipe again or if I do I'm definitely incorporating some of these ingredients into my sauce. 
I used chicken breast instead of thighs and I will forevermore hack my chicken up like this, who knew it could be that easy! I added pepperoncini peppers and regular black and green olives and I used Madeira wine as I did not have Marsala. I omitted the chicken broth and water as I used 2 quarts of my home canned tomatoes and they are very juicy but added 2 teaspoons Better than Bullion roasted beef base (I was out of chicken). I also used half and half instead of straight up heavy cream.
I added a mix of fresh sliced yellow/ red and orange peppers and along with the snipped parsley, I added fresh basil. 
This sauce is divine! As a matter of fact, my husband is eating the leftovers for breakfast :-)

It turned out great! The hottest peppers we used were jalapeños. My family doesn’t like it too spicy. The mix of flavors and the brininess of the pickled peppers really made for a great flavor. Something we have never experienced. Loved it! Will definitely make it again!

Im from CNY and this recipe might be OK but it is not Chicken Riggies like they should be. The sauce is made up of White wine, spaghetti sauce and parmesan cheese.

Supreme recipe!  This was so so good. Followed the recipe mostly as written. I didn't have Masala so used a blend of Amontillado and sweet vermouth. I didn't have enough kalamatas so I had to sub in some black olives. The recipe is very adaptable to tweeks. The recipe is a bit reminiscent of a Puttanesca sauce. My husband loved it.

Too bland, almost tasteless, except for the red pepper flakes, which were too strong (I used dried Tarragon instead of Rosemary; is that where I went wrong).

Consistency of sauce was perfect, though.

Sooo easy.  It took longer than expected, but worth it!
I used 6 links of chorizo, no chicken or peppers, and Cabernet instead of Marsala (only because that's what I had in the house).  I also added the garlic about 2 minutes before the tomatoes to make sure they were cooked.   I paired it with homemade linguini and   The result was delicious!!!

This recipe is terrific just as it is! Will use less sweet and hot peppers next time because some family members thought it was a bit too spicy for them...but they came back for seconds anyway! A real keeper.

easy to make and incredibly delicious. it even tasted better after reheating the next day. I doubled the olives, which gave it a unique flavor that compliments the chicken and sausage so well!

An absolutely delicious recipe. I enjoy most of Chef John's videos and recipes. He is like a breath of fresh air in the Chef world! This dish only got better with time. I don't normally enjoy leftovers, but we ate this until it was gone! Great crowd pleaser.

Used white (riesling) wine; mild italian sausage, 10% cream,  a banana pepper (with seeds) and a yellow pepper. I will definitely make again - loved it. Didn't bother with the parsley as I didn't have it. I am sure basil would be awesome - will try it next time.

Followed directions to a T and got rave reviews from family! Combo of chicken and sausage is so good and the hot and sweet peppers give it a nice kick.

WOW!!  So amazing and delicious!  I made this as the recipe called, but had to make a few changes due to ingredients available in my area.  I couldn't find hot Italian sausage in bulk, so I had to substitute it with mild Johnsonville Italian sausage.  I was told it was their spicier variety (compared to their 'sweet' variety).  I also wasn't sure what kind of peppers to buy so I bought the mini sweet ones and just chopped them up.  I hate olives so they were omitted.  I also used chicken breasts because they needed to be used.  Since I was unsure how spicy the sausage was, I sprinkled in some red chili pepper flakes.  This recipe makes enough to feed an army, so if you're single like me, you need to halve the recipe at least.  I loved the flavor and will be making this again for sure!!  Now I just need to figure out if I can freeze cooked noodles or else I'll be eating this for more than a week.

We prefer chicken breasts and did make this one substitution. Otherwise I made this as written, as  to date, everything that I have tried from Chef John has been excellent.  This is a winner and will be made  again and again.  There is only two of us so we had lots of leftovers.  The leftovers were even tastier as the sauce seemed to flavour the pasta better on day 2.  Thanks Chef John!  We love your recipes and your sense of humour is wonderful!

I've never done a review before. Mainly because I'm a 'tosser' (RARELY measure) and a changer. I changed this one so much, but it was SO GOOD I had to encourage others to at least use it for a base. (I'll do this in the order the ingredients are listed) First off, I don't like Italian sausage so I just used 1 lb regular sausage. Tossed in a whole package of fresh mushrooms, 2 red onions, 5 chicken thighs, (I try to make protein the top ingredient or as close as I can) didn't have Marsala so I used half a bottle of flat beer. It was looking thin, so I didn't add any water or chicken broth. Just used 2 large bell peppers, 1 small can of sliced black olives and 1 small can of chopped black olives, dried Italian herbs from the cabinet, 1 lb rigatoni, shredded cheddar cheese and some feta cheese I had leftover from another recipe. With all the chopping and reducing, 'my recipe' took forever to finish! But it was well worth it! Pictures to come.....

Oh my goodness, this is so good and so different from my other pasta recipes.  Right now it's my new favorite BUT I'm going to make Chef John's "Pasta alla Genovese" tomorrow and am excited to see what that recipe will bring.  Thank you Chef John!!  Definitely a keeper!  (and so is this recipe)

As with most all of Chef John's recipes, WE LOVED IT!!!  Since Chef John frequently grants us permission to do so, I did make a few adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I had no hot Italian sausage, so substituted 1/4 pound ground sausage that I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase from a friend who raises cattle and pigs and makes his own sausage.  I added a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  I used Merlot instead of Marsala.  Used 1 large  jalapeno, 1/2 of a large pablano and 1 smallish green chile (all seeded).    Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Follow Chef John's suggestion and stick with things rather than breasts. To die for!!  This made ALOT.  More like 8-10 servings. No prob!  Lefties are on the menu for tonight.

Amazing amazing dish!  I used more hot Italian sausage and also added sun dried tomatoes.  No cherry peppers so used chili peppers and hot pepper spread.  I let it simmer for 40 instead of 30 minutes since I used 35oz can of tomatoes instead of 28.  One of my favorites and I will be making again!

First a note to the calorie counters. This is not 4 servings. It serves 8-10, so it's closer to 500 calories per serving.  I've made this twice, the first time using a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and the second time using a quart of garden fresh cherry tomatoes cut in half. Both times I used a variety of peppers, leaning toward the hot. Both variations were excellent and everyone enjoyed it. The version with canned tomatoes is probably a little more authentic.  This is a great dish to feed a crowd because the sauce can be made the day before and when you are ready to eat, just cook the pasta, reheat the sauce and you are done.

We absolutely loved this!  Basically did everything the way the recipe was written but added a bit more of stuff and didn't have chicken thighs so used some left over breasts we had already cooked!  Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again and again :)

This was a great dish! I increased the amount of chicken stock to one 14.5 ounce can and I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I will definitely make this very tasty dish again!

Very different so my 6 year old didn't like it but my husband and I liked it a lot. I used almond milk instead of cream.

Excellent recipe!  I couldn't find marsala wine so I used Tabor Hill Pinot Noir (Red), and I used San Marzano Fire Roasted tomatoes, a Poblano and a Cubano pepper, and chicken stock instead of broth.  Everything else was the same.  Followed the directions and cooked my rigatoni for 11 minutes.  It was perfect.  Resembles the flavors in chile  but Italian chile instead of southwestern.  Definitely a keeper!

This makes a rich tasting sauce. I will double down on the hot peppers next time.  This is my new favorite rigatoni receipe.

We loved this recipe.  The changes I made were few.  I used leftover rosé instead of the marsala or white. It worked really well. Then I used Hemp milk instead of heavy whipped cream. I have dairy issues and Hemp is thick. It was delicious. I used Pecorino Romano for the cheese. Beautiful.

I would say, and my dad did say, this is probably the best thing I have ever cooked in my life. And I cook a lot and I'm a good cook. This was outstanding. This was amazing. We made a few changes although I'm sure it's amazing the way it is. They only sold the sausage in one pound packages so I used one pound of Italian sausage. I also upped the peppers and mushrooms. This is fantastic. Enjoy enjoy!

I love this kind of dish as its kid and family friendly. I think if I had added salt (which I forgot to add) it would have been a bit bette but it was already good. I used venison sausage which was fine but found I was looking for the taste the the Italian sausage usually adds. I will definitely make again. It's a pretty dish.

The only change I made was to use banana peppers so the heat wasn't too much for my grandkids.  This was outrageously good!  The aroma had everyone wandering around the kitchen sniffing and waiting impatiently.  This will be made often from now on!

I had to substitute a few things because of missing some ingredients.  But with that said,  my family rated it and 8!  Oh and I added some pepperoni because I was actually wanting to make pizza casserole, but this was fantastic.

I wanted to thank Chef John for this recipe.  I do plan to make it again with a few modifications.   It was a bit spicy so next time I make it I will use mild Italian Sausage links vs. the ground sausage since I like the texture of the sliced links better.  I will put one serano pepper in it with a red pepper.  I used some of the bottled red sweet peppers and hot peppers too when I made this and think that is why it was a bit hot. 
I think you could add some sun dried tomatoes too and it would make the dish better too.

Delicious base recipe! I will make this again and try adding other items. I prepared the dish with what I had on hand, so my variation was slightly different, but still fantastic.  I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage and 1 lb of chicken. I did not have olives on hand, or the sweet-hot peppers, so I chopped and added 1/2-3/4  of a large sweet orange pepper.  All other ingredients I had and  incorporated per the recipe's instructions. Thanks Chef John, I always know your recipes will be outstanding!

VERY good.  Used 1 quart frozen tomatoes from my garden, 1 tsp. chicken bouillon and skipped the water.  2 pickled jalapeno  peppers and some jalapeno pepper juice.  Still not that spicy.  I think the cream tempers the spice.  Used a little of the pasta water to thin out the sauce at serving time.  The al dente pasta really soaks up the liquid.  Definitely a keeper.

This was amazing and will definitely be a go to recipe when I want to impress. I did leave out the olives and went with a sweet Italian sausage because that's what I had. I made a bit more sauce by adding roughly a third more tomatoes, broth, cream and so on because i added extra mushrooms and sausage, and I just feel you can't go wrong with more sauce. My family told me this is the most delicious thing I have ever made and I have to agree. Thank you Chef John, the video was helpful too!

Added about 3/4 cup of Sriracha, used only jalapeno peppers, no sweet peppers and doubled the garlic.  Next time I make this I'll make garlic bread to go with it.

I changed a few things to bring the cost down. Used Prego sauce with roasted red peppers & Basil. Used diced tomatoes with green chiles. Used a full lb of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage. Used chicken stock and no water. Used sour cream. sprinkled a tbsp of Paprika on chicken and sausage while browning. Skipped adding other peppers other than a green bell.. Used an Italian cheese blend that included 4 different cheeses. Skipped the wine. I find Chef Johns recipes interesting, but am usually overwhelmed by the number of ingredients. I find it difficult to achieve the proper balance between too many ingredients ? ? This made a large dish . . .but the flavor just gets better with each re-heat !

I made this recipe and I am a beginning level cook. Honestly, I was a little intimidated.  However this recipe, if followed closely,  is as simple as can be. And the end result is ultimately delicious!!  I do love spicy food so I upped the ante on the jalapeños by using three. And make sure you have a large skillet!! Other than that, I followed your recipe step-by-step. All of my friends and family were amazed by the tastes and textures that are contained within this meal. What a wonderful experience this was! I will definitely be making this again! Thank you Chef john! You made dinner a HIT!!!

As a Central New Yorker, not far from where this recipe originates from in Utica, NY, I made this over this past weekend and followed the recipe with the exception of the kalamata olives and red peppers.  I used a 16 ounce jar of mild banana peppers as I can't eat really spicy food, whereas the hubby can.  The tradeoff was well worth it.  It was outstanding!  Although we've had plenty of chicken riggies at local restaurants, Chef John's was one of the absolutely best home made recipes I've ever had.  Kudo's to you Chef John!

The only change I made was half and half instead of cream.  It really is restaurant quality. I think the olives really make the dish.  Not too spicy but livens up your mouth just a bit.  Love it

I made this dish last evening for my boyfriend and his 15 year old son and it was a huge hit!  His son went back for seconds and asked to take leftovers to school today, which made me very happy.  They both asked me if I would make it for them again.  I did not find this dish to be too hot and spicy as some reviewers did and the Kalamata olives really make the dish extraordinary.  Chef John, thank you for making me look like a rock star!

Made this last night and OMG it was delicious. I thought my DH would burst. Made it exactly as written, except I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream. I also cooked the rigatoni about 2 minutes less than the instructions on the box, which is really key as Chef John indicated on the video. I will be making this again.

This is a six star recipe.  So delicious, could't wait to have the leftovers today.  It was pretty spicy but that was okay too.  I made it exactly to the directions, wouldn't  change a thing.

Was very good but I think the Marsala taste was a bit too predominant.  Did not add the olives but will try this with them on the next try.

This was delicious!  It makes a ton and it is a perfect one dish meal.  I served it with a side salad and we kept coming back for more!  Very satisfying and flexible.  I used red wine, pepperonicinis,  jarred jalepenos, kalamata olives, and everything else in the recipe.  Totally recommend!

I had been wanting to try this recipe, but couldn't find a couple of things at our local store. So...omitted the marsala and kalamatas, and replaced the chopped peppers with a fine-cut giardinera mix, and it was fabulous! It had so much flavor, and the combination of the sausage and chicken thighs was great.

Made this last night, followed the recipe exactly. My wife and I were a little apprehensive since we are not huge fans of "spicy" but it sounded so good we wanted to give it a try. Disclaimer we are from upstate NY, near Rochester specifically. We loved it! Especially my wife, which was really surprising since she really hates spicy foods. It had the perfect amount of heat and such great flavor. We did use more "milder" peppers for ours though. I used half a cup each of pepperonchini and banana peppers as well as half cup of sliced black olives. I also used Wegmans brand Hot pork sausage. This is going in the rotation for sure. Thanks Chef John!

So the first time I made this, I messed up and added 1 lb of italian sausage.  Whoops!  My daughter loved it, but I was more of a so-so.  But realizing my mistake, I wanted to make it again correctly.  I use mild sausage because I'm the only one who likes hot stuff, and sausage doesn't agree with me usually.  

I love this with the sweet cherry peppers!  I still did not care for the sausage but my hubby and daughter gave it 2 thumbs up!  I would definitely make this again, but I'm not sure if I will omit the sausage or not.

Made this last night and all I can say is "wow!"  I followed the recipe exactly even to measuring the liquids.  I used one yellow chili, one red jalapeno and some fire-roasted red pepper.  I seeded all of the peppers so that we got the flavor without all the heat.  This was fantastic. However the next time I'm going to use less pasta so that there is more meat versus pasta. This is a keeper.  Thanks to Chef John.

Winner winner chicken riggies dinner!  I followed the recipe precisely.  Used red, yellow and orange peppers, along with a half of jalapeno that I had to use up.  We enjoyed this.  Watch the amount of salt that you add, as the kalamata olives are quite salty.  This is one for the recipe box!  Thanks Chef John!

This is a very forgiving recipe. It can easily be tweaked to add or remove  ingredients to your taste. I use sweet basil/cheese sausage. My husband doesn't care for olives, so I leave them out and throw some in my bowl if I'm in the mood. I use peppers if I have them on hand, otherwise it's fine without them. I usually have jarred hot pepper rings that I throw in for flavor. I've used both boneless thighs and boneless breasts. Both work fine, but I liked the thighs a little better.  I serve this with crusty italian bread and a salad. The leftovers are even better the next day. We always bring them for lunch.

We had guests for dinner tonight and this was a BIG hit!  I used chicken drumettes, lightly browning them before adding to the mixture, also used about 8 oz of hot Italian sausage. I didn't have heavy whipping cream so used half and half. 'This recipe is full of flavor and I have plenty of leftovers, too. Yum!
