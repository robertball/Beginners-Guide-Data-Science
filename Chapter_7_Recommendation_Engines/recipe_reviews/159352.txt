Very good and very easy.  Make sure you chop up the spinach.  I got lazy and didn't.  You know you can't get a whole cooked leaf of spinach on a teaspoon?  My wife made me wear a lobster bib.

This has very good flavor.  Its a comfort soup.  I followed the recipe to the "T".. Its yummy.  I know I will have leftovers as I could only get my son to try it.  So for leftovers I have already decided I can add some pasta or rice, to give me another meal with this great tasting soup.. thank you ..

I made this completely vegetarian, using veggie rather than chicken broth and omitting the shrimp. Also, I added minced garlic and used white onion instead of green, as well as a couple Russet potatoes chopped up relatively small. The nutmeg really brings this recipe together. For extra-awesome taste, try adding a slice of White American cheese during the simmer. Doing so turned this into my favorite soup ever, and really brought it to a new level of deliciousness!

Not quite what I was expecting from the other reviews, but it was still quite good, and my boy really enjoyed it.

Wow, we loved this! I used veg broth and subbed a mix of coconut milk and almond milk for milk, and I used olive oil instead of butter. The flavor combo was just excellent. Easy to make, too. I like it with lots of fresh-ground pepper. This is a new favorite!

Fabulous soup that can be a whole meal.  I made alterations to make it gluten free by using a Gluten free cream soup mix I make and have at hand. The shrimp really are a touch of genius.  Spinach and shellfish go so well together.  Thank you for this soup that's towards the top if my soup repetoire.

My husband loved this soup.  I thought it needed more flavor, but was very, very good.  Will make it again, and maybe add a little garlic or something.

This was OK for me. A little Bit bland. I think if I make this again I will use less milk and more spices. and maybe even half and half instead of the milk.

Add 2 heaping Tablespoons of the bottled minced garlic, use Shrimp Stock and add 1/4t Crushed Red Pepper and you will have a soup that is amazing !   (rather than just average as it's written)

This soup is delicious. I added an extra cup of milk to add more liquid. Also, I followed the comments advice to add pasta. Absolutely great mix but donâ€™t add too much pasta like I did. I ended up taking some of it out since pasta absorbs liquid. Go figure.

Made this and added 2 cloves of garlic. I would have liked more spinach in the soup and will do that next time. Beautiful flavour!

Incredible flavour! I didn't have any sherry and used white wine instead. Also to bulk up the texture I used king oyster mushrooms - which made it really hearty - a wonderful dinner soup! Thanks for the recipe SunnyByrd!

So delicious! I made it with vegetable broth and had to substitute for sherry but even then it came out great. Very rich and flavorful.

I also had to perk it up with red pepper flakes and a couple other spices.
