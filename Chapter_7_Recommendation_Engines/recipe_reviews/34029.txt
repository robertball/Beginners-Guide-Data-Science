Plenty of luscious passion fruit taste when made with 3/4 cup of Goya's "Fruta 100% Pure Passion Fruit Pulp"***, instead of the 1/2 cup asked for, but there was no white chocolate flavor! (Probably because I upped the p'fruit quantity.) So, you'll have to use more white chocolate or keep the p'fruit at 1/2 cup if you want to actually taste white chocolate! My only disappointment was in the crust. I made it with Mi Del's "100% Whole Wheat Honey Graham Crackers" & it became soggy. So I suggest at least adding some ground toasted macadamia nuts for crunch to commercial graham crackers or tea biscuits (British short cookies). The cheesecake was topped with AR member "Sweettreat's" own recipe for Chocolate-Dipped, Cheesecake-Wrapped Strawberries". (Hopefully AR will publish her recipe soon because they're so utterly delicious on their own, or topping any cake!) ~~~~~ To answer another reviewer's question about how to make one of the photos' round choc. decoration: I'd butter foil wrapped around a smooth glass jar, drizzle chocolate on it, then refrigerate it until firm. Carefully slide it off & remove foil. If it breaks, use pieces decoratively or start over. *** To find Goya brand "Fruta - 100% Pure Passion Fruit Pulp", which is a puree with no sugar or water added, look for the flat, 14 ounce plastic bags of it in the freezer section of possibly your regular or Asian grocer's, & definitely at Hispanic grocery stores. At a regular grocer, look in the freezer with Hispanic items.

I've made this a couple times, but substituted raspberries for the passion fruit. It is so amazingly good. One note: the times I've used Ghiradelli white chocolate, it has tasted infinitely better than with store-brand white chocolate chips.

A little less cooking time. The first one I made just tasted like a regular white cake. The next time I added a bit more cream cheese and white chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Delicious!
