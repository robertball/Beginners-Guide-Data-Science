Candied bacon is exactly right! It took an hour to get to the point of doneness in my photo, and that was turning it up for the last 15 minutes.  I did everything that was listed in the recipe, and the results were worth it.  Interesting.  I had a package of bacon that weighed 1.25 pounds, and half I used for this and half I fried as usual.  The ingredients for the candied part was just right for that amount of bacon.  The saltiness of the regularly fried bacon was so pronounced after tasting the candied bacon!  We had friends over for brunch, and the guys preferred the regular, but we gals loved the candied.  We were thinking of cutting the bacon in half, skewering it on pretty little sticks, and serving it for a party.  Trust me, it would be a hit!  Thanks again, as usual, Chef John!

Double this recipe or you will cry because you run out of delicious candied bacon and you will want MORE! Any thick cut bacon works great. I followed another reviewer's tip of doubling the maple syrup the second time I made this recipe. Very good.

Double the maple syrup mixture and use the bacon Chef John uses because it lays flat nicely and you won't run out of the mixture when you coat the bacon every 5 minutes; Other wise, not bad.

I've done this without the liquids, just with the bacon, brown sugar and black pepper.  In that instance, known as PIG CANDY!  Great warm, or if you have any left over, cold.  YUMMMMMM....

I added a little extra brown sugar, so the mixture was more of a paste than a glaze.  This is the best bacon I've ever had.  I'm going to be making this for every party until pigs go extinct.

Delicious! I doubled the maple syrup as was suggested by other reviewers. I also had to use almost 2 batches of glaze while cooking my bacon. This was kind of a high maintenance recipe because of the flipping/basting every 5 minutes, but man, was it worth it! I cut it up in bit-size pieces and took it to a party. It was awesome to see people's eyes get wide when they tried it and say, "Oh my god!" and "Holy **, that's good!" I would definitely make this again-- it was a crowd pleaser.

This recipe is a disaster. The candied bacon might taste really good, but I don't know, because it's been cooking already for about 1.5 hours and it's nowhere near brown and crispy. I've already made 5x the recipe's quantity of maple syrup mixture, and I keep running out. I'm about to run out of brown sugar and maple syrup, so I might have to just finish baking it without continuing to baste, because I won't be able to make any more syrup mixture. Also, the maple syrup mixture keeps dripping to the bottom. More of my mixture is ending up on the bottom of my catch tray than on my bacon!

This is great and I like it a lot better if it is done on a smoker with hickory smoke.

This was so delicious!  Sweet (not too sweet), and full of bacon-y goodness!!  I used about half a pound of bacon, and it disappeared (between me and my fiance) within 30 minutes.

I followed the instructions for the most part and it turned out fantastic! I used thin cut bacon and twirled it as I was laying out on the cooling rack. I ended up baking it for around 20 minutes at 
375 degrees-I did not turn it. The one thing I really should have done was line the cookie sheet. It is a sticky mess!

This was a huge hit at our Super Bowl party - the guests didn't even wait till half-time, they just ate it as soon as I came in the door!  I ran out of glaze, but just let it bake a few more minutes until it was nice and brown.  Remove from the rack as soon as possible because it will stick.  I did not have rice vinegar (forgot it on my list) so I substituted apple cider vinegar with favorable results.  Also, putting parchment paper on my baking pan helped minimized the cleanup.  A winner in our book and we will be making it again soon!

The sweet and savory flavors make this one highly addictive recipe. I've made it a few times now, and have used it a lot on sandwiches, but sometimes it's just been really nice to get a strip out of the refrigerator as a snack. If I have any suggestion, I'd say start with thick-cut smoked bacon. Thin cut and maple flavored bacon weren't quite as balanced. I also like it with 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper mixed in with the brown sugar.

This recipe is pretty awesome! I started out with making the recipe exactly as it states. Then made it by doubling the maple syrup as some have suggested. This is totally a preference thing as I enjoyed it more just the way the recipe is and my son enjoyed it with more syrup. One thing I did differently is I cut the bacon in half. First it helps with flipping and second you can have more pieces thus feeling more satisfied. The bacon darkens up once it's out of the oven. I also found that doing light basting of the syrup mixture worked better both in keeping the syrup on the bacon, having less drip into the pan, and I never ran out at the end of a batch.

Wanted to make it easier, quicker, and less mess so tried with precooked bacon - hormel from costco.  Placed aluminum foil on baking sheet for easy cleanup.  Basted bacon immediately then baked and basted every five minutes until desired crispness - it does crisp up more as rests.  May baste less often if don't want it too sweet. Turned out great even though thinner than original recipe.  Husband and boys loved it.  Will stick to rack if leave on too long.

One thing I do change is I leave it in the oven for 15 minutes instead of 10 then flipping them to fo in for another 5 minutes.  They always come out perfect. 
I stand them up in my watering glasses and scatter them throughout the house. 3 Lbs. Usually only takes 10 minutes to devour. Recipes are always given out, Thanks to Chef John at Foodwishes.com
And as always,  ENJOY!!

Made these on a Big Green Egg, smoked with apple chunks at 325 deg. I used thick slices, indirect cook with bacon on porcelain grate over a drip pan.  Let the sauce start to caramelize and thicken before turning and it will reduce waste.  By doing this the sauce proportion was about right for the amount of bacon.

Cook time does need adjustment.
Use only thick cut bacon as the recipe states, but...
Cook each side to start for 10 min per.
Remove and baste each side and cook for 10 min at a a time.
This allows the moisture from the Maple syrup and vinegar to evaporate and get the fat to render and get a good sticky coating.
Repeat the baste, and flip for as many cycles it takes to create a beautiful dark brown bacon in 10 min cycles. It took me about 4  or 5 cycles after the the basting had begun. 
I would add more brown sugar to the mix for some more sweet sticky goodness.
There is enough basting liquid in the recipe. if you run out, just continue the cooking and it should be plenty to make a wonderful bacon treat.

I was disappointed with this recipe.   However, it disappeared at my scrap booking gathering, so everyone else enjoyed it.  I made the recipe as is, and used a pastry brush to coat the bacon every five minutes.   I still ran out of the coating but I don't think its necessary to double the sauce.   I also bumped up the oven temp to 400 with about fifteen minutes left of baking since it wasn't crisping up.    I made a bacon candy recipe from food and wine that I loved, so that is probably why I was disappointed with this one.   Too much work, not enough award, IMHO.

This crack is whack!  I've tried other recipes that use dry ingredients that are pressed onto the bacon, but basting on the liquid concoction makes this a far superior Bacon Candy.

Wow! This was awesome! Couldn't stop eating it.  Used bourbon in place of rice vinegar and made a double batch of the baste, as others suggested.   Placed parchment paper under the rack and lightly coated rack with cooking spray to help with cleanup.   To cut down on time involved, would suggest cooking the bacon for at least 20 minutes before putting on the first baste.  Also turned the oven temp up to 375 and it didn't seem to alter the end result on the second batch.....still awesome just a bit quicker to the end result and enjoying it.  Bacon sets up as it cools to become more of a bacon stick.   Any bacon lover will enjoy this ..... Yummmmmm!!!!!!

This is what we call "man candy"! You need to make the glaze thicker by adding more brown sugar to make a paste and instead of black pepper- red pepper flakes, oh yeah!! You might have to turn the oven up to get it cooked faster- but watch it so it doesn't burn :)

A co-worker previously made this recipe & it was delicious! I wish I had read some of the reviews as I probably needed double the sauce & more cooking time. However, it was still quite delicious less crisp & everyone ate it up at the Mothers Day brunch.

I've made this a few times now. Always use thick cut bacon, thinner bacon just won't hold up under the glaze. I also doubled the glaze. I use a rack in a sheet pan, essential to getting the bacon crisp. Liberal basting is key to a good crust. Let the bacon cook until the fat starts to render before you start basting. This year I used a spice rub prior to cooking. The rub I Used is called Fatboy's sweet rub. I sprinkled it on one side of the bacon before it went into the oven. It gave the bacon a little more depth of flavor. After the last baste, leave the bacon in until it is a deep mahogany color. After it comes out, let it cool just a bit before you plate it. I used a fish spatula to get it off the rack, it was a little bit of work but it came off ok. Plate it before the glaze sets a bit and it will become soggy. If you're going to let it set a bit before eating, stack it with parchment between the layers; that keeps the pieces separate and lets the glaze dry out more. It's always a hit when I bring it.

Excellent!
I made 4 lbs. of this for a Thanksgiving Day appetizer.  I recommend 5X the glaze for the 4 lbs.  I also recommend rotating the pan 180 degrees each time you put it back into the oven so the bacon cooks evenly across the pan.

I used Kuntzler bacon, my favorite and much more meaty than Oscar. This took a lot longer, so I mixed up some additional sauce. At the end I ran out of sauce, turned up to 400 degrees and it was perfect. Chef John, I love you and my Wife is jealous. Keep up the wonderful work, as you are turning me into a Chef!

Tasty result but I'll have to figure out a quicker way of cooking the bacon before I attempt this recipe again. The candying process took way more than 35 min. In fact, after 1-1/2 hrs., I was still candying, and the bacon still wasn't crisp, though it did harden once I gave up on cooking and let it cool. I didn't have a metal cooling rack, only one coated with a rubberized or plastic substance. Couldn't find one to purchase but was advised to try a silicone pan liner that was supposed to work for crisping bacon. I don't think it allowed enough air circulation for good crisping. Perhaps that's why it took so long. Good recipe but too labor intensive for me, with too little to show for the work involved.

Don't think that only men will flock towards this sweet salty deliciousness. I made this for a ladies brunch and it disappeared in seconds. I doubled the syrup and omitted the pepper. 
The only drawback of the recipe was the cooking. I was extra careful about lining up a foil-lined baking rack over a foil-lined sheet, and it spilled grease into my oven 10 minutes into cooking, smoking up my place. Besides the perfect placement of rack and sheet, turning every 5 minutes for a hour was too much work. I rescued the bacon and finished in the microwave, 2 minutes each side. Deliciousness with a lot less work!

Followed this recipe exactly. It turned out amazing! Very delicious! I used thick cut bacon, got 6 pieces of candied bacon. If more slices, need to double the basting mixture.

This is my 3rd time to make this bacon and it's fantastic!  Mine took longer, but I do get a thick cut bacon from my meat market.  It's dangerous stuff for sure, I could eat a pound or more of this stuff.  Delicious!!!

SWEET!  I used regular sliced bacon instead of thick slice.  There was just enough mixture.  It took me 5 coatings and they were done as they were thinner.  I didn't have any maple syrup so I used a recipe from this site called "Homemade Maple Syrup" and it was perfect.  Thank you Chef John for another wonderful recipe.  I can always count on you!

Oh, baby, this was good. Yes, labor intensive, and as other reviewers suggested, increase the thickness of the goo to make a paste vs. a liquid, as we also ran out and had to make more. Also baste and flip maybe every 10-15 minutes, vs. 5, but do keep an eye on. Worth the work. I even had to use normal thin-sliced bacon and it was fantastic.  Making it for the second time today! :)

Oh my goodness!!!!!  This is the best tasting and best smelling recipe that I’ve come across in a long time. I made it for my dad’s Bible study group (after checking out several pieces first!) and there was not a scrap left from a double batch!

Nobody has talked about the bacon being sticky (duh, right?) but I was afraid it would stick together in the mason jar vases I had it in. I also didn’t know about storing it.  So, I put it on a parchment lined baking sheet in and stacked the layers between parchment paper then put them in the fridge. It came clean and didn’t seem to stick at all.

Excellent! I baked a lb of bacon at 400 degF, doing half of it using this recipe, just to try it.  If you put the bacon on a rack, the fat would drop down;  I didn't, and it was swimming in it. The bacon still hardened up nicely after a while and is delicious!

This is a perfect recipe.  It is easier and tastes better than the old way I was making this. I used to sprinkle brown sugar, flip then repeat while hoping for even coverage.  This is easier to coat the bacon and I don't have to flip the bacon!!! It's a keeper.

I'm giving it 4 stars because this is very labor intensive. I realized it would be when I read the directions. However, I needed to cook mine for an additional 20 minutes. That's a lot of flipping! I finally got mine where I wanted it when I turned the temp up to 375 for the last 8 minutes.

I really want to learn to make candy bacon, and finally I did it, I follow the steps and it came out delicious... I transferred to a clean cold cookie pan for 20 minutes and it was ready to eat. I use bourbon maple syrup that I got last week from a maple syrup farm in NY.....crown maple syrup 
Light brown sugar, rice vinegar and I craket fresh pepper corn.

Like the others. Double the sauce and once you start basting, turn up the oven to 375. Opening up the oven every 5 mins doesn't keep it warm enough at 350.

I didn't have any maple syrup, so I used orange blossom honey,a dash of ground clover, and a dash of ground nutmeg instead. I also needed to make several batches of the candy mixture. Everyone loved it!

I just made this over the weekend to add the crumbled bacon on top of a barbecue chicken pizza.  It is a great recipe-quick and easy.  Given I have worked with the this vinegar in the past, I only used 1T of the vinegar.  It mixes well and gets thicker given the maple syrup after all is mixed together.  I baked each side of the bacon strips for 10 mins as the recipe calls; I then drained the bacon grease and then applied the mixture over each side of the bacon-baking at 5 min intervals each side until bacon was done as we like it.  GREAT to snack on later too!

Delicious. A bit involved with flipping and basting every 5 minutes to finish, but well worth the effort. Definitely let the bacon set for a bit before consuming because it gets so much better as it cools and the costing starts to thicken and harden. I didn't keep track of my final timing, but I'd guess a total of 35 minutes baking time.

Added approx 1-1/2 teaspoon of sandwich mustard instead of  rice vinegar, and marinated overnight in 1/2 of the baste in refrigerator. Then cooked in oven as directed. It was awesome! Served with crepes and waffles when I had overnight quests! It was a huge hit!

Ensure you use thick bacon.  If you can't find thick bacon, please wait.  I have made this multiple times for friends, and made the mistake of using regular bacon once.  Although this recipe always tastes great, thin bacon alters the taste and the carmelization of the candy.

I am not a bacon snob in any way, but this bacon is really good!  I could eat strip after strip.  The flavor is just outstanding!  It is a little time consuming taking it out of the oven, flipping it and then basting it every 5 minutes, but it is definitely worth every minute you spend doing it.  Thank  you, Chef John!

My bacon lover son frowned at the sound of "candied" bacon" (he as an under developed palate, it's a hard fought battle against chicken nuggets and wings) but he couldn't get enough this! I had to stop him after-all, this is candied BACON, no matter how pretty and innocent it sounds ! Sadly for our hearts, this is a keeper! Also, going Vegan has been postponed indefinitely.

Family absolutely loves it!  I felt like there wasn't enough marinade the first time I made it to go along with the cooking time.  I doubled the marinade the next time.  Had some left over but I'd rather have too much than too little.

I really hate to give anything with bacon a poor score, but I just did not care for this recipe at all. I LOVE bacon and keep seeing recipes for homemade candied bacon so I started craving it. I had everything on hand so figured I'd try this recipe. I doubled the basting sauce as  I saw in lots of other reviews and I used almost all of it. The recipe is very labor intensive and messy. I think t he brown sugar and syrup made it just way too sweet for me. I sprinkled half of my batch with some chili powder to give it a little and it didn't help much. My son who loves bacon also didn't care for it and told me to never make it again. The search continues for a good candied bacon recipe! Or maybe I'll just stick with regular ol bacon.

Results come out great but it's so much work to keep flipping and brushing the bacon vs just coating and leaving them in there.  But because it has the syrup and rice vinegar it will drip off if you put too much on at once so you kind of have to flip and brush a little at a time as the recipe suggests.  Note, this recipe also has a nice, slightly reddish hue when cooked vs. just brown sugar and no flipping.  So it's probably the best candied bacon recipe.  Just wish it wasn't so much work.

Loved it.  It took a lot of time with all the basting so I think I’d change how often I’d baste them. I had enough sauce and did not run out.

Great recipe.  Some advice.  If you have the option on your oven to convert or not.  I recommend NOT using convection.  Takes way longer for the bacon to crisp up.

I found that I needed to double the recipe and did 6/7 minutes after the initial 15 minutes.  Comes out great!  WARNING!!!  Soak the rack in hot water ASAP cuz it gets sticky...lol.  Also heavily spray your rack with non-stick and make sure to line your baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Wasn't sweet enough for me, but overall not bad! Bacon was cooked perfectly even though I baked on pan covered in foil and not a cooling rack (I don't have one LOL).  Would definitely make again, but use more sugar.

Absolutely PERFECT!! The *only* thing I did differently was after the initial brushing on both sides, I only brushed one side at a time and then put back in the oven (7 min per side), because I noticed as soon as I brushed one side and then immediately flipped the bacon over to coat the opposite side, the side I had just brushed lost the majority of the coating by just dripping off. It took slightly longer, but it was so worth it - better than restaurant quality, and the hubs and I have had our fair share, so that's really saying something!

Takes FOREVER to make but totally worth it for that special occasion.  These bacon strips ended up glazed and crisp to perfection and I will definitely make again when time affords.

SO GOOD!!!  If you can take the bacon out a bit beforehand so it can come to room temp.  Otherwise I think the initial cook should be a bit longer, maybe 5-10 min.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!

Well worth the wait, but make sure all the bacon is thick cut, thinner slices tend to stick to the pan and break apart. Would make again.

I made it per recipe, with the addition of adding cayenne pepper.  It added a sweet/hot combo.  This is a time consuming recipe - like making risotto... constant attention (basting the bacon every 5 minutes).

So easy and tasted so good
I added a small amount of Cheyenne Pepper otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

After reading reviews first, I added the extra syrup and set the heat at 375 right up front and 50 minutes later it was done.  OMG is it good.  Just wished I'd made more.

This bacon is delicious and is always a treat for my family on those slow summer mornings. Cooked mine a little longer, but that's just because I like it crispy.

This recipe was fantastic! I followed the advice of others and doubled the maple syrup. I ended up needing two batches of marinade for the one pound so next time i would double the entire recipe from the get go. On the second batch I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne. I think I’d add more next time but it was incredible! High maintenance recipe but easy in spite of that. Totally worth the effort!

Wow, is this ever good!  I made it exactly as stated, but I also added about 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper just to give it a little kick.  At 350º, it took forever for the bacon to crisp up, but I question if my oven is heating properly.  I bumped it up to 375º and a few min. longer, it was perfect.  A keeper!  Thanks, Chef John

I used this recipe while trying to duplicate a burger recipe from the famous Harry Carays Italian steakhouse. It turned out spot on! This is a fantastic recipe for candied bacon!  And on a sidenote, if you ever find yourself in a Harry Caray's restaurant you must try the Holy Cow  burger!

Not sure why but I needed to make three times the amount of basting sauce.    Basting  every 5 minutes was time- consuming but definitely worth it!  Talk of the party.

I made the first batch directly as the recipe called for and it did take a loooong time before it was done. Hubby wasn't real wild about this one - said he prefers his bacon "normal - not with the brown sugar mixture".  We do like the concept of bakin' the bacon, just won't be adding the brown sugar & maple syrup mixture to it.

Easy alteration for this recipe is to layer the cookie sheet with glaze then bacon then top with more glaze. That way there's no basting every 5 minutes I just cooked the bacon coated in the glaze for 35 minutes and it's done and delicious.  I also quadrupled the glaze recipe after reading other people's reviews.

Love it! I read other reviews & learned to double the glaze. I actually made 2lbs of thick cut bacon, cut the bacon in 1/2, and quadrupled the glaze recipe. Although it's alot of work (flipping, glazing, watching, etc) it's so worth it!! All I can say is make alot because it will go quickly in a room full of bacon lovers!!

I have been meaning to try this ever since it was in my Caesar Drink at Montana's. Yum, loved it in small doses, too much of a good thing and all. I did however increase cooking time to 7-10 min flip vs 5. Found it a bit time consuming, though everyone was appreciative and enjoyed.
Thank you

I just fry mine in frypan until done than pour maple syrup into pan and cook for 2 or 3 minutes than take it out, the grease stays in the pan but the maple syrup is on the bacon,let it cool a few minutes and it is just like candy.

Just finished making these today and OMG they are amazing!!  I doubled the sauce as others said and was glad I did. I also used 1 1/2 lbs. bacon and had enough sauce. I baked at 375 and took an hour to get done. Lots of basting and flipping time but well worth the results. Plan to use on club sandwiches tonite!!!
