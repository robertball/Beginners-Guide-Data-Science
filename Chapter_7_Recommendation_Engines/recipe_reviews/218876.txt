just made this recipe tonight and it is AMAZING! i followed the recipe almost exactly as written, but i only had a 9 1/2 inch pie pan, i upped the mushrooms (kind of on accident but i like it!) and covered the top with tomatoes. also, at the very end, i put the broiler on just for a few minutes to finish off the tomatoes. i highly highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be doing it again very soon! YUM! thanks, ddelisle!

Made this for Thanksgiving brunch, I thought it was very good but everyone else liked another breakfast casserole that I made off here.

I made this for company and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was, I used turkey sausage instead of pork sausage.
I would definitely make this again!

I made this for Christmas morning brunch.  The taste was nice, but I found it to be quite dry, even after adding 2 additional eggs as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I don't think I would make this recipe again as there are others I have tried before, that I like better.  For anyone wanting to try it, I'd suggest adding some sour cream or perhaps a can of cream soup.

Mae this for this morning's brunch For 13 folks.  Everyone liked it.  I did make some changes.  Put salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder on potatoes before cooking.  Also used half reg and half hot pork sausage.  Added onion to mushroom and sausage mix.  Used 10 eggs and 3/4 C milk plus 1/4 Cup half-n-half since I cooked it in a 9x13" dish.  Increased both cheeses to 1 Cup.  Very good and pretty with tomatoes on top.  Next time I'll serve with salsa on the side too!

I am a brunch casserole connoisseur and this is my new favorite! I sautéed my sausage with onions and mushroom and added a six more eggs.  I layered sausage mixture and cheeses on top of potatoes and poured the egg mixture over layers. It was fabulous and my family loved it!

I doubled the recipe as is and took it to my early morning study group of 15 women. Everyone raved about it. I do think though the next time I make it, I will mix up some salt and maybe a little pepper into the hashbrowns and oil before I press it in the dish to cook for 30 minutes. The seasoning in the egg mixture doesn't really affect the taste of the potato crust after it is cooked, thus my one small change.

Very good, I used hash brown potatoes with onion and peppers, also a smoked Swiss cheese, light sausage (used half a lb).  It was a hit and easy to put together.

Great fast dinner.  I cut back some on sausage and next time will add some of the salt to potatoes.  My kids ate it with ketchup and loved it.

Delicious - could probably cut the amount of sausage in half.  To lighten recipe, I'm going to try using Egg Beaters next time.

This was so much better than I expected it to be, and was totally worth the work. I couldn't find the hashbrowns, but had a bag of diced frozen potatoes in the freezer that I substituted. I ended up making a 9" pie and an 8" pie plate full, and we had it for a few days. Savory and filling, but it is a little work. This would be fantastic for a brunch or nice breakfast but not what you're looking for if you want something quick.

I made this casserole this morning and it was awesome. I've tried a few other breakfast casseroles before but this was the easiest and best tasting. I kept the receipe the same except I didn't have any parsley and I forgot to add the seasoning. I also sliced the tomatoes but left them on the side( I wasn't sure if everyone wanted tomatoes).The sausage, pepper jack cheese, and the potatoes (with the onion and green peppers) was all it needed!! I will definatly make this again!!

I too added two extra eggs and used a 9 X 13 pan because a pie plate didn't hold all the ingredients. Very dry, everyone who tried it told me to add a cream soup next time, but as a breakfast item, I don't care to try that. Probably won't make it again.

Well I made this tonight and it would have been really good had I not used the southwestern hash browns, way to spicy for me. I will definately make again but will use plain hash browns and add my own peppers and onions. I also used a 9x9 pan and found that I had to cook this 25 minutes longer...

Delicious! I had to make many changes based on what I had available, and this recipe allowed me to do that and still produce a great meal: I used a 28oz bag of potatoes O’Brien; since this was a spur of the moment undertaking I split the bag onto two dinner plates and cooked each one in the microwave on high for 3-4 minutes to thaw. Tossed the thawed potatoes 1/4 cup canola oil and lightly pressed them into a 9x13 glass baking dish. After 20 minutes in the oven the potatoes weren’t browning, so I sprayed a light layer of cooking spray on top. Although the spray didn’t help the potatoes brown, the overspray that coated the sides of the baking dish helped the egg/sausage/cheese mixture to not stick and cleanup was very easy. After 30 minutes the potatoes still hadn’t browned, but this turned out to be no problem at all. While potatoes were baking I cooked a 12oz roll of sage sausage and added 3/4 of a medium yellow onion, diced, to the sausage when it was 2/3 of the way done. Drained that to get rid of extra grease. At the advice of other reviewers I used 12 eggs instead of six to which I added salt, pepper, 1 tsp each garlic powder, ground mustard, and cayenne pepper, and 3/4 cup of 2% milk. Added the sausage/onion mixture to the eggs and then incorporated an 8oz bag of finely shredded mild cheddar. Spread the mixture on top of the potatoes and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Added sliced tomatoes to the top and broiled for 2 minutes. Despite all of the changes this was amazing.

I used ham in mine and used the fresh hashbrowns.  I really liked the way the potatoes cooked and then adding the eggs, cheese, milk and green onions with the ham.  I'll make this again with left over raw hashbrowns.

This was really good, perfect for MOPS breakfasts.  I cooked the potatoes in the dish the night before and used precooked sausage so there was less to do in the morning.

Just make it on a potluck and everyone enjoyed it! I didn't find pepperjack cheese so I used Swiss cheese and cheddar instead. I also added a cup of sweet peas just for some extra veges. Btw i used a 9*13 pan rather than a pie pan. I used a bag of hash brown and vege mix(670g) and it is the perfect amount for the pan size!! You should definitely try this recipe!!!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the hashbrowns cooked for about 45 min in the oven without turning golden brown and were still soggy, I finally got them out and fried them in a pan for about 20 min.

Very good.  I added fried onions to the hash browns.  Also sautéed onions (my husband loves onions in just about everything) and the mushrooms before adding to the eggs.  I think I would add sour cream next time as suggested by another reviewer.  I'd definitely make this recipe again

Great breakfast casserole for those who don't love eggs. Interesting flavor and was happy to serve a more interesting breakfast casserole than usual.

This is a great recipe, for any meal! It’s easily adaptable by using the types of vegetables and cheese that you have on hand and according to the taste of your family. I use more eggs and cook longer to make the dish go farther for our five family members. Iwill say that the first time I made this, I browned the hashbrowns in a frying pan before putting them into the pie plate.The second time I made it, I followed the recipe instructions, but wish I had browned them first. The taste of the potatoes is much better if they are browned before baking.???

So easy to make and fun to tweak.  I went ‘south western’ and added chorizo and avocado.  Yum!

I did not make any changes.  We had it for supper.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.  I might switch out the sausage for ground beef for a change.

Made exactly according to the recipe for my office. Many people liked that this was a little lighter, but overall, I thought it lacked flavor. If I make this again, I might season the potatoes more and add peppers to the egg mixture.

One of the best egg casseroles I have ever had.  I did use extra salt on the hashbrowns, but other than that I did not change a thing.  I baked it the night before and then heated it up in the morning.  I will be making this on Christmas morning.

This recipe was great ! Everyone loved it and I will make it again. I tweaked it just a little though. I chopped fine about half a medium onion  and cooked  it and the mushrooms along with the sausage. I also sprinkled a little cheese on top of the tomatoes before I put it back in the oven for the last 5 minutes. We loved it!!

My favorite aspect of this recipe is the hash browns crust.
I regularly cook brunch casseroles for our group brunches and adding the hash browns crust brought a novel change to my regular egg based casserole.
For our group, I scaled-up to a 10.5" x 14.75" (4 Qt) dish.
I used 9 eggs instead of the suggested 6 eggs.  The crust required about 30 oz. of hash browns ( 1 1/2 bags).  For the filling I first fried about 6 slices (chopped-up) of bacon. I  then removed the bacon and drained most of the grease. Then I  added 1lb of ground sausage to the pan . When done, I removed the cook sausage adding it to the cooked bacon bits and sautéed onions, garlic, mushrooms.  Add a little chicken broth or a bit of cream sherry. I also added 1 can of mild chili to add a little zest. The added liquid will deglaze the pan and add to the broth.  Add seasoning to taste and add back the sausage and bacon. Reduce till most of the liquid is gone.
cover and add to the egg / cheese mixture.
Per the recipe, to the prepared hash brown crust add  the eggs mixture. bake as described.  Our brunch group was very happy with the result.  Thank you for ideas!

This was delicious! Used a 9x13 pan to cook a 20oz bag of refrigerated hash browns. Didn't have the original recipe ingredients on hand so made the following changes. To make this vegetarian I used 2 chipotle field road meat alternative sausages. Threw in chopped asparagus and a red bell pepper with the eggs. When taking the hash browns out - I laid 6 slices of pepper jack cheese directly on the potatoes. Added the egg/veg mixture and baked an additional 30 minutes. This was so good - my husband kept going back for more. This recipe will definitely make it into our dinner rotation.

Very tasty.  I forgot to add the tomato's on top - we were a bit busy on Easter morning.  Easy to make.  I browned the hash browns in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400.  Added a bit more sausage, less cheese and large sliced mushrooms.  You can't ruin this recipe if you're looking for comfort food.

I made this to use up hash browns- didn’t have mushrooms or sausage but cooked 1 diced red pepper and one onion plus 1/2 jalapeño and added to potatoes before baking. I had more potatoes than asked for so I had to use a 9x13 pan. I kept the egg-cheese-milk ratio the same and it came out great! Just keep an eye on baking time as I think it baked faster in the larger dish. Very filling and adaptable.

i was running late for dinner and couldn't find my 8x8 pan so used a muffin tin instead.  this allowed a reduced cooking time about 15 min total for the egg/tomato stages.  also didn't thaw the frozen potatoes, used a pound of sausage because that was the package size, used half the cheese - some good jalapeno pepper jack, no mushrooms.  did add garlic salt to the potatoes as other suggested and a bit of cayenne pepper to the egg mixture and onions sauteed with the sausage.  with the reduced time to cook the potatoes and the eggs, nothing was dry or crispy, but definitely a good breakfast for dinner option.

I made this for a baby shower yesterday and it was a hit. I was so nervous to make this because I hate using new recipies for a party.  I did make some changes. I used frozen hash potatoes and baked them in the casserole dish the night before.  I also used smoked turkey sausage and sauteed them with peppers, green onions, and fresh garlic in a garlic and herb infused sunflower oil from Wegmans.  The next morning I used 12 eggs, 1 cup of swiss cheese, and 1 cup of pepper jack cheese and poured it into the sausage mix.  I added salt and pepper, then poured them into the prepared casserole dish.  I had to bake mine for 60 minutes at 350.  Not a piece left!

This was terribly dry.  I will try it again and use far less potato and double the egg.  It was very dry, and mostly tasted of potato.

Good quiche. I'd probably include more vegetables next time. Bell peppers, onions, etc.
