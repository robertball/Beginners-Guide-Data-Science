I added some purple basil to the spinach salad and didn't have blue cheese, so added Parmesan.  Also was out of pecans, so I toasted some pine nuts.  The dressing is great - substituted splenda instead of sugar.  Looks pretty and tastes great!

This was great!  With fresh walleye, the salad was subtle and delicious.  With red meat (venison) the salad was outstanding.

I changed it up a little and used feta since I really don't like blue cheese.  I also substituted real maple syrup for the sugar.  I used a bag of lettuce because, as my sister says, I'm the jiffy mom.  

The dressing was really quite delicious with these ingredients.

Sorry - Made this recipe as stated.  Much too sour/tart/bitter? for my family's taste. I added more sugar, and while it was better, we just didn't care for it.

A  go-to salad - we all loved it with romaine lettuce instead of spinach.  Cut the oil down to 1/3 cup.  DO use candied pecans - I suspect those reviewers who thought it was too tart didn't use them, as they balance the flavour.

It was a little too tart for me as well, so I added a little more sugar...actually doubled it and then a pinch. I also added mint which made it amazing!

just made this tonight to go with dinner and everyone loved it.  although i gave it a 5, there was one thing we all found issue with.  the dressing.  i know many seemed to like it and i followed the directions exactly, but found the dressing too oily and tasted like it was missing something.  i will look around for another dressing and be making this salad again soon.

Made it as written and it was awesome!  I made my own candied pecans with brown sugar and blueberry balsamic vinegar.

This salad was a hit for pot-luck party!  A pound of fresh spinach makes a large portion.  I was looking for a recipe to use blueberries in my freezer from last season, and they worked very well in this salad.  Can't wait to try with fresh blueberries in a couple of weeks.

April and May is blueberry picking season and I needed a recipe to enjoy them.  I also use iceberg lettuce mixed with spinach.  I don't use as much oil  in the dressing.  I recently tossed it together at a picnic and everyone enjoyed it, they never thought the combination of blueberries, spinach, lettuce  and blue cheese would be so good!

Loved this! I have made this twice now. I used frozen blueberries instead and let them thaw in the dressing. When it was time to serve, I shook the dressing, berries and all, and poured and tossed. I toasted and candied my own pecans as well. Yummy!

I've made this salad several times recently since blueberries are in season (although I think you could use frozen that are thawed).  All the ingredients together make a delightful mix.  I did cut back a bit on the oil and didn't use all the dressing as I am trying to cut back on calories and it didn't affect this wonderful salad. Also I did no candy the pecans for the same reason. All in all a healthy delicious choice for dinner with fish as main course.

This salad is huge. My family and guests loved it. We fed 8 and had left overs. My daughter suggested regular pecans instead of candied ones next time. I agree. They added unnecessary sweetness to an already sweet salad. I also used half balsamic vinegar and half balsamic vinegar infused with blueberries. Very nice!

Quick & easy to make and always a hit...my family requests it over and over.  Can change up the cheese ...feta, blue, goat, etc.  I sometimes add bacon for a little something extra.

We loved this salad. I added red onion. The dressing is light and refreshing. I did not have any Dijon mustard so I made my own. Thanks for this yummy salad recipe.

Great recipe!  The dressing really makes the salad.  I substitued the blue cheese with feta cheese and everyone liked it.  I made it a second time and used blueberry-infused craisons instead of the blueberries.  It was even better and is a nice alternative when you can't get fresh blueberries.

I tried this recipe tonight at the last minute because I had all the ingredients. If your blueberries are not super sweet, add a little more sugar to the dressing. You can really eyeball the ingredients for this salad and you can't miss.  Very good !

Rave reviews!  I didn't have candied pecans - so just toasted them with a little salt.

I didn't have the red wine or pecans so I used balsamic and walnuts.  It was so yummy.  Can't wait to have it again.
