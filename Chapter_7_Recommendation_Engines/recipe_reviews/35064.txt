We made this recipe a bit healthier...a delicious breakfast treat!
I used freshly ground whole wheat instead of white flour, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon (kept nutmeg at 1 tsp), upped the salt to 1 tsp (but used yummy sea salt), used cold butter in place of shortening, used 1/2 cup plain yogurt as we didn't have sour milk on hand, used 2 cups zucchini, and a whole cup of the walnuts.  I could not even stir the batter, it was so thick, and so added a splash of milk -- worked like a charm.
These muffins were not light and fluffy as others attested to, no doubt because of the whole wheat, butter, and extra nuts.  They were hearty, tasty, and very satisfying.  We  will make these often!

With just a few changes/additions, these are my family's favorite breakfast on the go!  I substitute 1 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 shredded apple and one shredded carrot for 1/2 C of the zucchini. I also heap the t of cinnamon and have switched to pumkin pie spice (as I was out of nutmeg).  It adds a little zing and they are super moist!  IQF them on a cookie sheet for about 10 minutes after they are completely cooled and then throw them in a Ziploc for easy storage.  When someone wants one, zap it at 50% power for 30 sec and full power for 15.  It's just like they were straight out of the oven!  Thanks for this one!

I hate rating recipies if I've altered the ingredients, because then I'm not rating the one listed but the one I created.  But I feel, for this recipe, my changes didn't alter the end product that much, and if anything, the original recipe may even be better.

Instead of all white flour, I use 1 1/4 white, 1/2 cup of whole wheat, 1/2 c flaxseed meal and 1/2 c wheat germ.  I left the sugars the same and used 2 heaping tsp. of cinnamon and 1 heaping tsp. of nutmeg.  I used probably more like 1 2/3 cup of shredded zucchini, which I squeezed out first.

The same amount of milk and salt and real butter rather than shortening (I don't do fake foods).  These muffins were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I'd never had zucchini muffins before, so I was surprised at the nice sweet taste these had.  I will make these again and again.

EXCELLENT! These are really tasty. We just finished making them and my family is WOWED! We did some of the adjustments from previous reviews and they turned out perfect. We added 1/8 cup more milk, used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Instead of so much baking powder we used 1 1/2 tsp powder and 1 1/2 soda. To lessen the "baking powder" taste. The are moist, light and full of flavor! This recipe is a keeper!

Super yummy! I took the advice of pervious posters and doubled the milk and cinnamon, and added a little extra nutmeg. I also used a little more walnuts than called for, and added a handful of raisins. I used naturally sour raw milk rather than milk and vinegar, and also used a stick of softened butter rather than shortening. So good! I will make these again for sure!

I can't believe how light and fluffy these muffins are. I was a bit heavy handed with the cinnamon and nutmeg, and thought the flavor was tasty. I was out of walnuts and used almonds and those worked well. I think next time I make them I will probably substitute some apple sauce for the shortening.

I cut the sugar back a bit, to a touch more than a half cup. I used a teaspoon each of baking powder/baking soda and instead of using a whole half cup of shortening, I used a quarter cup of melted butter and a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce. At the last minute, I added a little more than a half cup of raisins that I soaked in hot unsweetened chai tea before I added them to the batter. I actually got 18 muffins out of this recipe that were a bit on the large side and mine were done in a little over 20 minutes. These were so good! The kids and I just loved them. It's one of the best muffins I've had all month. My oldest boy ate four and asked for more! This recipe's a keeper.

These are unreal!  I've made them twice now and the second time I made them healthier by using less sugar (and I use turbinado, which always tastes better in baking to me), more zucchini, and substituting apple sauce for the lard, and voila--they tasted even BETTER than the first time!  also DON'T forget that sprinkling of brown sugar on top, it balances out the taste perfectly.  my housemates hear the word "zucchini" now and their eyes light up.

Super easy and yummy.  I peel the zucchini before shredding it because my younger son will not eat it if he knows it's in there!  =)  I've made this several times and a few times I've used mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts, if I'm serving it to kids with allergies.  EASY, PEASY!!!!!

Great recipe! After reading the reviews, I too made some adjustments. 1 cup white flour, 1 cup wheat flour, 1/4 milled flax, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar... also, I don't use shortening, so I cut in 1 stick of butter. I may try applesauce next time. I also used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg- and I didn't have any walnuts, so I decided to try chopped dates instead, and they REALLY are great in this recipe. I'll be using this one often:)

SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! This is a recipe I will keep and use often. I followed the recipe exactly the first time which I think is the only way to give a fair review.  I like that these muffins are light and fluffy and not heavy as when oil is used.  The second time I added raisins along with the nuts with equally perfect results.

Good way to have my kids eating zucchini! They turned out perfect, moist and light at the same time. I put some cocoa powder, yogurth instead of sour milk (I had to put more than the recipe requested or the batter wouldn't have been manageable), real butter and 2 cups of shredded zucchini. I'll keep this one!

Wonderful is the word to describe these muffins, fluffy, light and my 3 and 1 year olds LOVED them as did the grown-ups.  I added raisins instead of the walnuts.

Delicious! Based on reviews I tweaked this a little: subbed 1/2 C of WW flour for 1/2 C of the all-purp flour, used a scant 1/2 C each of brown and white sugar, used 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp soda, doubled the cinnamon, used butter instead of shortening, yogurt instead of sour milk (with an added splash of milk while mixing to moisten batter just a bit), and added 1/2 C grated apple to the zucchini (after gathering the shredded zucchini in my hands to squeeze out some of the water... hmmm... maybe don't squeeze the zucchini and then you won't have to add the extra milk?). The muffins are light, tender, and will disappear as soon as the kids get home from school, I am sure.

Excellent recipe! Make sure to grease & flour muffin pans heavily. We made regular size (no paper liners) & Mini Muffins (with paper liner & greased the lip of the pan for expansion of batter above the liner). Cooked minis for 12 min.  Used H&H w/ vinegar for the "sour" milk. Batter is quite thick, which is OK. Zucchini leeches water when cooked, so they came out super moist and perfect. Very hardy muffins, with just a touch of sweetness.  I can't stop eating them.

These muffins are good, not great.  They are not incredibly sweet like zucchini bread.  I would leave the nuts out next time.  Not really dense enough to appreciate the nuts.

Great!  I had to modify with what I had around the house....so I used an oil/applesauce mix instead of butter, some milk and some plain yogurt rather than sour milk, added some shredded coconut, didn't have nuts, used part white part brown sugar too.  The texture is great and the flavor is really nice, a bit spicy and not too sweet.  Nice recipe, thank you!

My brother grew some whopper size zucchinis and I have never baked with them before.  I tried this recipe, doubled it up, and I added an extra cup of grated zucchini and extra cinnamon as I love it soooo much (also added some raisons just because they fit in everything, but that is a personal option)...and waited for the results from the oven.  They took an extra 10 minutes to bake, but I have to say that this recipe is absolutely awesome!  The brown sugar sprinkled on the top add such a caramel type touch...I've eaten two already!  If you like fresh zucchini, definiately try these, you will not be disappointed!!! Thanks Jessi for submitting this wonderful recipe!

Really yummy and moist! I used whole wheat flour and butter instead of shortening.... Shortening kinda scares me with all the hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils. Were great and still perfectly fluffy and light!

Love this recipe.  I adapted it to fit what I had on hand to make it.  Instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup applesauce and mixed it in with the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients.  Also I did not use sour milk, instead I put a mixture of 2% and coffee mate creamer into it.  These are great.

Terrific.  Makes great jumbo muffins, too.  Try a half tsp. of flor di sicilia in place of the vanilla for a bright, summery taste.

I followed this recipe pretty closely except added a little more cinnamon and nutmeg.  The muffins were very bland still and just seemed to be missing something. I could also taste the baking powder as another reviewer had mentioned. Edible but NOT incredible!

This is a nice start for a good recipe. However, it does lack a bit of flavor.  First batch I made according to the recipe. Second batch had a few modifications - butter instead of shortening gave a better flavor.  I added a half of a grated apple and about 3/4 cup of grated carrots.  I also doubled the cinnamon, halved the nutmeg, added a bit of allspice and a tiny bit of ground cloves.  So, it really becomes a different recipe, but the base of the recipe is good.

I was a bit surprised at how dry and dense the batter was, but the muffins turned out moist, light and delicious.  This is a recipe I will make again.

Great, quick muffin. I had to bake mine about 4-5 minutes longer than 20 minutes, but they have a nice texture and a good, summery taste. I subbed plain yogurt for sour milk, and ended up putting a little extra zucchini in the mix. I'm looking forward to trying this with whole wheat flour and adding oats. Great recipe as is, however.

These are great muffins.  I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips as if there is chocolate in them, my kids will eat them.  These are a hit at home as well as in my daycare.  These muffins have become a favorite around here.

I thought these muffins were just ok (a little bland) while my friend thought they were really good (he liked the muffin tops) - therefore the 4 star rating. I was a little thrown by the thickness of the batter and added extra milk - they came out fluffy and moist. I did change the topping and added some cinnamon, butter and flour to the brown sugar - this makes it sweet and crunchy and adds a little flavor.

These muffins are good IF you do the following (in my humble opinion!)Double the salt and mix it with the shredded zucchini and let it drain in a colander while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Then, squeeze the zucchini out in a dry kitchen towel, ringing out as much water out as possible. Double the spices, and a 1/2 tsp of each spice to the brown sugar for the topping. Don't worry, this batter is THICK, like a biscuit almost, but it turns out great, worth a try.

I thought these muffins were just okay.  I thought they were a bit bland, but I forgot to add the sugar on top, so perhaps that was the problem.  I made Abby's Zucchini loaf at the same time, and my kids preferred that over these by a long shot.  My son (5), a muffin lover...did not like these.  I ate one, and my 2 year old sorta picked at hers, the rest I ended up giving to my husband to take to work.  Now, the ladies at the office liked them.  I think they are simple and light, with not enough spice.  PS:I used butter instead of shortening (only due to the fact that I don't use trans fats).  The consistency was still good.

I made some healthy substitutions, but even with that they were wonderful! I did 1 c. white flour, 1 c. whole wheat flour, and 1/4 c. mixed wheat germ and flax seed meal. I used less sugar and 1/4 c. shortening and 1/4 c. apricot puree (in place of applesauce, just because I had it!) I did some with nuts and some without and just a few with brown sugar and found I liked the plain ones best--no nuts and no extra sugar! They were very light and fluffy and delicious! My kids loved them too!

Just like the others stated, the muffins tasted a bit bland. I think I would try adding a bit more cinnamon/pumpkin spice and add either pineapple or applesauce for a bit more moisture. Otherwise, these muffins are pretty good and "light" tasting

These were really good.  However, I didn't think there was enough liquid in the recipe, so I doubled the milk.  They turned out very light and fluffy.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I doubled the cinnamon instead.  I used a zucchini that I picked out of the garden this morning.  My husband claims that he hates zucchini, so I didn't tell him that I used it in the muffins.  He thought the muffins were great!

I didn't have enough zucchini to yield 1 1/2 c. so I added grated carrots.  I lessened the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  The batter seemed thick but in the end, the muffins came out great.  It yielded 18 and not 12.  Most important to me -- my 2 kids (2 and 4)loved them.

Really good! Used mostly whole wheat flour and used butter and yogurt in place of shortening and sour milk. Added 2tbsp grd flax. Didn't need sugar on top. Kids gobbled them up! Oh, also used shredded carrot for extra veggies. Added extra almond milk cause so thick, also pumpkin pie spice from this site, yum!

This is my favorite muffin recipe, by far.  I've made them with no variation and with every other variation under the sun...sub in carrot and ginger, used oat flour with orange and nutmeg, whole wheat flour and flax, applesauce, egg whites...you name it, I've tried it and had a lot of success, only ever drying out one batch so far (you really need at least one egg yolk in there). Definitely a must for your recipe collection!

Very yummy, but a little high in sugar for a breakfast muffin in my opinion.  I may try it again with less white sugar and skipping the brown sugar altogether.  Great taste from the zucchini (I used shredded apple too based on a review) and cinnamon/nutmeg.

This was ok, with a little tweaking. I did double the cinnamon. I also doubled the nutmeg, which I'm not gong to next time. It was overpowering. I added a bit more sugar and used half wheat flour and half regular flour. Ill make these again, and also, grate the zucchini with the fine grater, not the bigger one.

These muffins were ok, but not fantastic.  I'm not sure I'd make them again, because they smell so much like zucchini.  Didn't fool my kids at all -- they were pretty suspicious and only picked at them.

This was a great recipe!  I ran out of brown sugar so I cooked the muffins and after they came out of the oven I dipped the top in some melted butter and rolled it in a cinnamon & sugar mixture.  Super light and fluffy. Also, I did not add any nuts and just used regular milk. I did use extra cinnamon and nutmeg as others suggested...will FOR SURE make again!

Overall, these were really good.  They are, however, a bit bland.  The brown sugar on the top is definately a must!  Making them was easy, except the zucchini was a pain to shred.  I ended up finely chopping about half of the zucchini because I was sick of shredding it.  I will definately be making these again though.

This was the thickest muffin batter I have ever seen.  But, with that said they were very light and moist.  They are lacking a little in flaver, next time I may adding some apple or carrot to boost the flavor.

Really good and baked better then any other muffin I’ve made. Only 2 changes, I used buttermilk in place of sour milk and pecans in place of walnuts. I really liked the way these muffins raised in baking to give a nice raised top.

I added part Applesauce for the oil.  I didn't like the texture of the muffin.  Maybe it was because of the applesauce, but i've used this substitution many times and I have always liked the product before!

Thanks for a great recipe, Jessi! I read the reviews and made the following changes: 
1 cup whole wheat flour (or 1/2 cup each whole wheat flour and flax seed),
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour,
1/2 cup white sugar,
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder,
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda,
1/2 cup butter,
1/4 cup vanilla yogurt,
splash of milk, and 
skipped the brown sugar topping.
It was a hit with all six of us, including four kids ages 1, 4, 6 & 8. Thank you!

These were kind of dry and tasted like flour. Not enough spice. I doubled the recipe and went back and checked to make sure I followed it correctly. I think the issue for me was in the technique -- when doubling it's quite a lot of mix to handle, hand mixing. Cutting in the butter and then making the well just made it difficult to incorporate wet and dry. Not sure why the extra work of cutting in butter is necessary for a quick bread/muffin recipe.

These were really good. The only change I made was I added another teaspoon of cinnamon as my kids love it. It was really easy to pull together too. It was a great way to use extra zucchini. This is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely wonderful! My first ever attempt at using zucchini in bread and this was easy and tastes wonderful! The only modifications I made were to sub 6 T sugar substitute instead of the 1 cup of sugar and then as mentioned by another user, used a small container of yogurt instead of the sour milk. (not sure that it matters but I used cherry yogurt) Have a feeling I will be using this recipe again and again! Thank you!

I made this recipe with a few tweaks.  I used a little over 3/4 low fat Butter milk (1/4 cup milk is not enough), 2 cups shredded zucchini, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 1 cup chopped walnuts, and 1/2 cup of dried chopped cranberries.  I omitted brown sugar topping not needed.  This mixture made 8 large muffins.  They are wonderful dense but still moist, slightly sweet & spicy with walnuts & cranberries adding texture and a little zing. Next time will try using 1/2 wheat flour as others have suggested and 3/4 cup of  dried cranberries roughly chopped.  If your kids don't like veggies just call them cranberry spice muffins.

These were perfectly tender and delicious. Sorry to rate a recipe I changed so much but per other reviews, I used half wheat flour, half brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. each baking powder and soda, butter, and extra milk (about 3/4 c. total).   Topped with brown sugar, flour, butter mixture. Kids gobbled them up.

The texture was perfect and it was so delicious! Tip for mixing in the shortening: blend the shortening with the raw zucchini and use the backside of a spoon to kind of smash them together against the side of a bowl. Then add eggs and other liquids. I found that to be easier than mixing the shortening with the solids.

These turned out really good - just be sure not to overmix the batter.  This seems to be the secret of moist cupcakes.  Anyways, the only changes I made were to use butter instead of shortening, and I omitted the nuts as these were for my daughter's snack at school, and can't bring anything in that has nuts in case someone has a nut allergy.  Oh, and I forgot the brown sugar sprinkling on top, but they still turned out good.  Great way to get your kids to eat some veggies!

SO GOOD! I only made a couple slight changes to this. I didn't have shortening so I used margarine. I omitted the walnuts and added a shredded carrot as suggested by another reviewer. Also instead of sour milk I used greek yogurt. They took a little longer than 20 minutes to bake because I overfilled the cups. They taste amazing. Incredibly moist. I will definitely make these muffins again. I like that the recipe is easy to throw together in basically one bowl with one spoon without having to dig out the mixer.

They were amazing. Instead of muffins, i did 4 mini loaves.  I used all whole wheat flour, left out the nuts, and didn't sprinkle with brown sugar. These were so good and everyone loved them!

These muffins are very tasty - great recipe! As a few other suggested, I doubled the milk - it just helped the batter be a bit thinner, its quite thick. Mine took the full 20 minutes to cook and I got 17 muffins from this recipe. I am definitely keeping this recipe for future use! A great way to use the abundance of zucchini coming from my garden!

I loved this recipe, i made it exactly as posted texture and flavor were both wonderful. I did however place a creamcheese filling in the centers which is placed before baking. The recipe for this filling is called Cheese filling right here on allrecipes:)
