Decrease the sugar to 2 cups. I didn't use food coloring. Instead I folded in 1/2 c crushed peppermint candies and 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract. Yum!!

I made this and I agree, it is too sweet.  But I made a second batch and put 1 cup less sugar in it and a little bit more marshmallow cream and it turned out perfect.

I followed the warnings of previous reviewers and I only used 1 3/4 c sugar, but I would have been fine with only 1 1/2 c. The texture was soft, so as long as it is served cold it is fine. It does look very pretty though, and it is a great addition to my Christmas cookie gift plates.

I made this last night, it turned out great.  I added about 1 cup of walnuts. 
This recipe added the color I need to the goodie boxes I made up. 
This one is a keeper!!!!!!

This fudge is very, very sweet.  I love fudge, but even this was a little too much for me.  I brought it to the office and most felt the same way.

This recipe was MUCH too sweet.  One bite and you're done.  It looks very festive, however, and is good to bring to holiday parties.  Beware the sugar, though!

Tried making this. Only use 1 1/2 cups of sugars instead of 3! I found that using canned milk works better than the heavy cream. And instead of separating to add color, dip a tooth pick or knife in coloring and swirl around until desired coloring!

I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was still a bit sweet for me. Walnuts are good for balancing it out though. I didnt want to use food coloring so I put a cup of it aside, mixed it with a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and dropped it back in  and swirled it. It looks really good an adds variety of flavor.

I followed the recipe to a T.  It turned out pretty, but it was way too gritty, as if the sugar never fully dissolved (even though I used a candy thermometer and cooked it to the right temp).  I will try one more time and use less sugar and more marshmallow cream.  Maybe that will make a difference.

Very happy with the way this turned out. I did do as suggested with a cup less sugar and an extra scoop of marshmallow cream. And instead of separating the fudge into thirds. Just dropped food coloring and then ran a knife thru the color. I think it turned out beautiful and it taste delicious too

READ BEFORE USING RECIPE! I noticed the Fantasy Fudge recipe I tweaked to make White Chocolate Fudge has identical quantities of ingredients to this one. In my experience using half and half makes fudge way too sweet! (Assuming heavy cream makes fudge way sweeter since it contains more milk fat than half and half) I switched the heavy cream with evaporated milk, mother LOVED the fudge even more than the store bought ones! :) Using an extra ounce of chocolate won't hurt ;)

We cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it was still very sweet.  Very festive and tasty though.  The kids really enjoyed it.

Probably one of the first recipes I've followed to a T on allrecipes...and one of the first I've ever started without reading the reviews first! I am not a sweets person so these are DEFINITELY too sweet for me, wish I'd followed the reviews and decreased the sugar. Ultimately the kids and hubs thought it was pretty good, though also a bit too sweet. Pretty, we also crushed candy canes for the top. Merry christmas!
