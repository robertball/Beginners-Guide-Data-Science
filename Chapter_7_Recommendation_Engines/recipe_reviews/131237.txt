This soup was okay, much better the next day. It was a little bland for our taste. The soy sauce was lost in the soup. If I make this again, I'll add at least a tablespoon of soy sauce and will add chicken.

Excellent basic barley soup recipe. The (small) changes I made were to add some squash, no turkey, and red wine instead of wine. Seems to be a very forgiving recipe.

Have made this soup twice now, and both times have gotten rave reviews. The only change I made the second time around was to add more carrots and celery.

Delicious and easy, a great meal to warm you up on a cold rainy night!  I use vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian and cooked the barley separately in my rice cooker so it maintains it's chewiness without getting soggy if left inside the broth.

Followed some suggestions..red wine (because it was already open) and more soya. Added abit of Old Bay to counteract the blandness some mentioned. Surprisingly good!

I thought this soup had good overall flavor and I enjoyed it.  I couldn't find turkey broth so I ended up using turkey stock which made it a little thicker than I expected.  I think I would enjoy it even more if I'd used broth instead of stock.  In the future if I cannot find turkey broth I will just use chicken broth.

This is terrific!  I added a bit more barley, 2 peeled and seeded chayote squashes, doubled the mushrooms with a combination of fresh and dehydrated types (shiitake, porcini, and baby portobello), and added a pound of lean ground beef.  I also used the liquid from the reconstituted mushrooms in place of some of the broth.  Added a small amount of marjoram and lemon pepper, and more salt to taste.  Definitely will be making this again.

This was a huge hit.  Super hearty and full of flavor.  I did make a few additions... I added a whole minced onion and took another reviewer's suggestion for a tablespoon of soy sauce.  Also, I doubled the carrots and celery.  All in all, a delicious, healthy meal!

I made this soup twice so far. It is perfect just the way it is. Just be aware that after refrigerating it gets pretty thick so you need to add water.  I used bouillon cubes (chicken). It's a hearty and nourishing soup. Just what the doctor ordered!

Warm, comforting and flavorful. I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. Omitted the soy sauce because I'm not a fan. Had a couple potatoes to use up so diced and added with the carrots and celery. Wonderful winter soup.

Loved this soup.  Delicious, tangy broth.  It is like this "simple" soup with this really tasty broth.  Will definitely make again

This soup was great!!! A huge hit. It was very concentrated though, so I'm not sure how much juice will be left tomorrow. The recipe called for 2 cups of water, but it never said where to add them. I think I should have added them anyways. This was delicious though
