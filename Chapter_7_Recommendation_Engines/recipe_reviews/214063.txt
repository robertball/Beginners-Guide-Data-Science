One of the best recipes I have ever made from this site!  This was a huge success at our dinner party last night.  I used Gorgonzola (husband doesn't like blue cheese).  Doubled the garlic because we are big fans and used spring mix for Arugula because the market was out of just Arugula.  Thanks Morgan for sharing my favorite new recipe!

I made this with the ingredients listed.  Instead of putting the nuts, carrots and oil in the oven, I lightly greased a sheet and did just the carrots.  I whisked the oil with the vinegar, honey, garlic and S&P.  I added the cooled carrots with the nuts and fruit and then tossed it, adding the lettace at serving time.  This is different flavor with a pretty presentation.  I will make again and again!

This is delicious as a sidedish, more so than a salad.  I made EXACTLY as the recipe stated (for all you purists out there!), and I will make it again, but next time there are several minor things I'd do differently.  #1 - I'd cut back on the oil, or perhaps omit the oil & spray the carrots with a spritz or two of Pam cooking spray before roasting (they get a little soggy with all that oil). #2 - increase the slivered almonds and the dried cranberries -- at least 1/2 cup of cranberries (which I soaked in hot water for a few minutes & then drained, to soften them).  #3 - Decrease the blue cheese crumbles -- the flavor was a little over-powering!  #4. Omit the argula or substitute baby spinach leaves.    We ate it mixed with the greens at first, but then decided we liked it better as just a carrot/cranberry/almond sidedish, served at room temperature.     Thanks for the recipe Morgan Nowicki. Very good!

If I could give this 7 stars I would.  This is so over the top yummy! Just from reading the recipe I knew it would be good so I made a huge batch for a potluck. It evaporated it was gone so fast. Only thing I did different is since I tripled the recipe, I only doubled the garlic. But still soooooooo yummy.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a very delicious salad with a wonderful unique flavor, however I feel the blue cheese is much too strong and sharp for the delicateness of this salad.  Next time I would use feta or goat cheese.

I love this recipe! I have to say it kind of annoys me when people review after completely changing the original recipe ... that said, I did make one addition. Because I have a huge amount of beets in the garden, I added small diced beets to the roasting pan with the diagonally sliced carrots, etc. It was actually a good combination, and a nice color addition as well. I'll def make this salad again! In the future I'll double or even triple it ... so good the next day!

Absolutely fabulous salad! The carrots are just the right balance of sweet and savory. The addition of blue cheese and cranberries makes it even more perfect, and the almonds give the perfect crunch. The carrots also make a great side dish by themselves without the greens and cranberries. I can't rave enough about this recipe!

Delicious! This would be great served with Christmas dinner as the dried cranberries remind me of that time of the year. Only changes were the use of regular lettuce and baby carrots simply because I had them on hand. The sweet from the carrots, tart from the dried cranberries and tang from the blue cheese blend well together, no need for a vinaigrette of any sort. Simple and full of flavour! We'll be making this again for sure.

So delicious.  I did make some changes since I used what I already had in the house.  Added roasted beets, used pecans instead of almonds, spinach instead of arugula, and goat cheese instead of blue cheese!

5 star taste, the 4 stars was because I had trouble with my almonds burning before the carrots were cooked. The first time I made this, i only had the very thin-sliced almonds on hand, so I put the carrots in for 15 minutes before I added the almonds, and they still burned. The second time I had the larger, thicker pieces and they still got burned. I would suggest maybe toasting them separately or waiting til the very last minute. I cut back on the blue cheese to save a few calories.
I also tried the recipe once with balsamic vinegar, but liked it better as written. The taste is a little too sweet with the balsamic and it gives everything a brown color that is not so appetizing.

This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. I love this salad!  Even my mother in law asked for the recipe and she is one tough nut to crack!  It's so pretty and the unexpected combination is a mouthwatering combination. This is a new staple in my repertoire!

I didn't love this like I'd hoped I would.  I used feta instead of blue cheese because I don't like blue cheese but otherwise followed the recipe.  I like roasted carrots but I just didn't like the texture of the carrots with the rest of the salad.  And, I didn't care for the cider vinegar with this.  I felt like it needed a different kind of vinegar but I'm not sure what.

Love this salad!  As noted in the recipe, the key is to properly roast the carrots.  Under-roasting them makes for a soggy salad.  I like to roast the carrots and almonds separately (or at least on separate ends of the pan) as they almonds usually are done before the carrots.

This was an excellent idea. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but felt it was lacking in something. I will use this recipe again, but will tweak it I think. Really great idea though.

I only made the carrots part of this dish and it was super delicious. I didn't use any nuts and didn't need nearly as much oil to coat the carrots. After the carrots are cool I whisked together 1tbsp balsamic vinegar with 1tsb honey and tossed carrots in it. It was so much more interesting than the plain roasted carrots without too much work. Perfect!

Loved this!  Nice change for a Thanksgiving side dish.  I served this with spinach instead of arugula. The cheese and cranberries and toasted nuts were great in combination with the other ingredients.   Yummy!  Loved the gorgonzola in it.  May not have added the full amount called for...I just eye-balled it.

I must have been too busy stuffing this down my throat to review earlier. This was fantastic! My husband and daughter poo-pooed it last time based on the blue cheese, so this time I'm making it with reduced fat feta cheese instead. This may be the best salad I've ever had. Sweet, savory, with lots of different flavors and textures going on. Beautiful presentation too.

This recipe is great!  I made it exactly as written.  I like it with more arugula but I would not change anything else.  I don't normally like cooked carrots but loved this!  I will be making it often!

12-2016 update.  Originally I rated this five stars without the cheese.  Then again with it.  I prefer without but overall, I highly recommend this recipe.  It does not disappoint!  Bon apetite!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!!!  I did a few alterations. First, I cut the oil in 1/2, but possibly will even just spray next time.  I added more garlic as well, as we love the stuff!  I added 1/2 cup Feta in place of the bleu cheese.  I did not use ANY greens, but used the dish as a vegetable side to a garlic prime rib.  Accented the meal PERFECTLY!!  Will double next time as the leftovers the next day were, if possible, even better!!  One of my favorite recipes EVER!

I LOVE this recipe!!! 5 star with no adjustments, but I have made it several times now and have learned a few useful tips- 1) always make 2-4x the dressing suggested. Tossing a little w the carrots after they've cooled and then the greens separately before plating helps you use less, otherwise it falls to the bottom and you need to add more.  (I should note that I always use a platter rather than a bowl so the carrots are the star in the middle and don't mix everything together) 2) I also add extra blue cheese- I've only ever used Humbolt Fog because I love it and feel it's a great blue cheese for even the pickiest eaters. 3) Be careful with the garlic. The second time I made this salad I added too much and it ruined the flavor profile. 4) I love arugula, but the salad can be boosted with a little chopped romain mixed in as well. It adds extra crunch and helps to catch the dressing.    This salad was a huge hit every time I made it and I will continue to use this recipe several times a year.

Really great salad!  I Know it would have been good using the original, but I added A new dimension by adding roasted parsnips with the carrots and I sprinkled the salad with a little cayenne pepper. Yum!!

This was a very different, interesting recipe.  Lots of taste and texture.  I did run the carrots through the food processor with the 1 mm blade (smallest).  I only had shredded Parmesan and it needed a stronger cheese, like the blue that it called for.  Used torn up romaine lettuce as we don't care for arugula.  This makes quite a bit.   If there's only two eating it, you'll be eating it for a week.  I'll cut it in half for us next time.  Oh, and it is very attractive, too!  Thanks for sharing.

This salad was delicious, a great combination of flavors. I hate substituting on a new recipe but our store did not carry arugula so I substituted spinach and I had feta cheese that I needed to use up so substituted that also. The salad was a winner and I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I tweaked this recipe by using 1 lb of carrots, 1 lb of Brussels sprouts, only 1 T of olive oil, doubling the garlic, and halving the blue cheese. I'm a serious blue cheese lover but any more than that and it would have been completely overpowering. I also used half baby arugula and half baby spinach and replaced the vinegar with OJ.

This salad has been extremely well received.  I thought it was amazingly easy too.  I actually used the food processor to slice the carrots, which made them all fairly uniform and thin enough so they roasted up quickly and nicely.  I might try walnuts next time, but I'm not sure how well those would roast.  Great salad - served it with the Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site - delicious.

I just used this recipe for the carrots part (no salad, cranberries, etc.). Followed the recipe up until it was time to mix the carrots with the salad and blue cheese and cranberries. Turned out wonderfully as a side dish.

Carrots and arugula are in season at the same time.  I buy both at the local farmers market and roast the carrots and nuts on a cast iron griddle on the grill (I hate to turn on the oven with the a/c going).  The carrots must be browned to bring out their sweetness to best compliment the flavors of this salad.  I look forward to making this every year in late spring!  I love blue cheese and don't change a thing in the recipe!

Although I depend upon the reviews on this website, this is the first time I've felt strongly enough to add my own.  All I can say is .... YUMMY.  I served this at a small dinner party and everyone gobbled it up and asked for the recipe.  SO good.  I made it exactly as written except I used goat cheese as I wasn't sure of my guests' tastes and blue cheese is one of those things that you love or hate.  (I love it so next time will use it!)  Thank you Morgan!

Very, very good! Left out the Gorgonzola because I dont like it and didnt mix with the greens. This is a wonderful blend of sweet, savory, tangy, nutiness! Pretty much ate it all by myself in one sitting!

I am IN LOVE with this salad!!!  I made the carrots earlier in the day, refrigerated them, then mixed the salad all together and served it cold. Had to use spinach since my store was out of arugula, and I used gorgonzola since I prefer the milder flavor as opposed to blue cheese, and used dried cherries for cranberries due to one guests allergies to cranberries... Minor changes, but end result was AWESOME and guests raved about this salad... Will DEF make again, and again...

This salad is unbelievably good.  I made it exactly as written and the flavors complemented each other so well.  In addition, it is so colorful it looks pretty on the plate.  I used the whole 2 pounds of carrots for 3 people, expecting to have leftovers and only ended up with about a cup left.  Needless to say, I will be making this again and again!

I make recipes for the first time for company all the time.  There were five of us.  Not a good review for all.    Just not worth the work slicing all the carrots even though a used a mandolin.  Can't put my finger on why everyone didn't care for it--perhaps not enough in the way of spices.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Perhaps I should have spiced it up.

OMG. And I do not say that often in my reviews. I should have done 10# of roasted carrots. I roasted the carrots in my new tabletop convection oven in 2 layers until they started browning. The flavors were all so amazing together. I have to make another batch now and leave in the frig for salads. I served it with smoked brisket but I could just eat the salad for a whole meal for a week. Thanks so much for this recipe!

A W E S O M E
Went looking for a carrot recipe since I had a large bag of carrots and knew they weren't going to get used up before vacay.  
Found this and saw it had some ingredients I just love like cheese and arugula.  (I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots.)
This was great and I did take others' advice on decreasing and/or increasing some of the ingredients and roasting the almonds separately.  I also went w gorgonzola.  
I prepped the carrots first drizzling w oil and adding salt and pepper.  Threw it in the oven while I minced the garlic.  Threw the carrots back in the bowl and mixed in the garlic and back in the oven.  Carrots cooked great at 30 minutes.  
Easy to make.  Def roast almonds separately so they are perfectly roasted because you'll pick up the nutty flavor in the salad.

Fantastic!! Even the hesitant child ended up giving it a surprised thumbs up! I roasted the carrots alone, added garlic into dressing, and added nuts with cranberries and feta. It was really great! My husband could hardly stop eating it! Thanks for sharing!

Yes, this is a great recipe!  I was excited to hear that it is inspired by that carrot salad at the wonderful Farmer's Market in Woodstock, VT--we frequented it often when visiting family there in Woodstock.  I have made this several times in the last  month!  The last time I made it I  roasted asparagus with the carrots and added a just a smidgeon of roasted sesame oil just before serving.

I made this for a potluck and people loved it! I didn't use the Arugula since it wasn't served at a table. I did the carrots the night before and mixed the other ingredients in before serving the next day. I'll make it again with the Arugula. The Bleu Cheese was great - don't miss out on that flavor.

Absolutely delicious.  One of my favorite recipes. I cannot wait to make this dish again. Due to preference,  I used baby spinach and feta in place of arugula and blue cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it! I didn't have any almonds so I left that out, but still, so yummy. Even just the dressing was wonderful, very well balanced. I'll absolutely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Different but delicious.  I did not measure ingredients but was close to the amounts called for in recipe.  I did use feta cheese and spinach rather than blue cheese and arugala.  Any combination would work that one prefers - it does not take away from the original recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I'm not one for cooked carrots but this was a great salad with lots of interesting flavors and textures.  I'm thinking I'll try it with fresh spinach (versus arugula) next time.  It was also great without the arugula! Definitely a keeper!

Great, but the almonds and garlic burned badly and I had to start again. I'd recommend toasting the almonds and garlic in a pan while the carrots are baking.

LOVE this recipe. This is my “go to” when we bring salads to dinner or have guests. It’s perfect “as is” but can also be adjusted - we prefer feta cheese so usually make it with that instead of bleu and it’s still delicious!

Quite good. Nice the roasting can get done ahead of time.
We liked the unusual combinations. Used goat cheese instead. Believe the cheese is a worthy addition. Adding this recipe to my go to list.

It turned out wonderful and I was really surprised by the mix of flavors.  Used Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese and that really added to it. Toast and a half a cup of Almonds separately. Put the carrots 1 tablespoon of minced garlic 1 tablespoon of olive oil salt and pepper into a Ziploc bag he and then bake them for 400° after 30 minutes I still felt that I needed another 10

Very good! I followed the recipe closely, the only change was that I roasted the carrots at 475 so they would brown a bit better. It’s a trade off because you need to stir them every 10 minutes or so.

This salad was delicious. I made as directed but only used 1 lb of carrots. Also my local store didn’t have arugula so I used a bag of mixed greens. Yummy.

This is an extraordinary recipe! Made it twice in a week because my husband loved it so much.  The arugula is a bit dry with only the carrot mixture and can really be eaten without it.

Most of the people who tasted it said it was awful. I think it was the blue cheese that ruined the flavor since it tasted okay without it.

I loved this recipe, but then any roasted veggie is a BIG yummy for me. As is, the recipe is more of a side veggie dish with the arugala acting much like a parsley addition...and great.  As a Salad, I found it needed more Arugala.  Even with adding more Arugala, the suggested dressing amount was sufficient to dress the added greens. I toasted my almonds separately and added at the end/serving, as I wanted to retain their crunch texture. Not only is this Super tasty,  it HAS to be a really  healthful recipe... just do not tell anyone, how healthy and EZ!

I made this for a 4th of July block party and was a little disappointed. It got lots of praise from the others there, but I thought it tasted a little bit flat. I used 5 ounces of gorgonzola for 4 lbs of carrots, because that's what I had. Maybe it needed more. But thinking about it I believe I'd add a few hot pepper flakes to counteract the sweetness of carrots, dried cranberries and honey. 

Still I expect I'll make it again and just play around with it some. It's a great idea and definitely something different and pretty healthy so it's worth trying out.

Excellent dish -made it twice, and was a huge hit both times. Very easy to improvise with the recipe - Replaced the cranberries with pomegranate seeds and cheese with Parmesan once,  second time used  a mild roquefort and mixed baby leaves instead of arugula.

We loved this. Every time we've eaten it! We've tweaked it a bit now, but mostly for convenience; I broil the carrots (they cook faster that way, just make sure you're watching!), I use only about 2tblsp oil for a 5lb bag of carrots (cause a 2lb bag  is NEVER enough!), double the garlic and we rarely eat it with the  greens now (it's so good as a side!). But as written, it's delicious as well!!

I was surprised at the mix of flavors but they absolutely worked!  I deviated away from the recipe but kept the integrity (i.e., used full-size carrots, used cane syrup rather than honey, power greens rather than arugula).  My husband ate two huge servings, so this recipe will really serve about two persons.  My husband used a mandolin to slice the carrots, and they were gorgeous.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

Awesome! I love this salad because it's simple, healthy, and tastes great. I've tried this recipe with blue cheese (including Gorgonzola) and feta, and both tasted great. I plan on bringing a big bowl of this salad to a Thanksgiving potluck, but I'll probably use feta because some people are turned off by the pungent aroma/flavor of blue cheese! Thanks for sharing.

Crowd-pleaser at my house! I used spinach and bok choy instead of arugula and tossed in some walnuts in addition to the almonds. Yum!!

This recipe is one of my favorites. I've made it many times exactly according to the instructions, and it always turns out well. Not super quick to make, but still easy and tastes awesome at the end.

Excellent salad to use up some carrots from Easter. I made mine with Spinach instead of the arugula and omitted the almonds all together. I was surprised how well the oils covered the salad. No extra dressing was necessary, and I love dressing.  I think this salad would be delicious with bacon as well.

What a symphony of flavors! I made according to directions except used only enough EVO to coat the carrots/almonds/garlic; probably less than half of what's called for here. Used organic multi-colored carrots (from Trader Joe's) which made it even prettier. Might double the honey & vinegar next time so it flavors the arugula, too. But what a delicious new favorite! Will make often. Thanks for sharing!

We loved this salad! I will personally add a bit more vinegar to my  portion, but my husband and son absolutely loved it just the way it was. (I did add one thinly sliced onion to the carrots as they roasted.)My son liked it so much he wants me to send the recipe to his girlfriend so she can make it for him too!

This really is as good as everyone says here. Since it doesn't have (or need!) dressing, just make sure you don't add more arugula than the recipe calls for or it will dilute the delicious flavor.

Very good side dish. I will make again. The only changes I made were to use feta instead of blue cheese, simply because I did not have any blue on hand, and I  doubled the garlic to suit our tastes.  I will try with the blue next time, and there will be a next time.  I agree with the reviewers who liked it better without the salad greens.  I too liked it best as a side dish.  Also one reviewer suggested only roasting the carrots.  I would think that would dramatically alter the flavor as roasting the garlic mellows  it ( which is why I doubled the garlic) and roasting the nuts enhances their flavor.  Anyway, thanks for sharing this keeper.

I joined all recipes just to review this recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving, exactly as stated, (well, the only thing I changed was to put the almonds n the oven a little later than the carrots) and we barely had any leftovers! I will make this again and again, so long as I have the time to slice all the carrots. Thanks!

Delicious! We used spinach and as we prefer it to arugula and it was still delicious. We liked it so much we would have dated it even without the spinach! Definitely putting this into regular rotation.

Wow--this is a delicious recipe.  I prepared it on a very hot day and didn't want to use the oven, so I steamed the carrots and toasted the almonds in the microwave.  The garlic was tasty uncooked!

Love this recipe.  I doubled the amount of greens to make it more salad-y.  But otherwise terrific.  Colors are lovely - would be great for a holiday dinner.  And the flavor combination is really good.  This is now a regular recipe for our family!

This is delicious.  I thought the combination sounded odd but is over the top good.  I doubled it because I had carrots to use and I'm glad I did!
I am making it for Thanksgiving. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was great! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I think the blue cheese amount of 4 oz is a bit too much. Otherwise this is wonderful!

Tasty recipe! Our CSA box was full of carrots, and now I hope more will come! 
Fresh and tasty and easy to make, perfect for a picnic if you skip the greens. 
Will definitively make again.

Lovely and unusual salad. I cut the diagonally carrots about half inch thick, but thicker at the narrow ends of the carrots. I turned mid-way through roasting so the carrots carmelized on both sides. I served the carrots over the greens rather than mixing with the greens and spritzed a little more dressing over the top. The volume is decreased by roasting but you still get a generous 6 portions.

Not sure how to rate this one, as I loved it and would have given it 5 stars but my husband was not impressed at all.

Good, I was the only person in my family that ate this.  I used romaine in place of the arugula.

I did not have arugula so I did not add any green.  I did not have cranberries so I added craisins. .  Very ymmy.  My kids even liked it.

It was good, but not the best, I made it for the party and it was nice for variety. Might make it again.
