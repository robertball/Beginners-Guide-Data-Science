I was confused when I read this recipe.  All the barbeque I've eaten in eastern Carolina hasn't had butter in it, that's for sure.  I wasn't sure about the other ingredients.  Decided to take a chance on this recipe, and was disappointed with the results.  This isn't what I'm looking for.  It was edible, but didn't have the right balance of flavors, and the greasy slick the butter left on top was just plain wrong.  This may be authentic in some part of eastern Carolina, but apparently not the part I've visited.

I spent 6 months in Eastern N. Carolina 25 years ago and learned this recipe from a senior citizen.  This is the best barbacue sauce I had ever eaten.  Since then I had forgotten how to make it.  I have been looking for this recipe for over 20 years!

I am from NC and looked for a good BBQ sauce--this is it. Spicy and vinegary!  Let it sit in the fridge for 3 weeks or more for it to be good.  It's the real deal.

My entire clan hales from Eastern NC and I'm ashamed to admit how much pulled pork barbeque I've consumed.  The Eastern NC barbeque "sauce" is mostly comprised of vinegar and red pepper and it is a marinade.  It doesn't need butter, the pig supplies all the fat needed.  This is NOT the real McCoy.  If you go to the NC pork web page, you can find the real thing since pork is one of NC's biggest agricultural products.

Fabulous! I am a native North Carolinian living in frigid Minnesota.. missing this BBQ and sweet tea- that's for sure! But i am also SUPER lazy and found a sauce that is close to these ingredients- minus the brown suger at Target- Archer Farms Carolina BBQ marinade- it's good! not as good as this, but close..

This recipe leaves meat tasting exceptionally vinegarish. I've use it twice, once to try to get a sauce (more like water) and once to slow cook pork. Waste of a good cut of pork. Something is wrong with it.

I've made this recipe several times for groups of people.  It is sooo easy and good.  I win raves.  One of the few recipes I make exactly as written. But, don't forget the cole slaw for the BBQ's.

As a native of eastern NC (Mt. Olive to be exact) I have had bbq sauce all my life.  Wilburs, and Scotts out of Goldsboro, Mr. Rodney's in Mt. Olive, and a host of other places near here.  My Dad and other members of my family have cooked their own pigs and we made our own sauce.  I am 58 yrs old and have NEVER EVER heard of putting butter in this type of sauce.  We never put molasses either.  I have NO clue where this sauce came from...but definitely not from my neck of the woods!!! Oh and we never put any type of mustard or dark brown sugar either!!!  My family loves our sauce on chicken also :)~

This bears almost no resemblence to the sauce I've had living in Chapel Hill or have eaten anywhere in Eastern NC. It's like a strange hybrid of Eastern & Western sauce.

6.27.18  Cooked some chicken thighs in the Instant PotÂ® today, shredded the meat, and added this barbecue sauce.  Good, and a welcome change from tomato-based BBQ sauce for pulled chicken sandwiches.

My father's side of the family is from Fuquay, NC and I've been pit cooking pork and chicken with "white" sauce (in opposition to the Western NC's "red" sauce which adds tomato) for over 40 years now. No one from my area uses molasses or any other sweetener in our sauce, and there is no need for any butter or fat in the sauce. The meat offers plenty of fat on its own, but I wouldn't try turkey this way without injecting the meat with some fat. Even the dry mustard is unusual, although Uncle Mike uses it in his sauce. My sauce is cider vinegar, cayenne and red pepper flake, salt and a little Worchestershire because I like it. Mop it on liberally and often on side of pork or marinade / inject chicken in sauce before grilling and mop liberally over and in the bird during cooking. Cooking is done low and slow (a pig often takes more than 12 hours to cook properly).

I will give it three stars since I changed a couple of things.  I put a can of tomato sauce in.  I skipped the butter. I only used a fourth of a cup or less of cider vinegar.

I'm accustomed to tasting all sorts of cuisines.  Let me also add, I love sour foods, so with vinegar as the main ingredient, I was really excited to taste this recipe.  This is a unique and acquired taste.  Even served on bread, the sourness was overwhelming. I would not recommend it for people with a Southern-California palate.

I absolutely loved this sauce.  I know some people said it was "too watery," so I did add cornstarch to thicken it up for my pulled-pork sandwiches.  It came out the perfect consistency.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  Will absolutely make it again!  YUM!

This should be called Vinegar Sauce! Doesn't say how long to cook it- very watery. Had to cook down for a while until it was thick and useful.

The vinegar took over the whole sauce.  Won't make this one again.

This is the best! I have had nothing but compliments on it. The only thing I changed was the amount of vinegar. I cut it in half. Still the best sauce for pulled pork!

Love it. I put it in many dishes. I put it in pinto beans, burgers, even my tuna noodle dish, and many more. I do have to leave out the cayenne pepper though. I sometimes don't put in the butter either.

I've spent most of my life in eastern NC and since moving to Pittsburgh I've been looking for something to take the edge off my bbq cravings, this isn't it. Way too greasy and it doesn't have that spicy tang true ENC bbq does. Keep looking.

This is a good vinegar based recipes.  However I would omit the butter when using it with pork or beef and only add the butter when cooking chicken on the grill.

Was looking for something that tamed the strong vinegar taste of recipes. This did the trick.  Would add more pepper and cut back on the butter/molassas next time.
