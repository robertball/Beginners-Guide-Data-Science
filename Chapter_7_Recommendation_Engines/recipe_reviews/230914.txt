This is SOO good.   I think it's one of those recipes you can't possibly ruin.  I didn't have cream, so I substituted some 1% milk, mixed with coconut water and a dollop of greek yogurt. I also substituted dry ginger and dry basil for the fresh.  I'm sure it's better with the fresh ingredients, but it worked!  My husband and I both agree that it needs to be on heavy rotation in our house.

This is super easy and I adapted the ingredients to what I had on hand. I accidentally added the soy sauce to the chicken marinade ( brown sugar, ginger & soy sauce) and it still turned out great. I sautéed the chicken with onions as directed then added the cream sauce. I mixed the cornstarch with half- half cream.  Then added vegetables that I had on hand; an orange pepper, zucchini, onion, celery, broccoli and 2 diced jalapeños. I didn't have almonds so I used pine nuts.  The dish come out delicious. Served over rice. My husband loved it.

Awesome dish, I wouldn't change a thing.  Be sure to use fresh ginger and drizzle with lime.
