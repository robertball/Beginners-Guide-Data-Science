I agree, this soup is fantastic and so quick and easy. I prefer not to use pre-packaged spice mixes. The ingredients include "ethoxyquin" and other scary sounding things. I make my own seasoning mix inspired by a low carb cookbook and it is super yummy (and not processed!) 2 T chili powder, 1 1/2 T cumin, 1 1/2 T paprika, 1 t onion powder, 1 t garlic powder, 1/4 t cayenne (or more if you like it hot). Use it as you would taco seasoning mix from the store, two or three tablespoons of the mixture will flavor a pound of meat.

I have made this soup several times. This is a great recipe, but I had to have a more hearty and nutritionally balanced meal in a soup. I added black, pinto and kidney beans (I use dry beans, soaked overnight, and simmer them with the chicken, tomatoes, spices and water for an hour, but canned will work fine, too -- just be sure to drain and rinse well, then put them in the soup last ten minutes) and frozen corn in the last 15 minutes of simmering. I also boil a whole chicken with onion, salt and celery the night before, strain out the chunks, refrigerate broth, skim off fat next day, and use instead of canned broth (but breasts and canned broth works okay, too, just not as flavorful – I cut cooking time by microwaving the breasts in the canned broth instead of baking in oven, then strain broth before adding to pot). I use a large can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the homemade taco seasoning that was given in another review, and a cup of mild picante sauce. I crush Multi-Grain Toastitos and add with a dollop of fat-free sour cream and the avocado when serving. Fruit salad on lettuce leaves rounds it all out. Simply divine.

My changes make a lot more soup for larger families or gatherings, since you will have more broth if made with a whole chicken and/or add more water with the beans and corn. Add more spices proportionally, too. 

Keeps well for a week in frig. Hubby then takes it to work every day and begs for more!

Wonderful soup.  Instead of baking the chicken I boiled 3 large breasts and chopped them up and threw everything into the pot at the same time.  I added 1 can of corn, 1 can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and a can of chopped green chilies.  I omitted the water since I left the liquid in the tomatoes. The avacado really made this delicious. Thankx Rillene.

This is a pretty good recipe for Chicken Soup.  However, I have lived in Mexico for the past 18 years and there is one thing that ruins this soup for me.  Two teaspoons of cumin!!  I could accept a dash of cumin, but with 2 teaspoons of cumin, it tastes like cumin soup with chicken added.  I do not understand the idea that all Mexican food has to have cumin in it.  I made this soup and invited Mexican friends to try it.  Nobody would eat it.  Everything else (the avocado, tortilla chips, even the cheddar cheese) which are not commonly found in Mexican chicken soup would have been very acceptable, if not welcome additions.  Just NOT the cumin.

OH YA - this was the best dam soup i ever ate and i am a soup fan , never thought of cooking it from scratch but glad i did as you cant get this in a resturant - my girlfriend was amazed and i am a hero - follow directions to the letter and use mission style chips - everything blended together perfectly and as previous reviewer said i used corn bread from the local bakery
awesome - will try another soup soon but this one is a keeper and will make for friends in a few days

Ahhhhmazzzing! I made this in the crock pot. I sauted onions and celery and then added that to the crock pot. then i added everything else, including the chicken. I let the chicken and everything cook in the crockpot on low all day and it turned out awesome! I reserved some cilantro for the top, cheese and avocado! yummy for a busy college student :)

Excellent Flavor! I did make a few cooking changes, not to change flavor though. I poached the seasoned chicken and then used that broth in place of the 1 cup of water. I also used a can of diced tomatoes w/ chiles in place of 1 cup tomatoes. I also added a handful of frozen corn at the very end of cooking. For a bit of a smokey bite, I sprinkled some "Penzey's" Chipotle spice on top of soup, when ready to serve.
I used alot of suggestions from other reviews on this recipe..very helpful!
Thank you very much Rillene for a fabulous soup. Oh, by the way, this is even better the following day!.

Instead of using the tomatoes, I add a jar of white corn and black bean salsa.  I also add extra corn to the soup to give it more substance.  With the addition of the salsa, I passed on adding the fresh cilanto.  Great recipe, I just tweaked it to meet our tastes.

Excellent recipe just as it is. A squeeze of lime over the bowl when serving and it tastes just like the Sopa di Pollo at our local Mexican restaurant. Thanks so much--I've been looking for this one for a while.

This soup is excellent! I used 2 lefover broiled boneless chicken breasts, added the taco seasoning to the chicken broth and tomato and added a handful of white rice and some white beans. Hubby and I both loved it! This is a nice hearty soup that is not too spicy. I will be making this again!

This is so yummy! I added a lot more cilantro, because I love the flavor. I also used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. I used Lawrey's HOT taco seasoning. Next time I will make a double recipe becase it was even better the next day.

I had some left over Mexican chicken, so I decided to make this soup.  At first I wasn't going to put avocado in at the end like the recipe calls for, but decided to after all, boy was I glad I did, it was really good!  I even added a little red cabbage to my soup.  I also added my own Mexican seasoning instead of the pre-made  kind.  This soup is delicious. I ate 4 bowls, couldn't stop eating it! lol I love soup and I love this recipe, I will definitely make this again.  :)

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using my own taco seasoning instead of the store bought. I'm not much of an avacado fan but it's a must in this recipe. Next time I am going to double the recipe though. My hubby and grown son ate it like it was their last meal!

My extremely picky husband told me that this was in the top 5 meals I've ever made. A few changes: to cut down on the cooking time, I cut the chicken into strips and cooked in a skillet with the taco seasoning. Then I let it simmer in the soup for an hour (on accident, but it was extra tender). The last 15 minutes or so, I added a can of corn and a can of black beans (both drained) per another reviewer's suggestion. 
I served it with the hint of lime chips - amaaaazing! Don't forget the avocado - it makes all the difference.

Making again tonight - tripling the recipe and using a whole chicken and extra avocado :) Yum yum!

I have made this recipe several times. It is very good! I do not change a thing about the recipe. The only thing is I do not believe it would feed 6 people. Maybe 4 tops for a main dish.

This was so good and full of flavor!  I poached the chicken in water with a little taco seasoning and then  made some boil-in-bag rice in the same broth I cooked the chicken in. I also added garlic, the juice of a lime to the soup and used lime to garnish the soup as well.

This was EXCELLENT, my parents and 3 y.o. daughter loved it. Leftovers lasted only through the next day at lunchtime. Unfortuately, I wasn't able to get a decent avacado this time of year, so instead, I mounded some cooked white rice in the bottoms of the bowls and served the soup overtop of it. The only change I made to the recipe was to add a little cayenne pepper for some heat, also I used some pre-cooked chicken meat that I needed to use up so I just whisked the taco seasoning into the broth. Next time I make it, I am planning to sautee some garlic in with the onions and celery, and perhaps add a can of corn. Thanks for the awesome recipe Rilene!

I love this soup.  Per other reviews I use Melissa hong kong's taco seasoning, Rotel mild tomatoes, and add a little frozen corn.  I think it is the cumin that makes it so delicious.  I double the recipe so we can enjoy it for several days.  I am dieting and serve this with a little chopped avocado and skip the grated cheese and tortilla chips for a healthy, satisfying soup.

I made this for my parents and they thought it was fantastic. We all had to have two helpings of this delicious recipe. I added black beans and corn to mine and instead of baking the chicken I sauteed it in a skillet with butter and added the packaged taco seasoning. Turned  out better than I even expected. Makes for a great meal on a cold night!

This soup was absolutely delicious! I am not a soup eater generally as there are few that I find good enough to want to eat, but this was great. I followed the recipe to a T. I have to say the addition of the cilantro is a must for this recipe and is the key ingredient, along with the avocado that makes this so delicious. Will make this very often for my Mexican husband (who loved it too!).

Had a soup like this at a local Mexican restaurant and loved it.  This recipe is very similar.  I did add a little rice to it which was in the restaurant version and  makes it a little heartier.    I routinely cook whole chickens in my crockpot and debone and freeze the meat, mostly to use in soups.  I used a pack of that instread of chicken breasts.    Although better with fresh ingredients, an easy thing to do is use Ro-tel diced tomatoes with chilies and cilantro.    Everyone in the family loved this soup.

What a delicious recipe. My family absolutely loves it! For added zip, try adding one can of Rotel tomatoes in place of canned tomatoes.  Great flavor!  I serve it with Mexican cornbread.

This was ok, did reduce the cumin for personal taste. Did think it was a little bland but my wife loved it. Will make it again.

This is a very easy soup to make and soooo good.  I followed one reviewer's advice and went easy on the ground cumin.  I used all chicken broth (no water) and added corn and small pasta tubes.    This is going into my regular Sunday soup rotation.

Good recipe; however, needed some things in order to become a meal.  I cooked the chicken in a full pkg. of taco seasonings.  I added a can tomatoes with chili's vs. the can of diced tomatoes.  This gave the soup additional flavor, then added a can of tomato sauce, 2 cans of drained black beans, and 1 can of corn, drained.  I, also, eliminated the can of water and only added 2 cans of chicken broth vs. 3.  Next time I will only add 1 can of chicken broth for a thicker soup.

Made this for my family tonight.  They loved it!  I did double the recipe and added two 15 oz cans black beans, drained well, and One 15 oz can kernel corn.I did season the chicken with some taco mix and sauteed with cover on till chicken was cooked (30 minutes on low). I added the beans and corn when the chicken and tomatoes are added. I did simmer longer than 5 minutes after adding these items.  And we added a squeeze of lime when serving. We skipped the tortilla chips because we are dieting but will try them when we are not.  Healthy and delicious !

Oh my gosh!!!!  Way better than our local Mexican Restaurant!!!  I used a rotisserie chicken, added corn, used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh.  Our Mexican restaurant always serves it with a big bowl of rice, so I made my favorite which is from this site, "best Spanish rice".  It is amazing!  My husband who doesn't even eat soup, gobbled it up!!!  Don't leave out the avocado it makes the soup!!!!

Added mushrooms (at beginning with onions and celery) and a can of undrained mexican corn (at the end with the tomatoes and cilantra). Omitted the cup of water and swapped out the fresh tomatoes for a can of Rotel (green chiles one). Also used pre-made rotesserie chicken as it was easier and a little quicker. Added the chicken in 15 minutes after letting the veggies simmer. By far the best soup I've ever tasted. I will make this again several times over!

The fiance decided to cook for the first time and went with this dish. I did all his prep work (chopping and measuring) because he got a wee bit overwhelmed :)  But it came out absolutely fabulous! He took the advice of some other reviewers and added canned black beans and corn. They really helped round the soup out and make it less watery. He also added 2 cloves of garlic and 3 small serrano peppers, both finely minced, to the onion and celery step. He forgot to buy sour cream, but we'll buy some for tomorrow night, when we have the soup for leftovers.   He's so proud of himself, and I was so happy to catch a cooking break on Sunday! Soup was great, but did 4 stars because it was missing a few things we added ourselves. Still! Thanks Rillene! :)

Mmmm...Very good and definately a nice twist on reg. chicken soup. I changed the recipe a bit. I added minced garlic and quartered baby carrots. I also added 2 extra cups of chicken broth and 1 extra cup of water. With the exception of adding a bay leaf, I left the spices the same, I also added the juice of 1 lime which gave it a nice twist! Used turkey instead of chicken b/c I prefer it. Next time I will try it w/ chicken taco seasoning. Delicious! Thanks!

This was really tasty.  Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added in black beans and corn in the last 15 minutes of simmering, and used home-made chicken stock.  I made my own tortilla strips (cut corn tortillas and sprayed with olive oil, then baked at 425 for 12 minutes).  Excellent.  Maybe next time I'll add in some jalapenos.

Fantastic!  Followed all the directions using a can of rotel with green chilies for diced tomatoes and we LOVED it. I enjoy soupa de pollo at my favorite mex restaurant and this is similar but only better!  Will be a household fave from now on.

Yummy.  I added a can of black beans and some rice to make it more substantial for the kiddos.  I had an OOPS MOMENT where I used cinnamon instead of cumin.  Ack!  Got both teaspoons in before I realized something was up.  I scraped some out and still went ahead with the cumin, and you know what?… it was actually good.  Discovered a new flavor combination - tasted Caribbean or something.  Maybe I'll add a teaspoon of Cinnamon on purpose next time.

Delicious!  I added to the recipe, just what I like to do.  I added some frozen corn and a can of black beans and diced carrots.  I added diced boneless skinless chicken breast  to the soup raw let it come to a boil and simmer  about 45 minutes at the very end like I usually do when making soups.  Served it with shredded cheddar, sour cream and diced jarred jalapeno.  Also, tortilla chips for dipping.  It reminds me of fajitas.  I did not use packaged taco seasoning but just added cumin, paprika, onion powder, chilli powder and diced garlic to taste.  My whole family loved it!  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this!  Made my own broth with chicken thighs.  Layered the cheese and chips by putting 1 ladle of soup then the chips and cheese, then one more ladle of soup.  Also used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.

Perfect for dinner on a cold, windy night.  I doubled the recipe so I could leftovers and it turned out great.  I added diced white potato and a can of whole kernel corn into the soup to make it a little more hearty.  Instead of baking the chicken breast, I boiled a whole chicken in a separate pot, then shredded the breast meat and added it to the soup.  I also cut off the leg quarters and let it simmer in the soup to cook through.  We topped off the soup with some avocado and cilantro and had it with white rice.  Bought cheese, but forgot to use it.  Still turned out very good.  Will use the cheese with the leftovers tonight.

Made this soup last night.  Nothing left!  This is probably one of the best soups I've made.  I did make a couple of changes based on others suggestions.  I added garlic to the celery and onions when they were sauteing.  Then I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis instead of the diced tomatoes.  Decided not to put cheese in at the end because the tortilla chips and avocado was plenty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this again soon!

This was soooo good and very easy to make.  I will however do what some other reviewers said and partially cook the bacon first.  The bottom of the bacon on the chicken did not get crisp.  Overall, fantasic receipe!!

AWESOME!!!! I put corn it, kept out celery, and made sure I sauted lots of garlic and onions first before adding the UNCOOKED chicken to keep all the flavor in ----also, use Penzy's Chicken taco spice, yummy. GREAT with cheddar and sour cream.

I loved this soup!  Extra cilantro was added (personal preference) and, rather than add regular tomatoes, I added a can of original Rotel to the mix.  It increased the heat index a little, but it was REEEEALLLYY good!!!  Added avocado (a must!), cheese, and some crushed chips as directed.  It was perfect for our Christmas eve get-together!

The soup came out wonderful!!  I adjusted the recipe a bit.  I competely coated the chicken breasts with chicken taco seasoning and baked than cooled.  I shredded the seasoned chicken and added to the simmering broth.  I added a handful of rice to the broth as well and used habenero chilis instead of celery.  I also added fresh cilantro to taste (more than what the recipe called for.)  I used canned diced tomatoes with the juice instead of fresh.  I added fresh avocado and tortilla strips when I served the soup and instead of chedder cheese...try Cacique Ranchera Mexican cheese.  MMMMMMM!!  My boyfriend and I spent 3 days eating up the soup - it was great!!  -

Love this recipe!  I had searched and searched for a recipe to duplicate our favorite Mexican restaurant's soup and this is pretty darn close!  We have made a few changes over time.... add in a handfull of uncooked rice with the spices and also pour in about a half-can of beer with the chicken broth.  Adds some really good flavor!  We love it!

This was a perfect chicken soup for my husband and I because we BOTH have a bad cold and we could actually TASTE it!!!  A couple of changes I made:  I added one can of drained corn and I sliced up 1/2 of a jalapeno.  I also used twice as much cilantro.  I added all of these with the chicken and other ingredients during the last 5 minutes, which made the jalapeno fresh tasting instead of being overcooked.  Don't worry, it really wasn't that spicy.  Try it, you'll like it!!!!!

This is a great soup and totally satisfied a Mexican food craving!  I halved the recipe and served it with a corn bread recipe from this site.  I poached the chicken and used the cumin with some added chili pepper as I didn't have the taco seasoning.  I also used canned diced tomatoes as someone else suggested (tomato and spicy red pepper)and this added some nice flavour.  Thanks for the recipe!

We were in Los Cabos in October 2004 and I had Mexican soup that I went crazy for!  Here it is!  I can't believe it tastes exactly the same.  The only difference (visual) was the avocado - I mash it and stir it into the soup - it gives it a green colour and a creamier texture.  Thanks so much for this recipe - my family and I love it.

So very very good! I ate it without avacado but can see why its a must. I put a load of cheese on top and ate it up but wish i had avacado on hand. Will get it at store today have left overs tomorrow with it with a little cheese a teaspoon of sourcream and a half dozen sliced olives. Sure to be a treat!

Very good.  I used leftover chicken, tomatoes with chilies and added a can of black beans and corn.  I did top with avocado but didn't really think it added anything.  I will make again.  Good and easy.

This soup is good that my 7yo daughter went back for seconds, which is almost unheard of! I did do a couple of things differently, though I doubt they made much difference. First, I poached the breasts in the pot (using the 1c water) then threw the celery and onion in when they were done. Pulled the breasts and shredded them after getting everything else in the pot. Used only 1/2 tsp cumin and instead of measuring chopped tomato diced one large beefsteak. Absolutely wonderful! DO NOT SKIP THE TOPPINGS, as they are integral to the soup. Even just a small amount makes all the difference.

Delicious! I have made this 3 times and My daughter loved it so much tonight she asked me to make it again tomorrow (since there were no leftovers!) 
Alterations: I used a whole chicken, boiled it in 2cups of water, then threw everything in the crockpot. I also added frozen corn and half can of black beans and some extra cilantro.

Made it per the recipe just added black beans, hominy and corn at the end.

This recipe is even great vegetarian style. Instead of tomatoes I used a can of diced green chilies and used my own seasonings instead of taco seasoning. Easy and delicious!

I agree with one with one of the reviews sauté veggies than throw the rest in the pot and simmer for few hours . Cut the chicken in to 1 to 2 inch chunks and while your cooking stir occasionally . They will eventually fall apart and shred by them selfs .I would also let this smear about 2 hours no taco seasoning no big deal I had perfect pinch Cajun seasoning on hand worked out perfect. Yes if u have rice on hand ad to bowl poor soup over and enjoy .Family loved it daughter went back for seconds.

This is a good start but like most reviewers (not all) I changed it a fair bit.  I seared the chicken in the taco seasoning first, and then let it simmer in the broth for a few hours.  Added black beans and corn just before serving.  Also used the taco seasoning recipe from this site.  Delish.  Served it for girls night out and everyone wanted the recipe!!

Excellent. We added a can of McLintock's beans (Central California Coast piquito beans); a can of corn, and a chopped anaheim chile 10 minutes before completion, and it was top notch. Will become a staple in this kitchen.

This was a very easy and hearty soup to make. I added canned corn and black beans and used seasoned tortilla strips (found in the salad dressing aisle) to give it a little more spice. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to save time, but next time I will make my own chicken to help enhance the broth. It was very good and my husband and his friend loved it. I served it with cornbread and didn't have any leftovers! Great recipe...thank you!

This was tastier than I expected. Even my kids loved it! Because I had some extra stuff on hand, I added carrots, garlic, Mexican oregano, and about 4 oz of rotini pasta. I'm sure it would have been just as good without the extras, though.

Loved this!  Used some of costco's rotisserie chicken, homemade taco seasoning using previous poster's suggestion, and it came out great.  The avocado on top was different and I liked it!!  Didn't have tortilla chips...but did have a dallop of plain yogurt that cooled the heat of the taco seasoning perfectly.  Excellent soup!

Sauteed vegetables - added 2 cloves garlic. Boiled chicken breasts in stock, sauteed vegetables and 1/2 of recipe for homemade taco seasoning added by other reviewer then shredded chicken. Added corn, black beans and 3 handfuls of cubed cheddar cheese last 10 minutes of cooking. Excellent! Easy to make and everyone loved it!

This was a tasty and healthy soup.  I also added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and a can of stewed tomatoes.  Turned out great!

I loved this soup. Based on other reviews, I made a few adjustments. I added chopped carrots, and used the Taco Seasoning 1 recipe from this site.  I also added 1 cup of spicy salsa because I didn't have a tomatoe.  I threw it all in the pot (no sauteing)and let it simmer for almost 2 hrs.   I will consider adding beans or rice next time, for a heartier soup.  It also tasted better as leftovers (which I thought wasn't possible). Thanks for a great, super easy recipe!

with a couple of minor changes this is my favorite soup.  I didn't use the taco seasoning powder, but added 1/2 can mild Rotel, and added no celery.  We also just eat ours without the avocado and cheese. It's really good stuff!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I have been on the hunt for a recipe similar to my favorite Mexican restaurants chicken tortilla soup and I finally found it!  I did substitute diced carrots for the celery, but that is the only change I made.  Both of my kids (one of them is extremely picky) ate 2 bowls!  This is a recipe I will be making again and again!

We went to our Mexican Rest last night and my husband had chicken soup.  It was awesome!  My husband wanted some more today and I found this recipe. It is as great as the restaurant's.  I follow others advice and poached the chicken, picked apart. I added some Smoked Chipotle Salsa and it gave it a smoky flavor.  It was so good!  This is the soup my husband wants from now on. Thanks for the recipe!!

I love this recipe!  I used leftover grilled chicken and sauted with onions and celery with a clove of garlic.  Also, added brown rice, rotel tomatoes (orginal-adds exta spice),black beans and corn.

Delicious and easy! Made it this afternoon in no time, used leftover shredded chicken.
Since I had no tomatoes,I added about a half cup of salsa and some diced chile peppers as well. Perfect with cheddar cheese, tortilla chips and a dollop of Mexican style sour cream. Will definitely make again.

I was inspired to make this soup after eating chicken soup and shrimp quesadillas at a local Mexican rstaurant.  Like my soup at the restaurant, I added 2 1/2 cups of cooked rice before serving. I served this with a Tex-Mex layered salad and shrimp Quesadillas with a smokey guacomole for a Mexican feast.  The family loved everything.  Thanks for this soup recipe.

I added 2tbsp of sweet basil and subbed the 1 cup of diced tomatoes with 1 can of diced tomatoes with diced green chilis. I also used Lawry's Season salt instead of taco seasoning mix. This was to die for. My 3 kids loved which that is amazing itself. We ate the entire pot. AMAZING!!!!!

This was pretty good. I added a large clove of garlic and a fresh diced jalapeno. I also used a whole can of diced tomatoes. I ended up adding the whole rest of the taco seasoning packet as it wasn't spicy enough for us. I served it with shredded white cheddar cheese and crushed corn tortilla chips--the chips really make a big difference, and next time I might try chopping up some corn tortillas and letting them dissolve in the soup, or maybe adding some corn? I also might serve it with white rice next time or cornbread. It was a good soup, but something was "missing."

My family loved this soup.  We are soup lovers and are always for new ones to try out . . . this one will be made over and over again.  Adding the avocado was pure genius.  The ingredient that we added to this soup is a squeeze of lime once we were ready to eat.  The flavor was incredible.  I really recommend this recipe!

This is our family's favorite soup. I add a little more cumin and taco seasoning mix than what is called for. I also stir in a little cheddar cheese before it is served just to thicken it up a little. You MUST have it with avocados. Great recipe!

YUM!  I had a recipe similar to this, Sopa de tortilla, and I lost it, so I was glad to see this version.  I made my own broth, with left over chicken roasters, so I merely added the taco season to the broth.  I wasn't big on the avocado at the end (and I love avocado's) but the cheese & crushed chips are a MUST!!  I also subbed green chiles for the celery, and next time I will add fresh jalapeno's.  Great soup and thanks for the recipe Rillene.

Yum!!!  My husband loves this soup.  I topped it with Guacomole and Cheese.
I used a leftover chicken that I had boiled for a few hours.  I only added one can of chicken broth and no taco seasoning, only my own seasonings.
Excellent recipe!!

I'm not really a soup person, but with the chips and cornbread solidifying this recipe, I thought it ended up pretty good.  My husband thought it was great as well, and the leftovers taste as good as the original.  Enjoy.

I really liked this recipie, I did switch some things up... I bought a whole rotissorie chicken (hot wing flavor, from King Soopers) and let that simmer w/ veg. in the broth for about 1/2 hr, 45 min... Skipped taco seasoning since the chix was already spicy then drained the solids from the broth, deboned the chix and ended up with the best chix soup for a cold I have ever had... since I was sick and just wanted some spicy broth I skipped the tomatos, cilantro (not a big fan anyhow), cheese and chips but next time I will for sure add them in.

This was great!!!! Soooo easy! I added mushrooms, corn, and used the mexican style diced tomatoes in a can. Other than that nothing else was added. My husband isint a soup lover, and he couldnt get enough. I'll for sure be doing this one again.

This recipe was good. I made it for a sick husband. I think it lacked some salt but it was probably because I used low sodium chicken broth.

Made it vegan by substituting diced fried tofu (extra firm).  Also used garbanzo beans instead of ranch beans for texture.

Omg! Made exactly as is. So flavorful, and then it only gets better after adding the toppings! I used a cooked rotisserie chicken to save a little time. Start to finish it only took 30 minutes and it only dirties one pot. Leftovers the next day are delicious.

I can't cook to save my life. I found this recipe because I'm TRYING to incorporate avocados into my life. Followed the recipe minus onions and doubled celery to make up for it. I thought I messed up because mine was looking more red, and like a slurry. I think it's a difference in taco seasonings. Anyhoo, served it up, told my 17 year old I was excited because it looked pretty good. He said it IS pretty good. I happen to agree! Adding it to my staple list. (He's gotten 3 bowls now... and asked where I got the recipe!)

Tasted great. I followed the recipe as is. I used Old El Paso taco seasoning mix and found it to be lacking in salt. I ended up added a tsp of salt because of that.

Tasty, but too salty. Next time, I'll use some Masa mixed with water to give the corny taste without the salty chips. Thanks for an easy recipe!

I made this soup and it was very good. I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews. I added two cans of black beans, a can of kidney beans, and 1 cup of frozen corn. I substituted a can of Rotes for the diced tomatoes and reduced the cumin to 1 tsp. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro, diced avocado, and crushed tortilla chips on top. I have been using another recipe for this soup for a long time, but my entire family preferred this version. Thanks for posting!

I made this last night with a few slight changes. It was delicious. I boiled 3 large chicken breasts,  then shredded the chicken. I lightly seasoned the chicken with some of the taco seasoning. I added 2 tbs of taco seasoning to the chicken broth. When I tasted the broth after 20 minutes, it was bland, so I added a little more seasoning and a few pinches of salt. I also added a small can of diced green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes with the juice. I omitted the cup of water that the recipe calls for because of the water in the diced tomatoe can. I also boiled fresh corn in another pot and added it to the soup when I put the chicken in. Next time I will also add potatoes. I toppped it with a mixture of cheddar and jack cheese. Tasty!!

Bland.  The flavors were delicious, but I had to add some red pepper flakes to mine to enjoy it.  It was a little bland.  I will definitely make it again with red pepper flakes before simmering.

I tweaked the recipe and it turned out pretty good:  Used leftover chicken cubed, some chopped fresh cilantro, 1 tablespoon fajita seasoning, 1 teaspoon each of black pepper and salt, 1 can yellow hominy, 1 can white beans, 1 can diced tomatoes with jalapenos, 1 box of Kroger chicken broth, 2 cups of plain yellow crushed Kroger tortilla chips, 1 1/2 cups of chopped celery, and 4 chopped sections off a bulb of garlic. Combined and brought it to a boil and then let simmer on low heat for a couple hours.  With the exception of the broth; all cans are 16 oz. I also added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the broth. You'll need to stir often to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Enjoy!

I do agree about leaving the cumin out. It tastes much better without it. I diced the meat and threw it in the pot along with onion to brown both.  I added my own spices as the packaged taco mix has too many chemicals that do not belong in the body. I also used fresh tomatoes and chilies instead of the can rotel. It too has unwanted chemicals (and fresh is always healthier). I added cilantro to the finished soup once it was placed in the bowl along with the avocado and cheese. This soup is easy and amazing!

My husband wants me to make a double batch every weekend so we can eat it everyday.  We absolutely LOVED it!  I did add a couple sliced jalapenos to the onions and celery when I fried them up and also a can of rinsed and drained white hominy but even without those additions it would've been fantastic.  Oh yeah, I used low sodium broth and my own homemade taco seasoning but that probably doesn't change the flavor that much.  Also smooshed up the tomatoes since I don't like chunky tomatoes in my food, but that's just me :)  Would HIGHLY recommend!

I started following this recipe and then as I read the reviews began to tweak it as I went. I left out the celery, just didn't seem to mix with the other ingredients. Also left out the cumin.  I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes with green chile in them. I added a jalapeno, black beans and pinto beans (rinse and drained), can of corn (drained), 2 cups salsa, can of tomato soup and water and then added hot chicken sausage. I was delicious!!!!

I love this recipe. It was a bit too thin so I added a can of corn, half a can of chili beans, a can of green enchilada sauce, and 1/4 cup of rice. It was five stars after my add-ins.

This was great!  I used chicken breast tenders, but I didn't bake them, I broiled them, and then shredded it.  I added extra celery, cilantro, and onion (because I really like them), and bought extra avocados.  You have to have the avocado!  I didn't have any taco seasoning, but I did have Tinga seasoning.  It's in the same section as the taco mix, but it's for chicken.  It has a smokey, chipotle like flavor.  Very good.  The only thing I would change is using reduced sodium chicken broth.  It was a bit too salty for my taste, but had no complaints for the bf.  I'll be making this again!  Yummmm!!!!!

Delicious! This is easily my new favorite soup! The cilantro and avocado make it zesty and refreshing. The only thing I did differently was I used bouillon cubes instead of broth and I added a can of black beans, I also added the cooked chicken directly to the sautéed onions and celery and added the taco mix at this point instead of while the chicken was baking. Don't know if it made any difference or not but this seem to make more sense to me to really get the flavor into the chicken. It was so good I almost felt like eating for breakfast this morning!  Can't wait for lunch!

It's a keeper. Used the broth from 2 boiled bone-in chicken breasts instead, otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Better make a double batch of this, it was gone in one sitting of 5.
Who knew, but avocados are a must.

I used this recipe as a guide and changed it a little to meet my own tastes. My husband and I loved it, plus we have plenty of left overs for lunches!. Thank you for making a recipe that isn't just cans of stuff put into the same pot.

This was not only super yummy but it was very quick to make, I added some corn to it and it turned out great. My kids ate it all up. I will be making this again.

I'm making this a second time right now.  I chose the recipe initially because it sounded good, even though I was looking for something different.  I ended up loving it and forgetting what I was looking for in the first place.  I even messed up the ingredients the first time I made it, and I still loved it.  I use the home blend another reviewer suggested instead of the taco seasoning mix, and the avocado really makes the soup.  This is now on my list of Recipes I'll Probably Make Forever.

This recipe is yummy! I tweaked it and added Mexican rice, an extra can of chicken broth, small can of diced chilis, corn, and half a can of jalepenos and this really was the kicker if you want it spicy. This was better than the chicken soup we get from our authentic Mexican restaurant. Sooooo good!

Very very good with just a few changes.  I was all  out of chicken broth so just used 6cups water and about 4-5T beef broth.  Also added some chopped green, red and yellow pepper and a can of pork and beans.  Deeeeelicious!!!

The whole family loved it! I did have to add some more seasonings. I put Ms. Dash in everything, so maybe it was just me.

My family really liked this one, even my sometimes picky two year old!  I did make a few changes, used 1 jar black bean and corn salsa (instead of diced tomatoes), left out the cilantro and added a 3/4 can of green chiles.  It's a keeper!

Wow, what a great way to use up leftover chicken meat the night after roasting a chicken. Although I loved this recipe, I think it could benefit from double the taco seasoning and 1/2 cup of frozen corn.

Good stuff. The only changes I made were to use pre-cooked chicken from a pouch, and I also added a Knorr chipotle bouillon cube. If I were to make it again, I would probably add some corn or pinto beans. Thanks, Rillene!

Wow good soup.  I did not have cilantro so next time I make it I will try with cilantro.  I also did not have avocado at home and in a rush to get supper on, I forgot the chips.  I thought the soup was great anyway and I saved on calories.
