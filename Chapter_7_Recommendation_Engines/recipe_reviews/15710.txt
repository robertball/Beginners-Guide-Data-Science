I am giving this four stars because it needs just a bit of tweaking. I have made this recipe several times, ALWAYS with a request for the recipe. Having said that, I do have some changes to make this recipe a definite winner!  First, use brown sugar. I have tried it with both types of sugar, and white not only tastes different, but the end product doesn't even LOOK appetizing.  I use normal saltines, not anything fancy. Do not overcook your sugar/butter, it WILL burn.  3 minutes is plenty. Do not overcook in the oven...5 minutes is just fine.  I have tried different flavored chips (Reese's, milk chocolate, etc) as well, and have learned to stick with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Just sprinkle onto the hot crackers after removing from the oven, and let them sit for a couple of minutes....they will melt enough to spread over entire pan of crackers from corner to corner. Here is a trick of mine that works for an easier, prettier finished product: Once they have cooled slightly in the pan, score slightly with a knife right down the dotted lines of the cracker edges to make squares.  Once they are cooled completely, use the scored lines to cut into neat squares! I have never failed with these, even when they weren't as "pretty" as I'd like...they still taste wonderful!

I highly recommend making the toffee layer with light brown sugar.  It truly gives the candy a Skor taste.  The first time I made this tasty treat, it didn't turn out quite so tasty.  I had used white granulated sugar and followed the recipe exactly.  The consistency of the toffee seemed odd even after 5 minutes.  I decided not to rate the recipe based on that experience, since I'm sure I was largely at fault.  I saw a recommendation for brown sugar and decided to try it out.  The end result was absolute perfection.  Make sure that you use the salted saltines.  The saltiness helps to balance the sweetness of the toffee.  I only used one cup of chocolate chips and it was enough for me.  I prefer more toffee anyway.  I also used crushed, toasted almonds.  One very important thing...make sure to lay wax paper under the crackers.  The toffee soaks through and was a pain to wash.  Let the candy sit for about 10 minutes on the counter, then slide it into the freezer for about 20-30 minutes.  Pick the candy up by the wax paper and break away pieces.  Store the candy in the fridge or place a few pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes for extra crunchiness.  Yum!

I tried this, but it wasn't the same as the recipes using brown sugar. Try this with 1 c firmly packed light brown sugar instead if the white, and you'll be amazed at how good this is!

I have been making this for about 30 yrs now..we never knew the name of it originally so we called it " I can't Believe it's already Ready Candy". It is excellent made w/ the white sugar ( tho' many seem to prefer brown who rated this). MY RECIPE of it directs you w/ specific times for EVERYTHING! You LINE a broiler pan w/ foil and arrange your crackers ( my recipe called for unsalted saltines). Melt butter  and sugar and boil for " 3 minutes". Pour over saltines and bake at 400 degrees for " 5 minutes" ..Immediately sprinkle the choc chips over this evenly..pop back in oven for  2 min or less. This spreads the chocolate very easily over entire top of candy. . Sprinkle your choice nuts on top. FREEZE.. ( have to FREEZE them solid)..then break into pcs and store in airtight containers. The odd shapes they come out when broken up make them even more interesting. I always make these for Christmas baskets w/ a copy of the recipe attached. EVERYONE loves them. Oh ...and when you take them out of freezer.. lift foil sheet out.. invert and peel candy off foil.  Put pan away.. hey i'ts clean !

My roommates and I used to make this all the time, but when I moved I never got the recipe!! I was so glad to have finally found it!!  I use 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the white. I prefer using milk chocolate chips, but you have to melt them before putting them on the crackers.  Also, it's really good too if you just skip the chocolate and press chopped almonds into it.  It's always good, no matter what you do with it!!!

I have been making this recipe for years, and was so happy to see it has made its way to this website! Every time I make it, it vanishes. I always include these in a basket I make for my husbands office every Christmas, and they request it again every year! BTW - You do have to boil the butter/sugar mixture well, otherwise the sugar doesn't melt and it has a grainy texture!

Make sure you grease the pan before you start.  The stuff we could get out of the pan was TERRIFIC and the rest we needed a jackhammer to get out of the pan.

Great recipe! All of my Christmas guests enjoyed this and some went home with the recipe. They couldn't believe it was made with soda crackers! This is easier than my other almond crunch-type candy recipes. Its a keeper! Thanks for sharing,Debbie.

I have made this using one 12 ounce bag of peanut butter chips and one 12 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips OR use white chocolate chips and PB chips OR Mint chips and Semi sweet chips, use butterscotch chips, the combos are endless. ALSO, as they melt on the hot crackers start spreading with a spatula, mixing it all together and to the edges THEN sprinkle with whatever....Always a hit with EVERYONE

I've made this in the past with white sugar but opted to try it with brown, as suggested by another post- much better!  I also use the full cup of sugar, melt with the butter and boil for exactly 3 mins.  Pour over the Saltines and pop in the oven.  CAUTION: Don't let the toffee mixture sit on the crackers before popping in the oven- this will create a soft candy versus a crunchy candy:)  I've sprinkled the final product with Heath bits but my all time favorite is chopped, toasted pecans:)

I tried this last night because it sounded easy to make and I had all ingredients that I needed in my pantry and fridge. My husband and I thought these were good, but my kids thought they were wonderful. Because my kids loved them, and because they were very simple to make I'm giving this 5 stars. If it was at all difficult I would've given only 4. It is super easy, though, and has an interesting taste, kind of sweet/salty/buttery. (I did make a few changes. I added a bit of vanilla to the sugar, omitted the nuts because some of my kids don't care for nuts, and I used margarine instead of butter because my husband has allergies to milk.)

I have this as a passover recipe. We call it chocolate covered matzo. everything is the same only using matzo as the "cracker" Definately use brown sugar, and if you like a more molassas taste, go with dark brown sugar instead of light. I generally use the light brown sugar with semi sweet chocolate chips. I get requests all the time for this recipe, yummy stuff.

OMG! This was so good! I didn't know what to expect, never hearing of or experiencing this type of recipe. I did substitute dark brown sugar for the white and I added coconut to the top as I was giving this to a couple of old people with no teeth! Thanks for a great recipe!

Help! I've had this before and it's wonderful, but personally, have botched this twice! I'm using a good-quality pan on elec. stove. Sugar/butter ends up grainy/thick. Need a more tangible measure of "done" than XX minutes. Can you help?
Also, by way of tips, works easier in a greased jellyroll pan, no shifting crackers!

So easy and delicious! Be careful and watch the butter/sugar as it boils. I lined the pan with foil and buttered the foil. It only needed about 1 hour of refrigeration. It broke apart easily.

This is an excellent recipe, however, you absolutely HAVE TO spray the cookie sheet first.  I managed to get about 1/2 of the candy off the sheet in decent shape.  So, be sure to spray the pan first!!

So easy! I didn't have brown sugar so I added molasses to granulated sugar (1/8C to 1C sugar). I used semi sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and toffee bits.

I don't know what I did wrong!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers who raved about this.  I lined a cookie sheet with tin foil and sprayed with non stick spray.  I used brown sugar instead of white, I cooked until it was foamy.  I melted the choc chips in the microwave.  When I peeked at this after 4 minutes, the caramel was bubbling over the sides of the pan and spilling in my oven.  The crackers slid around in the overflowing toffee.  The end result tasted good but it was definitely crackers with toffee & chocolate on it.  Definitely not something that presents lovely enough to give as a gift at Christmas.

The taste is really a five but the recipe got a 4 since it isn't very specific for those who haven't made this before; like me.
I can't believe this would ever not taste good! It has a wonderful toffee flavor and crunchy texture. Specifically, this is how it went for me.
I mixed my white sugar with some light brown sugar.
I lightly oiled my foil first and used club crackres instead of saltines. The club crackers baked light and crisp.
I also melted the chocolate chips first in the microwave then spread it on so it would look like a candy bar after it cooled.
I did make sure that the butter and sugar lightly boiled to where it foamed while I whisked. I think if I had merely stirred it I would have gotten a granular texture.
While baking it continues to bubble. I had to be patient and wait for the browning edges. Which took more than 5 minutes.
This stuff came out great and is so inexpensive!

This is easy to make and easy on the budget.  Makes a great  food  gift for the holidays.

Like other reviewers I use 1 cup brown sugar rather than the white sugar.  Thanks for the hint about spraying the foil with cooking spray.  Makes removal of the "candy" after refrigeration so easy.    Taste like a million $$$$.

Best candy recipe I've ever tried!  Very easy to put together.  Used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar and almonds in place of walnuts.  Reminds me of a heath or skor bar.  Out of this world.

This is such yummy stuff! I substituted brown sugar for white and used chopped almonds instead of walnuts, and the recipe was fantastic! Not only did it taste great, it was SO easy to make! Thanks so much!

Very simple to make and had all the ingredients on hand.  I substituted almonds for walnuts.  Everyone loved it and thought it tasted like a "Heath" bar or "Skor" candy bar! I'll definately be making this one again. Thanks!

I am constantly amazed at the reaction I get whenever I make this candy - EVERYONE loves it! It is so fun to see the reactions from people when they realize it is made from regular saltine crackers.  It is quick, it is easy, and you will be a rock star.  I make it exactly as written.

My sister makes his candy alot, her family really enjoys it.  Tastes much like the "Almond Roca" we grew up eating.  As one reviewer noted she lined the cookie sheet, which is what I did.  Can't imagine cleaning that pan afterwards. Folded the foil just to fit the crackers which kept the sugar mixture right on the crackers, less run off. My crackers were floating in the sugar mixture We liked the milk chocolate chips better than the bittersweet. Again, as one reviewer noted, I had to put the pan back in the oven to melt the chocolate chips, then spread them somewhat evenly over the candy. Much easier and cleaner, for your hand, to break up if you put in freezer for abut 30 minutes

Very easy and good. I made two batches of this in one day. I did use 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the white sugar. Bake at 350 for 5 mins. It's wise to line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray foil with non-stick spray. Pop the finished product into freezer on cookie sheet for 30 mins or so before breaking into pieces.

Everyone loved this dessert!  It's really easy and really unique.  I used half the butter, brown sugar instead of white, and followed the directions exactly with great results. These taste best from the fridge.

I love this recipe! After reading other reviews, I decided to use 1 cup brown sugar, chopped candy melts's (it's what I had) and chopped peanuts. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed the foil with non-stick spray. Great and will make it again!

I didn't have saltine crackers so I used Graham crackers and boy was that yummy. Like toffee.  Also for ease in removal from pan, I lined the cooky sheet with foil and it can be lifted out to cool and break into separate sections.

Great easy recipe! And if you think saltines are good try it with club crackers ( like keeblers club)-- they have a slightly sweet buttery taste that is awesome for this recipe -- sometimes even leave off the chocolate to enjoy a "lighter" sweet/salty taste-

I made these today and used 1/4 cup castor sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, graham crackers and a cup of ground walnuts. I sprayed a half sheet pan and used a silpat. I spread the choc chips but next time I wll melt them. Scored them while they were hot.  One word - YUMMY!!! another two words MOLTEN LAVA!!! so be careful when you are working with this. I much prefer the brown sugar and graham cracker recipe to the saltines. Another hint - melt the sugar and butter together on the lowest heat.  When they are melted turn the heat to medium and watch the pot so you don't boil over. I cooked the sugar and butter for 4 minutes when it started to boil and for the last two minutes I lowered the heat to med low.  Don't take your eyes off of it.

After checking the reviews, I substituted brown sugar for the white and toasted coconut for the nuts (allergy).  I also prefer to melt the chocolate chips in the microwave.  Using parchment paper to line the cookie sheet works perfectly ... catches the "drips" and the cracker candy easily peels off.  Nice, nice, nice.  This time, I had no saltines so used honey graham crackers.  Didn't have enough of any one kind of chocolate chip so used up all the leftovers ... some milk chocolate, some white chocolate, and some chocolate mint. Turned out delicious!!!  Thanks, Debbie, for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This was a pretty nice recipe. I've made a couple of similar recipes in the past, but I can't remember how this compares. I made it exactly as written, and took the results to a picnic, where most of it disappeared, and I received praise from several people that tried it. The little bit that was left, I had myself, and thought it was pretty good. Not awesome, but a quick and easy candy treat. Plus people are often surprised by the "secret ingredient" of saltines. Worth recommending.

I have been making this candy for about 25 years.
I use brown sugar, saltine crackers, and I use margarine.(not butter) and it turns out great. 
  I line the cookie sheet with foil, and spray with cooking spray. It is a really fun to watch the crackers "bounce around" on the cookie sheet while they are baking.
  This is a great recipe, and with ingredients that people usually have on hand.

i made this with my little girl and used the last of the almond bark i had melted for dipping pretzels. these were good. i think the almond bark worked as well as chocolate chips do. my husband had managed to resist every kind of candy i made except this one. he kept picking at the little bits that broke off when i broke it into pieces. mine came out a little greasy. since its the first time ive made this im assuming its my error and not the recipes.

I have made this candy for years and I use light brown sugar.  The recipe is called Soda Cracker Candy. I clipped it out of a newspaper some 20 yrs. or more ago and it was put in by an elderly lady who said she did not want the recipe to die with her so she sent it into the newspaper to be printed. Have loved it ever since.

tastes great, but do not try to do with graham crackers...it just didn't do as well as saltines, even with adding just a little more salt in the sugar mixture. I did the whole boil for 3 minutes (soft boil stage) and I found my chocolate layer was coming away from the crackers - all problems I did not have with the saltines! If anyone has an explanation, please let me know!

Like many others have commented I use brown sugar. Make sure you use real butter not margarine. I use a jelly roll pan lined with foil. It holds exactly one sleeve of saltines. I sprinkle half with chopped pecans on top of the chocolate.

This is deliciously WOW!  I'm having a hard time keeping away from it.  We made it with the Kebbler crackers, brown sugar and vinilla.  Used release foil and had no trouble at all with sticking.We cut it up with a pizza cutter (the wheel type).  We did use walnuts, should have chopped them a little finer, maybe they would have stuck better.  Next tine for varity we'll use either graham crackers or Ritz. Thankyou VEREY much for the recipe.  One thing though my waist line may suffer.

This stuff was awesome!  So fast and easy to make.  Used 1 cup of light brown sugar instead of the white and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet as suggested and it turned out perfect.  I truly cannot stop eating it.  Makes quite a bit too.

This is a old-time Passover candy recipe - but instead of saltines, you use matzah. Use only brown sugar, put slivered almonds and chopped pecans in the butter/sugar mix - pour over crackers/matzah. Put in an 350 F oven for appx. 7 minutes. Sprinkle semi-sweet chocolate chips over the top. As the chips melt, spread with a knife. BTW, spray the rimmed cookie sheet with no-stick prior to laying out the crackers/matzah. Let cool in the pan (no need to freeze!). Break into small pieces to serve. Delicious!! I rated 3 stars because it uses white sugar instead of brown, the oven temp. and the oven temp. is way too high.

This is the best ever! Grandma used to make this for us kids in the 60's and it was gone in no time! For those of you that change the white sugar to brown, use the brown sugar recipe..this one is for the white sugar and it don't need altering! You want more  toffee taste use the brown sugar!

This was a hit!  I had a dessert dish to pass at a recent birthday party and everyone loved this!  Everyone I gave the recipe to was shocked to hear saltine crackers were the base for this. Easy and quick!

Fabulous!  I wisked the butter & sugar constantly ~ surprised at how thick & yummy it got so quickly.  I lined my cookie sheet with foil sprayed with non-stick spray .. had no trouble getting the candy to lift out.  Definitely use saltines ~ my sister made this recipe with graham crackers & it just wasn't the same.

OhMyGoodness! I cannot believe how good these were. I did as suugested & used brown sugar binstead of white, upping the amount to one cup. I used both saltines & townhouse crackers & both were very good. I forgot to add the nuts (had many irons in the fire) but never missed them. I made some w/ milk chocoalte chips that I didn't care for because the milk chocolate didn't seem to melt right. ???? I made some w/ mini semi-sweet chips & those were excellent. I let the mini-chips melt a bit & then spread them on the crackers. These are a new family favorite...thanks for sharing!

This recipe was GREAT! And even better, it was EASY and very pretty when put in a nice dish. I took it to work and it was all gone in no time! And they couldn't believe that it was just saltine crackers! I'll definitely use this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

I'll have to try this again with the brown sugar.  It was ok but I've had it before made with brown sugar and it's much better.  I also don't think I cooked it long enough - did the 3 minutes but must have started it early - it's not as crunchy as I'd expect.  I want to try this over graham crackers too.

I was really excited to try this recipe, seeing how many people raved about it, I thought it would be better, maybe, just got to me in the mood for it.  Although, my husband liked it with milk, of course:)  The only thing I suggest is melting the choc chips before putting them on the crackers, it would look alot prettier, letting them melt...it didnt look pretty, presentation is important.

Easy to make, yummy and nice looking when done.  I topped mine with chopped pecans and used the brown sugar recommended by another reviewer.
People were suprised when I told them it contained saltines!

Just like my family would make when I was a kid. The only change I made was that I used pecans instead of walnuts, but that's just be because we were out of walnuts! This is definitely better with walnuts.

My four stars is only related to my inability to read instructions. I was ambitious and used the whole box of crackers - i think reading the 16oz threw me off! Four cookie sheets later, i had a messy kitchen and a not so pretty end result. However, these little crackers were still quite tasty and spread much further thoughout my department at work because I used the whole box of crackers. Plus, from a health standpoint, 2 sticks of butter and the cup of brown sugar and the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and smoked chopped almonds I used were calorically reduced drastically by spreading the measurements thinner. Overall, the taste was great! The appeal was awful. And, the cookie sheets were easy to clean up (thanks to the non-stick cooking spray). I will likely try this again but using the right proportions.

I attempted this recipe a few days ago and used Hershey's chocolate chips rather than a semi-sweet (Nestle's) chips and it was an abominable failure!  The chips did not melt...at all!  Today, I followed the recipe exactly and the chips melted and spread easily.  At times, substituting ingredients and "making it your own" doesn't work! Look great....tastes great!

As with the rest of you I didn't think this would be so good. I served it for my domino group, and they could not stop eating it. I want to make it for gifts for Christmas it was so good and easy. Thanks for posting it. Oh I used brown sugar instead of white.

Tried this recipe - ok. But, when exchanging brown sugar for the white sugar it tasted much better.  I was in a jam one time when asked to make this and used graham crackers - different taste but very tasty.

This recipe was quick and easy to make. Tastes like a more complicated recipe. I didn't get the sugar mixture to the corners of the crackers, so some didn't turn out well. Next time I'll make more of the syrup concoction.

This is my weakness. I actually only make 1/4 of the recipe at a time because I cannot stop myself from eating it until it's gone! Yummy!

This is really good and pretty easy. I made it for Christmas and it was very popular. I did substitute brown sugar for white, and left out the nuts, but it was fantastic.

Super yummy!  I used graham crackers because that's what I had in the pantry.  I'm sure it would be delicious with saltines, too.  My friends all loved it and asked for the recipe!

I couldn't believe how easy this was to make! I've made it twice now, once using 1 cup of light brown sugar and today using 1 cup of dark, brown sugar with peanut butter and semisweet chocolate chips. The verdict is still out for the latter, but if tasting the mixture on what was left on the wooden spoon after spreading the chips it is going to be another hit I'm sure! The first time I made it I used a sheet cake pan and I didn't have any problems with the crackers sticking to the bottom. The second time I used the same pan, but lined it with the nonstick aluminum foil. Wonderful candy recipe, Debbie. Thank you for submitting it!

My family just loved these and so did I. These are great for anyone who is in the mood for something usually good. These are now a family favorite and anyone who trys them wont be sorry. For an even more creative cracker try substituting cinnamon,butterscotch, or white chocolate in place of Chocolate chips.

made a few changes per others' suggestions - used graham crackers, brown sugar instead of white and used foil sprayed w/cooking spray. These were awesome!

I made this with margarine, gram crackers, and no nuts.  SO GOOD!  It really does taste like score bars.  If you want to make it even more so...just leave out the crackers!  DELICIOUS!

This is a great recipe. Be careful not to cook the sugar mixture too high once it starts to boil or it can burn. The chocolate chips spread great after sitting for just a minute on top of the crackers. Everyone loved it.

This was a hit with everyone who tried it, I like the taste of the salty cracker with the sweet toffee and chocolate.  I did have trouble getting mine off the cookie sheet without leaving a lot of the cracker layer behind.

yum yum yum.  used pecans instead of walnuts.  was concerned about the sugar-butter mixture not firming up, so i cooked it a couple extra minutes....actually JUST until it kinda starting separating (brown sugar used, by the way)--and it turned out perfectly!  very rich, but very good.  will make it again!

I used brown sugar and REAL UNSALTED BUTTER. Please do yourself a favor, do not use anything other than REAL BUTTER, otherwise the batter will be runny. Also, I didn't find that the chocolate chips melted very well so I placed the pan in the oven (it was still warm from previous use) just long enough to melt the chips, pulled it out sprinkled some almonds on top and began spreading the batter across the crackers. It taste just as cracker candy should taste :)

My cracker cookies came out fabulous!  Instead of crackers I used toll house crackers and the buttery taste of the cracker made it taste really good.  I ran out after two days and had to make more!!

I made this recipe without adjusting anything and it turned out GREAT! There are plenty of recipes out there for cracker candy made with brown sugar, so there's really no reason to adjust this one. After I made this recipe I tried another with brown sugar, and I definitely prefer the taste of the white sugar—it seems more like a toffee than a caramel.

It was ok, didn't taste as expected.  I think it was the sugar and butter along with the walnuts.

This is a great and easy recipe with a slight tweak. Definitely use brown sugar instead of white. It's also good to make with the pretzel snaps if you don't want to use saltines

This was great!  I think next time I will try laying parchment paper down on the cookie sheet so it's easier to pry up.  "If I didn't know they were crackers, I would never guess," is what my mom said.

Recipe is good but most of the sticky goodness stuck to the pan instead of the crackers.. Would have gave it a 5 otherwise.

I had heard about this from a friend prior to finding this recipe! She told me that it was absolutely delicious and so I decided to search for it here on Allrecipes. I came upon this recipe (it was the highest rated) and I must say I absolutely can see & taste why! I just finished breaking it up into pieces after I let it set up overnight in the fridge! How marvelous this is! Who would have thought crackers could be so good? The only modification I made was in the sugar area since I had read a lot of the reviews in which folks said to use brown sugar instead of white. It came out fabulously!! I used 1 cup of brown sugar to the 2 sticks of butter. Also, I covered my pan with waxed paper before baking off the crackers and sugar mixture. It made for a much easier clean up! Wonderful recipe! I am sharing it with all my friends! This is certainly a keeper and yields quite a lot of candy.

I made this for a dinner at work.  I didn't really have anything to make & this was ingredients I had on hand.  I thought they were kind of mess & hard to handle, but they were a hit anyways! I would make again in a pinch, but it's not a recipe I would automatically think of.

These were very quick and easy.  They taste good (I wouldn't say great....just okay).  I don't know how people can say they don't know they are eating saltines, though.  It was VERY apparent to me that I was eating a saltine cracker with toffe/chocolate/nuts on it.  Not that that is a terrible thing....but trust me, it won't be a secret!

Good, but I'm not impressed. To me, it tasted just like a crispy brownie with nuts. Nothing at all like I expected it to be. The saltine cracker base is visible (not what I expected either); I was hoping I could fool my co-workers into thinking I had made the entire thing from scratch. Oh well; I probably won't try it again.

WOW this is delicious. Be careful when the pan is in the oven- 5 min goes by fast and sugar burns quickly. I sprinkled half the pan w/ chopped walnuts and the other half w/ crushed candy canes. Very festive and yummy! thanks!

I've been told that you can also make this with graham crackers. I think that the salt must make a huge difference.

Very good.  I don't think I've ever made this with actual saltines since we never seem to have them in the house, so it's usually been Ritz crackers, or some kind of buttery cracker.  Either way, the results are the same and this never lasts but a day or so in my house.  Sometimes I reduce the butter by a couple of tablespoons when I make this as well as the sugar, and it doesn't seem to affect the candy as a whole.  Good during Christmas, or any time!

Quick, easy and great to take somewhere or give as a gift!  Variations can easily be made by changing the toppings.

I could not believe that you made this candy with saltine crackers. I decided to make this recipe anyway. I used a nonstick mat on my cookie sheet. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup sugar. You do not want to overcook  (burn) the butter and sugar, and you must stir it constantly. Once the chocolate has melted completely it is very easy to spread. The candy tasted like I toffee. It was very good! I think next time I will make it with graham crackers instead of saltine crackers. Thank you Debbie!

Ok, I've tried to make these twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  The toffee turned out a little too light and not quite the right texture.  The second time, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1 cup of brown sugar.  It was PERFECT this time.  Also, I used only half the chocolate chips, as I like it to be a little less chocolate-y.  Just be careful that you spread out the chocolate chips on top first and then press the nuts in, otherwise they won't stick correctly.

Tis Good! Tastes something like "Heath" candy bars.  I used 3/4 c. packed brown sugar and omitted the white sugar as many suggested.  Spray your baking sheet and make sure it has sides to keep the sugar topping from making a mess in the oven.
