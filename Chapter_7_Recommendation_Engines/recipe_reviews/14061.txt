I really liked these muffins alot!!! I made a few changes. I used half the ammount of molases and substituted honey for the other half. I also doubled the brown sugar. Oh and I love the spices so I doubled the ammount of cinnamon and allspice. I've made this recipe twice and my husband who hates muffins even likes them :) That's high praise coming from him.

THis recipe was rather bland and tasteless.  I was excited about trying a healthy muffin for lunches, but they were so gross no one ate them.  More spice and flavouring definitely needed.

I was looking for a way to get carrots into my toddler's diet and she (and daddy) really liked these. However, they weren't as big a hit with me and my older son. The molasses is a little overpowering for my taste (and I like molasses!) so I'll probably use less next time. I also substituted cardamom for the allspice and topped 'em with a basic cream cheese frosting.

I'm sorry but these muffins were not as good as they sounded.  All I could taste was baking soda!  I can only hope that I did something wrong in the preparation because they were so wierd.  I am a big fan of healthy food, so I know it wasn't the lower sugar that bothered me.  These tasted very wrong.  I threw them out into the woods for the squirrels to eat.  I hope they like them.

Great muffins - I got some delicious crust with moist and chewy inside. Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar, though (may be the carrots I used this time were too sweet, though). Thanks!

Excellent recipe! I like that it makes 24. I did add a little more sugar 2/3 cup and reduced molasses to 1/4 because of others comments but I think 1/2 c molasses is fine. I couldn't taste the molasses at 1/4.   Also, I might add a little more spice next time. I baked 20 min., just right. They were moist. Nuts on top was nice as well. I might sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on top next time. (I thought 2 Tbsp baking powder might be too much and used 1 Tbsp and a little less salt, was perfect.)I will make these again and again.

My kids and I loved the muffins but baking at 200Â°C for 25 minutes made them too dark/hard on the outside. I guess this is a matter of oven.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These are really good, but you need to realize that they are carrot MUFFINS, not carrot cupcakes. They aren't supposed to taste like carrot cake!! I cut the recipe in half and used applesauce and some oil instead of the melted butter. I also added some pumpkin pie spice. Delicious!!

What a great way to get some carrots into my 6 year old!  I followed the suggestions to cut molasses, double the spices.  I also realized I was out of butter so I used 6 Tablespoons of veg. oil instead.  Will make again.

Bland and boring. These are definately not sweet enough. I'm glad they're healthy, but the taste isn't worth it.

These were great! Even little boys loved them. But I did NOT cool for 25-30 minutes. Using toothpick method, they were done at about 18 minutes.

Except for the fact that I cut the recipe in half to make only a dozen muffins, I followed the recipe exactly, and the came out great. However, mine only took about 15 minutes to bake instead of 20-25. They were very moist, and good served warm with a little butter. I would definitely make these again.

Absolutely the worse muffin that I have ever made. I made two batches to freeze and had to alter the second batch to make it bearable to eat. Never have I had a recipe turn out so badly.

Very tasty! Not too sweet. Nice texture. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added the carrots to the wet mixture not the dry as I didn't want them to turn green from the baking powder (not sure if they really do, but I've heard this before). I made one loaf and 12 muffins, and increased the loaf time by 8-10 minutes from the muffins. Will make these again, maybe with a bit more brown sugar as we like a sweeter muffin, but overall very happy with them!

Small, hard, bland, bitter (too much molasses). I wasn't expecting fluffy carrot cake, but a dense, moist, soft-ish muffin. If you're going to try it, I recommend 1/2 as much molasses, even if you don't add more sugar. I used yogurt for 80% of the milk, plus 1/2 tsp baking soda per cup of yogurt (2 recommendation for substituting with yogurt). They were really overcooked at 25 mins, but even just trying to eat the softer inside was not good--ok at first but severe molasses aftertaste.

These muffins are delicious! They are moist and tender with a mild flavor. I did make a couple of substitutions to match what I had on hand and everything still turned out wonderfully. We served them with honey.

Given that I made several substitutions, I'm not sure that what I made can still be considered "this" recipe, but I did use this recipe as a basis for my carrot muffins :).  I substituted one cup of wheat bran for one cup of whole wheat flour, and I substituted honey for the molasses.  Aside from that, I used the other ingredients as listed and baked for about 18 minutes.  The muffins are moist and tasty.  Not overly sweet, but definitely not bland.  I will make them again using the same substitutions.

Bland, needs more sugar and flavor. Texture was strange for a carrot muffin that are typically more moist and rich.

This made a great beakfast for my kids.  These were not too sweet.  I turned up the spices a bit and substituted apple for half the carrot, just because I had apples to use up.  I was sad I didn't have walnuts, but pumpkin seeds made a good substitute.  Definitely will make again.

I used 2 mashed bananas instead of butter, skipped the molasses, and added extra sugar and spices.  Turned out well for me.  I don't think using the amount of cinnamon and allspice called for in the recipe would have made it flavorful enough.

bland!  Needs more spice and more sugar.  Other than that the texture was nice and they baked up perfectly according to the time specified.  Kids dont like nuts or raisins so I didnt add them, maybe the raisins would have lent it some flavor though.

It's not a bad muffin, but the flavor is kind of lacking. I used walnuts and put raisins in half the muffins; my boyfriend enjoyed the ones with raisins. I'm surprised there wasn't more flavor because the batter smelled delicious! Edit 5/1/16: I gave these another try, doubling the cinnamon and allspice, using applesauce for half of the butter, and adding a good splash of vanilla. This time I really enjoyed them, there was more flavor and a good texture, plus healthy!

Easy to make. Had all ingredients on hand. Not the best muffin I have had but my kids liked them. I will make again but probably add another 1/4 cup sugar. Also, mine were done in about 17 minutes.

I found the same thing as other reviewers, tough, chewy and tasteless. Way too much time, energy and resources were expended for results that made me sad. I tried adding apple sauce, honey and some more spices into the second half (12 spots on the muffin tin, this recipe made 24 muffins) But those were just a little too wet and fell after I took them out of the oven. I don't think any amount of tweaking will persuade me to try this again

Just made these for the kids and they were so good. I took the advice of some of the other people and added a little more brown sugar, less molasses and more spices. Excellent! Mois and light. Will definately make these again.

These muffins were so moist! I sprinkled powdered sugar for my small daughters but made some cream cheese icing also and everyone liked them! And I got my family to eat carrots!yay!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I thought they had a good texture and tasted great--moist but not too sweet. I did use all whole wheat flour (you can't tell the difference) and oil instead of butter because it's what I had on hand, and I added a bit of nutmeg instead of allspice since I had none (cloves or a mixture may have also worked, but I generally don't like their flavor).  You can barely taste the carrot; it could have easily passed as pumpkin (albeit, not a very strong-flavored one). The flavor isn't too strong, which I guess is why some people say they're bland, but I thought the spices were just right--and I even used a bit less! All in all, I think it's a good, decently healthy muffin--and a good way to help me use my garden's endless supply of carrots.

I think that these muffins are okay.  I doubled (and a half :-)) the brown sugar, and I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and tbsp of ginger, cloves, and nutmeg (in addition to the cinnamon).  I also used soymilk instead of regular milk.  I think if I make these again, I will add more vanilla, and spices. And I would try the whole applesauce thing I seen in another review. This recipe does give a good basic to go by so that you can add your own pizzazz(i hope that i spelled that correctly) to it.

After reading the description, I thought it sounded wonderful.  After baking the muffins and trying them, I , along with my husband and daughter were very disappointed.  While they were very moist, the molasses overpowers them, and there are not sweet enough to be tasty.  I would never use this recipe again, and I will have to throw most of them away.

I made a half batch which turned out 24 mini-muffins and 5 regular muffins.  These were OK, but not a recipe I'll make again.  I doubled the sugar but they were still just so-so.  Thanks anyway.

I just made this, I really liked it. Next time I will try shredding the carrots with the food processor as that took awhile but we all liked them here!

Very dense... needed to spread butter on it afterwards. Otherwise, tasteless.

this is why you read the reviews first. these didn't turn out for me. possibly the gluten-free flour i used?  seems like 4 cups of flour is a lot. also, too much molasses. use honey. dough was really thick, and although the muffins rose, they didn't fully cook, even after baking for twice what the recipe says.

My whole family enjoys these. To save time, I finely chop my carrots in the mini food processor instead of grating them.

These are good. I did the 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c ground flax seed. 25 minutes however is too long at 400. I made medium to large muffins. I would say start checking them about 20 minutes or even a little before.

I thought these were bland. I doubled the spices but it didn't help. All I could taste was molasses. Nice texture, looked yummy, but didn't even taste like carrots.

These muffins tasted good but I was disappointed that when I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full, instead of baking to a nice top, they sank to 1/2 full. It's entirely possible I did something to cause that. I just warn others to try this recipe at least once before making it to serve to guests or take to a school function!

This was an instant favourite for me!  They are filling and tasty!  My only complaint is that they are slightly dry.  A few seconds in the microwave and a small smear of vegan butter cures that!
