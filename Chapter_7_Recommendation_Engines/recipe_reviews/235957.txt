My family is from Akwesasne and, living far away in Georgia, I've been trying to find a recipe (that's been written down) for this soup from home.  Today, I used a ham shank for the pork and added some green cabbage.  Came out perfect!  I've also had this soup made with smoked ham hocks as well as venison, and all versions have turned out great!  Thank for for posting this!  Now I'm off to make some fry bread for it

This recipe is easy, versatile and delicious! I added acorn squash instead of rutabagas. I also added onions, but it would have been great even without the onions.
