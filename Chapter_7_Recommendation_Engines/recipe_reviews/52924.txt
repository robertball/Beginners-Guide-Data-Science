I will definitely make this again but I made several changes, which is why it's getting 4 stars: I substituted about 1 c. frozen [mixed] bell pepper for the green bell pepper, ~1/4 c. white onion for the green onion, and plain tomato sauce (about 22 oz. or so) for the marinara sauce [after each layer of tomato sauce, I sprinkled on some Italian seasoning].  I upped the garlic to at least a Tablespoon.  Because I was serving this as a main dish, I sauteed eight 1/4" slices of eggplant in olive oil to create two additional layers.  I mixed all 3 of the cheeses together (1/2 c. fontina and just over 1 c. mozzarella). The Parmesan naturally fell to the bottom of the bowl and mostly ended up on the top of the casserole anyway.  The eggplant was the perfect addition to this dish and really soaked up the tomato sauce nicely.  Next time, my top layers will go tomato sauce, polenta, and then the cheese - this way the polenta on the top will brown slightly and add a nice crunch.  Although this was absolutely delicious, I would not make it for "fancy" company as it is a bit sloppy to serve. This might be because I used 1.5 times the sauce suggested or the fact that we were starving and didn't let it cool.  If using an 8x8, I suggest cutting your polenta into 18 slices - 9 slices for each of 2 layers, and 8 slices of eggplant, 4 slices per layer.  A hit with the adults and my 10 month old son.

This was a great dish!  I added a couple of chopped portobello mushrooms after cooking the peppers and onions a bit.  I also didn't have any nice cheese on hand, so I used grated cheddar and mozzarella for the cheese.  Still, it was extremely tasty!  Even the kids (6 and 8) asked for seconds!

I make my own polenta (it's easier and a LOT cheaper!) and my own basil marinara sauce. It is delicious.

I loved this  dish My husband is a vegetarian and I made it for Thanksgiving (along with a pork loin for the meat eaters). I used frozen pepper and onion mix i also added extra garlic and doubled the  whole recipe. In place of the  fontina i used the italian mixed cheese and then I topped it with fresh sliced mozzerella. This was a huge hit It was all gone but there was pork left over...

Good. I used Puttenesca sauce instead of marinara.

Very good. Added mushrooms. Used red pepper, yellow onion, Italian blend cheese. What I had on hand...and needed to use. Had to add a bit more than 14 ounces sauce...probably because of the added veggies. I've made a similar casserole before. Honestly, next time I don't think I will bother with multiple thin lasagna like layers. Easier to serve and eat with a medium thick slice of polenta with sauce over. Also...I had a 24 oz tube of 'corn meal mush' and didn't think it tasted any different than the much pricier polenta. (Used 16 oz for this.) Found the mush at the store in the refrig section with bacon and sausage. My grandma used to make mush for breakfast.  Fry crispy and smother in butter and maple syrup...yum!

This was fabulous! I only made two layers, used a bit more sauce and all mozzarella cheese versus some fontina.  My husband loved it.  I think you could  subsitute salsa for marinara sauce and cheddar cheese for mozzarella and this would be a great Mexican sidedish.

I'm so bummed!  I did not pay attention to my jarred sauce and added 26 ounces instead of 14. It was way too soupy. Will have to try again. I swapped yellow onion instead of green onion and red pepper instead of green pepper. I know that I would prefer provolone over mozzarella. I used mozzarella because that is all I had. I think I would also do 1/2 fontina and 1/2 provolone. Super easy to do.

Simple and delicious.  Instead of sauteeing peppers and onions, I just stirred my favorite spices into the sauce and used homemade polenta.  We all enjoyed this!

In fact, I'm making it again tonight.

We loved this recipe. It was easy to make and tasted great. I added a half of a rotisserie chicken chopped up, used red instead of green peppers and did not have fontana cheese so I used a combination of mozzerella, chedder and jack. It is very good but very messy looking when you serve it!

I loved this recipe. I used Sun Dried tomato polenta, added some peas to the tomato sauce (I used a can of sauce and used my own spices). I didn't have fotina, so I used a low fat italian blend. If done correctly this can be a low calorie dish. Turned out great and very versatile!

This is a good recipe. Used provolone & mozzarella to make up the total cheese instructed for provolone. Served with Jambasta (from another website) & salad.

Okay.  This was pretty good.  I really liked the taste of this dish, but the texture was not so great.  It was kind of mushy.  I did add zucchini, mushrooms and onion to it and that helped the texture greatly.  I would do it again, but play with different options for the polenta.

This was pretty tasty, but would benefit from a more substantial sauce.  I loved the mix of different cheeses though - even my picky-eating husband liked this.

Wonderful. Only change was using more marinara and more garlic. The combo of these three cheeses is what makes this so yummy

Wow! At last found a great recipe for polenta! I added crimini mushrooms, more olive oil, more garlic (2 cloves), and chopped red onion instead of green onion. Used Italian cheese mix and a little sharp cheddar. Simple and so delicious, we kept going for more. Will definitely make again.

This is the first recipe I've found on here that was super tasty. I used English farmhouse cheddar we had on hand instead of Fontina and I added a full tablespoon of minced garlic. If I were to change anything, might add a bit more sauce, like 16 oz instead of 14. I used a mushroom marinara. Yum!

I made this for dinner tonight for my 3 boys (ages 7, 10 and 12) and they loved it!!!!! I will be making this time and time again!!!! 
This recipe was very easy on the pocket book..... I am a single mom and being able to stick to a budget is important to me. It was nice to fix something "fancy" that didn't cost a fortune!!!!!
