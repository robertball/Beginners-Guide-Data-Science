Very good mashed potatoes made even better with the addition of half again as much horseradish and some cream cheese.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients exactly, nor did I follow all the steps in the recipe which were unnecessary. I just mixed up all the ingredients together, adding extra horseradish and some cream cheese, then added the mixture, using a potato masher,to the cooked Yukon Golds which I left unpeeled.

I used red potatoes with the skins and this worked out well.  Instead of sour cream I used some 1/2 and 1/2 cream and put all the butter in the mixture.  The parsley gives it some nice color and flavor.

taking the advice of naples, i used the full amt. of horseradish called for even though i only used three potatoes.  after boiling/draining the pots, i also threw everything together and mashed away.  i had to add a little milk because mine were waaaaay too dry.  in the end they turned out fabulous and i'm glad to have come across this recipe.

My potatoes were a little small--I used a couple more. I also used reduced fat sour cream. I served this with pot roast and it was a perfect combination. My husband and kids thought these potatoes were very good. They wanted to know what I added to the potatoes to make them so good!

Chef John suggested horseradish mash potatoes with his easy beef pot roast so I tried these.  Very tasty!  I made them a second time and added a bit more horseradish, which made them even better.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! (BTW, I gave 5 stars to Chef John's pot roast, too!)

I am NOT a fan of horseradish, but I had some horseradish potatoes at a Christmas function last year, and decided to find the recipe.  This is awesome!  Even if you don't particularly care for horseradish, this gives them a little extra zing!

Made these with instant mashed potatoes and heavy whipping cream; left out the parsley. My husband loved the delicate flavor. Quite surprising. Will make these many more times.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  I saw some other posts that said they weren't flavorful enough.  I have to wonder what brand of horseradish they are using.  I used a German brand and the flavor was just right! I made this as specified except I did add a little cream to the finished product as I like a little creamier consistency.

This recipe is pretty vague--it would be helpful if the weight of 5 potatoes was included, as not all potatoes are equal.  As well as, what particular potatoes works best.  I used 2 lbs yukon gold unpeeled and put through a ricer.  I did add some cream cheese, to taste.

Delish I also had to add liquid (half & half) and used cream cheese with chives...salt is the key..it brings out the flavor.

I was really skeptical because I consider myself a mashed potato expert--and I have never made them without cream or milk. I must say, these are delicious! Although I did use only 3 potatoes and the full amount of everything else, I was really impressed. Next time, however, I will add some cream to the mix. I am a glutton for butter and cream. And potatoes. And horseradish.

I never had these kind of potatoes before but I often make Chef John's Simple beef pot roast and I decided to take his side suggestion and I found this recipe for horseradish mashed potatoes...this is a simple and tasty recipe! I'm not a horseradish fan but I actually loved this with my meal!

I forgot the parsley but other than that, followed recipe exactly. 

Hubby, who normally doesn't like potatoes at all, especially mashed potatoes, said these were the best mashed potatoes he's ever had.  So 5 stars to the chef who posted it and thanks!

This was wonderful!  The kids even liked it and couldn't figure out that it was horseradish that made it taste so good.  The only thing I changed was that I put all the butter in the potatoes instead of melting it over the top.  This is replacing my old stand-by mashed potatoes!

Perhaps added a bit more horseradish, not sure as I eyeballed it.  Served with roast rib eye and edamame beans.  Only problem was that it was so tasty it was hard to limit serving.

Added twice as much horseradish, some fat free cream cheese and plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  Added chives instead of parsley which really made a big difference! these were great with all of my substitutions, lol!

These tators were pretty tasty!  I was disappointed that I didn't add all of the horseradish!  I was scared!  Well, ends up that it could have used more!  Should have read the reviews first!  Will definetly make this again!

I served this with braised short ribs and gravy. This recipe is great conceptually, but the horseradish flavor fell a bit flat (even after I added two heaping tablespoons) and was lost when the potatoes were topped with gravy. Everyone agreed that more horseradish wouldn't have been a bad thing. Also, don't forget to salt the potatoes!

I did not add the parsley. These are really good, I gave a 4 only because my kids are not used to mashed potoatoes with a kick!! I will make again for me, and make plain ones for them.

These mashed potatoes were delicious.  Very tasty.  I only had unsalted butter and used that.  I added salt at the end to taste.  I also used creamy horseradish.  Excellent!  Will make again.

Simple to make.  Horseradish gives an old standard a different twist.  Paired really well with Osso Buco.

Nice flavor, however it was a little dry for me, probably too much potato. I added milk and more sour cream, all good!

I LOVED THESE!!  I highly recommend upping the amount of horseradish though.  I think anyone who doesn't like horseradish would like these and not even know it's in there!  It gives it a little tangy-ness, without the harshness :)  SO YUMMY!!!

I made these to go with a pot roast. I did use fresh ground horseradish, cause that's the way I roll. If you are thinking about trying these, give it a shot. you'll be glad you did.

I had to add a bit more sour cream than called for since they were a tad dry. The horseradish was a nice  extra added flavor. My husband and son really liked them. Not the best mashed potatoes I've had but nice to have something a bit different for a change.

This was very tasty, however I would add more horseradish the next time.  I like that burning feeling in my nose. :)

I first made this 2 year ago for Thanksgiving to experiment. I made regular mashed potatoes as well because I figured not many people would like these, but it turned out everyone ate these and we had tons of the regular mashed potatoes left over. Since then my family requests this for every holiday - it is a huge hit!
I added more horseradish than the recipe called for, I initially put in the amount it says and then add more to taste.

This is great recipe. I only changed by adding a bit more butter omitted sour cream used red potatoes and horseradish sauce as substitute for prepared horseradish. Added to usual fare of mashed potatoes greatly. Family loves it!!!

I have made this by the recipe in the past and it was a hit!  Tonight I used Yukon and red potatoes both with the skin and since I didn't have sour cream, I used a package of cream cheese.  I did add about a cup of milk and  doubled the horseradish.    My family liked it better with the cream cheese .  Thank you for the recipe!  Five stars!

Followed some suggestions to add some cream cheese, added about 3 oz and just 2 tbs. of sour cream. I think next time I will add a bit more horseradish, because we really like it. Used red potatoes with skin on and just smashed it all together in 1 pan after draining  potatoes. Will make again.

we loved this.. but the key to making this is knowing how strong your horseradish is.. i have some kind of horseradish "sauce" which is really mild so i added a lot more.. left the skins on the potatoes.. used cilantro instead of parsley.. salt and peppered to taste.. ty for the recipe

Delicious and different. The horseradish isn't so strong that it overpowers, but there is certainly a distinctive tang that makes these potatoes different from the usual. Riced the potatoes for extra smoothness, and then simply mixed the other ingredients (except parsely) together and stirred into the potatoes, sprinkling the top with parsley. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good!  I added another spoonful of sour cream and another half tablespoon of horseradish but found it to be a little dry.  I was out of milk so I added a little of the starchy water that I cooked the potatoes in (always reserve some water for this purpose!).  It complimented my roast beautifully!  No need for horseradish sauce with these potatoes.

This had zero flavor. I did not taste the horseradish at all. I had to double the horseradish and add cream cheese. Then it was great.

My husband loves horseradish and enjoyed these potatoes very much.  If I make these again, I would add a little milk.  They didn't turn out as creamy we would have liked.

I was actually sort of disappionted with this recipe.  I think less sour cream, more horseradish and amybe some raosted garlic would do wonders for it.  I just thought it tasted like sour cream and it was way too heavy.

I was pretty happy with this recipe as it was easy, and really did spice up the potatoes.
