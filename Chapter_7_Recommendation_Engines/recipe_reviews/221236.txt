I did make a few substitutions in this recipe due to milk allergies/dietary restrictions/using what I had on hand. I used lactose-free milk, chopped pecans instead of cashews, I increased the craisins/coconut (I did use unsweetened coconut) and I used two packets of Truvia instead of granulated white sugar (I stirred the Truvia into the oatmeal before serving). This was INCREDIBLE. The kids and I LOVED this oatmeal--for me, it was like having dessert for breakfast. EXCELLENT.

This is delicious.  I had a bowl this morning with a fresh peach.  I didn't have any cashews so substituted pecans nor did I have any coconut.  I did add some flax seed at the end of the cooking time to make it even more nutritious.  I made the recipe for four and will be having this for breakfast for the next three mornings it appears.  Again delicious!

UPDATE:  I made up another batch and found a suggestion on the www. that you can freeze individual servings in cupcake wrappers and nuke them for a couple minutes, stir and 30 seconds or more.  I now have several individual servings that I can utilize when in a hurry (or not) in the morning.

I like a really creamy oatmeal so I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of water. I left out the cashews. Very tasty!

I like to sweeten the oatmeal at the end with a little maple syrup.  A trick to cut down the cook time is to boil the water and pour it over the oat grout the evening prior.  Let it set covered overnight and it should only take 10-15 minutes max to cook in the morning.

One of the most important things you need to do is to toast the oatmeal first in a dry pan. Ooooh, so good.

I made this for a teacher's breakfast at my children's school.  It was a huge hit! So many asked for the recipe and gave me compliments.  Thank you for posting this recipe! My changes: I under cooked the oats as I needed to transport this in a crock pot and keep it on low at the breakfast. Also I kept out the coconut, cashews, cranberries and sugar. I used those as toppings so the teacher's could individualize their own oats.

This was super yummy!  This was only my second time making steel cut oats (the first time I made them, I was not impressed - but thought I'd give this recipe a try to see if I could change my mind).  It worked!  I did use 2 cups of almond milk and 1-1/2 cups water.  I also used slivered almonds instead of the cashews (because that's what I had on-hand).  I served mine over a fresh chopped peach, garnished with a few more slivered almonds and a sprinkling of brown sugar.  It was delicious AND filling!

My husband ate 3 of the 4 servings he liked it so well.  He actually makes a granola with a lot of the same ingredients.  I was skeptical of adding the cashews and almost left them out but they added a surprisingly good taste to the oatmeal.  Followed the original recipe except started with 4 cups of liquid (3 water and 1 vanilla almond milk).  Hearty and yummy!

Good recipe. I reduced the water to 3 cups, and used unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of milk. Also, omitted the sugar and cranberries and instead topped with raw peeled and chopped Granny Smith Apple. Stored it in 4 half  pint mason jars for breakfast.

This oatmeal had a great flavor, my family just wasn't really fond of the texture.  We prefer it more "mushy". :)  I've made steel cut oats overnight in the slow cooker before, and that gave us the desired consistency.

Super yummy!  Even my kids liked it.  I soaked the oats overnight to cut down on the cooking time in the morning.  To cook, add all the ingredients bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.  I then let it rest for five minutes to soak up the extra liquid. Instead of cashews, I used sliced almonds and maple syrup instead of sugar.

I always like lots of junk in my ice cream/cereal/food, so this is perfect. I subbed raisins and pecans for the cranberries and cashews. Halved the recipe as well and ended up with a single serving I couldn't finish. This is a hearty, stick-with-ya breakfast.

Sooooo goood!  I like to keep the calorie count as low as possible so I eliminate cooking with milk but when serving I add a little Sugar Free Hazelnut coffee creamer.  I like to alternate with different nuts, walnuts being my favorite, but pecans are also great... and same with fruit.  It's delicious with fresh blueberries, peaches, apples and cinnamon or raisins, cranberries etc.  It's great for breakfast when family is visiting!

I love it.  I used one cup almond milk instead of 1/2 cup milk.  And 3 cups water, instead of 3 1/2 cups.  I toast my pecans before putting them in.  And drizzle just a touch of honey on when it's finished cooking.  Everything is same as recipe.  I love this stuff.

I really enjoyed this oatmeal. This recipe makes a lot so you can warm up some for breakfast on the next day. The only change I made is that I cooked the oatmeal in soy milk instead of water.  Sooo good!

Made a few changes: added pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon, 1 TB chia seeds and 1 TB flax seed.  Used almond milk instead of regular milk and omitted the nuts since my son doesn't like them.  I sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top for added crunch.  Didn't put any sugar in it and it was delicious.  Everyone loved this!  Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe. Great base to sub in any fruit and nuts on hand. Today I chopped up an apple and threw it in at the 10-minutes left mark. I have made this with pears, dried cherries and pepitas as well. I go for a dollop of brown sugar at the end. Thank you for the recipe!

I don't add milk, grew up that way. I add walnuts and cinnamon when almost done. I add a fried egg and 1 or 2 Tbsp of maple syrup to my bowl. Making 4 servings gives me almost all weeks worth of cereal. I just add 2 Tbsp of water and reheat in the microwave.

I love this great breakfast. I made a potful of 8 portions, used milk instead of water, also added hemp seeds along with the oats at the beginning of the cooking process, which gives a great crunchy texture, especially if I don't have the nuts, then use sliced almonds if I have them. I take a cold portion to work to heat up (adding some more milk after heating). My co-workers have asked for my recipe so often! No sweetener needed!

Great recipe!  My thanks also go to Scott for recommending toasting the steel cut oats in a dry pan before cooking.  WOW!  That really increased the nutty flavor.  Smelled great while cooking as well.

Simple & delicious. I didn't have any nuts on hand, but this was great without them. The coconut, vanilla, and cinnamon taste great together.  I used a bit of agave nectar, & topped it with fresh blueberries and strawberries. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I did not have cashews, so made the recipe as is, just eliminating the nuts.  It turned out great.  Definitely plan to make this one again in the future.

I didn't have cashews, so I used pecans.  Also, I used almond milk  because it's what I had on hand.  I increased the cinnamon to two teaspoons.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!!!

I discovered that my rice cooker has a porridge setting, which I use for steel cut oats all the time. I set it to cook overnight. I tried this recipe, adding the extras in the morning and then letting it set on warm in the rice cooker for a while. This is SO GOOD. I did not add the nuts. I used Splenda brown sugar, and definitely more than a pinch.

I loved this recipe, I used lactose free milk, splenda and a hint of Splenda brown sugar. Doubled the recipe for the family. Had plenty left over, refrigerated...microwaved the next day. It was just as amazing. Great texture,  maybe difficult for someone that has a hard time eating nuts, even without the cashews.

Just made this, it was very good!! The one extra thing I added was some ground Chia seed I had on hand and then a bit of maple syrup to finish it off. Love that I'm going to have leftovers all week!!

Made this without the nuts (can't have them) and part of them milk was substitute with greek yogurt.  At the end it seemed really thick so I added a splash of orange juice and instead of the sugar I drizzled it with a small amount of honey.  YUM! Glad that there are leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. :)

Wow, I loved this recipe.  I use rice milk in place of dairy.  And I didn't have any cranberries.  It was delicious.  I do love the texture of steel cut oatmeal, and adding cashews and coconut added a lot of texture and taste.   Perfection!  I made a full batch and took another reviewer's suggestion to freeze portions in cupcake holders.

Soooo good. I'm officially converted to steel-cut oats! Keeps me full for longer than any other kind of breakfast. I used chopped walnuts, coconut, and raisins, with a bit of brown sugar. Even my 2 year old ate the whole bowl and asked for more! This keeps for a long time in the fridge too, so you can make a big pot and just re-heat small portions all week for a fast breakfast.
