This is a great use of pumpkin seeds.  Next time I would coat the seeds in a bowl before putting them on the baking sheet just so that they are evenly coated, and add a little more sugar to cater to my sweet tooth.

I added a lot more cinnamon, as well as some Allspice, Nutmeg & substituted White Sugar with Raw Sugar. I also increased the Oven Temperature to 425 for 10-15 minutes (mine roasted perfectly in 12 mins). The house even smelled delish!!!

i mixed the pumpkin seeds, oil, spices, sugar together in a bowl before putting them on the baking sheet.  it was not as sweet as i expected, but the seeds were well toasted and well covered with seasoning.  in future, i may try the recipe with a little more sugar....

Made 4 different kinds of roasted pumpkin seeds and the family like this one the best. Didn't use any all spice as I didn't have any and they were just as good.

Loved it!  Had family pumpkin carving and had 8 cups of seeds.  Used them all - ate them all!
