In a word, outstanding. I swear these potatoes even outshined the grilled Porterhouse steaks we served with them! Who would have ever thought that such a simple but unique blend of ingredients could make a potato taste this special? I used regular Yukon Gold potatoes and fresh chives intead of green onion, neither of which would really change the outcome. Other than that, I prepared these exactly as the recipe directs, and will do so in the future. This recipe is perfect as written. Creamy, flavorful, but with no, one dominant spice or flavor hitting your taste buds.  Pretty too!  Simple but extraordinary.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This simple mix of ingredients deserves 10 stars. Amazing flavor! I wasn't expecting much, but after mixing it all together and tasting it, the potatoes were divine. Use good quality parmesan (not the stuff in the green can!). I've since used this sauce on baked fish or drizzle it over grilled fish and chicken. This caper sauce is so versatile but it's especially good with white fish (halibut, tilapia, cod, sole). TIP- unless your new potatoes are really small, I would definitely cut the potatoes into chunks. The cut-up potatoes releases it's starches and creates a nice thick, creamy sauce once mixed with the caper sauce. The spuds also absorbs the sauce better this way.

We rarely rate things 5 stars but when you are ooohhing and ahhhing while eating something it deserves it.  Wow!  We absolutely enjoyed this.  Even though we were using baby new potatoes we still cut them in half after cooking to maximaize the ingredients soaking into the potatoes.  Also, we melted the butter with all the ingredients except the parm, added the potatoes to the warm butter mixture, sprinkled in the parm and then mixed it all together.  Holy Moly were these good!  Very fresh and rich.  Also, only used 1/4 of butter due to diet restriction and they were still perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again and again.

This was really good, but I have to admit the teeny bit of vinegar kept creeping up on me in this.  I felt the capers and parmesan alone added enough tangy flavor and decided the next time I would skip it.  So, tonight was round two -  omitted the vinegar and as I was measuring the capers I thought maybe I should add some lemon - after all, I love chicken piccata and that has lemon and capers.   Wow!  That subtle change made this into probably one of my favorite recipes here!  Thank you so much for sharing! Never would have come up with this on my own!

I saw this recipe this morning as I was trying to figure out what I should bring that was a potato dish for our Easter dinner ... boy am I glad I did!  These are SO easy and just yummy!  I didn't even add any salt or pepper and I didn't notice anyone at Easter dinner doing it either.  I used shredded parm and it looked really nice, didn't clump like in the picture.  I really recommend this recipe!  UPDATE: Leftovers warm up beautifully in the microwave.  Also, I wanted to point out that the "sauce" (prior to adding it to the potatoes) is not thin and runny ... it is just softened butter.  The heat of the boiled potatoes melts the butter into a true sauce.

I cut the butter in half...added extra capers and green onion (next time I make it will increase even more to like 3-4 TBS capers and 1/4 cup green onion....or maybe my new potatoes were just GIANTS??!!) anyway...I would also increase the vinegar a tad.  But who needs a stick of butter??!! Not me...didn't even miss it

I found beautiful tiny red new potatoes at the produce market, so I cooked them whole.  I found the butter mixture just kind of rolled off the potatoes, so the next time I make this dish, I'll cut in half (regardless of size), so the potato can better absorb the flavor.  I think this mixture also would be delicious as a butter spread on some toasted baguettes.

These were good. I timed dinner badly the night I made these and was in a hurry to get dinner on the table. The potatoes came out under cooked and were disappointing. It was my fault so I cant rate this recipe unfairly and say it was terrible. It was defiantly my fault. Want to try this again cooked right. Sauce was yummy.

Are there six stars??!!  These were quite possibly the best potatoes I've ever had.  I did decrease the butter to 2 tbsp and add a tbsp of olive oil.  Also used regular onion and dried parsley.  WOW, I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  And make it again...maybe next week!

I made this as a sauce over wheat pasta last night to get an idea of its flavor. I sauted ingredients, used seasoned rice wine vinegar, added portabello mushrooms and frozen peas, then extra parm at after serving up. Really good sauce although alittle on the vinegar side for noodles; I'll bet it's awesome on potatoes though as they're denser- I'll have to try that! Thanks for sharing...

These potatoes were fantastic!  I love capers and I was looking for something to accompany a chicken dish I was making and this went perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly and I would'nt change a thing. There was even enough sauce to pour over the chicken.  Yummy!

If you're tired of boring potatoes you've gotta try these.  Very easy, I prepared the butter mixture ahead so it was easy to toss together when the potatoes were done.  We cannot wait to try this again, it would go well with a lightly crusted fish or a plain beef.  It was too much sauce and flavor to serve with Cousin Cosmo's Greek Chicken but we loved both recipes.

WOW!  I could have eaten these as a meal, they are amazing!  I reduced the butter a bit, but my husband and daughter have requested these again very soon.  The flavor combination is heavenly. I can't wait to serve these to friends--that's the true test of a recipe, if it's worthy of serving to friends you know it's GOOD!  Thanks so much for sharing Michelle!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it with fingerling potatoes. Didn't have parmesan, but used 3 cheese italian instead.  Delicious, my family loved it.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thanks Michelle.

These are fantastic. I could tell by reading the recipe I'd enjoy it, but I didn't know how much. The ONLY change I made was to use fingerling potatoes because I prefer them, but since the rest of the ingredients are what make this recipe, it still easily deserves the rating. I even borrowed white wine vinegar to make it the first time because I only had red and balsamic, but I think they'll be great with either of those next time I make them, and there will be a next time.

The buttery tang from the sauce is divine! This was an easy and different way to prepare new potatoes.  The capers gave the dish that extra zing! They were the perfect accompaniment to the tri-tip roast I served for company.

A hundred stars aren't enough.  Use fresh parmesan and the sauce will be creamy and stick to the potatoes.  Also, I used a fingerling mix, which adds to the goodness because they're small and increase the sauce/potato ratio.  The variety of textures in a mix of tiny potatoes also adds to the wonderfulness of this dish.

Liked the capers, but too much butter (too many calories). I think I'll stick with the parsley potatoes & add capers to that recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I added baby spinach to the cooked and drained potatoes and closed the lid on the pot to let it steam. Then I added the yummy sauce. But that was a minor variance...this recipe would shine just as it is!

The capers and the vinegar work super well to counter balance the parmesan.  the choice of potato really is the essential key to this recipe.  I would definently reccommend this!

Delicious. I did cut the potatoes in 1/4 even though they were small.  I used white balsamic instead of white wine vinegar.  Cant wait for the leftovers today (not as much as I would like though)

Fabulous potato dish!  I served this with chicken at a dinner party.  Everyone, including kids, devoured them.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I did not have white wine vinegar.  I subsituted with homemade strawberry wine.  It worked like a charm.  I will definatley be making this again.  Thanks Michelle!

This is a unique and delicious sidedish. Next time we make it we want to reduce the butter and maybe sub a little evoo to make it a little less naughty. :)

Three words.... WOW WOW WOW!!!  I could kick myself for not trying these sooner. It just doesn't get much easier or better than this.  I paired it with marinated grilled pork chops and it was a perfect combination.  Thanks Michelle, YOU ROCK!!!

These are very tasty potatoes with a great tangy butter sauce. You could even add more potatoes and still have enough sauce. Tasted great served with chicken. Thanks for the great recipe.

this is one of the few, truly *perfect* recipes.  these are the best potatoes i have EVER had in my life and i am no spring chicken.  i didn't have white wine vinegar, so i subbed reg. white vinegar.  no harm.  i didn't have new potatoes, so subbed chunked russets, but next time i will go out of my way to purchase new potatoes.  that's how good this recipe is--even with the wrong potatoes which i could tell made a difference--it was still out of this world.  if you ever find yourself entertaining the queen of sheba (or me), make these!

Yummy!  I wanted a potato to go with some Rib-Eyes but not mashed and nothing from the oven (too hot) so these were perfect!  Shockingly I had EVERYTHING I needed without having to go to the store that was a big bonus!  Next time I'll halve the recipe since it's just me and my husband (toddler is very picky) otherwise I'll end up eating too many.

Wow! This is really good! Suprisingly everyone young and old liked it and that included a couple of picky eaters. The tang of the capers was toned down just enough by the "creaminesss" of the potatoes and the parmesean cheese. Adding the mixed sauce to the still hot potatoes really brought out the flavours of the fresh parsley (a must for the best taste) and green onions. We were licking the pot. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Wow! Great change of pace from your average buttered new potatoes. I only made one change, as a previous post using 1/2 the butter. The flavor was plenty rich enough and my husband went back three times for more. Even my 20 month old loved them. I am going to try this recipe with roasted potatoes next time as we like the crunch - but the original recipe will be used often.

This was really good... but, sauce?  It's not a sauce... it is a whole lot of butter with green onions, capers and parm.  It's very yummy... but, I wouldn't call it "saucy".  It's  buttered potatoe's with some other goodies.

12 potatoes for 4 servings?  3 tiny potatoes each?  Maybe the originator used bigger potatoes.  I used three *bags* of tiny new potatoes, way more than 36 for a triple recipe, and the tripled recipe of coating was still a little too much (a lot of melted butter in the bottom of the pan).  But the mixture was super-delicious!  I think in future I'll make the mix, but add as necessary then just chill the remaining coating for future dishes (I bet it would be good on pasta too).

This turned out to be a simple & satisfying side dish. It looks prettier, with the baby potatoes, but the flavor seeps into quartered potatoes better.

Yes I did, it tasted fine.  The photo is very deceptive, the dish looks nothing like it when completed. When you mix the hot potatoes w/the sauce it turns into a mess, the skins come off.  The photo isn't showing the dish with the sauce.  It tastes fine it just doesn't look appealing.

VERY nice with a steamed (or microwaved) white fish filet - basa type.
I used the vinegar of the capers' glass, in order to keep the same flavour.

These potatoes havea a good, capery flavor.  I would make again for a party or large gathering, but not just for myself because I found that a whole batch was too overpowering for multiple meals.  I liked that it had a unique flavor

We thought this was outstanding, it makes a great way to have something akin to mashed potatoes when you won't have gravy as a go-with. 

I will say I couldn't bear to put that much butter in the sauce ... now I can't remember how much I cut back the amount, but probably at least half. Will definitely make again. 

Thank you!

This was fantastic!  I thought my 90 year old dad would lick his dish!  I did not have a lot of parsley on had so I put the entire minced green onion in the mixture instead of just 1 tablespoon.  It worked fine.

They definatley had flavor. I might leave out the capers next time. I really like capers, but I'm not sure they fit well with this.

I didn't use as many potatoes and not as much butter but the rest was by the recipe so mine were a little more on the tart side but I loved em that way. I will be making them again.

This is a wonderful potatoe dish.  I did think there was too much butter for the amount of potatoes and I used extra potatoes for my large family. The next time I make this I will cut back on the butter by at least 1/3 and keep everything else the same.

I usually have to modify recipes because I don't have exactly all the ingredients so its helpful for me to know what modifications work. Here, I used 6 regular potatoes, quartered. The flavored worked well but next time I will use less butter and maybe add some vegetable stock in its place. Also it could have used more capers and green onions but maybe that was because I had too many potatoes. I also followed one reviewers suggestion to omit the white wine vinegar - next time I will add the vinegar since it tasted like it needed a little extra punch. Overall, this has a great combination of flavors, just needs a little tweaking for our tastes.

Fantastic just the way it's written!  I used slightly larger potatoes (what I had) and cut them smaller, no salt at the end, but pepper was good.  Try it!

What a wonderful change from all the other recipes made with red potatoes I have tried. Never had I thought of capers with potatoes, but what a nice blend of flavors. I added more green onions than a tablespoon, since we love onions. I did add a few shakes of garlic powder to the mix. I used larger red potatoes I had on hand, just cutting them into one inch bite sized pieces. I slightly over cooked them since I had unexpected company in the middle of cooking stop by...but they were still wonderful...in fact if you wanted to mash them they'd still be great....since mine were half way in between. Will make this one again.

This was just OK. A little bland, but a different way to fix potatoes. I might add a little cayenne pepper or something to zip it up. Think I have alot more potato recipes in my box that are good to fix this again anytime soon.

Fabulous!!!! Made with teeny tiny little potatoes, but I still cut them in half for maximum absorbsion.  Next time I might add a squirt if lemon juice like someone recommended.  I also like the tip to use this caper sauce on fish.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yum!  I love vinegar and capers, but bf doesn't.  So I halved the recipe and made it tonight when he was eating leftovers that I didn't want.  They are a very different, very flavorful potato dish.  And so easy!  I didn't cut up the potatoes before putting in the water, but cut them up after.  I can only say I decided to halve them halfway through the process.  So lovely, and I didn't really bother to measure the ingredients and it still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good flavor, but was too dry for me.  The next time I use this recipe, I want toss to coat, instead I will layer potatoes, cut in half, then do a layer of caper sauce.  Do layers till all is gone.

Good. I enjoyed the tanginess of the capers and vinegar. I tried to follow recipe exactly but found the quantity of potatoes confusing. It says “12 new potatoes” which to me are the baby ones which would not have been enough. I used a 2 lb bag of baby potatoes and it worked great. Yummy!

Excellent.  I would also suggest cutting potatoes to 1" cubes.I served these with dolphin fillets, and I was worried that they may overpower the delicate flavor of the fish, but they paired wonderfully with the dolphin.

This was just great - very nice change to plain potatoes. I had red wine vinegar instead of white, but the sauce certainly didn't hurt because of it. Will definitely use again - Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it exactly as written, (except I used more green onions than called for because we really love them!) The end result was amazing; delicious and creamy! I served it warm with our dinner, but then I ate some leftovers the next day cold and it was just as wonderful. My only dilemma next time will be whether to have it hot or cold. But I do know for certain that there will be a next time for this one! Fabulous!!!

Family thought this was ok, but not great.  I didn't think there was enough sauce and absorbed into the potatoes. I really loved the taste of the capers with the potatoes, but the fam could have done without it.

Can't believe I didn't rate this recipe when I first tried it!  It is the perfect way to dress up a meal, especially when the main course is not a rich one!  Perfect, Michellej!

My boyfriend and I have a rating system, and he gave this a top score - which he rarely does! He even said, "it would be impossible to make these potatoes any more flavorful!" I didn't change a thing about the recipe, except using dried parsley in place of fresh. The sauce is very tangy and this tastes like something you would order at a restaurant. I served alongside spinach-stuffed chicken breasts and the flavors worked perfectly. Thanks for the keeper!

This was VERY tasty and easy to make.  I forgot the green onion, but don't think that my omission hurt the dish in any way.  I had made double the recipe cuz we were having company, had leftovers, and pan-fried them in a non-stick skillet the next day for some parmesan hash browns.  also VERY tasty.  excellent and easy recipe.  will go into my book

Easy, tasty, great success! Skipped the vinegar, though (I'm not a great fan), and added a little lemon juice instead.

These were a nice unique change of pace for potatoes.  We enjoyed them.  I'm not a big caper fan so I think I would of enjoyed them more without. Remember when seasoning your potatoes that the capers are very salty.

These potatoes were absolutely delicious!  A bit of a splurge considerating all the butter but worth it!  I added a little more green onion than called for (1/4 cup). Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly.  Will definintely make again!

I made this for Sunday lunch for my family.  Even the "picky eaters" commented on how good this was.  My Husband who thinks he is the world's finest food critic was even upset that there were no leftovers.  I served with fish and steamed vegies.  I will definitely make this again.

There was no way I would make this with all the butter and Parmesan, so I tried using lower fat, healthier spread and less of it.  My husband said it was good but I wasn't impressed, which isn't the recipe's fault.  I made it a second time, substituting a combination of low fat mayonaise and drained fat free yogurt for the butter and leaving everything else the same, then chilled it and served as potato salad.  It was delicious, and much healthier.  I'm sure the original recipe would be fantastic made as directed (it's hard to go wrong with butter), but there's no way I'd eat that much fat in a side dish.

These were great.  I used white balsamic vinegar, and did cut the potatoes in half to absorb the flavor.  Everyone loved them.  One more thing, used fresh chives instead of green onions.

Finally tried them last week and now understand what all the fuss has been about!  These were fabulous.  I made a full batch of sauce but only half the potatoes, then froze the remaining sauce so next time I want them (which will be soon) the sauce will already be made. I also suggest cutting the potatoes in half, as the starch did add addiotnal creaminess.  I have to admit I was way skeptical about this at first, I don't care for green onions and am not a huge fan of capers.  But it really was just as good as everyone has described.  Creamy, balanced flavors, kind of upscale comfort food.  Michelle, you are a culinary Goddess!

FANTASTIC! The only thing I changed was i added two small cloves of chopped garlic (I add garlic to almost everything) My boyfriend who could take or leave potatoes said they were wonderful and asked me to keep this recipe without me even asking him how they were first!

I forgot to get capers at the store but wanted to make these so bad...decided to make them without - have never had capers so didn' know what I was missing.  Then I probably shouldn't even give these potatoes a review, but want you all to know how great they are even without the capers.  Only reason I gave it four stars is the amount of butter in the bottom of the dish...I will take Mattsbelly's suggestion and decrease the butter next time and they will be just as great, I'm sure.

I guess this is going to be a 4 1/2 star for us.  My husband gave it a 4 and I thought it was a 5.  I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I ended up using balsamic, otherwise followed the recipe.  This was very good, and we will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe Michelle!

Wonderful, the flavors blend well together.  I had to make my self stop eating them.  I made one change as I didn't have green onions, so I used dried shallots and it was still great.  Thanks Michelle great recipe.

This turned out just super! Served it to group of six women who all raved about it. I don’t care for green onions so I literally went out in my yard and cut the wild chives growing there. Their milder flavor was exactly right.

Great as is, but I’ve also used kalamata olives instead of capers and it was great as well. And I always cut the potatoes at least in half.

Yum!  I've made this several times. Always a hit with guests.  The only change I've made was using less butter.  I like the idea of using fresh lemon instead of vinegar.  I'll try that next time.

These are good, but mine didn't turn out very pretty.  It was hard for me to "gently toss" the butter mixture into the potatoes and still get it evenly distributed without mashing the potatoes.   Perhaps I overcooked them, although I only boiled for 15 minutes and they still felt firm.  Taste was good though and I actually liked the flavor of the mashed up bites better!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Outstanding! Fantastic flavor. So simple but big flavor. Please use the capers. They just add that something flavor that most people cannot guess. I did not have white wine vinegar so I added a splash of white vinegar and a splash of white wine. You could serve these with almost any protein.

No changes needed.  My husband raved about this.  I have made it several times now and only ever substituted green onion with a little white onion, if I don't have it available.    I am now considering roasting them afterwards.  I did this with a Jamie Oliver recipe which was boiled potatoes with feta, lemon, chili and fresh coriander.  They worked really well.  I add the fresh herbs in afterwards.

I added fresh garlic and I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used tarragon white vinegar which added a very nice flavor.

WE loved these - I need to make them again.  They had a unique flavor and although I don't always like capers, this dish had the right amount of balance so they didnt overpower the dish.

My hubby and I loved this tonight, I added asparagus, thin sliced mushrooms, zucchini,  onion and red pepper to the peppers, omitted the green onion & parmesan because I didn't have any but put a 1/3 of a cup white cheddar in instead. Served it with blackened black bean patties and oh boy is this a keeper!! Yum!! Thanks so much Michelle for posting this awesome recipe!

Awesome; 5 stars is not enough!  My husband and I loved this recipe.   Winning recipe!  Thanks for posting.  I think this recipe would have been good without any modifications too!  I took advice from other reviewers and quartered the new potatoes, did not use additional vinegar (there was a little from the capers), used chives in lieu of green onions, used a little lemon juice and used half butter and half olive oil (next time I will only use olive oil).  I also simmered the sauce with the shaved parm before I tossed it with the potatoes.  There is lots of room for flexibility.  I think this would be awesome finished off in the broiler too.

Oh, so, good! What a great array of flavors that blend so nicely to make plain potatoes the star of the plate. This will be a nice side to have easily available for company or a weeknight. I made a larger batch of the butter, caper, cheese mash to have available a couple nights later with the rest of the potatoes. Very nice recipe, thank you!

Loved it!  Will certainly make it again.  The day of my dinner party I could not find any new potatoes so I had to improvise.  I used sweet potato, yams and Yukon Gold potatoes cut into big chunks. I also halved the amount of butter.  Was a great hit with my guests.  No leftovers to try the next day!

We didn't enjoy this recipe at all.  It was definitely missing something.  At a minimum, I would make the salt and pepper mandatory (and a lot of it).

These had a wonderful flavor, I didn't change a thing. My husband made the comment that they were a burst of flavor in your mouth. A nice twist on doing potatoes different. I made them as a side dish with the Ranch Rosemary chicken kabobs. Very good!!! I will be making these again.

This was really good. Unfortunatley I didnt realize we were out of butter so I used olive oil instead. I added enough olive oil just for "wetness", just enough to coat and help mix things up. It's very easy and quick to make and great for company or potlucks not just for home meals. Everyone will love you and will ask for your recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Way too much butter. Not exciting but a change from ordinary. I wouldn't add the extra vinegar since the capers already have a vinegar taste. I think next time I'm going to try just a tad of butter, fresh parsley and Parmesan cheese and omit the capers and vinegar.

Love these!!  I quartered the potatoes and let them cook an extra minute or two, so when I mixed them with the sauce, I got just a little mash. My BF was ultra-impressed.

I think I cooked too many potatoes because there really wasn't much sauce in the bottom of the bowl ... however, the flavor was great ... I'll be making this again and cutting back on the amount of taters.  I added more green onions because we love them but kept everything else the same.  Thanks for a great new twist on ordinary taters.

Very good.  I like capers apparently, because I added more.  This is a nice side dish, especially if you are only serving one side with some steak or chicken.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I made far too much for the number of people at dinner tonight. People had seconds and thirds. It was absolutely the best potato dish I have ever had. Hands down. The sauce will cover more potatoes than the recipe calls for if you want to make a bigger batch of potatoes. We had a pool of sauce left at the bottom of the bowl.

Very good and very easy!!  I followed the recipe to a T and was very happy with the way it turned out.  I would feel comfortable making this as a side dish for guests.

This is a great side dish and is really easy to make.  I've made it a couple times and once I didn't have the green onions or the parsely but it was still great.

Wow.  I am not sure I expected it to be as good as it was.  I was hopeful with all the great ratings...and now I am one of them.  I made this for a big group and I did not adjust the serving size for the recipe when I printed it out...so I had to do it on my own with the copy that I had with me since I was not able to access the computer.  It was fantastic.  I will make this again and again.  It also was excellent the next day (we had a little left over) at room temp.  It reminded me of a potato salad.  But with our grilled steak this was fantastic warm.  This is a nice change from your average potato dish.  As far as the amount of butter....go for it.  Unless you eat like that every day, a little every once in a while is a delicious treat!!!

Very easy recipe resulting in an extraordinary potatoe.  I made this recipe for a meal of 40 people (50th anniversary meal), I used measurements for 50 servings,used a slight amount of extra parmesan because it was already grated.  We had several people ask for the recipe and many more compliment on the potatoes - there were more compliments on the potatoes then the prime rib that was also served.  Only drawback was due to such a big pot of potatoes it was somewhat difficult to coat and some of the potatoes turned into almost mashed. (this is only because some of the potatoes were cut in half/quarters, whole potato would not have that problem)  Leftover potatoes were very good the next morning as fried potatoes.

These are great.  I love capers and never thought about paring with potatoes, it was excellent.  I did not add any vinegar b/c I was out and the capers were in a vinegar brine, so I used a little of that. Will be making these as a side for many dinners.

I made this tonight with our steaks and steamed broccoli.  I got a "very good" from the family.  I like it too.  I didn't have the full amount of capers, and no green onions.  I subbed about 1 TB of finely chopped red onion.  I will make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed these potatoes.  I made them with pork tenderloin and a salad.  What great flavors.  Will make these often.

I LOVE capers and my boyfriend doesn't like them.  I made this anyways and we BOTH loved it.  I could literally live on this but I'd probably die quite quickly.  I wish I could eat this all the time.  This is a treat that I'll look forward to.  100+ stars for taste, and simple ingredients.

I love this recipe! I haven't had much exposure to capers and wasn't sure if I would like them in potatoes, they were awesome! I found them very easy to make, I used fingerling potaoes cut into halves. Thanks Michelle, can't wait to make these again!

This was unlike anything I have ever had before. It was really good. It has a nice fresh taste to it.  I made it with store bought potatoes but can hardly wait for my homegrown new potatoes to be ready! My husband would not eat it after asking what the little round things were (capers).  I tried to explain he could pick around them but he refused.

This is awesome.  I was leary about all that butter, but it wasn't "greasy" at all.  I like capers and I am glad this recipe was shared.  Thanks.
