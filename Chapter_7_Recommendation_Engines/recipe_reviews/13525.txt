This was the best turkey i had ever made. I added fresh italian seasoning that it asked for instead of dried, such as marjoram, thyme, oregano, etc.  I did not add sage since it overpowers foods and so does the rosemary so you have to choose one.  When i cooked the turkey i cooked it breast side down..that is the best secret to having a moist delicous turkey..also cover with foil, if you are not stuffing the turkey throw some rosemary sprigs inside the cavity with whatever vegetables you may choose as well.  The last 45 min. to an hour take the foil off and turn the turkey breast side up so it can brown.

This rub recipe is wonderful, and it made excellent gravy.  In preperation I used a brine that I think matched well with the rub.  Soak the turkey overnight in the following: Fresh rosemary, basil, peppercorns, juice of 2 lemons and 2 oranges; and for each gallon of water needed to cover the bird, add 1 cup kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar.  Rinse before rubbing.  Even microwaved leftovers were moist!

The family really enjoyed this recipe - even the picky eaters claimed this was the best turkey they had ever tried.

Count me in on the side of the briners - the previous reviewers suggest brining the turkey the night before; this really helped keep the turkey moist. 

Brine Recipe:

1 cup lemon juice
1 cup orange juice
For each gallon of water needed to cover the bird, add 1 cup kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar.
A couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary and fresh basil
1 cup of peppercorns

Just be sure to keep the turkey cool while the brine is working away to lock in the flavor. I double bagged the turkey and placed it in a large cooler surrounded with ice. 

Give the skin a chance to become crispy by taking the turkey out of the brine 2 hours before cooking, patting the turkey dry and allowing it to sit in the fridge.

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but last night was the first time I ever cooked a turkey.  I used softened butter instead of olive oil, and mixed the butter with sage, rosemary, and thyme.  I loosened the skin from the breast and smeared the savory butter all over the breast meat under the skin.  This made for the most delicious and moist turkey we have ever eaten in our lives.  Fabulous!

It was definitely a weird experience putting the spices between the skin and body of the turkey but it worked really easily because I used long yellow plastic gloves.  Yes, I was a sight to behold with apron and long yellow gloves but it got the job done!  I mixed the fresh spices in a salad dressing jar the night before and shook it well to allow the flavors to work into the oil.  That also saved prep time on roasting day and allowed the flavored oil to be easily poured where it was to go.  I started the roast breast side down and tented it with aluminum foil after it browned nicely.  After 2 hours I turned it breast side up and tented it after it browned.  Earlier I pulled the wings away from the body to ensure the area under them browned as well.  I used the oven probe the last hour or two (of slightly more than 4 hours for the 15 pounder) and it was perfect color and moistness at 180 degrees.

I have made this turkey 4 years in a row.  My husband and I only made a few changes.  First, we cover for 2 hours then cook uncovered the last 2.  We also double the ingredients and place under the skin, on top and in the cavity.  This adds a nice rosemary flavor to the stuffing.

I put the spices and the olive oil together the night before and let the oil soak up all the flavor.  All I did on Thanksgiving Day was rub it all over the turkey - inside and out - and place the turkey in a "turkey" baking bag for 3 hours.  It was great!!

There's nothing a dead turkey likes better than a nice warm bath and a good oil massage. I added more spices to my mixture and found it surprisingly easy to spread the butter under the skin. I was so afraid I was going to break it, but it worked out fine. I had a lot of the mixture left, so I used it inside the cavity and on top of the skin also. I roasted on 500 for about thirty minutes and then flipped the bird and reduced the heat for the rest of the cooking time. The meat was juicey and delicately infused with all the wonderful herbs and seasonings. Very good Star! Bro came thru with flying colors!!!!:)

I thought this was average at best.  I made this w/a whole chicken.  I think the water is what ruined it.  The skin on the chicken remained soft.  Not sure if I'll make this again.

Great bird. Made 1 change and 2 additions. Instead of 3/4 cups of oil.   Change = 1/2 cup softened butter & 1/4 cup oil mixture to the herbs.   Additions = added 6 uncooked strips of bacon to the top the bird before putting it in the oven. This method self-bastes the bird and also adds some GREAT flavor to the drippings for gravy.  Chopped all of the following in quarters and added to the cavity of the turkey. 1 celery stalk. 1 whole carrot, 1 med onion, 1 small apple, 1 bunch of fresh parsely. Put a piece of tin foil over the cavity to keep the items from coming out.   The combination of the additions along with the herbs and butter made for a MOIST bird and great gravy drippings.

I love this recipe, i have used it for a few years now and still love it. To keep it extra moist and half the cooking time i place the already seasoned turkey in an oven roasting bag and seal it with the twist tie thingy. MMMM

Every year for Thanksgiving my Father roasts the turkey and this past year for Thanksgiving I was brave enough to take on the challenge.  This Rosemary Turkey recipe was by far the best turkey that my family has ever tasted.  I was praised for a job well done and asked to do the turkey again for Christmas that same year.  The turkey was perfectly cooked, moist, tender, extremely flavorful.  Before making this turkey I researched/read many of the reviews and I decided to put my 12-lb. turkey in a 2 1/2 day brine.  The brine consisted of freshly juiced lemons and oranges, peppercorn, freshly chopped basil and rosemary, brown sugar, salt, and water.  Thanksgiving day I rubbed the olive oil mixture that I made the night before all over the turkey and under the turkey skin.  Then, I stuffed it with 2 halved lemons and onions, 8 cloves of pounded garlic, and four sprigs of rosemary.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe to anyone who is cooking turkey for the first time!  It was such a great recipe!  It's perfect for whole chickens tOo!  I can't wait till next Thanksgiving!

Welcome to my new turkey recipe!  This is it, I think, for the rest of my life.  It's so fresh, and makes GREAT gravy.  One added thing I always do....use carrots and leeks instead of a rack for the turkey - then, when you go to make the gravy, make sure you push the carrots and leeks through a sieve to add all that goodness into the pot.  It's really the best possible gravy you could ever have!

I made this today for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!!! I may try making it in a bag next time. We had a 16 lb bird and it finished cooking in 4 hours. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. The flavor was excellent.

OMG!!! Not my first turkey but absolutely my best, most flavorful, moist turkey ever. Reading the reviews first were great. 1) buy a small bottle of olive oil take off the spout and add springs of fresh herbs. I used rosemary, thyme, sage leaves and one clove of garlic sliced. Return spout to bottle and refrigerate a few days prior to making turkey. Note: use whatever herbs you like. 2) took the advice to use carrots and leeks to roast the turkey on. Great tasting will try in gravy but didn't this time. 3) Roasted breast side down first for an hour, then turned turkey breast side up to complete last two hours. 4) Use a foil tent over turkey. 5) stuff cavity with more fresh herbs, an onion wedge, a sliced clove of garlic and rind of a juiced lemon, and splash in some of your flavored oil. WOW! The compliments kept coming.

As a graduate from the Johnson & Wales University Culinary Degree program, I am always looking for new recipes to try out, and utilize for work. This turkey recipe is by far the best I have tried!! I did a dry run of it this past Sunday before Thanksgiving, and even the pickiest eater LOVED it!!! The only changes that I made to the recipe, was I brined it overnight, and added wine to the chicken stock... the gravy that comes from this turkey is also the best gravy I have ever made :)

This is first-rate.  We've been using this recipe for nearly two years, and my boyfriend won't have roast turkey any other way.  I don't usually have fresh rosemary or fresh basil, but the dried versions work fine.  I do the rub the day before cooking the turkey, letting the turkey sit in a closed, plastic bag in the refrigerator.  Also, I like to use a small, wide-mouthed jar with a good lid for blending the rub ingredients, so that I can shake it up from time to time to keep it well mixed.  I probably use about a half-cup olive oil instead of three-quarters, and there's always plenty.  In fact, after I rub under the skin, inside the cavity, and inside the crop, I put the remainder on the outside of the turkey just before roasting.  I like to baste the bird, which I do every half hour, but not until it has been in the oven for the first hour, so as not to disturb the rub on the outside.  Overall, a really wonderful recipe.

We bought a fresh turkey and used this rub - only I used 1 tablespoon of dried rosemary and 1 tablespoon of dried basil and cut the garlic to 2 Tablespoons.  we also stuffed the turkey with sausage and sage stuffing.  It was the best turkey we have ever had.

This was perfect! I used a bone-in turkey breast. Prepared this exactly as written. The juices just ran out of the meat and even two days later when we are finishing it up in sandwiches it is still moist and delicious. The whole family raved about it.

My new favorite turkey recipe!!  So moist and flavorful.  I usually cook my turkey breast down so that it is extra moist but I didn't find it necessary with this recipe.  I also put several pats of butter under the skin with the rosemary mixture.  Filled the bottom of the pan with chicken broth instead of water.  I threw a couple of sprigs of rosemary in the cavity of the turkey and in the broth in the bottom of the pan.  It is important to use fresh rosemary & basil.  Covered with foil & basted with the juice in the bottom of the pan every hour. Removed foil the last 30-40 minutes so that the turkey could brown.  After removing the turkey from the over, cover tightly with foil (usually throw a few towels over the foil to keep the heat in) and let sit for 30 minutes before carving so juices can redistribute.

I marinated my turkey overnight in the seasonings, added a few pats of butter under the skin as well, and voila!!!  I got so many compliments.  Even my non-turkey eaters enjoyed this!  This was my first time to roast a turkey and it turned out great!!!  Definitely a new family tradition!

Apparently I forgot to review this after making it for Thanksgiving! This was the first time I have ever cooked a turkey, and it was also the best one I've ever tasted. My parents and siblings all agreed that they've never had a better Thanksgiving dinner. Tip: definitely brine the turkey overnight. I did in a saltwater solution with some extra fresh rosemary and a lemon. It made is sooo juicy and worked wonderfully with these ingredients.

I've made this turkey twice.  The first time exact to the recipe and found that I was right in my first thoughts that a turkey should always be brined.  The brine consisted of 1/2 cup of kosher salt per gal of water and threw in some fresh basil and rosemary and several crushed cloves of garlic.  I let soak in the brine overnight.  I also tripled the herbs and garlic used melted butter instead of olive oil the second time and rubbed inside the cavity, under and on the skin.  used an electronic thermometer and cooked to 175 degrees and let it sit till temp came up to 185 degrees.  This way never any mistakes about under or overcooking and works no matter the size of the turkey. everyone said it was the best turkey they ever had and begged for the recipe.  think it will also work well without the herbs and garlic in the brine since rub in the cavity and under and on the skin, will try that next time I make this turkey.  Remember, for the moistest turkey, "ALWAYS BRINE!!!!"

This will be a repeat performer at our house last year.  Last year was my first year making Thanksgiving dinner for my family, but with this recipe, I came out looking like a pro and basked in the limelight.  The olive oil makes the breast nice and moist, and the rosemary and other spices are infused throughout the meat.  I actually rubbed the oil and spices under the skin THE NIGHT BEFORE COOKING, and that worked very well in terms of getting those flavors well saturated into the bird.  It truly turned out great.

This is exactly how I cook my turkey, with one major exception. You should first seal the bird at 475 (no type, 475!) degrees for 20 minutes. This is a trick that helps keep the bird juicy! Then lower the temperature to 250 degrees and cook it for an additional 20 minutes per pound. It seems crazy, but you won't regret it! Don't do this for turkeys over 15 pounds :-) I also add sliced onions and oranges to the roasting pan, a few inside the turkey. This keeps everything moist. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

Excellent.  I had it in the oven for longer than 4 hours.  I left the temperature for 3 hours as recommended then alternated between 200-250 F for a few hours extra as I had put it in the oven a bit early in the day.  Meat was moist and very flavorful.  Also I used fresh rosemary but dried basil and it still came out great.  Whole family loved it.  A+

This was by far the best turkey recipe I have ever made. I used a Turkey breast for Christmas Eve dinner and the smell while it was cooking was awesome - and the taste even better. This recipe will replace my mother's long-time Thanksgiving turkey recipe for my family. Sorry Mom.

This recipe is a keeper!  Made it for our Thanksgiving dinner, used a 7 1/4 lb. turkey breast, and put it on top of a red delious apple on the rack of our Nesco roaster.  Only baked it for a little over 2 hours.  And it was so tender and juicy-the meat literally fell off of the bones!  Thanks, Star, for sharing this recipe!  :O)

I've tried several methods for roasting turkey over the years (cooking bags, rubbing with butter or oil, using different herbs and seasonings) but this was by far the best.  My search for the perfect Thanksgiving turkey recipe is over.  Everyone at the table loved it.  Thank you!

This looks great. Can't wait to try it. I have one question though.  In the past I've used rosemary in pork and lamb by inserting it into little holes made with a knife. I wonder if this insertion method would work with turkey. I've never heard mention of it. Any ideas?

This is a fabulous recipe.  I'm a fan of brining the turkey first, but if you do that, eliminate the salt from the recipe.  I also butterflied the turkey, so I could bake it at 425 for only one hour.  It was so moist and flavorful.  My family raved about it and asked if we had leftovers for tomorrow!  Thanks for my new Thanksgiving turkey recipe!

My family loved this turkey!!  The fresh rosemary and basil gave it a nice flavour.  I also rubbed some butter on the outside of the bird in addition to the olive oil mixture to make it more moist.

An AMAZING recipe!  I used this recipe to make my thanksgiving turkey and it was excellent.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the brine recipe posted by Whirlleybird in a review for this recipe and I highly recommend it.  The turkey was very moist and flavorful.                                I used the herb rub inside the cavity, then I filled it with stuffing.  It gave the stuffing a lovely flavor, and the brine kept the turkey moist even though it was stuffed.  You have to at least give this recipe a try! :)

I made this for Thanksgiving-and my first turkey.  It came out great.  I roasted it in an oven bag for 3 hours (16 lb bird) and the meat was just falling off the bone.  Delicious!

All 20 people at Easter dinner agreed- I am now in charge of making the Thanksgiving and Easter turkey! This was the best turkey I have ever tasted! I had a 15 lb bird and it took less than 4 hours to cook on the instructed temperature. , so just keep an eye on it and don't overcook.

I used this recipes for Turkey Drumstick so I divided everything by 4.  I rubbed the bird with marinated mixture, then put them in the zip lock bag and put away in the fridge for over night. If you don't have the Roaster Pan, you can put the water in the casserole baking sheet, then put the baking rack on top to bake it. Bake at 375F for 40min, then turn another side and continue baking for 15 min more.  They turned out so good.  The skin is golden brown & very crispy.  The meat is so moist.  My family love them even my picky in law :0)

Wonderful! I added fresh lemon thyme to the fresh herb mix and used half butter half oil. I basted with a mix of chicken stock and melted butter. I put some onions and chicken stock in bottom of roaster, not water. I covered for all but last hour to brown the bird. I used the drippings for gravy and added a tablespoon of dry port to gravy and it was great.

I used just a turkey breast because it's just me and hubby.  I brined it overnight.  The breast was the most juicy and flavorful I've ever had.  Good-bye to dry, tasteless turkey breast!

As many people here have done, make minor adjustments to spices and herbs to suit your taste. I also use butter and oil.  The key to happiness for me, esp with a turkey in this size range, is to use a roasting bag.  I'm a traditionalist, but now that I've tried a bag will never go back to pan.  Yes, the turkey will get brown!

I used this wonderful recipe on my first ever turkey and it turned out marvelous!  People could not believe it was my first.  One thing I did add was adding some butter underneath the skin of the breast and legs to make sure it was juicy.  I also cooked it in a baking bag which made it very juicy also.

Thank you Star Pooley!  Absolutely Outstanding!  A little messy in making, but definitely worth it!  Used a turkey breast instead of the whole turkey, then stuffed the cavity with dressing.  Everyone was impressed with my wonderful tasting, moist turkey at Thanksgiving!  Tip:  Let the turkey stand at room temp for about a half hour before starting.

I made this tonight with turkey thighs and it was divine. I loved it. It was so moist and delicious. The meat was falling off the bone when I was trying to get it out of the baking dish. I added a little more garlic, and some onion powder. Baked it in the oven with tin foil over it and took the foil off when it was almost done to let the top brown up.

Fabulous, I left out the salt (So much other flavor you don't need it!)  Increased minced garlic.  I have used it on cornish hens as well.  Enjoy!!

Easy to make and it was delicous. The gravy I made out of the juices was fantastic. The spices did wash off easy during basting though.

This is a great recipe...I used it for the holidays and everyone absolutely loved it. It smells sooo good and makes the turkey so juicy and full of flavor. At first i thought the garlic might be to much but its the perfect amount for a huge turkey!!

I made this last year and doing it again this year. The flavor of this is awesome! Last year on this site there was also a stuffing recipe with this and I can't find it! If someone can help that would be great!

This recipe is a staple in my kitchen, I've been making it for years with success every time. You can substitute the herbs for whatever you prefer too - tonight I made it with fresh oregano instead of rosemary - delicious! I also add some chopped onions and garlic to the cavity to infuse even more flavour and aroma.

I decided to use this recipie on a Thanksgiving chicken and WOW!!!! 
The only thing that I changed is that I combined the herb mixture with
some butter and smeared that on and under the skin 2 days prior to
Thanksgiving.  Talk about moist and tender!!

This recipe was a success at my house.  The only thing I did different was put the turkey in a cooking bag and added some chicken broth and let the turkey rock.  My husband was amazed at when the turkey was done and he was ready to carve it, it just peeled right of the carcas.  Thanks so much for sharing.  The clean-up was really easy too.

I put the spices and the olive oil together the night before and let the oil soak up all the flavor. All I did on Thanksgiving Day was rub it all over the turkey - inside and out - and place the turkey in a "turkey" baking bag for 3 hours. It was great!!

I LOVE this recipe! Have been using for about 8 years now and everyone always raves about my turkey! I put all the seasonings called for and cook it in a turkey bag and so moist and full of flavor! Also the drippings make an excellent gravy to go along with it!

Amazing. That was my first time making a turkey, I almost gagged sticking my hand in it, but it was worth it. Of course, I didn't have any Italian seasoning, so I just used McCormick roasting rub savory herb cuz it tastes great on everything else and well, yeah. It was great. Everyone else loved it too :)

Flavour was great however next time I certainly will not use the full of amount of olive oil - I'll use 1/4 cup of it and the rest broth.

This was the first turkey I ever made and it was the BEST turkey I've ever eaten! Totally moist and flavorful. The only change I made was cooking it under foil for 2 hrs, taking it out and lightly brushing it in a little more olive oil, then cooking uncovered the rest of the time. It was delicious!!

Amazing! One thing I suggest though, I used chicken stock instead of water. Added just a little bit more flavor without overpowering the garlic/rosemary taste... absolutely perfect!

Made a fantastic turkey for Thanksgiving; very moist and flavourful. Also used this as a marinade for lamb shoulder (let it sit for a few days wrapped up in foil), and it turned out excellent!

The seasoning was perfect, but you don't need anywhere close to 3/4 cup of olive oil.  I baked this in a bag breast down for 3 hours (25 lb turkey) and then turned over breast up for another hour.  It came out very tender and juicy.  The herbs and garlic really made this bird extra special.  I'll be using this recipe again next time.

Holy cow!!! I made this recipe three years ago for Thanksgiving and people are STILL talking about it. I made it for @ 13 people and they ALL said it was the best turkey they have ever eaten. I use melted butter instead of olive oil (I prefer the taste) and it turns out moist and juicy, and full of flavor every time. This recipe is a tradition now and every year people beg me to make this for them, and it's so easy! this is one of the best recipies I've ever used! Try it, you won't be sorry.

This was such a tasty, moist turkey. You have to like Rosemary as it is a strong herb. My husband thought is was super and I have made small 10 pound turkeys throughout the year using this recipe. With a little Dijon mustard and mayo, they make great sandwhiches.

This was fine if you like turkey that's pretending to be red meat. I will personally go with parsley, sage and thyme next time. My hubby said, "It just doesn't taste very turkey-y."

Yum!  Used all the fresh herbs ~ sage, rosemary & thyme.  Cut up a onion, some celery stalk, a carrot and wedged a fresh lemon.  Put all that on the inside cavity and on the bottom.  The white meat had super flavor and was so moist.  Family declared this the best turkey I have every made!  Lovely!

I have a partial-convection oven, so I used that feature, which cooks the outside first and keeps the juices in.  It also cooks the turkey a bit quicker.  The turkey turned out extremely tender and juicy this way, and the blend of herbs sent a wonderful aroma throughout the house while it cooked!  I wouldn't change a thing with the ingredients - very tasty!

I tried this for Christmas.  I used large chicked breasts and they were so moist.  My mother loved it.  She commented that the house smelled so good.  This one is a keeper.

The rosemary is a wonderful herb to use like this. Unlike the one review that I read that said it was overpowering,I disagree.I did though omit the Italian seasonig,and just used rosemary,basil & garlic. I did not put the herbs in oil either & just made a dry rub..then rubbed the turkey well with the oil & sprinkled some salt in & on the turkey .

Instead of water use chicken stock, also roast turkey on the bed of onions-it makes an amazing gravy.

I used this recipe last year for Thanksgiving, and it was the best turkey I'd ever had in my life. I used a bit more garlic than called for, but it made the turkey even better. I plan on using this recipe again this year and for many years to come.

This turkey was delicious! The flavor made it through the entire bird, even into the dark meat. I was a little nervous I'd end up with an italian turkey, but it really just tasted like your typical turkey bumped up like 10 notches! It made for yummy gravy too. The garlic was not overpowering whatsoever (as other reviewers had said) and the idea of putting the mixture between the skin and the breast seems indimidating, but well worth it. Save some of the oil mixture and continue to put it on the turkey as it cooks for extra moisture and flavor.

Good Eats!  I have never made a whole turkey (but the free frozen one from last holiday season needed t meet the oven).  I used the turkey brine recipe from this site, and then I rubbed this on top of the skin just before roasting in the oven since my turkey was not into seperating skin from breast meat.  The whole turkey making process is involved, but defiately tasty!

I was searching for some great Christmas dinner recipes when I remembered making this last year.  This was the first turkey I ever made and it came out DELICIOUS.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  My husband and our friends couldn’t stop eating and giving compliments.  I made it with the “Pineapple Stuffing” by Nancy Healy from this site; the flavours complimented each other beautifully.  I will definitely make it again and again!

I'll never make a plain turkey again.  This makes an incredible gravy too.  I used butter instead of oil.. hubby's preference.. but I am sure, oil would be terrific too.  I use the same marinade on roasted chicken too with great results.

I made this recipe on Christmas and everyone raved about it!  They said it was the best turkey they ever had in their life.  I brined the turkey the night before for about 4 hours in a garbage bag with 1c Koser Salt and a gallon of water.  I added some basil and rosemary to that. In the morning, I did the rub and had no problems getting the skin back - you just have to be careful.  I cooked it breast side down covered in foil.  The last 45 minutes I took the foil off and turned the turkey over and voila!  Got rave reviews from everyone!

This one is a keeper.  I received rave reviews from the family with this one.  The turkey comes out moist and taste delicious.  My only recomendation is to cover the turkey with aluminum until the last 45 minutes of cooking.  The olive oil made it brown to quickly the 1st time I made it.  This is the only recipe for turkey I've tried that the turkey comes out of the oven looking like a picture in a magazine.  It makes a beautiful Thanksgiving table.

This recipe really is amazing. Unfortunately I couldn't get fresh herbs so i used dried rosemary and dried basil instead. I let is sit in the oil and garlic overnight to infuse and the next morning it smelled superb! I stuffed the herbs in between the meat and the skin all the way to the drumsticks of the turkey. I followed some other tips like baking it with the breast side down and then turning it over for the last 40 mins and letting it stand for 30 mins after removing from the oven. It came out really moist and aromatic. Simply delicious! Was so good there was hardly any leftovers. thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is the best way to make a turkey, I also mixed up the oil the night before,then spread it on the bird about hour before cooking,also added about 12 tabs of butter under the skin. When it came out of the oven the temp was over 180 so I thought it might be dry,cause it was in alittle too long, but it wasn't, the white meat was really moist. My son (who doesn't white meat) said it was the best white meat he has ever had.
I will do this Every time I made a bird.

Great recipe! Two Thanksgivings in a row I have done this recipe for a turkey rub. I rub it on the meat of the turkey by carefully going underneath the skin. I use my finger to loosen it from the meat. I massage it into the turkey then I rub it all over the outside. Then I take a stick of butter and cut it into about 10 pats and slip the pats of butter underneath the skin. This is the juciest, best turkey! Thanks!

It was perfect!!!!!! Best turkey ever! I made a 19.2lbs one so I used this times by 1/2. I roasted it in a roasting pan covered with foil from 9am to 1:30pm than 1:30 to 3pm I roasted it uncovered to brown more. It sat out covered in foil for 2 hours and was hot enough to serve at 5pm for dinner! Everyone said it was the best turkey they've ever had. It was moist and PERFECT! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!

Delicious!  My husband said, "No more searching for the perfect turkey recipe -- this is the one!"  The turkey was juicy and flavorful and the gravy was outstanding.  I wasn't sure about the flavor of the olive oil, so I used 1/4 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup olive oil in flavoring the bird.  Then I stuffed the bird with the apple and veggies suggested by Jason "the cook" Stevens, which gave the gravy even more flavor.  I thought about brining the bird beforehand (as I've done in previous years), but didn't bother and it didn't really matter.  This is a terrific recipe!

Fabulous! This was my very first turkey, and I am shocked how great it was. (Don't tell my mom, but it was better than her's, and she's been cooking up Thanksgiving Turkey for years!). I did follow the advice of other reviews and brined my turkey for about 13 hours (24 is supposed to be better, but we didn't have the time) in the juice of two lemons and oranges, plus 1 cup of kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar for every gallon of water it took to cover the bird, along w/ some fresh rosemary and pepper.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to soak the spices in the olive oil over night before greasing the turkey. I did use 2 bottles of white wine (some sav blanc 2 buck chuck from Trader Joes) instead of water. I also had to use dry basil instead of fresh because the (four) grocery stores I went to were out of fresh basil, and my brown thumb can't grow it at home. Other than the brining prep work, wine instead of water, and dry instead of fresh basil, I stayed true to the recipe. I have heard that if you cook the turkey breast side down first and then flip it later you get a moister turkey, but I just cooked my breast side up the whole way and tented some tin foil over the turkey when it was sufficiently brown (between 1-2 hours of baking). We also stuffed the turkey w/ stuffing from Harris Teeter's (NC grocery store) La Brea bakery. We ended up having a delicious 16 lb turkey for Christmas that our friends are still raving about! Thanks for sharing!

I used the Citrus Brine on this site and then the rosemary, garlic and such from this recipe.  I stuffed the cavity with orange wedges, onion and a large branch of fresh rosemary. I used a turkey roasting bag. Fantastic!

This was only the second time I have ever made Turkey and this came out just perfect! It was flavorful, moist with crispy skin. My toughest critics all gave it great reviews. The only change I made was stuffing the cavity of the bird with 1 1/2 lemons, fresh rosemary sprigs and some unpeeled garlic cloves. These also were put on the plate for beautiful presentation. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe a few years ago, and it was wonderful! There were NO leftovers. After experimenting with other flavor profiles, I've realized this is the keeper for my family. I bought an extra large bird this year so we can enjoy it for days. : )

I've been using this recipe probably for the past 8 years on turkey and chicken. It always comes out delish! With the turkey, I do start it breast side down for the juiciest breast meat ever! Great recipe

Absolutely wonderful for even just a half turkey breast!  Homegrown rosemary and basil just put this recipe at the top!
Thank you!

Very good! I had a 16 lb turkey, and it cooked a little faster than what it said in the directions, so it was a little dry...But that's my fault. The seasonings were great!

This turkey turned out excellent!  I did brine it the night before as per many of your suggestions.  I'm glad I did because I used some leftover to make a turkey stew and the meat was still tender!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was amazing! The only suggestions I have is to add a little season/salt to the bird for taste.  Otherwise, it was wonderful!

This turned out to be the most delicious turkey I've ever made.  I was a bit worried that the flavors would be overpowering from putting the herbs directly on the meat, but boy was I wrong.  This method actually infused the meat perfectly with the blend of rosemary, basil and garlic.  It stayed perfectly moist and was delicious warmed up the next day.  This will definitely be the only way I make turkey from now on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have made this turkey recipe every year for the past five years and it is a hit every single time.  My Uncle .. the man who is convinced that I can't cook anything .. says that it is the best turkey he has ever had.  I do cook the turkey in a baking bag, other than that I follow the recipe.  It is the best!

By far one of the best turkeys I have ever had.  I brined my turkey with the ingredients and then roasted with another batch of the ingredients.  I also roasted the bird upside down so that the white meat didn't dry out.  My family 1year later is still talking about it.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  It was my first turkey and I was determined to do it right - no dried out turkey for my family!  I brined the turkey for about 14 hours and then followed these instructions to season it, although I altered the rosemary mixture a little bit.  I poured 2 cups of chicken broth into the bottom of the roasting pan (rather than a 1/4 inch of water).  I basted the turkey every 30 minutes or so during cooking and added water a few times.  Everyone agreed that the turkey was really moist and flavorful.  This is the only turkey recipe I'll ever need.

Not bad. I didn't use a whole bird, just a breast. Didn't have minced garlic, so I used a bit of garlic powder. I couldn't get the lid on my roasting pan, so I used the tented foil & took other reviewers' advice, using stock instead of water. Bird came out extremely moist. Pan drippings made great gravy.

My first time cooking a turkey and it turned out wonderful! This makes a fantastic Thanksgiving feast. I didn't have a rack so my turkey just sat in the pan, but it was still fantastic! I also covered the whole pan with foil to keep the moisture in and added oil/spices as I checked on it while it was cooking. Great leftovers!

It was amazing!  Every one said that it was the best turkey they had ever had.  I handed out the recipe because people wanted to make it at home for sandwiches.  It was BY FAR the best thing I have eaten all year and will never cook a turkey any other way.  It was so moist and falvorfull, I am craving it right now!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my Mother-in-Law said it was the best turkey she ever had!! She is an incredible cook, who uses traditional Pennsylvania Dutch recipes, so this was truly a compliment. The flavor was delicious and the meat was so moist. It practically fell off the bone! I added more of everything and cooked a 20-lb. bird. Rave reviews by all, and it was very easy to prepare. Everyone should try it! For a 20-lb. bird it took about 5 hours to cook. I put carrots, onions and celery at the bottom of my roasting pan to give the drippings more flavor. There was a lot of drippings...great for the gravy and soups. Here's another hint...stick an apple in the turkey to give the meat even more flavor and make it even more tender.

It was my first time having the family over for Thanksgiving & this turkey was a hit!  My husband claims it was the best he'd ever had...so much better than a 'plain' turkey.  I also used thyme instead of basil.  Try this one - it's delicious!

This was the best turkey I have ever fixed!  The meat was succulently moist, even
the breast meat.  It smelled great while it was cooking & my mother said it was
the prettiest turkey she had ever seen when I took it out of the oven.  I will 
definitely make this again & I won't wait until Thanksgiving to do it!

WOW! This was a moist moist and flavorful turkey.  It is easy to prepare and won rave reviews from my family- not too bad considering it was the first whole turkey I had ever prepared!

Spices are not overbearing but rather enhance the flavor of the turkey.  I got lots of compliments and will be sure to use this in the future.  Thanks!

This turkey was excellent. I had so many compliments about it!  I used a fresh turkey and used butter instead of oil and also put in fresh sage. Smashing!

I used this recipe with game hen and it turned out wonderfully! I baked 4 game hen for 1 1/2 hours and placed a small pan of water under my baking sheet - this really does help keep the meat moist! As an added touch I broiled the hens for 5 minutes to brown the skin. Great meal for entertaining!

This was by far the best turkey I've ever had. My family was also very impressed by it. It was very moist and falling off the bone. I also chose to marinate my turkey overnight in the rub. I'll be making this next year as well. Delicious!!

AWESOME! A bit hesitant about making a whole turkey for the first time, I decided that the reviews for this recipe were favorable, so I gave it a try. It took a little bit of time to prep, but it was very easy to do. I added some rubbed sage, garlic powder, and extra black pepper to the olive oil mix. Everyone was so impressed. What a juicy, flavorful bird. An absolute keeper. I may even offer to make the Thanksgiving turkey this year, with my new confidence. Yum.

I used this recipe when making my very first roast turkey. Since I had made roast chicken before, I knew I wanted to use real salted butter (Land O' Lakes) instead of olive oil (I omitted the salt in the recipe since I used salted butter), and I doubled up on all the ingredients since I wanted to make sure my turkey was moist with the butter. 

In addition to substituting butter for the olive oil and doubling up, I also tweaked the recipe in adding more garlic than called for. I also used a disposable roasting pan and did not use a roasting rack or the water that was called for. If you use enough butter, you don't need to the water to keep the turkey moist...plus, the water spoils the drippings for the gravy.

I also cooked the bird breast-down, that way the breast was cooked in the butter and spices when it melted. I still spooned the melted butter/spice mixture over the exposed portion of the bird, however, to make sure all the meat was moistened and delicious. I used the drippings to make the gravy.

The turkey and gravy turned out perfect! My husband said it was the best turkey and gravy he'd ever eaten (and his parents are fabulous cooks).

Hands Down,,, the best turkey I've ever made. I infused the oil and herbs the night before and let the turkey dry out in the fridge for 4 hours(next year I'll let in dry out overnight). 
This is now our new family recipe.. my toddlers will be enjoying this and making special thanksgiving memories with the aroma of this turkey recipe in my home for many years to come :)

Wonderful flavor! The only thing I would recommend for making it better would be brining the turkey overnight. I also added a cup of white wine to the pan instead of the water. In looking at the recipe again, I realize I forgot to add the fresh basil, but we didn't miss it. I really love the rosemary flavor - so perfect for turkey! I cooked the turkey with breast downwards and it stayed nice and moist. Doesn't look as pretty, but taste is what matters.

This was delicious!!
I brinned the turkey in a cooler with water to cover, 1 1/2 cups salt and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I also added fresh, crushed rosemary, fresh chopped Basil, course chopped garlic and Italian seasoning. Brine for 24 hours if possible.
Prior to cooking I followed the recipe with the addition of course chopped garlic and I used butter instead of oil.  I also stuffed the turkey with celery, cut garlic cloves, onions and mushrooms (just for flavor but it tasted wonderful as well).
I put it in at 400F and immediately turned down the heat to recommended temp.
The results were yummy.  Thank you Star Pooley

Okay, best turkey we have ever had/done! Husband Brined the turkey in salt water and a bit of sugar for about 36 hrs. Then followed the recipe, adding garlic cloves, onions, and rosemary sprigs to the cavity of the bird. Moist with so much flavor!! Love the Rosemary!

The first time I cooked a turkey, I was terrified. It seemed so daunting; how could I serve turkey to my friends and family, who were used to my mother-in-law's incredibly-moist, always-delicious turkey?

Thank goodness I found this recipe. I followed the instructions (although I modified the cooking time since I was cooking a breast instead of a whole turkey per Butterball's instructions) and the turkey came out perfect. It was moist, flavorful and delicious.

Great recipe!! I followed the brine suggestions (1 galon of water, 1 cup of rock salt, 1 cup of sugar, orange and lemon juice) and it was MOIST & DELICIOUS. Also made Turkey breasts (the ones that sell at Costco) and they turned out really tasty and were way too easy to slice and serve. Now I feel like a kitchen pro!! :D

I only had a breast, but it was a full one with skin. I adjusted accordingly and got it under the skin and over it too. It came out really juicey and tasty. I only had one problem, I believe it was too much rosemary. It overpowered the the taste, but that may have just been my problem. I did use all dried herbs and let them soak in the evoo before putting them on the turkey. I did not use the whole amount of course and took a little more out because they were dried too. I think next time I might just not use the rosemary as it's not a "Holiday" taste to me.

WOW! Made this for Thanksgiving, and I will DEFINATLY make this again! I had many many compliments on the turkey, there was hardly any left, my husband was disapointed! Made mostly as is, but added more rosemary (and put a couple sprigs inside of the bird with some lemon quarters) and used 2x the amount of olive oil.

WOW!  This was the moistest turkey we've ever had.  Amazing, and the rosemary made it a super yummy gravy!  Although the turkey was so moist it didn't need gravey.

Beautiful, delicious and wonderful! I used this recipe for last year's Thanksgiving dinner, everyone loved it. I blended the spices and oil 2 days in advance and let the flavors infuse, so it was even more aromatic. I'm using it again this year for today's Thanksgiving dinner, and my house already smells amazing! Trust me, this one doesn't disappoint.

Great addition of flavor to poultry.  This also works well for roasted chicken...just adjust the cooking time according to the weight of the bird.

I made this recipe last year & it was my first time making a turkey my dad has always been the turkey cook in our family. Well that was in AZ & I now live in CO with my husband & to be honest I never liked turkey before I made this one YUMMY!!!! I did do a couple of thing different. I put it in a bag, I used broth instead of water, & in each of the pockets I made for the rosemary mixture I added a squared slice of butter. It was fabulous. WE HAD NO LEFTOVERS!!!! How great is that? Its never heard of in my family.   I used an 20lb turkey for 7 people (2 of which r tiny picky eater teenage girls).
A lady commented about making stabs in the turkey to push the rosemary into. I just wanted her to know that is not needed. With making the pockets tween the skin & meat it holds the seasoning where it needs to be to allow the meat to soak it up naturally.
Thank you soooooooo much for this recipe!!!

This was my first turkey EVER and it turned out nicely. I followed the recipe exactly except substituting sage for basil (becasue I had none). The breast was a little dry, but I'm sure as a turkey novice I just overcooked it a bit. Flavor was good, made excellant gravy, and I will be making a wonderful turkey pot pie with leftovers!

This was easy and delicious!  I put fresh rosemary, a cut up onion & celery rib and some fresh sage in the cavity and tented the bird once the breast was nicely browned.  Rather than putting water in the pan, I basted the turkey every 45-60 minutes or so, which made for nice crispy skin. (I know, I know, the skin isn't good for you, HOWEVER, my family fights over it! Mmmmmm...) Just the aroma of the meat and rosemary wafting through the house as it roasted was heavenly! It was moist & tender and carved easily. Thank you, Star!

Simply amazing. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I added oregano and thyme and put it in one of those turkey bags. It was delicious, the bones just slid right out. We saved the broth because it was so delicious smelling and saved left overs with a little broth in them to keep it moist. I will be using that broth for a turkey noodle soup or something equally delicious.

Fantastic recipe!  I baked the turkey in a bag and turned the bird upside down so the juices would keep the breast meat moist.

This recipe is delicious! Has been a major hit with all who have tried. By putting the mix between the skin and the meat makes the meat taste so good. Not just the skin has seasoning! I like to use white wine instead of water.

Best turkey recipe ever.  Hands Down. I come from a family of cooks and I made this last year for my first turkey and it came out better than anticipated and it was so moist and flavorful (no gravy needed!).  I had everyone at dinner saying it was also the best they had ever had.  This year I will make it again but I will probably eye in a little bit extra of all the ingredients.  I also let my turkey marinate over night instead of throwing it strait into the oven, this was helpful in keeping it from drying out. If you are thinkgin about trying this, don't hesitate!

Great flavor, very tender and moist. I also prepared the oil the night before and added a little more water to pan when cooking. My kitchen smelled heavenly. Not ususally a big fan of turkey but this is a keeper. Leftovers were made into delicious turkey dumplings next day.

Best turkey I've ever roasted - got RAVE reviews from the thanksgiving gathering, they couldn't stop talking about it!  I never have used an herb rub under the skin before, and it was a little tricky at first to do, but I'm so glad I did because it made all the difference in the world in the flavor and moistness of the meat.   The only difference from this recipe that I added is that I brined the turkey for 24 hours before (w/ a recipe from this website) and then stuffed the turkey cavity with fresh herbs, quartered apples, onions and lemons to also enhance flavor after the rub.  From now on, I'll always roast all of my poultry like this.  Absolutely scrumptious.  Thanks a million for the recipe!

So so so so good.  My family loooved this turkey on Thanksgiving, they went on and on about how good it was.  I paired it with the "awesome cranberry apple sausage" stuffing recipe from this site--perfect combination.   I used an oven bag, and cooked the turkey breast-side down for most of the time, then flipped it for the last 2 hours (for presentation purposes).  This seemed to make the meat extra moist.

This was pretty good. The skin was not as dark as I would have liked, but the flavor was awesome. I had my parents over for Thanksgiving and made this. The gravy was reeeeealy good. I brined it overnight in lemon, orance, water, and salt.
For the gravy I just melted a half stick of butter, then added eqaul part flour. cooked that for about a minute (don't forget to stir the whole time) and then added in the dripings until it was almost the consistancy I wanted. The I added a little water. It was sooooo good. My mom was very proud!

First time I ever made turkey and this was the recipe I decided to try, boy was I right on the mark.  The turkey turned out great, everyone loved it.  The one thing I can't stand, when having a turkey, is not having crisp skin.  This recipe did not disappoint me at all.

Very good!  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing.  I made this again and have to update it to five stars.  It is SO good and makes great gravy too.  I thought it might be too greasy, but it's not.  Putting the marinade on the breast directly really does the trick.  Juicy and yummy!

Great turkey recipe! Turned out very moist, highly flavored, and elegant. Different enough to get noticed but not so different that my great uncle complained that I was "trying to act like one o' them gormets!" Plus it made the house smell great. I used even more garlic than what it called for.

I made this for my family's Thanksgiving dinner, and for a school banquet. Both times I got nothing but compliments! The rosemary is heavenly, but not overpowering. Even the leftover turkey sandwiches were ate plain.... no mayo needed, because the turkey was still moist, and so flavorful. This will be the ONLY way to make roasted turkey in our family. I can't wait to try it on roasted chicken too.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and the smell was incredible! The turkey was very moist and flavorful. I was afraid that the spices would make the gravy taste spicy but it was great! I'm doing it again this Thanksgiving!

Not much of a cook, however my turkey was a hit with this recipe.  Instead of using the water to roast the turkey, I use the baking bags and put a scoop of flour in to keep it from sticking.  I have used this recipe for the past 4 years and have always been satisfied with the turkey.

had to turn the turkey upside down to get it to stay moist.  the herbs kept 'oozing' out and had to be basted quite often.  the herbs didn't make for a good gravy stock, so had to make one in an emergency from a packet...

I'm hosting my first thanksgiving this year and I wanted a special turkey to serve. I used this recipe for a practice turkey and it was wonderful!! For my first ever turkey, it was sooo tender and moist. I also did what a previous person said and turned the turkey breast side down first, then flipped over about 30-45 minutes before done. I'm sure this will be a hit at Thanksgiving.

This totally kicked butt! I made extra oil the night before Thanksgiving, and on Thanksgiving day, the house rocked with the great small! Tip for rotating the turkey for brownness: use foil wrapped potholders and just pick it up with 2 hands.

I never cooked a turkey before.  I've always been scared to tackle big bird.  This year I got stuck with turkey duty when my brother said he was bringing a ham.  He always fried a turkey which got me out of the turkey thing.  Guess he finally got the hint that we didn't really like his fried turkey.  

I saw this recipe and said to myself...self, you can do this.  I figured it wasn't as easy as the recipe stated, but amazingly it was incredibly easy.  I bought a 12lb fresh turkey.  Cleaned it as suggested.  I loosened the skin of the turkey, that part worried me, but I got through it just fine.  I prepared the rosemary and basil mixture and rubbed the mixture under the skin and slathered the remaining mixture on the outside.  I placed a couple of sprigs of rosemary and one quartered onion inside my birdies tummy.  I put the turkey in a cooking bag and refrigerated it overnight.  The next day I threw the bird in a preheated oven and cooked her for about 2.5 hours.  She was a BEAUTIFUL golden brown with freckles of rosemary and basil.  Very tender and juicy.  The flavor wasn't intense but was quite apparent.  My family and friends raved over it all night.  I loved it too.  The leftovers are even better.  

I will definitely do this one again and I'll be trying the mixture on roasted chicken and my old stand by oven roasters.  

PS: This is a single mans dream recipe. It's easy as using a remote and I got several bonus points from the person I'm dating...LOL!

I used rosemary and garlic only, in the olive oil, as I was concerned about having an 'Italian' turkey, which didn't sound good with the standard sage/celery stuffing and gravy.  I didn't actually notice much difference than my regular turkey, except that the gravy had a different taste.  Separating the skin and breast was kind of a challenge, and gross.  This wasn't worth the time and money to me.

Very tasty and a nice change from the 'traditional' bird.  I wanted a turkey recipe that didn't scream Thanksgiving and this was it.  The skin was quite easy to separate from the breast and the rosemary and garlic made the whole house smell wonderful.  I also put a quartered onion and extra sprigs of rosemary in the cavity.  Covered loosely with foil for the first 2 hours to keep it from getting too brown/burned.

This was incredible!  I've now made this 3 times (once this year for Thanksgiving and I made 2 last December for a party).  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was exchanged the olive oil for butter and probably added more garlic.  I did not stuff the turkeys.  This turkey also makes an amazing gravy!  This year I learned that I have to make the gravy boil so it won't seperate.  So Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked thanksgiving dinner for the first time last year and i used this recipe...it was THE BEST and a great alternative to regular roasting that my family always does.  The turkey was so juicy and moist.  Definitely a keeper!

good but have had better. the seasoning would be could if you DON'T like turkey. I do so I thought it took away from the meal rather than adding to it.

Fun recipe and one of the best turkeys I have cooked in years. The bird stayed very moist and left enough drippings in the pan to make a generous amount of delicious gravy.

My turkey turned out great using this recipe.  I did modify it a bit though.  I roasted a whole garlic and squeezed the garlic paste out of it.  I then wisked that in with the olive oil and other ingrediates to make a thicker rub.  I also added chopped sage and put bay leaves, rosemary sprigs and sage leaves in the cavities.  I would not recommend all of these herbs on a smaller bird because they are very powerful, but on a large bird (22lbs and up) go crazy!  Don't forget to baste!  Great recipe!

Everyone raved about this recipe and they couldn't get enough of it.  No one used the gravy because the turkey was so moist.  I've made this several times and everytime its a hit.  Smells incredible.

I used this recipe for the first turkey I've ever cooked, and it turned out amazing. I forgot about making gravy, and noone noticed.  Just goes to show how good the turkey was.  I've already had requests to use this recipe for Christmas.

Wow! This turkey reminds of really good seasoned turkey deli meat. It was delicious. The flavor went into the meat, not just the outside. I used all dried herbs for lack of the fresh. I had a late Thanksgiving this year and this turkey sure was a lot to be thankful for!! Tastes great in leftovers too!

This is my first time to roast turkey and I did it for my grandaughter's school party last Tuesday, Nov. 20. I have not tasted it but my daughter said it was a hit. Everyone likes it and some children aged 5-6 comes back for seconds and thirds. The teacher and the help also likes it and asked for the recipes. I marinated it overnight and tent it lightly with foil during cooking time and baste it a lot. Thank you for your delicious recipe.

I made this tonight with a turkey breast.  Ingredients exactly as listed, covered roaster for 1 hour and uncovered for second hour. Great flavor. I separated the drippings and made gravy, nothing left. Thanks

I made this recipe 3 years ago on my first time hosting Christmas and it was a hit. The trick with separating the skin and rubbing in between made the meat fall off the bone so much I could barley lift it out of the cooking pan!!! Great recipe thanks a lot

Fantastic turkey! My family decided to have Christmas with the maternal grandparents this year; my grandmother has fresh rosemary growing in her garden, so I wanted to find a recipe to make use of it. I love love love this one! Just a few changes, however.

I added a little extra rosemary into the seasoning mixture, as well as a little bit of garlic powder and dry minced onions - maybe 1TBS added extra in all. I didn't have any fresh basil, so I just used dry basil flakes. I also melted a little bit of butter (around 1TBS) and added it to the mixture. After I put the seasoning on the turkey, I cut up 2TBS of butter into 8 pieces and placed it in the breast under the skin.

We stuffed the turkey with Uncle Ben's rice stuffing. My 12.8lb turkey cooked just about 5 hours and came out wonderfully browned and juicy. Usually, I hate white meat since it gets so dry, but I loved the white meat on this turkey; it was very moist and flavorful all the way down to the bone. The gravy turned out great as well. According to my grandmother, it's the best turkey she's ever had. Thanks to the poster for a great Christmas dinner! YUM!

Hosted my first thanksgiving, so I really wanted a recipe that would hit a home run for us, and this receipe did just that. I brined the turkey in addition for 2 days. The recipe was easy and the turkey ended up being the best I've ever had. The only issue I had was adjusting the serving size. We ended up doing 2 14lb birds, so had to play with the numbers a bit. Overall great recipe and I reccomend it highly.

I've made this turkey every year (that I'm cooking the turkey) for the past 7 or 8 years - however long ago I found it on this site.  I can't even quantify how many compliments I've received along with "You're definitely in charge of the turkey next year."  Even people who don't typically eat turkey and prefer ham give me effusive praise when they taste this turkey. It is so incredibly flavorful, I can't say enough good about this recipe.  I would give it 500 stars if I could.

Positively delicious! I've made this for Thanksgiving (plus an additional dinner) for the last three years. My family loves it so much that I can actually use it as a bargaining chip for almost anything I want! I usually don't measure the ingredients, just eyeball it and that's good. Also, I cut down the amount of oil used. The first time I found that I had a bit left over.

I never cooked a turkey before.  This recipe was super easy and I completely messed up.  Because I never did this before, I didn't realize how long a turkey took to thaw.  Out of desparation I through the bird, sans packaging, in a pot of water with some salt and called it a thawing brine.  The next morning, he was less frozen but I could not remove the skin from the bird to put the seasoning underneath, so I rubbed him with olive oil and rubbed the spices over the outside of the bird.  It was delish!  And fully cooked.  :)  I used only the fresh herbs and no italian seasoning, and it was still great.

I did this exactly as according to the recipe except I left out the italian seasoning....I thought it would taste too processed. It was the best turkey I think I've ever made. I also stuffed the bired with my regular stuffing...the spices seeped into the stuffing which was fantastic.I'll prepare this again this winter.

so amazing!!! i brined my turkey for two days with the "out of this world brine" recipe on this site, then used this to roast my turkey in an oven bag with chicken broth at the bottom instead of water...everyone loved it and the ever so hard to please Inlaws said it was the best turkey theyd ever had!

Huge hit!!! I add 2 sticks of unsalted butter to the mix. I put the salt and pepper directly on the turkey (I use a turkey breast bone-in and I cook it in a bag)This recipe has been a hit for the past 3 years. This T.G. We had a very big Family gathering. Several people tried my turkey for the first time and they absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this recipe, it will turn you boring turkey into the talk of the holiday.

This was my first attempt at roasting a turkey. I made a huge mistake in only adding 1 teaspoon of salt. It was SOOOO bland.... I would suggest adding a generous amount of salt.

This was the first turkey I ever made. It was flavorful and juicy, and my husband who doesn't like turkey loved it. I also brined mine. Even the turkey sandwiches and microwave leftovers are juicy. Replaced cup of water with white wine and cooked on rack. Excellent!

I used this recipe with one of the oven bags.  It turned out moist and absolutely delicious!  I mixed the olive oil mixture the night before so the flavors could blend.  It only took about 2 hours for my 14 lb turkey to cook in the bag.  I got rave reviews from everyone and the turkey disappeared quickly, no leftovers this year!  This is the only recipe I will use from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent Recipe! Soooo moist and perfectly seasoned. I will most definitely make this again next year. I did find there was plenty of the seasoning for my 21 lb. turkey.

This one is a must for your first turkey!  Can't go wrong with this recipe and you'll WOW everyone... I did.  (Thank you, Star)  Try one of the turkey brine recipes to marinate the day before for that extra-tederness.  I'll be making this again this year!

The rosemary mixture flavors the turkey perfectly and makes an excellent gravy.  Turkey comes out very moist.  This was my first attempt at making a turkey and it was wonderful.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times since I found it and it has always been a hit.  I do rub the turkey with spray butter.  After I pull the skin away to rub it good with spray butter and then rub it with the mixture.  Just to make it more tender.  Other then that this recipe is perfect.  You may not even want to do that.  I just like the extra buttery flavor.   I also apply more butter and more mixture over the turkey every 30 min. until the turkey is done.  Just to make srue it stays tender.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Being a vegetarian - but a darn good cook, I knew I needed a flavourful recipe for the turkey lovers.  This turned out perfect. For convenience sake, I roasted it in a oven bag and without changing anything, it turned out very moist.  Follow the roasting instructions on the bags if using them. The turkey lovers liked this a lot and it was perfect for me as I can not, more like will not, taste the finished bird to know otherwise !

This was good, but... the olive oil made the drippings greesy.  Which made the gravy separate.

I also thought that the measurements for the herbs need to be more, so i ended up using up 3 packages of mixed fresh herbs, sage, thyme, and rosemary. (didn't used the italian seasoning). Used about 5 cloves of garlic inside the cavity of the turkey. I marinaded the turkey over night and before this put the turkey in a brine solution.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.

Amazing!  This was the 1st turkey I have ever made and it turned out great!  This was by far the moistest turkey I have ever ate.  I did brine it over night like another reviewer suggested and I think that made it a 5 star recipe.  You can also vary the herbs a bit.  I bought a pack of fresh poultry herbs which included rosemary, sage and thyme.

Best way to season a turkey.  I have made this for the past 5 years for Thanksgiving and always comes out fantastic.  I usually cook the turkey in an oven bag, so it comes out extra moist.  Delicious!

This was the best Thanksgiving Turkey I have ever cooked!  All I can say is Moist and Heavenly!  I used a turkey brine first and then made up the rosemary/olive oil mixture between the skin and meat!  I had guest for supper and they said they have never tasted such a moist delicious turkey! And they said the turkey looked amazing when it came out of the oven! I will always be using this recipe! Thanks!

I was very intrigued by this technique so I tried this on chicken. The rub definitely added some interesting flavor...but I don't know if it made it "moist."

I followed this recipe to the tee... all fresh spices from the market. I used a chicken. It just wasn't really that thrilling. I like the 'Parmesan Crusted Herb Chicken' on this site much better.

I used fresh herbs mixing it with olive oil and putting both under the skin and basting on top. I also stuffed it using fresh herbs in the stuff (Awesome Sausage, Apple, & Cranberry Stuffing). It was the most favorful turkey I've eaten.  I did spend some time removing the excess fat both under the skin and inside the cavity.  I was surprised how much the 20lb bird had.  The 1/4 inch water at the bottom of the roasting pan kept it quite moist and make for lots of gravy.  Can't wait to taste the soup I'm making with the bones and skin.  The meat seems even more flavorful as leftovers. Glad I cooked a large turkey!

I have never received so many compliments on my turkey before making this extreemly easy recipe.  Not only was it tasty but soooo juicy.  I made some minor changes, added onion and fresh rosemary to the cavity of the turkey and instead of water I made a chicken bouillion and basted every half hour. When the turkey was done I carved it right out of the oven and placed it on a platter, and covered the turkey with the turkey juices which made it sooo moist!!!  I have requests to make it for new years dinner!!

I have been using this recipe for 4 years now...It makes the best turkey ever. I have changed just a bit and chop the fresh herbs and marinate them in the olive oil with some kosher salt(about 1 tbs) overnight then use that as the rub under and on top of the skin.....ITS THE BEST

Thanksgiving was a hit.  The turkey was very moist and the seasonings delightful.  I used only fresh herbs. I had a 23 lb turkey and roasted it for 5 hours covered it with tin foil (creating a tent).

I used this on a chicken, and it was great,  I can't wait to make this with a turkey, it's so easy compared to many of the other more labor intensive recipes for turkey out there, and the ingredients are reasonably priced.

This is the best turkey EVER - I've used this recipe for the last two Thanksgivings and leftovers (if there are any!) are gone in no time.  Fresh herbs are the key.  Last time I added strips of bacon under the skin (after the herb mix) and it turned out even more delicious.  Because I cook the stuffing separate, I stuff the turkey with apple and carrot slices and rosemary sprigs.  I follow the typical turkey roasting instructions (325°, breast up, no water), covering with foil until the last ~45 minutes so it can brown.  I’m an average cook at best, but get RAVE reviews for this turkey!

MMMMM!! This came out fantastic. I loved this way of seasoning my turkey. I thinkt he mixture would also work well if I put it on some potatoes and roasted them.

I use this recipe on whole chicken. I normally doctor recipes inspite of my best intentions of leaving the recipe as is...however with this recipe - it's right on the mark. I just eyeball the ingredients, toss it all together and stick it in the oven. There are never any leftovers (and there are only 2 of us in the house - LOL). I've used this recipe over and over - thanks!!

This was my first attempt at a cooking a turkey and it was fabulous.  I used melted butter instead of olive oil.  I didn't stuff the turkey so I put a few apples and onion for additional flavor.  I will definatly make again!

We had this for Sunday dinner and it was wonderful.  I simply put it in the oven and left to go skiing.  When we came home the house smelled great and the turkey was so moist we did not even need the gravy I made with the drippings.  This will be how our turkey is made each time not.  I am using the left-overs to make Turkey Noodle Soup (from this site) tonight.

I have made this turkey every Thanksgiving for the last six years and it's always a crowd pleaser.  I also use  the same recipe (halved or quartered) for rotisserie-ing whole chicken on the grill.  Once you loosen the skin away from the meat, you can just dump the oil into the bird and massage it around from the outside.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Rubbing under the skin was a bit time consuming but definitely worth the effort.  Our Thanksgiving guests raved that this was the best turkey ever!

WOW! My first attempt at a roasted turkey EVER and it was fabulous. I replaced the water with about 2 cups chicken broth. I rubbed the excess olive oil mixture all over the bird. I basted it every 30 minutes. I read the roasted turkey hints and decided to bake it at 350 just until it started to golden, then the whole bird with foil. 45 minutes before it expected done time I removed the foil and cooked the rest of the way. Then made a superb gravy from ALL the drippings in the pan..YUMMY. Holy cow was it awesome. So awesome, my culinarily gifted father even asked how I did it!! Make This Turkey!!

Very delicious!  Didn't need to change the recipe at all.  Just a hint, if you want to make turkey soup, check out the Left Over turkey soup recipe on this site with your carcass.  Amazing flavor.

I really don't think the taste of the herbs penetrated into the meat.  I tried a plain piece of white meat to check it out before adding gravy to it, and really think it tasted the same as a plain butterball.

This was my very first time making turkey, and nobody thought I could do it. It turned out incredible. I used butter instead of olive oil, prepped the night before, and cooked the turkey upside down for the first 2 hours. I put apples, onion and rosemary in the cavity.  Btw, maybe it is my small oven but the turkey was almost completely cooked in 2 hours, at 325. I had a 14 pound bird too. My fiancee said that this was the best oven roasted turkey he ever had (and we had to keep it from drying out in the oven for 3 hours). I crisped up the skin under the broiler for about 10 min for color.  The bird was gorgeous.

This recipe is wonderful.  Great flavor.  My family asked me to make the turkey this way this Thanksgiving and I am very happy to accommodate since I loved it too.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  A family favorite.

I made TWO turkeys last year for Thanksgiving and just remembered I haven't rated/reviewed this delicious recipe.  Both turkeys were a big hit.  I doubled the mixture and spread it on the 10-12 lb turkeys.  It's one of the most tender and delicious turkeys I have ever had.  I also cooked mine in a turkey bag with celery underneath and stuffing inside.  Thank you!

I made this turkey for the first time 4 years ago. It was my first turkey and it was wonderful.  We have made it every year since and everyone loves it.  I'm looking forward to making it again this year.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS  A TOTAL KNOCKOUT-I USED A 10 POUND TURKEY AND THE FLAVOR WAS FANTASTIC.I USUALLY ADD TONS OF THINGS TO MY TURKEY AND IT STILL ENDS UP TASTING LIKE "TURKEY"BUT THIS WAS GREAT ADDED LOTS OF FLAVOR WITHOUT BEING OVERPOWERING FOR MY THANKSGIVING DINNER-AND PRESENTATION OF THE GARLIC AND HERBS UNDER THE COOKED SKIN LOOKS LIKE A MAGAZINE COVER.IT'S LOOKING LIKE I MAY HAVE FINALLY FOUND MY YEARLY BIRD-THANKS SO MUCH.

This was great!! I brined the turkey as suggested in 2 c. kosher salt, 1 c. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 12 bay leaves, and 3 tbsp. fresh rosemary.  I let it soak over night and then followed the recipe exactly.  This was my first turkey and it was awesome!!! I had 15 people for dinner and everyone loved it!!! I also roasted the turkey covered for the first hour.

iI cant believe it it worked! This was my very first turkey and no one thought i could do it. It turned out fantastic. But I would suggest brining it first in a bown sugar & salt solution and also letting the herbs marinate overnight.

This is the second year I've ever made turkey. Last first I used the oven bag, a safe no-brainer, but this years turkey was ten times better! The most appealing part of this recipe is how delicious the bird looks with the crusted herbs on it after it's pulled out of the oven. Apparently the skin was very good because it was polished off before I even got to try any. The meat was very moist. My mom asked for the recipe... I'll be making this again next year!

Absolutely amazing! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. The only thing I did differently was marinate the turkey overnight in a salt, garlic, and onion mixture. The recipe was very easy and very aromatic! My boyfriend raved about the smell all day! The result was a BEAUTIFUL bird. Very juicy with lots of delicious drippings left over. Highly recommended!

I've made this recipe 4 times so far, twice at Thanksgiving, once at Christmas, and once at Easter. Everyone loves it, and I've even shared the recipe with friends. It was my first time making a turkey, and it turned out wonderfully. I used a combination of fresh and dried ingredients, and rubbing the mixture under the skin is key. The drippings make a tasty gravy, and I'm sure I'll be using this recipe many more times.

This recipe is fabulous!  I cooked it in a oven bag, which sliced the cooking time in half, added carrots and onions to the bag, and also about 2/3 cup white wine.  After it was done cooking, I drained the wine, added flour and a pinch of salt, and it made a great gravy!  I used this recipe last Thanksgiving and will use it again this year!! Yum!

Whew! Thank goodness this worked! I was assigned the turkey (lucky me) for a family gathering...this is moist and delicious and can even withstand a re-heating or two...it may even improve the flavor! I used rosemary fresh from my garden, and it was wonderful!

This Christmas was my first time ever cooking a turkey.  This recipe made my turkey look like it should be featured in a cooking magazine.  And it tasted just as good!  I can't belive how easy it was.

Had an early Christmas dinner and for the first time decided to try something new. The turkey was fantastic, moist tender and not to mention absolutely delicious. I live in France where turkeys are not often served and have a reputation of being dry-- my guests loved it and no longer have that impression.

I love this recipe!  I used it on chicken instead of turkey, but the chicken breast came out very moist and juicy-- I think the key is the water and the low oven temperature.  I tried it a second time with cilantro instead of basil, which I thought gave the chicken more of a flavor and kick.

YUM YUM YUM, this was EXCELLENT, I used it for a 4lb. chicken, I prepared it 24 hours in advance and let it rest in the fridge in a ziploc bag, I also stuffed it with some extra fresh rosemary. It turned out to die for, truly delicious, and the smell filled my house, it was great. thanks.

Since I have little room in my oven, I decided to barbeque my turkey (indirect method) this Thanksgiving following the recipe for the marinade.  It was absolutely delicious and a hit with everyone.  The flavor from the fresh herbs was awesome!  I think next time I will try marinating it the night before as someone earlier suggested.  It could only improve on an already wonderful recipe.

I also added some melted butter along with the olive oil and seasoning; it made the most succulent bird and instead of water I added some chicken stock to the bottom of the roasting pan and the Turkey gravy was out of this World.

I used this recipe many times for both chicken and turkey.  Last time I roasted a chicken I used a very popular roasted chicken recipe on this site and I wish I used this one!  I always sub out the Rosemary for the different types of Italian seasoning I have laying around.  It's delicious under the skin either way!

Wow. This was wonderful. Did this on a fairly small/medium sized turkey roast and it was amazing. For the water I did use 2/3 cup of beef broth instead, but everything else I followed fairly close to the directions (I usually just estimate the amount of seasoning as I can eyeball it well). I Will definitely do this again next time I have large turkey or chicken portions that need roasting (to the most helpful critical reviewer - your chicken was bland because you didn't put the rub under the skin and soft because you didn't cook it long enough.)

Oh. My. Goodness! This was DELICIOUS! The family hasn't stopped talking about it since Thanksgiving and you can bet I will never get away with making any other recipe ever again. I'm glad Christmas is on its way - I can't wait to eat this again. Thanks go to Star and to Whirllybird for your recipes for the turkey and brine, respectively. Seriously, this was the best turkey I've ever had.

This was the first turkey I ever made! I was nervous about it drying out because I had no experience before with a turkey but it turned out awesome! I made a 17 lb turkey so I did 1 1/2 times the ingredients and it worked great. We also used a flavor injector to shoot it up with some of the olive oil drippings. The skin got a little crispy but my guests preferred that so it worked out!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of pouring water in the bottom of the pan. Despite doing everything possible to screw this up including forgetting the rack for the first 2 hours, tearing the skin on the breast while rubbing the spices on and accidentally turning the heat up to 450 for an hour. It came out excellent!

The first turkey I ever made, and hands down, it was the BEST turkey EVER! Seriously! We had about 20-25 people and my friend was asked to make one of the turkeys for her family. She had an 18lbs turkey. We weren't able to get the fresh herbs but we used this recipe as our base. We used freeze-dried poultry herb by lite house, dried basil, olive oil, salt& pepper, season salt. We used 2 cups olive oil, a whole container of the poultry herbs, 1/4 ounce of dried basil, 4 tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp season salt. We lightly sprinkled season salt on the whole turkey (skin). We mixed together all our ingredients and followed the instructions from there. We didn't cook the stuffing in the turkey so we seasoned the inside of the turkey too. We put the turkey in an oven baked bag and poured what was left over from the mixture in the bag. We let it marinade over night. We cooked the turkey breast down so the breast could cook in all those juices. Seriously, this turkey was murdered within minutes and everyone asked for the recipe!

My mom first tried this recipe last Thanksgiving. I had fixed it and cooked it myself as she was guiding me (it was my first time cooking). The results on the flavor was DELICIOUS! Now, I was looking for this recipe for this coming thanksgiving and I finally found it! Now I can make the turkey ALL on my OWN! Yum!

This recipe has made me the Official Turkey Cooker.  I just use the turkey bouquet out of the produce department instead of just rosemary and basil.  I even did this on chicken.  Better than fried turkey.

My family LOVES this recipe. I have made my turkey this way for about 10 years. I usually double the recipe because we have 18-20 lb. turkeys. I always cover the turkey with cheese cloth soaked in chicken stock and use the stock instead of water in the bottom of the pan. Then baste the cheese cloth every 20 min. When you remove the cheese cloth it is beautiful. This year I am going to try to do the rub the day before to let the flavor marinate the meat.

I made a turkey breast for friends last night and it was delicious!   No need to brine.   The turkey is very juicy and tender.   I  put herbs inside the cavity as well and use chicken broth for the water.  I tented the bird to avoid getting it too brown. Yum!  Will certainly make this again for thanksgiving.

Delicious! spices made this turkey fabulous. I have never before rubbed spices under the skin but can say the flavors found all of the meat. The Rosemary from our yard never tasted better! Use this recipe with confidence with your next family gathering.

Brined a roasting chicken and rubbed the mixture - minus basil and Italian seasoning - under skin, in cavity, and on skin. Stuffed cavity with half a lemon and added no water to pan. I don't know how much flavor was from brining and how much was from recipe, but the chicken was delicious and juicy.

Ran across the recipe while looking for a last minute rub. With the exception of the garlic I used dried spices and the turkey turned out great. It was moist and delicious. For the salt, I guessed and used 2 tsp of sea salt. I also did not put water in the bottom.

If you're writing a recipe, why use "...to taste"? Couldn't it also be garlic/basil/rosemary to taste?

Fabulous recipe !  I didn't have fresh herbs available, so I used dried and it was by far THE BEST turkey breast I've ever made ! Very flavorful, tender and juicy :)  I prepared as directed, baked it 2 hrs breast down, turned it to brown up the skin and cook to proper temperature.  Just wonderful ! Thanks :)

Best turkey ever!  Followed the recipe exactly and used TRIVERT's brine solution (previous comment).  I will never make a turkey any other way - this really is the best.

I had picky eaters and accomplished cooks over for thanksgiving so I was looking for something that was somewhat traditional but not boring. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a bottle of wine instead of water. I also used butter instead of olive oil. It was a 10! Everybody loved it!

I am not a good cook. I just made this recipe and it came out perfect! I have never used my oven too much. But, I just recently bought a big duel fuel range (gas stove on top, electric convection oven) and I have been getting recipes from this site and cooking up a storm lately. This recipe has been my best yet! I highly recommend it!

GREAT RECIPE!!!  Turkey is usually always dry.  But not this one.  It was moist and tasty. The  flavors  made the kitchen smell wonderful and the taste was exquisite.  My sister-in-law who took the turkey breast out of the oven immediately said it was overcooked and would be dry.  She was WRONG!.  Once she tasted it she loved it and wanted the recipe.  I am trying the rub on chicken today.   You will not be dissapointed if you use this rub.

I couldn't believe how tender and delicious the turkey was! I was very tempted to change the oil for butter but I didn't at the end. it had the the perfect flavours. However, one night before I brined the turkey in 3/4 cup of salt + 1 cup sugar + spices for 12 hrs. People are still buzzing about how good my turkey was in Christmas. The 24 pounds turkey was cooked covered for 5 hrs, and it was basted with the juices every hr. I put an inch of chicken broth in the roasting pan...

WOW.  Tried this (placing seasoning under the skin) for the first time and this recipe was amazing!  Everyone raved, the house smelled fabulous and it's my new plan for every turkey (or chicken) I roast.  I'd never added the water to the bottom of the roaster before and that seemed to really work to my advantage as well!  Super moist meat and lots of gravy base to work with. Thanks for this recipe!

I've never made a Turkey before. I just got married and moved into my first house this past year with my husband and son and I was really afraid to try a big dish on my own. Surprisingly, this was incredibly easy to prepare and it only took a few short minutes. I modified it by melting some butter and buttering the Turkey ever 30 minutes so that it wouldn't dry out. It's absolutely delicious! It's moist and tastes great! I don't know how to make gravy from the stock that develops so I use McCormick Turkey Gravy and it's still just as great. Once I know how to make home-made gravy from this, I'm sure it would be 100 times better! I incredibly recommend.

My fault in that I cooked it too long, in that it was too dry.  However, the seasoning was a strange combination and gave the bird a "non-thanksgiving" flavor.   The garlic and rosemary combined with italian seasoning was too much.  Next time,  I sticky with my thyme and sage!

Best turkey ever!  Brined 12-lb turkey night before using brine recipe from WHIRLLYBIRD.  Also followed suggestion by another and mixed all the ingredients the night before to allow all ingredients to really meld and save on prep time next day.  Cooked turkey in Reynolds bag at 350 deg.  Update: Second time around and still 5 stars but next time will cook breast side up for better presentation (browned).

I thought I had reviewed this but I guess not.  It was so good, that I have to do it now. It was the best roasted turkey I have ever cooked. I did it just as the recipe says, did not change a thing.  It was beautiful, moist, delicious.  Everyone loved it.  This recipe will be used again and again.  Thanks for sharing Star.

YES! My very first Thanksgiving cooking was a complete sucess thanks to this recipe. I definately reccommend brining the turkey overnight, then letting the mixture sit on the turkey for about an hour before you cook it.

We made this WONDERFUL turkey and I have to say that it came out SOOOOO good!  Everyone that smelled the aroma coming out of my kitchen told me that it made their mouths water!! :)  We used fresh rosemary, basil and garlic and it REALLY gave it that fresh taste!  Best turkey I've ever made and I'm glad I found this recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful.  My only complaint is that I had a really hard time getting the rub to stick to the turkey.  No one else has mentioned it, so maybe it was something I did wrong.  Anyway, in the end, it was exceptional.  I cannot wait to make it again!

This was the best Turkey I've ever had. It was my first time making a Turkey for Thanksgiving and I got a ton of compliments on it. I did a brine first. Rubbing the mixture under the skin was gross, but I tried not to think about it. Turned out moist and wonderful!

This had a great flavor - I used the drippings to make Turkey noodle soup and it was WONDERFUL.  My turkey using this recipe did turn out a little dry (only the breast) - so next time I will either cook it upside down - or in a cooking bag.

This turkey was AMAZING! It was my first year making turkey and I was really nervous but it turned out great.  I took the advise of some of others postings and made sure to get under the skin with the olive oil mixture.  I also used granny smith apples in the cavity instead of stuffing.  I learned that trick from my dad, it makes for a very moist turkey, and very delicious apples :-)

Delicious!  I added some turkey gravy and cooked mine in a crockpot for 10 hours on low heat.  It turned out wonderful; it was completely moist and full of flavor!  The spices are wonderful--I'm definitely making this again!

I was very please with this recipe. I used an 8 lb turkey breast and preped the turkey as stated then I stuffed it into a large ziplock freezer bag and poured the rest of teh rosemary mixture into the bag and sealed it. I let it marinade over night. Then I cooked it in my slow cooker for 2 hours on high then 4 hours on low. It was so moist and had a very nice mild flavor that didn't over power. his was a huge hit with my whole family. Thanks for a great recipe!

My first turkey and it was fabulous!  Moist even without a brine, although I did use chicken stock instead of water and basted frequently.

Used this recipe for the 2nd time today. Only had dried herbs, and no sage at all. Still worked beautifully. The best turkey I have made to date. Thank you again Star Pooley for a winner of a recipe.

I did this as my first attempt at a whole bird in 2008 and it was absolutely perfect.  Aside from adding a foil tent I used this recipe straight up.  Very easy to prep.  The outcome was a delicious, moist turkey that wasn't overpowered by the seasoning.

Excellent flavour. I roasted it breast down for the first two hours, then flipped it for the last few. Very moist and flavorful bird! I used rosemary, basil, sea salt and pepper. I will do this every time I make a turkey now. I usually brine my chickens, but this would probably be a shortcut and very tasty as well.

I came across this recipe two years ago and I absolutely love it!! This is now my Thanksgiving turkey recipe. I never had the responsibility of cooking the turkey as we would go to family members houses for dinner, but since we moved, dinner is now done at home. The turkey is very flavorful and best of all it is ALWAYS moist. I do brine my turkey the day before with salt water and stuff it with my signature stuffing (stove top :P). If you don't mind getting your hands dirty it is definately worth it.

This was an excellent recipe - I think this is going to be our standard roast turkey recipe from now on.  The turkey came out perfect!  We altered it a little - we stuffed the turkey with a couple of lemons that had been boiled.  We also poured about 1/2 a bottle of white wine and chicken broth in the roasting pan, with carrots, onions, and celery.  We then used the pan drippings to make gravy.

Tasteful Turkey indeed!. I brined the turkey first in kosher salt, rosemary, thyme, celery, sage, and onion, cold water mixture for 24hours. Once done I followed the recipe and added butter, black pepper, and chicken seasoning to the dry rub. I also put white wine in the bottom of the roaster instead of water. The turkey came out nice and moist and was delicious!

I used this reciped yesterday on a 20# turkey. I covered the turkey with foil for the first half of the cook time, then uncovered and got that gorgeous golden brown skin with the herbs all over it.  The turkey was moist and flavorful.  Lots of compliments.  The house smelled wonderful.  I will definately use this again and use it on a roasting hen (chicken) with perforated lemons in the cavity.  This is a new favorite for poultry.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this reciped yesterday on a 20# turkey. I covered the turkey with foil for the first half of the cook time, then uncovered and got that gorgeous golden brown skin with the herbs all over it.  The turkey was moist and flavorful.  Lots of compliments.  The house smelled wonderful.  I will definately use this again and use it on a roasting hen (chicken) with perforated lemons in the cavity.  This is a new favorite for poultry.  Thanks for sharing.

As you make this turkey, don't be shocked by the strong flavors before it enters the oven. Once the aroma fills your home, you will build the confidence you have made the right choice. This particular recipe was such a hit, I don't think I will use anything else for quite some time. Very juicy bird, very flavorful gravy was made and everyone kept taking tidbits off the turkey well after dinner was finished. Enjoy, as we did.

I make a turkey for thanksgiving every year and try different recipes because I am not a big turkey fan.  I used this recipe last year and everyone agreed it was the best ever.  I didn't make any modifications.

I have made this multiple times and it always turns out perfect!  The only thing I change is that I add a few pats of butter between the skin as well to keep it moist.  It is so flavorful and the gravy turns out tasty too!  I highly recommend.

I combined two recipes, I added in my favorite chicken recipe (simply lemon baked chicken)....I followed this recipe and I also rubbed the entire turkey down with paprika and halved four lemons and sqeezed them onto the turkey, when i was done with the lemon halves i stuffed them into the turkey as well as some of the left over rosemary!  I will make this again, my husband loved it too!

This was my first attempt at making a whole turkey, and needless to say I was intimidated!  No need with this recipe, it was wonderful.  I chopped the herbs and mixed them with the olive oil and seasonings the night before.  The only adjustment I made was that I added sliced lemons under the skin.  The cooking time seemed to be less than directed, more like 3 hours, but maybe my turkey was a little smaller.  Either way, my family told me it was the best turkey they had ever had!

This will be my 5th year making this turkey.  The only thing I do, not mentioned in the recipe, is that I brine the turkey.  You'll never have a dry turkey.  Some years ago guests brought some other meat as my family-and my husband's did not care for turkey.  After this recipe, I got stuck every year cooking the turkey and the best complement: NO-ONE BRINGS OTHER MEATS ANYMORE!!!!!  Give it a try!

This turkey was delicious!  My dad and I cooked it and we used the rosemary brine.  The turkey was VERY moist.  I think next time we will put some butter under the skin prior to cooking the turey, but other than that everything was perfect.  We also cooked the turkey on the BBQ.  It only took about 3 1/2 hours to cook.  Fresh herbs are definitely better!  Great recipe!

This was fabulous! I had a 3 1/2# boneless, skinless turkey breast, which I rubbed these ingredients onto all over, then rolled up and tied tightly with string being sure to tuck in the edges. Put in a preheated 450º oven and immediately reduced the temp to 350, cooking 20-30 minutes a pound until done.  It was tender, juicy, and had a wonderful flavor.  I thought my husband was going to eat the whole thing!  Thank you Star!!!

Had never made turkey before since I always worried that it would come out too dry.

This was simple, and easy and the turkey came out fantastic.

I have made it a few times, and I sometimes play around with different spice combinations.  Never been disappointed.

This was very good. The directions made it easy enough to make, even though it was my first turkey. It was very, very moist, and the spiced made a nice combination. Like others, I mixed the oil and herbs the day before to let them infuse. Thank you for a great thanksgiving!

I used this recipe for my Christmas turkey. My turkey came out amazing and my entire family raved through out the entire meal. The turkey was moist, smelled fantastic, and tasted wonderful. It was my best attempt at turkey yet! I did not stuff my turkey, and instead filled the cavity with a few quartered onions.

This was an absolutely sensational recipe.  My mom and I were putting in the turkey and when she said she was leaving it plain, I found this recipe and within 10 minutes the turkey was in the oven cooking.  This recipe was easy, makes the skin turn a beautiful golden brown, and was very moist.  Honestly one of the best recipes I've gotten off the site - my Mom and I agree this is a new holiday staple.  We used frozen herbs and let them thaw with the bird.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner with all of our college friends and their families. The turkey was juicy and tender. The flavor was throughout the meat. Everyone thought it was great. One guest said it was the best oven roasted turkey he'd ever had. Another said he did not know you could get turkey this good without using an oven bag. I brined the turkey for 24 hrs. I don't know how much that did or did not contribute to the flavor. Whichever, the turkey was great! Definately a keeper.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I had my doubts using this recipe even after reading all the reviews that there was no way it could be that good roasted and not be dry. Boy was I wrong! After getting hassled by my hole family for the brine i used by another reviewer with what they called would be a "orange juice flavored turkey" i was really scared of this being my first and last thanksgiving dinner. But, once we started carving and taking a bite, everyone's mouths dropped! This recipe will be a definte in our house for years to come. Thank you so much for making my first thanksgiving a good one!

This is the first time I have deviated from my normal plain & simple roasting method, and while I admit it turned out very moist and browned beautifully, I will return to my old way next year. I found that although I love rosemary and garlic in chicken, I do not care for it in turkey. And while the olive oil under the skin kept the bird moist, I will try it next year with melted butter instead in order to have the traditional gravy that I make from the drippings. It was fun to try something different--thanks for sharing, Star!

I doubled the recipe for a 11 lb. turkey, and I added squeezed lime juice to it (about 1 cup). Before brushing the mixture on the turkey, I added pats of butter inside the skin and rubbed it all over the turkey, and then seasoned the turkey with the mixture, inside and out. I did this the night before Thanksgiving as a marinade, and left it on the fridge covered with foil overnight. The next day, before roasting it, I added 1 cup of water on the bottom of the pan and put it in the oven. After 1 hour in the oven, I basted the turkey every 30 minutes until it was done. It was simply delicious!! It was one of the best turkeys ever!  This is was only the second turkey I've ever made and it was easy to make. It might take a little time to prepare it (separating the skin from the breast and rubbing the mixture inside the skin can be a little tricky), but it was sure worth it! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Husband loved it and so did I.
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a fantastic method.  You can use all or any part of the seasonings listed and the result is great.  I used a combination of softened butter and olive oil for a nice spreading consistency plus about 1/4 cup chopped fresh sage, some rosemary, salt, pepper and a bit of minced garlic.  I stuffed the cavity with 1/2 a cut up onion, sprigs of fresh thyme and fresh rosemary.  I poured 2 cups of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan before placing in the oven.  About an hour before the bird was done, I poured a 1/2 cup of dry sherry mixed with an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth over the bird to make for a more flavorful gravy.  I had to place a small piece of foil over the breast about half way through the cooking.  The result was tender and just perfect.  Thanks!  **UPDATE** Did again for Thanksgiving with dry herbs (including garlic powder for the minced garlic) and thought the result was just as good.

Made this for Thanksgiving 2006 and the turkey came out juicy and moist using this recipe.  It was beautiful too.  I roasted at 475 degrees for 30 min. then turned down the heat to 350 for 2 1/2 hrs.  My turkey weighed 12 lbs.  It browned nicely. I covered the breasts after 2 hrs and the legs and wings after 2 1/2 hrs so they wouldn't brown too much.  The color was nice and tasted great.  

My only comment is that I found the wonderful flavors of this turkey kind of odd with the traditional gravy, stuffing and cranberry flavors.  I still liked it but for real traditionalist perhaps a more traditional turkey recipe would be better.  This would be great with a rice casserole and roasted vegetables.

The turkey was so juciy with this recipe!  The turkey needs some more seasoning, maybe some salt/pepper or turkey seasoning.  But otherwise its a great recipe!

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't that great either.  This might actually work better with chicken or hen, rather than turkey.

I thought I would try something different this year for my turkey, so chose this recipe. So glad that I did. This was the first time I was able to cook a turkey where the white meat was flowing with juices. Absolutely tasty and moist!  Everyone absolutely loved it! A definite keeper of a recipe. I'll be making this for many years to come.

This turned out wonderfully! I had a 25lb turkey and just doubled the ingredients...I also brined it for almost 12 hours in water, salt, rosemary and basil. This is my first time making anything WHOLE in terms of meat much less a turkey and it was a fantastic experience. My boyfriend's mom said it's the best turkey she's had! I bought an extra turkey and tucked it over in my freezer and will be making this again soon! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!! There was only 5 of us so we had leftovers for days and days!

This was my first turkey ever.  I had trouble with the loosening of the skin.  It was time consuming, but definitely do-able.  I baked it breast side down for the first two hours to prevent it from drying out.  Flipping it over after that was also hard but do-able.  It ended up tender and very flavorful.

This turkey recipe was the bomb! I made this turkey in college with my friends.  imagine a few young kids trying to mimick their homecooked meals cooked by their folks for thanksgiving.  the turkey was so tender and flavorful, a distinct taste that breaks away from the traditional roasted or smoked turkey.  My friend Ian told me that this turkey was better than his mom's - a kickcompliment to give to a 20 year old novice chef!!

I USED THIS RECIPE TO MAKE MY VERY FIRST TURKEY. EVERYONE LOVED IT. I'M NOT A BIG TURKEY FAN, HOWEVER I LOVED THIS ONE. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS RECIPE. IT WAS INCREDIBLY MOIST AND TENDER. I STUCK AN APPLE AND 2 ONION HALVES IN THE TURKEY FOR ADDED FLAVOR INSTEAD OF STUFFING.

This was my 1st turkey and definitely not my last! This bird not only looked beautiful but tasted unbelievable. (And that says a lot coming from me, a non-turkey fan.) It overcooked a bit because our oven was really small (I made this in Russia) and the top of the bird was nearly touching the top of the oven. We basted it every 30 minutes to try to help it. Otherwise, it was perfect. There were no leftovers (all of our guests were Russians eating turkey for the 1st time)! Next time I make it I will have a meat thermometer and a larger oven- that should take care of the problems! My husband made an incredible gravy from the remaining juices to top the turkey which more than covered the somewhat dry meat. Definitely don't let the drippings go to waste. It's the icing on the cake, so to speak!

I used this recipie for my first turkey. It turned out quite well... the meat was moist and had a nice flavor.  I used dried spices rather than fresh, and stuffed the turkey with "old fashioned giblet stuffing".

I have never ever cooked/baked a turkey before, and somehow I got volunteered into cooking one for our christmas party at work. I found this recipe and thought I'd try it..long story short, EVERYONE loved it (that managed to get any..there didn't seem to be enough to go around..they shoulda bought a bigger turkey). It came out perfect, my fiance wants me to fix a turkey just any old time so he can try it. And also it made the house smell warm and "yummy"...definately a keeper...thanx

This made a wonderfully flavored turkey for Christmas.  I used slightly more rosemary than the recipe called.  Very good.

This was good, but since you need to roast a turkey so long the flavor was not very prominent.  I will use it again, but with chicken.

This was easy!  I used my favorite dried herbs and was able to spread my figners under almost all of the skin, including the legs and thighs.  The meat was really moist and flavorful, you'll have to ask the dogs about the skin.  The leftover turkey sandwich I had today was the best, thanks!

I'm not a great fan of rosemary, so I was slightly hesitant about this recipe.  Luckily, I gave it a try anyway.  I used the marinade on a chicken and it was wonderful.  The herbs added a very subtle flavor to the bird.  Although my cookbook says to cook a chicken at 375 degrees, I stuck with the 325 degrees suggested in this recipe, and I am glad I did.  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  Great recipe!

This recipe would be great as a first time turkey.  It is elegant in flavor and appearance, however it is simple enough to have the little ones help you out on Thanksgiving or anytime.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest seasoning rub I’ve ever used! I did add pats of butter under the skin after I rubbed the seasoning all over the skin, under the skin and in the cavity. It came out so tender and juicy! My whole family loved it!!

My family usually doesn't like turkey, but they loved this! Now they want this every Thanksgiving! The only change I made was to put white wine in the bottom of the pan instead of water, and it turned out really moist.

I made the rub the night before and pureed it and allowed it so sit in the refrigerator 12 hours before applying it to the turkey as described. Delicious and moist. Drippings, giblets and a lot of the left overs with more water (that the carcass was boiled in) are now a savory soup with vegetables.

Used fresh oregano and rosemary. Turned out very moist and best tasting turkey by far!

I Followed the recipe exactly as is, It was obvious from the beginning as I was mixing the marinade up that it was going to be delicious and juicy and it was. The skin came out a little dark but the meat underneath it was tender and the bird itself was juicy. I will definitely use this recipe again and will probably use the marinade on chicken or Cornish game hens

I have been making this Turkey for Thanksgiving for years. Everyone loves it. I always get a bugger turkey So I double the oil rub. I also cover the breast with some foil 2/3 of the way through so it doesn’t get to over done. I follow the turkey package directions for how long to cook the turkey and it always turns out perfect. I cook my Thanksgiving turkey the day before Thanksgiving. Then I save all the juices and we cut up the turkey on Thanksgiving day put it in a crockpot and pour the juices back over it. It makes it moist and delicious and makes Thanksgiving day much less stressful!

We use this recipe anytime we bake a chicken. We also brine it according to another reviewer’s instructions (TRIVERT, I think). It’s always amazing, and it makes the best gravy! Make sure you plan accordingly , though, because it does have to be brined overnight.

My husband was supposed to deep fry a turkey for thanksgiving but he got called out of town. Allrecipes came to the rescue when I got stuck making the turkey.  This recipe was perfectly simple.  The turkey was nicely brown and quite moist. This will be my go to recipe every thanksgiving.

The only changes I made after reading other reviews was I used butter instead of olive oil. I covered the turkey for the first 2 hours  only. Then cooked uncovered for 2 hours. I did drizzle olive oil on the turkey when I took off the cover.  Also the final 2 hours I periodically rotated the turkey around in the oven to give it an even back.  For next time I will leave the turkey covered for first 3 hours to see that eliminates my need to rotate the turkey.  I used a 10 lb turkey.  It couldn't have been any easier or moisture. I think adding water to the pan and using butter contributed to the moistness.

This recipe  made a great holiday turkey!  The only change was that I subbed 1/2 cup of the olive oil with a melted stick of butter. Great leftovers! It made for the most delicious turkey pot pie on day 3. I will try next with chicken!

I used IAMKAY’s bribe for the turkey the night before(see in the comments) , then used this recipe and the turkey was the BEST. My grandma, mother and friends all exclaimed they’d never had such a great turkey. I was impressed with how easy it was, and the leftovers disappeared before I could grab some.

My turkeys has never tasted better. I brine my turkey the night before (citrus brine) cooking - use this recipe - then place my turkey in a roasting bag. My turkeys get demolished - hardly anything left the next day. I now have to get larger turkeys because of this recipe and overnight brine recipe.

The turkey to me was unique in taste. I normally go for my mom's Thanksgiving turkey that she makes at home which is #1 on my list. This goes for #2 on my list. Ever since I had Rosemary Chicken, I liked rosemary ever since (when used in the recipe properly). All'n All, loved it.

Delicious.  Skin was perfect to crunch!  I basted lightly 2x only.  Low temp was great for tender juicy result.  I'm a fresh vs. frozen guy.

Made the recipe exactly as written with one exception - I used two bottles of chardonnay in the bottom of the pan instead of water. Made for the most amazing gravy we've ever had! Also, just watch the turkey for browning and tent when you have your preferred color.

This was perfect!! I used it for my first turkey ever and it was amazing!  I went the first 2 hours uncovered and the last 2 hours covered.  It was juicy and perfect.  This was for a 15 pound turkey.  Thank you so much!

Very good. Easy to make and simple. Turned out nice and moist/tender. I did not use  a lot of basil, very little, as I did not want it to fight against the Rosemary as both are very strong herbs . I also just sprinkled a bit of Italian seasoning over the turkey vs adding it to the mixture,  because I wanted more of a "Rosemary" turkey! :o)

Just made this for Thanksgiving!  It was wonderful!! The whole family loved it. I have started roasting chicken and turkey but placing it breast side down, then finish it the last 45 minutes breast up. It really makes the white meat juicy.

Just made this for Thanksgiving!  It was wonderful!! The whole family loved it. I have started roasting chicken and turkey but placing it breast side down, then finish it the last 45 minutes breast up. It really makes the white meat juicy.

Made this last year for thanksgiving and I didn't even think about looking for a new recipe in the past year. This turned out amazing. It was the juiciest turkey I have ever had, and everyone loved it. The only thing I will say is that if you're looking for a crispy skin, this isn't the recipe for you. If you're okay with a good overall turkey though, I highly suggest this.

delicious made this for three thanksgivings. I use chicken stock or turkey stock instead of watewr and I also add creole butter injectable to the turkey for super juicy bird.

I made this 2 years ago and I plan on making it this year as well!  This recipe was a huge hit and it was very juicy.  I used butter and a little bit of olive oil, garlic powder, and chicken bullion.  With the additional ingredients; the flavor turned out amazing!

I tried cooking a turkey years ago with a different recipe and it was very disappointing. But my second turkey (using this recipe) was FANTASTIC! I was so proud! I followed the suggestion of others and soaked the bird in brine for 24 hours. One note (from an inexperienced turkey roaster) I don't think you are supposed to make gravy from turkey drippings that have soaked in brine. My gravy so WAY TOO SALTY! Maybe this is already a well know rule but I learned it the hard way. Anyway, the turkey was so moist and delicious that the gravy wasn't needed. I will use this recipe again!

This recipe was amazing. I have never made a turkey before. I added rosemary oil from my Young Living Oils when it had you to mix up the garlic and fresh rosemary. It turned out really moist.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This turkey recipe is on point! So are the reviews! I followed the recipe, but doubled the ingredients, and covered it for the first two hours as two others had suggested, and it was beautiful! I also stuffed the inside with  a  lg. red onion and orange (both quartered) and the rest of my fresh rosemary and  basil. Everyone went back for seconds. I will definitely make this again!

Amazing and easy! Loved it. I seasoned the turkey the night before and used thyme instead of Italian seasoning. Guests said it was the best turkey they ever had- I must have lucked out!

This was my first turkey (and I'm 52 LOL).  Here's what I did that is a little different from the recipe.  No, Italian seasoning.  1 T kosher salt in with mix of 1/4 olive oil and 1/4 cup butter and herb mixture. I mixed 1 T kosher salt with 1/2 T poultry seasoning for the cavity and put in some quartered onions and some extra rosemary.   Cooked at 350 for 4.5 hours for my 13 pound previously frozen turkey.  I mixed 1 packet of chicken broth (dissolved) into the 4 cups of boiling water.  I roasted it for the first 2 hours without foil and then covered.  Then I basted it twice, once after 3.5 hours and again after 4 hours.  Could have done sooner I'm sure.  I let it rest for 30 minutes with an extra towel over it before carving.  Served with roasted carrots, cauliflower and onions and Mom's famous stuffing.  Yum!

Love this recipe.  The brine and seasonings while roasting make such a flavorful turkey.  Do make sure to use the cup (not T) of kosher salt so the brine flavors can really soak into the turkey.  This comes from a person who doesn't salt ANYTHING!  Your turkey will not be salty if you rinse before roasting.  Do follow suggestions to pat dry and allow to sit for a couple of hours before roasting.  My entire extended family (which includes some gourmet-types) have indicated this is the best turkey they ever had...wow!!!

This is just the best way to make a really juicy, flavorful turkey. My only changes were to use 1/2 olive oil to 1/2 butter and to add fresh thyme, and sage with the rosemary and basil. i find that the mixture is easier to spread under the skin with the butter and the effect is delicious. This also works well with a roasted chicken.

I'm not a huge fan of turkey but my husband loves turkey and I also use turkey for my 1-year-old's meals.  This was very easy to make, came out absolutely yummy and lasted us a few days.  Will definitely make again!

This turkey is delicious and moist! I changed it slightly by brining it over night in a salt rub with lemons and oranges. Then stuffed apples and lemons in the cavity to cook. It turned out great!! Everyone loved it!!

First time I made a turkey in a while and it came out amazing. My husband couldn't get enough. I mixed the herbs in butter instead of olive oil and poured some white wine into the pan. Turkey came out super moist and flavorful

Great recipe! Only changed one thing because I ran out of regular olive oil. Had to use organge infused olive oil. Came out excellent but some might not like the organge flavor. Would be great with Asian chicken dish.

I got rave reviews on this turkey.  My husband who doesn't really like turkey, even said it was good!  He said it was the best smelling, best looking, and best tasting turkey he has ever had.  It smelled up the whole house while it was in the oven and no one could wait to try it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first time cooking and turkey and everything turned out great. After reading some reviews I would agree that  white wine is definitely the route to go! Everything remained moist and the seasoning was splendid.

Didn't change a thing.  I have made this dish for several large family gatherings and it always goes over very well.  The drippings make a fantastic base for gravy, and the roasting creates a very homey, comfortable smell throughout the house.

Used dried basil (less) instead of fresh and mixed with softened butter instead of olive oil.  The flavor was fantastic and I will use this again next year - so much better than a plain old turkey!  Another change was that I used cooking instructions from a different recipe, so to be fair I can't give it 5 stars.  (but based on flavor I would!)

This was a hit at my dinner party. The turkey meat was moist, just fall off the bone when it was cut and the skin was crispy. The smell of herbs and garlic was just incredible and perfect as my guests arrives, wafting through the kitchen and hall, and most of all, it's the easiest marinade recipe I've come across in a long time. An Italian friend who's a great cook had to ask me what I used on the turkey because it tasted so amazing. I basted the turkey just once an hour with its own dripping on the tray. I'll definitely repeat it next year.

Had to rate this even though it's an old post. This was the best turkey I have ever made! Moist, juicy and so flavorful!! I didn't have basil and I rubbed butter on the turkey first. My family loved it!!

Wonderful and juicy. I made this turkey as a lower sodium option for a family member with heart issues. Fearful of a bland holiday, we loved it. I used a meat injector to periodically inject the drippings as well. This will be my third year making it this way

We used butter instead of oil and we are so pleased with the result. This was an easy recipe to follow and it resulted in the best turkey we've ever had (not to mention the only one seeing as it's our first.)

I followed this recipe, but had a 10 lb turkey rather than 12lb.  Took a previous reviewer's advice and brined the turkey for 3 days and then cooking it breast side down.  Was very juicy and very flavourful. Was a bit on the salty side - next time I'll roast a bigger turkey!

I took fresh rosemary, fresh basil, freshly minced garlic, italian seasoning, s&p and olive oil and blended it thoroughly.  I'll let you know how it is blended and applied to the exterior and between the breast and skin.  Nervously hoping it is okay!

i have made similar turkey for the past 10 years. I make small slivers of fresh garlic (3-4 cloves) and equal amount of slivered butter. Strategically slip a sliver of the garlic & butter, together, under the skin until you use it all. put 2-3 cloves of garlic and 1 3-4" sprig of fresh rosemary in the cavity. roast the turkey. use the dripping to make the most amazing gravy ever!!

Roasted this for Easter dinner and it was delicious! I did not have fresh spices so I had to use dried, but the flavor was still really good. This recipe definitely needs to be fixed again!

I modified this recipe to fit a 3 pound turkey roasted that was netted when I bought it un-seasoned. With my herb garden going crazy, I totally took advantage of using the ingredients listed. I didn't place he herbs under the skin because as I stated, my turkey roast was netted and felt just compelled to rub on the outer portion verses, cutting open the net and placing under the skin. However, totally killer delicious, my turkey was very flavorful and it was a nice change from butter basting or honey brining my turkey. Will make again...a super thank you!!

This made for a wonderful Christmas turkey!  The seasonings are very coarse, so eating a piece of meat with an abundance of spices on it did have an interesting texture, but the flavor overall was superb.

I tried this last Thanksgiving - it was the first turkey I ever made and was a total hit. I did brine the turkey after reading other reviews and the turkey was very moist. I not only put the rub under the skin but also injected thicker parts of turkey with the mixture. I will be using this recipe for years to come.

I dont know why I never thought of this myself - it's easy and fabulous.  I grow my own herbs and what a perfect way to showcase them.  I dont think you could add too mamy fresh herbs to this.  And mixing them in with the EVO is OMG!  I've been roasting birds for a long time but The King proclaimed, "This is the best roast chicken I've ever had - EVER!!"

I agree with ale. White wine is the best instead of water. Putting veggies in the white wine such as onions, carrots, and celery (all in chunks) with sprigs of rosemary. Fantastic!

We used this recipe tonight for Christmas on a 7 lb turkey breast.  It was so incredible moist & delicious, and I'm not a big fan of white meat but this recipe won me over.  I stuffed the turkey cavity with fresh rosemary & onion, used only 1/4 cup oil herbs blend.  Placed turkey breast side down the first hour, Turned out Perfect.  I'm so happy I tried this recipe..Cant wait to try this with roasted chicken, and of course Turkey again.

Due to presurgical diet restrictions I needed to serve a skinless turkey breast for Thanksgiving. Slow cooking (one hour on high, six on low in the crockpot for a 7lb bone-in breast) along with this recipe allowed us to still enjoy flavorful rich-tasting turkey. The herbs and garlic smelled wonderful while cooking and still looked pretty even after so long in the pot. Thanks for sharing this recipe, everyone enjoyed it whether they needed "diet" turkey or not!

I prepared my turkey this way for this last Thanksgiving.  It was absolutely delicious!  I had a lot of family over, and everyone loved it!  Truth be told, I'm not a huge turkey fan, but it came out so moist and full of flavor, one couldn't help but love it.

I made this actually in the crock pot instead with a 3lb turkey breast. Never thought turkey could be so tender in the crock!!! It was the best turkey I ever had! I used the same technique with rubbing under the skin. Not as much skin on the breast but still worked great and flavor was awesome. I also added carrots and potatoes to the crock with a little bit of turkey broth. Took about 5 hours in the crock. Would highly recommend!!

I tried this for the first time the other night when having some family over for dinner, and everyone loved it! It keeps the turkey nice and moist and has a great flavor. I will be using this for my Thanks giving day bird for sure.

Outstanding recipe!  I often use this to prepare a turkey breast before I put it in the slow cooker (cut all ingredients in half).  Just excellent.  Occasionally, to change it up a bit, I leave out the basil & Italian seasoning - and add a pinch or two of sugar and cayenne pepper.  Seems to work with the garlic and rosemary.  I also use this "rub" on pork roasts - thanks so much for a great recipe!

This turkey is delicious. I made it for my first thanksgiving where I cooked everything myself. I had to do the turkey the day before then reheat it on Thanksgiving day after work. I just put some water in the cavity. This turkey is so flavorful and moist!

We like it spicy. We use a black pepper/olive oil injection along with this and it comes out great. We mix 1/8c fine ground pepper (not fresh ground from a pepper mill because it will clog the needle) and 1/2c olive oil. Do the rosemary rub first then inject it. Let it marinate overnight and bake-Yum! Use the carcass for "Turkey frame vegetable soup" The recipe is also found on Allrecipies.

I never made turkey until thanksgiving last year. I found this recipe and did exactly what it said. My husband and friends were very surprised that I had made a juicy turkey with mouth watering flavors that weren't too overwhelming, but just right. I made it again this year and I plan to keep making it because you can't go wrong with this great recipe. Thank you Star Pooley for making people think that I am a great cook!!

This was so good!! I cooked mine in a bag and added a few veggies (onions and celery) to the bottom as well. I had a smaller bird and I put it in a little too early since it only needed to bake 2-3 hours, so I baked it at 325 for an hour and a half and then at 250 for an hour and then up to 300 for the last hour. This was delish!

This was my first time cooking a turkey, and a little nerve racking for the holidays!!!  I found that the skin did lift very easily without breaking and the mixture spread nicely and created a good flavor.  I cooked the turkey breast side down for 2 hours, covered with foil and removed the foil for the last hour.  I think I may have removed the foil too soon as it took 4 hrs and 45 mins for the turkey to reach the right temp.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  The left overs also made great turkey salad sandwiches!!!

This turkey was so flavorful and juicy!  We used the drippings for the turkey gravy which was incredible on the mashed potatoes.  I will definately be making this turkey every Thanksgiving for several years to come.

I used this recipe yesterday and rave reviews from the family.  The turkey was incredibly moist and full of flavor.  Most said it was the best turkey they ever had. I also added rosemary sprigs, carrots, celery and garlic to the water in the roast pan.

DELICIOUS! However we used very little olive oil, just enough to create a rub with the spices. Omitted basil, since didn't have any and still fantastic. Awesome flavor, and the carcass made delicious soup!

Thanks for a great recipe!  The turkey was so moist and flavorful.  I do think that 3/4 cup oil is way too much.  I used about 1/3 cup and had some left.  We put our turkey on the grill and it worked out very well.

This made a delicious turkey!  I followed the instructions and then put the turkey in a Reynolds bag to cook.  It was juicy and the flavor really penatrated the meat and made excellent gravy.  The bag is great because it keeps the turkey moist and keeps your oven clean!

THANK YOU so much for this WONDERFUL recipe!!! I have cooked many turkeys over the years, and this was amazing. I didn't change a thing (except add a couple pats of butter before it went in) and the turkey was INCREDIBLY MOIST!!! The flavor was perfect, not to mention the way it looked; the bird turned a golden brown all over, flecked with chopped basil and rosemary. It looked like something right out of Gourmet magazine! I used a 19 lb. bird and the amount of seasonings was perfect. I was not used to all the raving reviews I got!!! This recipe will stay in my family for years - thank you.:)

I made this rub with all dried ingredients but kept amounts the same as I was coatinga 20lb. turkey.  I cooked it for about 2 hours breast side down and tented and then turned it and tented it it for another 2 hrs.  Removed foil for last 45-55mins.  Everyone LOVED the aroma, flavor, everything..it was easy and delicious!

This was my very first Turkey-I was very nervouse but found this recipe to be very easy!  I added a little Tuscany Italian Dressing to give it a little **kick** under the skin and it worked nicely. Turkey came out super moist and very flavorful from the rub mix.  I marinated it over night and then added salt and pepper over the bird before it went into the over.  I tented the bird with foil and then removed the last 30 minutes to give it a nice golden brown appearance.  My family was SHOCKED in how it looked and tasted :)  It was a home run!

Amazing!  I made the turkey according to the recipe, although I did add a foil tent for the first 2 hours and then removed it the last hour so the skin browned nicely.  Excellent flavor from the rosemary and herbs!  This was only the second turkey I've ever made and it turned out great using this recipe.  It was very easy separating the skin from the breast - so don't worry about that part!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This turkey is delicious! I was too lazy to loosen the skin, so I just rubbed the oil/herb mixture all over the bird. After it had browned nicely, I put a foil tent over the breast. The flavor was amazing, and the meat was very moist! I also used a brine recipe that is in another review (the one with the orange juice, peppercorns, etc.) and I think it definitely added to the overall flavor. Make this turkey! It's so easy and tasty.

Let me start by saying that my family does not like turkey. They loved this one. I only used the olive oil, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper and baked it in an oven bag. it was the most flavorful and moist turkey we ever had. My husband even requested it for next year already and he is major anti- turkey!

Used this to cook my first turkey ever and it was GREAT!  Family who didn't even like turkey skipped the ham and then asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1cm slices of butter in 3-4 areas between the skin and meat.

Best I've ever tasted!!  This year was my first Thanksgiving in my own place where I was responsible for the whole meal.  Never having made a turkey before, I was terrified I would "ruin" Thanksgiving, but thanks to this recipe not only did it turn out well, it was the best I've ever had!!  I followed the recipe word for word and it turned out perfectly.  Cooking breast down made a big difference too. Thanks for this recipe, I will use it for years to come. :-)

I made two turkeys for Thanksgiving this year, and used this recipe. I received such great comments. The turkey turned out SOOO moist and flavorful. I also added a couple of tabs of butter and placed that under the skin, it did seem to keep it even more flavorful. I used the drippings to make gravy and it was incredible! You won't be disappointed. Was going to brine my turkey, but decided against it, and it turned out just a moist, if not more so. Cooked a 12 pound bird at 325 for 3-4 hours, or until the temp reached 170, then took it out to allow it to continue to cook. Also poured some low sodium broth with onions and parsley over the bird before putting it in to cook. I used all fresh herbs which I think made a huge difference!

Very nice and moist turkey with a heavenly smell!!  Mixed it up the night before and adjusted amounts for a 20 lb bird.  My husband added some butter to this when rubbing the excess on top of the breast along with 1/2 cup of wine to the pan.  Wonderful recipe, made excellent gravy.  Yummy. This is a keeper, thanks!

This is my favorite turkey recipe; in fact, I am making it now.  I add some melted butter to the mix.  Separating the skin from the meat is not exactly an easy task, but neither is cooking a turkey (and it's soooo worth it).  
Instead of water at the bottom of the pan, I use a stock (usually chicken) and stuff the cavity with a cut up orange, apple, onion and some celery.  It turns out great everytime.

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving dinner years ago. It turned out excellent. I have made this every year since and everyone loves it. My husband said it was even better than his mom's turkey, and you know their hard to outdo. I also tried the recipe on a whole chicken and it was also great. Try this recipe, you wont be disappointed

I always make turkey for major holidays, and every year I stick to my own recipe. This year I decided to do something different and tried out this recipe. OMG the house smelled so good and the turkey looked beautiful. Will definitely make this again.. and again :)

I've been trying to figure out how to rate this since I made it two weeks ago.  There is nothing bad about this recipe (the turkey tasted great), but I also didn't find anything spectacular about it.  My dad makes roasted turkey by just sticking it in the oven and to me it tastes just as good.  This is a good recipe, I'm just not sure if I would use it again.

Excellent!!  I added a 1 tbs of each of these seasonings like basil, oregano, thyme, minced onion, lemon zest and savory since I didn't have Italian seasonings.  I also cooked it breast side down and flipped it breast side up the last 45 min or so.(this is how I roast my chickens) Thanks for such a great recipe.  The leftovers were just as good!!  Melt in your mouth YUMMY!

I cooked this recipe and added some of the variations from other reviewers such as:  using a Rosemary Brine Recipe and brining the turkey night before.  I also cooked the turkey upside down.  I was leary of this but with the wonderful reviews by doing this; I thought I would give it a try.  

I read to add butter under the skin, I did this sparingly, next time I would add more butter... very generously.  Even though the turkey turned out wonderful.  Many compliments came from this.  

I highly recommend using this for any dinner!

This was my first attempt at making a turkey, and it turned out pretty well, though I didn't feel that I could taste any of the herbs that I put into it. The turkey was also kindof dry, but my husband says thats how all turkey is.

Although I used a citrus brine before cooking this turkey, it ended up creating the most tender, moist, and flavorful bird I've ever had. Wonderful

Awesome! I tried this on my Thanksgiving turkey (a breast, not whole turkey). It turned out so GOOD! I was really empressed with the flavors. Going to do the same thing next year on a whole turkey!

This turned out great.  I used the Rosemary mixture to the outside of the bird and the Perfect Turkey recipe for the inside of the bird.  It was fanastic and moist.  Everyone loved it.

My brother & I have a contest every year for the best turkey.  This Turkey won hands down and it makes a wonderful gravy too. I also brined the turkey using a brine with apple juice. The flavors were incredible and there wasn't any of my 23Lb turkey left.

This was delicious!  It was juicy and had just a hint of rosemary and garlic flavors-just enoughh the flavors were not too overpowering.  We basted every 20 minutes and the 13 lb bird took about 3.5 hours to cook.  Will definitely make this turkey next year for Thanksgiving!

I made this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was excellent!  I will definitley use this recipe again next year.  Putting the olive oil and herb mixture under the turkey skin was a bit messy, but well worth the effort.  The turkey meat was very moist and flavorful.  Plus the gravy from the pan drippings had added flavor.  I doubled the recipe for a 24 pound turkey, but would only increase by 50% next time.  I think I will try roasting a chicken this way too.

I've made this turkey for the last 2 years and plan to make it today, as well... the only thing I do differently is instead of water, I use chicken broth (or if I have time I make turkey stock..) and 2 tsp. of poultry seasoning. The smell and taste is just incredible!

Perfect turkey every time!  If you're not afraid to get your hands a little messy, this is an easy & simple recipe that got the me the family title of "Martha Stewart"!  I don't change anything and have used it for 3 years straight for Thanksgiving & Christmas.

This was great! My very first turkey and everybody raved like I have been doing this for long. I brined the turkey for 24 hours, made the rub exactly like in the recipe and I injected additional olive oil in the thick parts of the bird right before roasting. Super good!!

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner.  I made it exactly as described.  It even made my gravy come out better because as you bast all of the great rub falls into the bottom of the pan.  I give it two thumbs up!

I decided to try this recipe out for Thanksgiving. I recently learned that one of the plants in our yard is rosemary, and have wanted to put it to good use. I've never really used alot of fresh herbs in my cooking, but will now do so more often. What a great turkey! It was moist, juicy and had fabulous flavor! I roasted mine in a cooking bag, just because that's the way I always roast my turkey and it turned out great! I have never tasted such delicious turkey. My husband thought the rosemary was a little too strong ( he is very picky) but did like it. Next time I will use less rosemary to please him, but I'm quite sure it will still be delicious. Thanks Star!

I have never cooked a turkey before, and this turned out great, moist and flavorful, even after reheating the next couple of days!  I followed the instructions exactly, will definitely try this on a chicken the next time.  Thank you for sharing.

This was an awesome recipe.  The turkey was so incredibly moist and tender.  I followed the recipe to a tee, except that I mistakenly bought fresh thyme instead of rosemary, but it was delicious anyway.  The gravy from the drippings was the best I ever had.  I will use this recipe again.

This was my first time rubbing under the skin of the turkey, and it was amazing. I did also brine it for the first time, so I'm not sure if one contributed more than the other, but this was the best turkey I have ever eaten. SO moist, and we've had a couple days worth of leftover too by now - my husband thinks they might be better than the original!

We tried this for Thanksgiving.  The folks who say they're not big Turkey fans said this was by far the best Turkey they've ever had and even asked for the leftovers.  I will be making this again and again.  I'm going to try this with chicken

I used sage instead of rosemary and stuffed the turkey with an apple and onion. The smell of the turkey, soon after I put it in the oven, was so good, I knew it would turn out delicious and couldn't wait til it was done. It turned out moist and the family loved it.

This turkey was very good, but the herbs weren't as strong as I anticipated.  I don't think that the work of seperating the skin was worth it.

It was my first time roasting a turkey and it was the best turkey I've ever had.  I double the ingredients for a 20 lb turkey.  I rubbed the herbs on the night before, put the turkey in the roaster bag and let it absorb the flavors overnight.  We also had a large honeybaked ham (Which is my family's favorite).  There was plenty ham left, but the 20 lb. turkey was completely gone.

This was the first Turkey I ever made. I followed the recipe exact and also brined it the night before. It was easy too getting under the skin. I put some veggies on the side of the roasting pan which tasted so good with this marinade. Everyone loved it, it was so moist and flavourful.

Turned out fantastic!  We had a 12lb turkey and I doubled the seasoning amounts.  I basted every 30-45 minutes and it turned out VERY moist and flavorful.  My mom gave me a tip and I used unwaxed dental floss to sew up a rip in the skin and the main opening.  Everyone in the family was thrilled with the results.

I was amazed how easy this was.     I had to use dried herbs as fresh was not available and it turned out so perfect.   All my guests enjoyed it and my 3 year old picky eater as well as my 22 year old picky eater.      Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This turkey came out wonderful! While the garlic flavor was potent (possibly too strong for those who aren't used to the taste), it added a nice flavor to the meat!

The turkey came out moist, flavorful, and the stuffing had an extra kick to it with all the extra spices!

And the leftovers have been wonderful as sandwiches and as turkey salad!

Like many of the previous reviews, I am a novice when it comes to roasting a turkey.  This recipe really is very simple!  The key really is to use fresh herbs and not substitute them with dried herbs.  The aroma was amazing from start to finish and the turkey was incredibly moist!  I recommend this recipe to everyone!

This was a great recipe.  My very first time cooking a turkey and it came out great.  The only change was that I used dried rosemary. I'll be trying this again.

This was FANTASTIC. I will be keeping it for next Thanksgiving. It did take a long time to cook, but I think that's my oven's fault. I probably should not have basted it every 1/2 hour. I did use the foil tent which kept it from getting too brown. Great recipe!

This is fantastic!  I've tried a new turkey recipe every year from this site and I think this one takes the cake.  Even my hubby doesn't like those types of herbs but he helped finish all of the leftovers!  I was a little worried that the gravy from the juices would be overwhelming so I added a 1/2 cup of merlot and it was great!  I'd recommend this to anyone and its very easy to make.  I also added a split in half apple to the core to keep the moisture and basted toward the end of cooking.  Good luck!

OK, but won't probably make again.  I didn't have the fresh herbs so used dried, which I think was the problem.  We also used a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey.  It was moist.

I didn't actually get to taste this turkey (I'm a vegetarian), but my friends and family just raved over the flavor and moistness of this turkey. I do admit, it smelled wonderful and I will surely use this next year. Thanks! :-)

Made this for my very first Thanksgiving and it was so easy and tasted great. Many compliments from everyone in my family on the moistness and flavor. I cooked it breast side down and turned it over the last 30 minutes - that was hard work being that it was an 18 lb. turkey but we managed. I also added the pats of butter under the skin. One added bonus - after putting the olive oil rub under the skin and on top, my hands were soft for days! When else could you get a manicure while cooking?!

This was a big hit for my first Thanksgiving dinner!  I was surprised at how easy it was to make, and it came out looking like it belonged on the cover of a magazine!  I will definitely make this again.

This is the first recipe I've rated.  I just wanted to say how great it iturned out.  It was my first turkey.  The color was beautiful and the taste was savory.  We brined it overnight first and followed the recipe.  We also turned the turkey over toward the end of the cooking time.  The gravy was also really good.  We just mixed soy sauce, oyster sauce, and cornstarch with the turkey drippings (after getting rid of excess oil).  Yummy!

So, this is the first turkey I've made... ever, and everyone loved it. :) I had my bf, his parents, my best friend and her husband, and two other friends over for thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe as written except I added the use of a turkey roasting bag. This cut down on cooking time by nearly 1.5 hours and still kept the bird very moist.

I was very happy :)

I used the fresh rosemary and basil as suggested. I could have used fresh oregano to complete the Italian seasoning, but I didn't think about buying it fresh until I started to make the rub. I used butter instead of oil and marinated the turkey over night. One thing I didn't think about was that the butter hardened after I rubbed it on the turkey. Some of the butter and herb mixture cracked and fell off. Maybe next time I'll try the olive oil. Anyway everyone loved it. It was the second turkey I've ever cooked.

My turkey did not come out as great as everyone elses.  Maybe the turkey was too big. I used a 26lb bird and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  I have faith in this recipe so I will try it on cornish game hens next time.

We made this recipe with a fresh organic turkey and everyone said it was the best turkey ever!  We used thyme instead of basil and it was delicious.  Even though it was a 32 pound turkey, this recipe was fantastic.  Thanks!

For some reason the turkey was not as moist inside, I don't know if lifting the skin off has something to do with it?  But the turkey tasted delious anyway!

I tried this recipe last year, for my first solo flight of preparing a Thanksgiving meal, and it was a hit! I basted the hell out of it while it was cooking and also put an aluminum foil tent over the bird while it cooked and it turned out fantastic. I'll be doing the same this year. :)
