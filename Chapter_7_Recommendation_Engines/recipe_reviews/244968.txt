I am addicted to this and I don't even like yogurt! I add extra of everything but otherwise make no changes. Vitacost has the best price on goji berries but I used cranberries until they arrived.

This is a nice combination of flavours. I didn't have blueberries so I used whatever forest fruits I had on hand. The amounts were a good balance between sweet, tart and texture. Thanks for the recipe!

Nice change of pace from my usual plain yogurt, berries and flaxseed. I used the cook's tip and ground the nuts in my coffee grinder. I couldn't find gogi berries so I skipped those. Tasty and healthy!

There are many reasons I like this. It's easy, it's healthy, and you can make it ahead of time for a quick morning fuel up. Aside from that, it tastes very good. I use wallet pieces and almond slivers to give it a crunch for texture.
