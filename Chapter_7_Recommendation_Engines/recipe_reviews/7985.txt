I thought this recipe was excellent.  I don't understand some reviewers changing the recipe around and then rating it based on the changes.  It should be rated on the original recipe--that's what people are reading.

Looking for something to make with blueberries, I came across this recipe, one I've been making exactly, for over 40 years. I have never found it necessary to change it at all. It is moist, bursting with berries, with a beautiful streusel topping. For me to repeat a recipe as I have with this one, for more times than I could ever count, speaks volumes about this wonderful cake.  Another example of how perfection needn't be tinkered with.

I double the recipe and use a 9 x 13 pan.  I don't double the fruit, though.  I use 2 cups of fruit for a 9 x 13 pan, there's still tons of fruit in the cake.  I've also used raspberries, huckleberries, and black berries in this recipe, all of which came out great!  Just make sure you toss the fruit in a tablespoon or so of flour before adding them to the recipe, that way the fruit will not sink to the bottom.  These are best served with vanilla ice cream and a few berries sprinkled on top.

My friends raved about this blueberry treat and my husband devoured it. I substituted butter for shortening, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, cut the flour to 1-1/2 cups and cooked it for 40 minutes. It was delicious!

This was very good-the crumb topping alone was sooo delicious.  I took in all the reviews and this is what I came up with.   I used butter instead of shortening, added in 2tsp vanilla, used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/4 heavy cream 1/4 milk for the liquid for a richer flavor(can also use 1/2 cup sour cream instead which makes it very tasty too).  As far as the topping- I as well used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 white sugar. I don't think you need to add any extra blueberries-there was plenty.  It is a very heavy batter so don't be fooled when you can't pour it into the pan-just spoon it in and spread it around.  Does take like 50+ minutes to bake-so keep checking the middle til your knife comes out clean.  Def a keeper!  If making for a larger crowd..double and bake in a 13x9 inch pan for 1 hour.

After reading previous reviews, I used only 1 1/2 c. flour, substituted half butter for the shortening, and added some vanilla (1-2 tsp.)  It was wonderful!  My husband always eats my treats with a big glass of milk - but he said he didn't even need it with this buckle because it was so moist and light.  I also cooked it on 350 instead of 375 for about 40 minutes - remove it when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out completely clean!

Great recipe :)

I did not care for this recipe. I don't understand why everyone gives this recipe a high rating but then writes in the review that they made a million modifications. I made the mistake of following the recipe to a T and it ended up taking over an hour to cook (the edges burned while the middle was still soggy after the hour,) the crumb mixture was more like a paste and the total outcome was a dry mess of a what should be a blueberry buckle. I certainly won't follow this recipe again, but I will try one like it with all the modifications in place. Please people, don't give recipes a 5 star rating if you made any kind of modification to it, that is very misleading!!!!

GREAT!  That's what my husband said when I asked him how it was!  Definitely don't skimp on the berries!  That's what makes it so moist.  I did add a tsp. of vanilla and used butter instead of shortening, but I beat the batter with an electric mixer (up to the berries) and used all two cups of flour when I alternated the adding of the milk and flour.  It raised beautifully in an 8x8 pan and the top crumb crust was lovely.  I baked it for 45 min.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe AS IS. I can understand changing things like brown sugar in place of white sugar for the topping, but the amount of flour, the use of shortening, etc. are essential components of the recipe and if changed, it becomes an entirely different recipe. This cake is just perfectly soft, moist, and delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and amazing blueberry flavor. A lot of people have stated that the blueberries sink to the bottom, but a lot of those same people thinned out the batter by reducing the amound of flour. This batter is supposed to be very thick, as that's what holds up the blueberries, and trust me the finished cake is not lacking in moisture AT ALL. That's probably due to the shortening, so if you used butter instead, you changed the recipe and ended up with a drier cake and blamed it on the flour :O Stick with the recipe and you'll do fine. The only thing I had to do differently was double the baking time. I did dredge the blueberries in flour just in case, but I doubt they would've sunk either way. Add some flaked coconut or lemon zest to this cake for a yummy variation.

After reading through reviews, I made  several changes that resulted in very yummy results: Decreased flour to 1-2/3 cup, added 1 tsp almond extract to the milk before mixing it all in, used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar (instead of 1/2 cup of just white sugar), and melted the butter.  I also doubled the ingredients and baked in a 9x13 pan at 375 degrees for 40 minutes, then turned it off and let it sit for another 15 minutes.  The almond extract complemented the blueberry flavor perfectly, and the smell was divine.  The use of melted butter and brown sugar also made the topping nice and crunchy.  I brought it to a potluck so it was still a bit warm from the oven, and it got rave reviews.

This is a great recipe for fresh blueberries.  I took the advice of the other reviews and used 1 1/2 cups of flour, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the topping.  I also extended the baking time by about 10 minutes.  Very Yummy!

I made it just the way the recipe says. No changes although I did use frozen blueberries. It turned out very good. HOWEVER: there is no way this was cooked in 25 minutes at 375. No possible way. I think the author needs to correct this. It takes at least 45 minutes in a 8x8 pan. It is so thick and dense and moist... I kept checking mine every 5-7 minutes for 3 or 4 times past 25 minutes.

I give it 4 stars as written, but 5 stars with some minor changes:
I doubled the recipe EXCEPT for the amount of blueberries (it was plenty) and used 3c flour instead of 4.  Also substituted brown sugar for half the total sugar in both the batter and the topping, and used half and half instead of milk.  Baked for a little less than an hour.  With these modifications, it's a delicious, moist, yummy cake!

I had a lot of blueberries in my fridge and needed to use them up.  I made this as an afternoon snack and it turned out delicious!!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and only used 1-1/2 cups of flour.  I used buttermilk in place of the milk and added a splash of vanilla extract.  After 30 minutes of baking, the sides were getting brown, but the center wasn't quite set.  I layed a peice of foil over my baking dish and lowered the oven temp by 10 degrees.  I let it cook about another 10 minutes and it was done.  This is definitely a cross between a coffee cake and a blueberry muffin.  This was a great way to use up my blueberries.  Thanks Janice.

I wish I could give it 6 stars!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and substituted the 1/4 cup shortening with half stick butter (save the other half stick for the topping). I baked in a 13 x 9 inch pan and although it did not seem like enough batter, it rose beautifully (I admit I added one extra egg, so two eggs total). I did not change the quantity of any of ingredients. The only step I recommend changing is to sprinkle the blueberries on top and pat down rather than stir them in. This way, the blueberries stayed intact and the cake stayed white rather than being discolored from the berries. This is a GREAT cake base and I am sure, any fruit will work with this (ex, apples, peaches, other berries, etc)

This was great as-is ... I wouldn't change a thing.  I will say that the dough seemed thicker than it should be, so that it wouldn't "pour" into the pan. We patted it down evenly in the baking pan and everything turned out great.

Very good comfort cake. I enjoyed it in the morning. Key is to make sure you use fresh blueberries. After washing them I shook the blueberries in a flour and sugar mixture before adding them to the batter. With the batter being to dry, I added in about 1/4 cup of applesauce to the batter and it seemed to improve taste and texture. I also buttered the sides of the pan and coated it with a cinnamon and sugar mixture before pouring my batter into the pan. This leaves a great finishing crust to the sides of the cake. Finishing I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and cut the topping with a pastry cutter before sprinkling. 
Thanks for sharing.

Took other's advice used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar in the cake and split the sugar 1/4 cup brown 1/4 cup white for the topping and I used butter for the shortening in the cake.  It came out great.  It did have to bake a full 48 minutes so the time is off like everyone says.  Thanks for all the tips, it saved me a lot of time and money :).

Delicious.... I really like the taste, not too sweet.  Mine took 50 minutes to bake, maybe because I used frozen blueberries. I used butter,  added a tsp of vanilla and half a tsp cinnamon in the batter.  I will be making this again.   Thanks for this great recipe....

This was super! Only thing I changed was using butter for the shortening and decreasing the flour to 1.5 cups. I used frozen blueberries that I thawed, dried, and coated in flour. Mine took about 40 minutes to bake. I let the butter for the topping get a little too soft, so the topping melted more into the cake, so make sure your butter is pretty cold.

This is a very good recipe! I was craving for some type of blueberry dessert and this definitely hit the spot! I didn't change a thing.. although I did have to cook it about 5 minutes longer than what was put since the top didn't look done at all. Overall a great recipe. It's also best when it's straight out of the oven =)

I followed the recipe as stated and the taste of shortening was overpowering.  We threw it out.  Next time I'll try again and substitute butter.
*** I'm changing my rating to 4 stars because I made this again with butter and it's fabulous!  Don't use shortening!

This is one of the MOST DELICIOUS recipes I have yet to pick up off of this site. I stuck with the recommended shortening for the cake part of this recipe, as I believe it produces a much lighter, melt-in-your mouth texture. Reduced the flour amount to 1-1/2 cup and added the 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Used half light brown sugar for the topping. My goodness, I wish I could get fresh blueberries all year round, just to be able to eat this more often! Thank you so much for this recipe, Janice.

I used frozen raspberries instead of the blueberries and it was really good!  I think the topping is what makes it too good...hard to stay out of!  I also had to add more milk (or reduce flour) and I like to bake cakes at 350F and , with the addition of frozen berries, the bake time was between 50 and 55 minutes.
This was very good warm with vanilla ice cream.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (as I always do the first time around) and it was excellent.  Nice weight, balance of sweetness, and wonderfully moist.  All of my workmates agreed and that rarely happens.  Work both as a coffee cake or after dinner treat.  I used a nonstick 9x9 enameled ceramic pan as it was the only pan available at the time.  Even with the larger pan, it rose just above the edge.  Again, a winner recipe just as written.

This was very good and brought back memories.  Nice crumb, not too sweet, light and moist, this was a lovely and easy dessert. It would be great with other fruit, such as peaches or apples, or even another berry. Perfect served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

We loved this.  I made it with frozen blueberries, so it took much longer to cook, (about 13-15 extra minutes in total) but still came out moist and delicious.  Next time I may try adding some cardamom to the batter for a little extra flavor in the cake itself.  Yum!

Awesome recipe! We could not stop eating this. I followed recipe and am oh sooooo happy with the results. I do not have a sweet tooth and still found this wonderful. This will be the "go-to" recipe for a nice addition to a brunch or for dessert. You can not go wrong, just follow the recipe!

Yummy and easy!  I had some wild blueberries to use, and was looking for something good to make.  So glad I tried this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, which I think you should do if you are going to review a recipe.  I figure if you don't like something, you can change it next time.  No changes needed!  Very moist and tasty, nothing too fussy.  Simple ingredients, simple preparation, and simply good!  I did have to bake it longer. I tested it at the designated time with a toothpick, and it was quite doughy. I baked it an extra 10 minutes, that did the trick.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

July/07, This is really good, should be made with fresh blueberries though and it won't turn out so juicy. I don't understand how other people make changes to the recipe then base their starts on their changes, that has always baffled me.  I used real butter instead of shortening.  Quite a few viewers decreased the amount of flour to 1 1/2 cups but you don't have to, you just have to increase the milk to 3/4 cup then the batter isn't so thick :-)  Thanks for the recipe, it's wonderful and smells so good when baking.  I am a Nova Scotia girl and there is a little place in Nova Scotia that is the blueberry capital of the world called Oxford.

I have made blueberry buckle for years, and this recipe is similar to mine, with one major difference - folding in the blueberries rather than sprinkling them on top, and using a smaller pan.  What a delightful difference! The berries are more evenly distributed, and the cake is fluffier.  I'll make it this way from now on.

I just made this recipe for the first time yesterday to the letter, since it is fresh blueberry season here in Nova Scotia i had fresh blueberries right from the field,it was good however if i make it again i will put less sugar and butter than what the topping called for because both my hubby and myself found it too sweet and greasy, i probably will remake it but will less of those two ingrediants because it took away from the blueberry taste, but overall it wasn't bad!

This is the most perfect coffee cake I've ever made. I followed the recipe just as written, my shortening was the butter flavored kind that I need to use up from Christmas. This cake is so moist and rose up just beautifully. I'm not big on cakes, they usually are too dry and sweet for me, but this was just the right amount of sweetness, and the blueberries are in every bite. The crunchy topping is wonderful..there really is no need to top with anything, but our guest has some whipped cream, and that was great too. I will keep this as my to go to coffee cake recipe from now on.

Very good!  I ooubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 45 minutes.  Turned out great.  Would suggest this for breakfast or brunch.  I did follow the suggestions of the other reviewers made these changes:
1.  Cut down the flour to 1 1/2 cups 
2.  Used butter instead of shortening
3.  Dusted blueberries with flour just before adding them to batter
4.  Used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar for topping
5.  Added 1 t. vanilla

This tasted good, but I will definitely make a change.  There was way too much flour in this recipe.  The batter was so thick that there was no "pouring" into the pan about it!!  I will start with 1 1/2 cups next time and add more if needed.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the topping ingredients, BIG mistake.  It turned out as hard as a rock!  The topping that was actually "attached" to the cake was very tasty and not quite as hard.  Also, I had to bake it for 55 minutes to get a toothpick to come out clean.  I used frozen blueberries and they were fine.  Overall good tasting, though.

I tried this recipe and followed it to a "t". My oven works just fine and I used all the right ingredients. My cake came out of the oven gooey and underdone in the center and crispy on the outside. That is when I used a dark metal non-stick pan. Just a warning for anyone else trying this recipe. After trying it again at 350 degrees for 30min it came out tasting quite delicious. But I'm unimpressed at the original baking temperature and time.

Used butter-flavored shortening & added about a 1/4C milk, but other than that, left the recipe as is. Batter WILL be thick, so you'll have to spoon (rather than pour) the mixture into the baking dish. Also, took more like 35 minutes for mine to finish baking.  Delicious, especially with a glass of cold milk! :)

I made this exactly as written and it is very good!  No changes necessary!  At first I thought the amount of blueberries sounded excessive, but I put all two cups in anyway and I’m glad I did.  Very good with a cup of coffee, or even better with whipped cream and a cherry, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert!  YUM!  UPDATE 8/21/12: I made this again and used butter instead of shortening.  I noticed this time that it took 37 minutes in my oven to test done.  Still YUM!

I followed the other recommendations of using butter instead of shortening and also baked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the crumble mixture.  It came out wonderful - very light and fluffy.

Turned out great and great tasting too! I added 1 tsp of vanilla as others have suggested and also used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries because that was all I had.  I also used butter instead of shortening. I had no problems baking it at 375 for nearly 30 minutes.  I used melted butter for the topping but next time I will use softened butter because I think the topping was crunchy instead of crumbly.  Very nice overall - will definitely make again!

We had it for breakfast-- I don't think I'd ever made a coffee cake for breakfast-- and my kids were ecstatic to have cake for breakfast!  I used butter instead of shortening in the cake batter and chopped frozen strawberries instead of blueberries.  We loved it!  I think next time I will add vanilla to the batter and use brown/white sugar for the crumb topping.  I may add a bit more flour too to the crumb topping to make it more crumbly.  A keeper!!!

This was wonderful!  The best cake I've had in a long time.  As others suggested, I used only 1 1/2 cups flour, butter instead of shortening, and more brown sugar than white.  Also I added one teasoon of vanilla and one of almond extract.  I added 20 minutes to the baking time too.  Oh, and I used two knives to cut up the topping ingedients to make them nice and crumbly.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I tried this recipe today and it was delicious!  This one is definitely a keeper!  I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and baked it for 10 minutes longer.  Instead of using 1/2 cup of white sugar for the topping, I reduced it to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

YUMMY!  My kids are begging to have it again.  I used frozen blueberries and cooked it for 35 minutes (after reading other reviews).  Center wasn't as done as the edges but wasn't doughy either and was my daughter's "favorite" part.

Absolutely delicious!  However, the center will not be done if the directions are followed (even though a toothpick comes out clean).  Increase baking time by ten minutes, but keep an eye out.  Use butter-flavored shortening or butter, and it's tastier.

Talk about a hubby pleaser! I have made this recipe about 10 times now and all our friends love it.  I followed advice and reduced the flour, substituted butter for shortning, changed the cooking instructions and added vanilla.  We are wheat intolerant so I use spelt flour and it still comes out great.  I have also tried frozen organic berries and its just as good.

I've made this recipe twice now and aside from adding a tsp of almond extract I wouldn't change a thing to the ingredients, although I did have to cook it for about 40 minutes before the center was done.  I love the crusty topping, and there are so many blueberries it can't help but be moist...a keeper for the occasional brunch or to serve a la mode for dessert :)

I followed the directions (although I did use a combination of brown and white sugar) and my family loved it! My husband did suggest less of the "cake." 

Next time I will follow the advice of others and add vanilla and cut back on the flour. Also, don't cut back on the topping or the blueberries....they are the best!!

I prepared this recipe as directed, and it came out fantastic! The only thing missing was the Dream Whip. This dessert also has the 'some more' taste. When you finish the first piece, you will want some more! You have been warned! :)

OMG this  tasted very close to the way my dear friend Faun made her buckle when she brought it to church on Sundays. I added the zest and juice of a fresh lemon and cut down on the sugar. Next time I will add more blueberrys.

I love this recipe and have made it several times since 2004.  But I am always looking for ways to make recipes a little healthier.  So...I reduced shortening to only 1 tablespoon, substituted low-fat buttermilk for the milk (needed to use a little more to get the batter the right consistency), added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and swapped 2/3 cup of all-purpose flour for 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also reduced the heat to 350 degrees and cooked it for 45 minutes.  Pretty good if I say so myself!  Next time I make it, I am going to reduce the amount of topping and use brown sugar instead of the white.

This is exactly the same as my grandmother's blueberry recipe except for that hers uses brown sugar in the topping instead of white. This is an awesome cake. It's a favorite in my family and among my friends.

8.1.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7985/blueberry-buckle/ ... Almost identical to Better Homes & Gardens recipe.  Not bad, but not a one I'll see again.  Blueberry Buttermilk Coffeecake is awesome.  Awesome.

Wonderful! This has been in my recipe box for some time waiting for blueberries to come in season; well worth the wait! I usually opt for similar recipes with buttermilk, sour cream or cream cheese, so I was particularly thrilled that this recipe does just fine without any of 'em. Made this as directed, altho the cooking time for mine was 48 minutes. Also, the word "pour" had me running back to the recipe looking for which liquid ingredients I must've left out. The batter is thick, and "plops" rather than "pours." Nevertheless, a definite repeater for us. Thank you so much, JBS Box for sharing!!

Mine took a little longer to bake than listed.  Use this recipe when you have fresh blueberries.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Very good recipe.

Have made this twice now - once with fresh blueberries, once with frozen blueberries.  Both times, the taste was GREAT with the only noticeable difference being the frozen berries' purple colored batter.  The only change made was using butter in place of the shortening and using half white and brown sugar for the topping.  Very yummy (not super sweet) treat!!!!

Excellent. I did have to bake it longer than stated, about 45 minutes. It came out tender and very good. This one is a keeper.

We enjoyed this Blueberry Buckle recipe. I folded 1/2 the blueberries into the batter . Putting the remaining blueberries on top the batter pressing them in slightly. I didn't use 1/2 cup sugar for the topping. We used 1/4 cup sugar & 1/4 cup packed brown sugar . The center was very gooey after 30 minutes so we needed to bake 10 minutes longer . Great thanks.

I made this recipe for a playdate and everyone loved it.  It has a great flavor and is so easy to make.  I used butter instead of shortening, a mixture of strawberries and blueberries based on what I had in the house, and it took almost 45 minutes to cook through in the middle.  I will be making this one again and again.

I loved this recipe but made a few changes for fun and liked them:  Instead of mixing the blueberries in the batter, I poured them in between two layers of batter, so they were like a pudding in the center. Doubled the crumble topping because, let's face it, that's what everyone likes! Then, I cooked it a little longer, like 40 or so, because the middle wasn't done. Mmmm!

This is "The Best!". Follow this recipe exactly because it turned out great. The ONLY recommendation is to watch your cook time. Cooking this in an 8X8 pan for 25-30 minutes is not enough. I'd give it 40+ minutes. Just be sure to check it with a toothpick. Aside from the extra cooking time needed, this Blueberry Buckle recipe is better than store bought or anything else Ive had! Totally de-lish!

I have been using this recipe for years and was pleased to find it on Allrecipes. Watch the cooking time, this buckle tends to need at least 40-45 minutes in my oven. I also add at least 10 minutes to my cooking time if I am using frozen blueberries.

Made this for our first annual Ourtabletalk.com gathering out in Ohio. Took ~Taylor's~ advice and cut back on the flour and upped the crumb topping. Delicious and thank you!!

This JUST came out of the oven and I can't begin to explain how good this is!  I followed everyones sugestion by going with 1 1/2c flour (I used whole wheat pastry flour) but also used xylitol instead of sugar.. Incredible flavor, so light and cake like!

Ok.  Used butter instead of shortening.  For the 3/4 cup of sugar, I used 1/4 cup of brown and 1/2 cup of white.  I added about 1/2 tsp or maybe a little more to the sugar-egg-butter mixture.  Decreased baking soda by about 1/2 tsp and only used a healthy dash of salt.  Added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries.  In the topping, used an extra tbsp of butter, and used 1/4 of brown and 1/4 cup of white sugar.  Increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Decreased temp to 350 for the first 20 min, then upped it to 375 for the last 7-10 min.  CAME OUT BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS, GOLDEN BROWN, PERFECTLY SWEETENED BUT NOT TOO SWEET.  I have made this two days in a row...wonderful and easy :)

Really yummy and leaves the house smelling sooo good!  It tastes just like a blueberry muffin with delicious sweet topping!

I followed the recipe as follows using the full 2 cups of flour but adding one teaspoon vanilla.  I opted to use half white and half brown sugar for the crumble topping since I love the taste of brown sugar.  I didn't have a problem with the blueberries sinking to the bottom- as a precaution, I did mix the blueberries with 1 tablespoon flour just to be safe before adding them to the batter.  It took about 40 minutes in the oven for it to cook completely.

Very yummy; will make again!

Even though I have never actually tasted this myself, I made it for a bake sale and people raved about it. By the way it smelled when it was baking, I knew it was a keeper. These are the changes I made: 1 1/2 cup flour instead of 2, 1 t vanilla, and for the topping I used 1/4 cup brown and white sugar each. I tossed my blueberries in 1 T of flour before adding them to the mixture. And I baked it for 50 minutes. AMAZING.

Very good! I added only 2/3 cup of sugar and it was enough, actually the topping was way too much sweetness so next time I wont add that. Perhaps more blueberries?

I used butter rather than shortening, reduced the flour to 1.5c on the advice of other reviewers, and used half white sugar, half brown sugar in the topping. I also coated the blueberries in flour, per another reviewer, to keep them from sinking (they didn't sink!).  I didn't know what a "buckle" was, but now I do...it looks like coffee-cake and tastes like a blueberry muffin.  It turned out very nicely.

Oooooooooh...this is so, so good!  I love blueberries and this is absolutely one of my new favorites!  Made a couple of changes for personal preference...used half white sugar, half brown sugar...butter instead of shortening...added a tsp. of vanilla...and left out the cinnamon.  This was amazing!!!

I have made this recipe for years, but a little differently: for the topping, I do not use white sugar,I use .5 cup brown sugar. The batter itself does come out thick, but just spread it into a 9x13 inch pan and cook at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 min. It is perrrrfect :)

Delicious.  I read the reviews before I made it so made some of the same changes.  1/4 cup butter instead of shortening.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla along with the milk.  1 1/2 cup flour instead of 2 cups.  And for the topping 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup br. sugar instead of 1/2 cup sugar.  I put it in an 8 x 11 pan and cooked for 35 minutes.

Very very good! Like other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups of flour and just a pinch more. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for the topping. I was a tad skeptical about the cinnamon in the topping - I can't help but associate cinnamon with apples - but I decided to go with it anyway, and I am very glad I did. We had this with warm with a scoop of Cool Whip and some left-over blueberries. This is definitely comfort food, but also elegant enough to serve to company. Thanks so much, Janice!

I used butter instead of shortening, reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and used part brown sugar in place of half the white sugar. I also used about a cup more blueberries. It was excellent. I plan to try this with apples and cranberries as a thanksgiving dessert when blueberries go out of season.

This cake was very moist and I loved the crumble on top!  I made a few changes: instead of using shortening I used butter.  For the 1/2 cup milk I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup half and half.  For the berries I used 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup strawberries, plus they were frozen.  For the Cinnamon in the crumble topping, I increased it to 1 tsp.

I made this for dessert tonight and it was a hit! The only thing I changed was substituted butter for shortening. It was bursting with blueberries and the topping was crunchy. It wasn't overly sweet which was nice for a change. Goes great with a cup of coffee either for breakfast or after dinner. Thanks for a great recipe and a great way to use fresh blueberries, especially when they're in season!

I've made this twice now, and love it! But I did cook it much longer than 30 min. I cooked it for a full 45 min. at 350 with a convection oven!

For one, this will make your house smell AMAZING. I don't like blueberries, but this makes me love them. The cake is moist, the top is crunchy with margerine or crusty with butter. (I made both) Only change I made was a teeny bit less flour (1/2 cup?) and I added vanilla. Also tossed the blueberries in flour before I put them in.

Following the recipe closely (except used butter for shortening), the resulting batter was so stiff, I couldn't STIR in the  blueberries into the batter, as  the directions instructed.

Baking time was also too long at 25 minutes.  The cake came out quite hard.

I made this and after reading a few reviews and people complaining it was bland this is what I did. I double it. except I used 3 cups self rising flour, and of course did not add baking powder. I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter. I used 2 teaspoons Vanilla and a Teaspoon Orange zest. I also used frozen blueberries from last summer. I also doubled the topping but only used 1/2 as it was too much and wanted to cut back on the sugar. I also had to cook it about 10 minutes longer. It came out light and airy.

Gone within a day in a household of 5! This recipe was so easy and amazing. Everyone loved it. Only problem was I only got to enjoy one small piece. Recipe was perfect as is; nothing needs to be changed unless you need to take into account humidity, altitude, or bad oven. FANTASTIC Cake

This was easy to make, but I wasn't really pleased with the results. My husband is enjoying it, but I feel it is a little too dry and lacks flavor.  I made it exactly as stated.  Sorry it didn't work for me.

First off, I followed it EXACTLY as stated... overall it was good.  I wish I used vanilla to give it a hint of flavor.  It tastes more like a breakfast cake than a dessert.  It is a little dry, I wish it was more moist.  The topping is very good.  I rarely give 3 stars, but I don't think it is quite good enough for 4 stars.  I'll try another recipe next time.

I made this as a dessert and it went over SO very well - a coworker asked for the recipe to make for a party, and she said it was a hit there too! A nice, light lemon glaze went over this to make it a little more dessert-like. I used butter in place of shortening... what a pretty treat!

This was easy and quick.  To eat and make!!  Only change was a personal preference which was using butter instead of shortening.  The only issue I had was having to use more milk then what the recipe called for.  I probably added at least a whole cup of milk.  Baked it a little longer and it was perfect.  Enjoy!

Tasty and moist and not overly sweet.  Next time, though, I will try substituting butter for shortening or maybe half of each, because we do like the taste of butter.  Thanks!

I also doubled the recipe (including the fruit)and used a 9x13 butter greased glass pan. I love cinnamon so I tripled the amount called for (1 tbsp total) in the topping.

This was fantastic. The top tasted like the top of a Drake's coffee cake. I expected more of a coffee cake texture, but it was so moist, it could easily serve as a standalone dessert. Leftovers have remained moist for at least a couple days since.

This one is a keeper - might just replace the blueberries with different seasonal fruits throughout the year.

Made this yesterday and it was a hit. It smelled insane as it was baking and the taste did not disappoint. I followed the recipe exactly. No need to add or change anything. It was moist and an 8x8 pan was the perfect size. The crumbs were delicious too. This was the frst time I ever used shortening. I was going to change to butter but I'm glad I tried the original way. Have extra blueberries, will be making again tomorrow! Enjoy!

I made this and it turned out amazingly-- definitely something I'll be making again! I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers to replace the shortening with butter and add a splash of vanilla.... I also replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with whole wheat flour. Delicious recipe!

This was Awesome! I only added 1tsp of cinnamon, but other than that recipe remained the same. I did(completely by accident!!) use an entire stick of butter instead of a 1/2 stick for the topping but it was still delicious! I won't do it that way again, but it was worth it, as I usually put extra butter on it when I eat baked goods. I coated the blueberries with cornstarch so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. All in all- AWESOME!

Delicious!  A little of this goes a long way in the belly!  :)  I made it exactly as is, except that many of the ingredients I used are not the usual (i.e. used organic palm shortening, Himilayan salt, raw milk/butter, ect...)  I doubt that made a huge difference, but either way, it tasted great!  It also took longer to cook, so I baked for about 45 minutes.  This one is a keeper in the recipe box!  Thank you, JBS BOX!

Great Recipe!  Took a double batch to work and came home with an empty dish!  I did use butter instead of shortening, added 1tsp vanilla and the zest of one lemon to the batter, used vanilla soy milk and used half brown and half white sugar for the topping.  Took another reviewers advice and added about 1/3 of the topping to the baking dish after buttering it.  This made it extra nice since both the top and bottom had extra flavor.  YUMMM! :)

The only thing I didn't follow exactly on the recipe was that I doubled the toppings.  I'm sure it would have been just as good without it, but I have some-what of a sweet tooth so I went for it.  Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this cake!  The smell while it is baking is so good that we decided we couldn't wait for it to cool completely and ate it warm.

This was good! It's really more of a coffee-cake than a dessert. Next time I'll prob double the amount of blueberries. I also added a tsp of vanilla and substituted butter for the shortening.

Perfect - very moist blueberry cake with delicious streusel topping.  Cut the flour to 1&1/2 cups per other reviewer's suggestions, substituted butter for shortening, added 1 tbsp vanilla.  Also added nuts to the crumb topping.  Baked for 40 min at 350.

This was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO goooooooooood.  After reading some reviews I made some changes too: butter for shortening; 1 1/2 cups flour; added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Even my finicky 6-year old who doesn't like blueberries ate it up & went back for more.

This was absolutely delicious...only change was to add some of the topping to the bottom of the baking dish and to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white for the topping. Oh yeah I also added 1/3 cup of applesause to the batter.

This was very good.  I did read all the reviews before making it because I find online recipes do have a few mistakes which are caught by others so it really pays to take advantage of other's testing.  So I used the 1 1/2 C flour instead of 2C.  I also used all brown sugar for the topping instead of all white or half white/half brown, just because I like the taste of brown sugar.  And it really tasted great.

This was great. I made all the changes suggested (adding a little more milk and a teaspoon of vanilla).  But for the topping, I used HARD butter instead of the soft butter the recipe calls for.  I mashed everything together with a pastry blender then sprinkled it on top of the batter in the baking dish.  Hard butter is necessary to make the topping crumbly--otherwise you'll end up with something like the consistency of icing for the topping.  Also, my husband made this a second time using 1/3 cup of cranberries and the rest blueberries.  Not enough cranberries to overpower the blueberries but enough to give it an occasional tartness that added to the flavor.  It was delicious!

Excellent!  I followed most of the recommendations about the reduction of flour, the combination of white and brown sugar and adding the vanilla.  I agree that this needs more than 20 minutes to bake.  I baked it for 30 minutes; put a toothpick in to check and it came out clean.  When I served it the following day at work, the middle was still mushy.  Next time I will totally follow the 50 minute recommendation.

This was wonderful. I cut down the flour to 1 1/2 C. Added 1 t vanilla. I also used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar for the topping. I tossed the blueberries in 1 T of flour before adding to the batter. This cooked for 35 mins. What a great recipe. My husband & I loved it! Thanks so much.

I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the batter. At the suggestion of a friend I made a powdered sugar glaze and drizzled over after baking. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I have made this recipe for more than ten years.  One adjustment I have made is to add more blueberries.  The dough seems like it cannot hold together, but it does very well and the buckle is Full OF BLUEBERRIES!  I do not make the crumb topping at all, it is too sweet for us.  I sprinkle the top with just little cinnamon and sugar before baking. 
This recipe is a long standing family favorite.  It even makes well with frozen blueberries in the winter when fresh are not available to us.

I made this recipe as stated and I thought it was great.  The only thing I did differently was bake it in a 9" springform pan.  It was definitely best fresh out of the oven.

I made this exactly per the recipe and everyone loved it.  The batter was very dense and at first I thought I did something wrong but the outcome was incredible.  Because the batter is so dense the blueberries do not rise to the top or sink to the bottom but rather are throughout the entire cake.  Wonderful recipe! Delicious!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe; I made it for a supper club meeting and everyone loved it.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening, 1 1/2 cups of flour, and used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar for the topping.  It was heavenly.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful treat, Janice!

This is a no-fail recipe! I now prefer the muffins instead of a cake and bake them for about 22 minutes or so. The flavor is wonderful and it's a very easy recipe to make.

Outrageous! I cut the flour back to 1 and 1/2 cups, added a tsp. of vanilla, and used stick margarine instead of shortening. To serve, I warmed it in the microwave and topped it with a little vanilla ice cream; my husband ate it cold out of the refrigerator -- it was fabulous either way! I'll be making this one again and again!

Make topping first and then place it in the fridge or freezer while you make the batter. I used brown sugar for the topping in place of white sugar and also added a SMALL amount of chopped walnuts to the topping. Great cake.

This was good, but wasn't what I was expecting. I used 1.5 cups of flour, as suggested by other reviewers, and the cake came out fine in terms of doneness and consistency-- but it was basically just a big, streusel-covered blueberry muffin. Very tasty, and a hit with my family, but not very exciting. If I made it again, I would make it to replace muffins or coffee cake for breakfast. I used frozen blueberries, which worked fine.

One word AWESOME as my hubby quoted. I did not read the reviews before hand so I did not know about the batter being so thick so I just added some more milk to it to make it a smooth stir and added blueberries and cooked it for 45 minutes . It was worth it thanks. Sonya

This is more like blueberry bread with crumb topping.  The cake needs more flavor.  If you look at the ingredients, you'll see there is nothing there for flavor.  Maybe some vanilla extract or butter would do the trick; I'm not sure.  The topping is yummy, and it looks beautiful.  I baked it in an 8x8, so it fit nicely on a cake platter.  I used frozen blueberries with no problem, but I did have to bake it that extra twenty minutes.  The texture also reminds me of a dense bread.  Hope somebody posts the solution to the flavor problem (ingredients and amounts).

I doubled this recipe and used the 9x13 pan. It turned out great. I'm making it again now with blackberries this time. The cake dough in this is the best I've ever used for adding fruit to. For those of you that found it didn't turn out OR DID for that matter, we should all be putting our location in our comments. Altitude makes a huge difference.
I am in B.C., Canada eh?

Easy and delicious.  I followed the original recipe, except I used all butter, since I no longer use shortening.  No need to change anything else or make any adjustments.  As others have noted, this makes a very thick batter.  Spread into pan; not really pourable. Do NOT dilute with additional milk or other liquid. I too had to increase baking time to ~45 minutes.  The cake was light and moist.  Since there is just me, I liked the fact that this recipe makes a small (8" X 8") cake.  I shared it with my neighbors across the hall.  Everyone loved it.

I have made this recipe 3 times and it has been delicious each time.  The first time, I used blackberries instead of blueberries, and they were fine, but not as nice as blueberries.  The only changes I make is to use softened butter instead of shortening and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup in the batter.  I find it easier to just take a stick of butter and split it between the batter and topping than to deal with shortening.  I cut the sugar to reduce the calories.  It's fairly easy and with the fruit and topping, it's always yummy.

I followed some other recommendations and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cup of flour the first time I made this recipe, and used 1 tsp of vanilla. I also cream together the sugar and butter BEFORE adding in the egg. The second time I made it, I accidentally only put 1 cup of flour, and it still turned out amazing. I used BROWN sugar for the topping instead of white. I think it gives a better contrast to the light colored cake. I have only used fresh blueberries with this recipe. I use a 9 inch circular pan or glass dish. Each time I have made it, it takes about an hour of baking time. Maybe because of the size pan I use.

Just made this with my 10 yr old homeschooled son for cooking class, it was great, lots of measuring and seperate bowls fof him to figure out what goes with what. I didnt change the recipe at all, it took 30 minutes to cook and cane out perfect! My husband is going to be psyched! Thanks All Recipes! God Bless

The 25-30 minutes baking time was way under what it actually took.  I did use my toaster oven but that shouldn't have made much difference.  My baking time was closer to 50 minutes to get it completely cooked in the center.  Once it was out, it was delicious.

This recipe was fantastic and loved by all who ate it--even adapted to be vegan (you couldn't tell)! It was light and fluffy and rich and delicious. Beware, it is a rather dense dough--my version felt like I was pressing cookie dough into a pan, but it still baked up like cake. Here are the recipe changes I made based on other reviews and also to make it vegan:
1. Reduce to 1.5 cups of flour
2. 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar for the topping
3. Replace egg with 1 Tbsp. ground flax seed mixed with 3 Tbsp. water (allow to sit for 5 min.)
4. Replace milk with coconut milk
5. Replace butter and shortening with coconut oil and just rub everything in with fingers
6. Added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract (if I did it again, I might reduce the almond to 1/2 tsp.)
7. Bake for 50 minutes

This is delicious. Not too sweet.  My husband said he could eat the whole pan.  I made the recipe exactly as written except for adding 10 minutes to the baking time. The batter was very stiff.  I did not add extra milk.  I carefully folded the blueberries in and then spread the mix into the pan.  Will make this again and will probably add a bit of vanilla to the batter.

I made it just as the recipe said. However I added a little more milk ( 3 tablespoons at the most )the batter seemed a little thick. I also added brown sugar to the top of the crumble mixture because I wanted it sweet. I was surprised at how easy this recipe was. This is now my favorite recipe.

This was easy to make and tasted great!!  I was a little nervous with how thick the batter was but it cooked up just right!!!  I have to say to everyone thinking of making this - please make it as stated and review it as so.  It is not fair to change up the ingredients/amounts and then rate the recipe according to your changes.  Rate it for what it is and THEN give your suggested changes.  Thanks!

I visited some blueberry grower friends in Michigan and they served me some of their homemade MI blueberry buckle.  It was delicious.   When I got home, I searched your website and found this recipe. I gave it a try with some of my own fresh grown blueberries.  It turned out great and everyone loved it.  A nice treat with your Sunday morning coffee.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled it and baked it in a 9.25 x 13.25" glass pan and it was perfect.  I used local blueberries that are in season and the flavour popped.  Served it at work for a friend's birthday and so many people loved it!

All of the family enjoyed this very simple dessert.  This will be definitely one that I will make again.  The recipe calls for only 1/2 cup of milk but I noticed it was a little dry so I added about another 1/4 of a cup and it turned out great!

Very yummy. Had to bake for 45 mins and used brown sugar for the topping.  I also did not have to use all the sugar topping, felt it was a little much.

Made this on the weekend.. everyone loved it!  Had it warm, and the next day was still great.  May try next time with a bit more cinnamon and some brown sugar on the top instead of white. or a mix of both.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum, yum.  Made as directed ( (well almost as I only had 1tsp of baking powder left but it still turned out great) and it was lovely.  Would make again for sure.  Thumbs up from everyone.

Yummie treat for blueberry season.  I also substituted butter for the shortening, which worked fine.  It was easy enough to make, but I ended up with too much sugar/butter topping, which just melted over the top of the cake.  And it was nowhere near done by 30 minutes, it needed closer to 45-50 minutes in the oven to bake through completely.

I wish I could have given it 4 1/2 stars. It has an awesome amount of blueberries, the topping is amazing but the cake is too dry. I bake a lot of cakes from scratch and a thick batter isn't unusual, but this was just too much flour. I wish I would have followed those reviewers' advice because it's still REALLY good so close to being amazing! I will make it again, with at least 1/2 cup less flour.

I love this recipe for blueberry buckle. Used butter vs the shortening. For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white and doubled it. If you have blueberries make this right away. YUM!

I was very disapointed in this recipe, After reading all the rave reviews. I thought my coffee cake was EXTREMELY BLAND! I used fresh sugared berries and even added and extra tsp of vanilla. I have had better coffee cake from a box.  I am going to give it another try and I will try it again as the recipe is written with no modifications from reviews and will update soon!

Use frozen blueberries - it turns out amazing! 
The batter can be a bit thick and heavy so the first time I made this, I found it pretty hard to stir in all the blueberries and I ended up with purple batter (still tasted great!). So the second time, I figured out that the best way is to just put some batter in the pan and then sprinkle with blueberries and pressed them in. Then repeat the same process for the remaining batter. This way, the blueberries are evenly distributed and you still have the nice white/yellow cake.
Thanks for the recipe =)

This is a delicious dessert! My family really enjoyed this. I put 2 cups of mixed frozen berries with hot water rinsed through it (instead of the fresh blueberries), and it turned out great. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks so much! =D

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was excellent. My only problem was the timing.  At the 30 mins., I checked and definately not done.  Went back and looked at reviews and saw that others were adding baking time.  I ended up with almost 60 mins.  I had to laugh at one reviewer who said she did not change the amounts and then went on to say she added a 2nd egg!  That is changing the recipe amounts! The recipe flavor, etc. is a 5 star although I should make it a 4 star due to the timing problem, but that is easily adjusted.  It's a lot like my Mother's coffee cake which had no fruit.

Very tasty, but pretty sweet...even with tart blueberries. Will make again and use less sugar. Also used half brown sugar in it as another reviewer suggested.

I doubled the recipe just as it is for a breakfast coffee cake - I did coat the berries with flour so that they wouldn't sink, though. Takes awhile to bake in the center, but absolutely worth the wait. Definitely will make again.

This recipe turned out wonderful! I did have to change things a little though. I added more milk, probably almost 1/2 cup more. The amount of milk called for left me with a batter so dry it crumbled. I also added a tsp. of vanilla extract into the batter.

My 4 year old liked it so much he got a chair, brought it to the kitchen counter and took himself a cut pieces out of the pan before bed, he had already 2 pieces earlier! Also what I really like is how easy this cake is to make and how delicious it comes out!!

This recipe is awesome- not too sweet and delicious. I did use brown sugar for the topping and doubled the topping. Baked in  a 10 inch stoneware pie plate.

THIS WAS THE BEST! I have been searching forEVER for a recipe like this! I did switch out shortening for butter b/c shortening grosses me out, and I used brown sugar in the topping and added some lemon rind.  Careful not to do too much lemon rind for those doing that, I added a bit too much for my anti-lemon DH. Fab recipe THANK YOU!

Excellent - this is exactly what I was looking for.  Served as is, it's a lovely coffee cake; topped with Blueberry Sauce (also from this site), it is a delicious dessert.  I used butter instead of shortening, but made no other changes.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. Almost like a blueberry muffin but sweeter with the crumble topping. We served with fresh blueberries and strawberries and a little ball of ice cream.

Just made this, and it is wonderful.  Used butter instead of shortening, just because I love butter ... made it exactly as written with fresh blueberries.  My son who doesn't like fruit immedately ate two pieces.  I baked in my electric convection oven at 350-degrees just over 40 minutes and used a toothpick in the center to be sure it was done.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is now my favorite coffee cake!! I did have to change the recipe a little only because I ran out of white sugar so did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown in the cake batter and topping. IT is the best! this time that I am making it I am using an 11x15 pan because it was SO high when I doubled it the first time. Family gobbled it up. I did have to use frozen berries thawed and they worked great.

This is a very good recipe and I've made it several times with similar results.  Like others, I'm discovered the baking time is not correct.  It takes at least 35-40 minutes at 375 degrees for the center to be fully baked.  Somewhere around 36-37 minutes seems to be the magic number for my oven.  Fresh berries produce the best results, though you can use frozen.  Frozen berries tend to 'bleed' their color as they thaw so the dough will take on a purplish hue, while fresh berries--if stirred carefully--won't do that.  Batter is quite thick so just spread it evenly in the pan.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

Holy. This is amazing.
I'm not a cake fan, but this blew my mind!
My boyfriend kept talking about a Blueberry Buckle recipe his grandma made, so I went hunting and found this one; he had eaten half the cake in one evening! Guess that means it was enjoyed ;) This would even be better with fresh blueberries - can't wait for them to be in season here! Definitely on my fav list now.

This is a perfect cake, and it's better the second day. I substituted macadamia nut oil for the shortening (NEVER EVER use shortening!!) and did use butter in the topping. I used wild Maine blueberries, which are perfet for cakes since they don't sink - I also tossed them with a touch of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to the cake. I added the zest and juice of one lemon (and left out the vanilla), but could have gone either way. I think it would be great with almond extract in place of vanilla, too. I used one teaspoon of cinnamon in the topping. With those slight modifications, the recipe is perfect for my taste. Everyone at work loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was delicious. Never had blueberry buckle before, it tasted like a blueberry muffin. Had to bake for 40 minutes at 375 and left in over for 5 minutes after I turned off the oven.

Very good. I doubled the recipe, but kept the blueberries the same...it was still a lot of berries. I also used 1/2 white and brown sugar for the topping. I followed someone's advice about doubling the recipe and cooking it for 1 hour--do not do that! I practically burned the cake at 45 minutes. Just stick to the time stated on the recipe.

I'm rating this recipe based on some changes that I made after reading other reviews.  I reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups, used half shortening/half softened butter, and 1/4 cup of sour cream/ 1/4 cup of milk instead of the whole 1/2 cup of milk.  I also coated the blueberries with a little bit of flour before adding them to the wet mixture, so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  For the topping, I used 1/4 c of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar and sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  I also had to adjust the baking time to 45 minutes for the center to finish baking.  This was moist and tasted wonderful!  My husband loved it too :~)

Excellent cake! Made the recipe as written, didn't change a thing. Only complaint I have about this, and it's why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that it took 60 minutes to bake! I knew it would most likely take more than the 25-30 minutes stated based on the thickness of the cake, but I didn't think it would take double that time. Regardless, I will definitely make this again. The topping is very, very good!

Yum!  Don't change a thing, other than that I used butter rather than shortening.  And I back up previous reviews that ask people not to rate something that they changed half the ingredients on.  It's not fair to the recipe nor to the people looking for the recipe.

Used butter not shortening, a mix of whole wheat and all-purpose flour, and added strawberries with the blueberries. This is good served warm in a bowl with a little full cream drizzled on top.

Now this recipe is a keeper! Made as written, using frozen blueberries. The batter is extremely stiff and it takes a bit of work to incorporate the fruit. I'm glad I used frozen since fresh may not have held up to well.  Baked for 35 minutes, however the centre was still not quite done, even though my tester came out clean. Another 5 minutes and everthing would have been perfect.  Not overly sweet, moist, and bursting with berries and a wonderful streusel topping.

This was delicious and easy to make.  One of the girls at my husband's job gave him a bag of fresh blueberries.  I sent her back some of this after I made it and she immediately asked for the recipe.

Delicious! Wonderful recipe for my just picked blueberries.  Nice dense texture. The streusal topping baked into a top layer instead of just lying on top. Great!

amazing!!! so easy so tendeR. Who could ask for more blueberries, there are atleast 5 in every bite!! I have picked about 25lbs of blueberries this season, i'm going to make this many times. P.S follow the recipe as posted it's PERFECT don't change a thing!!  seriously!  OH one thing I do is( not anything to the recipe) - BEFOR I ADD THE BLUEBERRIES TO THE CAKE MIX I LINE THE PAN WITH A THIN LAYER  OF PLAIN BATTER, THEN AND THE BLUEBERRIES TO THE REMAINING, THEN ADD TO PAN ON TOP OF PLAIN BATTER.FRUIT IS HEAVY AND SINKS IN CAKES, SO THE EXTRA LAYER WITH NO BERRIES IN IT IS OK, CAUSE THE BERRIES ARE ON THERE WAY! TRY IT! and it works on any cake with fruit added  :-) Happy Baking

Very good!  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar for the topping (because I love brown sugar) and drizzled it with a glaze (because, well, I can't help myself!).  The batter was pretty thick and I had trouble stirring in the blueberries.  I contemplated adding more milk, but decided to follow the recipe.  In the end, I think I could have added a little more milk because the cake did turn out a tad dry.  Otherwise, very yummy!  Love the topping!

Used butter instead of shortening, cut flour to 1 and 1/2 cups, used 3 cups berries, added 1 tsp vanilla, and grated in some lemon rind as well.   roll the blueberries in about 1/4 to 1/2 cups flour to coat (keeps them from sinking to the bottom).   ONE OF MY FAVORITE RECIPES!!!!!

by far the best dessert I have made with blueberries!  I took someones advise on the reviews and rolled my blueberries in flour before I added them to the mix and it worked like a charm, they did not seek to the bottom of the cake.  thanks for the great dish

I am a very experienced baker.  When I saw 25-30 minutes for baking, I thought that was not enough baking time.  Since I try not to modify a recipe the first time around, I took the dish out at 30 minutes.  I immediately put it back in for an additional 10 minutes.  After I took it out and let it cool, I saw that the middle was not completely cooked.  I sampled some of the edges and the tast was ok.  I am just frustrated with the wrong time.  I usually check the middle, but I guess I was trusting the recipe.... I think I will try a different recipe next time.

This was nice and moist and very good. My husband loved it, and he doesn't like cake. However next time I will try buttermilk - I think it might add just a hint of zip; that or perhaps a little grated lemon zest. Also, it was suggested to sprinkle powdered sugar on top...

The cook time was way off - I baked for 30 minutes and it was still raw and runny in the middle.  I didn't think to check it and let it cool.  I could only eat the edges, which was ok.

Just made this today with fresh picked blueberries and it is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but left it in the oven about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. My college age daughter said she could live on this cake.  I had a couple of guys working on our house and gave each of them a piece as well, they loved it and said it hit the spot after a long day of work.

This was excellent as a coffeecake. I used the other suggestions and cut flour to 1 1/2 cups and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping. It is moist and delicious, I will be making this again.

Delicious!  I made a few changes based on what I had: one cup of blueberries with one cup of chopped, peeled plums; whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose, and all brown sugar.  I also added a squeeze of orange juice and the zest of half an orange.  The cake was very light and moist; I'll definitely make this again!

Perfect for a summer dessert or for brunch. Everyone said it was great. I will make it again. I think it would be slightly improved if there was a little more flour in the topping mixture.

Fantastic breakfast/dessert! I used all butter, added 1 tsp of vanilla to the sugar/butter/egg mixture, used white whole wheat flour, and added a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Baked at 400 Degrees for 45 minutes.

I was tempted to make some of the changes as suggested by others such as less flour, brown sugar, but then I decided against it and made the dessert as written because there are reviewers who said great things about it that way.  Well, I wish I had made the alterations because it was very dry and pretty bland for our tastes.  I did bake it for about 45 min. because it was just batter inside using a quicker time.  The search continues...

This turned out very well and had a great taste! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added extra blueberries (about an extra 1/2 cup) and also added about a tsp of vanilla extract. My other suggestion would be to use a 9x11 or 9x13 pan... the 9x9 pan was too small, in my opinion :)

I have been looking for a recipe like this for years. Just the right moist texture, just the right amount of sweetness. Made with some blueberries that were the "second quality" of this year's picking, they tasted delicious in this easy cake.

Warning: While I was stirring the batter, I feared that it was too stiff. However after I spread it in the pan and baked it up it was absolutely perfect!

Pretty good recipe --- makes a heavier buckle (which I like).  After reading other reviews and noting many people said it was 'missing something' I did a few alterations on the original.

1. Use 1.5 cups of flour. I think 2 cups would have been fine, buckles are supposed to be spreadable and not pourable.
2. I replaced 1 TB of white sugar in the batter with 1 TB of vanilla sugar that I had leftover from a trip to Europe. If I didn't have that, I would have added just a few drops of vanilla to the milk. Just a few! I wanted a hint of vanilla.
3. I added about 1tsp of finely grated lemon zest. I think this is what people may have been missing.
4. I used Raw Sugar instead of white for the topping. I didn't want something super sweet from using brown, and I think just white sugar in topping is lacking...so Raw fit the bill.

I used an 8x8 pan at 375d and it took about 40 minutes to bake until the toothpick came out with moist crumbs (if it comes out totally clean, you have overbaked and will have a dry buckle!)

All said and done, great buckle base recipe with a few minor modifications.

This is really delicious!  I must say, I was skeptical when making it because the batter was SO thick.  I even looked over the recipe again to make sure I didn't forget to add something.  After baking though, it is a moist delicious cake with awesome topping.  I think the topping was my favorite part.  My husband suggested next time I make it with peaches.

While this recipe needed some changes, it  turned out SO well!  First of all, it calls for WAY too much flour. Foolishly, I didn't read the reviews before making it, and added all the flour to the dry mixture at once.  So I ended up adding extra milk to thin the batter out, and it turned out fine.  I also was out of milk, and substituted heavy cream instead, as it was all I had.  It worked very well!  (If your batter was thick like mine, be sure to spread evenly in the pan, so the middle cooks just as well as the edges).  Lastly, many reviews say this only works well with fresh blueberries.  Not so!  I used two cups of frozen berries that were partially thawed.  They worked perfectly!  After checking the cake at 25 minutes of baking, it was still "jiggly".  I ended up baking this cake for a total of approx 40 minutes.  Even at this point, the middle was still at little gooey, but that's the way my husband and I like it!  While this produced a fantastic end result, I am only giving it 4 stars because it needed so many modifications.  But thanks for a great starting off point!  Yum!

Like others, I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. I also ended up adding a little less than 1/4 cup of extra milk. The batter seemed too thick without it. With those modifications, this recipe came out very moist and tasty.

For taste preferences, I also cut the topping sugar in half, kept the same amount of cinnamon and butter...it was plenty sweet for my taste.  Would definitely recommend this recipe.

SO GOOD!!!  I made this lastnight when I found out that my blueberries were starting to mold. I followed the recipe as is but subtituted butter for shortening and added a tinge of maple syrup.  I also added a layer of additional blueberries after spreading the batter into the pan.  I also added a little more crumble topping. I baked this for 40min and left it in the oven for an additional 10min. Came out delicious!  Thank you!

I used this for our 4th of July picnic and went over very good! I used other's advice and used butter instead of shortening and added 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla. I think using FRESH blueberries are a must. Also serving it warm with a dollup of whipped cream makes it even better. This is a keeper!

A good recipe, not great, but very good. Added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the sugar/butter mixture, and cut flour to 1-1/2 cups. For the topping, cut the butter in half, to 1/4 c., and used my fingers to mix, which is a good way to do a streusel topping in order to get it the right consistency. Also used brown sugar instead of white for the topping, but kept the white sugar for the batter. Used frozen wild blueberries, which I just rinsed and tossed into the batter. And baked in a 9" deep dish pie plate. Tastes like a blueberry muffin, except in a cake. Would definitely make again for a quick, homemade treat.

I made this as written. It is a moist, tender cake, with bursts of blueberry and a crunchy topping. It was sweet and delicious (just cooled from the oven; it didn't last long!) I wouldn't change a thing. The batter is thick: I had to spread it into the pan, rather than "pour" it. It took 30 minutes to bake in my oven.

Loved this!  Used fresh blueberries that were slightly frozen when I mixed them in.  I followed others advice and used 1 1/2 cups flour, added vanilla, used butter instead of shortening and used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar for the topping.  My topping wasn't so "crumby" (which is why I gave it four stars), it was more liquidy that I swirled on top with a knife.  Still crisped up a bit and tasted fine though.  Absolutely delicious with coffee.

the only thing i changed was using butter instead of shortening. mine cooked perfectly in exactly 30 minutes and didn't have to cook it longer like some people. i think it's our oven, it works great.

This was so tasty!  The whole family enjoyed and the 4 of us ate the whole pan for breakfast one morning! I made a few changes, used fat free sour cream instead of shortening.  Use 1/2 cup of oats in place of 1/2 cup of flour in the cake and used brown sugar and some oats in the topping.  I also mixed in half the blueberries and sprinkled the other half on before the topping. I just made another one and can't wait for breakfast tomorrow!

This was a pretty and tasty dish. The cake portion rose pretty high, probably about 2 inches, and doesn't look anything like the pictures, but is very light and moist. A nice fresh dessert or treat to go with coffee.

Made this about two hours ago... had a piece nice 'n' warm from the oven; now I can't stop picking at it!  TOO good!!  Like some other reviews I reduced flour (used WW Pastry Flour instead of White), increased blueberries, and used evaporated cane juice in the topping.  I also only ended up sprinkling on about 1/2 of the topping and that was plenty.  I will DEFINATELY make this again.  AWESOME!

This cake is really good. I would not use shortning though because it contains trans fats and thats why I bake to avoid that.  Other reviews mentioned cutting back flour, I kept the flour the same but increased the milk to 3/4 cup instead and it worked out well.  I also added some vanilla and nutmeg.  The dough seemed very dry and thick before baking.  It seemed like there was way too much fruit in it but when it baked I thought the ratio was perfect.  I have also made it with the costco mixed berries and it is delicious. This cake disappears fast.  The last time I made it I increased the recipe by half and made it in a 10" springform form. I find one 8" is just not enough!!

This is super easy to make.  I used all brown sugar and used butter instead of shortening and added 2t vanilla because I like it so much.  This was really good.  It does seem really thick when you put it in the pan, but it turned out very moist and good.  A great way to use fresh blueberries.

Great blueberry recipe!  Although, I made some substitutions, it was quite easy to make overall.  I used frozen blueberries (used 3 cups instead of just 2 cups) and it still came out great (although I had to bake it for an add'l 30 minutes due to the add'l frozen blueberries).  I used vanilla yogurt instead of milk, substituted half the sugar with Splenda blend brown sugar and reduced the flour amount to 1.5 cups total (and replaced half of that with whole wheat).  Used egg substitute and margarine instead of butter, too.  And it came out DELICIOUS!  My hubby & I both loved it so I will definitely be making this quite often!

YUMMY!!!  I made this for dessert and everyone devoured it.  The only changes I made were:  I used butter instead of shortening, I added 1 tsp. vanilla and I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, only because they're not in season yet.  A keeper for sure!

This is an easy, tasty recipe.  I made the same changes others did:  1 1/2 cups flour and 1 t vanilla, (and 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 cup brown for the topping).  I also added a healthy dollop of sour cream, which gives it a slight tang, and increases your baking time by about 5 minutes.  YUM!

This was my first attempt at blueberry buckle, and it was excellent!!  I also substituted butter for shortening, used 1 1/2 c. flour, and added an extra cup of blueberries, which I highly recommend to anyone who tries this recipe.  The only comments I can add would be to fold the blueberries in very gently so they don't break, and allow a lot of extra baking time.  I had the cake in the oven for over an hour and had to cover it after the first 40 minutes or so to be certain the top wouldn't burn.  This is a delicious summer cake, not too sweet, and would be perfectly complimented by a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  Try it!

Like others I added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1 1/2c. flour, part brown and white sugar for the top.  I also added more flour to the topping.  My butter was mostly melted and it wouldn't spread out right.  I baked for 35 minutes.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some blueberries and came across this. This came out very nice, similar to a coffeecake. I used 1/4 c brown and a 1/4 c white sugar for the topping, which I definately recommend. I also think this would be great w/ peaches. Will definately make again.

I love blueberries, so I made with 3 cups in the batter and then topped the batter with another cup of blueberries before adding the topping.  Like others I only used 1 1/2cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Baked for 50 minutes. Thank you Janice,for a wonderful, yummy, BBQ dessert!

I've been looking for a recipe for a good blueberry coffeecake for a while, and this one hits the mark.  It's tasty, moist and disappears like magic.  I have used other fruits such as peaches with much success as well!

Thought this might be more like blueberry cobbler and dessert like. It is almost the same recipe as To Die For Blueberry Muffins and I didn't care for this with vanilla ice cream. Maybe it will be better in the morning with coffee, butter and heated under the broiler. I did follow advice and use 1 1/2 cup flour, vanilla, and butter for shortening. Frozen blueberries added at least an extra 15 min. baking time. Easy to make anyway!

Delicious! I followed the advice of other reviewers and put in 1 1/2 cups of flour to the batter and added vanilla. My husband was VERY impressed with it and couldn't stop himself from getting seconds or eating it again for breakfast! I will definitely make this again.

very good! i found when i was putting on the topping, it wasn't enough to cover so i doubled the topping. it turned out to be a little too much, so I reccomend going 1 & 1/2 times on the topping. i made this in a 9 inch round cake pan, and was glad I did because it barely fit in that. I don't think the 8 inch square pan would have been big enough. great recipe though, very yummy!

This is the best blueberry cake i've had in a long time.  i made it for class and the end result, while blue & holloween-ish, was fantastic.  Using fresh or frozen, the blueberries melt down and form little warm pockets in the product. Fantastic.

I've made this twice and still have yet to find the perfect baking time. First time it was not done in the middle (but still tasted delicious!), second time I couldn't get it out in time due to circumstances beyond my control (one screaming baby), but it was still great. I hope to get it perfect next time. It will taste unbelievably great, I'm sure!

I decided to try this recipe out on my inlaws.  It was a hit!  I doubled it and made it in my 9X13 stone.  I cooked it for a bit longer as I increased recipe.  It is fantastic!  Will make again!

So easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I made two in the same day and split them amongst some friends and family.  I got phone calls for the next two days telling me how wonderful it was.  Like others, I decreased the flour & added vanilla.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I defnitely had to bake it for approx. 40 - 45 minutes, though.  I made one with butter and one with shortening, and they were both fantastic!  I highly recommend this, especially during blueberry season.

This was my first buckle (never even heard of 'Buckles' before I had seen this recipe) and it turned out very good. Reminded me of a giant size Canadian blueberry muffin. Its a keeper.

The buckle was great, very moist and very easy to make.  I also had to up the cooking time by at least 15 minutes. I'll definitely make it again!

I was a little nervous making this given some of the reviews.  The only change I made was  in the topping.  I used half dark brown sugar and half granulated sugar.  I dusted the blueberries with some flour prior to adding them to the mix as suggested so the berries did not sink to the bottom.  However It took 55 minutes to bake.  I will make this again.  It reminded me of the blueberry buckle my mom used to bake.

Made this exactly as recipe said and it is delicious!  Don't be tempted to change the recipe, it will be thick and you need to carefully fold in the blueberries, but leave it as is and you'll be delighted.  My husband is not a fruit fan, but this is the perfect balance of cake and fruit and he loved it, too.

Everyone loved this one! A few changes made: rice flour with a small amount of xanthum added to replace the flour and the sugar was reduced to 1/2 cup in the base and 1/3 cup in the topping.

I substituted butter in place of the shortening because it's not something I use, it's not been something I grew up with.  My batter was stiff and I struggled stirring in the blueberries.  I double checked all my measurements to be sure I made no mistakes.  First when I couldn't "stir" in the blueberries, again when I couldn't "pour" the batter and yet again when it was still squishy when I tested it after 30mins.  It just needs more cook time.  Baked it for about 45-50mins and it turned golden and perfect.  (Posted a pic of the end product)  Maybe it has something to do with the altitude?  I'm located in Colorado.  Tasted great.  Would make it again.

I bake frequently and with so many recipes out there, I tend to be somewhat selective about what I make twice. I made this exactly as presented and thought it was excellent. Not only will I make this twice, but I plan to make it again and again with a variety of fruit in season.

This was a fantastic recipe exactly as written. If you substitute butter you change the entire chemistry. The shortening gives the cake that softer texture. It will be thick and that holds up the blueberries. Don't change anything, it's perfect as written.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  It take almost an hour to cook.

I'm not very good at making quick breads, but gave this one a go on Christmas Eve. I was thinking it would not turn out because the dough was stiff, but it was absolutely delicious and moist without changing the ingredients. I did use a bundt pan though.

I added a cup of chopped strawberries to this recipe and substituted margarine for shortening. I also added 15 minutes to the cooking time. The recipe came out great. My wife, who doesn't eat dessert, had two slices. I will definitely make this again.

This is the exact recipe from Betty Crocker's cookbook, second edition, dated 1956. My grandmother, my mother, and myself have all made this recipe many times. It needs no changes, it is perfect the way it is!!!

I liked this.  The cake itself is not too sweet (the topping is).  It highlights blueberries well and has a really nice fluffy but still  substantial texture.  I did add a bit of vanilla, and used butter rather than shortening, but otherwise the only change I made was the baking time.  Mine took over 40 minutes to bake.

This was surprisingly good for as simple as it is. Dense, flavorful and moist, I ended up sending the leftovers home with grandma, and she's the baker in the family... So I guess it was a hit!

Perfect recipe. Simply delightful. I didn't happen to have shortening with me at the time so I substituted butter and found that it worked as well. Great flavor and perfect texture, moist yet not too dense. A favorite for sure. 5/5

I've made many a crisp and cobbler, but this blueberry buckle tops them all! i followed the recipe exactly, except for replaceing the shortening with butter. Served with vanilla ice cream and had a great dessert every night this week! My husband liked it also.
Thanks for the recipe jBS Box

Scrumptious way to serve blueberries. I used fresh blueberries, more than 2 cups. I had to bake it 10 minutes longer so it wouldn't be dough-y in the middle. My family loved it, whole pan gone in a day.

Hello, fellow bakers!  I may have reviewed this once before, not sure I've been baking it over and over again for quite a few years).  Not only does my family love this recipe, but when I treat the office I work at, people crow with delight when they see I have brought it in.  It never lasts until noon at my office. 
I did do something different this time. I used a little less flour as some other reviewers had posted.  I used 1 and 2/3 c. flour and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I just want to see if there is a difference.  It's baking now! Love this recipe.

The results were great but I had to use more than double the milk to get a batter I could mix the blueberries with. It was still very thick and needed a little smoothing out to fill the pan, as it still wasn't what you would call "pourable." I used a Splenda substitute (Ingles' Exquisite), which might have caused the problem. But I repeat, the results were great.

Just came back from the farm with fresh blueberries. This recipe is excellent as is. I did use half white and half brown sugar just because I love brown sugar! The only comment is that the batter is more like cookie batter rather than Cake batter so don't let that confuse you. Fast and easy and delicious!

I've made this recipe twice with the only change made, being that I used butter instead of shortening as shortening is hard to come by in Europe. 

One of the other reviewers mentioned that this will not turn into a batter that you can really pour, but more into sort of a spoonable blob. That was valuable information as that is indeed the case. I may have added a little bit more milk than the required quantity to turn it an acceptable consistency. Spooned it into the pan and doused it with the sprinkle topping. Awesome. 

Also, don't worry if it doesn't reach all the corners of your pan. There is no need to use pressure or anything to get it to reach the corners. It will spread, once in the oven. Just make sure it roughly covers the bottom. I made the qunatity as is, and divided it into 8 big portions that were gone in seconds the last time I made it. 

It is one of my favourite blueberry recipes and the best topping I have come across so far. This one doesn't sink or melt or get all globby.

This was a very nice dessert.  I had to cook it for an extra 20 minutes, even in my 9x9 pan.  I used butter instead because we were out of shortening.  I dredged the blueberries in flour, though I don't know if this was necessary since the batter is very thick. I used frozen wild blueberries. Were not a big dessert family, but I'll save this recipe for potlucks or for company.

Well it was very good once I altered the recipe a little. I used 3/4 cup of milk and 1/2 tea. almond favoring. I baked it in a 9 by 13 glass pan. My husband couldn`t hardly wait for it to cool with the aroma of blueberries and almond in the air.

I've made this about 5 times in the last two months. Blueberries are in season and this is an easy, yummy recipe just as it is.
For those with the negative reviews maybe you need to check your oven, It comes out moist and perfect every time for me.

This recipe is great.  I did add an extra egg, but only because my eggs were very small.  The batter is thick, but it comes out in a perfect consistency when cooked.  I thought it was fabulous!  Mine had to cook about 45 minutes at 350 to get done.  I cooked it in a thick ceramic 8x8 pan.  Delish.

When I was mixing the batter it seemed really dry so I thought it was going to be dense, but I was seriously wrong! It is so light and fluffy, perfect balance of sweetness and my boys described it as "the best dessert ever!" I agree and it would also be great with coffee.

This is my go-to recipe for church brunches and dessert any time.  It has a crunchy top, is not too sweet, and everyone loves it.  Cooking time should be increased to 40 minutes, as in other reviews, but don't go too long or the topping will be too crunchy!  Have also made with raspberries.  Suggestion to those who think it has too much flour: sift before you measure or use cake flour.  This is a great recipe. Try it.

Made cake as directed but the crumb topping NEEDS to have brown sugar to give it more of a crumb/texture so: FOR THE TOPPING:
½ cup all-purpose flour,
½ cup light brown sugar,
2 tablespoons granulated sugar,
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon,
Pinch of salt,
¼ cup unsalted softened butter.

Doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan. An 8x8 pan of this yumminess would be lucky to last 24 hours around my family. Don't change a thing on the recipe. It is delicious.

I made this exactly as written and it is delicious!  The only thing that threw me off was how long it took to bake.  The recipe says 25-30 minutes, but mine took almost an hour (in an 8 x 8 pan).  I think next time I'll use butter instead of shortening, but will keep everything else as is.  I love how chuck full of berries it is!

Yummy!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but in a 9" round cake pan (since I don't have a square pan) and had to increase the baking time to 50 minutes.  I think the time would have to be increased in the square pan too...haven't made a cake yet that bakes in only 1/2 an hour ;)

Yum! This blueberry buckle is very good! I made zero changes to the recipe. I did have to bake mine for 45 minutes, but that was probably due to my oven and not the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just OK.  The ratings of this recipe gave me high hopes, but I didn't think to read the reviews... everyone seems to be rating it based on a recipe they have made up themselves based loosely on the original recipe.

This recipe was deeeeelicious!  I will agree with some reviews - mine also took at least 15mins longer to cook than stated in the recipe, but as long as you keep an eye on it and don't let it cook too long, it turns out great.  YUM!!

So delicious! I added about 1/2 cup more blueberries because I tend to like more of a fruit flavor.

This is more like a cake. I followed the recipe just as written.  I didn't add applesauce instead of shorting or or use half the flour to cut calories.  Another reviewer said that these are key components to the recipe and I agree.  Adding a dash of cinnamon or vanilla is one thing, but the fat and gluten is something that has to stay. With that said, the cake was good - not great, but good.  The blueberries did not fall to the bottom like some reviews had issues with.  The cake itself has just the right amount of sweetness. If you take off the topping it would be much better.  The topping was paste like and very sweet, not crumbly.  I spread it over the cake anyway and when I had my first bite I took the topping off.  Way to much sweetness for one cake.  Also - the cooking time if off.  It took my cake 45 minutes to complete baking, not the 30 as suggested.  To sum up - bake the cake for 45 minutes and skip the topping.  It will be much better.  It's still a keeper.  Thank you for a good recipe.

This was great! I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and replaced the shortening with butter. I prepared the topping with a pastry blender, and it was a hit.

Wow, both delicious to taste and stunning to look at.  I followed the directions almost to the letter with fabulous results.  The only thing I did different is that I found the dough to be too stiff to easily fold in blueberries and I thought if I tried, they'd breakdown in the process.  So instead, I spread the batter in my baking dish and then put all the blueberries on top and then carefully pressed them into the cake batter.  I then sprinkled on the topping as the recipe says and the outcome was this beautiful blueberry and crumb topping.  The blueberries that came through the topping were bubbling.  It was almost too beautiful to cut in to.  Fabulous recipe.  Thanks for the post.

The results were lovely but while mixing the ingredients I thought I must've made a mistake - it was such thick sticky dough! I could barely get the berries mixed in. I actually made the dough twice, convinced I  mis-measured something first time around (I hadn't). It came out fine but I will trust other reviewers and decrease the flour amount a bit next time (it was a tad too dense). Might even add a few more berries.

I was looking for a recipe for blueberries because I had some that I didn't want to go bad and I found this recipe.  I made it today and followed the recipe as written except I added 1/2 cup shortening instead of 1/4 cup in error but I think it just made it more moist...also, I didn't have an 8X8 pan so the one I used was smaller and it took longer to get done but over all, we liked it.  I will make it again sometime.

I tried this recipe last night.  It required much more milk than the recipe stated. It came out very dense and bland.  This definitely was not my favorite.

Delicious cake! I was surprised at how much it rose in the pan. It was huge! And yummy! Wouldn't change a thing.
Revised 5/11/13 - made the cake for the second time today, with one minor change. It's not fresh blueberry season, so I used frozen. SAME YUMMY. I just dredged the berries with flour first and had to bake the cake for an additional 20 minutes or so. Still loving this recipe, thanks again!
Edit 9/4/14 - I've now lost count of how many times I've made this recipe. It's one of our favorites. My 16-year-old son even learned how to make it and has made it a couple times on his own.

I followed the recipe as written and I couldn't have asked for a better result.  Usually I will make the recipe once as written and then the next time adjust it a little to experiment to see if I can make it more to my liking/ taste.  I will not do that with this one..it's perfect as is...definately a keeper.  My friend does not like blueberries but loved this blueberry buckle.

Made original recipe and the batter was really thick for me, didn't spread well and was difficult to mix in fresh blueberries. Will try 1 1/2 cups next time. Good flavor though.

Turned out wonderful. For the cake I used butter, and added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 c sour cream. For the topping, I added 1/2 c chopped pecans and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. (tossing the blueberries with a Tbl spoon of flour as another reviewer suggested) . I baked it in a greased 9 in spring form pan. After 48 minutes it still wasn't done, so I baked it 10 more at 350, then let cool in the oven. The streausel formed a crunchy crust that tastes great and the cake is very moist and delicious. (forgot, I also used cake flour). will definitely make again.

Just made this and it came out delicious. I had two problems though - 1) the crumb topping recipe says to "sprinkle" - but the mixture was way too goopy for anything like that so I added in an extra 1/3 cup of oats and just spread evenly over the top. 2) had to add an extra 20 mins to the baking time because it definitely didnt look done after 25. I don't know why there are so many reviews that say it came out dry. Mine had a really nice delicate crumb, and it was just right. Also used fresh blueberries and had no problem stirring them in.

Made exactly as described, except for using frozen blueberries tossed in a little bit of corn starch.  The recipe took around 45 minutes to get solid in the middle, which was just ridiculous given the cook time on the recipe.  When it was done and cooled, no one liked it. Today it was much better, having sat in the fridge overnight, but nothing special.  The topping was the best part of it.  It wasn't bad, but IMO there are a lot of tastier ways to use blueberries so I won't be making this again.

Great recipe, though I did add one extra tablespoon of shortening, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon,  a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter. I had Blackberries instead of Blueberries and had to cook it a little longer but it was absolutely delish!

I followed the directions exactly and it was so delicious!! I will be making this again and again for my family for years to come. The only thing I think I will do differently next time is to add the blueberries after I pour the batter into the pan instead of trying to fold them in.

I skipped the topping to make it less rich (and slightly healthier); I just sprinkled some brown sugar on top.  Even without what is probably the best part, it's wonderful!

Very moist and sweet, just as a blueberry buckle should be. Would definitely make this again.

Fantastic flavor, and that topping is so yummy! The only thing I can think to do is add a little vanilla (I add vanilla to everything I bake), but even without that it is still five stars. I substituted butter for the shortening (I never use shortening so its never in my pantry) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was blown away. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent and VERY easy to make.  Most ingredients are already on hand except for the blueberries and it is quick & easy to prepare.  We had for dessert one night and then ate the rest as a coffee cake.  DELICIOUS!!

I used butter instead of shortening for this recipe. It was very hard for me to mix in the blueberries. The buckle was great warm out of the oven - but it does not keep well. If you are going to make this make sure you cover the leftovers tightly - maybe this will help not dry it out.

I can only rate it a 4 by the smell!  Just came out of the oven.  Waiting just a bit to try....UPDATE  . Had to try this while it was still warm, OMG.  Very good.  I'm sure it will be good later also.  Hubby said I could make this one again!

I made this exactly as directed, with the following exceptions:  I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, Truvia instead of sugar, and I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 12 cake pan.  It was absolutely fantastic!  Moist, sweet....  perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it had far too much flour and it was not sweet enough. It was very moist though and easy to make. I plan to try again, but next time will follow some of the other reviewers advice and use less flour and add vanilla.

Awesome recipe, definitely a keeper. I made it today for my family and had to make another pan to share it with a friend. I substituted the shortening with butter, and the end result was this great tasting "coffe-cake like" with a little tangy taste of the blueberry. The crunchy top was just perfect for my tasting, not too sweet. Just perfect!!!

Great recipe that I will make again.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping, increased the cinnamon, and baked it in a 9" stone pie plate.  Many compliments!

We have tons of wild blueberries in the summer and this is now my favourite recipe for them.  It's been a huge hit amongst my friends and family.  I use brown sugar in the topping instead of white sugar but I don't change anything else.  This is the perfect coffee time treat!

I doubled the batch and added a total of 3 cups of blueberries.  This was a perfect amount!  I also used butter in place of shortening, just because I prefer the taste.  This is a delicious dessert!!

This was very good. I made it exactly as directed and am rating it 4 stars only because the baking time is off. I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes and didn't discover until it was cooled and cut that the  center wasn't quite done enough, even though a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean. I will make it again but will try baking it for  40 minutes next time. As a side note, the batter was very thick, more like a dough so you can't really "pour" it into the pan.

This is sooo moist and delicious!!! I just had a hankering to bake something this morning and had a 1/2 pint (1 cup) of blueberries just sitting in the fridge, so I halved this recipe which was a little difficult but doable. I did use the full egg though and it still turned out great!! I used butter instead of the shortening and added more vanilla. Also I used all brown sugar for the topping mixture and it came out gloppy and not 'sprinkle-able' because of the excess moisture in brown sugar so next time I will be sure to use half white, half brown. It sure tasted amazing though, crunchy and caramel-ly on top!!! I will definitely try the full recipe next time but for this tester one, I think I did A-OK!!! Soooo good, there's a reason why it's got almost 700 reviews!

I am not much of a baker so the problem could have been on my end. The mix was thick...thicker than making muffins. I followed recipe as stated. No problem with the taste because when I got up in the morning there was none left. Just crumbs on a plate in the sink. LOL Will try again.

We liked this quite well, especially the next day.  I used an 8x8 pan, but it took longer than noted to bake - almost 15 minutes longer.  It was very moist and the cake itself was not extremely sweet.  The topping of course added a nice crunchy, sugary sweetness!

The base tasted like flour and baking powder with no sweetness to it at all. I know I followed the recipe to a T because I always tripple check my measurements. Even my husband, who is much less picky than I am and actually prefers things less sweet, did not care for it.

This blueberry buckle was very good!  I found the batter to be very dense so I lowered the oven temp. to 350 and it took 75 min. to cook through.  The topping is very crunchy!  I found that the longer it sat the better it got.

I used butter instead of shortening (didn't have any) and added vanilla and it turned out great. I think even without those changes it would be yummy.

Ok, maybe my oven is completely not the right temperature (even though it tells me it's at 375) This thing has taken almost double the time to cook that the recipe states. Although delicious, I think the cook time needs adjusted.

This was good.  I didn't have shortening, so I subbed butter.  The cook time is not long enough and the topping is too sweet.  Next time I'll cook it without the topping, and I'll cook it five or ten minutes longer.  But yes, there WILL be a next time!

Very Delicous!!!  Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  The only changes that I made were:  I used butter in place of the shortening (since shortening has preservatives and I prefer to cook with all natural/no preservative ingredients). I also followed another rater's advice and doubled the recipe and put in a 9X13 pan, I used about 2 1/2 cups of fresh berries which was a perfect amount.  I served warm with a small dollop of fresh ice cream on the side. I also plan to eat a slice for breakfast with a cup of tea.  This recipe is definately a keeper :-)

The blueberry version is great, however I had a few apricots I needed to use so made the buckle with them.  I only needed five to make the 2 cups, increased the sugar by 1/4 cup and it also was good.  Even better, today I made the recipe by using one apricot, one black plum and one peach, all cut up about the size of the blueberries and then added about 2 cups of blueberries to the mix.  I baked it in a 9 inch spring form pan and did not need to bake as long.  The best version yet.  And I found the next day in order to make it taste as if it just came out of the oven, warm a serving in the microwave for about ten seconds.  Just like out of the oven and so Yum!  So easy to make one day and serve for breakfast the next just by warming it up this way.  I didn't use all the topping on the second buckle, just put the extra in a zip lock bag for the next time.  And it is easier to mix the topping if you use a pastry blender to cut in the butter.  Oh, for easier removal from the pan, line the pan with parchment paper.

Despite the many positive reviews I found this to be a dry cake without much flavor.  Will not be making it again.

Delicious!!! Fluffy and tasty, and I love the crumbly topping. Would have given it 5 stars if it were just a tad more "gooey" and less fluffy but delicious nonetheless!!

Outstanding.  I had a little more than 2 cups of fresh, handpicked blueberries, and I didn't want to make muffins yet again, so I decided to try something new.  I don't think I've ever even had a "buckle" before, but I'm definitely a fan now!  This recipe was extremely simple, and the end product is perfect: moist, sweet and satisfying.  I only added one ingredient (a dash of vanilla to the wet stuff) and substituted another (water for milk, since I found out only after mixing both dry and wet ingredients that I had just run out).  My mixture cooked for nearly ten more minutes than called for, but all fears that it would be dried out and dreadful were put to rest when I tried it -- it's awesome!  I'll be making this again for sure.

I made this recipe exactly as printed as I'm new to the kitchen. My boyfriend and the shop I work in are all my guinea pigs, and they loved it! It is so light and delicious, it was AWESOME with coffee. Thinking of adding chocolate chips next time just to experiment. Thank you for this DELICIOUS recipe!

This is pretty much the only cake that I make using blueberries.  I made it for the staff lounge at school today, but had to sneak a little piece before leaving it.  It was so moist and pretty much every bite has blueberry in it.  Because I was taking it somewhere, I baked it in a spring-form pan.  The only change I made was to use a little brown sugar in the topping.  It did take about 7 more minutes to bake than the instructions called for.  Finished with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  I have also made this recipe with blackberries in the past.  It is also great!

This is THE recipe to use for blueberry buckle.  The only change I made to the recipe is to jazz up the topping a little by adding sliced almonds & sprinkling with turbinado sugar.  It is so, SO good!  Definitely recommend using fresh blueberries when possible, but frozen (thawed berries) also produce good results.  Don't bother messing around with all the suggested changes....this recipe is a winner as is.  Just use proper baking & mixing techniques.  You may even get a marriage proposal out of this one!

the ingredients are spot on for a delicious blueberry cake/buckle. The only issue i had was the cooking time. Mine took nearly twice as long as the time stated.

I ate 2 slices. The husband ate 1. The rest is in the trash. Not good enough to be worth the calories. The amount of topping was ridiculous. WAY too much! The "cake" itself had a floury aftertaste that I didn't care about. I wish I had used the blueberries on something else.

This is a good recipe!  I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9x13 for about an hour, used black raspberries instead of blueberries (because that's what I had on hand) and I added a 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the topping.  The topping was great.  I did not make any changes to the cake part and it turned out a little dry.  I will make this again according to other reviewers comments to reduce the flour.

This is one of the best cakes I've made thus far, especially during blueberry season, where my boyfriend thankfully lives down the street from an orchard. Wonderful recipe, perfect amount of sweetness, and I probably used more than two cups of blueberries.  It also keeps very well.  Thank you for this recipe, it's amazing.

This is the most amazing blueberry coffee cake in the world! So easy to make and is delicious with fresh picked blueberries.  TIP: If you're using frozen blueberries, either thaw them before using or just bake 10 minutes longer. The blueberries need time to melt because it acts as the liquid in the cake.

After reading the most helpful comments on this recipe, I decided to try it out. These are my findings:  1. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pyrex baking dish; baking time was about 50 minutes. 2. I decreased the amount of flour to 3 cups. 3. I added 2 tsp. of vanilla 4. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping. 5. I used butter instead of shortening.  I gave a 4 star rating solely for the reason that I thought the cake was a bit on the dry side. Other than that, a very tasty cake which was very similar to a blueberry muffin texture and taste. Will probably make again, as soon as I figure out how to make it a little more moist.

This is a delicious cake with just the right sweetness.  I wouldn't adjust the recipe at all.  I will be making this again.

This was very easy and tasted great!  Two cups of berries is a lot.  I've made twice and once I followed the recipe the next time, I only used 1.5 cups of berries.  Both ways turned out great.  The receipe does not tell you, however, how to make the topping.  When you combine the last 4 ingredients, be sure to "crumble" it by mixing up with your fingers.  This tastes even better the next day.

This is so delicious! I will definitely make this again ... and again ... and again!  One note, I did have to cook it much longer than the recipe called for - it was very doughy in the middle.

The whole family loved this recipe!! I did use extra blueberries :)), the only thing I really changed as a personal preference was using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, but not more than the amount of sugar the recipe lists.The texture was great; most importantly is was... Delicious!! ( 10/09/2010 We are still enjoying this awesome recipe Thanks Again :D)

I love this recipe!  I've used it for a couple years and it's great every time without changes.  Recently I've been looking for some low-fat options so I tried it out with one of my favorite recipes.  I replaced the shortening and the butter with low-fat vanilla yogurt.  It made the topping a little less crumbly when putting it on, but no different once baked.  It was yummy once again and close to guiltfree!

This cake was so light and delicious! I was unsure how it would turn out without vanilla, but was totally surprised by how great it turned out! It's a simple recipe w/great results.

Delicious! I added a tsp. of vanilla, used butter for shortening (personal preference) and brown sugar in place of the white for the topping.  The cake was finished in less than 24 hours!

Looked great and the topping was tasty, but the rest was dry, crumbly, and nearly tasteless. I had to cook an extra 15 minutes because the batter was still runny in the middle after 30 minutes. (I made this exactly as written except added 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond extract)

Definitely add one tsp. vanilla and bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I used butter instead of shortening. This is a lovely dessert and easy to make!

Very very delicious! I altered the recipe a little to make it more suitable for my family's taste. First of all, I substituted butter for the shortening because I did not have it on hand. Second, I added around 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract into the cake batter to give it a little more flavour. The big change came in the topping: I made my own version using 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup rolled oats, 1/8 cup butter, 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts and 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon mixed up together into coarse crumbs. Then, I baked my buckle in a muffin pan (filled 12 cups) at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. They turned out fabulous! The cake was moist and not too greasy nor too sweet, and the topping was delightfully crunchy and cinnamony. We loved them!

Excellent!  I think I'll use a larger pan next time.  I had trouble getting the middle done.  I've made this two times and it's happened each time.  I even baked it for an additional 10 minutes.  It's really nice and moist and delicious.

Mmmm! This was one of my favorites as a kid. Identical recipe to my mom's, except she adds 1 1/2 tsp grated lemon rind and 2 tsp lemon juice to the batter, and 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg to the topping.

4 stars for TASTE ONLY.  Yes, it was easy, looked pretty and was tasty....BUT--- It was really soggy in the middle while the edges cooked to almost burning.  I'll make it again, but perhaps use different bakeware.

I liked the crunch on the top of this, but found that the rest of it was quite bland.......although I did use canned blueberries.  I might try fresh ones next time and see how it turns out.  I would recommend to put more cinnamon in the crumble mix, and perhaps a bit more sugar.

Brought this to work and was gone instantly.  Family loved it too.  Don't overbake or it will dry out, and remember to add some pecans or walnuts to the topping for extra flavor and crunchiness.  YUM!!!

Wow! This was great.  I did make a couple adjustments, sub'd Splenda for sugar (can't have sugar) and ended up using 1/2 cup extra milk as the batter was WAY thick for me for some reason.  Came out fluffy and yummy.  Will def make again.

In my rush to get this recipe made I neglected to read the reviews (which is something I normally always do).  Anyway, I should have checked those reviews to find out that the recipe needed at least another 10 to 15 minutes of baking time.  I made the recipe as written and it was tasty.  Having now read the other reviews though, next time I will bake for 40-45 minutes.  Also, I may add some additional cinnamon and possibly the lemon zest suggested by another reviewer.  It is a great base recipe with the bake time correction.  The time being off is the reason for the 4 star review, not the flavor.

This was very... VERY Good! I made it exactly as written and everyone loved it. Next time I will add some nutmeg to the topping and also add some cinnamon to the batter, I just love cinnamon and I know that would taste amazing. I definatly needed to cook it longer than the 25-30 mins.. it was more like 40 mins for me. Ooo.. I did change one thing.. I did half white and half brown sugar in the topping. The topping was incredible and definatly makes this cake! Thanks for the recipe!

I believe the recipe I have at home and use all the time is exactly like this one.  The only difference is there is a glaze of powdered sugar that it calls for that I never use.  This is so good, I make it many times a year and it turns out every time! (never be in a hurry and use frozen berries...I guarantee it won't turn out!)

I've been making this exact recipe for about 10 years, it was my grandmothers before I started making it. We have never messed with it because it is wonderful just as written. (If you use cream as some suggested the fat content doubles!) It's a light, moist, coffee cake that is perfect with coffee and no so sweet or rich that you can't eat more than one piece. A true family classic!

I make this recipe exactly as instructed and it turns out perfect every time! I find it helpful to freeze the blueberries the night before, and use them in the recipe frozen. This way, it doesn't turn the batter purple!

I make this quite often, but it is best during blueberry season. I use an 11x7 pan for mine. This has always been a hit with friends and family.

As i was mixing the batter, I was concerned I did something wrong because it was SO thick. "folding" in the blueberries was a little more tricky, but the result was something fabulous. A coworker who doesn't like fruit desserts even liked it. Also, its a great dessert recipe for an outside picnic as it won't melt. Loved it and substituted nothing.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was WONDERFUL!  It did take longer to bake than the stated 25-30 minutes, though.  It's a great way to use fresh blueberries.

I followed this recipe to the letter and I got a thick, muffin consistency. Rather dry as well. I will follow the reviewers below and omit some flour or add more milk, something to that effect. This did not come out like I'd hoped.

This is so close to what my mom always made us growing up. The batter is very thick- that's the way it's supposed to be. You shouldn't have to alter any of the dry ingredients, it comes out great as is (my only sub is butter instead of shortening). Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe! I hate posting alterations but I had to make some. Used coconut oil instead of shortening, subbed whole wheat graham flour for 1/4 of the flour, and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar for the topping. Fabulous!

Was a great recipe, I did find I had to cook it longer. And I like brown sugar better than white for the top. But was great! Everyone enjoyed it and it was a great use of frozen blueberry's I have in the freezer.

This recipe was delicious.  The only things I changed were I didn't have shortening so I used butter, used brown sugar in the topping, ran out of flour so I used cake flour and I baked at 350 for 45 min.  I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent! I made it exactly as directed with absolutely no problem. Was moist, berries were juicy and they didn't sink. Batter was thick, but not as thick as I expected after reading the reviews. I always make a recipe as called for the first time and then am my own judge as to whether it needs modifications. Most times, it does not. I think the only thing I would change w/this recipe is that I'd just use brown sugar for the topping instead of the white. But the cake part was perfect!

I just made this today for a church breakfast and received rave reviews !!  Made it just as the recipe calls for except that I too used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for the topping.  Yes, the batter is very thick but the blueberries make it very moist.  Served warm - awesome !!

This is very good. Dont need to bother with changes mentioned here. The batter is very thick, but that's how it is supposed to be. I only had a dark pan so had to lower oven and cook a bit longer. Next time I'll find a different pan. Otherwise is great!

Outstanding recipe. I only made a few changes. Used butter instead of shortening, used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1tsp vanilla, brown sugar instead of white for topping and baked for 35-40 min. I think that no matter what you do, it will be good. It is all a matter of preference. I can't wait for blueberry season to roll around. I have also used  blueberries that I froze and it turned out great.

Oh SO delicious! The two changes I made to the recipe were using butter instead of shortening, and brown sugar instead of white (I used white for the crumble). I also coated the berries in flour to prevent sinking. This was incredibly moist--almost TOO moist with big juicy blueberries. I took others advice on cooking at 350, but I ended up with a puddle of butter on top after 30min. I was able to sop it up with a paper towel, increase the heat to 375, and cook for another 15 minutes, and it turned out perfectly.

Holy cow, this is so wonderful!!  I baked this today, and instead of using regular flour, I used whole wheat flour, and I also used Splenda for baking instead of straight sugar.  Even with these changes, it was still fabulous!  I also mixed a bit of brown sugar into the crumb topping and it was divine!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

My father-in-law showed up for his visit with a huge bag of fresh picked blueberries.  I always try to impress him with my cooking while he visits and I didn't want to go thru the hassle of a pie.  This was just FANTASTIC!  The only change I made to the recipe was one of desperation...when I started making the topping I realized to my horror that I was out of cinnamon.  I subbed maybe a 1/4t of nutmeg and added about a Tablespoon of dark brown sugar for some added flavor and it was still so very good. Don't think you can mess this one up.  Baked up just beautiful.

My roomies ate THE WHOLE THING in one day. 

I made it for breakfast in the morning and when I came home from work that evening... it was GONE!

Make sure to use good blueberries, I felt that made all the difference. I get mine at my local farmers market. I don't think I'd ever use frozen blueberries... the taste just wouldn't be the same.

Excellent recipe!  That said, I simply used it as a guideline for my own buckle.  I am often unwilling to rate recipes because I rarely make them as the recipe is written.  I have been cooking for years, and we have developed our own preferences, but I am always looking for recipes to adapt and this one did beautifully!
Whole wheat and oat flour for flour; Whey Low sugar for sugar (whey-low.com.  75% less calories and carbs than regular sugar-we are diabetics. And not artificial) use about 1/3-1/2 amount of sugar called for.  Almost always use combination of Whey-low white and brown).  double the vanilla.  Nutmeg in this one. I used chopped up peaches instead of blueberries, as that is what I had. Cooked i a slower oven 325 (as recommended by others)  Will make a raspberry sauce for a variation on Peach Melba, as I made jam last week (using Whey-Low of course).  

Thank you JBS Box for an excellent recipe to make my own.  Not many adapt as readily as yours did

OMG I can't stay away from this dessert!  I didn't read the reviews before I baked, and I found the mix to be too thick to handle, so I added a little more milk and it worked out great.  When I make it again, and I will, I'll try adding some brown sugar like others advised.  The house smelled wonderful while this was baking!  Thank you!!!!!!

I also used 1&1/2c flour, 1 tsp vanilla and used half butter, half shortening.  I baked it in a glass square dish and after 45 min, I turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for 15 min.  It was perfect and everyone loved it.

Fantastic recipe. I admittedly suck at baking, but this was a success. Made recipe exactly as written except for three changes: used virgin coconut butter/oil instead of shortening (which gave it a subtle coconut flavor), used 1 1/2 cups of flour, and baked for 35 minutes. Turned out amazing. I'm going to go eat another piece right now!

This was very good.  Similiar to a recipe I already had.  I add a tsp of vanilla and I cook for almost 45 minutes, but otherwise made as directed.  Nice alternative to muffins.

Good flavor...but something was missing...so this is why I only gave it a 4*. Anyone have any ideas on what to add to this?

Not Good...I think there was a typo in the recipe; I had to add more milk than it called for and the cake still turned out very dry...not a good recipe at all. The taste was "just OK". I was actually kind of embarassed as I had my family over for dinner and served this cake. I am not impressed and will NOT make it again.

So yummy.  I picked fresh blueberries this summer and froze them.  They were delicious in this recipe :)  Have made it a few times for company.

This is one of the best buckle/coffee cake recipes I have ever made.  I have tweaked it a bit here and there as I am dairy free, so I used soy milk and Smart Balance/Earth Balance instead of butter.  I also used Egg Beaters instead of a whole egg this last time. I still get great results and rave reviews.  The only substitution I have not made is the shortning.  That will be the next test!

I used 1 and 3/4 cup flour rather than 2 because of the reviews stating that 1.5c was sufficient. I used butter flavored shortening. Baked for about 40 min. It is really good. If I make again I think that I'll use half brown and half white sugar for topping. Oh I did use fresh berries that we just picked. yummy

Fabulous recipe--everyone loves when I make this. I layer the topping and batter: pour half of the batter in the pan, top with half of the topping mixture, pour remaining batter, then sprinkle the remaining topping mixture on top. So yummy!

I love this recipe.  I have made it at least a dozen times and it gets gobbled up in no time.  I made two this week for friends and family and I only got one piece for myself!!  I always use fresh berries.  I wash and dry and then shake them in a mixture of sugar and flour before adding to the mix and it always turns out great!!

Yummy! I did not change amount of flour (spoon lightly), but did use others suggestions to include 1 tsp vanilla, and use half brown/white sugar for topping. With fresh blueberries cooked to perfection in 32 minutes.  Great recipe.

I made the recipe *as written* except that I had to use frozen blueberries and bake it longer...until the toothpick comes out clean.  It rose beautifully, had a nice texture, and was a hit with my moms' group.  Thanks!

Excellent! Next time I bake this recipe I will use an 11x7 baking pan.  The middle of the cake was not cooked enough.  I also used butter for the cake batter, and added 1 tsp of vanilla.

Very similar to a recipe my mom uses.  Instead of mixing blueberries into dough she places the berries on top of the dough and sprinkles the sugar topping over the berries. Have to bake a little longer too. Otherwise I thought the recipe is ok, but not as good as my mom makes it.

I followed some advice from the others and only used 1 3/4 cups flour I used all brown sugar and used butter instead of shortening for better flavor. Some suggested adding more blueberries which would be good too, but I thought there were plenty with just the 2 cups it called for.  Great recipe for dessert or breakfast.  This ones a keeper

Excellent recipe! The whole family enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe cutting down on the flour as suggested by others. I added vanilla to the cake and topping, used margarine in the cake insead of shortening and used brown sugar in the cake and topping. It made too much topping for our taste so we saved the rest for the next batch. This one is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was very good.  I did make some changes - I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, butter instead of shortening, added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a shake of cinnamon.  For the topping, I susbstituted half of the white sugar with brown.  It came out very good - after cooking for 50 minutes, instead of the 30 minutes as stated.

Wow!!!  This was absolutely fabulous.  After reading other reviews, I substituted brown sugar for the white in both the cake and the topping.  Also decreased the flour to 3/4 cup, and added 3/4 tsp. vanilla to the cake batter.  This is now my very favorite "bluberry recipe".  I cannot wait for the second round of berries on my two bushes, so that I can make this again.  Mmmm-mmmm-mmmm!!!

I was feeling a little creative, so I substituted whole wheat flour for half the white flour and brown sugar for half the white sugar. Whole wheat flour gave it a nice texture, but made the batter a little stiff. Nothing a little more milk couldn't help. I also had to increase the baking time by about 15 - 20 minutes, but it could have been the whole wheat flour or my oven ;-) Added more blueberries (the more the merrier!) and it made an esctatic breakfast this morning! I will make it again. Thanks!

I was a little sceptical because the batter was so dense but it may have been cold because I used frozen berries. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 5 x 13" pan. It baked up beautifully but I did need to increase the baking time by about 20 minutes. For the crumb topping I used cold butter instead of soft and used a pastry mixer to cut it into the flour and sugar. This worked well and created nice crumbs. My cake came out perfect with a moist dense crumb and lucious blueberries throughout. A+ Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have made this 3 times now, and every time I get rave reviews.  I did substitute brown sugar and shortening for white sugar and butter for the topping.  It's SUPER YUMMY

Great coffee cake.  As suggested by "Taylor" and a few others I used the shortening as directed.  Then omitted 1/2 cup flour, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and for the crumb topping used a mixture of 1/2 brown sugar and sugar.

I was so happy to find this recipe. I had received it from a co-worker over 15 years ago and could not find it. Did a search on this site and there it was. I make it with butter instead of shortening and use more cinnamon in the topping, mixing with a fork until crumbly. Excellent recipe!!!

This cake recipe is excellent. As suggested by some of the reviews, I used 1.5 c flour and 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar (but no vanilla). I used frozen blueberries and they worked fine. The baking time was 35 minutes; and the cake was so moist that my only problem was overeating.  I will definitely use this again. Very hassle free and tasty.

Quick, easy and yummy.  I added a 1/4 cup of quick oats and used a combo of brown sugar and white sugar(along with the butter and cinnamon) for the topping......it turned out great.

This recipe was great but I changed it a lot to make it healthier.

For the sugar - I substituted splenda/sugar baking mix - and only put in 1/2 of what was called for.

I substituted applesauce for shortening.  

I used 2/3 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/3 all-purp. flower.  

It was great - next time I will add a warm blueberry sauce drizzle over it.

Made this for a July 4th picnic and everyone LOVED it!  Used butter rather then shortening, 1/2 C. white sugar & 1/4 C brown sugar, added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and used only 1 1/2 C. Flour.  The batter will be thick when it is poured (or spread). Also used brown sugar/white sugar for topping!  This is one of the most tasty blueberry recipes I've come across in a long time!  Thanks!

When I mixed the flour into the creamed ingredients, the batter became very tough and doughy.  It was very hard to spread in the pan.  Did I do something wrong?  It also took a long time to cook and wasn't "fluffy" at all.

Very easy to make.  This turned out to be similar to a blueberry coffe cake.  Pretty tasty.  I used 1/4 cup butter instead of shortening and also ended up cooking it for about 45 minutes.

This recipe was fair, but I think with some of the others suggestions, it's worth trying again. Forgot to read other reviews before making this and will make some changes next time around. This cake was somewhat dry,even crumbly. Will reduce flour,use butter instead of shortening and add crumb topping mid way through baking so it doesn't get so crunchy next time.

I made this receipe I changed the white sugar to brown---brown I find goes so much better w/cinnimon.  I too had to cook longer took longer then recommended.  Others have said not sweet enough.  I served it w/whip cream & vanilla ice on anohter occassion.  This will sweeten it up & so much better too.

I have made this 4 times for my husband in the last month. He loves it. I make it in a 9x13 (double batch) and just cook it twice as long. I also used honey instead of sugar and used oatmeal in the topping. It came out wonderful...thank you so much for a wonderful recipe

GREAT! I made exactly as stated except substituted Oat flour (I'm wheat intolerant) for the Wheat and it didn't detract from the flavor at all - actually, I think oat flour bakes well for things like this! I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for the topping instead of all white sugar! Overall just terrific!! Thanks for the post! I LOVED it!

After reading over several of the reviews, I made some changes. I wanted to make a large pan, so I pretty much doubled everything to fill a 9x13 pan. Turned out wonderful! Here are my changes, I used Butter Crisco and did cut back on the flour, for the topping I used half brown sugar and half white. Someone said that it needed to cook longer, that is for sure, I baked mine for about 50 minutes, but be sure to test as going along.

Very yummy. I have made this three times and it never finished baking in 30 minutes. Mine cooked for at least 45 minutes. I will probably try using a larger baking pan next time, I used a 9" pan but it is too small. This dish is like a coffee cake and it stores well too.

I brought this for our office breakfast club, and it was a hit.  Quick and easy to prepare.  I used butter instead of shortening.

This is simply wonderful.  Moist, fruity, and crunchy.  I have used the basic cake and added all sorts of other fruit.  This is also a very good muffin recipe.  Just love it!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I made it with my kids tonight. It is crisp and crumbly on top and very moist inside. I don't think I have found a better recipe for blueberries. Thanks.

Not too bad... I guess I am still very partial to the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" also on this site.  I made these in the mini- loaf pans and followed the recipe exactly.  They came out great!  This recipe freezes well, and by putting them in mini loaves I can enjoy it for a quick treat with coffee in the morning.

Delicious! Made it twice during our last blueberry season, and can't wait to pick fresh berries for it again this year. My family came from out of town and loved it! Thanks for making me look good!

I absolutely love blueberries, so I was thrilled when I saw this recipe. After I tried it, however, I found that you really can have too much of a good thing. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting butter for the shortening, but the baking time was way off! I left it in for 45 minutes and the bottom half was still undercooked. Two cups of blueberries is just too much for an 8x8 inch pan. Next time I'm going to try the Blueberry Coffee Cake II recipe - it's virtually the same recipe, but with only 1 cup of blueberries.

AWESOME!  I just made a few changes like others did.  I had to add about 3 tablespoons of milk because the batter was too thick.  Next time, I will decrease the flour to 1 1/2cups.  I used butter flavored shortening instead of regular shortening and I substituted canned blueberries (drained and rinsed) because I didn't have any fresh. I had to cook it for 35 minutes, but the center was perfect, not too gummy. My husband and my 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it!  That's unusual.  Next time, I will also add vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again and again.

Great recipe! I did take the advice of other reviewers and add vanilla (& I used butter not shortening). I discovered, while making the topping, that I did not have any cinnamon left, so I used 1/2 tsp allspice instead. I baked it at 375 for 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious, very blueberry. However it definitely needed more than a half-hour of baking, unless you want pudding. I put it in for at least twenty minutes longer, and even then it only set after thorough cooling.

I made this for my Wednesday morning play group and everyone seemed to like it.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and baked it an extra 20 minutes in an 8x8 square dish.  I thought it had a little too much flour taste, so I might cut back a little on it.  Overall, it was very good!

The whole family loved the blueberry buckle and the kids enjoyed helping me make it.  Like other reviews, I needed to bake it about 15 minutes longer than what was called for in the recipe. I increased the amount of blueberries to 2 1/2 cups.

This was so moist and delicious. My only problem is that 8x8 is not big enough. My family loved it so much that they ate the whole thing in about 4 hours!!

Came out great the first time I tried it. I used fresh blueberries and an 8" round 3" deep pan instead of the 8x8. Had to up the baking time by maybe 15 minutes, till a knife in the center came out clean. It formed a wonderful crown. I dusted with powdered sugar and people loved it. Very moist.

Turned out great! Took 45 min to bake, I think the 25 min might be a typo, but other than that it’s a great recipe. Don’t change anything, it’s perfect as is.

I made the recipe exactly as posted. I kept reviewing the ingredients to make sure I didn’t misread the amounts of flour or milk - was very concerned the dough-like batter was too dense because it definitely was dumpable vs pourable. The baking time is off by quite a bit as well. I kept it in for 30 minutes, toothpick checks done, not quite clean but sort of “close”. Removed from the oven after 35 minutes and center still was not done, but my concern that the perimeter of the cake would be too dry led me to remove from the oven. I had reviewed comments beforehand which were helpful, but was disappointed with the results. The outside of the cake tasted great as well as the streusel crumbs on top. I’ll make again but will alter pan size to 9x9, consider decreasing flour to 1 1/2 cups and waiting longer to remove.

Loved by all!  The only change I made was to add cinnamon to the batter.  I also doubled it for a 9x13 pan but kept the topping the same.  It was perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Only change was cooking time of 60 minutes at 375F.  Placed foil cover after 30 minutes to prevent furthering browning of the topping.  The result was a delicious, moist cake with a sweet crunchy top.

This cake was delicious.  I lost my grandmothers recipe for Blueberry Buckle several years ago and have tried many recipes since,trying to duplicate it to no avail, that is until now.  This is exactly like my grandmothers cake - my sister thinks so too!  The only addition I made was 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter.  Moist and delicious, just sweet enough, with a nice crunchy cinnamon sugar topping and loads of blueberries - yum!!

Very good.  Make sure to check the middle of the buckle before removing from the oven.  I undercooked mine the first time I made this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did have a carton of buttermilk I needed to use up, so i did use that in lieu of regular milk.   I also live at 7500+ feet so the recipe took almost an hour to cook.

I made the recipe as printed.  The dough was so thick I couldn't stir it, so added 1/4 more milk.  Still too thick, more like bread dough, to stir in blueberries.  So I pressed them into the dough in the dish.  The topping wasn't crumbly, it was more like a paste.  It's in the oven now, I have my doubts.  I will NOT make it again, I'll go elsewhere for a good recipe.

Huge hit with family and coworkers. I’ve made it twice in the last month and they are all still asking when I will make it again. Only tweak, if you call it that, is that I double the recipe, make it in a 9x13 in. pan and add 15 min to baking time.

I made this with all butter instead of part shortening and part butter. It took much longer to bake for me but our pizza stone was in our oven so that could have changed bake time a bit. I checked by cutting into the center. It was well worth the weight. Instead of fully measuring the blueberries, I put two washed pint containers in. I will be trying this cool in the morning for breakfast!

I'm not much of a dessert eater but had fresh blueberries to use  and tried this recipe.  Growing up on the East coast and now living at altitude (CO), baking is a challenge for me.  I followed this to a T and was pleasantly surprised.  Not too sweet with a 
good blueberry taste. I did have to bake it about 40 minutes.  Will make again.

Yum! I felt like coffee cake and this took 45 minutes start to finish ! My home smells heavenly. I just added vanilla and replaced the shortening with applesauce, equal amount as called for in recipe.

Fabulous taste! I did make one small alteration.  I didn't want to use ALL our blueberries (my daughter makes a healthy blueberry/yogurt snack ), so I substituted 1 cup of frozen raspberries from last year's crop.  Wow! The sweet and tangy mix was amazing!

I thought this was going to be too wet as it took longer to cook than listed . It was browning too fast on the edges it seemed but all ended well. As it cooled it set more and was delightfully moist but not soggy.

This recipe is perfect as is only thing I changed was brown sugar in the topping, which is a personal preference and I used frozen blueberries because that is what I had on hand. Takes closer to 40 -45 minutes with frozen berries

I cooked it a bit longer since I was cooking two pans at the same time.

I have made this several times, and it comes out perfect.  Some people reduce the flour, but I kept the flour measurement the same because a thick batter keeps the blueberries from  sinking to the bottom. I reduced the sugar by 2 T because I often find that recipes are too sweet for my taste.  I used frozen blueberries because I had them.  I thawed them first and let the juice drain from them.  I reduced the sugar in the topping by 1 T and baked the buckle for 40 minutes in an 8x8 inch glass baking dish until a toothpick came out clean.  Excellent recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly EXCEPT ... I did add a little vanilla, as some others suggested.  I takes longer than 30 minutes to bake.  The center wasn't completely done even after about 40 minutes.  All of that said, it is completely scrumptious.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  And SO easy!   Hostess tip:  I put it in the oven as we sat down to dinner so that people would smell it baking.  I'll be making it again for sure.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. You can whip it together with a KitchenAid in ten minutes. I’ve made it multiple times, and this past time I substituted the blueberries for grated apples (4 small, galas) and added some pumpkin spice seasoning. AMAZING

I had to sub butter for the shortening as I found I had none at the last minute.  So I lessened the flour as well to 1-1/2 cups per some of the reviews. We loved this and the ratio of the blueberries to cake was perfect in our opinion. I am already planning another round with shortening this next week. . Thanks for a recipe we've designated a family favorite already!!

This is a fabulous recipe. I’ve made it a few times and it always  turns out delicious. The last time I  made  it I  did not have  shortening so I substituted butter, but  quite by accident I used 1/2 cup butter in the batter as well as the  crumb topping (so double the butter). The cake was already in the oven before I  realized my mistake, and  although I had  to add about 15 extra minutes to the  cooking time, it  turned out amazing. Almost too sinful with the extra butter!

very nice.  Did the changes that many made:  1.5 C flour, butter instead of shortening, added vanilla to the butter mixture, used a bit of heavy cream with the milk.  It was a low key success - so not a fancy dessert, but more like comfort food.  Two people had seconds and 1 of those had thirds!  So it was well received. I served it with whipped cream, but could have been served with vanilla ice cream as well.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! My grandpa gave me a large bag of blueberries to make something for him (they weren't frozen, but I don't think they were fresh either) anyways it turned out great none the less. He loved it and asked me if I wanted another bag of blueberries. I'm sure I will be making this for him often! Thanks for the great recipe!

Best use of blueberries around!   Recipe is perfect.  Bumper crop of blueberries this year and after 2 pies, pancakes, coffee cake and muffins, this is my second buckle of the summer!  And I have 4 quarts of berries in the freezer!  :-)

The recipe called for an 8 x 8 baking dish, which I don't have, so I used a 7 x 11, and the batter was almost too much for that dish.  But it tasted great, fresh blueberries.

I’ve made this quite a few times this summer and it was excellent! Made a few changes today and it is out of this world... I have been substituting butter instead of shortening, use 1 1/2 c flour instead of 2, use 2 1/2 c blueberries and add 1 tsp vanilla before I fold in blueberries and add about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the topping. Today I when I made the topping I did half regular sugar and half light brown sugar. Baked at 400 for about 35 minutes. Top is super crispy and even more delicious than usual!

This was delish! I didn't have shortening so substituted butter and added 1 tsp vanilla as well as adding 1 tsp vinegar to the milk letting it sit a few minutes before using it in the recipe. Spread 1/2 batter in pan, it is super thick, then added some of the crumble mixture before putting rest of batter on top. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes then added a confectioners sugar glaze once removed from oven.

Excellent !  It’s exactly like the old blueberry buckle recipe I remember from my childhood and lost the recipe ... I’m so glad to have found this on Allrecipes.  I highly recommend it, it’s wonderful as is, or even with a few changes here and there.

This was so good!! I did add a little more milk to the batter because it was too thick. I didn’t measure so it may have been 1/4 cup more. Also, I recommend baking it around 30 to 35 minutes. Mine was a little doughy in the center. Nobody seemed to mind and ate it anyway. ??

Sensational recipe, I make this at least 6-8 times a year.  The only thing I changed has been the cooking time; I cook my  for 45 minutes vs. the 30 min indicated.

This was a good recipe except whoever wrote the directions forgot to add the milk into the instructions.
This is the standard classic blueberry Buckle cake so if you're going to use this recipe make sure that you add the milk into the batter before you add the berries.
Finally they forgot to add in the instructions that you need to stick in a knife to make sure that it comes out clean to ensure that the cake has been cooked thoroughly.

Otherwise it's a good parrot recipe.

Everyone loved this.  I doubled the cake part but not the topping.  Used less sugar than called for and added nuts to the topping.  Also substituted sour crepe and half/half for the milk.  I found that less flour was needed (at least 1/2 c).  Many compliments!

What an easy recipe! Just perfect. I’ve made this several times. I freeze in-season blueberries just to use in this recipe when there’s snow on the ground. In fact, I just put another one in the oven. Frozen berries only require an extra five mi utes in the oven.

I wanted to do this exactly as the recipe said, but I didn't have fresh blueberries so I had to use frozen ones. It tastes good, but took a lot longer to bake than the recipe indicated. That may have been because of extra juice in the frozen berries. I'll remember to drain them if I do it again with frozen ones. The topping didn't cook quite like I thought it would (rather dry), but it's still tasty. I would definitely use this recipe again.

Tasted great and was easy to make. I have fixed it twice. Once with whole milk and once with buttermilk. Both were very good. I agree about not skimping on the berries but then why would you?

Simply amazing.  I made it exactly as written and it came out moist and delicious. Made a 2nd one for my neighbor who requested I make it again.

My ten-year-old felt like an accomplished baker after making this. The recipe is easy to follow, even for a novice. The buckle turned out delicious- moist, sweet, full of berries with a nice crumble top. This was easier than muffins and produced a tastier treat. We ate this as breakfast cake and snack. Yum!

This recipe turned out really well. The absolutely only thing I changed was using 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar for the topping, rather than just white sugar, and that's only because I ran out of white sugar while making this. Whoops! Everything else was exactly from the recipe and it was delicious. The entire family loved it and we will definitely be making this again!

I would without a doubt give this 10 stars. It is absolutely fabulous and I did not alter the recipe. It was moist and rich. I had just picked the blueberries from my yard, washed and dried them and followed the recipe. Please don't try to alter this recipe because it is perfect. In strawberry season I will use the same recipe replacing the blueberries with strawberries.

I made it according to the recipe and according o my son-in-law it was perfect.  making it again today to give to him.  It was one of the favorite things his Mom made for him,  I never met her and she passed just over a year ago, I am sure we would have been close friends.  It is my way of letting her know that I love her son as if he were my own.  In my heart he is my son.

This is a great recipe as a starter blueberry cake. After reading some suggestions in other reviews, I decided to add a dollop of sour cream for extra moisture in the mix and used 1 part cream to 1 part milk. I substituted shortening with butter but kept a third of it shortening. I also didn't have enough fresh blueberries so I added a few thawed and drained frozen wild blueberries. I coated them all in flour so they wouldn't fall to the bottom of the cake. For the topping, I used yellow brown sugar but cut the sugar by half and added a few rolled oats instead. The oats gave the topping a bit of crunch and it wasn't too sweet. Next time I would just add another egg in the main mix for a richer cake. I would make this again for family and guests! They absolutely loved it!

So delicious! I had to substitute butter for the shortening because I didn't have any on hand. Turned out perfectly. It was inhaled by the whole family.

I did make changes the 2nd time around.  I used Buttermilk for a moister bater as I found this one to be a little dry with not much flavor. I also add 1/2 tsp grated lemon peel and 1/2 tsp vanilla and it made a big diff This is a good recipe with a little additions

Followed the recipe other than using melted butter in place of shortening and then cold butter to make the crumble with 1/4 cup of flour.  I baked mine at 375 in a 9x13 for about 28 mins

Thank you for a splendid recipe! So good!  

*I made this recipe AS-IS and rated it as such. I have also used the entire 18 oz. package of fresh blueberries from the market. It becomes a combination of blueberry pie and buckle. Also good but I prefer the recipe AS WRITTEN.* Thanks again.

My family loved this dessert! I had to use butter flavored Crisco for a lactose intolerant family member and it turned out well. Though I missed the true butter flavor.

I like following recipes as they are and this was perfect. I will reduce a bit of sugar when I make it next just because I like the sweetness berries give . It's an easy and simple recipe, which got over within 10 minutes of bringing it out :)

Terrible if made as posted! Recipe takes way longer to cook. If you must make blueberry buckle, then  follow other readers' modifications or plan to reduce cooking temp and cook longer.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic. I read many of the reviews and decided to try the recipe first as is, making no changes and it was perfect.  Delicious and moist.  The topping was crunchy  and sweet. I used frozen blueberries, which I thawed completely before stirring in. The recipe called for fresh, so that is technically a change, but not really. Fresh were just too expensive this time. I will make this again and again. The family loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never heard of "Blueberry Buckle" until I came across this recipe. Awesome. I added a tablespoon of vanilla to the batter and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping. Otherwise followed recipe exactly as written. It did take 55 minutes to bake. I put tinfoil over for the last 10 minutes. Perfection achieved.

Delicious but a little too sweet.  Thanks JBS Box.  The only major change that I made was to only use 1/2 C. sugar in the main mix.  Next time I'll trim the sugar in the crumb topping as well as it was a little too sweet.  FYI: I used GF flour + 1.5 tsp xanthan gum and used frozen blueberries and it turned out great.

This recipe took 15 minutes longer than the directions say to bake.  I questioned whether or not it could bake that fast and I was right.  I also live in a high altitude region which may affect the cooking time.  I added walnuts and It was yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

I can see why there are so many variations to the original. I made it exactly like the recipe says to and honestly I probably wouldn't make again. The topping was great, but without it, it wouldn't be worth eating. My cake was not very sweet at all! It was also pretty gummy, although I ended up having to press the "cake batter" in the pan instead of pouring like you'd assume you would a batter. It actually tasted better the next day when the blueberry flavor compensated for the lack of sweetness.  This may be an okay recipe for older adults or someone who can't stand very much sweetness :)

Excellent in every way! I have made this twice, the entire family loves it! I did make one change and I use brown sugar in the topping instead of white.

I added strawberries. The topping didn't come out like a coffee cake topping, tho it could be the humidity. I also added some oats to the topping.

Made exactly as recipe calls and it is delicious. As with many baked goods it is best eaten the first day. It got quite dry the next day but when you warm quick in the microwave it fixed that and was eaten right up by my family.  Next time I may try using brown sugar in topping rather than white.

Absolutely perfect. Don't need to change a thing! It tastes like one of those big blueberry muffins with the sugar crumble on top...except better! I will make this again and again. It's a great breakfast and coffee cake. Would be a nice thing to have made for morning coffee when you have family or friends over for the night. Very easy recipe, simple ingredients.

This recipe is delicious. It is very moist and flavorful. It is also simple to make. I do use butter instead of shortening since we do not use shortening in our household. GREAT RECIPE; you won't be disappointed.

The recipe is good and all, but the cooking time or temperature is not recommended. I baked this at recommended temp for 30 minutes and the middle was still completely gooey! I'm about to put it back in the oven. Probably for another 15 minutes.

Other than doubling it and making two, I followed the recipe exactly.  The baking time was on the longer side... a little over 30 minutes.  Served it for dessert at a get- together and it got rave reviews.

This is the easiest recipe and my family loves it! I can interchange blueberries, raspberries or blackberries. Sometimes I just use a bit of each. I love to mix in the raspberries because they break apart so easily and give the buckle such pretty color. Yum!

This is one of the only recipes that I've been able to make (not the recipes fault, I'm just dense), that looked and tasted how I imagined it would.  Awesome recipe.  PS: I doubled everything in the recipe except the fruit, and it turned out amazing.

This is a great recipe. My blueberry bushes were loaded and I decided to use some in this. It was easy and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, but think I'll try subbing coconut oil for the shortening on my next go.

Awesome as written - except for the shortening (gross)! I always use butter when I bake. I also added a tsp of vanilla. I have made this with blueberries, and also with frozen triple-berry mix from Costco. Both are great. If you're using frozen berries it will take a little longer to cook. Very good with vanilla ice cream.

This is a great recipe! Even screwing it up slightly (poured the milk in too soon) and using frozen blueberries (Note: berries I picked last summer and froze.  Not sure how store bought berries would work) it turned out wonderful.  Everyone I served this to loved it.  I doubled the recipe as I needed a bigger cake.  On the recommendation of another review I did not double the berries.  Next time I'll do 2 heaping cups.  I like my fruit to cake ratio to be a bit less than most.  Of course, it did take longer to bake.  Next time I'll turn down the oven after the 30 min so the bottom and edges won't be so dark.

i havent taken it out of the oven yet, i dont know what happened but it ended up like a dough and not a batter and i had to press my blueberries in.... i am just crossing my fingers that it turns out. i am taking the advice of one of the reviews and cooking it for 50 minutes. because yeah theres no way thats going to be done in 30.
---
ive taken it out and it looks fine. 50 minutes was just enough time for it, about 20 minutes in i found out that i had to stick a pan underneath it to catch the drippings?! probably due to the butter/sugar topping.
--
if you  use your own recipe for the crumble topping you will be much happier with the results, this person must have a thing for chewy  textures. i am more of a melt in your mouth type ah person.

I doubled this recipe and it came out beautifully. A couple notes - 1. I used whole milk - next time I'd use cream or heavy cream.  2. I used half brown sugar for the topping. 3. Baking time in a glass dish was one hour in a closely monitored gas oven. 4. Juices bubbled up and got all over my pan below. I definitely recommend placing foil or at least a baking pan under it while it bakes.  This was my second time making. I brought it to a party where there was a woman who was a buckle "expert", her boyfriend ate three pieces of this! So it passed the test! Cheers!

It was extremely dry and didn't have much flavor. It would have been straight up bland if not for the vanilla I added in or the palm sugar I added in the topping.

I made this recipe just as written.  It was fantastic!  My family loved it.  I took one to my in-laws' house and now my mother-in-law requests it every time I am to bring a dish.

My family absolutely loved it! I added some cinnamon to the batter as well as the crumble for some real cinnamon flavor and that made it even better! Thank you so much for this quick and easy recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I was looking for an easy recipe to get rid of the pound of blueberries my daughter picked, and this recipe was perfect!  I ended up making several batches over a week or so, since my family and friends couldn't get enough.  I made it exactly as written, and it was amazing!

AMAZING recipe! The cake is fluffy and moist...the blueberry flavor prevails, and the crumble on top is the PERFECT crunchy accompaniment. I made two minor tweaks for my own taste to the crumble...I swapped the white sugar in for brown, and I added a 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger. I will be making this recipe for the rest of my life...it's that good!

I made the recipe as is, except that I substituted shortening for butter because that's what I had. The flavors are fine, the topping is very tasty and there's plenty of delicious blueberries. If I ever make it again, I'll probably add a little vanilla to the batter.

I followed the directions exactly as listed.  The cake did not cook in the middle- still too gooey after 45 minutes in the oven.  The edges cooked well, but not consistent through out.  Perhaps a shallower pan than the 8x8 next time- but I wouldn't recommend it.

VERY good EXACTLY as written, BUT the cooking time is off. My only change was I made it in a 9x9 instead of 8x8, and I had hot goop at 25 min. At about 40 min it was done and DELICIOUS! Grease the pan with butter, and you will be rewarded with a tasty, crisp, slightly salty exterior.

I read a few reviews and substitute the oil for butter, used the 1 tsp of almond or vanilla extract, and used less flour (1 1/2 cup) and the buckle came out perfect! I made this for my mom and husband and they loved it! This recipe is a keeper! The rating is on point.

This was delicious!  I did have to bake it for 35 minutes and also used kosher salt (just my preference). I will definitely make this again!  I have so many blueberries.  I may add a little coconut to change it up a little like someone suggested. Thank you!

Very good!  Followed as is, but used a pint and a quarter of blueberries and added a 1/4 cup of light brown sugar to the topping.  It took about 40 min. at 375 for it to brown properly, but otherwise turned out perfect and moist.

I would advise baking it a little longer OR using a bigger pan OR using smaller blueberries.  The middle was gooey.

I replaced shortening with cooking oil, the middle of the cake took a little longer to cook, but sides did not burn. Overall, very delicious. We are having it with our afternoon tea right now.

This crumb topping is excellent (tastes just like a homestyle diner) and, along with using fresh, organic blueberries, make this a stand-out buckle recipe. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar for the topping. For the cake itself, I divided the 3/4 cup white sugar into equal parts white sugar, brown sugar, and unsweetened applesauce. I split the flour half white and half whole wheat, and for milk, I used nonfat lactose-free. I will also cut this into bitesize buckle bites when I have guests over. Delicious!

Made this yesterday, very good. My only substitution was butter for the shortening since I never use shortening. The cinnamon topping was so good. It is a very dense cake, being like coffee cake, I'd be tempted to put a little sour cream and a little less flour next time.

Yum yum!!! Great recipe! I did double it to make a 9x13 pan but only used 3 cups vs 4 of blueberries, and it was a perfect amount for us! Otherwise no other changes. Oh baked it for about 45 minutes, perfect! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I had to make 3 different coffee cakes for a breakfast carry-in at school, and this recipe was one of them.  It was the most favored amongst the staff, but my least favorite to cut and serve.  The buckle has great flavor, but, it is so moist I couldn't get clean cuts.  The flavor is spot on.  I really enjoyed the topping on this and the crunch that it added.  I would make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing, JBS BOX.

I would say this recipe was unremarkable. I made it exactly as indicated on the original recipe. I did double it and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. The unbaked mixture was more of a dough than batter. I did not double the blueberries but wonder if that would have added moisture. They underlying flavor was a little bland and I wonder if butter and vanilla would improve the taste. My guests said they liked it but no one asked for the recipe. So.... maybe they were just being polite?

We were given a fresh batch of blueberries and decided to make this recipe with them. It was excellent and very moist as others have said. We didn't add anything to the recipe but did sprinkle a butter based icing glaze on top. Delicious!

Absolutely fantastic! My family isn't a huge fan of blueberries, but when I made this, it seemed like there was barely any left after a few hours! I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was great!  Very moist and easy to make. The only change I made was the vegetable shortening. I don't buy it so I substituted an equal part of coconut oil. Very good!  Husband even said it was fantastic!

I made exactly as written, but since I don't use shortening, I used slightly less than 1/4 cup of canola oil.  It was delicious and even my picky son (when told it was a blueberry muffin in the shape of a cake) liked it.

I have made many times and people love it.  I have also made it in a 11x8 pan because I already had one in the oven in the 8x8 pan. Both come out fine.

Delicious exactly as made. Great flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. The only thing I noticed is that it needed a longer cooking time. Make sure center is not giggly before taking out. I will make again!

Incredible recipe, tastes fantastic.  Do yourself a favor  and make this 1 small addition, you will not regret it.  Add 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I have made this recipe 2 times this week for 2 different groups and I am not kidding when I tell you I had 10 requests for me to make them and sell them.

Cake was very moist and tasty, but I found the topping to be too hard - would prefer more of a crumbly texture.

I've made this twice and both times have had to increase the bake time from 25-30 minutes to 40-45.

Other than that, absolutely delicious.

Easy to make and great cake. I made a few changes. 1) substituted brown for white sugar in the cake itself. 2) instead of shortening and butter I used applesauce to help lower the fat content. It added a little to the cooking time but not bad. And the change in the topping made it more of gooey goodness instead of a crumble. But everyone seemed to love it.

Delicious, no-fail way to use fresh blueberries! I made this for a 4th of July party and many people went back for seconds. It was GONE!This one is going in the recipe box.
The only modification I made was to the bake temp and time. For an 8x8 pan, I baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfect. For 12 muffins, I used liners and filled 3/4 full and baked at 350 for 30 minutes and was just as delicious.

This blueberry buckle turned out wonderful! I made the recipe exactly except used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the topping. The cake itself was very moist, bursting with blueberries, soft but fluffy. The crumbs were tender and the cake cut very well into squares and held together well. I used fresh picked blueberries and it was just perfect. Will be baking this again!!

Delicious. Can also be made without fruit. Additionally, yogurt may be used instead of milk. Double the recommended amount of topping though and  lengthen suggested cooking time, as mentioned by reviewers--mine needed 45 minutes.

I made this yesterday. I substituted Splenda for sugar in the cake batter. I had to add more mild because the batter was more the consistency of cut pie dough. I baked this in an iron skillet. The flavor was very good but the consistency was like a fruit cake, very dense & heavy. I would prefer more of a coffee cake consistency.

Very good and easy recipe! Mixed up fast and turned out delicious. I also made this with frozen blueberries, thawed and drained- worked just as great. Topping worked out just as expected. Followed recipe just as written.  Oh, one more thing, did have to bake about 8-10 min longer than called for in recipe.

I made this recipe hoping it would turn out like my great grandmothers... and it was EVERYTHING I wanted! the mix looked almost lumpy but once you bake it it comes out perfect, not crumbly, greasy, or dry. I made it and couldn't bring myself to share the batch! I did add some oats to the top layer and broil the top at the end for color though: )

Tried this recipe and it was very good!  I was a dummkopf and forgot the cinnamon in the topping, but it was still delicious.  My kids ate it right up.  I used unthawed frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and it increased the cook time significantly, but it turned out fine after I put a cookie sheet on the rack under it to shield it from the heat a bit.  Highly recommend this recipe!

I accidentally added the 1/4 cup butter to the shortening when I creamed it with the sugar. However, the only thing it did was lengthen the cooking time. The taste was still delicious!!

The end result turned out well, but the directions were a little misleading. For me, the batter was more of a dough, it wasn't pourable in the slightest. I mixed the berries as best as i could, and then just flattened it into my baking pan. After that i just put more berries on top and lightly pushed them into the batter. The crumble top also seemed to be a little less crumbly than anticipated, It was a little more soft and mushy then it was crumbly. All that said, the thing still tastes and looks great. I have no idea how a "buckle" should turn out, so I'm pleased with how it turned out. It did take a little over 30 minutes as well, and i moved it up a rack in the oven towards the end to brown the "crumble" topping.
4/5 for misleading directions

I am not sure what happened to mine but it was ok. Fit to eat but not what I was expecting. The batter was super thick so I added extra milk maybe 1/2 cup, I do not recommend that. Then it took about an hour to cook and it was very gooey. I think it would be very good had I followed the recipe

I can't really review the recipe as is as I didn't even attempt to try it as written based on all the reviews, though my 3 star rating was based on the fact that the changes I made were great. I could see it being dry using 2 cups of flour, so I reduced it to 1 1/2 cups, I used butter in the whole recipe, no shortening, more flavour! I added 1 tsp vanilla for flavour too. And it was a must to use brown sugar instead of white for the topping. The result: a beautifully moist and flavourful cake with delicious berries and a delightful crispy topping. With above mentioned changes, this recipe is a keeper!

We  loved  this  recipe!  It  sure made  my  kids  happy.  I used  frozen  blueberries  thawed  out,  and  that  worked  for  us. Can't  wait  to  make  it  again  when I  have  fresh  ones.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was really good! It did take longer to cook (about 40 minutes). It did not burn or anything. We had it for breakfast the next morning and loved it.

Have tried this recipe as written here but we were not satisfied because it was too dry.  Anyway, after making some adjustments as fololows it is better for us:  reduced the flour to 1-3/4 cups and substituted butter for shortening.  Also used half sour cream and half milk.  Served with blueberry sauce and whipped cream flavored with lemon juice and rind.............yum

this recipe is decent- I throw in extra blueberries if I have them, otherwise, I follow the recipe to the 't'.  My big issue is that 375 for 25-30 minutes is not even close to enough time.  I usually have to add SIGNIFICANT more - at least 30 minutes.  I've checked my oven temp with a thermometer, so I do know the oven is correct.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  Using this recipe as is leads to a dry half cake/half muffin.  Without the sugar topping it would be close to very plain/boring.  We ended up adding ice cream (for breakfast).  With some changes I'm sure it could be improved, but I don't expect to have to change a 4.5 star recipe with that many reviews.

I had 3 cups blueberries and based on other reviews I doubled the other ingredients except for sugar (used 1-1/3 cups) and added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I didn't have milk so used whole milk yogurt instead. Baked for an hour in a 9x13 pan; watched it carefully last 20 minutes I covered the edges with aluminum foil since they cooked faster than the center.
Rave reviews all around.

I made several modifications as per other reviewers, and the results were still so-so.  It tasted decent when it was warmed with some whipped topping on it, but when it was room temp, it had no appeal and was bland. I may or may not try this again.

It was very tasty.  I did not want to sub anything but I ended up using buttermilk, insted of regilar milk, because I had it in the fridge.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of blueberries with reaspberries.  It came out like a coffee cake.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.

I followed the recipe the only thing I did differently was switch the white sugar for brown sugar, I used the 2 cups of flour and had no problem blending it, patted it down in  an 8x8 pan took about 40 mins to cook.I did find the cake a little drier than I would like. I didn't mix the blueberries but floured them then added on top of the batter and pushed in carefully so not to mush them..the fruit stayed on the top with the delicious topping and was very moist on top, so maybe I will cut back on the cooking time next try, hubby loved it.

This is comparable to blueberry muffins but in coffeecake form.  I made this recipe today, and made the To Die For Blueberry Muffins from this site last weekend.  Both good, but I'd probably return to the muffin recipe.  Same exact premise:  muffin-like cake with a streusel topping.  We actually thought this recipe had a rather bland base.  Not much flavor at all.  I also struggled with the thick batter, until I added a splash more of milk.  Then I was able to fold in the blueberries.  Another glitch was the baking time.  According to the time suggested in this recipe, it wasn't even close to being done.  Getting brown along the edges at 25 mins but raw batter in the middle.  I lowered the temp per others' suggestions to 350, and it took a total of 50 mins.  Overall it's good, but the muffin recipe is better.

Meh. it was ok. Followed the recipe exactly. I compared it to the To Die For Blueberry Muffins Recipe on here, and it wasn't nearly as impressive. YOU NEED to try that muffin recipe! it will blow your mind.

as written, the cake part needs more flavor.  The topping is too sweet and cinnamon-y.  Wish there was more of a balance.

Shucks, I wish I checked to see if I made this before!  I had the exact same criticism!

Fine old Betty Crocker recipe - I still have the book! My mother made it often growing up. I typically have two substitutions - buttermilk instead of milk and butter instead of shortening. It is great as written though.

I tried this for the first time last night. Saw it on foodnetwork.Husband and I have  standing rule.  When we make a new recipe we make as is. No changes!  It turned out perfect.Had to use frozen berries and cook longer but still perfect. Next time I make it I will change just a few things. Thank you

This is an awesome recipe.  I had a bunch of blueberries I needed to use up.  They started to get soft and shrivel so i wanted to try something differnt from pancakes or muffins and this recipe is perfect for that!  I didn't have any shortening on hand, so i used yogurt butter to try and make it more healthy.  Per the suggestions of others, I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour (different from regular whole wheat flour) and 1C of white flour, and it came out great.  By accident i put in 3/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 1/2 cup, so i added a little extra flour to make up for it, and it came out a moist blueberry cake.  I also read from someon else's review and used 1.5tsp of almond extract.  YUM!  Definitely a keeper.  I highly recommend it!

I made this exactly as the recipe read, and while the flavor is very nice, I won't make it again.  It's entirely too sweet, especially for a coffeecake.  Like other reviewers said, it takes at least an hour at 350 degrees to bake - bake it at a higher temp and the edges crisp while the center is raw batter.  When it finally was baked through, the texture was still heavy and thick.  I prefer a somewhat crumbly cake.  This isn't it.

I am only giving this recipe a 3-star coz my cake texture turned out dry and rather hard, despite sticking to its original 2-cup of all purpose flour, milk and exact shortening ratio like what the original recipe had called for. 

The batter was so thick that the air bubbles in-between the berries cannot be deflated and I regretted against following the rest of reviewer to lower the flour ratio to 1 1/2 cup instead. 

The 3-star is rated for its beautiful presentation and delicious strussel topping. However, I will not do it again :(

Made this for the first time two days ago. My husband loved it and is already asking me to make it again. I followed the recipe exactly as written, although I had considered reducing the amount of blueberries. So glad I chose not to, the berries made it so moist. The topping made it just perfect. Definite keeper.

Used 3/4 blackberries and 1/4 blueberries. I eyeballed the butter and sugar so that may make for off results but so far so good. Thanks!

Mmm so good! I followed the actual recipe and did not substitute anything. My baking time did change however.  I baked as directed for 25 mins. at 375. The middle was still gooey so I covered the whole thing in aluminum foil, decreased by oven by 10 degrees and left it in there for another 20 mins. I did double the recipe but realized that I only had about 2 1/2 cups of blueberries...no worries! It is a still a perfect amount of fruit and the taste is so yummy.

This cake was so delicious! I think the only thing I would change next time is do 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2.

This cake was moist, yummy and bursting with berries. I brought it to work and it was devoured.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  I was planning to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the cake, but forgot until after it was in the pan, so I added it to the topping mixture instead and it was delicious, I will do that intentionally from now on.  It smelled so heavenly while it was baking that it was torture to wait to try it until the next morning.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very yummy!  I wanted it more healthy so I used 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 sugar, used butter instead of shortening and ground oatmeal instead of flour - though I could have used wheat flour.  Was very good even with the changes.  I threw in some raspberries too.  Baking time was perfect.

YUM! I baked full time + 3 minutes and it was still under cooked in the middle.  Berries could have been cut in 1/2 and it still would be delish!

I used 3 T. butter and 1 T. shortening just because that's what I had for butter at the time.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Baked in a dark pan at 350 for about 35 min (not sure how long)--poke with a toothpick.

This was tasty.  Followed the recipe except using frozen blueberries instead of fresh (what I had at home).  I can see this benefiting from fresh berries, and will use them next time.  Also baked it for about 45 minutes before the topping was golden brown and cake was done.  Thanks for a tasty blueberry recipe, will make again!

This was the greatest blueberry coffee cake ever!  It was very moist with all the fresh blueberries.  Between my husband, kids and mother in law, it did not last long!  Made it exactly as the recipe was written and would not change a thing!

I remember having this as a kid.  I followed the recipe and found that it took 3 times as long to cook.  All in all it was good just took longer to cook.  It was tasty but not something I would will be making a lot.

I have been using this recipe for two blueberry seasons now and it is requested multiple times.  I always make a double recipe and take one to work, so that I can eat it more than once!  (It is always gone in a flash!)  I use butter in place of shortning and make half again as much topping...love it!

This is a wonderful recipe, as is!  I've made this several times, and made changes simply out of curiousity--it's never better than the original recipe.  I DEFINITELY prefer the original topping--it's awesome.  My in-laws occasionally have Sunday brunches.  When they do, my mother-in-law always insists that I bring my "blueberry coffee cake."  The whole family loves it!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe got raves from my guests.  I had to make another one the next day for my husband (and me!) as it was so good.  Because the berries are added on top instead of in the cake you get the full flavor of the blues.  Yum!

Very Tasty.  I made this twice in three days.  That good.  I made this allergen friendly buy using gluten free flour mix (1st time Bob's Red Mill all pupose mix and the 2nd time was a homemade brown rice flour/startch mix).  Both were good.  I also used oil rather than butter and an egg replacer.  It tasted great and looked so pretty too.  I'm using blueberries we picked on our family vacation in Michigan - I expect to make this many times with our freezer stash of berries!

This was a wonderful recipe by itself. The texture was excellent. I am going to try with the vanilla and split the shortening with butter next time. The topping was perfect and so was the amount of blueberries. 2 cups ended up being 1 pint container of blueberries for me.

I made this recipe and found that it took me nearly twice as long as directed when using the 8x8 inch pan.  By the time the middle was cooked, the edge pieces were dry. It certainly would be better using a larger pan.

This was FANTASTIC! I took it to work and several people asked for the recipe. I did double the recipe and baked in a large round stone. The only other thing I changed was I used 3 cups (Instead of four) of self rising flour so I omitted the baking pwdr and salt.  I will definately make this again!!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but mine was too done around the edge and not done at all in the middle. Dry and bland. Not good.

I don't know why, but I had to cook mine at LEAST 40 minutes at 375 before the  middle was done.  Luckily, it was still moist and delicious!

I made this today exactly according to the recipe with some fresh blueberries we just picked yesterday.  The crumb topping was delicious, but the cake seemed to be lacking a little something in flavor... tasted more like a biscuit with blueberries.

This was so good. I made it for Father's Day dessert, and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe, and only had 2 cups of fresh blueberries, so I used 2 cups of additional frozen blueberries, and it worked great! My husband said it was one of the best desserts I've made (and I've made a lot!)

I made this last night...it turned out fantastic!  I altered it by using strawberries instead, because we had gone strawberry picking the day before.  It is delicious.  I can't figure out how to make the streusel topping though...it says sprinkle, but mine turned out so moist theres no way it could be sprinkled.  Any tips?

YUMMY! I used butter instead of shortening, frozen blueberries that I thawed and I doubled the topping. Cooked about 40-45 mins in an 11X7 glass dish! Was excellent!  Would like to try with other fruit such as strawberries or even peaches.

I made this as a part of Easter brunch, and it was amazing. I used 1 2/3 cup of flour, butter instead of shortening, and added pecans to the topping. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I tried using frozen berries and doubled the recipe in a 9X13 pan.  I had to cook it covered for 1 1/2 hours but it turned out pretty good, the texture was about like a muffin maybe a little heavier.  I think next time I make it I will try the fresh blueberries.  The crispy topping was to die for.

Very good!  I was a bit nervous at first because the dough was so dense when I was mixing it, but it turned out great.  The sugar topping adds a lot to it.  My only problem is that it took around 45 min for the cook time, but other than that it was delic.

Topping and edges taste great, but the rest is pretty dry.  I followed exactly what the recipe says, but it just wasn't moist enough.

Made with blueberries that were frozen, so the color ran, but it was still great. Had to bake it a little longer though.

Made this per the recipe instructions with fresh blueberries.  It is a fantastic recipe.  Nice and light with great flavor.  Good with powdered sugar, a little spread of butter or just plain.  You will not be disappointed.

The only things I changed were that I used butter instead of shortening and I added pecans to the crumbs. Awesome recipe. I made this several times this summer and everybody LOVES it. Thank you so much for sharing.

I used frozen blueberries and ended up not baking it quite long enough.  The middle wasn't quite done, but everything else tasted really good.  My parents and picky brother approved so that's good enough for me.

Excellent.  Used butter instead of shortening and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I Used frozen berries and dusted them lightly with flour.  Served cake warm with vanilla ice cream.

Perfect recipe as is! Made this dessert for a big cookout we hosted and everyone was asking me where I bought it!  I have also thrown in strawberries and raspberries for color and an extra kick of flavor.

Very delicious! I also added the tsp of vanilla and made the topping with brown sugar and white sugar like the other comments said, but those were the only things I changed. It was great.  My grandma loved it.  I did have to bake it for 40minutes because it wasnt done in the center after 30.  Definitely make again!

This cake was simple and tasty although I found it very difficult to work with.  The batter was extremely thick and it was difficult to pat it into the pan.  I also thought it was too dry.  I followed the directions exactly so I don't know what happened.

This was perfect and yummy! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I did double the recipe putting it in a 13x9 inch dish and i doubled the blueberries also, but you don't have to if you don't prefer a lot of berries. at any rate it was very good, moist and the topping is wonderful! it is a keeper!

It was OK.  A little overly moist maybe.  I think this is because it's actually more of a muffin batter than a bread batter.  It was still really good.

I had to bake longer than the recommended time, edges were dry, but center was perfect.  My husband thought it was cooked perfectly.  I used half wheat flour.  It was very good and a great way to use up fresh blueberries.

This recipe was a great way to use up extra blueberries. It tasted great but it was a little dry. I also had to leave it in the oven for an extra 10-15 minutes. It wasn't a dessert that I would make over and over however. Maybe it was the blueberries I used, or maybe I'm just not a big fan of blueberries but overall this recipe was worth it.

Wonderful!!!  I changed it---I doubled the recipe.  If you are going to make a mess, you might as well make two of them.  I also used brown sugar instead of white since that is how my family likes the topping.  Thanks for sharing!!!

What a great recipe!  Not too sweet but very satisfying for a dessert or coffee cake.  It came off perfectly!

This recipe turned out great.  I did not have any problems at all with it not turning out good. It was light and fluffy and the flavor was great.  We just loved it.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  Everyone in our family loved it. thank you!

I thought that this recipe had a nice flavor, but I baked it as directed for 30 minutes and it was raw in the middle.  I had to throw out the middle peices, but the outer edge pieces were really good.  If I had baked it longer I think that the outer pieces would have been dry.  I don' think that I will make this again.

My husband loved this!  I used buttermilk instead of regular.  I also used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white for the topping.  It was so moist and not to sweet.  You really have to adjust the baking time.  I had to bake it for at least 10 additional minutes.  I will definitley make this again...I don't know that I have a choice, my entire family loved it!

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but after making this I just had to -- absolutely wonderful!!  I made it exactly as written, and it turned out fabulous! The sweet crunchy topping really compliments the tart blueberries.

Pretty good - tasted better the next morning.  It is very similar to a blueberry muffin with crunch topping.  Suggestion:  The topping get nice and crunchy, but when it's cut...it breaks off in a sheet.  I think next time I will put down 1/2 batter, 1/2 topping then rest of batter then topping to make more like a coffee cake.

I replaced the shortening with the same amount of canola oil to lighten it up and it turned out great!  Though it did take about 15 minutes longer to cook.

Good cake with excellent topping. Try some cinnamon and nutmeg in the cake next time. When doubling the recipe, bake in two 8x8 pans.

This was a delicious recipe.  It was just as good reheated the next day.  Don't be alarmed if the batter seems a bit thick.  I also had to cook it a considerably while longer than the recipe calls for.

Yum--delicious! The topping created a perfect streusel layer that stuck on well. I used butter instead of shortening because that's what I had. It also took me 10 minutes longer to bake.

Holy moly this was good. I ended up adding a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but I'm not sure if I could detect it, so I may leave it out next time. This is a wonderful recipe as is, and it was delicious! This was my first time making a buckle and I didn't realize how THICK the batter would be. Luckily, it cooked up beautifully, and the blueberries were evenly spread throughout. Remember to use cold butter for the topping. I can't wait to make it again!

This turned out great, although I did change things just a bit. I added a splash of vanilla and used margarine instead of shortening in the dough. I used brown sugar for the streusal topping instead of white sugar. I was really worried because the "batter" was more like scone dough, but it turned out great! It also works well with dairy free substitutions.

Delicious! The whole family enjoyed this one. I had some trouble because the batter was way too thick and I had to add 1/4 cup more milk. Turned out fine, but I would probably listen to the other reviewers when they said to put only 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2. Turned out fine with more milk also. Another thing is that next time I'll definitely use some vanilla, 1 tsp., and add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. This will give the cake part more flavor and some texture. Overall, this is a great recipe. I made it for company and they asked me for the recipe!

This was fantastic. I made it exactly as written. The topping was fantastic, I will use that topping recipe for everything now. The only bad part was that berries I bought were tasteless. This recipe made them taste pretty good. I will make this recipe again and again.

This was great. I did substitute butter for shortening and had to cook for 45 minutes, but figured that you have to account for the moisture in the berries and everyone oven is different.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe exactly and also used butter flavored shortening and did need to add a touch more milk, but it turned out as it should.  My husband had two big helpings as soon as it cooled enough to eat.  Very yummy, thank you for submitting this one!

Very good! This is similar to the Alton Brown recipe.  I added half teaspoon of ginger.  Also, I experimented in doing a healthier version and the outcome was shockingly good.  I subed for the shortening and butter a 1/2 cup of applesauce + 1 tablespoon of canola oil and also used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1/4 cup of white. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup because of the sweet from the applesauce. For the topping a used a mix of brown sugar, flour, canola oil and nutmeg - just enough for a light sprinkle.  Both the full fat version and the "healthy" are very good.

This was fantastic!  And easy to make too, which is a major bonus.  I wish I had read the reviews before making it, I also found that 2 C of flour was too much, but I added a bit more milk to thin it a bit (and that still worked great).  The batter is very thick, it is supposed to be.  So rather than "pouring" the batter you have to scoop it out and drop it in.  We used huckleberries instead of blueberries and it is amazing!  But as other recommended, I think it could be complemented with a bit of vanilla or almond extract.  I might even throw in some sliced almonds on top next time too!  I will definitely be making this again!

Amazing!  It did take longer to cook than in the directions.  I cooked an additional 10 minutes and it still sunk in the middle when taken out of the oven...I liked a little of the "gooey" in the middle though.

followed recipe to a 'T'. had to bake for 40-45 minutes though as the middle was still quite raw at 30. i used a gas oven and a glass 8x8 baking pan, not sure if that makes a difference. taste was fantastic, could be served as a dessert alongside a scoop of vanilla ice cream as well!

Very yummy - I ended up having to bake it 20 minutes more than the recipe called for. As suggested by other reviewers, I also added a little vanilla and lemon zest. Next time for the topping I may use half regular sugar and half brown sugar - we'll see!

This was super yummy!!! very simple and easy! The only thing I did different was I added about a teaspoon of almond extract and vanilla extract. It was very flavorful and I think it did the trick. You have to keep an eye on it so you dont over bake it, the juices from the blueberries make it deceiving. I will be making this for years to come! loved it!

This got raves from friends and family.  Personally, I like a more fruity cobbler, but it went over so well, I know I'll make it many times.  I thought it was really tasty.  Also, I had a bunch of berries, and everything else was stuff I had in the pantry -- easy!

I actually made 3 of these in the past 24 hours. I made the first one, and realized I accidentally put in 1/2 c. butter in the cake part. Since I was making it to give to someone I did not want to take the chance so I re-made it and had to sacrifice eating the first! It was great. I made the second as written, and decided to make a third to give away with the extra butter. All of them baked up beautifully.

It is really good! I followed the recipe exactly. Did bake an extra 10 min b/c the middle seemed doughy still. But I think it was the juice f/ the blueberries that made my knife look doughy instead.

Taste wise this was a very good recipe. I had some left over frozen blueberries from a previous recipe and decided to try this out, and although I had to bake it for approximately 20-25 more minutes to set the middle, it was still a great recipe.

I made the recipe as written.  It was OK but I thought it lacked flavor and it was a little dry too.  I'll try it again using some of the suggestions from the other reviewers.

This is what I remember from my childhood.  I even have my husband hooked and he now asks for it every week.  It is best with fresh blueberries, but when not in season, frozen will do.  I increase the amount of milk to make it easier to fold in the blueberries. But otherwise, no other changes needed.  Great recipe!

This was awesome!!  Love this recipe!!  Nice and moist.  Cooked up great.  I did use 1/4 milk and 1/4 heavy cream to make it richer.  I added 2 tsp of vanilla.  I cut the flour down to 1 1/2 cup.  I didn't do the brown sugar in the topping and I think it turned out great.  The topping was just a little crisp the way you would expect.  It was great!!  This is a keeper!!

This recipe is great! I've made it twice and it only lasts about 48 hours in my house. I will say that it is a little thick after mixing all the ingredients together. I added a little more milk to make it more manageable. All in all it's a great recipe!

This recipe is simply fabulous - I found it when looking for a dessert recipe using blueberries and it comes out amazing every time. Add a little bit of vanilla ice cream while it's still warm and you have your own corner of heaven - a favorite among family and friends!

I had to cook mine for much longer than the recipe called for  so the middle would be done.  It was good warm, but seemed to be a bit dry after it cooled and the topping became a bit hard, but it was a good dessert.

This recipe was very good.  I followed some of the other reviews and used two teaspoons of vanilla in the mix.  I also found that I needed to add 3/4 cups of milk instead of 1/2 cup because the batter was too dry to begin with.  It was very easy, and very good.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written. We really liked it. I think I will leave off the topping (sugar,flour, butter) because it ended up hard after baking. I think I will sprinkle a little sugar on top after baking. I am also going to add the vanilla that others have suggested. I think it was just a little bland, but still very good.

I thought this recipe was just average, mainly because I could TASTE the shortening.  I don't usually cook with shortening and will try one of the Blueberry Buckle recipes on this site that doesn't call for shortening.

I made this with whole wheat flour and splenda and it was a bit dry, but that might have been to me switching the ingredients. Next time I'll add more milk.

We enjoyed this recipe.  The first time I made it, I did not cook it long enough.. Be sure to check that your cake is cooked before removing it because it will look cooked and will not be.  The second time I used frozen blueberries and it turned out ok.. Just needed to add more time for cooking.

The actual cake of this was delicious but my topping didn't turn out at all like a crumb topping.  It actually made the cake look very unappealing.  I would make this again and serve it without any topping, and it would be much better.

Very Good.  My family loved it.  I changed nothing other than tossed the blueberries in flour (I used frozen).
I did have to bake it longer than suggested however (possibly due to the frozen berries).  Thank You for the great recipe.

it was ok.
thought it was too sweet for me.
Also, i would like it to have more moist.
It would go good with coffee tho.
but I probably wouldn't make it again not anytime soon.

I really like this recipe. My boyfriend would give it 5 stars because he loves it. I made it once with fresh blueberries over the summer when they were in season, and I just made it with frozen peaches. The peaches were SO good! I think I like peach buckle better than blueberry buckle. I made the changes others suggested ... 1 1/2 cups of flour, big splash of vanilla, substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping.

Pretty good. Beware if you use frozen berries to drain and rinse them really really well... otherwise you will have a purple cake. Still tastes very good though. It does take quite a bit longer to set up in the oven that the recipe states. I think I baked mine for 45 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit for a bit. Yum though!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I'll make it again, definitely.  Since I didn't have fresh blueberries at the time, I used frozen mixed berries (Raspberries, Blueberries and blackberries) and it turned out nicely.  I would have preferred if it had had more berries and sugar.  Next time, I'll use 3 Cups of Berries rather than 2 and 1 1/4 Cups sugar rather than 3/4.

I tried the recipe without any changes. I found the dough too dense to cook in the middle. I cooked it for a total of 35 minutes. The toothpick came out clean. The dough also lacked in flavor. If it wasn't for the blueberries and cinnamon in the strussel topping, the buckle would have no flavor at all. Next time I will try some of the substitutions that others recommended. I would also add some lemon zest and vanilla to the dough as well as cutting back the flour to 1.5 cups.

I wasn't really sure what a buckle was - but everyone that tried this said this wasn't...  it did take A LOT longer to cook than the 30min (I did it at nite thinking it was a good quick one...)  taste was good though.

I have made this three times.  I followed the recipe exactly except for baking it 40-45 minutes.  It is awesome -I may try doubling it in a 9x13 pan next time.  It doesn't last long!!

D E L I C I O U S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone loved it!  I was worried when the recipe stated to pour it in the pan.  My batter was thick and wouldn't pour.  So I spread it instead and it came out just fine!  The only changes I made was I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for one the cups of flour.  Next time I'll try only whole wheat flour and add wheat germ.

Followed reviews and decreased flour to 1 1/2 cups and added vanilla. Tasted great!! So moist! The only problem I had was with the topping, mine didn't crumble like it should have. Anyone know what I did wrong?

This was delicious.  Next time I'll double up on the topping for myself, but it was just right for everyone else.  I warmed it up the next day and put some light whipped cream over it, and when it melted it made a really good cream sauce with the cake.  Very scrumptious.  I needed to use up some blueberries in the fridge before they went bad, and now I'm hoping they will bring some more to me, so I'll have an excuse to make this again.

Four stars because the flour needs to be adjusted to 1 1/2 cups, but otherwise a delicious recipe. Added a little cinnamon to the flour mixture. Made once with blueberries (toss with a bit of flour to keep from sinking) and once using fresh peaches. Yum. Also subbed buttermilk for regular milk one time, worked fine.

This cake is awesome.  I made it for our family night and everyone raved about it.  My daughter is turning 7 in 2 weeks and requested this cake rather than a traditional birthday cake for her birthday celebration.  Awesome...thanks so much!!!!

Very good!  Made this recipe with fresh blueberries.  I may add a full cup of sugar next time and not bake it so long.  The edges came out a bit dry, but will definitely make this again.  It's a nice change from blueberry muffins.

Delicious with a few modifications. Used margerine instead of shortening, increased the milk to 3/4 c, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp lemon zest. Baked at 350 instead of 375 for 45-50 minutes. Family and co-workers LOVE it!

I've made this twice  in last couple of weeks & plan to make it again tomorrow for Garden Club. (you know it must have been a hit).  I  reduced sugar for  cake  to about 1/2 cup, (I always reduce sugar in baked goods) flour to   1 1/2, added 1 tsp vanilla,  coated fresh berries w/1 Tlbs flour. For topping   reduced sugar to approx  generous 1/3 c each brown & white.  Even kids who don't like blueberry  anything liked it.

I doubled the recipe, followed it to the letter other than using butter instead of shortening as many people suggested, and cooked in a 9x13 dish.  The house smelled wonderful and the cake rose well, but I kept having to add 5 minutes because the center was still jiggly.  I think I may have cooked it for 50 minutes.  Even when cool, this cake made my kitchen smell wonderful.  When we tried it, there was a nice flavor, but it was very heavy and on the dry side.  I'm pretty sure it'll get eaten with coffee or milk...but I wished I'd stuck to the Blueberry Boy Bait recipe on this site!  The gals at my craft night didn't ask for the recipe - and that never happens!

This is amazing, I'm eating it right now! I warmed it up and topped it with vanilla icecream and it's awesome.  I used half whole wheat half all purpose flour, half brown sugar half white sugar, added a couple teaspoons of vanilla, and replaced shortening and butter with margarine to make it a little healthier. This is great for breakfast or dessert.  However, it did take 50 minutes to bake, so make sure you have enough time.  I was making it before work and ended up late because it took so much longer to bake! Oh well, guess that teaches me to bake right before work. Awesome recipe, everyone should try this.

This recipe was a huge hit at work!  Only modification I had to make was additional cooking time (because of my oven) of 13 minutes.  I took it out when the toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.

Wonderful!

made this recipe following reviewers modifications and loved it so much I used the same recipe to make blueberry muffins the very next day and they came out great!  the only change in the original recipe I did for the muffins was sub butter for the shortening and reduce baking time to 20 minutes.

I cut the flour to 1 1/2 c as others suggested and also used butter in place of shortening.  I didn't cook mine long enough though - for some reason, it probably needed about 35 minutes (odd, because my oven is usually pretty accurate).

Very Good. I followed the advice of the others and used only 1 1/2 cups of flour. I used 2 TBSP shortening and 2 TBSP butter. I only used a sprinkle of cinnamon and I'm glad I did because I think 1 tsp of cinnamon would have been overpowering. I added about 1/8 tsp of vanilla. I had to cook this 45 minutes for the topping to brown.

I loved this and it was so easy. The only problem I had was that it took almost an hour to cook. I used an 8x8 clear glass baking dish. The cinnamon topping was a little bit to crunchy because the long bake time. Next time I make this I will put on the cinnamon topping half way through the cook time. Other then that it was great. I made it last night and when I got home from work tonight there was only one small peice left, which I ate.

I gave this a 4 out of 5 because i used the suggestions people made in there comments.I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and about the same amount of cinnamin to the mixture, also we had an over ripe banana so i added it aswell and it just made it taste all the more flavorsim!! you definatly need to add more milk if you are going to put in as much flour that the recipes gives.

I had blueberries that I didn't want to go bad so I look for a quick recipe. This recipe is so quick and easy and hard to screw up. I had to give the entire Buckle away, in fear of eating it all in one day! It was scrumptious.

This was very good.  It was moist and very easy to make.  I used others suggestions about reducing the flour.  I did have to bake it a bit longer than it called for as my toothpick was not coming out clean.  Well worth it!

This is WONDERFUL! Every time I make this people ask for the recipe. I frequently double and bake in a 9 x 13 pan. (takes a bit longer of baking time, just keep testing the center w/ a toothpick.)

Not as moist as I was expecting, but still good. I added a few more blueberries than called for and made sure to dust them all w/ flour so I had no problem with them distributing throughout.

This did not turn out great for me, but I did not take the time to look at the reviews so lesson learned!!
First problem I had was that I used frozen blueberries.  Lots of water left over when thawed and I drained the blueberries but still a great deal of water and it made the batter soupy.  As a result, the cooking time took nearly an hour and  the result was a blueberry brick.
The topping came out great when I mixed it, even using white sugar but had a phone call so my softened butter turned into liquid.  Thus, there was no crumbling the mixture on top, just trying to get the gooey mess on top was more like it.
Taste, was okay.  Given the obvious reasons.  With some tweeking, it should be a real hit but if anyone knows the specifics when using frozen versus raw fruits and the trick/s to working with these types of substitutes; please, let me know!!
All-in-all, I am sure my kids will gobble this up without knowing the difference!  :)

I've made this twice now, and have followed the recipe exactly. Absolutley love it!!! I had to use frozen blueberries because mine aren't ripe yet, and it did take a little longer to bake, but came out great. Can't wait until the blueberries are in season. Thanks

This had excellent flavor - but $25 minutes wasn't long enough in my oven.  Tee center was still soupy.
I will make it again and increase the cooking time to 35 minutes.

I made the recipe exactly as written except I used half butter half shortening. I don't understand why people would say to use only 1 1/2 cups flour. It comes out fine with the 2 cups. Just follow the directions and add the flour alternating with the milk. I think this goes without saying, but always spoon in flour and level off, never pack. I sifted the flour mixture before adding in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the topping came out very hard. It still tasted good but I would have liked it to be softer. The cake part was fluffy and yummy. Will make again, but I will try something different with the topping.

I made this for our neighborhood playdate today and everyone gave it 5 stars!  The only problem was that mine took a lot longer to bake, closer to 45 minutes, I even turned it up to 385*, it just wouldn't get done in the middle.  It is great warm, with a big scoop of homemade whipped cream on top!  I followed the recipe, except for the topping, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.

This was a very good cake but my topping wasn't very crumbly.  Next time I won't soften my butter.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla and used 1/2 brown sugar in the topping so it wasn't too sweet.

Wonderful! I substituted the shortening with butter and used only 1 1/2 cups of flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla. In the topping, I used 1/2 brown sugar and added extra cinnamon along with some nutmeg. I also only had a cup of fresh blueberries, so I mashed some raspberries for the rest. It was fantastic! Thank you!

I also used butter instead of shortening, reduced the sugar & decreased the flour (used 3/4c whole wheat & 3/4c all purpose)...and added some oats to the topping.  I'd definately make this again.

I can't honestly rate this recipe (but it's making me), because I followed the advice of other reviewers in not mixing the blueberries in, and cooking for longer than 30 minutes, and the cake came out overdone and dry. It was still pretty good, so I think this recipe has potential, and may try making it again.

Mmmm...yummy! Followed reviewers and used 1.5 cup flour for cake part, used all brown sugar for cake and half brown, half white suger for topping, and added 1 t. vanilla to batter. I felt my batter was too thick before baking, so I added a couple of splashes more of milk. The blueberries must yield a lot of juice, b/c it was not too dry at all!!

This cake is fantastic! I made the changes recommended by other reviewers (one and a half cups flour in the cake; light brown sugar instead of white and 1/2 tsp vanilla in the topping), which were perfect. I also made it vegan with soy milk, soy margarine, and Egg Replacer. I used frozen organic blueberries - I made this once before with frozen blueberries straight from the bag and it took forever to cook, so this time I defrosted, rinsed, and gently patted dry the blueberries before adding them, and it solved the problem. It did take about 10-15 mins longer than the recipe states; I just let it cook until a knife in the center came out clean. Thanks for a fantastic recipe! :)

I followed the recipe and all the remarks (with the vanilla and the less flour...and all of it) but I used frozen blueberries that I had on hand (also because its not the right season for fresh). It wasn't that great. Would it really make that big of a difference to have fresh?

so easy to throw together and great tasting!!  i put it in a 8x8 pan instead of a pie pan.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to grease the pan first.  It might have said to do it and I missed it, I don't know.

Very disappointed.  Not sure why this gets such positive ratings.  My husband and children all said not to bother making this one again.  I agree!  Very blah.  I did substitute margarine for the shortening in the cake (the only difference between this recipe and the one on the Land O Lakes margarine box), so maybe that made some difference.  I doubt it.  Regardless, I won't waste my time trying it again with shortening. Sorry!

Excellent-it's a must when blueberries are in season!  Instead of lessening the flour, try using 1/2 cup shortening. (which is what other recipes call for)  Mine also took alot longer to bake than what is called for-no biggie though, that's what toothpicks are for :)

I am giving it a 3.5 starts.  Very yummy blueberry cake, and I really like the texture (dense and moist). however, the bake time is not accurate at all!  I have to bake it for 1 hour, and let it sit in the oven for another 15 minutes for the cake to cook.

My husband found this to be too sweet, but I loved it, and will make it again when serving others. Thanks to many great reviews... I'm very glad I cut the flour down to 1 1/2 c. I can't imagine how thick it would have been with more flour. Also added 1 t. vanilla, and went with the 1/4 c. each of white and brown sugars for the topping. You really MUST plan for extra time when baking this. Nearly 50 min. baking time. With changes, this is a great recipe!

This recipe was a winner. I used the 1 1/2 flour as suggested plus I added some lemon zest and juice from a lemon that I had left over from Bodacious Broccoli Salad. Plus of course freshly grated nutmeg. I got gobs of comments at my 4th celebration and requests for the recipe. The comments were that it was a perfect mid-point between bread and cake and that it was not too sweet as many coffee cakes are. It is a keeper.

This is an awsome breakfast!  I used 1 1/2 cups of flour as suggested, and 1/4 cup of each white and brown sugar, and frozen instead of fresh blueberries.  I also put it in a 9x13 inch pan and it was still fluffy and moist.  My family loved it and I will definately make this again. Thank you!

This was delicious, I brought this camping for the next morning's breakfast and my family (plus a few stray hungry campers!) LOVED it!  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and only used 1 1/2 cps of flour, and used 1/4 brown sugar & 1/4 white sugar and it turned out perfect.

Incredible.  Very easy to make and I make a lot in the summer.  However I added a twist to it.  Skip the topping and bake for 25 minutes, won't take as long as there is less to cook.  Then make a simple lemon flavored glaze and drizzle across the top.

Oh my! So good and easy.  This replaces other blueberry cake recipes hands down.  So moist. Did use brown and white sugar for the topping and baked it for 45 min.  Will take the rest to work tomorrow to see if the girls like it.  Thanks, Janice

This recipe is great!  I make it using a 9x13 in. pan.  Must be eaten within a couple of days, it doesn't keep too long (not really a problem though, it tastes so good)!

I made this same recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook. The only difference was the crumb topping rcipe has 1/2 c flour instead of 1/3 c and the blueberries sit on top instead of being mixed in. I just submitted a photo of mine to add to this page! I think it would be better if you followed THIS recipe with mixing the berries in! It was too dry with leaving them on the top. I will make this again next week following THIS recipe!

Yummy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening.  I also added chopped walnuts.  Great with ice cream.

I double this recipe and bake in 13 x 9. I also skip on the topping and add extra blueberries on top. They cook right into the cake. This lasts less than 24 hours in my house and my neighbor loved it too.

I did not like this at all.  I found it very bland and not worth the time it took or the money spent on blueberries.  Also, it took about twice as long to cook as the recipe called for.  I won't even try this recipe again, I took it out of my cookbook today.

Very good recipe to have, especially during blueberry season here in Maine.   I substituted brown sugar for the white in the topping and ended up baking it a while longer as the center was slow to cook. I will probably try it again.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  I used 1 1/2 cup flour as previously suggested.  I also used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c of light brown sugar for the topping.  I used frozen blueberries which increased the baking time to 45 min.

Very yummy, and a nice alternative to the juicier cobblers and pies. We like it warm with vanilla bean icecream. I haven't changed the recipe. Didn't see a reason to since it comes out so good anyway.

Made a double recipe so I could take some to a birthday party and still have some for home.  No one even tried it at the party except for me and I thought it needed to be sweeter.  When I got home however, my husband ate half of it and even took some to work the next day (he has NEVER taken anything to work!)  I will make it for him again, however it's just not to my taste.  Thanks Janice.

Delicious!  Very moist and the topping was great!  I did follow what others said and used the 1 and 1/2 cups flour instead of 2 cups, 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar on the topping part and added a tsp of vanilla!  Sweet enough to be a dessert!

Wonderful!  I tossed in frozen berries that we had picked in the summer and the kids loved it!  I hadn't read the reviews beforehand but will try the 1 1/2 c flour, stick butter and vanilla next time.  I did notice it was more like dough than batter but it still cooked up fine. The smaller amount of flour should fix that next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Used 1.5 cups flour + 1 tsp vanilla as recommended.  Used a foil pan because bringing it to a cottage over labor day - next time will look for a deeper foil pan if going that route.  Look's and smells *wonderful*, though over flowed the pan a bit.  Will make a wonderfusl breakfast yummy and snack treat!  Cup of coffee, this treat and a pristine morning sitting out on a deck in the woods... What more perfect end to a frazzled mom's summer could there be?!!

This was my first "buckle" - still not sure what it means - but it was very good and loved by all my guests. My mother was happy to have another buckle after so many years of being "buckle-free"!Very good with ice cream.  (Definaltey more of a dessert than breakfast food).

Everyone at our Father's Day brunch seemed to enjoy this cake, although I personally didn't think it was anything to write home about.  I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups and baked it 10 minutes longer, which turned out to be the right thing to do.

Very good!  Needed to cook a little longer.  Center piece was doughy.  Was out of shortening so I used butter instead.  Will definitely fix again.

Best buckle recipe I've even come across.  I make this all the time with fresh blueberries.  I would try with frozen in the winter.

This was very good. Quick and easy. I made this once in the 8x8 pan and it was gone in seconds.  Second time I made it as muffins, great both ways!

This is SO GOOD!!!  I used frozen blueberries and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 c. milk (batter seemed too thick and floury) and drizzled with a butter glaze (milk, powdered sugar and butter to right consistency) and YUM!  We brought it to a friend's house during a visit, and it was gone before we were out the door two hours later!

I got so many wonderful comments on this I can't count!!  I doubled the recipe, and cooked it longer than what it called.  It was so moist.  I used frozen blueberrys.  Best "Buckle" I've ever had.  Thanks!!--Stacey

This was absolutely wonderful!!!! I warm it up in the morning for a special breakfast treat. It was so easy to make and it really is just great. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and it gave it a really nice flavor. Thanks for the keeper!

Easy to make, I used frozen blueberries right from the freezer and added a bit of vanilla to the batter. Turned out great. I'll make it again.

I made this recipe using a baking stone. It turned out really well since it cooked the Blueberry Buckle evenly. I substituted butter for the shortening.
Everyone that tried a piece loved it!

This was a very quick and easy dessert to make, and my guests that night loved it!  So did my husband, he ate the rest the next day!  My only problem was that I had to bake it for an extra 15 minutes, as it was still half-raw in the center after half an hour.  Probably due to my higher altitude.

This was absolutely amazing, it came out incredible!  I tried to make it again the next day with frozen raspberries and it didn't come out as good, but was still good.  I definately recommend only using FRESH blueberries or raspberries! It was great.

I substituted butter for the shortning, and added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the topping.  This was a really nice, old fashioned style dessert that my family really appreciated.  It does make a really good coffee cake too!
