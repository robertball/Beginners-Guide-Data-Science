Who dosen't make a leftover turkey sandwich at least once? Even better with regular bread, minus the mayo, and using an extra slice in the middle soaked in gravy on both sides? (The Moistmaker!) NOTE: This holds up better when you toast the bread.

We just LOVE these sandwiches, infact packed ours to carry home from our childrens home yesterday.  It was great not to cook when we got home.  Just warmed some squash soup that my daughter prepared...and wala dinner!   What I typically do is combine equal parts of whole cranberry sauce and mayonaise (or to taste) and keep it in the fridge for most of our coldcut sandwich~YUMMY!! Hope you had a YUMMY Thanksgivingm with many things to be thankful for...we did...life, good health and certainly our family!  (our pets too!)

We already do this with our turkey the next day after thanksgiving. The recipe does not call for mashed potatoes but the picture had it so we add some. Next time will just stick to our usual of turkey, gravy, stuffing and maybe add cranberry sauce. 
Just microwaved everything to save on energy.

This sandwich is a must for Thanksgiving leftovers! Sometimes, depending on my mood and what's left, I'll sub mayo for the gravy, or use a nice hearty sliced bread instead of a hoagie roll, and that's yummy too! I think that I anticipate leftovers so much just because we get to enjoy these sandwiches the next day, lol. :)

Tasty way of using up holiday leftovers.  Quick and easy to make.  We added raspberry chipolte sauce for added zip.

I've had about five of these this weekend. This is my favorite part of the whole turkey dinner. Awesome on rolls and on sliced country white bread.

This was a brilliant way to use Thanksgiving leftovers.  I didn't have any gravy left, so I mixed the turkey with mayo first and then mixed in the stuffing.  I added cheese to the top as well so it made it a kind of melt.

My family has been eating this sandwich for 2 generations. There is a fantastic sandwich shop in Tucson Az and they made a killing with the "Sunshine" which is the same as this one but with a toasted multi-grain

Oh yes, we have these sandwiches every year..one of my must buys on  Thanksgiving grocery list are good sandwich rolls.  I like the idea of the raspberry chipotle as one other reviewer mentioned.  Will try that soon.

This is most holy delicious!!!!  We have been eating sandwiches like this for years in my family.  It's a tradition in itself!!!  Was looking for an entirely different recipe, saw this one, and had to come and rave about it!  You can use any style bread or condiment on it!  Some in my house prefer it with mayo or mustard O_o  To each is their own :D  Great great great recipe.  So glad to see it shared on AR!!!!!  Thanks Elaine for posting it!!!

This is a slammin' sub. I know it's been mentioned, but we first had this at Capriotti's. The Bobbie is AWESOME!!! We've been making our own "Bobbie's" for the past 2 weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, and now with more leftovers...we will be making more. Definitely must try this sub!

Ooooooh is right! This is my FAVORITE way to enjoy Thanksgiving leftovers!!! There really is no rhyme or reason to this. I NEVER measure anything. I just pile on the goodies until I'm satisfied with the result lol! :) I drizzle a little gravy over the turkey FIRST, then top with stuffing and more gravy. Sometimes I'll serve these babies open faced on homemade stuffing bread and substitute mashed taters in lieu of stuffing (it just depends on what I have handy). I slather my stuffy's with a GENEROUS amount of HERB mayo for a little added zip. TIP: I like to use French rolls if I'm making samies in the oven. I plop them on a cookie sheet and warm them while my oven is preheating. I find that 6 minutes or so works like a charm. My rolls are slightly crusty (like a brown n' serve dinner roll) and oh so yummy!!! I then add all of my fixin's, wrap with foil and bake as directed. Everyone I've ever made these for RAVES and can't believe they're eating LEFTOVERS haha! Thanks SO much for sharing this great idea with the AR community, Elaine! :-)

So good....use a leftover dinner roll so it was a mini version. Also added a little bit of mashed potato. I think the mayo kinda makes it. Messy but delicious.

This was a nice sandwich with leftovers.  However, as you can imagine, make sure you have a big enough roll for all the food you're stuffing into it.  Very yummy!

Reminds me of the sandwich we always get at Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney.
