Yum!  I roasted the chilies on the gril, put them back in the produce bag and close the top.  Let the chilies sit for 5-10 min.  The steam will help you remove the skin.

Celebrated my 51st Birthday today. Made this recipe and I must tell you it was a hit. I doubled the recipe (we have a large family) and it was a big hit! I measure most Mexican restaurants by their Chili Rellenos. This was wonderful. I used canned Ortega Chili (nice and mild, but flavorful) and made two layers on them...one on the bottom and one half way up the mixture. Highly recommended and this will be a regular item on "Taco Tuesdays" with the family.

This is great! I used canned roasted and peeled chiles, omitted the flour and substituted cream for the evaporated milk.  I made my own salsa, using the Salsa de Cilantro recipe on this site and served it at room temperature of top of each individual serving instead of cooking it with the pie. Yummy!

This was surprisingly good.  My hubby (who is Mexican-American) loves chiles rellenos, and I can't make them (I'm not a fryer).  He said that although this isn't quite the same, it makes a nice substitution.  I left out the chicken at his request and served the salsa on the side.  Also diced up the peppers and used more than called for.  Served with refried beans and warm flour tortillas.  Will definitely make this again for him.

I just made this for my Mother's Day Brunch and it was GREAT!  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to get poblano chiles, so I used green chiles and added saute'd onions and garlic.  I didn't know if  poblano chiles were spicer than green chiles so I used pepper jack cheese instead of regular monterey jack to add some spice.  Also to make it a little lighter I used light evaporated milk and light sour cream.  It was DELICIOUS!  I even gave the recipe along with a pretty quiche dish as birthday gift to my best friend - huge hit  :)  Thank you, thank you!

This tasted great!~and was a lot easier than making the peppers the regular way! I put the peppers in a paper bag for about 15 minutes after roasting and the skin will wipe right off under cold water!

If you love chiles, you will love this.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely yummy.  Next time I would take the recommendation of another reviewer and add both the green onion and the salt to the egg/sour cream mixture.  Using canned chiles would probably be okay, but there is nothing like fresh poblanos.  Awesome!

I screwed this recipe up and it still turned out great!  I accidentially used 6 eggs instead of 3.  I had put it in the oven before I realized my mistake - hubby said we could order pizza if it didn't turn out.  Had to increase the first baking time by 15 minutes to get the center to firm up but followed all other directions exactly.  We ate it for dinner but my "screwed-up" version will now become a favorite for breakfast or brunch.  I'll be heating some up for breakfast tomorrow!  Next week I intend to try the original recipe with the exact ingredients.  Husband loved my version and can't wait to try the original.  PS - being in a hurry, I did use store-bought chicken (Louis Rich brand Southwestern seasoned Chicken Breast Strips) which I had never tried before.  Found it in the lunch meat aisle - great taste!

I love this recipe. So good I made it for my sister and mother they ate the whole thing! The only thing I did different is that I used a steak that I put in the crock pot with a little garlic salt and let it cook untill it fell apart. I also used pato sauce in place of salsa. ( pato sauce is like mexican spicy tomato sauce.) the pato sauce is what is use at authentic mexican restrants on origanal rellenos

This is just fantastic, and so easy to make! The hardest part was roasting and peeling the peppers. I baked this for 1 hour and it came out perfect, will make this again for sure! I added a couple of diced green onions and some diced black olives, served this with salsa and sour cream. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe the other night and loved it!  I made a couple of changes: Replaced two of the chiles with pasilla chiles to add a hint of spice.  Additionally, I chopped up 1 linguica sausage and added it  instead of chicken to the top prior to baking.  So good! Suggestion:  After roasting the peppers, place them in a Ziploc bag for 15-20 mins.  the steam helps make peeling easier. Run them under water when peeling if you're having a hard time. Also, if you split and seed the chiles prior to broiling, it will save you time.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is one of my husbands favorite recipes.  He loves having it for dinner and then having the leftovers for breakfast.  Have successfully used fat-free evaporated milk, and light sour cream as well as reduced fat cheese.  Don't suggest fat free cheese, it won't melt.  Roasting fresh chiles makes a big difference in flavor but canned will do if you are in a hurry.  Once they come out of the oven I throw them in a ziploc bag to cool...it kinda steams them and helps the skin come off easy.  Remember to never wash them after roasting or you wash off all the flavor!

The flavor on this was pretty good, but for me, the only thing holding it back is the texture.  One of the best parts of Chile Rellenos is the crunchy crust on the outside, and that's missing from this recipe.  If I make it again, I'll put a puff pastry crust over the top, or even some buttered bread crumbs to give it a little more texture.  Otherwise, it's just a bit too custardy for me.

Muy Bueno!  I made it in a pie crust and also added some roasted red bell peppers for color, and minced onion, and used grilled chicken breast meat.  Will definitely make again.

I would definitely make this again. It was a great success when I had a Cinco de Mayo brunch at home with friends. The peppers took awhile to roast and peel but I put the peppers in a ziploc bag for a while after roasting so the skin came off easily. I made it all the day before and just put it in the oven in the morning.

Simple and tasty--just what I was looking for. (simplified by using canned chilies.)

This was wonderful I made a few changes though. Instead of using chicken I used BEEF. I've never tought of putting the chilies in a broiler! It was way easier then roasting them on the comal!! My husband is mexican and he just loved it! I topped with sour cream and avacadoes and lettus. In the beef I added onions and tomatoes. It was great. Served with refied beans and tortillas. Thanks!!

I've had this in my recipe box for ages and have been dying to try it, but it turns out poblano peppers aren't that easy to find in eastern Massachusetts.  When I finally found them at a farmer's market, I snatched them up, and boy am I glad I did!  Chiles Rellenos is one of my husband's favorite dishes.  This has a similar taste.  So good!  I cooked the diced chicken with some taco seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used mild salsa, and this wasn't very spicy at all.  Even our 12 month old twins enjoyed it!  Thanks for the super recipe!

This recipe is a great unfried alternative that boasts a very similar taste to the popular dish.

My only gripe is that I had a hard time finding the peppers are the bottom of the pie, and they should be the star of the dish!  If/when I make this again I will use twice as many poblanos and 1/2 or at most 3/4 of the cheese, and repeat the layers twice like a lasagna. 

Still, the most important part of the dish - the flavor - was spot on and excellent.

I received a bunch of poblanos in my CSA box so I thought I'd give this a try.  I substituted leftover shredded rotisserie chicken and panela cheese, which I like much better.  I would also recommend topping with a red chile sauce instead of salsa, which is much better and more authentic.  I love Chiles Rellenos, but I don't fry anything at home, this recipe is the perfect solution, very good!

I made this recipe this week and we LOVED it.  the only difference is I put two layers of the poblano chile peppers (like lasagne) with the filling in between the layers.  This will be a regular on our family menu.

This was amazing!  My husband and daughter loved it. Then my sister-in-law made it and her husband loved it as well. I don't think I roasted the peppers long enough, they were hard to peel. Next time I would where gloves, my hands burned later that night!

I wanted to prepare actual Chile Rellenos but decided to try this casserole-version for its simplicity and was delighted with it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I shredded the chicken as I prefer texture when shredded.  I don't think I roasted the peppers quite long enough, because even though I let them sweat for a few minutes in a paper bag, I still had a tough time peeling.  Forgetting to half the recipe, I ended up eating this for lunch several times and didn't tire of it.  It was fluffy and cheesy, with just a slight heat from the peppers that seemed to have flavored up through the other layers.  I will definitely add this to my list of favorites.

made this a while we enjoyed it, it just seemed to be missing something....I'll probably try it again with a few tweaks....there also seemed to be to much "batter" for my liking.

Really good! Spent a few minutes to roast the poblanos in the oven. Used the 'let it sit for a few minutes in a bag' trick and everybody raved about how yummy this dish was! Did the entire recipe as written with only one exception. Topped it with a bit of reserved shredded cheese instead of salsa and served the salsa on the side. Absolutely fabulous. Thanks so much!

I went to a farmers market and saw the peppers and remembered seeing this recipe, and it was wonderful! I used a rotisserie chicken from the store and it worked great! Good one dish meal, just sliced some avacodos to eat with it, husband ate almost half the dish just for dinner!

I was skeptical about trying this recipe.  I love the traditional chile rellenos with it's fluffy batter, but I was lazy.  I went to the market and could only find Pasilla peppers.  When I came back home and looked online, I found out that Poblano peppers are sometimes called Pasilla.  

The apparent problem is that you can't tell if the Pasilla peppers are hot or mild.  I read online that sometimes one side of pepper could be hot and other side mild.  We found that to be true.

To my surprise, and my wife's would doesn't care for Mexican food, we loved it!  I will make it this way from now on!  

A suggestion though, in the restraunts, they leave the stem on for decoration.  Take off the stem, since that's were the seeds grow and makes the dish hotter.

I cooked this with a friend, it was fantastic!  We made it with rice and beans and it was a fabulous dinner.  It makes a large portion, we fed 4 adults and 4 children + breakfast burritos the next morning with it!  Fantastic recipe.  We ended up layering it in a 9" tall pyrex baking dish and it was FABULOUS!  Thank you.

this was great! my husband doesnt eat rellenos at restaurants but i do, and it tasted darn similar. The texture of course was a little different. I was skeptical about the egg/milk/cream topping..but when it was cooked it looked great! we halved recipe and baked in a 9x9 square pan. i added salsa at the table. i accidentally put chicken on before the cheese...which led to the cheese melding with the topping...which made it look like cheese....which we thought was great :) i also eyeballed the cheese, i just did enough to cover the chiles, it def wasn't 2 cups worth. it was plenty. will make this again :)

YUM! Only used about 1 cup of salsa since more would not fit in my dish and I think that was all it needed.  Broiled the chiles for about 10 minutes, turning peppers about every 2 mins, then placed in a paper bag for about 10 more minutes, skins peeled off very easily. Next time I will remove the seeds before roasting and add more chicken. I hope it is as good tomorrow as leftovers!

I absentmindedly made Ranch Dip (Hidden Valley) with my sour cream a few days in advance of this popping up on my menu! Oh no! So I added ground cumin, ground coriander, and crushed red pepper to the milk/flour mix, added in the Ranch/sour cream, and used an extra two eggs - turned out great! I am a little impressed with myself!

Good recipe, but next time I wouldn't top the pie with salsa because the taste was overwhelming. Some to dip would be nice, or a milder tomato based sauce. This recipe almost cured my chile relleno craving!

This recipe is great and easy. Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe. I tried poblanos in my garden this year. I had alot of peppers so I added another layer of peppers, with half the cheese and meat between the layers.  Next time I will try it with beef instead of chicken.

Simple & yummy. I added a few fresh elements as to not feel so guilty eating so much of this: fresh cilantro, sauteed diced onion & chopped scallion between the layers. This was a great make-ahead served with salad & sliced avocado. Thank you for this.

This is some really good comfort food!  I ended up using a smaller dish (9 x 7) and made two layers of peppers and cheese, with the chicken in between.  I only had 3/4 of a cup of sour cream, so I subbed in 1/4 cup of cottage cheese.  I added about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of mixed jack and cheddar cheese (just eye-balled it, but there was at least a cup left in my 32 ounce bag), and I think that was the perfect amount.  The ratio to the batter was just right.  As other reviewers pointed out, it is not the same as a traditional chile relleno, but it is a great dish nonetheless.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Needs work, basic recipe is great, poblanos came out tasting like spinach, I grow my own peppers and know that from plant to plant or row to row that poblanos can range from very mild to medium warm, as I said this tasted way on the mild side.   I followed the recipe as written and I and my family would like a little more spice. I used Ortega Mild Salsa, should have used a hotter salsa than Ortega mild.  As stated the recipe is great as written, but needs to be adjusted to taste. I used Tabasco Jalapeno hot sauce to jet up to my taste and this was just for additional taste, you may use any other hot sauce of your preference, but I do not recommend any of the red hot sauces as they tend to have too much vinegar and unknown pepper combinations.

This was a hit!  I needed a side dish for my "bunko" night dinner.  I omited the chicken and salsa.  I also added a second layer.  I only had enough fresh peppers to do one layer so for the second layer I used canned whole chilis.  I used colby cheese becuase that's what I had on hand.  It was dealious.  I have made it again, with just canned chilis and regular milk, not as good.

Very good!  I used reduced fat cheese and fat free condensed milk.  I had to let it cook an extra 10 minutes or so longer.   I only had 5 chiles, but they seemed to be plenty.  I will definitely make them again!

So good!  I used ground beef cooked with Rotel and corn and two diced jalapenos in place of the chicken ( I already had the gb cooked- made things easy).  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I had never taken the skins off of peppers before, so that took a little time, but once I figured out what I was doing it went pretty quick.  I let my 6 year old grate the cheese (hate the bagged stuff) which kept her involved.  I will make this again.  My husband and 3 and 6 year old loved it!

Loved this recipe!  I didn't have chicken or montery jack cheese on hand so I just used leftover beef taco meet and mozzarella cheese.  Turned out wonderful, but next time I'll try it exactly as written.

I am a chile relleno freak.  And let me tell you, this recipe is the closest you'll ever come to a real stuffed chile without actually stuffing one.  Be sure to use fresh roasted and peeled poblanos to line the dish.  The only thing I did differently was to top the casserole with my own homemade green chili (containing tiny cubes of pork, chopped green chiles, garlic and jalapenos and a bit of tomato) instead of using salsa.  Next summer I may be making this pie instead of traditional rellenos!

Thank you for this great recipe. My grocery store sales frozen poblano peppers. They are already roasted, peeled and ready to cook or stuff. That made this recipe so easy and quick to make. I plan  to make this again with leftover steaks .

This was good, but not great.  I would have preferred many more peppers. Also, don't let the name fool you - there was absolutely no similarity between Chile Rellenos at a Mexican restaurant and this dish.  It should have been called Mexican Scrambed Egg Casserole.  Perfect for a brunch for the ladies, but not for dinner at my house.

This was an excellent recipe for chile lovers. I used New Mexico Pueblo green chiles that had been roasted. These roasted green chiles have more flavor and heat (which does fluctuate but mine are hot!) than the standard poblano or jalapeno. If your ever in the southwest, grab some green chiles....their so addictive!

I halved the recipe and made this with 3 poblanos. I wish I'd used 5 or 6 though - the pepper layer was super thin, and you couldn't really taste them. This was a quick and easy meal, but nothing really outstanding. Thanks.

This was a good casserole that tasted similar to chile rellenos. I left out the chicken and substituted milk for evaporated milk. Also, I used reduced fat sour cream.

This recipe is OK and for you true chefs out there leaves room for improvement. My first suggestion is to echo a prior post by adding cheese to both the bottom and top of the Chiles. For those like me with a hot tongue I should have probably used a hotter pepper but the Poblanos were serviceable. I think you absolutely have to add meat to this dish...either shredded chicken or steak. I also added mushrooms which were a great addition. Note that there is nothing in the way of spices added to this..that's were your creativity can come with by using traditional Mexican spice combinations. The suggestion to cool the chiles in a bag immediately after broiling them is a great idea..my problem is I don't think I let them cool long enough. I think this recipe is a solid three star as is, with my modifications I think it's maybe a 3.5...I feel it is still missing something. Yes, I would make it again.

Very good dish, I did use pepper jack to give it a kick and enchilada sauce instead of salsa. Very good recipe, Thanks for sharing.

Made this for the 1st time; took the advice from other reviewers -- added more little diced chiles & shredded cheese, used the bag to steam chiles for easier peeling of skins.  I made some changes of my own; used shredded cooked chicken (which I did with a fork), 1 tsp. ground cumin, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, served with sour cream on the side & also put on the table some sliced black olives & chopped scallions for optional garnish.

i've never done anything like this before, but i took a risk and tried this with fresh poblano chiles (just following the recipe), and it was relatively simple and amazing! the mexican produce boy was impressed when i went back the next time for some poblanos and proudly announced that i was making chiles rellenos from scratch! =)

This is an excellent way to have the taste of Chilies Rellenos without the work of stuffing the Chilies.  The flavor is super and it is easy to make.  Has become a family favorite.

I made this for the second time last night.  The first time, I made it exactly by the recipe - delicious!  This time, at the request of my husband, I left the salsa off to be served with the pie - still delicious!  This meal is WELL worth the time & effort it take to make it!!  Next time, I think I'm going to try it with some jalapenos mixed in with the poblanos, just to spice it up a bit.  :)

I liked this but my husband and kids weren't crazy about it. I guess you have to really like chiles. Make sure not to use a big pan, my pan was too big and the eggs were a bit overdone. I think they tasted a lot better the next day.

I loved this recipe.  I love chile rellenos, and the flavor of this recipe was great.  Used Pasilla peppers, and left the chicken out of the recipe.  I also served the salsa on the side.  My husband said "if you would have served this early on when we were dating, I would have proposed then and there!"  I guess he liked it, too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing!!  It was the first time I ever cooked with plabano peppers and I'm very happy to say it won't be the last.  I love  Chile Rellenos so when I was able to get some peppers at a good price I thought I'd give them a try.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, except to adjust the recipe to 4 peppers.  It does take some time to prepare but well worth all the work.

My family and I did not care for this dish at all.  We could not finished eating what was on our plate.  I really had no taste at all, and I went by the receipe.  After reading the reviews, I was so desappointed. I consider myself a very good cook, and I fix alot of Mexican dishes.  My family loves Mexican food, and we go to Mexican resturants alot, and have never gotten a dish we did not love, but this one, I just don't understand how other people rate it so high.  I would not give it 1 star, infact I threw out what we did not eat.

I love chiles rellenos and wondered if this would be an easy alternative and it was! The prep is easy and quick and into the oven it goes. My (Mexican) family loved it and we will definitely add this to our recipe box for future enjoyment. I think I will add more chilis to it since we really like the flavor and mild heat. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

My husband is a huge Chiles Rellenos fan.  I was hesitant to try since it was such a departure from the traditional.  I was planning to freeze for his use.  I am glad I tried the recipe. He LOVED it! The only change I made was I added the salsa into milk/sour cream mixture (because I was freezing for future use).  It was absolutely delicious and I will make again and again and will add the salsa into mixture.  It froze very well.  I found it made 6 average servings.

This was delicious! I used Supremo brand Queso Chihuahua shredded cheese instead of jack cheese because it was available shredded, and it  tasted wonderful.  Be sure to steam the peppers in a Ziploc for at least 5 mins like others suggested, this makes them so much easier to peel!

This is fabulous.  I made it with no changes whatsoever.  My husband loves Chiles Rellenos at a restaurant, and he said this is the best he's ever eaten.  In fact, the whole family loved it.  This is not eggy enough to be a quiche, and it is much easier than making individual chiles rellenos, and absolutely just as tasty, if not more so! Fantastic recipe!

We really did not care much for this recipe.  This was way too eggy, it was like quiche in my opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was really bland.  I thought it could use some salt, and some kick.  I have to say that I have had better Chiles Rellenos recipe.

I think this recipe was quite good. To save time I used canned whole chiles minus stems and seeds. I used chopped rotisserie chicken and did not use the salsa on top but served it on the side along with refried beans and warm tortillas.(Salsa verde was a wonderful choice for this recipe) My finicky husband liked it too and even had seconds! After 16 years he still has some surprises up his sleeve.

This recipe was delicious, My husband and I had friends over and they ate two whole casseroles!! I also boiled two chicken breast with 2 garlic cloves, half an onion, oregano, and some lawry's salt, chopped it up and ladled some chicken broth over it. Also I made one without chicken and my vegetarian friend loved it, I just added more cheese. Instead of jarred salsa I used homemade salsa and topped it with sour cream it was yumm!!

This had pretty good flavor, but I'd agree with some previous reviewers, it was definitely a brunch recipe.  Too many eggs.  It really wasn't creamy like I was hoping for.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I did everything exactly like said but used a 9x11 (didn't have a 11x11) dish.  Only thing I might do differently next time (per husband) is add more heat (more chiles)  Great recipe!!

I thought this was just ok. It would have been better for a brunch, and not for dinner. It was a lot more eggy than I was expecting. I probably won't make this again, but it still tasted okay.

Excellent! Even though I had to substitute some ingredients it turned out beautiful and delicious! I used no melk but water with defatted pan juices, added thick greek yoghurt and one egg. Used canned red peppers, rinsed, the not hot variety (hubby hates spicey food) and I adde a clove of garlic. I added hot pepper to my portion. Great way to use leftover chicken or turkey.

Very good. I baked it in an 8x8 casserole, and in hindsight, I should've used a 9x11. The filling layer was very thick. I put the salsa on the side instead of on top, and instead of  chicken I used leftover turkey. I would make it again, adding more poblanos to the bottom.

Very Good! I put the peppers on the grill for 6-7 minutes and then put in a ziploc for 5 minutes before peeling and desteming. I 1/2'd the recipe, however next time I would use 3/4c of each of the cheeses. It was a little too cheesy for me. Cook at 375 for at least 45 minutes.

I love this recipe!  I wanted to make chiles rellenos, but it was getting too complicated, so I tried this recipe.  YUMMY!  I used green bell peppers instead and it still was great.  I also wanted enchiladas, again too much work, so I topped each serving with canned enchilada sauce and ate with warmed cor tortillas.  WOW, I'll be trying this again real soon!

This was pretty good.  I didn't add chicken, because I didn't have any defrosted.  I will try it again with the chicken.

We did not care for this much.  The topping was way too sweet for this kind of dish; there wasn't enough cheese, and it just seemed to be missing something.  Thanks, though, for an easy meal!

This is really good. I also use like 4-5 cans of little diced chiles. I did not like the chicken and have made it several times without it. I also don't put the salsa on top, it is better that way.

My mother used to make a chili rellenos dish..and this reminded me a lot of that one.  It was unique, filling..yet light.  Everyone who tried it liked it...and I had several requests for the recipe I probably should've roasted the poblanos a little longer than I did..they were a little difficult to peel..next time I will!

Delicious! Would be a great brunch dish. As with many dishes, I actually found it was better the next day as it gave time for all the flavors to meld together.

I love this dish.I use canned diced green chiles when i don't have the time to roast the fresh ones, and it still tastes great.  It is so much easier to make than the real chile rellenos, and just as good.

This was so delicious!  The sour cream/egg mixture puffs up and tastes so good!  I am vegetarian and so I left out the chicken and because of a low carb diet we added cream instead of the flour as another reviewer suggested.  Also, I used canned whole chilies because I could not find fresh.  Only one tip - don't save the leftovers.  They tasted horribly the next day.

I had a recipe previously that I have been using and I tossed it for this one.  The only change I made was instead of diced chicken I used 1 12 oz pkg of soy chorizo and never mentioned this to my meat lovers and everyone loved it!  I will be making this again soon;) Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is a solid five star recipe! The only part that takes a lot of time is roasting and peeling the peppers. As other reviewers have pointed out, they sell peeled and roasted peppers at some grocery stores. Just not mine. I made as directed. I only added to the amount of chicken to make it more of a main course. It is soooo easy for the taste.

I made this for a large brunch. It was really well liked. I did not add the chicken. Chili rellenos is my favorite mexican dish and I always order it w/o meat. This was my favorite dish at the brunch. I served it with warm tortillas on the side. It was so easy, I loved it.

The picture does it no justice! It looks much more amazing in person!  This recipe is very easy - I took another user's advice and put the peppers in a ziploc to steam for 10 minutes, so peeling was very easy.  I left out the chicken and served the salsa on the side, and it was so fluffy and delicious! Next time I will definitely try with some Chihuahua or Queso Fresco to make it even more like Chile Rellenos in a restaurant.

Very Good! I had bits of several different likds of cheeses in the fridge from other endeavors so I combined them all to make the required amount of cheese in this....none was monterrey jack. Some was Swiss, some Mozzerella, some cheddar, some Velveeta...it came out wonderful. Am looking forward to the leftovers tonight. Thank you for posting this one!

This is outstanding.  I had a ton of peppers, so I roasted them, seeded them and opened them out flat.  I then layered them into a multiple layer "lasagna" using the peppers in place of noodles.   I think I had 3 or 4 layers.  Took a little longer to bake through but was outstanding and got raves from those at dinner.  Thanks.

I made a few changes; I used cream instead of the condensed milk, I added another layer of peppers and cheese before the topping and left out the salsa because I didn't have any. This cooked very nicely and the flavor was quite nice the peppers came through well with the extra layer and the combination worked well. Very time effective and easy for nights when you are in a hurry to get dinner done. Four stars.

Really yummy! I improvised with what I had- only 4 peppers, a little less cheese, less milk/sour cream and I only used 1 egg. Came out great!

I love the chiles rellenos I get at the only decent Mexican restaurant I've found in all of central PA, so I thought I'd give this a try.  roasting the poblanos made the house smell wonderful, and this dish smelled wonderful, too.  I kept thinking as I was making it that the recipe calls for A LOT of cheese.  Yep, the flavor was dominated by the cheese and salsa.  The poblanos were far too masked, and the egg/sour cream mixture poured on top of the chicken had more of a custard-like texture than the quiche-like texture I was hoping for.  This just didn't do it for us at all, and we very disappointed.

This was a wonderful simple recipe.  I was looking for recipes to use up my chile peppers from the garden and this helped.  You could also use the canned roasted diced green chiles you find in the store if you don't want to mess with charring the poblanos.

I NEVER give 5 stars, but this deserved it!  The only things I changed were using pepper jack cheese, and I had a little spicey sausage in the fridge.  So I threw that in.  Can you tell I like the heat!  Serve with a dollop of sour cream and guacamole, and do not forget the Dos Equis!

this is a great recipe! bought fresh poblanos and roasted them...(thanks for the tip on putting them in the bag to steam off the skin!) when constructing the "pie" I put chiles on the bottom, cheese, chicken, more chiles, more cheese, then poured the egg over top. my husband said this may be his favorite thing I've ever made! Thanks!

I made this meal for my husband.  He is a huge fan of the traditional chiles rellenos.  He thought it was fantastic.  We don't eat meat so I omitted the chicken.  My only complaint was that the recipe did not say how long it would take for the chiles to roast.  As a result I think I over-roasted them.  Next time I make this recipe I will shorten the roasting time.  Other than that, this dish was a hit.  We can't wait for dinner tonight to dig in on the leftovers!

I was very excited about making it, but when it was done, it was disappointing.  My husband even asked "What's in it?".  We ate it, but the flavor was bland.  Even with the flavor of the peppers, it needed something.  I'm not sure what.  Salt maybe?  Some sort of seasoning.  I seasoned the chicken with SW seasoning, but it wasn't enough, I guess.  Anyway, it was fun to make, but I probably won't make it again.  Hubby had a good suggestion about somehow stuffing a chicken breast with these ingredients and flavors.  I don't know how you could do that since the liquid needs to be cooked to "set".  If I make it again, I'll kick it up with some seasoning for sure.  Thank you!  :)

This was very easy & flavorful.  I grilled the chicken & peppers earlier in the day.  The casserole came together quickly and was awesome!  Everyone loved it including some one who hates sour cream!  Will make again for sure.

This is the best recipe that I have tried so far for chile rellenos pie!  I have tried this pie with mushrooms sans the chicken and also with the chicken.  I believe the chicken really makes the pie!  I made for Taco Tuesdays at my house.  Because I started it a little late, we ate tacos and 20 minutes later we had this pie.  Needless to say, there was no pie left the next day!

Unfortunately, our grocery store didn't have poblano chiles, but I had a pregnancy craving, so I tried making this with a jar of hot green salsa (made with jalapenos) and it turned out delicious.  Next time I would only use half a jar, since it was a bit soupy on bottom.  I'd also only use half a jar of the salsa on top or would cook it longer without the top salsa and just serve it on the side.  It was so delicious my husband asked for leftovers the next night (he never does this) - and it was just as good reheated.  I used shredded chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken and had to substitute  half and half for 3oz of the evap. milk since I only had a 5oz can.  This is definitely a keeper recipe, I'm looking forward to making it again when I can find the peppers, but I'm glad to have an alternate solution as well.

This was pretty tasty but it still felt like something was missing!!  I added cumin, chile powder, taco seasoning, green onions AND diced jalapenos to the flour/egg/sour cream mixture.  It did give the dish some heat.  My 7yr old ate it but even when he finished it, he said he still didn't know if he liked it or not!!

I plan on heating the left overs tomorrow with refried beans and putting them in a burrito.

Delicious recipe, I loved the taste of roasted poblanos.  Surprisingly, my husband gave it a thumbs up, eventhough he's not much of a chile relleno fan.  I used monterey jack cheese(only cheese I had) and ommited the salsa.  Next time I will use the sauce that I usually make for the rellenos, I just didn't think the salsa would be a good choice.  This recipe is so much simpler, no mess, than when making chile rellenos. Thanks.

Good, but not exactly to my taste.  I would make a few adjustments to make it taste better to me.  1. more eggs  2.  insead of salsa on top, cheese, and salsa on side.

This is good stuff. I was looking for a recipe to use some day old (i.e., a little wrinkled) poblano peppers I picked up at the supermarket for on the cheap and this recipe hit the mark perfectly. Followed it pretty much to the tee... electing to use light sour cream instead of the full bodied stuff. At the finish, I strained off some Chi-Chi's mild salsa and spread a layer of it over the pie -- probably did not use a full 2 cups, and then baked it for another 15 minutes as the recipe directed. Awesome! I still had a couple extra poblano peppers to use so I paired it with a Mexican pilaf recipe.

This was really yummy!  I followed the recipe, except I served the salsa on the side.  For simplicity, I used canned chicken, but I bet it would also be good with ground beef with some taco seasoning added.  I look forward to making this again!

This was pretty good.  I made it with grounf beef and taco seasoning.  Even though there is a ton of cheese, I might add more next time.  Also don't skip the roasting part it is very important.

Very good taste. I did not cook & peel poblanos but cleaned and cut into 2 inch squares and lined casserole dish with them raw. It turned out delicious. I will make this again and try ground beef instead of chicken as well.

This was good but not great. I think the reviewer who thought the topping was too sweet must have used sweetened condensed milk by mistake. Flavors were good but topping layer seemed too thick. I would suggest putting a layer of topping down before the peppers to reduce the amount on top and maybe blend the topping with another one of the peppers to get more flavor into it. I used Salsa Verde and sprinkled a little more cheese on the top.

Pretty tasty! Using the produce bag to pull the skin from the pepper worked GREAT, I agree with some of the other posters who said it didn't have a lot of flavor. There was a good flavor but not complex and very mild. It tasted mostly like cheese and poblanos. If you are making it the star dish I would definitely serve with rice or another filler. I will make it again

Very good. I changed it by using 4 egg whites beet till stiff peaks form then added the flower and sour cream. I also added a little ground chilly powder. I omited evaporated milk. It really lightened it up.

This was different, and was well recieved.  I think people were surprsed.  I grilled the chicken for this recipe on the grill, and also grilled the peppers.  Prepared the dish the night before and left in teh fridge over night.  Brought back to room temperature, then backed it the next day.

I liked this dish but it was too much like a breakfast casserole for me.  For breakfast this would be perfect.  If serving for dinner, I would double the amount of poblanos or cut down on the eggs.

A little too much batter and had a bit of an unpleasant eggy flavor.  I'll try a variation using actual pie crust made with corn flour (mimicking more of a tortilla) next time and see what comes of that.  I did layer the poblanos and meat mixture as one review suggested and that was fine.  It was the batter that was a turn-off.

I don't usually review recipes where I make a significant change, but this is by far one of the best things I have made in a long long time.  
I didn't use chicken, but seasoned ground beef instead.  I have 2 kids that I know eat tacos, but I wanted something more.  
I can't rave about this dish.  It was so good!

Made this...it was easy. My husband is a big fan of chicken relleno and he loved this recipe.    Next time I will do it a little differently....I didn't add the salsa on top which caused the top layer of chicken to get a bit dry.   I will use more peppers to represent  more of a stuffed chili relleno.  I will also layer chicken between the cheese and top with more peppers.  Increase sauce by half to cover all layers.  It was very tasty!

Pretty tasty.  Kind of bland though.  I think next time I'll add some Chipotle powder and some salt to the egg batter.  *Update.  I added a can of green chilies to the chicken when I cooked it and added 1/2 tsp salt & 1 tsp of chipotle chili powder to the egg mixture.  Now this is SO good!  It does take about 15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe states though.

I loved this but hubby, as fussy as he is did not.  He did eat it, but he said it might taste better with hamburg.  I will try that next time.

I don't understand how the serving size is for 8 people if only 6 peppers are used.  The calorie count would be closer to 600.  Delicious calories but still...

So...I wouldn't say this tasted just like my beloved chiles rellenos...but I really enjoyed it. I did make it with a half pound of ground beef cooked with some onion, cumin, chili powder and red chili flakes (I just happened to have beef on hand...and I like spice). And instead of using all the cheese inside the bake, I reserved about 1/3 of it to top it off at the end. The only other substitute I made was: instead of just topping it with salsa, I mixed a little salsa, salsa verde and chili sauce together and ended up using a little more than half. 

It really was scrumptious. The only thing I would change in the future (and I WILL be making this again) is: I would, like other reviewers, double up on the peppers and make this more layered. Obviously, this isn't a criticism. It's just to suit my personal taste.

And while this dish IS eggy, it's not nearly as eggy as a low carb version I've cooked before. 

Thanks for the great recipe! This will be my go-to from now on.

We are gluten free so I used sorghum flour (1-2 Tbsp).  Excellent! Made to recipe except that I only had 4 poblano peppers so I added 2 anaheim peppers to make 6 peppers. Everyone loved it and we like Mexican food with a little heat. Easy to make but 1 1/2 hours is true, plan on the time.

Fantastic! I fixed it for company and everyone loved it. I cut the chiles into large chunks so they would be easier to cut later. Instead of salsa at the end I topped it with chipotle enchilada sauce, served it with black beans and spanish rice. YUM!

This was ok ... definately more a brunch dish than dinner, and I'll probably make some sort of version of this in the future.

I thought this lacked a little flavor, maybe sprinkling the chicken with cumin and chili powder would help.  I have another chiles rellenos casserole with whipped egg whites I prefer, would probably not make again, though I like the addition of the chicken.

This is so good. The poblano chiles are my favorite. I also used Jalapeno Jack Cheese. I omitted the salsa on the top. What a great way to get that Chile Relleno fix!!

Great recipe.  I love Chiles Rellenos, but can't make them.  This is a very easy way to enjoy the same  taste.  Only thing I added was salt and pepper to the flour mixture
