I don't know, this just must not be my 'thing', but I really didn't care for this. I know that it's a soup, and it's supposed to be liquid-y, but this was just 'too liquid-y'. I was hoping for more body, I guess. The flavor just wasn't there for me, and I did find it salty. I was glad to try something new, though...

Add a few snips of fresh dill and a bit of lemon zest right before serving.  Very refreshing soup!
