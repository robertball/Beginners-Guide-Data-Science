This recipe is good if you are looking for something to satisfy your chocolate craving without all the sugar and calories.  I do not have Stevia Cup for Cup. I used 8 packets of stevia (each equal to 2 tsp. of sugar in sweetness) and 1/6 cup applesauce to make up for the bulk missing by using the packets. I also used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, light butter instead of unsalted and milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet (they were the same in calories and only 1 gram of fat more then semi sweet). I like these and will make them regularly.

My brownies were baked in a glass pan so I had to cook then for 8 more minutes than listed for a uniform doneness. I liked that the ingredients seemed pretty healthy - whole wheat, cocoa powder and I added crushed walnuts too. 
These are cakey brownies, perhaps it's the milk in the recipe, however, my family prefers a gooey brownie with a bit of crust on the outer edges and crusty top. So not my favorite type but decent enough chocolatey flavored brownies.
