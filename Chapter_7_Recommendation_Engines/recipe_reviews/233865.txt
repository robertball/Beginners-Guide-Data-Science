I loved using bison for this recipe. It surprisingly tasted like ground chuck with fewer calories and half the fat. However, I would have preferred a stronger taco seasoning rather than the spices listed. I was a little hesitant about using the scrambled eggs, but they were barely discernible. The pineapple salsa was fantastic even though I left out the cilantro (my husband hates it) and used only half of the jalapeno (I'm a heat wimp). I can see this salsa on fish and will make it again. I will definitely buy bison again.

We would give the salsa on this a 5 and the taco on this a 4.  The taco itself needed a little more flavor, and no matter how good the salsa was, it couldn't make up for that.  We really liked how the bison cooked up and how fresh it tastes.  I did add quite a bit of seasoning to this---especially using Tajin which was a good flavor enhancer for this recipe!  I would try this again!  Love the bison!
