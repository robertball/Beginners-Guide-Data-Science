A welcome change from the hubby's favorite baked potato.  I didn't have seasoning salt, but used a smoked sea salt instead which gave this dish a nice pop of flavor.   Loved the subtleness of the leeks and the beautiful green of the parsley against the creaminess of the potatoes.  A very nice attractive dish in a supporting role that won't steal the thunder of a main course.  Thank you Bibi for this recipe.

This is a terrific potato recipe for sure. I used one of my pressure cookers to prepare the potatoes. (Steamer basket with 1 cup water, then 5 minutes on high with quick release).  In lieu of seasoned salt, I used Penzey’s ® Tuscan Sunset Seasoning. Served alongside grilled Bone-In Ribeyes  and  red leaf salad.

Delicious! My husband couldn't stop raving about these, and told me I better make them again! I used white potatoes instead of red, but other than that, followed the recipe. I had never steamed potatoes before, and I can't believe how it really makes a difference. We loved them! Thanks Bibi!

Awesome recipe. So simple and so delicious. Cut the recipe in half because there was only two of us, wish I hadn't!

09.17.16 ~ What a fantastic potato dish!  I had some newly dug fresh baby reds that I used in this recipe.  I don't have a steamer so I just microwaved my potatoes until they were done. The flavor of the leeks, butter and fresh parsley just enhanced the flavor of the potatoes.  The first night I made them, we had 'Pineapple Sticky Ribs', homemade rolls, 'Cran-Broccoli Salad' and 'Rhubarb Raspberry Crunch' for dinner.  All the recipes were found on AR.  I've made the potatoes twice since the first time and I'm taking the items to Kentucky to make them for our kids.  They are delicious, Bibi.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

For such an easy recipe, the combination of these ingredients is amazing.  I've made it many times.

I'll make this again. I chose it because I wanted a low-sodium side for a salty main... but this cries out for salt. It just does need some kosher salt. I am happy with this recipe otherwise and it's great in a breakfast scramble, too. I think the leftovers are much more flavorful, so perhaps make in advance and reheat if you want to keep it low-salt.

So yummy!! Made almost as written but left out the parsley, it doesn’t add any flavor and is a pointless herb to me. Added lots of fresh garlic. Will use more leeks next time. I highly recommend this recipe for a tasty side.

Really simple but yummy. The only thing I changed was how I cooked the potatoes to my most comfortable method on the stove.

I had to make a few changes to the directions, but I feel I kept the integrity of the recipe as written.  I had two red potatoes, but they weren't small but still fit into the weight if I cut the recipe to 2 servings.  I don't have a steamer, so I did boil the potatoes until al dente and then sliced them.  For the seasoning I used my usual Papa's Seasoning from this site (so no low-salt there!), and I did get a little heavy handed with the butter.  But these were delicious!  I will absolutely make these again!  Thank you so much, Bibi!   PS:  I just bought some more parsley just for this!

This was a simple recipe, but, a kicked up version to just regular steamed potatoes.  I used baby yukons instead of red potatoes, but, prepared the rest of the recipe as is.   The leaks gave the potatoes a mild onion taste and the parsley gave them a bright, fresh flavor.  I served with grilled fish, but, they would be the perfect side dish for poultry, pork, or beef also.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a nice and creamy change from our usual potatoes. A favourite around my house is leeks and potatoes but with the addition of butter and parsley, they have a smooth flavor that is rounded out by the seasoning salt. Thank you for the recipe.
