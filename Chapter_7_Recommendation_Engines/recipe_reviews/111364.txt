This is the best combination of chicken and fruit that i have tried.  The sweetness from the preserves and the saltiness from the bacon is the best.  My kids and husband request this meal all the time.

This was absolutely wonderful!!!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't have honey mustard, so I used dijon and added honey to that.  This is great dish to make on a hot summer day!  Yummy!  Will make again for sure!  Thank you!!

These were soooo good! I had to use apricot-pineapple preserves (couldn't find just pineapple) and I made my own honey mustard.  I didn't measure anything, but I'm pretty sure I used more of the pineapple mixture and cheese than what it calls for. These aren't for everyone, but we thoroughly enjoyed all the flavors in this dish :)

I've been making these for a couple years and just realized I hadn't review it.  It's great.  I make my own honey mustard with equal parts of honey, mustard & mayo.  Then make as the recipe directs.  I used fat-free cheese & 98% fat-free tortillas.  I spray them with butter flavored Pam and "fry" them.  These are so easy and filling and a great use of leftover rotisserie chicken.

Edible, but I wouldnt eat it again. I didn't like the whole combination of things. If you do though, use extra cheese. They were dry and not cheesy enough to hold the tortillas together.

One of the best things I've ever eaten! We skipped the mustard and used extra preserves with red and green bell peppers and some jalapenos for heat.  I would have never though to put swiss in a quesadilla but it was awesome

Big hit with the kids.  I was able to make five quesadillas, but I did have more than 1Â½ cups of cheese.

Not everyone in my family loved these - but I did!  The dominant flavors are the honey mustard and fruit - and the bacon is the ingredient that I just don't think can be missed.  Yum.

I didn't have any bacon on hand, and found this a bit bland: I have a feeling the bacon would have made a big difference!

This was unique and I ate quite a bit of it, but it just wasn't good enough that I want to make it again.  I certainly recommend trying it once.  It was not bad.

These were absolutely FANTASTIC.  I made them for a party, and everyone loved them!  Make a little extra pineapple preserves/honey mustard dip on the side for dipping.  The swiss cheese is amazing!

These were super yummy and a hit with the entire family.  I added crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce and will either add more next time, or possibly add sliced jalapenos to the filling.  We tried some with the swiss, some with sharp cheddar and some with a mixture of swiss and cheddar.  Everyone seemed to prefer the swiss by itself in our household.  Either way, they were a winner here and a definite repeat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I add a little jerk seasoning to the chicken before cooking.  It's also good with pork.

Instead of using the preserves I mixed crushed pineapple and some pineapple juice with the honey mustard.  I also toased the tortillas with cooking spray and topped it with some BBQ sauce.  It was great.  The whole family liked it.

These are good, and a nice change from the typical Mexican style quesadilla.  I thought there was only enough filling for three quesadillas, not four.  I only had spicy brown mustard, but I mixed some honey with it.  I put some of the pineapple tidbits inside the quesadillas instead of serving them on the side.  I liked the flavor combinations and my only complaint is that the quesadillas seemed a little dry.

Delicious!  We all loved these including my two and five-year old.  Used apricot preserves instead of pineapple preserves.  Added a little shredded cheddar too.

We didn't have honey mustard so we used Gray Poupon but we still loved it. I'd recommend it.
