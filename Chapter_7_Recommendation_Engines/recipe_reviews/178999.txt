This was very good.  I only have a few suggestions.  First I would put it in a bowl to make it a dip because the nachos were very soggy.  Then I would add just a few things to the nachos like olives, green onions, bell peppers, black beans, oh and some taco seasoning mix to the hamburger.

These were better than I thought they would be.  My boyfriend picked out this recipe and to be honest I didn't have high hopes for it at all.  I was really surprised that it turned out as well as it did and I will sure to make this simple budget easy recipe again.  Thanks

I liked this recipe I just made some adjustments. I added beans and sour cream. But even without those @ things it was great. Even my husband and daughter liked it.

Added our own touch to 'em as you should too. We like to add a package of taco seasoning. They're easy to make and satisfy the nacho craving your family gets. Says you can feed a crowd. That's where I discovered that three was indeed a crowd, lol.

OMG! This was the best version of nachos that I have ever made.  The best part is that it was a real winner with my hubby. He's not much of a nacho or taco eater, but I had to make a bit more after supper as he could not eat very much but wanted more for later as a snack at work in his office.  Thanks so much for recipe.

I didn't care for this. I thought it was pretty messy. I made it for a Super Bowl party. I used the nacho cheese soup to add a little more flavor. But, the nachos had a really movie theater type taste. I usually make my own cheese dip every year, and should have just done that. Because it didn't work as a crowd dish, I ended up putting all of the ingredients but the chips in a bowl and using it as a dip. No one complained, but I thought it was rather unnappetizing. I guess soup just doesn't work for me as a dip.

This tasted plain.  Even with the jalapenos it wasn't the right amount or flavor of spices, and we definitely didn't enjoy the cheese soup flavor.  We added tomatoes, sour cream and chives.  Maybe with real cheese or, gasp, Velvetta and some seasonings, it would be better.

I thought this was very good. I didn't use the soup but I used Fritos Jalapeno Chedder Cheese Dip, and put salsa, sour cream and lettuce on it. Yum

Pretty decent, but not quite to restaurant quality. The one thing I missed was appearance and taste of real melted cheese. The soup provides close to the right flavor, but doesn't rise to the level of restaurant presentation. These are very easy to throw together. We are using them for an appetizer prior to the Nebraska/Missouri football game tonight. We had some no-fat sour cream on the side and fresh, hot banana peppers from the garden.

These were good, any time I make tacos I put salsa in with the ground beef b/c my husband hates taco seasoning. The cheese sauce is just nasty (tried it once in my layered mexican dip) so I used real cheese. Put the chips in the oven to make them crispier so they don't get soggy.

Yummy! This really hit the spot. A great snack for everyone to munch on while the games on. I added a few slices of American cheese to the cheese sauce to add a little contrasting cheese flavor and served it with diced onion and sour cream, along with the tomatoes and jalapenos. Thanks!

Made these for the first time on NFL championship Sunday, and were hands down the best homemade nachos I have eaten,and my wife loves them too. The only things I did different, were put some (about a cup) of cheddar cheese over the chips and put the platter in the oven on 350 for about 15 mins., before layering the other ingredients on top. The other thing I did was add taco seasoning to the beef. Next time I will add a littlle more heat,but all in all, an excellent dish.

Awesome recipe!  I just made a few changes.  I added seasonings to the meat while cooking it.  I also heated the chips for a few minutes before topping them.  I included cheddar cheese, warm kidney beans, sour cream and green onions.  My husband said I had "out did myself"!

Kids thoroughly enjoyed it, but stated as written it fed four.  The adults weren't as impressed as it had the overwhelming taste of canned soup that even salsa couldn't hide.  BUT, for a kid friendly weeknight meal this definitely hit the spot!  For us adults I added Frank's Red Hot and sour cream as sides.

Great quick recipe.  We added taco seasoning to beef and heated the chips in the oven at 400 F before loading up individual nacho plates.  I still prefer real melted cheddar, but this was a fun change.

I made this for the Super Bowl game I added a extra can of the Campbells Cheddar Cheese Soup and Taco Seasoning. I used ground chuck instead of beef and added black olives. LOVE IT. Everyone enjoyed this dish. Will be using this recipe from now on.

Not enough cheese in my opinion.  With the amount of beef vs. the amount of cheese soup, it did not bubble with the beef because there wasn't enough of the cheese soup.  I highly recommend doubling the cheese soup, and maybe use a third can for cheese on the side for guests who like more cheese with their nachos and would like it for dipping.

Loved this as a dip. Put taco seasoning package in the beef mixture. Added refried beans with mild green chilies to the cheese mixture and use medium salsa. Top with a little bit of shredded cheese and green onions with a side of sour cream.

These are quick and easy. A real kid pleaser as well. Nacho night is a hit here, thanks! I must add, I use homemade salsa instead of Pace and I'm sure that makes a difference. I've yet to try this recipe with Pace.

super easy! I did mine with mild salsa and instead of jalapeno, chives--just to make it non-spicy.

Simple and easy!  To make it a hint healthier (though it's not too bad for starters) substituted extra lean ground turkey and topped with chives and fat free sour cream.  Yum!

Added taco seasoning to beef and some refried beans. Was okay but will probably not cook it again.

YUMMY! We loved this recipe. Only thing we changed was use more chips and added re-fried beans.

It's good!  I would say it's a little heavy on the meat, so maybe upping the cheese the match would be a nice touch.

I added REAL cheese and not the soup. I prefer real food. I added refried beans and avocado to this to give it more substance.

I have to laugh at the part of this that says it's a man-sized portion because it was waaay too much. However, this really hit the spot for several servings for me and my friend as we were looking for the type of nachos with that liquid cheese. It was definitely easy to make though and didn't take much time.
