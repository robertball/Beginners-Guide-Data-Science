Yummy cookie - you are not going to get the same texture for a cookie when using applesauce instead of butter, but they are still great!  One important thing that I have learned when baking with low fat/fat free products is to NOT overstir (like with muffins) - overstirring activates the gluten in the flour and the lack of fat particles in the batter is what leads to a chewy or rubbery cookie.  If you mix all your wet ingredients really well and then mix in your flour just until homogenous (I fold it in with a rubber spatula rather than trying to use beaters) it will help the cookie to maintain more of a cookie texture.  Hope this helps! :)

Following the recipe's directions, the batter contains a lot of liquid. In addition, the absence of a leavening agent results in a very heavy cookie. I made the following alterations, and the cookies turned out wonderful: increase the flour to 1 3/4 cups or 2 cups (depending on how you prefer your cookies. Test bake one cookie prior to adding chocolate chips, and add flour if needed.); add 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 1/4 teaspoon cloves; and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Experiment with different cookie mix-ins.

I was looking for a healthier, low-fat version of my favorite chocolate chip cookies.  I followed the advice of another and increased the amount of flour added to 1 3/4 cups.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I also followed their advice and added the 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Instead of using 2 eggs I used 1/4 cup egg beaters.  I was very scepticle when mixing up these cookies, but to my surprise they were really tasty.  My 4 year old loved them as well.  Great low fat and healthy alternative.

The dough was very wet so i added more oats and flour. The finished product was kind of rubbery and really the only thing that made it taste good was the chocolate chips. Overall they just weren't all that great.

Made them for co workers and my family, and for not being made with margarine or butter they turned out great. The texture is a bit different but the more chocolate chips the better.

Oh this one is AMAZING! Very soft and chewy, just what we were looking for. I doubled the recipe and this carried us through a weekend of softball tournaments. I didn't have butterscotch chips and didn't want to add more chocolate so I added some trail mix that's heavy on the seeds like pumpkin and sunflower, and nuts and raisins to up the nutrition content. My 9 year old made these all by herself. Thank you for the great recipe.

These cookies are good-especially for people dieting. I used chunky applesauce and they had more of an apple flavor. GREAT when you add about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter.

I didn't have any oats or chocolate chips so I used nuts and cinnamon . It turned out very dense. Not bad...but definitely not a "cookie" taste

I scaled this to 24 servings and used egg substitute instead of the egg and unsweetened applesauce.  Pretty good stuff.  The texture is different than your typical toll house variety choco-chip, but the calories and fat content fit right into our diet in my house.  Thanks for a great substitute for an all-time favorite.

It was great but for tastier cookies put the chocolate chips while making the spoonfuls it makes it more chocolatey because it melts.

Decent Cookie. I ran out of butter and wanted sweets so I made up this recipe with cinnamon applesauce, and old fashioned rolled oats (all I had on hand). I didn't over mix them, they came out pretty dense, and very chewy, maybe b/c of the rolled oats? Tasted pretty good. I'm not saving it to my recipe box, but I suppose it sufficed in a pinch.

Umm..no. This is my second time using applesauce in a cookie and, unfortunatly,  I just can't perfect it..orr even make it right!! I tried to mix the flour as gentle as I could..nothing. Am I supposed to watch out for the oatmeal too?? Oh well..as long as there is chocolate someone will eat them. Thanks, though!!

I was hoping to find a recipe that would be healthy and still taste somewhat good... This was disgusting. Ended up like a flat oatmeal chocolate chip muffin (if there's any such thing) that wasn't even sweet. I am now trying to figure out if the dough is salvageable (I only made a few cookies from it to try them out).

goodish for butterless low-cal. won't make them again.
did add baking powder, cinnamon and a dash more flour to beef them up a bit, I think that helped a little

Great recipe! I used 2 cups of flour and 2 cups of oats to make the cookies more dense.

This is a great recipe.   I made these along with regular chocolate chip cookies and everyone loved them. They can be  a little rubbery if you mix it them too much or cook for too long.

These turned out moist and delicious! I was careful not to over-mix, and I ended up adding a wee bit more flour. Also, I did not cook them for the full time suggested in the recipe. I cooked them until they were brown on the edges and set.

I liked the recipe, but I added choc. chips, white choc. chips and butterscotch. They were fantastic and my husband loved them. They work great in the "butter not available" pinch that sometimes I find myself in.

My husband is on a very low fat-diabetic diet and absolutely loves these cookies. I use cinnamon applesauce, sometimes homemade, and he says this makes them extra special. I use a cookie scoop, use parchment paper, and bake them for exacly 13 minutes. He stands and waits for them to cool so he can sample them. Two each at lunch & supper. When I run out of cookies and don't have time to make some, we always laugh and say he's having cookie withdrawel. He also brags to everyone about how great they are! The only change I make is the cinnamon applesauce.

i realize now that cookies are meant to have some oil in order to be delicious, but this is a great healthy alternative! i added only 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and some almonds.

These cookies are good considering they have no butter.  I did have to add more flour.  My daughter liked them, so they are a nice alternative to other cookies with higher fat content.
