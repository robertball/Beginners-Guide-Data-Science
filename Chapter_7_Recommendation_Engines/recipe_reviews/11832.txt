Oh my god, this was delicious! I left out the Worcestershire sauce though, and added colby jack to the list of cheeses. :) I put one cup of colby jack and one cup of cheddar. I loved this so much I've eaten it all tonight and am going to make some more tommorow!

This dish has really good cheesy flavor but I would definetly suggest covering it with foil. The noodles were really dried out and crunchy which made my family and I not finish our plate.

I switched the cottage cheese for Lite Ricotta because I dislike the curd texture.  Yummy.

Have made it twice. I will add it to my "recipes to repeat" binder. I always add a little more cheese than recipes call for but then, I'm a cheese freak.  We used no yolk egg noodles and it worked out just great.  Its filling too, so a small  portion goes a long way.

this is an easy basic mac n cheese recipe that tastes great!!! plus in the world of mac n cheese this one is actaully pretty healthy since you can use fat free products....i have been making this recipe for my family for over a year now....i use mustard and worchire and i always add extra cheese to it because i never remember to save some for the top...i also add onion and sometimes garlic...sometimes the noodles come out a little crunchy on top but that is how i know it is doner ...my family loves the extra little crunch  :) if you are a picky eater or have texture issues this may not be a good recipe for you....my family loves it but we are not picky...we usually eat pretty healthy so this is junk food for us....very yummy and easy to change the flavor to your own personal taste..and one more thing i think that the cottage cheese is one of the things that make this dish great i think that rocatta would give it a very different flavor....

I love this recipe. I do modify it a bit, however. It is really good with small/medium shell noodles. I like to use a mixture of mild and sharp cheddar cheese. I also like to sprinkle the top with paprika and bake it a bit longer to get rid of the cottage cheese texture. In addition, i use no-fat cottage cheese and reduced fat sour cream. It is delicious.

While browsing Mac-N-Cheese recipes, found this...it's almost exactly what my grandfather used to make me years ago. Very different from regular Mac-N-Cheese. If you like cottage cheese,you'll like this. Brought back memories and what an easy recipe! Thanks, KIM!

I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand, but I wanted to make this anyway and used cream cheese instead.  Yummy!

Really liked this, made it to pack in my lunch for the week or to grab a quick somethin' somethin' in the evenings.  I did substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese but everything else was ledt the same.  I never use cottage cheese in a dish like this, guess that's just how I was raised.

This is super yummy!!! My family loved it. I added One can of drained chunked chicken. And replaced the Cottage cheese with Rocatta just for a different texture.

If you're looking for mac n cheese, this is not it.  The cheese/egg mixture came out looking congealed.  And this is lacking something.  Probably won't be making this again.

I have made this several times now and I always get a very positive reaction from all family members.  Very much like a mac and cheese recipe I loved growing up.

I found this recipe while looking for ways to use up cottage cheese and sour cream.  It is very easy to make.  The only change I made was to use elbow macaroni instead of noodles.  My husband and I both liked it okay.  Mine had a nice flavor and it seemed like a good recipe to make for a covered dish supper.  It was dryer than I was expected.  Husband didn't even notice the cottage cheese in it.  Unfortunately it got a huge thumbs down from the younger members of the family although I admit they are picky about their mac & cheese.  I think it might go over better with kids in general if there was a little velveeta cheese mixed in to give it a little moisture and a bit more creamy texture.  I enjoyed trying it but I got too many complaints to make it again anytime soon.

Wow! This recipe is great and my family believes I can actually cook now! I've even been told that my mac n' cheese recipe is better than my grandmother's. High praise indeed.

This was easy to make!  I used fat free dairy products and it still had a lot of flavor.  I will make it again.  I'm not sure what the recipe meant by two cups of noodles, but I used 8 oz.

I substituted part skim ricotta for cottage cheese and threw in a tablespoon of paprika. Used light sour cream & skim milk. Also used mexican cheese blend for the top. It was so good. Rich and creamy and DELICIOUS! My seven year old son (who is used to that junky mac n' cheese in a box) wolfed it down and asked for more. Great recipe and easy to adjust to your family's tastes.

very good! What I did was I did not use the Worcestershire sauce, I used 2 cups elbow macaroni, and on top of the cheddar I also added 1/4 of a 1 lb block of velveeta cheese to make it more creamy because many had complained that this was too dry! You must cover this for the hour baking time otherwise it will dry out! you could take out every so often and stir, and let it sit for a few minutes after it comes out to set! This is very good!! Even people who don't like cottage cheese, you can't taste it and if you are THAT worried just go without I have faith that it will still be good!

It was pretty good but not great.  The additional salt made it a little too salty because of the cottage cheese.  I also like my food to look good and not just taste good.  The cottage cheese made it look a little gross.

This was quick and easy to make, and had a pretty good flavor, but was a little bland. I'm not quite sure what was missing, but I might try adding dry mustard and/or red pepper to spice it up.

We love this!  I will usually make this recipe for when I make a homemade mac n cheese.  I prefer to eat it the first day it's made because after that, it dries up a bit.

not super, but not awful either.  it just didn't have much going on.  even my kids kept complaining that it didn't have any flavor (and believe me, they don't normally like anything above middle of the road when it comes to seasonings). we ended up adding a lot of additional salt and that still didn't do much for it.  i did substitute ricotta chz for the cottage chz and half the shredded chz was a colby/pepper jack blend.  but mine came out kind of on the dry side.  maybe some velveeta would help it out some...

this was really good.  I misread the directions and put in too much Parmesan cheese.  but it was even better!  I also made a double batch and made 2 dishes.  I added one cup with fresh spinach to one.  I left the spinach out of the other because the grandchildren don't like spinach.  I liked the spinach one best and the grandchildren did too! A great Friday of Lent meal with hot rolls.

This is a great recipe...when I make it I usually puree the cottage cheese, it makes the cheese sauce smoother.

When I asked her what she wants for dinner, as a joke, my wife said 'Mac and Cheese'. I accepted the challenge, followed the recipe to the letter, except I put whole grain noodles. My wife said that it was better than her mother's.

This is pretty good, didn't have worsterchire sauce so I used a dash of soy sauce instead. Mixed light sour cream, fat free cottage cheese, egg and 2% milk in food processor for a minute or so (to avoid curd like texture)Added more milk, a dash of nutmeg and covered with foil. A 12 oz. package of noodles made tons so I hope this freezes well. I usually freeze traditional mac & cheese. Tasted great.

Love Love Love this. I make it for every holiday by request from the family. It does seem to come out a little dry for me, so I add a few cubes of velveeta and it's delicious. It's even better the second day!

Yummy....I did use elbow noodles instead of the egg noodles.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted with a creamy ranch dip (premade), which has a sour cream base.  Fast, easy to make and my 2 year old loved it.

This is pretty good.I have made it both with and without the cottage cheese and it is good both ways--I think the egg really makes the recipe.Good for a change from my regular "cheese-sauce" style.

I really like this recipe.Have made it both with and without the cottage cheese and it's great both ways.I also use baby shells or rotini. I figured out to cover the dish with a lid or tin foil when my 3 yr old would only eat the "soft parts"-top turned out a little chewy without it!!
Super tasty recipe Kim-Thanks!

Quite good and easy. I had leftover sour cream and cottage cheese in the fridge, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I will definitely make this one again, although I wouldn't say it's my favorite mac and cheese recipe. Don't leave out the Worcestershire sauce! It wouldn't be as good without it. I covered the casserole with foil until the last 15 minutes of cooking time, and then let it brown without the foil. Perfect :)
***UPDATE: I have made this recipe at least 15 times now and have experimented with different cheeses... every casserole has been delicious. (There isn't a thing wrong with the original recipe, I just like to monkey around with casseroles sometimes.) I wrote out this recipe and posted it on my fridge, since I plan to make this one frequently!

This tasted amazing! I didn't have an hour to let it bake, so I spread it a bit thinner a 9x13" dish and baked it at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. That worked fine. I also added added some crumbled bacon to the mix and sprinkled more bacon on top. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was great - had the texture and flavor I like in a mac 'n' cheese! I used 4-5 cups noodles - 2 cups even when cooked didn't seem like nearly enough - and only 1/2 tsp. of the Worcestershire sauce. Next time I'd use 1 cup cheddar/1 cup Gruyere, add a little hot sauce maybe. It was really good as is, though.

This was really good, but doesn't make much. I'd suggest doubling the recipe & also covering in oven to prevent drying out.

I didn't use Parmesan cheese, but added Monterey and sharp cheddar. A lot of homemade Mac n cheese I have had do not seem like they are very cheesy, so I added a ton of cheese!! And it was delicious! I also used mustard instead of  worcestershire sauce.

I'm not sure how many of you have lived in the south east, but there was once a grocery store called Ukrops with the most decadent mac n cheese ever.  I found this recipe in attempt to recreate their mac n cheese after they went out of business.  It's not perfect, but it's close.  I make some changes which I recommend if you are looking a creamier mac n cheese.  The recipe here is a bit dry.  1. double the cottage cheese and sour cream.  2. add more cheese.  For the topping I layed down a bed of cheddar and then added a thin layer of panko breadcrumbs mixed with butter.  Heaven.

I thought this was phenomenal.  The Worcestershire sauce made it taste soooo good.  I did use elbow macaroni instead of egg noodles, but I would not change a thing.  I did not have the amount of cottage cheese and sour cream it asked for, but substituted the remainder with whole milk.

I've been looking for something other than a casserole recipe to make with my extra egg noodles and now I've found it!  Since my husband never likes anything and asked me to make this again sometime, I give it 4 stars.  Next time I might drain the cottage cheese just a bit as it was a little runny, and add a bit more salt.

I modified it a little and was excellent. Used cream cheese instead of cottage cheese, added a little velveeta, also added a can of diced green chilis and a pound of bacon fried and cut and half a sweet onion chopped. Very good. And don't forget to cover it.

I am a huge mac and cheese fan, and also a huge egg noodle fan, but sadly, I thought this recipe was horrible. The flavor was bland and also a little odd tasting, but the worst part was the consistency. I  followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the cottage cheese, yet it was still soggy instead of gooey.  Even with just one egg, it was far too eggy. I will definitely not make this again, and it's bummer because I had such high hopes.

This is awesome.  I made a few changes though.  I didn't have cottage cheese or sour cream so I used french onion dip.  And 2% milk.  I added some hot sauce for flavor also.  Next time I would cover it when baking so the noodles on top aren't too crunchy.

I used corkscrew pasta (why does certain shaped pasta taste better than others?! I'll never figure that out... !). I cooked a little too much of it, so I threw 2/3 can condensed mushroom soup into the cheese mixture. It was very nice and cheesy. Next time I would add some onion and maybe some ham too. A quick and easy recipe. Thanks, kim!

I thought this was just average.  There really wasn't much flavor to it.  The kids liked it, which gives it an extra star.  I though it tasted better the next day reheated.  If I make it again, I will add peas, mushrooms and ham because it reminded me of Zio's Straw and Hay but w/o those ingredients.  I will also add green onions and some mild spices to jazz it up a little.

I didn't find this dish all that cheesy.  The flavor was pretty good, but the cottage cheese gave it an unappetizing appearance.  Next time I will try ricotta instead.

Quite easy and cheesy dish.  I thought it was great but my husband said it was too cheesy, first time I've ever heard that from him.  It was slightly runny, but may have been due to using lowfat cheeses and sour cream.

This was very good. I didn't add the cottage cheese (can't stand the stuff!) and had the Worcestershire sauce out but forgot to add it! It all tasted fine without those things. We liked it very much and I will certainly make it again. My husband loves egg noodles and it was fun to use them in a cheesy way!

Very rich dish! I think I will try it with macaroni or shells next time; I prefer the flavor of egg noodles on their own or in soup. I tried using mustard instead of Worcestershire sauce, like Kim suggested - I used Luzianne's Creole Mustard, and it added a nice kick. One reviewer said that she left out the onions, but I didn't see them in the recipe ...? Also, I goofed up and added all of the shredded Cheddar cheese at once instead of reserving some for the topping, but it came out just fine. Very simple and tasty. Thanks, Kim!

This was fantastic!  My kids (ages 3 & 1) cleaned their plates entirely!  I added 1/4 inch slices of sausage for some meat and used lowfat sour cream and cottage cheese.  I only had an 8 inch square dish, but cooking it 1 hour 10 minutes and letting it set for 5 minutes after worked like a charm!  We'll definitely make this again!

We just didn't like this one. We found it very bland, and just not what we expected. We also were not crazy about the cottage cheese texture in this.  Even my very picky 20 month old who will usually gobble up mac and cheese didn't want this one.  I will keep looking for something better!
