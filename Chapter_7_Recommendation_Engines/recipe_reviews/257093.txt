This is a very good recipe. I love the yogurt and hot sauce mix. I used one whole egg instead of substitute. I also added extra hot sauce. The amounts are quite precise as there was no leftover batter nor bread crumbs. It doesn't specify the temperature. I used a Philips airfryer on 190Â°C. Using thin chicken, the strips only needed eight minutes total. What a delicious meal. Thank you.

I used this recipe to try out the Air fryer in my new Nuwave Oven. I set it on Air fry at 400 F for 15 minutes and it was great.

I made this just as directed & it was delicious!! I used 1 large chicken breast & had to cook it a few more minutes but other than that changed nothing. A favorite for sure.
