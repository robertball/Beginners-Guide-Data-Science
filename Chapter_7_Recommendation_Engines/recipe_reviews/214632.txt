Very good.  The flavor of the wine can really influence the outcome.  I only used cinnamon and cloves.  The wine never did become a syrup, but I poured it over the chilled pears anyway.  Then I froze some for later.  If you prefer softer fruit, simmer for an hour.

This was good.  I used a wine that was made by Hand Craft and it was a Petite Syrah.  Very fruity wine.  I had to boil the wine for a long time to get it to coast the back of a spoon.  By the time it was done my stove was a mess.  We enjoyed the recipe.  Thanks so much for posting.

I have been looking for this recipe! About ten years ago I made a recipe similar to this and it turned out fantastic. serve the hot pears with the cold syrup and some vanilla ice cream. Awesome!

This was incredible! I peeled and halved the pears and took out the stems and cores. Used a whole bottle of cheap red and skipped the peppercorns, fennel and bay leaves. Used 1-1/4 cup of sugar because of the extra wine. Cooked them in the wine about 30 minutes, turning a couple of times to get even color. Took about 30 minutes to reduce the syrup. Put them cold on a plate with the cold syrup and added a dollop of Creme Fraiche on each. Yum! Everyone raved about them.

I made this dessert for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. I omitted the optional elements and pretty much followed the recipe exactly - I didn't have actual cloves, just the dried cloves and used a little over 1/4 of a teaspoon. I reduced the wine sauce and poured over the pears and added a dab of vanilla yogurt on the side. Delish!
