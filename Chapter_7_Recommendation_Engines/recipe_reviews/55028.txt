This is a naughty little shot. You have to trust me. What's even better is using Fireball Whiskey and sour apple Pucker, shaking the shots in your shaker well to get it nice and cold, pouring it and just pounding it back. It dosen't seem dangerous but after two or three, you're on the floor giggling. It's really good.

Nice for a after dinner drink but, nothing really special.  I would cut back a little on the apple schnapps.

Wow! that is good. BUT don't tell all the apples down here that they are in the wrong place!
