If you really enjoy that smokey flavor there are tons of chipotle recipes on the internet. I take a can of chipotles (undrained) and puree it until smooth.  Put it in a small jar and refrigerate. This is called chipotle paste. You can add a teaspoon or so to any recipe to add that smokey taste. I use it in my chicken broth for soups, cook chicken tenders in a mixture of cream cheese and chipotle in my small crockpot, add some to ketchup or your favorite BBQ sauce, make a Denver omelette and add a little before cooking. The possibilities are endless and chipotle paste is a little addictive!

Yum! We really enjoyed this. I agree that the chipotle may be too hot for some, but it was fine for us. You may want to sub part of the chipotle/adobo with smoked paprika to keep the smoky flavor without quite so much "yowza!". Another cool trick for this meatloaf, if youre feeling whiny like I was, is to throw all the ingredients except the meat and oatmeal in the blender, then mix everything together in a stand mixer. No chipotle-onion-meat-hands! Thanks so much for the recipe! (I doubled it - we're getting down with sandwiches tomorrow for lunch!)

This is such a good variation for meatloaf! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I would highly recommend this recipe, and to follow it as-directed! I was skeptical about the oats because I had never used them in meatloaf before (though it may be somewhat common) but I was glad I did; the mixture was really wet, but the loaf came out perfectly.  Maybe add one extra chipotle pepper if you want some heat; I typically like spicier food but the extra would have taken away from it, in my opinion. As I said, a nice twist on meatloaf! I served it with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.

This meatloaf is fabulous!  I usually make meatloaf the way my mom taught me, and this was my first new recipe -- so glad I tried it! I used three chipotle peppers instead of two, and I also added some spinch just to fit in an extra veggie.  Otherwise I followed the ingredients and directions exactly, and I am blown-away.  The spice hits you after your first bite, and it truly is a deep smokey spice.  I brought a slice of leftovers to my friend's house, and both her and her roommate demanded I show them where to find the recipe.  I also think this would be delicious with ground turkey which I may try next time for a slightly healthier alternative.  And if anyone is having a hard time finding the peppers (I sure did!), head for a store with a large Mexican-food section.  I traveled to three stores before finally finding them at Walmart.

Wow this was awesome! The flavor was great. I added about 1/2 cup of milk to my oats and 1 cup shredded cheese. This makes the meat mixture very wet, but very moist in the end. I baked in a muffin tin for 45 min. Cut up in slices and made meatloaf sandwiches with pepperjack cheese! It was great!

I generally change things up here and there for recipes, but made this as stated and it was great! I used 93% lean beef and might go up to 96%. I also used a tangy BBQ sauce versus sweet. For baking it, I lined a baking sheet with foil and put the entire loaf pan on it and happy I did because it did splatter a bit. I also used a meat thermometer and baked to 157 degrees and it raised to 161 when it came out of the oven. Perfect, but took longer than an hour. Definitely let it rest for about 10-15 minutes so that it's not falling apart when you cut into it.  Next time I plan to use a muffin pan so that there's more crunchy stuff along the sides and won't take as long to bake.  Using the leaner meat (93%), I recalculated the calories to be 237 per serving, 9.9 g fat (3.4 sat), 10.4 g carb, 1.2 g fiber, 25.4 g protein.

This is delicious!  The only change I made was to bake on a cookie sheet lined with tinfoil.  I just shaped it into a loaf and added a tad more BBQ sauce(used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar) to the top because we like it saucey.  This came together quickly and has the right amount of spice and heat.  This is definitely a keeper for us.

This is excellent. One warning for those who love heat - you can overdo it. I used most of a can of chilis with the adobe sauce and it was a bit much. The problem is the can I found was a bit larger than I thought it would be. Two chili's is probably perfect for this recipe.

Love the chance to try a new meatloaf!  This one is good.  I like spicy and it was certainly that, would imagine it will be a little hot for future reviewers.  The oats help keep the loaf on the drier side as I like it not too wet.  Looking forward to tomorrow's sandwiches for lunch.  Thanks!

I guess we like a more traditional style meatloaf because this was all heat and not much else, though you could taste some of the cumin. I used celery seed, watered down adobo sauce, breadcrumbs, chicken 'n rib bbq sauce and cleaned the pepper really well. I made only half of the recipe. It was super spicy, even for me and I like some heat! Not something I'll make again though. Thanks for the recipe nonetheless!

Dang delicious meatloaf!!  I used chipotle powder instead, and it was the best meatloaf I believe I have ever had.  Great for lunch the next day too.

Used ground turkey instead of beef(don't eat beef). Also just used 1 T. adobo sauce and 1 chilie as I don't like firey hot. It turned out very flavorful. I will keep in my favorites for a meatloaf recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was great. Nice smoky flavoring with just a bit of heat that slowly builds while eating the meatloaf. Tasted great with garlic mashed potatoes.

This has alot of potential, but I think I messed it up.  I used thawed hamburger out of my freezer and probably mixed the ingredients too much, so mine came out a little dry and tough.  The flavor was fantastic though, a nice change from my usual meatloaf.  The family liked it.  Needs quite a bit more salt too, for our taste.

We really enjoyed this!!  I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory with Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce.  Next time I think I may put this together in the morning, giving the favours time to meld before baking in the evening.  We thought the bbq sauce topping could've been tripled or even quadrupled.

Great meatloaf recipe!  I cooked on a rack, in a foil lined roaster pan.  Topped with 4 half slices of bacon ... Plenty of crisp edges!  Took about 1.5 hours to get to 160 degrees done.  I have a temp guage in my oven and it seems to run a bit cooler than the dial ...

This one is hard to rate, because I didn't like it. I can't eat it - it turns out that I do NOT like chipotle flavored meatloaf. However, my husband LOVES it, better than "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" from this site (which is my personal favorite). He likes it so much that I can't subtract any stars, because if you aren't tied to the idea of a sweet ketchupy meatloaf (guilty as charged) this is a flavorful, tender and good recipe -- IE no changes needed! I recommend you cook this (and all meatloaves) on a grill rack pan. (It's a slotted pan with a drip catching pan beneath it.) Even using 93/7 meat, I am always revolted by the amount of fat that drains out. Just be sure to pack the hand-shaped loaf tightly, if you do that. I forgot to do that this time, and so I can't get mine to photograph decently without doing the recipe a disservice. Thanks for a recipe that my husband REALLY enjoyed!

Very good if you like a smokey/spicy meatloaf. My husband said it was way too spicy but I really liked it. So if you are cooking for someone who doesn't go spicy don't make this meatloaf but if your crowd is into something spicy they will love this. And what a great sandwich it makes the next day, if you have leftovers.

This was very flavorful. I couldn't find canned chipotles and I think that would make a huge difference. I'll have to add more notes when I make it the right way.

I made this as written and thought it was very good (except adjusted quantities for everything for 1-1/4 lbs of ground sirloin). Definitely worth making again.

I didn’t measure the spices just eyeballed. Minced the onion & garlic in the mini food processor and used chipotle sauce that I had on hand. Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I have to tell you it was great. Even my picky eater that don’t like meatloaf, onions and what ever she chooses for the night ask for 3rds.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipie. I made it exactly as stated and it was delicious. The only problem I had was that it didn't hold together as well as I like, but I think that was my error. Maybe I didn't mix well enough.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! We love meatloaf in this family and have some good recipes but this is top dog for sure!  I've printed it and passed it on to lots of people who also rate it high.  I did use bread crumbs because that's what I had in the house.  And I used 5 chiles, because we like spice! Hint: mix the meatloaf with only 1 chili -ground up in the blender. Mix with meatloaf -now take a small sample and cook it in the microwave.  Taste and adjust if need- cook.  That's how we knew we wanted more chilies!  Will try it with oatmeal when I have it in the house. For great presentation, sprinkle shredded cheese on top before serving.

This was really good! I topped it with Big Al's BBQ sauce because I ran out of the bottled sauce. My family loved it! Can't wait to make sandwiches on Texas toast with the leftovers.

Awesome flavors... I'm not sure if it was the red meat (I don't prepare beef very often) or just how GOOD this was, but my boyfriend sure was a fan of dinner tonight! I loosely followed the recipe--which I cut in half--not precisely measuring anything. After shaping into two loaves on a sheet pan, I baked them until they were done (about 45 min). We loved everything about the smokey, not-too-spicy flavor! I wouldn't change a thing about the ingredients in this recipe! Served with Creamy Skillet Corn (from AR) and a spinach salad. Good stuff!

I was the only one who liked this in our family. I might layer the bbq sauce next time. I did go easy on the peppers for fear of the heat and feeding it to my picky children. I like heat so more peppers next time!

Fabulous!  You should definitely give it at try.  I read the reviews and made it early allowing the flavors to meld.  I put in a loaf pan then refrigerated for 4 hours.  Inverted the loaf onto my greased broiling pan then smothered in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce then topped with cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper.  Roasted at 350 until done.  Make a double batch if you want any leftovers :)

Good, I only used 1 pepper, and I thought that was enough.  I used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal.  Will use more next time.

Nothing really new here.  BBQ sauce, spicy and smokey flavors have been mates with meatloaf for a long time.  Still, I really liked this meatloaf a lot.  The reason they have been around a long time is because they work so well.  I used half ground pork and half beef, otherwise kept to the recipe.  Usually I use bread crumbs instead of the oatmeal used here, and I think I like the crumbs better.  Seems the oatmeal makes for a little denser texture.  Probably doesn't make that much difference.

Yummmmm! This meatloaf is awesome. The only changes I made were adding 1/2C skim milk and 1/2C sharp cheddar cheese to the oatmeal, as suggested in another review. I also didn't have celery salt, so I omitted that, and I added one chopped chipotle to the BBQ sauce for the topping. This sauce was only enough for half of the loaf, so I had to double it. Also: I learned to NOT put a cookie sheet under my loaf pan, in case the meatloaf bubbled over. I did so, and I had a nice bright red meatloaf after one hour of cooking. This was completely my fault, but if anyone is considering doing this, DON'T do it! I had to cook for another hour without the sheet there, anyway :/

Finally, a meatloaf with flavor, not spicy at all.  The consistency was good too.  I cut the recipe in half for my hubby & me.  There was plenty for dinner and now I'm eating some leftovers in a sandwich....yummm!

Great smokey flavor but not overpowering.  I love meatloaf and this variation has definitely made it to the top of my list.

This recipe is off the hook, GOOD! A nice little zip too! I love the smokey flavor of the Chiplote peppers and adobo. I used Kraft Hickory BBQ Sauce and gave it more smokey flavor. THEN>>>Grilled the leftovers on the grill with applewood chips! OMG!!! Unbelieveable!

I made one change to the recipe.  I accidentally bought a can of chipotle salsa in a can.  I thought, when I bought it in the mexican section, it was the chipotle chiles in adobo sauce.  The two cans are very similar.  Anyway, I went ahead and used about 3 T. of it.  I found it not to be spicy at all, which is odd considering all the ingredients in there.  Maybe next time using the right chipotle ingredient, it will kick it up a notch.  Also, I guess my meat wasn't lean enough, because it was really greasy.  Next time, I will bake it on a wire rack with a pan underneath to catch the excess grease.  I also would put more bbq sauce on top.  All in all, it was ok.  Not smoky enough or spicy enough for what I was expecting.

Me and my husband asbsolutely loved this! Was'nt sure how it would turn out but surprisingly enough the flavors are delish. The only thing I changed was the bbq sauce, I could;nt find just reg hicory so I used hicory & brown sugar and I upped the 2 tbsp on top to around 3 or more to get the loaf nice and covered. I don't like food to be to spicey and the 2 chilis was perfect. I did scrape out a majority of the seeds and the heat was spicey but not overpowering. I def. recommend this recipe. Will make again here real soon. :)

This is one kicking good meatloaf!  I'm a wimp, so I left out the extra adobo sauce, and it had just enough kick for us.  Definitely a make again.

Thank you, thank you for posting this!  It may be the best meatloaf I've ever eaten.  Everyone loved it.  I used the suggested 2 chipotles and think it could have even used another 1/2 or more.  That might have made it too hot for some but we didn't think it hot at all;  just a bit of a kick.  The only changes I made were to size it up for 5 pounds of ground meat and add about a teaspoon of Maggi seasoning since I thought I was out of Worcestershire sauce.  When I found a new bottle in the pantry, I added that too.  Really delightful meal; I will make this often - in fact, it will probably become my "go to" meatloaf.  I used Budweiser Smokey BBQ sauce and next time might use Bulls Eye, maybe Bulls Eye Chipotle.  I will also add a bit more sauce on top than 2 tablespoons.

This was very good!  We are not usually meatloafers but I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and gave it try.  I did not use a loaf pan but formed a loaf on a foil lined pan.  Worked great!  It even sat in the oven an extra hour covered with foil (with the oven off) waiting for the DH to get home.  Still hot and yummy!  Really good flavor.  Lots of kick.  Served it with some cheesy rice.  Can't wait to try it with elk meat.

This was very moist and flavorful.  I didnt have celelry salt, so I substituted seasoned salt and added a couple tablespoons of milk to the egg mixture.  It was not too spicy, in fact I was anticipating it to be more spicy than it was.  The mild smokey flavor was just right.  For those who like a bit more spice, I would reccomend adding an extra chipotle.  I cant wait for the leftovers tonight!

I made this and let it cook all day in the crockpot. When I came home to make the side dishes, my family had already made a side dish and fresh salad. I had the two ends of meatloaf - becaust that was all that was left. Best recipe EVER!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot, but definitely didn't come out stiff enough for sandwiches.  I suspect the bbq sauce may not have been as thick as some other brands and was suspect of only 1/2c of oatmeal.  I will increase this next time for a stiffer meatloaf.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe!  I like spicy food and this tasted mildly spicy to me.  The one change I made was to puree all the ingredients from the eggs to the onion in my food processor.  The meatloaf came out moist and uniformly flavorful.  We had this with the Home-style Macaroni and Cheese recipe from this site and a fresh green salad.  It was a win!

I would have to say this is the best meatloaf receipt I have made, I made it with half pork n beef, great hit!   I also made my own BBQ Sauce from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/30491/nanas-barbeque-sauce/, less the allspice.  I changed up the BBQ sauce a bit but this base is very good, used molasses instead of sugar..

I exchanged one dried chipotle hatch chili for one of the chipotle chilies in adobo sauce.  Also, I only had celery seed on hand so I exchanged it for the celery salt.  It smelled and tasted delicious!  A moist meatloaf with a smoky, spicy sweetness.   Will make this again for certain.

I followed recipe as written. I think the flavor was very good but not for a meatloaf. I will take the recipe and make hamburgers and grill them topping with swiss or provolone cheese next time.

This is a good recipe, and easily adaptable, but I'm still searching for one that's spectacular. (I do like the idea of using health oats instead of breadcrumbs.)

This is really tasty! One of the best recipes I have found other than what I grew up with mom making (the Quaker Recipe)… I cut the recipe in half but used 1.25 package of ground turkey. It was really yummy! I definitely think the hubby will love it when he gets home, he loves spicy things.

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made and it was just what I was looking for! My hubby even ate it and went back for seconds and he has refused to eat meatloaf for probably 20 years ever since his mom made him eat it cold one time. 
After reading some reviews I was afraid it might be too spicy for my 2 & 4 year old, so I used 1 chili pepper and 1 tablespoon of the adobo sauce and cut the black pepper back to 1/2 tsp--I actually didn't think it was spicy at all this way. Next time, I will use the whole amount. 
Can't wait to see if it's better the next day!

Really good, but a little too spicy for my 2-1/2 year old.  We tried serving it with Ranch dressing for him, but still a no go.  (It was better without the ranch anyway. That just left more for my husband and I to enjoy.)

Fantastic Flavor! My guys love spicy, hot food so adding the chipotle peppers with the addition of the smokey BBQ sauce made an absolutely delicious dish. Only one problem - one meatloaf was simply not enough, as everyone was moaning about no seconds or leftovers :)

Had a hard time finding adobo sauce but luckily 1 store in my neighborhood had it. For a different twist on meatloaf this was really interesting and definitely worth trying out. Thank you for sharing, my family really enjoyed it!

We loved these, but would have used a bit more chipotle since we like things a bit spicier. We only used one for half the recipe, and couldn't taste the heat at all.

We loved it.  I made it w/ some Zucchini and less meat.  Be careful with the Chippolte  Chili as it can be a bit on the spicy side.

This is a very tasty meatloaf recipe.  I followed exactly, using 2 Seeded chipotle chiles. It is a stand-out from your standard versions.  The next day sandwiches are the best.  I again followed the cook's recommendations, heated sliced meatloaf, served with onion and Swiss cheese, x-tra BBQ sauce on a toasted bun.  YUM!   This goes into the file..

Excellent dish and it is quick and easy to make.  I made the meatloaf just like the recipe and it turned out great.  In the past, my family always drowned any meatloaf with ketchup, but this has enough flavor that it doesn't need anything else and loved it.  Our old recipe is out and this one is in...  Thanks

I just made this meatloaf, and I loved it!!!  I even had seconds, and I usually don't!!!!  I made the adobo paste to use in other dishes.  I will definately make this again.  I hope it's not too hot for my husband.

As always, I made this recipe as directed. My wife says it is the best meatloaf she has ever had. This came out tender, juicy, and full of flavor. I highly recomend giving this a try as is. The only reason for not giving five stars is that "Mom's" meatloaf is a family favorite of many. With that in mind, I am certain that tweaking here or there can lead to more outstanding flavor. Give this a try and enjoy.

I thought my recipe for meatloaf was good but this one blew it out of the water. I am not a big fan of ketchup so this barbcue sauce was key. I added one more chipotle pepper and instead of oatmeal I used crackers. Goodbye to my old recipe. Good job!

Wow this meatloaf is kick butt!  Best I've ever made!  Great flavor combination.  I did not include the peppers, b/c I have small kids.  Just used the adobo juice, and it was just enough spice.  I also used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal.  I cooked it on a wire rack inside a cookie sheet.  It smelled wonderful while cooking & tasted even better.

This recipe gets ten stars from us.   I cut the recipe in half, and overcooked it.  The thermometer read 188 degrees, and the meatloaf was still moist, flavorful, ultra spicy and delicious.  Just had another slice for dessert. Thank you Jean for a great recipe that takes very little time for prep.

This is Great I made a paste of chipotle adobe peppers and ketchup put on top after it’s done. Depending on heat desired you can use more or less chipotle peppers.

I dropped out some of the spicier spices and used a hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce. The texture was a bit too wet for my liking, but the flavour was fantastic!

It turned out well.  I added a bit more adobe sauce and mixed it well.  Also mixed a tablespoon of adobe sauce into the BBQ sauce topping.  I put the meatloaf into three small foil loaf pans.  One of which I baked, the others are frozen.

I made it with chipotle powder and added some red bell peppers. Very nice flavor. Will make again and try to have the chipotle peppers on hand.

Delicious! My only changes were using store bought Pico (1 c) in place of onion, replace oatmeal with 1 c corn chips and 1/2 c milk. Loved it, not to spicy!

I love it! I did make a few changes such as adding a couple stalks of celery (instead of the celery salt) and some carrots while cutting the onion to half. I also like my meatloaf a bit moist so added unsweetened unflavored almond milk to give it that oomph! Also, to cut the sugar (since most hickory BBQ's have at least 15g of sugar per two tablespoons!) I used a regular 4g of sugar for the loaf and added the hickory BBQ to glaze. I think next time I will do 3 peppers instead of 4 but overall it came out delicious!

SO delicious! I was craving my mom's meatloaf, but decided to look up a recipe when I couldn't get my hands on her's. I'm so glad I did. I'm a huge fan of heat, so this recipe really excited me. I also added jalepenos and habeneros. It was incredibly flavorful, but definitely not for the heat-sensitive. When I heated it up at work, people could smell the heat and it's deliciousness.

Tasty! I decided it needed a little more spice, so I added more peppers on top as a garnish and used chipotle barbecue sauce to make it more flavorful.

This was fantastic and my husband loved it!  I juat added about 15 minutes to the suggested cook time and it was done.  The flavor from the chipoltes really sets if off.  We also used a meatloaf pan with a drain tray which is awesome, grease free.  Delish!

Best meatloaf I've had. Used  ground chipotle peppers because I keep them on hand in the freezer, in ice cube trays. Made it in advance and froze it. Easy to pop in oven with some potatoes for a no fuss weekday meal.

Family loved it. Here are my change:  no adobo spice or celery salt around so added 1 tsp mustard powder, 1 tsp garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic, and 1Tbs brown sugar.  Mixed all ingredients then put in a casserole dish and topped loaf with approx 1Tbs BBQ sauce. I work evenings so cooked the loaf in my slow cooker by putting water in the bottom of the cooker then placing the casserole dish inside. Set for 3hours on low then on warm setting til hubby and toddler got home. Hubby broiled the loaf to crispen the top. Yummy! But why, oh why, did I agree that my husband could have the leftovers?!

I've made this at least a dozen times exactly as written because my husband and I both love it. Also made it for a potluck and had rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The only change I've ever made is to add some chopped bell pepper, which was also excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

My wife, who's the real cook in the family, called this the best meatloaf she's ever had. And that's from someone who's made meatloaf more times than I can count. Great flavor, just enough smoke & heat without being too spicy. Maybe add a >pinch

This was delicious and spicy. I did substitute 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of oatmeal and it was a little bit too moist, so next time I would use 1 1/2 or 2 cups of bread crumbs.

Made this tonight since i just bought some ground beef. Our house loves meatloaf and have made several different types. This one is definitely a "do over".  I have only one complaint though. There are not enough leftovers for tomorrow !

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it had a great smokey, yet slightly spicy taste. I made it with low fat grass fed beef, and was very pleased with how it turned out.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband's favorite meal is meatloaf. Prior to trying this recipe, he said I made the best meatloaf he had ever eaten. Once I made this version, he wanted chipotle meatloaf every time! Thanks for a great recipe, we use it often.

This was a nice change from traditional meatloaf.  When making it again, I would only use half an onion.  I found the whole onion to be too overwhelming the next day when I heated again.

I'm not a meatloaf person but had some hamburger to use so tried this out.  WOW!  So glad I did.  Perfect for my family's love of spice!  I may try and make these into meatballs to freeze to add a little zing to spaghetti in the future.

I will definitely make this again. Delicious flavour and very moist. Tastes just as good ( or better) the next day. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn.

Really, really tasty dish. Followed recipe exactly except used 3 adobos and added some cheddar cheese to mixture. I also cooked in muffin tins instead of as loaf (cooks faster...probably 30 minutes). We also wanted it a little browned on top and so finished it under broiler for a few minutes. My husband said it is his new favorite dish I make.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe that I have found, although I do make some changes. 
I add 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke

Reduce or removed the chipotle chillies with the adobe sauce. I personally like the heat, but for my audience its too much. I may add onion or a mild fresh pepper instead. 

I add more barbecue sauce to the top, I double it and I want it gooey on top. 

I also mix in some corn meal when I mix the meat.

Awesome recipe. Not much of a meatloaf lover, but ADORE spice. I used very lean beef mince and served with a Naga chili jam gravy. Totally delicious, juicy, very spicy and just plain great. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really LOVED this recipe.  It makes a super moist, flavorful and spicy meatloaf.  I followed the recipe exactly.  What I love is the zip and smoky flavor the chipotles give this meatloaf.  I used two small chipotles from the can and I could taste the spice.  If you're meek with spice I would go easy on the chipotles maybe only use 1 chili.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  This is one of the better ones on AR.

Loved it! Didn't have celery salt, but it didn't lack for flavor without it! Served slices warm with cheddar on homemade bread...heavenly!!! My husband doesn't like "hot" as much as I do, so I cut the chiptle amount in half andwe both loved it. Also loved the other reviewers suggestion to make chiptole paste out of remaining can of peppers in adobo. Wonderful tip!

Loved this recipie.   Used plain breadcrumbs instead of oatmeal.  Cut half amount of black pepper - add more if needed > Used blender to mix everything except meat and breadcrumbs - quick and easy.   Left overs were gone the next day, nice change from regular meatloaf.

Nice and juicy with very good flavor.  I added an extra pepper and it still wasn't spicy enough for me, though!  Worked well with ground turkey.

Really enjoyed this.  I think we cooked it a little long so it kind of dried out but that was probably due to our quirky electric oven.  Either way, an hour may be a little too long for one meatloaf.

I swear, I never make meat loaf the same way twice.  I found this recipe a few days ago, and knew I had to try it soon, as I have never used chipotle peppers and adobe sauce before.  This was a very moist loaf, with a little bit of a bite.  Can't wait for the leftovers on sandwiches today.  Thanks for the recipe serenebeader!!

Excellent!! I made this for my Sunday family dinner and everyone loved it! We used 3 pounds of ground meat (1lb. turkey, 1lb. beef, 1lb pork) but didn't adjust any of the seasonings.  The meatloaf was so moist had so much flavor no condiments were necessary!  I will DEFINTELY make this again.  Thanks for sharing!!

The flavor was great.  Pretty spicey though.  I think next time we'll go with one Chipolte, not 2.  Plus, the Chipotle was hard to find.  I had to hit a Latino store for this one.

Holy hot meatloaf!!!! I made the recipe exactly as the directions stated.... I loved this meatloaf although it was a little bit too hot! It had a great texture, it smelled fabulous, and it was the best meatloaf I had made in years.... Just tone down the chipotle if you don't like spice or if you have little ones and it will be perfect! Thanks!

My husband and I liked it but our kids didn't. It was a little spicy.

This was great, very tasty. I was iffy about the oats, but the meatloaf has a good texture. We added extra chilies and it was very spicy. Next time I'll make it as directed.

Delicious. I fixed like the recipe as is but cut the Chipotle Chilli in half as my wife doesn't like real spicey and it was just right.

Very good variation on meatloaf.  I agree with some of the others that like a little more "kick", add that extra chipotle!  Great flavors!

Where do I start?  As a vegetarian that often cooks meat dishes for others, it is really hard to try new things.  Being unable to 'taste test' dishes leaves an element of surprise to those that are eating what I cook.  I double the recipe, but silly me I forgot to purchase double the ground beef and an extra can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  I ended up adding bread crumbs due to the grocery cart error.  Very minimal preparation in this dish which was nice, because I was making stuffed chicken breast at the same time!  At any rate, my wonderful man stated that it was the best meatloaf that he has ever had!!  So, I guess being a vegetarian I didn't do too bad making my first meatloaf!!!  Thanks for the recipe!  I am sure that this will be something that I make often!!
