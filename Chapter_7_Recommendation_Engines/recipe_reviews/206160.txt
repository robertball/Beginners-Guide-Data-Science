Interesting flavor to this salad.  The next time I make it I'm going to mix the lemon juice, olive oil and sour cream together before adding to the lettuce mixture.  My husband doesn't care for sour cream and wondered what the "white stuff" was.  I told him it was yogurt!  I think mixing the 3 ingredients together first will help tame the sour cream.  I really enjoyed this.  Thanks Gianna for sharing.

This was SO FRESH and delicious! I fallowed this recipe to the tee and it was perfect, I served this for our Sunday family dinner and it was all gone with my kids asking to me more.  I love the idea of sour cream as the creamy dressing rather then the same old typical ranch...etc this is definitely making it to our weekly menu.  thank you!

A different taste from the same old Ranch but I really enjoyed it. Next time, I think I will leave out the onions and just put some on husband's salad. Served with cabbage soup, "Russian Dipping Sauce," "Traditional Russian Pirozhki," "Instant Russian Tea," and "Russian Tea Cakes III."

I made this as part of a Russian themed dinner.  Very good side to a hearty entree.  I reduced the onion, salt and sour cream quite a bit.  It was very good.

Good reviews from the foodies at Easter dinner.  Next time, I'll cut the salt in half.

I cut the salt completely, and allowed guests to "salt-to-taste".   I also Put the dressing in a bowl, so  the guests could spoon over the dressing.  Which eliminates lettuce wilting. Everyone loved the salad:-)
A bit too much parsley for my taste.  Next time I will  half the parsley:-). I will definitely make this salad again! Thanks for sharing Gianna!

This was a great salad. I served it for Christmas dinner and my brothers LOVED it. Next time, I will take care not to dress the salad to long before it is served because it went a little limp.

This looks good and I plan to try it.  However, it seems that one ingredient (which I see so often in Russian vegetables and salads) is missing.  What is it?  The radish, of course.  I love red radishes and it seems that adding it to this salad would make it feel even more Russian.  Just a suggestion.

This was super easy to make and everyone loved the flavor of the dressing.  I mixed the sour cream with the lemon juice and olive oil and chilled it until ready to serve.  I then tossed it with the salad immediately before serving and it created a very smooth dressing.  I was concerned it would be too "lemony" tasting but once it mixed in with all the salad ingredients it was just right.

Cut the salt and sour cream as it was too much for my salad. Still seemed too salty. And the lettuce went limp. The salt sucked out the moisture.
