I just made this dish and it is going in the garbage.  The mixture does not taste good at all. Waste of time and money on the ingredients. We are going out to dinner now.

This was the second time I made this recipe. I've found that my toddlers won't go for it, and that it doesn't work well in my house as leftovers. As long as you're feeding a large crowd, it'd be good.

I've made this MANY times adding the rotel tomatos AND I add one large chopped vidalia onioned that I glazed first, its wonderful. I also shred the chicken breast to make it easier to spread even in the pan. Frito's work well if you don't like tortilla chips, I've used both in the past and everyone still likes it.

I only used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of chicken, added the rotel, 3 chicken breast, 3 cups of shredded cheese. Delicious recipe just needs tweaked for individual taste.

I couldn't find the nacho cheese soup so I used cheddar cheese soup and added a taco seasoning pouch to it I also shredd the chicken and crushed up the remaining chips for the top and added shredded taco cheese to the top in the last 5 or so mins of the bake

This turned out pretty well for us. I added a can of rotel and let out the chili powder. I also put a layer of cheddar over the top.

This recipe was easy to make.  I cubed the chicken and covered the dish in aluminum foil before baking.  It was very good!

I was not a fan of this. I don't mean to be rude at ALL but it felt like it was just artery clogging and gross.    I took this recipe and added rice, halved soups n cheeses (i used a can of nacho cheese only actually) and added tons of veggies. Cut up carrots, broccoli, onion, celery, and then baked it. it was great!

This would be a good dip type dish w/cubed chicken or casserole.  It's not "Mexican-style" either it's Tex-Mex

This was absolutely wonderful!  My husband had some at a party and asked me to make it for him.  This was my first time making it.  I did a couple of things different.  After I cut up the chicken into small pieces, I seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.  I didn't use any nacho cheese.  I just cut up velveeta and mixed that with everything else.  I also used Spicy Doritos.  Just yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

The taste wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the calories and fat the recipe includes!

Sorry for those who actually liked this recipe.  It was too processed and loaded with preservatives, you could almost taste them.  It was not to our liking!  Won't be making it again.

I have made this for years,,except in mine I use a can of rotel tomatoes with green chilis,cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, 1 sweet yellow onion course cut in chunks, a pound of velvetta cheese cubed, a teaspoon of chili powder, a teaspoon of garlic powder( to taste)(no nacho soup) and a cup of chicken broth that the chick was cooked in.

I have made this with my family before and we love it! Though we made a few changes by adding a can of diced tomatoes and chiles and we mixed the chips into the whole mix before baking it. Loved to use the spicy nacho cheese chips because it gave it a bit more spice!
