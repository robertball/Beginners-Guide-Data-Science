One of the best drinks I've had in a long time. I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka in this drink. I actually mixed the ingredients up and poured the whole thing in a large glass. GREAT cocktail.

Just ok for me.  not sure if it was too much of one thing or not enough of another or what, but I will probably try a different recipe next time.

So good.  I increased the servings to 12 and put all of the ingredients into a glass pitcher for a party - all of the ladies had a cosmo.  Very swanky.

This is so good!  A wonderful summer time drink.  I made it as is for a  party and loved it. Then to go to a picnic I made it into more of a punch.  I used absolute citron vodka and kept the liquor ounces the same but doubled the cranberry to 12 oz and adding 6oz of Simply Limeade eliminated the lemon and lime juice and serving with fresh lime wedges in regular glasses over ice.  Everyone loved it, it was light and refreshing.

Yummy. My wife and I both enjoyed this mixture. I played with the proportions a bit, but none were any better than presented here. Will definitely have these again.

I'm fairly certain that I made this right and if I did, it was soo liquory. It tasted good, though, over ice. I added some watermelon schnapps to my glass and it was delicious.

This was delicious! Perfect balance of all the flavors. Very pretty color, looks great garnished with a slice of star fruit.

I tried this cocktail recipe at a family gathering and it was a hit! I am a sucker for a good cosmo, so that extra peach flavor from the schnapps really brought  another dimension to the drink. Thanks for sharing.
