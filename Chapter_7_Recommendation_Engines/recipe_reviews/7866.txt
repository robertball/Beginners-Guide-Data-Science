I make cheesecake all the time and this, topped with maple pecan glaze from another recipe, was voted the best ever by my friends.  A nice change of pace for fall, or anytime really.  The glaze: Simmer 1 cup whipping cream with 3/4 cup real maple syrup for about 20 min; stir in 1/2 cup chopped pecans and chill.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and made sure the cream cheese and eggs were at room tempature.  I made the cheesecake 2 days ahead and it was perfect.  I cooked it with a 9x13 pan of water under the cake to prevent cracks.  I put pecans on the top edge like the picture and made the pecan glaze as suggested with 1 cup whipping cream, 3/4 cup maple syrup (I used imitation).  I didn't add the glaze until right before serving.  I omited the vanilla and lemon extracts and the flavor was perfect.  I entered the cheesecake into a pumpkin festival baking contest and it won the grand overall prize.  The cake is awesome!!

Even though I felt the ingredients list was overwhelming when I first found this recipe, I would now swear it's well worth it.  Pumpkin pie fans and non-fans enjoyed this creation and I can't wait to bring it home for Thanksgiving this year.  The crust is extra-fancy tasting with the pecans.  You can taste the highly recognizbale cheesecake flavor and harmonious blend of pie spices with each bite.  The extra effort pays off in the end.  I cooked mine in a water bath, cracked the oven door open after turning off the stove, and chilled over night.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Every year my husband and I always try a new pumpkin cheesecake recipe. My husband said "the search is over, this is THE ONE!" and I have to agree. The pecans in the crust were wonderful. There wasn't anything about this recipe that wasn't perfect. I did add nutmeg to mine instead of the mace but I doubt that changed the flavor too much. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

7/20/12-we tried this one again and it was a winner!!!

Excellent Cheesecake!!  Very creamy with just a hint of pumpkin pie flavor.  Perfect combination.  I plan on serving it this Thanksgiving.  

The only change I made was to add the sour cream topping that was in the "Libby's Pumpkin Cheesecake" recipe.  The topping consists of: 16oz sour cream, 1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract mixed together in small bowl. Spread over surface of warm cheesecake. Bake for 5 additional minutes.

Great light flavor!  I used this recipe to make mini cheescakes with 1/2 tsp of crushed ginger snaps in the bottom of mini cupcake liners.  Turned out great with 15 minutes bake time!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year at my in-laws, and they absolutely loved it. I thought it was really good too. Although I was skeptical about pumpkin cheesecake, the pumpkin flavor is not overpowering. I made one with graham cracker crust and the other with ginger snaps and the ginger snap was much better. I also suggest doing 1.5X the crust recipe. It makes the perfect amount.

This recipe is a staple in my fall desserts!  It really is good.  For those worried about doing a water bath, you really don't need to.  The cornstarch in this recipe actually helps the cake from cracking,  so don't skip it!  For me, I take a small oven safe bowl and put water in it and place it on a lower rack in the oven.  That is to put some moisture in the oven.  After 50 minutes or so, I just turn off the oven and leave the cake in it.  As the oven cools, so does the cake.  Leave it in the oven for about another hour, then I take out the cake.  I run a knife around the edge to make sure that none is sticking to the sides (prevent cracking as the cake cools and shrinks).  Only after the cake is completely cooled, then cover it with foil (in the pan!) and place in the refrigerator.  You should make this a full day ahead of serving (if not longer).  The cake is fantastic and you will have people begging for the recipe!!

This was a very easy cheesecake that baked up perfectly. I substituted two TBS of pumpkin spice for all of the other spices. Was very dense and luscious, everyone loved it.

I got RAVE reviews for this recipe with my in-laws at Thanksgiving. I made it twice, once dry and once in a water bath, the dry made a more NY style texture, the waterbath made it really creamy, so it's all preference. I also used a gingersnap crust from another recipe and it worked really well. I never use graham crackers in cheesecake crusts, they seem too boring. This cheescake was the first dessert gone at Thanksgiving!

It came out incredible. Here are my changes based on other's suggestions and my own research:
-Trade graham cracker crumbs for ginger snaps. Put the snaps in a ziplock bag and hammer them until you have crumbs.  Next time, I will double the amount of the crust and run it up the sides too.
- I doubled allspice instead of mace and ginger.
-I skipped the lemon extract in favor of double vanilla
- Despite what the recipe says, add eggs last and don’t mix it too much. The eggs cause the cheesecake to rise, which may cause cracks if there’s too much air in the batter.
-Bake for 50 minutes @ 350.  To avoid cracks, don’t open the oven for at least the first 30 minutes. 
--Be sure to use a springform pan (bed bed and beyond) and make a water bath (prevent the cheesecake from cracking).  Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with aluminum foil.  Drop it into a larger oven-safe pan or brownie pan that will let you have at least 2 inches of water in it. Boil the water and pour it into the larger pan and cook the whole thing in the oven.
-After 50 minutes have ended, turn off the oven, open the oven door and let the cheesecake sit there for an hour. Then take it out of its bath (don’t remove the foil) and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, remove foil and sides of the springform pan.

This was awesome!  The only thing I changed in the actual recipe was to use nutmeg and cloves in place of the mace.  I added a whipped cream frosting (4oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/16 t. salt, 1/2 t. vanilla- beat together until smooth and fold into 3/4 heavy cream that's been whipped until stiff peaks formed.) to the top and drizzled on the maple syrup glaze (without pecans).  So yummy!!!

I had trouble finding ground mace, so I used slightly less than 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, instead (same family I'm told!).  It was great. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. We loved it.  It did seem to taste better after a couple of days when the spices and flavors mingled!

This was an awesome cheesecake recipe and the perfect dessert for Thanksgiving.  It was a great substitution for the pumpkin pie.  You can definately taste the pumpkin but it was a perfect blend with the cheesecake.  I will definately keep this on the holiday list of things to make.

This was my first cheesecake attempt and was overwhelmed with the success!  I did however make one substitution - I used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers!  

Even my mother [who incidentally makes the best cheesecake in the world] said that this recipe rivalled hers!!  Kudos to the author.

This was my first time making cheesecake. Although it was a lot of work, it was so incredibly worth it!!  It is so creamy and the crust got rave reviews.  I put a layer of ground pecans on the bottom before pouring in the batter, it added wonderful flavor.  Every bite is wonderful, thank you!!

This was wonderful....the family enjoyed every bite...I did however, double the wonderful crust portion for a thicker base. The recipe was clear and logical. Thank you for a wonderful treat, I will use it again...by the way can you add more pumpkin in the recipe?...

I also loved this!  The ground pecans in the crust were a nice change to the plain graham cracker crust that you find with most cheesecakes.  Also, it baked up higher than other cheesecakes, which made for ample slices.  Thanks!!

I made this for our Christmas dessert, and it was the BEST pumpkin cheesecake I've ever eaten.  I made the crust without the pecans, but it was still great.  Next time, will make the crust with ginger snaps.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderfully delicious cheesecake! I ended up making this instead of the standard pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. This is only the 2nd time I have ever made cheesecake and it turned out perfect. I did make some changes by using a gingersnap crust like others from a different recipe on the site (I would recommend half the butter for that crust recipe than what it calls for, the butter oozed out of the pan because there is too much in the original recipe) I also used 1/4 teaspoon of both nutmeg and clove instead of mace and left out the lemon extract and doubled the vanilla. I wrapped the sides of the springform pan with foil and cooked it in a water bath and then turned off the oven at 50 mins and let it cool inside. It was perfectly even, no sinking, no cracks! When it was room temp, I let it set up in the fridge overnight. I recommend before putting in the crust that you cut out a circular liner for the bottom of the pan with parchment paper for easy removal later on (Do not use wax paper! it will melt)  I also made a cinnamon whip cream to top it (1 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon, 1/4 powder sugar)

I cook, but am not "a cook." This cheesecake made me look like my talents are much greater than they actually are. This is an amazing recipe that is now a staple at our Thanksgiving and Christmas table. I have made it for friends and family. Everyone loves it. It is so rich that a little goes a very long way, but light enough not to give you that queasy feeling after a hefty serving. There are a lot of ingredients, but it is well worth the extra effort. If you are looking for this type of recipe, try this one first.

Turned out great!! Definately bake in a water bath it kept my cheesecake from cracking. I also turned off the oven after 50 minutes and left in the oven for an hour to make sure it set and baked all the way thru. The only thing I added or changed was I made a carmel glaze to put on top and then put the whole and crushed pecans on top (like pictured). Carmel glaze was made from 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.

I made this cheesecake 2 days ago and didn't change a thing and I'm glad I didn't. Delicious! After filling the pan with the mixture I dropped it on the counter about 5 times to get any air bubbles out. Afterwards I took a knife and swirled it around in the mixture and dropped it again. I placed 2 heavy duty sheets of foil under and up the side of the cheesecake pan and placed it in a 12" cake pan of HOT water. Baked for 1 hr. and turned off the stove but left it inside with the door closed for about 3 hrs. to cool slowly. After pulling it out I left it on the counter for 1 hr. At this point the cake should have pulled away from the side of the pan. This cheescake was picture perfect!! No cracks or air bubble bumps. I Covered it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge. Now here's the hard part.... I left it in the fridge over night.. This is hands down the best pumpkin cheesecake I've ever made. Don't let the ingredient list scare you, it's a very easy recipe to follow.

This is a terrific cheesecake, it garners rave reviews.  Several people have asked for the recipe, and my family requested we have it for Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie.  I did make some slight changes: I split the 3/4 c. white sugar into 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. dark brown sugar, and reduced the mace and ginger to just a pinch.  I also added a topping by mixing together about 1 c. chopped pecans, 2/3 c. dark brown sugar, and 3 Tbsp. melted butter, then sprinkled on the cheesecake the last 10 minutes of baking.  The texture is fabulous, not too dense.  It has a very nice presentation as well.  I will definitely make this again.

I made 4 desserts for Thanksgiving, and this one came away the winner.  I will double the crust recipe the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!  I wanted to do a gingersnap crust, but the weird store near my house didn't have any and I was in a hurry, so I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crumbs and mixed with ground ginger.  I also skipped the mace because I didn't have it and added nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon.  I could not stop eating this and DH and sister loved it, too.  A definite keeper!
EDIT: I tried this again and still cannot keep it from cracking (tried water bath, cooling it in the oven, cooking on a lower temp), BUT I found the nut topping below on another site and now my cheescake is gorgeous!
Nut Topping:
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter 
1/4 cup whipping cream
1 cup chopped toasted pecans
In a small heavy saucepan over low heat, combine brown sugar and butter; stir until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil; remove from heat and mix in whipping cream and pecans. Pour hot topping over baked cheesecake.

This reactions this cheesecake got at a company Thanksgiving potluck were almost embarrassing. I just read another review and had to chuckle - "Liz" did the same thing I did ... added the maple glaze from another recipe here (the Maple Pumpkin Cheesecake by Eagle Brand, I think). When I was looking at recipes and trying to decide between the two, it just seemed like the way to go, and reactions validated that choice!    Very simple recipe, give it a try!

This was an awsome recipe!!! Everyone loves it, as do I. I did make a few changes: Use 1 pkg 14oz of ginger snaps and 1/2 cup melted butter for crust with same as called for sugar.
Use allspice instead of mace, 1/4 tsp extra ginger and cin.
No lemon extract, but 1 whole tsp vanilla. Full cup of pumpkin. Cook with two small bowls of water in the oven with it.
Top with 
1/2 Block Cream Cheese
1/3 Cup powder sugar
1 tsp Vanilla
1-2 tsp cin (beat until fluffy and then beat in: 1 container fat free cool whip
refrigerate and serve drizzled with hot butterscotch carmel sauce. Yummy! Way better than Olive Gardens!

This was amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. The only changes I made were to use neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (1/3 less fat!), nutmeg instead of mace, reduced sugar in filling by about 1/6 c., increased pumpkin from 3/4 c. to 1 c., omitted the lemon extract, and added about 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I also attempted to bake it in a water bath, but even after wrapping the pan in foil, some water seeped through and made the crust soggy. I was devastated, but luckily, after refrigerating it overnight, it was PERFECT! The crust was just a little soggy, but definitely not enough to ruin the cake. It was just the right balance between dense and light. The pecans in the crust were delicious as well. I will definitely make this again (though perhaps not with the water bath next time!)

This recipe was excellent. I used nutmeg instead of mace recommended by another reviewer. I made this for a work christmas party. Everyone thought I had bought it because it was so good and pretty. By the time I left 3 people had asked me for the recipe. The recipe did have a few ingredients but it wasn't hard at all to make and was well worth it. I also topped it with heavy whipping cream and drizzled caramel over the top which made it even better.

This is by far my family's favorite cheesecake recipe.  To avoid cracks on the top, I turn the oven off after 50 minute baking time.  (Leave cheesecake in oven.)  5 minutes later, I pop open the oven door a little bit and allow the cheesecake to cool inside the oven until the pan is cool enough to touch. I then transfer to a wire rack and allow it to cool completely.  Be sure to refrigerate overnight too.  This cheesecake is worth all the work and time.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good cheesecake however, even with the water bath and extra hour in the oven with it turned off, my cheesecake still cracked.  I even cooked it for the least amount of time (50 min). I think next time I will lower the temp to 325.  I am glad I baked a "test" cheesecake before serving this on Thanksgiving.

VERY VERY good!  Really easy to make.  If you like ginger snaps then definitely do a ginger snap and toasted pecan crust and double the recipe!  Served with whipped cream and a caramel sauce (just 1/4 water, 1 cup sugar, bring a boil and let it reach a golden color, slowly add 2/3 of a cup of warm whipped cream, and whisk- let cool and store covered in fridge).  Will make again and again and again!

Great for inspiration!! This is a pretty good recipe, and baked with the traditional cheesecake method- a water bath, then left in the turned of oven for an hour- it had a perfectly smooth top with NO CRACKS. I agree with the reviewer who said not to add the eggs until the end- overbeaten eggs will cause a cheesecake to rise and fall in the oven, increasing the likelihood of cracks. I did have to change some things, and wanted to change others. After mixing the crust I found it WAY too greasy-I needed to add another 1/4 cup ground pecans and 6 more tablespoons graham cracker crumbs, so I would decrease the butter if I made this again, though I now know I prefer a gingersnap crust. I par baked it for about 5 minutes. Looking over my other pumpkin cheesecake recipes, I noticed that the ones I liked had more pumpkin in them so I increased the pumpkin to 1and 1/8 cups, adding brown instead of white sugar to the pumpkin mixture for a richer flavor, but leaving the white sugar in the cream cheese.I, like others, replaced the mace with nutmeg, and doubled the vanilla, omitting the lemon extract. Finally, I did top it with a thin layer of the maple pecan glaze from another recipe (half the recipe) which was excellent. It was best after sitting in the refrigerator for 24 hours, and tuned out restaurant quality, in my opinion. I will definitely make it this way again.

I make alot of cheesecakes.  So, I like to think of myself as a cheesecake connoisseaur.  :0)  Let me say this first: do not let the ingredients overwhelm you.  It's not as bad as you think.  Now let me say, this is truly one of the best cheesecakes I have EVER made.  It didn't crack and it held it's shape well.  Also, it had an EXCELLENT flavor.  My husband doesn't like pumpkin and he liked this.  I did change a few things.  Instead of pecans, I used walnuts.  No reason for this other than personal preference.  Also, I used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers.  I am REALLY glad I did this.  It gave the cheesecake a completely different flavor.  Instead of mace, I used nutmeg.  And doubled the vanilla extract and did not use lemon extract.  And, of course, I put it in a water bath.   With the leftover whipping cream, I made a cinnamon whipped cream.  BEAUTIFUL AND FABULOUS!!

OH MY GOD this cheesecake was amazing!! It's labor-intensive (took me around 3 hours just for the prep and baking), but SO unbelievably worth it. I used fresh pureed sugar pumpkin instead of canned, and it was delicious. I made two of these to take to a family gathering thinking I could take home the leftovers. Nope. They attacked it like a pack of hyenas. Some said it was the best dessert they'd ever had.

Do bake it with a pan of water. It's obvious, but it makes a big difference :)

Very good. Not super "pumpkiny." Cheesecake is my thing. I make a lot of them. This one cracked on me, not sure why. But I made a maple flavored whipped cream as the topping to hide it and the crack was nicely hidden. Topped the whipped cream with chopped pecans. People really enjoyed it.

I baked it too long, the top cracked and I some how managed to mess up the crust (using ginger snaps).   But it tastes fabulous.  I subbed the following--skim milk for the cream, 1/4 tsp cloves & 1/4 tsp nutmeg for the mace and the zest of one lemon for the lemon extract.  Gobble, Gobble.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes in my time and this one was just o.k.  I think the crust had WAY too much butter and the final product felt like it lacked something.  Hence why so many comments metioned that they made different toppings and sauces.  Next time I would definitely cut the butter in half.  It made the crust soggy.  I have seen other recipes that add more cream and I think I like those better.

Not only is this a great pumpkin cheesecake recipe!....This is the BEST cheesecake i ever tasted!...Who needs cheesecake factory when you have this?...Everybody went nuts for this recipe on thanksgiving and it was gone in less than 5 minutes!....My sister who is really skeptical and a big picky eater took a bite of this and she said that it tastes like heaven!!...I made a few changes...Instead of graham crackers for the crust i used ginger cookies(makes it even more awesome!) and about 1/2 cup pecans and a few tablespoons of brown sugar and white sugar, and i made a really simple whip cream topping along with some ginger thin cookies and pecans for decoration....if you let the cheesecake sit overnight the cookies will become moist and not only will it be easy to cut but it adds a wow factor to the cheesecake.

Very good!  I doubled the crust recipe, as I like mine to go up the sides. (Otherwise, the crust is yummy as directed!)  I used nutmeg instead of mace, like other reviewers.  I also added 1/2 t. of cloves and increased the cinnamon to 2 t.  Two mistakes:  I overbeat mine...so it rose then fell.  Learned for the future and hope you won't do the same. I also lost track of time and baked for an hour.  oops.  I placed a pan of water in the oven under the cake and had no cracks.  Even with my mistakes--yum yum.

This pumpkin cheesecake is outstanding!  I read the reviews first and used gingersnaps instead of the graham crackers... loved it!  The only other thing I changed was that I added a sour cream topping (1 container sour cream, 2 Tbs. sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon extract, 1/8 tsp. salt).  I would stick with the whipped cream as Cathy recommended, maybe vanilla flavored.  The sour cream topping was just a bit too much for the cake.  Anyway, it was a great hit - thank you so much for sharing!  I will make this again!!

Top with glaze: 1 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup maple syrup. Simmer for 20 minutes add 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour on top of cake for last 5-10 minutes of baking. I even broiled it a bit. I made this for friends who are allergic to gluten, had to substitute finely ground cornflakes for the graham wafer crumbs though. They were very impressed!

this set wonderfully! It was soo easy to make and it looks fantastic. I actually decided to go without the pecans on top. Im going to whip up a vanilla mousse and top it with that. Thanks again!

excelent. I made a few alterations to mine, but it turned out amazing. The first time I made this my fiance forgot to get the cracker crumbs at the store... so, if you don't have anything else, CHEERIOS will work!! the graham crackers are best, but  I found that the cheerios worked nicely too - just make sure they're crushed up completely or the crust with be "chewy". also, I added 1/2tsp cinn and 1/4tsp nutmeg to the crust - added a very nice taste to it. 

Let's see, for the topping - if you just use the rest of the heavy cream that's fine, but add about 3tsp of powdered sugar, about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cinn and one drop of vanilla to really make it taste good. (it won't taste heavily sugared or spiced at all).

And if you're thinking of something even more daring, make the whip cream as above, but also make a caramel drizzle to go over that and on the plate. It will look and taste amazing :)

This was a great recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was quite the favorite.  The only thing I found difficult was that the crust was very crumbly.  Once it was baked it was fine though.  Also, I probably should have put it in the refrigerator sooner as it sunk along the edges.

This was a really nice cheesecake!  I didn't change any of the ingredients -- I just didn't have any lemon extract so I didn't use it.  The bottom was particularly tasty with the ground pecans.  Watch the baking time.  I'm glad I took it out at 50 minutes because the top was starting to brown quickly.

I made this recipe and it was a great crowd pleaser. I added some rum extract (just 1/2 a teaspoon)and it was a welcomed flavor accent. Next batch I make will have a white & regular chocolate sprinkles with carmel and pecans for a blended topping to give it even more pizzaz!!

HUGE hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  Of all the desserts, this one was gone in first, in five minutes or less.  My only alteration was that I did not include the pecans on top.  I just left it plain.  It's a keeper.

Best ever! Instead of using a 9" spring pan, I used 2 8" cake pans. I doubled the recipe for the crust and split the batter between both. My husband doesn't like pumpkin pie, but he loves this

This was the first cheesecake i ever made and it turned out very good. I did however only make a few changes, i added one cup of pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup, added nutmeg instead of mace, and didnt add the lemon. It turned out excellent. The only problem i had was that the crust stuck to the bottom of the pan, even tho i sprayed with pam. Not sure what caused that, maybe because the crust should of been baked for a few minutes before adding the filling, im not sure. But for this being the first cheesecake ive ever made i do have to say it tasted wonderful!

This cheesecake is amazing! I omitted the lemon extract and used nutmeg instead of mace. I also used a gingersnap crust (with pecans instead of walnuts). The result was a creamy cheesecake with the right amount of pumpkin flavor. I will be making this again! Thanks!

Thank You for this recipe! Absolute Heaven! I made it yesterday as a practice run for Thanksgiving and I swear its just as good as any bakery or restaraunt version. Takes a lot of time though, you need to make it when you will be home all day. I let my eggs and cream cheese sit on the counter for 3-4 hours ahead. I used nutmeg in place of mace and omitted the lemon extract. Baked in a waterbath and left in the oven for 1 1/2 hours after it was done. It didnt crack or sink at all. It also pulled away from the pan perfectly. After the oven it went on a cooling rack then to the fridge overnight. Today I topped it with a cream cheese topping from another recipe. 1/2 block cream cheese room temp 1/4c. sugar, 1/2tsp. vanilla, wisk in homemade whipped cream. (Left over whipping cream, 2tbsp powdered sugar, 1/2tsp vanilla.) Spread on top of cheesecake and I sprinkled it with ground pecans. It really is worth the effort!

Very very yummy!  Easy to make and turned out wonderful.  I adapted this recipe by using 1 cup pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup, using a gingersnap crust, and adding a bit more of the spices.  I also made it in a 9x13 pan and cut it into bars to serve as finger food.  The consistency was wonderful, and the flavors balanced just right.  I put a thin layer of the cheese filling over the crust before adding the pumpkin, and I think this helped to define the flavors.  Very easy, very tasty, I will be making this again!  Great for casual sesonal get-togethers.

This recipe is very good.  The consistency is perfect and the crust is the best graham cracker crust I have ever had.  I will use it for all my recipes now.  I thought the actual pumpkin flavor was a little lacking, and will probably use less cream cheese next time and more pumpkin (I'm hoping this won't affect the consistency).  I felt the recommended amount of spice was a little weak, so I beefed it up a bit. Can't say how much though, because I did it to taste.  The only other thing I have to say is that I would use lemon juice rather than lemon extract.  Other than that, it was awesome.

A+ Recipe! Absolutely amazing, and not super hard...don't be intimidated by the ingrediants!! Also, don't change the crust..I too normally don't prefer graham cracker crusts as they are usually boring, but the pecans and 2 types of sugar really make this an amazing crust...simply wonderful all the way around!

This is a great cheesecake.  The lemon extract made it very good - excellent flavor and texture.  Everyone loved it.  I only put in the 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, as called for, and 1/8 t. nutmeg, because I'm not crazy about mace or ginger (they are too strong).

Just made this Christmas 2011.  The family loved it.  Although there are many ingredients and steps, it really is quite simple to follow.  This is the first cheesecake I've ever made - now I'm inspired to always make my own.  Thanks.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It was very well received!  Extremely rich and smooth.  I added just a little clove and pumpkin pie spice about 1 tsp each to the recipe to give it a little extra zip.  I also used the maple pecan glaze recipe for the top of the cheesecake that I saw in another review.  Excellent recipe!!

I'll give it 5 because everyone liked it so much.  I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan so I wasn't as excited, but everyone else loved it.  It's a pretty easy recipe.  It looks more complicated than it really is.  Just follow the steps and it comes out great.

Beautiful and delicious!  For the glaze, I just put maple syrup, a bit of creamer, and some brown sugar in a pot and boiled it  down, then drizzled it over the cheesecake.  It helps keep the pecans in place.  Looks, smells, and tastes professional!!!

Although this cheelsecake was good, it was not whwat I expected at all.  Not enough pumpkin flavour for what I wanted, and a tad too much lemon, although it makes the cheesecake very melt-in-your-mouth tasting.  The texture on this is PERFECT, I would have given it a 3 on flavor, but the texture makes it a delight to eat, no matter what the flavor is.

Easy and amazing!! I used half fat free, half low fat cream cheese, fat free half & half instead of cream and substituted ginger snaps for graham crackers like others suggested. This is the start to a new Thanksgiving tradition! YUM

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I also made a batch into cupcakes so that it would cook and cool faster, also turned out great.  I didn't have mace, so substituted it with all spice.  I also put Lite Cool Whip and sprinkled some toasted graham cracker crumbs with pecans on top of the cake.  Made it just a tad sweeter, which I think would be not sweet enough without it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made my crust with gingersnaps instead of graham crackers. This came out perfect! It was delicious with whipped cream. I took it to my boyfriends home for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a huge hit.  I made it a second time, changing it slightly, for a New Year's luncheon.  I remembered to put the whipped cream in the 2nd time, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and used less sugar.  I also doubled the lemon and the vanilla extracts.  They made a huge difference in the taste, in a good way.  Everyone who eats this cheesecake loves it, including children!  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

This is a phenomenal cheesecake recipe.  I have made it several time, but always with a variation of the maple pecan glaze suggested by another reviewer.  Put 1/2 cup of whipping cream 1/4 cup of maple syrup in a sauce pan and simmer for 20 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and chill the glaze.  The glaze just complements the cheesecake perfectly and it also hides any imperfections to the top. Seriously my favorite recipe to make with pumpkin, and I never change a thing.

This cheesecake is great!  I usually like to eat cheesecake close to room temperature but this cheesecake was best straight out of the fridge.  The flavor was even better after a day or two.

This recipe is divine and is continually requested by my family at the holidays. I've made it dairy-free (due to food allergies) with much success. If you want tips, please DM me. I also subbed out gingersnaps for the graham crackers this year and it was very good.

Best pumpkin cheesecake recipe I've made yet. This cheesepie is light and fluffy, but still has that rich density that you just have to love about cheesecake. Even those around my Thanksgiving table that said they didn't like pumpkin desserts, or even cheesecake for that matter, really enjoyed this. It's a great alternative to pumpkin pie, and is just bursting with seasonal goodness. I substituted the graham crackers in the crust for gingersnaps (an idea I got from another recipe on this site), and added the sour cream topping from the old Libby's recipe, like a couple other reviewers. I used a ten inch pan, so the pie came out a littler thinner. Make sure to use a water bath to keep the top from cracking. After I had baked it for 50 minutes, I removed the pie, turned off the oven and then spread on the sour cream glaze. I returned it to the warm oven and let it cool inside for about an hour. I then let it sit on the counter till the edges had completely separated from the side of the pan, then refrigerated overnight. Garnished with a few curls of orange zest and a coffee bean star, this was the most presentable dessert of the day. I can't wait to treat myself to the one leftover piece and a cup of coffee tonight after work!

THE SINGLE BEST CHEESECAKE RECIPE PERIOD! I love this recipe so much I popped another one in the oven after tasting the first bite of the one I made this morning. I just know it will run out fast at my family function. It was perfect for the holidays but the cheesecake mixture for this recipe is good on its own as well. If you arent into pumpkin, you can still use the second portion of this recipe for a plain old cheesecake. MMM scrumptious!

This is by far the best cheese cake I've ever had. My husband loves it. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. I do have problems with it cracking, but I just cover it up with some cream and it looks as good as it tastes. :)

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out almost perfectly. It was easy to make, the directions were clear, and the cheesecake was delicious!

Overall delicious.  For me, too sweet.  I did substitute ginger snaps for the graham cracker crumbs and doubled the amount for crust that surrounded entire cake.  Next time I will decrease sugar and maybe increase pumpkin.

OK, WOW.  I made this as a trial run to see if people liked it and if so, I would make it for Thanksgiving.  I took it into work (I'm in the Army) and my Brigade Commander and Battalion Commander were the first to try it.  Then everyone else dug in.  Smashing success!!!  The directions are so logical and the ingredients may seem like a lot, but it's SO worth it.  When it finished cooking, I turned off the oven but cracked the door opened and let it cool and had no blemishes or cracks!!!  It looked like something out of a magazine!!  I used gingersnaps for the crust along with the pecans! BRAVO.  Also, no mace here in Germany, so I used nutmeg, it didn't matter, it was WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!

I really liked this recipe. I've made many a pumpkin cheesecake before and this seemed much easier than others. I brought it to a potluck and several people commented to me afterwards how much they enjoyed it. The only changes I made orig was to use some nutmeg instead of mace since I could not find that in any of the stores I looked. Next time I will increase the pumpkin a bit and decrease the lemon flavoring as the cheesecake didn't taste all tha pumpkiny. I think with those changes it will make a great thing even better.

This is ridiculously good.  I don't even like pumpkin and it was amazing.  I doubled the crust as it's my favorite part of the cheesecake.  I also omitted the lemon extract and added a sour cream topping.  Sour cream topping is 2 cups of sour cream, 3 TBSP sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  After cheesecake bakes, put topping on and bake for 5-10 minutes longer.  Highly recommend using this topping.

WOW!!! I've only made one other cheesecake in my life, but I've EATEN a lot of cheesecake and this one was to DIE for!!! So creamy and smooth and with a great flavor. I used pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp) instead of all of the singular spices and it was SO yummy. I also doubled the crust recipe, and that was a WISE idea because the crust has such good flavor. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!!!

Wonderful.  I make these and sell them to my husband's coworkers around the holidays.  I've made probably 3 dozen of these and they are fabulous.  I don't feel the lemon extract is necessary- doesn't come through at all anyway.

These were delicious, I made mini pumpkin cheesecake muffins out of them instead of one big cheesecake, and I forgot to buy whipping cream so had to use regular ole' milk, but they still turned out perfect.  I couldnt even imagine how much better they would have been if i had the whipping cream.

It took also a bit to find Mace in the grocery store.  that was the only problem I had.

Made this one for Thanksgiving and it was awesome.  I used ginger snaps for the crust, and even though gingersnaps are pretty strong, the crust turned out wonderful, and the cheesecake was delicious.  Omitted the pecans in the crust due to a nut allergy in the family, but they were not missed.  Thinking about making this again for another holiday dinner.  Excellent recipe.

I chose this recipe because of the crust, and it was heavenly! I see that I accidentally omitted the cornstarch and purposefully omitted the lemon, but the end result was fantastic so it must not have mattered. Not a fan of pumpkin pie, but I think I'll make this every year!

This was amazing!! I made it for the first time for a dress rehearsal I was catering for. I wasn't expecting it to be gobbled up so much! (I had to sneak a tiny slice out for my husband to try) He loved it! We're going to break tradition for Thanksgiving and have a pumpkin cheesecake. I made the whipped cream for it too-YUMMY!!!

I adapted this recipe to make mini cheesecakes in muffin tins.  The recipe makes 18 mini cheesecakes, which I baked for 20 minutes.  They came out perfectly and everyone loved them.  To have enough crust, I did increase the crust ingredients to 1 cup graham crackers and 1 extra tablespoon sugar for the mini version.  I also used the pecan maple glaze suggested by another reviewer. Very fabulous!

Simply put - Wow! One of the best recipes I've gotten on this site. It needed to cook a full hour; at 50-55 minutes the middle wasn't as firm as it should have been. I topped it with the heavy cream/maple syrup/pecan glaze, but next time I would scale back the amount to half the heavy cream & half the syrup (it was way too much, almost soaked the cheesecake and I didn't even use it all).

I can't think of any complaints with this recipe.  The crust was especially good!  I made it exactaly as the recipe called for only omitting the lemon juice & 1 spice that I didn't have. I was actually a little surprised that it came out so well because I live in a high altitude climate, so sometimes baking can be qite challenging...but it came out PERFECT...no cracks whatsoever!

Where's the option for six stars??? This cheesecake was AWESOME. This was the first cheesecake I ever made, and I had to make it twice for back-to-back party requests. I even botched it the first time, adding pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin, so it was softer than it should have been. Both times the top cracked, but I used the maple pecan glaze suggested by an earlier reviewer and it covered the crack and made for a to-die-for additional flavor layer. Will DEFINITELY be making again!!

This tasted like pumpkin pie. I only gave it 4 stars bc it seemed a bit dry and it came out a lot thinner than I expected.. I was going to make this for a company Christmas party, but have changed my mind. Seems more of a Thanksgiving dessert.

Amazing!! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was gone in 5 minutes. Added the pecan glaze from another recipe, and it turned out fantastic. Definitely a new tradition.

I made this twice now and it was great.  The top cracked pretty badly even with a pan of water beneath but I just topped it with the design in the picture (whole and diced pecans). My friends thought that I bought it because it was so perfect!  I do not like pumpkin but it doesn't have too much. My desserts never come out as good as I would like and this one was great!

I haven't made this yet, but I've made one similar. However, I AM going to make this for a housewarming party this weekend.  I don't really like graham cracker crust on cheesecake (except for Autumn Cheesecake from this site...yummy). For pumpkin, I prefer to use gindersnap cookies. It's gives the cake a bit more punch.

I loved it. I have never ever made pumpkin cheesecake before, but after reading all your reviews I dared. I loved the flavor, even the texture. I love cheesecakes and the texture from this recipe was amazing. I couldn't find whipping cream though, but it seems like it didn't need it. I loved it!

My sister made this for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely delicious, smooth and creamy.  I'm pretty sure she made it with a gingersnap crust. She also made the sauce as mentioned by one of the first reviewers with the cream, maple syrup and pecans.  It tasted like fall - perfect for thanksgiving!

This is my second time making this recipe. It was wonderful! It does seem like a daunting list of ingredients but it is definitely worth it. I did do like others suggested and make a ginger snap crust instead, which i think greatly improved the recipe. Also, I omitted the heavy whiping cream because I did not have any. It still was great. I would recommend this to anyone. My family dosen't even like pumpkin pie but they loved this.

Delicious recipe. I had never made cheesecake before and this recipe made me look like a pro.. I followed it exactly except: 1) I doubled the crust, 2) substituted nutmeg for mace, 3) used light butter instead of regular, and 4) used 2 package of 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese, and 1 package of regular.. in an attempt to make it a little healthier. No one noticed! My only complaint was that the crust was rather wet and wasn't very "crusty". Maybe too much butter? Either way, it was very tastey! I will definitely be making this recipe again. I cooked it in a waterbath and cracked the oven door open after turning the oven off and let the cheesecake sit for about 5 minutes. Then I let it cool on a wire rack for about an hour with a cookie sheet on top of it to slow down the cooling process. Finally, I left it in the refrigerator overnight.. Not a single crack!

This was an awesome recipe.  Everyone loved it, it was a change up to the annual pumpkin pie.   The changes I made was I made 1.5x the crust and used ginger snaps which really added some spice.  I baked at 45 min at 325F, turned off the oven, covered the cheesecake with a cookie sheet and left the cheesecake in there another 2 hrs.  There were NO CRACKS...Will definitely make again next year.

This recipe is simply AMAZING. I made this for my family's thanksgiving and everyone loved it! 5 stars because this is the most delicious cheesecake I have ever had.  I was mostly strict to the recipe, but doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, and added pinch more on all of the spices. I thought the additional spices made it perfect and would have been slightly bland without it, but thats just my taste. I also used fresh lime juice because I was out of lemon extract which worked well.  I followed other's advice in adding the whipping cream / maple syrup gaze, which made a great addition to the dish, but I ended up with much more then needed to give it a nice even cover, so next time I will try 1/2 recipe first.  This recipe is a MUST try.

Yummy!  I've tried a few pumpkin cheesecake recipes before, but this one is the best!  It is quite spicy and delicious and the pumpkin does not overpower it.  I ground my own pecans and the crust was devine.  It did take an extra 10 minutes to cook.

A great recipe! I've already made it twice but the second time I omitted the lemon flavoring, mace and cornstarch. We didn't miss any of those things at all. We did use the maple cream sauce other cooks suggested and it was wonderful on top!

DON'T leave out the whipping cream! The first time I made it I made three changes: fresh pumpkin, 1/2 c brown w/ 1/4 c white sugar, and added a simple topping (1/2 c pecans, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1-2 T butter). It was the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted. The second time we forgot to add the whipping cream. 2T doesn't seem like much but the cheesecake was 1/2 as tall. Instead of firming up at 3 in tall, it was 1-1/2 inches. So USE THE WHIPPING CREAM!

Absolutely delicious!! I multiplied the crust by about 1.5x to make it nice and thick, and to be able to cover the sides. Everyone absolutely loved it, and other than adding more of the crust, I didn't change a thing. Would absolutely make again!

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake. I made it for a special occasion and my mother, who is a cheesecake connosseur, just loved it!! So did everyone else! It was a lot of work, but worth it. I made sure to slowly cool it down, in off oven, on counter, then fridge. I am not a fan of cheesecake personally, but this was DELISH. followed recipe exactly! Must make for holiday get togethers!

I made this cheesecake for my friends in my card club and they loved it!!  This recipe is very easy and so very good. I did not change a thing. The pumpkin and spice flavor was just right. Not too strong. And the crust just may become the crust I use for all my cheesecakes. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was not that good!  I have definitely had better pumpkin cheescake!  This recipe cost a lot to make, so I was truly disappointed when it didn't even taste good!  Atleast I can say I tried it, you have to take the good with the bad I guess!

MMMMMMMM......!   This recipe was everything I hoped for and more!  I changed it around a little to make it a bit more healthy...I added sucanat into the crust instead of the sugars, then whipped pure maple syrup into the pumpkin mixture instead of sugar, and finally added 3T of honey with the cream cheese instead of sugar.  You would have never guessed it was a healthy version! I didn't have any mace (I don't think I've ever used the stuff), so I sprinkled in some nutmeg and added a bit of cloves too.  I baked it for about an hour and 10 minutes in a water bath, at 325.  Very good! It seems just slightly softer set than other cheesecakes, but after chilling overnight, quite solid, and that could have been my substitutions...this recipe is DEFINITELY going into my stash.  It was SOOOOO good!

Absolutely incredible!!  I made this for Thanksgiving.  My family are experts in cheesecake and pumpkin pie and they loved it. I highly recommend only cooking for 40 minutes compared to 50 minutes.  Also adding coolwhip as a topping adds to the flavor and presentation.

Have made this recipe for 3 years running now and it always gets great reviews.  I like lighter cheesecakes and the consistency of this one is perfect.  The crust is also always a hit... and despite the number of ingredients it is not hard to make.

This is very good and not too much pumpkin.  My family loved it!  It is very easy to make.  I did not have to worry about it cracking.  I topped it with a little whipped topping and a pecan.  Looked and tasted great!!!

I made this for work and everyone liked it but it did not have enough pumpkin flavor for me. I was hoping for a more pumpkin pie like consistency.

I made this for work and everyone liked it but it did not have enough pumpkin flavor for me. I was hoping for a more pumpkin pie like consistency.

I tried this recipe two years ago for Thanksgiving and it is the best one for Pumpkin I've ever had. It has become the official dessert for Thanksgiving at my home. It definitely is worth the effort.

Due to a nut allergy in our family, I made this recipe without the pecans. Even still, it's a five star recipe. I can't even imagine how wonderful it must be with the pecans!

No one in my wife's family likes pumpkin pie.  However they liked this pumpkin cheesecake and I get my holiday pumpkin fix. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. Great recipe!

This was a hit.  Instead of mace I added nutmeg.  Also make sure you make the pecan topping suggested by someone else.  It is what made this over the top.

Takes some time to bake and cool, so don't wait til the evening to start. Recipe was worth the effort--everyone came back for seconds and thirds! I also made it with the maple/whipping cream sauce but doubled the pecans and toasted them first. Next time, I'll try with a gingersnap crust.

Fantastic pumpkin cheesecake!  This cheesecake was gone in two days and has been demanded for every Thanksgiving henceforth.  I used cinnamon graham crackers because well, it just sounded good (and it was delicious)!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the spices.  I had a Pampered Chef Cinnamon Blend and tossed a couple of teaspoons of that in, in place of the spices.  Also, I served it with bourbon whipped cream.  Oh man!  Great stuff!

This was excellent! I cooked it for 52 Min. and unfortunately the cake looked totally done but wasn't in the middle. Still great flavor in the crust with the pecans and made the pecan maple sauce listed...amazing! DO NOT MAKE THIS WITHOUT that sauce!

This is the best cheesecake I've ever had!!!!  I used gingersnaps for the crust in place of graham crackers.  Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and was blown away at how great it was.  Was able to omit some ingredients (lemon, mace and pecans) and it still was wonderful.  The texture was unlike other cheesecakes I've had, but the flavor was out of this world.  I whipped up my own whipped topping, adding some of the same spices and a dash of vanilla extract, which made this homemade cheesecake a crowd favorite and a recipe I am definitely using again.

I made 2 of these cheesecakes for thanksgiving, 1 for my family and 1 for my boyfriends family.  I thought it was really spicey.  I couldn't finish all of my slice.  I suggest cutting the spices in half.  My boyfriends family said it was good but not great and I agreed so I wasn't upset by their comments.  I did the pecans on the top too, which came out to be pecan overload.. in all the cheesecake wasn't that great. I wouldn't make this one again

This was a little time consuming but so worth it!  Everyone at Thanksgiving was raving about it!  And finishing with the homemade whipped cream made it seem so special...and that is so easy to do!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe for our Thanksgiving feast and followed it to the letter.  This was my second attempt at making cheesecake and it turned out great!  The ONLY thing that I wish I had done differently was how I baked it.  I read through many cheesecake reviews and found that someone suggested using a plastic roasting bag for the water bath to prevent water leaking in.  I used foil and I think some of the water leaked through, but it didn't really affect the cheesecake that much.  It might have made the crust a bit soggy, but the cheesecake itself was so good, so it really didn't matter.  After baking for the recommended 50 to 55 minutes, I just turned the oven off and left it for about 2 hours.  After that I transferred it to the fridge.  No cracks!  It actually looked like a professionally baked cheesecake!  The texture is smooth and creamy - and very rich.  This one is a keeper for sure!

If I could give it more stars, I would.  I didn't use pecans because I don't like them.  I even messed up the mixing of the pumpkin pie filling with the cheesecake (I just spread the pumpkin pie mix on top of the other!) and this cheesecake was absolutely delicious.  The BEST cheesecake I've ever had.  Definitely a keeper (I've already been asked to make this for two separate Christmas parties!)

This was my first attempt at pumpkin cheesecake, but it was not the first time that I have eaten it.  This recipe was good, but not my favorite.  I had to use nutmeg instead of mace, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I cooked it as directed, however in a water bath, and the results were a perfect cheesecake.  Try serving with homemade whipped cream with a touch of bourbon in it.

I have made this twice now. Both times it has been raved over. I always double the crust and use gingersnap cookies instead of graham cracker crumbs. I also substitute 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg in place of the 1/2 tsp. mace. Both times it has been great and will remain a staple in my dessert box. I highly recommend it. It does have lots of ingredients, but you really don't even notice once you get started, and the compliments you will get for it will make it totally worth it.

1. This is an easy recipe to make gluten free. As written, the only ingredient with gluten in it is the graham crackers in the crust. To make the crust gluten free replace graham crackers with 3/4 a cup of almond flour and follow the recipe. >>>>2. I made a very simple caramel glaze to top it with. (3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Stir and bring to a boil. Drizzle over the top before serving. Very delicious!

This cheesecake was fantastic! I've never made a cheesecake before, but I was spending thanksgiving at my bf's mom's place, so I wanted to bring something delicious- this definitely fit the bill!   I read every article I could find about preventing cheesecake cracking and tried all the tricks, and my cheesecake still cracked... so I suggest you just accept this and go with it. On the plus side, the pecan maple glaze recommended by everyone is not only delicious, but looks wonderful on top of the cake (and hides every flaw).   I can't really add anything here that hasn't already been said, except for one thing. Most recently I made this cheesecake using Trader Joe's Old Fashioned Cinnamon Grahams for the crust. These are delicious, and I recommend them, but since they are sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, I would halve the white and brown sugar in the crust so it doesn't turn out too sweet.  Thanks Cathy!

Delicious! The pecan crust is AMAZING. I ended up using a 10" springform pan on this one since I was making it for a large dinner party. The cheesecake definitely wasn't as tall, but it still looked great anyway and there was more than enough!  Definitely a great recipe. I used the extra whipping cream to make homemade whipped cream for a simple topping.

This is a wonderful, light (texture) cheesecake.  I used 2 teaspoons of Trader Joe's pumpkin spice which has lemon in it and omitted the lemon extract.  It gave just a hint of lemon without being overwhelming.   Mine came out just a touch on the soft side - it made it difficult to cut without ruining the presentation.  Freezing the cheesecake (it will still be somewhat soft) and cutting with a hot knife will do the trick if it is for a special event.  Enjoy!

This was very good; however, I would cut back on the lemon extract.  It was a little distracting from the pumpkin flavor.  Otherwise - terrific!

This was great - the crust was amazing. I wish it had tasted just a bit more like cheesecake and a bit less like pumpkin, BUT - it's PUMPKIN cheesecake... so I guess that's okay :)

The only change to the recipe I made was to omit lemon extract. I didn't have it. I thought the taste and consistency of the cheesecake was great. The crust just didn't match up to me though. I think I would try something different if doing it again. I cooked it the recommended 50 minutes--no problems setting up the wiggly center, but the crust was overdone in that amount of time. Guests loved it, but I did think it was lacking a bit. Served drizzled with some dulce de leche sauce. Nice addition.

I substituted tart gingersnap cookies for the graham crackers and then made the glaze recommended by the other reviewers with 1 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup maple syrup.  Chill before serving.  Excellent!

Sooooo delicious.  Make sure to bring all ingredients to room temperature before using them (to prevent future cracking) and use a water bath in the oven.
1)  I used ground walnuts for the crust 2)I added more pumpkin than called for.  3) I ommited the lemon extract
4) Used another reviewer's recommendation for a glaze:  Simmer 1 cup whipping cream with 3/4 cup real maple syrup for about 20 min; stir in 1/2 cup chopped pecans and chill.  
The glaze is a must.  However, it does not "look" pretty b/c the chopped pecans are gloopy, so weigh the extraordinary taste of the pecans against the aesthetic presentation concerns.

This was the first cheesecake I have made, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Reminder: take the creamcheese out ahead of time - room temp. is key.

Amazing. I already have 5 to make for Thanksgiving. After reading reviews I too used 1 cup pumpkin and omitted the lemon extract. Also made the crust from gingersnaps, graham cracker crumbs and crushed pecans. Delicious!

Another winner. I won first prize for this cake at a local bake off.  The crust has become the example from which I now make all my cheesecake crusts. I just change the nuts depending on the cheesecake I am making.  So much tastier than the traditional graham cracker crust.

This cheesecake was delicious! To keep it from cracking, I baked it in a water bath. I glazed it afterwards with a sour cream glaze, sweetened with maple syrup. The guests loved it!!

Excellent cheescake.  I served it for Thanksgiving dessert with the maple pecan glaze from this recipe - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Maple-Pumpkin-Cheesecake/Detail.aspx.  Everyone said it was really good.  I baked it in a water bath for 55 minutes then let cool in the oven for 2 hours before chilling overnight in the fridge then freezing.  When we served it, I noticed the inside was pretty runny inside.  Next time I will increase the baking time to at least one full hour.

This was awesome. I cooked it for too long and forgot to put the whip cream on afterwards and it was still amazing.
Thanks for a delicious recipe.

So awesome!  I love pumpkin pie but after eating this I don't think I can ever eat a regular pumpkin pie again.  Served with Thanksgiving dinner and everyone left with the recipe (even people that don't eat pumpkin pie).  Worth the time it takes!

Just served this to our office as a special fall treat - wow, did it go over big!  Have had many requests for the recipe.  This is well worth the extra time it takes!  I made one change - found it too lemony with 1/2 tsp lemon extract, so I cut it to 1/4 tsp lemon extract and upped the vanilla to 3/4 tsp (running over).  Perfect for us!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving!  I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust, and with the pecans, the crust was the best part!  I do think it was a tad overdone...next time I will only bake it for 45 minutes.

I've found that this recipe is even better if you substitute 1 cup of mild molasses & 1 cup of granulated sugar for every 1 cup of brown sugar.

Absolutely awesome.  I have celiac's disease so we substituted the graham crackers with gluten free snickerdoodles from Enjoy Life. Also instead of Mace (didn't have), we used cloves and nutmeg.  This was by far the BEST dessert I have had that could be made gluten free with such a minor substitution.  A MUST FOR ANYONE WITH CELIACS!!!  And as a plus not one person at Thanksgiving could tell it was GF, it is so delish!!

Fabulous recipe!  A little work, but worth it.  I substituted the spices for a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. I also used a ginger snap crust. Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was okay.  The crust was my favorite part.  I thought the acutal cheesecake part was above average, but no one raved about it, and I don't think I would make it again.

This cake passed the acid test.  I actually OVERBAKED the thing by a full 30 minutes the night before Thanksgiving - and STILL received rave reviews from family (and the coworkers who got the leftovers).  Awesome.

Oh my goodness this was so good! Even with a long list on ingredients this went together very easy, I didn't have any lemon concentrate so that was the only change I made.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe.

Pecans in crust were great, next time i would use less butter in crust because the butter dripped out the bottom while it baked filling house with smoke :(  I did not have mace so I subbed pumpkin pie spice for all spices. I also did not have any lemon extract so I left it out, still it was good. Hoping to try it again with all ingredients!

Oh my god! I have been making cheesecake since I was able to hold a spoon. This is the best recipe ever. I added the cheesecake frosting, that somebody mentioned in the reviews (THANK YOU!) and it was a hit at my in laws.
Oh and I used chocolate graham crackers. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe, it was gobbled up before I could get a pix. I did not use the ground pecans due to some allergies within the group so I increased the ground graham crackers by 1/2 cup. Made a topping of: 1 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup whipping cream, and 2 T. powdered sugar. I spread that over the top of the cheesecake and a bit of crumbs around the edge.

Added some maple syrup to batter, the other thing I did was use an 8inch pan to make it New York Cheesecake Thick.  It was smooth, creamy, restaurant quality cheesecake! Yummo!

Amazing! I made this cheesecake exactly how it was written, with the exception of using a gingersnap cookie crust and including a sour cream topping swirled with pumpkin butter. I brought this over to my boyfriend's family's house for Thanksgiving and have the following to say:
1. People couldn't believe I had made it alone.
2. Mine was the prettiest of all the pies!
3. It was gone within the hour.

This is a delicious pumpkin cheesecake recipe and has moved to the top of my favorites. I made it for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! The only thing I changed was using allspice instead of mace, and placing the graham cracker/pecan crust into the oven for about 10 minutes to set. Also, when baking the final product it helps to set the spring form pan in the center of a shallow roasting pan filled with 1-2 inches of water. This will prevent cracking.

This cheesecake is wonderful! I used a ginger snap crust with the pecans and everyone raved about this cheesecake! I will be making this again REAL soon. I used the maple glaze and was glad I did, but you don't have to because this cheesecake is good either way!

This recipe was awesome!  I made it and brought it to work and it was gone within and hour.  I got all rave reviews of it.  The only change I made was that I added cloves and nutmeg and eliminated the mace because I didn't have any in the house, it's not something I ever cook with.  The flavors were great, and the cheesecake looked beautiful.

I've made this for the past two holiday seasons and every year I keep getting asked to make more for other occasions.  Everyone of my friends and family love this as a change of pace from the traditional pumpkin pie, which I make as well.  For an added touch of flavor I a substituted half of the cream with Irish cream and make a sour cream, english toffee glaze with pecans using the recipes already listed and just adding the english toffee flavoring.  BEAUTIFUL!

I loved this cheesecake!  I was in a hurry to get it baked before going to my son's hockey game...I didn't have time to do the water bath.  I left the door open with the oven turned off when done for about 10 minutes then had to leave, so I shut the door while I was gone.  I came back about 4 hours later and the cake had 2 very small cracks on top.  But with the pecan decoration it hid the flaws and looked beautiful.  All the pumpkin skeptics in my family loved it, great recipe!

I made this recipe for a bunch of friends- it was my first attempt at cheesecake making.  The cake got rave reviews, some even called it "the best cheesecake they'd ever eaten."  I found a recipe for whipped cream cheese topping which I used as a finishing touch along with some pecans for decoration. Highly recommend!

My husband was looking forward to this dessert as he is a big fan of pumpkin pies. The cheesecake was yummy, but didn't taste enough of the pumpkin in our opinion. We're going to try the recipe again with a bit more pumpkin to see if that is more to our liking. :)

This was FANTASTIC.  I took it to an office party and everybody raved.  I did use pumpkin pie spice instead of the all other spices.  I used chocolate graham crackers, mixed the nuts and very little butter.  the crust was almost dry when I put it in but it came out perfect. Not at all greasy and the chocolate crust was awesome.  very good cheesecake.

This is an amazing recipe--I have replaced all my cheesecake crusts with this wonderful pecan crust.  I did use the maple topping from one of the reviewers which was different from what I expected- I thought it would be a clear glaze but it was milky. The flavor was incredible, however, and we left it on the table as an optional topping.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately I didn't get to have any because I had to go to another family members house, but it was definitely a huge hit!  Rave reviews from family.  I am definitely going to make this again for Christmas!

Absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to omit the lemon extract and increase the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Mine cracked like the Andreas Fault even with a pan of water beneath but it was a hit at Thanksgiving.

WOW!  This was awesome and a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Even though it is a cheesecake it isn't as heavy as some cheesecakes can be.  Just the right amount of pumpkin even for those that normally don't like pumpkin.  Very easy to make and you can make it a day or two ahead of time.  If you don't have mace you can substitute pumpkin pie spice however I followed this recipe to the letter.  Try a water bath while cooking to avoid cracks.  Just perfect and I will make it again.

This pumpkin cheesecake recipe made my first attempt at cheesecake a big success!  I made this recipe for my husband's family Thanksgiving and got many compliments.  I had thought about making a different recipe, one that my husband had at his work and really enjoyed, but I stuck with my original idea and it earned me rave reviews.  My husband and his coworker even said they enjoyed my cheesecake better than the one they had at work!  I don't care for pecans so omitted them from the recipe, but still used the maple glaze for a topping and it was awesome!

excellent! per prior reviews, I omitted lemon & vanilla extract and cooked with 9x13 pan of water underneath to avoid cracks. I swirled butterscotch topping on top for presentation.

Wow...this one is definitely a keeper.  I made a "draft" for a couple of family members to decide if I wanted this to be my contribution to the Thanksgiving get-togethers...now I have to make four of them!  I forgot the cornstarch, but didn't miss it.  I also put in a full cup of pumpkin, per other reviews.  I was set to make the suggested maple glaze, but my mom suggested using butterscotch caramel ice cream topping drizzled and a sprinkling of ground pecans...SO GOOD.

This cheesecake was pretty easy to make and the crust is one of the best I've had.  I felt like the finished product was a little too spicy so next time I will substitute the mace with nutmeg.  Everyone who tried it loved it!

This pumpkin cheesecake was exactly what the dessert I wanted to make for our family Thanksgiving get-together. It was delicious and a big hit! I will definitely make it again.

I didn't think the recipe was difficult at all, despite the long ingrediates list.

This was my first cheesecake, and thankfully it was a hit at Thanksgiving. The perfectionist in me was upset when it cracked, but I took inspiration from another reviewer and made a whipped cream and maple syrup glaze and topped it off with choppsed and whole pecans just as shown in the picture. It looked nice afterwards, but I will work on other techniques to prevent it from cracking in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  The center of mine was a bit too wobbly so next time I might cook it for the full 55 minutes.  I didn't really like the pecans in the crust so next time I might substitute another nut or just go plain graham crackers.  Even so, the filling tasted great!  Will definitely make this again.

Wow cathy thank you sooooo much for this recipe! I am not a big cheesecake eater, so I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it is the best! My family and friends loved it. Only thing I did different was to use a little less then 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of each spice separatly, and it came out great.

O.K...first let me say I hate you Cathy, because this recipe was SOOO good that I couldn't stop going back for seconds and I've probably gained 10lbs from eating it!!  A REALLY REALLY good cheesecake.  Wonderfully smooth with a satiny taste and just the right amount of ingredients as to not over whelm you with the taste of one thing or another.  Makes a WONDERFUL presentation.  This will now become our family "regular" instead of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.

This was truly a big hit at Thanksgiving!  I didn't have mace on-hand and wasn't able to get it at our local store so I substituted ground nutmeg and added a little extra.  I used gingersnaps (Trader Joe's is the best with pieces of ginger in them) in lieu of graham cracker crumbs and it made for the most flavorful crust.  For a yummy topping, I added dollops of homemade whipped cream, added toasted pecans and crumbled gingersnaps, and drizzled on homemade caramel sauce.  It was truly fantastic!

I'd used the UK/Ireland version of this recipe which was measured in grams and used castor sugar which was much more complicated....  But definitely worth the effort!  
Sure wish I'd found this version.  Very creamy and doesn't have a strong pumpkin taste.  I topped mine with sliced almonds around the edge and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips in the center.

Although I consider myself a fairly accomplished baker, I have never made a “real” cheesecake, but was craving pumpkin cheesecake. So I took the plunge. Oh.My.Gosh.  I will never make pumpkin pie again - this is WAY better!!  I pretty much followed the recipe with a few variations. I was going to do a gingersnap crust, but our nearby grocery store didn’t have ginger snaps, so I opted for cinnamon graham crackers. I added 1 tsp each of ground ginger, cinnamon and allspice to the crust mix. I doubled the recipe, but I think next time I will do 1.5x rather than double, as I think the crust was a bit thick for the cheesecake.  But it tasted amazing. As far as the cheesecake mix itself, I pretty much followed the recipe, except as many others have done, I substituted allspice for the mace, and I didn’t water bath it, but did put a dish of water in the bottom of the oven and baked it for exactly 50 minutes, then cracked the oven door and let it finish cooling in the oven. Perfect! My cake emerged without a single crack!!  I topped it with the maple pecan glaze mentioned in another review: 1 c. of whipping cream, and 3/4 c. of maple syrup, simmered for 20 minutes. Then add 1 cup pecans. Let cool and then pour over your cheesecake. Heaven!! My only regret is that I didn’t take a photo!  But this recipe is the BOMB! You will never go back to pumpkin pie again!

I've been making cheesecakes for 20 years and I do NOT like pumpkin pie. This recipe is amazing! I made it as written except I substituted nutmeg for the mace (who has made in their spice rack?) and doubled the crust so it would go up the sides of the pan also. It is rich and creamy with a mellow pumpkin flavor. Like all cheesecakes: Bake 24 hours ahead and refeigerate, use a pan of water on oven rack below, and remove from oven before cheesecake is fully set. This recipe doesnt crack, slices cleanly and sets up beautifully on a plate. Enjoy!

I made this cake yesterday with only one change. I made a ginger snap crust, but the rest was as written. I gave samples to my neighbors so I could get some feedback before I made it for a special event. Everyone said not to change a thing. It was perfect.  As a matter of fact, one of the neighbors said her husband said he wasn’t sure so could I send over a few more slices for him to try. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I will be using it often.

This cheesecake recipe is a favorite of my families, and every event I take it to I get requests for the recipe. We had an bake sale/auction at our church, I brought this. The final bid was over $200! Nothing else at the auction went over $50. I follow the advice of another reviewer and use ginger snaps for the crust-14 oz, with half cup butter, and same as called for sugar. The flavor of the gingersnap crust really amps up the flavor of the cheesecake. I also added a full can of pumpkin, I didn’t have mace. I add an extra quarter tsp of ginger, and an extra quarter tsp of cinnamon. I also up the pumpkin content to one heaping cup, omit the lemon extract, and increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. When the cheesecake is finished cooking I turn off the oven and leave the door closed for at least an hour, then I cracked the door and wait till the cheesecake is at room temperature and then put it into the fridge. Per another reviewer I top with 1/2 cube cream cheese “4 ounces”, beat together with 1/3 cup powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon until light and fluffy. I spread this on top. And then I serve with the warm butterscotch caramel drizzled over the top. This recipe gets requested everything’s giving Christmas and for birthdays all year long. Highly addicting. This cheesecake recipe is a favorite of my family’s, and every event I take it to I get requests for the recipe.

Delicious. Followed directions except replaced mace with 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice. Made minis - one cookie scoop per metal foil tin liner with water bath placed below at 325 degrees for exactly 20 minutes. Really important to make ahead as the flavors blend into pure yuminess. The lemon was too strong on first day. Freezes well without topping.

My favourite holiday cheesecake. I take it up a few notches and roast my own pumpkin and use it. I also make my own ginger snap cookies. I’m not going to lie, It is a lot of work! But it is oh so worth it! I also top it off with sour cream and sugar for the last 10 minutes of baking. The sour cream topping makes it look amazing when you cut into it.

My daughter is allergic to Pecans so I ground up gingersnaps in place of pecans for the crust. 1/2 cup to 1/2 cup. Worked perfect. This recipe is moist, and spiced just right. A keeper. Only other change for me was to bake in a water bath...not because regular baking as this recipe calls for does not work out well. It's just my preference to bake cheesecake in a shallow water bath because by doing so, I never have any cracking and they are always moist.

By far one of the best cheesecakes I have EVER had. I would recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to impress their friends and family. I put a small dish of water into the oven under the cake while it was cooking to keep it moist. It still cracked it was extremely creamy and rich! I used pumpkin spice instead of the spices they called for.

Great as is! But once I had to substitute butternut squash for the pumpkin and it still turned out just as good. I've made this multiple times and it's always a hit.

My husband and I were just finishing this up and he noted, this is definitely a make it again recipe.   It was very, very good.  I did make a change to the crust.  I had gingersnap cookies that I wanted to use up so I made a gingersnap crust instead without pecans.  I also substituted nutmeg for the mace because I do not have mace in the house.   I served it with top your own cheesecake with caramel, pecans and whipped cream.

incredible, everyone loved it!  didn't have any pecans so just did an ordinary graham cracker crust.  baked in a water bath & let sit for an hour after i turned the oven off.  served with whipped cream.  i will definitely make this again, and would like to try the gingersnap crust next time as others suggested.

I think this recipe was really good however I did tweak it just a little. I added a little more pumpkin filling to the pumpkin mix. Using a pan of water underneath worked great allowing it to rest for an additional hour in the oven after cooking with the door propped open also worked great glad I read some of the reviews!

I've been making this for Thanksgiving for about seven years and it's still sought after around the dinner table. The reviewers that suggest a water bath are spot on. My cheesecakes turn out much better now that I've been doing that. Also, I make 1/2 again as much of the graham cracker crust. I don't feel like this recipe gives you enough to form the side walls. To all those people that complain about the butter making the crust soggy, I'd suggest pouring the butter slowly while mixing. In the beginning I used to just poor the butter in and it really saturated a portion of the crust, leaving it pretty soggy. After cooking for 50 minutes I turn the oven off and leave my cheesecake in there. I restaurantuer suggested I do this, leaving it over night, and I like the end results. Between this and the water bath my cheesecake has become fluffier and more even.

This is a good recipe, however I used a confection oven and it cooked in about 35 minutes instead of 50 as it asked for.  I also noticed it came out a little flat, probably do to the confection oven. The flavor is spot on and the pumpkin is in no way overwhelming the dish.  And I used crushed walnuts in the crust instead of the pecans. Perfect choice for T-Day.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit!  This was my first cheesecake, and I was surprised how well it turned out.  I brought the cream cheese and eggs to room temperature before mixing.  I used a 10 inch springform pan, and made only the following adjustments to the recipe: I left out the lemon juice, increased the vanilla, used nutmeg instead of mace, and added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I placed a shallow baking dish of water on a rack below the cake.  After 50 min., I removed the cake from the oven, used a thin, sharp knife to  separate the sides of the cake from the pan, and let it cool on a rack on the counter.  Once it was cooled, I put the cake in the fridge overnight to chill.  The next day, I carefully removed the cake from the pan, sliding a knife beneath the cake to separate it from the bottom of the pan, and managed to slide it onto a serving plate.  I lined the top border with pecans, just like the picture, and made the maple glaze mentioned in previous reviews, also chilling that.  Just before serving, I poured the glaze over the top.  The color of the glaze almost reminded me of gravy (which sounds gross), but it was the perfect topping!  I got rave reviews, even from the uncle who rarely compliments people.

I have made this multiple times and absolutely love it! It turns out every time! A couple of adjustments (just small ones) that I make are 1) I use gingersnaps for the crust and 2) I bake it with a water bath.

I decided this would be perfect to try for my bible study group's "homemade pumpkin treat exchange," and it was perfect! I decided to make cupcake-sized cheesecakes for easy exchange. I reduced baking time to 30 minutes, and that was perfect. The one disappointment in doing that is that it increases the percentage of surface area, which is my least favorite part of a cheesecake, but they were still really good. I had to make a little extra crust mix (less than an extra half batch), but I was able to make 24 cupcake-sized cheesecakes and had enough extra to make 8 mini muffin sized ones (they were slightly over cooked at about 28 minutes of baking.

Fantastic! I was so impressed by the flavor. Like another reviewer suggested, I added a sour cream/sugar/vanilla topping to give it the double-layered look. I also garnished it by lightly sprinkling a brown sugar/cinnamon mixture over the top. If I had leftover pecans I would have topped it with those, but I was short on them. :( But as written, it was visually beautiful and delicious!

I followed suggestion and put 13x9inch pan with water  in it under cheescake while baking. Terrible result, cake too soft, (too soft cream pie) texture.  Not enough pumpkin or spice flavor.

I make a lot of cheese cakes and this one was I think my best one yet. It was a hit! It turned out fine with eliminating the whipping cream, as I was out. Instead of mace, I used 1/4 tsp Cloves along with the other spices. Based on others suggestions I made a gingersnap crust, which people loved. Lastly, I cooked it in a water bath. Turned out perfect. I think I might make another one of these soon.

I used this recipe as my first time to make cheesecake.  Our family thought it was delicious.  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  However, I did bake the crust before putting in the cheesecake mixture which is not stated in the directions. I did experience some cracking upon cooling but that was my inexperience with making cheesecake.  I pinched the cracks together and the caramel sauce topping covered everything else!

Have made this cheesecake many times and even non-pumpkin/non-cheesecake people love it.
QUESTION:  I want to try the Maple Glaze this year.  Do you add the glaze at serving or when the cheesecake is warm from the oven?  Thank You for help and all the times we' e enjoyed this recipe!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was a huge hit!  The only change I made was to use allspice instead of mace. Don't be daunted by the list of ingredients.  The cheesecake is easy to put together and it baked up beautifully.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This cheesecake was awesome! Although it does have a heavy load of ingredients, it's definitely worth the time you put into making it! It has everything you'd love in an autumn dessert and more! It's very light, and the flavors combine to make for a very rich dessert. I will be making this more often for our holiday family gatherings, and you should, too!

This cheesecake is delicious!!  I made it for Thanksgiving in place of pumpkin pie.  I made the pecan glaze someone recommended.  My husband, who doesn't like pumpkin nor cheesecake normally, said it was the best cheesecake that he ever had.  He also requested I make it for Christmas dessert too.  This will most likely become a regular holiday dessert in our home.

I made two of these today in preparation for Thanksgiving. The first one I went by the book on the first cheesecake. It didn't rise the way I had expected but with the addition of pumpkin I don't think it's possible to get it as fluffy as my usual cheesecake. The second cheesecake I used 1/4 cup flour instead of starch. Also the original recipe is a little two sweet so I only put 1/4 cup and 1 tbl. spoon instead of two into the cheesecake batter. This kept the balance of flavors in check and thickened up the batter nicely. It raised a little bit better and didn't shrink half as much when it cooled. Also only cook it 40 minutes. The pumpkin thins out the batter so you don't want to cook it the full 50 minutes. Give it a small shake, you'll know when it's ready. Hope this helps ;)

My daughter and I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! Kind of felt bad ... No one touched the other two pies brought by the other guests! I didn't change any of the ingredients. I baked it in a water bath for 50 minutes, switched the oven off and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 2 hours, covered it, and refrigerated it over night. I made a praline topping (3/4 cup maple syrup, 1 cup whipping cream and toasted chopped pecans), dalloped whip cream around the edge with a toasted whole pecan on each dallop. With or without all the fancy toppings, its a keeper!

I followed the recipe except only used 1/2 the amount of lemon extract.  I made the maple glaze as others did, but added some cornstarch to stiffen the sauce to a sort of glaze.  Very good.

This recipe is tasty-but the cake is too short!  I like a cheesecake that is double this height.  Pouring the batter in I was worried it wouldn't be enough but I let it bake anyway.  Getting it out of the pan I was disappointed.  Personally, I don't understand why we only used the egg yolks.  Perhaps if I had added the whole 3 eggs I wouldn't have this problem.  And yes, I used 9" springform pan.  I have made many cheesecakes and always use about the same amount of cream cheese but have never omitted the egg whites like this recipe directs.  The bottom line is: a taller, thicker cheesecake is prettier.  Other than that it was good; no cracks and nice pumpkin flavor.

Awsome recipe. Accidentally got fat free cream cheese and wasn't sure how it would turn out...was so pleased it came out amazing! I increased the cornstarch amount by about a teaspoon and only baked for about 45 to 50 min. But I also used a 10 inch springform pan. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I did substitute nutmeg for the mace simply because that's what I had on hand  and omitted the lemon extract because I didn't have it. I loved the pecan bits in the crust, it gave it that extra oomph. I think I'm going to have to start doing that with all my graham cracker crusts from now on. I would actually double the amount of crust next time so that it goes all the way up the sides of the pan (I'm a crust lover). I did bake the cheesecake with a pan of water underneath it but, still got a crack in the middle once it cooled off. So, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and made that maple pecan glaze to go on top. All I had was sugar free maple syrup and it still came out really good. It was a great accompaniment to the pumpkin cheesecake. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks Cathy! :)

This was awesome! I made it for Christmas dessert instead of pumpkin pie and everyone loved it!  I followed what some people said about doing 1.5X the crust, and I would highly recommend that.  I also couldn't find mace so I just used nutmeg instead.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This was delicious!  Since I don't have a springform pan (yet), it was put into two 8-inch pie pans, and cooked for 30 minutes.  It also turns out I only had two packages of cream cheese...after tasting the batter, it was still fantastic!  Good thing I made two...I ate half of one!

I LOVED this cheesecake! I made a crust out of gingersnaps and walnuts...yummy! The cheesecake looked beautiful and was so rich and creamy. This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, but I am now confidant to make more. I did not incorporate a water bath,as others have, and it turned out fabulous!

This was an excellent cheesecake. My friend, the cheesecake connoisseur, thought this was one of the best I had made for her. I would however, recommend putting the cheesecake pan in a hot water bath while baking to prevent the top from cracking.

I had a happy accident while making this outstanding cheesecake.  I had macadamia nuts not pecans like I thought.  I used 1 cup macadamia nuts and the crust was to die for.  I'm sure the pecans are wonderful too!  This recipe is fantastic!

Good flavor not sweet enough for me. Next time I'll add more sugar.  Overall it is a good recipe.  The spices were delightful. The smooth consistency was a treat.

We loved this recipe. We did a few minor adjustments to make it extra yummy for us. We used ginersnaps instead of graham cracker crumbs, toasted our pecans and added a little cinnamon to the crust. We also added just a smidge of brown sugar to the filling. (shout out to Abby good call) Super yummy and will def. make again.

I've made this cheesecake twice... absolutely out of this world good!  Nothing but great reviews from friends and family.  I used gluten free graham crackers in the crustI left pie in the oven 2 hours after it had baked... once pie had cooled I used the maple pecan glaze from the recipe "Maple Pumpkin Cheesecake", however, I omitted the pecans b/c I had placed pecans on top of the cheesecake prior to baking..  I only made half of the glaze and drizzled it over the cheesecake.  This has become my favorite fall dessert and I can't wait to make it again!

I have made this a couple of times now.  The first time I used the original recipe and it was delicious.  I just tweaked it after that to my liking.  I add extra spices and extra pumpkin.  Also I used the crust recipe from the autumn cheesecake, it seemed to turn out a little better.  Wonderful desert and it my dad requests me to make it for all of his staff functions.

This was really delicious! I had to add a cup of sour cream though, I didn't want it to be overwhelmingly sweet. I wanted my guests to taste the spices and sweetness in the cheesecake. They loved it. I am permanently booked for every thankgiving.

Great Pie. Everyone loved it on Thanksgiving day. I was rushed for time so I bought a pre-made crust and sprinkled pecans on the bottom. Had some of the filling left and used some mini pie crust left over from a previous dish made and baked 8 of them 12-04-08. They where just as good as the whole pie. Will use this recipe a lot.

I followed this recipe pretty exact. Except used nutmeg instead of mace and I also cooked with 2 pans of water on the rack below the cheesecake and it didn't crack and tasted great! Liked the pecans in graham cracker crust, nice touch. Also I did put the maple glaze on half the cheesecake and I thought it was great that way. My husband preferred it w/out the glaze.

Excellent! Family loved it.  I have to make another one tomorrow for another family member. For the pumpkin mixture I used a little more than 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice, 1/2 of cinnamon and a just a little nutmeg for added taste. In the cream cheese mixture I used real lemon juice and little more than 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. For the crust I used 1/2 ginger snap and graham cracker. The next time I will take the advice of another member and set the crust for 10 minutes, because I thought it was a little wet or soft. That could be from the water bath. I'm not sure. Finally,after pouring the batter in the pan I dropped the pan several times onto the counter.  After placing the batter in the pan and before placing it into the water bath, I heavily wrapped the springform pan in foil. However, next time, I will try the longer foil paper because a small amount of water leaked through.   The pie came out smooth as a baby's bottom not a crack in site.  Love it! Thank you!

Holy cow - I mis-read the recipe and almost added too much pumpkin... but it still turned out spectacular.  I made the crust out of ginger snaps and it was perfect.

I used Nila wafers to make the crust instead of graham crackers and I also skipped the nuts.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  The only thing I would do differently is to let the cheesecake cool in the oven to prevent from sinking in the middle

This was my first time making a cheesecake and this recipe is exceptional! I made it for a work party and everyone gave me rave reviews - even people who do not like pumpkin. I substituted almond extract for the lemon and used 1c of pumpkin instead of 3/4c. I tried the water bath and found that some of the water ended up inside my foil - I think due to condensation as the foil only went halfway up the side of my pan. I was concerned about this, but the crust ended up being moist and amazing. I am making this again in two days!

I made this for my potluck at work and it disappeared in a few minutes. Several people requested recipe. It is a lot of work but well worthy. I did make gingersnap cookie crust from other pumpkin cheesecake rec from this site, but followed everything else to the T. I am making this again for our Thanksgiving. Thank you.

Absolutely incredible!!! I didn't have cornstarch so I used 2 tbsp flour instead. Served this for my candle party tonight and even friends who don't like pumpkin and those who don't like cheesecake loved this recipe!!!

really really good.  My only problem was it didn't set in the middle when I cooked it according to the directions.  It needed a bit longer, but I was so worried about it cracking.  I did add more pumpkin based on reviews and that may have affected the cooking time.  It was wonderful regardless and everyone ate it all up.  It was really good next to my grandma's pecan pie but so rich!!  Will make again and again!

Made this the 1st time for a holiday party at my mother-in-laws, and it was a big hit. I deleted the lemon extract, and used the maple pecan glaze from the other recipe. I will definitely make it again. I think I prefer this to regular pumpkin pie. I had no problem with the top splitting.

Knock your socks off good! Usually I tweak a recipe, but the only thing I changed on this one was increasing the vanilla extract to 1 tsp. (I love vanilla). Wow!!! This tastes like something from a restaurant. I overbaked it, since I was more worried about underbaking it, but the cracked top is easily disguised with the delicious maple cream sauce that others have recommended (I used sliced almonds, since that's what I had). It's absolutely amazing!!

Very good recipe. I didn't bother making the crust since I wanted to save time so I just used store bought graham crust. Also, for the spices I used pumpkin spice (2.5 tsp). I made the mistake of doubling this recipe because it actually makes 2 pies, so in the end I had 4. Made these for thanksgiving plus the Eagle Brand Recipe for pumpkin pie, and although this pie was delicious, my family's favorite (and mine) was the Eagle.

This is the perfect cheesecake. I made two small changes...the first being to use pumpkin pie spice instead of mace and lemon juice instead of lemon extract (the amounts remained the same), but it was only because I was missing those ingredients at the time.  I had no problems with the top cracking, but it might have been because I used the recipe to make two shallow cakes that I cooked for 45 minutes and then let cool in the oven with the door open. I teamed it with the Pecan Nut Crust recipe on this site, and it was lovely.

I served this at Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I did everything but add the lemon extract (because I didn't have any). I served it with the maple pecan glaze listed in other reviews. It was even better two days after baking it.
I do think the crust was a little sweet, so I would cut the sugar in the crust (or omit altogether, the graham crackers are sweet enough).

Absolutely delicious!! Everyone was raving about it at thanksgiving dinner!  The only thing I did different was add cloves and nutmeg in place of mace (since I didnt have any).  I cooked for 1 hour in a water bath then turned the oven off and let cool in the oven for another hour, then let cool on the counter for another hour and then into the fridge it went.  No cracks, no sinking, just a beautiful cheesecake :)
I made some cinnamon whipped cream for the top- I highly recommend some sort of whipped cream since it really complements the flavor of the cake well and helps to cut a little of the sweetness.

Would give it more if I could.  Best recipe i've gotten from this site.  I didn't have lemon extract, but it was wonderful without.   Made for Thanksgiving and my brothers were fighting over leftovers.  They want this at Christmas again and next Thanksgiving- a new tradition.

Mmmm! This was my first attempt at making cheesecake, and i made it for our Family Thanksgiving meal. I got nothing but RAVE REVIEWS! Absolutely delicious, don't change a thing! I did use the maple-pecan glaze other users recommended, which totally enhanced the flavor, so THANKS! I would definitely make it again...

very good, but I thought the lemon flavor was too much; I like lemon flavor a lot in most things, but here I think it distracts from the pumpkin and cream cheese flavors; if I make it again, I will either leave out lemon extract completely or add just a drop or two

This was excellent !!!  Since I did not have mace on hand, I used 2 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed and did use 1 cup of pumpkin as suggested by others. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Mine did crack on top after being out of the oven for awhile but not to worry, I mixed two cups of sour cream, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla spread it on top of the cheesecake and returned to a 350 degree oven for five minutes. Took it to a party and recieved rave reviews on it.  Will certainly make this light creamy cheesecake again.

As per other reviewers suggestions, I added 1/4 cup more pumpkin since everyone here loves pumpkin pie. Mine did crack though so I made the pecan glaze as suggested. It turned out very well-everyone gobbled it up w/o ever knowing it cracked! :)

This recipe can look very scary, but it is pretty easy.  The crust is unbelieveable!!  I sent it with my husband to work and now I am sending copies of the recipe.  Even one of the guys made it.  The maple pecan glaze tops it off.  Be sure to leave the cake in the refrigerator for 24hrs so that it will set well.

It was my husband's first cheesecake made on his own, and it went swimmingly (so anybody can do it).  He added all of the egg (instead of separating) and it still turned out perfectly.  It's not too pumpkiny (I bumped it up to 1 cup of pumpkin even), but enough to get the flavour.  Certainly not too spiced (I had him use 2 Tbs pumpkin pie spice instead of the suggested spices).  We couldn't use nuts because of allergies, but I'm sure they would add to the flavour.  Everybody liked it--will make again.

This turned out very well.  Mine was a little lumpy so make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as you're mixing.  Wish it had just a little more pumpkin flavor.  Nonetheless it was a hit.

This was great!  I didn't have any whipping cream so I just added a little more pumpkin puree.  I also forgot to add the whole egg, but all in all, the cheesecake came out great.  I wish I had added more spices, but it's still good.  I baked it at about 300-325 F degrees for an hour.  It came out a little dense but de-lish!

Another Thanksgiving hit!  I tried this with the Ginger Snap crust like someone suggested and it actually burnt.  Stick to the grahm craker crust!  Other than that, it was fabulous.  It really wasn't that hard or time consuming to make.  I used fat free Cream cheese and the splenda sugars.  Tasted Fantastic.

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner as a change of pace from pumpkin pie.  It got raves from everyone who tried it, even my mom-in-law who doesn't like pumpkin pie! Definitely one to make again.

My family thought this recipe was very good, especially the crust!!  The pumkin flavor of the cheesecake was mild, so my sister-in-law, who is not crazy about pumpkin pie, loved it!  Will definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe.  I used light cream cheese and butter and it was still excellent.  Loved the way the ingredients were put in order of use.

not bad, not great, something a bit "off" on the taste, but would try it again.

I am not a cook, but this recipe made me look like one. There are a lot of ingredients, but the local market had everything. I followed the instructions, and it turned out perfectly. Everyone expects this now at our Thanksgiving and Christmas tables.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made.  My family loved it.  My daughter-in-law said her sister is one of the best cheesecake bakers she knows and I was nervous for her to taste mine.  But she said it was better than the pumpkin one her sister made.  I will definitely make it again and will try others, too.

This recipe was delicious and my boyfriend does not like pumpkin but he loved it because it only had a hint of pumpkin.  I used almonds instead of the pecans as that is what I had at home and it was great.

This was really good.  Had good pumpkin flavor, very creamy, and flavorful crusty.  I also used the sour cream topping from the "Libby's Pumpkin Cheesecake" recipe.  I used lite cream cheese and sour cream and added a little extra pumpkin too.  Next time I might bake the crust for a few minutes because it seemed too buttery.  My girlfriends loved this and several asked for the recipe.

This cheesecake was a hit.  I served it at bunco night and all the ladies could not believe I made it.
