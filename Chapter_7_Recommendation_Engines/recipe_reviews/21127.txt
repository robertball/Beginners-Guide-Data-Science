I'm giving this 4 stars because I felt that I had to change so much of it after reading many other reviews. However, I think I have got some really great alterations. 
Fill the bottom of the pan with enough water to cover, mix in about a Tbsp. of cornstarch, a tsp. and a half of vanilla, and a small handful of chopped nuts. (Almonds, walnuts, or pecans.)
Core apples all the way through (I used Jonathan apples) and peel a thin ring of skin off around the middle of each apple so they can "breathe". Stuff apples with the brown sugar and butter premixed, and place apples in water mixture. Sprinkle apples and water with nutmeg and a generous (but not overpowering) amount of cinnamon. 
Bake at 350 for 20 min. covered with foil and then for another 10 min. uncovered. 
Finally, serve in bowl with the caramel/nut sauce around base of each apple. Vanilla ice cream in the center drizzled with caramel ice cream topping is another incredible addition to them.
I hope this helps but after these alterations, the recipe was to die for. Seriously, just skip to these suggestions and you'll have the perfect recipe. I'm not usually this confident, but with this, I can't help it!

I love making these. I was in a hurry, so I just popped ours in the microwave for about 5 minutes and I also added raisins. They turned out so good, and the smell alone is enough to make your mouth water.

Great baked apples!  Very simple and delicious.  Some people mentioned having to put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan, I used apple juice.  I also had to bake them longer.  These are WONDERFUL topped with a dollup of creme fraiche!  A great end to a fall meal.

My family loved these baked apples.  We also prefer them on the soft side, so I baked them for 30+ minutes.  I cut down on the butter and sugar and still found them delicious.   What a nice, simple, wholesome dessert!

I do these German style, called "Bratapfel": stuff the apples with walnuts (or other nuts), candied ginger, honey, a bit of lemon juice, orange peel, cinnamon and a tiny bit of rum (if you like). Then bake them for 30 to 40 minutes.

I only gave this recipe a three because after 15-20 minutes, the apples were still barely soft and I like mine kind of mushy which REALLY detracted from the potential of a baked apple.  

Also, after reading other people's suggestions to this recipe I used some of their hints; I microwaved the brown sugar & butter then put it in the apple centers & added water at the bottom of the pan which made a weird & very watery (not syrupy) concoction & raisins.  I'll definately try the recipe again but won't microwave the b. sugar & butter first & I'd bake it a lot longer. Will let you know how it turns out. :-)

Oh oh oh, also, I added 10+ raisins that had been soaked in the middle of the apple as well and those were yummy.

My family really enjoyed these apples. I aded some chopped pecans before baking for a little extra crunch. Next time I will cut down on the butter and add a little more cinnamon. Delicious!

Very good.  I added chopped pecans as someone else suggested, and used a white sugar-cinnamon mix.  Also found I needed to add some water to the pan.

This is a really good baked apple recipe.  It definitely takes more than 15 minutes to bake these.  (takes at least 30 minutes)  Covering foil helps cook faster.  Iv'e made this many times with great results.  The last time I made them, I sliced the apples and tossed with brown sugar, cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of flour.  Place in a baking dish, cover with foil and bake for approx. 30 to 45 minutes.  It's like apple pie without the crust.  Delicious!!

Me and my daughter loved these apples!!! Actually, she wanted to put 10 stars but we couldn't. We didn't use green apples but red ones, and we didn't use so much sugar, butter or cinnamon. We cooked them for 40 minutes and they came out perfectly yummy!  
Thank you for the recipe!!

Great Apples Like Mom Made.    I did make a few changes:  I used Rome apples (best for this type baking) I peeled a little peel away from top of apple, I poured parkay buttery spray(fat-free)over top letting a bit flow over outside and inside apple.  I put a spoonful of brown sugar into center, sprinkled with apple pie spice and then poured about a tablespoon of honey over each apple.  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Take out of over and using turkey baster pick up juice and pour over the apples filling the hole.  I baked for another 15 minutes and basted with juices again.  I put them into oven for the last 15 minutes and baste again when they came out of the oven.  The juice gets a bit thicker each time and when cooled...so keep basting.   They look pretty and taste GREAT.

Wonderful, with some changes...I peeled the top half of the apple, stuffed the apples with butter and a few raisins. Then I sprinkled each apple generously with cinnamon, brown sugar and chopped walnuts. And for the bottom of the dish I put 2 T water, 1 T pure vanilla extract, and 2 T Dark Rum. Not only were they delicous, but the house smelled heavenly.

So, so good, and so easy.  It made me wonder why it's been many years since I've made baked apples.  I didn't change a thing except to cook the Granny Smith apples for about 25 minutes until they were soft enough.  I used a melon baller to core the apples and that made it very easy.

This is a great recipe! I use Granny Smith apples (peeled & sliced) and after filling core I wrap apple with Filo dough before baking! Really tasty!

I loved these, only I did not mix the suger and butter I packed the suger into each apple then put a pat of butter on top and packed it in also, then put the cinnamon on and baked them for 30 mins.it's best to take the peelings off the apple first.

I used this recipe for just one apple. I didn't want to heat the oven for just one so I microwaved it for 5 minutes. It was delicious. I did add water to the bottom of the bowl so it wouldn't dry out too much.

I actually cored and chopped the apples into bite size pieces and added the ingredients over the top of the apples.  Also, I used Red Delicious because we do not prefer bitter apples.

Loved it! I used 2 gala apples and 2 golden delicious. They were both very good. I found it easier to melt the butter, mix it with the brown sugar and then stuff into the apples. I did add a small amount of water to the bottom of the pan as others suggested. Not sure if it helped or not. I would also recommend baking for 25-30 minutes. I served as a side dish to roasted chicken. It was great!

Great Recipe! I added a little nutmeg and walnuts, put apple juice in the bottom of the pan, and used braeburn apples. Yum! Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some carmel topping. ;)

Others are right--THE COOKING TIME MUST BE LONGER.  The "BC" cookbook, with a similar recipe, suggests 45 minutes at 375 degrees.  I followed the instructions of this recipe and the apples were nearly as firm as when the went in the oven.  The butter-brown sugar-cinnamon mix was good, though.

My grandma used to make these when I was a kid, and she used cooking apples. I haven't seen cooking apples here, so I used Granny Smiths. I made them according to the recipe, and while they tasted good, I prefered my grandma's method of preparation which was to just slice up the apples, put them in a baking dish, and top with the butter and sugar. We would have them with warm custard. Delicious!

My grandmother use to make these and I have searched for how to do it. This is right on! I microwaved them for 5-8 min like she did and added cinn & sugar mix as well she always used rasins but I am not a fan of them so I left them out.

I am not crazy about apples but this is a great recipe for baked apples. For Thanksgiving I made them.  Only I sliced the apples in 8 slices each and poured the the mixture over them.  They were great!

I make these by cutting the apples in half, creating a well where the core was, and using splenda plus cinnamon and butter, definitely need to be baked at 350 for 30 minutes though. This is a really good low cal dessert!

Me, my fiance, and our daughter (2yrs) adored these apples.  We followed the recipe exactly but next time I definitely know that pecans or something nutty would be a wonderful addition.  We served ours with vanilla ice cream and it was similar to apple pie a la mode just without the crust.

I'm currently eating one of these, and it's delicious!  I did end up baking it longer, however.  At 15 minutes, they were still pretty crunchy. So I put them back in the oven, and then turned the oven off and went to give the kids a bath and put them to bed. By the time I got back, the apples were still nice and hot, and perfectly cooked.  Also, I didn't end up measuring anything - I just packed the brown sugar down into the apples and put the butter on top. Next time I'll mix the butter and brown sugar together first. The directions were kind of vague regarding that part (I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be mixed or layered). I didn't read any reviews prior to making this recipe, so I didn't add any water in the pan, and they turned out fine.  I'm not sure what good it would do to add water.  I'll definitely make these again.  I might have to invest in an apple corer or melon baller - I ended up using my 1/2 tsp measuring spoon to scrape out the cores which took a while.

I always bake these with no butter. Just sugar, cinnamon, and allspice in the well. I cover the apple in tin foil. You're left with the juices from the apple brewing in the core with crispy bits of cinnamon sugar in the flesh of the apple. The best way to eat an apple in my opinion :) The worst part, is that you have to wait for these to cool before you can dig in. But always worth it!

Simple and tasty! My son loved them. We like our apples softer so the baking time was off for us. I baked the apples at 350 for 40 minutes.

This recipe worked out very well, and was delicious.  Instead of leaving the apples whole, I sliced them, tossed them with other ingredients.  That way it only took the 15 min cooking time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving these apples a 5 star rating because I love how simple it is to make them. There is no need to do fancy things to this recipe, it is amazing just the way it is. I did bake them a little longer because I like them a bit mushy and I only used less butter and sugar with a sweeter fuji apple because I am trying to diet, but if I wasn't I would totally make them this way! They are so good I think I am going to make them all winter!

Great recipe! I loved making these apples, so simple and delicious. Filled the whole house with the scent of homemade apple pie. Next time I will add walnuts and raisins...yum! Didn't need to add water btw, just baked in a pyrex dish for about 40 mins. and it was fine.

Family loved this! My Changes: I skined and sliced the apples. I mixed apple juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract and covered the bottom of the pan with it. I made 'Crumb Topping for Pies' recipe from this site and put it on top of the apples to give it texture. Baked it for 20 minutes and it was done. I think the slicing of the apples made a difference in the bake. This taste just like apple crisp with the topping on it. I will be making this again.

This was really delicious. I made cinnamon sugar to fill the apple. Also I used an apple called a "Grapel" which is supposed to be the texture of an apple but taste like a grape. It was really just a sweeter apple. When I baked this I sprinkled the bottom of the glass dish with cinnamon sugar, added water to cover the bottom and then put a couple pats of butter beneath the apples in addition to the butter in the apple. It came out great. Next time I think that I will use some crushed walnuts, almonds, or pecans as well. Thanks so much for the recipe. Easy to make, wonderfully fragrant and exquisitely delicious.

I baked a bit longer than the 15 minutes yet the apple was only baked half way.  I used green Granny Smith apples as suggested - these were just to tart at the bottom.  I made these in Camp Fire Girls with brown sugar, peanut butter, raisins & butter - I'll stick to my recipe.

I baked my apples for 30 minutes, and they were still hard.  Even though the skins were falling off and apple was spewing out the top of the apple.  Tasted just mediocre.  I would not make this again.  My husband was not disappointed to hear that, and he always enjoys everything I make.

This recipe brought back memories of baked apples simmering on my grandmother's stove. That smell was so comforting and sent such a wonderful  aroma throughout the kitchen. Not only were they good back then but this recipe proved just as tasty. I think the slow cooking on the stove was the key to the aroma filling the kitchen, which the short time cook in the microwave couldn't duplicate. However, the taste was great and brought back many memories. It was easy and quick. I did add the chopped walnuts and thought that was a great suggestion and cooked one Fuji apple in a covered container for 4 minutes and it turned out perfect.

My boyfriend loves apples in any form, and he really enjoyed this recipe.  I used two very large Fuji apples for this recipe (which cored easily), and poked holes all through the apple with a sharp knife before filling them with the butter and sugar mixture.  I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top.  I had to adjust the baking time to 45 minutes due to the size of the apples, but they turned out wonderfully as-is.  Next time I might use a little less butter, and hopefully I'll have some vanilla ice cream on hand :)

I had to cook them 30 minutes (not 15), and like someone previously stated: the dish doesn't look pretty when done, but the flavor was REALLY good.  I had added water to the bottom of the dish, and that helped "soften" the skins.  I think I will make these again, but next time I'll actually cut the apples in half, then make a well in the center to fill with the sugar/butter mix...

The flavor was great, but they definitely needed to cook longer. I'd say at least an hour or more. I like my apples to where they cut with a fork/spoon. I needed a knife for these.  I'll make them again, and let them bake for about 85mins.

These were very good, but I think if I try them again I'll add more things to it like maybe some caramel or some oats and I'd cook it a little longer.  15mins didn't soften them up as much as I would have liked.

Used Honey Crisp apples, lots of cinnamon, raisins, and baked for 45 minutes; covered for the last 15. I also added a little water to the pan and gave the apples a light basting halfway through.

Filling didn't stay in the apple and it felt like something was missing.  Next time I'll make a caramel sauce to top it with or use some oats in the filling.

I thought the bake time was perfect, but they were on the firm side (just like I like them). I also tried these with granola and they were delicious. They could have used a little more moisture like water or apple juice.

This is a good basic recipe for baked apples. I did a few things differently that worked out well.

1. I mixed melted soy butter with the brown sugar and 1/4 tsp. vanilla flavoring in a bowl before putting into apples. (I ended up using half of what the recipe called for---MUCH healthier)

2. I added a tsp. of apples and cinnamon oatmeal into the apple cut out before putting in the butter/sugar mixture. The oatmeal added some umph to the baked apple.

3. I sprayed down a cupcake tin with non-stick spray and baked the apples in there so I didn't have to worry about them falling over.

4. EAT. MMMMMMMMMM

Thank you for the basic recipe, it inspired me!

I had to alter my recipe, instead of brown sugar I used Sugar in the Raw and pumpkin pie spice and added some cinnamon (since it's cheaper) but I didn't have Nutmeg which is why I used the other spice. The water in the bottom of the pan was a great idea since I drizzled that liquid on top of the apples after they were done. Very good!

just okay - the butter separated out and made it taste sortof greasy, and 15 minutes was not nearly enough baking time... i added some fresh nutmeg for more of an 'apple pie' flavour.

I used this recipe as a spingboard. I substituted oil for the butter, and cut the quantity in half, and I added dark raisins and ground walnuts to the filling. Then, I baked it for forty minutes. With the changes, it make a simple, tasty dessert.

This was easy and tasted good.  I did have some trouble serving it to my two young children (maybe I didn't hollow out the apples enough??).  Like some of the others said, I would rather just cut up the apples before baking--not as pretty, but easier to eat!

I like this recipe alot, but did change a few things.  I softened the butter, stirred it up w/ brown sugar and sultanas (raisins).  Then cored the apples all the way through and stuffed them w/ the mixture.  Wrapped each one up seperately w/ aluminum foil to keep it from running.  Did have to cook it a bit longer (about 25 mins total), but w/ them wrapped in foil, they were much softer than normal - which is how I like them :)  My hubby *loves* it w/ vanilla ice cream and its a fun dish for my daughter to help with.

This is so easy and quick!  My oven did cook the apples very fast so 15 to 20 minutes would do it for my apples.  I would use this recipe with any type of apple, not just granny.  This is really great with icecream.

I had never had baked apples before, these were delicious!!  I used Granny Smith
apples.  I had to use unsalted butter (boyfriend did the grocery shopping and it was th
cheapest!).  The little kid didn't have them, he's kind of picky, but the "big kid" 
(my boyfriend) tried some and loved it (another picky eater).

Made these this evening & everyone loved them.  The only thing I changed was reducing the amount of butter to closer to a tsp per apple.  I mixed the brown sugar & butter before filling the apples, added a small amount of water to the bottom of the pan & baked approximately 25 minutes (6 apples).  Absolutely delicious!

This recipe is very similar to how my mother used to make it! I used Granny Smith apples and the ingredients as written. I did however add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time because I like a softer apple. A great treat is pouring cream in the bottom of the bowl when serving. I read other reviews about coring all the way through and I must disagree as this steams from the outside instead of cooking from the inside and provides a different texture than I was looking for at least. I will definitely make this again!

This is a good and easy dessert recipe. I had added a splash of lemon juice to each apple to add little balance. To make it more fun, each apple was stuffed with raisins and sprinkled with a little nutmeg. Delicious!  
Also, keeping the skin on the apples really helps seal in those juices.

Not really feeling this recipe too much. For one definitely has the wrong cooking times and for two it was kind of boring I even added cloves and nutmeg and still it needed more.

I didn't like this much.  I had some extra green apples so I tried making this.  However, I don't know if I can rate this fairly b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I cut the apples in half and put slits in them, then sprinkled the butter, brown sugar, and cinammon on top.  It wasn't bad but I won't be making it again.  I don't even want to eat the leftovers.  I don't think the cook time was nearly enough...my apples were still a bit raw after 20 minutes.

I liked this recipe, it was easy to make different variations. My boyfriend likes more cinnamon, so I added that additional cinnamon to the brown sugar reduction and poured it over the apples. He enjoyed them.

This was a great and super easy recipe.  Instead of using whole apples, I cut mine and cooked it a little longer so the apples were softer.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe and thought it was delicious.  Great with a dollop of cool whip.

Love baked apples - these need to cook  a little longer.   My favourite filling is mincemeat (even if it isn't Xmas).  No extra sugar or butter added.

This was an easy and delicious recipe!  I might suggest cooking it longer because I like my baked apples just a little softer, but despite that it was fantastic.

This was great. We made a few changes. We sliced the apples in half and then cored them with a melon baller. We buttered the pan, but we're not sure if we needed to. We used red Braeburn apples, and we cooked it for 40 minutes. It was really good that way.

Took about 20 minutes to cook though. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and let the apples stand in light rum.

I grew up eating baked apples  .  My grandmother and mother always made them.  Similar but different.  You can cut the core right through them bottom.  Pack brown sugar very tightly into the apple.  Then stuff the apple with raisins.  Add more brown sugar to the top quarter inch.  dot with a bit of butter.   Sprinkle with cinnamon.  Place in a greased  ovenproof dish.  Depending on the type of apple, I find they usually take half an hour at 350 F.   You can add about a quarter inch of water in the dish., which will make a delicious sauce to dish over the apple.  Great with a bit of vanilla ice cream.  I always make more than I need as they make marvelous leftovers if I can  hide them well enough in the refrigerator.   This version is a 10 star recipe.

I loved these. Being sugar conscience I substituted the brown sugar with Truvea brown sugar blend. Added chopped walnuts. Did as others suggested, added a little water on the bottom of baking dish, covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes. Perfect! Will do these many times through this fall season.

It was OK but doubt I'll make it again.  I used Gala apples and after 15 minutes they were hard as rocks. 30 minutes (or maybe 40)would be a better cooking time frame.

Had to cook apples for about 40 min, after 15 min I checked them and they were still hard. I used one of the tips from the reviews and covered them with aluminum foil.  I used red apples because that's what I had.  I followed the ingredients as written, I did add some chopped pecans and a little water in the pan. Served the apples with vanilla ice cream and drizzled the water,pecan,brown sugar cinnamon syrup over it. They are a perfect fall treat.

Actually wound up here because I was double-checking my memory of how my mom taught me to bake them about 30 years ago. I wasn't sure of the oven temp or time in so I landed here. Pretty close to the same recipe except I use regular sugar, no cinnamon, a little bit of water in the bottom of my glass baking dish and then add a little bit of currant jelly in the "well" before serving. Mine did require more than 15 min. I used cold granny smiths and am at 25 minutes right now. They are just about done.

I love the apples! However, the butter had a layer on top of the sugar. Also, I decided to bake the apples at 375 for 30 minutes and baste the apples in a layer of water/brown sugar

Made it as written - although I had to double the cooking time in my oven so it would have a soft consistency - and my apples were delicious! I gobbled them right up and will definitely make this easy recipe again, thanks.

REALLY good - but agree with others - it needs to bake longer.  I used Courtland & baked for 40 minutes @ 350.

Okay, guys, be prepared! I have a long list of additions and substitutions for this recipe! It's a good traditional recipe that you can't go wrong with, but these additions make it a whole lot better! 1) Coat the bottom of your pan with a little bit of water, about 1 Tablespoon cornstarch, and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. 2) Core your apples all the way, and stick a prune in the bottom. (it may sound gross, but it's really healthy and tastes really good with the apple.) 3) push some chopped walnuts down the middle of your apples. 4) Mix the butter and the brown sugar together first, and then fill up the spaces in the middle of your apples and spread it on the sides. With all these corrections, this is my go-to recipe for apples.

Very yummy. I agree, you need to bake with foil covering for 25 minutes, then about 15 more minutes uncovered. I also put water, 2 tbs. wheat flour, vanilla, and chopped nuts in the bottom of the pan.

This was okay.  I liked it, but how can you go wrong with apples, butter, sugar, and cinnamon?  I followed the suggestions of Melatkin and also added some bits of apple from the core and skin to the sauce.  The sauce turned out amazing, but the apples were just okay.  They stayed pretty hard.  I'm not sure why, I cooked them for 40min.  Maybe it was the type of apples I used (Braeburn).  The vanilla and lots of cinammon was the key.

Great! I did slice/core the apples before cooking but that was the only change I made. Topped with a spoonful of whipped cream! Whole family loved it!

It was good but i changed alot... i used brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice as the filling. filled it half way put a small amount of butter inside then packed it the rest of the way. I then put a bit of butter on the top. For the pan i put in orange/pineapple juice with vanilla,little butter and a tbls of cornstarch to help it thicken...they turned out GREAT!!  I also cut an inch of skin off around the entire apple...i did half cored all the way through and half not cored completely and they both tasted great.

The apples were still very crunchy after 15 minutes in the oven. I needed to put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes to get the desired effect of a baked apple. Otherwise, they didi taste very good!!!

I took the other suggestions listed and put water in the bottom along with the part of the apples I cored out. It took 45" with foil over them to cook. I added pecans and raisins. There isn't enough filling for 4 apples, just 3. It isn't a pretty dish, but tastes really good!

Very good, although I did have to adjust baking time.  Next time I will use a little more brown sugar.  I also poured enough fresh apple cider to cover the bottom of the baking dish.  My husband was very pleased with them. Its a keeper.

Honestly, we thought these were better the next day out of the refrigerator. I used green apples and sliced them pretty thin. Just watch the baking time so you don’t end up with crunchy apples. Good recipe!

The recipe is very easy. The only thing I did change was to add 1/2 more of the ingredients and cooked it another 15 minutes. I also covered the apples for the first 15 minutes. The family enjoyed the treat.

I am ordinarily a great cook but the brown sugar and butter didn't carmelize right for me.  The recipe is quick, easy and has basic ingredients.  If you try them, I hope they turn out better for you.

The apples need to be baked for about 45 minutes.  I think the 15 minutes in the recipe is a mistake.  They were good (after 45 minutes!)... a good basic recipe that you can add other ingredients such as nuts and dried fruits or liquor.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and cooked them in water with vanilla. They were tasty by themselves but very delicious with caramel sauce and ice cream. If you want a somewhat healthy dessert you can eliminate the caramel sauce and ice cream and it is still a very good dessert and easy to make. I will definitely make this again!

I would cook them longer, maybe as much as 30 minutes total, because I like the apples to be very soft. Other than that it was a fast and easy recipe.

I made with red and green apple. Don’t use red ones bc it will melt too much. Green has sour taste and it’s not too sweet. It’s so easy to make and perfect for winter dessert!

I made it with sweet red apples and dairy free butter.  Missed the part about not cutting it all the way to the bottom, so most of the good stuff was at the bottom of the pan.  I didn't test the apples before I pulled them out of the oven and they were still pretty firm after 15 minutes.  Definitely need more time.

I already memorized this recipe because of how simple it is. I make it whenever and it is quite good. The only change I made was in topping but that was personal choice anyway. I melted hershey's kiss and put it on. A great recipe.

I thought the time was a misprint or error. It took  30 minutes @ 400 to cook these properly. Also, 1 pat of butter instead of a Tablespoon, was enough. I didn't measure the brown sugar, just packed in into the well which was fine. I baked them in a round cake pan which worked great. They were a hit!

Turned out great with some adjustments. I added some pecans, cut the butter to 1 teaspoon each apple, added water to pan with vanilla and cinnamon in it and cooked for at least an hour. My apples were big so maybe that's why they took so long but in no way would even a small apple be done in 15 minutes. That is why I've taken away one star.

These were pretty good with a couple modifications. 10 mins. wasn’t nearly long enough in the oven. I baked mine about a half hour to get the apples softer. I also add a few whole cranberries with the brown sugar and butter.

I made it with Pink Lady apples and extra creamy cool whip with a hot caramel drizzle . 20-25 minutes worked better IMO. Thanks for the idea, it was spur of the moment and went better than most things I plan...

They were delicious. They needed way more time but just added it.   I stuffed them with lots of dried fruit and nuts and poured some ginger ale over them and in the pan.

I was looking for a baked apple recipe and I came across this one. I looked at the reviews to get a feel of what others thought of this recipe and the latest comment that showed for me was one from 2005. I followed his/her suggestions and it turned out AMAZING!!! Basically preheat oven to 350 get your apples core them, peel a ring around the middle of the apples ( helps apples breathe) add water to the bottom of your pan, enough for it to be covered. Add 1 Tbsp of cornstarch and 1 and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, add a handful of chopped nuts ( walnuts, pecans, etc.) stir the mixture. Then add the apples to the pan; stuff them with 2 Tbsp of brown sugar and 1 Tbsp of butter, sprinkle the apples and water with nutmeg and cinnamon, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. After 20 mins. remove foil and then bake uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. Once done add vanilla ice cream on top of apples and then drizzle the caramel/nut sauce  at the base of apples on top. You then have an amazing baked apple dessert, ENJOY!!

My picky husband and two picky sons (ages 2 and 4) all gobbled it up. My husband said it tastes like apple pie.

It was tastey (depends on your apples) but a bit dry.  Next time I will add more water or juice to the bottom of the pan.  I also added a few chopped nuts.  I did bake for 30 minutes, could have gone even a bit more.

The apples TASTED great...but there is absolutely no way they were done in 15 minutes!  It took closer to 45 minutes for them to be done.  Additionally, I followed some other comments stating that it needed some moisture added.  I added a little bit of apple cider & covered the dish with foil halfway through...I think it would have cooked faster if it had been covered from the beginning.

Oh wow!! I tweeked this recipe a tad and it was still amazing. Super easy and tastes great!! I followed the recipe as written above and decided to add a bit of cream cheese mixed with vanilla extract so it was sweeter and it turned out awesome. I recommend putting water at the bottom of the pan and glad that I did. Just enough to lightly fill the bottom portion. Definitely can do so much with this and will make it for Christmas time again. ?

We used red apples because that is what was on hand.  Added water to the bottom of the dish as suggested in reviews.  It took longer to cook, but that is probably because of the apple variety.  Someone suggested peeling a ring half way down the apple so they "could breath".  We did this to 2 of them to see if it made a difference...it did, they were dry compared to the others so don't do it.  We will be making this again and may even try some of the other review ideas for a twist every now and then.

I used huge Jonagolds.  Took a while longer to bake but oh so worth it!!  Wish we had some whipped or ice cream to go with them.  

TIP:  If you don't have a corer and are using a paring knife, cut around the core as deep as you can go.  Then, cut cross wise around the circle, making 'pie wedges'.  Then dig these out.  Keep going until you can then shave around the hole to get a place for the butter and brown sugar.

we added raisins and I discovered that a melon baller tool worked great to cut and scoop out the core ! They were not done at 20 minutes... I used the turkey baster and added 20 more minutes  they smell wonderful !

Read review by Melatkin; prepair that way.  My husband wants the apples chopped up, but I prefer them in larger chunks.  This was delicious as a Sunday breakfast served with bagels and cream cheese.

This is a good, basic recipe that I made exactly as written. The cooking time is really off, these take a minimum of 30 minutes. Thanks LuCynda.

Make sure you do what Melatkin recommends in his/her review.  I did this, added some raisins also, and used Fuji apples.  Fabulous!

These were good, but not like I remember baked apples from my childhood.  I baked them for about 35 minutes (tested at 25, and still very firm), and they were still fairly firm.  My husband remarked that he could've used a knife!  I did put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan, but don't see how that could've thrown the baking time off by that much.  The apples I used (Jonah Golds) were not particularly big, so maybe they're just a more firm apple to begin with - the orchard did say this variety was good for baking.

Easy to make and taste great. I did find that it took much longer to bake though. The apples were a bit hard so I left them in longer and kept checking them.

covering with foil is a key to keeping these moist and making the cooking time really cook the apples!

I'm very excited to make these instead of apple pie for Christmas. I plan on adding pecans and nutmeg to the core butter mixture. Does anyone have any idea what might happen if the apples were soaked in apple cider beforehand? Would it help to make them more moist?

The amount of butter and brown sugar is too much for a cored tart apple, such as a Granny Smith. Such a cored apple has a pretty small opening and cannot take the amount of sugar and butter called for.

I am assuming that we want to retain as much flesh of the apple as possible. I am am an amateur here, but taking as little as necessary of the appple, I had to reduce what I could put into it  by quite a bit.

Of course, it might still be tasty, and I expect it will be. They're in the oven now ;)

I cored out the middle of the apple from the top and left the bottom of the apple intact so that when I cut the apple open from the top, the apple fell open while still being connected and created a very fancy presentation. I also cooked it for 30 min. Turned out great!

It was slightly buttery- but I don't have measuring spoons, so that may have been my fault! I usually make it with oats, but didn't have any- this was equally delicious! I will definately make it again!

I used Granny Smith apples (which are really the only apples that I'll eat), but for some reason, they came out way too tart cooked. I also needed to cook the apples for longer than 15 min. Otherwise, they were just "okay". Next time, I'll try kicking them up by adding raisins or pecans as others suggested.

I didn't think these were all that great. It took waaaay longer than the 15 minutes to cook. I had to let them cook for about an hour before they were done. Probably won't make again.

Very good recipe.  The apples definetely needed to bake longer... I gave them an hour and they turned out perfect.  Great with vanilla ice cream!
