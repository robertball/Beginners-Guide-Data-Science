This was a nice pasta salad.  I skipped the olives and artichokes per personal preference, and the eggs because I'm lazy ;)  I thought it might pack a bit more of a punch given the dressing ingredients, but nothing really made it stand out from the usual pasta salad fare.  It's a nice pasta salad, for sure, but not one I can say for sure I'd make again (though it's certainly worth YOU giving it a try; it's good stuff!).  THANKS for the recipe!
