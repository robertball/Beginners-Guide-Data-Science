YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! I measured all of the ingredients for the dressing, using 1/4 cup of basalmic vinegar, instead of just 3 tbsps. (I used white basalmic), but other than that, I just eyeballed all of the other ingredients. I did cube the bread a bit earlier and let it 'dry' on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree oven for a few mins. This was a perfect combo of flavors, IMO. Even hubby, who doesn't like 'soggy bread' ate this up and commented on how good it was. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used regular tomatoes instead of romas, and Swiss cheese instead of fontina (because those were what I had on hand). It was good, but I made a couple of mistakes that hurt it. For one, I made my own bread cubes and cut them too large. I made them about an inch square. If I make this again, I'll make the bread cubes about half that size. The other mistake is that I waited too late to add the bread. The bread needs to be added close to serving, yes, but far enough ahead that the bread has a chance to start soaking up the deliciousness.  Once more, if I make it again, I'll add the bread cubes between 30 minutes and an hour ahead of serving. All that said, we really enjoyed the salad, and I'd make it again.

A great salad!  One other thing I like to do when making this recipe is to toast the bread then rub it with a clove of fresh garlic before you cube it. Mmm, it adds that garlic taste without biting into a chunk of it and the toasted bread absorbs the dressing.

Yummy recipe.  I used goat feta due to a food allergy.  I thought it would taste really 'bready', but all the other ingredients really came through.

Yum, was exactly what I was hungry for.  Great combination of ingredients and the dressing was herbal like you'd get in a restaurant. I used mozzarella instead of fontina and had to use dried basil, also increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup. Will definitely make again using red wine vinegar  which I prefer. Besides, the balsamic turned some of the bread cubes an unattractive brown color. This was sure good, thanks!
