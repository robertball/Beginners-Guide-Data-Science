I made these in a care pack for my boyfriend's family at Christmas.  They were the perfect sweet for the holidays.  A tasty little treat after dinner with coffee.

easy peasy and a great recipe to play with.  I toasted the coconut, replaced the pecans with almonds, and toasted some sesame seeds and also tucked a few of those inside with the almond.  Used a few different kinds of chocolate(semi-sweet, german, unsweetened) mixed together. **Tip for a nice sheen-add a tbsp. of shortening (not butter) to the chocolate while melting. **Tip #2-toast the nuts for a depth of floavor and to avoid bitterness.  Just toss them around in a hot dry pan on stovetop until toasted.  I'm still a double-boiler gal. these tasted absolutely delish, present so well, easy to make, and have an incredible taste. the nut(and the sesame) gave it a sweet/salty mix.  Loved it.  thanks so much.

Party hit! I Made these for my daughters 6th grade food fair. She was assigned to bring a food from Israel. I made about 100. Ours was the first dish emptied! We will be making these again soon.

Chocolate and dates are a surprisingly good combination. These are so super easy to make too. I just made enough for a small plate, to try the recipe. I prefer walnuts, so I used walnut halves instead of pecans. For the chocolate I used milk chocolate chips. I also didn't add the optional coconut and they were fine. This is quite a healthy way to satisfy a sweet tooth. The chocolate can really be added just to taste too. Interesting, ty.

It just doesn't get any better than this! I love dates and dark chocolate and nuts and coconut and all together the combination is perfect. I stuffed some of the dates with pecans and others with walnuts and used unsweetened coconut because I like it better. I kept mine in the fridge and it worked well. Delicious, sweet, and chewy wonderfulness. Great recipe Bina!
