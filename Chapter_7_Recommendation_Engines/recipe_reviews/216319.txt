Very easy to make and the spices are just right.  I used all pork the first time and made pattys with a burger press (about 14 pattys).  Hubby loves this recipe, but since he is a hunter, he is looking forward to a venison version, so stay tuned for the update.  His gun is ready and waiting! Thanks Michellegambel, I love the spice combination you developed!  :-)

This is awesome!  I'll never buy premade Italian Sausage again.  I left out the brown sugar - don't know if I missed it or not but I take out processed sugars of all my recipes.  I did however, put raw honey in as a replacement (don't measure how much).  I also added a bit of olive oil to it while mixing just to make it a little more moist.  It worked!

Absolutely fabulous. Best sweet italian sausage I've ever had! I made only one change and that was using just a pinch of salt, instead of a whole tablespoon. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Next time I make this, I might try this with half ground turkey to see if I can't make it a little healthier. EXCELLENT!

( GREAT SAUSAGE )This sausage recipe is better tha any meat market in upstate NY.   I started with a 7Lb. pork but and cut it into 2"x2" cubes with the fat , Put it into (2) 1 gal. zipper bags. The first bag I made mild . Bag #2 I added 2 Jalipenos diced up small. Put all your ingredients into each bag , zip and mix well to coat all sides of meat. Refrigerate , run through meat grinder with the fine grind blade and a casing attachment.   Easy as that...

I love making my own sausage because you're really in control of what goes into the food, and especially with sausage commercial products which are full of sodium and msg making pork, a relatively healthy meat into a heart attack waiting to happen. As for this recipe my husband is in love with it! I only had a pound of pork so I went ahead put all the spices called for in the recipe in a spice grinder to blend them evenly, makes about 7 tablespoons, put a third of that into the pound of pork, cooked it off and used in Lasagna Rollotini. Soooo good, even if I would let my husband go back to commercial sausage he wouldn't in a million years. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Perfect! After seeing this recipe I found some ground pork on sale at the store and so I had to try this recipe. It came out really well. Tasted just like Italian Sausage! I didn't have any ground fennel so I just used fennel seed. I think I used about a tablespoon but I didn't really measure that part. I used kosher salt, and 1 1/2 t of red pepper flakes. And I completely forgot the brown sugar, didn't seem to affect it at all. And to test it out I used the first pound in one of our family favorite recipe. Passed the test :) Thank you for this recipe.

Delizioso!! I love this recipe. I love it because I make it and there is no guessing what is in it or artificial ingredients. The flavor is authentic and can be tweeked to preference. I make 1/3 of the recipe and reduce everything by 1/3 with the exception of the fennel, brown sugar, oregano and thyme which I use the full amount. This really is a great recipe and I'm very happy to have it. For the best flavor let it ripen 24 hours before using.

This was a good base recipe. I used 4lbs of pork shoulder and then added 2 TBSP of toasted Fennel and a little more than 3 TBSP of brown sugar. I added a little more of each spice and a wise old Italian once told me to use 1 TBSP of salt per pound of pork. For 4 lbs I used 3 TBSP of kosher salt. This is the 2nd time I have made this and it was perfect. I also use 1TBSP of red wine vinegar per pound so I did use 4 TBSP for what I had. I also added fresh garlic, about 2 TBSP. 

The key to making sausage is keeping it cold. Cut shoulder into strips to feed into grinder. After you cut them stick them in a bowl and into the freezer for 30-45 minutes. Grind the sausage after that and once ground put back in a bowl for 30 minutes in the freezer without spices. Take out and flatten like a hamburger, cover the top with all of the spices and fold in. If you use the same bowl you used in the freezer the bowl will still be cold and you grind it again with the spices back into the bowl. Grinding again with the spices breaks it down a little more and blends the spices perfectly.

4 stars because too salty. I calculated to 8 servings as I only had 2 lbs of ground pork. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used a white balsamic. Because that has a sweetness to it I didn't add the little bit of brn sugar. I scaled the crushed red pepper back a bit and used a full tsp of oregano and thyme. I mixed all this and then froze it to use for lasagna another time. Today, after I cooked it up and tasted it; I was bummed that it was so salty (and I like salty food). I'll make it again but add only 1/2 salt called for. Then this will be 5 stars I'm sure. I'm hoping all the other ingredients in my lasagna mellow it out ...guess I'll find out soon as I'm cooking it for dinner tonight. Update: I added sausage to 1/2 of my lasagna and did notice how salty that side tasted. But...the next day, after re-heating...it was fine (strange). Anyway, I'll still go w/half the salt next time. If it could use more after cooking, I can add it; sure can't take it out though.

This is a fabulous recipe; I substituted ground turkey for the pork, because I don't eat pork. Making my own turkey Italian sausage is so much cheaper than buying it from the market, and it also taste better.
I like using it in my spaghetti sauce, my adult children just love it. I will be using it in sausage patties for Christmas morning breakfast.

If you do not like the sugar in the sausage, just leave it out. I also sometimes use fresh garlic, basil and parsley. I use 4-5 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoon basil and 1/4 cup of parsley.

I didn't care for this recipe. The basil is overpowering. I would however, increase the brown sugar, thyme and oregano. I used the auto adjust button to reduce the recipe to 4 serving sizes to accommodate the 1 lb of pork I had to use, and those ingredients translated down to just a pinch each, not enough to make a difference in the recipe, whether for the original serving size or not.

After searching through dozens of sausage recipes, I chose this one because it just sounded "right" and there aren't any weird ingredients in here.  My husband says it's the best he's ever had- way better than the good stuff we get from the local sausage maker.  My daughter actually said "it tastes like sausage that floated down from heaven".  She really loved it.  I left out the fennel because I didn't have any.  We didn't miss it.  I think your spice mixture for this is really good.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.

This sausage was terrific.  We have moved to Ecuador, so we cannot find Italian Sausage.  This is better than what I remember back home in Canada.  We just shape it into patties, and freeze.

Great recipe. I sadly didn't have fennel seeds, but even without them this was a great recipe. I used ground beef -- even though it says not to -- and it was still very good. I took the meat after seasoning it, mixed it up and cooked it into a crumble. Then I added stewed tomatoes, a bit of sugar and paste and made a great sausage meat sauce for my fresh made wheat pasta. Great meal!

Reduced the recipe by 1/3 as I had two pounds of ground pork.  I used a full 2 t of fennel seed because I love that taste and the full measure of red pepper flakes because I want it with some heat.  I divided the two pounds into 4 1/2 pound packages and put it in the freezer.  I will update my review when I use it the first time.  It looked and smelled good the way it was!

The recipe is fantastic and versitile. Having made it several times, I find it easier to make individual patties and loosly wrap them in wax paper.  I then make bags of three or four patties and freeze them that way.  For me at least, this is much cleaner and less hassle than the author's frozen log of sausage.  I can pry them apart with a bread knife and braai them straight from frozen.

Great recipe, used a combo of pork and 90/10 beef, cut the amounts in half because I was only using 1.5 lbs.  Everything turned out great.  Will definitely keep this one handy!!

This one was awesome!  The second time I made it I reduced the salt and the crushed red pepper to 2 tsp each, next time I will increase the amount of meat to 3 lbs for a little less intensity but it was very flavorful.  For those new to sausage making, my tips would be:  
Cut your meat into strips, not cubes.  That way it pulls itself through the grinder and very little pushing is required,  
Lay the strips out in a single (or close) layer on a sheet tray and sprinkle that with your spice mixture and vinegar - let the grinding process mix your sausage as much as possible.  
Chill meat thoroughly or partially freeze and never strain your grinder by pushing too hard.
When mixing, toss it lightly until the color is consistent throughout (both spices and fats distributed).  Makes a more tender sausage than heavy stirring or kneading.
To get the last little bit of meat through the grinder, finish the grinding with a few slices of bread.  It will clean out the remaining meat and won't hurt your finished sausage if any gets in. Have fun!

Excellent - I used a very lean ground pork and it came out wonderfully!  HUbby loves it and it's a staple from now on -- perfect for breakfast patties, sausage subs with marinara, spaghetti sauces or just crumbled on top of some penne with peas. YUM!

This is an excellent recipe. I have made a number of adjustments to mine, but this is the basic formula you can tweak to make this to your taste. I use white sugar instead of brown, though brown's probably better for a richer flavor. I don't add crushed red pepper or the black pepper because the ground pork I buy is already seasoned to "medium" (It is a local producer, so he adds only red and black pepper and sage to the meat). I use leftover red wine that's been in the fridge too many days to drink instead of the red wine vinegar. I use freshly grated garlic instead of powder. I omit the thyme, oregano, and basil, instead using McCormick salt-free Italian blend, which contains all of those spices and more. I do everything else the same. This is versatile, delicious, and gives you the ability to control what goes into your Italian sausage.

Absolutely the BEST Italian sausage I've ever had.  I'm spoiled now and won't buy it at the store anymore.  I looked up this recipe because we bought a half a pork and had a bunch of ground pork.  We went through the sausage quickly, and now I look for pork steaks and roasts on sale, grind it up with my Kitchenaide and make the sausage.  This is SOOOO easy, too.

This was really good! I did it a little different from the recipe. I forgot the pepper, used Italian seasoning for the basil, oregano and thyme because that's all I had in the pantry. I also didn't use ground fennel, but fennel seed. I used one tablespoon of brown sugar. Really good! We raise pigs, and when they're sent to freezer camp, I'm going to get the meat back so I can make our own sausage, and not pay someone else for preservative filled sausage. Absolutely going to make again!

I will never buy Italian sausage again. I made this with ground chicken because it is what I had. Like one review, I put all the spices in my spice grinder. I forgot the vinegar but I didn’t miss it. I also left out the sugar because I am cutting out added sugar. I love that I can just throw it together and cook it for spaghetti or patties and it is very flavorful. This is the second time to make it and the first time I only left out the sugar and reduced the red pepper flakes as I don’t like hot.

The description says not to use ground beef but that is what I had...and only 2 lbs of it. For the spices I used the measurements indicated. The only other thing I did differently was 2 Tbls of vinegar vs. 3 and I didn't add any sugar. This sausage was amazing!!  We don't eat pork and I have been unable to find an Italian sausage that wasn't pork or wasn't in a pork casing at the grocery store.  I wouldn't even bother after having this.  Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

The black cracked pepper is overwhelming!  That is all you can taste despite all of the other herbs and spices that were added.  : (

I am in search of a Sweet Italian Sausage recipe. This recipe was made as stated. I made a pizza with a third of the recipe which was good but not sweet enough for my taste. The other two logs were frozen. After thawing the frozen logs and adding to the next pizza the salt took over and that is what the pizza taste like: salt. Caution: do not freeze using the recommended Tbsp. of salt. Cut way back on the salt and add more fennel. Another option is to grind the fennel in a coffee grinder before adding to the recipe.

Amazing! So easy and very good! We just bought our first 1/2 pig, so I used some of our ground pork in this recipe. Made pizza with it tonight, huge hit! (also had a great time measuring all the spices with my little one :) ) Thank you!

I had to make some substitutions and ultimately needed more spices and wish I'd used less salt but otherwise it was good. I used apple cider vinegar, italian seasoning (for the basil and oregano), whole fennel seeds, no paprika. Still good and I'd make it again if I didn't have italian sausage but wanted to use it in a recipe. Thanks!

Very good recipe for Italian sausage! First time making sausage and recipe was a success! Easily modifiable to preferences for hot/mild Italian. Had a 8-8.5 LB boston butt/pork shoulder and ground the meat ourselves. Used dry red wine (cab) instead of red wine vinegar, but may use merlot or zin next time. Halved amount of crushed red pepper (we do not care for hot Italian). If you only have fennel seed, just crush/grind it to the amount called for in the recipe. Before you make logs/freeze it, taste test a small cooked portion the NEXT DAY (or wait at least 12 hours). Then, add additional seasonings as you see fit before freezing it. Initially, found it was too salty (and I love salt)—I used kosher salt. Left mixture in fridge overnight. Next morning cooked up another small portion—what a difference, no longer overwhelming in salt! Think it could use more oregano and thyme and maybe a tad more brown sugar, but don’t want the meat to become too sweet or herby. You can reduce the amount of salt in this recipe, but wouldn’t reduce by more than half. Researched among several different websites and found for Italian sausage 1 to 1.5 tsp salt per 1 LB ground pork is used. The amount called for in the recipe is on par with others. If still too salty for you, do not toss out the whole thing…just mix in more ground pork and other seasonings, no additional salt. If you want to cook sausage same day, do reduce the salt. Using this to make CHI Stuffed Pizza tonight (not from this site)!

I made 15lbs of Sweet Italian Sausage today.  Made them into full size links.  Real hog casings and all.  I am truly impressed with the flavor and texture.  Just the right amount of spices.  No one spice stands out, each one compliments the other.  The blend is just right.  They are amazing.  I am having spaghetti and sausage for dinner as I type.  I can't remember having such a flavorful Sweet Italian Sausage in 30 years.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  I am loving every single bite.

wow this was super tasty.. i cut the recipe in half and used it on 20 oz of ground turkey.. i reduced the salt by a third and the rest of the ingredients by just a smidgen/pinch/etc to account for the ingredients being for a total of 24 oz of sausage.. i left out the brown sugar as we don't care much for sweet.. it had a good amount of spice/heat which we both love.. this will be my go to recipe for spicy italian sausage from now on.. ty for the recipe!

So good. I used it with deer (venison) and 10% pork fat.  It could have used a little more fat but the spices were fabulous.

Thank you for an easy to put together and tasty sausage recipe! I used 2 lbs ground pork and 1 lb ground turkey and other than that, stuck to the recipe very closely. Next time, I will make it spicier by adding some cayenne pepper and more crushed red pepper flakes!

We love to make our own pizza.  At the present time we am living in the Netherlands and have not been able to find Itaiian style sausage in the grocery store.  This recipe is a wonderful subsitute and has made it possible for us to enjoy one of our favorite dishes.  Our plan is to continue using this recipe when we return to the USA.

Ground my pork (I used a pork butt. I trimmed it of the biggest pieces of fat but I wanted some for flavor). Then followed the recipe. We loved it and I know what’s in there!

This was super easy and delicious. 
The changes I made are: organic ground beef instead of pork; half the recipe; fresh garlic, 2 cloves;  garlic infused coconut vinegar; no sugar;  added tarragon;  anise seed plus fennel seed-neither ground, and when I was adding the anise and fennel at the very end, I forgot it was a half recipe. I don't mind that as fennel is one of my favorite things in Italian food and really good for you! 
 I will definitely be returning to this recipe which is bookmarked.

Better than store bought. I used ground turkey and took the suggestion to add a little olive oil. It was so good!

This is the best!  I've made it several times using ground pork butt.   Both times, I used red wine instead of red wine vinegar because  I didn't have any.  We also put it all in casings for Italian sausage.

I have most of the ingredients on hand all of the time. This was such a simple recipe to make. I used a digital pressure cooker to cook 1lbs of frozen ground turkey with the spices and 1c water. Once the meat was cooked (5mins) I changed the setting to sauté to absorb the water (10mins). My total time was 20mins and I had delicious cooked sweet Italian sausage. I may never buy sausage again once I have the kitchen aid sausage stuffing attachment. Of course you could add your favorite pepper spice to make it hot.

I didn't pay attention to the amounts in the recipe, I just made sure to use each ingredient listed to my liking.  I didn't have fennel seed so used anise seed instead.  I ground some pork belly in my food processor and flavored it with the seasonings above, let it sit in the fridge at least 24 hours and cooked up the next day to go on top of homemade meat pizza.  I added more brown sugar for a caramelized effect when cooking on the stove.  I like sweet italian sausage for pizza.  I was eating this stuff by the spoonfuls!  So delicious!!

This is an excellent recipe.  You can add as much fennel seed as you like, actually as much or as little of any of the spices.  What makes this so great is you know what is in your sausage.  I shared this with my mother, she says she is so happy, finally she has the Italian sausage that she hasn't been able to find in years.

This is a very flavorful recipe. I did not include the brown sugar and ground my own chicken (skinless thighs & tenders).  I could not wait the 12 hours and it was still great and tasty. I made spaghetti meat sauce. This recipe is the best bulk Italian sausage recipe I've tried and I tried quite a few and was giving up hope.  Thanks so much.

Just did up 12 pounds of this.  I decided to no add the salt for a few reasons...including but not limited to my husbands high BP and I tend to run on the side of dehydration..which can cause all foods to taste salty.  I found this recipe to be VERY mild.  I did a taste cook and then added more seasoning including anise and it still is not spicy.  No matter, this is a good recipe.  If you want hot you need to add a lot more red pepper...or your choice of heat...and add anise and fennel.  Without 'beefing it up' you have a great mild Italian sausage with this recipe.

This is an excellent basic recipe.  I've now made it twice.  The first time, I followed the directions exactly as written using pre-ground pork from my butcher and the sausage was very good but the texture was a little dry.  The second time, I ground my own using 2.5lbs pork shoulder and .5lb added pork back fat.  I also used red wine instead of the red wine vinegar and added a couple of ice cubes to chill it and increase the total liquid to about 1/4 cup.  I used whole fennel seed, not ground so I doubled the amount to 1 1/2 teaspoons, which I ground in a mortar and pestle with the salt and red pepper flakes.  The texture was much better than my first effort due to the added fat and liquid.  For a mild Italian sausage, this was everything I'd hoped for.  Next time, I plan to try fresh parsley and garlic and perhaps even some chopped green onion tops.  I may try adding a little ground anise as well but the recipe is fine as written except that it could use a little more liquid and added fat.

Tweaked it just a bit for our tastes and as others suggested. I used 5 lbs of fresh pork sausage. I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and nearly doubled all the other seasonings except fennel because I didn't have any. Also added two cloves minced garlic and increased the brown sugar to 3 Tbl (we like it sweet). The salt was almost too much but I can't guarantee the butcher didn't add salt... All in all very good.

My dad has kidney disease so it was great to find a recipe for sausage with just the basics - tastes just like the store but you can adjust the salt (and leave out the fennel if you want!)

I was so disappointed in this sausage.  With all the wonderful herbs and seasonings in it, all I could taste was salted pork.  There was none of the licorice flavor from the fennel--none of the flavor of herbs like the basil were present.

I didn't like the flavor, but since it was for my husband, his only complaints were that it had way too much salt and wanted me to add some whole fennel seeds in addition to the ground.  I won't use this recipe again, but it may be perfect for others.

A diffinite keeper. Made just as stated & won't change anything the next time as spices are just right for us. The worse part is grinding your own pork up if you choose to do that instead of buying ground pork.

I used less salt and pepper and added a little anise seed.  We no longer eat pork, so I have been trying to come up with a good substitute for processed Italian sausage.  I used half ground beef and turkey.  This turned out the best so far!

I love this spice combo.  We live outside the U.S. and we can't always find Italian sausage in the stores here, so I use this recipe for soups, sauces, etc.

I’m quite certain that there is an error in some measurements, most notably the brown sugar. I followed the recipe exactly and made 3 lbs. of this sausage, approximately 60% venison and 40% pork. The recipe called for a mere 15 grams of brown sugar for this quantity of meat. 
Not enough to even make it worth putting in but I did anyways. The final product was fine but definitely lacking the balance that some sweetness would have brought. I believe the author maybe just made an error when posting the recipe, especially considering that it’s called “sweet Italian” sausage. My guess is maybe it should say 1/4 cup instead of 1/4 tsp in the original recipe. 
I would also add more fennel seed to my personal taste

i come from a family of dedicated Italian cooks. I am a second generation Italian, and after watching my mother and her siblings make sausage, my only comment on this recipe is to allow it to rest for several hours prior to cooking it as the spices need time to mature.

I LOVED! this recipe. We don’t eat pork but I used ground chicken. It was amazing! Just used a little less chicken 2 1/2 lbs. the flavour was so great. Thanks so much for posting this. I have not been able to make quite a few recipes due to the fact that we do not eat pork sausage. Well , now I am trying all of them thanks to you!

I love it. I only use 1 tsp of red pepper and that was more than enough. I gut told me to use 1 tbsp when I read it, however, when I opened the jar of pepper, the smell was rather strong.

I used the sausage in a meatloaf recipe. It gave my meatloaf a wonderful flavor.  The next day, I made some into breakfast sausage. Again, wonderful. I don't think I'll buy sausage from a store any more.

This is by far the best Italian sausage I’ve ever had.  A little extra brown sugar, oregano, and thyme helps a bit I think.  For all the salt haters out there, if you reduce the size of the recipe you can’t reduce salt in equal proportion to the size reduction.  For three pounds the tablespoon in just perfect.  Do let it rest overnight in logs in the fridge before freezing.   It’s great for sausage and gravy too!  By the way, if you can’t find fennel (fennel doesn’t exist in Costa Rica) Anis seed reduced by half and ground in a spice grinder works fine!

This is fantastic! I am intolerant to nightshade vegetables which includes bell peppers and paprika, so good luck trying to find an Italian sausage in the store! I thought I would make this recipe to try and duplicate an already-made Italian sausage, and it worked out even better than I imagined, even with omitting the paprika and using no chili peppers . I increased the amount of spice in the recipe just to give it lots of flavor (especially fennel), though used the same amount of red wine vinegar and brown sugar. I did not roll into sausages, I just chopped it in my frying pan, then when it was done I added garlic flavored Classico Alfredo sauce, some spinach, and some broccoli and mixed that with pasta. Wow! My Italian husband couldn't stop eating it & neither could I. After using this recipe, I'm not sure I will ever buy premade Italian sausages when it is so easy & flavorful to make your own.

Definitely not "sweet" with the amount of red pepper flakes that the recipe calls for.  I know it says to taste, but this had too much kick to it for my kids.  This was mild to hot, even after using it in a spaghetti sauce recipe and simmering for hours.  I'll make it again, but with MUCH less red pepper.

Made a 1/3 batch, using lean pork loin ground in a food processor. I cook with no saturated fats, or low fat used, and it was good even with the modifications.

I made this using ground boneless, skinless, chicken breast because I am on a point system lifestyle.  I loved it.  One pound equals one point.  Very flavorful.  Will be a staple for me!

Use 2/3 of the  recipe's pepper flakes and black pepper.  Double the sugar.  Half the salt.  I used this on 2 lbs of ground rabbit and 1 lb of ground pork.  This recipe is for a spicy italian sausage.  It is good, but a little too spicy for what I use it for.

ThIs is a very good sweet Italian recipe I put a little less black pepper and red pepper to tone it down a little. Otherwise I followed the recipe and really like the flavor I even enjoy it for breakfast.

This is a great recipe! One that is easily customizable to taste preferences too! I have made this twice now and LOVE the end product. I use this sausage recipe using lean ground turkey (I make one pound batches) for the Slow Cooker Zucchini Soup on this site. I have shared this recipe with others as well. Thank you so much for this recipe - it is my go to from now on!

The flavor in this simple recipe is unbelievable--for how simple it is to prepare it makes it tough to consider buying sausage store bought. Tastes exactly like you'd expect only better and it's as traditional as it comes, highly recommend!

I've made this a few times to use with lean turkey. Very happy with my Turkey Italian Sausage. I tweak here and there now for stronger flavor, but there was no disappointment following the recipe amounts, as is. Have used this for Pizza, to mix with peppers and potatoes, breakfast. Nice recipe that has saved me time.

Butchered a hog a couple of weeks ago, tried this recipe and it was just perfect. The seasonings are balanced. My husband and son gave it their approval and that is a huge compliment in my household when it comes to me trying someone else's recipes. You can easily add more spices after the first original mix if you want. We liked it just the way it was. Will be making and sharing this recipe. Thank you Michelle Leigh Gossman for the share.

I didn't mean to change the recipe. (I really hate when people change the recipe and then rate it!) I thought I had
fennel and was out. So I added anise seed. It was great! Will make again with fennel.

Unbelievably good with venison. Little less pepper for pork, which was just to suit my taste and just as wonderful.

Wow!!! I live in Bangkok and getting great quality Sausage meat... let alone Italian sausage meat has been impossible. So I tried this recipe and it’s just so good! Can’t get fennel seeds here so left that out but followed every other part of the recipe. Just try this one. Great

I initially made this exactly as written and found it an excellent way to make sausage.  Yesterday I needed chicken sausage for a recipe so I substituted 97% fat free ground chicken breast for the pork and again it was excellent.  This is a great way to control the greasiness usually found in store-bought sausage and since  my recipe used cooked and drained sausage the extra fat wasn't necessary.

I made a mild version of it. Excellent recipe! Very good taste. Just make sure you don’t grind your meat too fine. Using the 10mm blade is the good enough. Next time I’ll try to use the blender to stir the ground meat for a little bit longer like 1-2 minutes to improve the texture. Our was too fine so it tastes very dry. But the flavor is very good! We’ll stick to the recipe for sure. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love it! I use this as an alternate to breakfast sausage and Jimmy Dean sausage in many recipes. It works perfectly.  I always omit the red wine vinegar because we don't have it on hand, and I usually skip the refrigeration too because I'm in a hurry, and it turns out fine anyway. Might be even better with those two.

This is a great recipe; the proportion of spices are perfect for our taste buds.  I have to make everything from scratch because my husband is on a low sodium diet; I made the recipe exactly as it stated except I had to use "Nu-Salt", and it was wonderful!  We finally have Italian sausage in the house again.  I have so missed it.

Perfect, as written,  for medium spicy Italian sausage. I ground boneless pork loin that I got a Costco’s Holiday sale for under $1 per pound. I used 4 lbs of the pork and adjusted the rest of the ingredients (using allrecipe’s calculator for 16 servings made that a snap) to make it exactly as written, except that I added 1/4 cup olive oil because pork loin is so lean that It would be too dry otherwise. Delicious!

We loved the flavour of this sausage.  I made it to the recipe, other than adding 3 tsp of crushed chilis.  My only complaint was that it was a little on the salty side for our tastes.  Next time I will reduce the salt content by half or even down to 1/3.

I made a few small changes to accommodate my personal taste, but this was a great recipe to start from. I did not use ground pork, I used a pork shoulder (it was on sale) and ground it in  my food processor; it worked out better than I expected. I also doubled the fennel and added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to make mine a bit more spicy. Looking forward to see how it freezes and thaws out later.

This was so good! Incredibly easy to make. My family loved it.  No need to buy subpar sausage from the grocery store. I followed list of ingredients but accidentally left out the red wine vinegar. It was still fantastic.  Will make my own from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

Since I am a Muslim, Alhamdullilah, I do not eat pork. So, I modified this recipe to not only taste more flavorful, but make it more more healthy and to follow  the laws of Allah (God).  I doubled the spices, since spices are the medicine that Allah has made for us to heal our bodies. I also used raw sugar instead of processed white "crack" sugar. And I use Himalayan Salt instead of processed table salt.  My husband thought the meat had wonderful flavor and was perfect for our home made pizzas. MashaAllah!

This was pretty good.   I raise my own pigs and have a few recopies I use.  I followed this to the T.  The following day I cooked some up for a test and found it just too bland so I added extra spices and fennel seed.  But this was a good basic recipe.  Being italian, I like some extra flavor.

I ground up 3 large boneless/skinless chicken breasts and 1 lb of pork terderloin.  It made one of the best meat sauces I have ever had!  Try it, you'll like it!

One of the spices is overpowering  in the batch I made. I followed the recipe to a tee. I hope that flavor will mellow out with time in the freezer. It is good. But not great.

Edit: After freezing this sausage is actually amazing. Give it time for the flavors to meld on this one. It is worth the wait. Some of the best sausage I have ever made actually!

Excellent, enough said.  Well maybe not, I did cut the red pepper flakes in half because I do not like spicy food.  I will never buy sweet Italian sausage again.  Pair this recipe with "World's Best Lasagna" and you will be loved by all.

Excellent! I used fresh garlic & onions and a little squirt of honey instead of sugar for dietary reasons. Cut the red pepper flakes back a little and I love the results. I used 2/3 venison to 1/3 ground pork. Fried it all up and will throw it in the freezer. I'm hoping to try putting in a casing on the the next time around. Didn't realize how great it smelled until I went outside and came back in. Wow!

This is a really nice recipe. Even though I didn't have the sugar or fennel seed it still tasted great, although I think next time I would increase the amount of herbs besides the basil since it was hard to pick them out.

I have made this twice, once with turkey & one with pork.  Fabulous both times.  The pork one I didn't use fennel as there was none in the kitchen I was in.  Still great!!

I only made a pound each time.  And I didn't let it sit for 12 hours for the flavors to blend.  Excited to see how wonderful it will be if I allow the flavors to blend more!

I have always wanted to try to make home made sausage. I  got all the kitchen aide attachments for Christmas, and this was my first attempt! It turned out wonderful!! I went to the butcher and bought a pork butt and casings!   I have one question though, after i was all done I realized I forgot the vinegar. What does that do? I wonder how much it affects the taste. My family loved it anyway!

Made this recipe yesterday.  My husband & I have been making sausage for years & have to say BEST recipe ever.  Mixed up the recipe (using the 3 lbs of ground pork), made a patty, fried it up to try & that was it, ended up doing 51 lbs for the freezer.  We cut back a little on the cracked black pepper &  red pepper flakes, (they had a little bite to them-depends how hot you like) but other than that did the recipe as printed.  Delicious!! Gave my parents & brother some to try & everybody is raving about them.  This one is a keeper & the only recipe we'll use now.

Very good!  I did alter the recipe to make it vegetarian.  I used 2 packages of frozen cauliflower cooked per label directions in place of the meat.  Press cooked cauliflower between paper towels to remove excess water.  Cut spices to 1/3.  Combine.  Heat about 1 tablespoon olive oil on high heat.  Cook for about 3 minutes on one side to get a nice crisp/carmelization, then flip and cook for an additional 3 minutes.

Better than storebought.  Used prepackaged Italian seasoning in place of all herbs already contained in Italian seasoning.  Just because I did not already own all herbs individually.

I used cider vinegar since I didn't have red wine vinegar, toasted the fennel seeds before grinding, used half of the salt, and no red pepper flakes. This sausage tastes like I expected - balanced and tasty. Since I have reduced the sodium in my diet,  I can enjoy sweet Italian sausage again thanks to this recipe. Try it! You will not be disappointed.

Awesome recipe. Made it as written the first time but then made the following to suit my taste buds:

Reduced salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons
Increased fennel to 1 1/2 teaspoons
Mixed in my stand mixer with the paddle attachment until is was sausage consistency - 4-5 minutes.

Family loves this and I haven't purchased sausage from the store in a year. Thanks for the recipe.

My hubby and I are on a ketosis diet but due to his kidney function he needs to be have low sodium.  Made with Ground Pork from costco and did not add any salt or brown sugar.  Dumped everything into a big ziploc to mix with no mess then left in fridge for 1 day to let flavours blend.

next day i fried it and served over a big raw vege salad with apple cider vinegar dressing and OMG was it good.  i added extra salt at the table for me (i love salt) but my hubby loved his version as well.  a real keeper of a recipe.

This sausage recipe is my favorite!  It is delicious and easy to make.  I always use this recipe for my spaghetti sauce.  You can't beat it.  Try it in your homemade spaghetti sauce and you'll be amazed at how good it is!

I had thawed out ground pork for a meatloaf that didn't get made and was looking for something to do with it. I didn't have the fennel or the vinegar, but forged ahead anyhow. I let them sit for an hour, then made them and cooked them. They were great! I can't wait to try the original recipe when I have more time.

I love this recipe!  I've made  it several times, with very consistent results.  The spice mix is well balanced and has a great flavor.  Your choice of pork is what makes or breaks the deal! Personally,  I only use pork butt and strive for 38-40% fat.  It sounds high,  but it's what makes sausage moist.  I consider this a 'small batch' recipe.  Depending on how you stuff them, 12-16 can be expected.  This is a great recipe for someone making sausage for the first time.

Excellent sausage recipe. Changes I made: cut back on salt by a third (glad I did). Added a couple teaspoons of Montreal Steak seasoning, and used 1/2 ground pork, 1/4 coursely ground pork and 1/4 course ground beef. All else I did the same. Love it! Will make again.

I used a mix of lamb and beef.  After letting it rest overnight, I cooked a small piece and added more seasoning and included rosemary and sage.  It was a bit dry so I added several tablespoons of beef bacon fat.  The next morning tasted it again and it was very good.  I used it to stuff peppadew peppers.

I had some ground pork that I wanted to use to turn into italian sausage.  So I used this recipe so I would know what spices to use.  This turned out really good.  Love it, will use this again.

I used most of the ingredients in this recipe with some ground DEER meat... The only ingredients I omitted were the red wine vinegar and dried basil.. I fried some bite-sized cut up potatoes and chopped onions in a bit of oil, mixed it all together.. and voila! The results were excellent, and the whole family approved!! Delicious :D

This one is a keeper. I made the recipe true to the instructions. I ground a 3 lb pork roast, mixed in this spice blend and refrigerated for 24 hours before cooking. Just outstanding!

This was the best Italian sausage ever.  The only thing we didn't have was the fennel.  I put it in some baked zit-ti and it made the dish!  Thanks for the delicious receipt.

This is a fantastic recipe. I halved the recipe and the only changes I made was I used fresh parsley and white sugar. These are moist and flavorful.

I used 4x the oregano & switched the brown sugar for cinnamon since my hubby is pre-diabetic.  Very good overall.  I threw in the extra oregano to compensate for using jarred tomato sauce (gasp!), used it in a deep dish pizza w. red,green,& yellow peppers & onions... comfort food bliss!

I adjusted the salt as recommended in other reviews. I used about 1/2-3/4 teaspoon and 1/4t pepper. A lot less, but we are on a sodium restricted diet.  I also decreased the garlic to about 2t due to our tastes.  I increased the oregano to at least 1t. Omitted the red pepper for sweet sausage. Left other seasonings as written. Added Parmesan cheese.  I fried a tiny patty to check seasoning and my husband loved it. This is a great starting recipes. I significantly decreased the salt to keep within out diets.  The seasonings are so good, we really didn't miss the salt. Thank you michellegambel for this great jumping off recipe!

This was my first time making sausage. It was really delicious. The recipe has a tiny bit too much salt and pepper for my taste. That's easy to adjust. Everything else was perfect for me. This will definitely be my "base" recipe in the future. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I lightly fried cut-up poblano peppers and sliced onions and then added them to the sausage and it was a very delicious entrée!  No leftovers at all.  Fabulous recipe!  I heard about adding fresh fennel to the sausage like the Italians do and might try that next time.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I did add some fresh chopped garlic as well.

My family loves this sausage. I usually use low fat ground turkey or chicken and it always turns out great! Awesome in Italian soups and/or pasta dishes and even in breakfast dishes. I love that I can control the amount of fat going into my family's food and can eliminate all of those nasty additives you get with store-bought sausage. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I didn't have parsley or fennel seeds, so didn't add those. And left out brown sugar as I'm primal (no grains, no sugar). I think this is great. I'll use it in my chili recipe, but just made a patti with eggs and haloumi cheese. Yum!

I made this about 3 months ago. I made exactly like recipe, except I did not add any salt. It is delicious. Using it to make Italian sausage soup.
