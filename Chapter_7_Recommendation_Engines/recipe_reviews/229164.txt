Very good recipe!  I prefer to use dark chocolate, though, instead of the milk chocolate so it's not too sweet.  For a mint version, I have used half dark chocolate and half Andes mints for the candy.  Quite delicious!

This recipe was a Recipe Group selection; and while it is easy to make, it missed the 5 star rating for me! Before I whipped the cream, I placed my mixing bowl and beater into the freezer for about 15 minutes in order for them to be chilled. I used a pre-made Oreo chocolate pie crust.  I also used chocolate/vanilla Kraft marshmallows.  My candy bar was chocolate with almonds and I put the candy bar into the food processor and pulsed until finely chopped. For my decorations, I cut miniature marshmallows into flower shaped petals and used a yellow M & M in the center - creating daisies. The pie was light and fluffy with a definite chocolate flavor. When I first read the recipe, I noted there was not any sugar added to the heavy whipping cream and pondered adding a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar. I wish that I had followed my instinct and added the powdered sugar to the heavy whipping cream as I think this would have made a much better pie. The pie sliced and served beautifully. I will make this pie again and add the sugar and perhaps some espresso powder. Thanks for sharing cookerboy222!

I have made this twice this month, and it's soooo good! I've been looking for pie recipes that don't ask for instant pudding mix. I used a 1.5 cup of semi-sweet morsels. Thank you for this "few ingredient" recipe!

This is a keeper worthy of TEN STARS!  I used a store bought graham cracker crust, any would be good.  I can see the filling in little cups for a lighter no crust version.  Heavenly!

Made this for Recipe Group to take to work to share for Valentine's Day, 2013. I made a milk chocolate version, and a Special Dark version. I liked them both - not sure I could pick a favorite... I read "alow mixture to cool completely," and was trying to figure that into my schedule. What I did was to make the chocolate mixture when I got home from work, late at night. I let it cool a bit, stirring occasionally. I noticed a "skin" forming, so I covered it directly with plastic wrap, and went to bed. In the morning, I whipped my cream [first time!!!] and then beat in the chocolate. It worked just fine (= I thought I screwed up my second pie, when I did not rinse the beaters in between. I didn't see a point, when I was basically mixing the same things together, again. But the cream took a LOT longer to stiffen the second time, and I thought I'd blown it. It worked fine ~whew!~ I did use one Keebler shortbread crust, and one graham cracker crust. I think this would be really good with a pastry crust - but whipping cream was enough of a challenge for this cook this week (= My co-workers enjoyed this very much!

Made for Recipe Group. Goodness in a pie! I used the mini graham crust and made 6 little pies and had enough left over for a little glass and a container for hubby to take to work too. I used an assortment of milk and dark chocolate bars (thanks to Molly for the Ft Wayne bars!), dark chocolate chips, and semi sweet chips. I chilled my beaters and the bowl before whipping the cream and my little hand mixer with the whips beat that up in no time flat! I did taste it and decided to add a bit of powdered sugar. I piped the filling into the mini tins and then just a shot of canned whipped cream and some chocolate sprinkles on top. So light, creamy, and chocolatey goodness. What could be better?! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Recipe Group...SOOOO GOOD! Nice, fluffy and chocolately, without being heavy or too rich. This time I used a prepared graham cracker crust, but want to try it w/ a regular pie crust next time. I topped the finished pie w/ more whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles and mini choco. chips. HUGE HIT...This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love this recipe!  My soon asks for it All the time.  If you really need a chocolate fix use a cup of semi-sweet chips and an Oreo cookie crust, YUM!  I've also used a little peppermint extract in the mix for a mint chocolate mousse pie. Thanks for this one, ill be making this for years to come!

This was OUTSTANDING.  I added 3 TBSP confectioners sugar to the whipping cream as mentioned by someone else, so I can't speak to how it is without it.  But seriously?  This was the best chocolate cream pie I ever tasted.  I made it for Thanksgiving and tossed it in a premade graham cracker pie crust because, let's face, it any short cuts you can take on T-day is worth it.  It was like eating a s'more pie.  I'm not going to lie, I ate more of it than I should.  My husband, who has never had a chocolate cream pie in his life, loved it.  And both of us, who grew up Mainers, favored this OVER the whoppie pies that were there for dessert.  Cannot recommend this enough.  It was creamy and fluffy yet stable enough to not fall to smithereens upon cutting into it.  The chocolate was JUST the right amount of flavor without being too subtle or too sweet.  You don't even need the obligatory whipped topping that goes on it, it is wonderful just as is.

This recipe is awesome!  Just made it.  It was simple, easy, and delicious! I have made other recipes and spend all this time sifting the sugar and measuring out everything.  With this recipe the marshmallows are the sugar.  Besides being easy, it tasted great!  This is the new fav!

It was absolutely fantastic. I loved how rich and creamy it was. I made it for Thanksgiving for my family and it was the absolute favorite. Everyone was a big fan. I had a little leftover after I filled my pie crust so I put it into a custard cup with a little cool whip flourish and a chocolate sauce drizzle and gave it to my mom and she loved it. This is a recipe I will definately use again.

Soooo good! This was my first time dealing with whipping cream so it was frustrating at first because it wouldn’t whip and I didn’t know why. So I set it in the fridge for 15 mins and then used an electric hand mixer and it sped up the process a lot quicker. Was very quick and easy to make and was delicious!

Turned out great! Used 6 oz Oreo pie crust instead - added 3 tablespoon of powdered sugar to heavy cream and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar before mixing. Make sure to put bowl and beaters in freezer for at least 20 min before making the whip cream . Chocolate mixture must be completely cooled before folding into whipped cream. Texture is soft and fluffy- will def make again!!!

Absolutely a five star pie! Rich and creamy (but not too heavy) and delicious. I made one little addition: I added a about tsp of cinnamon to the chocolate mixture as I was melting it down and now I have a Mayan Chocolate Mousse Pie.

I thought this was addictively good! Yes, it is "light" in texture, but do not fool yourself that it is light! Lots of fat,calories and sugar--all of which we avoid in our household--BUT for a once in awhile treat, it is great!

OMG!!!  I'm not a chocolate freak like most, but this pie was PHENOMENAL!!!  The only thing I changed, is that like others, I put in 3 Tbsp of confectioners sugar into the whipping cream.  I also put the bowl and beaters in the freezer.  For the crust, I used Graham Cracker Crust I, from this website (with the cinnamon).

SO good! I've made this recipe a few times now and I only messed it up once. I didn't let the chocolate completely cool before combing everything and it was a disaster. Whoops. Poor time management on my part. Every other time it's been successful and super yummy. A keeper.

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe but added confection sugar to the whipped cream. I also used lady fingers in a spring form 9" pan lining the sides and bottom then poured in the mousse.  I saved some whip cream from the mixture to decorate with using my piping bag and then sprinkled shaved chocolate on top.  I froze this over night and took out 20 minutes before serving.  It was devoured quickly, nothing left over.

I made this with a coconut cookie crust and everyone had seconds. It doesn't need to be adjusted at all. The only thing that would have made it better was drizzling chocolate sauce on top.

Recipe Group Selection:  09, February 2013 ~ This was enjoyed by my family, but all agreed it is very rich and a small piece goes a long way. I'm not a chocolate pie eater, so I let all of them be the "star" judge on this one. The pie filling was very thick, in height, and fluffy, so it cut and presented very nicely.

Made this for Recipe Group week of 2/9/13. Made my own crust. Chocolate, marshmallows and milk all melted very nicely. Heavy cream whipped up great and the folding of the two together was easy. I poured it in and had much leftover in bowl.I used an 8" pie plate. So I would def. use a bigger one like the recipe says may even go to a 10". The recipe as is with no addition on the top I thought was nice. Some whipped cream on the top and your good to go. I then added some caramel and mini chips on top but because the mousse was heaped so well alot of the caramel slid down-not so good for presentation purposes. I sliced it and after 1 minute on plate my crust couldn't take the pressure and the side/crust bent back and then the mousse filling spread out a little. Again not a good presentation. So I would suggest sticking with a very light addition to the top like previous members did. The mousse had a chocolate flavor but not WOW. Came out much like any other chocolate/whip cream pie I have ever made. I would make again if I knew I had the ingredients and needed to make something. Otherwise it would not be a recipe I would buy the stuff to make again because I had to have it!

So good and easy! Made this for Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie. Followed the recipe exactly and used a store bought graham cracker crust. I also made whipped cream and topped with chocolate shavings. Will definitely make again.

Light and fluffy, tasted just like a chocolate candy bar. Started with a layer of chocolate chip cookies, layered chocolate pudding, chocolate mousse and topped with whip cream. Family loved it!!

Used 60% cocoa chocolate and an oreo crust. Fantasticly rich chocolate pie without being very sweet. The filling is so mousse like and light it is truly amazing considering how little effort is required. Highly recommend!

This is yummy! I did take some other reviewers' suggestions and added 3 or so tbs of confectioners sugar. Made two this week - one for a charity pie sale. It's all gone :-)

I’ve made this a handful of times and it’s always a hit. The kids love it and as a mousse lover I like that I can alter the recipe to my liking. The consistency is perfect. I sometimes use dark chocolate and other times I use less chocolate. You can’t  go wrong.

I just won first place with this recipe in a pie contest at my office!  It is super easy. I used 2% milk and it turned out great. Light and fluffy and yummy.   I used Lindt chocolate. Do not cheap out on the chocolate. Buy the best you can find. Dove is great, too. I’m going to try it with a chocolate ganache on top next time.

Great and simple. I used a mix of milk and dark chocolate. 20 large marshmallows because I didn't have minis and 1/2&1/2 instead of milk. Oh and a splash of chambord raspberry liquor. ??

To be honest, I was disappointed. Firstly, the classification of "mousse" was incorrect. A mousse is made up primarily of eggs, and there were no eggs in this recipie (although it is a good alternative for people who are allergic to eggs). Secondly, the combination of the chocolate, marshmallows, and the milk made it unbelieveably sugary, almost unbareable. Finally, it didn't set correctly, leaving it a semi-soupy mess. I do appreciate the idea that made this pie, but I do wish there were a little bit more substantial ingredients to go into this pie.

I didn't change a thing, followed the directions exactly (I usually don't do this as I like to tweak things) and it was amazing! I wouldn't change a thing. It's a very rich, milk chocolate and should be labeled as sinful. Yep, it's that good. Wonderful reviews from my family and it has become one of my favorite desserts to make.

I used semisweet baking chocolate for this and added vanilla flavoring with confectioners sugar and it still tastes great. Also coconut is a fantastic addition to spice it up some. It even made enough filling for two 9-inch pies for me (im not sure how, but I'm not gonna complain)!

I made this pie for a retirement pot luck at work and it was HEAVENLY! The recipe is so simple I don't need to look it up any more to make it. The only thing I changed was I didn't use chocolate bars I used chips and you can use either milk chocolate or semi-sweet.  They measured out to be a heaping cupful.  I am actually making this again as I type my review and will be making it many times more. DELISH!

I did not make any changes, so made exactly as written. The pie was very fluffy and pretty when cut but the taste wasn't great. I won't make this again - unfortunately because it's so simple to put together. IF I had to give a suggestion to others, add your own special ideas to it but don't make as is. Very bland....

I have made this a couple of times for my daughter. She is not a fan of fruit pies. For my pie plates I have doubled the recipe but for this holiday I decided to triple the filling to make an impressive presentation.  It's delicious.

Like other users I added the extra sugar to the cream but I don't know if it was needed to be honest! I put it on an oreo base instead of a pie base and think that gave it that something extra to be so tasty!  Everyone loved it, will make again with the oreo base!

Very easy to make.  Overly rich for my palate, but not for the kids or husbands.  It was a little too gooey and had not set well at the 3 hr mark.  Over night would have made it firmer I am sure.
Our 11 yr old made it this time, and I am sure he will make it again.

This is an amazingly easy recipe!!! The only thing I changed was to add a thin layer of hot fudge on the pie crust before putting in the chocolate cream.

It hasn't cooled yet, but just licking the spoon after I mixed and put the chocolate mixture into the crust it is HEAVENLY! A side note, as I had never used whipping cream before so I was surprised at how long it took to whip (about 12 min on the second speed of my hand mixer), and how much it grows, just to help someone who also may not have ever used it before either.

I made an oreo cookie crust (1 pkg. Oreo Cookies crushed, 1/4 cup butter mixed together) and lined an 11x8 pan. Followed the rest of the recipe to a t, poured onto crust, covered and refrigerated and it was delicious. One of the desserts that was completely finished.

Fantastic recipe! I suggest mixing in mini chocolate chips in to the pie when combining the whipped cream with the chocolate marshmallow mix. It adds little bites of chocolate in to the pie! Also I made an Oreo crust which is great for those chocoholics out there! This is a recipe I plan to keep with me!

This was a great recipe and easy too!  I followed the directions exactly, except that I could not find 7oz chocolate bars.  I used 2 - 4.25 oz Hersey Symphony bars...whats' a little more chocolate?  My pie turned out great and I am making 2 of them today (one is NOT enough!) for the second time.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this pie for my honey for Valentines Day and he really loved it. I am not a big chocolate person but I thought it 
was good but too rich for my tastebuds.  I followed this recipe as written but I used an Oreo crust. My one complaint is after 3 hours of being refrigerated it was as firmed as I would have liked. We put in the freezer and then cut the pie. I will make this again.

Made this for our church fellowship meal.  It was a hit!!  This pie is really rich tasting, so little goes a long way.  I had extra pie filling left over so I used it in pudding cups.  Thanks for sharing!!

I'm literally making this *right* now and love the recipe already. I decided upon a blind-baked regular pastry crust, however I can see the potential for a graham cracker or even chocolate cracker crust in the future. I've been using mini-marshmallows this season as part of an easy chocolate fudge recipe, so it was convenient to use them for sweetening and consistency. I decided immediately to use Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips (measured 7oz) as we are darker chocolate fans. The filling is so yummy after you fold in the heavy cream that it's hard not to eat. I had extra because the crust was small so my children enjoyed a light and airy mousse that I could totally serve in pretty cups for dessert as is. I'm planning to make a little more whipped cream and garnish with shaved dark chocolate. If this pie sets up well, it's going to be my GO-TO chocolate pie recipe for good. Fingers crossed and the 5 stars will stay. And if it doesn't, I'll still leave 4 stars purely for the immediate light mousse dessert option! Update: It set up perfectly because it's so light and fluffy. I added a dollop of whipped cream and drizzled melted chocolate over it and it was a HIT. This one's a keeper!
