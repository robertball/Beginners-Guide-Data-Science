Very good, very simple.  This can easily be made low sugar and low fat, and still taste really good.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

This is a family favorite. I make it year-round, not just at Thanksgiving.  A great dessert for summertime.

Great no-bake recipe.  I made this for work and it was gone within minutes and it was followed up with multiple requests for the recipe.    It could probably use a little more cinnamon and ginger.  I normally sprinkle the top of the pie with cinnamon for a little more taste.    There is too much pumpkin layer for my 9 inch crust so I normally take the extra pumkin layer and blend  with graham crackers and ice cream to make my own Pumpkin Pie Blizzard - my wife says it tastes just like DQs if not better.

This was a completely effortless recipe and really tasty.  I think I'll make the bottom cream layer a little thicker next time, but that's just due to my cream cheese obsession.  I'll make this again!

It's alright...but nothing to rave about.  The spices are definitely out of balance - I added a bunch of extra cinnamon, a little more ginger, and some nutmeg, and it still wasn't spiced enough.  The texture is nice, though, and the flavor isn't bad at all - just nothing I'd write home about.
