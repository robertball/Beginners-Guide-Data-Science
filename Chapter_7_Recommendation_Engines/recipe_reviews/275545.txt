Good recipe steam then lightly fry. I added a bit of minced garlic instead and fresh Italian parsley. Kosher salt or coarse salt also worked well with this potatoes. Cubed Yukon Gold potatoes would be an option just in case you do not have baby potatoes. I would say use 2 tbsps of olive oil but still adjust it to the amount of the potatoes. Only add the oil if you see it needs a bit more crisping or browning.
