Excellent as is!  Easy to make, even for someone who has never used phyllo dough.  Made as a dish to take to my son's elementary class for their Greek studies unit and all the kids loved it!  Thank you for the great recipe!

AUTHENTIC!  This is a AUTHENTIC recipe..many are not.. you can also use ALL FETA with the same other ingredients ..the Kefalori cheese is Not easy to find  but using all feta is also traditional tiropita. 
Adding spinach as some did is spanakopita and that is a different item altogether! This is supposed to be ALL CHEESE! 
Thank you for sharing a traditional recipe ! Its great

This is a really wonderful and impressive dish. Served a s a main for vegetarians with greek salad and as a side for omnivores with steak added. I could see adding to this dish with spinach, onion, garlic, to make a different taste, but the original is wonderful just as it is. Thanks for a lovely dish!

Fabulous! I usually get this at a local Greek church festival but I haven't had it since I moved. This is an amazing recipe. I will only make a few very minor changes in the future: I will omit the salt. Feta and the Greek cheese are fairly salty on their own. And, next time, I'm going to try and blend the cheese mixture and the white sauce together. It tastes amazing as is but the church I got it from has a smoother texture for the filling.

Great, easy-to-follow recipe! I made this for a Greek-themed dinner with my neighbors and it was a hit! I couldnâ€™t get kefalotyri cheese, but I read that I could use other sharp cheeses like Parmesan or Romano as substitutes. I used Romano cheese and it was delicious! Definitely will make this recipe again!
