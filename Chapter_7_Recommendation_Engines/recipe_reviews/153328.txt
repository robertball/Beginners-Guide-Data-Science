I have been making Baker's One Bowl Brownies (the recipe is on the back of the unsweetened chocolate squares box) for several years.  They are THE BEST!  Be sure to check the brownies before 30 minutes - I usually start with 24 minutes and don't bake much past it.  As soon as a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with fudgy crumbs instead of batter they are done.  Cutting these into shapes is a great idea for Christmas treat plates!

Oh man. These rock. I've never done the cut outs but they're -fantastic- as traditional brownies. Some of my tricks:   I've been able to cut 1/4 cup of the sugar out and leave out 1/4 cup of the butter/margarine without having the taste/texture changing at all to make the recipe at least slightly healthier.   I add in 2 tbs strong brewed coffee with the vanilla extract and eggs.   For a NM variation (we put heat into everything): 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Anything less and you won't even notice the heat. Anything more and you may regret adding it.  Cherry variation: 1 cup dried tart cherries and 2tbs cherry juice or 1tsp cherry extract.   I've also found I get a more delicate texture if I allow the wet ingredients to "rest" for a few moments in between adding each component and mixing them.   This recipe creates what may be the most perfect brownie ever. And I love how easy it is to clean up after!

Totally happy with the taste. Have to be patient with receiving the correct consistency. But I will try again.

These brownies are definitely the best!  They are chewy, fudgy and ohhh, so easy.  Only one bowl makes clean up so easy, too.  If you like fudge brownies, this should be #1 in your box!

Absolutely Delicious!  These were some of the best brownies ever! It was very easy to make and were awesome.  Only thing was that they took longer then the recommened 25 minutes to cook, more like 45 minutes.  And i omitted the nuts because of the crowd i was making them for, and used semisweet chocolate chips instead.  i also added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  yummy!!

Divine! Came out perfectly fudgy with chewy edges after 32 minutes. I didn't bother with cutting out shapes or dusting with powdered sugar.

Waaaaaay too sweet.  I suggest cutting back on the sugar by at least half a cup.  I like sweet things but this was ridiculous.

Delicious! Just made these today for the first time! Fudgey! Satisfied my sweet tooth! :) -- Set the timer for 27 mins and they were still a bit gooey... Set it for 3 more minutes and they came out perfect! (I too opted out on the powdered sugar.)

Wonderful brownies! Great chocolate flavor! They were easy to make. I baked mine in a square 9 inch pan. They baked for 35 minutes and came out perfect! I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips.

Not worth the "one bowl" clean up. Cooking time is way of, I was checking at 15 minutes, and they're not even slightly fudgey. A waste of time and ingredients. I'm sticking with Belinda's Fudge Chunk Brownies also found on this site.
