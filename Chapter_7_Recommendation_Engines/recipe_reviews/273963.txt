This was excellent! My sour cream had gone bad on me so I just used a little more mayo than the recipe called for. I used the chips as a dipper instead of incorporating them in the salad because there is only two of us and I didn't want soggy leftovers. I'm not a huge fan of corn but this recipe really impressed me and it is one I will make often this summer. Thanks for sharing!
