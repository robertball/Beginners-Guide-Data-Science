I donâ€™t typically review but this was delicious!  Just the right amount of sweet and savory.  I had mild Italian sausage and as others suggested I cooked it first with the onion, then added the apples, raisins and spices.  It was out of this world good, perfect for a cold autumn evening.

I will definitely make this again. The ingredients in the stuffing worked well together. I did change the cooking procedure. I cooked the sausage firs, drained it, and then combined the stuffing ingredients. These were then put into the halved and deseeded squash. I baked this (the squash was not precooked) until the squash was tender--30 + minutes. The whole process was no longer than the original and I was able to keep the any extra sausage grease out of my squash.

I made this according to the recipe but, since it was for just my husband and me,  I used only one acorn squash and pared down the other ingredients accordingly. We both thought it was very tasty and that the seasonings complimented the ingredients well. The only problem is that the fat that comes from the pork as it is cooked stays in the squash shell. If you're sensitive to fat this may not be for you, but remember fat conveys flavor.

This was tasty! If you like sweet and savory, this recipe is for you. I came across this while doing an ingredient search for acorn squash and pork sausage. I had 1 squash on hand that needed to be used up, and a half a tube of pork sausage - so basically I cut the recipe in half, but I probably had close to the full amount of sausage. I did need to bake it for about 45 minutes after adding the stuffing, to get the sausage cooked to 165 degrees. I covered them after the first 30 minutes, as the tops were getting a little brown, and I didn't want them to burn on top. I also used craisins, as the submitter suggested, as that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I added more of each spice and only cooked one acorn.  Loved the burst of flavour in the 'sausage' (I used beef and bison mix).

Absolutely delicious and very easy. I took some advice from other reviewers and cooked stuffing separately from squash. While it's pretty to serve in the squash half, we ended up removing all squash from skin and mixing with stuffing.

Quite good-I would add some butter and grease the pan (and thought so originally), but I always follow a recipe if I am going to review~

This was very tasty, lots of great flavours that went together very well.  I will definitely make this again.  I did what someone else suggested and I cooked the sausage mix before I put it in the oven.
