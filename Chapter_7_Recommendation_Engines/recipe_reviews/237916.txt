Nice change from the traditional cole slaw with a mayonnaise dressing.  I didn't have any honey mustard, so I just used regular mustard and added more honey...worked fine.  Enjoyed the sweetness from the honey and the crunch from the almonds.  Very nice.

The only change I made to this recipe is I used broccoli slaw and cabbage both. It was awesome. I served it at a bridal shower we're 22 of some of the best cooks we're attending. Everyone raved about it :-) I will most certainly make it again.

I was looking for a quick slaw recipe.  Substituted 1 tbsp Dijon mustard and used 2 tbsp honey with pre cut cabbage. Loved the flavour!  Looking forward to making this whole recipe!

Note: I'm rating the dressing.  The dressing was easy and tasty (didn't have honey mustard so went with some fancy mustard I did have).  Threw in some raisins and shredded cheese and it worked very well.

Made recipe as instructed and the results were amazing! What a wonderful change from traditional coleslaw. The crunch from the almonds and sweetness of the cranberries work well together. I took the dish to a family function and everyone was lined up to split the leftovers to take home. This will definitely have a permanent spot in my side dish rotation. Thank Mike!

We all loved this coleslaw.  The combination of vegetables and the dressing was perfect.  The cranberries added a different flavour element as compared with other salads of this type.  I will certainly make it again.

I really love this recipe, the toasted almonds are the best part. My only comment is that you cannot make it much more than 12 hours ahead as bottom ingredients will get soggy.

WOW!  This is special Mike!  It's mid-August now and I was starting to get tired of my favorite "creamy" coleslaw dressings that I've saved from this site and looked for something new for 2016.  This is a winner - all those different tastes - almonds, dried cranberries, red pepper, etc.  It has mayo but not tons of it and the addition of the honey /mustard flavor was a treat.  The mustard flavor was noticed but not overpowering which we all liked.  You could adjust that upwards if you wanted.  This coleslaw is good with anything but would be impressive as a side for a fancy dinner too.  Also really easy - not as time intensive as I thought it would be.  I preheated a small skillet, added the almonds and would shake the skillet on occasion for the next 5 minutes.  Keeping an eye on that I prepared the coleslaw.  Thanks again Mike!

Took it to a party and got rave reviews.   Since I am a divorced male, several people thought I bought it from Wegmans or Whole Foods.   Will definitely make it again!

Followed the recipe and I loved it!  It’s my 2nd night in a row making it and I want it again!  Toasting the silvered almonds is a must.  I did leave them out of the main salad and just topped individual bowls to keep the nuts crunchy.  It was so easy to toss together and mostly staple ingredients.

I made this for a family dinner tonight and it was a huge hit. Made exactly as stated except added some extra mayo to the dressing to soften the flavour of the honey mustard. I will definitely make this again.

Exceptional. A new favorite! Do not go light on the Basil. That’s the best part. I used the dehydrated basil from the produce section.  I also used closer to 8-9 cups of cabbage and a little extra celery, red pepper and green onion and I actually preferred this ratio. It’s a crowd pleaser. I had many people ask for this recipe. Great job thanks!

I made this for the 4th of July and was prepared not to like it because it was so different from any slaw we had made before. But my wife loves dried cranberries so I added it to the menu and was shocked. Every person who came to our festivities raved about it without being asked. Of all the dishes we had,  old and new recipes, the slaw got the most raves. Lesson: be more open minded and eat more dried cranberries. One suggestion, stir the toasted almonds in just before serving to preserve the toasty crunch.

I made the slaw to go with burgers and another night for brisket.  It was the best slaw I've ever made.  It got rave reviews.  I didn't have honey mustard but added more honey with regular mustard.  Superb!  It's a keeper for my crew!

I served this to family and friends on the 4th of July and got many compliments.  Will definitely make it again but next time I'll cut the dried cranberries to 1 cup, it was a bit sweet for my taste.  Everyone loved the complexities of this coleslaw!

Loved this recipe as did our guests! I doubled the recipe and did find that the honey mustard made it quite sweet so added a tbsp of white vinegar which worked! I used canned baked beans and was not sure whether I should be draining off the liquid in the can...I did not drain but would be interested to hear whether this should have been done! Many thanks!!
