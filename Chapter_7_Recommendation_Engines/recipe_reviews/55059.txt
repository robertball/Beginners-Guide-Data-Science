I added another can of undrained tomatoes plus two cups of water, basil and thyme.  The soup tasted good and was very healthy.

I made this pretty much as written, substituting orzo for the acini di pepe.  It makes a very thick soup, very good for a quick pantry dinner.  It could easily be thinned for a more "soup-like" meal.

Great soup!  I only had 1 can of beans, so it wasn't as thick as originally stated, but it was still yummy!  I also tossed in some veggies (carrots, celery, yellow squash, & zucchini) that I needed get rid of, as well as some garlic.  I love thick soups, so I definitely want to make this again with the extra can of beans to make it thicker!  Rather than mashing 1/2 of the beans in a food processor, I just put my beans into a small Ziplock baggie & rolled my can of tomatoes over the bag until they were mashed.  Very easy...and no cleanup!

ADD LIQUID! Otherwise awesome! I loved loved loved this soup. However, after reading the reviews I added two extra cans of tomatoes and one can of chicken broth. Came out a nice thick soup consistency.  I served with with lamb chops but it's definitely hardy enough to stand on it's own with some nice crusty bread. I used whole wheat small shells which is what I had on hand and it was great and also healthy!  I also added roasted minced garlic and a few dashes of hot sauce. I will definitely make this again.

A very appealing recipe that just didn't deliver. It was VERY thick. I had to keep adding water. More a paste than a soup. It also had no 'kick'. I think with garlic, onions, maybe more tomato, it could be better. As is, it could be used as a dip of some sort, but not as a soup.

This was good, for those of us who like garbanzos, but was VERY thick.  We used it as a sidedish, but not until I added a few dashes of hot sauce, another can of the diced tomatoes, and some italian herbs.  I also tried it cold the next day thinking it might make an interesting summer side dish, but we didn't find it very appealing.

This is a very basic soup that's tasty but if you add some veggies it makes it great!!! I had a little bit of a lot of things I needed to use up, I added frozen spinach that was thawed, chopped red pepper, chopped onion, some small zucchinis and used a small swirly pasta. Made this for lunches for the rest of this week, but it was so good I ate the rest for dinner!

I thought this was a good recipe and would definitely make it again. I substituted basil, parsley, thyme for the rosemary(didn't have any) and added extra water. I also didn't go thru the trouble of using a blender to puree the beans, I simply mashed them up like you would for mashed potatoes. Once done I sprinkled parmesan cheese. Light and easy!

When I came to review this recipe I realized I forgot the pasta!  Whoops - but it was great.  I used dry garbanzo beans, 1 lb soaked overnight and cooked in the crock pot all day.  Then I used both 1 can peeled tomatoes and a can of tomato paste as I had more beans.  I also added onion, garlic, celery and carrots and more spices as others have suggested.  When it was about time to eat I blended it a bit with my hand held blender - about half the beans were chopped into small grains, a very nice texture.  Is it the same recipe?  Not exactly but it was wonderful.  This recipe is a great place to start.  I've never made soup with garbanzos before but I will again.

Wicked good.  Reminded me of SpaghettiOs, but tasty.  Super thick, which is one reason I liked it so much.  Dried rosemary works fine.  We also used orzo instead of acini di pepe pasta.

Good flavor but this is not soup.  I'd also say...puree all the garbanzo if you're wanting soup.  I added 2 cups of water and doubled tomatoes * rosemary and it was still bone dry.  Still a decent pantry ready recipe.

This was excellent hearty (thick) soup, even when I added chicken broth.  I added onion and garlic to the olive oil and cooked in  soup pot before adding tomatoes.  I added italian seasoning and used orichetti pasta since that is what I had on hand. I added one generous squirt of hot sauce.  My husband loved it.

I used this recipe as a guide, adding onion, leek, celery, garlic, green peas, corn niblets, basil, 4 cups of vegetable broth, and substituting rotini pasta. It was a hit with my whole family.

This recipe looks very good, but the photo clearly shows other ingredients like celery and maybe carrots.  I will definitely add onions and garlic.  It needs some oomph.

I made this exactly as written - except I did not add the pasta because the beans have enough carbs.  I added some diced chicken thigh meat and added one link of chorizo and it was absolutely delicious.  I also added more water as others have to make it not as thick.  My husband devoured it and wants me to make this again.  It freezes well too so next time I will make double batches and freeze it and use it on a cold winter night when I don't feel like cooking much.

As written this soup is good. I use ditalini instead of acini. As per Italian tradition, I suggest adding "soffritto" or mirepoix. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great base recipe. If made according to this recipe, the soup is extremely thick and bland. I decided to change it up. I added sauteed white onion, garlic, spicy sausage and zucchini. I also added another can of tomatoes and chicken broth. I left out the pasta, but had cooked brown rice for those that wanted it. I only used salt and pepper to season.

Wow, this is really good. And super quick to make. I substituted Italian seasoning for the rosemary though just because I don't care for rosemary.

Homemade Spaghetti-O's. Yech!  So not special.  I added a few tablespoons of minced dried onions at the beginning, and had to keep adding water to try and have enough water for the pasta, which still stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I couldn't add enough Salt and Pepper, and I added quite a bit of garlic powder.  Oh, and I served with Parmesan and Mozzarella sprinkled on top.

I only tried this recipe because it was the only thing that used Acini Di Pepe that wasn't sweet, or just didn't look appetizing, and I'm afraid this only looked good to me because I LOVE garbanzo's, which did nothing to redeem this.  Oh and because I had a #10 can of tomatoes.  The rest will go towards a nice homemade chili.

This only gets 3 stars because it happened to be a home run with all of my kids.  Who'd have guessed?  Next time however, I'll save myself 30 minutes and just dump a can of beans into O's, and open a can of something yummy for me.

Despite the positive reviews, I found it bland and uninteresting.  I used a clove of garlic (blended with the garbanzos), dried rosemary, and omitted the pasta as I didn’t have anything appropriate on hand.  I don’t think any of these changes made an important difference.  I’ll probably use the rest as a pasta sauce, maybe adding some olives, or something to give it a stronger flavor.
