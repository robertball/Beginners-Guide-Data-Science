Before making this recipe I read most of the reviews.  Here is what I did to infuse flavor into the cauliflower.  I cut the cauliflower into bite-size pieces and simmered it in chicken broth until tender crisp, drained it, then tossed the cauliflower with the bread crumb topping.  I transfered the whole mixture to a buttered casserole.  Drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of Locatelli Romano cheese.  Positively DELICIOUS, everyone LOVED it, and no leftovers!

Best cauliflower ever!!! I tested this out on just the 2 of us - cooking it whole - I was skeptical on how it would be to serve.  TRY IT - it is really easy and I think will definitely be a conversation piece at the table.  My guy looooved it!  I followed recipe exactly except I took the suggestions of other submitters and brushed the butter on the caulifower and then added the dry crumbs mixed with seasonings.  It adhered easily.  When it comes out of the oven - just put it on a plate and serve it with a spoon - it is so tender. P.S.  I steamed mine hrs. in advance and when the roast was almost done put on the final touches and popped it in the oven.  This is a KEEPER!!  Thanks submitter!

I have made this recipe twice and loved it! The first time I also had a little trouble getting the bread coating to stick to the sides. That was a little disappointing cause the presentation would be much improved with a nice, over all golden coating. The second time I made it I used a bar-b-que marinade brush and brushed melted butter over the entire head and THEN coated it. PROBLEM SOLVED! Great presentation! My husband LOVES it!!

I used the suggestion of another member and cut the cauliflower into pieces and then simmered it in chicken broth until tender.  I then drained it, tossed it with the mixture and baked as directed.  It was a HUGE hit!  My husband ate all but the one serving that I ate at dinner tonight!  Great recipe!!!

The secret to having cauliflower with flavor is steaming/simmering it in chicken broth. Then put it in the oven with the breadcrumb mixture. Yummmmmmmy!

This is the most delicious recipe I've ever tried. I took the advice of one of the reviewers, and cut the head into large pieces. I "steamed" it in the microwave. It was hard to get the mixture to stick, so on my second try (the head was big enough to make two "cookings")I melted  the butter and drizzled it over the cauliflower. Then I mixed the remaining ingredients together & sprinkled them over before baking.This worked well and came out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this!  I cut up & micro steamed the cauliflower (in  a pampered chef micro steamer) which took minutes then baked it....YUM!  I will next time drizzle the butter and then the bread crumbs as others have suggested, but the taste of the end result is ohh so yummy!  Thanks Ariela!!

This was beautiful and delicious. I chose to prepare this whole and it made a beautiful presentation (check out the photo I submitted). This is what I did to make it turn out really beautiful and coated all over: Steamed as directed in recipe. Then I mixed all the dry ingredients(no butter) in a large cereal bowl. I sprayed the steamed cauliflower head with cooking spray then placed it upside down in the cereal bowl mixture. I used a spoon to press the mixture around the rest of the head. I placed it back right side up on a pie pan and gave it another spray all over to help it get crispy then cooked as directed. Delicious and a little healthier from omitting the butter :-)

Hooray...I have found a new way to prepare cauliflower.  My hubby and I love veggies, and cauliflower is at the top of our list.  Steaming and stir-frying were getting old, but this is my favorite new way to prepare it.  I absolutely love this.  Can't say much for the kids.  I don't think my four year old would even touch this if I drowned it in chocolate, but he's like that with everything. I too cut mine into florets and poured the butter over and sprinkled on the rest. I'm looking forward to making this one again. Thanks so much Ariela.

Although the cauliflower took a long time to steam, we really enjoyed this dish. Even the veggie-haters at our table were impressed.

I served this dish for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it:~)The flavor was excellent. 
I will however make a few changes next time as the crumb topping did not want to stay on the cauliflower head. If it's steamed a little more, the florettes pried open and the crumb mixture sprinkled inside as well as on top and use little more butter I think they should stick.

I swayed just a tad from making this recipe as written. I was after a healthier version of fried cauliflower that I love so much and won't make because of the fat content.  I mixed all the dry ingredients in a small bowl. I cut my cauliflower into bite size pieces and cooked for about 4 minutes until tender crisp. I then put the cauliflower in a Ziploc bag and added olive oil and tossed to coat. I added the dry ingredients to the bag and coated all the cauliflower. Baked until crispy, which took about 20-30 minutes.  It was a very good alternative to the fried cauliflower. I will adjust the seasonings to my taste the next time. I did add more parmesan cheese to the top of the finished product (Yum). All in all this is a very easy and tasty way to make cauliflower.

Great for the cauliflower lover. The topping was more like a dusting.. Did not "stick".

Very good.  I separated the cauliflower into florets, microwaved them for 8 minutes, and then coated w/the butter/breadcrumb mixture and cooked in the oven for about 15 minutes.  The breadcrumb mixture was DELICIOUS and I'll use the recipe for other veggies.  Yum!

I was a little disappointed in this.  I read the prior reviews, and followed the frequent suggestion of brushing melted butter onto the cauliflower and then dredging it through the crumb mixture, rather than just mixing the butter in with the crumbs.  However, even having done that, the crumbs didn't stick well.  Maybe a light eggwash would help?  Also, I steamed my cauliflower an extra 10 minutes and baked it an extra 5, but it was still a little tough.  I might try this again, cutting it up instead of serving it whole -- but that does seem to defeat the purpose a bit!

Like many of the other reviewers, I cut my cauliflower up into small florets first.  I put into a pot and added a can of chicken broth.  Covered and boiled for about 10 minutes - or until they were just tender, but not mushy.  Stir occasionally to check the doneness.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I used closer to 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese (from a can).  I probably added a bit more garlic powder.  I used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes and left out the oregano.  I probably also increased it to 1/2 - 1 tsp of salt also. I melted the butter and tossed everything together and put it in a pan to bake.  After about 10 minutes in the oven, I stirred it to expose the other side of the cauliflower and then put back in for about 5 minutes.  It needed just a bit more browing, so I stuck it under the broiler for a minute at the end. **I had a hard time imagining what this was going to taste like.  I have to say the closest thing I can think of is maybe the breadsticks from CiCi's Pizza.  They are soft, and you can really taste the italian seasoning, the garlic, and the parmesan.  It was only on the larger florets that I even got much cauliflower taste at all.

GREAT side! Everyone asked "What is it?" and then loved it! Looked and tasted great! I only steamed for 15 min and next time I will try 10-12. I substituted a great Italian seasoning mix plus a few red pepper flakes for all herbs. I also mixed 2.5 tbsps soft butter into the topping and then gave the steamed cauliflower a good drizzle of olive oil before patting on the crust.

This was good.  I read the reviews regarding the breading not sticking and found that if you follow the recipe and add the melted butter to the breadcrumbs and mix thoroughly, then brush the cauliflower itself with melted butter, there is no problem with the breadcrumbs sticking as you will see from my picture.  The biggest problem I had was getting the cauliflower steamed in the first place.  It took more than 40 minutes to get it tender.  Glad I started off a little early.

We like cauliflower here, but this was so yummy! I used olive oil instead of butter a combination of the seasoned bread crumbs & some Panko & a bit more seasoning, as we are into spicy food here.  I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the top after I had mixed everything else  together & it was in the baking dish. I did pre steam the florets in the micro in a steaming bag, as that cuts down dthe cooking time. A great dish thati will definetely be making again. Thanks, Ariela for a new recipe & I will be sharing it w/the neighbor who grew the cauliflower.

This was great!!!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It was a bit hard to serve whole because we had dinner buffet style so we were holding plates and juggling food around but we managed.  I followed the suggestion from other reviewers and steamed it before hand and placed it in the oven to bake right before it was served and I also buttered the cauliflower first and then added the seasoned bread crumbs.  It really looked nice on a pretty serving plate, was innexpensive to make and I will definitely make it often.

Let's just say I love this recipe and leave it at that!

I've made this recipe 4-5x which is many times.  I tried to cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces, but it's a bit messier.  The more 'topping' the better and you will turn non-believers into cauliflower lovers!

I made two cauliflower recipes tonight. My husband picked this one as his favorite. I found it tough to get the crumbs to stick to hot cauliflower. I didn't read the recipe through when I saved it to realize you basically cook it on the stove and then bake it. My fault.

I did alter this recipe because I didn't have a steamer. I cut up the cauliflower, blanched, and continued cooking as is. Next time, I would love to see the final result of a whole baked cauliflower. It was tasty but my final product turned out too mushy.

Very quick and tasty way to fix cauliflower!  Followed advice of other reviewers and cut head into pieces, precooked 3 minutes in microwave, tossed pieces with melted butter and topped with crumb mixture..but only used half (seemed to be an overly abundant amount of topping for the amount of cauliflower I had). Baked for approximately 20 minutes and it was fantastic.  Will certainly make again.

Very good recipe, although I used 1 tsp of garlic powder for a large head of cauliflower, and I added 1/4 cup of olive oil (it was a big head!).  There was none left over, and the aroma made the house smelled FANTASTIC!!!

Nice presentation although I believe it would taste better if the cauliflower was cut up and the topping was sprinkled on top.  I had trouble getting the topping to stick to the sides of the whole cauliflower.  Instead of bread crumbs I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing.  I will try again.

It seems like an awful lot of work and my family just thought it was mediocre, but we do enjoy just steaming our cauliflower and eating it with a little salt and pepper... we would rather just do that from now on but this was worth a try, I mean any decent recipe is worth trying at least once :)

My family is not cauliflower eaters, but we ended up with a head of it, so I tried this. It was a hit! everyone ate it - except the picky-two-year-old. I ended up using less margarine than called for and it was still good. Next time I think I will omit the red pepper, may help the 2-yr-old.

I made it exactly how the recipe reads and the taste was amazing but in order to make serving it easier I will cut the cauliflower into florets next time. Same flavor, less mess!

Very good! Crunchy cauliflower with bread crumbs, garlic powder, olive oil, parmesan and mozzarella cheese.

I baked it in a silicon dish, which made the clean up much easier.

Will try the same with broccoli, I guess itwill probably be as tasty.

Thank you for sharing (:

I did rate this recipe five stars based on revisions, so if you are looking for a review of the recipe as is, skip this review. To be honest, I come on here to find recipes because I want to make something that tastes good, and if enough reviewers write that a recipe is too bland, spicy, not cooked right, etc. I'm not going to waste my previous time and resources to make a recipe "as is" just to have the opportunity to review it in it's original form - I'm here to make the best dish possible. That said, I followed the first reviewer's advice to cut up and precook the cauliflower in chicken broth, followed by baking at 375 in a buttered pan with Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and olive oil. Since the cauliflower was as cooked as I needed it on the stove top, I really only left it in the oven for 2-3 minutes to melt the cheese and help the flavors set. This was definitely delicious and a keeper! Will make this again and again.

This turned out better than I had expected. I followed the recipe exactly just leaving out the red pepper flakes, because I do not care for them. I ended up having the cauliflower in the water for 30 minutes though, to get it tender all the way through. If I made it again I would more likely make my own seasoned bread crumbs, because the store bought ones are just really salty to me. I would also probably use a lite or whipped butter for personal reasons. After the cauliflower was baked, I realized that it had to be served out of the pan because it got a little messy when cut into. Much of the bread crumbs fall into the pan when it is cut. I would even suggest using half the bread crumbs as most of them do fall off. I did like the concept of cooking the whole cauliflower at one time though.

So I made this tonight for dinner and I have to say it was delicious.  I think it could have been better if I didn't add extra breadcrumbs and extra everything.  I was starving while I was preparing and of course thought, "gee, if 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs is good, then 1 whole cup will be better.   WRONG!  I had two other sides and I really should have followed the directions exactly and kept it more of a dusting.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but also too much.  The taste of the cauliflower was lost because of it.  I'll definitely make this again, only this time I'll try not to be so over the top with all the ingredients.  Oh, I also steamed pieces as opposed to the whole head.  Had to use just water with some salt, because I didn't have chicken stock.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not really a cauliflower fan but this was easy to prepare & quite tasty. I cut back the butter to 1/2 and I used chicken broth as suggested. My family loved it too. I'll make this again.

On the whole, this was good and made an impressive presentation.  But it needs to cook much longer than what is stated, as mine ended up being still rather raw in the middle.  It would also need to be cooked at a slightly lower temp to keep it from burning.  The other issue is that it's difficult to make the topping stick, especially on the sides, and it falls off easily when cutting.  Even though you wouldn't get the "wow" factor with presentation, it would probably be easier to cut it up into florets, sprinkle the topping over it, and then cook.  It will cook more evenly and you will get more of the topping in each bite.

We made this recipe as another reviewer had suggested. We simmered florettes in chicken broth, then covered with bread crumb mixture (shaken in a bag). My husband can't have dairy, so I put the cheese only on half. After baking, we also sprinkled with malt vinegar. It was very good. Definitely will make again! Thanks to the submitter and other reviewers!

I would have given this four stars, except the 20-minute steaming time turned the head of cauliflower into mush. The topping was great, however, so next time I make this, I'll keep the steaming part of the recipe down to ten minutes.

I thought this recipe was great.  I made it as written.  Some of the topping didn't stick to the sides of the full head of cauliflower like some other people mentioned, but it really didn't matter.  I just left it in the bottom of the cassarole dish.  When it was time to serve the veggie, I just scooped out some of the topping too.  It didn't taste any different than the cauliflower baked with the topping on it.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I broke the cauliflower up into pieces and steamed it. I used Earth Balance margarine in place of butter. I put the steamed cauliflower in a casserole dish, and sprinkled the breadcrumbs on top and tossed everything together. It was a tasty dish and much healthier than one that uses cheese sauce. This will become a frequent way to prepare this dish. Thanks!!!

Very tasty. Others are right, break into bite-sized pieces, drizzle with butter then combined bread crumbs and spices. Makes a great casserole.

I love this recipe! I could just eat this alone as a meal. The flavor is excellent. I have made this for several holiday dinners and it has always been a big hit. Even if you don't like cauliflower, you will probably like this. I did chop the cauliflower up into bite sized pieces in my casserole dish. Then sprinkled the bread crumb mixture over it.

My family loved this recipe, including my husband, who only eats broccoli raw with ranch dressing. I separated the head, poured the butter over the flowers, and then sprinkled the topping all over it. It was much easier to serve that way and everyone enjoyed it.

Delicious!  I made the whole process easier by microwaving the cauliflower for 8 minutes (with a bit of water in the bowl).  To make it healthier, I cut up the cauliflower into large pieces and placed them on a roasting pan.  I sprayed them with canola oil PAM and sprinkled them with the bread crumb mixture (in which I omitted all of the butter).  Tasted great!

Had a similar dish at a 5-start restaurant in Chicago several years ago, and have been looking for a good recipe. THIS IS IT! However, I used butter, not margarine, one large clove minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, and omitted the salt. The Kraft grated cheese I used gave it enough salty flavor. I basted the steamed cauliflower head with the garlic butter, then used the remainder of the butter to mix all the other ingredients together before pressing onto the cauliflower head. I think next time I will steam it for only 10 minutes, since I don't like it so mushy. Also, I used a quiche baker to help dry out some of the liquid from the steaming. THANK YOU THANK YOU!

I steamed this for closer to 30 minutes, but it was a pretty big head of cauliflower. Brushed it with melted butter, then patted the seasoned crumb mixture over it, then baked.  Really a fabulous looking presentation, and yummy -- even my cauliflower-hating daughter liked it!

Yum! I used this recipe as a guide. I used two cauliflower heads, cut into florets and stems and steamed for a few minutes. Then I put them in a 9X13 baking dish, covered with sour cream, and sprinkled the parm cheese, bread crumbs, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes. I didn't use any butter or margarine. This is how we like it.... it's like a savory pudding. :) Tasty.

Yummy!  I'm not a cauliflower fan, but I thought this was delicious.  My preschooler ate it up and my husband went back for seconds.  I was disappointed there weren't any leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Superb! I cut the cauliflower into pieces, cooked it (until a little soft) in salt water, coated with olive oil and then with seasoned bread crumbs. I baked it for over 30 mins so it came out crispy. Yummy!!

Make a mixture of mayo and mustard. 3 to 1 depending on size of head of cauliflower, it'a an eyeball, taste thing.  More mayo and a touch of mustard, like devil eggs.  After you steam, spread with the mayo/mustard and proceed with recipe. There will be no leftovers.

I followed others suggestions and broke up the cauliflower.  It was GREAT !! I've made it four times in the last month.  Even my kids (10 and 14) who are pretty pickey eaters liked it.  I even tried mixed veggies (frozen bag) one time and everyone liked that too.  So it's a hit and stored in my recipe box.

This was very yummy.  I used cauliflowerettes and steamed it in my microwave.  I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and skipped the oregano and red pepper flakes,  put every thing in a bowl and just tossed together, then baked it in a 9X13 dish.  Husband really liked it I will make again

Excellent way to eat cauliflower!!!  I did the cauliflower into bite-sized pieces.
The only thing that I changed, is a garlic clove instead the garlic powder.
Thank you for this nice recipe.

This recipe offers a nice alternative to your traditional steamed cauliflower, but I would cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces and prepare in a shallow dish so every bite has some topping on it.

I made this for my daughter and I last night. We ate the whole head! It was so good. I had some trouble getting the crumbs to stick but I waited until the head had cooled and used my hands and pressed the mixture into the head. I'm sure we will be eating this often.

This was a nice way to prepare cauliflower.  No one in my family cares for cauliflower so I am always on the lookout for a new way to make it.  I cut the head into small peices and mixed that and all the other ingredients in a large bowl, then baked as directed.  Gave each bite a good amount of coating.  Will make again!

Sometimes I get a little crazy with modifications, so I decided I'd listen to the "experts" and try this ALMOST as written.  I steamed the whole cauli with chicken broth for a bit longer than called for, and baked it a bit longer than called for.  The crumb mixture, altho tasty by itself, didn't stick; the cauli was way undercooked and very dry.  Even when I continued baking it until it had a nice texture, it was still almost flavorless.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this! I did have to make a few adjustments to fit my needs (I didn't have a steamer or store bought bread crumbs). First I broke the head into smaller pieces and sauteed them in chicken broth as was suggested by another user. In the meantime, I toasted two slices of bread and then broke them into little pieces and sprinkled Italian Seasoning onto them. I mixed the remaining spices with the bread crumbs and then combined this with the drained cauliflower. I then poured it all into a casserole dish and then drizzled the melted butter over it and covered it all with Parmesan cheese. The more cheese the better!

I really like cauliflower and my husband hates it.  So I thought, given the high reviews here, I give this recipe a shot.  I took some advice and simmered the cut-up cauliflower in chicken broth.  It was really yummy, and probably should've just stopped right there.  But I went ahead with the breading and baking.  It tasted like cauliflower with breadcrumbs.  I was not wow-ed by this and my husband definitely did not like this either.  Won't be making this again.

I overcooked the cauliflower when I steamed them and had to wait for oven space. I did not have sesame oil. The end result was mushy but nice tasting.

Bread crumbs definitely didn't stick to the cauliflower.   Second time around, I cut up the cauliflower before steaming, placed in baking dish, added bread crumb mixture and topped off with shredded mozzarella, provolone, asiago, parmesan, romano and fontina (Thanks to Sargento).

Wow, this was great. Took another's suggestion and cut into smaller pieces & steamed with 1/4 chicken broth. Put in ziplock & dredged with olive oil then put in the dry mixture & baked for 20 - 30 minutes. It was FABULOUS! Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out great (my husband  and I ate an entire head by ourselves!).  I used panko bread crumbs and olive oil instead of the butter.  Will make again!

Very Nice! I followed the top suggestions and broke the cauliflower up a bit. This way, there was more surface area exposed to the seasoning/bread crumb mix. I will definitely make this again!

This topping is delicious.  I did substitute saltine cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs, but otherwise I made this as written.  I prepared this crumb topping to go on a Romanesco broccoli that was in our CSA box.  I should have steamed the broccoli longer (it was huge) because it was quite under-done...even though the topping was brown...but it was very good nonetheless.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipes - can't get enough of the "toppings"! I've made it using a whole cauliflower, and another using cauliflower florets. I preferred the latter option because I think the topping coats the cauliflower better when it's chopped up. (ie, more surface area)

Wonderful, easy, and delicious! I "steamed" the whole head in the microwave to save time, but it cooked unevenly and took too long. Next time I'll go with the chicken broth suggestion. The coating was delicious, and I'll bet it could be used on a variety of other veggies too. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I liked the ease of just throwing the whole thing in the oven instead of cutting it all up.  I did coat mine with olive oil instead of butter.

Wonderful recipe! My husband offered to wash the dishes if I go and give this recipe 5 stars. Who knew a good cauliflower recipe was the way to a man's heart. I did have to cut the cauliflower in half. I followed the recipe as submitted.

I made this the way others suggested by chopping up the cauliflower etc.  My bf is vegan so I used veg. broth to simmer it in and didn't use cheese on his half.  Honestly, I think it was equally yummy on both halves, so don't be afraid to make this without it.  The butter and breadcrumb mix gives it plenty of flavor.

Very good! I had already washed and cut my cauliflower before finding this recipe, so I prepared it that way. 

I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave.
I used progresso garlic breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese.
I used no butter.
Instead, I sprayed the cauliflower with pam, then dredged it in the breadcrumbs. Then I placed it on a baking dish and sprayed pam over the cauliflower again (coating the breadcrumbs). I baked it until it was crisp. YUM! I will make it again.

So Delicious and perfect for a holiday table.  I've been trying to come up with the perfect veggie side dish to bring for Thanksgiving.  This is the winner!

I DID NOT cut up the cauliflower.  It's so pretty whole and if you stand it up in the right size bowl, it's lovely on the table.  You have to really press the breadcrumbs mixture into the cauliflower and get it into all the crevices.  I think it falls off when the cauliflower is not properly steamed.  It needs to steam a long time-but be careful it doesn't get soggy.

Yum!  Thank you.

I kind of took advice from a bunch of reviews, that's what I love about allrecipes.  I steamed it in chicken broth, boiled it cut up for 10 minutes and added mayonnaise and dijon to the bread crumb mix.  Then, I brushed butter on the top of the cauliflower, but I probably wouldn't do that again.  I had to pat the mixture with my hands because there was no way it was just going to spread.  WOW!  my son has no idea he had vegetables...

I too brushed the butter directly on the cauliflower.  We don't particulary care that much for cauliflower, but WOW we loved it this way.  This is definitely "a keeper".

This recipe has a lot of potential.  Five stars for presentation, three and a half for flavor.  I steamed the cauliflower in broth made with a lot of chicken granules and that seemed to help with the blandness but not enough.  I also doubled all the spices in the bread crumb mixture but it still needed more.  Like others, I brushed the butter on first then packed the topping on and drizzled the butter that was left over top.  Next time, I'll season the butter with extra garlic powder, black pepper, and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  It needs something to liven it up, not make it spicy.

Easy recipe for cauliflower.  Next time I will probably follow the advice of others to mix the bread crumb mixture with the cauliflower broken up and pour the melted butter/margarine over the top.

This was Great!  I made a few changes.  I cut the cauliflower up into large pieces before I steamed it, substituted 2 tablespoons of olive for the margarine and mixed it before placing it in a baking dish sprayed with vegetable spray.  I also left out the red pepper so my kids would eat it and boy did they ever.  This will be a staple in our house.

I found this recipe on this site 2 years ago and have made it many times since.  I do steam the florets just until tender crisp, then place in baking dish, brush with melted butter and sprinkle seasonings on.  Even my children like it.  Be sure not to overcook the cauliflower in the first step!

This was very good. I couldn't get enough of it. We had it with turkey wings, and it went well. For ease of preparation and serving, I cut it into chunks. We added more cheese and plain dry breadcrumbs, and a bit of dried basil. Any seasoning you like can be added in, really. I just wish it wasn't so soggy. A crispier crust would've been nicer, but it was still delish.

This needs a bit of work but has great potential.  The crust tastes wonderful but there needs to be a way to inject flabour and moisture into the cauliflower itself.  The presentation is great but next time I will break it up and see if that works better.  I doubled the crust recipe and that is a must.

Excellent! We really liked this recipe! You'll want to turn down the cauliflower to low heat while steaming - if you leave it at medium heat you'll have mush - and it won't take 20 minutes - you'll have to watch it! Used more garlic than it called for. The bread crumb mixture is a wet mixture, which makes it easy to pat or spoon onto the cauliflower. To help the bread crumbs stick, we took some butter and melted it on the top and then used our hands and placed the crumbs onto the head of cauliflower, patting down slightly. They stuck well! Very tasty, and was delicious! Sprinkled lightly with parmesan before serving! (I used wheat-free bread crumbs and you couldn't tell!)

Lol.. my kids walked into the kitchen and saw this big thing I had just pulled from the oven and said "Mom, What's THAT???"  They love their cauliflower, and boy did they inhale it.  After they finished, they all ran up to the stove to see if there were any "seconds"... but it was already gone.
I steamed mine in the microwave, and it turned out great.  Had a little trouble getting the crumb mixture to stick to the surface, just had to work with it a little.  I served it as a side to the "Easy Caramelized Onion Pork Chops" recipe on this site.  It made a very nice family meal.

Wonderful flavor & I hate cauliflower.  It now is a house favorite and specifically requested. I also brush w/butter and then pat on seasoned crumbs.  It always brings Oohs and Ahhs when brought to the table even when they've seen and smelled it being prepared.  Simple,Healthy and Good tasting = Absolute winner in Veggie category

This was good, but the topping was a little tricky.  It was hard to get the breadcrumb topping to stick.  I think next time I will break the head into pieces and sprinkle the topping over it.

Very good, a pleasant change from Cauliflower with cheese sauce.  I broke the cauliflower into florets before steaming.  I used freshly grated parmesan and might add a little more next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We love cauliflower and this was great!! I took MRSTIGGY'S suggestion and poured the butter over the veggie first and then added the bread crumb mixture (which I added a little olive oil and my own seasonings) I also cut the cauliflower into pieces which definitely made it much easier to serve. If there had been enough, I would have been happy just eating this for dinner. Cool beans Ariela!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got raves!  My mother was skeptical when I told her I was making it but couldn't stop eating it!  I like cooking it whole but I had a hard time getting the mix to stick on the cauliflower, maybe next time I'll make it a little more moist.  Otherwise it was perfect as is!

I cut the cauliflower in half and simmered/steamed it in a closed pot of chicken broth.  Then transferred the cooked cauliflower to a baking dish.  I re-used the pot to melt the butter and add the other seasonings.  Chopped the cooked cauliflower up into smaller pieces in the baking dish and then tossed in the breadcrumb mixture.  I'm not sure now how much extra the chickenbroth added. Next time (for sure there will be a next time) I think I'll use the same cooking technique but with just water.  This was delicious but I did end up adding a little extra garlic salt and oregano sprinkled on top before eating.

It was ok. Most of the crumb topping fell off, leaving me with plain cauliflower.

Great recipe.  My grandmother used to make green beans like this, I make brussel sprouts this way, didn't think of adapting it to cauliflower.  One change I make - I use olive oil in place of the margarine.

I made this using a bag of frozen “California mix” vegetables (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower).  I cooked them in chicken broth until tender and used no salt in the breadcrumb mix.  The mix didn’t stick to the veggies very well, so as suggested next time I'll try pouring melted butter on top and then adding the breadcrumb mixture.  My guests added parmesan individually, since one person can't eat cheese.  These veggies were outstanding, and the side dish was easy to prepare. The one bad thing about this recipe?  My oven broke shortly after I made it, and now I can't satisfy the craving!  :oD

Great recipe.  I've done a similar recipe with balsamic vinegar and I separated the cauliflower into florets first.  It takes a couple extra minutes but the seasoning gets more evenly distributed.  Breadcrumbs were great =3

Thought this was good. I cut the cauliflower in half and placed in a 9x9 glass baking dish with a couple tsp of water. Put saran wrap over and microwaved for about 5 minutes (until tender). Meanwhile I mixed up the bread crumbs. I used unseasoned crumbs and added extra garlic powder, salt, pepper, thyme, oregano, dill, and kept the same amount of red pepper flakes. Followed the directions for everything else (prep wise). Turned out great and very flavorful. Will make again!

Love this recipe and have made it twice. First time, I followed the recipe and it tasted good but something just wasn't right (the margarine/breadcrumbs were clumpy and wouldn't stick to the cauliflower). Took people's suggestions on breaking it apart after steaming, tossing in a freezer bag with olive oil and then adding the breadcrumb mixture after and it was so much better. I added additional spices to the breadcrumb mixture to give it more taste. My picky eater husband loves it and asked me to write down exactly what I did so I can make it "exactly the same" next time.

I made a few changes, and really liked this recipe.  I did steam the cauliflower whole for 20 minutes, as it was quite large.  Afterward, once it had cooled down a little I broke it into pieces and discarded the core.  I put the florets in a large bowl and mixed in enough olive oil to coat the pieces, about 1 Tb oregano, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, also adding about 1 Tb dried onion flakes; it really needed more spices!  I added the breadcrumbs and cheese and spread it out in a baking dish, covering the top with shredded mozzarella.  I baked it at 375 for probably 20 minutes until the cheese started to brown.  So I took out the butter, but added more cheese!

It's Addictive - Makes it much easier to get my recommended servings of veggies.  Per suggestion of others,  broke into bite sized pieces, simmered in chicken broth,drizzled with melted butter, tossed  Panko crumbs & bakeed per recipe.  Even if some crumbs did fall off,  they are mighty tasty.

My family LOVED this.  I did break into bite size pieces, boil in chicken broth till tender crisp.  I used broccoli with the cauliflower.  Really good!  I used extra red pepper and it had a kick.  Good warm or cold.  Will make again.  Very easy too.

This turned out great! The whole family loved it. I did do what some others did and brushed on the butter. Also while steaming it I used chicken boulion cubes in the water to give it extra flavor like others said they did. But I didn't chop it up. I left it whole. It is really neat looking and tastes just as good!!

Smith's was selling purple and orange cauliflower.  I just could resist buying the purple!  It added so much color to the meal.  I brushed melted butter on, then sprinkled the remaining ingredients (which I had mixed together in a bowl) to coat the top.  I baked it without a lid on.  That way you don't have soggy cauliflower and the top will brown nicely.

My butter exploded all over the microwave as I was preparing this so in my panic I didn't do as thorough a job of it as I should have.  Nevertheless, it was very tasty and it does make a lovely presentation.  I'm going to try this again.

Nice presentation for this one.  I made extra breadcrumb mixture cause not all the cauliflower gets the flavour since it is just on top of the head.  This way there were some extra crumbs for the rest of the head.

Followed directions except that I had to dip the cauliflower in egg to get the mix to stick better. Next time I'll do away with the butter and just dip in egg and then bread. It's also healthier. The bread mixture was geat and everyone enjoyed them.....

I cut the cauliflower and simmered it in vegetable broth.  I thought this was fantastic and so did my family.  I will make this again for sure.  

I also think it would be a great dish to bring to a pot luck.

WOW!  This was awesome - thank you for such a good recipe.  Based on others suggestions I did cut up the cauliflower, melted the butter and dipped the cauliflower pieces into the butter, then into the topping.  This worked very well and I had just the right amount of topping.  This is going on my Thanksgiving menu -- thanks again.

I thoght this was a little bland. I think if you cut the cauliflower up and them put on the topping, it would distribute flavor throughout.

You read the reviews, you think "yeah sure, it's so simple it can't be that good and it is only cauliflower, how good could it be?", then you make it and then you have to sit here and write another 5 star review.  Try this recipe, it is so simple and by god it's DELISH!

I loved this recipe, and so did my family.  I read the reviews and made some changes.  I used a bag of frozen cut cauliflower seasoned with garlic salt, and cooked it in the microwave for 7 min. , then poured melted butter on top of the cauliflower, added crumb topping mixture, (I doubled the amount of garlic powder )  I put the parmesan cheese on top of this.  It was delicious!

This was pretty, a great presentation, and great tasting too. I've made it twice so far, and we only had leftovers once because I used a huge amish head of cauliflower that weighed three lbs.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was different, but, very good. Next time I will increase the spices, esp., the garlic powder and the red pepper flakes. I had never found a way for me to like cauliflower, until tonight.My husband loves it raw, not me. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

EXCELLENT!  I didn't boil or steam the cauliflower before throwing it in the oven though, just increased the temp to 425 and cooked for roughly 30 minutes (I also cut the head into florets rather than leaving whole).  Some claimed the cauliflower came out dry, so I added a bit of chicken broth mixed with fresh lemon juice to the pan before throwing it in the oven.  My guy and I chowed this down and he actually liked it better than the cabbage rolls that I served it with.  Thanks for a great variation for cauliflower.  I'll make this one again for sure!

This was realy good. Instead of baking the whole cauliflower head, I cut it up into florets. The recipe still worked very well. I might add more red pepper flakes next time to make it a little spicy.

Read lots of reviews and sprayed the whole cauliflower with cooking spray but it didn't help keep the mixture on very much.  For our taste, used 1/4 t. each of garlic powder and oregano and 1/8 t. red pepper (didn't have flakes).  Very nice mixture of flavors but like others, will break apart cauliflower next time.  Great, different recipe.  The hub isn't a big fan of this veggie but also really liked it this way.  A keeper!

Great recipe.  I wanted to cut down on the fat and calories so I substituted 1/4c water for the margarine.  Between the parmasean and all of the seasonings I definitely did not miss the margarine!  It was very flavorful.  Also, instead of brushing with margarine to make the breadcrumbs stick as some reviewers suggest, I brushed it with a little water and it worked great.

Really good! I love cauliflower and this was a nice change versus all of the cheese-sauce recipes, gross.  Could be low-fat if you sub olive oil for butter.  Will make again.  Oh, and I made it in pieces versus the whole head for ease.

I had a lot of cut up cauliflower & was just looking for an easy recipe to use it up. I really loved this. I steamed the cauliflower, made the bread crumb mixture & tossed it with the cauliflower. This made a very simple and so delicious weeknight recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

I think even with this dish, it will not turn a cauliflower hater into a lover...either you like the stuff or you don't!  It was ok, but cover any vegetable in breadcrumbs and cheese, and it will have the same effect.  I think rather than trying to get the breading to stick, sprinkling it over cut up cauli in a baking dish may have the same taste and be more efficient.

Boiling the cauliflower (or any vegetable) causes it to lose A LOT of its nutrients.  Steaming really is the best method to preserve vitamins and minerals.  Perhaps steaming the cauliflower over seasoned water or broth might give a little more flavor without sacrificing nutrition.

Wow! Nutritious, delicious and easy! I cut it in big chunks, used about 2 Tbsp. butter, brushed it on and sprinkled the rest of the ingredients on top. I omitted the red pepper flakes. There was none left in our family. Tasted almost sweet. Will never hesitate to buy cauliflower again!

Took the suggestions and cut the cauliflower up to steam it, either way works good, although I like the whole head presentation.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS:  MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVES IT THIS WAY! Make a  mixture of about 1/2 cup each of mayo and stone ground mustard.  Bub that over the steamed head and then add the crumb topping and bake it this way.  Tasty!  And not dry.

Excellent!!  I used a 12oz bag of Mann's cauliflower florets, steaming in the bag for 4 minutes then putting them in the baking dish.  Halved the crumb topping, and it was plenty to make a very flavorful side dish.

This recipe has potential.  I made a few alteration, but otherwise the ingredients were good.  The problem was that the topping doesn't penetrate the cauliflower and there is only a little bit of topping per serving.  Maybe my cauliflower was too big though.  The presentation is awesome!

Good springboard recipe.  I didn't even bother trying to serve it whole, but broke it up as suggested by others. Olive oil, and lots of oregano & basil to the breadcrumb & Parmesan mixture, along with a healthy dose of red pepper flakes.  Only steamed cauliflower for 15 mins, then baked the remainder of the time.

Good recipe, but not outstanding.  It was a twist from the traditional steaming, and flavor was pretty good.  It did get my kids to eat cauliflower, though!  I will make it again.

I didn't bother with trying to present this as a whole head of cauliflower.  Just steamed the florets, drizzled them with olive oil and bread crumbs and baked it in a dish.  I liked it, but my husband didn't.  He thought it was salty.  I thought it might have been better if the cauliflower was a little more firm... I might not steam it so much next time.  Very easy to do, and a nice change from my usual plain veggie!

Delicious, delicious, delicious.  This not only tastes great but it is a beautiful presentation.  I did brush the cauliflower with some butter before pressing on the crumb mixture.

This was a good recipe.  I am not a huge fan of cauliflower unless it is swimming in cheese sauce or something, but this is a healthier alternative and is quite tasty.  I did reduce the butter to make it healthier and I also sprinkled the topping over smaller pieces of cauliflower.  I did this only because it happened to kind of fall apart when I tried to remove core and bottom leaves, but liked it that way.  I will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

So good! I cooked as directed but rather than mixing the seasonings as listed, I used a good (Progresso)  Garlic and Herb Seasoned Bread Crumbs to which I added the pinch of red pepper. I will make over and over again!

Modified by cutting the cauliflower in pieces and steamed in microwave for 4 minutes. Placed the steamed cauliflower in a baking dish then poured melted butter over the top and sprinkled the bread mixture over everything. Baked for 15 minutes. Loved the flavor of the breading with the cauliflower.

I made this twice in one week!   I poured the melted butter over the entire head of cauliflower then patted on the dry ingredients and kept scooping up what was in the pan and put back on the cauliflower until all of it was on.  This was so good and the presentation was impressive.   Definitely a hit!

Found that the coating kept falling off.  Had to spoon coating up with cauliflower to get the taste.  The coating had a nice flavour but just did not stick to the vegetable.

Served this to friends at dinner last night and we all loved it.  I steamed the cauliflower whole in the microwave for 10 minutes (next time I will cut into florettes). I seasoned my own Panko flakes with onion flakes, garlic powder, and a pinch of ginger. Followed the rest of the recipe (using butter). Had trouble getting the crumbs to stick (didn't ready other's suggestions first - next time, following the crowd!) I baked it until the crumbs were a deep brown. I am definitely making this again.

Took other's suggestions and cut up cauliflower and then simmered in low-sodium chicken broth.  This was so good and a nice change to cauliflower. My husband loved it!

I made this last night to serve with dinner.   It is very good, however, I agree with some of the other reviewers.  Next time I  will break up the cauliflower into bite size pieces and simmer in chicken broth before placing in a baking dish and topping with the bread crumb mixture.  I will definitely be making this dish again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Cauliflower is my husband's favorite vegetable, but my least favorite. We both enjoyed this dish, so that says something. Easy and tasty!
I brushed on the butter and then added topping, and it stayed on just fine. Only change I made was to substitute 1/2 tsp thyme for the crushed red pepper because my daughter has no tolerance for spicy food.

I made this with salmon and carmelized carrots. I liked it. I think next time I will break the head up or cut it into slices. Then make more topping and bread it that way.

We made this just like the recipe called for but left out the oregano and used seasoned breadcrumbs. It was delicious. The only thing I think I would do differently is steam it a little less time. I think it would be better a bit crunchier. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll brush with melted butter first then add the bread crumb mixture. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy and easy to make. Serves best at table side (cut large sections apart first and serve with tongs). The crumbly mixture of bread crumbs was a hit over the cauliflower but also overtop of the scalloped potatoes that I served with it. I didn't have any Parmesan but it still turned out fine. I will definately make this again. In fact, my husband has asked that I do!

Must say I was very impressed. I was looking for a different way to have cauliflower  and this sure hit the mark! Very easy. Only suggestion i'd give would be careful not to over steam and have patients padding the topping around the Cauliflower,  it is very well worth the time. Yummy yummy

I was looking for a new way to fix cauliflower at the very last minute. This looked good and used simple ingredients. I made it without reading a single review. Fast, easy, and truly delicious. After the dishes were done I read some of the reviews and will try cutting up the cauliflower as many reviewers suggested.  There WILL be a next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great way to make vegetable tasty. I cut up the cauliflower in bite size and boiled it in chicken broth first. Then I mixed the breadcrumb mixture with it and baked it for 20 minutes. Yum

This is a delicious way to eat cauliflower and so easy. The next time I would steam the cauliflower a little less since I prefer my vegetables on the firmer side. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is a HUGE hit at my house. I only made 2 tiny adjustments to best suit us. I just added an extra shake or two of chili flake and a little extra butter to make it easier to coat then toss it over your favorite buttered noodles and VIOLA! PERFECTION! and my 3 yr old LOVES it!

This was a great recipe. I just made a few changes. I use finely chopped garlic instead of powder. I also threw in some sliced carrots just to add more veggies. I also chopped some onions and put it in the baking dish on top of the steamed cauliflower and carrots. I used the other review sugustions and brushed the veggies with the margarine before putting the topping on.

I was underwhelmed; however everyone else ate and enjoyed (or my "I hate cauliflower" folk tolerated, lol); I will certainly make again - it's a nice change on a typically unexciting veggie.  I want to play around with it a bit.  :)

eh, i was expecting something better. from all the good reviews, idk what i was expecting really but it wasn't that great. kind'a flavorless for me. i mean, i like cauliflower and i eat it steamed all the time, but this made me feel like it should taste like something well seasoned yet it wasn't there. i only did half a head and i'm glad of it. perhaps if i would have used the other's tips and steamed it in broth(which i've never done, should have tried it here though) it would have had that extra kick of flavor i needed. i even added extra cheese on top to give it more flavor. still, it wasn't even close. i rather have it plain. still, 3 stars 'cause i liked the idea of putting a sort of topping/crust on steamed veggies. i just need something more flavorful.

Holy moly!  This is fabulous.  I grew up on fried cauliflower and the taste is so similar!  I steamed whole for 20 minutes and then brushed with butter...sprinkled on the bread crumbs and baked as stated.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe for baked cauliflower is DELICIOUS!  I precooked the cauliflower in my Microwave Oven.  I added 1/2 cup of water to a glass dish, added cauliflower, cut in half and covered with a lid....cooking 13 minutes.   I used Panko bread crumbs mixed with some Lawry's seasoning salt in place of the seasoned bread crumbs.  Combined with the rest of "step 2" the topping was absolutely perfect.  Like another viewer, I chopped the cooked cauliflower a bit before adding the topping.  Can't wait to serve to company!

This is so good.  I followed the recipe exactly and prepared it ahead of time.  Any recipe I can prepare in advance gets a high rating from me. Everyone raved about it.  It looks so nice and tastes wonderful.  Not a smidgen left when dinner was done.  Thanks for a great recipe Ariela.

I really wanted to like this. I cut up the cauliflower and  cooked in chicken broth first, then put in a dish and poured the butter over it. I sprinkled the breadcrumbs over and baked. No one really cared for it.

This has been a favorite since discovering it online. Thanks for a great recipe. Here's a tip if in a hurry - I didn't have time to bake it one night for dinner, so instead, after steaming, I just mashed up the cauliflower and mixed all the other ingredients in. I added a little sour cream to hold it together, and it was great! I love tha baked version, but if in a hurry, this is good too.

Nice seasoning. Nice effect with the "whole" cauliflower. I really enjoyed this one. I put the butter directly onto the cauliflower then patted the bread crumb mixture on top as some have suggested. My mixture stuck just fine. Next time, however, I will probably cut the florets and put the mixture on that way. (Just to have crumbs on more of the cauliflower) For company, I would keep it whole as the recipe states.

Definitely cook the cauliflower in chicken broth.  I then used olive oil rather than butter, and mixed panko and seasonings with the oil. This made a good paste, not too hard to spread over the cauliflower. After the additional baking, I quickly put it under the broiler to brown. Very tasty indeed.

Prepared as written & it was PERFECT!  My family doesn't like cauliflower as much as I do, but they love this!  I've made it as a whole cauliflower and also as more of a casserole.  I like the presentation of the whole vegetable. It's beautiful on the table.

Very good recipe.  I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the cauliflower up, and steamed it in the microwave... it really took a lot of time off!  If you do not have a steamer, just use a colander that can sit in a bowl above the water in it for the microwave.

This is a nice and different way to make cauliflower. As suggested I cut the cauliflower into bite sizes, I had a head of orange color cauliflower fresh from the farmers market. I used extra virgin olive oil and fresh grated parmesan cheese. Very good!

This recipe makes cauliflower such a delicious side dish!  I've always tolerated cauliflower and didn't really mind it, but never actually craved it - now I do!  Like the other reviewers suggested, I "painted" on the melted butter and then sprinkled the breadcrumb mix on top.  This gave it a nice, stuck-on coating.  I loved it so much, I made a small head for my lunch and ate that as the whole meal.  It's so good, even reheated the next day.  My picky husband who "hates vegetables" liked it and had seconds.

My kids won't touch cauliflower (nor will I) unless it's done this way. The picture doesn't do the final result justice...I always come out with a golden-brown head of cauliflower. There's never leftovers!

The topping doesn't stay on well and didn't coat evenly, but it was quite tasty. I'd probably make it again but put melted butter on the cauliflower first and then put the bread crumbs sprinkled on that. I also decided instead of steaming a whole head just to break the cauliflower down into smaller pieces and steam that way. Made it much easier.

This was a hit with my family--kids included!  I, too, broke the cauliflower into florets. I steamed them in water, drained them, and used a combo of cooking spray and squirt butter, as opposed to butter. I also added more garlic powder to suit out taste.  Great recipe!

What a unique and differt way to present cauliflower!!!  This turned out quite good.  I steamed mine for about 15mins (completely forgot to use chicken broth, oops!) and then baked for almost 15 too.  My breadcrumbs were not seasoned so I just added a bit more of the spices for flavour.  Quite yummy!

My husband and I loved this. We weren't having company so cut it into large flowerets, then per boiled them, I placed them in a pie plate and put the breading on. I was worried the breading would over power it, but it didn't,it was a nice touch. Will be making again.

20 minutes in the steamer was too long! The cauliflower turned out way too soft. But the breading was delicious. Next time, 12 minutes in the steamer. It was a pretty presentation though.

This was yummmy.  I did follow the reviews of coating butter and then putting it into the bread crumb mix.  We prefer spicy so I increased the red pepper and oregano.  I also topped it off with mozarella.

Tastes great and very nice presentation, but not worth the effort for me.  Tastes just like when I steam smaller pieces of cauliflower and top it with breadcrumbs mixed with a little melted butter

I think cauliflower generally tastes like nothing at all, and this was the most tolerable cauliflower I've ever eaten. That is a miracle unto itself. I didn't have breadcrumbs, and substituted cornmeal with some Italian seasoning.

I've used this recipe for nearly 2 years now at many different occasions (Family dinner, Thanksgiving, Christmas, dinner parties, etc.). Even skeptical non-cauliflower eaters absolutely loved it.

The secret to this recipe is in the breading. If you don't modify the breading you can prepare the cauliflower in a number of different ways to suit your needs (whole or cut, steamed or boiled). This recipe is a definite "keeper."

(TIP: In fact, I've even tried the breading on some halibut steaks I fried up in a pan...excellent flavor.)

This was really G-O-O-D!! Cut in half  as there are only 2 of us---but should have used all the topping.  Lost some of the flavor by halving the topping.  Will make all of it next time.

I liked all of the components but used panko breadcrumbs for more crunch and texture and cut it all up instead of baking it whole.  Kids thought it was awesome.

YUM! this was great! I also had a tough time getting the sprinkles to stick but I used butter spray instead plus crushed wheat crackers instead of bread crumbs. I just scooped them up and plopped them back on. Everyone at the table loved the presentation and every bite was eaten!!

i microwaved the cauliflower to cut down on cook time.  and i brushed the butter as previous reviewers suggested.  but i dunno...it didn't quite work for me.  maybe it was too much breadcrumbs, i think. or maybe b/c i didn't use real butter but brummel & brown spread instead. anyway, i'm gonna try it again b/c i want it to work!

Took the advice of others and cut the cauliflower up before cooking to counteract blandness.. next time I think I'll leave it whole and steam it w/chicken stock.. maybe that will add more flavor.

Well this tasted like cauliflower with bread crumbs on it.  I follow the recipes  to the tee. This was pretty much flavorless. Next time I will add the mustard and mayo like someone suggested. Presentation nicer than a dish of cauliflower so everyone wanted to try it.  All were disappointed.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loved it. We like our veggies pretty firm, so steaming the head for 20 mins was way too long.  I'll probably half the time next time.

Nice, simple way to prepare cauliflower. I leave out the garlic powder and use butter instead of margarine. 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not extraordinary, but good.

This was alright.  I don't think it made anyone at my dinner table any more of a cauliflower fan than they were before, but it was an interesting twist on a somewhat bland veggie.

This was suprisingly tastey.  My husband loved it.  We made it with an orange cauliflower.  It made a pretty contrast with the bread crumbs.

I'm not a fan of cauliflower but this was really good.  I'm sure the butter in the original recipe is delicious.  To avoid the calories, I sprayed steamed florets with lo-cal spray butter and used reduced fat parmesan.  Still good and worth a try, even if you don't typically like cauliflower.

A different way than the usual steamed cauliflower.  My kids and hubby are guilty of eating cauliflower doused with cheese sauce so to have it this way was a shock to their system.  I thought it was good though :D

I am not a vegetable lover, but this is really delicious.  I am making it for the second time, but the first time I didn't have it cooked through, so when I baked it, the cauliflower was a bit hard.  This time I did like the recipe said, and I steamed it first

Definitely better to use flowerettes rather than whole.  Good flavor although I added season salt to the breadcrumbs.

The breading on this has a very good flavor, but the end result is a fairly dry dish.  Don't know what could be done to make it a bit more moist, without affecting the great breading.  Thank you for the recipe, Ariela!

We did not care for the crumb topping at all, but it could have been due to the brand of seasoned breadcrumbs I used.

Pretty good! I followed others' advice and broke up the cauli into large florets. The topping was tasty but, like some other people noted, it was a little tricky getting it to stay on the florets (perhaps a little mayo might help?). I'll probably make this again. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  Took the advice of others and steamed my cauli first in steamer basket w/some lemon wedges and salt for taste/flavor.  Only other change was adding 1 tsp. garlic powder to the topping, as I love garlic.  Would have loved to try this whole for presentation, but didn't chance it.  Used a small head of cauli and kept all other measurements as written, so if using a larger head, I would double this next time.

This was really good.  I took others advice and cut up the broccoflower (a cross b/w broccoli and cauliflower) the topping was amazing, but I should have doubled it - I'll make sure to do that next time!  Kudos!  AWESOME recipe

I am giving this 4 stars because the bread crumb crust was excellent.  We just didn't like the fact that it didn't stick to the cauliflower at all.  It didn't give the cauliflower any flavor, because it didn't penetrate the cauliflower.  I think it needs some more liquid and maybe it would help give the cauliflower some flavor when in the oven.  I am trying to tweek it to fit our tastes, but the crust was excellent.

A very tasty way to prepare cauliflower.  Even though I thought the whole head made for a nice presentation, I think I will cut it into little bunches next time to get flavor to all parts.  I recommend trying this to anyone!

I got this reciepe a year ago and fell in love with it.  My spanish husband who's not use to eating cauliflower has actually taken well to it and his father has come back for fourths. My brother loved it as well. THANK YOU ARIELA FOR SUBMITTING THIS IS DEFENATELY WORTH IT, plus it is so easy to make.

This tasted great but was a shamble of a dish. I microwaved with plastic wrap on top for 8 minutes whick kept the cauliflower in it's original form. I doubled the bread topping as previously suggested but tried to be frugal with the calories and cut the butter in half. I will try making this again as the presentation was lovely and the spices put a lively spin on a rather bland yet nutritious vegetable.

As suggested by others, i too steamed it in florets. I also made some other alterations, like, saute'ing onions & garlic in butter before mixing with the bread crumbs. I also dipped each floret in egg wash before covering it with the breadcrumbs. Came out great, except i agree with others that there should be a better way to get the flavor in. I will try streaming with some salt next time.Anyway, great recipe Ariela!

Easy and flavorful alternative to preparing cauliflower.  Do not allow the cauliflower to overcook or it will be very difficult to handle in preparation.

This was a good recipe for cauliflower, but not spectacular.  I followed the ingredient list *almost* exactly (I used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper instead of pepper flakes) and found that:  a) it did not take 20 minutes to steam the head of cauliflower (10 - 15 max) and ; b) a lot of the crumb topping fell off when we tried to cut the cauliflower apart.  A nicely flavoured dish, but I think if I make it again, I would break the cauliflower up as other reviewers have suggested.

I agree that this was a little salty.  This is an interesting way to prepare a vegetable so I will probably try using this recipe for other vegetable recipes too.

I have to agree with some of the others that this is a bit salty. Also, the dish was a drier than I had expected but I added a few slices of provolone on top, and it helped somewhat. Will try again, but with no add'l salt and will either dot the cauliflower with a little butter or drizzle with olive oil to make the florets less dry.

The flavor was good.  However, I definitely didn't steam it for 20 minutes.  I might follow the advise of melting the butter on top of the cauliflower and then sticking the bread crumb mixture on top, b/c I felt like it was a little mushy.  It would have been more satisfying to me if it had come out a little crispy.  Maybe I'll bake longer/at a higher temperature.  But I'll definitely make it again.

I steamed the flowerets, placed in casserole and sprinkled the breadcrumb mixture on top.  This is a very easy recipe and will be making it again!  Thanks to others who suggested separating the whole head.

Uh, it didn't turn out quite right.  The cheese didn't really melt.  Not sure if it was the kind that I used or what.  I did break the floretts up and place them in a shallow baking dish as recommended.

Hubby gave it a thumbs down but I'm willing to try this recipe again at a later date due to all of the positive reviews.

I'm giving 3 stars since I'm still gonna eat it anyway.  Would've been nice if the cheese melted.

I went with this recipe because it was so highly rated but I have to say it was just okay. Maybe I made an error, but mine came out very dry as the result of all the breadcrumbs. I would suggest cutting the amount in breadcrumbs by quite a bit. The dish was completely overpowered by breadcrumbs.

My entire household hates cauliflower, but we all ate this and really enjoyed it.  Thanks.  It is sometimes so hard to get in all the vegetables we should have, and considering we don't eat very much meat that is a bad thing.  We get tired of green beans and broccoli.  If you have any more vegetable recipes I would love to see them....
