I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and since I started, it's demanded of me at every family get together. Like “Mommy of Four” I keep the dressing outside the turkey, and so compensate with extra broth.  Make sure to spray your pan and keep it covered with foil! I’ve found that stirring it after it’s baked for 30 minutes or so, helps it bake more evenly. The only other changes I make are to throw in a little chardonnay for flavor and to add an egg for a little extra hold. I've also found that sage pork sausage is much more flavorful (make sure to drain it after cooking however). I have a habit of not measuring, so more cranberries and herbs always find their way in. And I cannot emphasize the difference FRESH herbs make. Experiment with different kinds of bread as well! Sourdough and potato bread have yielded delicious results.  I've had a few flavor variations, but every result was just as tasty as the last. This is my favorite recipe from this site.

I love this recipe and have made it for a couple of years now.  I use cubed day-old Italian Ciabatta bread and omit the giblets (I use the giblets to flavor my basting liquids for my gravy) and it is simply wonderful. I prepare this stuffing one day in advance w/o baking it (although fully cook the sausage, of course).  Since I stuff my bird with other things (like onion, garlic, rosemary, lemon and orange), I make this the night before, very lightly grease a casserole dish, drizzle a very small amount of butter (just a bit) on the top to keep it moist and RESERVE ALL THE LIQUIDS UNTIL READY TO BAKE, pop it in the fridge overnight.  The next day, add the liquids (broth and melted butter) - I usually add more broth since I will not be baking it in my turkey, it will need more broth (use your judgment depending on how much you are making), bring it to room temperature and then heat it through for about 35-45 minutes, ovens vary, so just make sure it is hot when ready to serve. It's a wonderfully delicious stuffing and the only one I will ever make. Thank you for sharing!

I've used this several times for Thanksgiving (this is our Thanksgiving Only Stuffing) & everyone LOVES it. Follow this recipe to the T & use fresh herbs (remember to double them) for a really delicious flavoring.  **I was just making my Thanksgiving list & thought I'd give some updated suggestions since I've been making this for 6 yrs. now.  1. I always use fresh herbs, the presentation, taste & aroma is wonderful! 2. I've tried different apples & have found that the granny smiths are the best, along with fuji & braeburn. 3. I can't always find turkey sausage links so one year I started using Turkey Kielbasa (I just chopped it up really fine with my food chopper) ~ outstanding! 4. I've made this w/ different types of bread. I really like the sourdough bread personally. I've found that somewhat stale baguettes are MUCH easier to work with, cause you can slice them up pretty easy w/o crust flying everywhere or w/o having to smoosh your sliced bread too much. (I usually cut the bread a few days before to let it get hard.)  5. I never stuff this in the turkey, I usually make it separately in a tray. I continuously check it because the turkey stock has dried out on me once before, which made for a nasty burnt stuffing. And one last thing, this isn't your typical mushy-glop that most people are used to, so if you don't think you'll like a dryer type of stuffing, then I'd suggest using LOTS of stock.

Awesome! I wanted to use fresh herbs as others suggested, but didn't know how much to use, so I looked it up. 2 1/2 tsp. dried sage = 5 tsp. fresh, 1 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary = 1 1/2 Tbl. fresh, and 1/2 tsp. dried thyme = 1 sprig fresh.  Perfect amounts!  I reversed the amount of whole wheat cubes and white cubes (i.e., used 1 1/2 cups white and 3 3/4 cups wheat) to make it more hearty & healthy. I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock, and left off the turkey liver (just a personal preference).  My butcher made me some turkey sausage by taking ground turkey and adding 'breakfast sausage' spices (loved it!). As others suggested, I added an egg and an extra 1 cup stock - definitely needed both those additions! I baked in 13x9x2 pan COVERED in foil for 40 minutes on 350, then 15 minutes UNCOVERED (instead of stuffing the turkey).  Perfect!  The next time I made this, I made my own seasoned turkey sausage: 1 pkg ground turkey + 1 tsp. ground sage + 1 tsp. salt + 1/2 tsp. black pepper + 1/8 tsp. marjoram + pinch of cloves - turned out fantastic!  Thanks so much for the recipe - this one's a definite keeper!

I have to admit, I was very skeptical about this one.  It didn't seem as easy as many said and the combo of fruit and meat seemed too intense to paired with turkey. But, I tried it because of rave reviews.  

I tried it and I add to the praise.  I will never make another stuffing again.

Even if you don't cook often, this IS NOT HARD!  Make sure, as in all recipes, you have all your ingredients ready ahead of time. It's easy and the end product is sooo goood.  You'll be the hit of the meal!

I took the advice of other reviewers, you should too to maximize this EXCELLENT stuffing!!  I'm sure if you followed the original, it would be great, too.

1.  I used fresh herbs, double the amount if using fresh.

2.  I used a combination of prepared stuffing bread. I liked the combination of cornbread, white, and wheat.   I added about a 1 1/2 cups more.

3.  I couldn't find the Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage as others suggested.  I will continue to look as I think it will enhance the flavors well.  Instead, I used regular flavor Jimmy Dean's pork sausage.  DO NOT SKIP THE SAUSAGE (unless you don't eat meat--in that case use a faux meat product and toss in some butter).  I thought the sausage might be too much, it was AWESOME in the recipe. It wasn't overwhelming at all! It made the recipe.

4.  I substitued craisains for the cranberries.  I think I'll try a mixture of golden raisins and dried cranberries. The craisins though. I think I'd like the tartness of the cranberry to play off the sw

This is a wonderful dressing.  I used pork sausage and substituted bought unseasoned cornbread dressing for the bread and used sweetened cranberries (craisins)and left out the liver.  I added the same spices and used more turkey stock.  It still came out a bit dry so next time I will use even more stock.  However, the taste and smell was fantastic.  This was my first time making dressing and boy did it turn out wonderful.  Instead of stuffing the turkey, I popped it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour and the color was fantastic.  Will definately make again.
**Update 2015
I've made this for years now on Thanksgving. Thought I would post what I do that my family absolutely loves and it makes a nice moist dressing. I use one bag (14 oz) of bought seasoned bread crumbs, one pound sage sausage, and all the same spices and ingredients as called for. I also have found that 3 cups of stock (whether turkey or chicken) makes the dressing just the way I like it. My husband requests this every single year.

This is the first review I've ever done.  This stuffing is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! You won't be sorry!  Prior to making it I read a lot of the reviews and created my own step by step recipe and trust me you will not go wrong if you follow this. Always use FRESH HERBS!  Since I am anal, here it is step by step: Ingredients: FRESH HERBS-5 teaspoons of sage, 1 1/2 tablespoons of rosemary, 1 sprig of thyme, 2 1/3 cups of parsley, 1 box of Jiffy Mix Cornbread, 5 1/4 cups of white & wheat bread (I just buy a bag of Pepperidge Farm Country Cube Stuffing), 1 lb. of Jimmy Dean Sage Pork Sausage, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 Egg (Beaten), 3/4 cup chopped celery, 1 Granny Smith or Golden Delicious apple (cored & chopped), 1 cup of Craisins (or more if you want), 4 tablespoons UNSALTED Butter, and 2 3/4 cups of Chicken broth or Turkey Stock. Directions: 1)Bake cornbread mix. 2)Chop/mince herbs.  3)In large skillet cook sausage over medium heat then DRAIN. 4)Add onions, celery, sage, rosemary, thyme, & parsley, cook & stir for 2 mins to blend flavors. 5)In bowl crumble cornbread (I use most of it) & add stuffing. Pour sausage mixture over it and mix in apples, craisins, & beaten egg. 6)Spray 9x13 pan and put stuffing in it, ightly drizzle w/butter, DO NOT ADD STOCK/BROTH, cover and refrigerate overnight.  7)The next day add stock/broth and butter, mix, cover and bake at 350 for 40 mins, uncover, stir, & bake for another 15 min.

This was my first attempt at homemade stuffing. Wow! Couldn't get any better. Everyone loved it. I did add more chicken stock since I didn't stuff it in the turkey. I put it in the oven on 350 deg. for 40 min then uncovered for 15 mins for perfection. Thanks!

I begin to crave this when Fall begins!  To make it easier, I use bagged dry cornbread stuffing, boxed or canned chicken stock, and add pecans into the mix.  I do not use the liver and it is fantastic! My all-time favorite stuffing recipe!!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now for the holidays - however, I became a vegetarian in January 06 and this will be my 4th holiday season without meat.  I've made this recipe now about 8 times using Morning Star breakfast sausage patties and it is fantastic every time! I cooked the "sausage" in butter and chopped them up into pieces.  It's an excellent alternative and tastes just as good! I did use extra butter to compensate for the loss of the sausage grease, used vegetable broth and omited the liver.  Absolutley Awesome stuffing (even the vegetarian version!)

Fantastic taste, color, and aroma!  I made this last year when my parents couldnt hold the traditional Thanksgiving dinner at their home. Having never made a Thanksgiving dinner before,  I was rather nervous about trying something new, but I'm glad I did. I used sweetened dried cranberries (Craisins) in the recipe.  Dad, the picky eater, had seconds and Mom declared that the Thanksgiving tradition now belonged to me....not bad for a single guy!  Thanks All Recipes!

Wow, this is the first time i've given a poor review.  With all the rave reviews, I figured it would be a hit.  I did a trial run 2 days prior due to I was going to make it for Thanksgiving.  BOY am i sure glad i did.  I followed the recipe almost to a T, and something was off.  Definitely way too much meat.  Not enough bread.  My mom and granddad who were two of my taste testing guinea pigs (and my granddad who'll eat just about anything..if he's hungry) both disliked it.  My mom stated it wasnt too bad, but could be eaten as a meal in itself with as much meat as there was in it.  My grandad said the usual when he doesnt care for a dish, but doesnt want to hurt the cooks feelings, "Its alright".  Maybe it is the fact that my family is so used to our traditional southern cornbread dressing, but NO ONE liked it.  I think i'm sticking with my family tested and approved recipe.

If I could give this a higher rating than a 5 I would. This was the huge hit at Thanksgiving. Picky eaters were inpressed and came back for seconds and thirds. I substituted raisins for the dried cranberries and also i did not use the stuffing in a turkey. I cooked it in a crock pot on medium heat for 2 1/2 hours and it came out perfect. I have already had requests for the recipe. Thanks!

This won out our 100+ year family favorite!  I made this last year (2007) for our family.  Initially, everyone groaned and extended family whispered amongst themselves over my "mistake" in not making the 100+ year family recipe that had even been featured in Southern Living Magazine!  I was literally applauded by the whole table of 43 family members after it passed the taste test of the entire table.  This year, EVERYONE has concluded that THIS is our family's new stuffing recipe.  NOTE:  I added 1/2 cup more liqued per serving when baking stuffing in a seperate dish than in the turkey and it kept it mosit but not overly so.  Absolutely the best!

I have made this stuffing/dressing every year for the past 8 years.  As many of you have already stated, I do not stuff the bird with it, but make it as a stand alone dressing by almost doubling the stock, adding 2 beaten eggs, using sage sausage (pork usually), fresh herbs, and omitting the turkey liver.  It is a hit every time.  Now, it is different than your standard dressings, but I won't eat it any other way now.  Enjoy!

Very Good and very easy.  I found Pepperidge Farms makes a stuffing mix called  COUNTRY CUBE consisting of Wheat & White Bread cubes with herbs, nice shortcut to toasting you own bread, I still added the herbs & spices.  Add just a little more liquid, I used Chicken Broth.

This is the first time I ever made homemade stuffing and let me tell you, I will NEVER use Stovetop again! This was absolutely DELICIOUS and was soooo easy to make!... The only changes I made are I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage instead of the turkey sausage, I didn't use the turkey liver (bleccch, lol), and for seasonings I only added 1 teaspoon of sage (since there was already some sage in the sausage) and 1 1/2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning. I didn't use the rosemary or thyme at all. I used chicken broth instead of the turkey stock and since I was baking it in the oven I added quite a bit more than the 3/4 cup the recipe called for. I didn't measure it, but just mixed it up till it was nice and sticky/moist, then spooned the stuffing into a 13x9 pan and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes covered with foil, then took it out and stirred it up really well and baked it for 20 more minutes UNcovered to brown the top... Everyone just LOVED this and I'll be making it EVERY Thanksgiving from now on!

Oh My!  This was FABULOUS!  I was looking to branch out this Thanksgiving--and this one's a winner.  I used 2/3 sourdough cubed sourdough bread and 1/3 cornbread cubed.  I also agree with other posts that fresh herbs are the way to go.  I doubled the recipe, so the 2 apples I chose were Granny Smith and Braeburn.  I think next time I'll try using whole cranberries, or cook them down in some water--I felt they were a bit too subtle for my taste, and I'd like them to have a bit more consistency than the craisins did.  I also used a turkey sausage I chopped into bits (instead of ground sausage).  I did not stuff the bird with this--I put it in a roasting pan covered at 350 for 40 min and then uncovered for 15 min.  It did take additional turkey stock to keep it moist-ish.  Very pretty dish, too!  Thanks for the recipe, and the helpful tips in other reviews!

WOW! This is delicious! Everyone loved it and there were NO leftovers, unlike other years where the stuffing gets tossed. I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage instead of the turkey sausage and 1 box of cornbread stuffing instead of the 1 1/2 cups whole wheat bread. I also used a 50/50 mix of chicken stock and white wine to moisten the stuffing. I cooked it in a crockpot for about 3 hrs on high, adding a bit of liquid every hour or so. The cranberries give it such a nice flavor without being too sweet. I omitted the turkey liver. I'll definitely  be making this again!

I have been making a similiar recipe for years.  I always start with pepperidge farms cube herb dressing and add cooked sage pork sausage, walnut or pecan pieces, chicken stock instead of water and dried cranberries.  Note: soak the dried cranberries in warm water for 1/2 an hour before adding.  Always use real butter.  My new daughter-in-law loved it last year!

All me and my husband have say about this recipe is YUM YUM YUM!
Excellent! I decided to try it before I made it for the big crowd on Thanksgiving, and for any of you who are like me, you like to try it before you make it for a crowd, and don't have the time to do a test run-I believe this is the best stuffing I've ever eaten!
So moist, with so many differnt tastes going on, and now of them competing with each other, only complimenting each other!
The sweetness of the dried cranberries,Golden Delicious apple and the spices just all mixed in together for a delightful taste experience.
I used Louis Rich Turkey Sausage for mine and Tennessee Pride Sausage for my husband's.  They were both equally good. The sausage was not over-powering at all.
I used Ocean Spray Craisins (sweetened).
I made my broth by boiling 3 turkey legs I got fresh at the Walmart turkey case, next to the chickens.  They have all the Honeysuckle turkey pieces there all year. The 3 legs were only a few dollars for all of them, and I chopped them up tonight and put them in the dressing and they were so good.
Can't wait till Thankgiving, when I'll get a chance to see what it is like stuffing in the turkey.
Happy Thanksgiving, all! This one really IS a keeper!

Great recipe!  Left out the turkey liver and used chicken stock instead (no turkey stock available).  Baked in 350 oven for 1 hour instead of stuffing the bird. Will definitely use again - thanks!!

Delicious! I modified it here:  Sub'd Jimmie Dean Sage Pork Sausage instead of turkey sausage. Sub'd 1/2 Cornbread 1/2 Bisquits instead of the chopped up bread.  Left them out overnight and baked before cutting them up.   Sub'd Honeycrisp apple for Golden.  This is the best stuffing I have ever had, I baked it at 350 until it smelled "done".  Everyone loved it, even 3 people who normally hate stuffing.  This was a major hit, and I will make it every year from now on!  :)

I never made homemade stuffing until I used this recipe!  (I'm 19, just out of home)  I used it for Thanksgiving, Christmas, dinner with my family, and a special turkey dinner for my husband.  I made it Sunday and it was gone by last night (tuesday!) and I only had one serving!!!  He can't get enough of it!  I never use the chicken liver though.  I forgot to include the first time I made the recipe and it came out yummy, so now I just forget about it.
I use Sausage meat not turkey sausage also.

My husband just tried it and declared it fantastic.  I doubled the recipe to make for 20 people for tomorrow's feast.  Almost half of it fit in my 2 5/8 Le Creuset casserole/soup pot which I baked at 350 for an hour.  I was unprepared for the large amount it made.  I'm getting two casserole dishes worth out of doubling the recipe and extra which I am freezing some of it (before baking and before butter and stock) in the freezer for use another time.

Being the night before Thanksgiving, the store only had one pkg dried sweetened Cranberries (store brand) left and it had only Cherry flavored Craisins.  So I mixed the two together in the recipe.  I like the Cherry flavor.  It's not that strong and works with the recipe. 

Substitutions:
I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock and 1 pkg unseasoned generic brand cornbread dressing in addition to Mrs. Cubbison's cubed herb stuffing.   I did add pan-fried chicken liver, chopped by the food processor, in case anyone is wondering if anyone out there actually does put liver in the recipe.  Hardly taste it though so if you leave it out, not a big deal.  I added a little extra.  I like my stuffing very moist so I used one cup of broth instead of the 3/4 cup per 10 servings.  I also used "sweet italian sausage" instead of turkey sausage.  I expected it to be just pork sausage but it had extra spice which was even nicer.  Next time I'll try turkey sausage only because I think I'm going to gain too much weight with this.

This was just as it says... AWESOME!! My husband and I couldnt get enough!! I admit i was extrememly skeptic about trying this but the flavors of all the ingredients just blend together beautifully. I made a couple minor changes to the recipe ... i used Jimmy Deans Sage sausage and Ocean Spray Craisins and omitted the liver as many others suggested. I followed the recipe exactly for everything else except also adding more chicken stock. I cooked it in a casserole dish in the oven covered at 350. After about 30mins. i stirred it and added the extra stock (total chicken stock used was just about 1 15oz can). cooked for another 20mins and then the last 10mins i cooked uncovered. Perfect!!! I will be making this again real soon.

A great dressing!  I have made this for the past three family Thanksgiving dinners (Canadian so we just celebrated) and it has become a staple in our meal.  It can be difficult to find Turkey sausage in Canada so I use either bits of turkey or sometimes porks sausage.  I omit the turkey liver and use chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  I also cook mine in the slow cooker on low for 3-4 hours (doubled recipe) to help save oven space.  A wonderful dish with loads of personality.

I'm making this stuffing this Thanksgiving and was going to make it in the crockpot to save room in the oven (as some others have mentioned).  My concern is that the stuffing will end up mushy.  If I do use the crockpot how long and what setting should I use?  Or is it so much better in the oven that I should make room for it?

This was great and got rave reviews from our guests, who even wanted the recipe. I made a few changes: used stuffing bread cubes from local bakery, used 1 tablespoon of fresh sage instead of dried, used Spicy Italian Chicken Sausage, omitted the turkey liver, baked in the oven for 35-45 minutes (350 degrees).

Love it!  My mother in law who is an awesome cook does not like stuffing in general and she loved this.  Changes I made are: used sourdough bread, italian sausage, no liver, double fresh herbs and chicken stock which I doubled as well.  Fabulous!

Good recipe, but rather time consuming. Next time I'll use store-bought bread cubes or stuffing mix, to decrease the prep time. I added raisins and chopped walnuts.

It really is as good as they say. I left out the turkey liver and cooked the stuffing seperate from the turkey in a pyrex dish. After reading other comments I added a bit of extra stock as I like a more moist stuffing. I covered it at first but, as I wanted a crusty top, I took the foil off after 30 mins. and cooked it uncovered. I tested it as I went and it ended up in the oven for a while longer that then recipe suggests until it was exactly how I wanted it. And it was perfect! My advice: kep checking it so that you can add moisture or dry it out as desired. Well worth it.

i completely altered this so i could make it in my crockpot. I used 9 cups packaged bread cubes, the same amt of sausage (jimmy dean breakfast), the same amt of celery, onion, FRESH herbs (remember to double the amt for fresh), 2 golden delicious apples, 1 c CRAISINS, 2 c chicken stock (used more because of pre packaged bread cubes) 4 Tb margarine, and 1.5 eggs whisked. This made an INSANE amt of stuffing and my family RAVED about it. perfectly moist but not tooo moist, wonderful flavor, SO easy to use a crockpot. 4 hrs on low, make sure to stir often during the last hr and always pam your pot!

Delicious!  I prepare this separately in a casserole dish the day before so the flavors can mature.  I cover the lightly-greased casserole dish in foil and bake at 350F for ~35min, drizzling a little stock on it at the halfway point to keep everything moist.

This stuffing is a very good combination of flavors.  I thought it was a little heavy on the sausage, so I added more bread, an extra apple, and more chicken stock.  I baked it in a 9X13 inch pan at 350 degrees for about an hour, and it turned out great.

My family loved it. I doubled the bread, used 1 lb. of Bob Evans Sage Sausage and didn't add any more sage seasoning.  I made it the day before which was a great time saver.  I didn't stuff the turkey,  I just put it all in a large casserole dish.

This stuffing with a properly cooked turkey (brine if you can). good mashed potatoes and gravy, a medley of roasted root vegetables plus your family favorites, and a homemade pumpkin or apple pie will take you to the end of your days on earth as a well celebrated cook.  There are great recipes on allrecipes.com for all the above but it's the stuffing that will make you famous.  Use dry or better still, fresh herbs if you have them and want to show off, and make extra to freeze in family size quantities for the next time you make chicken.  This recipe will destroy many family traditions.

Our family loved this stuffing.  I made it for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and will be making it again for Thanksgiving dinner this week.  I took some suggestions from the reviews and used Sage flavored sausage and fresh herbs (if you use the sage sausage, you probably don't need to double the fresh sage, as ours turned out a little too "sagey").  I also used a loaf of french bread, but plan to try the wheat/white mix.  Also, I ended up using about 1.5 C of chicken stock and baked it separate from the turkey at 350 for 20 min covered and 15-20 min uncovered (until the top looked browned).  This is a new family favorite and worth the effort!

This stuffing is SOO good!  I just made it for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I followed the directions up until mixing the apples, cranberries and parsley.  Then a drizzled some olive oil over all of it, and thoroughly mixed in a can of chicken broth.  I transferred it to a greased 13x9 pan, and tomorrow will bring the pan to room temp. and heat at 350 for about 35 min. per another reviewer's advice.  I also omitted the turkey liver (bleahh) and used oil instead of butter, and all wheat bread instead of white.  Hope this helps!

This was awesome stuffing!  I did add an entire carton of chicken broth instead of turkey broth.  You have to remember this recipe is for inside the bird where it would draw drippings and moisture.  If you are like me I cook it outside in a casserole dish!  It was perfect.  I used bag breadcrumbs.  Regular seasoned for the most and cornbread in a bag for the 1 1/2 measurement.  Used Jimmy Dean sage sausage.  It is so good, I am eating it right out of the pan!!

This is a wonderful recipe for those of you who like a little more texture to your stuffing.  I boiled the turkey "parts" in an onion and celery mixture for about an hour to create turkey stock, which only gave me about 1 cup.  I skipped a step, and just used a bag of sage and onion bread cubes.  Because I like spicey and sweet together, I used half a pound of spicy Italian sausage.  I didn't know if I was supposed to used the dried sweetened cranberries, fresh cranberries, or frozen cranberries.  I did use the sweetened cranberries, but I think they soaked up a lot of the stock.  I also added a package of sliced mushrooms, and about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  We deep fried our turkey, so I baked the stuffing at 350 degrees cover for about 1/2 hour, and another 20 minutes uncovered.  When I took it out to uncover it, I added chicken broth, as I found it a little dry.  This was really good, and everyone loved it!  You can't go wrong with a 5 star recipe like this!

I loved this recipe. My husband barbequed a turkey so I wasn't able to stuff it so I cooked this in the oven instead. I used prepared bread cubes from the store. I omitted the onion since my family doesn't like them. The cranberries gave it nice color.

I made this for the first time last year, and I don't think I'm allowed to show up at my mother's thanksgiving dinner without it ever again!  As some others did, I omitted the liver since I'm not a fan, and I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock since I don't cook the turkey.  I also baked it in a casserole dish instead of stuffing the turkey, and used regular sausage instead of turkey sausage, since it's what I had on hand.  It was PERFECT, and I can't wait to make it again this year!  Make sure to use the fresh parsley, it really adds a special flavor.

This was my first time making stuffing from scratch.  I read most of the reviews as I really wanted this to come out perfect and ended up tweaking the recipe as others have to obtain the best results.  Since I could not find turkey sausage I used mild Italian pork sausage.  I only used half a pound because I was worried the Italian flavor would not mesh well with the sage.  I used 10 cups of toasted sourdough bread, 2 cups of onions, 2 cups of celery, 2 apples, 1 cup of dried cranberries, 5 teaspoons of fresh sage, and 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme.  For liquid I used 2 and a 1/2 cups of reduced sodium chicken stock and also an egg for binding.  I omitted the rosemary and turkey liver.   I baked at 375 for 1 hour, first 30 minutes covered.  DELICIOUS!!!  This will be a Thanksgiving and Christmas staple from this day forward!

Sooo many complements on this one! It was so tastey. I used pork sausage, added the egg, and added an extra 1/3c of stock. As recommended by someone else, I cooked in a 13x9 pan covered for 40 mins and then uncovered for 15 mins. I stirred it a few times in between. Maybe added too much stock for it being covered, so I would recommend adding it every 15 mins or so as needed. Excellent taste.

Wonderful! I made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I did not use the liver either and used dried cherries instead of the cranberries. I also made in a crock pot instead of the turkey (I wasn't preparing the turkey) and it turned out great...I think I added about 1/2-3/4 cup more of the turkey stock though. Enjoy!

I'm 20 years old and never really had to cook for myself before, my roommate and I made this stuffing and it was fabulous! We didn't use the turkey liver or celery, but our friends raved about it and asked us when we'd make it again.

Between this and the highest rated turkey brine on this site, I've officially become the Thanksgiving Poo-bah of my family. Fresh herbs are better, but in a pinch, I put all the dried herbs in a small glass and pour in just enough turkey or chicken stock to cover them. I let them soak while I'm preparing the rest of the ingredients and then dump them in with the little bit of stock when the recipe calls for them. I haven't got a complaint yet.

I make this stuffing for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas and there are never any leftovers! I don't use the liver or stuff it in the bird. Instead I bake it at 350 for 35 minutes, fluffing it with a fork a few times to ensure that it gets evenly baked. After trying this stuffing, we'll never try another recipe again!

This was my first time making stuffing and this recipe was fairly easy.  I used previous reviewers advice and cooked it out of the bird on 350 for 50 minutes (with foil covering) and then took the foil off for 10 more minutes.  When I brought the dish to my holiday gathering everyone loved it and immediately asked to give them the recipe.  A winner for sure!

I accidentally ruined this. I used 3 cups of stock instead of 3/4ths, because I forgot to separate the awesome stock I was saving for the gravy. Of course, the texture was terrible, but we STILL ate it because it tasted so good!  I'm going to make it into stuffing soup tomorrow.  One change I'd make -- use fresh cranberries instead of dried. I think the tart freshly popped cranberries would be SO amazing in this.

I've made this stuffing (with some variations) for the last two years.  Everyone LOVES it!  I suggest adding more apple (I use different colors such as golden, granny, and red) and using Jimmy Dean's sage sausage for an excellent little kick.  It is truly the perfect stuffing.

This is a fantastic recipe and I have been making this stuffing for a few years. My family usually asks for my two stuffings each year and this one is a favorite.  I have changed this recipe to add some of the flavors I love.  I have substituted the turkey sausage using pork sausage, and it gave it a great taste.  Two years ago, I realized I did not have any dried cranberries, so I used fresh cranberries.  Instead of using the measurements for the cranberries, I added them until I thought there was an even coating throughout the stuffing.  I also used Granny Smith apples instead of the recommended Golden Delicious.  All of the substitutions turned out great. Please note, as other reviewers have mentioned, if you are using this as a stand alone dish, you will want to add more broth.

This was an awesome dish. I just baked the whole thing in a square casserole dish instead of stuffing it in the turkey and left out the turkey liver. The cranberries and sausage (try it with Bob Evans sage sausage...mmmmm) complimented on another perfectly! I can't wait to make this again.

Awesome!  Everyone loved it!  I used pork sausage instead of turkey because my grocery store rarely has turkey, and I didn't put the liver in.  I cook it in a pan at 325 for 35-40 minutes.  A must have recipe!

I don't know why I've neglected to rate this recipe, SHAME ON ME!!!  It's the best stuffing recipe I've ever used and I've been making it for several years now.  I have always stuffed it in the bird, there's just no comparison to the flavor you get.  I use organic turkey broth and if I have any leftover (which I always do) to bake in a casserole, I add more broth to keep it moist.  FRESH HERBS make a huge difference to this recipe and I use Bob's sage sausage.  I use a mixture of Italian and Sourdough bread and cube it a few days before.. even have let it dry out in a low oven.  Nice to use fresh bread cubes, not bagged or pre-seasoned ones.  I also use a Fuji Apple for this, Golden Delicious breaks down too much for cooking.  I leave out the liver and giblets.. but otherwise, this is the best stuffing I've ever had.  Thank you for sharing, Stacy!

I have been making this recipe for 7 years now. Just excellent. The flavors blend perfectly, I have never cooked inside the turkey, instead baking in the over and continually pulling it out, and drizzling the stock/butter throughout it in order to keep it moist.  I don't always include liver (depending on the tastes of the guests) and turkey stock can be tough to track down but chicken stock doesn't alter it enough to negatively effect the taste. Great recipe!

This was THE BEST stuffing I've ever had!!! I did make a few changes. I used french bread, fresh herbs, craisins, chicken stock, and omitted the liver. I don't like to stuff my turkey so I baked it in a greased dish in a 350 degree oven covered for 40 minutes then uncovered for 15 minutes. I love this recipe so much! I will always use this for my stuffing!

Love Love Love this stuffing! This is my go to for all my Holiday dinners. I do not use the turkey liver, there is no need. I always double it so I will have leftovers and then I just eat this for lunch instead of a turkey sandwich. I would definetly recommend this recipe, it is a keeper and will be a regular on my table for years to come!

This is by far my favorite stuffing recipe to date!  I added 1/4 cup more dried cranberries and 1/2 of an apple because those two components made the dish for me!  This dish has been a huge hit on all the dinners I've made it for. I highly recommend it!

This recipe is wonderful!   You don't have to use plain old white bread either.  I used marble rye bread cut into cubes and toasted in the oven for just a few minutes.  I also used chicken stock to moisten before baking.  I never stuff a turkey, it steals all of the moisture from the meat...  The meat is dry enough!

This is "The Stuffing Recipe" from now on. I always double or even triple the recipe so there is plenty to send home with my children. I have to admit I throw away the liver and I use Bob Evan's Pork Sausage with Sage. I also use canned chicken broth to keep it moist ... who has time to make turkey broth? I usually bake it for 30 minutes covered and then uncovered for 10-15 minutes to slightly crisp the top. Thank you Stacy for a really awesome recipe.

I am a fairly experienced cook, and this recipe is the best stuffing for Thanksgiving Turkey that I have EVER made!  EVERYONE loved it and asked for the recipe!  That's the test.  I used Craisins by Ocean Spray (no preservatives - all natural), and turkey sausage.  Just GREAT - wouldn't change a thing.  I doubled the recipe for a 20.5 lb turkey and had enough extra to make an 8x8 casserole.  Just added an egg and some extra broth to make "gooey", then baked for 30 min. at 350.  The name fits!  AWSOME!

p.s.  Made for 2nd time at Xmas.  Used JenniO's brand turkey sausage.  This is not nearly as good as Louis Rich's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The kind of turkey sausage makes all the difference. Jenni0'S sausage was WAY too dry! Louis Rich's was excellent - just like reg. sausage. And I have nothing to do with Louis Rich's co.

I made this stuffing for 25 people at Thanksgiving this year!  It was a huge hit!  It went great with the Rosemary Roasted Turkey.  I did use pork sausage instead of turkey sausage to add more favor.  I also cooked the stuffing in a turkey bag by itself  for a moist, fluffy stuffing:)

Everyone raved about this!  Very unique and attractive, too.  I used the pork sausage and since I did it in a casserole rather than a turkey, I increased the amount of broth.

This was my first attempt at making stuffing by myself.  It was wonderful!  It wowed my Canadian friends on Thanksgiving.  The apples and cranberries gave the stuffing a sweet and special touch.

Was never a fan of stuffing but have made it for the last 2 years and... hallelujah! I omit the liver simply because 'yuk' but use it if you like it. If there was an award for the Best Stuffing, this would win!  Enjoy!

OH MY GOODNESS! Yum!! I read lots of reviews and followed what most people suggested. Used per-pkg bread stuffing crumbs, fresh herbs, & sage sausage. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of stock. This was AMAZING! Didn't stuff the bird, just baked 350 for 45 min. I'll make this forever...so yummy!!

great stuffing I did not do the whole shabang of making the actually stuffing itself, I used a boxed stuffing and added the apples, onions and cranberries.  I also cooked it in broth instead of water that is stated on the box.  Pretty good short-cut that left my family thinking it was homemade!!!!

I made this tonight, as a practice run for thanksgiving. Obviously, I made it outside of the turkey. I did not have turkey liver. I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock. I also used a granny smith apple. Everyone loved it, but I thought that maybe there were too many cranberries. I think I will cut it down.  Since I was cooking it in the oven, I did it at 300, because it will probably share the oven with the ham, and I wanted to see if it worked on a cooler oven than others are using. I cooked it for about 90 mins with foil. Then I took the foil off to dry it out a bit - for about 2 hours total. I used 1 cup stock, and it was plenty. I did not have to add any more liquids.   It was a big hit. Thank you!

This was fantastic stuffing...and i am not a stuffing lover. I used turkey sausage and made my own croutons from half whole wheat and half white bread. I cooked most of it in the turkey and it was a little too moist for my liking however the stuffing cooked in a seperate pan was perfect so I will be doing that again next time. This was the first time I made stuffing from scratch and I cant wait for Christmas to make it again! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I've never made stuffing, and actually don't like it, but made it for some friends for our trial run Thanksgiving & they loved it.  They want me to double the recipe for the actual day!  I used Jimmy Dean Sage Pork Sausage, left out the liver and baked it in a baking dish for 40 min covered & 15 uncovered at 350.  I also added extra stock than the recipe asks for. And I used chicken stock. Very delicious!

This was the first recipe that I made from this site and the best stuffing I've ever had.  I used other reviewers advice and used fresh herbs which I doubled.  I used pork sausage and chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  I also baked it, 40 minutes at 350 covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  The crispy parts were the best.  I got many rave reviews and will make this again!

This is so delicious but a bit time-consuming.  If you want essentially the same recipe, but in less time, use the Publix Simple Apron Recipe (from Publix Grocery Store website) - tastes pretty much the same.

This is our new family stuffing recipe.  Never had such good stuffing in my life and was so proud when my whole family raved about it.  I highly recommend finding the Jimmy Deans Sage Sausage...comes in a tube usually in the breakfast meat section or sometimes the freezer section.  I have officially added this to our family recipe collection and it will be passed on to our children!!!

This is a wonderful stuffing recipe.  I cooked this for a Christmas get together recently.  We deep fried the turkey so I had to cook the stuffing in a 9x13 pan at 325 for an hour.  It came out perfectly.  I had to add quite a bit more liquid than it called for, about 2 cups of chicken stock.  I also left out the liver and used pork sausage instead of turkey. To save time I used bagged bread cubes and it didn't seem to affect the recipe at all.  I will definatly make this recipe again.

I made this stuffing today for my family's early Xmas celebration and WOW was it a hit!!  It was just delicious and mouthwatering; I couldn't believe I made it, with my lack of cooking knowledge, yet determination prooved I could!  It's an excellent dish.  I omitted the turkey liver (OVER KILL) there was already enough meat in the stuffing!  And turkey stock was too hard to find so I used chicken stock, which worked fine!  This was a relatively simple recipe and FUN!  So colorful and gorgeous looking!  And of course it tasted GREAT!  My 9 relatives LOVED IT and I am savoring the left-overs!  Please try this stuffing; you won't regret it!  (My suggestions are that you omit the liver and replace the turkey stock with the chicken stock, if you can't find the turkey stock).  I cooked this stuffing inside the turkey and it turned out fine!  GREAT RECIPE!!  It will be in my recipe book until the end of time!  Happy Holidays!

I have been making this for a few years, ever since we moved away from our families, and the entire Thanksgiving meal became my responsibility.  My family loves it, it is the star of the whole meal!  We moved back and I am required to make a "Thanksgiving meal" after the holidays so my family can have the real stuffing! Even our friend who says he hates anything that has cranberries in it loved it!  I also used all fresh herbs, and extra stock as I too cook it outside of the bird.

I made this for Christmas this past year it was quite good. The only real changes I made was that I used half regular sausage and half hot sausage and I left out the liver. I didn't stuff the bird, but rather added a little extra broth and baked, it was great!

This is very good, made it today as a trial run for Thanksgiving.  However I don't think I'll make it for the turkey day as I have several family members who don't like raisins in anything, and I think the dried cranberries are too close to those.  Accidentally way overshot the stock, and it was still good.  Baked in the oven at 350 covered for 40min, then uncovered for 15 min.  Also substituted breakfast sausage.

I've served this stuffing for years now and have even sold trays of it to my girlfriends! It's delish! Also note taht you can substitute bread crumbs from a package instead of performing the (somewhat) tedious task of cubing and toasting all that bread!

Absolutely fabulous!  Was a huge hit for even the toughest critics... a bit of sweet when you get a bit of cranberry, but never too much.  I used the jimmy dean sage sausage and it was wonderful!  I used a bag of pre-made pre-seasoned bread cubes, and it worked really well.  I fear if I had not used pre-seasoned it might have lacked a little. But overall, the best stuffing I've had!  I will use this recipe as much as possible!

Amazing recipe!  I used pre-toasted rustic bread pieces, which saved quite a bit of time and was equally delicious.  I used a full can of whole berry cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries and was very pleased with the outcome - it provided a nice zip!  Definitely double the herbs - you'll be happy you did. Instead of of turkey broth I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth, 1.5 cups chardonnay and mixed that with 1 egg.  I poured that mixture of the stuffing mix and it cooked up wonderfully and was very moist and flavorful.  I cooked in two caseerole dishes covered at 350 degrees and 20 minutes uncovered and it was marvelous.  Everyone was in love with this recipe - I highly recommend it!

An amazing way to easily dress up your Thanksgiving stuffing!! I tried it per the recipe instructions the first time and realized it needed some tweaking to my taste. The second time around, I used herb seasoned cubed stuffing mix instead of toasted bread, which made it a lot easier and very tasty. It ended up needing about 2 cups of broth to moisten it correctly. I also omitted the turkey liver and only used 1/2 lb. of sausage (I used the maple pork sausage and it was way better). Overall, it's a beautiful dish with amazing flavors that I'll be making for years to come!!

This stuffing is so delicious!  I had a 21 lb bird, so I doubled the recipe.  I did add about ½ a cup extra of stock to make it a tad moister.  Not only did it smell wonderful, but the taste is outstanding, and the cranberries added such a beautiful colour.  This will become my standard recipe.

This stuffing is great! I made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it, even my husband who turned up his nose when he saw me making it.  This is a great recipe to play with.  I used corn bread instead of whole wheat and I used the cranberries with the pork sausage and extra chicken broth and left out the liver.  I'll be making this again for Christmas!  Thank you.

I made this recipe for my family and for work.  It was a hit everywhere.  I used a fuji apple, and pork sausage instead of the recommended apple and turkey sausage.  The fuji made it a bit sweeter, which worked well with the spicy pork.  I stuck with the cranberries for the sweet tart flavor, since I'm not a big fan of dried apricots.  

It's been years, and I still come back to this recipe.  I have also added in chestnuts and the flavor is fantastic!

This is a pretty good recipie except the person that wrote it screwed up on the bread amount.....it should be 10-12 cups bread not 1 1/2 ......

I use golden raisins instead of cranberries, and I add mushrooms and use white fresh bread only and add 2 eggs and 4-6 celery stalks and 2 large onions, its pretty easy to make a good stuffing once you get the texture and spices right....grated orange rind is good in stuffing as well!

Was intrigued by the high ratings and decided to give it a shot. I was invited to a Thanksgiving dinner and asked to bring dressing as the person who usually made it was not able to come. I was also told it was very popular...no pressure. Not only was this unanimously voted the best dish at the dinner and by far superior to the usual dressing but most said it was the best dressing they ever had. Score! I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. 11 people just about finished off the double. I used a mixture of fresh sourdough and wheat breads in the recommended proportions(which I cubed the night before to let them dry a little longer)and after toasting added 2 cups of packaged cornbread stuffing mix. Then to compensate I pulled out two cups of the mix to make a side veggie portion just in case. I used the JD sage pork sausage and Craisns. I omitted the liver and used about double the stock as it was baked in a 9 x 13 pan separately. I also used salted butter and about 6 TBS. I baked the double recipe in one covered 9 x 13 pan for about 50 minutes and then removed the top and baked it for another 10 minutes. It was then heated just prior to dinner uncovered for another 10 minutes. Perfection! I will definitely make this again.

First time making stuffing and it was a success! I used a regular baguette and whole wheat bread, omitted the liver, used twice as much stock (I used chicken) as stated, and cooked covered in a Pyrex for 40 minutes and 15 minutes uncovered. Will definitely make again!

Made this with vegetarian sausage crumbles "fausage" from Morningstar farms and homemade bread crumbs of french and wheatberry bread. None of my carnivore friends complained about the 'fausage', even the picky ones. Instead they all RAVED over the dish. It's quite good! I intend to make this for holiday gatherings from here on out! Try it veggie style, you won't be disappointed!

Very good!  I made a few slight changes: 1) used sage pork sausage 2) subbed in a tsp of poultry seasoning for the sage 3) used chicken stock instead of turkey 4) put everything in a 9x13 and baked at 350 for an hour (30 min with foil on top), so I added in about a cup more chicken stock, 5) omitted the turkey liver since I didn't have one.  Came out really good & my picky Dad even commented that he liked it.  Maybe next time though I would omit the butter, as it was overpowering in a few bites.  All in all, VERY good - thanks for sharing!

I have made this stuffing 3 times now. I always cook it outside of the bird in a casserole dish. I, like other reviewers, add more broth and I also add wine. I generally add a few dashes more herbs and I usually leave out the turkey liver.  I live near Willie Bird's turkey farm which makes an amazing cajun turkey sausage which is perfect and spicy for this dish. I add about 4 cloves of garlic to the recipe since I can't seem to cook without it. I also throw in a handful or tow extra of cranberries and it is amazing.

This dressing was very good.  I was a bit nervous, thinking it might be too seasoned for my groups, but everyone loved it.  I quadrupled the recipe and had 13 at the dinner table.  There was a small bit left over and that is now gone (the morning after Thanksgiving).

This really is the best stuffing ever!  I have been making this recipe every Thanksgiving for years and everyone loves it.  I tweak it a little to suit our tastes but keep the basic recipe the same.  We prefer more tart and less sweet apples so I use what we have on hand usually Macintosh or Jonathan.  If there are liver-phobes coming to dinner I sub chopped pecans.  Everything else I leave as written.  However, when pinched for time I use 2 packages of Stove Top Cornbread Stuffing in place of the bread and it is delicious!  No turkey stock?  Don't let that stop you, just sub chicken stock.  You really need to give this recipe a try.  I think it will become your traditional stuffing recipe just like it has ours.  Now, I'm hungry for Thanksgiving!

I made this for a work potluck and it was a hit! I bought stuffing cubes rather than making my own and I omitted the liver. I didn't have turkey sausage so I used sausage with sage flavor. It was a bit spicier than I had hoped, but people still loved it. I'll repeat what somewhat else posted - this stuffing does not stick together. Its a little more dry than others I've tried. So just be aware of that so you know what to expect.

I'd say awesomest, if such a word existed.  This is always our Thanksgiving stuffing.  Even my great cook of a grandmother who doesn't eat much goes back for seconds on this one.  Although I'm sure it tastes just as good with the turkey liver, I can never bring mysef to put it in!  Also, if you can commit to the fat, the flavor from actual pork sausage (drained) instead of the turkey sausage pushes this into "phenominal" territory.  Thank you thank you thank you to whoever created this!

Incredible!  I accidently added 3/4 cup parsley and it tasted great (not overpowering).  I didn't add the turkey liver either.   Double recipe for 5 or more people if you want leftovers.

This was wonderful! I'm not a fan of stuffing and I went back for 2nds! I used a Rosemary-Garlic bread along with potato bread. I also used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage instead of Turkey sausage. I did cut down on the sage & rosemary by a 1/3 because of the bread and sausage. I actually dried my own cranberries and used 2 apples, one Granny Smith and one Delicious. (It's what I had) No turkey liver either just a bit more chicken stock (instead of turkey). I baked it for one hour in a 9X13 in glass dish. The sage was not overpowering which I don't like.  This went to a potluck and was one of several stuffings but the only one gone at the end.

Best stuffing I've ever had!  I made this exactly as written, except I used a bag of pre-cubed, seasoned white and wheat bread (Pepperidge Farm Country Style stuffing).  I don't know if the ratio of white to wheat breads was what is written, although the total amount of bread was correct.  I also made the sausage mixture the day before and refrigerated it, drippings and all.  I don't like to stuff the turkey, so while the bird was roasting, I heated the sausage up, mixed everything together, and kept it warm in a crock pot on low.  DELICIOUS.  It's moist without being soggy or "gloppy," and the brown and white breads, diced onion, celery, liver, and apple, mixed with the cranberries all make a very attractive dish.

this was very good, would make a great stuffing for turkey, chicken or pork. i stuffed a chicken roaster with it. my family loved it, but alas they are diehards for the traditional bread, onion, celery stuffing that we grew up on. i will probably end up just using this recipe for stuffing chix breasts or pork chops...i did alter slightly. i used half the amount of bread and substituted the other half with corn bread i made. this makes alot, so if you are stuffing a chicken or a few chops, cut the recipe in 1/2. i took the excess and put it in dish, cooked and served as a side. i did add about 3/4 cup chicken broth to it and covered it while cooking to keep it moist and it turned out excellent. cooked the side for about one hour

I made this for a dish to pass at my in-laws Thanksgiving dinner. My MIL makes Stove Top along with traditional stuffing because my husband won't touch her stuffing. I'm not too crazy about it either. Anyhow, I made this, my husband reluctantly tried it and ABSOLUTELY loved it! I thought it was pretty good, also. My six year old thought it was cool to have cranberries (Craisens) in her dressing! I made it in a 13x9 pan, baked it at 350 deg F for about 45 minutes. I also used 2 and 2/3 cups stock, it seemed to dry to me while mixing it. Turned out beautifully and it's very eye-appealing!

I made this stuffing for our thanksgiving dinner..(canadian)..I always use sausage in my stuffing, but the addition of the dried cranberries and apple gave it a wonderful flavour..I still had fresh thyme growing in the garden and used that..I think it made a difference..not your boring dressing any longer..this was great!

I tried it with pork sausage and dried apricots, and it came out lovely! My husband can't get enough of it. Very easy to make too.

have made this stuffing for a few years now, with previously noted changes - sage sausage, fresh herbs, craisins, granny smith apples, pepperidge farm breadcrumbs, chicken broth - baked in the turkey. in my opinion, the only stuffing recipe you will ever need.  it has cemented my reputation as THE cook w/ friends & family, and is now our traditional, pass down recipe for thanksgiving!  my friend james requests a container as his only christmas present, and eats it cold b/c he can't wait to warm it up!

Very good stuffing!  I pretty much went by the recipe but cut the sausage in half, along with used fresh herb, didn't add in the liver, and since I was baking in a dish added a lot more liquid.  I at first added in chicken stock and then while my turkey was resting I got some turkey juices and added some more while the stuffing was baking in the oven.  I baked at 350 for about an hour covered.  I didn't need to uncover because the stuffing seemed to be at the moisture and dryness that I like it which is about in between both of them.  I dont like it dry, but dont like it wet.  :)  This dressing was very filling, A little too filling, so next time I will omit the turkey sausage.  I felt it really didn't need it since you couldn't really taste it in it.  I made this a day ahead of time, leaving the bread and sausage separate, and threw in the liquid and apples all together at the last minute before baking.  Also since I had onions and celery stewing together with my turkey juices, I went ahead and added some of them into my dressing as well.  Thanks for this great dressing!  I loved the addition of cranberries and apples!

I guess we are a traditional bread and celery stuffing family.  The apples part worked, but not the sausage and cranberries.  Thanks for the recipe though,  it rocked the rest of the way :)

Really, really delicious. I took this recipe to our church christmas dinner and both casserole dishes were one of the first to be emptied despite my husband bringing me home HOT Italian Sausage because he couldn't find the Turkey Sausage i asked for. I did add twice as much broth because of baking out side of the turkey and also to allow for extra time in the oven just keeping warm. But other then that no changes were made and I loved it.

Yes, this is awesome all right!  I followed instructions from a reviewer to make it outside the bird (P-Chan).  Make sure to use extra liquid if cooking it this way.  Didn't have the turkey liver, but it was great anyway.

Awesome!
I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was delicious!  It was fairly simple to prepare and has lots of the flavours you want to complement the rest of the meal.
I used regular sausage because, well, it's Christmas and it was ridiculously good.

This IS THE stuffing recipe you have been looking for!  I was overly generous with fresh herbs, and also made the dish a day before but added extra broth at the last minute (as others suggested).  Because the stuffing is visually pleasing as much as it is palette pleasing, I used cranberry trail mix instead of cranberry and walnuts alone.  The extra nuts added a fancy flair.  Get ready for OOOdles of compliments!

I thought this was pretty good but I'm not sure it was really worth the effort. My stuffing definitely dried out a bit and the husband found the fruit taste to be a little overpowering so I will probably reduce the fruit next time to make this a little more savory instead of sweet.

I felt guilty not commenting on this recipe. I cooked it for this past Christmas, and everyone loved it. There was one person that did not, but they didn't like cranberries so I didn't take it to heart. I used the comments from other recipes which helped plenty. I stuffed the turkey with some, and baked the rest separately. I added more turkey / chicken broth on the stuffing that I baked so it wouldn't dry out. I didn't use the giblets at all. I used a combination of white bread stuffing, potato bread stuffing, and corn bread stuffing. It was great! I'm sure I'll be making it next year as well.

I'm rating this on behalf of my family because I do not eat stuffing.  But I did make this for Thanksgiving for all the stuffing lovers.  It got pretty good reviews, though it was a wee bit dry (I did not stuff it in the turkey and used extra stock instead).  However, with some gravy over it everyone said it was perfect.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and it always gets requested for Christmas! It's the most popular dish at the holiday meal. I use Granny Smith apples, but that's the only change I make. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best stuffing I have ever had!  I have made it for the last six years for Thanksgiving.  It is so much better than traditional stuffing.  I don't stuff the bird with it.  I put it in a lasagna pan and cover with foil for about an hour.  Then I remove the foil and let it bake for about 30 minutes.  It is even good reheated!

This stuffing is amazing! This is my second year making it and everyone in my family loves it. The second time I made it the night before. I used ciabatta bread, and fresh herbs. I toasted the bread like the recipe calls for, and mixed it in with the other ingredients. I let the sausage, onion, celery, and herb mixture rest before mixing it into the bread. I put it in a casserole dish with nobs of butter and covered it with seran wrap. Then the next day just added the stock and baked it in the over for about 30-45 mins at 350. Outstanding!

I don't know what I can add with so many previous reviews. I have been making the same family recipe for years, one i never really like. I really do not cook like my family, preferring fresh, from scratch, and whole foods. I used this recipe for the first time last year and chose it because I felt it was a good compliment to the brine and from scratch cranberry sauce (cranberry sauce extraordinaire from this site)- both also first time choices. They did compliment each other beautifully. Will never cook another turkey without brining. And will never go back to grandma's stuffing. Used all fresh herbs and found an apple sage pork sausage that added a perfect touch. I used fresh cranberries as well. I used a basic homemade bread recipe and made it from scratch too. Fabulous recipe!

I have made this stuffing for a few years and it is by far the best stuffing I've ever had. The TWO ingredients that you should NOT substitute is: 1) FRESH  herbs 2) Homemade Turkey stock.  I have made the stuffing using dried herbs and chicken stock and you CAN tell the difference!  The flavor is not the same.  I bake my stuffing in a foil covered casserole dish for 30 min and uncovered for 15 min.

In some way, shape or form, I've been using this recipe off and on for about 6 years now for each Thanksgiving.   Since my wife and I are vegetarians, we don't use the sausage (obviously), but my other suggestion has to due with the cubed bread, a la stuffing itself. I have made cut up my own bread before, and it works fine, though a bit tedious since you do have to leave the bread out at least 2 days for it to harden. To save yourself some time, just go to the store and buy cubed breading: it's easier and the taste is the same.  My final indication that this recipe rocks comes from my sister-in-law, who makes professional birthday cakes and whose cooking is at least four stars. I'm pretty much told not to come to Thanksgiving unless I bring this stuffing.

This really was awesome. Even people who didn't like stuffing loved it. I followed another reviewer's instructions for cooking it without the turkey at 350 degrees  for 40 min covered then 15 uncovered. Cooking it separate I also used about a cup or so extra stock to keep it moist. I also left out the liver.

Amazingly good! My whole family agreed this is a great recipe. I probably will never use a different dressing recipe. I actually made this a year ago and went looking for it for Thanksgiving this week and was surprised to find that I had forgotten to review it.
The combination of spices and the fruit is perfect. My mom made delicious dressing but never measured, and I've tried thru the years to come up with something like hers. However, this one is better!  I used pork sausage instead of turkey, added cornbread to the white and whole wheat bread cubes, and omitted the turkey liver. I also baked the dressing in a dish, not inside the turkey. I do not squeeze and mush the bread with the liquid, but blend it gently, that's just the way my mom made it and what I prefer. If you bake it in a dish, you might need to add a little more broth, keep it covered with foil for about 30 minutes, removing the foil just at the end.

I did a test run of this recipe.  Caution: DO NOT use cheap sausage!  I used a bargain brand for my test run and you could tell.  Also, the test run did not bind together very well so I am going to take another user's suggestion and add an egg.  I used one 14 oz can of chicken broth and texas toast and cooked it in a casserole dish with foil.  Came out very moist.  Can't wait to try a tweaked version on Thanksgiving!

Awesome recipe!  I only had dry herbs and no dried cranberries and it still turned out great.  I used chicken hearts and gizzards (1/2 pound) and I baked the stuffing at 350 for 1 hour.  It was perfect not too soggy just as written!  I had never made stuffing before but it was great!

It's right there in the name - AWESOME!  I omit the turkey liver; not my thing.  I also use sage or regular pork sausage; cannot often find the turkey variety.  My absoulte favorite dish on the thanksgiving table!  A+!

We loved this stuffing! I made several changes that I think only enhance the overall recipe. Instead of whole wheat bread I used Mrs. Cubbison's Cornbread Stuffing along with the white bread. I increased the white bread to 4 cups and the cornbread to 2 cups, used regular pork sausage, and subbed two teaspoons of poultry seasoning for the rosemary, which I think gave it a richer taste. I also increased the cranberries and the broth to one cup, and left out the turkey liver. My final addition was 1/3 cup of chopped toasted pecans. It was by far the best stuffing I have ever made! Never again the Stove Top sage type stuffing for us! The combination of flavors made it the hit of my Thanksgiving table!

I made this stuffing last year for T-giving, and substituted anduille sausage for the turkey sausage.  It really spiced it up and gave it a great, distinct flavor.  Everyone LOVE it...there were no leftovers!  Of course I'm making it again this year!

This stuffing was true to its name: AWESOME! Instead of using ground sausage I used a kielbasa and loved the results. I prepared everything a few days before and threw it all together on Thanksgiving and it still turned out great. Even my Father in law was impressed!

Great recipe , seems you can make many substitutions and still comes out great.  Used sweet italian sausage, cornbread (instead of whole wheat), and dried cranberries.  Great next day on Turkey sandwiches.

I made this stuffing in 1999 and am making it again this year.  It was wonderful and everybody loved it.  I did not use apricots.  I used dried cranberries.  Also, this year I will not toast the bread. It was a little too hard.  I am going to let it sit out overnight to harden a bit.  Everyone is looking forward to having it again!

The flavor of this recipe is amazing.  I followed the recipe, using recommendations from the reviewers. I will be making this again, but next time, I may do a few things different. My biggest issue with it was the consistency...there is so much going on, such as meat, cranberries, bread,etc, that it just kind of crumbled into a not so "stuffing-like" mixture of stuff.  I don't want to remove any of the flavors, but next time, I may increase the bread  in order to see if I can make it into a more traditional consistency.  Secondly, the liver got lost in all of the flavors, so I don't think it is necessary.  I will leave it out next time.  As reviewers suggested, I tried sourdough bread, which was awesome; I bought the sage sausage, so I decreased the real sage by 1/2tsp, and I added pecans to the mix.  Since I didn't have a turkey to stuff, I poured 2 and 3/4cups of turkey stock over the mixture and cooked for 40 min covered at 350 and then an additional 20 min uncovered.  I got rave compliments.  This is my new go-to recipe for stuffing!

This is the second year that I have made this stuffing, it's amazing!!! I omit the liver, and I don't cook it in the turkey, I cook it in a 9x13 casserole dish. I add extra turkey or chicken stock to it when I pop it in the oven, and cover it with foil for the first 1/2 of the cooking time. Stir it when I take the foil off, and then it will get slightly browned and crispy on top when it finishes. I also made mine the day before, take it out that morning at let it get to room temp before I bake it so it wouldn't take forever. I just didn't add the broth and butter until it was time to bake it. My biggest suggestion, is to use pork sausage. The first year I used pork sausage and it was more flavorful and moist. This year I decided to go by the recipe and I used the turkey sausage and it wasn't as good. Still a great recipe, but it's SO much better with the pork!

I've been making this for years now and love it. I've even made a vegan version of this for some guests using vegetable stock, vegan butter, and vegan Italian sausage. It was delicious and my vegan guests loved it so much they requested the recipe. I always use fresh herbs when possible and keep extra stock on hand to prevent it from drying out. Use it to stuff an acorn squash and you have a complete meal. Delicious ??

Yep, it's awesome. I had never made stuffing before, and I usually don't even eat the stuff (har har) because I never thought it tasted good... UNTIL this recipe. Instant "classic." Very tasty and not over-powering. The perfect blend.

I have a problem of making too much when company comes, which turned out to be an amazing blessing as I had a bunch left over.  Downside- I can't stop eating it;) 
I omitted the turkey liver as I used the neck/liver/other bits from the inside of turkey to line the roasting pan to make more flavorful gravy.
I used about double the bread crumbs and glad I did- it still seemed a bit thin. But that could be because I'm used to a very bread centered stuffing.
Fresh herbs are a pain but soooo worth it.
Baked outside bird ahead of time @ 350F for 45 min foil on/ 15 min more foil off. Then just reheated it when turky came out of oven.
Added an extra 3/4 cup of stock...key is if you use meat sausage or not as some moisture will come from here too.
I will make this every chance I get! 
Beauty of it is that it could be a meal unto itself:)

Followed the advice of other reviewers and put in an extra cup of chicken broth. Was worried that it would be too dry, but the extra broth really helped. Cooked it at 40 minutes at 350, covered in foil, then uncovered for the last 10 minutes. I used a combination of cornbread, sourdough, and whole wheat bread. The cornbread is a must .. so glad I took the time to make it separately to put in! I think next time, I would substitute the sourdough entirely for whole wheat bread pieces (to be healthier!) and it wouldn't make a difference: the broth and melted butter gave it enough flavor that it wasn't dry at all. The mix of FRESH spices really made a difference in taste; every mouthful was so flavorful! Would make this again - everyone loved it! Although my sister kept saying she wished that there was some cranberry sauce to go with it (personally, I think it can stand on its own!) :)

This has been my turkey day stuffing for several years now.  I do sub the bread for bagged stuffing mix sometime using one bag and one loaf of bread.  If using the bagged herb stuffing I omit the seasonings. I use pork sausage. Mine fed 7 adults, 5 kids and we had leftovers!

This is the first stuffing that I've made using cranberries or apples and it was pretty good.  I might make it again.

This is my GO TO recipe every Thanksgiving now!  My guests were raving about the many flavors this offers.  I was leery of the sausage overpowering the recipe but it doesn't at all.  MELDS in well.  I had my heart set on a CORNBREAD dressing so that's the only change I made.  I used cornbread in place of the WHITE bread and left the whole wheat as recipe calls for.  Unbelievably delicious!!  GREAT recipe!!!

Made this twice, one with jimmy dean ground maple sausage and one with an apple sausage that I cut up.  Everyone said that they both were good, but the ground maple sausage was the hands down winner. People who don't normally eat stuffing were having seconds and thirds!

This was the first stuffing I made 10 years ago, I've never looked for another because I love this one so much.  The apple and cranberry add colour and unexpected sweetness that I'd never had before.  In fact I'm spoiled, I don't like any of the recipes I grew up with anymore.

What can I say that hasn't been said?!?  Excellent, everyone loved it.  The highlight of the Christmas dinner.  Even my wife said "It's a keeper, make it every time!".  Used JD sage sausage and dried herbs, still tasty.  Used slightly more stock then put it in a greased 9x13 pan for 30 minutes @ 350f, covered.  Left uncovered at the end for 10 minutes, just so it wasn't mushy.  Came out perfect!!  Your turkey cooks much more evenly and quickly if not stuffed.

This was very very good. Everyone loved this recipe. I will be using this from now on. Like others I did make some general changes. Used 10 cups of cubed bread, 2 cups of onion, 2 cups of celery, 2 large apples (Jonagold), 1 cup dried cranberries, 2 1/2 cups stock, 2 eggs. Also used 1 pound Sage Pork Sausage. Baked at 375 covered with foil for 30 mins and uncovered for 30 mins. Yielded a large 16 X 10 Pyrex baking dish.

I use to prepare the same wonderful oyster stuffing every year calling it "tradition".  So, about five years ago, when I realized how predictable my special dinner had become, I started using a different recipe every year.  Today, I used this one.   I have to tell you, it went over so well, we could hardly wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow (I always cook more than needed, just in case).  I followed the recipe exactly except for the following changes as recommended by reviewers.  I chose to go with the Pepperidge Farm, Country-Style mix of white and wheat cubes, and I'm so glad I did.  I also added one-fourth cup of Madeira wine and, because I did not stuff the bird with this, I used the whole can of turkey broth.  I just went for it.  Again, thank you to reviewers. I used Jimmy Dean's sage-flavored sausage.  Three last tips if you want the same rave reviews.  First, dig that grose liver out of the turkey, saute it until browned, but still pink in the middle, then pulvarize it in the food chopper, just get it all in.  It's the magic ingredient!  (Sometimes we have to look the other way).  Second, use real fresh or frozen cranberries.  It makes a world of difference.  They gently pop in your mouth and add a surprise to every bite.  Third, use fresh herbs whenever possible.  (I use a little coffee bean grinder to get them down to size).  This recipe is an abosolute winner, and a keeper.  Thanks Stacy.

I have made this stuffing a few times but I add my own twist to it. I leave out the sausage for one. Personally, I don't like meat of any kind in my stuffing. Plus, I think it overpowers the turkey, the main star. I add golden raisins, chopped & toasted pecans, leave out the turkey liver and use chicken broth. I also only use FRESH herbs. I sometimes even add roasted chestnuts and/or mushrooms. There are a lot of things you can do to this recipe! All in all it's a very good base. Happy Thanksgiving!

This was sooo good. There aren't even words. My husband was practically drooling over it and had three servings at dinner. I used all potato bread and Jimmy Dean's Sage Pork Sausage as suggested by others. It was absolutely delicious and absolutely gorgeous. I stuffed it right in the turkey and it was nice and moist. Thank you for an AMAZING recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe!  The apple is an absolute must! Without it the whole thing would fall flat.  Also, because I hate to waste, I chopped all of the giblets that come with the turkey, sauteed them in some evoo and garlic and then added them to the mix.  I keep an herb garden that I dry by fall so was able to add both fresh and "mostly" fresh herbs to the stuffing.  The results were mouth watering.  Careful though - this almost surpassed the turkey!

Fantastic! I made this for my family to test the recipe before making it for 300 people at a local church Thanksgiving celebration. I ended up cutting the sausage in half and increasing the bread and stock a little.  I baked in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. I will be making this again on Thanksgiving day-I can't wait to eat it again!

This is now our Thanksgiving Stuffing every year.  Dad and my Hubby love it as do I.  I follow the recipe fairly faithfully as far as quantities but... 1.  I don't usually add the turkey liver 2.  I use Pepperidge Farm sage and onion or Herbed (non cube) style stuffing instead of fresh bread.   3.  I have used both Turkey Brats and Jimmie Dean Sage sausage or a combo.  Lately I have been making it exclusively with the Dean Sage sausage. 4.  Use fresh herbs from the garden (double qty) as we are usually in Florida for Thanksgiving with the folks. 5.  Never stuff the turkey but make this in a separate casserole--covered for most of the cooking time and remove the lid so we get a nice crust for the last 15-30 minutes depending on how many servings I have made. The fresh apple, Turkey Sausage, fresh parsley and dried cranberries really combine so beautifully flavor-wise.  Delicious with Mom's turkey gravy!

I make this while the turkey is cooking and put it in my crock-pot on low or warm until the turkey is done.  This recipe is head and shoulders above any pre-mixed stuffing mix - and fairly simple to make.  The only recipe my hubby specifically asks for each holiday!

Absolutely love this! I have made this many times I made it just as the recipe states the first time and now I play around. Always tastes fabulous. The changes I love are; cocoanut bread and homemade sourdough, chicken sausage, chicken stock.

The best stuffing recipe ever.  We have never stuffed our turkeys in the past.  I surprised the family with this stuffing in our turkey two years ago with rave reviews from everyone.  This brings so much flavor and moistness to the bird.

What a great stuffing recipe!  It’s so different from the boxed kind!  I used Granny Smith apples, sourdough bread, sage sausage, and fresh herbs.  I plan to experiment using different apples, sausage, and bread, but the way I made it was absolutely delicious.  I will likely omit the liver next time since many do not find its taste appealing; I don’t think doing so will cause the recipe’s flavor to suffer much.  Note: this recipe does not taste like the out-of-the-box stuffing—it has a unique and wonderful flavor.  If you are looking for a boxed-stuffing-like recipe, this may not suit you.  However, if you’re looking for a great-tasting dish, try this!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making a similar recipe for years, and it is always a huge hit!    This stuffing is a really great way to use up extra stale bread.  I usually add chopped carrots as well, and sometimes chopped dates, raisins, and apricots instead of cranberries (whatever i have on hand); soaking the chopped dried fruit in boiling water for a few minutes really plumps them up.  I use fresh herbs whenever possible, and to really bring out their flavour, simmer the herbs with the stock/butter mix before adding to the rest.

The only change I made was to omit the liver since my family is not fond of organ meat.

It says something about a recipe when I follow it to the letter - that is unusual for me.  This one required no changes except for more broth if cooking outside the turkey.

Excellent stuffing!

The stuffing was really good, but I think next time I will make it without the apples and cranberries. I just didn't care for the sweetness.  Still a very flavorful recipe.

I have never had such amazing stuffing in my life.  Make sure to use fresh herbs and I used 9 grain bread and sour dough bread for the base.  Fresh cranberries had way more zing so if you use them, cut the amount in half.

This was a big hit! I stuffed it in a 19 lb turkey, and it came out great. 

Things I would do again/differently:

1) Use fresh spices for more vibrant flavor;
2) Add an egg or two or three (depending upon number of servings) for a bit more body;
3) Don't add too much turkey stock... it can be overly moist (but it's still delicious!);
4) Add about 25% more apple than the recipe calls for;
5) Make sure your bread crumbs are not too soft;

This one is a definite repeat!

I thought it was okay (I'm SOO used to Stove Top). It's a nice little medley of different flavors and textures. I cooked the stuffing in a casserole dish at 350 for about an hour. If you're going to go this route, then be sure to periodically add stock to the dish, as it will dry out and become crunchy. The next time that I'll make this dish, I'll most likely take up one reviewer's suggestion and cover it in foil, as I'm sure it'll help seal in the moisture and prevent the dish from drying out as quickly; I bet if I would have done this the first time, I would have given this recipe a 5.

Quite good. I found the sausage to be a bit too much, especially when eaten along side turkey; i will probably use about half the listed amount next time.
Also, i did not add the liver and used chicken stock instead of turkey.  The slight sweetness of the apples and cranberries was wonderful!

I've made this recipe for a few years now, and everyone loves it.  I use 1/2 cornbread and 1/2 white bread.. thats a few days old, for a  nicer texture.  I make the cornbread ahead of time, cube it and slightly toast it.  Then I follow the rest of the recipe to a T!! I;ve made it with fresh and dried herbs depending on what I can track down.  Fresh is better, but even with dried this recipe is delicious.    Not sure what the point of the turkey liver is, but I use it anyway. Tried throwing in 1/2 cup of apple cide once, in the stock..added a little sweetness.

Awesome is the word!  I substituted raisans for cranberries and added another half of an apple per my husband's request.  It was the best stuffing I ever had and the family agreed.  My husband asked if I could just serve it as a meal!

This recipe is outstanding!  Thanks to other reviews, I also omitted the liver and shopped for the sausage with sage.   I didn't have dried rosemary, sage and thyme on hand so I substituted Bell's Seasoning.  I baked it the day before in a cooking bag; transferred it to a buttered casserole to re-heat.  WOW!  A real keeper -- easy and delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner along with the traditional bread and celery stuffing.  I was expecting high praise for it based on all the good reviews.  My mom was the only one (out of 14 guests) that preferred this stuffing. Dont get me wrong, it wasnt bad, I guess the preference was just for the good old traditional stuffing.

I don't know what I did wrong, but no one liked it.  I used turkey kielbasa, ground it in my food processor, browned it and baked.  It wasn't too wet or too dry as I used more broth, like others had suggested.  But the kielbasa was a horrible texture to mix with all the rest of the ingredients.  Maybe I should have used Jimmy Deans sage sausage?

The BEST stuffing I've ever eaten. I didn't have turkey sausage, so I used Bob Evans Sage sausage and it worked out wonderfully. I also wasn't certain if the recipe called for dried ground rosemary or just the rosemary leaves. I used the dried rosemary leaves and it tasted great! I can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving.

Yum!I've been experimenting with different dressing recipes, and this one is a keeper. I added more onion, celery, and bread. I also reduced the sausage (I used Jimmy Dean's Sage) by 25%. Fantastic recipe!

This is the third year that I have used this stuffing recipe. 
I use Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage instead of turkey sausage.
Remember that ingredients have varying amounts of moisture in thema nd you  may need to add a little more or less turkey stock (or chicken broth) to make the consistancy of the stuffing just like your family likes it.

Really good, and pretty simple.  We browned the sausage mixture the day before, and that worked well.  Was a nice change of pace from ordinary stuffing.

Tried this recipe yesterday on Thanksgiving, and was quite disappointed after reading so many positive reviews.  The cranberries and apples seemed to give the dressing quite a tart taste and even after adding more broth it came out dry.  I also made the "Holiday Dressing" from this site and thankfully that one was superb...I have left a review under that recipe....

THIS IS AMAZING! After 30 yrs. of marriage, I FINALLY made 'homemade' dressing & will never go back to boxed!! I made a half portion since it was for only my hubby & me. I used 1/2 'bag' of the pre-cubed, dried bread but didn't use its included seasoning. I used JimmyDean's low fat Regular sausage. For the 'wet ingredients', I used 1 can lower sodium chicken broth, a beaten egg, a spash of Mrs. Buttersworth & the melted REAL butter. For seasoning, I just used some poultry seasoning. And of course, I didn't forget the dried cranberries! Baked in stoneware bowl at 350º until it was obviously 'done' and nicely browned & crusty on top. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for the BEST stuffing recipe I've EVER tasted!!

I made this stuffing last year for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  I was not able to get mild sausage at the grocery store, therefore I used hot.  I wouldnt recommend that.  There were several people there that are not crazy about spicy food, so they would have enjoyed mild much better.  I will definately be making this again this year.

I made this for Thanksgiving AND X-mas this year and everyone loved it - I did vary the recipe a bit by adding a mixture of 3 egg whites and one yolk instead of the stock.  I also soaked the dried cranberrys in Sherry overnight and added a little more sherry to the sausage while cooking - excelent recipe! This one has become a staple in our holiday meals.

Family didn't touch the stuff I made from the box. (just in case this didn't work out!) This is the go-to stuffing now for thanksgiving. I will add though, I made this in the crockpot/slow cooker and just dumped everything in there and cooked it for about 4 hours on high and then 2 more hours on low. I used chicken stock because it's what I had on hand and I added more slowly as needed over the course of it cooking so as not to make it too soggy. You will need to do this if you're using a slow cooker. I did also place a tea towel under the lid to catch condensation and that's really what prevented it from being soggy.

Amazing recipe!  You will not be disappointed. I used unseasoned cornbread stuffing cubes instead of white/wheat - highly recommend.  As others suggested I used sage pork sausage instead of turkey, and I did not think it was too much meat.  I used craisins instead of dried cranberries, left out the liver, and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  I baked it outside of the turkey so I used 4 cups of chicken stock total.  Poured 3 cups initially and when I went to mix it about halfway through I poured another cup.  I also added a bit of salt and pepper to taste.  Remember to bake covered so it stays moist and uncover for last 15 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Unbelievably awesome! I never liked stuffing until now. I used sourdough and multi grain bread, pork sausage, omitted the liver, added extra stock (used chicken stock) and baked in a casserole dish instead of stuffing the turkey. Baked covered in foil at 350 for 40 min, then uncovered for 15 min. Seriously good! Everyone had seconds and some had thirds. I will make this stuffing every time!

Only reason that it was not perfect is that I wish there were better instructions for baking this recipe outside of the bird.  It took some definite tweeking (more liquid than other reviews said and sauteing the apples)... otherwise it is by far the most delicious stuffing I have ever had!

This was a home run on Christmas. The blend of the flavors was fantastic together. I used potato bread and found it to be very substantial and hearty. My bread chunks were cut a bit on the larger side, so as not to turn to "mush". I did have to add a little more broth than called for, though...fantastic overall!

I don't like stuffing, but I promised to make some from scratch for my husband for Thanksgiving. Based on the reviews, I chose this one - and it did not disappoint! My husband (who usually is not a big fan of fruit in any meal) absolutely LOVED this! He said it's the BEST stuffing he ever had and made me promise to repeat this recipe again, next year.  Thanks Stacy!!

This was good. I am not sure what the point of the sausage is - I didn't even notice it in the stuffing so then it was just adding calories without taste. Next time I would forgo the sausage.

One word... fantastic! I'll never make another type of stuffing again.  I used Italian turkey sausage and dried seasonings but will make this with fresh herbs next time as suggested in other reviews.  This recipe makes me look like a better cook than I actually am LOL!!!

Awesome recipe, simple and easy too.  I used Mrs. Cubbison's corn bread stuffing instead of making it from scratch.  I added the sausage, celery, onion as directed.  It was a hit!

Awesome Flavor!  I used dried tart cherries, instead of the cranberries, because I prefer their flavor.  Also, because I wasn't stuffing a bird (made the stuffing to go with cornish hens)  and I didn't want it to be dry, I softened 4 Tbsp butter & mixed it with 1 extra large egg then added that to the drizzling mixture.  Baked in a dish @ 325...& came out perfect...not too dry/not too mushy :)

This is the best stuffing I have ever tasted. I make it every year since I found it on this site. I make it with the maple roast turkey and they are absolutely amazing together.  I am now "required" to bring it to all of our family parties. I have made it with turkey sausage. pork sausage and sage pork sausage and have had great results with all of them. And I agree with some of the other reviews - fresh herbs ARE the best. But if you don't have any it's still fabulous with dried herbs.

I used sourdough bread instead of wheat and white. I used turkey sausage and pork sausage and Smith apple (that't what I had on hand)  and used chicken stock because I could not find the turkey stock. Everything else the same except I do not believe in stuffing the turkey.  I put sage a couple of lemons and a orange and poke them with a fork and put them inside the turkey ( if you do this make sure you put some butter, sage, salt and lemon juice between the skin to give it flavor). I cooked my stuffing separate.   I think it was very good a little on the bland side.  Stuffing is one of my favorites and I like to try other recipes.  I think my grandmother's recipe is the best....will try and put it up with picture at some point. Thanks!

My serving size was for 60.

I doubled the broth since it is for casserole dish

I used 5 eggs. End result was what you would actually use inside a turkey. It needed about 3-4 more eggs, another 1-2 cups broth.

Someone asked when to add the whisked eggs. At the stage that ALL ingredients are being combined. 

I used fresh herbs only on the parsley. I felt that the combination of spices was just mild enough to be there, but not to overwhelm it. Which is how most foods should be. 

You don't want the herbs to drown out the taste of a dish or to interfere with the natural flavors of the other ingredients.

I used 1 pound of chicken liver. Sauteed in garlic, kosher salt, pepper and some paprika. I then put it through a food processor with a little water added . I can tell you that the taste of the meat without the liver and with the liver is completely different. If you almost food processor the liver, you will not get any pieces because it will blend into the juices of he other meat. It certainly makes this recipe much better with it.

The meat I used 4 pounds of turkey sausage, 1 pound jimmy dean sage, and 1 pound jimmy dean original. I have a huge huge Magnalite roaster so I was able to take my electric hand mixer and basically break up the meat really (not pulverize) well once it was all cooked. I also let the meat sit overnight in the fridge to let the flavors soak in.

Everyone loved it and no leftovers. I will be making this again. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is so delicious and easy.  It has become our Thanksgiving traditional stuffing.  Over the years, I have made changes to suit our taste.  Here is our version -- I use stuffing "croutons" from a stuffing mix for convienence,  I don't bake this in the turkey, so I use 2 to 2-1/4 cups of chicken stock (I can never find turkey stock).  I also use sage sausage as others recommeneded, and I omit the turkey liver.  The rest is the same.  If you want to make this a day ahead, you can.  Make it as usual, but DON'T add the chicken stock or butter.  Put it in the fridge and cover.  Then next day, remove from the fridge and add your stock and melted butter and put it in a buttered baking dish.  Bring to room temp and then bake at 350 for 40 minutes covered and then 20 more uncovered.  So delicious!  Happy Thanksgiving!

OMG!  Even my kids who will NOT eat stuffing of any kind, loved this (I didn't refer to it as stuffing).  I tried it out for our office Thanksgiving luncheon.  Rave reviews from all who ate it!  This will be my recipe from now on.
I did use sage pork sausage instead of the turkey, but that was the only change I made.

I have made this twice. Everyone loves it but this year I will use ground Italian sausage, pkg & sold by the pound. A tiny 'trial batch' using the italian sausage & fresh hurbs was AWSOME. I, too use an egg and a splash of white wine.

Wow...really yummy!  I am not traditionally a 'stuffing' lover, but since we were hosting this year, I opted to make this stuffing...loved the addition of sausage and cranberry/apples!  Made this outside of the turkey in a pan, used all fresh herbs.  Left out the turkey liver and used veggie stock and a mix of sourdough and baguette.  Made it for both Christmas Day and Boxing Day celebrations!

OMG!  So very easy to make and so very delicious!  I did a double recipe yesterday morning for turkey dinner for 15 people and it was almost all gone by the time that dinner was over.  Rave reviews all around.  This is now my "go to" recipe as far as stuffing goes.  One hint re: the bread cubes... if your bakery sells day-old bread cubes, USE THEM... not only does it cut out the need to have to cut the bread, the cubes will soften up when you add the butter & turkey stock.

I made this for our Christmas dinner and it was by far the best stuffing I have ever eaten!  I made it the night before and placed it in an electric buffet server when it came meal time.  I used honey crisp apple and omitted the liver.  I also used low sodium chicken broth rather than turkey stock and added one cup since it wasn't being stuffed into a turkey.  I will make this one again for sure!

I made this for my first hosted Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit! I baked it instead of stuffing the turkey with it and I used fresh herbs instead of dried so I doubled the amounts in the recipe. The rosemary was a bit strong so I would reccommend going easier on that. But everyone said it was great and the smell was unbelievable! People were dying to get at the stuffing just as bad as the turkey!

I have been making my same basic stuffing every year since 1972 and after seeing this recipe decided to try something new this year.  As the name says, this is an awesome stuffing recipe.  I used ready made Pepperidge Farm Cubed Stuffing, the Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage and fresh herbs instead of dried as suggested by many of the reviewers.  This was great and the whole family loved it.  My husband said it is much better than my traditional stuffing which he has always liked.  What I liked is that it was really good reheated the next day which made me sorry I didn't make a double batch for Thanksgiving.  Give this recipe a try and you won't be dissappointed.

This stuffing was great.  I went the easy route and used bagged stuffing mix, and I used pork sausage instead of turkey and ommitted the liver because I didn't have it.  It came out really good, very tasty and I'll be making it every Thanksgiving from now on.  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. I decided to cook this out of the bird so to ward off drying out, I doubled the broth (approx) and used fresh spices (I doubled those as well).    I baked it in a 9 x 13 dish covered with foil at 350 for about an hour, checking every 15-20 min or so to ensure it was not drying out. For the last ten minutes, I took off the foil and took up the temp to 450 to ensure a nicely browned top.  All in all very yummy! Everyone loved it!

Just as it says, "Awesome".  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving.  I used fresh Cranberries instead of dried and sprinkled the dried Cranberries on top for added color.

Important: If you are making this outside the bird, make it with chicken BROTH not stock. Broth is from meat and stock is from bones -- you need flavor from meat to make this stuffing savory. I made it with both broth & stock and the BROTH version was WAY better. Made with both fresh & dried herbs on seperate occasions and couldn't really tell a difference, although the fresh herbs were pretty.

I used Jimmy Dean sage pork sausage instead of turkey. Also... on Thanksgiving I made 2 batches - one for His family and one for mine. The one for His family was AWESOME, but the one for mine tasted a little off. Good, but something was missing. Then I realized I forgot the butter on the second batch -- it does make a difference! Also, I thought this tastes better with sweet dried cranberries I got from Whole Foods than with Craisins.

Excellent recipe! Just made this yesterday and I didn't have a turkey to stuff this into, so I used my crock pot as a surrogate and it came out great. Didn't make any major mods, but I didn't have turkey stock so I used chicken instead and it is still stellar. If you like stuffing, you will enjoy this recipe, no doubt.

AMAZING! It was my first time making stuffing of any kind. I took it to a church dinner and received rave reviews. Instead of fresh bread, I bought sage/thyme seasoned dried bread cubes. I used 1cup of chicken stock i/o turkey stock, next time I will use maybe 1/4cup more. I omitted the turkey livers, added extra of the seasonings listed and salt and pepper. Instead of stuffing the turkey, I baked for an hour, stirring after 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested. It has been requested for second Thanksgiving dinner.

We were not fond of this recipe.  I had high hopes but thought it was an odd combination of flavors.  I will stick to traditional stuffing from now on.  I used fresh herbs and did not stuff the bird...just cooked in a separate dish.    ;(

Cooked this in my deep covered baker (piece of Pampered Chef stoneware). Cooked at 400 for 45 minutes. Stirred after 30 minutes. Used granny smith apple, reduced fat pork sausage, and dried herbs that it called for. Left out parsely because I accidently bought cilantro :( But it tasted so good, I guess it didn't need the parsely. Used probably a whole cup of chicken stock (the store didn't have turkey.) Oh I also used about 7 cups total of sourdough bread. I left the pieces out uncovered over night to dry them a little. It was the best stuffing EVER!

I had been using a very traditional bread stuffing recipe in the past but decided to kick it up a bit with this version. WOW am I glad that I did.  One of my guests said that she usually hates stuffing...well, she had 2 servings.  This one changed her mind!

Well, I really thought this sounded great, since I've only done the boxed stuffing before, but didn't want to gamble with the Thanksgiving Turkey.  So, I made it, with some modifications, tonight with a roasted chicken and it is out of this world!  Here are the modifications: no liver; used canned chicken broth; used a box of Stove-top rather than the 2 kinds of bread cubes, less spices because Stove-top is already spiced.  Hubby rarely comments one way or the other, voluntarily said "this is GREAT!"  Asked him if he thought it is good enough for Turkey Day & he said "SURE!"  SO, I intend to stick to the recipe as written (still minus the liver, though) for our Thanksgiving Turkey and I can't wait!!  This is REALLY REALLY good stuff!!

I thought this stuffing could have used about half as much sausage. It felt pretty heavy.  But it was quite delicious, even still!  I will definitely make this again - just cut back on the sausage.

I have made this dressing for years. It is demanded whether I cook at home or go to family or friends for holiday dinners. I do cheat a little and use a bag of seasoned bread crumbs, sage pork sausage, poultry seasoning instead of all the individual spices and skip the liver. Fantastic!!

I wanted this flavor combination but wanted to make it the quick and easy way...so I cheated. I used the boxed cranberry dressing (it already has the herbs/spices) so all I added was the apples and the sausage. This was absolutely amazing...we had nothing left of it after Thanksgiving dinner...even my son who hates stuffing loved this!

Thanksgiivng morning and I just made this stuffing.  It is wonderful.  The mix of the cranberries, apples and sausage is better than I expected.  I used the pre-bagged stuffing cubes and kept it covered with foil.   Excellent

I've been eyeing this since last Thanksgiving and just made it this past weeeknd. I used sour dough and wheat bread that I toasted as others suggested. I also used the sage sausage (the blue jummy dean one). THe taste was EXCELLENT. im not a big sage fan and this def had the right amount.

I made this for my 2nd Thansgiving and really pumped up the spices. I did have to add a bit more moisture, but that's expected when you have one stove and over with mega sides to make!

Great! I actually admit to crossing this w/ a Sandra Lee recipe and used boxed stuffing....I know, I know.... but it was great!

Thanks!

I made this stuffing along with my grandmother's traditional Southern cornbread dressing.  I loved the flavors of this, but the texture seemed rather odd to me - maybe I used the wrong kind of bread?  People definitely preferred the cornbread dressing. Since there was so much left over this morning I covered the remaining stuffing with an egg/milk mixture, sprinkled with cheese and baked for about 30 minutes.  It made an awesome brunch - will probably make the stuffing again but try with cornbread or croutons.

Made this last Thanksgiving and it was wonderful!  So flavorful!  I did not add the turkey liver and substituted chicken broth for the turkey broth.  It was great leftover with scrambled eggs too as a quick brunch!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and I received mixed reviews about it. I don't know if preparing it the night before made a difference or not but next time I will serve it fresh from the bowl. I, on the other hand, absolutely loved it. I was so proud of myself for finally stepping out of my ritual of using my famous Stove Top. :) Definitely a 5 star recipe and yes, I did omit the turkey liver.

BEST STUFFING EVER HANDS DOWN.  I got this recipe a few days before Thanksgiving, and I have to admit that I was nervous trying it for the first time ever with a house full of guests . . . but I'm really glad I did.  Every person at dinner SERIOUSLY said that it was the best stuffing they'd ever had.  The only change I made was that instead of turkey sausage I used sage sausage instead.  FANTASTIC!

This was phenomenal before it went in the turkey, but it tasted terrible after it cooked in the bird. It smelled great and made the turkey taste good, but I would only make this again OUTSIDE the bird.

This got raves from everyone and I will definitely make it again. I made it outside the turkey and cooked it covered with tin foil at 350F for 50 min., then uncovered for 10 min. more. To make up for the lack of moisture from the turkey, I covered the whole thing with strips of bacon for the first 50 min. Then took the bacon off so it could brown. (I ate the bacon separately.)  This is great dressing.

Like everyone says, this recipe is amazing. I could see the nervousness in my husband, (who is not very adventurous when it comes to food) when I told him what was in this recipe, but he and all of my Thanksgiving guests had seconds! To clear up room in the oven, I put this in a slow cooker on high for 2-3 hours, (it was probably ready after two.) I like my stuffing somewhat moist so I added 1 1/4 cups of turkey stock (instead of the 3/4 recommended) and it came out perfectly.

I've used this basic recipe for over 20 years and it's the best... It's never turned out the same each time because I do many variations, such as.... sometimes I'll use wild rice in the mix or mushrooms. It all depends on what I have on hand. You can't go wrong. I also like to grate up the giblets and add them too. Go easy on the cranberries, tho. They can over power the dish. I'll stuff the bird because that makes the most moist stuffing. I'll put the rest in a casserole dish, but the best is from the bird.

I have used this recipe for my last 3 holiday dinners and I always get rave reveiws.  I made a rosemary butter turkey and it compliments it very well.  I love all the flavours in this stuffing.  The only thing I changed was that I used all white bread.  This is my offical holiday stuffing.

I brought this recipe to an office Thanksgiving party and it was the big hit! I substitute extra turkey or chicken stock in place of the butter to make it a little lighter, but just as moist.

Great complexity of flavors. I never have found a stuffing recipe that my family likes and this one they loved. I left out the turkey liver and did not stuff the turkey and made it in a 13x9.  I think next time I will add a little more stock. It was just slightly drier than I would have liked, but I think that was because I didn't stuff it in the bird which would add moisture. Great recipe!

It was a very nice stuffing. If you want to prepare it outside the bird you might need to add 1/3 cup of extra broth otherwise it can be a little bit dry. I included the liver and surprisingly it was not even evident, it actually enhances the taste. I would recommend to prepare extra amount as everybody will want to get a second plate.

This was my second year making this recipe.  Last year for my immediate family and this year for a group of complete strangers! (Roommate's family).  It was such a sensation that I've given the recipe out to appease the wife & taste buds of the 80 year old man who could not eat enough of it...and he HATED STUFFING EVERY YEAR UNTIL NOW!
My changes in this recipe include using Farmer John's MAPLE FLAVORED pork sausage links.  It's sweet and adds a wonderful flavor.  Also, I like to toss in about 2 TBSP of Jamaican Jerk Spice...it's my secret zing in nearly everything I make.  Try this and ENJOY!!!

WOW!!! What a great recipe. I had given up on trying to make homemade stuffing years ago because mine always came out terrible year after year. After I found this recipe I decided to give it one more shot...and with great results. My family was a little skeptical at first but they ended up eating every bite. It really made the Thanksgiving meal complete. I think I can safely retire my box of Stove Top. I plan on making this for Christmas dinner with an apricot glazed ham, so to compliment the meat I am going to omit the cranberries this time and use dried apricots. Also, I left out the liver and used sage sausage which provided all the seasoning needed for this recipe.

This was really delicious!  I served it at Thanksgiving and my father in law wants the recipe.  I added wild rice, pecans, added an extra apple, and left out the chopped chicken liver.  It was wonderful!  I am making it for Christmas.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  The flavor was great, but it was too dry and crumbly.  Next time I'll add more bread and broth.

We had 15 people to dinner on Thanksgiving and everyone (including those who didn't particularly like stuffing)loved this recipe. I used pork sausage, a big red onion and left out the turkey liver. The combination of white and dark bread cubes and red berries made a pretty combination and it smelled and tasted delicious.

Loved this recipe!  I used a spicy sausage which was great with the cranberry flavor.  A perfect "prepare a day ahead" recipe.  Received many compliments on Thanksgiving day.

This is by far the beset stuffing I have made.  I used corbread crumbs for the bulk of the recipe and just added a portion of herbed crumbs.  I also used 99% fat free ground turkey and added sausage seasonings a day before I browned it.  The stuffing was spicy yet sweet and very healthy!  My family loved it and I have already given the recipe to two friends!

Instant classic here at my house. I hate liver and left that out. This stuffing is good eaten ice cold out of the fridge at midnight, too. Not that I'd do that.

The two adults in our family LOVED this stuffing.  The kids however, did not.  Our kids tend to be very picky though.  This was great and we are even passing it on to grandma!  Great recipe...thanks!

This is a fantastic stuffing. I was unable to find dried cranberries at the grocers in my small town so I substituted a can of whole cranberries for the dried ones, and it was GREAT!!! My family raved about it and now they want no other stuffing on the table. thanks Stacy

Perfect.  Similar to my own pork sausage stuffing recipe but with the fruit and additional  seasonings.   Agree with other posters to use fresh herbs.   Will make again.

I have made this as a Thanksgiving side for a while now. My family loves it! I just make a few changes due to ease and what I have on hand. I use an unseasoned stuffing mix instead of making my own, omit the liver and use sage pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage (it makes a huge and delicious difference). This stuffing is the favorite thing on the table during the holidays.

I have been making this for years now, so it's become a Thanksgiving staple. I use the Jimmy Dean sage sausage. Delicious - always a hit. I don't cook stuffing in the turkey, so I've baked this in a pan (45 mins) and cooked it in a slow cooker (approx. 4-6 hrs). Both ways are good but might require a little extra turkey stock on hand.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. I wondered about whether or not I should make the stuffing the night before. I ended up doing just that. However, I saw a review of someone who said to make the stuffing the night before but to save some butter and a LOT of turkey stock the for the next day. I did that, and it turned out fabulous! (Note: I did not stuff our turkey with our stuffing). I was worried though that it would turn out dry, due to all the bread, but about two hours before serving, I added the stock and butter and stirred it occasionally,(in the oven) covered with foil and (like I said ) it was great! We barely had any leftovers!! A must have for Thanksgiving!

Kudos Stacy Polcyn, this recipe is EXTRAORDINARY!  I have been making this for the past few years and it’s the only stuffing recipe I use.  Further, I have not modified or altered one item in this recipe, which is RARE for me.  This recipe is simply perfect!! Thank you for sharing!!

Amazing!  My uncle always makes the stuffing for Thanksgiving, but he fell ill and was not up to cooking.  I took over cooking and make this recipe in the crockpot.  I just followed the recipe and followed instructions for slow cooker stuffing (from this site).  It turned out great!  FRESH HERBS! My uncle made something similar but I don't think he made it with fresh herbs.  I found a poultry package at Walmart during the holidays which worked out perfectly.  I did not put liver in it or stuff the bird with it since I kinda think that creeps me out a little. I also used craisens instead of fresh cranberries.  Remember to check on it if you use the slow cooker since it can dry out. Just add some broth and get it to the consistency you like.  Its not really a big deal as long as you peek on it every couple of hours or so.

Made this several times and it is always a hit! I almost always bake mine out side the turkey so I used about 4 cups or more of chicken stock. Sage sausage is the best with fresh herbs. I use just the packages of dried bred for the stuffing- usually the herb flavored ones. And I like to add extra cranberries and apples. I bake it at 350 until it looks done- usually about an hour or so.

My family has never made dressing/stuffing with sausage. I wanted to try something different. I did make it the night before. I used fresh herbs and sour dough bread. I soaked the cranberries in the chicken stock overnight. I added the stock and baked the next day. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I think I started a new dressing/stuffing tradition.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  My fiance asks for it all the time, so to switch things up I put boneless pork chops (seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and sage) in the baking dish, then topped with the stuffing and let cook for about 45 minutes.  The stuffing was nice and moist and the porkchops almost fell apart with a fork!  SO GOOD!

I have to agree with other commentators this might be my favorite recipe on the site! As others suggested, I use fresh herbs, a granny smith apple, no liver, and pork sage sausage. I usually bake at either 325 or 350 (depending on what the bird is baking at) for around 40 minutes or so in a greased baking dish covered in foil. I might try increasing the cooking time if you want a crispier stuffing.

This stuffing was absolutely delicious!!!!!!! I sauteed most of my celery and onions together because I cut them up together, but it was fine.  I also split the celery/onion mixture about 75/25 with 75% sauteed and 25% raw which kept the texture from being to crunchy or too oniony. I made a loaf of wheat bread bread crumbs by toasting on both sides and leaving out overnight.  I cut them in larger cubes, then I toasted the softer store bought (Martin's Potatobread Soft Cubes) and toasted them too. The combination of the two sizes where very appealing to the eye and tastebuds.

We made this stuffing for Christmas. Very delicious! Yes, as the reviewers recommended, do use fresh herbs, double the broth, try two types of your favorite sausages. We choose one w/o the
casing,omitted the liver and added the herb Savory for a different taste.

The only thing I might do differently is to add slightly more stock to the stuffing if it isn't being roasted inside of the turkey.

This very good, but i will try again with a few changes. Couldn't find turkey sausage so i just used reg pork sausage.  I saw the other reviews liked the sage sausage but was afraid to try it here because i don't like.  Will definitely use fresh herbs next time as well.  I didn't use turkey liver and it was fine without it.  I think i will also try a juicy apple next time too braeburn or gala.

Absolutely amazing. I've made this recipe every holiday since 2009 and it's great every time. You can substitute bread, apples, fresh for dried herbs, but it's still good even if you follow the recipe to the letter. My adaptation is fresh herbs for dried, sourdough bread or sourdough with Texas toast and I use ground chicken or turkey for meat with a little salt pepper and oregano. I lastly will use double the butter. I've been asked for this recipe numerous times after work pot lucks and have even had someone steal the leftovers once. My husband hated stuffing before meeting me and this stuffing. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was the first time I didn't use Stovetop.  My kids love stovetop stuffing.  I was worried it wouldn't be liked.  Wow! was I wrong.  Everyone loved it.  The kids want me to make it next time we have stuffing.  Definitely a winner.

I was a bit nervous to try making stuffing but was tired of the mushy stuff you make from a box.  I was SO hapy I tried this!  I will NEVER buy boxed stuffing again.  I used a Turkey Sausage and put in a few extra cranberries because I love those but otherwise followed this to a T.  Delish!!

This was very good. Next time I need to add more moisture, but that was my fault that is was somewhat dry. My husband ate it all up.

Made this Thanksgiving 2011 and it was the most flavorful we have had since I was a kid. Used a stuffing bag in the cavity of the turkey and cooked the turkey a little longer. Really outstanding! Thanks Stacy!

I used cherries instead of cranberries...very tasty!  Used bag (about 9 cu) bread cubes and 3 cans chicken broth, extra rosemary and sage.

My family RAVED about this stuffing.  We deep-fried our turkey, so I baked the stuffing by itself, covered with foil.  Also, I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock....no one knew the difference....

I am someone who has never liked stuffing because I do not like bread, and usually just make it for other people to enjoy.  This was by far the best stuffing I have ever had. Very moist and flavorful, savory with a hint of sweetness.  I was impressed. I am usually a bit more of a hippie and like to use all fresh ingredients, but this time I used bagged, prediced bread cubes- so next time for sure I will be making this true to recipe.  So delicious regardless!

This will be my standard recipe from now on. I was told this was the best stuffing guests had ever had. It was delicious - my best yet. I made it as written with three changes. Added pecans. Used fresh cranberries soaked in a bowl of boiling water for 10 minutes, and for convenience I used one bag of Pepperidge Farm herbed bread crumbs and one bag of cornbread bread crumbs. (No turkey liver either). Both stuffing in the bird and baked (with extra broth) were just outstanding.

Wow!  This was all around an excellent stuffing.  I used sourdough bread and Jimmy Dean sage breakfast sausage, a Granny Smith apple, and no liver.  Baked in it's own cassarole for 1 hour (after adding closer to 2 cups stock).  Excellent!

I left out the turkey liver, and used a can of chicken broth instead of the turkey stock.  You may need to adjust the liquid portion of the recipe - I needed the whole can of chicken broth, plus a little water to get the dressing moist enough.  I couldn't find ground turkey sausage, so I bought a 14 oz. package of breakfast turkey sausage patties, cooked them in a skillet, and then chopped them up (while sauteing celery & onions in the unsalted butter in a separate skillet).  If you want to make this a little easier - substitute one bag of seasoned stuffing mix (and leave out the dried herbs called for in the recipe) for the cubed bread.  Great recipe - everyone always loves it when I make it!

This was a delicious and easy stuffing recipe.  I used fresh herbs like other reviewers recommended and doubled the amounts from the dried.  I thought it was a little too herby...the other flavors were slightly lost for me.  Next time I will cut the fresh herbs down a little bit.  But, it was very good!  Great combination of flavors.

This was a huge hit and different from traditional sage/bread stuffings. I used sour dough bread. I made mine the day before, following other users and just reserved the liquids for before baking. I did not bake mine in the turkey because we fried ours, but I did 40 minutes covered at 350 and 15 uncovered. For leftovers, I think this is the perfect candidate for something I saw Rachael Ray do with leftovers. If you have a waffle iron, butter both sides and put the stuffing in the iron and cook a stuffing waffle. She topped it with leftover turkey which had been re-soaked in stock and topped that with cranberry sauce, which she combined with maple syrup (2 parts syrup to 1 part cranberry sauce). Looked super delicious.

Very good stuffing recipe. I used it as a dressing, cooking it in a casserole dish, not stuffing the bird. I added a beaten egg, used about 10 cups of dried bread cubes and about 2 cups of chicken broth.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It was my first time hosting and I was feeding 13ppl!  I dared to try this for the first time and it turned out PERFECT!  It's WAY better than stove top.  I used fresh bread that I cut up and left out over night and omitted the liver.  I did cook it inside the turkey all day and wowie...just amazing.  I will make this every year from now on!  Thank you..

Best stuffing ever.  I followed it exactly except I baked it as well.  Also... didn't use the liver because it wasn't in the giblet bag.  Instead....I boiled the neck  and used the meat and broth that it produced.  My husband said that it was the best stuffing he has ever had.  Will neve make another stuffing... ever.  r

This recipe is great, it is so versatile. I used cranberries instead of craisins, and I did have to add more stock because I did not have a turkey to stuff. My husband LOVED it, which surprised me because I thought the flavors are a bit intense compared to Grandma's stuffing :)

I made this recipe this past thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I made my own bread (rosemary wheat and white) and it was simply devine. This is definitely a dry dressing if you're preparing it outside the turkey like me, if that's the case be sure to add extra stock!

the men loved this stuffing. I do think it was tasty compared to the regular old bread/Stove Top dressing. I'll make this any time I made a turkey/ roasted chicken. Needs to be watched so it doesn't dry out in oven. Add more broth if too dry.

Used it on Thanksgiving to stuff the turkey. Tasted great!! Omitted the cranberries for hubby but loved the taste of the apples. I used Rosemary leaves and probably would either use less or chop them up in the food processor because it overpowered the dressing slightly but will still make it every year now.

Absolutely the bomb!!! Everyone loved it. Didn't add the liver.  Prepared the night before and used boxed chicken stock instead of turkey.  Also wish I'd have added pecans.  I did add a bit more bread, cranraisens & stock than called for.  Jimmy Dean Sage was my sausage of choice.  This will be a repeat for many years to come!  Make extra, you will definately want the leftovers!!!!

Just made this for Thanksgiving and was VERY disappointed! I actually ended up running to the grocery store to put together new stuffing.  This is the worst stuffing I have ever ate or made.  I would recommend looking for a different recipe.

This was a big hit! Worth the time as opposed to "stove top stuffing" - which I've never cared for much. I took the suggestion of adding more broth and baking it separate for 30 minutes covered with foil. Perfect!

Awesome as long as you add lots of extra liquid. I added 1-2 cups extra and still thought it could use some more. I will for sure make this a staple in our house.

Im not even quite sure what to say about this recipe, it seemed like it had so much potential,...but it turned out to be a little too sweet for my taste. I used it with my thanksgivin turkey and along with cramberry sauce and yams it all became just a little too sweet. I tasted it the day after on its own and i found it quite tasty, dispite being a bit dry from being in the fridge.  Overall I thought the flavour work well after adding a bay leaf and some sage to make it more savoury since i dont gravitate towards sweet things. may b next time i may add a few capers.

OMG!!!  Unbelievable! Made a test run couple days before thankgiving and it didn't make it to the table everyone ate it from the pot! Tirpled the recipe for Thanksgiving (32 people for dinner) and it wasn't enough - everyone loved it!   My changes: Craisins, Turkey Breakfast sausage, omitted livers, Squaw Bread & Whole Wheat, Chicken Stock (what i had in stock)  I read one review that added bacon, I just may have to try that next time...as you know Bacon makes everything better! ;)

Best stuffing EVER!!!  I did not stuff a bird with it but baked in a casserole dish for 40 minutes at 375 instead.  If you are going to bake it this way, make sure you use double the amount of broth...I also did not use the liver (icky!)

This was truely amazing.  After thanksgiving, you can put some turkey or chicken leftovers in and add some brown gravy to make an excellent casseroll.  I baked the casseroll for about 30 more min at 350 uncovered (to get the stuffing a little crispy.

WOW!  A real winner here.  I stuffed a turkey with this dressing and cooked some separately on the side.  The side dish came out a little bit better - the stuffing that was in the turkey was a little too moist.  It was a 25lb turkey which had a lengthy cooking time so this may be why the dressing inside the bird was a bit too wet.  I'll try it again with a smaller bird.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

It seemed like no one was cooking their stuffing in the bird this year, and I knew the oven wouldn't be large enough to roast turkey & stuffing at the same time in the oven. Sure enough All-Recipes came to the rescue.  Out came my trusty second hand crock pot. I mixed the recipe straight off the website, no changes or additions, it came out moist, and when scooping it into the bowl. I was delighted to find nice crunchy bits around the walls of the crock. What a crowd pleaser.  .

This was wonderful! My whole family loved it. The only problem I had was with the amount of stuffing. Next time I'd double the recipe so we have leftovers. I'd also add another apple, because it really added great flavor to the dish.  I didn't stuff the turkey with it, but cooked it in a casserole dish in the oven.

Very flavourful, smells divine while cooking, got many rave reviews from the family following Thanksgiving dinner. Used italian sausage and made it in a covered Corningware dish instead of inside the bird. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes before putting the bird in the oven, then put it in the fridge while the bird cooked, and popped it back into the oven for 20 minutes after the bird came out and was resting/being carved. Stuffing stayed nice and moist as long as it was covered.

My favorite stuffing so far.  I accidentally bought HOT turkey sausage, but it was still delicious.  This will definitely become a Thanksgiving tradition.  BTW, I cooked most of it separately in the oven - one hour was great.  I cooked some of it in a pumpkin and it needed at least 1 1/2 hours (depends on size of pumpkin).

If I could give this recipe ten stars I would. I have made this stuffing several times and it has always been a hit. I made this recipe yesterday for a family potluck. We always turn these events into a judging contest...I took first place with this one! Out of approx. 40 people there was only one person who didn't love it...my sister, and she is just weird anyway, lol.

EVERYONE always asks me for this recipe!  I've been making it for a few years now... I always use granny smith apples, fresh cranberries, sourdough and potato bread, chardonnay, and FRESH herbs!  This truly is the best stuffing!  Thank you!!

Absolutely delicious!  I dug some frozen bagels out of the back of the freezer and used those for the bread.  I made this as a side dish to go with chicken breasts (not inside a turkey) so I doubled the amount of broth, and baked it in a greased dish covered with tinfoil.  I took it out and stirred it after 30 minutes, added some more broth, and recovered it to bake for 15 more minutes.  Then I lowered the temp to 315, took off the foil and let it cook for 15 minutes more.  Perfect!

This stuffing is fantastic!  Depending on my mood I sometimes leave the dried cranberry's out of the mix because they tend to make the stuffing too sweet, but the sausage and the apples together... AMAZING!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my husband and daughter loved it. They usually only like traditional bread stuffing. We ate the rest of the stuffing for lunch another day. It's a meal in itself...LOVED IT!!

Excellent!  My family loves this stuffing.  I use the spicy Italian sausage to give it a little kick.  I also use the craisins as recommended by other reviewers.  Has become a regular on our holidays.

I've never liked stuffing until I found this recipe. I've been making it for the past seven years and it turns out beautifully each time.  Two additions: water chestnuts and walnuts.  It adds a little extra crunch to the texture.  One other thing to note about this recipe, it looks beautiful. The combination of the fresh parsley, red cranberries, dark and light color breads is very appealing.

Oh my goodness,my family loved this and it was gobbled up in no time!  I took advice of others and used sourdough and potato bread, sage sausage instead of liver, and used Chicken broth because I couldn't find turkey anywhere and I don't stuff the turkey.  Regardless it came out wonderful and everyone said it was the best stuffing they had ever had!  Thanks for sharing!

Sorry, I thought this recipe lacked something, I was disappointed after reading all of the other reviews.  It did not "stick" together like traditional stuffing and out of 15 people that ate it only one person liked it.  If you are thinking about this recipe make a traditional stuffing to go along with for people that are not going to like this.

I have made this recipe three years in a row for Thanksgiving. It is the Best! I do make one change. I add extra chicken broth to make it a bit moister. This year I will have to make more so that there are left overs. Delish!

THIS WAS A WONDERFUL DISH!! I put the stuffing in muffin tins and made stuffing balls, I like the crisp out side and the individual serving's. You can add other things to this recipe as well. Next time I will use a smaller amount when using frsh spices, the sage got stronger than I preffer, but everyone loved this recipe. I too, like others used sage sausage.

I made this in a casserole dish because I didn't make a whole turkey to accompany it, just turkey tenderloins, and I've always been skittish about the bacteria hazards of putting the stuffing inside the bird anyway. The flavor was very good;I wouldn't change a thing as far as spices go.  However, it didn't hold together the way my other stuffing recipes have in the past.  When I dished it out onto the plate, every single little piece separated, which made it difficult to actually get a complete forkful. Maybe more broth would be the answer if cooking it outside of the turkey?  I'm not sure I'm going to bother to find out...There's a Slow Cooker Stuffing recipe on this website that I've been using for several years that's just as tasty, less work and foolproof.

We love this so much that my sister even imports ingredients that are not readily available in the small markets near her home in the Caribean to insure that she can make this for her holidays. Yes its that good! Different, tasty and delicious! Try it. You can add dried cherries or craisins to the recipee to substitute the dried cranberries.

My Mom loved this (she loves liver), but me - not so much.  I also didn't care for the sausage.  I guess I prefer more vegetarian fare for stuffing.

I gave this stuffing 5 stars because it was very good and I can only imagine that stuffed into the bird, it would be awesome!!! I did it in a covered dish.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock and just kept it covered at 350 for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15.  I did add a couple of extra cups of bread.  I used all butter bread because I was afraid of the wheat bread.  Next time I will definitely add an egg.  That was my only complaint since it was crumbly.  I didn't knock a star off because in the bird this wouldn't be a problem.  For Christmas I will double the recipe, add extra bread, and use 1 pound of turkey sausage and 1/4-1/2 pound of regular.  It really is a lot of meat and you could do without some.  Even a 1/4 pound of sage sausage would add huge flavor.

This is excellent.  I took several shortcuts and it still tasted great.  Here are my changes:  I used Pepperidge Farm cubed stuffing as the base.  I also needed to add extra stock (I used chicken broth).  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage and did not add the liver.  This was very easy to prepare and it looked and tasted fantastic.

Very very good recipe, I made a half recipe trial run last night to see if I wanted to use it for this Thanksgiving. I definitely will.

I used Louis Rich Turkey Sausage because it doesn't have a pork casing and I don't eat pork. I left out the liver because I didn't find any, and I used the Peppridge Farm cornbread stuffing in a bag...used the same amount as the dried bread, and I used chicken stock...but had to use about double the amount to get it nice and moist how I wanted. 

Next time I'll cut back just a little on the sausage because it was a bit too meaty..which some ppl love..and I'll grind it up some before I add the rest of the ingredients because there were large chunks of sausage. Other than that...fantastic recipe!

Awesome recipe, but you knew that.  I used Venison sausage which is very lean, and I've also substituted various dried fruits for the dried cranberries.  Craisins are just a brand of dried cranberry by the way.  You can also dice dried apricots or peaches, use golden raisins, dice some prunes or dried plums, or even some dehydrated mango. 

It all tasted delicious.  We use this stuffing recipe as a side dish throughout the year because it's so delicious to my children, 10 years old and under, as well as the inlaws, the husband, and Me!

There you go, you can also use game sausage, besides the pork and turkey sausage options.

I actually registered here just so I could review this.  I made this stuffing for a company party, and it was a huge hit.  Gone in a flash, and everyone wanted the recipe for it.  Totally delicious.  I kept the recipe basically the same except I omitted the liver, used low sodium chicken broth and threw in a handful of chopped pecans. Thank you for a truly awesome recipe!

It's the only stuffing recipe I use anymore.  Everyone loves it.  I simplify by using premade stuffing bread cubes and cutting out the liver.  Add more stock and cover/bake in oven for 1 hr at 325.

I made this as a test for my annual Thanksgiving feast at the cabin.  The family I made it for raved about it.  Then the entire group loved it for Thanksgiving and I was asked to make it again for Christmas. I know my family will demand this one every year from now on!  I DID substitute pork sausage for turkey sausage, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as shown.

This stuffing is amazing!!! I used bold sasuage instead and didn't used turkey liver. I used chicken broth to add a little moisture. The only thing I will do different is make it the night before. It was much tastier the second day.
I didn't stuff a turkey I cooked the stuffing at 350 for 30 mintues covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

Fabulous Stuffing! I made it for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas. My husband said I could make it once a month. The fresh herbs is the key and I omitted the liver. I did use bagged southern style stuffing as well. It was just a hit!! Keeper for sure!!

Great flavor combination - my non-stuffing loving family ate it all. There were no Thanksgiving leftovers! I used sage flavored pork sausage - and cut back on the amount of sage seasoning. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and doubled the amount of chicken broth. I would have liked it to hold together a bit, and will experiment next time.

I am not a meat stuffing person, but even I loved this recipe!  My kids, though, refused to eat it, but the adults ate every bite.  I added a bit more broth and cooked for an hour alongside my bird and it was perfect.

This was a big hit for Thanksgiving. I took some of the advice of other reviewers and used more stock, about 1 1/2 cups and it came out very moist. I used Chicken stock because I wasn't able to find turkey stock. Used french bread and sourdough to change it up a bit.
Omitted the liver. Very tasty and will use this recipe again next year.

This was pretty good-I left out the chicken liver.  I also baked in the oven for about an hour at 350.  I felt the stuffing was a little too dry and next time I wouldve added more chicken broth (I used about 2/3 of a 14.5 oz can)I think if I would have done this it probably would have been a 5.  Good flavor.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was DELICIOUS! I'm not even a stuffing person. I usually don't like it very much. But I loved this and so did my guests. I will probably make it every year. The only thing I did different was I used pork sausage (I couldnt find turkey sausage.) but I'm sure the turkey is just as good. I also used the bagged bread cubes for stuffing at the grocery store. The cranberries added a nice flavor. All the spices were great! This also couldn't be easier to make with the bagged bread cubes. I'm sure home baked bread crumbs would be delicious also.  Thankyou Stacy!

Made this stuffing for my mother in law's feast and got rave reviews from my husband, mother and father in laws!  And...none of them like sausage very much, so that's saying a lot!  Based on other reviews, I added:  1)  Jimmy Dean Sage sausage in lieu of turkey sausage, 2) fresh herbs, 3) about 1 cup extra toasted bread cubes, 4) used sourdough, rye, and wheat bread and 5) used a cup extra chicken broth as I was cooking it in a 9 x 13 dish.  I cooked it at 325 for 1 hour, and DELISH!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, but I made it vegetarian and without the sausage, it needs a little more salt to balance the sweetness.  And maybe a tad more moisture next time.  But its great - thanks!

i love this! but i alter it a LOT. first of all, i don't use sausage. i just throw in some roasted turkey bits (mostly breast, but some dark meat too). i also use less melted butter and a lot more broth to incorporate it all. i haven't tried this with dried cranberries; all i had on hand were fresh, so i chopped them up and added them. i loved the tang they added. i also just made this in separate baking pans as a dressing rather than a turkey-filler. it has all sorts of lovely tastes mixing together--the sweetness of the apple, the tartness of the berries, the savory herbs... and i love that it uses both whole wheat and white breads. i used store-bought dinner rolls, and it turned out great. it's different from your typical "celery and bread stuffing", but it was a welcome change. love it!

I made this as part of the first Thanksgiving dinner I have ever cooked by myself.  It was so easy to cook it was moist without being too moist, and my boyfriend (whom I was trying to impress) made the greatest "yummy noises" with every bite.  I am saving this recipe and using it every year

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner this year and it went over very well. I thought it was funny how many reviewers said they left out the turkey liver (as if you could really taste it or feel the texture amidst all the other ingredients.) I did use the liver and pretty much all the ingredients with a few substiutions and it came out terrific! I used maple sausage (YUM) and instead of making my own bread crumbs, I used half a bag of sage and herb cubed stuffing mix and half a bag of cornbread stuffing mix. Saved time and added flavor. I also added about 1C of sauteed mushrooms and some fresh garlic. Thanks for a great recipe. I loved the sweetness of the apple and cranberries!

2nd Thanksgiving on this recipe too. The only dressing I would ever do. If you are accustomed to a pudding consistincy dressing, this isn't it. More fluffy than the traditional. A few short cuts... found a bag of pre cut celery and onions very finely diced. Also, used sage sausage to add flavor. Found cubed potato bread (not the bread crumb mix but real cubes) and used that with the wheat bread.  I personally think the presentation (cooked alone with turkey juices and NO LIVER... eeekkk) is lovely in a dish with the different colors. Then the taste is even better. It's even awesome cold the next day. The search is over!

I've made this on several occasions, and it's been a hit every time.  It smells so yummy while it's cooking, too.  Some variations that have worked for me include omitting the liver and using chicken stock, instead of turkey stock.  Also, I always cook this in a casserole dish.  It's so good!

This recipe reminds me of one my aunt used to make but refused to share.The first time I made it - it was very good but I remembered hers having some cornbread "croutons" in it.I cut the 1 1/2 cups of the wheat bread from the recipe, cooked white meal corn bread, sliced just the inside part into 1/2 inch cubes and toasted it with the bread. I added and extra 1/2 cup of white bread and a bit more chic broth, deleted the rosemary and added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning. Turned out great! My mom came to eat the second time and she swears that it is just like my aunts recipe! I kept the liver but pulverized it in the food processer so it came out like crumbs.

Fantastic stuffing. 

I chopped up the cranberries a little. Used Pepperidge herbed breadcubes. Used just a teaspoon of dried rosemary and half a teaspoon of dried thyme.

My sausage was pretty much cooked with the onions already. Cooked it outside the turkey, in a grey aluminium disposable tray. Covered with aluminium foil. Used 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock (homemade), and instead of butter, used 2 or 3 tablespoons of the turkey buttery oil scooped off the drippings (would have thrown away otherwise). Fluffed light with a fork by just lightly tossing to mix. about 40mins at 350F (for me about 180deg C), then checked it for moistness, added just a bit more stock, fluffed lightly then lowered temp just to keep warm till ready to serve.

Received compliments, my aunt wants to bring some home.

OMG! If there is heaven on earth, this stuffing is it! I have to make 3 trays, one for the holiday, one to divide among guest to take home (they insist), and one for our family for the rest of the week - there is never any leftover! If you are unsure about the recipe's complexity, it is actually EASIER than it sounds, and SO worth it. Hats off to you Stacy, this is a perennial winner!

I make this every year and it is fabulous!  It is pretty flexible. I sometimes leave out the liver, or sausage (though in that case you'll need to add salt), sub a more tart apple like Granny Smith, sub dried cherries for cranberries, add pecans, use cornbread or wild rice for part of the bread, etc.  The only sub I always make is to use fresh herbs (parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme just like the song) because I like the punch of them.  If you do that, use a Tablespoon of fresh for every teaspoon dried herb called for.  We double it so we'll have enough to eat later in the week and we always finish it.

This is my third year I'm going to make this.  I love it and so does everyone else.  I stuff loosley in the turkey and the remaining I pile high into a muffin pan (thank you Rachael Ray).  Doing this makes nice individual servings.  Can't wait to make it this year :)

This was phenomenal.  I used chicken liver and stock instead of turkey and it turned out great.  I cooked this in a corningware casserole dish covered for 1 hour at 350 degrees with added stock to keep it moist.  My husband didn't like it, but everyone elese loved it.  A definite make again.

My husband loved this so much. I used Maple Pork Sausage and it gave the whole stuffing a nice sweet flavor. It was really good stuffing. I made it outside the bird and baked it covered for about 30 minutes with the last 10 minutes uncovered to brown the top a bit.Next time I'll add more liquid to make it a bit moister.

This stuffing is awesome and was enjoyed by everyone at our thanksgiving dinner, even the fussy eaters.  The only changes we made were to add pecans, use chicken broth instead of turkey broth, and omit the parsley.  It was so flavorful and the texture and appearance were wonderful.  Thanks Stacy for sharing your delicious recipe. This will become the standard in our household.

This is incrdedible.  I had to quadrapule the recipe to make enough for everyone.  Eveyone loved it.  I used hot turkey sausauge and it was great.  Also didn't use the liver.  My mother in law requested that I make the holiday meal this year.

One of the best Stuffings I've ever eaten! I'm not allowed to come home for holidays without making this and people fight over the left overs. My favorite is to use granny smith apples but then I like the crisper texture in the recipe. Also I don't use the turkey livers, sorry just can't handle any of those parts. I've also used pork sausage if I can't find turkey (Not always easy to find depending on where you live) and it turned out great.  Update - I've been making this for 6-7yrs now and like many people, I don't stuff the turkey anymore, I just put it in a pan, covered, and put it in the oven, probably around 350 for 30-45 min. I take the cover off for maybe the last 10 min. It also depends on how much I'm making. When I go home and make if for family I double (if not triple) the recipe so that obviously takes longer.  I still have to make it every year. I don't really use the recipe any more - so my ingredient proportions have varied, especially since I don't really measure ingredients for this one any more. I have the main ingredients memorized. I do think that it can be a bit more meat than necessary, I often don't double the amount of sausage or the cranberries when I double everything else. I usually add garlic, but I add garlic to just about everything. 
 I've made it with and without celery, good either way.  And have made it with a slightly different herb mix (fresh & dried) , but it's always good. This mixture of flavors is wonderful, and it's easy to adjust a l

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It was a big hit especially with those that don't usually enjoy stuffing.  For a tastebud kick I used a spicy turkey sausage.  Left out the chicken liver and it still turned out wonderfully.

I used a half bag of store bought seasoned stuffing instead of homemade cornbread. It eliminated my adding seasoning and making cornbread!

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving with some variations. I used apple cider for half of the liquid and omitted the apples. I also combined some dry cornbread cubes with the regular with added flavor and texture. It was delicious. This year I may omit the sausage to save on fat.

This is very delicious.  I followed the list of ingredients exactly. I put the casserole dish with a lid in my 220 degree warming oven for 20 minutes and then took the lid off for 15 more minutes.  It was moist and very flavorful. I did not add additional broth or an egg. It was a hit with my husband and 8 &9 year olds, and my children usually don't want seconds of stuffing.  Saved this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it outside the bird. I would use less sausage and a little more broth. I used sourdough bread to make the crumbs which were just "ok" because of the flavor and they were a little gummy. I think I will try ciabatta bread next time and let it get stale before using. I will also chop the apples bigger than 1/3 inch because they are barely noticeable if smaller. Overall it turned out pretty good, but still not as good as my Mom's!

I am not a big fan of stuffing, but ever since I came across this recipe, my opinion has changed.  The sausage, seasonings, and fruit add such a great blend of flavors that even the most skeptical person wouldn't be able to resist this stuffing recipe.

Results:
-Great depth and balance of flavor
-crowd pleaser

Alterations:
-cornbread instead of white bread
-spicy italian turkey sausage instead of regular turkey sausage
-I mixed in an egg and then baked it in the oven for 15 minutes at 350F for a golden crust and the consistency that my family prefers (we like stuffing that's not too dry or too loose).

I always cook Thanksgiving dinner for my family, and stuffing is such a big part of the special dinner. I settled on this one after the rave reviews and we were not disappointed! My siblings agreed that this was the best stuffing we've ever had.

This is the most amazing stuffing dish I've ever eaten.  It takes time to prepare this dish, but it pays off massively in flavor, texture and quality.  My husband, friends and family rave about it, too.  I typically make it with more wheat bread than the white, and it's still amazingly flavorful with a nuttier texture that way.  I have dreams about it leading up to Thanksgiving each year for the past three that I've made this dish -- this will be year 4, and I'm still excited! :)

Best stuffing I've ever had and the only stuffing ill ever make. The blend of sweet and savory favors is delicious. I followed others recommendations: sage flavored sausage (Johnsonville makes a good one), day old sourdough and rosemary breadcrumbs (found mine in the super market bakery. The recipe calls for homemade breadcrumbs, but the first two times I tried that the breadcrumbs came out as strips, not cubes. It's hard to cube bread) and extra chicken broth. I didn't use the liver or the turkey stock. This dish is beautiful when done and  the sage and rosemary fill your home with a wonderful aroma.

I love this recipe because it is so tasty as is, or with variations!  I use whatever breads are in the discounted section in our store, or ask the bakery for bread that is close to it's exp. date(makes it faster to dry out).  Also I have sub. pork sausage for turkey, and bacon instead of liver.  The bacon with the apples is delicious!  I make this several times a year, simply because I crave this recipe all the time!  It is the only stuffing I have ever liked!

We have been using this recipe for close to ten years now and never get tired of it and boast about it to everyone. The only variation I use is instead of turkey sausage I just use ground turkey which I find is more readily available and easier.

This is the first stuffing I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect.  Served next to my Grandma's traditional and delicious stuffing, this stuffing actually was gone faster!

I baked it in the oven as other reviewers did and used fresh herbs.  Delicious!!  I think I'll use dried apricots instead of the apple next time.  I love the texture of the dried cranberries and I think dried apricots would really compliment the dish.  Thanks for this recipe!!

The recipe came out very well. I added an extra cup of turkey stock. The moisture is great. I used left over fresh cranberries which worked fine. I have a Honeycrisp apple on hand. I for got to add the egg as suggested by some. I used dried herbs. The reason it got 4 stars is I thought the overall ratio of "stuff" to bread was too great. Oh I used hot sausage, and that is great in it.

This was fine - one guest loved it (he got the leftovers), the others just liked it, so I don't expect to make it again.  While the fruit complimented the sausage nicely, I thought there was too much sausage, and the dry herbs were a little heavy - kind of tough and herby.  Maybe if I'd used fresh?  (I try to follow the recipe as closely as possible the first time.)  The thing that bothered me most was the texture - too dry, it didn't hold together at all!  I was baking in a dish, not the bird, so I doubled the stock, but it still came out more like a sausage, fruit and crouton salad - the only way to all those wonderful ingredients in a single bite would have been to use a spoon.  If I felt it were worth trying to perfect, it would need more bread and a LOT more broth, but I won't trouble myself with fixing it when there are so many other wonderful looking stuffing recipes out there to try.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was very tasty.  It was not the moist, compact dressing we usually had.  It was a dry recipe even though I added a lot of broth as I was preparing it.  The taste of cranberries, oranges and sausage was very good.  I highly recommend it.

WOW, WOW, WOW!!!
This is the absolute best stuffing I have ever had. So flavorful and moist. I made a few changes but it still keeps the integrity of the original recipe. First, I left out the liver and I used sage flavored pork sausage and only a 1/2 lb. We are not big sausage fans here but still wanted to have some of the flavor. Second, I used fresh herbs and added marjoram. Fresh herbs do make a big difference. If you use fresh herbs, double the amount to = dried herbs. Third, I used 1 loaf Publix bakery Sour Dough 7 Grain bread, 1 potato roll, and 3 slices white bread. I used crust and all. I figured the grains would add a nice flavor. Fourth, I added an egg to help hold it all together. I did STUFF my turkey with this stuffing. My parents stuffed their birds and so have I. I have NEVER been sick from it. Your Stuffing must be 160*. Besides the egg, everything is already cooked and the bacteria in the turkey dies off as the bird cooks to the correct temp. I will absolutely make this again and again and again. Thanks :)

This really is AWESOME stuffing!!!  I love it, and so does my whole family...the turkey gets neglected during the late night raids to the fridge for leftovers to eat this!  I have tweaked it a little, it is great like it is, but I really think my tweaks are an improvement!  #1. I bake my own bread, then cube it and toast it  a couple days before, so it can stand out to get hard. I use 1 2lb loaf of whole wheat, and 1 1 lb loaf of white wheat. I use 2 granny smith apples, fresh herbs, and A LOT more stock (Also, It is fabulous with real sage pork sausage) I will never make any other recipe for stuffing!  (my family would kill me if I did)

Very good! I cooked it outside the bird and doubled the broth (chicken broth) and used sage pork sausage instead.  Because I switched the sausage I lessened the amount of sage I used to 1 tbsp.

I was a little disappointed by this after all the hype it's gotten. I followed it pretty closely, with a few alterations that were recommended by other reviewers (minor tweaks like sage sausage and Granny Smith apples instead of regular sausage and Golden Delicious, respectively), but found that I still prefer stuffing with bacon rather then sausage.

I've never added apples to my stuffing before, however, so I am happy to have walked away from this with the discovery of what kind of great flavor apples can add to your stuffing.

This is a wonderful recipe but I prefer my family's.

this was a good recipe.   wanted to try something different this year than the classic stuffing.  i have to say i missed the classic, but this was definitely good.  i made it with all cornbread, so it had a sweet flavor to it.  i will make this again, but maybe not for thanksgiving, maybe with a pork roast

This is the fourth Thanksgiving that i made this stuffing and it was a HIT again! i made a few changes and I just made perfection. I used spicy italian sausage and ground beef. When i browned the meat i used fresh herbs (instead of dry) and sauted green peppers, garlic, and tomato along with the onions. I used cornbread cubes insted of wheat and a Rome apples. I stuffed the bird as well as baked the excess. There were no leftovers! It was GREAT!

Having turkey sausage in your turkey is redundant. Pork is not "unhealthy".

This is a great recipe for stuffing, but my family actually prefers our long-standing recipe with corn bread.  We use everything in this recipe and also add finely diced mushrooms, walnuts and/or pecans, white wine and every other herb I can pull out of our winter garden such as lovage, lemon balm, winter savory, even a hint of mint.

I have made this for the past 4 years now and it is awesome!  I also use a turkey sausage and a few times used store bought bread cubes (when in a rush) but otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.  Everyone raves over this and I never have any leftovers!  Time to double to recipe!

I followed the recipe mostly exactly except that I used Sage Sausage.  It was good but not the one that I was looking for.  I will make this again but not for Thanksgiving.

As Thanksgiving is approaching, I am starting to receive requests to share my stuffing recipe -- of course, I direct everyone to this page.  I have made it several years in a row, and everyone raves about it.  Each year we celebrate, the recipe Author gets many thanks from my hungry guests and myself :-)

I made this for some guests and they were all blown away by this recipe. Obviously a little expensive given the ground turkey but worth the expense once a year .

I have never made stuffing from scratch. This was the best! My guests loved it. I have to be honest, I still made Stove Top as a back up but no one touched it. This recipe is definitly a keeper!
I did change a few things like others said. I used 1C of chicken stock, used fresh herbs, omitted turkey liver, used pork sausage instead of turkey sausage and used a granny smith apple. 
I deep fry my turkeys so I used a 9x13 dish for the stuffing. Reheated at 350 for 30 min covered and then another 10 minutes uncovered.

This stuffing is amazing. I made it following the recipe, but kept it out of the bird and used 1/2 cup of stock. My family could not believe how yummy it was. It made a huge batch (enough for 2 adults, 2 teenage boys, and days of leftovers - after 3 days there are none left!). Thanks so much for such a classic timeless recipe!

This was amazing. It was so easy to make. I took the sausage out of the casings and cut them up before I cooked them. I cooked it in the oven for about 45 min mixing it up once 20 min. in. I also added chopped walnuts.

I didn't care for this, and neither did my family. The fruit is overpowering and the sausage makes it greasy.  I prefer a traditional stuffing.

This stuffing was awesome and a big hit this passed Thanksgiving. I will definitely make this again.  And it was soooo easy. Anyone can make this one. I'm going to try adding a little choriso  to it next time for a like twist and kick.

By far, the best stuffing I have ever had. I do not cook often so I followed the suggestions from others who have made this (use fresh herbs and up the amount of broth since I wasn't cooking it in a turkey). Everyone was raving about it and my husband could not stop eating it...probably because of the pork sausage.

Instead of a turkey liver, I use the meat of a cooked turkey wing.  I do not consume the liver of anything!  Also I add 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I include the drippings of my roasted turkey instead of butter since I always make this during Thanksgiving. I also chop up fresh rosemary with the parsley and add a healthy sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is outstanding!

I liked it better when I used sage pork sausage and added an egg and melted butter to the broth.  I did not cook it in the bird, instead did it in a 9x13 pan at 350.

Fantastic stuffing! Got rave reviews from all my Thanksgiving guests, including a, "your stuffing is my favorite ever!" and a "I love your stuffing! And I don't even like stuffing!" Also got multiple requests for the recipe. Doubled the recipe and added extra liquid, herbs, and cranberries. After initial measuring, just started adding to taste. Bought the pre-cut dried bread cubes unseasoned. Also used the Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage in the rolls. The smell while cooking was amazing.

great, just like everyone said!  i used fresh herbs, craisins, and added chopped pecans and 2 eggs;  i omitted the celery (don't like it) and turkey liver (cooked a ham instead).  i think the apple added in enough crunch to make up for the lack of celery (i used a honeycrisp).  i put it in the crockpot on low for about 2.5 - 3 hours and it was done!  i will definitely make this again in the future.

I followed this pretty much the same. I did not use the liver. I used diced fresh cranberries instead of the dried ones. I think it would have been better with the dried ones. This was really tasty!

Texture was mushy. Used fresh herbs and the taste was way to strong.  Will never make again. To greasy even after draining the sausage.

For my Christmas dinner I am going to use this stuffing in a roast crown of pork, using pork sausage (hot or sage flavored).  I used corn bread and sour dough french bread for my Thanksgiving version and everyone loved it.  Pour your gravy on top...yum!!

This was great.  I do think the selection of bread is very important and the simple task of toasting it yourself makes a huge difference in the final dish.  I prepared outside the bird and did use quite a bit more turkey stock than the recipe called for to keep in moist.

There is only one word for me to describe this stuffing: EXCELLENT!  I used Pepperide Farm herb stuffing as the base instead of cubing my own bread and it was phenomenal. The stuffing looked so beautiful in the serving dish because of all the warm, rich colors. Even better than the way it looked, was the way it tasted! It was awesome! I will definitely be making this stuffing again next year. Thank you for a great recipe!

This stuffing was certainly different and eye catching with the cranberries and apples, I just wish the savory flavors were more prevalent.

I loved this recipe!  I used bacon instead of sausage, and saved the drippings in place of butter.  I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat bread and added green onions and water chestnuts.  I used more chicken broth, per others' recommendations.  It was perfect!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I didn't add the cranberry and the apples and used potato bread and white bread, and used all fresh herbs. It was amazing:)

This is my first time leaving a review, and I just had to because I had nothing but good compliments on this stuffing! We've never made stuffing before, nor have we ever made our own Thanksgiving meal. this year was our first time, and I am SO glad I chose this recipe. As of today there is no more stuffing leftover, and in fact I wish I still had some to eat...  We kind of eyeballed the spices and adjusted other ingredients to our liking but the suggestions that turned out well were: Jimmy Dean turkey sausage, it's really yummy in the stuffing. More broth to make it more moist, especially if it's not going to be baked inside the turkey. We didn't use the liver since we were too lazy, but it still tasted great. We also used boxed stuffing as the bread since we were too busy cooking other things to make the bread, but it still tasted delicious!

This is the bomb diggity of all stuffing!  I will never go back to regular sage dressing.  It looks beautiful when mixed and after cooking as well.  I bought store made dried bread from the deli and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I have made 100's of recipes from this site, and never left a review.  I was very skeptical as was my daughter when making this.  I made some minor changes to make things simple used seasoned cornbread stuffing and use a little less seasoning, added chicken broth and more of it and baked it due to the fact my son in law BBQ  the turkey.  This was absolutely the best stuffing I have ever had, everyone loved it, Just had to write a review, thanks for sharing this great recipe it will be in our family for years to come.

With all the rave reviews, how could anyone go wrong!. I did like many others and substituted. No whole wheat/used corn bread. Jones pork sausage. Fresh sage and thyme. Left out the liver. Used chicken stock. Sprinkled w/kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I'm giving it 5 stars just from sampling it while I made it. I'd give it a 10 if I could! It's in the turkey roasting now! Made a double batch for those leftovers

Made the for the first time and it turned out great! I used the Jimmy Dean's sage sausage. I like the traditional cornbread method. I added 2 eggs, sugar, and lots of stock. Will definitely use again.** Was so good on Thanksgiving I made it again for Christmas.  Yum!

I'm planning on making this without the sausage or cranberries because my family didn't like the cranberries in the stuffing last year. I feel like the sausage would be too much meat along with the turkey.

O...M...G... this is the best!! It is now my "official holiday stuffing" and carry-in dish for winter-time events. Give it a try, you will be thrilled at the outcome! I made a few changes after reading some of the reviews, and also to suit my family's taste. I used sourdough and cornbread instead of wheat and white. I also used way less onion and celery (maybe 3/4 of a cup TOGETHER). I substituted sweet Italian sausage for the turkey sausage, used "Craisens" instaed of cranberries, omitted the liver, and added more both becuase it seemed a bit dry. Soooo goood!

This was yummy... it is most def. not a mushy stuffing... you could totally omit the turkey livers - i couldnt taste them at all.   Would make again.  With the leftovers i put it in a casarole dish and pushed little pockets into it and cracked a few eggs in the pockets and backed it for breakfast! YUMMY!

Oh, WOW!  I followed reviewers' suggestions and used sage pork sausage.  I baked stuffing in a pan and periodically checked for drying out.  I drizzled with turkey gravy as needed.  Also I used fresh herbs.  Awesome!!! I used craisins and did not have the liver, but it was incredible just the same.  This stuffing is the  new standard at our house.

This is the best stuffing of all time. I make it every year, and people expect me to make it.  They love it. It is delicious and never disappoints.  I never include the gizzards, and it tastes just as delicious. I cook it in a pyrex dish outside the bird.  You can't go wrong making this.

This is truly the most amazingly delicious stuffing I have ever had in my life... no joke! I followed the recipe exactly when I made it for Thanksgiving, but the day after I made this again, this time substituting the ground turkey for a pound of sliced sausage turkey and that tasted really good too. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I figured over a thousand reviews with positive ratings couldn't be wrong and I was right!  First time branching out beyond the traditional dressing and we LOVED it!  I doubled the recipe which filled a 9x13 foil pan along with another casserole dish.  Used sourdough instead of white bread, chicken broth, regular JD sausage (plain) and a whole tube for the double batch was PLENTY so if making the regular size I'd suggest just half a tube, skipped the liver and only did 1 c onion and 3/4 c celery b/c I'm not a big fan of either (personal tastes you may want more).  Baked at 350 covered for 30, stirred, and baked for another 15 uncovered (depends on how dry your bread is).  I like my dressing with the bread crumbs intact and not mushy so the broth amount was great for me.  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

My first time ever making stuffing. It was so good and so easy. I used Arnold's herbed stuffing bread. Jimmy Dean pork sausage meat. Omited the sage (didn't have any). Used fresh rosemary and thyme. Used 1/2 golden delicious and 1/2 macintosh apple. Doubled the stock since I baked it out of the bird (used chicken). It was so tasty, only my hubby grumbled about the cranberries. Next time I'd use half the cranberries and apples, in deference to his tastes. But it was PERFECT as it was. Thank you Stacy for this great recipe.

I make this stuffing every year.  My family actually starts talking about how excited they are for the stuffing a month before thanksgiving.  I skip the liver and use pork sausage, I also used canned low sodium chicken broth and it still tastes fantastic.

This was the first time I've ever made a stuffing like this.  My husband grumbled the whole time because "He doesn't like stuffing with fruit...blah,blah"  Not only did he go back for seconds but we had it for leftovers the next day too!

The entire family really loved this!  I made two changes 1) I used cornbread and white bread and 2) I used maple sausages instead of the ground turkey sausages.  Thank you!!  I will be making this again!

This is my favorite stuffing recipe (after my mom's of course!).  I love the sweet and savory balance and the sausage makes it awesome.  Thanks for a winner!

It was okay. The toasted bread was soggy and mushy in my mouth. I think I should have tried the cornbread instead of toasting the bread. The overall flavors were good...just not the mushiness.

Like what the recipe said, this is an AWESOME turkey stuffing!! It combines sourness, juiciness and sweetness. The only downside for me is it may be a bit costly, especially being in a tropical country, good quality sausages and cranberries are very expensive here.But, worth it.

The only alteration I did was replacing turkey sausages with herbed pork sausages as another reviewer said it was more flavourful.And replacing turkey stock with chicken as I have no turkey stock available.
I added some cranberry sauce to go with the apple and cranberries as well.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I have definitely found a new tradition. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and it turned out wonderfully. I just picked up a bag of cornbread stuffing mix. Because we like our stuffing super moist and I was cooking it in a pan rather than in a turkey, I added extra egg and broth. I made this as a sample run before hosting my first Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I had picked up both Craisins and dried cranberries and we preferred the tartness of the dried cranberries to compliment the overall sweetness of the stuffing.

I used sweet italian sausage for this recipe, and 2 boxes of cornbread stovetop stuffing mix.  I also used a whole can of chicken broth, which I am glad for or it would have been REALLY dry! Next time I will definitely try this by making my our bread and crumbs, etc.  However it turned out fantastic the way it was!  I would also add more apple to this, or maybe applesauce?  Either way- this is a keeper and I won't ever be making the plain old boxed stuffing again!  Thanks!

OMG!!! Talking about the best dressing I've ever had!! I made it as dressing instead of stuffing and I did make a few changes because of what I had available and the preferences of my family, but I'm sure the original would have been just as good too. :)

My husband does not like fruit in his dressing and my mom can't eat fruit, so I was preparing for two separate dishes of dressing (with the fruit added at the end to the second dish before it went into the oven). The changes that I made were:

--1 and a 1/2 loaves of homemade cornbread instead of bread (I'm a southerner, got to have cornbread dressing. ;) )
--1 lb of chicken breast, cut in bite sized pieces, instead of turkey sausage (that is all I had)
--2 cups of chopped onion instead of 1 cup
--Fresh herbs instead of dried
--Chicken Stock instead of Turkey Stock (didn't have time to make the turkey stock like I had wanted)
--I did not add Turkey Liver to it because my whole family HATES livers.
--Instead of using a fresh apple, I had found this package of a mixture of dried cranberries and dried apples seasoned with cinnamon and decided to give it a shot (it worked GREAT).

There were a lot of little changes I know, but the flavors are similar, so I know the original would have been just as good. I can't wait to make this again for Christmas. Thank you SO much for my new dressing recipe.

We followed the basic recipe but omitted the gizzards, and used Jimmy Dean sage breakfast sausage, fresh herbs, Orowheat potato bread and 1 whole can of chicken broth.  We baked it in a 9x13 glass pan.  This was the best, fluffiest and moistest stuffing we've made in quite some time. It got rave reviews and we kept all the leftovers for ourselves!

I'm rating this even though I omitted the apple and cranberries. I've made this a few times now and love it every time. The measurements of the ingredients were a very good start, although I don't measure anymore after making the dish the first time. This recipe is very good as I made it, and is a great start for tweaking, as I do now as I make it more.

This was very good and my family really liked it.  However, I think that next time I'll use my core stuffing recipe and add the some of the indgredients from this recipe.  I'm not willing to give my family recipe for this one.

Gluten-free heaven is easy!!  Just use this recipe (the best ever!!!) but use gluten-free rice bread instead.  I'm a celiac and haven't eaten stuffing in like twenty years. I decided to try a gluten-free (tested it a week or so ago) stuffing, because my brother said "no stuffing?? you HAVE to make stuffing." I cut the cranberries to 1/2 cup (too sweet with craisins) and added more liquid. I cook all natural and mostly organic and this is the best stuffing i've EVER had!!!

This dish is fabulous and a great change from the traditional holiday stuffing.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone LOVED it!!  It's not too sweet and it is really easy.  I have requests to make it again for Christmas.  Very tasty!!

We love this recipe. My husband has me make it every other week. I just throw 6-8 chicken brests ontop of the stuffing in a pan and back it of 30-45 min. Fast and easy dinner.

This stuffing is AWESOME!  I've made it two years in a row now, and it's always a hit.  Made it to recipe except left out the melted butter and the liver.  This last time I didn't make a whole turkey, so I filled a couple of raw acorn squash halves and put the remaining in a baking dish, and baked both covered in foil.  Squash took a long time to cook so I would recommend precooking them maybe 20 minutes before filling, but VERY good!

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times and each time I've gotten many positive comments.  Usually people say this is by far the best stuffing they have ever had.  The only two things I do differently is omit the liver and use turkey bacon instead of sausage because I can't find it here.  I've always made this to stuff a turkey and the juices of the turkey added to this stuffing is what I think is the cherry on the sundae.

Awesome recipe...used it (slightly altered) this thanksgiving, my experience cooking a turkey dinner.  Loved the idea of sausage in the stuffing.  Used fresh herbs as suggested by other reviewers and used all whole-wheat bread.  Skipped the butter (i was kind of combining ideas from this recipe with ideas from another one in a cooking magazine).  Next time, i would go a little heavier on the apple, but overall, it was delicious and i got rave reviews!

The first time I made this recipe it flopped.  I'm still not sure what I did wrong, it tasted OK but the texture was WAY off.  I'm sure it was me and I tried it again and it turned out fine.  Don't stray too far from the recipe like I did and you will enjoy this stuffing  The family still prefers our old recipe, so I will keep looking for the ultimate stuffing.

I made this last year as my first attempt at homemade stuffing.  This is the absolutely best stuffing I have ever had.  I did modify it a bit - I omitted the liver (personal preference), and I discovered an awesome cheat that works just as well and saves a ton of time.  I bought a bread loaf that is already seasoned for use in stuffing.  I slice it, toast slices in the toaster, then cut them into cubes while the next slices are toasting.  Much less hassle than trying to toast them on a sheet in an already much monopolized oven. As well, I could omit the herbs and spices that were already baked into the bread. This recipe was so good that I made it twice more on consecutive days afterwards in a casserole dish (just added more chicken broth than it called for) and it turned out awesome as well.  Now I'm getting ready to make it again this weekend! Happy Thanksgiving! 


UPDATE: I've made this several times since the first review, and I now only make it in a casserole dish, much like other reviewers. Getting ready to make it again this weekend!  Happy Canadian Thanksgiving!

I've made this recipe 4 years in a row at the holidays, and it keeps getting better as I tweak it to our preferences. This year was the best. I omitted the chicken liver, and added dried/diced apricots- also, the major change this year was that I added about 5 cups of chicken stock for a far more moist stuffing and used Pepperidge Farms breadcrumbs instead of making my own and it was perfect.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was so glad I did. Confession: I used to use a boxed stuffing. This was a huge improvement! I made just a couple of changes: Like most reviewers, I skipped the turkey liver (didn't want to deal with it, and it just didn't sound appetizing); I used about 2-3 t. each of the herbs, and I used fresh herbs; I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock - one can. I did not bake the stuffing in the bird but separate in a 13x9 pan. It was very tasty and got rave reviews. I will definitely make again next year!

I couldn't believe how flavorful this stuffing turned out to be! Of course, being a "little of this, alot of that" kind of cook, I used raisins instead of cranberries and didn't measure the seasonings but it didn't matter. Everyone gobbled this up and I didn't have any leftovers! I'll definitely make again and make more next time.

Excellent - Did not bake it in the turkey.  Prepared the night before and left out the liquids & butter.  Just before putting in the oven, topped with 3 cups of broth and the melted butter.  It came out moist and very tasty.  Used pork sage sausage instead of turkey sausage  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Thanks for an "awesome" dressing.

Excellent stuffing recipe! After reading other reviewers' comments about the stuffing being too dry, I added more chicken stock (didn't have any turkey stock, since the bird was still cooking) and put it in the slow cooker in the morning. I started it out on high for about an hour then turned it down to low and let it cook for about 4-5 hours (I followed the instructions for Slow Cooker Stuffing on this site), being sure to stir it at least once an hour so it wouldn't burn. Sure enough, it turned out extremely moist and flavorful, and my guests gave it rave reviews.

This stuffing is great for Thanksgiving.  It's time consuming so I wouldn't make it unless it's a special occasion.  I didn't stuff the bird this year so I added 1/2 cup more stock and an egg and I baked it in a 13X9X2 dish covered until it reached internal temp. of 165.

AMAZING!  Used extra stock (approx 1 1/2 cups total)  Made my own stock using 2 turkey thighs and some extra sage, rosemary, salt, pepper, thyme and dried onions).  Used sage flavored pork sausage, one golden delicious and one granny smith apple.  Used bagged potatoe bread soft stuffing that I toasted and extra dried cranberries.  Got rave reviews!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now and it is my favorite.  I love the savory/ sweet combination. I do use regular sausage because in my small town, turkey sausage is hard to come by and I omit the turkey liver. Otherwise, excellent!

This stuffing was great!!  I changed a few things. I used half a roll of Bob Evans sage sausage instead of the turkey liver, and used dried cherries instead of cranberries, just because thats what I had. I also added a bit more chicken broth, as it seemed a little dry, but the flavor was spectacular. Everyone loved it.

I used this recipe last year and everybody just loved it. I was looking for it today in all my recipes and couldn't find it. I was so upset because I couldn't remember where online I found it last year. YEAH, I found it. Can't wait to make it again this year. I will also be making it for my family reunion the weekend after Thanksgiving. It was very easy to make. I am so happy I found it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have made this stuffing for the last 7 years I have hosed Thanksgiving and it is the best!  Aside from the turkey livers which I have never used, I don't really change a thing.  Can use regulard sausage as well.

This is amazing!  All of the different flavors go together perfectly.  I used fresh herbs (as I always try to).  I cooked this outside of the bird and after reading other reviews about making sure to add enough/extra broth when cooking outside of the bird so it doesn't dry out, I accidentally added a little too much extra liquid, then overcompensated by overcooking.  Even with my mistakes, this was a very, very delicious dish.

I love this stuffing recipe.  It's become a Thanksgiving tradition.  I've also used it in chicken and it was great.  Took it to a potluck in a crockpot and it cooked up well that way, too.

Great stuffing. It has become our family recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I did use a suggestion from another review since I was unable to find turkey sausage and I used the pork sage sausage. It was terrific.

This recipe is amazing. I omitted the liver but other than that it was great. It also is good on turkey sandwiches it adds the perfect amount of cranberry taste. It has become a must for Thanksgiving dinner.

Made for christmas dinner. This stuffing has a beautiful look and great aroma but our family did not care for the fruit in the stuffing. The cranberry and apple made it too sweet for us.

I tried this recipe for thanksgiving and am making it again for christmas.  The sausage made the stuffing very moist.  The only thing I changed was the type of bread I used.  I cut up potato bread and toasted it according to the directions.  I sweetness of the bread just added to the flavor.  I did not add the liver and added chopped pecans recommended by previous reviews as well.

I have used this stuffing for the past three Thanksgivings and it is by far my favorite.  I do omit the liver and use pork sausage.  The cranberries are a wonderful contrast with the sausage.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

As the dressing for my very first Thanksgiving Dinner, this was SO DELICIOUS!! I got nothing but RAVES from my family, who doubted I could ever come CLOSE to comparing to Grandma!! They were absolutely LOVED IT, and I'm GRATEFUL!! I did add about 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms, which added moisture. I also don't stuff the turkey; I baked it, instead, in a dish until the top was crispy. Wonderful!!

I now make this every Thanksgiving. I like to use sage-flavored sausage and I often use Bell's seasoning in stead of the three fresh herbs. I did have some fresh rosemary, so I put that in too. It came out great. I agree with other reviewers that if you make it as dressing, you need to add extra stock.

We didn't like this recipe because of the strong sage taste.  I cut back 1/2 tsp. of the sage, but it was still too strong.  It looked pretty in the dish, but no one liked it.

Wonderful recipe.  This will be a Thanksgiving staple at my table for years to come.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly.  You can prepare a substantial portion of this recipe in advance (toast the bread crumbs; chop and store the veggies), making it virtually hassle-free.

Super yummy.  I will use fresh rosemary next time - the dried ended up reminding me of picking fish bones out of my food.

I used twice the amount of broth (used veggie) and did this in the crockpot - one hour on high, three hours low.  Loved it!  Used apple chicken sausage.

One word:  "YUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMYYYY!!!"  

This is going to be "my" stuffing recipe for every Thanksgiving from now on! That's how good it was! 

I followed the directions with the exception of using fresh herbs instead of dried and using Jimmy Deans Sage Sausage Roll.

WOW, this stuffing was AMAZING! I've never made stuffing before but this is what i will make from now on. I made a double batch for the first thanksgiving i ever hosted and everyone loved it. There was hardly any left.

I used white and wheat hoggie rolls for the bread and cut them into roughly 1/3 inch cubes. I toasted them the night before and let them sit out so they were very dry. I baked it for an hour at 350 degrees and stirred it after 30.

Thank you so much for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I omitted the liver. I also used chicken stock and increased it to 1 1/2 cups and used two baking dishes.  I cooked them covered at 350 for 45 minutes and then uncovered for about 15 minutes.  This was our favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner.

I have to say that I was quite nervous about using this recipe because of the addition of the fruit, but it was so   very good and everyone commented on it. I did add one more cup of bread, a half a cup more of broth and used fresh herbs as recommended (I even forgot to add the parsley and it was still wonderful).

This was a disappointment.  After all the rave reviews on this site, I thought for sure I would hear the same from my T-giving company.  Instead, it was just ok. Notes:  I cooked it separate from turkey for 1 hour at 350 degrees.  Per others comments, I added an extra 3/4 cup of turkey broth, which, by the way  can be found on this site under "Awesome Turkey Giblet Stock".  I also stirred stuffing periodically to distribute moisture evenly.

This stuffing was awesome!  I have a vegetarian friend, so I substituted the meat with Morning Star Farms breakfast sausage patties.  I used vegetable stock and golden raisins (I ran out of the dried cranberries).  The stuffing was a hit!  I also used wheat bread for the whole thing - I do think that althought it was the healthiest thing on the menu, it didn't lack in taste!

I was taught to make a recipe very similar to this that I've been making for a couple of years now, I recently made this version and it was awesome. I will definitely be using this version more often.

This is soooo good.  I made it for Thanksgiving. I was skeptical because of the sausage, but everyone loved it. I accidently bought spicy sausage, but it still turned out great. I prepared it the night before, then baked on Thanksgiving. Moist and yummy!

Delicious.  I left out the liver and since I was cooking it outside the bird I used roughly twice the turkey stock.  I also used two apples and cut back the sausage to 3/4 of a pound.  The sausage/seasoning/onion mixture and the bread crumb baking can all be done the day before.  Then on cooking day just assemble and heat up!

Fantastic stuffing. I haven't published many reviews to this site, but this is one that deserves a rave! My husband looked over the recipe after I printed it out and said, "oh yeah, let's try it". I made it for our first Thanksgiving in our new home, and it was a hit!!!

Edit: I first posted the above review in 04. We are approaching Turkey 08 and it's now "our" stuffing!!! LOVE IT

This is so delicious!  I baked it in a casserole dish because I served it with the Herb Roasted Turkey Breast (also a delicious recipe on this site).  Next time I will add more broth because it was a little loose for a casserole dish.  However, it was sooo yummy, thanks for sharing this terrific recipe.

OH MY GAWD!!! This was AWESOME!!! It is now my official 'Thanksgiving Stuffing', and will serve it for years to come. The sausage added some spicyness, and the cranberries added a unique sweetness. I used Bob Evans Sage sausage, Ocean Spray Dried Sweetened Cranberries, and chicken stock. My hubby thought it sounded gross, but then couldn't get enough of it! I did not cook mine in the bird (I slice the bird before bringing it to the table), so moisture would have been a problem. I just added more broth...can't recall how much...maybe an extra small can.

Big hit this year!  My dad & step-mom did not want me to make it -- even suggested buying Stove-Top "just in case".  They LOVED it.  Even my sister who does not like stuffing asked for the recipe.  Only one serving for leftovers and they fought over that :-)

I agree- this stuffing recipe is wonderful!  On the advice of other posters I made several substitutions: granny smith apple, spicy Italian Sausage, and omitted the liver.  I added extra chicken both- 3Cups total, and baked in a 9X13 pan for 1 hour foil covered.

The leftovers were very slim!

this dressing is so good, yesterday was my first thanksgiving where i had to cook everything, so i was a  little nervous. This was the first dressing i have ever made and it was delicious,everyone went for 2nds & 3rds. the only thing i did differently was adding more broth after reading other reviews. it came out very moist, i used  beef sausage ,sub. the white bread for cornbread, and used chicken broth.

Wonderful! Great blend of flavors. I added an extra cup of stock because the stuffing looked dry to me and because I knew most of it would be in a side casserole not in the bird (not much room in a cornish hen) where it would have the benefit of added chicken fats. Turned out amazing! *Everyone* had seconds - at least!

This stuffing lived up to its name.  I could not find turkey sausage so I used pork sausage and it worked well.  I also used store bought bread cubes and they worked fine.

As so many other reviewers have already written, this stuffing is terrific.  We all were picking at prior to it even entering the oven.  My sons were both surprised with the apple in the dish-and they loved the stuffing-always great to find a kid-friendly dish! My hubby, who would just about kill for mashed potatoes passed over 2nds of taters for more stuffing.  That is a compliment!!!!!!!  This is a great dish-the flavors are incredible together.  Yum, thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

My family raved over this stuffing when I made it for Thanksgiving this year.  I used turkey sausage instead, but I think a full pound was too much for my taste.  It was too much of a meal rather than a side dish.  Also, I did not actually stuff the turkey with it, so it did not come out as sticky as I would prefer.  I recommend adding more turkey stock to it if you are not going to actually stuff the turkey with it. All in all, very very tasty!

This was my absolute favorite dish this Thanksgiving!  I didn't make the stuffing in the bird, but cooked alongside it and it turned out wonderful.  I used european bread (both wheat and white) and left the crusts on.  I also used pork sausage instead of turkey sausage, and left out the turkey liver.  Everyone loved this stuffing!  I can't say enough good things about it!  Thanks for providing us with a new Thanksgiving staple!

OMG this was sooooooooo gooooooood.  I didn't think I would like it with the cranberries, but I did, and so did everyone else.  I have to saute' my onions and celery together because it just smells like Thanksgiving.  I also saute'd the apples instead of adding them in raw. I had 3 people at my table that said they weren't "stuffing eaters" but gobbled this one up.  Will definitely make this one every year.  Thanks!

If you prefer the taste of traditional stuffing, you will not like this combination of flavors. I followed the recipe to the letter but used chicken broth instead of turkey. Had guests for Thanksgiving and only one person said it was good, and it wasn't me! I was disappointed at the strange flavor. Luckily, I had also made a packaged stuffing, which everyone ended up eating instead. The rest of the meal was fantastic.

Surprisingly easy to make.  I used pork sausage, but feel that ground turkey/chicken might have been better.  Stuffed the Thanksgiving turkey with it and our dinner guests were very complimentary.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was the second stuffing I had ever made in the turkey and everyone just LOVED it. They are still talking about it. My husband made sure to freeze the leftovers to enjoy it longer!

The greatest stuffing ever!! I love cranberry sauce with my stuffing, but adding the dried cranberries to the stuffing eliminated that need.  Next time, I will add a little more!!!

Thus really is a fantastic recipe - but I use cooking apples instead of golden delicious for more tang.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and was slightly apprehensive when reading some of the negative comments. THEY WERE WRONG!! This was the easiest most delicious stuffing me or my family has ever had.  I encourage everyone to make no substitutions and ignore all negative comments--This is a Keeper for sure---The best

Husband raved about this stuffing - best I ever made said he.  I used a low fat pork sausage (that is what the label said) and dried cranberries which brought back our New England favors.  (Made while in Florida for Thanksgiving)

I'm not a big fan of stuffing, but this was very good. I used pork sausage (couldn't find turkey sausage) and it turned out great. I received a lot of compliments this Thanksgiving when I served it.

I got so many compliments on this stuffing!  I made several subsitutions and it was just terrific.  Instead of sausage I used shredded pheasant breast, I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock and I bought cubed unseasoned bread cubes.  I added sliced mushrooms and left out the chicken liver.

I broke tradition and made a sausage stuffing this year for family.  This was just incredible.  I used 90% cornbread which made it extra delicious.  The family loved it and said it's a must for next year.  Easy to make and just wonderful!  Cranberries are great and festive.

I substituted corn bread for the whole wheat bread and I added some finely chopped pecans. I put the ingredients together the day before Thanksgiving and all I had to do was pop it into the oven on Thanksgiving day. I love this recipe although I'm not sure my in-laws loved it as much. They are more accustomed to Stove Top. This recipe is definitely a "do again".

Such a delicious stuffing!  I had to make more because there was none left for leftovers.  The sweet cranberry and apple taste contrast beautifully with the earthy sage flavor.  Instead of turkey stock, I used turkey pan juices - fantastic.

OMG...I have had and made many stuffings in my life, but this is truly Awesome!  Thought it sounded good, was a bit worried it was kinda busy....too much going on and in....but I was wrong!  Made it for Thanksgiving this year, and had RAVE REVIEWS!  No one had ever had stuffing like this before, and all loved it! Savory/sweet yumminess!  I also threw in a 1/2 bag of fresh cranberries...they turned.out to be little pops of heaven! Thanks for my new Thanksgiving tradition!

Another good recipe although my family like our traditional cornbread stuffing better. They thought this was good as well as different.  I would recommend adding more apples to the stuffing.  I served it with the Dried Cherry & Cranberry Sauce.

As listed I give it 4 stars (I baked outside of turkey). For me to make it 5 stars I will decrease the rosemary a bit and increase the bread, craisens and apples. I will definitely make again.

It was delicious.  My family loved it.  This was my first time making dressing.  I substituted pork sausage and chicken broth.  Cooked in the oven.  I will make this again next year but make it the day before.

I make this as a side dish. Bake in a 9 X 9 pan. If you want enough to fill a 9 X 13 pan, double the above recipe. When I double it, I do NOT double the sausage or butter, since I find it to be quite meaty/moist without doubling them. I also omit the cranberries entirely just for personal preference. The dressing will survive without the liver as well. I like to make it a day ahead & refrigerate it in a covered baking dish.

i just put this beautiful stuffing in the oven.  if it is as delicious as it smells, my family is in for a major treat.  i substituted kosher beef sausage for the pork sausage, and i used ready seasoned packaged stuffing ( not stovetop ), and didn't add more spices, as it was package ready.  i also skipped the butter, and used rendered chicken fat instead, for full flavor.  as suggested, i added more liquid ( water, as the chicken fat and seasoned stuffing have enough spice and flavor, so didn't need stock ).  hoping for an amazing turnout !

I was hesitant about adding fruit to stuffing, but it turned out fabulous!  I subbed pork sausage and chicken broth because I couldn't find either.  The stuffing in the turkey came out moist and delicous.  The out-of-turkey stuffing was a little dry and slightly overdone on top, so next time I'll add extra broth and stir half way through the cooking time.  This is definately going to be a staple for our holiday meals!

Enjoyed very much, except I really didn't follow the recipe other than as a guideline for ingredients. I used roasted garlic (loaf) bread (from Costco) and mini baguettes which I cubed and toasted. Also used spicy Italian sausage, and nixed the liver/giblets. Included apples, cranberries, and some golden raisins because I didn't have enough cranberries. Cooked sausage first, then onions. Added celery to the onions with seasonings (used fresh as many other reviews suggested). After cooking for a while, I added the cranberries, raisins, and sausage back to the onion/celery mix and continued cooking, also added some chicken stock while cooking; added peeled, chopped apples later as I didn't want them to get too soft. When cooked to my liking, I mixed everything in with the bread cubes, adding in more chicken stock...really I just eyeballed it. I made way more than twice what the recipe calls for and I'm not much for measuring so I just went by taste, looks, and consistency. The dried fruit plumped a little with the moisture of the stock; like this a lot. Oh, also, this was made separate from the turkey so was not stuffed in it, but baked on its own. Baked at 350 covered with foil for about 30 min, then removed the foil for another 15-ish minutes. The family loved it and I will be making it again next Thanksgiving. Happy cooking, happy eating!

Instead of stuffing the turkey, I bake this at 350 for about 45 minutes, then check it and see if it's done or needs more time. I would think 1 hour would be the maximum though. I really do love it. I make very few changes, and they are just for personal preference. I omit the sausage, and this recipe works beautifully with or without the addition of the meat.

I have made this recipe for the last 3 years. I leave out the turkey sausage because I am having this with what? Turkey. Last week my wife asked me if I was making that great stuffing again this year!!! You know I am. It is delicious.  Steve Hope.

Way too much sausage. This recipe may have had a chance if there was 1/2 the sausage or even less.

I thought this recipe was very good. I tried it both with turkey sausage and spicy Italian sausage. Both were very tasty. I love the tartness of the cranberries and apple paired with the savory flavors. I used a golden delicious apple but, might prefer a more tart apple next time. Also, I used fresh herbs..mmmm! Love the smell and taste of this..definitely go with fresh if you can. Although, I'm sure it would be just fine with dried. I did not stuff the turkey and just baked in the oven in a casserole dish at 350 degrees for about 35 min or so. Thanks for this delicious recipe. I will be making this again!

My first time making stuffing ... Sooo easy and absolutely delicious ! Omitted the liver, used chicken stock, granny smith apple and mixture of craisins and raisins. Baked at 350 in casserole dish adding about 1/2 cup extra stock.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving for the first time this week and it was a huge success!  I changed the recipe slightly.  I only put in a couple teaspoons of minced parsley because I am not a big fan of parsley.  I also used fresh herbs so I doubled the amount that the recipe called for. I omitted the turkey liver and I used Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage because Safeway was out my favorite italian sausage that I would have used in lieu of turkey sausage.  First let me say that Sage Sausage is fabulous!  It added a ton of flavor to the stuffing.  This recipe is especially good because you can make it ahead of time and you will be the only one that will know. (I made it two days ahead of time). I did as a previous reviewer suggested and didn't add the butter or in my case chicken stock until I was ready to bake the stuffing. It was super moist and very flavorful!  My husband and daughters don't like sweet and savory but the rest of my family does so I split the stuffing into two  casserole dishes just prior to baking.  I left one without any fruit and the second dish I added 1 fuji apple, 1 golden delicious apple with a couple generous handfuls of craisins (sweeten dried cranberries) and I was amazed at how much stuffing was consumed. This recipe is super easy to follow and lends itself to being slightly altered to please everyone! I made it for 24 servings because I have a bigger family and there is hardly any left!  Super easy and super tasty is a winning combo!

This was soooo good. I did not use the turkey liver, used chicken broth, sage infused pork sausage, fresh herbs, granny smith apples, craisins, and chicken broth...despite all those changes..it was sooo delicious. Everyone loved it. Will make over and over.

This was really yummy stuffing.
With this recipe I ahd enough to stuff a 10 ound turkey and to have a good size pan full of it.
I left out the liver, didn`t think it was necessary and would not use it in future either. 
The stuffing from inside the turkey was amazing. Sooooo good. To the extra stuffing in the pan I added quite a bit of turkey stock, probably around 3 cups, so that it wouldn`t come out dry. It was really good.
I couldn`t find turkey sausage and used German "Bratwurst", tasted great.
I got a lot of compliments on the stuffing. Will make it again next Thanksgiving.
Particularly the dried cranberries in it made it different - just a nice combination of sweet and hearty.  5 stars!

Even the picky eaters who claim to never eat stuffing (2 of them at Thanksgiving dinner) gobbled this up and wanted more! Will be making more next year and will need to triple the recipe! Also, I used cherry flavored cranberries instead of regular and YUM!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Instead of using plain bread, I used Stovetop cornbread stuffing and then added the rest of the ingredients, extra stock and put it in the oven in its own dish (instead of stuffing the turkey). I also made my own turkey sausage, following the instructions left by another reviewer since I don't eat pork. The stuffing ended up being delicious!

This is a staple for Thanksgiving in my house now. Followed recommendations and used only fresh herbs, didn't really measure out just eyeballed it. Used a granny smith apple instead and chicken/apple sausage which was awesome. Was very liberal with the turkey stock which we made as well, baked for 30 minutes and it came out moist and delicious and even better the next day!

Fabulous - I cut the recipe in half, so I had to estimate on the proportions, but we still finished it :) I used Herbs de Provence for the dry herbs and turkey breakfast patties for the sausage. Also, I did a mix of French bread and sourdough. I kinda burnt the bread when I toasted it but it didn't even matter :) I probably used a little more turkey stock than called for, but I was eyeballing everything. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is my first stuffing I ever made for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious!! Though I thought it was a bit dry. So next time, I'll be using more stock. Here are the changes I made: used white bread only, used sweet italian sausage+ removed from its casings, omitted sage (didn't have any) and liver, used dry parsley and homemade chicken stock instead of turkey stock. This is definitely a keeper!

That was so great!! Cutting cranberries, apples, liver, and celery very finely made a huge difference. I replaced sage with marjoram (I didn't have any sage). Used stock from the Turkey roasting in the oven.

This was an awesome stuffing recipe! Thank you so much!!  Last year I tried making the slow cooker stuffing recipe from this site and it was a bust - so mushy and heavy.  I prepared this one a day in advance in a casserole dish (I don't stuff my turkey).  I put a little bit of melted butter over the top and then in the fridge.  Thanksgiving day I took it out until it was room temp, added the liquids and heated it with the lid on.  Really delicious - everyone loved it.

So Im 28 years old and cooked my first Thanksgiving dinner all by myself from scratch. I planned this stuffing for 10 people. 2 didnt show up and I STILL ran out. I was forced to make more the day after because everyone still wants more. Great Recipe!

I had many compliments on this recipe.  The only thing that I did differently was to add two eggs to bind the dressing together.  I have always done this with stuffing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely make this apart of my Thanksgiving tradition.

Amazing! I stuff my turkey with herbs, apples, and onions so I had to bake this outside of the turkey for about 40 minutes covered and 15 uncovered at 350 because it seemed like a good idea at the time. In order to make sure the stuffing was extra moist, I added about a cup of Clover Hills Spiced Apple wine (I try to find an excuse to add alcohol to anything) and a little bit extra stock.  The stuffing became the focus of the meal. Alas, with ever blessing there is a slight curse; the stuffing was so good there were no leftovers.  I have some left over bread and sausage so I might make this again so I can have it with my Turkey sandwiches.

The best ever, it was loved by everyone.  I used regular sausage, substituted corn bread for the bread with grain.  This will be pasted down for many generations.

The best thing about this recipe is there is a ton of room for variations to taste. I used artisan bread for the base and Italian flavored pork sausage to add flavor and depth. My boyfriend is in love!

Very good but hubs and me both agreed that it was missing something.  I even used the sage sausage as many others suggested.  People at it at Thanksgiving but no one raved about it.  I made exactly as stated except using the sage sausage.

My friend made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious! It was a little wet and slightly too salty, but the flavor was great. I seem to remember that I made it once before too and used it to stuff a turkey. I would only bake it separately from now on since I read that the turkey cooks better if it has no stuffing inside.

I am not a big stuffing person but I tried this and loved it! I used craisins.and a granny smith apple. I baked it separate from the turkey following the instruction others suggested. It was a hit at my house. The only critique was that they wished it was more congealed and stuck together better. They felt they were chasing the stuffing around the plate. But great flavor. I would make it again but maybe add some cream of something soup to hold it together better

Wonderful! Followed the suggestions about adding extra broth.  Covered/sealed with foil @ 350 for 45 minutes then took foil off for 15 minutes. The only problem was no leftovers.  Would double the recipe with everything next time, maybe the sausage too, so we would have more.  Used wheat rolls and french bread both from bakery and super fresh. Going to make again and again....  I also used JImmy Dean Sage Sausage, didn't have any sage but it was great without it.

Amazing dish!!  Not a morsel leftover and I served this to 11 adults.  I also used fresh herbs and added extra turkey stock and melted butter before baking in a casserole dish.  A definite keeper - many compliments.  Thank you for sharing!!!

Great stuffing! I use pepperidge farm herb stuffing then omit the herbs. And remember that if you bake this separate from the turkey to add WAY more broth or its very dry.

I rated this only 3 stars, probably because I tried to cook it in the oven outside of the bird.  I added ground turkey instead of sausage.  That was OK, but I just didn't have it moist enough.  The hands-down winner was the slow cooker stuffing by a 10-1 margin. Will try this one again but maybe put it inside the bird or in the slow cooker.

Well I'm another skeptic-turned-believer. I never would have made this but the reviews were so great I had to try it. Sensational!!! It's already been demanded of me for Christmas. It was the only dish that had no leftovers. And it was really pretty easy. I followed the recipe to a T except for a few things. I used fresh sage and I think that it wouldn't have been nearly as good if I hadn't. I almost doubled it at others suggestions, 4 tsp. I got fresh turkey stock/broth from the local deli the night before I made it and I think that made it better also. I used 1.5 cups of it since others said to use more if you don't cook it in the turkey. Used the Jimmy Dean Sage sausage as suggested also. Baked at 350 covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered about another 20. Delish!!

I love this recipe. Only thing I changed is I baked in a pan because I dont cook my bird. Used about 2.5 times the amount of liquid and baked for about 40 minutes, covered with foil for the first 30. My husband hot seconds of this before my famous Mac and cheese, so that is saying an awful lot.  Next time I will mix it up with day old loaves of more substantial bread because I love the pieces that keep the cube shape! Wonderful!

Delicious. This will be my holiday stuffing from now on. Beautiful presentation. I used a french loaf but will double the amount of bread cubes next time. I used a granny smith apple. The flavors really worked together.

I used this recipe last year at thanksgiving and it was delicious! I will be making this stuffing again this year, and probably for many years to come. I left out the liver because I don't care for it, and also I used jimmy dean sage sausage instead of the turkey sausage. this stuffing really is awesome!!

Back for a third year to print out the recipe for this awesome stuffing!  You have not eaten stuffing ever before in your life until you try this recipe!  Be sure to use the fresh herbs instead of dried herbs, because that is a big part of what makes the flavor so complex and wonderful.  Everyone who tasted this stuffing at Thanksgiving last year said that it was the best stuffing they had ever tasted, and my sister said that if I didn't bring it for Thanksgiving dinner this time, she would cry (and she's a grown-up!)  You will not regret taking the time to learn this one--it may become a holiday favorite!

Diffrent than your normal stuffing... But very good.
Use big square pieces ofdried bread instead of the small. They will hold up and give better texture.

Awesome is right!!  I use regular sausage and I add a couple of eggs, I think it helps with consistancy.  Other than that, no changes!

Very different from the kind of stuffing I had growing up.  I did use fresh herbs and chopped the giblets up into the stuffing.  Poured the stock from cooking the giblets on top of the stuffing prior to cooking.  Delicious!

Fabulous stuffing!  I modified it a bit, but it was a real winner at Thanksgiving!  Even my brother-in-law, who said he's not a big fan of stuffing, ate every last bite!  I left out the turkey liver though and used pork sausage instead of turkey sausage.  Also left out the butter and just used the turkey stock/chicken broth.  A bit healthier!

Made this for family Thanksgiving.  Loved it!  Would definitely make it again.  I used the sage Jimmy Dean Sausage, soaked Craisins in water and heated in microwave so they would not dry out the stuffing.  Doubled the stock and could have used more.  Used the Golden Delicious and I think I will try Granny Smith apples next time.  Loved it with the fresh herbs as well.  Definitely worth getting the fresh herbs.  I even used the herbs and drippings in the pan from cooking the sausage in my gravy and it added some kick to the gravy that I really liked.

I have been making this for 4 years now.  I use chicken broth instead of turkey stock and use Jimmy Dean's sage sausage when able to find itI never use the turkey gizzards though. My husband LOVES this recipe and requests it every year.

This is my 5th year of making this fantastic stuffing, which is always a huge hit and the first 'leftover' everyone asks to take home.  I do not actually end up using the Turkey liver...and it still tastes excellent.

After looking for a long time for a really good stuffing recipe for my Thanksgiving meal, I found this. This is by far the best we have ever had and I will definitely continue this as a Thanksgiving tradition in my family! Thanks for a perfect recipe!

Delicious recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I made a couple alterations based on not finding a few things like turkey stock so I used chicken stock. I couldn't find turkey sausage so I used and chicken and apple chicken sausage (chopped). Based on a previous reviewer i also added an extra cup and half of  a french baquette. I am thrilled over this recipe since I'm a non-cook and Stove Top has been my best friend for years. Not anymore this will def be added as a new family recipe. Fresh seasons as recommended really brought this flavoring out.

I didn't put my finished product in the bird but baked it a bit in a casserole dish ith foil.  I didn't add a thing to it because I'm not a full blown foodie and was worried I'd mess it up.  (I omitted the liver, though.) It turned out terrific!  Four kids and hubby raved.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved it ofcourse!  I used turkey sausage, but it didn't crumble very easily.  I did make one pan without the sausage which was ok, but it was the one w/sausage that everyone raved about.. I was wondering if using an egg would make it bind alittle.  I did use alot of broth - 4 cups.  The fresh herbs were great.....my 1st time using.

This just wasn't good. I used a bag of stuffing cubes and didn't use the turkey liver. Maybe because we generally are not stuffing eaters it wasn't as good. I won't go through the trouble again.

I made this for my T-day dinner. I had 18 guests with about 15 ranting over the stuffing. I did add more liquid and also added more apples.  I had increased the amount to 40 servings and used a granny smith, golden delcious, and red delicous apple combination. It was gone within 24 hours or making it. I used fresh cranberries (chopped) which really enhanced the flavor. I definatly will make this again.

I made this for the first time this year, and used the sage pork sausage as recommended, and other than that, did not deviate from the recipe at all.    It was all right, nobody of the 20 people we had over was particularly impressed with this stuffing.  NO ONE went back for seconds and we had a ton of leftovers, which we unfortunately did not want.    I think everyone missed the bacon/celery/onion stuffing I usually make.    The recipe seemed rather heavy on the rosemary, and I don't think anyone was fond of having fruit in it.  Good for people who like this flavor profile, but definitely not for our family.  I won't be making it again.

Great flavor and easy to make.  I did not stuff it in the turkey.  I a full 48 oz container of chicken broth and it could have used a little more.  If it isn't going inside a turkey, don't be shy with that broth!  I would probably put more sausage next time too.

This is the best stuffing I have ever had! My husband loved it too. My daughter didn't like the cranberries, but I figure I can make her some with out cranberries. Next time I want to try it with some sourdough bread and also some pecans. Thanks for the recipe

Very good!  I made the mistake of using Italian sausage (it was in the freezer), but it was still delicious.  Definitely use breakfast sausage next time.  Dried spices are fine, but make sure they aren't old!  Clean out those spice cabinets!

Awesome!  Everyone LOVED it at our Thanksgiving meal.  Made it exactly as is except I added a little more stock since I baked it outside of the bird.  (at 350 for 45 mins covered).  Next time I might cut back on the amount of sausage, but nothing else.  Will be making again next year.

WOW, I've never been a stuffing person - till now.  Last night was my first full Thanksgiving dinner where my family and my fiance's met for the first time at our home.  A really big deal so trying this new recipe along with other new dishes was risky.  I used the JD Sage Sausage (and used a bit less sage in case of overload), bagged toasted bread cubes and cornbread stuffing as suggested by others, the liver that came with my turkey, and a carton of chicken stock since I was not stuffing my bird.  Covered for 45 mins at 350 then uncovered for 15.  Was still very watery and had no form so I put it back in multiple times till I reached the desired consistency.    Everyone remarked about how good this tasted.  I only wish I made more.  After leftovers were divided up, I had only a serving left for myself.

The title is correct....this is awesome stuffing.  We added chopped walnuts for kicks, and used all fresh herbs instead of dried.  Cooked it in a baking dish at 350 covered in foil for 40 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes to get the crispy top.  We added extra stock to the mixture since we didn't stuff the bird with it.   Delicious!!

This recipe received great reviews from my guests this Thanksgiving. Personally though I prefer the usual sausage, apple, sage dressing I've been making for years. I just thought the addition of the cranberries would be a nice chnge. It added a sweetness I wasn't expecting. I think come Christmas I will probably go back to the old standby. But thank you so much for posting since it was a nice change

I thought this recipe was VERY GOOD but it didn't knock my socks off.  Maybe I am not a stuffing fan?  I would definitely make again using a spicier or more flavorful sausage as when asked only a few guests could taste the flavor of the sausage.

This was excellent! I have never made stuffing or dressing before so I was a little aprehensive. However, this was so easy and it was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and son do not like cranberries and I love them so I scooped about 1/3 into a seperate baking dish, added the cranberries and baked both in baking dishes rather than stuffing the bird.  I had to add more stock to prevent it from drying out in the oven since it was not in the bird.  Baked for about 45 minutes to 1 hour and it smelled and tasted heavenly!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I used what I already had in the pantry/freezer - seasoned turkey stock & sage pork sausage.  I also reduced the turkey stock by 1/2 & replaced the rest with white wine.  It was fantastic!  Even the picky eaters in my family (the ones that will only eat boxed stuffing) liked it. Thank you so much for the recipe!  Love it :)

After 58 years of the same stuffing and side dishes, I decided to try some different recipies, this was one and it was fabulous!  I had, either sweet Italian or Bratwurst, sausage and used that for the sausage instead of turkey sausage.

I used three boxes of Jiffy cornbread baked in an 11x15 pan for my bread base, which worked great.  I sauteed the onions, celery and sausage separately and then sprinkled the herbs on, and mixed in the craisins and apple.  I baked my dressing for an hour at 350 and stirred it a few times throughout baking.  I'd never done a dressing before, and wanted to do something different.  I think everyone was pleasantly surprised and would eat it again.

Fantastic recipe - unfortunately for me, when we get together for Thanksgiving, I always bring the stuffing!  I also don't stuff the turkey with it but bake it for an hour at 350 degrees.

definitely more than your basic stuffing - I made this for my first thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. You can easily make the recipe in phases, ex. the sausage, celery and spices earlier on in the day, and add to bread later to spread out the rush to the oven. I found the finished product (pre turkey) to be a little dry so i added another 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Success!

I have made this recipe 4 times now for christmas and thanks giving dinners for my family and extended family. Everyone LOVES it. The only thing I do differant is instead of the ground turkey, I cook up some italian sausage because thats what everyone in my family likes. I would have never thought to put apples in the stuffing but It was amazing. This recipe is one of my all time faves!!! Thanks so much for posting!!!

This was AMAZING! I made this exactly as the recipe said and used the advice of some and found some sage sausage @ the store. The sage sausage really makes it good, and I even used dried herbs and left out the liver completely and it was soooo good! The best stuffing I ever had, and the best anyone else had ever had too! Everyone called me the stuffing master when I used this recipe. If you can't find turkey stock dont worry, I used chicken stock and it didn't make any difference.

Too much sausage.  I was expecting my stuffing to be stuffing, and not another meat dish.  It is delicious, and I'll make again...just with less meat.

I made this dish for a our Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it!!!  It was the first time a dish had ever been scraped clean, my husband who doesnt like stuffing LOVES this.  I used fresh herbs, Jimmy Dean sausage, and doubled the stock (chicken stock) and did not stuff the bird, just bake for 30 min.  I dont cover my pan because I dont like a mushy dressing...  LOVE IT!!!

My first stuffing and the first Xmas dinner I made.  It was a hit.  The picky men all said I should send it in to a contest!!!  I couldn't take credit for it!   I found 375g turkey sausage enough (jsut under a pound).  Total of 7 cups of bread (60% wheat) and 1 cup chicken stock.  Only 3TBSP butter needed and no turkey liver.  FANTASTIC.

It's yummy! I made a mistak by putting the same amount of white bread as wheat bread.  It tastd nothing but turkey sausage...  I added more white bread the next day and it tasted a lo better.  I may cut the sausage amount in half the next time...

As mind-boggling as it may sound, I'd never had a sausage stuffing before!  This recipe sounded interesting, so I made it for the first time for a Christmas dinner.  I cooked it as a side dish since we weren't having any sort of poultry.  It was absolutely scrumptious!  All of the flavors are very well balanced.  The only things I tweaked was using pork sausage (it's the only type I had in the fridge), and used a generic poultry seasoning mix in place of the three spices.  Definitely a keeper!

This stuffing is delicious. I've made it the last two years for Thanksgiving and it's is always a hit. I omit the liver and use sage sausage since I can't seem to find turkey sausage locally. I cook outside the turkey and it's YUM!

Everyone raved over this one and it has been requested for next year. I added some cooked mushrooms and replaced the wheat bread with cornbread stuffing mix. I was hesitant about it being too sweet..it wasn't even remotely too sweet. I took the time to write this review because it truly is awesome.

The herb mixture is the best part of this recipe. I had to substitute marjoram for sage and it was fine. I used Jimmy Dean's ground sausage. I didn't like it with the cranberries, so I'll be taking that out next time. Next time, I will also mince the apple into smaller pieces and add 1/2-3/4 of the apple instead.

When I saw this recipe it sounded great and had received nothing but 5 stars -- now I know why!  My entire family loved it!  In fact my sis-in-law joked that she dreamed about it the next night.  I used the Jimmy Dean sage sausage.  MMMM! MMMM!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I have never made homemade stuffing before, but this turned out FANTASTIC.  I changed the process a little bit.  First, I browned the sausage with a little bit of oil, and chopped onion and garlic.  When the sausage was no longer pink, I added the peeled and chopped apple and the cranberries, and covered it all with a mixture of chicken stock and water (my brother had made the same recipe the day before for his own Thanksgiving dinner, and said that it was very very salty, so I didn't want to use all chicken stock.)  I let everything simmer over medium low heat in the fry pan for about 40 minutes, to really meld the flavors together.  This mixture alone tasted fantastic.  I didn't make my own breadcrumbs, instead using a bag of Pepperidge Farms herbed bread crumbs.  I emptied the bag of bread crumbs into a 9x13" cake pan and poured the sausage mixture over it, then tossed to combine and added some more liquid.  I probably used about 3-4 cups of liquid total in the end.  I covered it with foil and let it sit in the fridge overnight, then popped it in the oven (350 degrees) for 1 1/2 hours the next day.  I probably should have only baked it for an hour, because it got a little over-brown on the bottom and formed kind of a chewy crust, so I think it got overdone.  But it still tasted amazing.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was a big hit, minus one problem; the sausage pieces were too large and detracted from the other flavors. Will make again and take time to make minuscule pieces of sausage. Also used fresh rosemary since I have a large bush.

I thought there was way too much meat for the amount of bread.   I'll make it for Thanksgiving again next year but reduce or eliminate the sausage and liver.   The apple and cranberries give a nice fruity sweetness and tartness.  The herbs are very nice and well balanced.

Very good! I didn't add the sausage or the liver because I didn't want it in there. I also used all whole wheat bread and omitted the drizzled butter. I used a crockpot on low and cooked it for 4 hours. Next time I don't think I would do that because while it turned out good, it was too soggy and I like the crispy edges it would get baking in a pan.

This was not just awesome stuffing--it was bitchin’! I will use this recipe every Thanksgiving from now on because it’s pretty much fail-proof.  I did change the recipe a bit however. To start with, I used Mrs. Cubbins herb seasoned stuffing mix for convenience, sage sausage for flavor, grated my apple, used craisins for the dried cranberries (they were all I had), fresh herbs and added walnuts for a crunch that would have been lacking. Also I added a carrot, onion, and celery that I sautéed with the sausage. Then mix the thing together adding only enough chicken stock to moisten and covered with foil and baked about 30 mins then removed the foil and let top get crispy. Oh great time of day it was delicious! Thanks for a new favorite Stacy—I love it.

This stuffing was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner!!!  This is now THE stuffing I will make every year! A number of guests asked for the recipe, and even some diehard stuffing-haters tried and loved this!  I made some of the same changes as other reviewers:  I omitted the turkey liver, I used pre-packaged unseasoned stuffing mix, Jimmy  Dean pork sausage, chicken stock (couldn't find turkey stock anywhere!), and fresh herbs.  I did not stuff my turkey.  I baked the stuffing in a greased casserole dish, approx. 40 min total, covered for the first 30 min, and uncovered for last 10.  I also stirred it halfway through the baking time and drizzled in additional stock to keep it moist, but not mushy.)  Thanks again for a great recipe!

This was my first-ever attempt at homemade stuffing and it turned out perfectly! My only changes were using sage sausage (I'm not crazy about turkey-sausage) and adding more bread and stock - for a moister taste. I cooked it separate from the turkey as well. Only changes I would make for next time would be to double the recipe & add more bread (probably throw in some sourdough too). This was a huge hit at my family's Thanksgiving, & will be my staple for many more to come!!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC. Instead of toasting my own bread, I buy the wheat/white bread crumb mix (no flavor) and use about 5-6 cups, omit the liver, and don't bake it in the turkey. I also used 1.5 lbs. of reduced fat Jimmy Dean pork sausage because we don't have Turkey Sausage in our grocery store. Cook the sausage with the onions and spices like mentioned, then add to the apple/cranberry/bread mixture and stir. Add the turkey stock and mix until moist. Keep warm in the oven at 150 degrees until ready to eat! Voila! Perfect - thank you for this!

I accidentally bought ground turkey instead of turkey sausage, but even with that substitution this was a wonderful dish!  It was very simple to make and extremely tasty.  I baked it in a dish covered with foil at 350 for 30 minutes and then 15 minutes uncovered.  Excellent!

Amazing! I did make many changes though. I just didn't have the time to put the complete time into it. I first used the stove top turkey stuffing, then I used pork sausage (this is what I had in my freezer). I added one small onion to the sausage. After it was done, I added it to the prepared turkey stuffing. Next I chopped up the parsley and apple. I attempted to make my own version of dried cranberries; big mistake. In the end, I didn't add that into it and excluded the turkey liver. Surprisingly it turned out amazing!

Quite a different flavor from the traditional bread stuffing and the amount of bread used really didn't stand out amongst all the sausage, apples and cranberries.  Very nice change.

Absolutely amazing! SO glad I finally took the time to make this! I just bought cheap sandwich bread and left it out for a day and it worked out well. Made it easier to cut once it was a little stale. Left out the liver and added an ENTIRE can of stock. That's right, an entire can. When my grandma makes her dressing it almost looks like soup when it goes in the oven and it comes out very very moist. i don't like it quite that moist. Putting in an entire can (cook it uncovered  and stir a few times while it cooks) made the moist level exactly how I like it. Baked it at 350 for about 45 min. DELISH! I'd also go ahead and throw in the entire bag of dried cranberries. they're yum. Thanks for a great recipe!

I just finished making this in preparation for Thanksgiving.  It is delicious!  It's definitely a keeper for years to come.  I subsituted 1 bag of Pepperidge Farm country style stuffing mix as I had already purchased it.  Didn't have sage so I used Allspice instead and chicken stock I keep in the freezer.  Tip: Whenever I roast chicken or even buy one preroasted from the store I always cook the carkus and freeze the broth in various sized containers for later use.  Makes a world of difference in all your recipes.

I made this the first time two years ago for our Christmas dinner turkey and my husband cannot wait for the holidays so we can have it again. I should make turkey dinner more often throughout the year just to have an excuse to make this recipe. It's phenomenal. The only thing I changed was that I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock.

This was very tasty, the flavors went together well. We used a pork sausage instead, my husband is not a fan of turkey sausage, so that is the only reason why. It was delicious!

Everyone loved this dressing. Excellent. I used hot Italian sausage for an added kick, omitted the liver.  I prepared this the day before stuffing the turkey except for adding the broth.  The broth was poured over everything just before filling the bird.  Worked beautifully!

This is very tasty stuffing, better than traditional stuffing. I do not use the liver though, I use a sage sausage.

Very good recipe - the flavors of sweet and savory seem to marry beautifully in this dish.  Peoples tastes are all different though and most of my family just couldn't adjust to sausaage and apples in their stuffing.  I still use the basics of this recipe but to keep my parents happy I cut the apple, cranberries and sausage amounts in half, added one box of "savory herb" stove top to bring up the bread to meat ratio and double the liquid so I can make this outside the bird in my crockpot.  I loved the recipe "as is" but it's still very tasty modified for family preferences.

Thanks for this great recipe!  I too used the sage sausage. My boyfriend and his family loved this recipe when I made it for Thanksgiving a while back. I'll definitely be making this again.

Finally! After using this recipe for the past 3 years, I finally found ground turkey sausage. With that said, I subbed the dried herbs with 3X fresh herbs. Also, I dried my own cranberries (1 cup fresh cranberries with a sprinkling of sweetener at 200 degrees for 5 hours). In addition, I used 3/4 cup of "Rich Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy" since that is what I had onhand. With these alterations, my husband finally said the stuffing tasted good but he still prefers bread, butter, and onion stuffing.

This really is awesome. I usually use sage seasoned sausage. Sometimes I leave out the sausage altogether, for THE BEST stuffed pork chops.

We make this every year and it is the highlight of the meal.  If the stuffing isn't to my Dad's standard he will complain all year about it.  For the past 3 years no complaints.  Thank goodness.

This is an awesome twist on stuffing.  I fixed this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was scrumptious.  I cooked it without the turkey and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  I also couldn't find turkey sausage so I used sage pork sausage.  The cranberries and apples really make this recipe.  I will make this again and again.  I served it with my cranberry and mushroom chicken dish and it was beautiful and yummy.

Used sage flavored pork sausage instead of turkey sausage, but this is now my new Thanksgiving stuffing. Absolutely awesome and great on sandwiches with turkey the next day because of the sweetness of the apples and cranberries.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone had thirds! Adding the sausage seemed odd to me, however, the apple and cranberry balanced out the spice perfectly. It was splendid. I have since made it for everyday meals as well. Stick to the recipe, it's perfect!

I cannot say enough about this recipe. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. The only thing I do differently is use mild pork sausage instead of turkey sausage, and poultry seasoning for the herbs.  I have made it several times, and don't see myself getting tired of it anytime soon.  It is such a great blend of sweet and savory.  My husband, who does not usually eat stuffing, goes back for seconds and can't wait until I make it again.

Amazingly tasty stuffing.  Made this for my Supper Club and everyone raved on how tasty it was.  All went back for seconds.  Minor adjustments include using only whole wheat bread, fresh herbs, sweet Italian turkey sausage, and additional broth to keep it moist since I did not stuff a turkey. Although other reviewers used prepared bread crumbs, I felt making my own was healthier (no additives, corn syrup, etc) and it didn't take more than 10 min to cut the bread up. I baked it covered for 30 minutes.

Thanks for an super recipe! A great marriage of sweet and savory...the few changes I made were: fresh herbs, I use a stock pot put the neck and giblets. Then I add fresh: rosemary; sage; thyme, and as I'm preparing the onions; celery; garlic, etc. for the stuffing I just throw the stuff others would put in the garbage in my stock pot...(I also add carrots, pretty much everything but the kitchen sink...)when the stuffing is ready to be moistened I pull the broth both from my stock pot and the turkey...if you sample the broth you won't believe how yummy it is...nothing compares to homemade! Keep adding water as it cooks down. After dinner(we dine about 2-3pm, so there's plenty of time, debone the turkey, and add the carcass(keep adding water)...I then simmer all the flavors until the bones are dry...strain everything off except the broth...enjoy it fresh, or freeze it in serving size batches. The next time your sick,( so a small cup of this stuff before going to bed will help knock you out), or you need broth you'll NEVER want to reach for "the off shelf" again!!! 
  Oh, the only thing I omit is the liver, I like it, no one else does...and I mix homemade cornbread with white bread...my mom was southern cook and it my tribute to her...always to bring a touch of her to my table!You don't want to forget the most important ingredient...LOVE!

Tasty Stuffing, made this three times so far and everyone loved it.  Fresh cranberries made it extra special, have made it with dried and fresh and both are good but fresh has much better taste.  Thanks

This was my first ever attempt at stuffing. My bf doesn't like pieces of celery & onions, so I was looking for something I could make that would still have flavor enough to be tasty even though I was leaving those things out.
This recipe was delish!
The rosemary and sage gave it such a yummy flavor. The apple and dried cranberries gave it texture and color and the only changes (other than omitting the veggies) I made were to use fresh herbs (doubled amount) and some extra butter brushed over the top the last 10 minutes of baking. Really good stuff!

Best stuffing I've ever had!  It was a grand experiment, since my family was raised on Stouffer's.  We're never going back.  So much excellent, fresh, amazing flavor in here.  Cooked in a separate dish (outside of the turkey cavity).  I used half sourdough bread cubes and half whole wheat.  I can't wait to make it again next year!!

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck this year and got rave reviews. It is so good! I did substitute Jimmy Deans sage pork sausage...and did not use all fresh herbs. I will be making this for years to come!

We made this for thanksgiving this year and everyone LOVED it! We used turkey sausage though (to cut down calories and fat) and didn't use any turkey livers.

I hate stuffing, but this was so delicious! I used day old wheat bread and sourdough bread from Panera's. I will be making this again next Thanksgiving!  Thank you for sharing your recipe : )

Made this for the third Thanksgiving in a row, and I always get complimented on this stuffing and/or asked for the recipe! I bake in a casserole dish at 350 degrees: 45 minutes covered, and about 15-30 minutes uncovered, until enough of the broth is absorbed/cooked. The only other minor changes to the recipe: 1) omit liver (sorry, but ewww), and b) used chopped turkey link sausage (sun-dried tomato this year, which was a BIG hit). Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

DELICIOUS! I am now in charge of stuffing every year thanks to this delicious recipe! I'm not a big meat-eater, but sausage does have a delicious flavor and makes for a nice contrast with the fruit, herbs and bread.  I left out the liver--it seems unnecessary.  I used the "Rosemary roasted turkey" recipe from this website also and the flavors of the two dishes were perfect together!  A perfect Thanksgiving meal!

This was outstanding! I made a huge pan for my in-laws Thanksgiving get together this year and it was the only stuffing that was all gone at the end of the night. My husband is a bit of a food snob and he even told me how great it was! People have already requested me to make it again next year! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Oh gosh, this just became our family recipe for stuffing. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and there wasn't any left at all.  Good thing I made extra and kept a pan back at home or we'd have had no leftovers!  Everyone there (except my five year old son... go figure) asked for that to become the stuffing we have for Thanksgiving in the future.

I made this per the recipe with the exception that, since we made it in the slow cooker instead of stuffing the turkey, I added more turkey broth.  It was wonderful.

When I was reheating the leftovers I had kept back it was just as good.  I also added some toasted pecans for that portion and it made a good addition to the textures.  

I could barely taste the turkey livers; but when I could it was a very nice addition to the complex flavors of this stuffing.   We will *definitely* make this again.

I have made this many times and it's simply the best. Please do yourself a favor and use fresh herbs. I never understood why people would take such a shortcut by using dried herbs in a dish like this. It's what MAKES this dish so fabulous! You can dry the leftover herbs by hanging them upside down in a ziplock (with holes punched in) so as not to waste them.

Ive made this with and without the liver and didnt notice much of a difference. If Im pressed for time, I use a bagged bread cubes.

My husband also likes more bread than meat in this dish so sometimes I use less meat and more bread.

One of the best recipes ever. And it freezes well!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner, and I thought it was really good. I used italian sausage, decreased the spices a little, and baked it for 350 about 45 minutes, covered with foil...Since it wasn't going inside the turkey, I added more broth for moistness...about 2 C of broth total, and mixed it with my hands until it got the right consistency. Definitely different than my Gramma's stuffing, so my family was kind of skeptical, but I think they enjoyed it...I know I did!

I've made this stuffing for 6 years straight and it's a hit every time.  I don't always stuff the bird, so I took the suggestion of someone here and put the stuffing in a crockpot, set on low for 3 hours and it turns out awesome & moist.  If you prefer it drier, you could remove it from the CP and bake for 20-30min.  One adjustment I do make is to use 2-4 less ounces of meat than called for, I think it balances the flavor and texture out better.

I've never made stuffing from scratch before, and I'm happy that this came out so well and tasted great!! I used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage that other reviewers suggested, and I used 3 tablespoons dried parsley flakes since I couldn't find them fresh. I also used a 14 ounce can of chicken broth, omitted the turkey liver, and baked this in a 9x13 baking dish for 40 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. It was soooo good!! I love it! :)

I've used this recipe for the last few Thanksgivings - its wonderful!  It always gets rave reviews.  Last year I left out the liver because I'm not a liver fan and it still was great.  I'll be making it again this year.

Very Yummy!
I used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage and I could not buy just a Turkey liver so I made my own broth out of turkey legs and then bake the legs along with the stuffing (in separate pans). I also used Pepperidge Farms cubed stuffing.  I will defiantly be making this stuffing again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my third time making this recipe and it always turns out perfect. I am a bit fast and loose with ingredient amounts but it always works out. It made a ton of stuffing - more than a 10 lb bird could hold - but we baked the leftovers separately and they taste fine as well. 

I did double the melted butter and I used regular salted butter because that was what I had. Poured a whole bottle of Henckel Trocken over the turkey about halfway through and it turned out fabulously well.

I have a gluten allergy but came across this recipe a few years ago and had to try it.  I replaced the bread with cooked brown rice (equivalent portions) and made it gluten-free.  It was awesome!  Even my family who all usually love the bread-type stuffing loved it and have been asking me to make it on an annual basis.

This will be the 3rd year i'm making this stuffing.

My sister is not a fan of the cranberry but EVERYONE ELSE who's ever tried it claims it's the best stuffing they've ever tried.  For my Sister I set some aside with no Cranberries and added a little bit of leftover cooked ground beef and it was a hit with her and even a bigger hit with those who already loved the stuffing...

I made this stuffing two years ago and have every holiday since.  Everyone in my family LOVES it.  So much so I have to make double the number of guests so we don't run out.  Make sure you use FRESH herbs or it will take away from the great taste.  I pair this with the World's Best Turkey recipe I found on here.  This is my favorite recipe seconded by the turkey recipe.

Okay.. so this recipe could be the best tasting recipe I have tried on this site. As I made the stuffing I thought it was a lot of work, but it was 100% worth all the effort. I modified the recipe because I couldn't find turkey sausage, so I used pork sausage. I also used a couple different types of bread. It tasted amazing! I will be making this again.

This was a good recipe, although it made a lot more food than I was expecting. I thought it needed more broth to cover the amount of bread the recipe called for as it did turn out a little dry. Good thing my bf has a big appetite.

I usually make sausage cornbread stuffing for Thanksgiving, but this I like even better.  Great combination of savory & sweet.  A definite keeper.

This was great!  I did not use the turkey liver, and I also used chicken broth because I could not find turkey stock.  I like cranberries so I added a bit more of those as well.  I made this in the crockpot on low for about 3 hours and wow!  This recipe will be used for years to come.

Ohmigod. I made this for Thanksgiving and I couldn't stop eating it. Usually the stuffing I have had is too salty and just plain gross. However, this stuff is so good. It's worth the extra 30 minutes on the treadmill.

I made this for thanksgiving and I have to say...This was THE best stuffing ever!!! Now my one and only recipe for it. Double it for sure. I used different kinds of bread(2 types wheat and a rye) This was my first time making stuffing not from a box and it was not hard at all. I had the bread drying 2 days before thanks to other reviews, and had my herbs cut up day before...not hard at all to put together. I already a looking for an excuse to make it again! It made this my best thanksgiving yet.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (without the liver) and my super traditional family (who have always loved plain cornbread stuffing and don't care to have their traditions messed with) LOVED this!  I also made our traditional stuffing recipe to be safe but, I didn't need it.  Everyone adored this recipe and gobbled it up.  I was informed that this is a must for next year!  Thanks so much!

Yum!  I used packaged Pepperidge Farms bread cubes, a Braeburn apple, and one lb. of sage pork sausage.  The presentation was awesome, and the flavor combination was great!  My only problem was knowing how much stock to use.....my first batch was a little dry, but the second one was perfect.  Will definitely make this again!

I've been making this for years and everyone loves it!
I do change it up a bit.. i add lots of bells seasoning and I mix up the types of bread I use - I've used challah, white, wheat, french, etc.  I probably add more bread than what it calls for. For the sausage  I used sage flavored pork sausage (green and white tube)..   Oh and of course I double the recipe and there are always no leftovers :)

I made this in my crock pot!  Outstanding.  I used fresh herbs and lots of turkey stock!  Probably about 3 cups of stock and, increased the bread cubes to 7 cups!  Then, had it in the crock pot on low for  hours and stirred the stuffing every hour to ensure no burning!  Most delicious stuffing I have ever had!

Being only 22, this was my very first year cooking Thanksgiving dinner.  I was nervous but decided to go on a hunt for the best stuffing around.  I've never really been a huge stuffing fan anyway but our guests love it & were counting on me.  I found this recipe the week before Thanksgiving & thought it sounded good.  That, plus the excellent reviews, convinced me to try it.  WOW!!!  Boy am I glad I did!  I have changed my mind about not being a stuffing fan.  This was DELICIOUS!  My entire family raved about it & more of it was eaten than any other side dish.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I left out the celery (since most of us don't like it anyway, used chicken stock vs. turkey stock, bought the seasoned pre-cubed bread crumbs, & used the Jimmy Dean pre-cooked sausage (the kind that you can microwave).  I looked for the uncooked turkey sausage but just couldn't find it! I just threw the pre-cooked sausage in a pan with the onions for some heat & to add flavor then cut it all up.  I am so impressed with this recipe as it was quick, easy, & to die for.  Definitely give it a try!  You will not regret it!

This was very delicious. After reading the reviews before attempting, I doubled the recipe but cut down on the sage pork sausage (half the amount) instead of using turkey sausage -which I couldn't find either. I substituted mixed dried fruit instead of cranberries. IDK I felt it was redundant to use cranberries in the stuffing since I already made Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire from this website. I also made my stuffing outside of the turkey, so I used a 1 full quart of Pacific brand organic, free range, low sodium chicken broth for a doubled recipe. I used what was on the clearance sale shelf at the bakery (breads that would go stale sooner)- sourdough bread and whole wheat dinner rolls. I cut them into cubes and let them dry out overnight before toasting them. The turkey liver was excluded. I saved the giblets to make delicious Giblet Gravy instead. Overall, very elegant, very rich in flavor; not for simple nor underdeveloped palates. My family devoured it! This is a close favorite next to Cornbread stuffing- but I guess that's the Southern girl in me. Will do again for Christmas!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone really liked it.  I baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes in a casserole dish and I used fresh cranberries instead of dried - just processed them in the chopper for a couple seconds to break them up.  Some of my guests were asking for the recipe.

I tried this stuffing this thanksgiving, and it turned out wonderful, by far the best I've ever had. I would cut the recipe back though. I made a 21 lb bird and had 1/4 more than I needed to fill the bird. I cooked the chopped turkey liver with the sausage and onions. I also stuffed the stuffing into a cheese cloth bag which I then tied shut. The flavors still exchange, but it makes removing stuffing so much easier.

My husband lamented the lengthy prep of this dish (I tripled the recipe AND used fresh herbs, involving him in three trips to the garden: "more, honey, more than that, please!) but, in the end, he proclaimed unceasingly that THIS must be our new traditional stuffing. So, since I will be making this another year :P, here are my notes: 1)Stick with Golden Delicious, not Granny Smith-- the recipe needs a sweet, not another tart component,  2)When using fresh herbs, triple the amounts when substituting for dried. Save brain cells by tripling the handy-dandy "servings" button to "30", and the herb amounts will be listed for you. (Just don't forget to change it back for your other ingredients!) 3) I halved the butter, and it was perfect. Perhaps using mostly sage pork sausage made it greasier than turkey sausage would have. 4)LEFTOVERS IDEA!!! This would make an excellent accompaniment to pork. I plan to place chops, swiss cheese and the leftover stuffing into the slow cooker for our guests tomorrow.

I thought that this had too much meat in it.  I prefer the tradional, buy the seasoned croutons and add celery and onions or whatever else you like.  I did like the dried cranberries in it.

I made this stuffing for the first time this evening for our Thanksgiving dinner.  My whole family loved it.  My mom, who insisted on making her own "traditional" stuffing, tried some of this and thought it was great, to her surprise.  I baked this in a separate pan instead of stuffing it in the turkey.  I doubled the amount of stock/broth, used fresh herbs, used one bag of sage flavored stuffing instead of fresh white bread, used sausage with sage, then baked it covered with foil for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I highly recommend this dish!

I have been making this recipe for the past 4 years and it's always a hit! It's amazingly flavorful. I don't use the liver or the celery, instead I use pork sausage. I also add minced bacon (that I pre-cook separately) so it's tastier. Also, like other reviewers suggested, I check it periodically and add stock so it won't be too dry. The first time I cooked this I stuffed half in the bird and cooked the rest on a separate pan. It turns out much much better when you cook it separately! You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

Tried this out on our small group before serving this Thanksgiving to my husband's family..everyone loved it!  Doubled the recipe, used pork sausage (sage) as well as fresh herbs as suggested. Also used whole wheat and sourdough bread I picked up at Panera Bread bakery and cubed the night before..worth the extra effort.

I've been making this for several years now and it always receives rave reviews.  I've substituted chicken broth and the recipe still works just fine.  Sometimes, bulk turkey sausage is hard to find, so I've resorted to using turkey sausage links and removing them from the casings.  I've also used real cranberries and added honey for sweetness, but I prefer the craisins as the real cranberries tend to be a little bitter.  Personally, I prefer Cortland apples in this recipe as those are my favorite to eat.  Although I'm not a big liver eater, I don't mind it in this recipe.

I have subsituted Jimmy Dean sage sausage and Brownberry sage and onion stuffing so I leave out the sage and also the turkey liver. Every Thankgiving I stuff the turkey with the dressing and also have to make 2 additional side pans of the dressing. It has been a staple in our family for over 40yrs.  Thanks Grandma!

with almost a 550 "FIVE" star rating how could i go wrong with this recipe??? 
I usually use stove top, but was up for a change!!! this is soooo good!! i made slight changes.. I used already pre made bread for stuffing, from the grocery, and i used a can of whole cranberries instead of the dried. I also omitted the liver (ack!!!).. and used a granny smith apple.. I didn't use turkey stock, because i figured the sauce in the cranberries would work in place of that, and i was right. It was perfect!!!!!!! very good.

I made this three times, for 2 of our Thanksgivings and (because people asked for it) Christmas! I left out the liver because I heard it distinctly flavors the stuffing - a yucky flavor. The first time I used dried herbs, but added a little more.  The second time I used fresh herbs.  Update: Adding a splash of white wine to the melted butter before pouring it on is delish!

I had never made anything but your basic bread/cornbread stuffing with traditional seasonings and wanted to try something a little more exciting. THIS was IT! As the name indicates, it is truly awesome. Sooooflavorful! This will definitely become a staple tradition for the holidays. Yu-ummy!

Just what the name says Awesome Sausage Apple and Cranberry Stuffing. Guess who gets to make the stuffing next year.....I do and I'm glad! I accidently double the butter and ofcourse it turned out perfect. I could not find ground turkey sausage in 3 diffrent stores so I used ground pork sausage. Great recipe it will not disappoint.

Granted, I used smoked turkey sausage which I'm sure changed the taste, but I was not impressed.  Noone at Thanksgiving went back to it for seconds :(

I make this every year, and it's always a hit.  I usually add nuts to it, about half a cup. I also leave out the liver.  I don't even like sausage by itself, but every year I love this stuffing!!

I used fresh herbs instead of dry. Stirred in 2 C of chicken broth in total and omitted the liver. Added 1/3 C of chopped pecans, and baked it 45 min covered, and 15 min uncovered. My husband said that this is one of the best stuffing he'd ever had. So Good!

I made this recipe the day before Thanksgiving. It was easy and my family loved it. It tasted much better the next day, although it was a bit too sweet for me.

I loved it.  Made it for a crowd of 40 at Thanksgiving.  I used bagged stuffing, no butter.  It was still great.  No time to make bread cubes.

Wow! This is great stuffing.I used the sage pork sausage,and added a LOT more chicken broth (I like my stuffing moist). My husband ate a stuffing sandwich (instead of turkey) Thanksgiving night! I give this 10 stars!!

This was my first attempt at stuffing and boy was it delicious!  It's already been requested for Christmas!  I doubled the recipe for a 22 lb. turked and used an entire loaf of potato bread and about 3/4 loaf of wheat.  I omitted the liver; used fresh herbs where possible; used Jimmy Dean original and sage sausage; used fresh turkey stock and canned chicken stock.  I made it the night before, which I think made it taste that much better.  I added a small can of chicken broth before I stuffed the turkey.  I had enough to bake a large tray as well.  I was actually sad yesterday when I finished the last bit of leftovers!  Thanks for posting this outstanding recipe!

This came out great.  I used a whole loaf of the cheap, white sandwich bread.  Used 1 and 1/2 times the amount of spices, celery and onions. I added more broth until it all looked moist plus a few squirts from the turkey baster and baked it in the oven at 350.  Next time I will also add an egg   to make it hold together better.

I have to agree that this was awesome.  I've already been asked to serve it again next year for Thanksgiving.  The recipe is easy to modify.  Like others, I used chicken instead of turkey broth and I omitted the turkey liver.

Best stuffing I've ever made, hands down. I made it with rice bread as I'm gluten intolerant. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Delicious! Even my kid who claims not to like stuffing had seconds.

I left out the meat and it was awesome in taste although a bit dry (I baked it in a casserole dish).  Next time, I'll add more moisture.

I just made this stuffing past Thanksgiving (Canada) and it turned out pretty good. It was my first time roasting turkey and making stuffing from scratch but it was delicious and my family liked it. I skipped celery cause I didn't have any and turkey liver.  I didn't like the idea at all and my husband didn't even like putting turkey susage neither. I won't put the sasuage next time. I made the broth with turkey's neck I found inside the turkey and put some salt and herbs in there for some flavor. I put the stuffing in the foil and baked for an hour or longer with the turkey. Didn't bother putting inside the turkey.  I will make this again for Christmas!

This is one of the best things I've ever made.  It outshined everything else at my Thanksgiving dinner--everyone kept going back for seconds and thirds of this until it was gone.  I used spicy pork sausage, and I thought the heat from the sausage set off the sweetness of the fruit really well.  Fantastic.  I can't imagine making another stuffing.

This stuffing does have great complexity of flavors. Everyone who ate it for Christmas dinner gave compliments on it. It was, however, very rich, with the sausage in it. I will probably make it again, but I will probably add more bread, as it seemed to vanish, and my family likes dressing a bit breadier.

This was the best stuffing I have ever had.  Everyone at the table agreed with me.  I doubled the recipe, except the liver.  I still used the liver, just did not double it.  I also baked it in a large casserole dish instead of the bird.  We were unable to find turkey sausage, so we used regular pork sausage.  I can not say enough how great this recipe is!  I'm craving it even now..I think I will make it for Christmas dinner also!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  Everyone RAVED about how great this stuffing is.  This is now our permanent Thanksgiving stuffing!!  The only change is, I cooked the stuffing in casserole dishes instead of inside the turkey and I left out the liver.  AWESOME!!!!!

I hate mushy stuffing and this was PERFECT!  It had great flavor.  We do cook it outside of the turkey, so we add a little extra broth, but it's still perfect.  We make a layered Thanksgiving Hash the day after and the layer of dressing really does add the most exquisite flavor.

Excellant! made this last year and was requested again this year. Used Pep Farm Country Style stuffing about 4 cups, 1# Italian sausage meat, 3 cups of canned Turkey broth, did not use the liver. Baked in a 2 1/2 qt
casserole for 35 min at 325. Will be on the table next time also.

I made this stuffing for my husband's and my first Thanksgiving dinner togather.  I chose it because of all the great reviews.  It was awesome!  I almost had to stop myself from nibbling away at it while the turkey was roasting.  I think I made too much for a 10 pound turkey (although the cavity was rather small).  I cooked the leftover on the stovetop.  I modified it a bit, since we don't like cranberries very much, I substituted the cranberries with 1 peeled and cubed pear and I also added a little sliced fried bacon for flavor.  Went very well with the apple.  I will definitley be sticking to this stuffing!  I also served the meal with a Gewurztraminer ... the fruity flavor of the wine complemented everything wonderfully!

Very good.  I made this as a side dish to go with my deep fried turkey and it was very tasty.  I'd LOVE to see how it tastes cooked inside the bird.  If it was this yummy cooked in separately in the oven, I'll bet it's scrumptious baked inside.

I used this recipe last year at Thanksgiving and plan on using it again...everybody loved it! It was delicious, even without the turkey liver, which I omitted. Give this recipe a try, you won't be dissapointed!

I tried this with chicken sausage and it came out delicious-next time I'll try with ground chicken or turkey instead-the stuffing was a little too "chunky" for my taste so depending on your preference, chop the bread into very small pieces or even throw them in the food processer after toasting.

This stuffing is the best that I have ever tried....and I've tried them all! I added walnuts and used very little white bread and got rave reviews. The second time I made it I used sprouted whole grain flour-less bread and it went over BIG with very picky in-laws.I think that the best feature about this recipe is that it is versatile and you can add and change it easily. The search is over! Thanks

I have made this stuffing using this recipe for the last 4 years and out of all the dishes I make for Thanksgiving, this is the one that everyone wants more of and also the recipe for.  This stuffing pleases everyone, even the picky eaters.

This was a very good, only slightly sweet stuffing. It is perfect for those who don't really like fruited stuffing because the apples are not at all overwhelming. I skipped the celery and water chestnuts. Everyone raved about this stuff. Next time I will cook the bacon separately first - it did not get as crisp as I would have preferrred. Also I made this with venison instead of beef and it was absolutely fabulous. We will have this stuffing again next year.

Excellent stuffing!  It was enough to fill a 20lb. bird, feed eight adults and three kids.  Unfortunately we didn't leave any leftoves!  The only changes I made were to use a granny smith apple and not to add the liver.

Everyone thought this stuffing was good...but nothing to rave about. I was expecting awesome and I got mediocre. I added more stock...it would have been really dry following the recipe exactly.

This recipe will be on our Thanksgiving table by popular demand this year.  So, Stacy, our family will be thankful for you, as we enjoy this special dish this year.  I prepare this as a side dish, so I have to add extra stock.  I find that stuffing and gravy made with homemade turkey stock makes everything taste perfect.  I also learned to make the stock two days ahead to avoid the last minute rush.

I had heard great things about a cranberry, apple and sausage stuffing that a local upscale dining restaurant served during it's Thanksgiving buffet, so I decided to surf the net and see if I could find a recipe for it to make at home.  I was a little skeptical when I saw the ingredients so I stuffed the turkey with this dressing and made an additional pan of regular cornbread dressing.  My husband and family LOVED this dressing.  My reg cornbread dressing is still sitting here in the refrigerator 4 days after thanksgiving but the sausage-cranberry-apple recipe was GONE by the next day.  My husband insisted this dressing replace my usual from here on out!  I used 2x the amount of cranberried and used low fat pork sausage instead of turkey and it turned out excellent.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I absolutely love this stuffing! I love the flavor, texture, and spices. My family now asks for it every Thanksgiving holiday...and I won't make any other kind! I omitted the livers and used dried cherries instead of dried cranberries...absolutely fantastic!

This was by far the best stuffing I have ever had. All 6 people who had it with me said the very same thing. I left out the chicken liver though, I don't know how much of a difference that makes... Thanks so much for such a great recipe, I wont make any other stuffing ever again!!

I have made this for every family holiday function and it is loved by all!  I bake it in an oven bag at 350 for about 30 minutes or until the internal temp of the stuffing is 165 degrees.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

WOW!!!!!!!!! I took the stuffing to a party last night. BIG HIT!!! I did a few things different. I used the peteridge farm herb seasoning, I used mild italian sausage (because I had some already cooked), and I used chicken stock (about 1 1/2 cans). I pre cooked the onions and celery and sausage, so 1 hour before we left I threw it all together and popped in oven at 350 for 45-55 minutes. YUMMY! and many wanted the recipe. The apple in it were AWESOME!!!! Thanks so much for posting.

My daughter, the aspiring chef, enjoyed making this recipe at our last Thanksgiving holiday dinner.  The stuffing that came out of the bird was delicious.  The excess stuffing cooked in a casserole dish was a little dry. I will moisten the casserole version with more chicken broth next year.  This will be one of our holiday favorites!

What a fine taste this was. I stuffed the bird with it and made a pan on the side. I basted the stuffing with the turkey juices throughout the day and put it in the oven a half hour before the turky was done and it came out so great!  I think the amount of stock is too little.  I used more like 3 cups and again alot of basting juice!

My husband who doesn't usually comment about food unless prompted said spontaneously as he was dishing out leftovers to heat in the microwave, "this is GOOD stuffing."  He likes his mom's traditional one so he thought it was weird when I was putting sausage and cranberries into the mixture when I was making it but he really liked the results, esp. the cranberries.  Don't be shy about putting the whole bag of dried cranberries in.  Also, put more broth in than the recipe calls for.  I did add liver in the recipe, not his favorite thing, but he didn't notice.

I was looking for a new stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving.  This one had such great reviews, I decided to try it.  Everyone loved it and requested it again next year.  I made some changes - I used 1 bag of store bought cube stuffing and 1 bag of corn bread stuffing mixed together instead of making my own.  I skipped the liver and used extra chicken broth to make it more moist and added extra craanberries, too. I will definitely make it again next year !

This was the first time I contributed to my family's Thanksgiving feast and it was a HUGE hit! Not only did it taste delicious, it was the most beautiful thing on the table! Even my brother who never tries the stuff really liked it. Next time, I would reduce the sausage and increase the bread. A little too much meat for my stuffing tastes.

I used to make Stove Top every Thanksgiving, but never again.  This recipe is so easy, but it tastes like I slaved in the kitchen for hours over it!  It is so delicious...bright flavors and beautiful colors in this stuffing!  THE BEST!!  Coworkers are begging for this recipe!

I used dried cherries instead of cranberries, used more stock and omitted the liver. It turned out wonderfully. Next time I will try it with different kinds of bread like sourdough and rye.

This was certainly a big hit for our Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I doubled the bread portion and most of the other ingredients but not the sausage. I made the stuffing the day before and therefore did not have the turkey stock at that time, so I used canned chicken broth.   I opted not to stuff the turkey like I normally have done for years because of all the caution on the TV shows... So I put it in a casserole and covered it with foil and baked it for about 40 minutes.  

I will make this again.  I might try using a mild Italian sausage next time.   Dried cherries might be a nice change too.  

Thanks for a great recipe.

You'll either really love or really dislike this recipe.  The review by my guests were 50/50.  I think the sausage gives it too strong a flavor.  Kids gave it a thumbs down.  But if you do want to make this, you'll have to add quite a bit of chicken stock to the batch you want to bake separately.  Also, I used freshly squeezed orange juice which added to the flavor nicely!

I made this for Thanksgiving. I was so nervous but I have trusted the reviewers on this site  when it REALLY counted (like today!) before and once again I was not disappointed. Everyone was right. This dressing was sooo good. I omitted the cranberry and did not put anything in its place. Everyone raved about this dressing. Thanks for a keeper!

My husband and I thought this was really good, but my 6 year old was almost in tears with just having to try it.  That said, I don't think it's very kid friendly.  I'd like to make it again, but I think it might be a while.

Adding the cranberries is wonderful! The first time I made it I only made a small batch and then a larger traditional batch. Everyone loved the cranberry one and I had only the traditional batch leftover, whcih was a disappointment on leftover night!

This was great.  Used cornbread dressing instead of fresh bread, and a whole package of chicken livers, but then I also tripled the recipe.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make it this way next time.

It’d been a while since I’d made this recipe and I couldn’t remember if I made it as written or if I followed the recommendations about the extra yolk/corn starch. So I made one as written and one with extras.  Here are my observations:

I LOVE this stuffing!  It has all of the flavors of fall ;  apples, onions,  sausage.  Not too sweet, which is important to me and when I use fresh herbs instead of the dried, the flavors come even more alive, if that's even possible.
I used regular pork sausage because it's what I already had in the freezer, and I left out the liver because it doesn't appeal to my family.  Everything else just came together beautifully.
I HIGHLY recommend this stuffing recipe!  Oh!  I almost forgot...  I toasted some walnuts and rough chopped them to add to the dish...   I AM THANKFUL!  :-D

We make this year and year out.  It's a family favorite that needs to be brought every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  We do some small modifications of adding an egg and extra stock.

I use Jimmy Dean sage pork sausage and sometimes use croutons.  Bake in a casserole  dish at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  --and I always double the recipe, skip the turkey liver and double the amount of butter.

LOVE this recipe! I found it years ago and have been making it ever since for every Thanksgiving. I hate going to others' houses for Thanksgiving because I know they'll use some cheap, $0.99 box of stuffing... No thank you! I did end up changing this recipe a little bit. I don't go very heavy on the seasonings because they end up being a little too strong for my taste (basically, the teaspoons aren't level... just barely under the line). I usually use whatever apple I have on hand and definitely lay off the parsley (again, too strong for my taste). Instead of turkey sausage, I use regular ground sausage (maple flavored) because who's trying to be healthy for THANKSGIVING?! Also, I don't even add the turkey liver or turkey stock. I just leave that out completely. We do a maple-brined turkey which is seriously the best thing you could ever do to a turkey so the maple sausage and the sweetness of this stuffing blends so well together. Finally, I usually split the stuffing into 2 different bowls right before I stuff the turkey. Again, this is just for preference because my husband likes the stuffing straight out of the turkey but I think it's gross when the bread/croutons are soggy and wet so now everyone is happy... and hungry. I'm hungry just writing this review for this amazing stuffing!!

I have been making this for 10+ years. I do use Pepperidge Farm Sage and Onion seasoned stuffing cubes as a shortcut (oh well). Also a mix of dried cranberries and raisins. Add extra broth to keep the texture from not looking too dry. I like it fluffy and not sticky. This recipe is by far the best and so easy. It is always requested by my Daughter!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit I made it again for Christmas!  The only thing I changed was I used Boudain instead of sausage for a little extra spice because who doesn't like a little Cajun.  Thanks Stacy for posting such a great recipe!

This was really tasty and everyone enjoyed the recipes. I made a few modifications for time and taste:
I used sage turkey sausage (no casing) from Whole Foods. The recipe also calls for turkey liver; they are small and you hardly notice the texture so next time I might use two.
I used cornbread and unseasoned white bread crumbs (pre-packaged Petridge Farms for time).
I also used chicken stock. It calls for 3/4 cups and I thought this was really dry. Luckily I prepared at least 4 cups, adding to the mix to reach the consistency I prefered.
I added fresh ground black pepper and sea salt and almost doubled the sage.

This is the only stuffing I will ever make at Thanksgiving! It's different, creative, and delicious. I strongly recommend this dish.

I'm not going by my opinion of this recipe as I am not a huge fan of stuffing of any kind, but our guests commented on how good it was...so thus the 5 Stars!!  I used sage sausage, granny smith apple (had it on hand) and chicken stock instead of the turkey.  Topped it with sliced almonds. Thanks, Stacy!  For those who do like stuffing it is a great recipe.  You'll like the compliments you get from it!

Third year making it and it is a hit every time. Have had people admit that they take dressing more as an obligation at the Thanksgiving table, but come back for seconds and third after trying this stuff. Love the cranberries and apples in it.

My to stuffing recipe to bake outside the bird. Since I prefer my stuffing baked outside the bird and this one is meant to go "inside the bird", I increase broth to 3 to 3-1/2 cups and toss in 2-3 raw eggs to keep it moist & help bind it together. I swapped out the turkey liver for 1 smoked or baked chicken thigh diced up. Bake the stuffing mixture @ 350 degrees in a large baking dish for 30 minutes covered with foil then remove foil & cook for another 15 min. making top crispy & the bottom moist & de-lish!

My husband found this receipe here several years ago and it's the only dish I ask him to make every year at Thanksgiving- regardless of where we are.  It has become the dish I look forward to most. Be aware that everyone loves it, we made 2 batches this year. Oh, I don't think we've ever noticed the step to include a cooked turkey liver.... so that is our one change. Yummy without it. ;)

I've used this recipe for many years  at Thanksgiving and it has become a family favorite!  I cook it in a 9x13 pan for 45 mins, covered.  Definitely try this one -- it's a nice change from the typical stuffing!

Absolutely amazing! I couldn't find turkey sausage so I used regular pork sausage and it was scrumptious! For ultimate flavor use fresh herbs. You won't regret it.  I stuffed the turkey but had enough left over to cook separately in an 8x8 pan. I cooked the extra and used it as garnish around the turkey. The pan cooked stuffing was wonderful but the stuffing inside the turkey was sinfully wonderful. Thanks for posting.

Absolutely delicious! I made this as a separate dressing and it was the most popular dish this Thanksgiving. I did compensate by adding my broth. It baked beautifully in an hour. Mixing it halfway per a previous viewer's suggestion was also really helpful. It also reheated very easily!

I made this last night for my friends and hubby.  Everyone loved it!  The only changes I made were using premade stuffing bread (I think an herbed one), beef broth instead of turkey broth, sweet Italian pork sausage, and no liver.  It really was amazing and I can't wait to make it again.  I was worried that it would be too mushy, so I only used 1/2 cup of broth--this was a mistake (especially with the premade bread).  I highly recommend this!  Thanks for sharing!

This is very similar to Ina Garten's recipe on Food Network--which I have been making for a few year or so now. This dish is great. Sometimes I find myself craving it and will make just this for dinner as a comforting meal.

My new favorite stuffing.  I was stuffed with it by the end of the meal.  We used cornbread stuffing mix instead of the bread the recipe calls for.  SO much better!

It was alright. Tasted better out of the bird, but in all the hoopla i may have forgotten to add more stock to the extras. I think also should have chopped the apple finer. Will try again.

I served this recipe for stuffing for our family Thanksgiving dinner.  It was truly a hit!  First of all, it is colorful which is very appealing, and secondly, the taste is wonderful.  I was asked for this recipe by a couple of my guests.  Truly a wonderful stuffing recipe!

The best stuffing ever!!  I separated into two pans and added chopped giblets to one pan for my in-laws who like their stuffing with the gibs.  I used sage flavored pork sausage, fresh herbs and an herb "stuffing" bread and day-old Ciabatta bread.  instead of the turkey sausage I used sage flavored bulk pork sausage.  Will definitely make this again!!

This stuffing was an awesome hit with the family. I doubled the recipe, and was able to stuff an 18-pound turkey, as well as have a bread pan full of extra. Even my picky daughters loved it!

Great stuffing, will be a staple for my holiday meals for sure!  I don't stuff the bird, and put the stuffing in a 13" x 9" casserole with the following mods: pork sausage, double amount fresh herbs, a bag of cornbread pepperidge farms stuffing(14 oz), 2 c. chix stock.  Cook for about 40 minutes at 350.  I love the flavors!

Fantastic recipe!  I used half and half white and whole wheat french bread, made the apple into an applesauce before mixing it in rather than making chunks, and used fresh herbs rather than dried.  Stuffed the bird with it, which made for a more moist dressing than the portion I baked in the oven.  We all loved it!  It's super easy and wholesome to boot.  I highly recommend this, even for the beginning cook.

YUM!  I love this recipe.  The only changes made were to use italian sausage instead of turkey (what we always have) and omitted the liver because my mom threw it away!  I loved the combination of flavors and could just sit and eat this all the time.  Thanks for the amazing (and easy) recipe :)

I first tried this when a friend made it for a pot luck. I demanded the recipe and now It is my "secret recipe". Just delicious! If I cannot find turkey broth I use chicken or vegetable. Still turns out moist and delicious. P.S. I never put it in the turkey.

I've used this recipe 3 years in a row and am looking forward to the 4th! I've used all kinds of sausage - ground or sliced links. Either works.. it just depends on what you like.

I grew up on cornbread dressing, but wanted to try something new several years back. This stuff is like crack! It gets eaten up very quickly because most people go back for seconds or thirds. I have been making this for several years now and this will remain my go-to stuffing recipe. I leave out the liver and bake it in the oven- don't stuff the turkey because we buy a smoked turkey from a local church. It is soooo good! Also- this can be easily made gluten-free-I just used a gluten free loaf of bread.

It is keeper!  I made it the day before to save time but it was a little dry so  I am going to make it the day of  next year. I did add a little white wine for moisture; nice flavor!  I used pork sausage instead of turkey and skipped the turkey livers.

I didn't have any dried cranberries, so I used fresh ones instead.  This was probably an error on my part because of the tartness. Instead I should have used fresh pomegranates.  The color would have been the same and it would have been sweeter.

Other than that, the recipe was perfect.

Great stuffing recipe!  I had to substitute a couple of items- I used sourdough bread, acombination of pork sausage and minced kransky sausage, and crasins instead of dried cranberries.

Made for turkey day.   This is a great recipe! Used fresh herbs doubled as other suggested,  but also recalculated recipe for 15 people.  I also used ALOT more stock, chicken stock. Maybe 4 or 5 cups!!  Cooked in a15 x 10 pan for 2 hours.  The result was fantastic!  I wil definitely use this recipe again.  Might even add more herbs.

Very delicious! I used Italian pork sausage and preseasoned stuffing mix (so I didn't add as many herbs) I cooked it outside the bird at 350° for about 45 minutes covered and it turned out perfectly.

This stuffing was the hit of our family Thanksgiving dinner.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used fresh herbs (double quantity of fresh herbs).  The highest compliment...there were no leftovers!  Thanks for this truly awesome recipe!

OMG this was so good. I read all the reviews but i was still a little unsure but decided go for it! I used chicken stock and added just a little bit more to it. I did not cook it in the turkey as i was in charge of making stuffing and my sister was making the turkey. So i put it in a casserole dish at the very end and baked it at 325 for 35-45 mins. It was the best ever and everyone loved it!

Awesome stuffing. Best I've every had! I had some trouble with the amount of broth, 3/4 cup was wayyy too little. I had to increase it but just eyeballed it. The stuffing I put in the turkey was way to moist, but the leftover stuffing I cooked in the oven was perfect after I let it dry out (in the oven) a bit.

I just tried the stuffing yesterday...

Wow it came out tasting fantastic...

I wasn't able to find some of the the turkey sausage so I used ground chicken.  I also left out the turkey liver ...

For the stock, I added about 1 extra cup full to really soak the bread...it made the stuffing taste more juicy...

You might also want to add a few shakes of garlic powder in the mixture...

It was just ok...it was a little heavy on the sausage.  It was good enough to eat, but we're not exactly excited to have leftovers.  Will probably try something different next year.

I have been making a very similar apple, sausage stuffing since my first Thanksgiving dinner. Hubby and the kids do not like cranberry so I just use the apple and sausage. My version uses a total of 1 cup liquid in the form of 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup apple juice or cider. Makes it a little moister and more flavorful also. For the sausage I like the JD maple flavored links for even more flavor. The stuffing is always the best part of the meal and people beg me to make it every year.

I only know how to make dressing with cornbread so that's what I used.  I also added extra apple and cranberry.  My family now expects this dressing at holidays.  Very good and freezes well.

This recipe was a huge hit last Thanksgiving. I made two changes. I did not use any liver, and instead of cubed bread, I used Pepperidge Farms seasoned stuffing mix that comes in a large bag. Phenomenal! This is a meal in itself!

Took this to church for a pitch-in.  People liked it, but many said they would rather have it in the fall.  I will try again and update the review.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  Made one batch and stuffed it in the bird and made a second batch cause I knew they were going to gobble it up!

Amazing!  This has become a staple on my table for Thanksgiving.  I skip the turkey liver & use canned chicken broth.  Fresh herbs are worth the extra $$.  I bake it in a dish, rather than stuff the turkey.

Great! I didn't use the turkey liver and used chicken broth instead. I also use Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing in a bag. I use craisins too.

I hate cranberries but instead I just added more apples, celery and onions. I will always use this recipe from now on!! It was delicious!

I have made this for 2 Thanksgivings and Christmas' now. It's a fantastic recipe! I usually prepare it the day before and let the ingredients mesh. I also add more stock.. which other reviewers recommended if you're not using it to stuff the bird. This will definitely be a favorite holiday dish throughout the years!

This will be the ONLY stuffing I make from here on out!  It was great.  I didn't stuff the bird with it, just baked it in a caserole dish.  I did add extra broth and butter to keep it moist!  Also I prepared it all the day before and refridgerated, then baked the next day.

I have made this stuffing 3 times since finding this recipe.  I do not use turkey liver and use chicken stock instead but it is still amazing.  I am starting get requests for this every holiday.  I have even started adding nuts.  It is great!!!!

The first year I made this stuffing, I wasn’t too sure about it.  I wanted something different, made/modified this.  Nobody said anything so next year, I made the “old” stuffing.  Everybody wanted to know where the cranberry stuffing was!  With just the regular bread, it turns out too mushy so I buy the stuffing mixes and mix with regular cubed bread.  Totally omit the turkey liver.  Add seasonings to taste and it’s great!  One year I also added a handful of golden raisins.  It’s excellent!!

Yummy!! I added lots of chopped pecans.  Great extra touch there. I think next time I will add more chopped apples as I couldn't tell there was any apple when I ate it. But definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! I made this for our first time hosting Christmas dinner, and it turned out great! I used a chicken kielbasa sausage (because by the time I made it to the store, that was all they had left), left out the celery and used fresh herbs instead of dried. Great recipe!

Yummy recipe!   I love the sweet/savory idea of dried cranberries with sausage.  All I had onhand was Italian sausage, and unfortunately that did not work at all with the flavor profile of the stuffing... oops!   I used fresh herbs (twice as much as dried) and I felt the combo was too heavy on the sage and rosemary, and too light on the thyme.  In general I think rosemary and sage go great with sausage, but thyme goes better with poultry, so consider what this stuffing will be served with and adjust accordingly.

Made this for Christmas dinner. A huge hit. Used Jimmy Dean sage sausage instead of turkey. Added 1 egg and a little extra low salt chicken stock. Ued fresh herbs and a granny smith apple. Absolutely excellent- made 10 servings for 7 people and they ate all of it! We will have this again for sure.

This is an absolute hit at our house.  I use pork sausage because we had homemade pork sausage in the freezer.  I double the amount of broth. Craisins instead of cranberries. Fresh herbs when I can find them..  Cook in a 9 x 13 dish, covered for the first 40 minutes, stir and then cook uncovered for 20 minutes more.

LOVE IT, since I don't stuff the turkey with it I use all the turkey drippings, instead of the stock, to moisten the stuffing. So incredible!

While making this, my mother looked at me like I was CRAZY. This is NOT your momma's recipe. After a few bites, she was hooked. I omitted the liver and used sage Jimmy Dean sausage-Like most people. Everything else is the same. I made it the day before and threw it in the oven for Thanksgiving.  My house smelled SO good!  I will make this EVERY Thanksgiving from now on. My family loved it and it tastes "hard to make" but was EASY! My toddlers even liked it!

I decided to make a regular slow cooker stuffing this year for Thanksgiving.  It was bland and boring and I missed my delicious sausage, apple, cranberry stuffing!  This recipe is so tasty, I almost can't put it into words.  I'm making it for our Christmas dinner because I missed it that much!  I don't do the liver, and I use Jimmy Dean's sage sausage, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  You will not be sorry to tried this and you'll want to do it every year from now on!

I never made or had stuffing with sausage, man was I missing out! This mix with the apples and craisins was so good, I was bummed that my family thought it was good too and I barely had any leftovers. I'm going to need to make this again even though it's not Thanksgiving.

this is a FANTASTIC recipe! i was nervous about trying it out, but it turned out great! i'm really glad i decided to go for it. i did, however, use jimmy dean sage sausage instead of the turkey sausage since i couldn't find any. i made it as directed and it tasted wonderful, but it didn't have clumpyness that i'm used to in a stuffing, so i put everything in a 9x13 pan and drizzled a little more stock to it and put it in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes.  came out delicious! will definitely be using this for christmas!

WONDERFUL!  Everyone loved this stuffing!! It was a bit labor intensive chopping everything up, but well worth it.  I did as other reviewers suggested and added more broth than called for.

The perfect Stuffing! I only used half of a large onion and no liver yet it was still fantastic. For extra flavor I used Italian seasoned sausage. Next time I will make double the amount. This will go fast.

Made this for Thanksgiving last week. It turned out AWESOME! I didn't change anything, but I will admit I did not measure out everything exactly, kinda just threw it all together until I thought it looked good, lol. But everyone loved it! Will definitely make it next year!

Thanks Stacy! Your recipe is great. I used fresh herbs still going strong in the garden, about 2-3 times the dry amount. Next time I'll cube the bread a litttle smaller than I did on my first try. I left out the liver and baked with a little more broth. I would say 6 servings instead of 10.

Stuffing is my favorite part of Thanksgiving. I made it this year for my very first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner, and I must say it was absolutely FABULOUS. It was the first dish gone! Even my boyfriend who does not like fruit in dishes that do not normally have fruit loved it. He said it was his favorite part of the meal, even though he was skeptical about it. WAY flavorful and delicious! Thanks!

This recipe got RAVE reviews at Thanksgiving dinner!  One thing I would have changed though is that I would have used a little less sausage, and a little more apple and cranberries. That's just personal preferance though.  I used Sweet Italian Sausage and instead of chopping it, I squeezed it all out of the skin and just ground it up.   I also used Sourdough bread that I left to get stale for a good 3 days before cutting up.  Overall a great recipe and with some homemade gravy....  MMMMM...!

Fantastic. I made potato rosemary bread in the bread machine for this, and it worked really well. I also added some of the pan juices from the roasting Turkey to give it something extra. I added an egg and cooked it for about 5 hours on low in my slow cooker.

This was just okay.  It tasted fine, but honestly, it didn't taste any differently than the traditional bread stuffing I make every year.  I chose it for the sausage, but you could barely notice any sausage flavor at all.  Maybe there should be more.

Absolutely the best stuffing I have ever had in my life!!!  I will never make stuffing from the box again.  Followed the recipe almost exactly... the only difference I did was I used 6 cups of cubed ciabatta bread and fresh herbs (doubled for fresh).  Delicious! There wasn't a single bit left after doubling the recipe for just 10 people! Don't hesitate this is unbelievable!

My family was so skeptical about this recipe but ended up loving it!  We don't put it in the bird so as other reviews have stated make sure to have extra stock so it's not too dry.   When in a pinch for time you can use pre-dried bread cubes from the grocery store. Literally reduced the cook time down to preparing ingredients and heating the stock!  Enjoy.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving 2 days ago and it was AWESOME.  I will never use another recipe again.  My whole family loved it.  Even though they were making fun of me as I was making it.   I read a lot of reviews saying that people didn't stuff it into their turkey, but I REALLY recommend it!  I had a small turkey, and stuffed it as full as I could and had plenty left over to put in a casserole dish.  After they both came out, everyone in the family thought that the stuffing in the bird was better then the stuffing in the dish.   Both were delicious, but the turkey gives the stuffing so much extra flavor!!  Great recipe!  Thanks Stacy!

I made this stuffing for the first time this Thanksgiving. My husband, who doesn't eat stuffing, couldn't get enough of it.  I used a bag of pepperigde farm dried bread seasoned stuffing mix, cut the amount of herbs in half (since the mix was already seasoned), cooked the onion with the sausage, and omitted the turkey liver. Since, I cooked the stuffing separate from the bird, I used a whole carton of chicken stock to keep the stuffing moist. I baked it in a 13 x 9 pyrex dish for about 30 or 40 minutes covered with foil. I took the foil off for the last 10 minutes to get a little crispiness. This will be my turkey stuffing for years to come!

This was awesome, with the tweaks I made. No turkey liver or parsley (don't care for either), doubled and used fresh herbs (to die for), used Sage Pork Sausage, used good sourdough bread in place of white bread and potato bread in place of whole wheat.  Also doubled the apple and added a pear.  This was the BEST dressing recipe ever, will never make a different one again.  This is the best recipe on this site!!!

Wonderful recipe. My husband was on turkey duty and actually used boxed stuffing to stuff the bird, so I had to come up with alternate way to cook the stuffing. I mixed it all together as per the directions and tossed it into the crockpot on high for 45 mintues. Came out perfect and ready to serve.

This was the best stuffing ever.  I used pepperidge farm stuffing mix.  The key to this is using sage sausage, turkey sausage is too bland. I did not have dried cranberries but threw in a few raw ones from the bag.  I did not taste the apple maybe next time will use two apples. Before putting in oven i poured more turkey stock in and some butter.  This was fantasic and east to assemble the night before.

So delicious! My family loved it! I did however omit the liver, and added fresh garlic, and shallots very thinkly chopped to the sausage mix. I also used hot sausage which surprisingly was not hot at all. As others stated, having fresh herbs is key. I also put it in a casserole dish for 40 minutes at 350. I doubled the stock but added it between cooking time and stirred while baking in the oven. I will be definately making this again!

It was my first Thanksgiving Dinner Hosting! I was so incredibly nervous, but everything went off without a hitch! The stuffing recipes is awesome - in my nervousness, I even forgot to add a few of the herbs, but it still was delicious. My fiance, who hates stuffing tried it and took seconds! I left out the sausage (didn't have any and didn't want to spend more money). All in all - amazing, yummy and makes me want a bowl of it right now! Thank you sooo much for sharing!

I made this following the recipe; however, I didn't stuff the bird. My family ate the entire batch. This is amazing, considering that they don't eat cranberries as a general rule. Great recipe just as it is!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe, except that I cooked it in a casserole dish in the oven, instead of inside the bird. I used 1 1/2 cups of stock instead of 3/4, on the advice of some other reviewers here. The flavor was sensational! It was moist, rich and delicious. This recipe is too good to save for Thanksgiving -- I'm sure I'll be making this dish often.

I love this stuffing! It is fabulous. I will share this recipe with everyone I know. My boyfriend also loved it and he usually smothers his stuffing in gravy just to be able to eat it. He said its the best he has ever had, (with no gravy)! The only change I made was to use quite a bit more liquid as I like my stuffing very moist and I did not use bullion, instead i simmered some of the herbs from the recipe in chicken broth and used a 1/2 cup of that along with broth from my turkey. It was wonderful!

Wow! I hate stuffing but my aunt asked me to make it for thanksgiving because I'm known for bringing new and creative recipes to family events. This was outstanding...I could eat it straight for dinner! I made several changes based on personal preferences...I used bagged corn bread stuffing cubes and white bread cubes (faster and easier...we are a corn bread type of family), I used turkey keilbasa instead of sausage (not big on sausage), and I opted not to add the liver (just not my thing). This wasn't dry at all as long as you added a little extra broth and checked it every 15 minutes (adding more as needed). I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes covered and 15 uncovered. Highly recommend this recipes!!!!

I absolutely love this stuffing!!! I've made it a few times for thanksgiving. I actually used to hate stuffing before trying this recipe. I usually omit the celery because I can't stand the stuff. This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I can't rave about it enough!

Delicious - I left out the turkey liver - I was using a turkey breast and I didn't have the livers and it was just fine without it.  I couldn't find plain turkey sausage so I bought the turkey sausage patties and used them.  They worked just fine.

Just made this for our fake Thanksgiving last night. Really a great dish and worth the extra effort over the boxed stuff. Versatile too; I used cornbread crumbs and pre-cooked turkey sausage. Took the advice of other reviewers and made the night before, reserved some of the stock and baked in the oven since we fried a turkey. Delish!

This was truly delicious.  I made it last year for Thanksgiving...and it was good enough to please my mother-in-law! The cranberries and apples are a great sweet contrast to the sausage and spices.  This will be a staple at every Thanksgiving.

Delicious!  I omitted the turkey liver as it was difficult to find, and my mom used the liver from the turkey to make her stuffing.  Tasted great even without the liver.

This was fantastic! I made this for Christmas dinner with turkey and prime rib and everyone raved over it. I didn't cook it inside the bird though, and even though I added more broth as recommended by many reviewers, it was still a tad dry. Not so much dry as it wouldn't bind together.  Next time, I'll add more broth & maybe an egg or two to bind it together... but I'll definitely be making it again!

This stuffing is awesome.  I cooked it in a baking dish instead of in a turkey.  I used sourdough bread, hot pork sausage, added about 2 cups of chicken stock for moisture, used fresh herbs and omitted the liver.  Deeeee-lish!

Being a vegetarian, I substituted the vegetarian burger crumbles for the turkey sausage and miso broth for the turkey stock. Otherwise, I followed it to the "T". This recipe was  nothing short of excellent even with the substitutions. Everyone loved it.

I use this without the meat for a vegitarian option and it is just great. I add a little broth to make up for the lack of fat/grease.

Have made this recipe for my family for the last 2 years, was absolutely delicious both years.  I'm now expected to bring it each year.  To keep it moist, I pour a little more chicken broth over the top before the butter.  Fantastic stuffing!

Best stuffing ever!  I subsituted sage sausage and already toasted bread cubes.  I exclude the liver.  It really is very easy and is to die for.

Wonderful!  I halved the amount of white bread used and substituted the missing half with corn bread.

My family LOVES this stuffing.  Will never go back to the boxed stuff again.

This recipe is a must have for our holiday meals. My family would be so disappointed if I didn't make it. This year I used boxed bread crumbs which must have been pretty salty. If I used boxed stuffing again I'd use unsalted butter This stuffing could be a meal in itself. If I could give it more starts I would.

What an awesome stuffing! For this recipe, I also left it out of the bird. I like my stuffing moist, but not drenched. I used Farmer John's Old Fashioned Maple Sausage, or traditional  non-cooked sausage, and the smell just made my mouth water. It is a bit more fatty, but it's once a year.. so why not?! I didn't have sage herbs so I didn't put any and it tasted just fine without it. I used Craisins because I don't like tart and Fuji apple which tasted great. For the bread I used 5 cups of both sweet bread and sourdough. The stuffing turned a little more on the sweeter side, but my guests raved about it all night as they scraped for pieces. This style doesn't have too much bread, so it's really meaty.  Try doubling the bread or decreasing to only 1/2 lb of sausage. If using more bread add 2 to 3 tbs butter.(Using only 1 can) I also used chicken broth every 20 min without drowning. Stirred as one of the reviews stated. Cooked another 30 min, added more. And another thirty. Stirring gently does help cook evenly. Add the broth or stock gradually to the consistency you prefer. A friend even said he could just eat the whole tray by itself! I knew I should have double the batch. Great recipe!

I used all white bread cubes for this recipes, used pork instead of turkey sausage, chicken instead of turkey stock and left out the liver. I cooked half the stuffing in the bird, the other half I put in a container with 1 cup extra stock and cooked with the turkey for the last hour at 325. It turned out superb. Great texture and flavor. Will definately use it again.

This was such a hit! We fought over the left-overs, and there wasn't much left over! I used a bag of Pepridge Farm herb stuffing and added an egg and extra chicken stock then the recipes called for.  Soooooo good!

Well from all 11 people who were at my house for Christmas dinner they all rate this stuffing as a 10!  I put it in the oven and cooked it for 2 hours at 350 F.  I doubled the recipe, quadrupled the stock, and used two packages of Turkey sausage instead of ground turkey and the liver.  This was hands down the best stuffing we have ever tasted.  Thanks to Allrecipes for having such an amazing site.  I have never been let down yet.

This was excellent! I made the stock the night before while brining the turkey. I used Pepperidge Farms Country stuffing bread cubes, everything else I followed exactly. I prepared the night before and added liquids next day, baked in 9x13 pan for 30 mins.

This turned out great for me and everyone loved it!  I used 1/2 dark rye bread and 1/2 flourless whole wheat bread and out of habit (and because we like a moister dressingt, I didn't toast the bread.  For this reason, too, I added shredded boiled potatoes.  I don't stuff my turkey but cooked it on the stovetop and put it in the oven to keep warm.  I also used fresh herbs.  It was great!  I'll definitely make this again next year :)

Very yummy. I used lean ground turkey instead of ground turkey sausage for healths sake. It was still amazing and my in-laws who will choose the fattiest of the fatty foods over anything remotely healthy were very impressed and gobbled it up.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I think I should have used it to stuff the turkey instead of making it on the side. That probably would have made it much more tasty, juicy.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the turkey liver and used italian seasoning instead of each herb separately. I found that it tasted better as it sat longer.

Moist and delicious!  I didn't cook it in the turkey, but in a throw-away pan.  I stirred it several times so that it wouldn't dry out.  This ones a keeper!

Made this for the first time this year.  It was really good.  Next time I will add more apples, I think.  Also, the stuffing in the turkey came out a lot more moist that what I had in the pan.  Be sure to add more broth to your pan stuffing and watch the salt.

Made this last Christmas and really enjoyed it.  It took a little getting used to, since I've been making cornbread dressing for both Thanksgiving & Christmas.  This was a really nice change and very festive with the apples and cranberries.

My family was nervous about how this might turn out, but were all singing my praises once I was through with them! I made a happy mistake of picking up cilantro instead of parsley and they demanded I keep it in the recipe because it added to the flavor well. Feel free to add extra apples! The only change I'd make next time is tossing the cubed bread with some olive oil and dried thyme and basil, my holy Mediterranean triumvirate of cooking. Enjoy! Oh, and it's especially wonderful with a cranberry-orange relish my grandmother made.

This year was my first time ever making Thanksgiving and I decided at the last minute to make my stuffing from scratch AND stuff the Turkey.  I am SO glad I did as this stuffing was my favorite part of the entire meal!  I had a 10-pound turkey and I was concerned that this recipe wouldn't make enough stuffing for the meal plus leftovers, so I doubled it...and ended up with twice as much stuffing as I needed!  Also, one batch went into the turkey and one batch was baked separately and I will say that the in-turkey stuffing was much tastier and moister than the other pan.  Also, in one batch I used homemade whole-cranberry sauce and Craisins in the other, and I preferred the sauce version.  The cranberries blended more with the other ingredients in every bite, rather than remaining slightly hard/chewy and standing out.  I also threw in a bunch of chopped walnuts that I thought turned out to be a key ingredient. I used bagged cubed Pepperidge Farm stuffing, sage sausage, left out the liver and rosemary (forget to buy it...) and doubled the fresh herbs.  This could not have been more delicious and it will be a staple for me from here on out!

I will never EVER make any other stuffing ever again! I decided against the turkey sausage as i thought it would be too much turkey inside the turkey. Instead i used ground pork. I kept to the rest of the recipe. For the bread, i used whole wheat and Challah (i still had some left over from the holiday... I celebrate Canadian thanksgiving in October). All in all, if you want to impress people at the dinner table, make this moist, and flavourful stuffing.

This recipe is so yummy.  I've taken the advice of other reviewers and used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage.  I always use fresh herbs for holiday cooking.  The addition of fresh sage with the sage sausage was a little much though.  Next time I'll do one or the other.  I staled my own sourdough bread cubes, and I have to say I prefer french bread for this stuffing as there are already so many strong flavors in it.  I left out the liver because I don't like it, and even though I only put in a little bit of the rosemary, I'll leave it out next year.  I just don't like it.  I used a Honey Crisp apple because it would not get mushy.  I didn't stuff the bird and so used a lot more broth than the recipe calls for.  Also, next year I will try to add an egg to help with binding.  The only real mistake I made this year was I followed the advice of another reviewer and put everything together except for the broth the day before and then added the butter and broth just before cooking.  My bread cubes got soft just sitting in the fridge with the other ingredients.  If you need to make this ahead of time, I recommend keeping the sausage mixture separate from the bread until you are ready to either stuff the bird or bake it in the oven.  Great recipe and easy to alter to make it your own.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving! I did not stuff it into my turkey - I baked it (covered) for about 35-40 minutes at 350. Because of some other earlier reviews I used extra chicken stock (about 1 cup) and it turned out great. The flavors were extremely delicious and worked very well together!

The only change I made was omiting the liver and it was FABULOUS! Even my husband who doesn't like stufing is a fan. This one is going to be a staple on the Thanksgiving table.

I made this for '08 Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it. Even my niece, who hasn't found a stuffing she liked yet, enjoyed it. It was agreed that it should be our yearly Thanksgiving dinner stuffing recipe.

This recipes was easy to make and was really tasty both in and out of the bird.  I did omit the liver and upped the cranberries.  It held up beautifully for leftovers.  Definitely will make again!

Incredible stuffing recipe – was the hit of our Thanksgiving table!  I did not stuff the bird but baked the stuffing in a 9 x 13 casserole, covered for about 40 minutes.  I used Jimmy Dean Sage Prok Sausage, added extra stock to moisten and used all fresh herbs- I did not use turkey liver and it was still AMAZING. I will NEVER use another stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving- This dish will be a staple at holiday dinners for years to come!

Awesome recipe. I made this the night before reserving the liquids, used pork sausage instead of turkey (couldn't find any) and left out the liver. It was a huge hit. I will be using this again long before next Thanksgiving!!

Just devine! I used pork sausage meat and doubled the level of sage. We stuffed half in the turkey and half was baked alone. It was very popular and tasted fantastic, complementing the turkey perfectly. I actually had a bowl of stuffing on its own the next day! Will make this again for sure

After all the rave reviews, I expected nirvana.  Although a bit disappointed, it was just okay, but I will make this again and put in a substitute for the turkey sausage--maybe Jimmy Deans?  The turkey sausage smelled wrong--like bolgna. Not good. But love the apple and cranberries.  We did not stuff the turkey and used this recipe as a dressing--baking it in covered dish for 25 minutes at 300 degrees.

Phenomenal!!  This was the first time we made this recipe and it will definitely become a staple at our holiday dinners.  Because we couldn't find turkey sausage, we used fresh pork sausages (casings removed). Delish!  We used 2 kinds whole wheat bread from the bakery.  Omitted the turkey liver because we didn't have one from the turkey this year.  The only other change made was increasing the chicken stock to about 2 cups.  Didn't measure exactly - just added stock until the mixture looked moist enough to go in the oven for 40 minutes.  The only problem is we don't have any leftovers!

Delicious!  I was very worried about trying this recipe, just due to the fact that all that I've ever made, or had at my family's house, has been the box stuff.  I have to say this recipe is VERY simple to follow, and the results are marvelous!  I though it had such a wonderful flavor and got rave reviews from all of my dinner guests.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  We'll have this every year from now on.

I used this recipe yesterday- it's the first time I have ever made stuffing - it turned out perfectly! Since we were smoking our bird I wasn't able to stuff it, so I made the stuffing early in the day and put it in the crockpot instead. It worked wonderfully! I just stirred it every couple of hours so it wouldn't get too crispy against the sides of the pot, and it worked great! Everyone loved it. I left our the liver and used the sage Jimmy Dean sausage as someone else suggested. Great recipe!

I was nervous to make this, but it came out good.  I did not add the cranberries because I had made cranberry sauce and thought it was overkill.

Made it yesterday for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE LOVED IT! I used Jimmy Dean Sage Pork Sausage, Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing and unseasoned cubed stuffing from a bag. I left out the liver and celery, personal preference. I made it the night before and then put it in my slow cooker on high for 2 hours to warm and added some turkey broth to prevent it from drying. I will definately make this again. Everyone is already requesting it for Xmas. I doubled the recipe for 14 people and only had a little bit left.

This was DELICIOUS! I made this stuffing today and my husband said it was the best he ever tasted. I used onion bread instead of the plain white and whole wheat and it tasted terrific. I also added scallions to the recipe. I will definitely be making this stuffing again for Christmas and other holidays!

When I made this recipe, i made a few changes. I used pork italian sausage, and i felt that it was just a little dry, so insted of using dry cranberries, i put fresh cranberries in 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of water and boiled it for ten minutes to make a sauce, and put that in insted. Everybody in my family ate it up like animals!

This is THE best stuffing ever!  I used it last year, and my husband raved for hours and even told his friends about how it good it was.  He won't let me make any other kind now!  I used golden delicious apples, but think that granny smith apples would be equally delicious.  I used dried cranberries, and the tartness of the cranberries mixed with the sweetness of the apples, added in with the yummy turkey sausage (I used breakfast turkey sausage in the 1 lb tube, you can find it in the ground turkey section) is heavenly!  I do stuff my turkeys, and it turned out incredibly moist.  Just be warned, once you make this you will be responsible for all of the Thanksgiving dinners from here on out!

This is my third year with this stuffing.  I always grew up with cornbread dressing, so I have always used cornbread instead of white bread in this recipe.  To answer the last reviewers question, I have never added sausage, and it is perfect without it.  This is my favorite side at Thanksgiving!!

Great homemade stuffing! My husband likes to add spicy italian sausage. The spicy is a good mix with the tart-ness of the apples. I've never added the cranberries because I always forget them at the store! We've also modified this recipe using stove top cornbread stuffing and it worked well.

I love this stuffing, made it last year for Thanksgiving and I'll be making it again this year.  Although the turkey sausage is healthier, I use Jimmy Dean maple or sage pork sausage and I had all fresh herbs available so I used those as well. I don't stuff in the turkey, and the stuffing is perfectly moist, and still good for leftovers.

I loved it - didn't have the mushy texture of a lot of stuffings & loved the mix of textures & flavors.  Omitted the celery (personal preferance)  My family are more traditional stuffing fans - so now we have a batch of "mom's" and "everyone's"

I think this is good but just too fancy for my family.  I think I will stick with non-fruit stuffings in the future.

My husband was a little hesitant to try this recipe, thinking it would be "too much." However, we all loved it. The recipe will be incorporated into our holiday meals from now on.

We started having Thanksgiving at our house a few years ago and even though I do the dinner, my mother in law usually makes the stuffing because everyone loves it. Well, this year I decided to make my own anyway and used this recipe. Everyone absolutely loved it, even my mother in law. Definitely a recipe worth making!

Incredible taste!!!  My family only uses this recipe for our holiday dinners.  I've used store bought stuffing mix rather than fresh bread to save time and still comes out amazing.

This recipe is ridiculously good.  I didn't put the sausage or liver in.  Instead added 1 more apple.  In addition I replaced all herbs with herbes de provence (I was being a little lazy). Every single person that we had over for Turkey dinner was like "this is the best stuffing I have EVER had, pass some more".  One friend told me every week for the next 4 weeks how much she loved it and thought about it.

I thought the recipe was good, had lots of flavor, but will probably stick to traditional flavored stuffing for future thanksgiving meals.

I've made this twice now and love it everytime.  The second time, I didn't add enough chicken broth (Cooked outside of the turkey) and the bread was a bit dry.  I made this the day before.  Used Granny smith apple, and Jimmy dean Sage sausage as suggested.  I also used fresh herbs the second time around and it was more flavorful than the first time when I used dried.  I used potato and sourdough bread the first time which was perfect.  I used french bread and potato the second time and prefer the sourdough over the french.  I drizzled it with butter before refridgerating and then let the mixture come to room temperature before baking for 30 minutes the next day.  1/2-3/4 of the can of chicken broth would get it moist enough for me next time, but that is personal preference.

This is lighter and fluffier than the savory dressing we normally fix.  The fruit lends an unexpected sweetness, so plan to balance that out with more savory sides.  We like to fix this with wheat rolls or different breads at the bakery's sale racks.

This recipe is so delicious. I substitute maple flavored pork sausage instead of turkey and it goes amazing with the Maple Roast Turkey recipe from here. My family members all called me for the recipe after I made it a couple of years ago and it has quickly become a staple for famly get togethers.

I used fresh herbs to make this stuffing and it was outstanding.  I also used the sage sausage that many others suggested.  Instead of stuffing the bird I just heated chicken stock on the stove and added a little at a time to the bread mixture until it was moist to my liking.  I then put it in the oven for about half an hour while the bird was resting.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

This was very good! I did not add the liver. I did use more broth and apple because I needed to make this ahead due to limited oven space. It did not dry out even with reheating. I used fresh herbs and doubled the amount. I also used a sage sausage. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I've used this recipe about four times now, and each time, it has come out fantastic.  On Christmas, we were having ham, so there was no turkey to make stock with.  Instead, I used chicken innerds sold at the grocery store, and this worked great.  Also, I didn't have craisins, but I did have some fresh cranberries.  These, I boiled with some (a lot) sugar, until they "popped".  This worked quite well, also.  Great recipe!

I am sorry I put the liver in...I am not a liver fan. AND it seemed every bite I took had some of that liver in it!

I tried this recipe for the first time last year, and combined this stuffing with 'The World's Best Turkey' submitted by Sarah, which is made with Champagne - it was wonderfully moist and delicious with the Sausage, Apple & Cranberry stuffing in stead of just apples, and for a little difference, I also added some chopped pistachios into the recipe which turned out to complement the other flavours beautifully.

My family raved over this recipe.  I can't stress enough how important it is to use fresh herbs.  The aroma and taste were both to die for.  I highly recommend chopping all of your vegetables and herbs the night before and setting them aside, as this will save value time the morning of Thanksgiving/Christmas.  It will take longer than you think, but it's worth it.  As for the bread, I used sourdough and wheat, but next time I think I'll use potato bread.  I think sourdough may not have been the best choice though is was good and recommended by other reviewers. I used pork sausage with sage which was FABULOUS.  I also added a handful of pecans... yummy.  This makes a ton of stuffing, so if you're having less than about 10 people, I would scale it back.  I will use this recipe every year.

Excellent stuffing. The flavor was incredible. I used all fresh herbs, which I think it a requirement. Also, I minced the dried cranberries before adding. I did think the stuffing could have held together a little more, so next time I might add an egg or a little more broth. However, the taste was still incredible. I did not cook in a turkey, just in a roasting pan, and it came out just fine.

My family Loved this stuffing.  We don't really like turkey liver, so I did not put that in. I DID add Dried Cherries instead of cranberries.  What a hit. I made 2 batches and thank goodness I did. The first large pan was gone really fast!

I made this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving.  Everyone absolutely loved it & were begging for the recipe.  No one at my table had ever had anything like it.  I did follow other's advice and add an egg b/c I baked it in a dish vs. putting it inside the turkey.  I also used fresh herbs/spices & added extra chicken broth to keep it most.

This truly was "awesome".  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I didn't include the liver and used sage pork sausage, like some reviewers suggested.  I cooked it in the crockpot, so I added a bit more broth to keep it moist.  It turned out great.

I made this stuffing for the first time this Thanksgiving and it was a favorite of my family. Will make this every Thanksgiving from now on. I did not put it in the bird. Instead, I added a couple small cans of chicken broth and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, covered with foil.  I  took the foil off the last 15 minutes to brown the top.

Yay!!!  Everyone loved it!  I omitted the turkey liver, made it the day before my thanksgiving dinner and then threw it in the crockpot the morning of.  It really shrunk though... was not enough for 8 people!  Next time I will double.  Mmm mm!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I'm adding my name to the long list of lovers of this recipe. The man loved it, and it was easy. Thanks, because my mom-in-laws recipe is three pages long. Very delicious but I never expected to conquer it.

Great recipe! We will make this a staple at our Thanksgiving table! Very easy and turned out great, I cut the bread in cubes the night b4 and left it out overnight to get crunchy I didn't toast the cubes in the oven. I used the turkey broth from boiling the giblets but was planning on using chicken broth. I kept adding more bread cubes once I started mixing the broth in and realized the recipe called for stuffing the turkey.. OOPS! Turkey was already in the oven, cooked stuffing in a casserole dish for 30 minutes on 375. You can mess with this recipe all day and it will still come out fantastic!

I don't like stuffing. That said, this was awesome! My husband didn't even want to try a fruit stuffing, but he loved it! This is awesome. Thanks for the goodness.

My husband and I hosted our first Thanksgiving at our house this year... and this recipe was a hit!  "You really out-did yourself" is what I have heard over and over again.  I didn't include the turkey liver.. but everything else was done pretty much as it says.  The flavor of this stuffing is remarkable and I will make it EVERY year for years to come.

This is an awesome recipe. This is the firs time I've made stuffing from scratch, and was very pleased with the results. I did make a few changes, though.

I left out the liver, and used Bob Evan's savory sage sausage instead of turkey sausage.

I added the sausage mixture, apple, and cranberries, to 5 cups of toasted sourdough bread cubes, and poured the butter and 1 cup of chicken broth over it.

Instead of cooking it inside the turkey, I baked it in the oven, covered, at 350 for an hour. It turned out moist and perfect.

I made this outside the bird and had to use a lot of extra broth to keep it moist.  Also added two beaten eggs to bind it all together.  It was a bit sweet for me (maybe from the craisins I used?) and didn't get all that great reviews from my family.  I also didn't like the "crunch" of the bits of apple.  Will stick with the regular bread stuffing from now on.  Also took a lot more time than it stated in the directions.

Very Yummy!  Not your traditional stuffing - but it was very good.  I also used an egg in the mix, the fresh herbs are a must.  I used the Jimmy Dean's sage sausage as suggested, but next time I think I'll only use 1/2 pound instead of a full pound.  Great Recipe!

Amazing, amazing, amazing. The flavor is very fresh, very Autumn. The tastes are well-paired and balanced: the apple has a nice sweet flavor, the cranberries add just enough tartness; the seasoning just savory enough. It's no surprise why it's so highly rated: it's a winner.

I used pork sausage for flavor and used fresh cranberries (just more of 'em).

This recipe has so many great reviews for a reason!  It was a smash hit at my Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing I would do differently would be chop the rosemary up into small bits.

It seems silly for me to leave a review since there are well over 600 positive reviews already, but I just have to add my thoughts. My husband and I got married three months ago and thought it would be nice to stay in town and celebrate Thanksgiving together in our new home. It was the first Thanksgiving meal I'd prepared and the first time I'd made stuffing from scratch: what a confidence booster! This was great and my husband was so impressed as well. Like others, I prepared it seperately from the bird, covered it and cooked it for about an hour and a half, stirring it every so often. Next year, we'll be traveling to go to my Grandma's like I have since childhood, but I'm going to offer to bring the stuffing! Thank you!

I would've given this 4.5 stars instead..  I, personally, thought this was delicious! My family enjoyed it too, but no one raved about it except myself.. So because of that I had to give it 4 stars..

Also, other reviewers had suggested to add more stock if you want it mushier since it's not the typical thanksgiving mush... but no one stated how much more.  Well, the recipe calls for 3/4 cups.  I put in 1.5 cups and it came out nice and moist but it wouldn't hurt to just put in the entire 16oz can (2 cups).  I think i'm going to do that next time. 

I don't care if it didn't get raves, i'm still making this next year! I def. prefer this fresher version of stuffing to stovetop.

My mom made her traditional stuffing, so I decided to make an alternative. all I can say is WOW!! My hubby who does not like stuffing, devoured this one. I have to say that I ran out of celery, and used fennel stalks in its place. It added the most delightful flavor. I also ommitted the liver. This will be a regular at the holidays, and I will continue to use the fennel instead of celery. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This is the best stuffing in the world EVER. I have been making this recipe for years now and it's never let me down. Everyone I've ever made it for rave about how good it is and I never have any leftovers. I always cook it outside the bird, adding more stock and cooking it at 325 for about an hour. It's perfect. I never cared much for stuffing until I started making this. Now I can't imagine Thanksgiving without it!

OK, this rocks.  I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving, but wanted to try it first, so I made it for a potluck, and it was a hit.  I used dried herbs, because that's what I had and skipped the turkey liver, but other than that, pretty much followed the recipe.  

Oh, yeah, we're having it for Thanksgiving, too!

AMAZING!  We just finished preparing this for Thanksgiving tomorrow and my kids keep stealing spoonfuls of it.  I omitted the turkey liver and used chicken broth.  Also used sage sausage and reduced the amount of sage to 2 tsp.  AMAZING!!! I can't wait for tomorrow.

amazing!  I too used this recipe as I didn't want to even try to compete with my Mom's dressing.  I did a trial run, and it was super yummy!  I baked it on the side and didn't cover it, so I just added some stock as needed.  I will cover it tomorrow and I'm sure it will be fine.  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Sorry but the texture of this was horrible! Sausage does not belong in stuffing.  Without the sausage this is probably really good.  I'm not sure how this recieved so many great reviews.

this is a wonderful recipe.  I'm a southern girl, so cornbread dressing is my favorite.  But, this has great flavors combined together.  We just prepared this for 175 people and it got very good reviews from most everyone.  It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end.

This is the same basic recipe my mom used for years, but the addition of cranberries and use of turkey sausage really gives it a punch. I made this last week to "preview" the results. I will be updating our stuffing this year. Great recipe !!!

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend and it turned out great.  I had bought all the ingredients listed and at the last minute found out that one of my guests was a vegetarian.  I omitted the meat in this recipe and was worried about still being able to achieve good flavour, so I increased the amount of broth (I used vegetable stock), herbs, cranberries and apple.  I also added a veggie cube in with the onion and celery as I was sauteeing in butter.  Awesome results!!  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and used sourdough and rosemary potato bread.  Delicious!  Very happy with this recipe and will definitely make it again and again, with or without meat.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! I've been making this stuffing for Thanksgiving for a few years now and it impresses every time. It's colorful, easy, and delicious! I'm always proud to set it out on the table.

I wish that I could rate this at 4.5 stars ... every year I get to make the 'guinea pig' dish, as in 'try something new' ... about 1/2 of the group was totally in love with this, while the other 1/2 thought it was ok/good ... I'll be making this again as an alternative to the traditional 'stove top' type of stuffing.  I had a request for the recipe so it could be used on leftover turkey sammies ... it's a keeper!

Have made this the past three years for "The Holidays". It has replaced the families previous traditional recipe. The combination of the apple, cranberries, sausage and spices is a great addition to holiday memories.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. It had such high ratings I figured there was no way I could go wrong. But WOW! This stuffing is one sweet recipe! IF I ever make it again (which I'm not sure I would) I'd cut both the apple and cranberry amounts in half. I felt like I was eating dessert, not stuffing.

This was very good. We made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a nice change from the traditional bread dressings. I will probably make it for Christmas or Thanksgiving another year. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  I added an extra two cups of bread cubes since I had them and more chicken broth (subbed for stock) and more butter as I baked it outside the bird.  No liver.  Next time I'll soak the rosemary in the broth to soften it up more.

WOW is it super good! I sub'd Smart 
Choice for the butter and used 50% less fat sausage...still totally Yum-O! I also used a lot more broth. I think I'm making this for fun again this week. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe  for about 8 years now and it has become a Thanksgiving tradition! If you're not the biggest fan of stuffing, this stuffing might change your mind! The first time I read the recipe I misread it and purchased just regular pork/beef sausage because I couldn't find "turkey sausage". Years later I realized that it said "ground turkey sausage". Oops! The thing is that it tastes great with regular sausage. I cut it up in little squares and it tastes DELICIOUS! Finally last year I tried doing it the right way but I am going back to the sausage. Much more flavorful.  I also used sourdough bread last year like one user recommended and it did taste much better. I have used both dry and fresh herbs. Fresh is definitely better and don't forget to double up if using fresh herbs. I do it on the stove top because I don't like stuffing my turkey so I use double the broth, at least. I stop when I think I'm happy with the texture. I'm not a fan of extremely mushy stuffing so use a lot of broth if that's how you like yours. Anyway... do this recipe!! It's da' bomb and this is coming from someone that did not like stuffing for years. :)

This stuffing is just what it says, awesome!  I did add about 1/2 tsp extra sage and a dash more thyme.  I also doubled the broth as I like a more moist stuffing, plus I baked it a casserole dish and didn't want it to dry out.  I used Jimmy Dean Maple flavored sausage.  My Dad says it's our new Thanksgiving stuffing.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I toasted only wheat bread, did not add butter, and did not add turkey liver (ewww.) I put some in the turkey (used Michiganer turkey recipe from this website) and some in an 8x8 pan.  I took some of the liquid from the turkey and added to the stuffing in the pan.  I also used sage sausage.  It was really good. Next time won't use cranberries: it wasn't something the family cared for. But the flavor was great.

I live in the middle east where it is hard to get certain items. I couldn't find dried cranberries by themselves so I put in a fall dried fruit mix (cranberries, cherries and apples). I also put in a very basic pork sausage as I could not find turkey sausgae. It was SO GOOD! Besides the turkey, it was my favorite thing of the night for Thanksgiving and all of our friends from five different countries liked it too.

What a great recipe!!  Yesterday was the first time I had ever made stuffing, and I got rave reviews from everyone.  I cooked it in the slow cooker (4 hours on low, added cranberries and apples 1 hour before finishing) to save room in the oven.  It turned out GREAT...the flavors all blend together really well.

Didn't Like Was just to much different seasonings I think if I made again I would leave out the marjoram.

I'm not a sausage fan so I used bacon instead.  It came out awesome.  Even my family who love Stove Top really liked it.

Made this for a group of 29.  Everone loved it.  It was a hit!  I used peppridge farms bagged stuffing instead of the bread the receipe called for.  It worked great.  I used fresh herbs as recommended by previous reviewers.  I too used more stock.  Simply delisious!

I was excited to try this recipe for Thanksgiving, and I had read most other reviews.  Since so many people had said that this recipe can turn out dry, I added about a half cup more stock.  I cooked my turkey in a bag and stuffed it, and I had some extra that didn't fit, so I cooked it in the bag next to the turkey.  The juices from the turkey made ths stuffing a little soggy.  It still tasted great, but if you cook your turkey in a bag, keep in mind that the stuffing will absorb some of the juice.  Great recipe- a nice change from stovetop!

I cooked my first Christmas dinner.  My husband and I were used to the traditional celery and onion stuffing our mothers make and wanted to try a sausage stuffing.  I was hesitant about the fruit being in it, but trusted the reviews and gave it a try.  What a great blend of flavors and it was exactly what we were looking for.  The fruit was a great compliment without being overpowering and everyone loved it!  We did not put it into the turkey so it was a bit dry, so next time I'll add a bit more stock before cooking.

This was probably the best stuffing I've ever had. The only thing I'd change is to add more bread next time.

Fantastic! Even my kids who refuse to eat stuffing will eat this one. I substituted turkey sausage for a family member who is allergic to pork and used all fresh herbs (dried herbs have a more concentrated flavor so if you use fresh herbs double the amount called for). Thank you so much for the recipes. It has become a standard holiday stuffing in our house. :o)

This stuffing was amazing!  I used sage flavored pork sausage; much more celery and onion; half white bread cubes and half wheat; and added more chicken broth to moisten my additional ingredients.  I also used more cranberries and apple.  WOW!  I baked it in the oven at 350 for one hour and I could not have been happier with my first homemade stuffing attempt.  I will continue to make this one!

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and increased the amount of broth.  I also omitted the sausage and instead added chopped pecans.  It was delicious, and the pecans added just the right amount of texture.

I hosted my 1st Thanksgiving this year and tried this stuffing...it was a hit.  I didn't use the chicken liver and used pork sausage instead of turkey.  Next time I think I would use more apples.  It was fantastic!

Excellent stuffing recipe! I used a bag of Brownberry cornbread stuffing cubes and 1 lb. of Bob Evans sage pork sausage. Everyone loved it and wanted the leftovers. Next time I will probably add more broth to the recipe, but that's a personal preference. This one is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely the best! I used a bag of seasoned bread crumbs, a can of vegetable broth and no liver. We had individual cornish hens so I baked the stuffing separately. Perfect!

This will become my family recipe! It is delicious. I left out the liver (otherwise my family wouldn't eat it). Try substituting white wine for the turkey stock -- gives it a very gourmet taste.

This is by far the best stuffing I've ever made.  I first made it for 200 people at church, then for 10 at Thanksgiving, and again for Christmas.  I doubled the recipe at Christmas because I knew we would want lots of leftovers.  Makes a great meal in itself!  It has fruit, protein, and carbs, plus it's delicious.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!

Used pork sausage instead of turkey, added about 1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning and used the cooked liver - very finely chopped.  My dinner party guests were standing in the kitchen picking at the left overs in the kitchen!!  They loved it.  Will make for Christmas.

Very tasty, but didn't stand out as much as we expected.  One thing everyone in my family noticed is that we couldn't tell that there was sausage in it.  Next time we'll leave the sausage out, since if you can't tell anyway, why bother adding the calories!  The cranberries and apple are an excellent addition.

We make this stuffing every year for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVES it!!  We substitute celery sausage for the one in the recipe, but any type will work.  This is the best stuffing our family has ever had and they always ask us to make it every year!  I highly recommend using this recipe - follow it exactly & you will wow your family with this outstanding stuffing!

My whole family loved this recipie, even though I made it vegetarian.  Substituted soy sausage for turkey sausage and vegetable broth for turkey stock; omitted turkey liver; increased amount of broth, onion, celery, apple; used fresh herbs.  Prepare for a serious time investment, especially if you add extra liquid.  After baking in dishes, it came out slightly crispy on the top and chewy/moist/soft inside.  I made a double batch for 6 people, and NONE was left over.  Delicious!

I am not a big cranberry fan, but I have to admit everyone loved this recipe, including people who don't like stuffing or cranberries. I made this on Thanksgiving and then on Christmas due to the requests. I have never made homemade stuffing from scratch and I have to say I was not the only one skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised. It not only tasted good but looks great on the table. Much better than your boring, everyday stuffing.I did leave out the liver, not a fan. I will definately be making this on the special holidays. I do have to say I needed to use more bread than called for, other than that...FANTASTIC!!

My husband's not big on stuffing, but he loved this one!  I left out the liver, and used chicken stock, and doubled the recipe for a 22lb turkey, and cooked half in the turkey and half in a covered dish.  I also added 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts.
Excellent recipe - thank you.

We LOVED this stuffing over the holidays. I made it outside of the turkey, in an oven proof dish where I did add some turkey drippings & water. It was great! Next time I want to make it by adding some pine nuts which I think will add a nice crunch to this recipy!!

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was excellent!  It was a wonderful change from the standard flavor of stuffing.  The cranberries and apples add a freshness to the whole dish.  

I would highly recommend this recipe.  We followed the recipe except for leaving out the turkey liver and using chicken stock instead of turkey stock.

WOW! This is by far the best stuffing recipe I have ever made! It will definitely be a new family favourite! I made the recipe exactly as given and everyone oohed and ahhed at how wonderful it was. I had a 20lb turkey so I doubled the recipe and I had about 2 cups leftover that I cooked separate from the turkey. My only problem was that it was so good I ran out of the leftovers on boxing day!

We made a smaller serving and baked it outside the turkey, and while I had to make do without some of the ingredients I couldnt find outside the country, it was still really good...moist and a good mix of salty and sweet.

This dressing was a hit!  I tweaked it here and there using ground turkey and four Johnsonville sausage patties for a bit more flavour.  It was great. A highly recommended recipe. Toasting the bread is an important step.

I have to say, this stuffing was incredible!And I have very high standards for food. I made this for Thanksgiving 04 and it was a big hit! Was my 1st time making stuffing, and I am SOOOO glad I didn't use some mushy Stovetop recipe. I left out the liver and parsley, and doubled the dried cranberries, also I added about 1/2 cup extra stock since I baked it in a dish instead of stuffing in into a turkey. And I used canned chicken broth instead of turkey stock. After I browned the sausage with the onion I pureed them in a food processor to make a smoother texture. Will be making this for Christmas!

This stuffing was SO yummy! I used spicy pork sausage instead of turkey, which gave a great flavor! I also baked it in a bowl instead of stuffing the turkey. Baked it just until the top was nice and crisp. I found that the flavor got better the day after Thanksgiving. I'll be making this for Christmas but will make it a day ahead.  Great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit on turkey day.  However, I had to make a few modifications since I did not use it to stuff the bird, but as dressing instead.  I added another 1/2 of stock and baked it in a covered casserole dish for 45 min at 350 degrees.  
The only thing bad about this dish is that there is never enough!!

Wonderful recipe. We baked the stuffing at 350 degrees for 30 minutes instead of stuffing it in the turkey. Turned out great but next time we'll grease the baking dish.

This is the best stuffing recipe I have ever tasted.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I didn't add the turkey liver and it seemed fine.  I also didn't stuff the turkey, I cooked the stuffing in a crock pot on high for about 2 hours.

At first I was skeptical about this recipe. But I made this for a large group for a potluck and it was a huge hit. Several people wanted the recipe. I omitted the liver since I was not making a turkey at the time. I will definitely make this again and again.

Yummy!  I didn't have ground sausage so I used ground turkey and added more spices.  It was delicious but I think next time I'll try it with the sausage.  Will make again and again.

I didn't add the liver (as I just couldn't stomach the thought of eating a vital organ...), but I don't think it mattered.  The stuffing came out delicious--even family members who only eat Stove Top Stuffing found it delicious.  It tasted like a stuffing from a fine restaurant.  Will definitely use this again!

Absolutely amazing.  I have never made stuffing (or any other Thanksgiving item) and used this when introducing my British boyfriend and flatmates to Thanksgiving--they were sold!  Fresh and at the same time rich, we found this stuffing to be the perfect complement to the turkey.

I thought this was pretty good, but everyone I served it to at Thanksgiving thought it was incredible!  I did make a couple of changes, most notably including fresh cranberries because I like the tartness they provide.  I did add about two tbsp of honey to account for that.  I also used flavored chicken sausage (since I don't eat pork), which also turned out to be quite tasty.  Will definitely make again!

This was my first Christmas dinner and my in-laws had flown in from across the country.  I was looking for a stuffing recipe and tried this one.  Wow...did I impress my mother-in-law, who is herself, gourmet cook.  Thanks!  FYI though, it took me about 45 min to prepare, NOT 15 min. as the recipe says.

My husband did not want me to make this for thanksgiving - he wanted the traditional stuffing.  I really wanted to try it, however, so when our regular stuffing ran out the day after and he wanted more, I made this.  First off, the smell is incredible.  I was quite apprehensive about the cranberries and did not use as much, but Wow!  This recipie is great! My husband went nuts for it! Thank you!

This recipe was truly "awesome"  I made a few alterations to the recipe by using cubed sourdough bread and wheat bread and I also added chopped pecans.  I did not stuff the turkey, but chose to bake the dressing in a casserole dish.  It really was the best stuffing I have ever tasted!

Oh my! This was the best stuffing ever. I am a picky eater and this was not something I wanted to try making, but my sister-in-law had the idea. I did not regret it! Didn't add the turkey liver. Used 2/3 cup dehydrated minced onion instead of a real onion, and added a bit more broth (used chicken). Turned out fabulous. I will be making this again and again. My husband has requested it as a meal all by itself. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

For my first ever "I'm doing it all" Thanksgiving, I used this recipe and was blown away. My mom's always done an onion/sage dressing (which I hate), but she raved about this, and took the leftovers home.  I subbed honey maple pork sausage, dried cherries and craisins, and used extra canned chicken stock.  I'm definitly doing this for Christmas again!!!

The fruity taste of dried cranberry and apple made a fresh accent to my turky dinner. I replaced turky sausage with turky bacon but still tasted great !

This was the first stuffing I have ever made and took it to our family dinner. Everyone raved over how good it was.  The only thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of the turkey stock, because that is what I had. This will definitely be used every year.

i used this recipe last year and will use it again. Very good. I used vegetable broth and no liver. I also added the sausage at the end, after I took couple scoops out (I am a vegetarian) an baked them in a separate dish. The rest of the stuffing stuffed a 15 lb turkey. Everybody, includingkids loved it. No leftovers at my house!

Excellent. Doubled the recipe and made a batch of plain stuffing in case someone did not like this recipe. Adults loved it enough to take seconds and in some cases thirds. Very tasty.

This recipe was very good.  I also used pork sausage and added more chicken stock, because I cooked it in a casserole.   345 for 30 minutess and it was delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.  Will definitely use again!!! : )

I made this for a church Thanksgiving dinner. There were at least 5 other stuffings and this was the only one that had no leftovers. The taste is incredible and it even looks pretty with the cranberries and spices. Great recipe! Oh by the way, I baked this separate from the turkey and it was fine!

I made this stuffing for my very first Thanksgiving this year.  I had 15 guests and no leftover stuffing at the end of the day!  It was a big hit!  I used pork sausage instead of turkey, it looked, tasted and smelled great! I've been nominated by my family to make the stuffing every year from now on!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a double batch of this for Christmas. I was not making a turkey so I made it in a crock pot instead. I don't know if this was the problem or the recipe itself. Out of 22 people no one took seconds and some even left their first helping on their plate. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it had a grainy texture that was not pleasing. My suggestion is ~ if your family already has a traditional stuffing recipe to stick with it. They don't necessarly want something new.

Whew, this was a lot of work! It tasted really good, but I don't think I'll be using it again. It might have been the type of sausage I used, but it had a really gritty texture that I didn't care for.

I used link turkey sausage because I could not find ground. This recipe may very well be "awesome" but I burnt it, so I really don't know. It did look and smell very good while I was preparing it though.

I am not a stuffing fan and this year I got assigned to bring stuffing.  Even though I don't like stuffing, I wanted to try the results of my labor.  It was great!  I highly recommend this.  I left out the liver, used chicken broth (I didn't have turkey broth), and baked it in an 8x8 pan at 350 for 45 minutes(the turkey was cooking at someone else's house).  A super recipe!

This was delicious!  I cooked it outside of the turkey. Spray your pan and keep covered to hold in moisture.  Be sure to add extra stock if not going in the bird.
FRESH HERBS ARE A MUST!!

I made this for the first time three years ago when I stumbled upon it while looking for a decent stuffing recipe, followed the recipe to a T. Everyone enjoyed it but I felt like there was just a little too much meat, so the next year I halved the sausages and it was perfect!

I didn't make it last year and I regret it, but I've made it this year and instead of Turkey sausage I have used honey garlic sausage from Costco and its absolutely divine! A huge hit in this house. Will definitely continue to make it this way!

My sister found this recipe about 10 years ago, and since then it has been our “family recipe”. I have even integrated it into my in laws side where they request it every holiday! Only changes I make - I omit the turkey liver, use chicken stock, and use mild Italian pork sausage. This recipe is very forgiving when it comes to less/more ingredients depending on palate. I start with the recommended amount of spice although sometimes have thrown in a bit extra. Hands down only stuffing recipe I’ll ever use again! Always a hit first time round.

A.w.e.s.o.m.e! I stuffed a brined bird. Used fresh rosemary and thyme. Replaced sausage with chicken liver and added sage, allspice, pimento peppers, cranberries infused with strawberry juice and honey roasted pecans. Used cranberry walnut sourdough bread. Massaged the bird with salt, black pepper, cinnamon, allspice, grated garlic, sage, bay leaves, lime wedges and butter. Put Idaho potato wedges around to soak up the juices. And voila! Yum yum stuffing plus juicy turkey and baked potato wedges equals empty pan! No leftovers!

The stuffing was a huge hit. I cooked it outside the bird. I made it with Gluten free bread. I bought a loaf of gluten free white and a loaf of gluten free ancient wheat to cut up and toast. I kept a close eye on them bcz over-toasting them isnt a great idea. I also used dried cranberries which added extra sweetness and a nice texture element. I tripled the recipe, used an entire box of turkey stock bcz it seemed REALLY dry without it.  Our gluten intolerant guests were more than thrilled at Thanksgiving that they finally got to have stuffing again! I made enough for everyone and had 3 boxes of cardboard instant stuffing just in case it didnt turn out. One thing I wish I had done was to make this a day in advance. The flavors when combined overnight are so delicious and satisfying. TRY IT!

Followed as-is. Husband was worried at first because this isn't his traditional stuffing, but him and his family loved it! Has good reheat value as well. Use fresh herbs and it smells and tastes heavenly.

Made a version of this. Everyone loved it. I used sourdough & country loaf, a mix of hot and mild sausage. Omitted the liver. Made dressing, not stuffing, so used extra turkey stock to keep moist in oven. The cranberry and apple..delicious.

Great recipe. Just changed a few things. I used 14 oz bag of cubed bread w/o seasoning. Increased the celery to 1c, used regular Jimmy Deans sausage. I omitted the rosemary because I don't care for it. Cooked it in the crockpot instead of the bird, 3-4 hrs on low and so used 1.5 - 2 Cups chicken broth. The combination of apples, cranberries and sausage is terrific.

Made it. It was a big hit and seriously delicious. Made it in the oven instead of cooking in the turkey though. Followed another reviewers advice on adding a lot more turkey stock to compensate for being in the oven (nearly doubled). Cooked it for 40 minutes at 350F day before and warmed it in the oven the next day.

HUGE HIT!  I used pork sausage and doubled the recipe and it was fantastic. Like others, I cooked it outside the bird -- two 9×13 casserole dishes at 350 for 50 min covered with foil, then added more broth and cooked uncovered for 10. Omitted the liver. Used equal mix of white, wheat and sourdough. Added two eggs, but next time I'll add three. Used fresh thyme and rosemary (3/4 T each). Added salt, pepper and garlic powder. 

MY NEW GO-TO STUFFING!!

I have been making this recipe for the last 7 years and  it never fails me. Tonight we'll have 35 for Thanksgiving dinner. I've made it for as few as 11 and up to 35, the recipe scales very well. We never stuff the bird, but bake in the oven. I do as other reviewers suggest and add extra stock as needed during baking. Also as another reviewer suggests, give it a stir after 30 minutes to help baking it evenly and not drying the edges out. I get compliments on this each time I make this recipe. It's a good one! For the vegans and vegetarians in the family this can be made using a vegetable stock and omitting the sausage.  Fresh herbs are the key, just know that that you will have to convert the amount of fresh vs dried herbs--it's not 1 to 1 ration for sure!

This has been a family favorite for years.  If you like chicken livers, add much much more and it is even better.  Also, I hydrate the crasins in Triple Sec or other orange liquor which seems to give it depth.

This is the ONLY stuffing recipe you will need to know for years to come... so delicious you'll wish you could have it all year round. I've personally been making this one for years, and it really is the best. 

As other people have said, fresh herbs will make a huge difference, so do that & double the amount. I also always end up using fresh cranberries instead of the dried ones since I already have them in the kitchen for cranberry sauce. Before adding them to the bread cube mixture, I put them in a pan with some butter over medium heat for 4-5 minutes just long enough to get them blistered.  That helps them cook better in the oven and really release the flavors. Some people have said they don't stuff the bird with this but bake it in a separate dish - I do both. I've stuffed all kinds of birds with this stuffing - Cornish game hens, whole chickens, and of course turkey for Thanksgiving. I'll put the rest in a dish and cook on the side (add more broth and cover with foil).

I am not the best cook but this is one recipe that slays year-after-year.  No matter what mistakes I make each year, people love it.  This year we are going to substitute keto bread to bring down the carb count.  Wish us luck!

I love a good stuffing and one that I can call a meal is even better.  I used a precooked organic chicken sausage (removed casing and roughly chopped) because I wanted to use it up and all whole wheat bread.  I didn't have turkey liver and think that would be wonderful.   I baked it in the 9x13 covered at 350 F for 50 mn then uncovered (stirred and added salt and pepper) and baked for the last 10 as others recommended.  It is a keeper and repeater. My niece brought her family stuffing recipe to Thanksgiving last year and it used braunschweiger vs giblets and I will make sure I have that on hand to add next time.    thanks

A lot of other reviewers made this recipe as written and loved it, but I had some issues and I noticed that other reviewers loved it but made significant changes in how they made it. I used ground turkey that I seasoned myself the day before making this dish but I know know that I if I make it again I will use a pork sage sausage. It just has a different mouth feel along with the obvious flavor and fat content differences.  I used the directions others gave for using a 13x9 pan and it baked up ok. Like others, I used more bread than the recipe called for, and therefore more broth, more apple, more rehydrated cranberries since I had more space than a turkey carcass to work with. It was just ok if not a little disappointing. I think more butter in the broth might have helped my expanded version because of my low fat turkey. I still gave it 4 stars because of the many changes I made and the variables of my ‘turkey sausage’. I just wanted to point out that others made a lot of changes and still gave it 5 stars , so buyer beware.

Made it true to recipe for Thanksgiving.  I did some tweaking base upon input from my husband and son.   Apples are peeled and amount reduced, replaced celery (entire family hates). It replaced my dad's old school recipe, sorry dad, and my basic sausage recipe.  This infuses fruit flavors into meat and bread.

I have made this recipe several times for holidays. It is perfect with no changes, but I do like it with fresh herbs as well. I cook it outside the bird so half way through cooking I take the lid off, stir, and add more broth as needed.

Use regular bread crumbs. I used Ciabatta but bread crumbs too big I think smaller will be better

We've made this for 3 of the last 5 Thanksgivings and it's always a hit. In fact, people often request this to take home for leftovers, so this year we made 2 batches...one for us and one for everyone else! 

The only thing I change is I don't use as much turkey stock because I like mine more dry than mushy... you can always add gravy if it's dry, but if it's too wet there's not much that can be done.

I didn't stuff the turkey with this. My tukey was to feed 20, so I increased the recipe for 20 people and it made both a 9x13 and a 8x10 pan full, which was too much. I used chardonnay instead of champage, ham sausage instead of turkey sausage meat, ambrosia apples and dried parsley. I covered the pans in foil and baked at 375 for 1/2 hour. The flavour was good, it received many compliments but it was drier than I'm used to.

This is the best stuffing I've ever had and I'm a stuffing/dressing junkie.  It's my favorite side during the holidays.  I'm a good cook and great at improvising, but I've never liked any complex or extremely unique variations people have made (oysters and nuts in stuffing?  Not going on my plate).  My mom made good stuffing when I was young but nothing that beat the flavor of Stove Top and usually it was mushy.

I've never heard anyone at any holiday dinner compliment anyone about stuffing before, until tonight when I made this.  Almost every person said it was spectacular.  Every year there is usually a lot of stuffing left and this year everyone had seconds of stuffing and there was about 1 cup left that I ate later...that's never happened around here!  I did make some adjustments and prepared it different than the recipe after watching a chef make a similar recipe.

I used about 3/4 loaf of the Old Fashioned Potato Bread (wider slices) and about 3 slices of Safeway Signature whole wheat bread (the wider slices also).  I used mild italian chicken sausage and increased all the ingredients since I was using slightly more bread.  The night before dinner I cut the bread into about 3/4in-1in cubes and dried it in the oven at 200F for about 40 minutes on a cookie sheet, flipping the cubes about every 5-8 minutes until they were dry like croutons.

I didn't like the idea of dumping the liquid over the bread because I wanted all ingredients blended well, so I did it the way I saw

This was so amazing!  I've never been a stuffing person, but I could eat this all day, every day.  I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and made a few other changes.  I used the sage sausage that had been talked about often in the comments.  I used all sourdough and added several cups.  I skipped the turkey liver because I didn't have one and used chicken stock because I couldn't find turkey.  I prepped everything the day before, but waited to add the bread and stock.  I didn't stuff a bird with it, but rather, cooked in a crock pot.  Because of that and because the family likes more of a mushy stuffing, I added A LOT of stock.  I think  I used a full box.  I also used fresh herbs (except for the rosemary because I forgot it at the store) and used less sage because the sausage already had it.  I know I made a ton of modifications, but this recipe is an incredible base to play with.  I'll probably be volunteering to make this every year because it got rave reviews across the board.

This is the best stuffing I've ever made. My family loves it and request it every year both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've made it using all different kinds of breads but the family really loves it with sour dough bread and I use Jimmy Dean sage pork sausage. I make it the night before as one reviewer said she does and it works out great making for a less stressful day of cooking. I simply add the stock to it right before I stick it in the oven it's not too mushy or too dry.

The title of the recipe says it all. Awesome! Try to use fresh herbs especially fresh parsley. I really think that makes the difference between this and other recipes.

This was my first attempt to make homemade stuffing and it was great!!!!!! I followed ingredients but used fresh herbs. I cooked sausage, then combined rest, except no liquids, and let sit overnight. Added liquids day of and baked. Soooo tasty, not dry, just great!!! Will make again!

To be honest, i took a short cut and used a 16 oz. bag of Pepperidge Farms Herbed Stuffing in place of the bread in this recipe.  I also used more turkey stock than it called for because i cooked it as a casserole -not in the bird.  It still seemed crumbly with the amount of broth in the recipe, so i just added more so it would be good and moist throughout the cooking process. it got rave reviews at the family Thanksgiving dunner.

Been making this recipe for years now, just never rated. I love love love this recipe. A few tips: the JD sage flavored sausage is wonderful. Use fresh herbs if you can, especially Parsley and Rosemary. Next time, I will increase the bread as the ratio seems low next to the other ingredients. When cutting bread to make the croutons, if you cut about 6 cups of fresh bread it will reduce down to about 5 cups once dried, so be sure to adjust for this. I baked it in a pan and then transferred to a slow cooker to keep it warm at the family gathering as I wasn't confident that it would have a crispy top if I cooked entirely in the slow cooker. Truly one of my favorite recipes on this site! Thank you Stacy!

Wow. This is the second time I've made this for Thanksgiving and it is just so good. This time, I tried crumbling corn bread and it wasn't as good as the original, so I'll go back to that. Also, I used both fresh and dried herbs and seasoned the pork sausage with a bit of sage, rosemary, thyme, parsley, pepper, some garlic salt, and Italian seasoning in addition to the spices in the recipe - as I had unseasoned sausage and other reviewers had recommended sage pork sausage. As other reviewers suggested, I increased the liquid since I didn't cook it in the turkey. I used 1/2 cup butter and 2.5 cups chicken stock. Stirring it halfway through really helped make sure that all the bread was moist and that it cooked evenly. Next time, I will also add an egg to help it bind together more.

I used the turkey sausage, egg and extra turkey broth as I did not stuff the turkey.  This was the first time the stuffing was gone at the end of the evening.     Next time I will try the sage sausage and sourdough bread.

I have never commented on a recipe on this site. This is THE best stuffing I have ever made (according to the fam) who thought I couldn't outdo last year! I made this using Gluten Free bread (sourdough and white), fresh herbs, sage sausage, one egg and 2 cups chicken stock and it was amazing! After 6 years of no stuffing in my life this was better than dessert! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Followed recipe with minor changes-used Jimmy Dean pork sausage with sage and Granny Smith apple, as suggested in someone's comment.   It was delicious!  I will make it again, and again.  I loved it!

I’ve been making this stuffing for over 5 yrs  now.  I host Thanksgiving for my family every year, and this dish is ALWAYS part of my menu.  It’s become a tradition in my household & is a must at Thanksgiving!  I incorporate a few  tweaks here and there, but the overall recipe itself is wonderful!

this was fantastic; usually make cornbread stuffing, but tried a gluten free dressing this year; big hit; I used bob mill gluten free loaf of bread instead of bread cubes; this will be added to holidays along with the corn bread stuffing

Our go to dressing, we’ve made it for the past 10 Thanksgivings and it’s always a favorite. Don’t stuff your turkey!!! It drys it out and is potentially unsafe.
Butter a baking dish and cook for 40min covered at 375 and 20-30 min uncovered to make the top nice and crunchy.
Use homemade turkey for that yummy turkey flavor.

This recipe lived up to it's name - Awesome. I skipped the liver and used Pepperidge Farm bread crumbs. I was a little more generous with the turkey stock. It was the hit of my "friendsgiving" dinner party last night!

I used ghost pepper sausages,  as I had a huge crop this year. We doubled up on the bread and spices as the turkey had a huge cavity. result A+. The bread lessened the heat of the sausages,  and we BBQ'd the bird.  Great Thanksgiving dinner!!

What a great recipe!  The best part was that I could do most of it the night before so there was less to do on thanksgiving day.  I just reserved all of the butter and stock until I was ready to put it into the oven and it worked perfectly, total hit!  I did make 2 substitutions - I couldn't find turkey stock so I used chicken stock (and bumped it up to 1 cup since I like moist stuffing), and I used pork sausage instead of turkey sausage (but drained it before adding it to the bread mixture).  Will for sure make again!

I rarely rate a recipe low. This one didn’t do it for me.  For all the ingredients you have to endure to make it, the flavor should be much richer. Found it to be quite bland. Sorry, not a favorite.

Always make this for Thanksgiving and my family always ask me to make again for Xmas. Lots of ingredients but definitely worth it. Recommend fresh herbs as others have.

This was to die for.  I omitted the sausage just because I don’t like it in my stuffing and choose the apples fine.  I used all fresh herbs except the sage.  Will most definitely make again!  Flavors were amazing!

Very tasty recipe - used savory pork sausage and did not drain the fat before adding the bread cubes.  Essentially eyeballed the ingredients.  Would make this again!

WOW! Best dressing ever!  I prefer not to stuff the turkey so I cook it in a buttered skillet for 45 minutes on 350. Also, increase the broth to 2 cups. This one's definitely a keeper!!

As with any stuffing the moisture level is key but easily adjusted. This was a bit dry by tge recipe so I just added some drippings from the turkey. It was amazing. Good mix of spices and just enough sweet bits (apple pieces and cranberries)

This was a hit.  Only thing I did differently  was along with the celery, onion, and spices, I also threw in The cranberries and sautéed them along with the veggies and once done transferred the mixture to the bread cubes  and added an egg to make it sticky. Transferred to a loaf pan as opposed to just a cookie sheet. The loaf came out great and much easier to cut and eat and less mess overall.

This is one of the absolute best recipes. The tang of the cranberries and the sweet of the apples balances the savory of the meat and the herbs so well. I made it with some turkey breasts and didn’t stuff it,so I added more broth and baked in the oven next to the turkey with foil. It turned out so good. Even my youngest, who doesn’t eat stuffing ate it.

Funny story, l thought l would look for something different this year and l saw your recipe first.  The only difference between yours and mine is that l use fresh cranberries, my sausage meat is loose (when l can find it that way) and l add wine or brandy,were Irish perhaps that’s why.

Boy, I wish I  knew what was missing or done wrong .  This was good but I think I expected too much based on reviews.  I followed the recipe and used fresh herbs as suggested... It was okay in my opinion... I don't recall thinking "OH MY, THIS IS THE BEST DRESSING EVER!".  It was dressing, plain and simple.  I did have to put it into 2 baking dishes to feed the guests, so maybe some ingredients went too far one way or not enough the other way.  I don't know, but I'll try it again (in one pan) next year.  Not umarking the "HEART" icon just yet here on AllRecipes.

I made this to take to the neighbors for Thanksgiving.  Everyone liked it and gave me compliments.  I have always made traditional bread/celery/onion dressing in the past.  If I made this again, I'd reduce the amount of sausage; it was too "meaty" for my taste.  Even so, it was a nice change from our regular dressing.

Simply put....delicious!  I used a Gala apple instead of the red delicious and think the extra sweetness of it paired nicely with the tartness of the Crasins.

This recipe is totally awesome. This is a keeper and my family loved it. I followed the recipe to the T with recommended suggestions made by others who have perfected it. This recipe is definitely a 5 star or more rating. Its that yummy and smells so good when it's baking in the oven. I have to add to the rest of the good cooks that have already tried it...using fresh seasonings if possible is the best way to go. I had family members calling me up the day after Thanksgiving asking if there was anymore turkey dressing left. I told them everyone ate them all up on Thanksgiving day! but I was making more for Sunday dinner. Thanks again for sharing.

Awesome stuffing!  Prepared recipe as detailed and added (approximately 1/2 cup) more broth and fresh herbs doubled as suggested by other reviewers.   Baked it in the oven and it turned out  amazing.  This will be my "go to" stuffing recipe from now on.

A big success especially with the preparation on the night before.  Next time I’d reduce the sausage to 1/2 pound but otherwise it was great!

So, so good!! Followed the suggestions of others.  Used sage sausage, used double the fresh herbs, used 1 1/2 cups chicken stock, 1/2 cup white wine, used a mixture of different breads for textures.  I used 1 egg I may use a second  when I make it again. My family doesn't love fruit in stuffing so I used a lot less craisins and chopped them up, used half an apple chopped tiny as well.

Very tasty! I baked outside the turkey so added extra liquid as others suggested, but 3 cups was a tad much since there was liquid resting on the bottom of the pan when it was done.  I think if I had stirred it once or twice while baking it would have helped, but taking out 1/2 cup would help too.  Still tasted great and plenty of liquid to keep it moist when reheating in the microwave!

This recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! I used fresh herbs in place of dried. I doubled the amount of fresh herbs. I also did not stuff the bird with the stuffing so I used 2 cups of stock. I placed it in a 9x13 dish and covered it with foil. I cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees stirring half way through. Then I removed the foil and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  This is our new go to stuffing recipe.

I really likes this recipe. My 4 star was from my personal mistakes. Cut back on sausage per a review and found that cutting 1/3 didn't ruin it, but the extra 1/3 might have helped. Same with the apple. Will do again and will stick to the recipe and think it will be better.

I put low sodium Ezekiel bread  I used chicken sausage and took off the casing cause I could not find the ground turkey sausage.  Instead of butter I used coconut oil and I left out the turkey liver  Everything else was added  I made it outside the Turkey in a casserole dish.  I would make it again  Everyone ate it all up .

This stuffing was AMAZING!  And the best part was that it was still amazing even after we substituted gluten-free bread cubes into it so our Celiac daughter could eat it! Due to limited oven space, we used a crock-pot set to low for 4 hours, and it turned out perfect!

Have made this recipe for 3-5 yrs and even my non-fancy husband Loves it in the detriment of his mama's cornbread stuffing. I use spicy italian sausage always, low sage and thyme and fresh rosemary. It stays outside the turkey. A key step is to dry the bread the day/week before. Don't use fresh bread and always use german or home made bread (i make my own in bteadmaker and always use leftover stale bread for drying). I bake for 45 min or 1 hr uncovered and cover if it gets too brown. We love it! Freezes well!

Amazing! Spray pan with Pam, bake covered w foil for 45 minutes, then bake uncovered for approx15 more mins.  Used fresh herbs and white wine as well as chicken stock. The name of this recipe "awesome stuffing" fits!

Going to make couple of adjustments for my 27 lb turkey but sounds fantastic! Using mild ground Italian sausage, lot more bread and adding walnuts n pistachios for texture. Will let know how came out. Also using fresh cranberries, not dried.

I do not like turkey sausage or wheat bread, so I substituted with sage flavored breakfast sausage and a box of jiffy mix corn bread.  I also cooked it in a crock pot for a few hours.  IT WAS AWESOME.

This turned out great! I was asked to make extra stuffing “just in case” there wasn’t enough from the turkey. This stuffing was actually much more flavourful than the stuff that was baked in the turkey! I followed other recommendations re: adding an egg, using fresh herbs and using a lot of stock. I used pork sausages because the supermarket was out of turkey sausages, and it turned out great. Thank you!

Amazing. Turned out great. Try it with spicy Italian sausage meat and get creative with the bread choices. Fresh herbs were key. Cooked outside of the turkey. Used vegetable broth.  And a Granny Smith apple. Yum!

This recipe wasn't bad.  It was decent.  But decent just won't do on thanksgiving or Christmas.  I got varying reviews on this.  Some said they didn't like the sausage in it, others didn't care for the cranberries, and still others didn't enjoy the apple.  I myself didn't care for the apple.  It seems to me this recipe is trying to please a lot of different palates with just one recipe.  In my humble opinion, it didn't.

This was exceptional!  I received compliments from everyone at my Christmas dinner! I did not use the turkey liver and cooked the dressing in a casserole dish instead of in the turkey. I will keep this recipe handy for all of my future turkey dinners!

After 13 years, this is STILL the one and only stuffing recipe that I use and it is perfect everytime!  Substitute figs for the apples and reduce the spices a little; also, continue to stuff it right in the turkey.  Seriously the best stuffing recipe I've found and the only one I use!

I have been making this for a few years now and  everyone loves it, but i do make one very fundamental change... I do not use liver at all and just add more sausage meat and a few rashers of streaky bacon. But I agree with those that say way too much meat, which is why I rate it a four not five. I use about 1 1/2 lb of sausages and a bit of bacon with allthe rest of the ingredients as is. And of course i use olive oil for frying the onion and the drizzle as we are Mediterranean!

Great recipe!  Really tasty, and a big hit with everyone.  I baked it in a glass casserole dish beside the bird for about 45 minutes.  The only change I made to the recipe was to omit the sage as I don't really care for the flavor.  Tasted great as leftovers as well!

I made it using sage sausage and a mix of ciabatta bread and wheat (what I had on hand).  Otherwise I followed the recipe--except I baked it out of the bird.  My family loved it and it stood up to baking much better than our standard dressing recipe.

This WAS amazing. The wife let me know after I put the turkey in no one was bringing stuffing so I ran to acme and bought enough for a double batch. Only thing I did differently was add fresh sage and rosemary. Both pan were cleaned, nothing for left overs.  Huge hit

It was pretty good. I didn't place the  stuffing in the turkey. I used it as a side  dish. A little sweet for us .  I may make it again and make a few changes for our taste. The stuffing was pretty though.

I used fresh herbs as translated by another review.  I used turkey breakfast sausage from the Whole Foods meat counter.  I ended up adding 3 cups more broth and it still came out very dry, but it was tasty enough that gravy can save it.  If I make it again, I will need to discover how to make it more moist.

I had potato bread so used it in place of white bread, probably a little extra. I still used wheat as noted in the recipe.  Following the other reviews, because I was not stuffing a turkey, I mixed 1 egg and 1 cup chicken stock, drizzled over, tossed it, baked 300* for about 30 minutes, tossed it again, baked another 10 minutes.

Only change in would make is not use the fresh herbs. It looks very pretty but I don't like the feel in my mouth. I am just weird like that.

This was really good, I did cook it outside of the turkey like some of the other reviewers. Next time I will add egg as someone suggested to keep everything together, I just forgot to do that at the time. Also I eyeballed how much extra stock to add and it was slightly overly watery, I just didn't want it to dry out. The flavor was awesome, I used fresh herbs (double the amount of dry).

I used a homemade spelt bread, added mushrooms and omitted apple. Raves from the guests.

This turned out amazing!! I too, made it the following day - drizzled some melted butter over the top and covered with Saran Wrap. Make sure you add some more turkey stock half way through cooking. Enjoy!!

Definitely a winner.  We used 2 cups turkey stock I made from boiling and seasoning the giblets which seemed to be a perfect amount for a 9x13 baking dish. Baked outside the turkey  40 min. on 350, uncovered for another 15 min. stirring twice during the baking time. Also be sure to finley chop the fried liver so you don't get an overpowering large  glob in your mouth. Also used ground pork sausage instead of turkey. Anxious to make it again next year.

What a great recipe!  My family loved the mix of flavors and the craisins were my favorite part.  I chose to use Jimmmy Dean's Sage sausage, and will use only half a pound next time I make this as I want to decrease the meatiness somewhat.  I cooked it in a casserole pan, 350 degrees, 35 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered using 1 cup of stock.  As we like it on the dry side with a crunchy top, this was perfect for my family.

I use all recipes all the time and I NEVER leave reviews - however , this dressing is fantastic! I took it to friends-giving and I didn't make enough !! It was gone gone gone !!! Such a great addition to the table and might I add, I HATE recipes with lots of chopping and extra steps- this looks more difficult than it really is! It's easy and sooo good!! A must try!!

Oh my gosh, we loved this dish! I made it exactly according to the recipe, except I added a little more broth at the end to make it more moist. I made our back-up store-bought recipe *just in case* we didn't like it, but that was totally unnecessary- This was delicious! Definitely a keeper for next year's Thanksgiving menu!!

This recipe was delicious! I used one bag of unseasoned pepperidge farm stuffing and one pound hot sausage. I cooked it in a cassserole dish, so it did need a lot more liquid. I used 3 cups chicken stock and one 14 oz can chicken broth. As the other reviews suggested, I baked it at 350 degrees. 20 minutes cover and then 20 minutes uncovered. Toss it a little after removing from the oven and voila- beautiful, super tasty stuffing. Thank you so much for this recipe!

The best stuffing we have ever had! So flavorful! Now a requested must have for the holidays! I have never been a fan of the turkey giblets and whatnot so I did not use it. We also prefer to cook stuffing outside of the turkey. I just added more stock to compensate.

I have made this recipe every year since 2003! Everyone loves it.    I made it for my family that eats plain old stuffing/dressing and they love it. I prep everything the day before so all I have to do is mix everything together and throw it in the oven.  Without question this is on the menu every year. I usually triple or quadruple the recipe so there is leftovers for my husband. The only thing I do different is, I use Italian Sausage and cut back on the rosemary.

Out of this world! I made this for a pot luck at work today and it was devoured! The only changes that I made was to add 1 Granny Smith apple to the red apple, I added chopped pecans, and used fresh herbs. I added more chicken stock because I like my stuffing a little moister. It was DELICIOUS and I look forward to making it for TDay next week (using apricots).

SOO delicious. I made this for the first time a few years ago and my 10 year old niece LOVED it. We had plenty leftover but she decided to take the rest home with her! I will be making this again this year. It's becoming a staple for my thanksgiving menu!!!!

This stuffing recipe is AMAZING. I double herbs because I use fresh.  I also used, and highly recommend mild Italian sausage instead of turkey for that added flavour.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 2.5 hours and required 3 cups chicken stock.  I don't have a medium setting so cooked on high first half then low the rest. This is going to be my go-to stuffing from now on.
***added note-I"ve made this many times now and it's always a hit.  I've also cooked this in a casserole dish at 350, covered with foil for 40 mins then uncovered for 15 mins.

I make this every thanksgiving and christmas for my family and friends. We deep fry our turkey in the driveway so I make this is a big casserole dish in the oven and it's very good. I don't even eat stuffing (until now). You can add more or less stock to make it softer or crunchier depending on your preference.  I've made it both ways and it's all a matter of preference. Make it once with cooked chopped bacon in it too, delish!
I omit the liver, cuz,, why bother. and I have made it with and without the craisins. and any kind of apple will do, but the crisper the better, no soft apples.

I've made this for several years now. One year I thought I would try a different recipe and the family wasn't happy so I've gone back to this one. Definitely a keeper! It's a lot of sausage in this recipe so make sure you use a sausage that you like. It is a very hearty recipe so if you want less sausage, more bread then feel free to do so, it would still be delicious. Also as in any recipe that uses bread, using a good, or preferably home-made bread makes it so much better! Yum!

Edited to add that I've used both liver and no liver. The family didn't notice either way so I tend to skip it now. ;)

I've been making this for years now!  I don't use it to stuff turkey, just put it in a separate casserole dish.  Extra stock  is needed to make it more moist when it's not stuffed in the turkey.  I use sage sausage only for meat, and 1/2 what's called for (original recipe just has too much meat and not enough bread).  ALWAYS use fresh herbs and double the amount when using fresh!  Fresh herbs make a huge difference!  I also throw in dried cherries along with the dried cranberries.  Best stuffing I've ever had, my family can't wait for special occasions so Mom will break out the stuffing!  YUM!!

Yum!! I used gluten free bread to suit dietary restrictions. You can't find boxed gluten free stuffing anywhere and it sucks to have to miss out on stuffing. The stock made it moist and you couldn't tell the difference. Even non gluten free people loved it. I left out the liver, used chicken stock as I couldn't find turkey, and threw in a handful of raisins as well. I baked it in a buttered baking dish at 350 for about an hour, so I didn't toast the bread cubes first. Stir it up halfway thru and be sure to cover it with foil so it won't dry out. You can take the foil off for the last ten mins or so just to give it a little bit of crisp on top if you want. The smell of it was delish. Next time I may try adding a beaten egg to help keep it all together. I will definitely be making this again next year. Thank you!

Delicious and everyone loved it, even the picky eaters. I used one bag of Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing and added some turkey gravy to moisten a little more.

Allrecipes is turning me into quite the chef thanks to recipes like this.  I stuff the turkey with this because it's too difficult for me to multitask and time everything just right to be ready at the same time.

It's hard to find turkey stock anywhere so I use chicken and haven't received complaints.  My family loves this and it's a big family with a lot of different tastes and opinions.  They're surprised and amazed I can cook without giving everyone food poisoning but if you follow the recipe as stated you'll get perfect stuffing everytime.  

I have made it with both fresh herbs and dry and fresh gives more aroma but really, unless everyone is watching you and they have restaurant critic taste buds, give yourself a break and use whatever is handy!

This was great.  I omitted the liver.  I used sage pork sausage (Bob Evans).  I cooked and mixed everything the night before, except for the turkey stock.  I added the turkey stock the morning of, then just microwaved it (I did not stuff the turkey with it).  It was a hit at Christmas.  I will definitely make this again.

It was a huge success.   The turkey turned out just perfect, and the stuffing  had the right sweet, tangy, salty taste.  Will do this again.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's family for Christmas dinner, having never made dressing/stuffing before and never having liked it before.  EVERYONE who tried it RAVED about it, had seconds, and asked for leftovers to take home.  It was a huge success.

We did not include the liver and adjusted the recipe slightly to make it in the slow cooker.

I would highly recommend making this recipe.  It is really flavourful and easy to make.

I've been making this recipe for a number of years now and every year my kids ask to make sure that I do.  I make it exactly as is except that I add 1/2 cup more stock because I do not stuff my bird.  It is a wonderful "make ahead" recipe that  can be assembled and kept in the fridge the night before being sure to reserve all the liquid until the next day just before popping it in the oven. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this stuffing for the past couple years and it's become the new favorite in my family.   We still love traditional stuffing, but seeing as we eat a traditional dinner in a few homes over the course of the holidays, I feel this one is the right one for us to serve up.  Enjoy!

I only made it once, as a trial run.  I decreased quantity to 5 and I know that makes a huge difference and could be the reason it wasn't 5 stars.  I cooked it outside the turkey and couldn't find, in any of the hints, the temp and time for doing that.  Also, I prepared it a day ahead.  When do I add the egg?  I tried to do it with the stock and butter and it was difficult to get it mixed into the other ingredients.  More than one egg?     Like everyone else, I added a lot of stock.  Taste was great.  I just had some issues with consistency and I overcooked it a little.  I'm not a great cook and would be grateful for help with some things that are probably obvious to others.

Ohhhhhh! This is soooo goooood!I used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage. I used fresh rosemary, thyme, & parsley. At first I thought I wouldn't use sage because I was using sage sausage, but then I changed my mind & added some powdered sage I had in the pantry. I'm glad I did, because this dish turned out so delicious! I followed the advice of another commenter, who suggested that we use 1 1/2 teaspoons of both rosemary & thyme, & just over 2 cups of parsley. I used 5 teaspoons of powdered sage. I think that may have been a little too much, because it seemed salty (but it was still divine!) - next time I will use less.

My 93 year old mom said this was the best stuffing she had ever had!!!  Used a whole bag of sage flavored bread cubes and plain pork sausage.  Used one small can of broth and a cup of juice taken from turkey while it baked.  Baked in separate pan covered with foil.  It was perfectly moist and not too much of anything.

This was so good! My mom said it's a new tradition and it was easy enough that even I couldn't screw this up! I made it in the morning, leaving out the broth until I was ready to heat it up. It made it much easier to coordinate everything at the last minute. It was absolutely the best stuffing ever!

I loved making this recipe almost as much as the family enjoyed eating it.  It calls for more liquid (chicken stock) than I like, but I just added more breadcrumbs.  I also threw in some of my own preferred ingredients - golden raisins and walnuts, for instance, and used half of the mix to stuff a 20 lb. bird, and still had plenty to cook outside the bird in a casserole dish.  With all the leftovers, I've made "stuffin muffins" and a variety of other lovely leftover lunches.  Highly recommended.

Amazing!!  I sub in 4-5 leeks for the onion and use fresh herbs (doubled) instead of dried - both make a HUGE difference in the taste.  With the substitutions this recipe is pretty labor intensive so I usually prep anything needing chopping a day in advance.  I skip the liver since I personally find the taste revolting and I use the best, freshest sausage I can find.  I've been making this stuffing for several years now and my family clamors for it every time!

This has become a staple in my house for Thanksgiving.  I've found myself year after year searching for the recipe, and this one is the closest to the one I was given the first year that I made it.  A few things that I've adjusted:  1 granny smith apple, one pear, and tossing in about 1/2 of a cup of fresh cranberries really gives the flavor an added depth that is just delicious.  I always use only sourdough bread-- a favorite in my house-- and I use fresh herbs, following the ratios in this recipe but adjusting for personal taste.  Friends and family agree-- best stuffing ever.

A few other adjustments that I make personally, based on my preference (the recipe itself is awesome, but I prefer using some of my own "tricks" to make it perfect for my taste):

Add more broth
Use Bob Evans brand or Jimmy Dean sausage
bake stuffing in a dutch oven (gives flavors a chance to meld, and makes it more like stuffing that came out of the turkey)
Add some all purpose seasoning to the bread, such as Adobo

This recipe is phenomenal-- If you're unsure whether or not you'll like it or you don't quite trust your cooking/baking talents yet... Give it a try-- Super easy, and you definitly won't be disappointed!

Oh my! This stuffing was the biggest hit on Thanksgiving 2015. My family is not one to do traditional recipes. I told them to trust me in this recipe and idea. It was a hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe! It seemed like it was going to be unsalty at first but with the combination of the turkey juices dripping in it since I stuffed my 14 pound turkey with it, it was delicious! My grandma even loved it and she is a hard woman to please with American recipes. Thank you for sharing!

Made this for Thanksgiving, when I couldn't find my favorite Thanksgiving stuffing recipe.  So glad, because now I have a new favorite!  This was perfect,  followed recipe, but I did substitute fresh  herbs (double the recipe for fresh) and cooked in the slow cooker as I didn't want to stuff the turkey, but I wanted a moist dressing.  It came out perfectly!  I simply put the stuffing together, added a bit of the stock and put in slow cooker on high for 45 minutes and low for 2 hours.  After about an hour, I stirred the stuffing and added a bit more stock. I have found  checking and adding stock to reach  your desired consistency in best. It was a very flavorful and easy dish.

I did make some changes to this recipe using  some suggestions from other reviews as well as some of my own substitutions and absolutely loved the results!   I used a bagged sourdough dressing/stuffing mix, pork sausage, omitted the rosemary (not a big fan ),  used fresh sage and thyme, used dried parsley (stores were out of fresh), omitted the turkey livers and added about 2.5 cups of chicken broth since I baked it separately in dish. I stirred it to moisten the top bread cubes after baking at 350 F for 45 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. My kids didn't care for the cranberries but everyone else loved it. I will definitely be making this again and might try adding an egg or two to bind/moisten it more (was planning to this time but forgot).

This is the best stuffing I ever had.  I took one of the other reviewers advice and added a beaten egg.  I doubled the recipe and my friends fought over who was going to take it home.  The very best ever!!

Believe the hype! We couldn't find any turkey sausage on short notice, so made it without. I put in both the turkey liver and heart, left over from Awesome Turkey Stock, finely chopped. Used fresh cranberries, plus raisins. I also added an egg, as many suggested, and put in about a cup and a half of turkey stock and baked in a dish at 350 for about 45 minutes, uncovering for the last 15.

I've never made stuffing, but wanted to try my hand at it for my boyfriend's family's gathering.  Boyfriend told me on the way up, "I didn't mention this before, but I'm really not a stuffing fan.  Sorry, babe."  Well, of course I made him try it, and he LOVED IT!  They all did!!  It was such a hit, I went home and made it again for my family's gathering tomorrow.  
---
I followed the recipe, except I omitted the turkey liver and substituted turkey stock for chicken stock (we had ham) and  used all fresh herbs except for the sage (it was sold out citywide!!) so I used dried rubbed sage instead.  Added the extra cup of stock which would've been sorely missed.  I used a very thick, hearty whole wheat bread (sliced) and a sourdough baguette for the white which made it less mushy.

I have made this as a stuffing and as a dressing. If you follow the advice of the reviewers and double the stock when you use it as a dressing you can't POSSIBLY go wrong. I also use fresh herbs and maple sausage which combines with the sweetness of the apple. Everyone I have made this for LOVES IT

I made this 3 years ago and the relatives ask for it every year now.  I don't change anything except leave out the liver and I don't put it in the bird.  I just bake in a casserole dish for about 30-45 minutes at 350.

Great recipe!  We love this dressing but Its easy to over season this recipe.  Between the sage sausage, fresh herbs, seasoned bread crumbs...It can add up to too much seasoning.  This year I am using plain bread crumbs and dried seasons.

I also didn't stuff it in the turkey since I was not making the turkey! My husband LOVES this stuffing. You do have to add a lot more broth when not stuffing, but that is to be expected. I loved the apple/sausage combination.

I made this exactly as written a few weeks before Thanksgiving as a trial run. Am so glad I did as it didn't taste right and would have been a diaster had I served this on Thanksgiving. It was too much of meat dish to be classified as stuffing and think it would be good as a main dish casserole. Maybe I'm just too used to southern style cornbread dressing with my turkey.  I'll probably make again as a casserole for the family but not with turkey and fixings.

Incredible! I have been making this for years and over time have made a few substitutions.  I use Italian Sausage so add additional sage.  Always use ALL fresh herbs.  I sometimes add sautéed fresh mushrooms. Granny Smith Apples.  I make it in a crocks pot vs in the turkey. Always a hit!

I have made the stuffing for years now. The only changes that I made where I don't use the turkey giblets and I use Italian sausage instead of turkey sausage. Sometimes it's turkey Italian sausage. It's so delicious. The combinations of the cranberries, Apple, sausage and stuffing and the spices are just absolutely amazing.

I love this recipe and so does my family, but none of us are 
Very liver friendly!

Very good but, I did tweak it a bit more to my liking. Substituted Jimmy Dean Sausage for turkey sausage, corn bread for the wheat bread,  and used fresh herbs.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except added some garlic when frying the sausage.  The stuffing turned out better than expected.  The sausage gives it a very rich quality.

I love this recipe, I make it each Christmas and thanksgiving. I now live in Europe and I'm always very proud to serve this stuffing to my guests, who are not always accustomed to a turkey dinner. They often think this a boring dry meal, when this is on the table, their opinions change quickly! Always a hit! I've made no modifications to it, just the type of sausage depending on what's available around me.

I've been making this stuffing for years now and LOVE IT! I always prep the day before Thanksgiving which makes it a breeze to put together in the mayhem. I use a crusty sourdough and Dave's Killer Bread (Good Seed). I cook the sage sausage, celery and onions and then add the apples, fresh herbs and cranberries and refrigerate the mixture over night. The flavors combine and in the morning, just combine with your bread cubes, stock and butter. DELISH!

I used 1/2 lb of ground bacon & 1/2 lb of ground chicken instead of sausage.  I cooked ground bacon a bit, then added the onion, cooked it a bit more then added the chicken.  I used 1/2 cup of tart dried cherries & 1/2 cup of tart dried apricots chopped.  I chopped gala apple and  a little more broth.  I used the rest of the ingredients and put it all together the day before, then baked it separately in the oven for about an hour.  It was a huge hit with everyone.

I've been making this every Christmas for four years now. It's always a HUGE hit regardless whether I use turkey or pork sausage or different types of bread. This is an EXCELLENT stuffing recipe. I bake it outside the bird in a 9"x13" pan and add about 3 cups of stock. Bake at 350 for 40 min covered then 15 min uncovered. Enjoy!

This was an excellent receipe.  I substituted the whole wheat bread with sour dough bread cubed and toasted in the oven and also used fresh italian sausage in place of the ground turkey sausage. I also added sautéed mushrooms.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing.

Wow--this recipe was great--read lots of reviews. Left out the liver,made the night before, left in crockpot covered with plastic wrap.  In the am added the turkey stock( I used chicken stock) and melted butter. Turned crockpot on low--3.5 hours later dinner was ready and it was perfect--have been eating leftovers and they are terrific!

So deliciious! Nothing but compliments from everyone and even one from someone who usually doesn't eat stuffing. Made this just as the recipe called for. I did however throw all the ingredients, except broth and butter, together the night before. Thanks for a great stuffing.

Was I the only one who thought this didn't call for enough bread?  It was flavorful, but seemed to consist of more sausage and cranberries than bread, which is not what I think of when I think of stuffing.  When I was making it, I thought it seemed like it needed more bread, but followed the recipe.  I should have followed my instinct and added another cup or two.  Again though, it had pretty good flavor ;)

I made this to accompany the rosemary roasted turkey and it was a hit with my guests, every last bit was cleaned up. It's not really my thing but I'm never much a stuffing fan anyway, but for people who love stuffing, definitely try this out, the herbed meat and the tangy cranberries and apple makes it something special.

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving. Way to much sausage and to much seasoning while not nearly enough bread or broth. The only positive was what little I could taste of the cranberries, apple and bread made a great combination.

Great all time delicious stuffing recipe.  Didn't add sausage but rest of  ingredients per recipe were good.  I probably quadrupled this as I had a lot of bread cubes I had dried.  A lot of hungry people without a thanksgiving meal yesterday will enjoy this today.  Can't go wrong with this stuffing. Yum.

Although this seemed like a lot of ingredients and steps, I was ready for something different.  I took a short cut using a large bag of seasoned mixed bread cubes, but still added the fresh herbs.  I prepared the day before and refrigerated.  Before baking I drizzled with chicken broth and began baking covered with tin foil.  For the last half of the baking I uncovered. This was a smash hit!  The only disappointment is that I had so little left over!!  Next time I will double the amount using muffin tins for the additional volume, bake and then freeze in freezer bags.

When I took my first bite, I thought yuk! I was sooooo disappointed then I took another and another and the flavors started to kick in and oh boy was I in heaven. I added a little more cranberries than called for and chopped up a granny smith apple. I used fresh herbs, doubling the amount and utilized a good amount of chicken stock. I stirred the mixture occasionally while cooking and after 40 minutes covered at 350, I removed the covering and cooked for an additional 15 minutes. I used the spiciest turkey sausage I could find and added a little sage turkey sausage. Everyone thought this stuffing was quite tasty and did not notice spiciness. I made another batch of traditional stuffing just in case this didn't turn out well. I used the same sausage and Pepperidge Farms seasoned and cornbread stuffing in a bag. The consensus was the traditional stuffing was much spicier but still quite good. When it came time to take a plate home I hid my sausage/apple/cranberry stuffing and dished out the traditional lol. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was phenomenal! I used sourdough bread and pork sausage with fresh herbs. I didn't stuff it in the turkey, and it turned out as fantastic as I had hoped! Not too soggy, not too dry!

Everyone loved this stuffing. Definitely a do again. Even the younger ones said they loved it. My changes: 
1 switched 2 TBL poultry seasoning for the Sage, Rosemary and Thyme  
2 switched 1 TBL dry parsley for the fresh parsley 
3 instead sourdough bread for white bread
4 cooked it in the slow cooker instead of in the turkey
5 used Granny Smith apples instead of golden delicious. 
Yummy yum!

I've made this as is and it wasn't very good.  - I'd give it 2 stars (too much of a bad sausage taste, the liver was just a bad idea to begin with and the apples made it too tart combined with the cranberries) but I thought it had a good thought process behind it.  So the next time I made it I used Jimmy Dean sage breakfast sausage, took out the apples and liver, used a little less cranberries, added a small can of drained chopped mushrooms and a bunch of chopped pecans.  Maybe I changed it too drastically to actually rate the second version as this version, but the second version I thought was way better - especially with the breakfast sausage.  But I've always used recipes more as a guide than as written in stone.

First time trying this recipe, but I ended up kicking it up a notch by using a mixture of green onion sausage and ground pork sausage.  All other ingredients were pretty much kept the same! Some ingredients (like the seasonings: onion celery, garlic) were adjusted for personal tastes)! The dressing turned out AWESOME! I was hesitant, at first, adding the apples,  despite all the favorable reviews, but I'm glad I did. It's the flavorful combination of the sausage, cranberries, and the apples that will absolutely drive your tastebuds insane, and your guests coming back for more!!

Everyone LOVED this stuffing. I used sourdough bread and turkey sausage. It is almost a meal in itself, but that didn't stop us! I have never gotten compliments on stuffing before because I made it more for tradition and not because I liked it and it was usually out of a box. This totally worth the extra work...you will not be disappointed.

Fantastic. I got rave reviews from everyone. I had to make do with what I had though, so I substituted extra fresh parsley for the thyme and used potato bread crusts instead of the other bread types. I'm sure it would have tasted even more fantastic if done correctly though

Wasn't sure, as I don't like cranberries, but this was absolutely wonderful!!!  I saw that someone made everything except the liquids up the day before, which was great since I wanted to get as much done as I could the day before. Just add stock the next day and throw it in the oven! Got rave reviews from the boyfriend too.  =)

Best stuffing I've ever had says the husband so this was a real winner at the thanksgiving table this year. I added a lil bit more sausage though, Chinese sausage called lup cheong which is sorta on the sweet side. If you have a meat loving sausage hugging family I'd recommend adding more meat to your liking. And I add cornbread also on this site. The stock is what makes it so be sure it’s got good flavor

It was fantastic! I made it almost exactly as written.  The only change I made was the kind of sausage I used.  It probably could have used a little more seasoning but that could have been because of the sausage I used.  Jimmy Dean original.

We made this as a separate dish using a slow-cooker for Thanksgiving.  The flavors were great and the variety of fruit was appreciated.  It was a nice change, but (to me) it just wasn't "all that" like many other reviews have claimed.  Our guests praised it and took home left-overs, so it was definitely worth trying!

I've made this for the last 4 thanksgivings, so I figure it's about time to give it the 5 star rating it deserves. The sausage is always a big hit!

Very good. We added sausage for more great flavor and more liquid. Chop the sausage finely. Will definitely make again.

Loved this stuffing!  I used really good bread but didn't have quite enough so added a little bagged stuffing crumbs.  I also used pork sausage as that is my preference and next time think I'll use a spicier version.  It was moist but didn't really hold together.  I cut my bread into large chunks so will cut it smaller next time and add a little more liquid.  But I will make it again.  Absolutely delicious!

Phenomenal!  I doubled this and it was great although next time I double I'll use fewer cranberries in the double batch.  Even so, it was a hit and will be my new go-to for stuffing!  Delish!

I prepared the stuffing separately and took the suggestion of adding more broth. Well, I think 2 cups of broth was a bit too much :) It still had great flavor though.

I am lookin for a simple cornbread dressing that my momma fixed and she was just a self taught cook but it sure was good. She made the dressing every Thanksgiving until she died.
she would make her corn bread the day before. celery, a little sage onion and a couple of eggs, and I believe that was all. I won't change her recipe, if it was good enough for her and all us kids then it's good enough now. Happy Thanksgiving to each and everyone.

I only gave this 3 stars since while it was good, I wasn't as wild as I thought I would be about the apples in it. Also for those who use their stuffing in soup after TG (like I do) I think its better to choose a non-fruit variation.

Delicious!  Just the right amount of savory with a little sweet.  I used packaged, unseasoned croutons to save time.  I did use a bit more chicken broth than the recipe called for.  Everyone loved it...really delicious.  Even my husband that hates apples!

My family enjoyed this stuffing very much. Although I'm not a big fan of stuffing in general, this recipe grew on me alittle bit more with every bite. Next year, I think I'll substitute the white and wheat bread for cornbread entirely.

Very tasy stuffing! I decided, with some hesitation, to stray from my usual favorite recipe that belonged to my mom. This recipe was easy to make and flavorful without being over-the-top. I did reduce the amount of cranberries, since we were also having a salad with cranberries in it and I didn't want too much of a good thing. The stufing was great and everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe. This may become our new holiday stuffing recipe!

I had so many requests for this recipe during my Thanksgiving party!   I only made 2 changes....added a raw egg & used Pepp Farm stuffing mix instead of cubing up the bread....I was in a jam.  I also stuffed it in the turkey...so 3!  This will be a holiday staple now.

Followed the recipe and added suggestions like cracking an egg and doubled the broth; was also liberal with the seasoning. I used chicken apple sausage instead of turkey sausage and overall it was delicious!

This was an amazing success!  Everyone loved it.  My daughter-in-law from Korea couldn't get enough of this.  Asked for the recipe. I used a bag of brown berry stuffing (sage and onion)instead of the bread.  Used sage pork sausage. 2 cups of turkey stock. Also, used the extra egg. I mixed everything and then covered with foil - didn't put in the oven for 4 hours.  Fabulous.  Great to make ahead.

Next time I will not use as much liver.  Overall, the stuffing turned out very good.

I do a bone-in turkey breast. No liver, so I added 1 cup sauteed crimini mushrooms and 1/3 cup walnut pieces. Stuffed the breast cavity of the brined turkey breast and slow roasted in oven. This is fanatastic stuffing!

YUM YUM YUM

I used a mix of seasoned premade crumbs and non-seasoned crumbs i made in the oven and therefore used slightly less in the seasoning department, but the stuffing was packed with flavor.  I used delicious Jimmy Dean sage sausage.  I added an egg and a cup of broth (very moist; I might use a 1/4 less next time).  I used regular cranberries (slightly reduced the amount) and added a splash of craisins.   I put foil over the stuffing and cooked for 30 minutes.  Stirred.  Cooked 15 minutes more.  Stirred and took off the foil.  Cooked 15 minutes more.  So delicious; thanks for making me Chef-like!!

Good stuffing. I used all FRESH herbs and upped them a bit. Used sourdough bread and my only meat was 1 lb hot Italian sausage. As others have stated, you'll need more stock. I probably used 2 or 2.5 cups. I didn't measure just poured it on until the bread was moist. I stuffed the bird with it and baked the remainder in a casserole dish. Delicious both ways!

This is the best homemade stuffing I've had. I used granny smith apples (2), doubled the herbs and butter, as much chicken stock til it was moist, polish sausage, and sourdough bread. I will be making this every year from now on!

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck at work. I used an entire [large] loaf of whole wheat bread, because it is what I had. I added extra bread that what is called for, because the meat/bread ratio seems a bit off for stuffing. I used turkey sausage [italian] as suggested. For something a bit more traditional, this could be omitted. I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but I have to say this stuffing is pretty good!

If I made this again, I would add cornbread cubes, less meat, and less sage. 

For those of you who want to make this in a pan instead of stuffed in a turkey: [for the changes I made, using more bread cubes] I added a total of 2.5 cups of chicken stock to the pan once I had all the ingredients in. Baked covered for 30 minutes and about 15-20 minutes uncovered. Keep checking it after you uncover it. I stirred it up 1/2 way through the uncovered cooking process.] Spoon it into a serving dish, and voila!

Just made this yesterday for a pre thanksgiving work dinner and it was delicious!! At first I was a little hesitant but once I tried it it was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I used some spicy turkey sausage for an extra kick and some mild. I put it in the oven for 45 minutes covered. I also used some undated and some salted chicken stock to guarantee it would not be salty and added extra to make sure it was not dry. I also reduced the onion a bit, I made this for 30 servings, it took me about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish. I never liked stuffing or dressing before because I tried before the ones with cornbread but this was delish!  Definetly recommended and will be making it again!

I really enjoyed the fruit in this! I did omit the meat and I cut back on the sage A LOT! I'm not to much a sage person. I like the fresh tartness of the cranberries and apples. I did this a few years ago and every one enjoyed it but felt as though the sage was to much, so I changed a little bit and everyone LOVED it!!

I make this every year. It's the best part of thanksgiving dinner.
I don't change it much because it's awesome just the way it's written. I use chicken stock instead of turkey and omit the sage (it's not our thing) and I add a few fresh cranberries too. So worth it.

A vivid, beautiful stuffing!  I did however, improvise. I made a recipe and a half but used 1lb. of sausage, all fresh herbs and more stock and butter than the recipe called for to ensure that it would come out moist. I also highly recommend using sage sausage to keep the flavors consistent. I also had to improvise the baking because I didn't use it in the turkey. I baked it covered, at 350 for 20 minutes then took the cover off for 5. I will surely make it again.

This is soooooo good, even cold, which sounds gross, but it wasn't!  My boys loved it and they are very picky!  I didnt use the parsley, liver (wwww) or turckey stock (I used chicken stock instead)  I couldnt find the cranberries, they were out so I got dried cherries, which were yummy!!!  This will be a staple to our Thanksgiving dinner.... :)  Thank you!!!  :)

My family wasn't wild about stuffing until I found this recipe 9 years ago. Now everyone requests it including my kids spouses! I made a few modifications over the years. I use maple sausage and store bought unseasoned cornbread stuffing. I also add pecans pieces (or bits - whichever is handy) for a little bit of a different texture. My family doesn't like the liver in it so I do leave that out. I use plenty of liquid to keep it moist. I also always make extra since somebody always wants to take some home.

Everyone has loved this recipe with a few changes that others have also recommended. I use craisons instead of dried cranberries, I leave out the turkey liver due to picky eaters in the family, add an egg, and add more stock than it calls for & some wine. I also use seasoned pork sausage. I used the package stuffing bread crumbs, and it was still amazing!.

Just tried the stuffing tonight, nothing but complaints -- I didn't make enough for third helpings!  Wonderfully easy and straight forward.  I did use bacon instead of of the sausage, and I preferred the sausage, but bacon worked well too.  The stuffing came out perfectly in the bird, not mushy, just right texture.   Will be doing this one for every holiday stuffing from now on.

Really delicious stuffing! I changed a few things in that I did not add any liver (ewww) and I just used store bread stuffing (plain). The family loved it, I cooked in a pan until a nice crust formed over the top and it was sooooo good. I will make this again and again!

very good, instead of using turkey sausage, I just cooked onions and celery in canola oil and then warmed up leftover turkey and mixed it with the stuffing mixture.

Delicious. I made this for my first thanks giving dinner in my own home and trumped all the stffing I've ever had. Everyone was quite impressed. I doubled te fruit the second time however and will do so from now on. Also, a local market had chicken apple brots and I de-cased those and used them instead and I think that worked out wonderfully. I liked this recipe as a dressing instead of a stuffing.

Made this for Thanksgiving....was a hit.  Everyone loved it so much they requested it for Christmas as well.  I am a 'dump' cook which basically means i add and taste as i go.  so i used this receipe as a base.  i used more whole wheat than white bread.  i used the fresh herbs in combo w/dried herbs and i added a box of stove top stuffing w/ cranberries.  yeah, i was 'dumpin' the whole way!!!  Great Great receipe!!

This was my 2nd year making this for Turkey day. Both times it came out excellent and both times I did not have left overs. This stuffing is excellent and I would not change a thing about it.

The only stuffing I'll ever make again.   Doubled the recipe.   I did use storebought preseasoned stuffing bread (however I still added the amount of spices indicated in the recipe and didn't reduce them) and used Craisins (original flavour).   Could not find a plain turkey sausage (didn't think honey garlic would go well) so I used hot italian pork sausage....Jimmy Dean isn't available here, must be a USA brand.    Left everything else as the recipe states.  Wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have used this recipe for several years now. People who normally don't like stuffing love this. I always use the lowfat Jimmy Deans sausage with sage instead of the turkey sauseage, but everything else is followed exact!

This was yummy but I have to work on the consistency.  I used it as a dressing/side dish so it was not cooked inside the turkey and since I make it with a breast, I didn't have the liver so that was not included. It was tasty although with the chopping/sauteing, how is the prep time only 15 mins?  That's not accurate at all!  Had to add more stock due to not stuffing.  I'll make this again!

This was AWESOME! I am not a good cook and wanted to make something tasty and different for my Christmas meal. I followed this almost exactly. I left out the cranberries. Used half pork italian sausage and half chicken-apple sausage with wheat bread and sourdough. I added more broth to make it a little more moist and all fresh herbs and it was great! I will make this again!

Amazing dish & a nice change to the regular stuffing. This makes way more than 10 servings. I ended up with 2 large Pyrex dishes plus a smaller round dish of stuffing.

Everyone at Christmas dinner said they loved this even though I wasn't too impressed.  I used spicy turkey sausage but I think I'll try to find sage flavored sausage next time.  It was better the next day in my turkey sandwich.  If you don't have day old bread, just buy croutons and it would work the same and probably would be easier by skipping that first step.  Roughly chop the apples as I diced and thought the taste of the apples was lost.  Craisins were a great addition.  Bon appetite!

Very good.   I couldn't find Jimmy Dean Sausage here, so I made my own meat using ground turkey and added some spices to it.  I ended up making the stuffing the night before, kept in the fridge and then put in the oven in it's own casserole dish when it was time.   Very moist - I didn't take the lid off and next time I will so that it browns more - but it was a hit regardless!!

I'm giving 2 stars for presentation. I didn't really care for this dish at all. Everyone at our Christmas dinner had a serving, but no one went back for seconds. Disappointed, because I tried the recipe due to the number of 5 star ratings.

I omitted the liver and made this with a vegetarian sausage and vegetable broth. (I increased the broth, because I read reviews of it being dry.) It went over very well with all my meat eating inlaws. I made this a second time without the sausage and it too went over very, very well. Of course I'm sure my version is nothing compared to the real thing with actual turkey sausage.

This was really delicious. I couldn't find sage turkey sausage so I used sage pork sausage. I also used some fresh herbs and unseasoned stuffing (pre-dried bread) I cooked it on it's own in a casserole dish until the edges got a little crispy. I now have to make the stuffing every year.

I grew up eating cornbread dressing and for years now been sticking with the same dressing which is great.I figured I'd try something different and decided to try this.It was only ok to me,most of my family didn't really care for it either.If you really like the taste of sausage it would be great but it seemed to me a little over bearing to me.Thanks for the recipe anyways,I did at least try it.

This was the first time I made stuffing from scratch.  This receipe was very easy.  It didn't stuff the Turkey but made it on the stove top and it was a huge hit with my very finicky mother!  I have been instructed by my whole family to keep the receipe and make it again!

Very good stuffing, if you like your stuffing a little on the sweet side.  Made this for my family on Thanksgiving and they all missed the traditional old fashioned stuffing I usually make for the holidays.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This recipe is TO DIE FOR!!  I was hesitant as I usually don't like sweet with my savory, but these flavors mixed so well and everyone at my Thanksgiving meal agreed that it was the favored dish of the night.  I used 1/2 homemade cornbread and 1/2 sourdough for the bread and used fresh herbs!  Ahhhh...the aromas are so delightful!  I also made it ahead the night before reserving the stock to drizzle on right before baking.  It came out beautifully!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe and use it every year for Thanksgiving as it was a hit!

We've had this for Thanksgiving two years in a row now. Before it I wasn't much of a stuffing person, but I can't get enough of this! Awesome recipe.

I loved the savory mixed with sweet and tart and the sausage gave it a little kick.  I do love corndbread and made a batch and crumbled it in with the toasted bread.  Yum

I served this stuffing to my family this year and it was the hit of the meal.  It is one recipe that I will never lose track of and it more than likely will get used more than just at Thanksgiving.

I used a Granny Smith apple and a bag of soft potato bread stuffing-extra liquid absolutely not necessary-you can always add more later, but you can't take away! This was delicious with Jimmy Dean sage sausage and extra spices. It makes for a very attractive dish.

I followed some other recommendations and used all fresh herbs, extra broth, skipped the liver and 2 eggs to bind. I made it the night before and then baked it at 350 for about an hour, mixing once.  This was a delicious recipe and my guests commented that it was more like a side-dish than stuffing. The flvors were awesome, I just wish it were a little more bound together instead of crumbly.

Followed the exact recipe minus the turkey liver. Assembled all the dry ingredients in a large bowl beforehand and refrigerated. Later, transferred mixture to a large corningware dish, added butter and broth and placed in oven. Cooked 30 minutes, then stirred and drizzled an X of chicken broth on top. Cooked for 20 more minutes.  Easy to make and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again!

This was a big hit! I bought smoked turkey sausage instead of the ground (couldn't find ground turkey)- I think I'll use about half the meat next time - it was too much for me. I may double the apples too or try Granny Smith per a previous suggestion. This was super easy and quick...and delicious! It smelled great while it was baking too!

Best stuffing I've ever made!  I used sage pork sausage, premade sage bread cubes (so cut down sage seasoning) and used the turkey inerds.  I don't know if I'll put in cranberries next time, but only had fresh so may have been too much of a bite.  But will be on my regular stuffing rotation as my 4 yr old asks for stuffing all of the time and it's nearly as easy as box mix.

AMAZING!!! I used Sage Sausage and Sourdough bread-- skipped the liver, and added more stock since I baked it separately. I think next time I'll add 1- 1 1/2 cups more of extra bread since I love the crunchy texture in my stuffing. Baked 350 uncovered for 1 hour (stir half way through). I will be making this every year for Thanksgiving!! Thank you! :)

Excellent! I found Sage Sausage and loved it. I believe Hormel or Jimmy Dean brand. Remember-when using fresh herbs to double the amount for the full flavor. I also followed other suggestions and used sourdough; nummy! I baked mine in the oven for 30 min covered, stirring once and then uncovered for 15 min. It would have needed more time, but we transferred it to a slow cooker on "high" for the next 1 1/2 hours till we were ready to eat. It was great. Not too dry; not too sweet; perfection!

This was the first time I made homemade stuff.  It was so good, I won't be going back to stove top.  I used homemade white and rye breads.  I doubled the amount of bread so we'd have leftovers.

I served this for Thanksgiving and everyone in our group of 13 loved it.  I left out the cranberries and used stove top stuffing mix, but I did use fresh herbs.  The crunch from the nuts and the tart sweetness from the apples will make this a Thanksgiving repeat from now on.  I think I will use more apples next time.

it was good, but very busy. I ike stuffing to be more savory and this was pretty fruity. It wasn't bad, just different. Got plenty of complements on it too. The only change I made was to omit the celery, and add some nuts instead. I will probably not add nuts next time. One other reviewer mentioned preassembing the stuffing the night before. That worked well by only assembling the dry items and adding the wet ingredients right before putting it into the oven. 350 for 1 hour seems to work well if cooking it separately from the turkey. Be prepared to add extra stock if it seems like it needs it during the cooking. I covered mine, which helped to reserve liquids while cooking and uncovered it for the last 15 min. DON'T SKIP THE SAUSAGE (it adds savory flavor) and try to find the flavored sausage, too. I used fresh herbs, and likely will again. Be sure to double the amount for fresh herbs. I will likely make it again, thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC stuffing!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand.  I used sourdough bread, fresh herbs, chicken stock, and omitted the liver.  Based on other reviews I added a little extra stock for moisture.  Someone else recommended adding an egg if not cooking it in the turkey.  I may try that next time just to hold the ingredients together better.  Otherwise, the flavor was phenominal and others asked for the recipe.

This is the second year I've made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, and both times it got RAVE reviews.  I used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage, so it's more savory than regular breakfast sausage.  I'm making this stuffing every year from now on.

This stuffing was BEYOND fantastic! The only bummer was I only had a tiny bit of craisins :o( I also used fresh herbs and added mushrooms. It was so yummy! I made a lot of it and only had about 10% left! It was a hit!

Awesome!  I had the best Thanksgiving this year thanks to some of the best recipes on this site!  I did have to make a few minor changes because I went to Stater Brothers this year and they didn't carry turkey sausage or turkey stock (strange, huh?!).  I used pork sausage (a little greasy, definitely use turkey sausage) and chicken stock.  I omitted the turkey liver, but other than that, I followed the recipe by the letter and everyone loved it!  I baked it in the oven instead of filling the turkey like other reviewers and it turned out great.  I probably added too much stock because I didn't want it dry, so next year I'll put in the amount that the recipe calls for and adjust as needed.  I'd use fresh herbs instead of dry and a granny smith apple next year, but otherwise... it really is an AWESOME recipe! :)  Thanks!!!!!

Best ever!  I used italian sausage that I squeezed out of the casing and added 1/2 cup of carrots with the apple.  I also doubled the stock because I baked this in a greased and covered casserole dish.  The colors, texture, and flavors were amazing.  My boyfried is not a fan of stuffing or cranberries, but he was changed by this recipe.

I made this with gluten free bread and vegetarian.  I added extra broth so it wouldn't be dry when I cooked it in the crockpot, and it was perfectly done.  Rave reviews at Thanksgiving, I will be passing this recipe along.

This was indeed awesome!  Like others, I skipped the liver, used fresh herbs (doubled amount), and baked outside the bird.  It was delicious!  I also used craisins and about 6 cups of gf bread.  This was the best stuffing.  I will definitely make it again.

After years of making a new stuffing each Thanksgiving, I've finally found a keeper!  Truly lives up to it's awesome name.  Sounds strange to say I loved it, but made changes :-) , but I used fresh herbs, Jimmy Dean sausage and dried cherries instead of the cranberries. And I used corn bread and a crusty Italian bread for the cubes.  I put foil over the stuffing in the pan, and it was moist and yummy!

Great recipe.  Cooked it outside the bird, if you do be sure to stir and check moisture at 30 minutes as others have suggested.  Using sage pork sausage work well, otherwise made as directed.

This was REALLY good, I had never made stuffing with cranberries before, so it was something new to me. I'm glad I made this and will make again

Delicious.  I cheated and used the store bought stuffing mix, also added sauteed mushrooms.  This was perfect.

I used fresh herbs instead of dried. 
Also, 
Since this recipe tastes awesome NOT mushy unlike the stuff in the box, I use half the mixture to stuff my bird but I roast the other half in the oven in a 9 inch sq cake pan with a little extra turkey broth. It is AWESOME.

Delicious!  I made as indicated except omitted the liver and used canned chicken stock.  Baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 40 minutes covered, then uncovered for 15 minutes.  I made 1 1/2 batches and used 1 1/2 cans of stock.  Also used fresh herbs (twice the amount of dried) and sage flavored pork sausage as others suggested.

Superb! I don't like celery so I took it out - I added more stock as it was too dry but left everything else as is.  This is the 1st Thanksgiving making this recipe but now it's on my permanent list!

I needed a good stuffing recipe since I was hosting Thanksgiving for a whole other family.  The reviews on this recipe made it sound wonderful. Unfortunately, mine didn't turn out well.  The flavor was good, but it was unbelievably dry, despite adding more than double the recommended broth.  If it had been moist, I think it probably would have been good.

This is one of my all time favorites.  I can't imagine having my Thanksgiving dinner without it.  I do sprinkle on extra broth.  I always chop my veggies very small (I don't like onions or celery chunks, but I'm okay if they are chopped small).  My family loves this recipe.

Great recipe.  I dont stuff the turkey.  I made it in a casserole dish.  Only change needed was more turkey stock since it doesnt have the turkey juices to keep it moist.  I already have requests to make it this Thanksgiving.

I guess it's a matter of preference, but I thought the craberries were too sweet in the stuffing. I picked them all out when I was eating. Next time I am skipping the cranberries and adding mushrooms!

This came out moist and flavorful, picked up the flavor of the bird nicely. I added a little more sage (personal preference) and some lemon juice for tang. 'Twas lovely.

Pretty good. I'd add more to it though. I'd also make it with real sausage, not turkey sausage. Didnt use the liver and baked it alone in oven.

I only gave it 4 stars because I altered the ingredients a bit.  I didn't add the liver, apples, or butter.  And I also used cornbread dressing from Stove Top w/ a half bag of cubed bread stuffing, FRESH herbs and way more chicken stock.  The turkey sausages and cranberries are a great addition!  This recipe ROCKS because it is SO TASTY and MOIST! Luv it!

Different from the traditional savory bread stuffing. I liked it, but with all the wonderful ingredients it contains I was surprised it didn't have as much flavor as I expected. I did add some chopped pecans and sliced sauteed fresh mushrooms. I might make it again but the old traditional stuffing is still our favorite.

I loved this recipe, so did everyone else. I added a lot of stock, because I baked it separately from the turkey. My mother, who doesn't like stuffing even had some and said it was good.

EXTRAORDINARY! Hands down, this stuffing has become standard in our family. I make twice the amount for two households. A few changes that work for me are to omit the liver, add extra nuts, herbs, and chicken broth for extra moisture and flavor. 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

As far as "non traditional" stuffing goes - this one is awesome! I had to use chicken liver instead of turkey and spicy sausage instead of regular which actually added a lot of flavor. Other than that, and the fact that I didn't place the mixture in the bird but rather in a baking dish in the over for 15 minutes, everything was done as the recipe called. Next time I will add mroe apples, which added a nice crunch along with the celery. Great recipe that I will use again!

This recipe has now become our family holiday standard. I hate to admit this, but for Thanksgiving '08 I made this for the first time. I inadvertently added 2 1/2 TABLESPOONS of sage instead of 2 1/2 teaspoons. My family STILL loved it!

I recently tried this for my first Thanksgiving.  I got a lot of compliments on it and in fact, I just got a request to bring it to Christmas dinner at my parents!  My family was suspicious of it at first as they were used to plain PF stuffing, but they loved it!  
Update in 09... It's now my second thanksgiving and both my parents and sister's family have asked that I bring this...  Oh- I omitted the liver, used PF stuffing, Jimmy Dean Sage Pork sausage and will try the fresh herbs this year to see if it makes a difference.

Enjoy!  My family sure did!

This was OK, but not as flavorful as I was hoping for.  Next time I will leave out the sausage and add some pecans or walnuts instead.

I messed up on this recipe and didn't leave myself the amount of time and extra broth necessary to make it properly out of the bird, mine ended up a little dry. But as it was, the stuffing was soo good that my husband and brother were practically doing rock-paper-scissors to see who got to keep/ or take home the leftovers! so even in my screw up it gets a full five stars! GREAT FLAVOR!

I was a little but dissapointed by this, just because the reviews were so good, maybe I was expecting too much. Don't get me wrong, this was very good, just not THAT much better than our regular stuffing.

This is such a great alternative to traditional stuffing.  I doubled the amount of bread crumbs and turkey stock to make it a little closer to the texture my family is used to, but the flavors are wonderful.  I have tried both turkey and pork sausage, but we preffered the pork.

This stuff is amazing! I love being able to say that I made everything down to the bread crumbs. I have made this several times for my family and everyone loves it. Word of caution: Tastes great straight out of the oven but not so good heated up the day after. It seems like the sausage dries up and the bread crumbs get too moist and the rosemary kicks it in overdrive. But it is fantastic when fresh!

I like to use the locally made italian sausage,preferrabley hot when available and make your own turkey stock would be only thing to add personal touch.This is the best stuffing I have ever made,and have been following this recipe for at least five years.Yumm O so many compliments even from the conservative eaters.

This worked out great. We used 1/3 in the bird. The rest in a dish. We also substituted fresh herbs. We also used cornbread instead of white and 10 grain instead of wheat. I have had rave reviews from my guests and the others that have had it at work. Thank you for posting this base recipe.

Our family raved about this stuffing!  We used turkey link sausages and squeezed the ground meat out of the casings and browned it with the veggies.  I prepared everything the night before, except the bread portion, so the herbs could meld with the meat overnight.  We left out the liver! Will definitely use this again!

Great recipe with all of the changes that I made.  I doubled the recipe for a party of 20, and it was all gone! You have to take into consideration that my family isn't big on stuffing but they enjoyed it a lot. The changes that I made were toasting the bread pieces a few more minutes than called for until they were fully crisp.  I also did not add the cooked liver because it wouldn't suit some of my guests.  I also used hot and mild Italian sausage.  Next time, I would use less chicken stock because it was a bit too mushy for my personal liking.  To top it off, I used one golden delicious apple and one green apple, and it was perfect!

I basically kept the recipe "as is" but doubled it and cooked it separately from the bird. The doubled recipe took about 45 min at 375 degrees in a tightly foiled 2-qt buttered baking dish. It was fabulous. I didn't take off the foil at the end, but if you wanted it crispy on the top, you could just remove the foil during the last 15 min of baking time. The only changes I made were: used pork sausage, made my own bread to use (a white bread with sage & rosemary), and allowed the bread to air dry for 36 hrs instead of simply toasting it. This will definitely be on the menu again.

I did not care for this at all but I think it's due to I couldn't find ground turkey sausage and had to substitute a kielbasa type turkey item. It was pretty gross. I would like to make it again w/the right kind of sausage since this got such good reviews.

My husband and I HATE stuffing, but love this one!  I've made this for 4 years in a row now for Thanksgiving and it just seems to get better and better.  I toast bread and chop the onions and celery the night before.  I took someone elses advise a few years back and I sub Jimmy Dean Sage sausage for the turkey meat.  AWESOME and so much easier.  I also 86 the liver.  My kids actually loved it this year (they are now 7) and there were no leftovers!!

For a homemade stuffing, this was really yummy (how could you go wrong with sausage??). Per the other reviews, it is definitely different if you are used to the instant Stovetop stuffings (which I also love, by the way), but it is certainly a must try!

I have to say, I was kind of leery making this recipe. However, after doing so, I am absolutely THRILLED with the results! ALL of the flavors blend perfectly! It got rave reviews at my T-Day Table, and there was about 1cup of leftovers!! This will be the only stuffing recipe I use from now on! WONDERFUL!

I made this recipe for my husband's family Thanksgiving despite my concern that they are not adventurous eaters.  It turned out that a couple of people really loved the recipe, but overall it wasn't a success.   I might make this again for my side of the family, but I thought it might be good to write this review for others in my same situation with picky eaters.

I baked it in a separate dish for the recommended 45 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered and it tasted wonderful. All of my friends enjoyed this stuffing and went back for seconds! Note, I used one full 14oz can of chicken broth (not 3/4 cup) to keep it moist. Also, your baking dish should be about 2 quarts sized.

I made this for my first official Thanksgiving dinner, just a few days ago.  Although this seemed like a lot of prep work, it really paid off!  Even my dad, who is a stuffing traditionalist LOVED it.  The flavors were great, I'll be making this every year!  I cooked this outside the bird.  It makes a lot, but it's all worth it.  Like other reviewers, I cooked it covered at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, and then uncovered for 15.  It was a bit loose, I might follow others' advice and use an egg next time - and I had to use extra broth...but it's great. Thanks for sharing this!

I made this recipe twice - once the week before Thanksgiving and once for Thanksgiving dinner.  I did not care for it either time.  There was way too much meat in the dish, so cut the amount of sausage in half.  I also just didn't care for the texture of it - very crumbly and would not stay together on a fork.  The second time I made it I used 1 egg in the mix and that seemed to help, but overall it was not as good as a more traditional stuffing.  Lots of this dish were leftover - no one really went for second helpings.

I made this for Thanksgiving but did not stuff it in the turkey.  I baked it as others suggested at 350 degrees for 45 min. covered, then about 20 min. uncovered, stirring every 15-20 min.  Most of my guests thought it was delicious, but my husband prefers a more traditional stuffing.  He wasn't crazy about the sweetness of the cranberries and apples.  It is beautiful and very flavorful.  Definitely worth trying.

This was great.  I didn't stuff the turkey with this so I added more broth and it came out soooo good... Will make every Thanksgiving.  I also added chestnuts and fresh herbs instead of dried.

Tasted delicious! i mananged to burn the bread, though, but that was my fault bc there was so many other things going on, that i kept forgetting about the stuffing in the oven!! Tasted really hearty compared to regular boxed stuffing! It was a little time comsuming, but ill probably make this again next year UPDATE NOV 09: We used this stuffing to stuff a 20 lb turkey and it was actually too much stuffing! But we managed to shove it in!  Still tastes great, but it was just soo soggy! It could have been because off all the turkey drippings.  And, the top still burnt this year, just as it did last year :( hmm, gonna have to figure something out.  Overall, i still love it more than box, even if it takes way longer than 15 minutes worth of prep time!

This was pretty good, and I did receive complements on it. Due to time constraints, I used a box of pre-seasoned stuffing bread instead of toasting my own bread. It worked out ok, but I think it would have tasted better with freshly toasted bread, as the pre-seasoned stuff introduced a strong competing flavor. Other modifications I made were:  decreased the amount of sausage (because we were already eating it with turkey). The type of sausage I used was "Jenny-O Turkey Breakfast Sausage Links", and I just squeezed the ground sausage out of the casings and broke it up in the pan. I also used Granny Smith apples because I prefer a more crisp and tart flavor over the mushy Golden Delicious. And, I increased amount to 2 apples. I also used fresh herbs, and increased the amount of stock because I baked it outside the turkey in a casserole dish (as suggested by others). Next time, I will definitely toast my own bread like the recipe calls for.  But, if you are short on time and decide to use boxed stuffing -- my advice is to make sure that it is NOT pre-seasoned, as the flavor will be off.

This was so delicious!  I cooked it outside of the turkey, so it came out a little drier than I preferred.  When I use this recipe next year, I'll just add more broth and it will be perfection!

Wow, wow, wow. Made this for the first time and everyone LOVED it. Even my brother-in-law who scoffed at the idea of apples in stuffing had two servings! Fresh herbs are essential. I made my own bread crumbs from high quality bread and highly recommend it. Added a bit of extra broth since I was cooking it outside of the turkey. Fan-friggin-tabulous recipe!

Outstanding.  I used fresh cranberries and at first it was sour but after letting it sit awhile in the crockpot (after being in the oven) the flavors blended and it was so yummy.  Definately a do again.

Absolutely delicious.  We've always been a Stove Top family and I wanted to try actual stuffing/dressing this year.  Used homemade cornbread cubes for the majority of it.  No liver.  Was baking as dressing outside of the turkey, so took the recommendations of many here & added an extra 1/2 cup of stock.  Baked at 350 for about 40 minutes & uncovered for last 15.  This was the one item that got the biggest raves!

This was an excellent change from my traditional family's stuffing. I served 8 guests and got a thumbs up from 7 out 8 people. I followed other's advice and it turned out great! Here are my following notes: I changed the amount of servings to 30 which yielded one 9x13 casserole and one 8x8 casserole. This way everyone was sent home with extra's. 1. I used a one lb. loaf of plain stuffing bread, one round loaf of sourdough, and a one lb. loaf of wheat, which I dried out days before and stored in a airtight container. 
2. 2 pounds Jimmy Dean mild pork sausage instead of 3 for the caculated 30 servings
3. two golden delicious and one fuji apple (grated in a hand grater)
4. 1-1/2 cups of dried craisans (cut in smaller pieces)
5. doubled all the herbs (used fresh)
6. 5 cups chicken stock
7.**added one egg beaten in stock before mixing
8. baked 350 degrees in buttered casseroles as mentioned for about 40 minutes covered with foil then remove for 15 to brown. 
**If I was to make again I would probably decreased the craisans by another 1/2 cup (my preference since the craisans are very bold and tart).
I'm not sure I would make this every Thanksgiving since are family is not used to a sweet stuffing but, it is definately worth the five stars!

This was UNBELIEVABLE! I am a vegetarian, so I made a couple of adjustments. I used a baguette that was freshly baked at the local grocery story, and ommited the liver. I used soy protein sausage (SO GOOD), and couldn't afford all of the fresh herbs, so I used some rosemary and thyme "icecubes" that I had made from my fresh herb plants this past summer. I did splurge and buy the fresh parsley. Since I didn't put it in the turkey, I used a little over a cup of veggie stock, popped it in a greased pan, and cooked it for an hour at 350. It came out PERFECT. The only change I would make for next time - break up the bread a little smaller and maybe add another apple. SO GOOD!!

I read all the helpful reviews on this recipe and made some alterations accordingly. This recipe turned out just like it's name AWESOME!! Fresh herbs are definitely the way to go.I made this outside the bird and added more stock. I was worried since there is no real measurement for the additional stock, but you can tell if it needs more stock as you cook it.

Learn from my mistake!  If you are using turkey sausage with the skin, best to cut up the skin first, or wait until the sausage is completely cooked then chop it up into smaller bits.  Our sausage chunks were too big and it overwhelmed the stuffing.  Hope to make this again with better results.  As for now, I'm afraid stove top beat this one.

MADE THIS AS AN EXTRA DRESSING FOR THANKSGIVING AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  MADE IT THE DAY BEFORE AND COOKED IT  NEXT DAY.  USED SAGE SAUSAGE,SOUR DOUGH BREAD, AND DIDN'T USE THE LIVER. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS LEGAL! HOWEVER, I AM GOING TO USE THE RECIPE AS IS NEXT TIME TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE.  YOU WILL GET RAVES WITH THIS EXCELLENT RECIPE--THANK YOU, STACY!  PEGGY

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I also didn't stuff my turkey with this stuffing.  I cooked it in a casserole dish.  I added a little more liquid than the recipe called for.  I will make this dish again.  I used Italian sausage in the recipe which provided a good balance to the sweetness of the dried cranberries.

I made this for our family of southerners who are particular when it comes to their cornbread dressing.  It was a great hit! I used one bag of dry cornbread dressing mix instead of other bread. I left out the celery and used 
1 1/2 boxes of chicken broth and two beaten eggs and baked it in 10x13 pan at 350 for 1 hour.  I also used fresh herbs.  Awesome aroma and flavor!

The recipe is absolutely AMAZING!! Since my husband's sister is a vegetarian, I made this recipe with Morning Star vegetarian sausage, vegetable stock and omitted the turkey liver. Even with the vegetarian sausage, this recipe had such great flavor. The apples make it perfectly moist, even when reheated the next day for left-overs! Everyone at the dinner table loved it and gave repeated compliemnts!! I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving again next year (and probably all the years to come).

This really was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner, however I used Jimmy Dean pork sausage and left out the turkey liver. This is so good, it will become a tradition at our holiday meals from now on.

Ohmygoodness!  With much trepidation, I broke tradition this year and tried this recipe instead of our usual cake-like mushy dressing/stuffing.  It was a HIT!  Several of the kids & teens who usually turn up their noses at this side dish gobbled it up. Per previous reviews, I omitted the liver, doubled the spices and put it in an oven-proof dish and baked it in the oven on 250 for 40min, stirring twice. This will be our go-to dressing/stuffing recipe for the next thirty years. THANKS!

This was a big hit on my Thanksgiving menu.  I added an egg & extra broth, then made as directed otherwise.  This is fantastic.  I did stuff the bird & cooked the extra in a separate dish.  WOW! My family loved this!!!

No liver, used chicken broth, and granny smith apple and pork sausage.  The craisins were so good in this - I doubled the recipe.  This stuffing got a round of applauce tonight.  I took my bows and secretly thanked Allrecipes and Stacy for submitting this recipe.  Thank you for making me look good.

This is my go-to stuffing.  I'm living in Ukraine now, so I've had to alter things a little, but the best thing I've done is use a chicken sausage, despite the insistence in many comments to use pork sausage.  It reduces the fat content of this stuffing without sacrificing the flavours, and it stays in the poultry theme.  I'd use turkey sausage if I could (and I have).  Jimmy Dean products are full of fillers and are generally ridiculously high in fat.  I also stick with dried cranberries, as Craisins are sweetened, and the extra sugar is unnecessary.

The first time I cooked a turkey, I used this stuffing recipe. Everyone loved it. The next time I cooked a turkey I thought I would try a different recipe. It was just ok. So am only going to do this recipe from now on. The only thing I do different is to use a box of bread cubes instead of toasting my own, just to cut down on time.

I must have done something wrong, but I made this twice and had similar problems.
 Both times I made this the stuffing seemed greasy, which I assume was from the sausage.  
 I made this at Thanksgiving and everyone ate it and said it was great, but I, of course, critiqued it and found faults.
 I will admit that I often have trouble eating my own food as I criticize my cooking, but I did find that no matter how much straining I did the meat was greasy.
 Other than that it was interesting!

I will never fix ANYTHING else.  Absolutely perfect.  I found myself adding more chicken stock and white wine to the desired consistency and my favorite bread choice is ciabatta (you can find in your local market). Set the bread out the night before and you will be all set. Bob Evans makes a great sage sausage by the way...

This is so good! I never use the liver and I like to use day old Italian bread. I also always use poultry seasoning instead of the individual spices to save time.

This is the best stuffing ever.  It is part of our family favorites now.  I pair it up with the winter salad with poppy seed dressing for holidays.  If I'm in a rush I will use the bag of seasoned stuffing mix and cut down on the spices (keep the rosemary though).  I sometimes add water chestnuts too.  Thanks!!

I did this for Thanksgiving and was disappointed.  The recipe doesn't "mesh" so everything was good in individual bites, but it was hard to get the flavor as a whole.  It has such great reviews, I may try it again and use more of the comments to help it out.  It was dry and just okay.

LOVED the flavors.  i am more of a "traditional" stufffing lover, but this had great taste.  i added 2 cans of broth.  had about 2 cups more of bread.  used sage pork sausage.  no fresh ingredients.  didnt use sage.  still wonderful!  next time i might try regular pork sausage or maple flavored cos i'm not a big fan of sage.  oh, and i used a whole lb. of sausage and i didnt think it was too much.  thanks for the recipe!

Happy Holidays! This is the BEST stuffing recipe and very easy to make.  I made it for a Christmas party and also for our family dinner and it was a hit. The only changes I made were using pork sausage (couldn't find turkey) and left out the turkey neck. Oh, and I used fresh herbs along with a dash of dried poultry seasoning. I also used an egg to help bind. I cooked mine in a crock pot and it was perfect. I will definitely be making this next year!!!

This stuffing turned out great.  The only thing that i would change is the amount of sausage that was used.  It has good flavor, but it was a little to meaty for my tastes.  Next time i will also add more apple to the mix.  It gives it a little bit of a sweeter flavor.

It turned out wonderfully and was enjoyed by everyone as one of the best stuffings they'd had. I added more cranberries than the recipe called for and used canned chicken stock (also adding a bit more) but it still turned out great!

Thank you for a great recipe. It was very easy to make -considering that I am a beginner- and delicious! Everyone loved it. The combination of different flavours such as thyme and rosemary mixed with the apples and the cranberries makes this recipe a very rich and delicious one!

Absolutely incredible stuffing recipe. It was alot of fun to make as well! I accidentally used the skinless turkey sausage, so it cooked like ground turkey. This worked out great for the stuffing. Huge hit for Thanksgiving. I will be saving this recipe. Thank you!

I have tried many different stuffing recipies but this one won me unanimous rave reviews! 

I stuffed my turkey and rotisseried it outside using aluminum foil to keep the dressing in the cavity. It was outstanding!

This stuffing was very good. Quite the crown pleaser. I made it for Thanksgiving and even the people who don't normally like stuffing tried it and liked it. I didn't put it in the bird because it dries out the meat. So, I used some extra chicken stock to make it a little more moist. I also didn't use the liver. So, I used a full pound of turkey sausage. It came out pretty good. Still a little dry, so I might use even more chicken stock this time.

This was pretty good.  I used fresh herbs and I used waaayyy to much so it had a strong herb flavor, but I could tell if I use the correct amount next time, it will be good. Not as good as my moms though!  But none the less...

Incredible.  I stuffed a 15lbs bird and put the remaining in an 8x8 baking dish.  The stuffing I baked outside of the bird got some extra stock.  It was great, thank you for the recipe.

The flavor combanation was yummy. However I thought there was too much sausage and not enough breading. Simple fix for next year as I plan on making it again.

This was a great start. I added a few things and tweaked it a bit to fit my tastes and really enjoyed it. One thing i did not do (beacause on thanksgiving the oven was already full) was toast the bread, and I wish I had. I will not skip that step next time!

I used sourdough and wheat bread and I thought this came out good. I would maybe increase the bread amount a little bit next time... Also, turkey keilbasa is a good alternative to the sausage.

I followed other people's reviews and used only fresh spices. I also had it overnight in it's own pan. Add a whole can of broth and you'll be fine. Everybody loved it and will make for X-mas !

I made this for Thanksgiving....it was wonderful.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did replace the ground turkey sausage with sage flavored sausage.  I did not add the liver....not one of our favorite things.  I recommend this one to everyone.  EXCELLENT.......

I'm not a big fan of any kind of stuffing and I got second servings of this one. It is awesome. And so easy!! Last year we made it and stuffed the turkey with it. This year we made it seperate from the turkey. I like it better made seperate but the choice is yours.

This was really good!  I usually make a rice stuffing and prefer it but as far as bread stuffings - this was awesome!  I had trouble finding the turkey livers and used chicken liver instead...but got a lot of "EWWWWWs" from the kids.  I am not sure if it really was needed and will probably leave out the livers next next time.  I think it would be hard to find a better bread stuffing.

This is a variation of a recipe I had. While we liked it, I gave it only 4 stars because I practically doubled the amount of bread called for and still the seasonings were quite strong. So overall, good but i would decrease the amount of sausage and herbs.

This stuffing is delicious!!! I followed the advice of others and used fresh herbs...amazing. I also used sourdough bread which I purchased fresh and just let it sit out of a day. I also used pork sausage instead of the turkey. I think it gave it more flavor. I omitted the turkey liver and used a granny smith since that's what I had. Oh, I also added an egg as others suggested to hold it together better. The only change I will make in the future is to use more bread. I like the mushiness of stuffing. I found there to be a lot of other "things" and not enough bread...but the taste is fantastic!!!

Excellent recipe!  I got rave reviews for it.  I doubled the recipe and altered it slightly to include pine cuts, a teaspoon of chilli powder, and two eggs for each portion of the stuffing (this was part of my mother's traditional recipe).  It was a perfect blend!

I made this for Thanksgiving and for those who actually eat stuffing, they loved it!  It was very easy to make and I didn't make the bread stuffing myself, I used Mrs. Cubbison's seasoned dressing by  mistake(I meant to buy the seasoned stuffing).  The dressing is almost more like crumbs then stuffing mix, but it didn't matter, it was still delicious.  I didn't follow the amount of stock in the recipe, I kept adding stock til it was moist enough to my liking. You can use whatever apples you have handy, I chose to use the Granny Smith apple because the dried cranberry already has a little sweetness to it.   I used a Jimmy Dean sausage instead but it is definitely a part of this recipe that can be played with, so being that there are a lot of sausages out there, next time I will try a different sausage.  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.

This stuffing is really good ummmhmmmmm...  Did not stuff the bird with it, but baked it in a dish at 350 for about half an hour used a little extra wine and some stock to keep it moist.  My new favorite comfort food with gravy.. I personally thought we didn't even need the turkey!

The best I have ever made - will definately be making over and over again!  Thanks for sharing.  I did mine outside of the rutkey and followed anothers suggestion to just add more broth - worked out beautifully!

My family and I aren't big stuffing fans, but my husband and his family are, so I had to find a good recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. I've never in my life made stuffing, so I was a little worried... I didn't know what it was supposed to look like or taste like, so I just followed this recipe and my husband and his family raved about it! I followed the recipe almost exactly, however, I omitted the Turkey Liver and added half a pack of Jimmy Deans Sage Sausage... since the sausage already contained sage, I didn't add any extra, also I used Chicken stock instead of Turkey stock.... and last, when I cooked all the meat, it looked like way too much meat so I ended up taking some out. I never tasted the stuffing, but everyone else gave it 5 stars.

Pretty darn good stuffing.  I realized at the last minute that I was out of sage, so I omitted it.  I'm sure the flavor would be even better with the sage.  Definitely will try this one again.

Everyone loved this...we had 20+ guests.  We made two kinds of stuffing...but this one didn't go in the bird, so we added a lot of extra broth to moisten it all the way and baked it for about an hour at the same temp as the turkey.  It was grub!

I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving and it turned out great.  To save time I just used a bag of prepared stuffing mix and mixed in all the good stuff in(omitting the liver)

Big hit at Thanksgiving, one of the favorites. I just used regular sausage and no turkey liver, though. (I accidentally dropped the turkey liver on the ground, so I decided not to use it, haha)

Wonderful recipe!  Growing up I either had the stuffing that came in a box, or else home made stuffing that was almost bitter tasting!  Either way, the great thing about this recipe is that you can actually tell what your eating.  Its colorful and all the flavors mix so well.  I cooked our Thanksgiving dinner for the first time and this will be passed through our family for sure and will be a holiday hit for generations to come!  I couldnt find the gizzard bag in our turkey, so I left out the turkey liver and it was still wonderful.  Maybe Christmas I will put in the liver, but its still great without!  A must try recipe!  I deep fried my turkey so I cooked this in a casserole dish with a lid at 350 for about 45 min.

This was a hit - I'm only not giving it 5 stars because it was missing something.  I'm thinking it either needs hot sausage or Granny Smith apples, something to "spunk" it up a bit.  I'll definitely be making again.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and received alot of compliments as well as requests for the recipe.We really loved it. I did dry out the bread cubes before baking them in the oven and omitted the turkey livers. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it was awesome!

What a great Thanksgiving treat! I couldn't find ground turkey sausage so I bought sweet italian sausages and cut the casings off to get my ground turkey. I will be making this for years to come.

This recipe is wonderful!  All of my guests raved about how good the stuffing was.  I have never been a big fan of stuffing but this one is a keeper.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried but pretty much kept to the recipe.  It came out very moist and very flavorful.

Everyone loved it.  I made 2, and took out the sausage and liver for our vegetarian guests and just added some pecans and chopped green pepper and mushrooms.  Both versions were a hit. I made each in a casserole and added extra broth so it would not be too dry.

I made this for my Mom's Thanksgiving party. I would say this was the best stuffing I've ever had, except by the time i went to eat, there was none left! Everyone loved it and i wish i'd made more! Fresh herbs are a definite must, but I'm sure dryed herbs are fine if you're on a budget or short on time. This was also really easy to make, an excellent dish for Thanksgiving Dinner! :)

We felt there was a bit too much sausage. Maybe if I'd cubed up the bread smaller.. I don't know. It was still REEEEALLY good, had a great flavor. I'd probably cut the sausage in 1/2 next time. 
Also, I made it outside the turkey while the turkey was resting. I used drippings from the turkey (which I had plenty of since I used the Turkey Brine & Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way from this site) to moisten it. Baked at 350 for about an hour, pouring additional drippings over and mixing when I felt it needed it. Thanks for this one.. I'll be making it again!

Absolutely amazing.  I usually am not a person who loves fruit in savory dishes, but this turned out perfect.  The fruit added extra depth of flavor and more of a tanginess than a sweetness.  I cooked this outside the bird and added extra stock.  Make sure to add enough salt and herbs.

I made this for our first Thanksgiving dinner at our home and it was a great hit! It was much more popular than my in-laws' dressing... oops :)
It is so flavorful.  I will definitely make this a Thanksgiving tradition.

Perfect recipe!  I followed others' suggestions as follows: omitted the turkey liver, used an egg to hold it together.  I also made this mostly the night before Thanksgiving.  I cooked the sausage, toasted the bread and put the sausage/onion/spices mixture over the bread all the night before.  I put everything in a greased baking dish and sprayed olive oil over it all.  The next day, I added the rest of the ingredients, covered it with foil and cooked it on 350 for about 45 min.  I ended up almost doubling the chicken stock.  I will definitely make this again!

I used pre-packagedherbed bread cubes, corn bread, craisins, a granny smith apple, extra broth & an egg and cooked it in a separate covered casserole dish. I stirred it 1/2 way through and uncovered it at the end so it would be crispy on top.  It was a HIT!

First time making Thanksgiving dinner here in Japan.  I made this, but had to substitute a couple ingredients that I couldn't find.  Like others I used the sweetened dried cranberries and I changed the turkey sausage out for some hotlinks that I had in the freezer.  I didn't stuff the bird either, so I used about 1 1/2 cup of turkey stock.

Seriously awesome reviews from my friends.  Will definately try again.

I skipped the liver and added some of the mixture from the "Baked Whole Pumpkin" recipe. It was great!

I tried it for the first time this Thanksgiving.  I covered it & baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 min., mixing and adding a bit of broth half way thru so the bottom would not be dry and then moved it to a chafing dish ... it was easy & everyone really liked it.  Thank you.

Awesome!  I made it the day before then just had to cook on Thanksgiving.  I cooked it in my convection oven at 350 for 35 minutes.  I followed the suggestions and used fresh herbs as well as keeping it very moist with turkey stock. Next time I would double the recipe because there weren't enough leftovers!

This stuffing is wonderful!  I used reduced fat pork sausage (couldn't find turkey sausage).  I also added about a cup of chicken broth, since I cooked it outside the turkey.  Also, I kept checking it while it cooked (approx 1/2 hour), and added more broth as needed.
Growing up, we always used the dried stuffing cubes.  Well,  my family loved this!  The texture was perfect.  I will definitely make this one again.  So easy!

Stacy thank you for this reciepe..... I did take beaten egg whites and brush the top.  Followed recciepe to the T.  Stacy you could of never shared and made a million with this Thank you.  Family loves it year after year.  Egg white brush gives such a nice look will take a picture and share.  Another saving step I take is I brown the sausage, onion celery mix freeze in freezer then assemble the night before and pour butter and home made turkey broth over.  Find a church that feeds the homeless and you will have the best broth.  Plus I start in November saving the best bread left overs and dry them out.  It seems like a lot of work but it is so easy to do it in steps.

I found this recipe when planning Thanksgiving dinner and just HAD to make it.  I went in search of a turkey stock recipe and found that Stacy provided that as well.  See Awesome Turkey Giblet Stock on this site.  It is easy to make and delicious.  I also used the extra stock for my gravy.  The only thing I changed was adding a half pound of Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage when I cooked the turkey sausage and onion, and leaving out the turkey liver, as suggested in earlier postings.

Okay, this was good, but we did make some adjustments: left out the sage, used chicken liver instead of turkey liver and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock. I also used more sausage. I would love to try this w/ less bread and pork sausage. I will say this made quite a lot of stuffing and it was good.

As I had never made stuffing before, I made this one based on the reviews and I am so happy I did.  This one is going to be a keeper.  I'm picking on the leftovers as I'm typing this.  I used a lean italian sausage and used a combination of wheat and corn bread.  Like other reviewers I used a granny smith apple and craisins which were perfect in this recipe.  Also I didn't bake this in the turkey so based on other reviewers, I added about 1.5 cups of stock to make it more moist and it came out perfect.

Very good,  1 pound of sausage is a bit to much so i added about 8 extra slices of bread and used sage flavored sausage.  Will definatley make again.

I used the bread machine to bake up a 1.5-lb loaf of sourdough bread a few days beforehand, and used pork sausage in lieu of hard-to-find turkey sausage.  I didn't stuff the bird with this, but rather baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes in a greased 2.5-3 qt casserole.  Wonderful!

This went over OK with the family...who are used to the usual bread and celery type stuffing.  I would make it again for a change of pace as the different flavors really did compliment one another.  Like others suggested, I uses sage flavored sausage, craisons and granny smith apples; doubled this and cooked most outside of the bird.  Very good.  Thanks.

This is really great. It's perfectly savory but the cranberries and apple bits add a sweet surprise every once in a while.  

I baked in a casserole dish and it was a bit too dry and crumbly so next time I'll add more stock. I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent!  I made this with sourdough bread and whole wheat; fresh herbs, pork sausage with sage; craisens instead of just dried cranberries and it was awesome!  Everyone loved it!  The only thing is next time I am going to cube my bread a tad bit more---my bread was a little larger than it should've been!  ;o)

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was wonderful.  After reading some of the suggestions in other reviews I used a pork sausage and added all fresh herbs.  I also baked it outside of the turkey and used one 14oz can of chicken broth.  It was soooo good and I plan to continue making this every Thanksgiving!!

This is an interesting and delicious take on stuffing.  I used sourdough and wheat which was tasty.  I should have cut up the bread smaller, but it still was great.  I cooked outside of the turkey and accomodated by using 2 cups of broth.  This made it very wet but yummy. Forgot to add the parsley but didn't miss it.

This was my second year in a row for this stuffing and forget the turkey, I can't stop picking at the leftovers of this stuffing!!! My changes this year were to add some fresh garlic and portobello mushrooms (in lieu of liver) to the sausage/veg mixture, added some pepper to the spices, and used less butter but added some white wine. I also didn't stuff this in the bird but cooked it in a casserole for 30 minutes and gave it several baster squirts of turkey juice for flavor and moisture throughout the cooking. Also, though I like the texture of the toasted breads I also tore up and added a few pieces of non-toasted bread so that I could have a mixture of soft and toasted breads in the stuffing. One last thing--I recommend a tart crisp apple like Empire or Granny Smith.

I tried this recipe with a few variations - prepackaged stuffing instead of bread cubes, no dried herbs and no liver - and it was incredibly well received and tasty. I did have to add about double the broth (chicken since I wasn't cooking the turkey.) Also, living in the south I was able to find Neese's Country Sausage with extra sage. This is definitely a recipe that will be used at Christmas too.

This was amazing!  I did not use the turkey liver and I used chicken stock.  I could not find turkey sausage, so I asked the meat dept guy and he recommended that I use the sweet turkey Italian sausage and just take them out of the casing. It worked and tasted very good.  I made it for my family the day before Thanksgiving and my mom asked me to double it up so that we could take it to our friends house the next day.It is very tasty.  Two thumbs up!!!!!

I love this recipe and so does everyone in my family! Like some other people, I do not add liver. Also, I add some spiced apple wine to the stuffing and also pour some over the turkey while cooking it. The wine adds great flavor!

This recipe is so good!  Only change I made was subsitute the wheat & white bread with cubed Martin's Potato Bread - a little less healthy, but hey, it's holiday time!  This will be on my Thanksgiving AND Christmas table every year!

I made this because I knew my stuffing would never hold up to my Mom's traditional stuffing and I didn't want everyone feeling disappointed that it didn't taste the same...I would rather it be too different to compare!  My plan worked, everyone commented on it being different, but very good.

Fabulous recipe! A little high maintenance to prepare when you are trying to cook a million things on turkey day, but well worth the effort!! Everyone LOVED this stuffing! I used it last year and I will start using it every year! This recipe will probably be used in my family forever! Thank you!

My husband loved it.  It wasn't too dry, or too mushy!  I liked the tartness of the apple and cranberries with the breading.  Will definatly cook this recipe again.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because I left the Liver out of the recipie.

Well, I have to admit that I don't like stuffing so to be honost. I didn't even try it! However, my Fiance who is a stuffing fanatic boasted this to be the best that she's ever had. On my end, it was simple to make, not overly expensive and it lended some fantastic aromas to the cooking turkey. Bravo!

I am southern born and bred, so cornbread dressing is a must at thanksgiving, but we were stuck at home and not being able to see family, so I branched out and tried something new.  It was wonderful!!!! Loved it!!!! The only reason I gave just four stars is it still wasn't cornbread stuffing.

I planned this for a big Christmas dinner. Chicken Pox cancelled that, but I was really looking forward to trying this. I made it and baked it as a side with the thanksgiving slow cooker turkey from this site and it was AWESOME!! Could not find Turkey Stock, used chicken and upped the amt a bit. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! Made too much and am LOVING the leftovers.

I used Craisins as another reviewer had done.  This was good but I think I'd leave out craisins/cranberries or else put a very small amount it--just my personal preference.  I didn't care for the sweetness combined with the rest of the ingredients.

This was very good and my husband who doesn't like stuffing said this was good--which is the ultimate compliment.  My 7 and 3 year old would not touch--thinks it may be a little fancy for some little ones.  I did not add the liver, added a LOT more broth which you will definitely need to do if you like your stuffing moist and I baked early in the day--let the flavors meld and just reheated for dinner. Not difficult at all to make and very dellicious--just remember to add more broth if you don't like dry stuffing! :)Thanks for a very good recipe.

I was a little skeptical of the fruit in this recipe, but I made it all as suggested and oh my gosh...this stuffing was AMAZING.  Everyone at dinner raved about how wonderful it turned out and said my husband and I should be cooking for the President or someone else important.  I've been searching for the perfect stuffing for a turkey for a long time.  I do believe I've found it!  This was truly fabulous!

I thought it was a nice change from the traditional stuffing. I didn't stuff the turkey - I baked it in a covered dish for 1 hour at 350. I got a lot of compliments on this dish. Thanks!

Loved this recipe. I subed sage sausage for the turkey and didn't add the turkey liver. I also added alittle bit more chicken broth because it seemed a bit dry.  It came out perfect and everybody loved it.

This was the first time that I have actually stuffed my turkey with a stuffing (as opposed to making the stuffing separately in the oven). This was great! I'm not sure if the turkey made the difference or not, but this stuffing was amazing...my husband even loved it and he doesn't like sausage! I used fresh bakery whole wheat bread and challah for the stuffing...

Absolutely delicious!  I used sweet Italian sausage and received rave reviews.  Did not however, stuff the turkey with it; I opted to bake it in a pan.  It turned out great.

Absolutely awesome stuffing!  I've been trying for a while now to make a good homemade stuffing and never suceeded until I tried this recipe.  I followed some user recommendations, such as adding extra broth when cooking OUT of the turkey, I used plain breakfast sausage (long story) and had to sub dried currants for the cranberries since the store was completely out of cranberries.  It turned out delicious and is going to be the first of the Thanksgiving leftovers to be finished.  I am actually going to make a 2nd batch. :)  Oh, and I used sourdough bread, which was great!

This was an awesome recipe.  We left out the turkey liver.  We substituted 1/2 cup golden raisins for 1/2 cup cranberries and put in 1/4 cup craisins, too.  It was delicious.

This stuffing is so yummy!  Usually I load everything with gravy, but this tasted so good I didn't want to ruin the flavor.  Per other reviews, I used a Granny Smith apple, sourdough and wheat breads. I did not stuff the turkey, and since I didn't have any room in the oven, I cooked this on the stove.  If you cook it stovetop, there's no need to add extra liquid (I put in a cup of vegetable broth instead of turkey stock since my turkey was still baking)--mine was a bit on the wet side (I left it on low on the stove for quite a while to try to dry it out as much as possible).  I had an unplanned variation since I did not have Sage on hand--my substitution was some Italian Seasoning since it has some Sage in it.  I will definitely make this stuffing again (but I'll make sure there's Sage in my cabinet)!

I don't love stuffing, but this was my first time making the entire T-day dinner so I had to make it. This was awesome! I keep adding more when I reheat the leftovers! Caveats: I don't measure, I use hot italian sausage instead of turkey, and I added maybe 4 oz of cremini mushrooms b/c they were leftover. We loved my version of the recipe though.

This was the first stuffing I ever made and my family absolutely loved it!  This stuffing was good..a little bit on the sweet side for my taste but a great twist on the traditional recipe.  I stuffed the turkey and made some on the side.  Only took about 45 minutes at 350 degrees for the side stuffing to cook...the stuffing in the turkey turned out super moist and yummy!

Okay, the name says it all.  I messed this up and it was still great.  I didn't think there was enough broth after I mixed it up so I added more.  That made it soupy when I checked on it so I had to take the foil off to let it cook out.  Still yummy but next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

This was easy and good, a bit different than typical. I used a full bag of dried plain mixed bread cubes, a full can of broth and pork sausage.  Stuffed it all in the bird and it was very moist.

This is a good recipe--something a little bit different.  I would recommend toasting your bread longer than the recipe indicates.  I didn't and my bread was kind of smooshed together.  I used fresh herbs and that made a huge difference!

Add me to the list that love this stuffing.  Only change I made was to use Stove Top whole bread crumbs (no S.T, seasoning) because that is what I had on hand.

My family requests this recipe every Thanksgiving now.  I love the cranberries, but I have to leave them out as my husband doesn't like them.  I use fresh herbs when I make this and my kitchen smells wonderful.

Delicious stuffing.  I made the mistake of adding too much turkey stock and chicken broth and diluted the nuances of the stuffing.  You put so much time into preparing all the ingredients I wish I had kept it more simple so they could all have been noticed - like the dried cranberries which cost a fortune but taste right near raisins.

YUM!  I left out the liver and the cranberries (picky kids), and used Jimmy Dean sage sausage, which cooks to a nice crumble.  Chicken broth works well in place of turkey stock.  Delicious, and a big hit with my very first turkey this year!  :)

I tried this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was fantastic! My fiance (who doesn't like stuffing or fruit) liked it, and our guests asked for the recipe. It probably was the best stuffing I've ever had.  I used Emeril's chicken and apple stuffing (which was great), almost 2 cups of stock since I wasn't stuffing the bird, and I substituted whole wheat bread cubes with corn bread cubes.  I also omitted rosemary and liver. Perfect stuffing!

I followed the recipe to a T and was not impressed with the complexity of flavors or texture with the sausage.  I'll stick with my tried and true sage dressing.

This was soo good.  I have never made stuffing before but it was excellent!  I used pork sausage instead of turkey because it was all I could find at the time.  Left out the liver and used chicken broth instead of turkey stock.  I did not stuff the turkey with it.  Instead I used twice the amount of broth and baked it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  The only other change I would make is to add more bread.  It was mostly sausage.  But so good!

Tried this for the first time yesterday but this turned out wonderful! I used chicken broth instead of turkey stock, brownberry's unseasoned bread cubes for the bread, dried minced onion out off our spice shelf for the onions, and the maple sausage in place of the turkey sausage. We also skipped the turkey liver. This was everyone's favorite by far. People are still calling the next day to rave about the stuffing and ask what was in it.

I used this recipe as this was my first time cooking for thanksgiving, and the stuffing came out delicious. I made it was a little more bread cubes just to make sure I had enough, and it was great. I used turkey sausage as well and was very pleased. This stuffing is very fragrant and smells sooo delicious when making it! I will use this again, thank you!

I made this for the first time yesterday and everyone loved it! I used italian turkey sausage and homemade fat free chicken broth. I made the bread and the sausage mixture the night before and mixed everything together the next day and put it in the oven next to the turkey.

Will definitely be keeping this recipe to use from now on!

This recipe replaces my beloved traditional celery and bread dressing.  It is truly "awesome" and deserves that name.  There is a depth of flavor with a little added sweetness to the earthy sage and sausage.  I made a few alterations.  I omitted the liver and parsley.  I used chicken stock and regular pork sausage.  I used a Fuji apple (my favorite).  Yum!  Definitely my new Thanksgiving stuffing recipe.

The verdict is in: it's a keeper!  First Thanksgiving my guests have enjoy the stuffing.  Stuffed it into the bird is better than baked on its own (because of the big portion, I ended up having to do it both ways).  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone loved this stuffing!  My husband was all skeptical about the apples and cranberries in it, but he RAVED over it!  I used a bag of prepared bread stuffing instead of cubing and toasting the whole wheat and white breads myself.  Like other reviewers, I added an extra apple, left out the turkey liver, and threw in some white wine.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan.  This will become a regular Thanksgiving dish.  Thank you!  I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving!

I omitted the turkey liver and added a bit more turkey stock. I used turkey sausage instead of pork and next time I will reduce the about by about 25%; I felt it was a little too strong on the sausage. Otherwise, wonderful recipe. My new favorite!

At family functions during the holidays, I am now asked to make my stuffing!  I have used this recipe many times since I discovered it last year, and I get raves.  No one in my or my husband's families ever puts fruit in their stuffing, so everyone likes the apples and cranberries.

Amazing! My Husband was a little wary at first as were some of my guests (they are used to the bread being crushed), but I ended up running out after making 19 servings for 11 guests!! I stuffed my turkey, and then baked the leftovers in the oven. I used cut up pork sausages, which turned out quite nicely. The distinct flavors in this dish are quite heavenly!

I made this with veggie sausage, it came out really dry but still had a great flavor.  I have also made it with pork sausage, and it was wonderful.  I didn't put the turkey liver or cranberry's in it either time I made it.  I also added some chopped nuts both times.  Its a great stuffing recipe.

This is the best stuffing ever! I've made it 3 times with turkey now all for different guests and got rave reviews every time. You can't go wrong! This is the first and only recipe I will use. Everyone commented that it had a very fresh taste to it. Yummy!

This is by far my favourite stuffing recipe.  I don't think I would make any other stuffing than this!  I use chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  Spectacular flavours... I can never make enough.  Your dinner will become stuffing with a side order of turkey... it's that good. PLEASE use double the amount of fresh herbs. This is a MUST.

This was the most wonderful, flavorful, delicious dressing I've ever had.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving and my sister took the recipe back to Michigan and fixed it for Christmas for the rest of my family members.  Most of them "raved" about how great it tasted... of course you can't please everyone.  I will definitely make this again.

This was the best stuffing I have ever had!  The only change I made was using dried parsley instead of fresh & I had no rosemary.  Everyone else loved it too, even those who don't like cranberries enjoyed them in this.  I did lose some interest when I told them that the turkey liver was in the stuffing. For the stock, I used the water that I cooked the turkey liver in.

WONDERFUL.  Had to sub for several hard to find items, instead used chiken broth, ground trukey, and omitted the liver, but this is the best stuffing I've ever had.  I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and plan to make it again in a few days for Christmas, and will continue for years to come.(also cooked it outside of the turkey)

This is very good -- I lessened the turkey stock since it was too moist.  Also, omitted the turkey liver.

This was great.  My husband (who was a little suspect at first) has already requested this for next year's Thanksgiving.  I also had some "low fat health nuts" indulge on second servings.

For an added kick, try substituting pork chorizo sausage and cooking this in a non-stick baking pan at 350 degrees for one hour or until brown.  The spiciness of the sausage nicely complimented the sweetness of the apples and tartness of the cranberries.

Made this for Thanksgiving and found it just average.  I was looking forward to trying it because of the stellar reviews it has received here.  Man, was I disappointed!  Everything just blended together too seamlessly - it had no punch.  Maybe it should have had some salt added or even pepper. It just didn't do it for me. Honestly, Stovetop Stuffing has more flavour...I wouldn't call it "awesome" - "okay" is more like it.

I scaled this for 20 people and served it to my family for Thanksgiving.  Instead of putting the stuffing in the bird, I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees in a baking dish while the turkey was "resting".  Of all the dished served, this one was pretty much gone by the end of the night - almost no leftovers!!! What an awesome recipe!! Thanks!!!

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving along with the Awesome Turkey Giblet Stock. They both came out wonderful. I doubled the recipe for the stuffing (20 lb bird) I put half in the turkey and baked the other half. I think next time I will leave the cranberries out (not a big fan) the recipe did go over quite well with my guests. I also did leave out the liver in the stuffing and it was still great. I will use this as my stuffing recipe in the future and I will also play around with it when stuffing pork chops etc.
Very Good...Thanks for sharing!

I stuffed the bird with this, but I wish I had just baked it.  I also will chop the dried cranberries next time (I added them whole) to distribute the flavor.  Also, I feel like I couldn't taste the apple, so maybe another one next time I make it.  It wasn't a big hit with guests, but I loved it, so I think that should count for something.  :0)

I hate stuffing and I thought this recipe was awesome!! This was the first Thanksgiving that I actually had stuffing. I added chopped walnuts, omitted the liver, and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock. Also, I didn't stuff the turkey with it, I just put it in a casserole dish and baked it for 30 minutes at 375. It came out perfect! This will be the only stuffing I ever make!

This recipe is super! The flavors mix together wonderfully. However, next time I make it I will cut the amount of sausage in half. But, that is the only thing I would change.

I thought this recipe would be good for Thanksgiving.  I didn't use it in the bird, I fry my turkeys.  I thought the recipe was okay.  Mostly the adults seemed to like it better than the kids.  I feel that it could have used more cranberries, they seemed to have gotten lost in the stuffing.  Otherwise, tasty.

Loved this stuffing!  Has become my families favorite stuffing. I dont add as many cranberries as recipe calls for because I cannot find dried cranberries that arent sweetened and I dont care for the added sugar.  Excellent!  Highly Recommend!

I absolutely loved this recipe. It was a little time consuming to make, but well worth it. I used lean ground turkey instead of sausage, and chicken broth instead of turkey stock and it was wonderful. I would definately make this again, not only to stuff a turkey, but also as a great side dish with pork!!! Thanks!

This was DELICIOUS!  I used this recipe to stuff a turkey breast and then cooked the extra on the side (minus the turkey liver).  I made this meal for my parents and as we were clearing the table my mom didn't want me to take away the stuffing! She finished the small amount left in the casserole dish.

Great start of a recipe, but only 4 stars since I change it up to suit our tastes.  First, I never, ever stuff the turkey - it is only used as a dressing, so the moisture has to be adjusted.  I use part corn bread (not the sweet kind) instead of all bread and then adjust the seasonings for our taste.  I add more broth - this is where corn bread works better than all wheat/white bread because it doesn't "break down" like the other breads when it gets moistened.  A tart apple is the only way to go, so I use a Granny Smith.  Fabulous with any dried fruit you like - I've made it with cranberries, cherries, blueberries and combinations of various fruits.  I prefer the flavor of a hot Italian sausage instead of a turkey sausage.

Delicious, classic, stuffing--what stuffing should be.  I, too, made it with dried cherries, and it was a great blend of rich and tart flavors.  I will be making this recipe every thanksgiving from now on!!

The flavors in this recipe are perfect.  The ratio of spice/sweet/salt is absolutely divine.  The only reason this isn't a five-star recipe to me is that it should be a dressing rather than a stuffing.  My bread sorta disintegrated in the bird and if your broth that goes into the recipe is good and strong (as mine was), then maybe you really don't need the cavity after all...(sounds sorts Q-E doesn't it?)

This sidedish was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner!! Even though I am a vegetarian, I was able to subsitute with wonderful results by using fake sausage (boca italian soy sausages) and vegetable broth. I will definitely be making this dish again next year.

This is completely worth the preparation time! I used 1/2 sage-flavored pork sausage and 1/2 reduced-fat pork sausage, reduced the sage, and added more broth for moisture. I'll be making this again!

This recipe was good, but, I did not realize until after it was complete that I am not a sage person, I would have omitted it because it was a little on the heavy side, otherwise, the rest was really good.

I was making Thanksgiving Dinner for the first time. This recipe was great. I didn't use the turkey liver but it came out wonderful. I will use it again and again.

WOW!  This was the first time I ever made stuffing.  It was fantastic...and there were NO leftovers!  I used chicken broth instead of turkey broth, left out the turkey liver, and replaced the turkey sausage with ground sweet italian sausage.  It was VERY easy to make and is definately to become a permanent part of future Thanksgiving dinners.  I recommend this recipe to even the most novice of chefs!

Fantastic.  I will make this every Thanksgiving.  I didn't use the liver and I used Bell Seasoning and more chicken broth than called for.  Everyone loved this and was the hit.  I can't wait to make it again.

This stuffing was great and received many compliments. I added a little more butter and substituted chicken broth for the turkey stock. It was fantastic!

My husband does not like stuffing, but this recipe he loved!  It's a different kind of stuffing.  It's crunchy, not soft.  I will be making this every year from now on.  Thanks!

this was a great balance between tart & savory flavors. I made some without the turkey sausage for my vegetariam daughter and it was good, too. I added a but more broth than was called for but I like stuffing moist. It worked well both inside & outside-baked-in-a-dish. A great tip: use a slice of bread to "seal" the stuffing inside the bird and I also put 2 slies over the extra which was baked in a loaf pan to keep it from drying out and that worked well.

Wow.....this is the best stuffing I have ever made.  Everyone raved about it and had second (and in some cases) third helpings. I did make a few substitutions after reading the reviews...Italian sausage and a figi apple. I also omitted the turkey liver. Delicious recipe that will continue to be part of our Thanksgiving tradition.

We made this for a thanksgiving meal put together by the freshmen at FSU's BCM, it was all Kristen's idea too (hey girl!) we couldn't find everything, we used vegetable stock and half turkeyhalf pork sausage because the turkey sausage was sooo expensive and left out the liver and thyme. we made enough for 110 people and it was really really good. im making this in a week for a thanksgiving family reunion.

I moved to England a few years ago and started celebrating Thanksgiving with our friends here.  I used this recipe last year and everyone LOVED it...even my very picky Irish in-laws! It has been requested again this year by all of my guests.  Excellent recipe!

Since I started "doing" Thanksgiving at my house I have more flexibility in what is served.  I make 2 stuffings, The stand by traditional homemade bread stuffing and a "different" kind.  I love stuffing.  So last thanksgiving I made this one because of all the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe to a t but it was kinda gross.  No one ate seconds.  We actually had to throw the left overs of this stuffing out.  Never happens.  I think my brother liked it though.  I don't believe I will make this again.  Like another reviewer said you will either love it or hate it.  I will still continue looking for another stuffing and make my grandmas traditional stuffing as well.

This was a good stuffing.  Next time I will reduce the amount of rosemary (personal preference) and add extra cranberries and apples.  I am also going to try it with cornbread.  This won't replace our usual Thanksgiving stuffing, but this will be a nice addition to occasional dinners.

The flavor of this was very good.  Mine came out slightly dry, think I could have added more stock and may have over-cooked a little, but will make again.  Thanks.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  The cranberries added such a great flavor.  I used Jimmy Dean regular sausage in the roll instead of turkey sausage.  I think this will be our new stuffing tradition from now on.

This was fantastic.  I hate stuffing but I couldn't get enough of this.  I had bought a prestuffed turkey for Christmas because it cooks from frozen and I made a side of this stuffing the day before.  I just heated it up in the microwave.  Amazing!

Hmmm... nobody ate this, but I think it was because the company was used to eating "boxed" stuffing. It had a dry look to it, I guess I could have added more water. I got the cranberry with cherry flavor, I liked it. My husband requested me to make stuffing for christmas, but he didn't even eat it. Not sure what went wrong. It smells great while cooking!

I made this for Christmas eve dinner and it was great.  I used turkey sasuage, and more wheat bread then white.  I left out the sage and liver and used some dried cranberries and raisins.  All in all, it was very good!!  Husband is doing the dishes and the baby is heading to bed, what a great day!

this recipe was great! Everyone in my family loved it.  I used smoked turkey sausage because I could not find any ground and I think this was a good idea.  The sausage wasn't overpowering.  I also used quite a bit more stock than it called for and I actually used chicken stock.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this again.

Most Excellent! I used Bob Evans Sage sausage instead of turkey sausage and it was fantastic. The apples, cranberries and sausage make a wonderful flavor combination! I didn't have unsalted butter so I used regular and it didn't seem to make a difference. I will make this again next Thanksgiving!

Thank you Stacy!  This was my first time making stuffing and it was a true knockout!  Everyone loved it!  It was so simple and was truly delicious!  I don't even like stuffing and I loved this!

I've never made stuffing from scratch but I did this year for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly (but used the original pork sausage). At first I thought it would be a bit too overwhelming with all the herbs but it turned out fine.  I would highly recommend this dish not only because it's easy to make but because it's fantastic.

Very delicious-one problem was that it was too dry though.  It didn't taste nearly as good the next day.

I have never liked stuffing, but I wanted to try to make one for Thanksgiving. I decided to give this one a try, and I am so glad that I did.  This is the best ever!  It took a little while to make, but it was spicy and tasty.  I got great compliments on it.
