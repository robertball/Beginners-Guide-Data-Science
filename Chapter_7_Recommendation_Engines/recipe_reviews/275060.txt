Delicious potatoes - instead of cooking garlic
in butter - take a whole head of garlic and slice of the top to expose - put the head of garlic on
sheet of foil and drizzle with a little olive oil, seal foil and set in small oven-proof dish - let cook
40-45 mins while roasting your turkey - take out let cool a little and squeeze the creamy roasted garlic into the potatoes - yum

Delicious if you’re a garlic lover like me (since it’s heavy on the garlic flavor). I might try half and half instead of milk next time to make it even creamier.
