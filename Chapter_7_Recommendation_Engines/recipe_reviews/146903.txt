Due to the other reviews I cut the butter and vinegar in half and skipped the mushrooms.  It was a huge success.  I can't even imagine what it would have tasted like had I followed the original recipe.  I served it with steak and a sliced tomato & mozarella salad.

This recipe was overpowered by to much vinegar. There was also way to much butter. I felt like I wasted my time and ingredients because the sauce was terrible.

Very Good. I was looking for some gnocchi receipes and glad I stompled onto this recipe. I added sliced sausage to the recipe to make it into a meal and my family loved it.

5 stars with the changes I made. I used twice the amount of veggies to give it a healthy boost, and I used button mushrooms quartered instead of the crimini mushrooms. I used only 2 tbsps butter and added the vinegar to taste (maybe 1/6 or 1/8 C?). I added 3/4 cup chicken boullion with about 1-2 tbsps white flour in it to make more and a thicker sauce. I also added about 1/2 cup shredded chicken to give it some protein. Now it's a complete meal! I loved and so did my husband.

Excellent recipe. The secret is to make sure that you simmer the sauce long enough. The balsamic vinegar is delicious in this recipe and it is now being added to our recipe book.

Wasn't amazing, but a decent tasting recipe. I chose to leave out the butter and replace it with some chicken stock. Some added smoked sausage made it a complete meal.

I was really disapointed with this recipe.  It wasn't that flavorful and it called for way too much butter.  I will not cook it again.

What a fabulous side dish, next time I'll consider making it a main dish.  Took the advice of previous raters and omitted the mushrooms and only added 1/4 c balsamic and 1/4 c butter.  I'll be making this recipe again for sure!

It was all right.  I love balsamic, but I'll use less next time.

OMG!  My husband & I loved it.  I saved some for myself for lunch the next day.  How I know it was good also: my husband will normally only eat homemade gnocchis.  It is absolutely fantastic.

This is so yummy!  I too followed the other readers advice and cut the balsamic and butter - did 1/4 and 1/2 cup respectively.  The flavors are just so nice together - will definitely be making this again and emailed the recipe to family and friends!

I should have read the reviews for this before cooking it.

This recipe had way too much balsamic vinegar, and too much butter ( I cut it in half and it was still a lot).  The taste of it was very good, but incredibly strong and I could only eat a few bites.

This also seemed like it would be better as a side than an entree and I intend to take the leftovers from last night and cut down the vinegar by serving them with some pork for dinner tonight.

Was a good dish overall. I followed the recipe and would definitely not dice the onions and would also not add as much balsamic vinegar. Definitely going to try again

I am glad I followed the reviews of 1/2 butter and the balsamic. I really enjoyed this dish and the leftovers reheated well.

Awesome IF you greatly reduce the amount of butter and balsamic vinegar...by half at least, or even more.

Recipe, as written, is not good. Way too much butter and vinegar. The flavors are great with the gnocchi if cut in half if not more. Great way to use sweet peppers though.

I used this recipe to introduce my boys to gnocchi and they LOVED it.  I cut the butter in half and added red wine to accomodate what I had in the house.  I also cubed a leftover steak and added that at the end to make it a full meal.  It is very heavy on the balsamic, so if you don't love vinegar I would cut it back.
