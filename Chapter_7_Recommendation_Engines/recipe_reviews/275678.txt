Tastes great...and easy enough.
One BIG step missing though...
After you bread the tomatoes, let them sit on a rack for 10 minutes before you fry them. The breading then has time to adhere to whatever you're frying and less breading falls off during the process. 
This is true for all breaded and fried foods.
