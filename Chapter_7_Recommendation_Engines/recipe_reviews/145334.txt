This was great for a quick breakfast for my kids. I didn't use the ice cream topping or the coconut--my kids are plenty hyped up anyway and don't need the extra sugar. They loved it! Paired with a fruit smoothie, this made a quick and easy breakfast that made everyone happy.

Great snack! I used a whole grain English muffin and low sugar strawberry jam. I waited until the peanut butter was nice and "melty". I love the addition of the banana slices! I opted not to use the coconut or hot fudge ice cream topping as I thought it was overkill.

Yummy!!! Anything with Peanut butter is great. Not to mention this recipe is on the healthier side of this sinfully good dessert pizza.

I give this 4 stars for it's creativity. My kids have eaten the standard peanut butter and jelly for years and to come across this is great! i let my kids put it together and top it the way they want to.
