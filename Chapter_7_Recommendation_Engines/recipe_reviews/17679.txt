I added shredded cheese to the cream mixture, and sauted a lot of garlic and onion before mixing the pasta with the cream sauce. And it was really good!!

Excellent pasta, and very easy try adding fresh spring peas, it adds a nice punch of color and a nice fresh taste.

This wasnt really good. It was bland and had too much dill in my opinion. I usually love creamy pasta, and dill, but this was too much. I think that kids might like it, though. For me it was just ok.

Just attempted this one.  Not bad but I did take the advice of the people saying it was too bland and added some chicken sauteed with garlic and the mushrooms as well as shredded cheddar to the recipe.

This was too bland!  I should have read the review first.  If I make it again I may try to spice it up with more garlic maybe some red pepper flakes.

I did not like this recipe, first off, I think the directions are wrong.  I think you are supposed to put the cream sauce in a pot and cook before putting in the pasta, I did exactly as the directions said.  Was not good.  Threw out and the rest as well.  I wish some people would proofread before they submit...

The recipe is an excellant start.   a little more seasoning like garlic and pepper.  I also added crab and broccoli to make it a little heartier.

Yeah, I'm 50/50 on this one too.  It's unusual and I don't find it bland.  The directions are a bit scattered, but a sensible cook should figure out what they mean if they've had any experience.  Adding more flavors like garlic and onions would make a difference, but the tang from the dill and sour cream is something we have to get used to here in the midwest.

I added this to my recipe box and prepared it yesterday. My family loved it and there are no leftovers. I did add chicken to it because I had some left over cooked chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe. We did not find it bland at all. We found it comforting since we have just moved into our new home and have boxes everywhere!

This was pretty good but I would cut the amount of pasta in half, I didn't think there was enough sauce. Next time I would add garlic and cut the amount of dill in half, it was too overpowering.
