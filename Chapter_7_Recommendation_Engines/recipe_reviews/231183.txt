I love this recipe. It's so easy.  I read reviews and added another banana for more banana taste.  I, also, used banana creme pudding instead of vanilla.  I used thinly sliced almonds instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand.  Oh my gosh!! My grandchildren were thrilled to wake up Saturday morning with this amazing smell wafting through the house. I would think many different cake mixes, fruits, and puddings could be substituted...mmmmmm pumpkin added instead of bananas.  It could be endless depending on one's imagination.

Amazingly easy and so yummy! I just wish it had more of a banana flavor to it but it didn't take long to disappear in this house. I made this again and added a extra banana and did not hurt it at all.

I just tried this recipe, but used walnuts instead of pecans (because I got the wrong nuts when I went to the store), and used banana cake mix and pudding, 3 bananas, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and it is incredible! Truly a banana nut bread that is easy and will make your loved ones go bananas!

I loved that this recipe is so quick and easy, just dump everything in the same bowl and mix it up. I added an extra banana at the advice of the other reviews. Another recipe on this site calls for banana pudding instead of vanilla pudding. That might give it more banana flavor. This recipe was moist, but I still prefer the flavor of traditional banana bread. I like to add spices to my banana breads-cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, but I didn't try that with this recipe, I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the cake mix. Overall a good recipe when you want to make a quick loaf of banana bread.

I added a little cinnamon/sugar to top for a sweet crust and pinch of salt to batter before baking. Time and temp are perfectly set. I have never had a recipe turn out so perfect! Now just waiting for it to cool so I can taste it.

This recipe is easy and tastes so good! I make this quite often and we eat on one loaf and then put the other one in freezer. I like the shortcut of using cake mix and a few other ingredients and your done!

Love this! I sub 1/2 C applesauce for 2 of the eggs, and do part applesauce and part oil to make the 1/2C (heavier on the oil). Family loves this bread! I usually cook it in a 9x13 cake pan for 45 min, the timing seems to work better and the cake seems to last longer somehow than a loaf in my house!

I used 9x13 pan since I couldn’t find my loaf pans. Took the same amount of time to bake. Its been 4 hours since I made it and half the pan is gone already. I’d say it was a hit. Super easy to make, taste great!

Great recipe and easy. I added lemon juice to the water to bring to 1/2 cup. Also added chocolate chips but they weren't necessary...just cleaning out my cupboard. I will make again for sure.

Loved it had to turn the temp down to 325 and cook for an additional 20 minutes but turned out GREAT.  I used milk instead of water. Also I used metal pans instead of glass.

I made this today.  I didn't have pudding but my cake mix was extra moist, and I made 5 small loaves, and I used 1 cup per small pan and cooked 30 minutes instead of 45.  very nice and it is easy.

Are used three bananas and one cup of toasted walnuts. The third banana made it a bit more more moist than bread and rather cake like however it was still quite delicious. My only complaint, I chopped the walnuts smaller than  wish I would have, but that being said it's still a delicious --  time saving way to make banana nut bread with minimal cleanup after.

The only change I made was the pudding, using banana cream instead.  This recipe will now be my go to when my husband is craving banana bread.  It's really moist and very easy to make.

This is delicious!  Easy to make, fairly low in sugar, and uses up all those past-due bananas.

OMG good!  I used 3 bananas instead of two and only a 1/4 cup of pecans.  The first loaf was gone in 15 minutes.  Best when warm and a little butter on top.

I found this recipe and was SO excited that I had all the ingredients.  I did add another bannana as others have mentioned, a little cinnamon and nutmeg.   I just could not get the  bread to cook thru to my liking.  It is very moist mostly because of the pudding.   I liked the idea of adding the pudding but will most likely try less of the pudding package next time.

EXCELLENT.......turned out SUPER MOIST and I would make this again but as a cake, left in the pan frosted with cream cheese icing.  
I followed the recipe for the most part but:  
Subbed milk for the water
Used coconut oil in place of veggie oil
Added 1 extra banana for more flavor AND......because I love pineapple I added 1 small can of crushed, juice and all.
(I know, I know......I didn't follow the recipe to the letter)   I have to say mine had a fantastic "tropical" flavor and WOW!  CAN YOU SAY MOIST?!  Anyway.....for me this is a total keeper but as a cake.  (next time I am adding some coconut in too)  P.S. I did not put nuts in.
OH!  1 more THING!  Someone asked how to NOT "burn" your bread!!!  I ALWAYS, ALWAYS bake my banana bread in a countertop Nesco baker and I have NEVER burned a loaf of banana bread.......ever!  It's a better cooking method then an oven.  GOOD LUCK!

I used walnuts as I had no pecans, and I put a thick swirl of nutella down the middle and then swirled in throughout the bread. This was a big hit!

I added an extra banana as some reviews suggested, and didn't add nuts. I baked in cupcake liners 21-23 mins and they turned out perfectly! I think they are good but VERY sweet so don't bother with glaze or icing.

Simply the easiest banana bread I've ever made. I also added an extra banana and used banana pudding as suggested by others. I made 5 mini loafs. Cooked then for 40 min. At 340 degrees. Came out perfect! YUM!!

For the person whose bread was always burned on the bottom. Try turning your oven down 25 degrees and let it go about an hour. That should take care of the burned bottom. This is a good recipe for quick bread when you just want something sweet or for breakfast but don't want to haul out the flour, sugar, etc.

This was so good and moist! One of my favorite recipes! Instead of pecans, I used half cup of crushed walnuts and half cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Even my nine year old sister, who HATES nuts, loved it!

Great recipes for quick fixes! I switched cashews for pecans, added a banana and used French Vanilla pudding!
Next, I'm going to try a zucchini version.

I made it as the recipe stated.  Except after it was a mess I noticed the cake mix called for is 18.25 and pudding is 3.5. This was a disaster I had to throw out to the birds.  Then I went to the store and all the cake mixes were 15.25 and puddings 1.5 or 5 oz.  Totally messed up.

Easiest banana nut bread! I will continue making it like this. I did use banana pudding mix instead of vanilla and added double banana. I made one pan with chocolate chips and it was delish! Love this easy and delicious recipe!

I tweaked the recipe with a Red Velvet cake mix, omitted any nuts, used three bananas, and semi-sweet chocolate chips as an addition, both in the mix and on top. The baking time needed about 4 more minutes, but after it cooled, it sliced up and now we call it Vampire Bread. The oil and water additions were spot on, and the 4 eggs gave it fluff and density, which we all loved! I love this recipe and go to it all the time for the basics of ingredients/baking time and alter it to what I have on hand. Thank You all so much for your input.
