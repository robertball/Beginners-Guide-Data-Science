Okay...I just tried this and LOVED it! I ended up using peaches, strawberries and blueberries! And I scaled it down to one serving...just for me! I didn't have any sugar cookies, so I used strawberry Cheerios! This was VERY good! Great recipe LTH!

This was a 4th of July hit!  I followed the directions for the cream cheese layer, but only used blueberries and strawberries to follow the red, white, and blue theme.  FYI, I used a 1/4 cup of blueberries for the bottom layer and two heaping tablespoons of strawberries for the top layer.  I sprinkled some toffee chips on the top too for crunch and flavor.  Like I said, this was a huge hit.  I love not having to bring food back home from a party.  :)

Instead of making these "to go," I scaled the recipe to 2 servings as a snack for my preschooler and me. She had trouble getting the cream from the bottom of the cup and in the end had cream leftover. I think there is enough mixture that you could make 2 layers of fruit and cream, and that would help incorporate throughout the cup. These were tasty and fun; thanks for the idea!

made this for a womens book group, and it was wonderful!  everyone wanted the recipe.  My only advice is that after a while the cookies can get soggy and it is much better with crisp cookies.  Put them together at the last minute.

These were great!  I made as written with the exception of using canned pineapple and frozen bluberries.  It was pretty and delicious.  I will definitely make again.  It's something my kids enjoyed helping with.  I'm looking forward to trying with different fruit combos and also may try almond or amaretto flavor instead of vanilla in the cream cheese.  Thank you "lovestohost"!  It's a keeper!!
