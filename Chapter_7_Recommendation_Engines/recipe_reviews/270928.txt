The second I cut into this and took a bite, I'm pretty sure I heard angels singing. WOW! Totally worth the wait and how I'm going to make my roasts from now on. This totally had the flavor of prime rib, at a fraction of the cost.   The only thing I did different was I seared in the oven for 15 mins instead of 20. I also didn't bother trussing the roast and it was just fine.  I can't wait to make this for company! The simple au jus is fantastic as well!
