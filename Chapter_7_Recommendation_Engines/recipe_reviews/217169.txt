Hi Everyone - This is my recipe.  Onion juice can be found at most grocery stores.  You can find it in the spice aisle.  DO NOT USE immitation onion juice - it makes a difference.    (I've never tried making my own onion juice, but I'll look forward to others that try it and post results - see editor's note.)  This recipe makes a lot of dressing.  You can refrigerate the left-over dressing for a long time to have on-hand.  Enjoy!

This salad dressing is fantastic!  Better than any poppyseed salad dressing I have ever had.  Had to go to two stores for the onion juice, but it was worth it.

WOW..very good dressing, I used a Blendtec blender on the dressing button to make this dressing, and pulsed in the poppy seeds at the end and it came out perfectly emulsified and creamy..I used 1/2 Sugar and 1/2 Splenda..I used it for a slaw recipe of cabbage, carrots and raisins...I can't wait to try on a spinach salad..yum...also followed editors note and made my own onion juice (I pureed 1/2 a med onion in a mini chopper and pressed thru a fine strainer)

I am on the Ideal Protein diet and don't like any of the other "diet" salad dressings. I adjusted the servings to one, then substituted 1 pkt Splenda for sugar, sea salt for salt, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and just slightly less vinegar. It is delicious, I drizzled it on grilled chicken and zucchini. I'll be using this all the time.

Yummy, thank you for sharing the recipe.  Missed the part about how to make onion juice the first time around so we will try that in the future.  We used sesame seeds because I didn't have poppy seeds.  It was still nice but I'm sure it tastes fantastic with poppy seeds. Since we've been living in TZ the past 3 years and eating less processed foods, I find I have to cut the sugar in EVERYTHING because our taste buds have changed. This recipe was no exception.

It was very tasty!  Couldn't find onion juice at the grocery store, so puréed a small onion in a mini food processor and squeezed purée through a small sieve.

A very good substitute for store bought dressing.  Made as directed, juicing the onion in the blender for the onion juice, but did not strain the juice, just measured straight into the mix.  Thanks for sharing.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar to make the recipe more diabetic friendly, but otherwise used the ingredients as stated, though I made just one-fourth of the recipe to try it out.  I did, however, change the technique.  I added all ingredients except the oil and the poppy seeds to the bowl of a food processor and mixed.  Then I added the oil gradually through the top of the processor bowl with the motor running.  The dressing emulsified well this way.  I added the poppy seeds at the end and just pulsed a few times.

This was a tasty dressing which I used today over mixed greens.  Tomorrow I plan to add a few kiwi slices and mandarin oranges with the greens and use this dressing again.  Next time I make the dressing, I'll probably use a bit less sweetener, as it seems just a little sweeter than I prefer, but as a diabetic I'm used to things less sweet.

This is an AMAZING recipe!  Everyone who tries it,loves it.  I even gave it in fancy little jars for Christmas gifts. Thanks so much. 
 I use it on a spinach salad with candied pecans (or candied bacon), goat cheese. blueberries and red onion.

Couldn't find onion juice so I used my microplane which grated the onion into a fine, watery "baby food" consistency.  It blended perfectly into the dressing.  My husband and I agree, this dressing is better than the one our favorite restaurant makes.

Alley, I've made this more times than I can remember & my family continues to still ask for it.  I had  an old copy from 2013 & needed to reprint;  had a difficult time finding it on Allrecipes; found it when I googled, thank goodness because my copy was too worn to copy for anyone else.  I will say this to everyone......the onion juice does make the difference.  Chop your onion extra fine then squeeze it through cheesecloth!  Believe me it's worth the effort.  Enjoy!

I have made this at least 10 times and it is consistently well received.  While it is too sweet to serve all the time, it is a staple in our house.

I saw this recipe a few years ago in a magazine and loved it.  Went to look for it recently to no avail.  Thank goodness it was in Allrecipes.  It is an excellent dressing.  If  you change the recipe then you cannot ''rate''it as it is y ours and not as on this site. It is a light sweet recipe perfect for a spinach salad with fresh strawberries; on a grilled chicken wrap; wherever you like. Lovely. Thanks for sharing.

I find this dressing too oily in consistency for me.  I prefer the poppyseed dressing made with mayo.  These dressings pack a lot of calories, so I'm going to try making the mayo variety with unsweetened Greek yogurt next time.

This was waayyyy too sweet!  I'd cut the sugar in half to start! After I doubled the other ingredients & added some apple cider vinegar, it was tolerable.

Great taste. I couldn't find onion juice and substitued onion powder instead. Probably not as good, but still very tasty. I did find it a bit sweet when it was done so I added the juice of a fresh lemon which added to the flavor and cut the sweetness.
