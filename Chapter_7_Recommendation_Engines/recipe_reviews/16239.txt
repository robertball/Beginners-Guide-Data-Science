I have made several times--my teenagers love it.  I do make a couple of changes.   I  add garlic, black pepper, (just a dash)   and a couple of tablespoons of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce. AND a little more salt.  Use a heavy beer--no lite stuff--  It REALLY helps the flavor--gives it more depth.   After a couple of different cuts of beef, I've found a siroin tip roast to be the best.    Also if you let it cool a few minutes before slicing and add back to the juices for a while, it is much more flavorful.  I love the buttered rolls with the au jus---melt provolone cheese under the broiler--yum!

This was amazing.  I took a lot of advise from others.  I used a chuck roast, Campbell’s Consommé, a can of Campbell’s French Onion Soup, added garlic powder, onion powder, a touch of worcestershire, and only half a can of beer.  It took me 5 minutes to throw everything into the cooker.  When I came home I sliced it up and put it back into the juice for another hour.  I buttered the rolls and added shredded mozzarella cheese and threw them under the broiler until the cheese melted.  This was a huge hit.  My family loved it.  Not at all dry.  They can't wait for me to make it again.  Trust me when I tell you this was the best/easiest dinner.  You've gotta try it!

Wish I could make it 10 stars!! This recipe tales TIME..to cook, don't rush it! Slice your beef about 1/2 hr before you want to serve it and return it to juice. Wow!!! But wait, the next day take the leftover juice with bits of beef and make French onion soup with it. Serve over the leftover french bread in a bowl with cheese and slip it under the broiler for a minute. The BEST!!

I've relied on this recipe so many times before finally getting around to reviewing it. It's that good, and that easy. I always use a chuck roast. Even though it may not slice well, I believe it has superior flavor and is really well suited to slow cooking. It shreds up nicely, and is easy to spoon onto rolls for sandwiches. I use Guiness Draught, tho' I'm sure most any beer would work well, and I also add a few shakes of garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.

I tried this recipe as is the first time and found it lacked some definitive quality.  The second time I put the meat into the cooker with 1 pkt onion soup mix and 2c. beef broth, and added 1 sprig Rosemary, 1 large garlic clove, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp thyme and 1/4 c. soya sauce.  I served this with French Bread Rolls to Die fOR.  Raves from all my guests.  Perfect with changes.

This is SOOOOO YUMMMMY!!!... My husband and I love it!!... I made just a few changes..I sprinkled my roast with some garlic powder and worchestire sauce when I put it in the crockpot.. I also added a can of mushrooms (drained).. When the meat was ready to be sliced I took it out and sliced it very thin and even shredded a few pieces, then put the meat back in the crockpot for 30 more minutes to soak into the juice.. I didnt put butter on our french bread, instead I toasted it with some shredded mozarella on it... The juice is so good and it smelled so good while it was cooking.. While I was slicing the meat my husband was eating it right out of the crockpot!!!...LOL..He has already requested it for next weekend when we have friends coming over..

Holy Moly!!  Yum!!  I added the onion salt as suggested, also added garlic salt and minced garlic to taste,1 tea. worchestershire sauce, and had fesh mushrooms to throw in.  I also sliced it thin and put it back in the juice to steep a short time.  I put in on the toasted buns with Provalone cheese.  This was awesome.  I have leftover juices and thin slice beef to use as leftovers.  I'll heat, thicken with cornstarch and serve over noodles.  My husband will be in heaven again.  Thank you for sharing.  Pepperocini Beef was also five stars.  Don't miss these two recipes.

FANTASTIC! MUCH better than any French dip recipe I've tried (including Giselle's French dips, another popular AR recipe). I waited quite a while to try this for 2 reasons. First, I had such a mediocre experience w/ Giselle's recipe, I wasn't in any hurry to make French dips again. Second, I thought these would be SUPER bland. Boy, was I wrong! :) Having said this, I did make a few minor changes. I rubbed my roast w/ .5 t ea. garlic / onion salt & pepper & added 1 T W sauce / .5 t of minced garlic to my crockpot. My beer of choice was 1554 (a dark ale made by New Belgium Brewing Co. - the same company that produces Fat Tire). I used plain 'ol beef broth, but next time I'm gonna use beef consomme (it's more concentrated / stronger). There are a couple of things to note: First & foremost, use a DARK beer. A stout or dark ale is perfect. Light beers will leave you w/ weak au jus. Next, a rump roast is also referred to as a bottom round roast. A chuck roast will also work, but will make your au jus greasy (it's a fatty cut of meat) & won't slice nicely (it's great for shredded dips). Finally, remove your meat, allow to rest for 10 min. & thinly slice / add back to the sc for ~ an hr. (to soak up the flavor of the au jus). Homemade onion rolls (claudygirl) toasted w/ garlic butter, piled w/ provolone / sauteed onions, spread w/ horsey sauce, broiled & served w/ au jus made for AWESOME samies. :-) I bet leftover au jus will be a GREAT base for French onion soup! Thanks lownwolf!

This recipe is a hit in my house - hubby & kids just love it.  Be sure to use the darkest, most syrupy beer you can find (e.g., Guinness) - it really makes a difference in the richness and overall flavor of the au jus.  Yummy!!!

Made this yesterday for a VERY tasty supper!  I Don't own a slow cooker so I used one of my corning ware casserole dishes and put the roast in the oven for 8 hours at 250 degrees. It worked marvelously! Instead of beer I used red wine. (Ancient Coast's Baco Noir, for any of you Canadian reviewers who are looking for an excellent red!) I also added a tbsp of worcestershire, some onion and garlic powder and some thyme. We used hot buttered and oven toasted baguette for the sandwhiches, and broiled some sliced mozarella on top. A true taste sensation, and although frenh dip is not truly authentic french fare, my French Canadian husband gave this 10 stars! Bon Appetit!

I added 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 Tablespoon worshesire. 7 hours is perfect for a 4 pound rump roast. Cut meat as thin as possible. Makes plenty of "a jus".
My first crock-pot recipe and it is awesome. I highly recommend. Even better the next day

This was bland. And the meat took on the weirdest texture. What could I possibly have done wrong?

For restaurant quality, make the following changes:
Use 1 pkg Dry lipton soup mix and an additional can of beef broth/consume instead of the canned onion soup for a stronger flavor.  Butter your rolls after you split them, sprinkle with garlic, add shredded beef, top with provolone cheese and broil until cheese is bubbly.  If you really want to improve this recipe add some sauteed onions and mushrooms.  I always do!

I couldn't read all 300 reviews (so forgive me if this has already been pointed out), but I thought I would add that instead of the beer, you can substitute a can of cola, just not diet.  This is a very easy and timesaving recipe.  It's also good served as is with vegetables as a main course.

Depending on what is in the freezer, I vary between a sirloin tip as it easily slices easier than other cuts, and a chuck roast which imparts more flavor.  I season my roast the evening before with a mix of garlic and onion powder, fresh ground black pepper and kosher salt letting it absorb the flavors.  Add to the crockpot in the morning, along with the other ingredients and darkest syrup beer you can find and you're in business! As other reviewers have noted, slicing the beef and adding back to the crockpot WITH the juices allows it to absorb more flavor. You just can't go wrong with this recipe!  Superb!

HELP recipe reviers!!  I have made this twice and both times it comes out so dry I could make shoes with it.  I like the broth and we've put melted cheese and grilled onions on it, but the meat is still dry.  I really want to like this recipe but I think I am doing something wrong with the cut of meat.  Can't always find rump roast, so what would you use?  The butcher at the store the other day said "bottom round roast" was the same as rump roast, but it tasted awful.  What cut of meat are people using where they are getting such good results??  Thanks!

This was so easy to get together and was really tasty.  I made it exactly as the recipe states but added a little garlic and a few shakes of worcestire sauce to the sauce. I also used a sirloin tip roast because it was on sale, but, it worked perfectly.    The sandwich was good, but, the leftovers were amazing!   I saved the leftover dipping sauce along with the beef.  I didn't have much fat from the roast because it was very lean, so, I melted 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan then whisked in 3 big tablespoons of flour and cooked it for a few minutes.  I then added a little bit of the dipping sauce from the roast and whisked it into the flour to get rid of any lumps.  I gradually added the rest of the dipping sauce into the pan whisking continually.  Bring the gravy to a boil and then down to a simmer. Depending on how much of the dipping sauce you used with the sandwiches you may need to add a little beef broth if the gravy is too thick.   We didn't use much of the sauce the first night so had plenty left over.    I sliced the leftover beef in slices and put into the gravy for about 7 minutes to warm up.  I served with whipped garlic mashed potatoes and baby peas.  The meat was unbelievably tender in the gravy and my husband said if you could bottle the gravy you would be a millionaire! Definitely try your leftover beef using the sauce as a gravy.  Yummy!

This was so delicious!  I did not use the beer, and used some extra Knorr french onion soup mix, as well as a boullion cube with about 12 oz. of water to make up the missing liquid.  I also added a few shakes of worchester sauce and some garlic powder as some other reviews had suggested.  I sliced the beef as thinly as I could with a regular knife and returned to the crock pot for the last hour, and the beef was so tender and juicy.  The cut of meat I used was a sirloin roast.  It was so easy and so good, that I will make this again and again for my family.

Oh my God this is a great recipe!!!  The only thing I did differently was add a little more salt.  I used a 12 oz. bottle of MGD and Campbells brand beef broth and french onion soup - they are condensed so they have more flavor.  Cooked it for 7 hours per the recipe, sliced it (if it falls apart when slicing, turn it and slice it the other way) and put it back in the crock pot for another 30 mins or so.   Buttering the rolls and putting them in the oven REALLY helped to make this taste great as well. This is one of the best recipes I've had from this site!

This is a good recipe with the Guinness and next time I will try it with some red wine instead.  I used ½ can of Guinness and could detect the flavor in the sauce at the end but it was good with the meat.  My DH just didn’t dip in it very much so next time the wine.  I slivered garlic and poked it in the meat in several places and covered the meat with Roast Seasoning; then topped with some dry oregano, chopped fresh rosemary and a few splashes of Worcestershire.  
For the sauce I used a can of Campbell’s Consommé, a can of Campbell’s Onion Soup, and some Swanson’s Chicken Broth and ½ of a 15 oz can of Guinness (St. James Draught).  To the soup I added: 2 sprigs Thyme, 1 sprig Rosemary, Bay Leaf, pinch dry oregano, pinch of sugar, ½ onion, sliced, garlic cloves, roughly cut,  a small cut-up carrot, and 3 sun dried tomatoes.  
I also agree that slicing the meat ahead of time and then returning it to the pot for about an hour is a big help!  I will definitely do this one again with some red wine.  THANKS TO YOU ALL FOR HELPING THE REST OF US READERS MAKE OUR DINNERS BETTER WITH YOUR ADVICE!

WOW! This was incredible! I don't purchase beer, so we used worchestire, beef boullion cubes, onion soup mix, garlic salt, and onion powder like suggested. I was nervous about it-I didn't know how it would turn out and I was serving it to guests. But it turned out perfect! I also cut the meat an hour before and let it soak in the juice for the last hour. I served it with French Bread Rolls to Die For (also on this site), and it was a HUGE hit! My family even requested it again tonite! Thanks for the recipe and everyone who gave tips in their reviews! This is my favorite recipe from this site!

This was wonderful and I know I will be making it again.  The sauce for dipping is perfect with just a hint of the beer that isn't overpowering.  The only thing I will change next time is to add onions.

5 stars for this! I added a few Tablespoons of worchestershire and some garlic salt because I felt the end product lacked a little flavor and with these changes it was perfect! Served it up on some dutch crunch rolls with mayo and provolone cheese! Delicious dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

I make this on a semi-regular basis, but with a few alterations that make a very tasty French Dip. I use 1 cup soy sauce, 1 can of Campbells Beef Consumme' soup, 1 packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix and 6 cups of water. I also add 5 garlic cloves, 1 bay leaf and a sprig of fresh rosemary. So yummy!

I have made this several times, and with a few changes it is a great recipe.  I used chuck roast, which is seared first with a coating of garlic salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I used 2 packages of Knorr french onion soup mix, 2 cans of beef broth, and one 12 oz can of light beer (we like lots of au jus).  I cook it for about 7-8 hours, then shred the beef, and put it back for another hour or two.  I toast the bread under the broiler, and add provolone cheese to the sandwich.  Simply perfect!  Thanks!

I forgot the beer, but it didn't matter -- this is still a terrific recipe!  I did season up the meat before putting it in the crockpot, using a little Montreal Steak seasoning, onion and garlic powders.  I also added a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet.  If you can make this the day before you want to serve it, you can remove the meat, slice it, and separate it from the sauce.  Chilling the sauce will allow you to remove the fat, which I thought made it much better.  It was a little greasy for me the first night, although my boys didn't seem to mind!  Buttering and toasting some nice hard steak rolls and then melting the cheese on them before loading them up with the meat is non-negotiable!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

We loved this recipe.  I took some tips from other users and used a chuck roast.  I put the roast, beer, dried onion, worcestire, garlic salt, garlic powder,pepper, beef stock, au jus gravy pack, and french onion soup into the crock and let it cook on low for eight hours, basting once in awhile.  I sliced up the meat and returned to the juice for additional hour.  I buttered the rolls, added some shredded cheese and put the under the broiler for about 7 minutes.  The meet was so tender and the dipping sauce was excellent.  I will  definitely make this again! So easy, the crock does all the work!

Most likely would have been 5 stars, but most likely operator error!  Used rump roast less than 4 pounds, but it only needed the crock for about 4 hours on low setting.  It was a little dry, but....I made the mistake of cutting it down.  Don't do that!  I think that made it a bit dry.  Inside of meat was incredibly tender.  Recipe as is, plus added the McCormick au jus seasoning.  Big crusty french rolls, meat sliced very thin, provolone cheese (you have to!), and au jus.  I made this along with the Bodacious Broccoli Salad (from this website) last night for a light dinner.  Boyfriend loved it.  French Dip leftovers today for lunch and he asked me to make more of the broccoli salad (a guy that likes broccoli?).  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll definitely make again.

Came out very good!! ___________ I used 1 can beef broth, 1 can consomme, 1 can french onion, 1 can budweiser, 1 packet onion soup mix.  The aus jus was very tasty, but I felt like the meat could have been more seasoned, next time I'll rub the meat in garlic or something. I had it cooking for a long time so the meat was too tender to slice, so I just piled it on bread from panera with provel cheese. Thank you for this recipe!

This one's my "go-to" recipe. Due to allergies, I use 22 ozs beef broth (using beef base and water). The only changes I make are to remove the inner bread from the rolls, then bake to get them toasty. I put the shredded meat on the toasted buns, then add a slice of provolone cheese, and bake another few minutes until cheese is melted and bread is golden. I put the broth mixture in individual ramekins for dipping. Delish! If there are any leftovers, I use the meat to make beef pot pies; just thicken the gravy, add either frozen mixed veggies or diced veggies of your choice, and pour into a premade pie crust. Add second pie crust on top, trim any extra crust, cut 6-8 slits for steam to escape, brush with 1 egg white, and bake at 350 for 25-30 mins until golden brown. I've also made the pot pies and frozen before baking to have in the freezer.

This was the first time I ever attempted to make a french dip and let me tell you this recipe is the bomb.  I didn't even add the beer just a can of beef broth and the french onion soup.  I did season my meat with garlic and pepper. I let it cook on low overnight and then in the morning I put in the frig.  That afternoon, I cut the meat into thin slices and put it back into it's juice.  When dinner rolled around, I just heated it up in the crock pot.  It was so juicy and tender.  I served my sandwiches with horseradish sauce from this site and melted a white cheese on top with onions and peppers.  I will be making this again for sure!!!

I have made this several times and it is great!  It is a perfect recipe to make if you are having company.  Just have your bread ready.  We like ciabatta rolls. I butter and then sprinkle with garlic powder, toast in the oven for 5-6 minutes then add the meat and the provalone on the bun , pop back in the oven for 3 minutes and serve with the dip!  Oh... if you have an electric knife it makes cutting the meat easier to slice thin.  USE A DARK BEER!  Yummy!

Sorry, but this one was just bad. The meat was tough and bland. The au jus turned out okay after I added tons of garlic, onion powder, onions, and worchester sauce. After 7 hours, I pulled out the meat, cut it up, and added it back to the slow cooker for an hour to make it juicier but it still was not great. I would not make this again.

I'm not sure if this could be any easier.  I have been so buisy getting ready for Christmas & really haven't had much time to cook.  Throw ingredients together, turn it on & walk away.  I didn't have any french onion soup on hand, so I sliced an onion & added that, I also added 1/2 packet of Italian salad dressing mix (it was sitting on the counter getting on my nerves).  Delish!!  Eat some sandwiches & drink some beers - Happy Holidays!!  Thanks Robyn!

YUM!  I made this as stated except I followed others tips:  1)  Sliced the meat up after about 6 1/2 hours and put it back in the Jus for another hour.  2)  Toasted the rolls, then loaded them up, and put some provolone cheese on top & then broiled till melted. 3)  Sit back and enjoy the praise...  Everyone loved these and I will be making them again!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

These sandwiches could give the pub a run for their money! My hubby isn't a big beef eater but came back for seconds and leftovers the next day. You must toast the buns and add provolone cheese to truly experience the awesomeness of the sandwich!

Just added a bit of garlic to the original recipe.  Added Provolone to the rolls.  Oh so yummy.  Hubby enjoyed it - and he's not a big fan of beef.  Will definately make this one again.

FANTASTIC!  I made this for Christmas. Needless to say it was a hit. I used a Sirloin Tip Roast, Guinness Beer, Beef Consommé and French Onion Soup. Like many suggested I rubbed minced Garlic on roast and added a few shakes of Worchester Sauce. I bought a 6 lb roast cooked it all night 10 hours on Low. In the morning took it out cooled in fridge for several hours then sliced it very thin. I added it back to crock pot for 4 hours on high and served with hard rolls. I gave everyone choice of cheeses. I had provolone, mozzarella, and cheddar which I melted on roll. This is defiantly a keeper.  I suppose this will be a requested for every Christmas and will make throughout the year.

I thought the dip was a bit bland as if it was missing something. I followed recipe exactly. The meat was delicious though. Very tender. I think the dip needs a lil spicing up.
Very important to trim as much fat off meat as possible or you will end up with a greasy tasting dip.

OMG, this came out perfect!  It was so delicious, we're sad we only used a 2.5 pound roast, we want more leftovers!  I melted some provelone cheese on the bread when I was toasting it, and it was just perfect.  Thanks for a great new weeknight staple.

This recipe always amazes me everytime I make it!  I make modifications to mine, however.  1 can of condensed Onion Soup, 1 can of beef broth, 1 beer and 1 packet of McCormick "au jous" packet makes a WONDERFUL sauce, even better than if you just keep it to what the recipe says.  Try it, it'll add that extra flavor to the dip!

This is awesome and so easy!  I followed other reviewers and added the browning sauce (2 tsp) and about 2 tsp of garlic.  I did not have 7-8 hours but I also only cooked 2lbs of meat so I put it on high and let it cook for 4 hours.  Then I pulled it out, cut it and put it back in with 2 tsp of lite salt.  I let it cook another 45-55 minutes while I toasted the rolls and melted the provolone.  My family loved this recipe!  Thanks so much!

My Grandmother used to make the BEST french dips on BAGELS & with SWISS CHEESE, but since she's passed on I don't know what her exact recipe was.  I definitely added her unique touches to this recipe & lovely tips from you guys when I made this & it turned out SUPERB!   I used a 2 lb CHUCK ROAST (next time I will use 4lb (which is about $16) because 2lbs didn't offer that much leftovers), fresh PLAIN BAGELS (get the ones in your bakery), SWISS CHEESE, 1 can beef broth, 1 can beef consume (instead of french onion soup), 1 Lipton Onion Soup Mix, Guiness Extra Stout Beer, 2 whole cloves GARLIC, Garlic Salt, dash of Worcestershire.   I salt & peppered the roast & SEARED it on high heat in a saute pan in a little oil for a couple minutes. Then I added it to everything (cooked on HIGH for 4.5 HOURS & 30 minutes before it's done, took out, cut  the meat & put back it with the juices to absorb the flavor). Buttered the bagels then popped them in the BROILER for 2 MINUTES, take out & put swiss cheese on top (melts perfectly) & flake the tender meat on the bottom portion (if you are taking the meat directly out of the juice skip this part, but if your meat is already separated from the juice: dip the inside of the bottom in the juices to moisten the bread a bit). O MY! Now that was a very good dinner; I'm sure I made my g-ma proud :)

Fantastic!!! I used a sirloin tip roast and cooked on high for 3 hours because I was very late getting this into the slow cooker. I then sliced the meat and returned it to the slow cooker on low for about 45 minutes. Added a little garlic and black pepper for extra flavor. Awesome recipe and it couldn't be easier to throw together. We will definitely be having this again. Thank you! :)

I am very finicky when it comes to French Dip, and this was by far the BEST french dip I have ever had!!!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and I used Beef Consomme instead of the broth, added a few dashes of pepper, garlic powder and steak sauce, and only used half a can of dark beer.  Also, instead of rump roast I used Top Round Steak because it's cheaper, more tender, and it's the kind my favorite restaurant uses.  I cooked it in the crock pot for 7 hours, then removed the meat, sliced it thinly, and placed it back in the crock pot with the sauce for another hour.  The au jus sauce came out flavorful (and you'd never guess there was beer in it), and the meat was tender and juicy.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  I'm definately making it again!

This was great. I took bits & pieces of others' advice & ended up rubbing Worcestershire sauce & garlic powder on a chuck roast, then searing it before putting in slow cooker. Then I used: 1 can cambell's beef consomme, 1 packet lipton onion soup, 2 cups water, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 12 oz. Guinness beer (I really think a high-quality dark beer is best. You don't taste the beer at all, but even if you did, it would be the good stuff!). I used an electric knife to slice the meat. Then I strained the liquids to get a clear broth, returned broth & meat to the cooker for one more hour, then strained & skimmed the fat on the broth again before serving as an au jus. It was fabulous & well worth the effort! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I especially loved how easy it was to make and the wonderful smells my kitchen held all day long!  I don't purchase beer, so I substituted about 1/2 cup apple cider.
This one will be used again many times!

I was fooled at 1st. I read the reviews, n decided to try this with some modification. I used 1 can Prgresso onion soup, a carton of beef broth, 12 oz. of Foster beer, a tblsp. of italian seasoning, a half of envelope of onion soup, and a 3 lb. sirloin roast, which I seasoned with granulated garlic, before putting it in the SC. After cooking it on low for 7 hours, I tasted it by cutting a small piece of meat, and was still able to taste the strong beer flavor, and the meat was very tough. I thought to myself "I can't believe I wasted a good sirlion roast on this recipe, I'm gonna leave a 1 star and tell everyone how horrible this recipe is, and what are ppl thinking? Don't they have any taste buds?" Since nobody in my family was home yet, I sliced up the meat with an electric knife (because it was so tough). and threw it back in the SC on the warm setting. Later that night, my teenage son came home, and took a couple of pieces out of the SC, and told me that it was real good. So my curiosity got the best of me, and I tried a piece, and it was so tender, it practically melted in my mouth. So I took all the sliced meat, and the liquid and put it into a container in the refrig. The next day, I toasted some Kaiser rolls with butter and granulated garlic, and added the meat which I nuked w/the juices, just to warm it,  some sauted mushrooms and onion, with Mozz. and put it under the broiler. That's where the WOW factor came in. This sandwich litterally melted in my mouth!! OMG!!!

Made this per request from my son for New Year's Eve.  Followed the direction's exactly but cooked about 9 hours. I did slice it up a bit when there was about a hour left of cooking.  The meat was nice and tender, lots of juice but the flavor wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked it.  I think I would season it up with some montreal steak seasoning or something next time.  It was super easy and very good though.  Thank you!

Okay I'm not even kidding, this is the best food I have eaten in I don't know how long. My 14 year old picky eater, who doesn't like his foods even touching, DEVOURED it!!!!! We used long french baguettes and toasted them with fresh garlic butter first, cooked the roast from FROZEN on high for 4 hours, came out brilliantly. I want to marry this recipe. YAY!!!!

This is a good base recipe, but I found it to be a little bland overall.  It definitely could use more seasoning and perhaps a variation on the liquids added.  I'd definitely try it again (super easy recipe), but I'd modify it a bit more.

Wow this is good!! I read SO many reviews to make sure that I did this the right way for best flavor. Here's what I did: Used a chuck roast because it was BOGO at grocery store and used a rub of minced garlic, worcestershire garlic and onion powder and pepper on both sides before adding other ingrediants. I also chopped and added an onion with the intention of making french onion soup with the leftovers as other reviewers suggested. I used Icehouse beer because it's what I had on hand. After it cooked on low four hours, I tasted the juice and it seemed a bit bland so I added garlic salt and that did the trick! My husband could not get enough of this and we ate french dip two nights in a row and then I made soup with the leftovers!! Try it, you won't be disappointed. It is a very easy meal to fix and forget :o)

YUM! My husband would give this **10 STARS** if he could, and he's extremely picky picky picky!! The slow cooker is of course the key to this recipe since it makes the meat so unbelievable tender and the flavors become so infused with the meat. And this recipe is SO EASY!! I follow the instructions exactly and then tweak it at the end to copy how our favorite restaurant makes their french dips: slice SOURDOUGH rolls in half (sourdough has more punch in flavor that regular french ones) and place in oven w/out butter so the inside faces get slightly crispy; remove from oven; dip crispy side in french dip juices, place sliced cheese on bread (provolone, swiss, or mozarella all work well), layer with sliced meat, place other half of bread on top and place whole sandwich back in oven until cheese is melted (be careful not to burn the bread tho). Then serve with sauce on the side for dipping. Yum Yum! A winner every time! And just so ridiculously easy!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.... Oh my goodness was this good!!!! This has got to be the best beef dish I have ever made!! I did take some advice and tweak it just a bit, I used some red wine and worcestire sauce (I didn't have beer) I also added some garlic and onion powder, salt & pepper. My husband said this is 5+ stars!! I couldn't agree more... thank you Robyn for a terrific tasty & easy recipe!!!!!!!

This was absolutely amazing. The only thing I changed was the soup. I used one envelope of Lipton's French Onion soup instead of the canned soup.

So easy and incredibly good!  I've used several different roasts for this recipe and they have all turned out well - if necessary, after 7 hours you can slice the roast and put back in the broth until ready to serve.  This also helps the meat become even more tender!  Thank you!!

This was very good!  I read alot of review and took some suggestions to heart. I substituted about 1/3 cup of water for 1/3 cup of the beer, because some said that you could taste the beer.  I couldn't taste it at all.  I also added T worcestershire & 1/2 tsp. onion and garlic powder.  And you definitely want to slice the meat thin and put back in crockpot with the juice for an hour as mentioned in previous reviews.  I feel that made a big difference in the tenderness.  Even my VERY picky 7 year old had some.  Will definitely make again and pass onto to friends.

My family loved this recipe....told me to keep this one.  I used low sodium beef broth, and I thought it needed salt. We added cheese to the sandwiches, wrapped them in foil and put them back into the oven for a very short time.  They were very tasty!

I've made this recipe several times, substituting a package of au jus seasoning for the beef broth. So good. My mouth is watering just looking at the recipe. The long cook time is great because your house will smell blissful the entire time. You really wanna try this recipe.

Your roast (whether in the oven or the slow cooker) will turn out MUCH better (more tender, beefier flavor) if you use a chuck eye roast (rump and sirloin roasts- Yech!)

I made it exactly as stated though I did rub it with garlic salt and pepper before putting it in.  About two hours before dinner I tasted it and it WAS rather bland like some of the reviews had stated so I threw in some worcestershire and a little oregano, basil, and garlic salt.  I think it would have been better with maybe half the amount of beer because it made it a little bitter or something.  My husband thought so too.  You could definitely taste the beer in it, so if you don't like it, maybe half the beer. The meat was very tender but will probably try another recipe before I make this again.

There is not much that you can say about this recipe.  Like other reviewers suggest trim the fat, less grease.  But other than that...this is a great no thinking, no working recipe.  You really don't have to do amything. Amazing taste. Thank you.

I have made this twice and it is delicious.  I did think it needed just a little more flavor for dipping, so the second time I made it I added a packet of au jus mix -- just the ticket -- it was wonderful.

The taste was really good, but the meat was a little dry and stringy.  I alleviated this by slicing it, and then putting the slices back into the juice for a little while.  Overall, pretty good.

I tried this recipe last night and it was Amazing!  I took advice of others and used dark beer, rub the meat with garlic salt, sliced a whole onion, teaspoon of soy sauce, mushrooms, I used french onion soup, beef broth, worcestershire sauce a can of beef consomme. Cooked for 7 hours sliced as thin as possible then put back in crock pot for about 45 minutes and it will be a weekly dinner in my house.  SO EASY and better than any restaurant french dip I have ever tried EVER! Melted swiss cheese and put on sub rolls. ......YUMMY.

I thought this recipe was okay. If I didn't take suggestions from other members on seasoning the steak beforehand it would've been tasteless. I seasoned a top sirloin roast with salt (plenty of it), fresh ground black pepper, garlic and thyme. I used a Scottish Ale but could have used a Guiness instead. I should have left the strings on the meat while it was cooking because when it was done it shredded to bits, which I could work with but I was looking forward to the "shaved" style more. I also added Worcestershire sauce to it. Without those add ons, it would have been 1 star. Sorry! Hope this helped some of you!

I followed this recipe exactly as written aside from adding some fresh sliced onion and garlic to the crock pot. I sliced the beef ~30 minutes before serving and put it back in the crock pot. I sliced french bread instead of rolls, and I put sharp provolone and mozzarella on it before putting the bread under the broiler. Served with caramelized onions on top this was a huge hit. My girlfriend (who is not big on any kind of beef) loved this meal, and wanted to have the leftovers for dinner the next night! I will definitely be making this again, thank you!

SUPER good, with a few changes. I read a lot of the reviews, so this is what I did, and I don't think I would change a thing. I used a 4 lb chuck roast, rubbed 1/2 tsp each garlic salt and onion salt on it then seared it before placing it in crockpot. Then I mixed together 2 cans beef consume, (Campbell's) one pkg Lipton Onion soup mix, one bottle Guinness Stout, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire, and 1/2 tsp garlic salt then poured over roast and cooked on low 7 hours. Shred the meat, place back in the au jus, and then I added one pack of Swanson's beef Flavor Boost. Let warm in au jus for 1/2-1 hour more. I buttered some french rolls, placed under broiler, then piled on the roast beef and provolone cheese, and place back under broiler until melted. I also served it with a little Horseradish sauce on the side. (spread a tiny bit on one half of the toasted rolls) Really, really good. The meat is good by itself too, and the broth would make a really good base for French Onion soup.  Will make again.  And again.

This was a very good way to use up a rump roast I had in the freezer.  The beef had very good flavor.  I melted mozarella cheese on the sandwiches under the broiler.  Very good!

Really good with some changes: I used 15oz beef broth and added...1/4c. soy sauce, 1/8c. worcestershire, and some garlic powder, pepper, and salt. Served them up on some French rolls. I buttered one side and sprinkled with garlic salt, added a slice of provolone to the other side and popped them under the broiler until well toasted. I also used a chuck roast (much cheaper). The key is to make sure the meat soaks in the juices for at least an hour after slicing to help tenderize!

this recipe was exceptional & flavorful, in fact, I'm disappointed that I only tasted 2 slices of beef because it went that fast! There were no leftovers, not even a drop of au jus.  
The beer I used: Black Toad from Trader Joes.
I included the following to recipe: sliced whole onion, sliced large bell pepper, kielbasa smoked sausage cut into 4 inch pieces (put these on the very top), fresh ground pepper.  While this was cooking, I baked "French Baguettes By Judy Taubert".  They were perfect for this french dip.

This was a HUGE hit at our house. I used the sirloin tip and a Guiness beer. I also added a bit of garlic and worcestershire sauce.  I topped it with Provelone cheese then popped it under the broiler for a few minutes. YUM!  I think I might add a sliced onion next time to see how that works.

This was so yummy, but I have to admit that I didn’t follow the recipe exactly – I just didn’t have some of the ingredients on hand. Nonetheless, I used this recipe as a base to follow so I had to share how wonderful it was. I used a boneless bottom round roast, 2 packs of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, 2 cans of beef broth and 1 cup of water. I cooked this the day before for 8 hours and refrigerated it over night. The next day about an hour and a half before I was going to serve it, I sliced the cold roast into thin slices (a cold roast is much easier to slice thin than a hot one), placed it back into the slow cooker with all the juice and warmed it on high. I buttered several buns and toasted them under the broiler. Then topped the buns with the meat, provolone cheese, sautéed mushrooms (cooked fresh, sliced button mushrooms in a bit a butter, oil, garlic, oregano, salt over med/low heat for 30-40mins) , caramelized onions and put them back under the broiler. My whole family loved these sandwiches. I plan on serving this next month for my bunco ladies!

This has easily become a Family Favorite! I use dry onion soup packet instead of French onion soup and usually a chuck roast.  It's a never-fail pleaser.  The aroma while cooking is killer good!! I made this again last night and had only 1/2 bottle of VERY FLAT beer since I add  beer to dishes I cook that call for beer, by only a few ounces at a time (we're emptynesters).  Worked great.  The flavor was definitely there.  I also add a splash of good soy sauce for a fantastic flavor addition.  Our favorite hot sandwich!

I'm not quite sure how to rate this as I wasn't sure how exactly a "french dip" should taste. I followed the recipe as is (and used a dark beer) and added some salt/pepper/garlic & onion salt/worcestshire sauce on the meat.  It tasted like a regular roast but it did make a great sandwhich.  My sauce was not dark at all and was a little oily from the meat (I used a chuck roast).  Either way it was a pretty simple and darn good meal to make and will definitely get made again.

I used a 3.5 lb rump roast, 1 can beef broth, 1 can french onion soup, 1 bottle of Guinness, 1 large vidalia onion, 2 pints of sliced mushrooms, 4 Whole garlic cloves and seasoned the beef with seasoned salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. I let this cook in the crock on low for 5 hours. Took the beef out, slice it thin, and placed the meat back in the juice. I buttered hoagie rolls and toasted with provolone cheese until melted and golden brown. Added the meat, onions and mushrooms and dipped in the sauce! I have never made this sandwich before and it was absolutely delicious. The meat so flavorful and tender , the juice was delicious. I served this with sweet restaurant style coleslaw from this site. My family raved about this meal. Thank you for the fabulous recipe! It sure is deserving of more stars if that were possible!! Enjoy!

Very good recipe.  Good flavor and easy to prepare.  Made it exactly as written, using Sam Adams Octoberfest beer.  Served it with the dipping juices as well as horseradish sauce (recipe found on AR).
With leftover juice, I added flour, milk and spices, and turned it into a gravy that we put over mashed potatoes.

This is really great but what i do that makes it even greater is instead of putting butter on the rolls, i take a cup of FF mayo add 2 tsp of minsed garlic and mix then spread liberallly on the rolls, top with the beef and also some sauted onions/bell peppers, provolone cheese and oregano and put under the broiler for a few minutes!!  DELISH!!!  With a side of the Aujus it is sooooo good!! :)

The recipe was a little salty. That may have a been my fault. I would use less salt and add later to taste. These turned out great though and I even forgot to add the water and it still was fantastic.

I use Fat Tire beer from New Belgium Brewing, and add soy sauce, garlic cloves and worcestershire sauce.  My husband and I hosted game night and made this for 10 of our friends...  They now beg weekly for new batches!  It gave me a huge boost of confidence, as I'm primarily a ramen and frozen pizza girl. ;)

My Husband said after the first couple of bites, " It tastes the same if not better than what you would get in a restaurant”!  I used 2 Campbell’s Consommé and a can of Campbell’s French Onion Soup, which I did NOT add, water to.   After I had everything in the crock-pot I placed the Chuck Roast beef in and I added Garlic powder over the top of the meat.  Once it was done I took the meat out and shredded in a separate bowl.  I melted provolone cheese on the sourdough bread rolls put the meat in it and dipped it in the au jus and it literally melted in my mouth it was SO GOOD. Take it from me I work in a restaurant that is known to have the best roast beef dip in town and I thought this was just a tasty! A little hint common hint I thought I would just throw out there is after I finished dinner I put the au jus in a separate container and place it in the fridge. Naturally all the fat went to the top and formed a solid mass that I could grab and toss. Again its common knowledge I just wanted to put it out there. :)

Excellent.  I used Bass beer and seasoned the meat a little beforehand with sea salt, pepper, and garlic.  Delicious and very easy.  I also recommend making the sandwich open-face and adding some cheese and then heating the whole thing up in the oven.

The recipe is very good; I've made it several times.  Slice the beef about a half hour or so before serving and put it back in the cooker to let it soak up the juices.  Also, you'll need to add salt to the au jus.

Yep, yep, yep.  I started with a pretty expensive cut of beef.  We like our meats browned so I used the BBQ outside to give it a nice color.  It really added to the flavor.  I used an expensive dark beer that my husband has on hand and the beer flavor was only a bit too strong for me. I don't like beer at all as a beverage.  I'm definately going to make this again and do everything like before but just add a lighter flavored beer.  It's great to have so much AuJu when the meat is done cooking.

This was a super easy way to make french dip, but we thought the au jus was a little bland.  Next time I will add a packet of the Knorr au jus.

WOWSA! Seriously easy to make (throw it all in at once in the morning and walk away), and it was absolutely delicious. I loved how the meat fell apart by the end of the cooking time. So simple and delicious for these rare occasions when I cook beef!

this was okay, would give it 3.5 if I could, very easy, which I like.  Did not add the beef broth b/c I thought that would be way too much sodium since there was already the onion soup in there. Was still good, but some other french dips are better so it did not get four or five from me. Would still make it again b/c it uses ingredients I had on hand and everyone ate it. served on rolls with swiss or provolone cheese melted on it.

I made this dish for a weekend, mid-afternoon lunch with about 4 people - they loved it!! Just used beef bouillon granules and dehydrated mushrooms. One of my guests provided the french bread - homemade! Added a potato salad and green beans - makes a great meal. Used the leftover beef & au jus in a quick beef stroganoff.

THIS RECIPE IS SO DELICIOUS! We like others smothered it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Liptons Onion dry soup, but we added McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning too. Then added the Campbells French Onion soup and Fosters Beer. Cooked on low 6 hours, took it out and shredded it and put it back in for 1 hour. Then put it on  french roll with melted cheese or make into tacos. SO GOOD AND EASY!!!

I'm from LA where the French Dip originated at Phillipe's.  They always use carrots, celery & onions as they cook the meat & to flavor the au jus.  So I placed two carrots (cut in 1/2 crosswise), 2 celery stalks & a bay leaf. (I didn't serve these, just for flavoring.) I didn't have condensed French onion soup, so I used a packet of dry.  I figured there was enough onion from that.  I also took other raters' advice & used only 1/2 the beer.  It was OUTSTANDING!  My father in law said it was as good as Phillipe's! and the only complaint was how little leftovers there were for lunch the next day!  THANK YOU!

I usually ALWAYS read the reviews before I make something because people have figured out how to make it a 5 star recipe. However, this time I didn't...and I regreted it. The meat was so blah! It shredded when I tried to cut it. After reading the reviews it looks like the ones that did give it 5 stars added a lot more seasoning. I will definitely add what others suggested next time to give it some flavor. Pretty disapointed.

Dinner was being cooked while everything else was done away from home. It was great even without the beer! I added the can of condensed mushroom soup but since I had no onion soup I just added some water, salt and a quartered onion. I also added a  TBSP of Lea and Perrins and a dollop of roasted minced garlic. The meat was tender and still soupy by the end of the day (about 8 hrs) so I emptied the crockpot into a regular pot and simmered off the excess liquid while I baked the bread (not yeast bread!). It was served as a sandwich with coleslaw (leftover coleslaw) as the "lettuce" and provolone cheese. Some of us ended up with more than one serving but since the breads were small and airy and we did not always include cheese, I think it was still a balanced meal. Thanks for all the reviews and the great recipe.

Very good.  I used Chuck Roast.  I accidentally put in chicken broth and thought I had ruined it.  Followed it up with a Ziegenbock (dark Texas) beer and beef stock...and it turned out wonderfully.  Next time I will be sure to omit the chicken broth...lol

The meat was great, but the dipping sauce was bland. I took the advice of another rater here and added some onion soup mix and a splash of soy sauce. Much better that way.

This is a family favorite! I have tried a few different kinds of beer and porter is definitely best. I also double the beef broth and use a package of dry onion soup mix. Plus I throw in half an onion (diced) and 2 cloves minced garlic. I like it best when the beef is shredded rather than sliced. Yummy!

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. I browned the roast before putting in the slow cooker.  I then sauteed 1 large onion to add the the liquid mixture.  My suggestion is to use a better cut of beef.  I've made this quite a few times, and sometimes will serve the beef on hard rolls with melted provolone cheese.  Hard to beat!

I have made this several times without changes and it is wonderful!  Today I made it again but had forgotten to pick up the condensed French Onion soup.  Instead I threw in a packet of dry onion soup mix and it was just as good or maybe even better!

Made this last night and am just now sitting down to try it. Oh yum! Whoever said these sandwiches don't taste like other French Dips -- I disagree. On high quality hoagie buns, I'd say this as good as any french dip I've ordered in a restaurant. Better that most even.  I was worried about the meat shredding instead of slicing, but that's really not a big deal.  The beer was reduced, and I used a dark ale (1554). Used approx. 2 lb. chuck roast, 1 can of beef broth, 1/2 can of condensed french onion soup (in beef broth, the can states), and as suggested by reviews, 1+ tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce, a sprinkle of garlic powder and black pepper. I also went ahead and put in a tbsp. of McCormick au jus gravy powder mix, just to make sure the flavor was on the mark, though it might not have been necessary.  Cooked on low for 7 hours total. Added provolone cheese to the hoagies and broiled. Served with lightly salted organic potato chips. Oh so good!  These would be awesome (and easy!) to serve to guests.  The au jus is fabulous!

This was a good recipe and so easy. Used 6 pounds of chuck roast and cooked for 8 hours.  I added garlic to the crockpot for extra flavor.  As many reviewers suggested, after slicing the meat, I put it back in the juices and let it sit for 1/2 hour after turning the crockpot off.  Broiled provolone cheese on French Rolls; I think this is better than butter. Served roasted garlic potatoes, tossed salad and the "ratatouille" recipe on this site...perfect blend of flavors.

Made this last night for dinner, and I'm so glad that I did. Definitely make sure you cut the meat and then let it soak in the juice before serving. I added some black pepper, garlic and worcestershire sauce. These are really good with melted provolone. Can't wait to have them again.

I wish I could give this one more than 5 stars! I took the advice of others and used one can of french onion soup and one can of beef consomme. First time, I tried without the beer.  Was a little salty. The second time used a half can of beer, and really made the difference.  Told my friends and now it's become their favorite dinner recipe!

I'm sure the recipe was perfect as written…but I have to twiddle with things.  As other reviewers suggested I used beef consume and added a packet of onion soup mix plus 4 cups of water.  When I do french dips in the crock-pot I like the roast to be completely covered with liquid so it doesn’t dry out.  I also added some onions and mushrooms I had leftover from the day before.  This got the best complement I've ever received…my 16 year old stepson who is a very pick eater said this was the best food he'd ever tasted.  That's a lot coming from a teenager!  Thanks for sharing…I'm sure this will be in my monthly rotation.

I really like this. Just remember to be sure to trim ALL of the fat off the meat, as I forgot to do this step, and the next day, the entire thing was a big white soup (from all the fat).

Oh my gosh!  My ENTIRE family wents absolutely nuts over this!  It was gobbled up!  This has taken first place as my FAV recipe!

We added some sliced swiss while toasting the bread, but otherwise left the recipe alone!  Leftover broth makes for excellent vegetable beef soup starter!

PS--used Guinness beer and I think that made it even more excellent!  Try it with a dark beer.

Goooooood!  I thought I had onion soup in the pantry, but I didn't so I used a packet of onion soup mix and -following some of the other reviewers- a dash of worchestershire sauce, a little garlic salt, and some onion powder.  YUM!  We melted provolone on our rolls and dipped, dipped, dipped!!  We had french fries and coleslaw with it and it was a good, no fuss, easy dinner!  Thanks for the recipe, Robyn.

This was AWESOME and truly the best French Dip I have ever eaten.  Even my picky kids loved it!  I sliced the beef after two hours of cooking, which worked out well.  I buttered the rolls and toasted them on a griddle.  We topped our sandwiches with sauteed onions, green pepper and Provolone cheese.  Absolutely delish!

Wonderful recipe.  No changes made to the original recipe.  Don't forget to toast rolls which will prevent soggy sandwiches.  The key to a juicy beef is to slice and place in juices for an hour before serving.  I will use this recipe often.

Thanks

I can't say enough good things about these sandwiches. Everybody cleaned their plates. Do follow some of the suggestions and slice the meat part way through cooking so it doesn't fall apart. Serve on toasted buns and melt some provolone on top if you like. I served it with the Restaurant Style Cole Slaw from this site.

It was good, but for some reason, my beef doesn't come out as tender as other's seems to have.I have made this a couple of times. Also, th second time I made it I couldn't find condensed frnch onion soup, so I just used a can of Progresso french onion soup. Big mistake! The "condensed" soup makes it much more flavorful.

My family loves this recipe, and I love how easy it is to make. It tastes best if you use a dark beer.  The dip is pretty salty, so I always use a reduced salt beef broth.  I have also substituted cola for the beer, and it's very good that way as well. I add camelized onions on the sandwiches.

My family loves this.  I've been making this for better than a year and it is still highly requested.  I serve it without the bread with garlic parsley potatoes and green beans cooked in bacon grease.  I do suggest shredding or cutting the meat after it is cooked and then returning it to the pot for 20 minutes to let the juice set into the meat.  It is SOOO simple and yummy!!

This is without a doubt the best French dip ever.  We don't drink so instead of beer I used Pepsi.  I let the roast marinate overnight in just the Pepsi.  The next morning I mixed in the onion soup and as another reviewer suggested, Consomme soup.  When I got home from work I sliced the roast thinly with the electric knife and then but it back in the crock pot until we were ready to eat.  It was so moist and tender.  I diffently will be making this often.

Absolutely WONDERFUL melts in you mouth! And for anyone with a whole family of teetotalers like mine, who wouldn't hear of having beer in the au jus... It tastes just as good without! Just add 12 extra ounces of beef broth to make up the liquid volume.

This was a very easy recipe. I made a few changes based on what the other reviewers said like adding more seasoning, onion soup mix and omitting the beer. I only added a half packet of onion soup mix but will add the whole packet next time. Slicing the roast and letting it simmer in the juice for an hour or so is a must. Even when I reheated the leftovers I did the same and the meat was still tender and juicy. The two of us had 3 meals out of a 3 3/4 lb. rump roast. Give this recipe a try--I'm positive you'll make it a second time!

We LOVED this, we have a deepfreeze full of buffalo which we are finding tough and chewy but even it was great cooked this way. my kids (4 and 5) loved it too. we dumped the leftovers over pergoies and baked it for an hour, that meal was a hit too! thank you for the recipe.
p.s. I am an "Arby's" addict but live far from the city this was just as good!

Great recipe, and worth making often.  I like to sear my roast with Lawrys seasoning before putting it in  the crock pot, and it gives it a little more flavor!  Try doing that for an excellent roast/sandwich.

This was a wonderful recipe. Very simple. The beer
added a wonderful flavor. Instead of using this
recipe for sandwiches I served it as a regular
dinner menu with garlic mashed potatoes and green
bean. It was so tender it could be cut with a 
fork. My husband and I loved it.

I don't eat red meat, however, my hubby and kids loved this. The meat turns out very much like a pot roast and was very tender. I did taste the sauce and I thought it was wonderful. I added garlic and onion powder to the sauce and in lieu of the bouillon cubes I used two small cans of beef broth.

This was a great recipe.  I altered it a bit. Deleted the can of beer and added a pkg of au jus mix, and instead of using canned onion soup I used a pkg of powdered.  Added 2 cups of water.  It was so yummy!!!!

My husband LOVES this frech dip recipie.  That says a lot seeing how we don't eat much red meat.  We broiled the rolls, added the meat and then topped with swiss cheese on both halves.  Pop them back in the broiler (open faced) until cheese is melted.  Fabulous!  So easy I couldn't imagine it being so GOOD!

This recipie was awesome!  I used the left over au jus to make a french onion soup.  There were only two of us eating, so I only used a 2 lb roast, but next time I will use more so I can have more leftovers!  This is what I did to make the soup:  Slice one onion and cook over medium heat with 4 tablespoons butter.  Stir constantly until transluscent, you do not want the onions to brown.  Add au jus, 1 tablespoon dry sherry and 1/4 tsp. thyme.  Simmer for 30 min.  Place into oven safe bowls, slice french bread on top and cover generously with provolone cheese, do not alow the cheese to sink into the bowls. Put under broiler until cheese is slightly brown and bubbly. 
If you are serving for a large group, you may want to put in more beef broth in the crock pot.I will DEFINATELY be making this again!

Absolutely delicious sandwich! Like a few reviewers, I made a few minor changes to add a little more flavor to it.  The night before cooking, I seasoned the meat with onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and worcestershire sauce and set it in a ziploc bag overnight. In the broth I added some diced onion, mushrooms and green pepper.  Regarding the french bread, I used philly steak buns. I coated the inside with butter, and lightly seasoned it with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, parsley and thyme then toasted them under the broiler (like you would for garlic bread). Everything turned out great.  Next time I think I will try using a darker craft beer to see what that does to the flavor.

Soooo good! Followed suggestions from other reviewers and added some worshteshire  and garlic powder. Only had dry Lipton's onion soup mix on hand so I used 2 of those instead of condensed soup, 1 probably would have been sufficient. Still this French dip was excellent, tender and the dipping juice made it melt in your mouth good! Next time I'll use another pound or two of meat for my family of 4...there was hardly any leftover and only 3 of us ate dinner tonight.

I also took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 can of beef consumme & french onion soup, 1/2 c low sodium soy sauce, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, thyme and oregano. Used a chuck roast and cooked it for 4 hours on high, then low for an hour, then sliced the meat on the diagonal and put it back in the crock pot for another half hour. Sauteed some yellow onion and buttered some hoagie buns, then put meat, provolone and mozarella cheese on the buns and broiled at 500 degrees for 5 minutes. My boys loved this!!!!!

For fuller flavor - make it a two day project.  On Day 1, slow cook your meat and then refrigerate overnight.  On Day 2, make your rolls and reheat the meat.  The taste is off the chart.  My family and I liked them the first day; we loved them the second.  Take my advice and you'll see how great tasting these french dips can be.

This is a great recipe, very simple to make. I followed some of the other suggestions, substituting beef consommé for broth and adding a packet of onion soup mix, because I prefer my sauce to have a deeper onion flavor to it. I also season the roast with salt, pepper, and onion and garlic powder. (I'm a garlic fiend) it comes out wonderfully!

I added onion soup packet as suggested thank goodness i did, this really needs more salt=or something to make it more tender.  I think it tasted more like a "roast" on bread than french dip.

Followed tips from some of the reviews. This was awesome. Threw a bouillon cube in after slicing the beef and putting it back in.  Can't wait to try French onion soup tomorrow!

This was easy just as it says. I didn't like it though as it tasted like pot roast which I do not like. Not much flavor either. Sorry but this just didn't suit us. DH took the leftovers to work to give away as it wasn't bad, we just don't like pot roast.

I used a chuck roast as per others suggestions. It was very tender, moist and lean. I added more salt and added garlic and onion powder. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because it was still a little bland. Even though I added more seasonings it could have used more. I recommend this recipe just add more salt.

Seared the roast in a pan before I put it in the crock pot, also added about a tbsp of minced garlic.  Used 2 cans of Campbells beef consumme in place of the beef broth, to give it a little more flavor.  Also used the dry french onion soup mix instead of a can and added 1/2 cup water.  Delicious!!

Love this recipe.  It's going to be a new family favorite. Since it's only my husband and myself I only used two lbs of roast, but kept the rest of the measurements the same.  We both loved this!  I added provolone cheese to the French rolls during the last couple of minutes in the oven.  Will definitely make this again and again!

I used a 2 lb. london broil, 1 can beef broth, 1 bottle light beer and an enevelope of onion soup mix.   Also sauteed an onion and 4 garlic cloves and threw that in.  Spooned beef/onions onto rolls, spinkled with mozzarella cheese and melted under broiler.  served with butterd, salted corn on the cob.  rave reviews from old men AND picky ten-year olds.

This is an easy, delicious recipe.  If you want to make Italian Beef French Dip sandwichs use the recipe and cover the chuck roast with small amount of olive oil, on both sides, sprinkle with oregano. Clean & slice one green pepper, add to crock pot.  Add Greek pepperocini and very small amount of pepperocini juice (about 1/8 cup) into the slow cooker.  Can use more juice if you like it spicy.  Cook as recipe directed and serve on French Buns with beef juice for dipping.

When I went to make this I realized we didn't have any beer!  So I doubled up the beef broth and I also used a fresh cut onion in place of the condensed french onion soup (don't like all the junk added to the campbell's condensed soups).  Added some seasoning like garlic and onion powder and a splash of worcestershire.  The end result was fantastic!  However I would definitely like to try it with the beer next time and will be looking for a different brand of french onion to be more true to the recipe.  Toasted the rolls in the oven w/ provolone cheese and then added the beef. Edited: have made this several more times following instructions and it's great.

It was good. I wouldn't say GREAT, but it was a nice change. Definitely make sure you remove as much fat as possible, otherwise you will end up with a top layer of hard fat when it cools down.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. It tasted more like a pot roast than French Dip.  I made the following changes that another person suggested but I would NOT make this again:

I used: Campbell’s Consommé, a can of Campbell’s French Onion Soup, added garlic powder, onion powder, a touch of worcestershire

This was delicious as written, although as usual i tweaked it a little. I used guiness, which the husband was excited to drink the rest of the 4 pack. It definitely added a depth of flavor, don't skip it. I cooked about 3 lb rump roast with onions, carrots, celery, and garlic as well as the broth, beer, and worcestershire sauce. I seasoned roast well with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and roasted garlic sea salt grinder. Cooked overnight, about ten hours total on low. Shredded beef and returned to juices for about 30 min. I removed the carrot and celery chunks, they were super soggy, but served beef with onions. Served on french rolls with horseradish sauce and cheddar melted under the broiler. A little crispy onions on top and it was awesome! I took the extra juices and made french onion soup as another reviewer recommended, will see how it is for lunch tomorrow. Great easy recipe, will make again!

2397 reviews of this recipe and it has 4.5 stars.  I have NO idea how that is possible.  I made this for the first time today.  Put ingredients, as directed plus 2 minced garlic cloves, in the crock pot this morning.  I just got home, sliced the beef, tasted it and thought "OMG!  How can I save this dish?!" For the flavor, I might as well have cooked it in water...bland, bland, bland!!  I've added garlic salt, Worcestershire, Italian seasoning and a bay leaf.  I put the meat, sliced, back in the crock pot and I'm hoping for the best.  How disappointing!

The first words out of my boyfriend's mouth were "oh my god...This is so good!" Enough said! (I did add my own seasonings and suggestions that others had, montreal steak, worcestershire, etc.) I could see it being bland without the extra seasonings, so really I could have given this 4 stars instead of 5. I'm feeling generous!

My husband and son thought this was the best sandwich they've ever had.  I only had a large can of French Onion Soup so I used it and no beef broth.  The only beer we had was some Yuengling's my husband brought home from PA.  He wasn't crazy about me cooking with his beer, but he did love the results of the meat cooked in it!  Lonwolf32 - it is obvious why your recipe star rating is so high and why there are so many reviews - you have provided a delicious recipe.  Thank You!

Good sandwiches and very easy and quick to make.  I added two cloves minced garlic and two teaspoons of sugar and let it cook on low for six hours.  I used a london broil cut because it's cheaper, but it still tasted very good and cut easily.  I really like the flavor of the dipping sauce but think it would be even better thickened up a little.

This was pretty good. I used Miller Lite, because that's what I had (the husband is a fan), and I used that onion soup mix stuff, beef bouillon, and water. I was in too much of a hurry to leave for work to add anything else. I came home to see my husband drooling all over the place, waiting for dinner to be served. It was pretty salty, but that was probably my fault -- bouillon and onion soup mix are both salty. There was no slicing it because it kinda fell apart.

Absolutely Delicious! So easy to make too. It's only my husband and I so we had it for a couple of nights for dinner. I would heat the meat up with some of the dipping sauce in the microwave and it was not dry at all. I will make this again for sure. Next time I might add some seasoning like garlic powder and pepper. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty good.  I cooked it for about 10 hours and seasoned it well.  Edit:  I made this again with a few changes.  1) I used Campbells Consomme instead of broth.  2) I added a splash of worcestershire.  3) I used an Irish stout beer, Murphys.  4) I added onion and garlic powder.  5)  I used a chuck roast.  6)  Sliced the meat very thin before the last hour of cooking.  7)  Served with provolone cheese.

This was very good and SO easy! I followed the directions exactly, but added some Worcestershire, a package of quartered white mushrooms and a sweet onion thinly sliced. This made plenty of liquid and sliced very easily. I also sliced the beef and added back into the liquid for the last 40 minutes or so. Will definitely make again!

I was a little skeptical as this was cooking, but the finished result was yummy! I added lots of salt, pepper, and Worshershire Sauce. I sliced it up then added it back in the pot for about a half an hour. Then toasted some provolone cheese on the bread. Loved by all!

Very simple and really tasty.  I couldn't find condensed french onion soup so I used beef consume, no beef broth and a package of french onion soup/dip mix.  After reading the reviews I also sliced the beef and put it back in the juices for 30 minutes while I made the sides.  This will easily become a staple at my house.

Pretty dry and no flavor.  The buns were excellent and if they were dipped in the sauce it was even better.

So easy and so delicious! I have made the recipe several times, and the longer you let the meat cook and sit in its juices the better -- it will be tender and delicious.  I used Guinness beer and also added 1lb mushrooms to the slow cooker.  I will keep experimenting with other reviewers' suggestions but was very impressed with how the original recipe turned out. It is a hearty meal.

WOW!!! Amazing!!! I rubbed the rump roast with garlic and pepper before placing it in the slow cooker.  Used a dark beer (the whole bottle) and sliced the beef 40 minutes before it was to be served and put it in the juices and let it sit on the "warm" setting.  Simply delicious!!!

YUM YUM YUM! Delicous and easy! I ended up using a lite beer even though other reviewers said not to. My husband and I both like lite beer so I wanted to make sure it was  flavor we would like. About 30 minutes before serving I took the other reviewers advice and cut the meat then placed it back into the juices to cook a little bit more.  When serving I put the meat onto a warm buttered french roll as the recipe called for and then put a slice of provolone cheese on top and broiled it until melted. These were a huge hit for a dinner with friends and I would make/eat them regularly if rump roast wasn't almost 5 dollars a pound around here!

I used an eye or round roast for this. Cooked it on low for about 7 hours in 1 packet of onion soup mix, 1 can of beer, 2 boullion cubes, and 1 cup of water. I served it on 9 grain wheat bread with some BBQ sauce and Horseradish sauce, like you would find at Arby's. Gave each person a cup of the au jous. What a hit!! Even the kids loved it! They thought it was WAY better than Arby's. Both the Hubby and the kids requested this one again. It was delicious!!

I made this just last week for the first time!  All I can say is YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY and triply so on the encore (leftovers) a couple of days later when the beef had a chance to soak up more flavor from the sauce!!!!  It was a huge hit in our house.  So much so that my (mostly vegetarian) son asked me to make this for an upcoming Cub Scout Blue & Gold Banquet!!  

I also made some changes based upon reviews: dash of worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, dash of hot sauce.  This second time around, I'm going to add some Better Than Bouillon Beef Base for a bit more beefy punch.  

Oh so delish and hitting the top 10 of meals to make!!

This was incredible! Followed other reviews: sliced the meat and put it back into the broth. Keeps it moist and juicy. Was so easy. Assembled it the night before in the crockpot, kept it in the frig, then in the morning put the pot on the base and turned it on. Couldn't have been easier early in the morning.

Wished I'd listened to other reviewers and used a chuck.  Flavor was good.  Didn't have beer, so I used cola as per one reviewers suggestion.  Son asked for seconds and asked that I make it again.  That works for me :)

So easy and delicious.  I did not cook for the full 8 hours and the meat was fully cooked.  I guess it depends on the slow cooker you have.  The mozzarella on a toasted french roll added the perfect flavor.

I tried this on a Sunday for dinner.  Very good!  I thought the meat would never get done but if you leave it alone it eventally gets there.  A rump roast is a chewy cut of meat--I may try it with a more tender roast next time.  This was tasty.  I used some sub rolls.  I couldn't find a 4-lb. rump roast so I purchased two 2-lb. roasts and have cooked them together and frozen the one for another meal later (froze the au jus separately).  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was still awfully tough even after cooking for 8 hours.  I might just not like the taste of rump roast.  It might taste better with a slightly better cut of meat. It was good, but not as good as I was expecting.

The sauce was very good!  I used a pale ale and added minced garlic and a few dashes of steak sauce.  It would benefit from the addition of salt and spices according to preferences. Mine slow cooked for about 10 hours, the meat was tender, not dry at all.

OMG!!  This was delicious!  After reading a few reviews, I used a chuck roast and one can of french onion soup & one can of beefy mushroom soup.  The beer really does add a wonderful flavor to the meat.  It was SOOOO tender! The buttery, toasted rolls soak up the au jus and... Mmmmmmm!  This is a great sandwich! Oh, I used a shredded blend of cheddar and American cheeses which added a whole bunch of ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness to the party! I'll be making this again and again!

Great flavor, ease of preparation and simple cooking make this a new addition to my menu plans.  Use a pale basic American beer if you want to not taste the beer.  Darker beers (blacks) will give a bit of flavor. Flavor of this is so good, my leftovers barely make it past 24 hours.

After following suggestions from other reviewers, I think I've got the perfect sandwich.  (1) I added two cans of French onion soup, the beer, garlic and a couple of bay leaves.  (2) Seasoned the finished broth with a little salt/pepper and added a small sprig of fresh Rosemary when reheating the sauce. (3) I sliced crusty rolls and drizzled them with a little olive oil and popped them into the toaster oven until slightly browned; then ran a garlic clove over each side of the toasted roll. (4) I then started assembling the sandwhich; the sliced meat on the roll, sauteed onion and then a slice of cheese (I used Swiss because I had it on hand). (5) Lastly, I placed the "sammies" on a foil-lined sheet pan and covered them loosely with foil.  Left them in a 350 degree oven just long enough to melt the cheese.  My husband is the king of French Dips and he gave this recipe two thumbs up.  Can't argue with success.....will be making these again......they were outstanding!!!

This was tasty, and definitely easy. I had to use powdered soup mix after discovering that I'd accidentally picked up a can of cream of chicken instead of French onion, and instead of opening a bottle of beer, I used almost 1 cup of red wine. For some reason my family thought the idea of toasting the rolls was crazy, so we didn't, and also no one wanted to dip in the jus, but I thought the dipping was yummy!

Really good...really easy!  I got nervous reading other reviews saying they used a differnt kind of roast, when I had already gotten the rump roast. But it turned out just fine! I followed other reviews and added some worchester sauce, minced garlic, and onion powder.  I sliced it up and put back in the juice for about a half hour. I also used swiss cheese when heating the buns. My hubby & I like horseradish, too, so we added that to our buns. YUMMY! Will make this one again!

Amazing dish!  My boyfriend says it is the best homemade french dip that he has ever had.  I used a porter (dark beer) based on the reviews and it gave great flavor.  I also seasoned the meat with garlic salt, salt and pepper.  I drizzeled olive oil on the bread and broiled it with mont- jack cheese.  MMMM!  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy, and the au jous sauce is really good.  I would definitely suggest putting the meat back in the juice after you've sliced it very thin.  I used an electric knife to get the slices as thin as possible.  Also, be sure to use a crusty bread and toast it so that it stands up to dunking in that awesome sauce.

Perfect as is, sometimes I skip the beer and it is still delicious. I might try some of the additions suggested by other reviewers next time--could only improve the flavor! I have great success freezing this recipe, too, right in the broth. Keeps the meat super flavorful and makes for a quick supper that way. Thanks for the great and super easy recipe.

This was so easy and it taste wonderful. I ended up making mash potatoes and taking some of the juices to make gravy. I have  enough left over to make the sandwiches I want. Since there are only three of us I might even get another meal out of it. Thanks for the great recipe.

What a hit!  I've made this several times now,  used a variety of roasts or cuts and they're all good.  The poker team loves it!  I always use Guinness for that rich flavor.  I saute some peppers and onions one the side for those that want it and melt provolone on the rolls.  Put out lots of napkins and watch the feed fest!!  Really good with wasabi mayo, too!

Love it.   Easy and delicious.  I make this regularly now.  Butter and toast your french rolls to help keep them from getting soggy. Add a slice of provolone or swiss cheese and melt under the broiler for extra awesomeness!

This is so good and so easy! I've made it several times...definitely use a dark beer like Guinness and season the roast with garlic salt and onion powder as suggested. I use a can of beef consomme instead of the broth and add provolone cheese when toasting the roll. My teenagers and their friends love this! I made it this past weekend and seven teenagers showed up for dinner and several of their parents have asked for this recipe.

This recipe is amazing! My picky husband loved this. The roast cooks to perfection, and shreds easily with a fork. Even my 3 year old loved the dip. The only bad thing i have to say is that i hate beer, and realized the beer flavor and smell was strong. That is very easy to fix with garlic salt, and onion powder, 5 stars!!

This recipe gets the full 5 stars if you use the earlier suggestions of beef consomme instead of broth, add 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder and 1 Tbsp worchestershire sauce.  Do slice it with an hour left to go and add it back to the broth the final hour and broil cheese on the bread.  My WHOLE family loved this!!  My husband couldn't stop raving over it and informed me that I was definitely fixing this again!  (And-the leftovers were great over noodles.)

I used about 8 oz of Guiness beer as well as added 1 tsp. of salt, onion powder, garlic powder and worchestshire sauce.  Top round was the cut of meat recommended by my butcher.  They were perfect!  I don't think the beer is even necessary, I could taste it a little bit and think it might be even better without the beer.  The au jous was perfect, not to salty and not lacking flavor.  Thanks for such a delicious and easy recipe!

We love this recipe and make it every couple of weeks.  I use 1 tsp of liquid smoke; 3 tsp of Worcestershire; ½ tsp of minced garlic; 1 Lakefront Eastside Dark Beer (or whatever DARK beer is available!)  Do not use anything but dark!; 1 can of Campbell’s French Onion soup w/ beef stock; 1 can of double rich Campbell’s Beef Broth, 1 tsp of black pepper; 1 tsp of salt and then a 3 ½ to  4 pound roast.  I have used both rump roasts and sirloin tip roasts.  I am a working Mom, so I put all of my ingredients in the crock pot at night and place it in the refrig…..in the morning before I leave for work, I flip the roast and  cook for 8 to 10 hours on low.   We eat this on many varieties of sandwich rolls, but we always toast them.  My boys like for me to drain all of the juice off of the sandwich, but my husband like the messier version w/ lots of juice.  I always add a slice of cheese to each sandwich, based on our individual preference.  Leftover are great, but this freezes well too!!!!!  A BASIC in our house.

i haven't gotten around to reviewing this, but i've already made this so many times. everytime someone hears that i am making this, they ask if i can save them leftovers. it's so easy to make and it tastes unbelievable. the meat is just so tender and juicy.

i change very little, i use french onion soup and beef consomme. i choose cheap cuts of meat but usually trim all the fat off. there's really no need for it since it comes out entirely tender and all the fat just sits at the top of the cooker anyway. also i make sure to use guiness beer (the thicker, the better). also before i start cooking, i toss in a chopped onion and a couple cloves of garlic. my boyfriend wants me to add some mushrooms in as well. also, i took it out about an hour before serving and sliced the meat and put it back in for more cooking.

honestly, if i didn't even change anything about the recipe, it's still fantastic. i'm just addicted to garlic so i have to put some in everything. this is wonderful and my home smells great after a day of cooking! thank you for this wonderful recipe. it's difinitely a treasure in my box.

YUM! Like others I added a few shakes of Worcestershire, garlic powder and black pepper to the meat. Also, left out the beer and added a half of a packet of au jus to the liquid after everything was done. I will be making this again! Thank you!

This was a big hit with my family! After reading reviews I decided to add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder to the liquid. I also covered the meat in some garlic powder before sticking it in the crock pot. I was really concerned about the beer, as even after 5 hours I could smell it, but once it was done I didn't taste it at all.
The au jus was a little bland for my tastes, so I added an au jus packet to the liquid and let it simmer in the crockpot on high while I cut the meat up. I also added provolone cheese to the sandwiches. With those changes this came out PERFECT!

These were pretty good. I used a 2.75 lb roast. Cooked it for about 6 hours and thought that might have been a little too long. My suggestion would be to cook for 4-5 hours, remove meat from slow cooker and shred with two forks. Return to slow cooker and cook for another hour so meat can soak in more juice. When making sandwiches, top meat with sliced cheese. I also added a dash of worchestire sauce, a teaspon of garlic powder and black pepper to taste to the crock pot at the beginning.

The flavor  was good but even after cooking for the length of time directed, the roast was extremely tough.  I ended up removing it, slicing it thinly & placing the liquid & meat in a pan on the stove.  After boiling for an hour, it was finally tender enough.  I did use beef consomme instead.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I made  the recipe as written (used Guiness beer) but added some shakes of worchestire sauce, garlic powder, bay leaf, pepper and whole garlic gloves to the pan.  I used Turano bread rolls and put butter and garlic powder on them and grilled them in a pan for a few minutes to toast.  I then assembled the sandwiches and added shredded mozzarella cheese on top and put in under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese and make it golden brown.  Delish!   Will be making this one again and again.  Soooo easy!

This was fantastic!  I made several changes according to other reviews.  I used a 3 lb. bottom round roast.  Other reviews said this cut of meat tasted like leather, but mine was melt in your mouth delicious with a few modifications. I   rubbed the roast with garlic powder, and browned all sides in olive oil.  I cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours, used beef consomme instead of beef broth, and also added worchesterchire sauce to the recipe.  After 4 1/2 hours, I took the roast out, let it sit for 20 minutes and sliced it very thin, put the meat back in and turned the crockpot off for 4 hours, then turned the crockpot back on low for an hour before eating. I toasted french bread with provolone.  The meat was extremely tender and everyone's requesting that I make it again!

UPDATE FROM FIRST REVIEW:  I have now made this more than 100 times. I promise if you want a real hit at a pot luck, take this.  You will be the only one leaving with an empty soup pot!  HINT:  I always put a little note on the lid letting people know what it is and provide the buttered french stick right beside for easy grabbing. I never have stock left over for soup though when I take it somewhere.  I use eye of the round mostly but sometimes top sirloin and add a couple bay leaves and thyme.  As well DOUBLE THE LIQUID IN THIS RECIPE OR YOU WONT HAVE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE.  IT GOES FAST!  Definately a wonderful broth from this method and ingredients.  Thanks!  I managed, some how, to save some of the broth.  I added some shredded carrots and barley to it and threw it into the thermos to take skiing with us.  The people at the other table asked what we brought it smelled to so good.  I have another in the slow cooker now but I'm doubling the broth so I can make a bigger soup afterwards.   2 meals from one really.  Thanks for sharing!  Lorrie

What a tender, rich tasting sandwich, I am sitting here right now having finished my first sandwich and it was amazing....sooooooooo tender.  I did not add anything to it except some Worchestshire Sauce, no salt....later when you dip the sandwich in the juice, its the perfect flavor as is.  Everything followed the recipe to a "T", using a bottle of Newcastle beer. My husband and I started to prepare it around 8 pm last night and he actually took it off the slow cooker at 7:30 this morning, so it really cooked for almost 11 hours.  The meat literally almost fell apart, I didn't even have to slice it.  I did what another reviewer suggested and brushed the rolls with melted butter with garlic powder added, and melted provolone cheese on the roll before adding the shredded meat.  Pulled some broth from the slow cooker and put it in a small bowl, dipped it and took a bite...*eyes roll in back of head* Heaven.

Very simple dinner!  I am not a huge fan of this type of beef, but it was excellent.  I used a chuck roast,followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and it was fabulous.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone looking for a no-work slow cooker recipe.  Would probably be great for a Super Bowl party!  Thanks for submitting!

My husband is one of the pickiest eaters in the entire world and he loved this recipe. The next day you can make cold beef sanwiches with the leftovers for lunches.

**GREAT**  We had this tonight & everyone here loved it--even my picky 8 year old!  I browned a 4 lb. Sirloin Tip; added 2 minced cloves of garlic & a sprig of fresh rosemary, which I always use to flavor beef. As for the beer, I used a full bottle of Samuel Adams Cream Stout. Everyone was surprised about that, as you could not detect any beer in it. I cooked the roast on low setting for 3 hrs, took it out & let it rest, then sliced it real thin.  Placed it back into the pot for 2 more hours. Toasted some hoagie rolls & melted provolone cheese as others have suggested. NICE!!

Easy and delicious! This smells so good in the slow cooker, and if you leave it in there long enough, the beef goes tender. I usually add a pinch of garlic powder in there just for extra flavour. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

Terrific! The meat was moist and tasty. I added 1/4 cup Worstershire sauce for depth of flavor and color, and strained out the onions before serving. Rather than buttering and heating the rolls, I simply toasted them under the broiler, then topped with generous portions of sliced meat and Provolone cheese then ran them under the broiler again until the cheese was melted. A very satisfying sandwich.

I refuse to cook a roast any other way.  I do add worcestershire sauce, minced garlic and occasionally I add mushrooms or omit the beer or add liquid smoke.  I also add provolone or swiss cheese to the top and broil for just a minute.  I also take the leftover and make beef stew or vegetable beef soup with it.  Many great ways to recycle the meat.  I also cook pork roast for pork bbq by this recipe!  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!!!

I have been making this for years, and I can tell you it is the best ever!  I highly recommend using split hard rolls.  They hold up better when dipped in the au jus...  Also...we 'kick it up a notch' by making the sandwiches open faced, adding adornments such as sauteed onions, mushrooms, peppers (to your liking) and then broiling with a couple slices of swiss cheese till it melts together.  It is one of my all time favorite comfort foods.

This was very good!  The only thing I would change is to rub the roast with some seasonings such as salt, pepper and maybe onion before putting in the crock pot.

This recipe, although fast and easy, didn't impress us in the least, and we didn't keep the leftovers.  The meat was wonderfully tender, but the broth tasted just like what it is, canned soup and beer.  Rather like licking the inside of a tin can.  It also had a canned mushroom taste, which was  odd since there weren't any in it.It wasn't worth doctoring up.  Sorry.

So when I first made this recipe, I was a little disappointed... I would have given it a 3, because even though it is super easy my boyfriend and I felt it was a littl bland. However, I love French Dip so we decided to give it another go, but used a few of the suggestions from other reviewers. Before I started the slow cooker, I added fresh ground pepper, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some onion powder (probably about a 1/2 tablespoon), and a dash of Worchestershire. SO GOOD! It's totally a 5 now! We were thinking about omitting the butter, but it's a MUST on a toasted sweet roll. 7 hours is the perfect cooking time for a 4 lb. of meat; I suggest making some deep cuts in the meat like an hour before it's done. Yum!

I've prepared this many times for my family, and we love it.  I do make a few changes, I rub the beef with salt, cracked pepper and garlic powder than brown on the stovetop before adding to the crockpot.  It gives the meat much better flavor and color.  After I add the roast to the crockpot, I brown a sliced onion in the drippings in the skillet and then add to the meat.  Used low salt onion soup mixes because the first time I made this it was salty.  I serve this with the onion, sauted mushrooms, and swiss cheese.  Just slip the sandwiches under the broiler to melt before serving.

This was really good.  I made the mistake of using a boneless blade roast which was way too fatty, so our juice was quite greasy.  But once I got most of the grease separated from the dipping sauce it was really good.  I'll definitely make this one again!

I made this a couple nights ago for my husband and me and neither of us were incredibly impressed. It's a great recipe for beginners, but any seasoned cook would know that you can get the same taste, and a little fresher taste, by omitting the french onion soup and just using a fresh onion and a few handy spices. Maybe for me (who cooks all the time) it was just a little too simple. To be fair, it is a great easy recipe if you don't cook much or don't know how to cook.

Excellent! The meat gets very tender and moist, and the sauce is awesome. Do be sure to either take the meat out in time to slice it before it gets to the "shredding" stage, or slice it a little before it's done, and put the slices back in for a little while. Served with sauteed onions & green peppers, sliced pepperoncinis, and buttered/toasted hoagie bread with melted swiss and provolone cheese slices. The "condiments" took it a little past the dipping stage, but this recipe is great even if you have to use a knife and fork.

My whole family loved this.  I did make a few changes that worked well.  Because I didn't have the soup that it called for I used a box of beef broth and added 1t. rosemary, 1 t. garlic powder, 1t. thyme and a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix (the dry stuff).  The broth had great flavor.  I also took the advice of others and cut it into thin slices after it had cooked several hours.  This helps it really get tender and absorb all of the flavors.  I also melted provolone cheese slices on the bread while toasting.  Delicious!

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I did add just a dash of worcestershire sauce, black pepper, garlic powder and ground thyme (can't help myself!) but the meat was tender and the sauce savory.  I buttered the sliced sub rolls and grilled them and served the sandwiches with onions carmelized with butter and sugar and with slices of american cheese (would have used provolone but didn't have any).  Delicious!  We couldn't detect the taste of beer at all - it just added to the flavor.  I also seared the outside edges in butter in a saute pan first and cooked it on high for the first two hours.  Nice easy recipe, thanks!

the Au Jus was just to bland for me, so i added 2 beef broth cubes, and some minced garlic...at the end of 7 hours the roast was just too dry for my tastes, IF i make this again i will cook it for less time. we only ate half of it, and cut up the rest for chili.

Great flavor. I did trim the exterior fat and brown the roast before putting it it the crock pot. However there was a little more fat in the French Dip than I wanted. The next time I am going to prepare it one day ahead. This way I can skim the fat off the top of the liquid and the beef is easier to slice thin when it has been chilled. I liked other reviewers suggestions for adding onions, provolone cheese or mushrooms to the final sandwich.

This was so good.  I used a 2 1/2 pound bottom roast, Campbell's French Onion soup, Beef Consumme, and Liptons Beefy Onion Soup Mix, and 1/2 can water.  Cooked on low for 3 hours then turned to high for 3 more.  Toasted the rolls and added provolone cheese.  The kids even loved it.

I love this recipe. I make it exactly like the original recipe except I put slits in the roast and insert slivers of garlic. I have always done this with any roast I cook. I also have cooked it on top of the stove. I brown the meat, add soups and beer and cook for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. I try to give myself time to cool and chill the meat and slice it thin and use the juice to make a thickened gravy by making a roux of 2 T flour and 2 T butter for every cup of liquid. I then add the sliced meat back into the hot gravy and keep hot in crockpot on low. We then make Hot Beef Sandwiches which my family likes more than the au jus type.

I have made this several times with variations on liquid and spices. My favorite version is substituting dried onion soup mix for the canned and adding a half a cup of Bold and Spicy A1 sauce.  I use light beer and find that you can't taste the beer but it helps tenderize the meet.  Slicing the beef thin and adding back to the juice for awhile is a must.

Amen to the last two reviews, I love to drink beer (On Wisconsin) but I don’t like to eat it.  One taste and the beer just overwhelmed.  Also, would not bother spending the money for the rather expensive onion soup, with the cooking time a nice chopped onion gave same results with more flavor. Cooked my roast for another hour on high to get it tender.

I made this tonight for dinner with a salad - It was Awesome ! My husband LOVED it, I also thought it was Delicious! I will definately add this one to my favorites and will make it again and again. UPDATE - I make this always as it is in recipe but sometimes I double the sauce - I like my meat covered when making it in the crock pot. With the extra sauce, add sautéed sweet onions and heat on stove for a wonderful onion soup. YUMMY !!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - so easy and so yummy !!

Really good french dip "juice" but I had to make the beef a little longer than the recipe called for.  Since this is just for my husband and myself, after I cut off some for the sandwiches, I cooked some carrots, potatoes and onions in the juice in the crockpot, thickened it with a little flour and had a great beef stew the next night.

It turned out wonderful.  I used a 2 1/2lb rump roast and didn't change the proportions of the rest of the ingredients.  I also cooked it, by mistake, on slow in the crock pot for 12 hours instead of 7.  It still came out very moist.  Slice it very thin. It is a little tough if sliced thick.

LOVED IT!!!  I used a top sirloin roast and it turned out so tender and tasty.  This is one I'll make over and over.  Extremely easy...took only 5 minutes to throw the ingredients into the crock pot and let sit for the afternoon.  I added a few extra seasonings like garlic powder and oregano. Wonderful recipe!

I am always looking for good recipes for the slow cooker, being a working mom.  This was definitely a crowd pleaser.  Indeed you can taste the beer in the flavor of the meat but thats a plus with my family.

This is one of the easiest and most consistently delicious recipes I've ever tried.  It is very easy to make substitutions in this recipe as well.  I usually don't have French Onion soup at home so I sometimes substitute water with beef boullion and half a package of dry onion soup mix (this actually gives it more intense flavor, not as diluted.)  You can also use other roasts.  Even a pot roast will taste great, although the meat will be shredded rather than sliced.  Best of all, there is practically NO prep time...just throw everything in a crockpot and go!

Delicious recipe, my husband loved it and wants more for dinner tomorrow!  I browned the roast before cooking in Crockpot.  I used 1/2 of a can of soup, and 1/2 a can of low sodium broth and used 1/2 a pint of Guinness!  Served it thinly sliced on French rolls with melted cheese, and grilled onions, mushrooms and peppers!   Very inexpensive and very yummy soul food!

The Staff at BeefRecipe has modified this recipe.  The recipe does indeed call for a rump roast now -- and not a rump roast and/or a chuck roast!  Happy Cooking!

I admit, I was skeptical.  I didn't really think it would be good, but it was!  I did make one slight change.  I used dried onion soup mix because that was all I had on hand.  Great recipe!

I sliced the meat thin and cooked for 1 more hour.
This tastes even better left over.  It gets more tender

Unfortunately, I used what I had, 2xs.  Instead of onion soup can, I used a packed of dry salad dressing mix, extra water and lots of dried onions.....FABULOUS! .....This time I used 1 beer, 1 1/2 tsp bullion and 2 packets of onion soup mix , with water to suffice recipe....FABULOUS! ....This time, May 7, 2018 , 5 lb rump roast fat side up into cooker after searing, 1/4 packet Ranch Dip,  1 packet Good Seasons Italian salad dressing mix, 1 packet Lipton Onion Soup mix, 1 pat of butter, 1 10 oz beer, and 2 cups hot water all mixed together. It needed more salt and flavor, maybe soy sauce and another onion soup packet.  Aujus was perfect. Feb 1, 2019 1 & 1/2 onion soup packet, 1 tsp bullion, beer, & water to suffice...I used a pot roast , maybe that was why it was not so great. It seemed bland w/o the au jus which was greasy bc I did not cut the fat off the meat. July 29, 2019 : 3 lb pot roast rubbed w/ 1/2 ranch packet, seared in pan,  1/2 onion sliced, 5 cloves of garlic sliced. In 1 cup hot water I mixed 1 onion soup and 1 Tbsp bouillon, rest of ranch packet,  splash of white wine, splash of apple cider vinegar. Slow cooker on low for  2.5-3 hours. Came out great! The ACV kicked it up a notch.

First recipe I've ever rated and this one was a must!  Delicious!  Added the Consomme and garlic salt, sliced the beef one hour before serving to further marinate.  Used Bolillo rolls because that's all we had but worked perfectly.  Entire family loved it, licked their plates clean.  This recipe is absolutely in my recipe box to use in the near future.

Following the recipe exact ly, I rate it 4 stars. It was great. But then I was making a smaller roast so I only used the french onion soup and a bottle of Blue Moon, and I give that 5! It was so flavorful and so easy!

Great but...Au jus was a bit watered down and not as flavorful as hoped.  I ended up adding about 3 tbs of soup base which rocked it!

This is a great way to make one of my favorite sammies.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used beef consomme instead of beef broth.  When I make it again, I'll use 2 cans of french onion soup, 2 cans of beef consomme and I'll brown the roast on all sides, using some beef broth and balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan.  Also, a little salt is nice.  Since I was a little late getting it in the crock pot, I cooked it on high for 5 hours, which worked just fine.  The family definitely wants this on the regular rotation.

Just made it for "game night". I added garlic powder/onion powder/season salt/paprika/pepper and did a dry rub - then browned the meat.I also added worstershire sauce to the beer/onion soup & beef broth.I actually left it over night and then cooked the next day. I sliced then put back in the Au Ju, I had swiss cheese & provolone & portuguese rolls - people made their own. Was easy and everyone enjoyed it - gave the recipe to everyone.

This is great. We have added this to our meal rotation and make once every 6 weeks or so. Great flavor, and even better left over the next day. We melt provolone on some lightly buttered rolls, bake for a few and then serve with a small side bowl of the dipping sauce. My son loves to add a bit of horseradish sauce to his. GREAT RECIPE

This cut of meat was awful. Please, please fellow reviewers..if you are going to rate something 5 stars, make sure the MAIN INGREDIENT is not changed!! The meat was chewy and had bad flavor even after following all directions perfectly!! Very disappointing!!

Super easy and tasty recipe.  We have a lot of venison and elk roast/steaks to use and the crockpot is a necessity for a busy family.  I simply used a couple packages of game to get to 4lbs and followed the recipe with one substitution (I didn't have cream of onion so I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix with an appropriate addition of liquid).  Oh, and we're a horseradish loving family, so we served that at the table as well.

This is a fantastic French Dip Sandwich! We make it quite frequently and I have shared with family and friends. I have added onion soup packets and/or also more onions as we love onions in this house! I will usually pop the meat on the bread, throw on some provolone or swiss, blast it for a second in the broiler and then put them back together. Thanks for sharing with us!

This was delicious. I decided to double the au jus recipe, but only used one 12 oz bottle of beer, a dark winter ale. I added worchestershire (not too much), a little bit of tabasco sauce for zing, garlic, mushrooms, green peppers, sweet onion, salt, pepper, and savory. I got a great cut of meat from my local butchers (who always ask what I am making and choose the best cut, then upon return asked how it turned out)If you have a local butcher I suggest you go there, a little more $$ but well worth it. I was advised to leave fat on until 130 degrees, then removed roast, cut off fat, sliced and returned to broth. I used sourdough bread toasted with provolone cheese.............I thought my boyfriend was going to propose marriage after having this dish.

This recipe made my house smell amazing while it cooked; my mouth watered waiting for it to be finished.  However, I was skeptical because I took of the lid of the slow cooker and got the overwhelming smell of beer.  I don't like beer; I never have.  "You can't taste the beer!"  Yes, I can.  Not saying it's bad; this is the first time I've liked something beer-related.  Put this meat on the buttered, toasted bread with some provolone cheese and dip the sandwich in the sauce--yum, absolutely awesome sandwich.  But the beer thing?  Still a little off-putting.

I made this recipe and served it to 8 people, which includes myself and my 5 yer old.  I substituted a london broil for the chuck roast as I find chuck roast to be too "stringy" and tough in general, even out of the slow cooker. 5 out of the 8 people indicated they enjoyed it, with three of those people having seconds (and thirds).   I didn't like it for both the texture of the meat and I thought the flavor wasn't that good, but then I had used Becks so next time I might try for more of a heavier porter.  That all being said 3 people asked me for the recipe.

We make this a lot and do not make any changes to the way it is cooked.  Though sometimes it doesn't take so long to cook.  It's also good if you cut up the meat after it is done, add fried mushrooms and green peppers, and serve over egg noodles.

Sooo delicious with lots of room for changes! We couldn't find some ingredients, so we used a round roast instead of rump and Liptons onion soup mix instead of French Onion soup in a can. I messed up some of the measurements for the Beef Broth, Soup, and Beer in the slow cooker. Still turned out great! We made Au Jus gravy as a dipping sauce for the sandwiches, which was amazing, and a Garlic Cheddar Mashed Potato recipe (from McCormick, on their website) as a side dish. The potato dish really complimented the sandwiches, and the Au Jus was just... DIVINE as a dip. This recipe, along with the Garlic Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, will be a new regular in our kitchen.

This has become a staple in our home. It is the most-requested meal by far! I can't imagine anything easier or more tasty! I've given this recipe to many friends and they all rave about it as well. I've found that we like it best when made with a darker beer such as Guinness or New Castle.

I'm telling you this was AWESOME! However I did make a few minor adjustments. I sprinkled the meat with salt, pepper and soy sauce then seared it on all sides. This enhances the flavor of the meat, I promise you won't be let down. For the broth, I used one can of beef consommé, French onion soup, beef broth, and one beer. I sprinkled in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of browning sauce. You can add in a beef bullion cube for even more added flavor but is good with or without the bullion. I buttered the rolls and added sliced provolone/mozzarella cheese and put them in the oven. I tell you what....this was beyond good. I had company over that raved over this meal. It is indeed restaurant quality!

This is awesome!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and swapped the beef broth for some beef consommé.  I also seasoned my chuck roast with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion salt.  I added an onion to the crock pot as well.  I used 6 oz of Guinness beer and could not tell it was in there at all but I think it really helped the flavor.  I buttered some hoagie buns and fried them in a pan and then put some cheese on and melted it in the oven for a few mins.  Then piled on the meat and some of the onions from the crock pot.  I cooked it overnight for about 9 hours and then just shredded the meat.  It smelled so good in the morning that we ate them for breakfast and it was incredible!!!  Even my 2 year old was scarfing down the meat by itself.  Will definitely make these again!

I put this in the crock pot this morning for dinner tonight. I made it exactly by the recipe. I found it to be good but I did end up doctoring up the au jus just a bit. I poured it from the crock into a saucepan and added a little salt and black pepper, some browning sauce, some garlic powder and some Worcestershire sauce. I simmered it for a few minutes. It was even better then. I also added a slice of provolone cheese to the bread before toasting. This was very good and my husband loved it too. I  served it with a side of broccoli salad. I will definitely make this again.

This was huge!  Wonderful and easy!  I used the French onion soup, Consomme and bud lite.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, black pepper and worchestshire sauce as well.  Next time I will add a 1/2 of an onion sliced thinly for topping the sandwiches.  My husband had his sandwich with provalone and I had mine with horseradish cheddar.  It is great with extra horseradish!  The kids ate their whole sandwich!

I give it four stars because there was way too much "beer" taste for mine and my fiancé's liking. I had to add some brown sugar, more beef bullion cubes (about 10 after I got the desired taste) and some more Worchester sauce to make it taste not so beer-y. I only used half a bottle of beer, too! Next time I'll probably just leave the beer out. Other than that, it was good!

Absolutely Great! I have made this 8-10 times, I like to use a dark beer and a chuck roast. I add 2 things to mine, first rosemary about a tablespoon chopped and a little seasoning salt. The Au jus makes a great gravy if you like to make open face sandwiches. I just reduce a bit and thicken it with cornstarch, I use Ciabatta bread halved with 2 slices of Swiss cheese top that with meat and gravy Ahhh so yummy!

A favorite of the hubby! I added some provolone to the buns before broiling. It smelled great when it was cooking and was the perfect meal for a cool fall evening. I cooked it on high for about 4 hours and the meat was still plenty tender and shredded easily. Next time I might follow the advice of other reviewers and add a little garlic, black pepper, and extra salt to the meat before cooking.

OMG!!  I made these yesterday for dinner, they were soooo good!!  I had to make some changes because I REALLY wanted to try this but didn't have everything listed.  I used a London Broil (Sirloin cut), a bottle of dark beer, a pkg of dry onion soup mix, and a can of condensed soup.  I coated the meat in garlic powder and just dumped everything else on top, went to work and came home to the most awesome smell!  I did as others said and butter the rolls (got Portuguese rolls), then cover both sides in mozzarella cheese, back under the broiler to melt and then topped it with this awesome tasting meat!!  My husband (who is going through chemo and funny with foods) said you have to make this again!!  If I could give this more stars I would and I'm going to use this for my pot roasts in teh future!!  Thank you for sharing, next time I'll get the meat you have listed!

Definately a keeper in our house. I threw in some 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I only had 3 lbs of beef, so I only used 1/2 can of beer. Simply and quick meal. Thanks lonwolf32

I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect. I am a VERY new cook and this is now one of my go-to recipes. It is really easy and tastes FANTASTIC.
(Don't use a beer that's too hoppy though. I cooked with an IPA and it was a bit much). The best time I used regular old canned Miller Light.

Perfect!  I followed the comments about adding 1 T worcestershire, 1/2 t onion powder, 1/2 t garlic powder.  I didn't have 7 hours so I sliced the meat in half horizonatlly, cooked on high for 1 1/2 hours and low for 4 then sliced the meat and returned to juices on low for 20 minutes or so.

My 8 year old wants to give this 27 stars!  Seriously, this was easy and yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I added a Tbsp. each of garlic and Worcestershire sauce as per other reviewers. I also added provolone cheese to my sandwiches and melted it.  I used a chuck roast because it is what I had in the freezer.  It was very fatty.  I think next time I will choose a leaner cut of meat.

OMG. Instant favorite in heavy rotation! I didn't have the condensed soup so I used beef broth/onion soup mix packet. The cut I had on hand was cubed stew beef.  For beer used Molson XXX. And of course I added fresh garlic/onion (like I do to pretty much everything). Cooked on low for 9 hours or so. Came out insanely delicious! Thank you for this one!

We love this! I've made it several times with some changes. We don't usually have beer around so I omitted that. A couple of times, I made my homemade french onion soup, then add the roast to that. It's soooo good! We use the soup for dipping and instead of butter, I melt provolone cheese on the french rolls under the broiler.

This was awesome!  This was so easy to make.  We had company over and everyone loved this.  I sauteed some onions and made a creamy horseradish sauce to put on it along with a slice of deli provolone.  Yum!!

Rated 4 start because of the way the recipe was written.  Did a couple of modifications which made this a 5 star meal.  I took the recommendations of other reviews and used beef consume for the broth.  I also added garlic.  Served with provolone melted cheese, it was excellent

The flavor was great. I need to figure out how to adjust the cooking time on my slow cooker. Even at an hour less than the recipe called for, the meat was still over done.

I have made this twice now - the only change has been to spread the rolls with butter and garlic, and slices of provolone before baking and adding the beef. Serve with mashed potatoes - the AU jus make a delicious gravy! Highly recommend

Followed recipe exactly. I did as another reviewer suggested and cut up meat 1 hour before serving then put back in juice in crock pot. Used Provolone cheese on top. Reason for not giving 5 stars is we felt it needed some more flavor. Not sure what it is but with tinkering this will be a keeper

Agree with everyone else. Needs extra seasoning but good flavor. Added salt, pepper and 3 cloves garlic. Added salt pepper and garlic salt once shredded.

This was really good! I used a package of beef and onion soup mix instead of french onion. It was a bit salty, but everyone ate it right up. The kids liked just dipping the bread in the sauce and eating it! My husband can't wait for me to make again!

This was DELICIOUS! I followed some of the recommendations of other reviewers and added onion powder, garlic and a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce.  Heated buttered rolls with mozzarella cheese.  Didn't have a Guiness beer, so had to make do with Shiner Bock. My family devoured it!

Used a chuck roast as others suggested.  I also coated the entire roast with tons of salt, pepper and garlic powder then seared in a smoking hot pan before adding to the crockpot.  This gave a great crust and added to the depth of flavor.  The meat was beyond tender and literally melted in our mouths.

This was good and easy, I couldn't find rump roast in my grocery store so I used a round bottom roast instead.  It was too tender to be sliced so we just shredded it instead.  I served the sandwiches with provolone and the au jus, and mashed potatoes.

Good for sandwhiches or served over mashed potatoes.  I didn't have French onion soup so I  added some aus jus to it and some chopped onions and it turned out great.  This allows you to control the salt content a bit

Yum!  I read many of the reviews.  I doubled the recipe, used 8 lb rump roast (perfect consistancy), beef stock (est 20 oz), 1 can of cond. french onion soup, some diced fresh roosemary, 1.5 bottles of beer, some black pepper and  garlic powder on top.  Cooked overnight for ewst 8 hr, let cool & refrigerate.  Turned crock pot back on day of event on high & all was ready to go in 3.5 hr.  Delicious & a big hit!

OK so We through this together thinking easy and delicious because of a lot of reviews raved as to how good it was. Well in my opinion it missed the mark 2 fold. The auju turned out oily The meat came out bland. Definitely need to look into spices. Cant rely on just the soup and broth to provide all of them next time. Also I think cooking it half the time as a whole roast and then thin slicing to finish it off may add to the flavor of the meat. We will try this recipe again and I will update my results accordingly!!!!

OUTSTANDING!!  My husband and 10 year old son abslutely loved this!!  So did I of course.  I made this on the stove top in a pot because I realized I didnt defrost anything for dinner and this was the only thing defrosted.  So I let it simmer for 3 hours and it worked well.  I cant wait to do it in the crock pot tho, this is the perfect meal for it.  I bought regular rolls and buttered them and added garlic powder and lightly toasted them in the oven.  I also bought provolne cheese to put on the sandwiches.  If using garlic on the bread and provolone cheese doesnt make this an authentic french dip, I could care less because they were so tasty.  The dipping sauce it makes was perfect, tasty and not saltey.  I had a logger beer so thats what I used.  My only regret was not having enough rolls, I had 6 and could have used 8.  I only used a 3 pound roast as well.  This is a winner, simple and delicious!

Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe.  Took advise from others and added Worcestershire and Kitchen Bouquet (approx 2 TBSP) during cooking then cut up meat and put back in pot along with a sliced red onion and mushrooms about 45 minutes prior to serving.  Served on rolls with cheese after toasting in toaster oven.  Rave reviews!

This was delicious. I Didn't have frnch onion soup so I made my own with a beef boullion cube and 1 cup of water and then sauteed half an onion and added that to the recipe, I also did add two more boullion cubes and some garlic powder and onion powder and couple shakes of worchestershire sauce like others did. Then made sandwiches with the meat and topped with sauteed musrooms, onions, and green peppers, topped that with provolone and swiss cheese and broiled it. YUM!!!!

Delicious! I added provolone and sauteed mushrooms and onions. I also made it the day ahead in the slow cooker and refrigerated it overnight to let the juices soak in. I was a little worried the dark beer would over-power the taste, but it was so good!

Very good and very easy!  Our only change was adding provolone cheese to the sandwiches and sticking them back in the oven to melt the cheese.  

My 5-year old daughter walked in the door after school and said, "Wow! What smells so good?"

Very Very good!!! I added some onion, red peppers and green peppers to the slow cooker and then when it was all finished put melted mozzerella chees on the roll so it was like a philly cheese steak sandwich. My husband LOVED it and bragged to all of his friends at work!  Will be making again and again!

Delicious!  Used Guinnes Draught as I have in other recipes that call for beer - can't go wrong! And used a Sirloin Tip Roast - same price per pound as the other and the sirloin has a much better flavor.  This one's a keeper!

Such a great, easy recipe!  I use Guinness for regular.  To make it gluten free, I use Bard's Beer and Wolfgang Puck French Onion Soup (it is not condensed, but works).

I was so disappointed in this recipe after it got such great reviews. I love French Dips but this recipe was just ok. But the left overs the next day were wonderful. My meat seemed overcooked and dry, the meat didn't slice instead it just fell apart. I used Coors Lite because thats what I had, next time I will try a darker beer. The sauce was oily and lacked flavor. I ended up transfering the sauce to a pan and boiled it down a bit, and added a cube of chicken boulion because that was all I had. Overall this was ok. I added a slice of swiss cheese, which was great. I think I will give the recipe another try though and cook the meat less. Next time I will use a darker beer, cook less and some spices. It was way better reheated.

This was fantastic!!  I made it exactly as shown, and it was so delicious.  I normally get a less expensive cut of meat, but splurged on the rump roast.  Good decision.  The meat was literally apart.  Hubby & both my kids loved it, and the kids are rather picky.

Nice meaty flavor but kind of bland. Even with sliced onions and fresh minced garlic thrown in at the beginning. I think this could be better with spices thrown in.

I left out the beer because I didn't have any on hand.

I also used Chuck Roast instead and added garlic powder and pepper to taste (about 1 tsp each) then I also sprinkled some Worcestershire sauce on the roast on both sides while in the slow cooker.

One of the reviews suggested toasting the rolls with some mozzarella cheese - delicious idea! It turned out great! Definitely one to add to the recipe box for an easy dinner!

This was extremely easy to make. It really is as easy as dumping everything into a crockpot and waiting 7 hours. It was a little bland for my taste, so next time I will try and jazz it up a bit. I like the idea of adding Worcestershire sauce and possibly some salt and garlic. This recipe is great if you're looking for something simple and good.

This had great flavor. So easy. That's what slow cooking should be. Grilled some onions & mushrooms, put provolone on top of the beef, before the bun. Delish. Great AuJus too.

Not exactly what I was expecting. The meat was tender but didn't slice well at all so ended up shredding it. I also didn't care for the the flavor of the juice, it was kind of bland and just tasted funky. This would have been best to just throw in carrots and potatoes, eliminate the beer and to  make a roast rather than french dips. Won't use again.

Followed this recipe almost exactly, but I did melt some provolone cheese on the sandwich.  It was a huge hit.  It's definitely going in the rotation.  The meat was moist and flavorful.  No one would ever know there was beer in it.  Will make again for sure!!

This actually turned out a little on the dry side for me....maybe I kept it in the crock pot too long.  Once I smothered it with cheese it seemed to be a little better.

It was good, nothing to rave over however. I used a beef bouillon cube + water, packet of garlic-onion soup mix + water, can of Molson M beer, Worcestershire sauce & seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, pepper & seasoned salt). I halved the recipe and there was plenty. I'm not sure if I'll make it again (I don't usually have all these ingredients on hand), but it was worth trying.

It smelled delicious while cooking, but was disappointed with how bland the au jus tasted. Should have used a darker beer and more seasonings as suggested by other reviewers. I won't make this again.

I added a chopped onion and did a little salt, pepper and garlic power rub before throwing in the crock. Next time I will definitely so a serious spice rub - even with the beek stock and soup, it needed salt. We are also going to add carrots and celery for flavor.  GREAT HINT: Serve with horseradish-mayo and sharp provolone. Before placing the provolone on the meat, dip it in the aus jus.

Awesome and easy.  The hardest part was trimming the fat and that only took about two minutes.  I cooked this for about 10 hours on low heat and it came out perfectly tender and moist.  The sandwiches were amazing and even better left over.  I will definately be making these again.  Don't change a thing to this great recipe!

I've made this a few times, but had never reviewed.  I just made again yesterday and determined I really needed to review.  It is such a simple recipe, and yet the flavor is so good.  I didn't change a thing (a rarity for me).  The beer gives such a nice tang in the background.  I sometimes don't bother with the sandwich, just serve with mashed potatoes and vegies and my family loves it!!!!  Another bonus, it makes the house smell so good!!!!

Absolutely delicious!!  and couldn't be easier!  Only things I changed were making the buttered bread garlic bread and adding provolone before putting the meat on the rolls so it melted. Served with twice baked potatoes.  Fabulous.  :)

Super easy to make. I like that it didn't have that overtly italian oregano flovor. Worth trying a few cuts of beef to find your favorite. The meat is on the bland side but once you add the toasted butter rolls and provolone it was delish! Next time I will doctor it up a bit more. There will definitely be a next time.

Not exactly what I was hoping for. I also added garlic & onion powder, sauteed onions, mushrooms & peppers. Probably won't add this to my rotation since it was bland & a little tough.

I would have given this recipe 10 stars if the software allowed it.  The only thing I added to the recipe was 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic - not because this recipe lacks anything but just because we love garlic in our household.  Thanks for the great recipe - Oh! and I also used Guiness as my beer of choice in cooking this great sandwich.

I followed the recipe to the T and the only thing I would change is the cooking time.  7 hours was wayyyy too long.  I also spiced the roast with onion & garlic powder, black pepper and red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Other than the meat being over cooked, it had a good flavor.  I would make it again and probably cut an hour off of the cooking time.

I'm giving this 5 stars, because even though I botched it, I can see the potential for greatness!  How is it possible to botch something with 4 ingredients, you ask?  Easy - use the wrong beer.  I shopped for and made this on a Sunday, so I couldn't pick up a beer specifically for the recipe.  I figured the hubby would have something suitable in the beer fridge, but no dice.  He usually has a good selection, but all he had left was a Summit EPA (which he didn't recommend) but since everything else was in the crockpot already, there was no going back.  (Clearly, organization was not high on my list that day).  Summit EPA is, indeed, a terrible choice for this.  It's pretty hoppy out of the bottle, and stewing for 7+ hours doesn't change that - if anything, it makes it more pronounced.  The au jus was, to my great dismay, downright bitter.  LOTS of salt and plenty of bread and cheese later, it was edible, but no where near how good I imagine it *can* be.  The meat took up only a tiny bit of bitterness so it was still good, and it was amazingly tender.    I plan on making this again next week, but will definitely plan ahead and stock up on Guinness or something similar.

Made this for supper last night. Added a little garlic powder to the broth (~1/2 tsp). Served it w/ fresh rolls and homemade beer bread. Fresh grated parmesan, sauted peppers, onions & mushrooms to go on it. It was delicious. Definitely going to be a regular during cold months. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is amazing.  I used a chunch roast, and although it did not slice well, it still shredded to nice sandwich sized chunks.    As advised by another review, I added oregano, thyme, and soy sauce.  I used three builion cubes dissolved in 2 cups of water with one packet of french onion soup and Shiner beer. It was fantastic.  This is a recipe worth sharing...

I love, love, love this. I have made it 4 times and it gets rave reviews every time. I always add the provolone cheese and it is delicious! I follow the recipe for the beef exactly but I do slice and put it back in the au jus before serving.

Something is missing in this recipe. I added a sliced onion, garlic, and worshteshire sauce, and it still tasted blah. I think this recipe has potential, but the meat needs to be seasoned somehow. I will try again, maybe pan searing the meat before putting in the slow cooker.

I was desperate for a crock pot roast recipe.  I've made traditional pot roasts in the past and have always been let down.  I also needed a recipe based on what was in my pantry so I chose this one.  It's so easy but, more importantly, super yummy.  Even my SUPER PICKY 9 year old (who fought me over having to eat this) ate two helpings of this and requested it again two nights later.  I did serve it on plates with side dishes and not on bread and I also added garlic powder and Worcestershire Sauce to the pot before cooking.  I also turned the roast once during cooking.

I made this for my family for Christmas Eve dinner because I needed something easy to put together since I worked all day.  I uaed a pre-seasoned sirloin tip and cooked it for about 8 hrs. on low.  After I sliced it, I put it back in it's juices while the buns were baking.  I baked then broiled hogee buns with shredded italian cheese.  My whole family raved about the sandwiches.  My husband said it was better than what you can get in a resterant. My kids said it's their new favorite meal.  Don't even hesitate to make this.  It's wonderful!

This was good, but the meat just sort of fell apart and was not "sliceable". It looked more like a chopped beef french dip sandwich. The flavor was really good though. Also, I used a packet of onion soup mix instead of the condensed soup and it still worked well.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed some of the other tips and season the roast with onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper.  Then add a bit of worcestershire sauce. I also sautee a sweet onion and melt provolone chees on top before serving.  This is one of my husbands favorite dinners.

This is one of my familys favorites!!!!!!  I make this often! It is so quick & easy to throw in the crockpot before I head off to work.  I can put the meat in frozen too!!  I do find that guinness beer works the best!!!  Thanks for a new family favorite!!

Used beef consomme, a bottle of Guiness and added worcestershire sauce...heaven sent.  Toasting the bun is important, and loved the melted provolone.  This was soooo easy!  Will be looking for this recipe again.

Maybe I used the wrong kind of beer but it came out very bitter!! I tried everything to save the sauce but nothing worked... No one wanted the au jus. The meat was ok on bread with ketchup or A1 sauce. I did use a beer called Torpedo... thats all I had I didnt have the "normal" beers.  Coors or Budweiser. Maybe that was the problem, but it didnt specify what kind of beer to use...

Soo good even though I made a few changes. I added a splash or three of worcestshire sauce. And after putting butter on the bread I add garlic powder then provolone cheese, Bake it for five minutes then switch to broil until cheese is melty. Yummy!!!

I have been using allrecipes.com for a few years now. This is THE BEST recipe i have found on this site. It is absolutely amazing. I have tried various cuts of beef but serloin tip roast is the best. I wish I could give this more stars! yum!

Made mostly as directed.  Had a bottom round roast in the freezer... honestly, I never know the difference between roasts... other than a rib roast... the rest kind of run together for me!  The beef broth... I realized after the fact that my can of broth was slightly larger than the 10.5 oz called for.  Oops!  I used 12 oz of Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss only because all I could find were 24 oz single beers.... and wanted something drinkable since I was "forced" to polish off the other half!  This went into the crock around 8:30... and we ate around 5:30.  It took longer to cook than I thought it would... and about 1/2 way through, I turned it up to high for a couple of hours to help things along.  It also didn't slice as expected... but it didn't matter.  The rolls were the partially baked French buggers from Costco... sliced, buttered, baked.... dipped in bowls of aus jus on the side...and glommed down in record time. Perfect for low key meal while prepping for Turkey Day tomorrow!  I imagine you can add onions @ the beginning or mushrooms @ the end... whatever you want.  It was truly perfect as is!!

Love this recipe.  I have been making it for years with just a couple changes.  I use two cans Campbell’s Consommé and a package of Lipton Onion Soup (dry).  And I use a good, trimmed brisket, sliced againt the grain, of course.  The leftovers are the perfect beginning to a GREAT Beef soup!

BEST beef and au jus recipe I have found.  I use Michelob Amber Bock for the beer.  Try the "Beef on Weck" recipe for easy, but tasty preparation of kaiser rolls (but I brush the tops with melted butter instead of water and leave off the caraway seeds).  Together, they make a MOUTH WATERING sandwich.

This is a great sandwich! I made a variation to the sauce by adding 2 beef bouillon cubes and salt and pepper to taste after removing the meat. I also toasted the sandwich with provolone cheese on the meat side of the bun. This recipe is a new favorite for my family! Thanks for sharing!

I have made this many times, changing up the seasonings a bit here and there but overall this is a great meal to make before going to work and coming home to at night.  I like using a dark heavy beer for greater flavor.

Made these last night and they were knock your socks off good!! Added a few shakes of garlic powder, onion powder, worchshire and a big pinch of salt. I used Guiness for my beer and would definitely reccommend a dark, rich, malty beer (even though when drinking I prefer I light beer) I also melted some provelone cheese on the bread. So So So Delicious! Absolutely a keeper!!

WOW! As my kids would say, "This is so good my brains are coming out of my head!" I used a can of beef broth, 1 can of beef consume and a half a bottle of beer.  I did not have dark beer like another reviewer suggested, but used Icehouse and it came out just fine. I also lightly buttered the rolls and added a little sprinkle of chedder cheese and put them in the oven for a few minutes to melt before piling on the beef. I will absolutely be making this again!

This is a great base recipe. I always try to try recipe first as written with no changes..which I did..and although everyone liked it, it definitely needs a little additional help for our family. Most notable was the sauce..was pretty bland. Am looking forward to experimenting with some of the other recommendations I've read on here!

Very yummy after a few additions. I made the recipe just as it reads but it needed just a little help. I first rubbed Kitchen Bouquets Browning sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I browned the meat on all sides on the stove. I cooked like normal w/ Newcastle Brown Ale and added garlic salt, sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. It was delicious! My husband thinks I'm a genius but all credit should go to lonwolf32. Thanks for sharing the great recipes!

Tasted delicious with the addition of 12 oz dark beer. The chuck was impossible to carve so we simply shredded the beef adding it to the broiled/toasted rolls. We added swiss & provolone to the slightly buttered rolls after dusting them with garlic powder. The crustier the rolls the better.

Deliciously simple recipe but definitely needs seasonings added. I added 2 tbsp garlic power, 1 tsp of salt and pepper, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Could only find a can of onion soup which worked very well along with a full tall can of guinness beer. Will definitely make a keeper!!

VERY GOOD. VERY TENDER IF YOU CUT IT THEN PUT BACK IN SLOW COOKER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. I ALSO LET THIS COOK ON LOW OVERNIGHT.

Wow! Had a boys night.  These were a huge hit. I used top sirloin roast.  3 cans of the soup.  1 large box of beef broth and 2 large cans of Guiness.  Essentially tripling the liquid.  (7 quart slow cooker) Used a french stick.  Sauteed a tonne of onion.  Split the bread, added some chopped garlic, loads of onion and covered both sides in provolone.  Under the broiler.  Sliced the meat very thin and dunked it back in the broth.  Once the cheese was melted, piled the meat in the bread.  Reduced the broth by about a third. Best sandwhich I've ever had.  Ever!  Anywhere!  Best game day/fight night meal period!  Served it with some hand cut twice fried fries.  (Dipped it ketchup/mayo/diced onion goodness) Can't wait to make it again.

This was SO good and easy!  I let the meat get to room temperature, seasoned with salt and pepper then seared on high heat on each side.  Once in the slow cooker I added a handful of crushed garlic cloves and about half an onion.  After about 6 hours I took the meat out, sliced super thin and returned to slow cooker for an additional hour.  I broiled the bread and melted some gruyere (left over from when I made french onion soup) and mozzarella.  We LOVED it.  My boyfriend added a little horseradish sauce to his.  These turned out so so good.  And the leftovers were even better.  Will be making again.

It was pretty good. I added lots of onions. Meat was awesome. And once it was done I added more beef flavor gradnules and seasoning to the juice which I thought was a little bland for au jus.

Delicious..I did not have french onion soup, so I just doubled my beef broth and put in a packet of onion soup mix. I also added 3 or 4 chopped cloves of garlic and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. My kids and husband loved it! Oh and the beer makes for a wonderful taste and it is very subtle..not a strong beer taste.

SO GOOD!!  Giving it 4 stars though, because I made a lot of changes suggested in the other reviews.  2 cans of broth, onion soup mix, 1/4 of large onion, garlic salt, A1 sauce,  provolone cheese, and no beer.  My husband and I both had seconds. Definitely a keeper!

Easy and Delicious!  I took this to a carry-in dinner and everyone LOVED it! I used a can of beef consomme instead of broth and half a can of water instead of beer, a little Worcestershire sauce, and rubbed the 4 lb. chuck roast (good qualitly meat) with garlic powder and meat tenderizer before cooking it on low for about 10 hours.  I cooked it the night before then refrigerated it so the fat could be easily skimmed off the next day, then just reheated it before I needed it.  Great recipe, will definitely make again soon!

This was my first attempt at french dip and my family loved this one! I made a few modifications.  I used 2 cans of beef broth and a packet of dry onion soup mix because I forget to buy canned onion soup. I also added garlic, a tablespoon of worchestire sauce and a couple shakes of soy sauce.  The flavor was fantastic.  I used a 4 pound top round roast and it was not fatty and perfectly moist.  I served it on toasted, buttered rolls.  Will definitely make this one again.

This recipe was decent. Smelled wonderful while cooking all day. Didn't find rump roast so used a different cut of meat. Perhaps that was the difference. I'll have to try it next time with rump roast. But very simple!

Delicious.  I added a can of beef broth, a can of french onion soup, and a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale.  I also used 1 T worstershire, 1 t. dried thyme, 1/2 t. dried oregano, and garlic powder.  I used a 4 pound chuck roast. I toasted the french roll openfaced in the toaster oven, added the meat and some sliced provolone, and toasted again to melt the cheese.  Then dip, dip dip!

I found this recipe to be just ok, I thought it would taste more like french onion soup, so Iwas dissapointed.  I used Heiniken beer in the recipe, but for me I would substitute out the beer all together as I do not personally like the taste.  I also found my meat to be dry even with the dip sauce and since I do not like beer it was too overwhelming to dip n eat.

Great recipe. I did add a bit of salt and pepper to taste as well as garlic powder and some diced onion. I sliced my meat very thin and put it back in the juice to steep for about an hour. Served on the rolls with horseradish sauce made from sour cream, horseradish, and a cpl dashes of worcestershire sauce. Love this recipe.

Super easy and delicious. We make it 1-2x a month for an easy meal with tons of leftovers. The only modification I made was adding a packet of au jus and some worchestershire sauce because it was way too bland the first time around. AND USE GUINESS. It makes a difference [especially if you don't use any beer at all].

Very, very good.  Made for the first time today.  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time I will use Guiness beer (instead of a lighter beer) and also rub salt and garlic powder onto the meat before cooking as others have suggested.  Excellent and very yummy!!!!! UPDATE 9/20/11 - I'm leaving this is a 4 star recipe.  I've made it many times.  The meat always seems a bit dry.  I'll cut down on the time I cook it in the crock pot.  I melt provolone cheese on top and saute green peppers and onions to go on top for those want them.

Made as directed but placed the roast on a bed of sliced sweet onions in the crockpot.  Heated a  French baguette then cut into serving sizes, split and added sliced beef, onions and provolone cheese.  Broil until the cheese melts and then smash together and dunked into the au jus.  Just as good leftover.  Next time I will try adding some garlic salt.

I used many of the suggestions by other reviewers.  I used a chuck roast, then seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  I seared over hot heat in a skillet with a little canola oil until browned.  Cut slits in the meat and put fresh garlic in the slits.  Put in crockpot with beer (Guiness stout ale-  I didn't notice a beer flavor, just added richness) soup and broth.  Cooked until fork tender.  Shredded and put back in the cooker for about 1/2 an hour before serving.  Put a small amount of butter on sliced french rolls and put under the broiler until toasted - then added a slice of provolone and melted slightly.  Served with the au jus which I strained.  Delicious!

Very Good.  The one thing I agree about from other peoples reviews is slicing the meat and returning it to the crockpot on warm in the juices for about 30-45 minutes. Also, the garlic powder, some salt and pepper really added more flavor. Will keep making this!

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time it turned out okay. I recently made it again, and it turned out fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice of one of the reviewers about taking the meat out of the slow cooker, allowing it to cool, slicing it, and throw it back in. I did that right before whipping up my mashed potatoes which gave the meat enough time to soak up those juices. I used French sub rolls. Be sure to toast your rolls so that your sandwich isn't too soggy... the crispiness of the french rolls was wonderful paired with the meat and au jus dip. I also used mozzerella cheese in place of provolone. This recipe is much easier than it should be for the excellent results you get. Thanks!

Quite yummy, very rich.  Half a sandwich was all I could eat.  Flexible recipe, I didn't have cans of broth or Fr onion soup, so I used beef soup base and onion soup mix instead.  Came out great.

We love, love, love this dish! We cook it just as written and it turns out perfect every time. For even slices I use a meat slicer.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written.  It was so easy and  my family loved it.  I added  cheese to the sandwiches of my family members that like cheese on thier french dip.  We all thought the meat was terrific.  Even my three year old ate it.  I used Guinness beer.

This was very easy to put together. Since I am a night owl I put mine in and let it slow cook all night and it turned out great. I do recomment using a lot of crushed garlic cloves, like 20 to add flavor and also to season your meat of your choice, the Worechestshire sauce is a must like a 1/2 of cup or half the bottle, again for the extra kick of flavor. I also added provlone cheese to my bread and I carmalized onions to go on the top. This was a BIG success. Left overs if you have any are even better the next day as the flavor sets in the meat that much more. There is no need to cut meat as it falls apart from slow cooking. I used Angus pot roast meat so there was no need to trim as it is done for you. Thnak you for sharing. I have never cooked these this way and from now on this is how I will.

I must say these smelled much better than than actually tasted. The smell was heavenly, but they were very bland. I used Guiness beer per other reviewers' suggestions and ended up adding other seasonings to kick them up. Not bad but disappointing based on the overall rating. I served them to a group of about 30- have lots of leftovers and nobody requested the recipe or really even commented on them at all - thus the 3-star rating.

This is one great recipe. I only added 2 teaspoons crushed garlic and 1 teaspoons w'shire sauce. I know Dawn said to trip excess fat from the roast but I left it to moisten the meat. Anyone who says the dip is to fatty, that's why. I just skimmed it. I used Shipwitch Irish beer and, yes you could not taste beer but it gave the sauce added depth.Despite the fact that I hate condensed soup in crockpot recipes, you could not tell the French Onion Soup was canned.Also, anyone who says the meat is dry....dip eat,dip eat,dip eat. That's the name of the sandwich.Even 350 degrees for the oven was spot on.I warmed the bread for 5 minutes then put slices of swiss cheese on the roll for the final 5. My oh my but this is wonderful.  Thank you Dawn.

Very easy and very delicious!  I made these for a new years party.  I bought dinner roles and made mini french dips.  We were not able to cut the meat into slices because it was so tender it just fell apart.  It was more like a pulled french dip, but still just as delicious.  I also added the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Worcestershire.  I also used Guinness for the beer.  YUMMY!!

This was actually very good and my family loved it except for one tiny thing. We really didnt care for the juice as the au ju. so i would suggest making your own for that. We had lots of leftover and we made sandwiches out of that. Those were really good! overall.. quick and easy and not too bad!

This was EXTREMELY easy and very tasty. It was even better on day two, after I let the sliced meat soak in the broth and juices overnight. To reheat, I just placed Crockpot dish back into its holder and turned it on low for a couple of hours. My husband ate the rest of the meet on day three like a stew with buttered bread. We will definitely have this again.

"Easy and tasty," so says my husband. We followed the recipe, except we had a little garlic and Worcestershire. We also only used a 2lb. roast, since it's just us and our two year old son. I'll looking forward to the leftovers once the meat has soaked some more in the juices.

Made this last night but I didn't eat it (I'm a vegetarian) but was told this was superb.  Of course, you customize to taste. So based on suggestions, I used a top round roast sprinkled with steak seasoning, garlic powder, pepper, worcestershire sauce and kitchen bouquet.  For the liquid, I used beef consomme, french onion soup and Guinness Extra Stout.  Put it in the slow cooker with a couple of shallots on low for 9 hrs, let it rest for an 1 hr, then sliced it up and put it back in the liquid.  I put it on a buttered parmesean peppercorn baguette (Holy Smokes, Batman!!) with provolone and placed in the oven just until the cheese melted.  The BF couldn't even talk while he was eating it... he gobbled it down so fast!! Nice!!!

This was so good and so easy!  I did use a little Worchestershire sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder on the meat (2 1/2 lb chuck roast).  Other than that, no changes to the recipe.  I cooked all day on low for 10 hours while I was at work.  The meat was so tender that it wouldn't really slice, but that was fine with us.  I did as others suggested and sliced/shredded the meat and then let it sit in the liquid for about an hour before serving.  Spread some butter on rolls, topped with Provolone, and put under the broiler for a few minutes.  YUMMY!

This makes good sandwiches.  I used a chuck roast and it turned out so tender it fell apart, not really good for slicing. It was fine with us, though. I like to eat the meat just by itself, yum.

It was good, but as with many slow cooker meals, the flavor was watered down...to me anyway. The leftovers made  a decent pot roast dinner the next night, though. The sauce was tasty, but I would prefer it separate and the roast done in an oven. Again, personal preferences.

I would give this ten stars if I could. To this recipe, I added...NOTHING! Had this at my daughter's this weekend and thought I died and went to heaven.  We made sandwiches with the beef on buttered soft rolls and used the juices for dipping. The beef was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The juice was out of this world.  Next time, I'm taking the juices, adding a hunk of bread at the bottom, throwing some mozeralla cheese over it, broil it and making a French Onion Soup of this to die for!  Excellent recipe either way!

Spectacular!  The type of beer you use, really does make a difference...I didn't have the french onion soup, so I just used a packet of dry onion soup mix and added water.  Also, I added some garlic and parmesan to the rolls before baking.

Update-Used dry onion soup mix again, added water without measuring.  Spooned in some beef bouillon base, added more water, then a half of a large bottle of guinness stout beer, garlic powder, onion powder and worcestershire sauce.  Melted cheddar and dubliner cheese with garlic on top in the oven...wow!

This was wonderful! I highly recommend dipping the butter/toasted sides of the french rolls in the juice prior to putting the meat in.  This really softens up the inside, but keeps the crispy crust of the roll.  Spicy horseradish, swiss cheese and grilled onions are perfect toppings!

This gets points for ease of preperation but was a little on the bland side.  The au jus needed something.  I had to punch it up with a lot of spices to make it flavorful.  I'd try it again because the idea was great, but it definitely needs some tweeking.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Thought this was very bland and had an off beer taste.  The meat, rather than being sliced like a French Dip, fell apart like a pot roast, so I had to just pile it on the bread.  I did manage to rescue the au jus somewhat by adding some salt and pepper and some tomato paste.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I used to be a crockpot snob. Not anymore. I thought that something out of a crockpot couldn't be that good. Boy was a wrong. I made some modifications to the recipe after i read the comments. I don't know how authentically you can rate a recipe when you change the details but anyway here goes. This is how i changed the recipe: 1) Used beef consume rather than beef broth 2) put a package of onion soup mix to the pot. 3) Cut up 1/2 sweet onion and added to the pot.  I cooked this on a sunday night and let it cool in the fridge overnight (meat soaking in the juices). I then sliced the meat very thin the next day (still cold) with my meat slicer. I then put the meat back into the meat juices and put it back in the fridge. Tuesday i just slightly warmed it. Boy was i suprised. The au jus was the star of the show. It was very good. It was a tad salty but that might have been the onion soup mix. I defintely adding this to my recipe book

The husband, the picky 6 year old, the 5,2 and 1 year old LOVED this dinner.  So nice to have a meal with no complaints.  The 5 year old ate 2 sandwiches!  I used the french bread rolls to die for from this site.  Also used steaks instead of roast (all I had), 1 packet of beefy onion soup mix, 2 cups of beef broth, Budweiser beer (do not use a cheap beer), 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp salt, pepper, dash of Worcestershire and some onion.  It was so good.  I had to add a little more seasoning right before serving. Sliced it super thin with a commercial slicer.  The next night I shredded  it and thickened the sauce and served over noodles, it was good, but better as a sandwich.

Terrific. I used a 4 1/2 # bottom round. I seasoned it with cracked pepper, a little salt, and alot of garlic powder, I put the roast on a rack in the slow cooker. I forgot to put in the beer, but, with the two cans of soup, there was plenty of broth. I left the fat on top and cut it off before I sliced the roast. One hour per pound on low left if a little pink in the center, which was just what I wanted. The trick to this is letting it cool before slicing it across the grain with a very sharp knife. I made this to use later, so, I put the broth through a strainer and put it in the fridge. Skim off some of the broth before reheating. This was a good recipe. I'll be making it again. Thanks

However, I did modify the recipe based on others recommendations by adding 1 Tbsp of minced garlic, 1 Tbsp of beef Bovril, 1 Tbsp of Montreal steak spice, 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp of soya sauce.  Also, I buttered the rolls with Mom's Pantry garlic spread and a strip of Swiss cheese before baking at 350 for 10 minutes.

I used top quality sirloin steak in this recipe, so the meat was good, but I didn't think the au jus that it created was very good. If I were to make it again, I'd probably use something other than the condensed soup (not sure what though).

My family loved the sandwiches! I did need to add a little garlic salt to the liquid because it was just a little too bland. I also put a slice of Swiss cheese on top of the meat and put it under the broiler to melt. I will be making these again with just a few alterations.  Thank you for such an easy and yummy recipe!

Yummy! My whole house smelled so good while this was cooking. Tasted awesome :) UPDATE: Made this again and didn't have the french onion soup...so I used a pack of onion soup mix and left everything else the same. Still amazing!

This is an excellent recipe. It went over extremely well with our last dinner crowd. The only thing I did different was add a bit of worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, beef boullion paste, minced garlic, and garlic powder. I just added a little at a time to my desired taste. I rubbed the roast with onion and garlic salt before putting in the crock pot. In addition, I doubled the juice part of the recipe and added only one bottle of dark beer. We used hoogie rolls instead of french bread and broiled the rolls split with provalone cheese on both sides. EXCELLENT!!

This was a great recipe! I modified the recipe because I wasn't sure about the beer. Surprisingly the final product turned out so wonderfully flavorful. I used a Sirloin Tip roast (that was all I could find at the grocery store). This cut of meat was on point, I will definitely use this next time. Like I said, I cut out the beer - instead I used 32oz of beef broth, 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 packet of dried onion soup mix. I think I added a tad bit of minced garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper as well. I let it cook in the crock pot on low for 9 hours. My fiance went to pull the meat apart an hour before serving as some have suggested and when he tried the roast just fell apart on its own. This went great with toasted french bread and melted white american cheese. I can't wait to make this again!

I loved it but my boyfriend didn't like the beer taste. I would give it five stars but since he usually eats everything I eat.... 9/15/10 Tried this again but this time I used about 3/4 cup red wine instead of beer and added a tbl of Worcestershire, onion salt, rosemary and oregano. Yum! Served on Franz brand ballpark style buns. 8/18/11 This time I used just two cans of soup called for and a splash of red wine vinegar. Hubby called me at work to ask for more bread to finish it off.

I agree with the others who used Beef consomme, but beef broth is ok too.  Also a little garlic is always good. Very easy and tasty.

I have made a lot of french dip sandwiches before, and this is the best recipe I have made. My family loved them!! I did do a couple of things differently. First I cut pockets into the chuck roast and packed them with garlic and dried basil. I then seasoned the roast with black pepper and seasoning salt. I also cut up little red potatoes and added them to the crock pot and put the roast on top of them...Great meal!!!!

I thought this recipe was simple and delicious. I didn't have the beer and it still came out great. I did take others advice and thinly sliced the meat 30 minutes before serving and added it back to the juices. I think that is a must. I also added around tsp. of au jus seasoning that I happened to have on hand. A few days later I thickened the leftovers up with some sour cream and a little bit of flour and served over egg noodles. Great and simple recipe!

Don't get me wrong, this was easy and tasted pretty good--but--it reminded me too much of pot roast on rolls. My husband really loved it though, so 4-stars overall. Like another reviewer mentioned, I melted Provolone on the rolls. Definitely experiment with seasonings on this one, without a lot of seasoning this would be very bland!

Very good. I used a 2.5 pound roast so I thought it wouldn't have to cook as long. Even though the meat was "cooked" before the amount of time was done it was too tough. I left it in for the advised amount of time and it got soft and just melted in your mouth. It was excellent.

This was great. The first time I made it I used a lighter beer and last night I used Fat Tire which was excellent! Instead of using a can of french onion soup I used a packet and added two cups of beef broth. I turned out great.

I am torn between 4 and 5 stars. My kids and dh loved it and voted for the 5 but I thought the beer smell was a little too much. Being pregnant, I am sensitive to smells though so I will give it a 5. I can say that it tasted great which is the main thing. We even ate it for leftovers and it was even better. I did follow everyones suggestion and used beef consume and packet of onion soup mix. I also added two cloves of garlic to the pot. I used chuck roast because its price was so much cheaper.

This was really good the only thing I do not understand is WHY my new crock pot is not making my meat tender? I bought a bigger crock pot and for some reason the 2 times I have used it, my meat is VERY tough. Maybe it is the meat I am using. First time I used pork butt and the 2nd time I used rump roast... I have NEVER used these 2 types of meat and both times I have used my new crock pot. If anyone has suggestions please help! The flavor of this was excellent, I just wish my meat was tender.

I've made this twice now and I'm already looking for an excuse to do it again. Just one caveat: go with an onion soup mix you've tried and liked. I cheaped out on an untested store brand the second time, and it definitely gave the meat a processed, freeze-dried onion taste. I also agree with other reviewers that a good, heavy stout or lager is much better than a lighter beer.

If I made this once a week my family would be happy. I use beef consomme instead of the broth and a good dark beer is a must and as many have suggested take the meat out and slice it and return it to the crock pot for an hour.  And definately add cheese to the bread before you bake it. Yummy!

I used a london broil, and took it out after a few hours and sliced it real thin. Put it back in, then added sliced onions, a little rosemary and red wine instead of beer (as suggested by someone else's review). And I added a pound of fresh mushrooms and lots of fresh garlic. I made homemade french bread. It was divine. Thanks so much for the recipe. Ann

I like to try the recipe exactly, at first, so I can fairly rate IMO. Although very good... didn't taste much different than the canned onion soup(which is very good) AND IMO it "cries out" for provolone cheese melted on it. Hubby loved it (with added provolone cheese). Will try again, and as others have suggested, add some fresh garlic, and try with  a "dark" beer, to give the broth a fresher/deeper flavor.

If I could give this more stars I would.  This was easy and very tasty. I put this in the croak pot in the morning and by the late afternoon the house was smelling really good.  My husband could hardly wait for me to toast the rolls for this.  This is a keep and we will make this again.  Thanks for such a good recipe.

Okay I made this again yesterday.  MY DH was updating our koi pond and my brother and brother-in-law came to help.  Instead of using the roast I used sliced roast beef from the deli.  I put everything in a stock pot and added some onions.  The guys loved them.  thanks for such a quick and easy recipe.

This recipe is a great start, I added about a tablespoon of garlic and onion powder and used a good dark beer. I think next time I make it I will add 2 cans of consume and fresh onions.

This is fantastic!  I butter the inside of my hoagie roll and put it under the broiler to make it toasty and then melt some provolone on top of the meat.  Yum!

We loved this.  And it could not be any easier!  I let mine sit in the crock pot on low for 8 hours and I shredded the meat and let it soak back in the juices for a while.  I took another's suggestion to use chuck roast and it came out great!  I used american cheese since I was out of sliced mozzarella.  My husband had his without cheese and thought it was delicious.  Even my picky 3 year old who has a hard time trying new foods swiped mine off my plate!  You definately have to toast your rolls!

This is a very quick and easy recipe, however, it does not have as much flavor as other french dip recipes that I have tried.

This was absolutely delicious. Even my picky eater husband and 2 yo ate it and wanted seconds. I Marinated the 2.25lb tri tip roast with salt and pepper over night then seared it before cooking. Added the ingredients to the slow cooker and then the slow cooked it in my All-Clad slow cooker on low for 4.5 hours. Then took the meat out and reduced the sauce for a more concentrated flavor. Served it with sauteed onions and mushroom and Jack cheese on ciabatta bread. It was absolutely wonderful. I still have leftover meat for a beef stroganoff dish tomorrow. Thank you Robyn!

It just doesn't get any easier or yummier than this!  What a awesome recipe.  I put it on at lunch yesterday and when I got home from work I could smell that heavenly aroma as I got out of the car. I added a dash of Worcestershire along with what the recipe called for except I used dry onion soup mix and a can of water.  I did let the meat set for 20 minutes on the cutting board before slicing (It was very tender) and while the meat was resting I took the Au Jus and put it on the stove top and cooked at a hard boil for about 15 minutes to condense the flavors. This recipe is going to be used over and over in our house. It's simply fantastic.

This was a decent base but I found I was really scrambling to doctor this one up to give it more taste.  I pretty much followed this recipe exactly as stated and felt it was rather bland.  I hurried and added a packet of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix and lots of crushed red peppers to "liven" it up but still was not impressed.  I'll stick to another recipe on this site "slow cooker italian beef for sandwiches" which uses the same type of meat but with MUCH more flavor.  Not a bad meal...just not really packed with the flavor I thought it would.

OH this is YUMMY! The first time I made it, I used a BOTTOM ROUND ROAST because I didn't know there was a difference from a RUMP ROAST. It was incredibly tender and tasty. My 5 yr old said "Oh this is so good" after every bite! The 2nd time I made it, I used a can of COKE because I didn't have a beer, and I used an actual RUMP roast... turned out AWESOME, too, but I liked the meat of the BOTTOM ROUND ROAST much much better! The COKE was a great idea!!

I CANNOT Believe this meal!  It is FANTASTIC!  I went with the others' suggestions of using a 4 lb tender chuck roast, Campbells Consomme, Campbells French Onion Soup, added garlic powder and a tad Worstershire sauce and used a whole Juengling Light beer (the only one we had on hand) and I actually cooked it on high for a couple hours and then turned it down to low for the remaining few and it was awesome!  I used french rolls from the deli and provolone cheese on top under the broiler and then topped it with the beef with a side cup of the gravy from the slow cooker.  My husband and I were sooo impressed!  We had them again today and they were even better as left-overs!  I'd give this recipe ten stars if possible!!!

This was very good. However, nothing like the traditional French dip sandwich you get in a restaurant. It was more like a pot roast sandwich. It had a lot of flavor, and the meat was tender; it was very good. But, I found the "dip" part to be too watery/soupy and it lacked "punch" or "depth" for a true dipping sauce. I took the advice of reviewers and added a can of consomme, used only half a can of beer, used a chuck roast, worchestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper -- even used about two tablespoons of beef granules but it was still lacking something for the dipping sauce. I've never heard of the browning sauce someone mentioned in a review; maybe that's the key? Anyway, I will certainly make this again. Also, I used HALF the meat suggested and it was enough for a couple meals for my husband and I. It would certainly feed a family of four easily. We ended up putting it over mashed potatoes later in the week.

Following advice of others, and adding my own spin - this was wonderful, easy, and I plan to make again very soon.

Used recommended rump roast. Was 3 lbs after the fat was trimmed off.  Thus, reduced cooking time by 1 hour.  Rubbed roast with garlic powder, pepper, salt, and oregano before putting in the slow cooker.

For the broth, I used 1 bottle of Guinness beer, 1 box of low sodium beef broth (used a large box so the roast was completely covered), 1 can French onion soup, 1 package of dry French onion soup mix (don't add water), 3 cloves of crushed garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  The beer really does give it some depth.  

Sliced the roast after 5 hours, and returned to the broth for another hour of cooking.

For our sandwiches, we used sub rolls.  Topped with beef, sliced brie, and some delicious apple/horseradish jelly (was made by a friend).  Wrapped them up in foil, and baked on 350 for 20 minutes.  Fantastic!

Super easy and tasty too. My husband enjoyed it very much.  A great new way fix a pot roast! My kids had a great time eating it too.  Add a lot of swiss and  grilled onions and you have perfection. The sauce is wonderful and I even used the leftover au jus as a base for a bowl of french onion soup!

I did add large sweet onion.  Then piled them over the beef and topped with provolone-- A few minutes under the broiler and BAM!  Sooooo good!  I really wanted to try the darker beer, but all I had was Miller Lite... Worked great-- No beer taste as others have said.  Husband loved it!  Will definately make again.

I cannot believe how easy – and my mother loved it – even though she turned up her nose when I told her how I made it (the beer freaked her out) but she loved it (and had no complaints about beer flavor) when I served it for lunch and then gave her the leftovers.

I followed the recipe with a few minor but tasty exceptions – first off I used a crock pot liner (just don’t cook without them anymore – hate clean up) I used the broth, Campbell French onion soup, and one 12 ounce of Milwaukee’s Best Light beer 9so no you don’t have to use anything fancy), 2 cloves med to fine chopped garlic, 2 small cans of drained mushrooms {would have added fresh if I had had them} I was thinking of the left over broth and nothing doesn’t taste better without mushrooms), and 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary.  

I cooked for the full 7 hours (don’t know why so many complained about toughness when they did not cook for the full time stated) and then sliced and left in broth over night (it was just due to when I started).  I did some as sandwiches, some over mashed potatoes (this is where I dug down for the mushrooms) – this is such any easy and awesome recipe – will add it to my favorites – love it because so many of my family are “meat and potato” men.  Thank you Robyn

Delicious french dip!  I used a can of beef broth instead of the beer.  I toasted the buns, then put on meat and provolone cheese and then a minute under the broiler and they turned out great!  The au jus was perfect!

Made this today for dinner and it was very good. Especially for the quickest prep possible.  I did as instructed and added garlic powder and onion powder.  YOU HAVE TO TOAST the buns.. that is a key part to taking this from and ok to and great sandwich.  I also put them back in the oven after putting the meat and cheese in the bread.   I will say that it needed a little something, so next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will tweak to add more depth to the flavor.  Maybe I will use a darker beer next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

My roast was a little smaller but still was tender. I could not find condensed French onion soup so I purchased a ready to eat (no water to add) brand and added 1/2 a package of au jus packaged mix. I did sprinkle the roast with garlic powder. This was very enjoyable. The dip delicious! Update: After everyone had their fill of this delicious meal I poured the leftover au jus sauce into ice cube trays and froze them. Every time I make a regular oven roast I use 2 or 3 cubes in my gravy. I'm sure this would work well in stews and soups too!

Absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge beer fan, but the beer flavor was so subtle and just added great body to this sandwich. Next time, I'll slice the meat half way through because it wasn't as tender as I thought it would be. Also, I added 2 cloves of garlic (halved), a few whole peppercorns, and more beef broth b/c we like more au jus. Great meal to come home to, thank you, thank you!

This was yummy. Followed recipe except I browned my roast first. I used an eye of round roast. Juice wasn't real strong, husband decided you could always sprinkle in a package of au jus mix the last hour or so.  We will make this again.

Turned out just as i wanted it to.  After the meat cooked as instructed, I removed the roast from crock pot and shredded on a shopping block. Returned meat to crock pot for about 30 minutes.  Next I put all the meat in a pasta strainer so the toasted bread would not turn soggy until I dipped it in the gravy bit by bit.  Plan to make this on a regular basis.  Great on a rainy cold winters day!!  Loved It!!!

Used rump roast. Ran out of time so I put it on high. Don't. Turned out dry.  Dip wasn't as flavorfull as I wanted.  Used 1 packet of french onion soup mix with 2 beef boullion cubes as I had all ingredients but the condensed soup.  My husband and my extremely picky eater step son couldn't get enough of this though.

This was the best! My very picky European HB loved it! The meat is very moist, and the aux jus is yummmy! I added a package of dry onion soup mix to give it a little extra taste, will be making this often!

While it was good, it was not what I was looking for.  It was simply a roast beef sandwich with onion soup to dip it in.  I was looking for more of a restaurant style french dip.

Does anyone know how to substitute the French Onion soup in this recipe?  I LOVE these sandwiches, but need it to be non-dairy for my family due to food allergies.

Thanks!

Is there anyone who does not like this?  I have been serving this for a few years now.  It is my husband FAVORITE meal.  Everyone that I share it with loves it also.  I have found that the french onion soup mix from Knorr's is a great subsitute for the condensed soup.  No water needed, just add it with the beer and beef broth.  I think that it actually makes it a bit richer. I would give this 10 stars it I could.

HUSBAND likes to turn the bread into garlic bread,  adds pepper jack cheese and a bit of ranch to his

I made this recipe while recovering from Lazer eye surgery so I would have something around the house to eat.  This is an easy and terrific recipe.  I added quite a bit of garlic salt to the recipe because I am a salt and garlic junkie!

We love this recipe.  I have made this a few times and everytime it tastes as good as the first.  I took someones advice the first time I made this and I think it enhances the flavor. I take Montreal Steak Seasoning and I coat both sides of the meat then sear it in a skillet for just a couple of minutes and then put it in the crockpot.

Delicious!  What else can I say.  The only thing different that I did was to use dry onion soup mix as I had no canned french onion soup.  I added a cup of water as well to make up for the canned f.onion soup.  Otherwise, did everything as written and will definitely make this again.

My husband thought this was the best sandwich he'd ever eaten.  I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring (I could taste the beer and I'm not a beer lover).  He wants me to make them again and I think I'll maybe try apple juice instead of the beer.

This recipe turned out great! I followed the suggestions of others and seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and worchestershire. I also added some dehydrated onion and Montreal Steak seasoning which I think added a lot of  flavor. I trimmed all of the fat off the meat (I used a chuck steak) that I could and it was not greasy at all. My family really liked it.
I recommend toasting the rolls with butter and garlic powder for 5 min @ 350, then putting the sliced meat and cheese on them and melt under the broiler.
This one is a keeper!!

LOVE this recipe. It's simple, and it's awesome as is. A little Swiss cheese melted on a toasty French Dip sandwich takes it over the top. My mother-in-law served this for company... I wouldn't dare because hubby and I dip till the sandwiches are  deliciously soggy and drip down our arms... don't want any witnesses!

Pretty good.  I will try it again with a different cut of meat. I used a London Broil that I had and I think it was a bit lean. I will try a darker beer.  Turned the left overs into a great soup by reheating with added beef broth, crushed italian seasoned tomatoes and added some frozen veggies (green beans peppers and onions and carrots) the last 10 minutes.

This is wonderful! Everyone that has tasted this loves it!  I am going to have to try the other suggestions (ie garlic & onion powder).  I like to shread the meat and it it on hard rolls with provolne cheese wrap in tin foil and bake in the oven till the bread is crusty and the cheese is melted (apx 8-10 min), then we love to dip in the sauce.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  As a working father of three who is the cook in the family I am always looking for recipes that are quick, easy and delicious.  This one hits the mark on all three.  The kids love it as does my partner and I can have it all ready once I hit the door within 20 minutes.  The kids love the dipping sauce.

I've been making this recipe for a long time.  I'm delighted to see it turn up here at holiday time.  This is a perfect New Year's Eve dinner.  We, too, thought the au jus was a bit bland and thin.  Solved this by pouring it into a saucepan and cooking it down about half.  Pour it back over the meat and it's ready to go.

Great recipe.  I did think it needed something extra.  The second time I made it I used both canned French Onion Soup and the dry Onion Soup Mix by Lipton.  Had more flavor. Great recipe though, thank you for sharing.  Our choir gobbled it up (without the bread!) Thanks again

Fabulous recipe! A household favourite. I can't find condensed french onion soup, so I mix half a package of onion soup mix with half a cup of water. I also season the roast in the crock pot with salt, pepper and garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients. Turns out awesome every time!

Best and easiest recipe for a great meal. I like to add some mushrooms towards the end of cooking time. Then I scoop some of the liquid with mushrooms out and reduce in a sauce pan for a thick sauce as an additional option along with the original au jus.  YUM!

This was delicious! I used I extra can of beef broth instead of beer but I think I will add another can of the french onion soup so I can have more sauce for dipping. I also added 1 packet of the Au Jus seasoning so I may add another one for the extra can of beef broth that I am adding. I used provolone cheese and satueed onions. My family voted this meal as one of our favorites.

I'm a tough critic, but I have to say this is the best of the recipes I've tried from this site. The beef was so tender I had a little trouble slicing it, so I shredded it. That worked out just as well or better. The only other change I made was to add a bit of worcestershire sauce. Trust me no other changes are necessary.

Really, really good. Really, really easy. Tender. Salty & just a little Beer-bitter (which is a good thing). The au jus from this recipe was so simple & tasty. 

I didn't omit or add one ingredient. I didn't fiddle with the cook time.

It was excellent and I will make it again.

This was FABULOUS!  It made our Superbowl XL party complete.  I followed the directions with the exception of adding a packet of McCormick's Au Jus, as someone else suggested.  Added a bit more beef broth and used Miller Lite.  I toasted the rolls and had provolone cheese as an add on.  My guests all said this was "MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD"!  Thank you Robyn!

Made this for dinner this evening and it was a major hit with the hubby and kids. The only thing wrong with this recipe is that there isn't enough of that awesome broth! I would highly recomend doubling the liquids to make more. I shredded my roast and then placed it back into the broth to warm for awhile. Then scooped some into individual bowls for dipping. You couldn't keep me from making this again!

Great!  Easy and delicious.  I used onion soup mix (with a bit of water),  low-sodium broth, and pilsner beer.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It truly tastes as good as any good pub's French Dip.  I followed someone's suggestion to add a packet of McCormick's "Au Jus" sauce.  Next time, I think I'll add a slice of melted cheese like my favorite restaurant.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This is a keeper!!

I love this recipe.  My suggestion on the beer - use Shiner Bock.  This is a dark beer and gives a MUCH better taste then a regular domestic beer. 

For those not familiar, Shiner is a beer from Texas.

INCREDIBLE AND INCREDIBLY EASY!  Cooked it on high for 4 hours; added the pepper, dried parsley, bay leaf and dried oregano (about 1/2 teaspoon each as previously recommended) plus about 2 cloves minced garlic (about 1 teaspoon).  Topped bread slices with swiss cheese.  My picky kids loved it and even ate the leftovers!!  That is a huge testimony in itself!

My family LOVED it! The only change I made was the addition of 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I served it on toasted mini french rolls and topped with melted monterey jack cheese. I also slightly strained the dipping juice for appearance sake. 

Also, I do not like beer at all, but I don't think this recipe would be as good without it. This is definitely in my meal rotation!

OH my gosh this was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except added a bay leaf, small amount of S&P, and a dash of garlic powder and onion powder as others suggested (probably no more than 1/2 tsp. each). The meat was so tender it fell apart but was still able to be sliced, and the only thing that was added to the sandwich was a slice of provolone. Toasting the hoagie rolls is a must. Both my kids (6 & 2 years) ate it up and husband ate thirds. We will eat this all week! Thanks for the easy recipe - had to work all day today and still had a wonderful home-cooked meal. Also, my cooker could only be set on 6 or 8 hours so I did 8 hours. Thanks for sharing!!!!

This is probably our second favorite recipe for French Dip sandwiches.  Our other recipe adds garlic cloves and uses Vidalia onions, instead of the onion soup.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Excellent!!  I did make a few changes though.  I took the advice of other reviewers and spiced up the broth--I used salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, parsley, oregano, and a bay leaf.  I also used only half the beer (a light lager) and upped the amount of beef broth to make up for it.  Absolutely incredible!!  Great flavor to the meat and the dipping sauce was wonderful!!  This will be added to my menu on a regular basis!!!

My family LOVED this.  This is by far the easiest and best tasting french dip ever.  I also added quite a bit of Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt.  I think my husband also added a few dashes of Tabasco behind my back!  Very, very good.

Thought I'd write this review while hubby cleans up dishes!  This was a very good and very filling meal.  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sautee'd onions to go on top.  Also, I melted shredded mozzarella onto the French bread during the last two minutes in the oven (I would have used provolone, but didn't have any)!  The family loved it and hubby said it was "a keeper."  He mentioned thay he'd like me to saute' some green peppers with the onions next time!  Will make again!

I am a french dip fanatic!It's been 2 yrs since I tried to slow cook for french dip (last time I did, the results were horrible). However, this one came out WONDERFUL! 
Here's my recipe with tweaks: 2 - 2.5lb chuck roasts (marinated while frozen overnight in pepsi, I defrosted it in the morning upon learning it was still frozen), scored the roast & inserted slivers of garlic, approx 1cup pepsi (thought I had beer - but didn't, luckily a user tip said use pepsi), 1 can beef consomme, 1 can french onion soup, 1/2 pkg onion soup mix, 1 tsp garlic powder, and a dash of salt & pepper - mixed these ingredients so it was evenly distributed. Turned the slow cooker to High for 4.5hrs (since my roasts were still relatively frozen),then added fresh mushrooms & turned the cooker to Low for another 3 hours. The meat was SO tender! Then cut it up into thin slices & put it back into the juices to cook for about 15 more mins. Made the sandwiches w/provolone as others suggested. It was sooo good my bf ate 2 dips & I was happily STUFFED at just 1/2 of mine. The au jus is sooo good I just want to eat THAT with some meat as a soup! This recipe makes A LOT. Next time I will try the beer - just to see how it's different from the pepsi. I did add more salt & pepper to mine because I like my au jus salty, but my bf thought it was perfect the way it was. I may not put the garlic INTO the meat next time, it kinda shocked me when i bit into a clove. GREAT -I will make it again!

Great recipe. I chose to use two cans of beef consomme' instead of broth, thinly sliced a huge onion and placed over the beef, poured a packet of dry onion soup mix and sprinkled garlic powder all over. I didn't have room for the beer. I buttered and toasted the rolls and then melted swiss cheese on them. This made a delicious au jus and there was plenty of it even without the beer. I can't wait to try this again with the beer, I can't imagine improving upon our finished product though!

Awesome!  I did a coke instead of a beer with a little hesitation, but it was great!  Next time I will do the beef consume for a little stronger flavor.

This is awesome!  I've made it many times for my fiance and a few times for my parents and friends and it's a huge hit.  We add more spices (garlic salt, packet of onion soup mix, and more beef bouillon for flavoring) and the leftovers are even better then the first time!

This was fantastic! I put it on before I went to work and came home and supper was done! I did it exactly how it was written, and my husband said, this would be good with slices of onion and mushrooms. I said I thought about it, but then it wouldn't be a "true" french dip. He stated- who cares. So next time- And there will be a next time- I will had slices of onion and mushrooms.

How many ways can you say "YUM"?  This was fantastic and smelled delish when we came home to it.  The au jus was very tasty and I would also recommend a dark beer (gives it a great flavor).  We were all looking for scraps of crusty french bread to dip in the sauce.

This recipe is fabulous!  We don't drink alcohol so I just added 2 cans beef broth and one can consomme.  It was perfect.  Just make sure you slice the beef a little while before you serve and let it sit in the broth.  This makes it so moist and yummy.  We served ours on baguettes and with a side salad.  Great dinner!

These were amazing. My family just loved them. I was told I can make these anytime I wanted. That doesn't happen very often. My 16 yr old couldn't get enough. I used about 8 oz. of beer. I also used onion soup mix and 2 cans of beef broth like some had suggested. I added about 2 1/2 tbsp of worstershire sauce and 2 tsps of garlic powder. Everything else I left the same. Just a wonderful quick and easy recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I hate to be the party pooper here but no one in my family liked this and I'm pretty sure it was because of the beer! Maybe I used the wrong kind but the broth had a very metallic taste to it, almost bitter. And the roast wasn't all that tender - I think it might have been better if I'd browned it first. I'm giving it 2 stars only because I was able to use the broth in a soup after I doctored it up with worcestershire and hot sauce! Sorry : (

Very good recipe!  I added fresh mushrooms into the crock pot.  Also melted provolone cheese on the bread.  It was very good.  I may try wine instead of beer next time just to see.

Great recipe!  I added lots of garlic to the broth.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onion to top the sandwich then added the cheese of choice (cheddar, swiss, provolone) and baked in the oven till hot & bubbly.  This is a staple at our house.

My wife and I thought it was great, but my college-age son thought is was okay.  I cooked it in the slow cooker.  When I got home from work, I shredded the meat and put it the pressure cooker.  Then I poured all of the juices into the presurre cooker.  I cooked it with high pressure for 20 minutes, then served.  Very tasty!  Will do this recipe again. 
I didn't use beer, but I did use 1 cup of red wine.

Big hit.  I used an already cooked roast beef deli meat so I only cooked this for a couple of hours (just to get the beer cooked and some good flavor going).  Also I broiled provolone cheese on the buns and added some grilled onions.  Will definitely make this again.

I substituted a cup of dry red wine for the beer and added a few cloves of fresh garlic.  Very good.  Thank you.

So easy to prepare and delicious. I used a chuck roast, and with crusty sandwich rolls and a salad, we had a wonderful dinner. This is a keeper.

This is just fantastic! Everyone, including the kids, loved it. I used 2 smaller chuck tender roasts (about 5 1/2 pounds total), 2 cans of Campbell's French onion soup, 1 can of Campbell's Beef Consomme, and 1 bottle of light beer. The beer does add something special--you don't get a "beer" flavor, but you do get a nice rich broth that is surprisingly not too salty. I plan to turn the leftovers into a beef-and-barley soup! Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

I love French dips, but this one is by far the best I have ever tested, including in restaurants.  The aroma of it cooking all day is incredible.  The sauce is very flavorful, and the meat is unbelievably tender and juicy.  Yet it is a no brainer recipe--simple and quick.  And clean up is a breeze since only the crock pot is used for both the meat and the sauce.  Everyone should try this!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Super easy and super good!  I cut the amount of meat in half.  I left my slow cooker on for 9 hours, and it came out just fine.  Buttering and toasting the rolls is key! Thanks for the recipe!

I had my doubts about this recipe because rump roast is not the most tender of cuts.  But once I sliced the beef very thin for the sandwiches, my doubts were laid to rest.  I did use an envelope of onion soup mix instead of the canned, and I added a cup of water and 4 beef bouillon cubes.  The au jus created was delicious!  Thanks.

I overcooked mine a little and the meat got too dry, but if I hadn't this would have been wonderful.  The beer really does give it a wonderful flavor! Just like in the deli--I always wondered what that flavor was!!

Really like this recipe! I must be using too cheap of beer, because I can definitally detect it, but it still is very good. Couldn't be easier to make! Most time consuming part is just slicing it. I highly suggest toasting the buns!

This is a HIT!  I made it yesterday and my family devoured it.  We can't wait to eat the leftovers.  The only change I made from the original recipe was that I used tri-tip instead of rump roast.  Tri-tip was on special, plus it is usually better anyway.

Uuuhhhh. I am so full because I tried to eat two! We also added swiss cheese to the bread, and sliced the meat half an hour before serving so the slices could soak up some more of the jus. I only used a two pound roast because there were only two of us. We have leftovers.

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was amazing! Very easy and great for those busy nights.  I've made it with a bunch of different cheeses (Monterey Jack, Swiss, Brie and Colby) and it was always the perfect sandwich.  My husband begs for this meal at least twice a month!

This is a very good recipe. The meat was very tender. I don't think I will use the beer next time, it was a little too overpowering. I will double up on the beef broth and use the onion soup as well.

A very easy meal to make. It takes all day but well worth the wait.  I cooked it for 7 hours but wonder if 6 hours would be enough.  It was a tad on the dry side but not enough to effect the flavor.  Be sure the bread is done in the oven with butter, as this is a perfect taste.Definitely a thumbs up.

Amazing!  I can't wait to make this for company. After the buns were toasted, I laid the meat on the bottom half of the bun then covered it with provalone cheese.  Then I put it back in the oven for about 2 minutes, until the cheese was melted.  C'est tres bien!  Merci!

3.6.19  We enjoyed this, but I did think it was longing for some garlic.  Next time I make this, I will cut some slits in the beef, and insert some thin slices of garlic (something my Mother always did with both beef and pork).  Very simple dinner after a full day of yard work.   Enjoyed the sandwich with a slice of mozzarella and quick melt under the broiler then topped with some sliced pepperoncini,  three bean salad, and warmed up scalloped potatoes. I did add a little bit of Kitchen Bouquet® to the au jus to give it a little more eye appeal.   The beef was  tender, moist and easy to slice.  Good slow cooker meal for sure.

Loved it. Thanks to those who suggested chuck roast and sprinkling onion and garlic powder on it. I used Guinness Stout. I had a 3.25 pound roast, used all the liquid in the recipe, and it was done on just under 7 hours on low. I sliced thin, and added the meat back into the slow cooker on warm while I had the rolls in the oven. Very good.

Very easy and very good. Easily 5 stars. I took the advice about what to add from others. A little salt, pepper, two crushed garlic cloves, Worcestershire, thyme, cayenne, rosemary, and a little red wine because it was open.

Followed several suggestions from reviewers by seasoning the beef prior to placing it in the crockpot.  I used two smaller roasts so I may have exceeded the 4 pounds. My one takeaway is that it truly needs the full 7 hours of cooking time and it could use a little more seasoning/salt. I used a 16 oz can of Coors as that's what I found in the back of my 'fridge.  Next time I'll follow suggestions and use a darker beer.  Putting the buns in the oven made them nice and crusty, perfect for dipping! My family loved it, said it was a keeper recipe!  Thank you  for sharing this recipe.

So easy and so tasty!  This will definitely become a regular.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and rubbed the roast with garlic powder and ground black pepper.   Also added a few dashes of Worcestershire and used Guinness for the beer.  Served with Chef John's French Fries from this site!  The best!

I give five stars because it started it all. After taking quite some time to read other reviews, I found what worked for us. I plan to share this with my local fire house because they are always looking for slow cooker recipes. Oh and the left overs are great if not better and we paired ours with swiss cheese and sourdough bread.

Loved it. I have made a few times and always add the Worcestershire and garlic. Lipton makes a beefy onion soup mix that works great in this.  Dark beer a must and is not detectable.  Try it! Get a big roast, you'll need it. Slicing and back to crock cannot be skipped (unless it falls apart on it's own ).

I added extra garlic and stuck it into all of the sirloin tip pieces.  I seasoned the meat the night before with everything but the juices ( beer and I used low sodium beef broth) I woke up in the am and put it all together. I cut it up a half hour before was going to serve and I thought it was a little bland. I added some mccormicks steak seasoning on eachnpeice and threw it back into the crockpot for the remaining half hour- it came out delicious!!! Everyone complemented. Would make again- very easy

This recipe is SO good and SO easy. I used a rump roast and followed a few suggestions made by others. I mixed 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of onion powder, a few shakes of salt and ground pepper and rubbed the mix all over my roast. I put it in the crockpot dish and put it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors soak in, but you'd be fine not doing that if you don't have the time. In the morning I added 1 can of beef consomme, 1 can of beef broth, 1 packet of Lipton dried onion soup, 1 can of the darkest beer I could find, and 1 tbls of worcestershire sauce. With one hour left to cook, I took the roast out, sliced it thin, and added it back to the crock for another hour. This made it so juicy and extra flavorful!

For the rolls, I used a very soft hoagie-type roll. I buttered them, added provolone cheese and stuck them under the broiler until they were toasty. This was good, but even with the added crispness from the broiler, I think next time I'll pick a roll with a harder, crunchier crust - I think that would be the best combo with the ajou. Definitely put them in the broiler with cheese, though! mmm!

NOTE ABOUT COOKING TIME: I didn't have one, 4lb rump roast - I had two, approx. 2lb rump roasts - and it definitely did not need 7 hours to cook. Next time, if I'm working with two smaller roasts, I'll probably cook on low for about 4hrs, take it out and slice it and then cook for 1 more hour on low.

I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks everyone for the great su

Outstanding. Very simple to make. Makes a great pot roast if you don't want to make sandwiches. The remaining liquid makes fantastic aujous for dipping. Also great as a gravy for mashed potatoes.

Very good recipe. I put salt and pepper on the meat and then seared it for a few minutes in a cast iron skillet to keep in the juices. My entire family enjoyed the meal. Definitely get the French rolls, they were perfect!  We added sauted onions. We put provolone cheese on the roll and then put under broiler for a couple minutes to melt the cheese. 
Will definitely make again. A great fall / winter lunch or dinner.

Very good, very easy, it doesn't get any better.  I used a 2 lb Top Round Roast and a 2 lb Bottom Round, both were good, I like the Bottom Round better as it seemed juicier.  Both were very lean so no grease to deal with in the sauce (which I did strain in a fine strainer before serving).  I cut the beer down to just a little over 1/2 a can and am glad I did, added 1 1/2 T of Worch & 1 T Kitchen Bouquet to the sauce, used 1 can beef broth, 2 cans of condensed French Onion soup + 1 dry pkt of French Onion soup mix dissolved in about 1 1/2 c very hot water.  I rubbed the roasts with garlic & onion powder & Kosher salt then seared on both sides before putting in slow cooker.  Cooked on low for 7 hrs, shredded meat & refrigerated meat in the sauce overnight for guests the next day.  About an hr before serving, I put the juice & meat back into slow cooker to reheat...very tender, juicy and flavorful.  I cut the Hoagie Rolls in half and then split them open, buttered both insides lightly, roasted at 375 (butter side up) for 4 to 5 mins, just until  lightly "crunchy" to hold up under the moist meat (I roasted extra buns for left overs the next day.).  Took buns out after roasting, loaded with meat, topped with Provolone cheese, back in the oven set to broil til cheese melted (watch very closely so they don't burn).  The sandwiches and the sauce were absolutely delicious!  Everyone raved and left overs the next day were marvelous although there wasn't much left, enough for 1 sandwich

Omfg so good, I'll probably make this at least every month and a half for the rest of my life. I used a 2.5 lb eye of round roast since it's only me and my husband and it still made enough meat for 5 sandwiches. I added a couple shakes of garlic powder and Worcestershire and used 12oz of porter.  I used toasted Cobblestone white bread rolls and some Swiss cheese for assembly. Absolutely delicious!

Delicious every time.  The beer makes the recipe so  don't leave it out.  No changes to this recipe needed.  It's perfect.

This is probably my favorite dish. I make it as often as I can, it's so easy and sooo good. I use Guinness or something dark and syrupy, I've tried lagers and other beers but stouts seem to taste best and give it a richness and dimension of flavor that others don't. I can't recommend this enough, everyone I've ever made it for LOVES it. I do butter the French rolls and sprinkle them generously with garlic salt before toasting them, then melt provolone over top. I want some right now just thinking about it... Leftovers are amazing and you can make some awesome other dishes with them.

EASY!!!!! brought it to work for my co-workers and got nothing but raving reviews. I recommend that everyone if you are thinking about trying it, TRY IT! Totally worth it.
I did take the tips of using Chuck Roast and seasoning the beef a little before putting it in the slow cooker, but super easy.

I made this a month ago and it was delicious.  I am now making it for Father's Day.  After reading many reviews, I made the following changes:

4 lbs bottom round roast; 
2 cans Campbells Beef Consomme; 
1 pkg dry lipton soup mix; 
12 ozs stout/dark ale; 

Added to top of meat 1/2 tsp of each:
fresh garlic,
garlic powder,
salt,
pepper, and

1 TBSP Worchester Sauce.  

Added a package of sliced mushrooms.

Cooked the meat as stated, removed and sliced thin then added back to juice to cook for 30 minutes longer.

THIS WAS THE BOMB!!!!  Served on rolls with provolone and/or Swiss cheese.

My husband and I had this and it was absolutely fabulous!  This took 3 days to finish, but we did it!  I normally get to eat all leftovers, but my husband fought me for them (and he never eats leftovers).  It was a great recipe that was great even for the the next 2 nights.  We spread not only butter, but also garlic on the bread before putting on the beef.  Add some mozzarella and you've got a great sandwich to dip in the au jus.

I cooked this on low for 4 hours (almost half the time recommended) and it was already overcooked. It was tough and dry and lacked flavor aside from the overwhelming beer flavor. I spent $20 on the roast. Definitely not one I would make again.

Followed this recipe exactly. Felt it would be better named "pot roast french dip" as all the recipe does is make a sandwich that tastes like pot roast.

This is super good and easy to make! Love it! I think the only thing I would different next time is maybe saute some peppers in a skillet to go along w/ sandwich. But, sandwiches are very good! A good pairing would be a cold salad such as potato.

Very good recipe. The beer enhances that distinctive flavor you associate with the French Dip sandwich. I did brush the roast with Kitchen Bouquet and added a few shakes of garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

VERY good!  I don't drink beer and my husband only drinks the cheapo light stuff...but I did have an open bottle of Merlot that I had used a couple of days prior..and I wanted to use up (i don't drink wine either).  So, I used the wine instead...about 1 1/2 cups for a 2 1/2 lb roast kept everything else the same.  It was very good and my husband LOVED it.  Nice change from the ordinary meat and 2 sides dinners.  I served them with some crispy oven fries http://layersofhappiness.com/extra-crispy-oven-baked-french-fries/ .  I altered the french fry seasonings to suit our taste. Everything was a hit! :)  Thank you for this recipe.  Definitely will be making again!

The only problem was the beef was completely shredded after 7 hours. So if you want an actual french dip, roast the meet instead. However, it was AMAZING!

Changes I made from reading reviews:
1. We don't drink at all, so I substituted beer for Pepsi
2. Add 2 tbsp Worcestershire
3. Add 2 tbsp mustard
4. Add 2 tbsp soy sauce
5. Add a pinch of salt and pepper
6. Sautee onions and put in the bottom of the crock pot
7. Add pinches of garlic powder.

This really was delicious!!!

O.M.G.  I have made this 3 times already and its a quick way to get rid of slightly over 4 pounds of rump roast quick!  So flavorful, very tender rump roast and moist.  No way to mess this recipe up (and I've tried...forgot to add beer in the morning, remembered in the last 30 minutes so I added it and it still tasted great; probably wouldn't have missed anything other than more juice).  I added enough Worcestershire sauce to cover the roast, along with garlic and onion powder and ground mustard powder.  Husband was amazed at how simple and quick it was to assemble compared to other slow cooker meals.  For the rolls I butter, add McCormick's Garlic Bread Spread powder and toast using the broiler then add whatever kind of cheese I have on hand to the bread, assemble sandwiches and put back into a warm oven for a few minutes.  Amazing how 6 hoagie rolls disappear in a matter of minutes.

This is super easy and so good. Guinness is my choice of beer to use. Any stout is preferred. I actually cook all of my roasts with it, doesn't matter what kind of meat. Anyway, back to the recipe. Sometimes I throw in a packet of dry Itailian dressing. I sear my roast before I put it in the crock pot too. I cook mine low and slow for 8 or more hours. Instead of slicing it, I shred it. Yummers!

Please note that I did some revisions due to previous reviews, and my own substitions but I'm sure the original would be great as well!  I used dry onion soup mix as I couldn't find the can of onion soup in the grocery store I went to, a can of beef consomme, and added sliced onions that I browned in a frying pan.  I took it out with an hour left and sliced the beef, at this point it was already shredding so maybe in the future I would preslice, and also pre cut off fatty bits as there was quite a few of those left but that was from the cut of meat I got.  Husband said he could eat that several times a month, the dipping sauce was very flavourful.  Don't skip out on toasting the buns that made it even better, I toasted them in a frying pan with a bit of butter so I didn't have to heat up the oven.

Mine turned out a bit dry - soaking it back in the juices after slicing helped. The flavor was really good though. We'll add sliced Provolone cheese next time.

My rating is technically a 4.5 and the only thing keeping it from being 5 star is that it does need tweaked on the seasonings.  I've made this as is and also made with mods.  
After googling rump roast I settled on a bottom round roast.  While I do believe that another cut is probably more flavorful this one slices well with electric knife and is tender.  I do agree with a reviewer who used consommé instead of the broth.  At least 1 tsp salt and W sauce are must haves to make this basic.  My own preferences include garlic and onion powder.  
This has nothing to do with my rating but I suggest making a horseradish mayo and putting provolone on your sandwich.  Very good.

Just ok, sadly. Had high expectations based off reviews, but thought it was rather bland.

I made this and it was a hit.  I used hogie rolls which kind of got soggy. Next time I'll use the french rolls.  My hubby has been craving this sandwich and I found a winner recipe.

Loved the recipe and so did my family. I am glad I read the reviews because this recipe is great but seriously lacking in seasoning. I added salt, pepper, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. This helped it to come out perfect. I will make this again

Great recipe! Easy and quick prep time. One of my family's top requested recipe. I have followed the recipe every time but double it and I use Beef Consomme because I feel the flavor is more intense.  My son loves the au jus to dip his but with the tender meat and flavor this recipe gives - its not necessary. I love the variations people try and I am going to try some next time.

I couldn't find the cut of meat specified so I used a round eye roast.  It was very lean but not dry at all. As suggested by other reviewers, I added about 4 cloves of garlic and used 1 packet of onion soup and twice the broth.  Served on heated naan with spicy pepper jack cheese melted on the bread.  It was really delicious.

This is a great, super easy recipe that my whole family loves. I use Shiner beer and rub "Adams Reserve All Purpose Rub " all over the roast before placing it in the pot. Sometimes I also add a cup of sliced Greek peperoncini peppers (with liquid) to give it a bit of a kick.

First of all, this was the easiest thing in the world to make. I didn't like this as much as the rest of my family, I thought this was too salty, and I generally didn't like the sauce. The rest of my family really liked it though. I used Anchor steam beer, so maybe that has something to do with it. However, I don't think I will make this again.

The beer left a very overpowering flavour.  So much so that it dominated everything else.  If you are not a beer lover (I'm indifferent myself) try substituting for another flavored liquid

This recipe is fantastic!  I use a rump roast, personally like that it is less fatty than the chuck.  Followed to the letter the first time with great results, and subsequently added minced garlic (2-3 cloves), worcestershire (several shakes, probably around 1/2 tsb - but we love this in our beef stew, do to taste) and added some pepper to the roast before pouring in the soup/beer.  There is enough salt in the soup, IMO, I personally wouldn't add more unless you like extra salt.  I toasted cheese onto the french rolls as suggested (have used both mozzarella and white cheddar, both were great).   I also followed the suggestion of saving the extra gravy and adding mushrooms the following night, amazing over noodles!!!  My kids could not eat this fast enough.

This recipe is Delicious!!! I did not have beer on hand so I didn't add it.  I did add 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the original recipe. The meat was tender and rich with flavor.  The broth was was perfect for sandwich and french fry dipping.

Like some of the other reviews I added garlic and pepper. After taking it out and slicing it was just slightly dry in the middle. I made a gravy starting w a roux, added the cooking liquid and about a tsp of Dijon mustard. Tossed in the meat and it was delicious. Horseradish and provolone cheese on a bun and it was magical.  Also, I was out of beef so just added about a can and a half of water.

My husband was complaining about how much we spent on meat but when i made this for him on his birthday he fell in love!

The second time i made this i used a bottom round roast (2 2 pound roast) seasoned them with salt and garlic powder and had it on low for about 10 hours and OMG was it so tender and amazing!  It's so worth fancy French bread loafs I picked up at the store.

Ummmm-mazing!  I'm not even a fan of french dips!  Bits of advice-- It took longer for my beef to cook.  Well, I did a full 7 1/2 hrs, and then put it in another 1/2 hr after slicing.  I seasoned the beef with what I had on hand-- onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley & threw several shakes of worchestershire sauce into it.  Used regular beef broth, condensed french onion soup, an amber beer.  Slice the beef THIN!!!

I didn't' put butter on our buns, and it was still amazing. I served it with a dipping sauce that I thought was mind-blowing.  Just grabbed some of the broth from the crock pot, and added a squeeze of japanese wasabi and a couple of splashes of red wine vinegar.  Everyone was in LOVE  This is a big-time keeper!

I tried this recipe with beef consommé and French onion soup as some reviewers had suggested.  It was pretty flavorless and unimpressive.  My family would not eat this again.

So good!!! my husband loved it so much and said this is one of his new favorite meals. I used a chuck Roast, added a little garlic salt, and onion salt, mushrooms, minced garlic, and dried French onion mix. I put provolone on the bread and used the broiler to melt it. Will definitely be making this regularly.

The flavor of this roast was so good! I used a dark porter beer. Ours actually fell apart so couldn't slice it & ended up just shredding it.. Will definitely make again.

Very good but every time I make it, it just shreds apart.  I want it cooked and be able to slice it very very thin.  Is it the roast I am using or am I cooking it too long?

This is a very good starter French dip.  It tasted good and you cannot beat the ease of making it in the crockpot.  I will be tweaking it a bit the next time to see how I can improve an already good recipe.

This was very bland and tasted more of beer than onion soup. I had to add another can of french onion, salt, and onion powder. Any recipe where I have to add something to make it taste better is not a 5 star in my mind. Will be looking for another French Dip recipe.

Husband and I loved this. Slow cooked for about 8 hours, it was fall apart tender. Advice I followed from previous reviewers: used 6 ounces of beer not 12 (hubby doesn't like the taste of beer), added 1 tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. Once meat was sliced I put back into cooker to soak up more juice while I buttered and heated up rolls. Then placed meat on heated rolls, topped with provalone cheese slices and put under the broiler for a few minutes. So good! Will definitely add to the regular rotation of meals.

I made this recipe using a 3 pound sirloin tip roast.  I seasoned my roast with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and sea salt then I browned it in a frying pan with a little oil before putting it in the crockpot.  After that step, I followed the recipe exactly as written, adding the meat to the crockpot with the beef broth and french onion soup and a 16 ounce can of Miller High Life beer (a stray beer my 21 year old son left in the fridge LOL).  I pulled the roast out after 5 hours and sliced it and put it back in the crockpot for an hour with the crockpot set on warm.  I buttered my french rolls and sprinkled a little garlic salt on them and put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes and then pulled them out, put meat on them and topped them with slices of mozzarella cheese and put them back in the oven under the broiler for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese.  I served them with fried mushrooms, and individual bowls of au jus on the side to dip them in.  The meat turned out very moist and tender but we all felt like they were just missing something, we just couldn't figure out what.  They were lacking in flavor and my son said they tasted just like pot roast on a bun.  I would probably make them again but they are not my favorite and I will probably try the other recipe on this site for french dip sandwiches made with soy sauce and rosemary.

followed it exactly and it turned out great. Had a hard time in Canada finding French onion so just bought Campbell's onion soup. Turned out it is no longer available here or they have just renamed it onion. I do see French onion on the US site though. Probably the quickest slow cooker recipe I've made to date (all of 1 min to throw it all together).

Made this last night exactly as written.  After 5 hours of cooking on low the meat was tough and WAY over cooked, almost like leather. It was completely inedible.  What a waste of $$$.

I've made this before but with 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of beer.  Add rosemary, basil, and thyme.  Makes the best french dip ever.

I have made this several times and really like it.I misread the ingredients and used an envelope of the dry onion soup mix.I don't know what the can version tastes like but I will continue to use the envelope...no extra seasoning needed.The meat is delicious and is so tender! Thanks for submitting!

The first time I made this as is it was good,but far from great. Though it had potential. If you aren't making this last minute I highly recommend you use leftover french onion soup rather than can. The day before I make this, I'll make slow cooker french onion soup for dinner and reserve some for this recipef. I omit the beef broth from this recipe. But follow the rest of this recipe accordingly and add either swiss or monterey jack cheese. It's flawless, best sandwich I've ever had.. AINEC. Of course it isn't as quick as the original, but it's worlds better, and in turn you get two excellent meals already planned for the week.

Really simple and easy. I found that it was a little dry but I think my slow cooker  actually cooks fast. Was done in about 2 hours. I just got it... so I dunno if I left the meat in longer it would've dried out more ... or sucked in more juices and would fall apart like pulled pork????! Slow cooker is totes new to me but the meat and gravy were so delicious... there were no left overs. THANKS!!! I will make this more and hopefully figure out the timing on my croc!

Omg this is my all time favorite recipe from this site!! I like to use a chuck roast but you definitely need to cook this in advance, refrigerate the entire thing, scoop out the fat that raises to the top and then heat back up.

I've made this recipe several times! It is always great! It is simple and easy! The only thing I change is I only add 6 oz of light beer. Everyone I've shared this recipe with has enjoyed it as well. Thanks for sharing it! 
UPDATE: I tried this with dark beer (Guiness draught in the can). I used 12oz. It was soooo much better! Great depth of flavor! No going back, this is the way I make it now.

I made this for my family and they loved it - particularly my Dad who really does not have 'working' taste buds due to radiation treatments.  He does not eat much but he went back for seconds on this one! I used a chuck roast and consommé instead of broth.  I also toasted my hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.  YUMMO!!

This was fantastic!!!  I used A Sam Adams Winter Lager, added some minced garlic, and a heaping spoon of wet hot chopped red pepper (the jar is in the Goya aisle) for some added Portuguese goodness.  We also threw a little swiss cheese on top of the shredded meat, that had been carefully divided into sandwich sized piles, onto a cookie sheet, broiled it until the cheese bubbled and then slid it onto the toasted, butter and garlic-salted french roll... that was one tasty sandwich!  Mmmmmm

This recipe is what got us hooked on allrecipes.com.  This is an amazing starting off point for french dip sandwiches.  We like to add: fresh garlic, use beef consomme instead of the beef broth, couple shakes of Worchestershire, fresh ground pepper, onion powder.  Canned french onion soup works better than dry mix, dark beer better than light.  We've made this so many times over the last 3 years and it's never once turned out anything less than delicious. We always start a large batch late the night before and let it cook through the night on low (leaving it on low or warm during the day) until serving for dinner.  No need to slice the meat because it just falls a part on it's own.  Freezes beautifully, so we eat a little and freeze the rest.  LOVE love love this recipe!

I read another reader's critical post and I have to agree with them that giving a recipe 5 stars when you've significantly altered the recipe is not a fair assessment of the recipe. I unfortunately did not read the other reviews before making this. I made the recipe as written above and it was not good at all. The meat lacked flavor and was tough. I did slice it up and put it back in the broth to cook for another hour. That did help soften the beef, but still lacked flavor. I will not make this recipe again.

I hate cooking with beer but I thought I would try it. Surprise it was very good. I did follow others suggestions on soy sauce. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was good, but the meat was really dry. I even took the advice of others and I sliced the meat and let it simmer in the juices for the last 45 minutes hoping the juices would help with the dryness, but it did not help as much as I would have liked. My husband really did not care for this, so I have a whole lot of leftovers to eat by myself.

I've had this recipe several times with different cuts of meat (chuck included). I finally was able to find the rump roast it calls for and made it that way, it was by far the best cut of meat for this recipe. And I usually cook it 8 hours then the crockpot keeps it on warm for an hour or more. I don't butter the rolls, though. Very easy, very delicious, and not too hefty on the calories either. Love it. Oh, and I think the flavor of the broth depends on the kind of beer you use. I used Sam Adams light.

Used onions plus a little water instead of soup.  Sliced (or it fell apart) meat and let is soak up juices for a bit before serving.  My 5-year-old had seconds!

This was awesome but I made a few changes. I added a heaping tsp of minced garlic, onion powder, worchestershire, black pepper and 2 dashes of brown gravy mix. I buttered the bread, put some minced garlic on each one and some mozzerella cheese to make a light garlic bread. It was sooo good! Thanks for the idea!

This recipe is fantastic! It's the first recipe I've ever reviewed but it was so amazing, I just had to take a moment to type this up. I followed the recipe almost exactly and my whole family (including two hard to please kids) LOVED it. They thanked me over and over for making it and have requested it again ASAP. The only changes were that I used a sirloin tip roast, seasoned it with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper and used a can of Guinness Draught for the beer. I cooked it all day and it was falling apart by 4:30. I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and sliced/shredded it and let it simmer in the juice for about 30 minutes before I served. It was soooo good!!

I tried this for the first time this week. I loved it! It was a huge hit. I have shared this recipe with anyone who will listen! I added swiss cheese to mine but you can personalize yours adding onions, green peppers! I can't wait to make it again. I paired it with ranch wedges!

didn't have any onion soup so I used 2 cans of beef broth and a package of Lipton onion soup mix, plus some extra garlic powder. Also only had light beer on hand but it turned out great.

I consider myself to be a pretty seasoned cook and I was hoping that this would be a winner in our books.  It was a disappointment.  The broth had NO flavor at all.  I purchased a 4 pound rump roast, which fed 6. I will make this again because it was so easy, however next time I will add pepper, salt (more than a pinch..), garlic and maybe a package of french onion soup mix.  The meat was extremely dry and flavorless.. so i may substitute it with a more flavorful cut of beef.

Made this over night to bring for my co-workers.  We are always hungy at work.  I made exactly as written except I rubbed the meat with a beef seasoning and tenderized it by stabbing it with a fork every 2-3 inches.  Only because I usually always do to add flavor.  It was a GIGANTIC success and the Au Jus is AWESOME!  I could dip bread in a cup of that and be just as happy!!

This was okay. The meat was very tender and juicy, but the problem I had was the meat didn't have much flavor. If I made it again I would add some extra spices and maybe try a different beer.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Slow cooked 8hrs.  The lacked two hours I noticed it lacked a real flavor I was looking for.  it was just like you basic roast.  So I took out half of the juice added Rootbeer just a cup, garlic clove and 2 packets of Au Jus gravy with beef broth and fresh mushrooms.  Resumed cooking 2 hrs and it was delicious flavor.  Great dinner! 
I rate this recipe 5 stars.

I do a couple of things include cut an onion into rings and saute in butter 'til caramelized. I use a carton of beef broth and a package of onion soup mix and a bottle of good beer.  I'm not into cans!

I use a 3lb London broil

Put all ingredients in a slow cooker on high until meat is fork-tender and ready. 5-6 hours. Halfway through, taste the sauce and adjust spices, add more broth if needed. Pull the meat apart right in the cooker, remove all fat and let the meat rest a couple of minutes. You don't even need teeth, it's so tender!

This recipe was great!!  My kids and husband really liked it.  Juices are perfect for dipping.  We sauteed onions and bell peppers to top sandwiches, if wanted, we also topped with muenster cheese and made fresh chopped radishes and jalapenos, from the garden, available for topping.

I make this regularly now and refuse to share the recipe! lol...have to keep them coming back right?! I use Guinness...darker the beer the better...for those who don't like beer (I hate it...you don't taste beer)!  If in a jam I will use french onion soup mix dissolved in a cup of boiling water...sometimes I add a little spanish onion and always half a tsp of paprika. It works well with any meat but the key is definately to take it out...cut it up and return it to the cooker to simmer another while!  Hope you all enjoy this as much as I do! Oh...I have tried many varieties of cheese on this under the broiler...I vote provlerone like many others here!  Thanks lonwolf32.

Works great with venison too!  To save time I cube the roast and it shreds easily when it is ready to serve.

This was soooo good.  The meat cooked up so tender, and the sauce was amazing.  I followed some of the suggestions and added 1 clove of minced garlic to the sauce in the slow cooker, and about a teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce.  Let it simmer all day.  When it came time to put the cut up meat back in the slow cooker, I added some garlic salt at my husband's suggestion.  End result was fantastic!  Will definitely be making this again!

Yummy!  These sandwiches were goooooood!  I used an eye of round roast for this.  That is not my favorite cut of beef because it always seems dry and tasteless.  Not in this recipe!  Can't wait for the leftovers for lunch today!

Fabulous. I did it in a 350 degree oven for about 3 to four hrs and used a shoulder (maybe) roast because that is what I had on hand. Started it from frozen arrived home after leaving it and having to do nothing else and it was the best french dip I have ever had!!

Super easy and great for the men in our lives! I add minced garlic to the liquid and then I'll save the left overs and put leftover roast beef in it to soak. Makes the beef yummy and easy to make again the next day for the men who are afraid of cooking anything beyond eggs! LOL Thanks!

I mad this a couple days ago and it was really good. The only thing I did that I will change next time is the beer. I borrowed a beer from my neighbor bc I didnt want to buy a whole 6pack since I had no intention of drinking the rest. It was a light beer and it was good but next time Im just gonna buy the 6 pack and go for a dark beer. I think it will make the au jus richer.

This is a great recipe! Everyone raved about it! I seasoned the roast with garlic powder, black pepper, and kosher salt and then seared it in a pan on both sides before putting in crock pot. I did use a can of beef consomme in place of beef broth and added a packet of onion soup mix. So easy and delicious.

Picky husband and super picky teenaged son say this is a winner.  I cooked it on a Sunday and put it in the fridge until Tuesday night.  Skimmed all fat off the top, sliced and put in the oven with juices over the top to rewarm.  melted butter and mozzerella under the broiler then added horseradish.  Yum!  My husband talked about it the day after as well.

The sauce literally turned into white nasty chunks of fat after sitting overnight. The flavor was not very good either.

My crew LOVES this.  It has become a regular on my menu.  Being in a dry county we've got to travel out of town for beer so I replace it with dry white cooking wine that's in the cabinet.

You've got to be KIDDING me, right?! Someone please pinch me so I know I'm not dreaming! This is absolutely THE best French dip I've ever had!!! And I've had some pretty awesome French dip sandwiches in my lifetime. My husband, who never usually has the au jus with his sandwiches, was converted into a dipper! I must say, I am not a beer fan at all and was quite hesitant about adding the beer (I used Guinness), especially after smelling it I thought I ruined the whole thing. But it really adds a wonderful flavor. I added some garlic powder and just a few splashes of soy sauce for extra flavor. I made French baguettes from this website to serve the meat on. I cannot wait for dinner tonight so I could have the leftovers!!

Awesome!  Followed recipe, but didn’t have 7 hours to cook.  Placed everything in my Nesco 6qt roaster for about 3 1/2 hours at 350 then turned down to 300 until ready to serve.  After toasting the rolls, I placed the meat on the buns, covered with muenster cheese and put under the broiler to melt.  I then gave them a generous smear of of Adzel's Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread from this site and served with a ramekin of au jus for dipping.  The contrast of the zesty, cold horseradish spread with the hot meat and au jus was absolutely delicious!

This was not too bad.  My husband did not like, but said he was not a fan of soggy bread (dipping in the juice).  Easy to fix.

This was OK, I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic and then seared the meat before putting it into the crockpot.  We had to add a lot of seasonings to the broth and it still seemed bland.  I think I will stick with getting roast beef from the deli at the grocery store and then buy the packet of broth.

This was very tender, but I would suggest adding extra seasonings to get more flavor. I would add onion soup mix next time.

As written, this recipe is okay, but it's missing something.  I thought it was too bitter with just the beer, so I added 3/4 cup port wine and a little garlic and it turned out pretty good.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME... great recipe. I did add some garlic and onion powder as other suggested and a little extra on the worchestsire( spelling") but it was great. Husband said it is worth having again after he had already eaten 2 sandwiches.

Like most others, I tweak the recipe just a tad with seasoning (garlic powder, Onion salt, worcestershire sauce)  I also flash fry the meat in a pan before I put it in the crockpot.  Made it for a family get-together and everyone raved.  No leftovers!  Making it again right now.

Mmm soooo good! The Beer definitely adds more depth to the flavor of the broth! 
I'm in Canada and we don't have Condensed French Onion Soup, only thing I could find was Condensed Campbell's Vegetable Onion Soup, and it was pretty tasty. 
I also added some Garlic Powder, Pepper and a dash of Salt. 
Served on fresh toasted rolls with sauteed onions and Havarti  Cheese...oh my!

My family loves this recipe but i do make a change instead of the can of french onion soup i put in one package of liptons onion soup dry mix.....my family liked the other way but one day i did not have the can of soup and used the powder packet instead and my family loved that way even better.  The left overs are even better the next meal.  I always make a large large roast because this is one meal my whole family enjoys the left overs to.

I have made this for about 10 years with a few changes.  I always spice with steak seasonings, then add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the mix.  This makes a slightly thicker sauce.  PLEASE only use a dark beer!! Changes the whole flavor, makes it so much deeper and richer. MMMM toasted under the broiler for a min or 2 with a slice of provolone and carmalized onions.  OK making it tomorrow!!

I had high hopes for this recipe but it just didn't work out for me.  I thought the beer taste was a little too strong in the au jus.  Maybe I did something wrong?  Will not make again

Added a slice of swiss cheese to each roll. The meat just shredded, there was no way I could cut it...it was so tender. Wished I had a heavier or darker beer to put into the mix, but it was still really good.

5 plus ++ I knew this was going to be a yummy meal. This recipe smells and tastes so wonderful. I could smell it cooking from outside the house.  The night before I seasoned meat with a little blk pepper, rock salt and stuck some garlic cloves in the meat. I was only feeding two people so I had a smaller chuck roast, about 2.5 pounds. I put the roast in the slow cooker on LOW for 8 hours and used a can of Heinekin beer (that is all I had). Meat was so soft it fell apart and was juicy and tender but tasty..yum! After I sliced and shredded the meat I placed back in the juice to let it soak up. The french dip was so succulent and the french bread rolls to die for soaked up the dip nicely...I will definitely make this again and again!!

I used extra broth and my award winning homebrew robust porter.  After we ate I added extra onions, dry onion soup mix and some beef base and made it into french oniono soup.

Brilliantly simple, yet restaurant quality. No way to go wrong with this one. I have yet to use actual French rolls. We use Italian buns because that is all our grocery store carries. Works okay too.

Great Recipe!  I made it according to the recipe the first time and this time I am making it with Lance's French Onion soup as the base.  I did add onion powder, garlic powder and worchestershire as others have done.  I wanted to mention that this freezes well and tastes great as leftovers too!

This was fabulous!  I followed the suggestions of others and used a can of beef consomme and a can of onion soup (didn't use beer as we didn't have any in the house at the time).  I started by seasoning the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I then poured the soups over and added three sliced cloves of garlic.  Next time I'll throw in some sliced onions as well.  Cooked on low for 9 hours then removed roast, sliced thin, strained liquid and returned the roast to the liquid and continued to cook on low for another 30+ minutes.  Served on hoagies with provolone cheese and tucked under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese.  Au jus was perfect!  Super easy and yummy!

This was a wonderful recipe that was so simple, and so delicious.  First time I made it, I used a tri tip roast because it was on sale.  I added a little more seasoning, mustard, liquid smoke, worstishire (sp?) sauce, brown sugar, and it came out wonderful!  Brushing the rolls with butter and then putting them under the broiler is key!  My family also likes adding grilled onions and cheese to the sandwich.  All in all, a great recipe with great results!  Thanks lonwolf!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used my own home made French Onion Soup that I had left over to cook the meat in. I also added Burgundy Wine instead of Beer. Very good!

Very easy, very yummy.  I substituted red wine for the beer, which gave it a rich flavor, though it did discolor the outside surface of the meat, which, really, who cares about if what you're doing is slicing it up and putting it in a sandwich you're going to dip anyway.

Delicious!  Didn't trim fat - shredded meat when done, strained juice (son hates onions) and returned shredded meat to crock to serve.  So easy!  Add some provolone to those buns & broil until bubbly...YUM!

This recipe rocks!! My family of 5 really liked it a lot.  I would suggest adding salt, pepper, and chopped garlic to the roast while it is cooking.  I also added shredded mozzarella cheese to the sandwiches and popped them in the oven just long enough to let the cheese melt.  I would definitely suggest using Guinness beer.

After reading other reviews I seasoned the roast with salt and pepper before starting and added 2 cloves of garlic to the slow cooker.
The meat was still a little bland, but when put on a toasted bun with a little garlic butter and dipped in the jus, it was very good. Will definatly do it again, but I'll season it a little more next time. Maybe a little more garlic as well.
After a few more months of eating this on a regular basis, I've made a couple other changes. The roast is well seasoned with salt pepper and garlic powder. I also add a few cloves of minced garlic to the juice. Some worcestershire sauce as well.

This is wonderful! I've made it twice now and the 2nd time I realized I had no beer. It was still good w/out it. I bake the bread for 5 minutes but then I turn on the broiler for a minute or two to toast it. This sandwich is even better if you add sliced provolone cheese!

This was fantastic! My store didn't have rump roast so I used bottom round, but I think you could use chuck or just about any sort of roast with this recipe. I added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce and I used a dark Guinness for the beer. I bought some french rolls from the bakery for the sandwiches, spread a small amount of butter on them and toasted them in the broiler for a couple of minutes, then topped with provolone cheese and broiled a couple more minutes until it melted, then piled on the meat. Wonderful recipe, and I will definitely make it again. My husband loved it!

I have to agree with everyone else....this is a great recipe!!!! So easy and very flavorful!!!!!
Instead of the canned onion soup I used Lipton's onion soup and as suggested added the garlic.  
As one person said to bad we couldn't give more than the 5 stars.

Wonderful, and so easy! I used a crosscut chuck roast, and it literally fell apart, so it was not slice-able, but that made no difference! I also used one can of beef broth, one can of beef consomme and a bottle of Guinness. Left out the onion soup. It was absolutely delicious! I'll make this often.

After 7 hours in a slow cooker, with more than a quart (!) of liquid, slicing the beef was not an option.  It shredded itself with the touch of a knife.  The taste was ok, but without a sauce to help hold it together (like a sloppy joe) this made for a very, very messy sandwich.  I will stick with a traditional oven roast next time.

Very, very good! I took everyone's advice & added more seasoning (i.e. garlic powder, onion flakes, parsley, and some kitchen bouquet). Also, it just fell apart when trying to slice it, so we shredded the meat instead. My husband loved it! I am taking the left-over and making egg noodles to put it over. What a quick meal it will be! Yummy!!

Made it the day before.  Took the meat out and refrigerated it.  In the morning sliced up the cold meat, skimmed the fat off the sauce and put meat back in sauce to reheat.  Buttered good hero bread, put thick slice of Provelone on and melted it.  Placed meat on with sauteed onions on top. Meat was tender but bland.  Will try again but will add garlic, pepper and some Worchestire sauce.   Might add a drop of hot sauce to the sauce too.

Great with just the addition of garlic powder to taste.  I brown a shoulder chuck roast, then bake in oven for 3 to 4 hours until totally tender.

Excellent.  Made a few changes based on other reviews.  Used 1/2 bottle of "heavy" beer, dash of garlic salt and onion powder, and worcestershire sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Next time I will take everyone's advice and use a stronger beer.  I used a light beer and I thought that the meat tasted bland.  Once I added it to the buttered rolls, topped with provolone and steak sauce, it was delicious, but on its own, the meat needed something.  Very easy to make!

This recipe was fantastic! I used a rump roast, but would suggest a different cut as it was quite chewy and like eating elastic. Other than the cut of meat, this was superb. Exactly what I wanted. I will try a different cut of meat next time (perhaps sirloin tip as someone else suggested) but the rest of the recipe is good.

This was an easy and delicious choice that served 10 people easily for my daughter's birthday party.  I added dark beer, Lipton onion soup mix, beef broth, garlic, worchestershire, and pepper.  It was PERFECT and I had NO left overs!  I needed a little more au jus as we ran out, but that's only because everyone just gobbled it down.  Thanks!

Very good! We didn't have condensed French onion soup, so we used the dried packets of Lipton noodle soup - 2 of them. It worked out perfectly. Also, we are cheese fans. A slice of Provolone was excellent.

This is AWESOME!  And yes, super easy.    I did have to make changes because here, in Guam, I could not find condensed French onion soup.  I used the Lipton's onion soup mix, and on the back there is a recipe for a slow cooker meal.  It said to use both packets and add 3/4 cup water, which is what I did.    Also, we didn't have rump roast at our commissary, so we used something close to it.    A KEEPER!

Made this "as shown" for game day and again for Xmas Eve.  We found it delicious as is.  I did serve with provolone & swiss cheese and sauteed onions and green peppers.  I am anxious though to try some of the variations that I read about in the comments. This is a recipe that I will use alot

These were so good.  My husband likes more seasoning and didn't like them as much as he thought they were bland.  I had them leftover for lunch for several days and they were fantastic left over.

I made this exactly as listed and it was phenomenal. I could still smell the beer in the au jus, but I couldn't taste it. The leftovers lasted forever with just my husband and I. Great recipe.

OMG...this was an awesome recipe. The flavor was great. We had lots of leftovers but did not mind eating them for dinner again the next two nights. I did add a little bit of garlic salt but I like salty. I also put provolone on them sandwiches. I will be making this recipe for a long time. Thanks for posting it. My mouth is watering as I type up this review.

Great recipe to base your version of it on.  I seared the roast with some salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders, then used one can of beef connsumme instead of the beef broth with the french onion soup, and bought a sirloin tip roast instead of a rump roast. I also had it in the crock pot a lot longer. Soaking the slices before serving is KEY! I soaked ours for a good 20-30 minutes before serving and it paid off. So good. Served on french rolls with butter & mozz cheese under the broiler. As we say in my family, this one's a keeper.

VERY TASTY! Followed the suggested changes and added 1 can of beef consomme. Such a nice change of pace from regular beef roast. Used Hawaiian rolls and even 2.5 yr. old daughter loved to dip her sandwich!

This was WONDERFUL!  My hubby really likes french dips and I've tried to imress him with several other versions, but this recipe did it!  So easy, too!  We added just a tad bit of salt into the juice for dipping, and topped them with provolone cheese, otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Thanks lonwolf32!!

I followed this recipe precisely, but the meat came out dry and tasteless!  The liquid was very fatty, even though I had trimmed the meat.

Followed recipe exactly, using a stronger beer (Guinness) as reviewers suggested.  My family loved it.  I thought it could have used a little more spices (garlic, pepper) or onions and mushrooms as some reviewers suggested. Provolone (also suggested) was a nice addition.  Will make it again with extra spices.

I made this recipe exactly as stated...made sure my cut of meat said exactly same..but it was terrible, tough. The sauce created by the other ingredients was decent and flavorfilled---but totally doesn't compensate that the meat was NOT GOOD!

My family really liked this!  Even my two little ones enjoyed it.  I used the wrong kind of roast (arm roast) so it didn't have the texture of a traditional French dip sandwich, but the flavor was great.  I used 1 can of consumme, 1 bottle of Guiness and 1 package of French Onion soup mix. I didn't think it needed any other spices.  We also melted some provolone on.  Delightful!

Super easy. Whole family loves these. I typically make with a sirloin tip roast but many cuts will work well. I broil bread with provolone for a few minutes. Thanks for posting have made these several times pleases even picky children.

This was soooo good!  I used a pot roast, instead of a rump roast.  I also used light beer (that's all we had in the house), and it came out great.  So easy to make, and was so tender and juicy!  This is going into my crock pot rotation!

I made this using a bottom round roast, didn't use the French onion soup or beer.  I just added additional beef broth, but used College Broth Bold Stock. I also followed one reviewer's suggestion to put the beef back in the crock pot after slicking.  Very good.

This is so easy and tastes great! Its only me and my husband so I cut the beef in half but kept everything else the same. I cooked it for 5 1/2 hours, then sliced the beef and put it back in the slow cooker. I also added peppers, onions and sea salt and provolone cheese on the french rolls and it was delightful.

Excellent recipe. Be sure to add some additional garlic, onion powder,Worchester and kitchen Bouquet. I also add one packet of Au Jus mix. Take the meat out and let it sit for 10 min prior to slicing. It will help retain some of the moisture. Then add back to crock pot for 30 min.

I'm one of those people that hate beer no matter what it's in, so I didn't use it in this recipe. I used a second can of beef broth instead and the roast came out incredible! I took the roast out of the crockpot and let it rest for 20 minutes, sliced it, and then added it back to the juices for another 30 minutes or so.

The beef was nothing spectacular, but the DIP! was amazing, earning this 4 stars in my book!

Next time, I will cook for less time and hope that the beef is less dry.

This recipe was very easy.  However, I did not care for it.  To me, it tasted more like pot roast.  The beef broth, onion taste... I don't know what made it taste that way.  Next time I may just use a packet of au jus, maybe even a different cut of meat.

Followed the recipe exactly, and thought it was great! Served it on fresh rolls, buttered and baked (two with a slice of muenster cheese), and everyone loved it!  I couldn't really slice it very well.  I let it rest for quite awhile, but it was still warm. So there were some slices and some crumbles, but all tasted wonderful.  EASY prep!

Very easy way to make french dips!  I used a crossrib roast and it turned out perfect.  The meat was tender and had a nice flavor!

I love anything that is easy and delicious!  The whole family enjoyed this and I have already been asked to make it again!  I served on my Lager Bread that I made into rolls - delicious combination as the meat and the bread are made with beer.

WOW this was great and soooo easy!  Im a working mom so quick and easy are a huge plus in our home!!!  I used a can of Bud Lite and thought that was great.  I didnt butter the rolls, but did add cheese when toasting them....YUMMY!  Also added some garlic and onion powder to meat before cooking....pretty much a staple in our home on everything!  22 month old asked for 2nds and hubby said "think Ill have another one or two!"  GREAT as leftovers!!!

My whole family loved this! I didn't make very many changes. I chopped up a whole yellow onion and added it to the crock pot. I also seasoned the roast with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I used Coors Light beer because that is the only beer we had in the house. I also turned the roast every few hours to make sure it cooked evenly. Turned out AMAZING! Onions were great on the sandwich. Will be making this again for sure!!

Awesome and Easy. I used Tri-Tip instead and did not add beer and it was really really good. My husband and friends always ask me to make it.

This is a family favorite.  I have the best results with California roast.  I make exactly as directed, top with provolone cheese and serve on a buttered, toasted roll.  I have used frozen and fresh roasts with equally delicious results.  My children often request this as their birthday dinner.  The results far exceed the effort required to make it!

Made for a great dinner. I did accidentally forget to add the beer. Also added a bunch of seasonings, garlic salt, onions, pepper, soy sauce, per the other reviews. It turned out great! I also used a chuck roast because that's what they had on sale. Toasted some hoagie rolls and added the onions from the crock pot and melted provolone cheese under the broiler. Dipped in the au jus, of course! :-) I will definitely be making this again.

This was good....I used the roast it called for very leary b/c it always turns out really dry.  I put it in my crockpot frozen & cooked it 2 hours less than stated & it was still dry.  I sliced it thin & put it back in the juices but that didn't help much.  I did fix a sandwich for my husband later & for me the next day & warmed up with some cheese melted over the top did make it more moist.  Next time I will use a chuck roast or at least one that isn't such a dry roast to begin with.  I did saute some mushrooms in the juice from the roast & they were EXCELLENT that way!  I will definitely be making this again but not with the suggested cut of meat. Thanks for a good one!

I made this today and was pleased, but not overwhelmed.  I did use a sirloin roast, put onion slices on the bottom, added garlic powder, salt, pepper and worcestershire sauce.  The meat turned out very tender but I felt like the taste was missing something and couldn't put my finger on it.

I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. The half star would be for the ease to make it. It is pretty tasty. Not, oh my god...this is the best but for what it is pretty darn good. I did put in beef consume instead of broth because I like the slightly thickened auju. I use another recipe from Rachel Ray that is over the stove that is better than this one, however, this doesn't have to be watched.

My family and I loved this recipe!  It's the fastes slow cooker recipe I know and it tastes awesome.  I made it once with beer and another without, and the beer seems to make the meat softer.  I also add garlic powder and sliced onions, and I slice the roast after it's done and toss it back in to make it extra soft and juicy.  I'm going to make it again today :)

Used 1 can of the french onion soup and subbed the plain beef broth with 1 can of beef consumme soup.  I also had an envelope of au jus so I threw that in too.  I left the butter out as well, didn't seem necessary.   Very good!

This was definitely very convenient and simple.  My boyfriend and I both liked it.  The sandwich was perfect, but the au jus sauce lacked complexity and just didn't compare with that I've had in restaurants.  However, I'm willing to make the sacrifice considering how easy and economical this version is.  Thanks lonwolf32:)

Very easy and very good.  I used sirloin tip per another suggestion.   The only extra spices I added were garlic powder and pepper.  When I went to go shred/slice the meat 7 hours later it fell apart with the touch of the fork.  Served on rolls with cheese and ghardinerra.

The good thing about this recipe is that it makes an au jus sauce like a french dip. I also never heat baked rolls before to use them for a sandwich, and that was a good idea.  However, the roast cooked in a liquid the thickness of water and the meat shredded when done instead of slicing.  In addition, the flavor of the meat was no different than when I cook a pot roast.  I was hoping the liquid would season the meat more than the beef in a pot roast, which usually needs gravy.  I might try next time just making au jus dip on the stove and then using a different more flavorful and sliceable roast beef recipe dry roasted in the oven.

I have made this several times and each time it's great.  One of my husbands favorite.  I like to add provolone cheese to the sandwich and put under the broiler for a minute to melt.  Yummy.

The meat was not tender at all.  The slow cooker method didn't work for my family.  The sauce was good though. Next time I will oven cook a roast and make the sauce separately.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, all I added was black pepper, garlic, and a quartered onion. After taking out the meat, I strained the juice, and put it back in the crockpot with the sliced beef. I let this sit just long enough to toast the bread. Topped with pepperjack cheese!  Yummy!!!

The kids and my wife loved it.    I added a teaspoon of garlic, about 2 oz of worstershire and pinot grigio wine instead of beer.  The dip was sweet, rich and complex.   I followed one of the other posts and cut the meat 30 mins before and put it back in the juice to stew a little longer.  My family wants me to make it every other week.

This recipe was great, my family loved it. I followed the advice of others though and used a sirloin tip roast and added provolone cheese to the top and broiled for a few minutes to melt the cheese. We will be making these again, thanks.

The smell of this cooking was so incredibly amazing, I could not stop picking at it throughout the day.  I used two chuck steaks that I seared first before putting in the slow cooker; I think the bones and extra fat of the chuck steak gave it delicious extra flavor that you wouldn't necessarily see with a roast.  I will definitely use this recipe again as a base for other meals (beef stroganoff, rouladen, etc).

Wow!  This was really delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.  I only did a couple of things different: I used two cans total of double strength beef broth (one of the cans was instead of the beer) and added some minced garlic.  Tasty :)

Great classic recipe.  Will use it often.  Did not think the beer was too strong, could not even taste it.  Added a little garlic powder, that's it!

This was so easy.  Used a chuck roast as that is all that I had on hand.  Everything else as stated.  I did add a few canned jalapenoes to DH's sandwich and used the provolone cheese.  I put the cheese on each side of a sourdough hoagie bun and placed them under the broiler until the cheese melted and the bread had a little "crunch" to it.  This acted like a "glue" and the sandwich did not fall apart.  Will be making this one over and over.  :)

I used Chuck Roast (more tender) for this and bought a "Chef's Choice" Meat Slicer and it was incredible!  Better than eating out anywhere!  I did use the hoagie size hard rolls and added Baby Swiss.  FANTASTIC!

This was so good and so easy to make.  I doubled the low-sodium broth and used a dark beer.  You couldn't taste the beer but the roast was very tender!  Thanks for the great new recipe!

Don't change anything other than maybe add a little extra salt, garlic powder, and onions to the broth.  The rump roast turns out so tender and delicious!  I served this on homemade bread (Artisan Bread in Five Minutes batard) with slices of melted provolone and sauteed bell peppers.  You can also reduce the au jus for a more intense flavor.  It's SO good!

Tasted amazing.  I do suggest putting the meat back in the juice for about 15 min after it is sliced.  A slice of provolone cheese goes  great on it too

Oooh man...this is so easy and good! We omitted the bear, and I upped the beef broth instead. Had a great flavor. A couple minutes in the morning to get the ingredients in the crockpot, and a fantastic outcome. Cant beat that!

I started making this a few years ago and it is now a family staple.  We spray the rolls with olive oil and then sprinkle minced garlic over that.  Broil the buns until they're toasted.  Then, I slice the beef and add it to one half of the bun, placed sliced swiss cheese over it, and put it back under the broiler until the cheese bubbles a little.  Take it out of the oven and add the other half of the bun and voila!

This turned out great and my husband loved it. I served it on hearty rolls and melted some provolone on them under the broiler. Served with the juice. This recipe is a keeper and made plenty to last a few days. Would also freeze the leftovers well. I used a darker beer as well.

This is quick and easy, but the "au jus" tends to be fatty.  I would recommend making it ahead and skimming the fat off or using a fat separator.

We really love French Dip and this is very perfect for us. I found the beer taste a bit strong so will be using half that next time. I used the leftovers to make beef barely soup, it was amazing!!

This recipe is great! I went to the meat counter in the grocery store to ask where I could find a "rump roast" and the butcher said that bottom roast is bascially the same. He said that "rump roast" is an older term for a cheaper cut of meat they would tie up with a bunch of seasonings inside, but that they rarely sell those anymore and a bottom roast seasoned properly would produce the same results if not better. So i used this recipe on a 3.5 lb bottom roast.  Followed the recipe exactly after I flipped the roast 1/2 way through the cooking time, i realized the juice wasn't quite salty enough for our taste so I just added a little seasoned salt, garlic peper & garlic salt. finished cooking and it came out amazing!  Everyone loved it, and wanted seconds! The extra seasoning was the only thing I changed. I used a budweiser can of beer, but i think any beer would be fine, perhaps staying away from a light beer. The beer and onion flavors mixed so nice together, I was so incredibly surprised how good this was because it was Sooooo easy! Definetly a keeper!

Awesome.  The beer gives it a nice flavor and it leaves you wondering, what is that?  I followed this recipe to a T for preparing the beef and see no reason to change it.  I used kaiser rolls, butter some and for a slight twist I put mayo and garlic salt on others and toasted in the oven on the broiler.  I also topped mine (the mayo garlic salt kaiser) with swiss cheese.  Very Good!  This is a great sandwich, beats a cold lunchmeat one any day.

This is fast becoming a family favorite, and easily my most shared recipe.  It is so easy and just great.  I serve the meat on whole wheat hamburger buns from the bakery of my local supermarket.  I slice the buns open and bake them on a cookie sheet face up at 350 for about 5 minutes.  Give it a try, you will be happy you did.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  I cooked according to directions and it came out great.  I butter the rolls, toast them, add provolone cheese then melt under the broiler.  The kids love it because the rolls keep a little bit of the toasty crunch even after dipping in the sauce.

I have made pot roast 100+ times but this is by far the best way to make it! The sauce is perfect and everyone including guests raved about this. We used fresh sausage rolls and topped with swiss cheese. I love a dish that is super simple yet tastes like it took a lot of preparation!

I made this for dinner and it was wonderful.  I was out of beer (don't know how THAT happened) so I used red wine instead.  The meat was VERY tender and delicious!  I will make it again using beer to get that more authentic Au Jus flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful dinner!  I did not have any condensed French onion soup so I used this all recipes recipe (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Rich-and-Simple-French-Onion-Soup/Detail.aspx) I omitted the beef broth and just used 21 fluid oz of the soup i made.  The whole family loved it!  Will surely make again!

Very good, but something about the canned soup gives it a weird taste.  Maybe next time I will use powder or home made.

This is an awesome recipe!  I did add 1 tablespoon of granulated garlic and worchestershire sauce to it though.  And I used a half of a bottle of Fat Tire Beer and it turned out "perfect".  Thanks so much for sharing it with all of us.

I wanted this to be great based on the reviews.  To us, it just tasted like pot roast.  My meat fell apart completely and was moist, but it was bland and very plain.  The au jus was okay, but overall I was disappointed.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I found the au jus to be very bland when prepared as directed.  However, after adding a few things it came out almost perfect.  I added a few cloves of chopped garlic as well as a dash of garlic powder, a couple dashes or worcestershire sauce, some beef boullion flavoring, and some thyme.  Other changes I made were to use a dark beer, and yes the whole bottle... I can always taste beer in a recipe but I honestly could not in this one.  I did attempt to stir out most of the carbonation at the end though.  I also peppered and seared the roast prior to placing in it the crock pot.  I had no problem slicing it as some people had mentioned.  It did seem dry as I was slicing, but was fine after being replaced into the au just for another 30 or 45 minutes.  I also chose to broil the bread with swiss cheese, and added sauteed green peppers and onions.  The only changes I would make next time would be to cook it low and slow... I cooked it on a higher heat for 5 to 6 hours this time.  Also, I may try beef consomme as some of you mentioned you did.  Or, I would prepare as I did this time but would get low sodium broth since I would be adding the beef boullion.  Provolone cheese would also be a better choice as it is fuller flavored.  Overall though, very good recipe... my fiance loved it and that says a lot...

We put this in the crock pot for 9 hours and it fell apart it was so tender.  The meat is delicious!  I used a light beer and will not do that next time.  It needs a lager or guinness I think, for more flavor for the au jus.  I would also add more garlic.  This will definitely become a regular in my household

The recipe is pretty easy and it's a might tasty...if you've never tried drinking beer.  Beer drinkers beware, because every bite I took gave thoughts of beer instead of a French Dip sandwich.    The kids liked it, but weren't crazy about it.  Sure, I'll be making it again and like most reviewers, I'll be transforming it into a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  Next time we're gonna give it a go with a red or rose wine instead of beer.

EDIT 2016 I am still making this and it is still outstanding when I make it with a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale.  A can of french onion.  A tablespoon of McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning (low sodium).  A good tablespoon of garlic.  and then I use maybe a teaspoon and a half of better than boullion beef broth in a cup of hot water.  My family DEVOURS this.
From 2009 Only made a few changes.  Added garlic and worcestershire sauce.  That didnt quite do it so I added some steak seasoning and that did the trick.  Sliced the meat up and then put it back in for about an hour.  Also made French Bread Rolls to die for from this site but made them big enough for sandwich buns.  turned out very very good and will make again.

I halved the recipe and it made for a delicious dinner and leftovers.  The french dip sauce isn't like restaurants but it is still tasty but I will probably try another recipe next time.

Delicious! I made it as per the directions and it turned out wonderfully! Most and flavorful. I was a bit nervous about the beer, but the alcohol cooked out and the beer flavor complimented the heartiness of the meat.

This was outstanding!  I did add some garlic powder.  I also added some sliced mushrooms and sliced onions.  When serving, I placed some provolone on top and broiled the sandwiches unitl the cheese was bubbling and browned. Yum!

Love this recipe.  I typically slice the meat and place it back in the sauce so it can absorb more of the liquid allowing it to become very moist.   Always a hit and great for a crowd.

Very easy and delicious!  Tried some of the different variations, but the easiest is to follow the recipe and it turns out great.  The only adjustments that seem to work with our family is I use the chuck roast and a darker beer. The meat just falls apart! My husband can not get enough of this dish. I can't think of anything easier to make.

This was so tasty. My husband said it was the best french dip he has very had. You have to try it, I will make this for guests instead of the old stand by.

I'm giving this 4 stars b/c it's easy and turned out very tasty! The au jus was great- not too salty. I followed the basic recipe, and added 1.5 tbsp worchestershire sauce as suggested below and some fresh ground pepper to the meat. So tender! With just me and the hubby, we're looking forward to all the leftovers.

OMG, this is deeeelish! My hubby loved it too. This will be added to our fall/winter rotation. I used a chuck roast & it was great, tender & full of flavor. I did add garlic powder just because I like garlic in everything. I didn't have a dark beer so I used an lager that we had in the fridge. I will try Guiness next time. Im useing the leftovers this weekend for a quick pot roast! YUM

So good.. so easy.  I make this often, and the only change I make is to melt some swiss or provolone cheese on top of the rolls in the oven.  I usually use Bud Light beer.  This recipe's a keeper!  Try it!

This was delish!  I followed some of the suggestions in previous raters.  I used a serloin tip.  I used a can of Campbells Consomme and a can of French Onion soup and a dark mexican beer.  I seasoned the roast with garlic powder, paprika, and pepper and added just a little worchestershire sauce.  For two people, I used a 2 pound roast and there is plenty left over for tonight and french onion soup tomorrow.  This is the best recipe I have found on this site!!

The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because the meat was actually edible.  But this recipe was tasteless.  I am going to put it back in the crock tonight with potatoes and carrots.

OH MY GOSH!!!! Absolutely delicious!  My 5 year old will eat hardly anything for dinner and gobbled this up and said that Mommy was a good cook (the sign of a really good recipe).  I added Guinness, Montreal Steak Seasoning and a few dashes of Worstershire Sauce per others suggestions.  A definite keeper.

Definitely a keeper!  I added a dash of worchestshire sauce, along with some steak seasoning.  Great flavor, and I will be making this again.  It makes a lot, so next time I'll probably do it when we have company.  It's pretty filling, especially when you have it on a hearty bread, so in our house, we got a lot of mileage out of it.

We thought this was really good. We followed the recipe exactly since it was our first time making any kind of french dip. It made quite a bit for just us two, definitely had leftovers for another nights dinner. The only changes we would make next time is to add some more spices, and to add some fresh onions to give it more of that onion taste. Very versitile recipe.

Unreal!!!!  This is a top notch dinner and so easy you feel like your cheating.  I couldn't find french onion soup for the life of me, so I used a french onion soup dip packet and thought it would add more flavor then the soup anyways, and it does.  I added garlic as well.  The beer is what makes it super tender and melt in your mouth good... so don't shy away from it.  You don't taste it at all.  Remember to use the yummy left over juice in your crock pot as your dipping sauce.  I never start in time to do a 7 hour anything... So I put it on High for 5 hours and it was just as good.  This will be a recipe that you use over and over and over again... TRUST ME, ITS THAT GOOD!

This was okay. The sauce was pretty good and the meat was tender but I wasn't overly impressed. The addition of cheese to the sandwich was my favorite part. It didn't go over with the family very well...

This is an excellent recipe!  We LOVED it!  I used a 2 lb rump roast since I was making it for only 2  people and had plenty of left overs for lunch the next day.  If possible, it was even better the next day! I served it on toasted french rolls with provolone cheese with a sliced dill pickle on the side (like many restaurants do).  Scrumptious! Thank you so much, lonwolf32, for sharing such a fantastic recipe for all of us to enjoy!  You Rock!

I was so excited to have this when i got home from work.  I followed this recipe to the letter, and I am not thoroughly impressed.    Maybe it was the type of beer i used, but this just did not please the palate at all.  I cooked on low for 8+ hours, the meat fell apart tender.  I did make some modifications.  I used minced onion and a few cloves of garlic, but that wasn't enough to save this.  I won't make again.

Add onion powder, garlic powder, use Campbell's Consomme, slice meat .5 hr before meal and place back in juices.  Good with cheese.

This is the first recipe I made after receiving my slow cooker from my mother two years ago, and I have made it many times. My local grocer hardly ever has rump roast, so I purchase a top or bottom round. No difference in quality. I always use a darker beer, usually Shiner Bock or Guinness. Rarely do I make any modifications. My husband and I adore this recipe. Hats off to the originator!

I really enjoyed this dish. I used sirloin tips as that's all I could get, and it came out very tender, and flavorful. I used Budweiser, and it gave it almost a sweet flavor, so next time I will use a "heavier" beer. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times already and just forgotten to rate it. This is a wonderful recipe. About 3 hours before I want to serve this, I thinly slice it and place it back into the slow cooker. This is a hit whereever I serve it. Yum!

Very good!  Took advice of others, put shredded roast back into cooker for half hour.  Also cover in mozz cheese under broiler, toasts rolls really nice and cheese is to die for!  The juice is the best dipping sauce i have ever had and so easy nothing compares!

My family loved this!  I did sub the consomme for the beef broth and I think it gave it a richer flavor.  I also left out the beer (drank it all the night before oops!) and I think it was great even without it.  I also followed others advice and added the onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, rosemary, worcestershire, soy sauce.  I think it would have been a little bland without it.  I also added provolone cheese to the subs when assembling.  This one is a keeper!

Wonderful!  I just added garlic, pepper and a little bit of steak sauce.  I also sauteed mushrooms to go on ours.  My kids absolutely loved this.  Thanks!

Good, but not phenomenal. The flavor was a bit off. I think I'll add less beer next time.

We made two roasts for our daughers' birthday party.  We cooked them, sliced the roasts thin, put the meat back in the juice and refrigerated the meat and juice the day before the party.  The day of the party we put the meat and juice back in the crockpot on low until the party started.  We had rolls and shredded mozzarella cheese set out with the meat and the sandwiches were a HUGE hit.  Will definitely be making again and again.

All the reviewers are right - this is AMAZING!!!  I used 6-7 lb chuck roast (seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper), 2 cans of soup, 2 cans of broth, and 1 bottle of very good dark beer.  We used the leftover juices for gravy over meatballs a few days later - YUMMMMMM!!!!!!

We have made this a few times the meat usually comes out dry. Now we slice it and put it back in the crock pot for about a half hour to absorb the juices. We add swiss cheese.

This is a favorite that I am always asked for the recipe..  Make sure to use Condensed french onion soup.  I always use the au-jus packet, which was recommended by another reviewer.  Other than that the recipe is perfect!

What was I thinking?  I am not new to AR...why didn't I read the reviews to this!!!  DEFINITELY read the reviews!  This is a good recipe but needs some flavoring.  My family enjoyed it the way it was, but next time I will follow the suggestions of those "most helpful" reviewers!

This is just ok as the recipe is written.  Definately needs some tweaking otherwise the meat doesn't have much flavor.

My family loves this! I only use a Pike's Peak Roast which comes out very lean. I don't use the juice from the crock pot - use instead, a pack of Au Jus mix on the spice aisle. We like to toast our rolls under the broiler and add green chili & provolone to the rolls for a New Mexican French Dip!

This was really good, and after making it plenty of times now I prefer to use chuck steaks and trim all the fat off.   Also, it definitely needs spices added.  I used Dried MInced onion, onion and garlic powder and even some garlic salt and table salt / pepper blend.  I added a little spices then let it cook and then adjusted for flavor with about an hour left to cook.  Definitely serve on fresh hoagie rolls so they soak up all the juices!

I loved it!  I am very picky about my french dips and this was great.  I followed the advice to add a bit of worchestire and some fresh garlic and spices.  I sliced it thin and then let it cook some more to soak up all the juice.  I sauteed some mushrooms separately and added those with mozzarella in the french bread.  Yum!

Not a bad recipe but you need to add some spices! I added garlic and pepper and that added some good flavor.  Also, like others, I would recommend a darker beer.  I used a ligther beer since that was all I had and I definitely regret not going out to get a 6 pack of some good dark beer to add in.

I added a few more seasonings based on the reviews. I did not put so much beer in, and I am very grateful. A fourth of a cup was really all it needed. I added about a can and a half of lower sodium beef broth, a tablespoon of Worcestershire, a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, and Italian seasonings. I also added about a half packet of onion soup mix. While this was good, I would not say it was outstanding. I would make it again, but eat it as a roast instead of on sandwiches.

This dish was a hit at my house. I also added more seasoning of Garlic Salt, Garlic powder, salt and pepper. I seared the roast before putting it in the mixture to help with the fat. I added a can of golden mushroom soup, then I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions to put on top of the roast after placing it on the toasted bun.  This will be a new family favorite around here.  Thanks for sharing it.

This tasted awesome! I added crushed garlic to this recipe. Served this for a bunco get together and had a few ask about the recipe at the "next" bunco. I served it with french bread rolls. For the left overs, I used it the next day over toast bread. And another time I used the left overs along with garlic mashed potatoes and a side of green beans. YUMMY! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I forgot to turn my crock pot off, but good news, you can't cook it to long.  I'm going to use the gravy as a base for Christmas mushroom gravy.  The butcher told me the best roast for slow cooking is a center cut chuck roast.

This recipe was amazing.  I made it the day before (I let it cook on low for 9 hours instead of 7), sliced it, and put it in a 9x13 dish with the juice.  The next evening I just popped it in the oven for a bit when we got home.  I have gotten so many compliments on this dish.  The rolls suggested with this are really good too but the dish is just as good if you don't have time to toast the rolls.

Wow! That sums it up.  I added a few more ingredients to this recipe.  I added 1 pkg of onion soup mix and 1 tsp of worchestershire.  I also used Guiness as the beer, and it really just came out amazingly good.

My husband really loved this. Like everyone else I added Garlic Salt. Also Seven Hours is not enough time. You really need 9 hours. If you want really tender meat. But otherwise Delicious.Also I added Provolone to bread. Really Good.

My husband enjoyed this more than I did. I thought it was bland - missing something. I browned the meat and seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, and seasoned salt before putting into the crockpot, but still something was missing. Good starter recipe I guess, just needs tweaking with to find the right flavor.

Holly Shmolly this was good!!  I am not a big beef eater, but I do like the occasional french dip.  I've never tried to make it before and now I would say this is one of my favorite foods.  Both my 7 and my 3 year old cleaned their plate.  They LOVED it!  I followed recipe exact except I sliced my meat an hour before serving and I used a sirloin top roast.

My college student son made this at school, then fixed for us at home.  Delicious!  For leftovers I thickened the broth, cut up the leftover meat, then served it over noodles.  I may have liked that even better!

I've made this several times and everyone who has tasted it, has raved!  I cook as directed but after toasting the rolls under the broiler, I add the meat and some swiss cheese and put it under the broiler again until the cheese is melted.  We top them with creamy horseradish sauce and then dive in.  Yummy!!!

Really good.  The au jus was awesome and went perfect with the sandwich.  I also made a horseradish sauce to go with it.  Also sauteed some mushrooms and added them to the sandwich while baking.  YUM!

My husband LOVED this recipe!  I browned the roasted before I added it to the crock pot and added rosemary, garlic, worcestershire, soy sauce and a can of button mushrooms. I used Guiness beer.   It was fabulous, meat cooked perfectly and was so tender, I didn't even need to slice, it just fell apart.  I will definitely be adding this to my favorites.

This was fantastic! Slight variations from the recipe..* Used 5lb. rump roast trimmed all fat and rubbed generously w/ pepper and garlic granules. * 6oz. Newcastle Brn. Ale/6 oz. beef stock * Substitu te 1 can beef consomme' for beef broth. *2 tsp. worchestire. * Cooked on low 8 hrs, sliced meat & returned to low for 1 more hour. *Packaged Au Jus prepared seperately(for the dipping sauce)using 1 cup beef stock/2cups water because that gave us the more traditional "dip flavor" we love. Melted provolone on top. Just like the real thing :)

I can't believe I waited so long to try this recipe! Excellent recipe, I used a light beer, but will make sure to use a darker one next time.  Added a TBSP of garlic and Worchestire.

This recipe is awesome! I made this yesterday for the second time and the only thing I did differently was topped with provolone cheese and broiled until toasty brown! I also mixed some sour cream and horseradish as a dip! Yum! I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This made for absolutely delicous sandwiches!  Make sure you use a flavorful beer.  I used Newcastle and it made for some wonderful broth.  Additionally, when you get to leftovers the next day, theyre ever better!  Truly a 5 star recipe.

The flavor of this sandwich was amazing, and it was really easy to prepare!  I added a few pieces of cheese to the sandwich right before serving, and it really made them rich and amazing.  My only problem with this recipe is the cost..  Even though it's under budget cooking, the meat to make this recipe alone was almost $20!  You can't blame the recipe, but this is going in my "special sunday dinner" file ;)

Tasted great, but I was expecting a different flavor from the dipping sauce. A more "classic" au jus taste (kind of like the seasoning packets from the grocery store)would probably include some soy and worchestershire sauce, as well as some garlic. I'll try adding those next time. Thanks for a good base recipe!

This was a really great recipe. I prepared the meat the night before. I didn't have the onion soup mix, typically try to stay from the powdered mix because many contain MSG. Instead I sliced a whole onion and sauteed the onion with a few sliced garlic cloves in olive oil just until translucent. Place the prepared onion and garlic in the bottom of the slow cooker. I placed my frozen, yes frozen, roast on top. Sprinkle with dried oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper. Add a liberal amount of Worcestershire sauce(three to four good shakes) and about 1/4 cup soy sauce. Cover the roast with canned beef stock and set on low. My whole house smelled like a Sunday pot roast. When I woke the next morning, the roast was completely cooked to the point of falling apart. I gently shredded the meat, leaving it in the juices all day until serving time(my slow cooker has a 'warm' setting). We served the meat on toasted whole wheat hoagie rolls. 

I used the left over meat to make a tasty Shepherds Pie the next night. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I served these on homeade french rolls with mashed potatos and a salad. Everyone seemed to like them. I used a sirloin tip roast. I had to use light beer because it was all we had. Next time I will try it with regular.

My Fiancee and I love this recipe!! As we are teetotalers I use an extra cup of beef broth, and substitute Apple juice for the beer. I also add a large clove of garlic for that little extra kick...
For the buns, I use fresh garlic butter and Swiss Cheese on the buns while toasting it...This is a must have recipe when we have the gang over to watch wrestling. Always a hit!

This was just okay, not bad, but not outstanding.  The juice was pretty good, however, the roast fell apart.  I couldn't cut it into slices.

My Husband devoured these sandwiches! Going off of other reviews I used consomme instead of broth, added black pepper and minced garlic. I also chopped up some celery to cook in the sauce as well. Used sliced Mozzarella, broiled in oven and served with mashed potato!!  This will be a regular in my house!

Amazing! I  serve on buttered sourdough with provolone cheese that I toast in the toaster oven until the cheese melts a little. I also add a little salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder but I'm not sure thats necessary. My husband LOVES this. Important: cook on low for at least 8 hours and like other reviewers said cut up the beef and return it to the juice 1/2 -1 hr before serving.

These are SO good, and so easy! I used a rump roast. It was too hard to trim the fat before cooking, so I waited until after and it came right off. I sliced it with an electric knife and returned it to the juices for about 30 minutes. I used fresh vienna rolls frm the bakery, and I followed the recipe and put butter and provolone on them. Then I put them under the broiler for a couple minutes. These were a hit in my house-I will be making them again and again!

Wow! I used a 2 lb sirloin roast and when I cut it after 4 hrs, it was difficult to cut and not very tasty, didnt think I would like it at all. Then, I let it sit another 2 hrs in the crock pot, toasted the hoagies on the inside, topped with mozzerella and it was s SO good!! Then I heated leftovers in a saucepan the next night, added caramelized onions and mozz. OMG it was even better... so tender, it melted in my mouth and I would never have thought I was eating roast beef!! I will be making this much more often. (And I am not even a beef sandwhich fan!)

I made this recipe exactly as stated and I'm surprised it received such high ratings.  It was just very, very bland.  We added seasonings halfway through eating.  I'm deleting this one from my recipe box because a recipe is really not needed to dump a roast and broth into a crockpot.  After that part, it's just a matter of "winging it" with the seasonings.

I am making this recipe for the 2nd time in about 2 weeks.  I cant say enough about it.  I cut the meat into slices and then cook a little longer.  It adds more flavor I think.  I also added garlic salt and ground pepper.  My family could probably eat these a couple times a week.  My son even loves this sandwich and he never likes to try anything new. Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!  It is definately a keeper.  YUM!

I accidentally used a pot roast which added more work in removing the fat and cutting the meat because it was a little tough, but GREAT flavor!  Made sandwiches with provolone and grilled onions.

My husband gave it 5 stars, I give it 4. It got a little dry but the flavor was very good. I did take some suggestions and added minced garlic and black pepper. It paired well with the Crispy Potato Wedges from this site. **UPDATE** I made this a second time and cooked it for 8-9 hours...turned out much better. It's getting added to the rotation to make 1-2x/month.

This is the best and easy recipe to make!!!  It takes only 5 mins prep time and you get wonderful sandwich meat to make your family members so happy.  Especially, if those family members are teenage boys.

I made just a few changes based on the reviews.  I used Campbell's Consomme, Campbell's French Onion Soup, garlic powder, onion powder, worcestershire sauce, a little salt and black pepper.  Otherwise I stuck to recipe.  The meet was very tender.  I did cut it and let it sit in the sauce for about 1 hour before eating it.  Great and easy recipe!  Thanks!

This is so easy and so good.  The fat on the rump roast  gives the juice a really good flavor.  Splurge and don't skim off the fat.  I sliced my beef thin with a meat slicer and  topped with sweet onion and a slice of provolone cheese. Then put it under the broiler just till the cheese melted.   I used a  good sub bun.   With the leftover's, I froze in a plastic container and when it was froze solid, I removed from container and vacuum packed it with my Food Saver.   Now when I'm lazy all I have to do is thaw it out in the  Microwave. I am really looking forward to having it again.  My husband said I should  always make my rump roast like this. He couldn't stop raving about it.

After I made this I was surprised at the high rating it received.  It's not a BAD recipe, but really nothing special either.  The meat was tender from the slow cooking, but the flavor was pretty mild, not tasting like a whole lot of anything.  I did follow one other reviewer's advice and used the extra broth to make French onion soup.  I added caramelized onions to it (about 2 onions worth)and melted the cheese on top and it was pretty good.

Beef was not tender, so as suggested, sliced and put back in the juices, and cooked another 1.5 to 2 hours.  Then it was really good.

I made these for a superbowl party and everyone raved! The ultimate compliment was my sister (who was not at the party) calling me the next day asking for the recipe because my Dad raved about how great they were. Like other reviewers, I added an extra can of beef broth and some Worstershire and garlic powder. I put some of the au jus on the french rolls prior to serving. Be sure to get the crusty type french rolls rather than really doughy type. Makes a huge difference.

I love this recipe for its simplicity and small shopping list. It's so much better than buying deli meat and a packet of au jus. You can really play with the flavor depending on what kind of beer you use. We like Irish stout in this one (and one on the side!)

Quick, easy, and yummy. My kind of meal. Well, let me rephrase the quick part...the preparation is quick, but the cooking is slow...which isn't a bad thing. The slow cooking makes the meat nice and tendar. 
The only thing I did differently is I chopped up an onion and added it to the broth, added a bit of water so the meat was completely covered, then added some beef bouillon, added a little bit of garlic powder, and a bit of worceshtershire (I can never spell that darn word).

Everyone LOVED it!

I really thought this was fantastic and super easy. I used a 3.5 lb bottom round roast, 1 12oz can of beef broth, 1 packet of French Onion soup mix mixed with 10oz of water and a corona lite. :-) This was so delicious. I turned it every so often since the liquid didnt cover. Used english muffins with a little melted Provolone, no butter. Excellent easy week night meal. I'm looking foward to tonights left overs.

Next time would make broth into gravy and serve as hot roast beef sandwiches.  Very tender, able to just pull meat apart with fork.  I would also salt and pepper roast before placing in crosck pot.

I liked this recipe, though it wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped. If you didn't actually dip the sandwich it was plain but with the dip it was really good. I might also try a coke instead of a beer because I thought it was a bit strong.

The second time I made this recipe, I cut the amount of beer to a half can...tasted much better.  I put a frozen roast in the slow cooker before work, added the ingredients, and set on low...when I came home after work, we had a fast, tasty, and easy meal waiting for us!  This one is a favourite!

These are so tasty!! Made them twice already and followed recipe as is.  Used ciabatta rolls since I like that texture more.  Will make again and again. Quick easy and delicious.  Great with oven baked fries.

This recipe is excellent! The meat was so tender I couldn't even slice it - it just fell apart. 

After reading the reviews, I decided to try this with the rump roast (instead of chuck roast) recommended in the original recipe. I had no problems with it being too fatty. To enhance flavor, I sprinkled the roast with salt and pepper and then browned it on sides in a skillet. I then deglazed the skillet with the beer and scraped up the brown "flavor bits" with a wooden spoon, added the beef broth, and once it was warm poured it all over the browned roast in the crock pot. I put in the condensed soup and eight hours later, everyone was raving. Plus, the house smelled great all day! This is definitely my new favorite for crock-pot french dip.

This was really good.  I added a little garlic and another can of beef broth, but otherwise was easy and very yummy.  Instead of buying rolls, I made them from the recipe "French Bread Rolls to Die For" from this website.

My husband and I absolutely loved it. I left out the beer and seasoned the meat before, added 1/2 of a coarsely chopped onion, and 1/2 cup of worcestshire. The dip was still a little too light for my taste so next time I think I will use 2 cans of the condensed soup.

These were VERY good...I was pleasantly surprised.  Here is what I did:  I made this with a 3 lb Rump Roast & cooked the roast for 5 hours, removed it from the crock pot & let it rest for about 20 minutes.  I then sliced it..when I was slicing it, it seemed kind of dry, so if it seems that way when slicing it, don't worry. I then returned the slices to the liquid in the crock pot for about 1 hour.  To prepare the sandwiches, I cut the french rolls in half & put butter on each side.  Then, I added beef to one side & put cheese on top of it...I actually used Pepper Jack & it was yummy.  I then put the sandwiches (open faced) in an oven pre-heated to 375 just until the cheese melted.  The rolls got a little toasted, but not too much.  This is the best crock pot recipe I have ever made!

This was excellent - and so easy to prepare!  Agree with other users to warm, not toast, the rolls...mine ended up pretty crunchy.  Next time I'll slice the meat and return to the juice for awhile longer as was suggested by others.  I used Michelob Ultra (not amber) and couldn't taste it at all after about 7 hours in the crock pot.  Hubby gave this recipe two thumbs up, so it's a keeper for sure!

I made this today and it was wonderful.  I am not a big roast (of any kind) fan but this was so tender and tasty.  I used a chuck rib roast at the suggestion of the butcher at the store and I'm so glad I did.  It cooked for 7 1/2 hours and was the best I had ever had and the family loved it.  Followed some other suggestions and added some garlic and worchestershire sauce.  Would definetly make again.  Thanks!

Very good recipe although I will try it with another cut of beef to make it more like the french dip sandwich I love at our favorite restaurant.Also I'll melt provolone cheese on the bread. Great au jus!! LOVED the beer (even cheap Miller).Thanks for the recipe!

I used a pork roast instead of beef and it was quite yummy.  I didn't have canned beef broth, so I used bouillon 2 cubes instead and used 2 bottles of dark beer to make up for the loss of liquid.  I cooked it approx. 9 hours, and after about 7 hours, I shredded the meat with a fork and returned it to the crock pot.  I served it with rolls, mashed potatoes and macaroni-and-cheese.  Yum!

This recipe was good.  But I like a different kind of meat on my French dips.  This was more like a pot roast sandwich, which wasn't bad, but not what I wanted.  My husband LOVED it!

Oh yea! I agree with the one that says if you could give it 10 stars I would! I used a rump roast from our quarter of beef we have. I'm sure 90% of this recipe depends on the quality of the beef you use. This one turned out SO PERFECT! There was not a single bit of toughness to this meat, it practically melted in my mouth it was so tender. My husband goes down in the books as the pickiest eater. He said this was "by far the best french dip" he has ever had! I seasoned the beef with some garlic powder and black pepper. Next time I will add a touch of salt. I followed everyone elses advice and put the cheese and butter on the buns and toasting them. This recipie was SO easy and convienient it may just have to become a weekly thing at our house this winter! Also, it is such a versitile recipe as far as the left overs go. Tonight I will be using the beef and some of the sauce to make a beef stroganoff! Thank you for the recipe!

This was so wonderful!  I can stop my search for the perfect frech dip recipe!  AND it was so easy.  I did season the meat with garlic powder and season salt and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix.

I used a light beer, next time I may use something darker and add lettuce and tomato to the sandwich.

Huge hit with the family.

I hate to say this, but I was disappointed with this recipe.  I wanted so badly for it to be everything that all the ratings said.  Perhaps it's just my experience, but the beer was just too overpowering.

I used the leftovers to make a Beefy French Onion Soup last night.  I added a can of condensed French Onion soup to the broth and re-heated on the stovetop.  I skimmed of the layer of fat that had collected on the top before heating.  While the soup heated I placed a slice of French bread in the bowls ladled the heated soup over the top then topped with slices of Munster cheese.  I placed the bowls under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly and browned along the edges.  My son thought it was just OK but my husband and I loved it!  He says that I'm very sneaky using leftovers, but he did like what I transformed the French Dip sandwiches into.  So the nice thing is that I got two totatlly different meals out of one recipe.  Gotta love that.

I thought this came out pretty good following the recipe...however, hubby found the meat to be somewhat bland. Used 'Labatts Blue Light' for the beer, perhaps will try again with a darker beer.

I was happy with the result of this recipe (even though I didn't have any beer to use in the cooking liquid). I was concerned because some reviewers said it tasted like pot roast and I definitely didn't want pot roast! I used a sirloin tip and it wasn't "pot roasty" at all. I am sure that if you use chuck roast, you WILL get pot roast! DH liked it a lot, he doesn't like deli roast beef for French dip, so this is great. Was making this off the pantry shelf, so I used canned beef broth, dry Lipton onion soup (which I won't do again, it has a bitter overbearing taste!) and a package of au jus to make up for no beer. I'll buy the correct ingredients needed to try it per the recipe next time.

I love this recipe!  I found it on this site a few years ago and it has been an excellent work night meal ever since.  I have made it for company and have gotten rave reviews!  It is so easy and makes great leftovers.  I make it exactly the way the recipe calls for and it's perfect.  We usually put a little ranch dressing on our rolls and enjoy!!

This is SO delicious!  I used a sirloin tip roast, seasoned it with garlic powder and pepper, used a full-bodied beer and strained out the onions from the soup.  It does not need any salt – there’s enough in the broth and soup.  About 30 minutes before it was done, sliced thinly and returned to au jus to finish.  I used hoagie rolls, covered top half with provolone slices (no butter) and toasted under the broiler.  Added the beef and stacked it all together.  Tender and plenty of flavor – after trying several other French dip recipes, my boyfriend said this one was a keeper!

I did not care for this very much.  I prefer to still get my French dip from the local sandwich shop.  My family did not care for it much either but I will used the left over meat with some additives and it might be good bc the meat is very tender.

This is unbelievable.  My husband says it is even better than restaurant made!  The leftover sauce can be made into french onion soup, the possibilities are endless.  It is definitely a keeper!! Thank you.

I used a 1/2 can of Guinness, Campbells French Onion soup and a 3 pound rump roast.  I cooked the roast for 7 hours, sliced the meat & put it back in for an hour.  This turned out excellent!  Very moist and juicy.  Hubby asked that next time I make this - I make a ton extra for lunches.

I love french dip sandwiches and variations of Philly melts and this recipe gives a good base for them.  I like to serve with sauteed onions and peppers and sometimes mushrooms on the side.

Delicious!  I had a roast a tad bigger than 3 lbs, so I added about a 1/4 c. more water.  It was perfect.  I was afraid that it would be too bland since you didn't season the roast itself in any way beforehand, but it wasn't.  It was great, very moist!  Thank you!

Not very impressive.  The beer was undetectable, and it was a little too liquid-y.  However, my boyfriend is definitely a "meat and potatoes" type guy and before I could even pop the rolls in the oven, he put the meat over garlic mashed and scarfed it down.  It was good like that, just needs more seasoning and flavor.  Cheap, easy, I'll play around with it and make it work.  :-)

I live in the mountains at 7000 feet and it usually takes longer to cook food.  However, this rump roast took three days to get tender!  (At night, I stored it in the fridge.) It fell apart instead of slicing nicely as I am used to.  Next time I'll use my favorite - a chuck roast.  The au jus was delicious, though.

Excellent! French dips are great for parties.My guests were happy to serve themselves and i got to relax and enjoy the game. i want to respond to the people who say the roast did not become tender. If it's not tender leave it on low until it becomes tender and i can't understand how the meat falling apart is a bad thing as someone said. I don't usually need to slice the meat for a good french dip. Good recipe!

After making this several times, we've still not been able to decide which the best cut of meat is for this dish. The rump roast left a lot of fat in the au jus. We've had good luck with a tri-tip. Also found that the cheaper and lighter the beer, the better. Recommend adding a powdered Au Jus mix (Lawry's or Schilling) to the liquid for added flavor.

This recipe is great as is or I add 1/4 cup of soy sauce for a little extra flavor. I slice it very thin and serve it on sliced portuguese rolls with melted swiss. Excellent dip sandwiches. My 7 & 4 year old kids love it.

To the person who rated this as 1 star.We obviously each have our own opinions so I respect the fact that you didn't like the french dip. However you must have had a bad cut of meat because I have made it twice, my mom has made it twice and my sister in law once and we have all had very tender beef. I added worchestire sauce. I like things with a lot of favour so I get you on that one, but I have made it with home made french onion soup (onions, one garlic clove, beef broth, worchesterchire, and pepper and that turned out well.

Try it that way. I pretty sure it was the meat you got from the butcher. I have had tough meat before. It would not have been your cooking method since slow cookers are reliable so that is all I can think of.

This is an amazing recipe.  My husband is a very picky eater and he said that I should make this one again and again!  He hates onions, but he didn't even notice they were there.  I made it exactly as it is written and I wouldn't change a thing.

This was excellent.  Didn't change a thing.  Used a heavier beer, Fat Tire.  Gives it a robust flavor. Family loved it, shared recipe with extended family. 12/20/08 update: Served at a family Xmas dinner this last weekend. They thought it was prime rib. Lots of compliments. I used two roast totalling about 6.5 to 7 lbs. 2 cans of each soup and one bottle of Budweiser in a very large crock pot. Any more wouldn't fit in crock pot.  Cooked all day on low. Served on Artisan buns from a local bakery. Very very good.

This was a very easy recipe that turned out great!  Everyone loved it.  I did season my roast with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting it in the crockpot, and I added a dash of Worchester Sauce to the liquid.  Also, since I don't care at all for the taste of beer, I substituted Ginger Ale.  I will be making this one again!  Thanks.

I thought this was quite good!  As others have said, couldn't find condensed onion soup so used a dry packet with a cup of water.  After adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder it had a nice flavor and I liked the addition of the beer, made it different from typical au jus, though it was not as rich as I'd like.  I will make this again.

Downright awesome French dip! I didn't have condensed soup so I used dry onion soup mix and water. I also added some pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and pepperocinis to the liquid. Yum! This is right up there in my top 5 slow cooker recipes!

Very great recipe. The meat was very tender when sliced properly. I wasn't sure we would like the beer in it, but it really added a lot of flavor. I used hard crusty rolls and they didn't fall apart when dipped. I will definately make this again, soon!

Wow  great recipe! I couldn't find a rump roast so I substituted two  2.5 lbs round roasts since I was having guests over.  I sprinkled the meat with garlic salt and then seared them in a little oil before putting in the crock pot.  Even though I had more meat than the recipe calls for, I still only used one can each of the soups and  one can of beer.  I did use one package of au jus and a few splashes of worstershire   sauce to taste.  My guests all liked it very much and asked for the recipe.  I feel like the dipping sauce was a little salty but still very good.  I may use garlic powder next time. The meat does get very tender so it makes sense to slice before it's done, but no one cared that the meat was more shredded than sliced.  It was a hit. Thanks I'll be making this one again.  UPDATE: 8/31/13 - used a 5 lb brisket and worked great, this time just used garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce on the meat before pouring the soups and beer!  Sliced it after about 8 hours and added it back to the juice.  SO GOOD!

This was soooo yummy!  I love french dip sandwiches.  I did add 1/4 c. italian seasoning and I didn't use canned soup because my son is allergic to soy.  I found a soy free broth and used it for the broth and the soup.  Added a clove of garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, and a dash or tow of worcestershire sauce.

Very good, first time I've ever made French Dips on my own, we really enjoyed these. I took another's advice and added into the crock at the beginning: dash of pepper, 2 cloves of garlic (minced), 1/2 tblspn onion powder, dash of worchestershire sauce. Next time I'll also add a package of au jus mix, might give it a stronger flavor. Will make again. thank you

This was FABULOUS and SUPER EASY.  I got held up at work so it was in the slow cooker for longer than 7 hours and it was still really tender.

I have been meaning to rate this recipe for over 2 years.  We LOVE these french dips.  They are very easy to make and we buy good hoagie buns and grill them before assembling the sandwiches.  We take these to family gatherings or just have them for dinner and they are always a hit.  I'm not a big sandwich person but I could live on these things!

Without a doubt a five star recipe!!!  I have made this numerous times and have not ONCE been disappointed!  My only tip would be to have your local butcher slice your roast to whatever thickness you like.  This saves time at the end of your workday when you just wanna have a nice warm meal and go to bed!!!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

I make this often.  It is so easy and always turns out perfectly!  The only change I make is to brown the roast before putting it in the crock pot.  My friend uses ginger ale instead of the beer and raves about it.

After reading so many reviews I thought this would be extrodinary, but it was really quite plain.  We added some garlic, sauteed onion and provolone, but it was still just okay.  I do a crockpot roast with beef broth, red wine, garlic, onion and rosemary, thicken the gravy, shred the beef and eat in on buns or mashed potatoes and we like it much, much more.

MMMM,MMMM good! These are great and sooo easy! I did add au jus mix, as suggested by others, and the sauce was extremely flavorful. My husband usually likes grilled onions on his sandwiches, but these had such onion flavor he did not need them. I tried these with and without provolone cheese, and must say that with the au jus mix included you don't notice the cheese at all because the juice is so flavorful(save some calories). Also, don't make the mistake of thinking your roast is done before the full seven hours of cooking is complete. I got a little nervous because four hours into cooking my roast was cooked and seems a little dry. However, I let it cook the full seven hours and the meat ended up tender and juicy.

This recipe is as good as advertised. The meat is tender and full of flavor. The melted provolone is a must. I also added a packet of au jus mix and used consomme instead of beef broth. Be sure to trim the fat from the roast before cooking.

This is very good.  We use Venison instead of beef and it turns out great.  I agree with another review that a dark beer makes this even better.  Recently I used this recipe as the base and added a few extra spices, and vegetables and potatoes to make a stew.  Great for a cold winter day.

My whole family loved this recipe, espcially the teens.  I changed soy s to low sodium and added a TBS worstershire sauce. The au jus was still very salty but also very concentrated.  I will make this again. Thanks for a great slow cooker recipe.

Wow!  I used a different cut of beef but it still turned out great.  I ended up adding two shakes of worchestershire and soy sauce to up the flavor a bit.  Once I had it on the grilled buns with some Provolone cheese...omg...I could eat this every day!!!  Wonderful stuff!  Will be a regular.  I'm going to try freezing the extra sauce to add to the next batch.  P.S.  Instead of beef broth I used beef consomme which adds a lot of flavor I think.

I love fix-n-forget recipes, especially ones that turn out so well in the crockpot.  I quickly seared the roast before putting it in the crockpot; when it was done 5 hours later, I made 'canoes' in crusty French rolls to hold all of the filling.  Next time I'll add a few more sauted onions and a bit of thyme before cooking.  Thanks for an easy weeknight meal!

My husband gave this a four star rating but the kids and I thought it was a five!!  I left out the beer and added another can of beef broth.  I also added a packet of McCormick Au Jus seasonings, as another reviewer suggested.  It was terrific to come home from church with this all ready for us!!

Because of my work schedule I usually make one crock-pot dinner a week. My family said this was "absolutely outstanding", I thought it was pretty good too. Took advice of several reviewers and added worchestershire, garlic salt and onion powder to the pot, used and english roast. Toasted our french rolls w/ butter and garlic powder.Topped it all off w/ sauteed onions and melted provolone. This really worked for us and will be made again!

800 people can't be wrong about this, so the purpose of my review is to warn you to follow this recipe closely because you can screw it up!  My changes apparently kept this from turning out as well as I had hoped.  First, use the cut of meat specified. I used a top round (very lean) cut and it was tough at first, so I cooked it longer and then it became really dry. Also, I threw in a 14.5 ounce can of reduced salt beef broth instead of 10.5 ounce and I think it diluted the flavor of the French onion too much. The broth was pretty bland,so I would probably not use the reduced sodium next time, either.

My husband does not really like roast, but loved this. I was worried about the beer taste and thought that it was a little strong at first, but by the end it was all together delicious. Even better the next day for lunch. I halved the meat, but kept the juices the same and we used it all! Awesome recipe!

Delicious!  I think I'll increase the cooking time about an hour next time to make the meat a little more tender, but the flavor was excellent!

This is a standby for our family! I add whole black peppercorns and garlic and when broil french rolls cut side up butter and then add swiss or provolone and back into the broiler to melt! Love this easy and delicious recipe!

My husband and I really liked these French Dip sandwhiches.  We put the meat on french rolls, topped with swiss cheese and broiled for a few minutes in the oven.  Yummm!

Gosh, I hate being the wet blanket!  This was WAY salty.  The saltiness overpowered any flavor.  I used Swanson broth,Campbell's soup and one can of domestic beer.  Sorry.

Looking for ultra simple recipes for my crockpot, I came across this one and gave it a try today.  Both my onion hating 7 yr old and my irritatingly picky Texan hubby loved it!  I did add the au jus, and topped the sandwiches with a slice of swiss cheese.  Excellent recipe!  And oh, so simple!

My husband actually made this one. He gave it a 5 on ease of preparing, and a 3.5 on taste (he thought something was missing). It was excellent and worth making again. (good the next day too)

I am just learning to cook, so I followed this recipe exactly as it calls.  Oh sure, the meat was nice and tender, but all I could taste was the beer. My fiance and I could even sense the carbonation in it.  I think if I ever felt crazy enough to try the recipe again I will definitely leave out the beer and probably replace the beef broth with beef consume.

I make this for my husband and myself all the time, but recently made it for my parents and grandparents one Saturday afternoon. My mom, a caterer, has now added it to her catering menu. I do use consumme in addition to beef broth. More au jus never hurt anyone.

I made this last night for my family, leaving out the beer and adding swiss cheese before toasting the bread. It was pretty good, however, it could have used a little more flavor. I think I'll play around with the flavors a little more next time. Thanks for sharing:)

Very good recipe. I especially liked the au jus. It was perfect for dipping the sandwich and the fries. In addition, I added provolone cheese and put it in the oven to melt. The cheese tasted great with the meat.

This was super excellent and super easy to make. I didn't add beer because I don't like it but it was still great. I toasted the buns and melted American cheese over these. My daughter ate this with some BBQ sauce. Everyone liked it. I added garlic and more onions. A keeper!

Tried this recipe the other day, and it was really easy.  I used onion soup mix and beef broth instead of the french onion soup.  I decided to leave out the beer, as my boyfriend doesn't really care for food cooked in beer.  When I tasted the au jus, it was really salty, and I decided to add the beer.  Didn't care for the flavor of the beer, so next time I would leave out the beer and just add water.  The meat was really tender, and all in all a great easy recipe. Will definately make this again- thanks!

This was a very good meal. I didn't have as long to let it cook so I used my electric knife and sliced the meat before cooking. My husband is totally not into alcohol at all so I had to leave out the beer. I was gonna try to get away w/it but some reviewers said it gave it a very strong flavor. So I used 2 14.5oz. cans of beef broth. I also added a little beef bouillion powder, a sliced onion and had to use onion soup mix. Cooked on high for 4 hours and was so delicious and sooo tender. Will definately make again.

The sauce for dipping was VERY GOOD.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was still very flavorful.  We enjoyed cheese on the sandwiches....next time I'll try grilled peppers and onions.

SOOOOO Easy and SOOOOO good.  I've made this recipe a number of times.  The only thing I added was I added sliced mushrooms and onions to the last time I made it.  But, with or without those, it was perfect.  Would HIGHLY recommend this one.

I followed this recipe and also added spices that other reviewers recommended (garlic powder, rosemary & thyme)...and it was delicious! I will be adding this into our regular meal rotation. The au jus is very flavorful - it makes the sandwich! I can't wait to eat the leftovers throughout the week.

This was very good but... I should have listened to the other reviewers about adding some salt and seasoning to the juice.  It was a little bland.  Also, duh, why didn't I melt some provolone or mozzerella when I toasted the buns in the oven???  That would have been awesome.  Everyone thought it was pretty decent though.  Even my picky four year old.  Maybe she just liked dipping the sandwich and not getting in trouble for it.

This was delicious! I added a few more spices (rosemary, thyme) and used powered onion soup mix. We also added swiss cheese to our sub buns. My hubby loved it! Will definitely make again.

I made a few modifications. I used red wine instead of beer (didn't have any) and powered onion soup and some worechestire(sp) sauce. Added a bit of pepper too. Good recipe if you are looking for something diff. to do in your slow cooker instead of the usual chilli and roasts. Makes alot of dipping sauce. Will do again.

This was very, very easy and very, very good. Still not as good as my mom's (I can never cook stuff like she does!) The beer was a bit overpowering though, may want to cut it to 1/2 a can.

Omigoodness!!!! If anyone could ever say this wasnt good, or give it less than 5 stars, they are either lying or do not know how to follow directions. I didnt deviate from the recipie at all (no searing, garlic, extra spices, nothing!) and it was wonderful. We dont drink alcohol but I used beer anyways (I had no clue what kind to buy as I have never had a beer so I got budweiser because it said "king of beers")and being as I am not acustomed to the taste of alcohol, you'd think I would have tasted it. Well, I didnt! And no one in my family noticed either (we are all non-boozers). It was delicious and easy to clean up becuase everything was in one pot!

I tried this yesterday and my husband said it was very good. I thought it was just "ok". I will probably cook it again but next time I'll use less beer because I could taste it on the meat and I thought it was a little overpowering. It was a very easy meal to cook and I'm using the leftovers in soup with noodles and veggies tonight.

The juice was awesome on this.  I added the provolone cheese as was suggested and it was wonderful.  My meat didn't come out as tender as I would have liked.  My rump roast was 4.5 pounds so I think I should have cooked longer.  I also could have sliced a bit thinner...needs to be sliced very thin.

I ended up substituting a few things to use what I had on hand but loved this recipe overall, so did our company!  I took out the onion soup and used 1/3 c soy sauce and enough worchestershire to total 1/2 c instead.  I also omitted the butter for the bread and added thyme, rosemary and garlic powder to the juice then strained it when it was done cooking.  I didn't have that much roast either so I used a 1 1/2 pound venison roast that I cut up in small pieces and browned before I put it in the crockpot.  This recipe was absolutely delicious!  Thank you!

This was very good and easy!  Next time I'm going to sautee some onions and put them on top of the provolone cheese when I broil the bread in the oven.  I might also add a little soy sauce to give the broth a little more flavor.  But it's definitely a keeper!

Very easy and requires minimal prep time!  I sliced the beef up once it was done cooking and then returned the slices to the crockpot to soak up more of that wonderful au jus.  Meanwhile I topped sub buns with swiss and placed them in the oven to toast.  Better than ordering french dips out and much cheaper!

Reduce the FAT!!!!

This recipe is GREAT, if you are looking for a way to cut down on the fat, try the method I just used, it works perfectly.

After the roast is done cooking, allow some time for the broth to cool.  Then fill a large ziploc bag with ice.  Seal the bag and immerse it in the broth (if the broth is too hot, it will likely melt the bag).  The bag will latch onto the fat, after you are done, throw the bag away.

Once you have reduced enough fat, put the broth back in the crock pot for 5-10 minutes in order to heat it back up.  

Give it a try and let me know how it worked for you!

These were the best french-dip sandwiches I've ever had. The sauce was very flavorful. The only changes I made was to use a sliced sweet onion and two cans of low sodium beef broth instead of the cans of soup and broth (my husband's on a low sodium diet). I made soup with the leftover sauce, some chopped meat, a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and some egg noodles. When I re-heated the soup at work 3 people came over to see what smelled so good. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Awesome!!:-)  We put cheese on the bread before putting it in the oven. It was heavenly after dipping the sandwiches in the gravy.:-) MMM!  Will definitely make this again. Completely easy for a work night.

Really good, and very simple. I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours, and it probably could have gone a little longer.  But good all the same!

Wow... great recipe. Reading through the reviews really helped. I definitely suggest adding onion powder & a clove of garlic. I sliced the beef and let it cook in slices for the final two hours.

I didn't like it one bit. I could only taste beer. Perhaps it is because I used a Canadian beer but I found it to be awful. Never again will I attempt this one. I used a different French Dip recipe from the web page (submitted by Giselle) and it was much better.

This is absolutely awesome!  We've always liked French Dips...one of my favs is at the America Grill in NYNY Las Vegas.  After having that I wanted to try it myself.  My husband said it was way better than theirs and is a common item on our dinner table.  I did what most people recommended, added more beef base, browned the meat first and sliced and soaked longer.  I've sauteed some onions in the au jus w/ some butter to go with the sammich.  I've also added some portobello mushrooms to the au jus, because it just has great flavor.

Fantastic!  I add a tablespoon of brown sugar with the beer, and strain out the onions just before serving (I have a kid who won't eat things if he can SEE the onions). If have extra time in the morning, I brown the meat before popping it into the crock, but it's fine without doing so.  It's a family favorite now.

I was surprised how well this turned out.  Tasted just like a french dip from a restaurant.  I used top round roast and sliced the meat thinly and placed it back into the crock pot to simmer in the juice before making the sandwiches.  The au jus was really good.

Excellent!!!  The au jus was the icing on the cake.  The only problem (if you can call it that) I had was I cooked it on low for eight hours, and let it sit on "warm" setting for two and a half more (waiting on company...grrr...) and the meat was so tender that it was falling apart as I took it out to try and slice it.  So we had thick and meaty French dip sandwiches instead of sliced French dip sandwiches.  It was still very very delicious!!!

This recipe was fabulous....I made it at work on a day where we were all required to stay for 12 hours.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing wrong was the timing.  It was a little overdone for the time noted.  Will definately make again, but shorten the cooking time.  The office absolutely loved it!

This is SOOO good. My husband and 4 picky boys always ask for this.  We butter the rolls and broil them a bit then add mayo and shredded cheddar before placing the meat in.  SCRUMPTIOUS!

I've made this french dip several times.  My family loves it, including our picky little ones.  We don't drink beer, so I use 12 oz. water in its place plus 2 tsp "Better than Bouillon" (an excellent bouillon base!)  I also use a can of beef consume instead of the can of beef broth- for stronger flavor.  Wonderful on toasted, crusty rolls!  Very delicious!

Awesome!  Here are my changes - used 2lb. top round roast with 1 can french onion soup, 1/2 pouch of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix, 1 bottle beer, 1 beef bouillion cube in 1 cup water.  I cooked in crock on low for about 5 hours, then turned it up b/c it seemed tough.  One hour before serving, I removed meat, sliced and replaced.  Excellent flavor, very tender...just had leftovers...still yummy!  Thanks!

Did someone say "Accidental" Slow Cooker French Dip recipe?  The box of French Onion Soup mix that I had on hand also happened to contain a free full-sized sample package of Ranch Dip mix.  You guessed it.  I pulled a pack out, opened it up and dumped it into the liquid - and it didn't look like onion soup mix!  It did, however, add an additional interesting flavor to the broth and might be something someone would consider doing on purpose if you think the recipe is "bland" without additional flavor.  I didn't want it to be a huge mistake, though, so I did also add a package of onion soup mix with about 2 cups more of water.  I didn't have time to use the slow cooker, though, so cooked it in the pressure cooker and it came out superb just the same!  (For high altitude: I pressure cooked for 1-1/4 hours instead of the 60 minutes called for in my pressure cooker cookbook for a pot roast.)  I browned the meat in the pressure cooker before adding the liquid and also sauted a large sweet onion (cut in thin slices) in the pan before adding the juices.  I used a 12-oz bottle of "Loft" by New Belgium Brewing.  Everyone thinks it's great - and the aroma in the house is divine!

This was great! My family loved it, I added a few more spices (don't even remember) and rubbed the meat with Worster sauce and little bit of seasoning salt... I left it on for 7.5 hours and had to shred the beef as it wouldn't cut, it didn't matter because it was VERY good, I added a bit of the Au Jus mix to the pot and boiled for 15 min. It was great. Thanks.

So quick and easy! I took the advice of other reviewers and only used half a bottle of beer. The next day, I thickened the gravy with cornstarch made mashed potatoes and served over toast for some tasty hot beef sandwiches.

This was very good, after some work.  I bought the rump roast and seasoned it with salt and pepper then put it in the crock with light beer and a can of french onion soup.  I cooked it on low all day into the night, then unplugged the crock.  The next day, I turned it back on and tested the meat.  It was VERY tough and the juice tasted very strongly of beer.  I removed the roast and sliced it with an electric meat slicer, very thin.  I poured the sauce into a sauce pan and boiled it to burn off the beer flavor, then added another can of french onion soup.  I carmelized 4 onions and added them to the sauce and continued to cook on slow for another couple of hours. I heated the french rolls and added provolone cheese slices to each roll then put the meat in.  Served on a plate with the sauce in a small ramekin for dipping.  Was very good!

Super easy and made for great sandwiches for three days.  We added a splash of red wine, a packet of Lipton's onion soup mix and a few garlic cloves, and served it with white cheddar.
Great convenience!  Thanks!

Very tasty and tender.  My husband loved it.  I will add more onions the next time and maybe serve it with some provolone cheese on the bun too.  Definitely a keeper!

Ughh!  This recipe left much to be desired.  The meat came out very bland and we ended up mixing it with a bottle of BBQ sauce.  After that it was o.k.    Not one I will be making again.

I made these for my husband because he really likes French Dip sandwiches.  I think they are OK but this recipie was delicious.  We both thought they were great.  I couldn't find french rolls so I cut a french loaf in half buttered it and toasted and added some provolone the last couple of minutes. My small children just ate the meat and liked it.

Easy to prepare and let sit all day.  I did add some garlic powder and worcestershire sauce as some have commented and that rounded it out perfectly.  Great recipe!

Had very good flavor, just like a real restaurant Beef Dip.  Do not use too much beer though, a little goes a long way.

EXCELLENT!! I used Progresso french onion soup and 3 beef boullion cubes instead of beef broth. I also used a dark beer. This was absolutely the best french dip we ever had!!! Meat was so tender and it was so good with the toasted buttered rolls!! thanks!

Turned out great!  I was a little nervous about the beer, since neither I or my husband drink.  At first the smell of beer was really strong, but in the end, it added a nice flavor.  After reading the reviews, I added a dash of garlic salt and thyme (don't know if that made a difference of not).  Will make this again!

This was very yummy, although the roast didn't get as tender as I had hoped - probably not a fault of the recipe, but of my preparation or length of time cooked.  Served this to company and everyone enjoyed it.  I'll for sure try it again.

I made this last night for dinner.  I used a London broil cut of meat and added a dash of liquid smoke to the recipe.  I give it 5 stars for ease of preparing but wasn't that thrilled with how it turned out.  The meat was rather dry (maybe it would have been better if I'd used a Tri-tip instead) and the sauce was just OK, not awful but not awesome either.  I think I will keep looking for another French Dip recipe for my crockpot.

I've been making this for over a year now.  Everyone in my family just loves it.  I don't always use rump roast though, it can be very expensive when it's not on sale.  Also, rump roast can be somewhat tough & chewy so I've experimented with other cuts of meat.  I guess what I'm trying to say is the flavor is always wonderful but the texture can vary, depending on what cut of meat you use.  It's a simple, no fuss recipe.  Thanks Robin!

This was a keeper.  Directions were easy to follow and meat turned out pretty tasty.  I added a little flour to the gravy to thicken it but otherwise it was delicious.

I didn't have all the stuff for this recipe, so I had to sub fried onions (chopped) and beef broth, and I had to use some wine since I didn't have any beer, oh, well, it was fantastic anyway, thanks for the idea.

Fabulous Recipe! I took another reviewers advice and used Campbell's Consomme and Campbell's French Onion soup. Used Bass beer and it was excellent. No one could taste the beer at all. I also served it on toasted "French Bread rolls to Die for" from this site. Can't wait to have it again.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful. The recipe I had found also called for an additional can of beef broth, 1/2 package of onion soup mix, and a teaspoon of sugar. It's so awesome and really easy to put together! I also serve the beef topped with Provel cheese.

Used a can of light beer and could totally taste it. Otherwise, a good recipe.  Would recommend only putting half a can of beer or omitting it altogether.

Unfortunately we did not like this at all- very bland- I even added some garlic and other seasonings- and the "sauce for dipping" was not very good- very disappointing- sorry will not make again.

This was TASTY!! So easy to set up in the morning and let it go all day.  My husband loved it, and he can be picky.  I broiled some buttered french rolls, and added provolone cheese on top of the beef.  Delicious!  Te meat reheated really well for a second meal with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was great. It just neede a little longer to cook. I also used ground sirloin instead. I also used mozzerella cheese on the bread,but without the butter. It tasted great a few days later for leftovers.

This is THE best sandwich I have ever made!!  I made this for our family, gobbled it right up and then made it for some friends and they loved it!  Now we are making it for our Bible study pot-luck that serves about 20 people!  I heat the rolls in the oven for about 15 min. and serve with provolone cheese! I have bought 5 rump roasts in the past 2 weeks!  Yummmmmmm

Oh, WOW!  This was wonderful and I took one of the other's advise and added the onion and bell peppers (from the garden) so that they were well-soaked! Plus, I added Worcestershire to add a more robust flavor...it tasted like the best! Very delicious and we are adding it to our monthly menu!  Thank you so much!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Definitely do not forgo toasting the bread it makes a big difference.  I found no need to make any changes in time or ingredients.  I did slice the meat paper thin which was perfect.

I was a little skeptical of using this recipe cuz of the last 2 reviews but I did anyway, It was pretty good, the meat was so tender I had to shred it which really wasn't that bad, the au jus just needed something else not sure what though. We added mozarella for the cheese. The family liked it will just try to figure out what spice it needs to make it more flavorful. Sonya

After this recipe appeared in the What's Cooking newsletter, I was really excited to try it - especially with all the good reviews.  Unfortuately, it wasn't nearly as good as I had been led to expect.  You can very easily taste the beer, the meat was flavorless and very dry.  Nothing like a french dip from a resturant, even with toasted buns.  Don't waste your roast on this recipe.

Excellent! I made it with boneless chuck roast and had to cook at least twice as long, but flavor is great. Strongly recommend putting rolls in the oven as directed as the crunchiness is what you need when dipping into the sauce.

I did not care for this recipe at all. The taste was not what I expected and the beer did not help it any.  My husband thought it was okay and the kids did not like it either. But, it was worth a try. Thanks anyway!

This recipe is FABULOUS!! I thought it was a little weird with beer at first, but when my family tasted it--WOW!! It is now a bi-weekly addition to my family menu. We add onion soup mix occasionally and different types of beer-sometimes dark sometimes lighter-they all taste great and the meat is so tender we have trouble getting it out of the slow cooker!!

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish. I used a Sirloin Roast, sliced it an hour before being done and it came out great, also added quite a bit of salt. I also used regular french bread and cut them in quarters then put mozzarela on the inside. It came out GREAT!!!

This was totally EXCELLENT!!  I did take it out and slice it about an hour before serving:).  It was wonderful and the best I've had.  The only thing I wish was better was my ability to slice the meat thinner, lol.

This was too salty for me. My husband loved it.  I think if I used beef bullion instead of all the soy sauce I would have liked it.  It was shredded beef though, not sliced like I wanted...

Robyn Bloomquist!
Thank you for this easy recipe.  We added some carrots, onion and celery to it and slow baked it over night because our slow cooker was too small for this size roast.  My husband doesn't like beer in any form, so we used a nice shiraz in it's place.  We stopped cooking it after 5 hrs and let it cool to cut it and then let it cook another 2 hrs.  It was so good and filling.  We made burritos out of the leftover meat and french onion soup out of the leftover broth.  
Thank You!  Thank You!  Thank You!

This was so easy and came out so good.  The first night we used the toasted french bread, but then the next day we had the left overs for lunch without the bread and it was just as good!!!  I recommend this recipe to anyone!

I have used this recipe several times, adjusting it for my family.  Instead of consomme, I have used 'beef starter' from my local membership club.  I have also used a stronger flavored beer such as Guinness.  I also add swiss cheese when I serve it.  I make this at least once a month and is a favorite for sports parties!!!  Was a smash hit for the Super Bowl!!!

Only change was I added a sliced onion. I used condenced broth since it was the only type available at that size. I chilled the whole batch, skimmed all the hardened grease , sliced it thin on a slicer and cooked it for an hour or two more... very very good.. will definately make again.

I didn't find this as overwhelmingly good as most other posters, but I'll definitely make it again. I could distinctly taste the presence of the beer (I used MGD), which wasn't necessarily bad. Just weird - next time i'll only add about 1/4 can. My husband asked me why we don't make this all the time, so considering how easy it is, it'll go in my permanent file!

My family LOVED this recipe. We had enough juice left over to freeze for french onion soup later. My only change was to cook it for 10 hours- 7 just wasn't enough in my crockpot.  Will make again.

We use the broth as a wonderful onion soup.  Add the toasted french bread, melt some cheese on top...it's heavenly!

This is the best pot roast you'll ever eat. In a house with picky eaters, it is amazing that everyone loved it. I would serve it for Sunday dinner with mashed potates and gravy or rice and a veggie. Serve the french bread for rolls. Ymm ymm.

DELICIOUS! Put it in the slow cooker in the a.m. and by dinner time, it is fork tender!  The BEST pot roast we've ever had.  My husband couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks!
We cooked it on high for 2 1/2 hours and then on low for 3 1/2.

This is absolutely _delicious_  The best French
Dip I've ever eaten.  My husband agrees that this
recipe is a real keeper.  Tender, flavorful and so
easy to prepare.  This is one recipe I'm sure I'll
use often.

WOW--we loved it. I too, was wondering about the beer taste but it was wonderful. My husband loved it. I also added garlic and sliced the beef and put it back to cook longer to get all the flavor.Gotta try it!

This was wonderful! I think that because it uses fairly simple ingredients, and not too many you enjoy the taste of the beef even more.  My husband and kids all loved it, and it was so easy.

This was a very easy recipe! The flavor was good but I will skip the beer next time. I could taste the beer too much and myself personally i did'nt care for it in the recipe. Other than that it was wonderful! My husband liked it very much too!

I didn't have beer so I added a small amount of white wine. I wasn't overly excited about this recipe after slicing the meat BUT I loved it after following some reviewers advice. I sliced the beef and let it cook in the broth another couple of hours until tender. It was wonderful with cheese, sauteed onions and peppers! I will make this again!

This is an excellent recipe.  VERY easy to make.  I made it today and it was a hit.  My husband really enjoyed it.  Added some black pepper to the roast and some swiss cheese to the sandwiches and they were delicious!  Will make this one again and again I'm sure.

This recipe is delicious and a SNAP to make! I also sliced the beef and returned it to the pot to cook, it made it sooo tender! I didn't have any beer in the house, so I omitted it and it still turned out great!

I've made this at least 10 times.  Don't use a strong tasting beer because it infiltrates the taste.  I butter and sprinkle parmesan cheese on the buns before toasting.  I also use packaged au jus for dipping.

Loved this. My family loved this. I don’t venture too far from my usual repertoire of the same 5 recipes, but I wanted to try something new. If I can make this, you can make this. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that due to taking my 80 year old mom to her doctor appt and running the teen to youth group it was in the slow cooker on low for 7:35hr and on warm for about 3 additional hours. I figured it was doomed, but sliced the meat and returned to the juice for another hour while tending to the dog who just had surgery. Sautéd a yellow onion, toasted the open face of the buns in a skillet, added meat, layered the onions, put two slices of provolone on top and placed under the broiler until bubbly and browned. These words can’t out of my husbands mouth: “this is the best French dip I’ve ever had”. Paired well with Simply Lemonade & vodka.

This was sooo good.  Easy too.  Just what I like! I didn't have the condensed french onion soup, but had a package of the powdered onion soup mix. Added a little water and the beef broth and beer.  It was delicious!!

I have made this recipe at least 5 times in the last couple of years. It is absolutely delicious! I follow the recipe. My husband always trims as much of the fat off of the rump roast as possible. However, I make homemade French Onion soup, courtesy of Tyler Florence from the Food Network (Which I make several personal adjustments to), the day before. I feel that the homemade French onion soup is my key to perfect the flavor to my palate. However, next time, I may try using a different cut as recommended by some other reviews. 

This recipe is delicious! I know, it's redundant. I don't care. My husband always looks so forward to this meal!

Not a slow cooker fan but this is easy & absolutely delicious. 
I have made it twice and it’s becoming a fast favorite. Since we are empty nesters, a 4 lb rump roast is way too much, even having leftovers several times.

My family loved these sandwiches.  I don't have beer at my house so I left it out.  I had only a 2 1/2 # roast so I didn't use as much liquid.  I used 1 packet of Lipton onion soup mix, added 3 cups water, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. and I sprinkled the roast with some pepper and dried minced garlic (about 1/2 tsp of each).  I got it started a little late so I cooked on high in the slow-cooker.  It was done in 5 hours.  I served them on homemade buns, some of my family put cheese on them, too.  I'm sure I'll make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made it twice now and everyone who has it loves it! I use whatever inexpensive beef roast I can find, the bottle of beer, beef both and pecker packer of dried onion soup ( because the soup I dry, I double the beef broth). I serve it with ciabatta buns, cheese, sauteed mushrooms and horse radish as well as butter and a sprinkle or garlic salt on the buns, as per another review. I like to dip mine in the juice, whereas my husband likes to be pour some juice inside n his sandwich. Either way, it's delicious and willy continue to be a popular meal in our house!

I made this but substituted 2 sirloin roasts to lower the fat content. The roast was slightly dry by itself but the au jus more than compensated. If I'd been able to purchase one large roast instead of 2 small ones, it may not have been dry at all.  I froze several packets with 2 portions of beef for future meals and equal portions of au jus to go with each. Easy meals for the future.

This was wonderful. We like our food well seasoned, so I seasoned the roast prior to putting it in the crockpot. I didn't have beer so I omitted that. I used Lipton dry onion soup mix and Better than Bouillon beef base in place of the broth and onion soup. It was terrific. We actually ate it for dinner 2 nights and for 1 lunch. I will be making this again for sure.

Loved the flavor. Shared with my daughter and her husband. They loved it also. I made the onion soup recipe on this site instead of using canned soup. I’m on a low salt diet. Also used no salt added beef broth and granules. Will definitely make again.

Have French dips always been this easy? I threw a nice hunk of blue cheese on top like I get at Philippes and couldn’t tell the difference. It left me wondering why I’ve stood in line for one when I could make it at home

I added a few things and changed a few also. Instead of French onion condensed soup I added two packets of Lipton beefy onion, 1/4 c of soy sauce, and 3 beef bullion cubes. I put it in the slow cooker overnight for 7 hours on low, then let it cool and refrigerated it in the morning until afternoon. Took it out of the fridge and took out the fat and grease and put it in the stove to simmer and cook down for better flavor. I also used a fresh French bread loaf and toasted it in the oven. Afterward I cut it up into sandwich sizes, put Swiss cheese on each piece and broiled them in the toaster oven and after served with au jus. My husband said that this is the best French dip he has ever had and the best thing I have ever made for dinner. My picky 7 year old kept saying how delicious it was! I think that leaving it in the fridge to seal in the flavor and then reducing the sauce with the meat on the stove made it better than ever.

The jus is excellent. Bottom round was on sale and it was nice and tender on the sandwich. Served with a little horseradish and the au jus. Also with old fashioned potato salad recipe from this site.

If you are looking for a very easy recipe this is it.  The flavor of this was good, but nothing special,  I felt that this tasted most like a roast on a bun.

I made it as is and it was really good. The second time I made it, I used a dry red wine instead of the beer (I associate wine with France more than beer and we have wine on hand but hardly ever have any beer) and personally thought it was much better. Definitely use french onion soup/mix and consume’ . Added sliced onions and mushrooms. Added a dash of Kitchen Bouquet, Country Bob sauce, B-V sauce, minced garlic and pepper to the slow cooker with the meat. Buttered the rolls, slapped on some provolone cheese and stuck them in the broiler before serving.......Amazing!

Holy moly!! This was so so GOOD!! I did take the time to read numerous reviews, listened to the advice given, made some tweaks suggested by reviewers and HALLELUJAH.... This was a winner! I used approximately 1/3 of a can of beer. I wasn't able to find a really dark beer as suggested (can't find those easily when just wanting one can) so I used a lighter beer I had on hand. I don't think it made a huge difference because this was still really good. I rubbed the roast with garlic powder, used a half of an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, a little Worcestire, beef stock, a little Better than Bullion, a packet of au ju, and time. Don't rush this recipe. Just let it sit in the crock pot and leave it alone. I mean it! Don't lift the lid to get closer to the heavenly smell coming out of there! I am such a fan of this recipe! I'm going to be making this one again and again.

So the only thing I changed at first was to sub a can of beef consommé for the broth as suggested by other reviews but found it still needed salt...threw in 2 Knorr beef bouillon cubes and it was PERFECT! First night I made French dips, second day I had the soup with French bread for lunch & then added a can of cream of mushroom to the remaining broth & served with the leftover beef over egg noodles for dinner...all 3 were totally yummy!!

I've made this a couple times, and I hate giving recipes good reviews when I have to make changes. But this needs more salt, with a bit more salt, maybe some garlic, this is a pretty good and simple recipe.

We are not beer drinkers but I have to admit that it gave it a great flavor.  I love the combination of flavors that the soups/consomme give it.  I admit to not using rump roast but a boneless chuck roast.   Very little fat on it and it fell apart, no slicing.   Loved it!!

Definitely make it again! Had to use a substitution for the French onion soup as that is not available here. As a result, also added in one raw onion.

Pretty solid. I made it according to the recipe using Guinness Draught, and it smelled fantastic while it was cooking. When I tasted it as I shredded the meat the flavor was just okay. Per other comments I added garlic powder and onion powder as well as a little bit of worcestershire sauce but it still wasn't right. I could tell it wasn't sweet enough for French onion soup so I ended up adding a few teaspoons of sugar which helped some but didn't entirely fix it and then I had my wife taste it and she said it wasn't oniony enough or salty enough. So with the addition of a hefty amount of onion salt we ended up with a  good product. My only other gripe is that I read the comment suggesting provolone cheese and so bought that but I remember eating french onion soup with swiss cheese somewhere and I tried that second and it was fantastic! So final notes: Onion salt not powder, garlic powder, sugar if needed, worcestershire, and SWISS for the win. And I was adding stuff at the end so be conservative with your amounts if you're starting that way.

Made exactly as is. You really need to make sandwiches and dip the meet in the au jus because the meat doesn’t take on a whole lot of flavor.

This is one of my favorites.  I made this a day ahead and put in the refrigerator so I could remove the grease and slice the beef thinly.  We loved it so much, we ate it for three days in a row until it was gone.  My husband has been asking me when we will have the French dips again.

I Used a  rump roast along with some of the suggestions of others to amp up the flavor by using onion soup dry mix and beef broth... garlic cloves and some herbs.   7 hours seemed perfect on low, but i think i would have preferred a chuck roast for flavor and juicier cut of the meat.  I would make this again with a chuck roast next time.  I used NO beer and the au jus  was still awesome.

It is very important that you really trim the fat from the roast before you start cooking.  I'd also throw in 2-3 bay leaves at the beginning.

First time using the crockpot tonight and this recipe was amazing. I added 4 shakes of Worcestershire sauce, 1 chopped onion, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, dash of salt, dash of pepper and I used Killian Red beer. We are using the left over for French onion soup tomorrow. Can’t wait to do it again.

I love French dip....it is one of the only things my entire family loves.  I usually have to make at least 2 separate meals because half the family doesn't like something.  I always know we will all eat French Dip Sandwiches!

This is the way I make mine too basically. 
I’ve not used beer, but will try it!
I also add a can on CS Condensed Golden Mushroom and a bit morebeth broth so I have excess jus. 
PS The sauce is “jus”. The sandwich in “au jus” (with jus).

I have made this many times.  I have been in a retirement facility for 5 years, and haven't cooked since I've been here.  This is the best recipe for French Dip Sandwiches!!   And plan to make this again soon.   I bought a smallslow cooker and will try my hand at cooking again, but I know this is a great recipe.

I omitted beef broth since onion soup already had it. Really good with some horseradish on the bread first. Meat was actually better the next day, too soft for me right when it was done but the boyfriend ate most of it night of.

I felt it was just okay.  The meat was soft, but it tastes like every other pot roast I put in a crockpot.  I even brought out the electric knife to make thin cuts for roast beef slices.

It was good and my family enjoyed it but I think I can make it better with a few adjustments. I did follow the directions to a T. Used Guinness Stout beer. First I would add the dry onion soup mix. Then I would top with cooked, sliced onions and peppers. Then it would be Roll Tide good!

I’ll be making this over and over again. I didn’t make the original but took most of the advice in the comments for making this and wouldn’t change a single thing. 

I changed the meat because the one in the recipe wasn’t available at my store, and the beef chuck was the recommended replacement. The beer was a really great touch. It was so, so good.

I added fresh minced garlic and some salt and pepper along with a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce. I removed and cut the meat around 6hrs and threw it back in for the last hour which really added flavor to it.

Finally, I got some sourdough hoagies and melted provolone cheese on them in the broiler and added butter.

I’ll be making this again and again!

Guinness beer, worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and onion powder were added to the recipe. I used chuck roast and put it on panini style bread with provolone cheese melted on them plus some sauteed sweet onion on top of the meat. Big succes with the lion living with me :> I will make again

I needed to make this gluten free, so I could not use the French Onion Dip as it has gluten in it.  So I sliced up a yellow onion and added that to the beef stock (gluten free stock), I also used a gluten free dark beer.  I added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic.  I also used a Chuck Roast as rump roasts are harder to find.  Chuck makes the meat more like pulled pork in texture.

I cannot get over how good this tastes.  Excellent recipe.

This was a great recipe to have cooking all day on a Sunday.  I wasn't able to slice the roast after it was cooked, so we ended up with more of a shredded beef, but the flavor was amazing.  I used a dark porter for the beer, and although you couldn't taste the beer, the caramel-ish flavor that it gave was very tasty.  We paired it with crispy french fries (also tasty in the au jus) and a caesar salad.  What a great meal with little effort, thanks to the slow cooker!

Love this recipe.  It's so easy to put the few ingredients in the slow cooker before I leave for work.  It was a hit for the entire family, and now my son makes it for us, too.  I made it per the instructions, but I add some swiss cheese to the rolls in the last minute or so of baking.  The buttered rolls make this whole recipe extra tasty!

Added 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, garlic and mustard. Used beer, but substituted 2 cups beef broth and 1 package onion soup mix.
Had it on toasted Ciabatta rolls with no butter but added 1 slice provolone cheese.Meat was very tender and recipe was a hit, but if I didn't make the changes I did I can understand comments about it being bland.

I made this for dinner and it was great. I took the advice of some of the reviews, added some garlic, a shake of worcestershire, a dark beer, sliced the meat and then put it back into that delicious aujus for a little while (15 min back in the jus, then assembled the sandwiches). I also may or may not have topped the buttered and beefed up rolls w a sharp sliced provolone and broiled it for 2 minutes :) served it w fries. You should try this one!

I added onion flakes, onion powder, garlic powder, and a little salt & pepper to the meat while cooking and provolone cheese to the toasted bread.

I have made this recipe for about sixteen years! This was one of my first recipes as a young mom, in my first apartment and a “treat” meal. I usually add onion powder, garlic power and serve on garlic bread rolls. Delish!

This is amazing!!! I’ve actually only had one or two French dips in my whole life but my husband always orders them. I decide  to try and make it at home. This recipe is to die for!!  I used a chuck roast, and a packet of onion soup, 2 cans of beef broth, garclic salt, garlic. A few minor changes and holy moly! The meat is delicious and so is the sauce. It will be a new staple in our house.

Delicious recipe!  I forgot to buy condensed french onion soup however I had a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix so I made it with 1/2 of the water called for.  It turned out great!  Excited to try this with comsumme as other reviewers have suggested.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions listed here and used the Guiness beer, added onion powder, garlic, pepper and used a beef chuck boneless petite roast.  I put buttered foccacia rolls under the broiler just til browning, removed and added provolone, placed back in the oven to melt cheese, perfection!  Thanks so much for this super easy meal...also, I guess fries and coleslaw are great sides for this too!

This recipe is a perfectly fine starting place.  To make it better I use a dark beer or stout, my preference is New Castle, or Guinness.  It adds a lot of depth to the flavor.  I also add a few more rough chopped onions, and a few cloves of garlic, just peeled smashed.  Rosemary, thyme, and a couple bay leaves, and a good dash of pepper.  If you can always strain the sauce into a bowl for serving to get these extras out and leave only the au jus.

I also sear my roast before adding it to the slow cooker.  Just rub it on all sides with some salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme, and then sear each side of the meat in a hot pan with a little oil.  Takes about 10 extra minutes of extra prep but helps seal in those juices to the meat.  Also, like any beef, let it rest for a 5-10 min before you cut it so all those juices don't just go spilling out.  Favorite bread for this a crusty ciabatta bun, with provolone melted on top.  YUM!

Super tender.  Needs a stronger beef flavor in the jus.  Maybe add two cubes of herb ox.  I did not put in the beer, I did double the French oinion soup.  But overall delicious.

Tastes fantastic!  I used twice as much of everything (minus the beer) just to have a little more dip.  Meat was tender & I stuffed myself silly.  I would suggest a good horseradish sauce (we prefer it to be very hot).  My boy loves to put ketchup on his ;)

This was yummy.  I used Guiness extra dark.  The au jus was very rich and tasty.  As an aside, the meat is un-sliceable because it is so tender it just shreds when you cut into it.

Love this awesome recipe. If roasts weren't so expensive, I'd make this more often. One tip, is you can use the juice, sauce, au jus (whatever you want to call it) for French Onion Soup afterwards.

I love this recipe and it's an easy favorite for the family. Instead of using beer though, I substitute Burgundy and use a can of Beef Consume. I also add about 1-2 tablespoons of garlic to this dish. When the meat is almost all cooked I cut it up/shred it and let it simmer in the juices more. Once we're ready to eat I toast the buns, put the meat on them, then add provolone cheese on top and reinsert them in the oven until the cheese melts. My husband loves it and we always have more for leftovers the next day.

Super easy. Always a hit. You can doctor it up with a few garlic cloves (just leave whole) some hot pepper (flakes or canned or fresh) but it just never fails. It really only tastes "beery" if you use an IPA or something with a lot of hops. Good with cheap beer or a stout.

This was absolutely delicious. For two, I used a two pound roast and cut the ingredients in half. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt and pepper. Will definitely make again! Yummy!

I don't eat beef but I make this for my beef-loving family and they give it five stars. They say the meat is tender and very tasty, and I like that it's easy to put together for them! Like other reviewers I add a bit of fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder to the roast after pouring in the liquid ingredients. We usually serve it with steak fries and a green salad!

I have made  this exactly as written several times, and I NEVER change a thing, just so delicious! Two bonuses, makes your home smell amazing and makes your tummy very happy!! Great with provolone too, but certainly not necessary! Thank you for such a great recipe!

Really good! I would only use half the beer (quench your own thirst with the other half :). My entire family enjoyed this! Good soul food! Pair with some hard buns and you've got yourself a tasty meal!

Very easy to make!  I put some slits in the meat and inserted slivers of garlic.  I also didn't have time to let it cook for hours and hours, so cooked it on high for 4.5 hours.  Served it on toasted buns spread with garlic butter.

Amazing and restaurant like!  Took suggestion of others and used 1 can beef broth, 1 packet Lipton Onion Soup, Guinness beer, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.  Buttered rolls with some garlic powder and wrapped and baked in 350 oven for about 10-15 minutes.  Assembled sandwich with beef, sautéed onions and topped with provolone cheese.  Wrapped sandwich and returned to oven for about 5 minutes.  Au Jus gravy on the side.  Delicious!!!!!

This was pretty good and I loved how easy it was.  The only thing I had to change was I added some extra beef buillion to the sauce at the end because I found it just a tad on the bland side. Still a great easy dinner with that quick fix.

I followed the instructions of others with regards to adding onion/garlic powder, S&P & Worcestershire Sc.  I also cut it up about an hour before serving and let it sit/simmer in the juice.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't change much -- except I rubbed the roast in a mixture of salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting it in the slow cooker. For the beer, I used Guinness. I cooked the meat (3.5 lbs) for about 8 hours on low. Meat was extremely tender and flavorful.  I also added a slice to provolone cheese about 5 minutes into the 10-minute bake  time for the Italian rolls. So good and so easy. I will make this again.

Made it twice.  It was highly praised each time.  I could not find the condensed french soup, so I used a onion soup in a packet.  I did add minced garlic and some seasoning-pepper, salt and Penzey's Pot Roast spice.  Also added Johnny's French Dip sauce at the end.  I used sirloin tip as suggested by another reviewer.

Great base recipe! I made a few changes. I started by adding salt and pepper to the roast and searing it on all sides. When I threw it in the cooker with the liquids I also added minced garlic,  rosemary, thyme,  and a couple dashes of worcestershire. I cooked in high for four hours then removed the roast,  sliced it up and returned it to the slow cooker on low for another two hours. Came out fabulous, the whole family loved it!

I have made this several times and each time it was great. The meat can be browned with some flower before cooking but is not necessary. I added one onion chopped and about 5 cloves of garlic. No real need for salt since the beef broth and French onion soup provides that. Adding pepercini's for a topping makes a great roast beef French dipped sandwhich. Some people might like horseradish too. This recipe is very easy and a no fail.

Holy French Dip!! This was so good I'm already looking forward to the next time I make it! 

I used a craft beer, Firestone 805. I also added about 3 cut up garlic cloves and fresh cracked pepper to the slow cooker and at the end I added a little more salt because I felt like it needed it. Then I shredded the meat in the crock pot and let the meat sit in the juice while I toasted the buns. Then I put the meat, some grilled onions I made, and some provolone cheese  on the buns and let it melt for 5 more minutes in the oven. Yum, yum...Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Easy to make and my family raved about the dip. Instead of using a can of onion soup I used a package of dry onion soup mix and put more beef broth to get the right amount of liquid.

I cooked it until I could shred the meat. Also I used soda instead of beer because I don't drink so I don't buy alcohol. I used Campbell's French onion soup and beef consomme. I also added beefy onion soup packet and cream of asparagus. It was tasty.

I made this with just the few additions others had suggested. Rubbed  with garlic powder and pepper. Added 2 Tabls. Kitchen bouquet and the beers used was Guinness . The meat was an 4 lb. eye of round roast! Didn't think it was tender after 7 hours but probably was. Cooked for 8 hours  rested for 10 sliced then returned to pot for 30. Excellent

It was fairly good, I did cheat and make French onion soup the previous day so I used the leftovers from that instead of the canned stuff.  I cut up the meat, as suggested from others, and let it rest in the mixture on warm for about an hour before serving, I know if I had just served it immediately it would have been very tough but allowing it to cool in the broth made it very tender.  I made my own rolls but that is a different recipe all together.  Next time I will have to add a bit of port to make the broth more au jus like.  All in all it was good.

I liked the ease of making this, but there was definitely something missing, as it lacked flavor and was bland.  Maybe the meat should be seasoned or some seasoning needs to be added to the broth?  I'd be interested in hearing from anyone else who made this, as I did not modify any of the ingredients.

We really liked it! I have an old slow cooker and often when I do a roast in it it comes out overdone, but 7 hours on low for this recipe was perfect. I could not find condensed French onion soup so I just used onion dry mix and I mixed with the beer then poured over the meat.

I used red wine instead of beer and some fresh herbs in the crock pot - OH YUM. I ended up using Top Roast and the meat literally fell apart after 7 hours.

Great!  Used sirloin tip roast.  Added a couple tablespoons Worchestire sauce, dashes of garlic salt, salt and pepper.  Used brat buns from the deli.  Broiled for a couple minutes with butter and mozzarella cheese.  Next time I want to add onions to sauce and cook with roast.

OMG! This was so SO tasty. I added ingredients from other reviewers. Sprinkled rump roast with garlic powder and pepper. Added a packet of au jus mix. that's it. Served on buttered hoagie buns, broiled and added provolone. I did strain out the onions from the onion soup for my son , but either way, it was incredible!!!!

Found this to be mediocre at best.  Made it as written, with a good, dark, beer, and the flavour of the au jus was lacking.

this was SO bland and the texture of the meat was like stringy...tried tri tip sirloin cut as suggested and it was a gross texture for sandwiches.  Peeved I spent 20+ bux on just the protien for this only to be severely disappointed all around. I'm majorly confused as to how this recipe is receiving any positive reviews as the recipe is executed as it is written.

My store didn't have any french onion soup so instead I doubled beef broth and added a sliced onion and grated a clove of garlic.  When I served it I put a melted a slice of swiss on the roll first.

I gave it an extra star because it very easy to make an forget. Other than that it's very boring. I mean, it tastes like beef but even the broth doesn't bring me to make it again. Maybe if i changed the recipe like all the other 5 star ratings on here it'd be great. But why not post your own recipe at that rate? Heck I think even adding provolone would've helped. No thanks, not again.

This is probably the best french I have ever eaten. I sauted the onions and mushroom seperately from the meat, then turned iut wonderfully. Next time I will add some green pepper. As recommended, I added 1 Tb of worchestershire sauce and added from garlic salt to the meat before I added the liquid. Add it with a side of tator tots and coleslaw. I will definately make this again.

Wow! This turned out fabulous. I always have horrible luck with slow cooker recipes and the meat getting tough so I cooked mine in a Dutch oven at 300 degrees for a few hours. The meat was falling apart! The only change I made was that I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and then seared it so it was nice and brown.

Kind of bland as written.  Ended up adding Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper and then returning the meat to the liquid after slicing.  The sandwiches turned out ok.

Amazing.  I opted out for the beer due to the kiddos substituted a packet of aujus seasoning and a beef broth can of water.  I have tried several times with whatever beef roast is on sale.  Everyone loves it even the kids.  They call it Arby's at home.

A little saltier than we like but very easy and the beef got quite tender. Kids didn't like the Au jus as much as another recipe on here I couldn't find, but this recipe is easier.

Really dried out meat. I will say, the flavor was decent. Maybe wrong cut of meat? Nevertheless, won't try again.

Absolutely amazing.  I've made this several times and everyone loves it, including our kids.  My daughter begs to take the leftovers for school lunch the next day.   I've learned, the darker the better.  Dark beer, good quality balsamic vinegar (I make my own french onion soup), etc.  This makes for the best Au Jus.  I also buy good quality french rolls from a bakery.  This recipe deserves the very best.

Followed recipe exactly except for using a chuck roast and adding garlic powder as others suggested. Splurged on a Modelo for the beer. We didn't find this recipe "bland" at all and the toasted buttered buns made the sandwiches "melt in your mouth" (hubby's words). Next time I'll use a different cut of meat as the chuck did make the juice fatty. Thanks for a simple, excellent recipe!

I make this often and follow the recipe exactly.   I use only MGD beer, every other kind has not worked well.  I use provolone cheese and put out an assortment of mustards, pickles,  and horseradish sauce for everyone to pick from.   I also give everyone their own small bowl of the au jus for dipping.  It is always a big hit.

Excellent - used heavy beer, water w/bouillon because no beef broth, used Campbell's beef gravy, 1 packet dried onion soup, used slow cooker, sliced like roast beef. 
Toasted the rolls. Just wonderful!! more than enough juice, can use more for soup.

Made it exactly as directed, - the beer I used was Guinness. I love when recipes are simple yet come out delicious as is. 
I've made this recipe multiple times and sometimes I add a little garlic and fresh sliced onions, but there really is no need. This recipe is great! It's one of my regulars now!

This is delicious and super easy. I used a 2.5lb chuck roast that I rubbed down with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and olive oil. I let it rest for about 20 minutes and put it in the crock pot with a stout , a splash of worchestire sauce, and the other ingredients listed. I didn't have a can of beef broth, so I used 1.25 cups water and 2 beef bullion cubes. I sliced the meat thin and then let it cook for about another hour in the au jus. Hubby put it on the rolls with provolone and broiled them. They were phenominal. Will definitely make again and again.

The overall flavor was good.  My favorite part about the recipe was the simplicity.  The main issue I had with it was that the meat was a bit dry.  You're dipping it in au jus, so that's not a huge deal, but I think the cooking time needs to be lessened.

This recipe was great . I used beef consome per other reviewers , instead of beef broth and cut rump roast in half per reviews, after trimming excess fat off and beer per recipe. When I got home after it cooked all day in crockpot felt something was missing , added pkg of dry onion soup mix.  Yummy . Served on toasted sub rolls w melted provolone  and such jus on the side . Dee licious !!!

I will make this again, but using a Chuck Roast instead of the bottom round I used. 7 hours in, on low, it was dry and like a rock. I wasn't honestly sure that it would be salvageable, but I took it out, let it rest and cut it very thin, threw it back in the crock pot for another hour.  It ended up turning out fine, but like I said, I would use Chuck next time. I used a full can of Yuengling and did add some seasonings, like fresh Thyme and Garlic. The Au Jus that this made was delicious! It is a keeper

I give it a 5 for easy, but a 3 for taste.  I'm not a fan of the beer and the can of french onion condensed gives it a funny flavor.  I will likely make it again, but the recipe needs some modification

Made as directed. The meat came out perfect. The au jus sauce tasted waaaay too much like beer. Beer is fine and all, but I want a beef au jus, not a beer dip.

Next time I will cook it the same way but with way less beer or maybe no beer at all.

My entire family loves this recipe.  I follow the recipe fairly closely when I make it.  I use Rolling Rock for the beer.  I butter the rolls and place provolone cheese on them, then place in the oven to toast before serving.  Excellent.  I have made this recipe at least 5 - 10 times.

I went by the recipe for the most part, used a spoon roast and a red beer. The only thing I would recommend is to add beef bullion it will definitely add to the juice and flavor of the beef.

Our family loved this recipe.  We have made it several times and I have taken the advice of several others and use the following;
Cambells consume and french onion soup, heavy beer, and I add one tsp of Worcestershire and melt this slices of garlic provolone cheese. Plus I slice the beef and return it to the juice for 1/2 hr. YUMMY!

I've made something quite similar for a few years. Mine differs in that I add one envelope of Italian dry seasoning mix. Have never used beer but imagine it can't hurt. Probably will try the beer next time. Great party food served with sliced onions, bell peppers and pepperoncini on the side so guests can choose what they want.  Also provide small bowls for au jus.

This was amazing! I read many of the reviews and took the advice to season the roast. I used a chuck roast, seasoned both sides with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and worcestershire sauce. I used a can of cambells french onion soup, cambells beef consomme, and a bottle of guiness. I cut up a french bread loaf, toasted it under the broiler, added meat and provolone cheese, back under the broiler for a few minutes and there you have it! My husband is extremely picky when it comes to french dips and he LOVED this. Just dipping pieces if the french bread in the au jus was delicious ! Will definitely make this again!

I made this as directed with the exception of using a few dashes of  Worcestershire sauce to deepen the flavor and a packet of Au jus prepared as directed instead of French onion soup since it contains MSG which I am allergic to. We found it delicious and versatile, being able to switch up the sandwiches using different types of cheese and bread. We like crusty baguettes while our kids like soft rolls. My husband requests this often and it's great for a crowd, game day or when someone moves and you need food for your helpers.

I actually was looking for a way to use our goat meat and this was perfect. I did not use beer however and just used extra broth with a splash of Worcestershire sauce. It turned out delicious!

I rated this 4 stars because my meat alone seemed a bit dry.  However, served with the juice (dipping bowl for each person), this sandwich was delicious and oh, so easy to make. I rubbed the meat with about a clove of minced garlic and poured a 1/2 to 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce over the meat once it was in the slow cooker. I followed the advice of others and shredded the meat about 30 mins. before I was to serve it and put the shredded meat back in the warm juice for that extra time.  I will certainly be serving this again.

So easy and it was so good! I also added garlic, onion salt, minced onion and used Guiness for the beer. Once cooked, I sliced and added back into juice while I prepared the buns. I buttered both sides of the hoagie bun and put them in the oven for not quite 5 minutes to toast up. I then piled on the meat and added a few pieces of swiss and put back in the oven until cheese was melted. Both French Dip and Sauce had great flavor, but expected it to be a little saltier. I will season a bit more next time, but a hit at my house!

Have made this basic recipe many times - it's always a hit. Usually will also add onions and mushrooms to the broth to cook up and then add to the sandwiches. Usually I just use whatever beef cut is economical, and whatever beer I have on hand, and it's very hard to screw this recipe up. Depending on the stock you use though, you may need to add a little more salt, and pepper is always a great addition too.

This was delicious! The only thing I did different was rub the rump roast with spices before adding to crockpot. My boyfriends son who eats so slow and never has a direct answer (do you like this? I guess), ate as fast as us and when asked if he liked it he said yes. It was so good I can't wait for lunch tomorrow. So glad I found this.

This was fantastic!!!

After making this a few times, we have changed a couple of things (Trust me, we've made this  A LOT).

We add a beef bouillon because we find it lacks a bit of flavour without it.  I also use a package of Knorr's Dry Onion Soup because I can't find anything canned here in Ontario, Canada.

After the meat is pretty much cooked, we will take it out, cut it up and put it back in for another hour or two so that it can soak up more of the juice.

We've never had an issue where the meat has gotten dry.

My son who is 6 is the one who asks for the "Beer Dip" all the time lol

Followed instruction as is for the first night; it was okay. For leftovers the following night, I thickened it up by adding a little corn starch slurry and a dash of liquid smoke flavor before adding the shredded meat back in. It was amazing!!! Repurposed to pulled brisket sandwich with melted mozzarella! Mmmmmm

Very tender and tasty. The only change we made was to place onion slices and crushed garlic cloves under the roast. Our roast was only two and a quarter pounds but we used all of the liquid called for in the recipe. The sandwiches were wonderful and we have super tasty au jus left that we will be using as a base for French Onion soup.   This will definitely get added to our meal rotation.!

I absolutely love the flavors that come together in this.  It is also super easy to make if you throw it in a crock pot.  The first time I made it I tried to use the roast...I will say I thought it was easier and better to buy sliced roast beef from the grocery deli and throw that in a crock pot all day with the rest!  Absolutely perfect with some horseradish sauce on top too!

Just great. Made it with the french onion soup recipe, cooked it in the oven instead of slow cooker for 7 hours at 100 deg C. I kept turning and basting every few hours. cooled, sliced and left it in the au jus overnight (along with the caramelized onions from the onion soup). sauteed mushrooms and peppers and piled them on the french bread, cheese (I used gouda) with the meat and onions. served with fries and au jus on the side. I offered some bbq sauce to add to the sandwich, but the meat turned out so well that no one wanted it. I'll definitely be making it again.

I've made this a couple of times with different roasts. I found the best roast to be beef chuck. The marbling of fat in this roast is a bit much, so you'll have to do some trimming after its cooked, but that adds to the flavor and makes this meat fork shred delicious!

DELICIOUS!! I'm not a fan of French Dip with au jus but wanted something different to try with my rump roast so I made these for my hubby. Omgosh am I glad I did, they were delicious! 
Make sure to make the changes suggested by Chef Mickey because I feel they enhanced the taste of the au jus - I made my own beef broth by mixing 4tbsp beef boullion granules (for a heavy beef broth) with hot water, make sure the bullion is fully dissolved, and then I poured it into the dark beer and dried onion soup mix prior to adding my spice rubbed rump roast to the crock pot. 
This recipe (again, with Chef Mickey's changes) made a new fan for French Dip sandwiches!! A new family favorite that I will be making many more times in the future!!

Awesome dish.  I've made it a dozen times, and my wife has liked it, but I did something different and she loved it.  First i used a hoppier beer, but I put it in the crock pot and let it soak over night in the fridge, cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 1/2 hours, then the last half hour, cut it up and let it soak some more. perfect.

I've made this several times. Particularly when I'm headed up the mountain to go snowboarding with my nieces and nephews. This is always a hit with them!

Perfect as is.  But as a 12 hour shift worker, I cooked it while away and then used two forks to shred before putting on toasted ciabattia rolls.... It was marvelous. My whole family loves it!

I have made this several times before. Always taste great. 1 change I make is I cook mine for about 14 to 16 hrs on low in a slow cooker. Roast is super tender and takes in all the flavor. I want to try others recommendations to use a few other spices.

Great recipe that takes only minutes to make! I have made this several times both following the directions and with modifications. Like others, I have added worcestershire sauce and minced garlic among other ingredients depending on our mood. We have made the sandwiches, but we have also put it over mashed potatoes and egg noodles as well. It is absolutely delicious!

This is such an easy recipe! I actually cooked it for around 9 hours on low, sliced it and turned my crock pot to warm. Worked out perfectly! Such an easy fix it and forget it recipe!  The only thing i changed was I added some seasoning salt and garlic.

This is good.  I really like the idea of buttering the bread prior to adding the meat.  I was unable to find gluten free french onion soup so I just used a smaller amount of meat, one can of beef broth and one bottle of beer.

As written, the meat was rather bland (although I had subbed beer for root beer because that's what I had).  After cutting up the meat, I threw in some Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt and put the meat back in the slow cooker while I got the buns ready.  That did the trick!  They were amazingly delicious served with cheese!

This is one of my favorite recipes and it's super easy too!  As previous reviewed suggested, I use a chuck roast, about a 1/3 c of Worcestershire sauce, freshly cracked pepper, I used beef consommé, 2 cans of French onion soup and 1 bottle of Shinerbock beer. I also did not have any provolone so I used Munster cheese instead. This is always a crowd pleaser!

My family loved it!  I've made it 3 times.  Twice with domestic light beer and once with Sam Adams.  The difference may be subtle, but the family raved over it with the light beer.  They didn't say much one way or the other with the Sam Adams.  Will make it again and again!

Wish I could give this more stars!! I just made this tonight and it was absolutely amazing! After reading reviews I made a couple changes. I used a round bottom roast that I sprinkled garlic and onion powder on last night. I then started it this morning and let it cook for about 9 hours. I used Beef Consomme, French Onion Soup, and Guiness Beer with a splash of Worcestershire Sauce. When it was ready I buttered some French Rolls and put them in the oven for a sec to brown a little bit, then I took them out and put the meat and provolone cheese on them and put it back in the oven until the cheese melted and served it with the juice. De-freakin-licous! The hubby LOVED it too!!!

Excellent! Didn't have any beer so I used regular coke. I also used chuck roast, rubbed with onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary and salt and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Didn't get home in time to slice the meat so instead shredded it in the juices (actually it shredded itself) and piled it on freshly baked fresh bread baguettes toasted with swiss cheese. The wife said it was the best French Dip she's ever had!

This was good and easy. I also used Chucked Roast instead. It was about half the cost and cooked faster. The recipe called for 4lb of meat. I only used 2 and I still had food left over. I used the left over meat to make tacos! Double Score! :)

This was the easiest version of a french dip sandwich I have seen. I put the meat and the liquid ingredients in the pot before I left for work. When I came home the meat was super tender and practically falling apart. I took the meat out and torn it apart with two forks and put it back in the broth to soak. I added a pinch of garlic salt, garlic powder, and some salt. It was DELICIOUS and a must try again!

I don't use the beer in this. I use the french onion soup, beef consomme (just a little richer than broth), and I add some worcestshire, garlic powder or salt, and pepper. SOOOOO GOOD and super easy. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

One of my favorite sandwiches. I served on hogie buns that I basted with melted butter and microwaved for a few seconds. Then I added the meat, and covered with slices of gouda cheese. Used the au jus to dip them in. Yummy

OMG so good! Made this yesterday. Followed the recipe with the exception of substituting Beef Consomme for the the Beef broth and only using a 2 lb roast. I also seasoned the roast with salt, pepper and garlic.This was fabulous. My house smelled so good all day. And the flavors just burst on my tongue. Wonderful recipe!

Made this recipe,  but instead of beer used a dry white wine and added a dash of garlic salt. It was devoured! Will definitely be making this one again!

These were very good!  I made some changes based on other reviews: I added 1 beef bouillon cube, some garlic power, onion powder, Worcestershire, and 2 minced garlic cloves, and used a dark beer.  My hubby didn't think the meat had a ton of flavor, but the sauce definitely did!  Will make again!

I just didn't think the slow cooker was the right way to cook the meat, I prefer just buying the meat at the deli and making my own juice from broth.

I've made it so many different times--it's very good with any added spices of your taste (I've tried, garlic, fennel, bay leaves are greeeeat in it). So affordable and yummy! The meat is a lot like pot roast (if you slow cook pot roast) and very yummy.  If you like to just follow a recipe w/o adding your own touch, maybe it could be considered bland, but honestly I think it's great---especially on fresh french bread! Husband and toddler approved by my family!

I made this recipe last night.  My husband, whose favourite sandwich is a beef dip, told me it's the best he's ever had.  The meat was so tender that it shredded instead of sliced, and, following some of the recommendations in the reviews, I put it back in the au jus until we were ready to eat (it was about an hour instead of 30 minutes).  The au jus is freaking amazing too.

So disappointed!  This was so bland.  I seasoned my rump roast with salt, pepper and garlic powder then followed the recipe as written and after realizing how tasteless it was I added some beef boullion, onion powder and fresh garlic.  Still pretty boring.  Not sure what I did or didn't do - but will not try this one again.

I wanted to be able to slice the meat, not shred it so I used a sirloin tip roast. That worked well. It was tender and delicious. I was disappointed in the jus though. I followed some of the other users suggestions and used 2 cans of beef consume, a packet of dried onion soup mix, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire. But I thought it needed a little more onion tang flavor. I'll try the french onion soup in a can next and see if that's the ticket. Other than that is was very delicious!

Easy is an understatement but so good! I did not realize we ran out of beer and I used chicken broth instead. At first, I was worried it might be too salty with 3 different broth/soups, but it turned out really good after all. Thank you for such a simple but delicious French dip recipe. I have been looking around for one for a while now and i think I have found THE one for us.

I made this for supper tonight, I used New Belgium 1554 beer, 1 10oz. can of Beef Consumme, 1 clove of garlic, and pepper. I sauted onions and mushrooms, toasted buttered kaiser rolls with provolone cheese melted under the boiler.  I sliced the roast two hours before dinner and turned the slow cooker to low.  The meat was immersed in the juice, it was a superb dinner and so easy to make.  It was added into the rotation of dinners.

Absolutely wonderful!  I've made this several times and have never been disappointed.  I use only about 8 oz of a dark beer (really makes the au jus terrific).  I add the following seasonings to the roast before cooking: minced garlic, black pepper, Worcestershire, and a dash or Kitchen Bouquet.  When the roast is finished I remove from the cooker and let it rest before slicing.  After I slice it, I dip the meat back into the cooking liquid of the crock.  Then I lift it out with a slotted spoon onto sliced french bread that are arranged on a baking sheet.  I add provolone cheese to the top and slide under the broiler until the cheese begins to brown.  Strain the au jus and you are ready to eat.  Garlic steak fries are good served with this meal.  This is favorite meal in my household!  I love making it.

My husband and I strictly abstain from alcohol. So when I first saw this recipe I was ready to pass it over. however, when I read the review this said a Teetatoler cannot tell the presence of alcohol I thought I would go ahead with  it.  I used Foster's beer,after it had cooked for seven hours my husband walked in, took a bite and said, "does this have beet in it?" That being said he absolutely loved it. It really was a delicious, however I don't think I'll make it again due to the alcohol.

I made this and it's a hit with my pregnant wife. Her taste has changed so much in the last couple months and it's hard to tell what she can eat that day. I made a couple adjustments like most. I used a 2 pound top round and added garlic powder, salt, pepper and a couple dashes of worcestershire. I used just under a pint of an american pale ale that I had in the fridge. I sliced it then put it back for an hour and the flavor is on!!! Can't wait to make it again!

Sadly, I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe initially but found there was real lack of flavor.  I ended up adding garlic, salt, pepper, thyme and bay leaf.  The broth just didn't pack enough punch.  It needed more depth perhaps using beef consomme would have been better?  The beef itself was bland.  I added salt to the beef once it was on the bun.  I toasted the buns which was nice and melted provolone as well.  My family always comments on new recipes but no one said anything about this; nothing.  I won't be making this again.

I was quite surprised by this!  After reading all the reviews and the modifications people did to it, I was worried that if I didn't make any changes it might not be as good.  But I followed the recipe exactly as stated, used a New Castle for the beer, and it was YUMMY!!

Used many of the recommendations by other reviewers. I typically use only a name brand soup & broth in this recipe. It does cost a little more but your end product tastes better. I had to call a friend to ask what kind of beer we should use because we do not drink alcohol at our house. I have used a well known Boston Lager many times and it seems to work the best. Leftovers freeze pretty good.

I don't consume alcohol so the beer taste stood out. I also added the kitchen bouquet, some pepper and salt to taste and some dashes of onion and garlic. Perhaps a can of beef consommé would temper the beer taste.

I made this in my pressure cooker and it took only 40 minutes!! I couldn't find condensed fr. onion soup so I just used a can of regular soup and omitted the beer. Also added a little water and a beef bouillon cube. Yummy! Most definitely will make again.

This was absolutely delicious and the dip was wonderful. I browned the meat before putting it in the crock pot and toasted the buns in a skillet with some butter and garlic salt.  Add choice of sliced cheese before serving.  No need to look for another recipe. Gloria

EXCELLENT flavors!  I did not have French onion soup, so I used a French onion soup packet along with another 2 cups of broth.  I also added a tsp of rosemary to it.  We topped these with sautéed portabella's, onions and mozzarella cheese!  DEFINITELY will be making these again!

This was very easy and the au jus it makes was so good!  I used a rump roast but I think a different cut of meat would have been better.  The rump roast shredded instead of sliced and was a bit tough.  I cooked mine on low for 5 hours and it was done...I think 7 would be way too long.  I used a can of Michelob Lite (that was the only beer in the fridge that my husband wouldn't disown me for using in a meal) and added about 7 shakes of Worcestershire sauce and a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder to the meat.  I served over rolls that I toasted slightly in the oven.  I also added some mozzarella to a few of the sandwiches.  Yummy!

Everyone in the family really liked the sandwiches.  Had to use hoaggie buns and we added cheese to the sandwiches.   We really were not too keen on the dipping sauce.  I could taste the beer ( and I am not a fan of beer).  So I would like to make again and change the cooking method.  But... overall, the recipe, as is, was easy to make, smelled great and tasted good.

We just made these sandwiches last night. I actually shredded the meat with two forks since it was falling apart because it was so tender. My boys were reluctant to try it, after convincing them to just take a taste, they went nuts! Its very hard for my wife and I to find meals that all of our kids will eat. so when we find one, we make sure to keep it, this is one of those recipes!

Good starter recipe. We enjoyed it but felt it needed something more.  I did put garlic powder and onion powder on the meat before cooking.  May try some minced garlic in the juice next time.

It was a lil bland.. So i added about about two more cups of beef broth-cut some onions up and added poultry seasoning. Def. made it taste soooo much better. French rolls are def. a MUST with this sandwich!

Wow that was good!  I am not usually a big roast beef fan, and my family are not big meat eaters, so I was a bit leery of how this would turn out.  SO glad I took a chance on this--it was yum!  It was also incredibly easy--just put it in before I left for work, came home at lunch and turned it down, chowed down for dinner.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. My 7 and 3 year old loved it.  We served them on fresh baked french bread (from frozen package) and it was delicious. Next time I want to use provolone cheese to enhance the meal.

Delicious and so easy!!!! I used beef consomme, garlic and used a dark beer. The flavor turned out wonderful!!! I also ended up using a chuck roast, as this was all my grocery store had available, and I loved the way it turned out. The beef just shredded into little bite size pieces on its own, not pre-cutting necessary!

My grocery store didn't have the rump roast, so I used steak that was on sale and it turned out very well, except that it cooked faster than I thought. I'll try it again when I can get a roast.

Awesome, quick and easy recipe.  I used a Tri Tip Roast which does not slice but becomes a pulled style sandwich.  I also added garlic clove, used Consume, and added a pinch of rosemary.  The Au Ju was really tasty.  I may add a bit of pepper next time but overall it was delicious and will make again.

Awesome, easy, delicious! Honesty, I was afraid to use a whole roast on this in case it didn't go well, but after reading reviews, figured what the heck! I've made it several times and the family loves it! My 10 year old son said grace at dinner tonight and part of it was "...thank you that mom found this recipe on the internet because we all love it." Need I say more?

Really good... makes so much that you have PLENTY of left overs. My family ate off of this for several meals. I would suggest adding a little Worcestershire Sauce, we used Guinness and definitely using meat tenderizer. Overall, delicious. :-)

Awesome! The rump roast did not cut like expected, but rather shredded. Still trying to figure if i used the right meat, a top round roast. Use Guinness and extra seasonings onion powder, garlic powder, minced garlic, salt, pepper and add kitchen boquet browning sauce to the crock pot mix.

I'm giving this four stars because I had to add seasoning to it to make it really taste good. Now, I did have to substitute the condensed french onion soup for a onion soup packet so that may have made a difference. 
I got some sourdough hoagies, buttered them and then put them in the oven with some provolone on them to get them all melty and gooey. 
They did turn out very yummy. I used a chuck roast which I don't think I would do again - I would probably use a leaner roast because my chuck roast had some fat on it that I wasn't able to trim off until it fell apart.

Aside from adding a couple spices to the liquid that I add to every recipe and putting cheese on the buns, I didn't change a thing!! This is amazing and I will never look for another French dip recipe ever, and I think any roast would work, I've used beef arm roast and chuck roast so far and both turned out soooo tasty!!

Oh my....these were absolutely perfect!  I had to work late and had a house full of guys to feed, so I threw this in the crock pot, left out the rolls for them and they all loved it.  Easy to make, smelled amazing and tasted even more amazing.  Perfect recipe for a busy day!  :)

I work for a brewery so this was a great recipe for our nutbrown ale! A definite family favorite even with my child who hates meat! We had left overs so I froze them and we had it on a night I just wanted a quick dinner and it was just as good! I will definitely add it to my freezer recipes.

This was delicious! I used a rump roast that I trimmed, and for the beer I used Newcastle. I added one clove fresh chopped garlic and about a tsp of liquid smoke. I took french rolls split in half and lightly dipped them in the juices and placed them on a hot non stick pan an placed a lid smaller than the pan to slightly squish the bread and trap the steam from the juices to steam the bread for a minute or two. AMAZING. I used provalone cheese also :) So easy!!

This was pretty good for what it is. I rarely if ever slow cook meat but I wanted something cozy that day. And that's what this meal is, cozy. The leftovers were made into hash, and beef gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. I think that's the reason I liked it as much as I did. Nice leftovers! Thank you much! :o)

This is a wonderful "french dip". The only change I made was to add a slice of Sargento's provolone cheese on top the beef. Pop the sandwich in the oven until the cheese melts. Happy dipping!

I have made this twice now. Like other reviewers I added garlic powder, onion salt, Worcestershire sauce and used Guinness beer. Rave reviews from the family both times, and could not have been easier to fix.

Made this twice so far. Add garlic powder to butter to make garlic butter. Also add provolone slices to bread to melt. The au jus is so amazing and savory! We get the day old bread from Jimmy Johns for $1 for this recipe. Will be making this a lot! :D

I used a chuck roast - advised by the butcher because it shreds easier and is tastier because of the fat though I did cut out as much fat as possible. I followed a lot of the additions that were mentioned - it was very tasty!! Even my son who is a great cook thought it was one of the best sandwiches he has eaten!! It's a tradition to have RB dip sand. at our Christmas gathering - no more buying prepared beef (that sold for $9. - $10. a lb.) I got the chuck roast on sale for $3.29 a lb. and it was much tastier!! Thanks lonwolf32 & all the reviewers!!

Not quite sure I'd call this a French Dip.  That being said, my two youngsters liked it; one called it a home run; the other stating, "I thought it would be a strike out, but its a triple." Pretty high praise from two picky eaters.  I liked it, it just wasn't what I expected  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved the juice.  I used the Brazilian Cheese Bread recipe on allrecipes instead of french bread since it's gluten free and super easy.  :)

This was fabulous!  So easy and deeeeelish!  I couldn't find a rump roast so I used a boneless cross rib roast per the butcher's advice.  Worked out great.  Will definitely make this one again!

This would have been 5 stars but I added things not on the recipe. Even with my alterations I thought it needed a little salt or other seasoning when eating it, but my husband advises not to add any extra seasoning to the pot since you can always add more seasoning at the end but you can't unseason it. 

From advice of other reviewers, I added:
1 T worcestershire, 1/2 t onion powder & 1/2 t garlic powder.

I wanted a whole meal out of it so I also added skinned halved red potatoes & baby carrots (whole, except thick ones I cut in half) to cook for last 4 hours. It was the perfectly cooked. Glad I'd read advice on a few pot roast recipes before making this. (They said if the veggies cook the entire day with the roast they get mushy.)

My husband is the cook, I fail miserably usually. He makes everything great & competed in BBQ competitions for years. Last time I tried a french dip crockpot recipe he wouldn't even try it. But the aroma when he got home from this one hooked him. He went back for thirds, then drank the juice left on the plate, then went back to get the onion pieces with a fork! Our one year old made "mmmm" noises when eating the veggies, which she has never done before. I'd say it was a success!

Fabulous!!!!  My family loved this.  Even my picky eater who "hates" beef.  They begged me to make it again - SOON. I mades a few changes based on reviews.  Salted and peppered the rump roast.  I added 2 tbls of garlic powder & 2 tbls worcetshire.  I sprinked garlic salt on the buttered bread and added provolone cheese.
Served the leftovers over egg noodles with brown gravey.  Another hit!  Getting two meals out of one roast is a home run for me! Thanks for the recipe and all the tips that made it great.

Made this for a family birthday party.  Super simple, super easy, and ready when scheduled.  It was also a crowd pleaser.  We had plenty left over, too!  The only drawback is having five unopened beers left in the house.

This is the easiest, yummiest and most versatile recipe ever!  We had it on sourdough baguette two nights in a row, and I'm serving it again tonight with mushrooms over noodles with a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I stress the 3 nights in a row because my husband doesn't eat leftovers--or rather he didn't used to!

very easy and delicious.  I did not get the can of french onion soup but used 2 cans of beef broth, 1 corona, and 2 packs of onion soup mix and it was very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

I took the recommendations used chuck roast, crushed garlic, sliced onion, and worcestershire.   Easy, delicious, and kid-approved.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except for slicing/shredding the roast approx 1 hour before serving and putting back in the crock with the au jus.  I topped with sliced swiss and optional sauteed peppers and onions.  The au jus was really yummy.  Everyone enjoyed these and even my 3 year old granddaughter got in on the dipping action!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, lonwolf32!

Wasn't crazy about it.  Was expecting a french dip flavor.  It tasted like what it was-a roast on french rolls. Dip wasn't bad, but again, not like traditional french dip.  Will stick with my usual recipe from now on.

I made these sandwiches for my husband's men's group.  They absolutely LOVED them!!  I also sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on the beef, used 1/2 a bottle of beer and added worcestershire sauce.  On the buttered buns, I sprinkled a mozzarella provolone mix.  I must confess, I am a vegetarian, but one of his friends said that I must secretly eat meat, because no vegetarian could make a beef sandwich this good!!!

I thought this was going to taste like beer.  It did not.  It was very yummy.  I just used the beer we had on hand which was Budwiser.  Other then that I follow the direction the way they were stated.

This was incredible!  I did just what he recipe called for, the only thing I added was some montreal steak seasoning that I sprinkled on the roast before adding the broth.  I sliced it and put it back inthe juices as was recommended, and toasted french baguette style bread cut in half and then broiled with mozzarella cheese as was also recommended.  I used a sirlion tip roast, 3lbs, as that is what I had in my freezer.  Again, this turned out phenomonal!

This recipe as is I give 4 stars.  Some of the tweeks I have made are adding Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and making the broth from beef bullion.  I use dry french onion soup mix, garlic and add some water.  I just change it to my family's taste. This was a great starting place.

I made these with chuck roast & per other reviewers, sprinkled with onion & garlic powder and about a tablespoon of worchestire suace. Only took about 5 minutes to pour in French Onion Soup, Beef Broth and bottle of beer.

Wish I used condensed onion soup as it calls for because it was lacking salt. This is a heavier meal so my husband and I were REALLY full afterwards. Maybe try half of a sandwich with a salad, especially if it's for lunch!

I followed "COOKINKIWI"'s changes exactly, except I used a trimmed 4 lb chuck roast, and it was a real winner in our house.  My family is usually very skeptical of slow-cooker meals (deservedly so, I'm afraid), but this was absolutely delicious.  This will go into the rotation!

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe does not call for any salt or pepper.  So, I rubbed the roast down with both before putting it in the slow cooker.  Even with this, the Au Jus is not very salty, but it does have good flavor.

Next time I cook it, I will take the recommendation of other users and use a dark syrupy beer like Guinness.  I had a Bud Light on hand and used it, but the Au Jus was kind of weak and would have really benefited from a darker beer.

Otherwise...

The meat was really good and the toasting of the buns was a very nice touch.

I absolutely loved this. So easy and the flavor was great. I followed the recipe exactly except I used London Broil. It was on sale and the butcher said it was a good substitute. The meat basically fell apart, no need to slice. My husband couldn't eat it fast enough. I definitely will make this again. Next time, I think I will make French Onion soup out of the Au Jus like another user suggested.

Yummy!  Because I leave for work 12 hrs before we eat, my crock pot dishes always end up dried out.  With this I cooked it over night for 7 hrs and then cut it up in the morning and threw it in the fridge all day.  I reheated for about a 1/2 hour.  Nice and tender.

I used a strong craft ale and threw in a bay leaf and a sprig of fresh rosemary. I served it with melted havarti on a warm garlic baguette and a side of hearty potato ale soup. This meal was better than anything I've ever had in a pub!
Not bad at all considering most of the jus comes from canned sources. Easy and delicious!

This was so delicious!  I took other's advice, added 2 cans of Campbells consomme, a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, and I used an Irish Stout beer.  I also made a rub of garlic, onion salt/powder, sea salt, and crushed peppercorns.  For leftovers, we actually had these on the Hawaiin Rolls & oh my was it wonderful! The flavor of the beef w/the sweet of the roll was just so good and gave it an extra yum factor.  Next time I make this, we'll just put on the Hawaiin Rolls.

Very good!  The selection was limited at the supermarket where I got the roast (I believe I got top round roast) and it was somewhat dry but the au jus made up for the dryness.  Definately would make again but with a better cut of roast!

This was a super easy recipe! I love that it took only a few ingredients to make this wonderful meal. The juice was good for dipping. It was a hit with the family, and we went back for more! I even made french bread and we served on those. Much better than the store bought french dip.

This was good but lacked in seasoning. Could've had a bit more taste, we are from the Louisiana and we are used to more seasoning. I'll try again but will season meat and use a golden mushroom soup by Campbell's. I'll keep u posted!

This is pretty good and very simple to make.  The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you CAN taste and smell the beer when it's done.

This was not what I was expecting -- more like a pot roast than french dip.

This is such a fantastic recipe! My husband and I have tried this with many different types of beer and they are all equally delicious. The onion soup makes the house smell divine. Use a good hearty/crusty roll, it makes a difference!

Based on all the reviews, I expected to really love this....but I didn't. I followed the recipe, exactly, but found it somewhat bland tasting. I used to make a similar dish where you rubbed the outside of the roast with mustard, but I can't remember what else went in the crock. I do remember really loving it, though. Guess I'll try and locate that recipe next time.

OMG!  This is awesome.  Made it exactly as directed and it was marvelous.  We may try a slice of provolone on the sandwich next time, but that would be totally optional.  It was GREAT without adding a thing.

This was a big hit with my whole family (children included).  It is easy and quick to put together, and tasty to eat. 
The first time I made it I worked later than expected and it cooked longer than suggested.  Yet it still did not dry out.  This is a nice dinner to come home to.

Thanks so much for posting this. I love this recipe. It is a go to when we have company. I do add worcestershire sauce and a bit of garlic powder and I don't butter the bread because it tastes soggy to me. I also have tried different cuts of meat. My family's favorite is to use a pork loin (which is great because you can always find one on sale!) Also, Aunt Millie's makes a good french roll that holds up well with dipping. This has become our traditional Halloween meal:)

This is the best french dip roast beef that I have ever had. It is very easy to make and the aroma of it in the slow cooker all day made the house smell delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a super easy recipe.  We followed the recipe to a tee other than the kind of roast we used (we already had one in the freezer).  Used individual french loaves that were slightly toasted.  Will make again.

A hit with friends watching the football game! I added 1/2 t garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Selected french rolls and topped with provolone cheese. Will make again. I even had people take sandwiches home. Comments: Best Frenh dip they have ever had!

This was such a big hit!  I did make a few changes though.  I used vegetable broth because I didn’t have beef; I added a few shakes of onion power, Garlic power and Worcestershire sauce.   When I came home I sliced up the meat and throw it back in the sauce for another 30 minutes.  I buttered the rolls and sprinkled a little garlic power over the butter then added provolone cheese till it was melted.  My husband said it was restaurant quality!

Any slow cooker recipe that does not require an hour of pre-cooking gets a nod from me. This was terrific! Melt in your mouth beef, with lots of flavor. I browned an onion and topped with provalone, and even my picky eater loved it :)

I have made this quite a few times and have rave reviews, the only thing I change is I cook it in a pressure cooker cause it makes it super tender and quick. Also I make a garlic butter to put on the rolls YUMMY!

Exceptional!  I add garlic and sometimes I use a can of consomme...often I have forgotten the beer and really, no matter what I add or forget this ALWAYS turns out with a phenomenal flavor and texture. I use any left over meat in my moussaka or in a stew or soup. Also works well in a beef pot pie.  This recipe just can not be beat!  Thank you!

The recipe was easy to prepare before work and my husband and son who is 5 loved it.  The flavor was great.  I did add a little more beef broth then they asked for.  It was great!!  Also, we turned the bread into a garlic bread.  It added a little something.  We love our garlic.

Very good!  Made according to directions my first time for personal opinion.  I’m not a beer drinker but can taste the beer-I think it makes the recipe!  There are so many variations that can be done with this so I greatly appreciate lonwolf32 sharing!!

This recipe is great! I am a newlywed and was looking for a recipe that would impress my husband and give me an excuse to try out my crockpot.  This was a winner! He loved it and keeps telling everyone I'm a good cook!  I did add a little garlic and pepper like others suggested and melted havarti on the french bread, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Thanks for making me look good!

This was amazing.  I toasted the rolls and melted some provolone cheese on top, other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Definately a keeper.

This is DELISH!  I did everything exactly as described... I cooked for 7 hours in my crockpot overnight.  Then let cool for about 1 1/2 hours and then sliced with my electric knife.  I put it in a glass bowl with half of the cooking broth and warmed up in the microwave.  AWESOME!  I did add a dash of garlic powder and it was THE BEST BEEF I've EVER made!!

Excellent. I added red wine to the mix and the meat was so tasty. I also cut the meat, added to French rolls, covered in provolone cheese and put under the broiler before serving. So yummy.

I started out making this for my boyfriend and our just for two dinner (with leftovers) quickly turned into a gathering of 8 hungry people (with no leftovers. yikes!). This recipe did not fail, it was WONDERFUL. Even the pickiest eater in the house could not stop raving about it. The only change I made was I put some provolone on the sandwiches. Also used a really dark porter beer. Will make again!

Oh my gosh, my husband said these were the best ever french dip sandwiches he's ever eaten. I am taking another persons suggestion and adding cornstarch to the broth and putting meat and "gravy" over noodles for dinner tonight. Cant wait to try it.

I made this for the first time at a vacation house at the beach.  I threw a chuck roast into the cooker and added cambells beef consume and the french onion soup with garlic powder and onion powder and left for the beach. (I forgot to add the beer but I think it was great without it) When we returned I served on garlic bread with mozzarella cheese.  Out of this world!  Everyone loved it and I had to make it again during the week. I make it all the time now and with the leftovers I boil potatoes and carrots in the broth for a great beef stew.

Looked like a great recipe but something is missing.  I added some of the ingredients that others listed such as the spices, onions and garlic but still it is missing something.  Maybe it will be one of those recipes that is better the next day.

This is now my go to recipe for parties! The meat had so much flavor then dipping into the sauce made it just perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except I added some mozzarella cheese before putting it in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly, but did put the sliced beef back in the broth for about an hour after it had been sliced.  The roast was tender and had very good flavor.  Very nice recipe.

The slow cooking (8 hours) made my cheap rump roast very tender and delicious.  Minimal ingredients to a very yummy French Dip sandwich.  I strained the cooking liquid and it made a very tasy dipping sauce.  I served the strained onions on the side since my grandchildren dislike onions.

The Au jus was wonderful!  But I wasn't crazy about the rump roast.  The texture was off and it was difficult to slice thinly.  not sure how to correct that other than to roast the beef separately from the au jus.

Made the recipe exactly as written (for Super Bowl Sunday Dinner).  As written it was great.  Will try adding some minced garlic next time only because several other reviewers recommended it but otherwise would not change a thing.

I have never been brave enough to order a french dip sandwich in a restaurant so I was a bit nervous making this. Both my husband and I were shocked at how much we liked it. I took other reviewers suggestions and added a few shakes of garlic power, onion powder & worcestshire sauce to the meat. I also added cheese to the bread before toasting it. Delicious! Definitely a keeper!

I know people think that making lots of changes and then reviewing a recipe is wrong, but I made quite a few and these were some of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten; reminiscent of Portillos in Chicago.  I skipped the beer because I didn't have any, which may be why I needed to add other flavors.  Seasoned a chuck roast with spicy Montreal steak seasoning, added whole fresh mushrooms, a whole onion, two whole cloves of garlic, a little Italian seasoning, and sea salt to taste about an hour before shredding the meat and returning it to the juices for a few minutes.  Made the meat a sort of cross between French dip and Italian beef.  We fixed our sandwiches on bollio rolls with provolone. Fantastic!

loved the flavor. I didn't use the beer - didn't have any- I added one more can of beef broth instead. I added a pkg of dry onion dip mix per previous suggetions. It was almost too oniony and would have most likely been fine without it like the recipe says.  I do think this might have been better at 6 hrs and I'll try this next time.  Mine seemed a little over done (could be my slow cooker!)

Best roast beef ever!!!  I added onion and garlic powder and a splash of worcheshire sauce.  I also used a chuch roast it was so incredibly tender no need to slice, it shredded itself.  Will definately put this in my keeper section of recipes.

Very good with the addition of garlic powder and black pepper.  I took others recommendations about the onion powder but then I found that to be too much onion.  When about 1/2 hr left, I took meet out, put onions and mushrooms in sauce to cook while I shredded the meat.  Very yummy.

The meat was very tender.  If I make this again, I'm going to do it without the beer.  It just gave it a funk that I didn't particularly care for.

Super flavor but my meat was not as tender as I would like. It was also done in 3 1/2 hours cooked on low. This is most likely an issue with my individual crock pot and not the instructions. I added garlic powder and used only 1/3 of the beer because I was afraid of tasting too much. I do not drink and I could taste it but it was a nice complement to the flavor. I will make this again but with different meat.

Everyone knows I don't care for roast.  My daughter had been asking for it, however, so I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased.  Absolutely delicious.  I even made a leftover sandwich for myself the next day while everyone else was at school!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was such an amazing recipe... I put it together in the morning and it was done right on time. The meat just fell apart. I needed a slotted spoon to scoop it out. The only thing I didn't differently is added swiss cheese on the sandwich. The whole family loved this, I will certainly be making again soon.

GREAT recipe. I did add some minced garlic because we like garlic in everything and used chuck roast and shredded it as that is what I had on hand. Nice change from Italian Beef as it is a little milder in flavor and the kids liked it much better. The buttered toasted buns are a must! we also topped with cheese. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe that has become a standby in our house.

This was a really good, easy recipe.  Could still use a few extra little touches to personalize to your own taste.  We're cheese fans, so added provolone and some garlic.  Don't subs low sodium broth or it will be FLAVORLESS. And to reiterate below reviews, a stout or even a porter truly would be the best beers to add to this recipe.

Very tasty, took another's advice and used a thick dark beer and melted provolone cheese on the toasted rolls.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I will definitely make it again.

Excellent dish.  Husband and kids liked it.  I cooked my roast on low for about 8 hours, which was definitely too long.  It fell apart and was impossible to slice.  However...the kids liked it this way.  Very tender and flavorful.

WOW!  I read the reviews and as recommended, added onion powder, a dash of pepper, fresh minced garlic (about 5 cloves).  Sliced the roast and then returned to crock pot for another hour.  Many reviewers have changed the cut of meat, but I stuck with the rump roast and it was phenomenal.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  It will be a Fall/Winter staple in my home from now on.

This is an amazing recipe.  I love anything that provides more than one meal.  The first night, the French dip was wonderful.  My family loved it. I too, made a few changes(garlic, browning sauce, etc.)  Then the next night, cut up leftover meat, made gravy from the au jus, poured it over egg noodles and had another wonderful meal!

I have made this a number of times and ALWAYS use a prime rib roast. It is worth the money. Guests who have tried it always ask me to make it for them again. Simply delicious!

This was great.  I added a bit of garlic salt, some pepper and a touch of worcestershire sauce.  Couldn't have been any better.

This really easy, but it tasted just like pot roast.  The dipping au jus (sp?) was a bit bland, but I think that can be doctored up a bit.  I also put some swiss cheese on my rolls, it was delicious.  Will I make this again?  Probably.

Fantastic!  I have been looking for an easy affordable french dip recipe and this is it!  I added 1 tsp of minced garlic during the last hour which made it even better!  Made excellent left overs too!  Try this recipe you won't be sorry!

We make this at least once a week...its fantastic!!!  You do need to season the meat before putting it in the slow cooker (we like Cavender's greek seasoning) but even without the seasoning its amazing.  Add the meat to heated rolls and top with shredded mozzarella and its unbelievable.  Enjoy!

I used a chuck roast as suggested by another review, and added 1 Tbsp. of italian seasoning.  This turned out moist and shredded apart with ease.  Even my picky 13-yr old asked for seconds!

The meat from this recipe turned out great! The sauce from the recipe is a little different story- wasn't quite what we were expecting and still smelled of beer. It was no biggie, just used the delicious meat for sandwiches. Overall, good meal

This turned out perfect! Although I didn't follow it exactly as I didn't have any beer on hand, it still tasted great using a little red wine. I'll try the beer when I make this next time. Friends still ask when I'll be making it again. Side note, I made a little garlic aioli for those that wanted more on theirs and we all put either provolone or swiss on their rolls before toasting. Yum yum!

I've made this dish at least 10 times since I found this recipe. For our family of 9 I double it. I buy whatever roast is on sale and they all taste great cooked this way. We rarely have leftovers.  Everyone, even the toddlers enjoy dipping their sandwiches in the au jus.

Yes, this was easy, but if you do not season the roast some it will be blah. I sliced 2 onions and placed them in the bottom of the crock pot, poured liquids in and added roast that was rubbed with pepper and cajun seasoning. I also added 1 tbsp of minced garlic and worcestershire sauce to the liquids. After 6 hours removed the roast to carve, when I tasted the juice it was still just okay, added garlic powder, better than boullion beef base and horseradish, much better. Served on toasted buns with horseradish mayo.

The flavor and texture was fabulous. I used 1/2 bottle of beer, and added onion flakes, garlic powder, and a few splashes of worstershire. Also went with the sirloin roast as recommended.

This meal turned out excellent and I love that there was almost no prep needed.  I followed everyone else's suggestions. I added garlic salt, onion powder, pepper, and onion soup mix to the recipe and I was very happy with the results.  I cooked it for 7 hours on low & returned the meat to the juice for a half hour after slicing.  I also put melted mozeralla cheese on the rolls before serving. Thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't  know how this would turn out as I am not a very experienced at cooking roasts, could not have been better.  Used Moose Drool beer, darker beer.  Will be making again soon!  Everyone loved it!

This is Amazing! i only used a 2.5 lb rump roast, and there was lots of leftovers (family of 2). we add, chopped garlic, onion powder, and a dash of worshestire sauce in the slow-cooker. then sevred on grinder rolls that had been put under broiler to melt mozzarella chesse. then added carmelized onions, oregeno/basil white wine sauteed mushrooms, tomato, a little dijon mustard and/or a little creamy horseradish sauce.... too die for! :)

This was okay, but the meat wasn't as tender as I would have hoped. I made exactly as recipe stated, and used guinness draught as some of the other reviewers suggested. I did find that the juice was lacking in flavor and added some garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. I also sliced and put back in the crockpot an hour before serving. Overall, this was super easy but not super good to me.

Some people have mentioned the stuff I'm about to say, but to round it up: The dip was very watery, the meat was shredding making it hard to slice, and I kinda found that it smelled a little like beer.  But the taste is pretty great so people should  think up ways to solve these issues beforehand.  Basically, tastes pretty good but not very appealing.

AWESOME!  Added some garlic, onion powder & worschester, sliced up thin after cooking for 5 hrs then back in juice for another two.  The leftover broth makes a great base for french onion soup when you're done with the beef!!

5 stars.  I like the Joy's revision. Probably worth buying an au jos packet and mixing it w/ the leavings at the end to mix your dipping sauce, I threw it in and cooked in it which works ok. The beef is tender and flavorful, but pulls more than it slices.

Oh my that was delicious and I don't even really like red meat. My mom broke up the meat 1 hour before, and then couldn't stop eating it! I too added a clove of garlic. We sauteed some onions for the sandwhich as well.

This was okay, but my husband and teenage boys are not asking me to make it again. (Made this about two months ago). The meat was a little tough and dry even though it was slow cooked in liquid.

Definitely yummy, I used a chuck roast and cooked it for 6 hours on high. Once I decided to cut it the meat just fell apart, so I shredded it into small chunks and put the meat back in the crock pot for about 30 minutes. Then served it on potato bread with melted monterey jack cheese. Delicious! (oh, and we were out of beer! will try again with, it could only make it better)

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I don't add the beer, so I replace it with more beef broth.  This tastes WAY better than anything made with the powdered soup.  The condensed soup makes all the difference.  My whole family loves this recipe!  We serve on crusty french rolls with provolone cheese.  I also brown the beef in a frying pan first, I think it helps the flavor.

These were FANTASTIC.  The kids loved them, husband loved them and I ate the leftovers :)  We used munster cheese and it was wondderful.  For dinner we used regular french bread rolls but for my leftovers I made mini sandwiches with the Hawaiian sweet rolls.  EVEN BETTER!

My husband and three year old loved this!  It is great to have delicious French dip sandwiches so easily and cheaply.  I made this recipe exactly as described, but found that it lacked some flavor when I tried it (that is why I gave it four stars), so I added significant amounts of salt, garlic powder, and worcestershire sauce to the au jus, then I sliced the meat and returned it to the crock pot, letting it sit in the juice with the crock pot on warm for about half an hour.  Turned out wonderful.  The recipe cost me about $18 to make, which is pretty good, considering it fed my little family of three twice.  Definitely one to try if you like French dips!

We love this recipe!  The roast turns out tender & tasty.  The juice is so good for dipping!  I even use a little of the juice to make gravy for the mashed potatoes we usually serve on the side.  Great recipe!!

I LOVED this recipe, and so did my family. It was a big hit, and easy to make. Like other reviewers, I cut the meat about 1 hour to 1/2 hour ahead of serving time in order to let the individual slices soak in the au jus. SO YUM!

My modifications: I used a 4 pound chuck roast. Didn't have beer so I just added more water along with the beef broth. Used the lipton's onion soup packet mix instead of condensed french onion soup. I couldn't quite slice the meat b/c it was too tender and ended up pulling off chunks for the sandwiches. I toasted the bread in the oven and placed the chunk of meat on it and put it back in oven to melt a little havarti cheese. The results: It was so delicious! The dinner table was silent (in awe) as everyone ate!

This is in our crock pot right now! We made this a few months ago and it turned out fantastic! We took the advice of other reviewers and cut the meat up and put it back in the crock pot- DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!! It makes the meat sooo much more juicy!

This was very good and tender meat.  I replaced the beer with 12 oz of beef broth because i don't like the taste.  I toasted the bread and served with a hickory smoked swiss cheese.  My guests loved it!

I'm not a big red meat fan so I use six skinless chicken thighs instead of the roast.  I rub the thighs with garlic and onion powder, put a little rosemary in and follow the rest of the recipe.  Wonderful!!

Yummy!  And about the easiest dinner you can make.  Pairs well with provolone and can be spruced up with sauted mushrooms and onions.

This was good food.  We used the leftovers the next day added water and bullion cubes and chopped up a 5lb bag of onions and a hearty french onion soup was the result that froze well and fed a family of four 5 times.

WOW! First off let me say Im pregnant and alot of foods sound terrible, so did this one. But before I got this way I loved French Onion and dips and such! I fixed it thinking my husband would like it and maybe on a good day I would be able to keep it down! I ate 4 sandwiches myself and loved it! My husband cant get enough and wants to know when Im making it again! Thank you so much for this recipe. I did add some garlic powder and minced onions (since I couldnt cut my own, pregnancy nausea) and it was wonderful!

This just taste like pretty good roast to me.I did exactly what recipe calls for.The au jus was only fair the first time I made it.The second time I used the juices and added Bisto gravy to it and got a thicker gravy.I grew up eating Bisto gravy and is a little difficult to find but it makes this French Dip recipe superb,but to me any roast has got to have the bisto.Thanks for sharing recipe,it was a different touch.

My family and I can't find the words to describe exactly how delicious this was! YUM!  However, I LOVE beer, but I could definately taste beer in the juice.  No worries, I added another can of the French onion soup.  I also took the advice of others and added a little onion powder and garlic salt.  The meat was fall apart tender!   I'm going to make this again and again...Can't wait to share it with my friends for The Superbowl!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!
Update:  I use Shiner Bock beer and it's PERFECTION!  I think my family would eat this every night if they could.

Very good!  The meat cooked perfect (I used a dutch oven at 325* for about 5 hours) and was tasty and tender.  The dipping sauce was a bit bland though, so next time I may use the beef consume instead of the broth.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was delicious! I couldn't find a rump roast so ended up with a 2.5 lb London Broil and since it's just my husband and I, that was more than enough. I cooked it for 5 hours, sliced it thin and put it back in the juice and turned it to "warm". I was worried it was going to be too dry, but turned out very juicy! I toasted the buns under the broiler topped them with meat and Provolone cheese and put them back under th broiler to melt the cheese. Yum! I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

LOVE THIS!!  This was the best French Dip I have had..besides the ones u get at restraunts!  Tasted FANTASTIC!  It was a hit with my 8 year old, 2 year old and 4 adults!  I did add garlic salt and worcestershire sauce, and shredded it before serving and put it back into the juice.  My beef was so tender that I tried to slice it but it just fell apart it was still amazing!  SO EASY AND SOOO GOOD!  MUST TRY THIS!!

I tried this recipe as written, but I didn't care for the beer-I preferred the au jus flavored with red wine and soy sauce, as well as the the garlic and onionand fresh cracked black pepper-so much richer flavor.  I also preferred the chuck roast, and shredding the meat as opposed to slicing it.  I served it on buttered, toasted French bread with a slice of provelone cheese melted on, with a nice salad and chips on the side.  Great meal-a huge hit with my bunco pals.  Thanks for the great idea!

I had a bunch of friends coming over on Sunday, so I decided this would be perfect to feed them. Boy was I right they all raved over it. There wasn't any leftovers they all had seconds. Even my picky 7 yr old loved it!!     I had a larger rump roast so I used 2 cans of everything.. and cooked on high for half the time and low the rest when it was done i kept on the warm setting until everyone was ready. When it was time to slice the meat it just feel apart. I served it with Monterey Jack cheese sauteed, mushroom, onions, and red bell peppers. I buttered the french rolls and sprinkled garlic powder on them. Such a huge HIT!!!

First of all I have to say I was worried about the beer taste at first cause the smell was strong throughout the day but the beer taste was not there. I used yuengling tan and black. The sandwich was pretty good but eventhough the bread got toasted when you dipped it made the bread kinda doughy.

This is DELICIOUS!  Would also be good as a "comfort" food - just thicken the au jus to make a gravy and add mashed potatoes and a veggie and enjoy!

Freakin' delish! I had to convince my husband to want sandwiches for dinner, but once these were ready to eat, he was glad I made them! Super easy, cooks in less than the time stated - and the Au Jus is wonderful to dip in.

This was fantastic, and so easy! Literally took me 5 minutes to put together in the morning before work. I couldn't find any French Onion soup, so I dumped in a package of onion soup mix and poured a soup can of water in instead. Also added the garlic salt, as suggested. Hubby loved it, I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! My fiance is already asking for it again. Only change I made to the recipe was to place pieces of garlic in slits of the roast. I also sauteed spinach with garlic and served on the sandwich with provolone. Scrumptious sandwich!

This was fairly decent.  It took 8 hours to be falling from the bone (which could just be the size of meat/cooking temp/etc.) Close to serving I added seasoning salt and pepper because I felt that it was too bland.  I used a winter lager and the au jus turned out tastey!

The meat was chewy and dry, BUT this could be due to my slow cooker. I've found it cooks much faster than the times on AR. I will try it again with a shorter cook time. Even with the meat being overcooked I can see this recipe has potential. My family has requested that we try it again.

I make these atleast every month at the request of my family.  I even freeze any leftovers and reheat in the crockpot - perfect every time!  We toast the bread with 2 slices of provolone cheese.  This also helps keep your sandwiches together.  So easy and delicious!

I was only cooking for two so I used a 2lb roast, but used the same amount of ingredients.  A porter beer and added some worchestshire and garlic. I like my roast beef a little rare, so I cooked about 3 hours, sliced and put back in the crock pot a little longer.  Provolone cheese and French bread.  Turned out delicous! Had a lot of extra au jus, and will try to make a onion soup out of it.

great easy recipe for my family since we are always running to sporting events with the kids. I have made different ways.  Great served for guests on mini crusty bagels.  Crust your bagels in the broiler until golden brown.  Add your french dip mxiture w/juice.  Top with gorgonzola cheese and broil until cheese is bubbling. Garnish with fresh parsely and serve immediately.

Very good my family loved it. I used chuck roast and left out the beer. Heres a tip that makes this melty and juicy... When you take the rolls out of the oven open up the roll, put the beef on and ladle a little of the juice onto the top part of the bun and ad provolone cheese. Super yummy!

My hubbie LOVED these but "French Dip" is his favorite sandwich so I veto-ed his 5 stars and demoted the recipe to 4.  Don't get me wrong, we'll make it again, it just takes more than a little beer and some beef to get 5 stars out of me.  Overall it was simple and tasty.

So I couldn't wait to get my hands on this sandwich after reading all the rave reviews and I thought for sure all the people that said this was bland didn't do something right. But, like others, I was a bit disappointed with the final result.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and would give it a 3 as written. I will never rate a recipe after I tweak it, because I do not think that is fair to the author, and I don't think allrecipes should allow that! Well, they were spot-on, it was very bland!  Once I tweaked it, it turned out DELISH. My way I would give it a 5. I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and MORE beer.  I think what happens is the beer goes into the crock pot right away, and then by the end of 6-7 hours, the beer taste is ALL GONE, and YES I used a dark beer...no light stuff.  So the key here is to ADD THE BEER TOWARDS THE END of cooking time to keep that yummy taste, and then I think this recipe will become a 5!

Great easy recipes.  My husband loved it!  I used 1 c. water & bouillon cubes instead of the can of beef broth.  Used a darker beer.  Added thyme and a little garlic powder.  Delicious!

My husband and I really enjoyed it and I made it just as the recipe called for. Except I guess for the fact that we added provolone cheese on top of our sandwiches.

i love this recipe but i do use a few changes. i do the chuck instead of rump, use i can each of beef broth, consomme and french onion soup, i add about a 1/2 tablespoon of beef bouillon, and just when it's almost done i throw in about 2 tablespoons a fresh chopped garlic. my entire family loves this recipe. we make a double batch and eat leftovers for a few days. when i do use beer in it, i use a Guinness stout.

We loved this, but we made a few changes based on what we had on hand. We used cooking wine instead of beer and topped each sandwich with sauteed peppers and Swiss cheese. Delicious!

My Hubby, boys 14,13,9 and mother-in-law all raved! Wanted it again as soon as possible. Modified it using half bottle beer and adding a can of consomme, some worch. and garlic powder.  Served with melted slice Provolone on buttered and toasted Sourdough roll! Superb!  Be sure to trim fat off or your Au Jus will be really greasy and runny!

Fair. This just didn't do it for us. The beef did not seem to be tender and I expected a more distinct taste from the dip. Doubt this will be on our table again.

This was amazing, and I did take suggestions from other reviewers, mainly the cutting and adding back for the last hour part.  When I cut the strips I was worried because they were dry, but after another hour in the juices after being cut they were perfect! We ate this three nights in a row (the third night I turned it into goulash).  By the time its cooked 8hrs you shouldn't taste the alcohol at all, and I used a Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale, nice a dark and very rich flavor (it is a bitter pumpkin ale, not like the more seemingly sweet ones, hence I used it to cook with, and it worked SO WELL) : )  Thanks for the recipe, I'll make it again.

These sandwiches were great!  I used a chuck roast because it was on sale and served with swiss cheese on "French Baguette" from this site.  We thought the au jus was a little too heavy on the beer.  Next time I will only use 1/2 a bottle of beer.

I have a new slow cooker, and this was the first recipe I tried with it. I thought the beef was tasty and tender, and the dipping sauce was just as I remembered it when I had beef dip years ago. I added garlic powder to the beef roast before cooking, and I used 1/2 bottle of beer as some other reviewers suggested. There was no way the beef was able to be sliced, but shredding was fine. I cut the buns in half, toasted each, then heated the meat on one side and melted cheddar cheese with green onion on the other - and to serve, put the meat half and cheese half together. YUM.

This was very good, but to me didn't taste like the typical french dip you get at a restaurant, which is one of my favorite sandwiches, so I was a little disapointed. I think I would use a different cut next time like many recommneded and maybe add some of the au jus french dip stuff you can buy at the store. Still tasty though!!

All these rave reviews caused me to look forward to making this dish.  Had it last night and I was not impressed with the sauce.  It was much too watery.  Essentially we had roast beef sandwiches that were tasty and easy but they were not the best thing I've ever tried.  We are having the leftovers tonight and I'm going to try to thicken the sauce in a pan before serving.

WOW!  Attepted to slice meat, but it just fell apart, perfectly tender and au jus is delightful.  I used a lager beer and did sprinkle meat with some garlic salt.  Good quality buns are a must and so is toasting them.  Enjoy!

This was AWESOME!!  After my husband and I bit into it we decided it needed something else so we threw a slice of swiss cheese on it, and decided this was a MUST HAVE!!  EXCELLENT!  Used Guiness beer which is a lot darker and made a wonderfull richness to the dip.

This recipe is delicious! I have made it several times and it turns out perfect every time.  I like to use ciabatta rolls and top the meat with provolone cheese.  Sometimes i even sautee onions and mushrooms and them top it all with the provolone.  I do agree that a darker beer adds better flavor!

I forgot to get the french onion soup so I just cut up an onion and added it. I used an entire can of beer and beef broth. The sandwiches were so good. We also put the onions on it. VERY GOOD!!!

One of my favorite slow cooker recipes! Not only are the flavors great, but you don't need to do any prep work, just toss it all in the pot. So if you don't have a lot of time, say you want something to make in the morning, go to work, and come home to this is perfect. I also serve it how I have seen others do, on a toasted roll with melted cheese (swiss, american, provolone, any kind really) on top. Great for lunch the next day too!

I was so disappointed! I LOVE french dip sandwiches, so I was thrilled to see that this recipe was so well-reviewed. I followed the recipe exactly and neither my husband or I even finished our sandwiches. The meat did NOT slice, it just shredded and fell apart. The meat was dry and salty and unappealing. Very sad, especially considering all the leftovers we had to deal with!

A Very comforting dish! I didn't have a beer so I used broth in its place. As someone suggested I added 2 TB kitchen bouquet and a little  more salt. It was very good.

This is absolutely delicious! I forgot to pick up a can of beer, so I used a little white cooking wine instead. The meat was so tender, it just fell apart. I did season the meat before cooking with some garlic salt and pepper.  The flavor was awesome. I toasted the bread and put a slice of provolone on top. So easy, yet so good! My husband was in heaven! Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful!  I've also tried it with white wine instead of beer and is equally as good if not better.  I use eye of round roast b/c its leaner.  Delicious!!!  Going into regular dinner rotation!!!

Like many others I used a full bodied malted ale and substituted consomme for the broth.  The result was a french dip that my family loved.  We served this beautiful recipe on the french rolls to die for also available on the site.  Even my picky five year old was asking for more.

WOW! My fanily loves French Dip, and I've found this recipe to better than is served in most local resaurants.  I used a malty, full-bodied porter ale and eye round roast, since it was the same price as chuck.

I just served this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with our dinner guests and my husband! I did not butter the bread - I just piled thinly sliced pieces of roast on the bottom half of each bun, then put a slice of Provolone on top. Put it in the broiler for 1-2 minutes to let the cheese melt. The dipping sauce was great too! I will definitely make this again.

Pretty dang gone good. Five stars for easiness! Followed the recipe but added some garlic powder, thyme, and rosemary - dont know if enough to make a difference. I imagine you could tweak this recipe a lot without screwing it up.

AMAZING! I'm not the biggest beef eater but my boyfriend and I both LOVED this recipe. I took the advice of others and added some garlic powder, beef broth,  onion powder, and worcestershire sauce. However, i'm sure this recipe would still be great without the changes! Thanks! :)

The flavor was not what I expected so next time I would leave out the beer and add more beef broth instead.

I am going to try this again but without the canned onion soup, it lends an odd sweetness my husband and I didn't like.

Was wonderful!  Everyone loved it and it was super easy.  Took advice of other readers and doctored it up a bit with some garlic, onion powder, thyme, dash of salt, worchester sauce and pepper.  rubbed some montreal steak seasoning on meat also before cooking.  YUM!

My family LOVED this recipe and practically licked the crock pot clean. I used Guinness beer and followed the recipe only adding some garlic salt and powder. I also poked holes in the roast when I placed it in the crock pot so it would soak up some of the juices. Following some of the other reviews, I pulled the roast out and sliced it then placed it back in for about 45 mins, great flavor. I served it on french bread with provolone cheese! YUM!

Wonderful - Have made it twice already as my husband can't get enough of it. Used Shiner Bock and Beef Consomme and it turned out better than any restaurant version and you have tons of Au Jus leftover. Next time I plan to turn the leftover Au Jus into a gravy and poor over noodles as one other reviewer suggested.

This is a FABULOUS recipe and cheap to  make. This ended up costing me less than $2 per person to make. My only suggestion is to broil the bread with cheese on top for a minute or two. I would recommend Provolone or Havarti. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome!!  I made this for this past Super Bowl, and it was incredible.  I served mine w/ sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers with horseradish sauce to spread on each sandwich.  This will be one that will be a classic in my family.

Delicious!!!  We don't really care for onions, so I strained the onion pieces out of the soup and just used the liquid (after cooking the soup).  I also added a piece of melted Provelone cheese to the sandwiches.  Mmmmm.  So easy, and tastes great!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This had a wonderful flavor but I think rump roast is the wrong cut of meat.  I had to modify the ingredients based on what I had on hand.  I boiled 3 beef boullion cubes and 12 oz. of water.  I mixed a package of french onion dip powdered mix with a can of golden mushroom soup, I added that with a bottle of Amber Bock and the beef broth to the crock pot and let it cook for about 5 hours on low.  Took it out and let it rest for a few minutes, then sliced it in small thin pieces and added it back to the juices for one more hour.  Then made the sandwiches as the recipe suggests.  I made french onion soup with the remaining broth, the next day...now that was awesome!

My husband was in hog heaven!  He didn't use the dip, but slathered them with horseradish and yummed them right down. They reminded him of a sandwich that he ate growing up in Western NY called a Beef on Wick.  Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious!! The whole house smells so fabulous I couldnt wait to eat dinner all day long!! I have made this twice (I add one chicken bouillon cube to the liquid and my own little mix of spices) and the next time I will have to use a much bigger roast because my whole family will easily eat thirds & leftovers!! Yum Yum Yum!

This was pretty good. I think the results will vary based on the cut of meat you use. Next time, I will try to find a leaner roast than the one I used as it turned out a little too greasy, making our au jois not as tasty.

Fantastic sandwich!  They came out tasting like "Prime Rib Roast."  I used a sirloin tip roast like suggested.  I also didn't use the French onion soup because my hubby won't eat onions.  But I did add a little Worchestershire, Soy and beef paste for added flavor, and I did sear the meat before putting it in the crock pot.  When I made the sandwiches, I used horseradish cheddar cheese, and they actually tasted like prime rib sandwiches.  Fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as directed. Although the meat came out great we did not care for it on the buns at all. It was very dry and bland, dipping it in the sauce helped but no one really cared for it. Even my 14yo said it would be great w/ mashed potatoes. I have tons of leftovers so tomorrow night I'll reheat it and serve it w/ garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.

Yum yum yum!  Everyone loved this!  I added a little garlic powder, 1T of Worcestershire sauce and only used 6 oz. of beer.  No butter on the bread - trying to save calories.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It will be a family favorite for sure!

This was not only very easy but everyone loved it!  I just added a little worcestershire and garlic salt.  For the bread I did split the french loaf in half and butter and added motzorella for 15 minutes then filled with meat that was sliced but soaking in the au jus sauce.... came out absolutely perfect!

We loved it! I added onion and bell pepper along with garlic. We made mashed potatoes to serve with the aus jus. We could not wait for leftovers the next night.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, but found the meat to be, actually, a bit dry until dipped into the juices. The flavor was very good. I do wonder about the serving size, though. That's a LOT of meat for the number of servings. I will make this again, but with a smaller roast. There will still be plenty for everyone.

Very, very good. It's a great base recipe and easy to add in stuff according to your own taste. It made a lot, but that was no problem. My husband and I ate sandwiches and then ate some on egg noodles too.

wonderful! Definitely needs to be sliced very thin(I used my electric knife). Thick crusty italian bread went fantastic with it.

I have made this recipe countless times for football games, etc., and it's always a hit!  My husband and our friends LOVE these french dip sandwiches, and it's an easy recipe to feed a crowd with.  I use Guinness as the beer of choice, and add provolone cheese to the rolls.  Even better, the leftovers make an equally tasty meal the next day - just throw the leftover beef and juices into a pan, thicken with flour, and serve over egg noodles!

This is by far the best tasting roast I have ever made.  Stapler in my family.  I add carrots,potatoes and 1 onion.  Also, I use bud light every time and it is great.

Very good!  We used Honey Brown beer and it really tasted good.  Very salty though on it's own but with the roll it was lessened a bit and had great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again!

So good! I used dry onion soup mix instead of condensed, which I will NOT be doing next time; I don't think I'll add any soup mix. I will only use a whole onion for flavor in the cooker. But I used a nice dark beer and some beef bouillon with the rest of the seasonings and the au jus was really tasty! I also put some garlic cloves in with it and spread the cooked cloves on my french bread which was really, really good. I will definitely use this recipe again and always for making french dips.

Very good and easy. Next time I would use a better quality beer - you could taste a little of the cheapness in the aftertaste. Otherwise, very good.

I used a 3 lb top round. Wanted a lot of au jus, so I used two cans of broth, a packet of dried onion soup mix, half a bottle of dark beer, and about a can of water. Got a late start, so started the cooker on high for a couple hours then turned down. After it was cooked through but still tough I thinly sliced up the beef and put it back in for a couple hours hoping that would help it get tender in time (total time 7 hours). It worked! Everyone loved it and I have lots of au jus for the freezer. Served with provolone, a topping of sauteed mushrooms, green peppers and onions. Also had plain broccoli, and then spinach sauteed with red bell pepper.

This is the easiest and most delicious dish my family has ever tasted!  I didn't have the dark beer so I used my cab instead.  Any red wine would be beautiful in this dish!  I also have used both the condensed soup and the dried onion soup mix and both work well.  We slice it up on a crusty bakery baguette with provolone cheese melted on top and sometimes add whole mushrooms to the crock pot for the side.  Wonderfully simple!  Great for left overs if there are any!

Definitely season the meat, make sure you use the butter on the bread, tastes much better.  I feel like this recipe could use a little more flavor, but I can't decide what could be added.  It's still very good.

What a hit! My husband begged me "don't lose this recipe!" I added garlic and onion powder and a little black pepper. Slowed cooked it for 6 hours, sliced it thin and added it back to the crock pot for an hour. I broiled the rolls with a slice of provolone cheese on each side of split bun then piled on the beef. I used the cut of meat recommened in the recipe. It was fantastic and SOOOO easy!!

I had to improvise when I couldn't find the soup this recipe calls for so I used the dry boxed French onion soup.  I think that combined with the beer I used (Amberbock) didn't work that well.  The meat was tender, but didn't have much taste other than the beer.  I’m giving it a 3 because of the taste, which is probably my fault and not necessarily the recipes.  I’m not sure I’ll try it again even if I do find the condensed French onion soup.

This was good. I cooked it in my slow cooker on high because I needed it to be done in 4 - 5 hours, rather than 7 hours. The meat was tough but edible since you dip it in the au jus. I will probably try again and cook on low next time.

This was wonderful!  This was the first time I actually cooked a roast in the Crock Pot that was fork tender and fell apart when removed from the Crock Pot!  Finally!  My other attempts have been dry or chewy.  I did cut the roast about an hour before serving and let it cook a little longer in the juice.  My husband (a huge French Dip fan) loved it which is always my goal!  Update 4/23/09:  Made this using a really cheap beer the first time.  Used Bud Light this time...a little more expensive but I could taste it in the meat.  I didn't care for that.

My husband liked this.  I did omit the beef broth, and add a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I did that the second time I made it and I liked the flavor much more.  Also, creates alot f juice on it's own, the second can of broth was unneeded.

This was very good. I did add some fresh garlic, basil, thyme, worcestershire sauce and soy sauce to the recipe for more flavor. It turned out really well.

This was unbelievably delicious. I used a rump roast, let it cook for about 8 hourse in the slow cooker on low. I followed some of the other reviews & cut the meat & returned it to the juice before serving. The meat was so soft & tender. It just melted in your mouth. My husband loved it!

I did as others suggested..added garlic salt, salt, pepper, and thyme and then browned in a skillet before adding to crock pot.  Also added garlic and Worchteshire to the crock pot and beef consume.  Only had regular beer and it worked fine.  I made au jus to dip it in and everyone liked it.  We topped ours with sauteed onions and mushrooms, then added Italian cheese and broiled them.  It was very easy on a busy day.

As with everyone else, I made some modifications. I used Guinness, as recommended. I also added some worstershire and in addition to the canned french onion soup, I added one packet of the French Onion Soup mix.

Excellent recipe.  I made this recipe for family after my daughters baptism and did not have any left.  Everyone loved it.  I did however make modifications after reading many reviews.  I used sirloin tip roast, french onion soup, beef consomme, and guiness beer.  I also added beef broth (for extra juice), which I am glad I did.  I cooked the roast the day before serving for about 6 hours on low, then put it in the fridge overnight.  I took the roast out the following day, then sliced it and cooked it on low for an additional 5 hours.   This will definately be added to my favorite list!

I made this for a small super bowl party at the house and everyone loved it!  My husband is a tetotaller 100% and so he is very sensitive to the taste of cooking wine, or any other alcohol used in cooking.  I was apprehensive about this recipe, but after reading the reviews, I figured I would give it a shot. My husband never knew there was beer in the recipe, and he absolutely loved these sandwiches.  I made a few mods to it though. I used butter and a garlic spread on the rolls, and I added a small thinly sliced piece of provolone to each sandwich.  It was delicious!!!  I love this recipe and will def. use it again!!!

This was good, but I feel like it needs something else.  I did add 1/2 t. of both onion powder and garlic powder, as well as 1 T. of worchestershire.  Without those additions, I think it would've only been 3 stars.

I use top sirloin and definitely slice it one hour before serving and place it back in crock pot with the aus jus. I also use worcestershire sauce throughout the whole cooking process..to add to the flavor.  This is a crowd favorite!!!

This was very disappointing. This is hardly what I would call a french dip- the meat was the consistency and had the flavor of pot roast. If you do make this, be sure not to follow the recipe, as it has virtually no flavor. I would suggest adding salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder...otherwise you will be eating a very bland piece of pot roast on a roll.

French dip is my husband's favorite sandwich. He liked it but did not love it. Made this last night with a 3 lb rump roast and thought it was just ok and more of a pot roast sandwich. Followed original recipe but added garlic, onion, and pepper. Followed others and took out and sliced meat 1.5 hrs before done and then put it back to pot. It became more tender. The aus jus was bland, so very thankful I had a packet of powdered aus jus gravy to dip. Served it with provolone cheese on toasted french bread.

I turned the beef over an over before done since the bottom was more tender than the top was.  We loved it.  I used 1 1/2 cans beef broth and 1 pkg onion soup mix and 1 can light beer.  Turned out perfect.

Oh MY! Where do I start?  This is delish!! I butter and grill some calabrese buns (a little more dense then french bread so it doesn't get soggy) add the wonderful roast then put under the grill again topped with provolone cheese.  Then dip away in that awesome tasting dip.  My husband and I love this.

My husband loves this sandwhich.  I did add a hefty tablespoon of chopped garlic (we love garlic alot) and added a bay leaf as well. I also add browning sauce as suggested by others. Then I cut sandwhich buns and butter both sides and put the meat on the buns and top with a slice of provolone cheese.  I put it in the oven on broiler setting for 2 mins!  A great warm hearty meal on cold winter nights!

OMG!  This recipe is soooo good!  I followed it exactly-so easy and simple!  The only thing I needed to add was some garlic salt (only because I used a low sodium broth!)  Made this for a birthday party and it was a big hit.  I toasted some hoagie rolls with provolone cheese in the oven for 10 minutes and it was a hit!

This is a great, easy recipe. I ended up using a can of cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix. It turned out great. Definitely put the melted provolone on the bread, too!

This recipe by itself was very bland. I made it with a all the changes that others have recommeded. Added half the beer, 1 tsp of worchester, garlic, onion powder, salt to taste, can of mushrooms and it was still bland. After it was finished, I pulled the roast out and simply shredded it and added bbq sauce. I piled the beef on the french bread with butter, topped it with cheese placed it in the broiler until the bread got toasty and the cheese melted. It was good but with all the changes it wasnt the same recipe.

this was good, but it couldve been better. i used guiness, and you could slightly taste the beer, but still good. will probably make it again for a busy cold day when i know i wont want to come home and have to cook, but its not like my signature favorite dish.

French Dip is one of my favorite dishes. This was wonderful. I substituted apple juice for the beer, and used the remaining juices for the dip. We are making it again for the second time tonight, but I will be making au jus from a powdered packet instead this time. I am so glad I found this recipe.

Excellent!! I made this for company and it got rave reviews. I did add a spash of worcestershire sauce, garlic and onion powder... I also used Guiness in the can because it tends to be thick. DELICIOUS. I served french rolls as well as onion ciabatta rolls toasted with mozzerella slices. Would definately make this many more times!!

This was good, but I think it needed a little more flavor and could have been slightly thicker. I used bottom round roast and it turned out very moist. Next time I will add some garlic, some salt, and less broth.

With how high the ratings were for this one, I thought it would have been a lot more flavorful.  The au jus was a little bland for me.  It was decent, but I will probably try a different recipe next time.

Yum!  We were missing the beer, so we just threw everything it in without it, put it on low, and came home 5 hours later with a six-pack.  We added in the missing beer and let it cook on low another two hours.  Very good!  I plan to experiment next time with the Worcestershire sauce.

Just OK.  I kept in slow cooker for about 10 hours - for us it lacked flavor.  Will try a different recipe next time.

Fabulous!  Did it exactly as the recipe stated. When I made the sandwiches, I spread the bread with a combo horseradish/sour cream mix, added fresh (raw) onions, topped with whole green chilies, then smoked gouda cheese and put them under the broiler to melt.  They were phenomenal.  Best french dip sandwiches we'd ever had.  The sauce makes wonderful au jus!  The smoked gouda, raw onions and green chilies topped it off for a fabulous lunch-time meal! Definitely a keeper.

This was certainly easy to prepare.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and sliced it up a couple of hours prior to being done and placed the slices back into the pot of au jus.  I was a little worried about being "beery" because I could smell the beer almost until it was done, but in the final product no "beer" taste.  My only complaint of the recipe was that the au jus was really flat and one demensional in flavor.  I did not add salt, pepper or sasonings to the mix because honestly with the soup and beef broth I thought it might be a little on the salty side.  Next time I will really season up the meat and sauce good.  Thanks for sharing.

No one in my house was horribly wow'd by this dish. I made it per the instructions but I am going to make another shot at it and use a stout and follow some of the suggestions of others by adding garlic powder and worchestire sauce. This recipe has great potential if I can nail it down just right.

This was excellent. I used a different cut of beef and was afraid it would not be tender. It was - the key is shredding the beef and placing it back in the crock pot for an hour or so. It was absolutely delicious and my picky kids loved it.  When I came home from work, I could smell this before I even opened the front door. It is very, very good and my family requests this often. Even the leftovers are great! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Im giving it 5 stars cause it was so darn good, even though I couldnt use the onion soup as it has MSG in it and allergies in family so I added onion powder and garlic and Kitchen bouquet as a reviewer stated, it was really good, but the au jui was missing something, and it was probably the soup flavor, if anyone has any suggestions I would make this again but need better flavor.

We really enjoyed these with provolone cheese.  The only thing I didn't like was when I put the leftovers in the fridge the layer of fat formed on top (I know it's suppose to do that but it was gross).

Excellent Recipe!  Will reduce cook time to 6 hours the next time I make this to see if the beef is a little less dry.  Eventhoug it was dry it was still tender, not chewy at all. I was out of french onion soup so I used a package of dry lipton beefy onion and added a can of water to dilute. I also added a few teaspoons of worcestershire sauce to the juice and it was perfect!

I thought this was pretty darn good but nobody else was too excited about it. Can't win 'em all. ETA: Made this again but without the beer and replacing it with consomme and whole family loved it, made beef and noodles with leftovers the following night and it was wonderful.

This is pretty tasty for sure.  I added sauteed onions and mushrooms and swiss cheese (cream cheese is awesome too) along with the beef to toasted french rolls then under the broiler again just to melt the cheese.  The au jus is much better than any au jus out of a packet.  Enjoy!

This was great, followed suggestions added a little worstershire sauce and some garlic powder.  Also, hubby can't have onions but he can eat the dry lipton onion soup so I used 2 pkgs of that with 2 cans of beef broth.  Toasted the buns and added a little mozzarella and it was to die for.

Fantastic. I used an inside round piece of beef and it came out flavorful and tender. My only complaint is that I was looking for more of a restaurant style au jus taste, but since this is a recipes for just the beef dip itself I had to give it 5 stars. Next time I'll try it with Worcestershire Sauce.

This is one of my favorite slow cooker recipes! Sometimes I double the soup/beer to have extra dipping juice. Also I like to saute some onions and put them on the rolls.

This is amazing. I used 2 cans of the french onion soup & had lots of liquid left over for french onion soup the next night. The meat is so flavorful & tender. It tastes great on a toasted hoagie w/provolone melted on top!

We really love this recipe.  I have made it a number of times and have perfected it to the way we like it.  I don't add beer anymore.  More times than not I'm out of beer and I think it's still great without it.  I use a packet of onion soup mix instead of the can.  I cook mine on low overnight for about 12 hrs. (I have an old crockpot so I think mine takes longer than some of the new ones) then I take it out, slice it and return the slices to the crockpot for another couple of hours.  When I serve it, we try and use sourdough rolls.  I split the rolls, butter them, add a sprinkling of parmesan and toast them in a pan.  Then we add provolone cheese.  When I serve the au jus, I add a splash of soy sauce to each dish.  Yummy!  Everyone looks forward to having this dish and I love it because rump roast goes on sale frequently BOGO.

On our regular rotation.  My boys nag me for this quite frequently!  Really good with a slice of provolone and extra onions.  Yum!

would give it more stars if I could. Everyone loved this recipe. served on "french rolls to die for" from this sight. Added 1 tsp garlic powder & 1 tsp onion powder. Used a medium lager for the beer. Used a 5 lb top sirloin roast. Cooked for 7 hours on high. My mouth is watering just thinking about how good this recipe was! Thanks for sharing.

This was an awesome base to start from.  I did tweak a little bit though... added garlic salt & pepper to taste. Couldn't find can of condensed onion soup so used packet of Lipton french onion soup mix. Used closer to 20oz of beer, added approx. 2 tbsp of au just concentrate. Sounds like a lot of changes but it really wasn't.  Even my super picky daughter loved it.  The meat was still very moist and very tender.  Will deffinitely be making this one again and again.

This was AMAZING!  Couple of minor changes I made:  I used a tri-tip roast which I coated with a spice rub (found on this site) minus the salt that the rub called for and let that sit for a couple of hours.   I then seared it on the hot grill then placed it in a small roasting pan with the liquids and roasted it outdoors in the same grill.  I kept the lid closed to keep in the smokiness and the temp stayed around 325-350.  I added water occasionally to keep the juices from drying out.  It didn't take long to cook.  Took it out at rare to medium rare and by the time I finished slicing it (thinly!) it was a perfect medium to medium rare.  Very tender and so flavorful!  Served the slices over toasted hard french rolls (crispy on the outside, chewy and dense inside) to which I added provolone cheese and a little mayo.  Had made enough to freeze for later but we ended up eating it all weekend for lunch and dinner and now it's all gone!  We just couldn't eat anything else while it was available!  Outstanding French dip.  As good or better than any I've had in a restaurant.  Absolutely to die for!  Thanks for sharing this one!!

Made this over the weekend and it was good, but the meat was a little tough. Next time I may use a more inexpensive cut of beef (in my experience with crock pots, the cheaper the meat, the more tender it turns out) or slice it like others suggested and return it to the juice. The sauce was REALLY good though. I normally buy the powder packets, but this definitely tops the package.

This is now a family favorite and on my weekly menu.  I use Swiss cheese instead of Provolone.  For beer - I found that Heineken provided the best flavor.

I didn't find the meat to be tough at all.  We cooked it for 8-9 hours on low.  It was impossible to slice because it was so tender it truly fell apart.  My only negative comment is that I thought it was VERY VERY salty.  Maybe next time I will use low sodium beef broth.  Other than that it was absolutely delicious.

It was even better the 2nd day around and definitely put cheese on the bread before you bake it. My kids who are very picky eaters approved of it 2 thumbs up...

It was pretty good.  I added sliced mushrooms.  I ended up adding another can of french onion soup because the full bottle of beer had overtaken it.  All I had was Budweiser.  I may try a better beer next time!

Really good.  Did what many suggested, sliced meat and put back into broth for about an hour.  Also added garlic and ground black pepper.  Made sandwiches topped with Provolone Cheese placed under the broiler...yum!

This is a good recipe. I used a can of french onion soup, consomme, and beef broth.  I didn't add beer.  We thought it was great.  Also sliced it and put it back in for an hour.  It is an easy and great tasting recipe.

My boyfriend thought this recipe was absolutely fabulous.  I, however, couldn't get past the smell of it.  It must have been the beer.  I had to smell it cooking all day, too, so it wasn't very appetizing when dinner time came.  If you like to drink or cook with beer, go for it.  If not, you might try this recipe and substitute beef broth or something.

The husband and I just got done eating this, and it was pretty good.  I used a bottom round roast, a can of Campbell's beef broth, a can-full of water, a can-full of dry red wine (all my hubby has is crappy light beer so I followed the suggestion of another person and used red wine) and a package of French onion soup mix.  I couldn't have sliced this if I wanted to, but to be fair it cooked for 12 hours, so I cut it into chunks.  I ate it by itself and my husband made an open-faced sandwich.  Will make again, next time I'll try it with beer and see which I like better.

Used 1.75 C water with .75 pkt of Lipton Onion Soup mix and 1 beef boullion cube as sub for soup, water and beer.  No beer.  Cut the recipe to 5 servings and used like a london broil cut called top sirloin??

This was great and so easy!  I used a half a bottle of beer and added 2 garlic cloves.  After my 3 1/2 lb. roasted cooked for 7 hours I pulled it out and sliced.  I added some garlic powder, fresh black pepper and parsley flakes.  The sliced roast was back in the crock pot for another hour and was VERY tender and full of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

really good!  sprinkled liberally with onion and garlic powder.  used 2c strong beef stock, regular bud beer.  the texture was really tender ...but good.  More of a "mock" french dip.  eye round roast would probably work well...but I just used a chuck tender roast.  and really trimmed the fat before I put it in.  Toasted buns in oven with provalone cheese-  good stuff.

go with guiness beer! LOVED IT! (and I dont care for that sort of beer) as an earlier rvw wrote- when I took the meat out I was worried I may have overcooked it- was tougher than expected- but thinnly cut and shaved the meat- returned to the crockpot and let sit for 45mins before I put together the sandwiches.  we had corn on the cob and sweet potato fries as our sides. Everyone wanted to know why ive not made this before.... thanks for the recipe AWESOME! I will use again and again! 10stars!

Very good recipe.  The rump roast was a little drier than I had expected.  I will probably substitute with another type of roast next time.

I rated this 5 stars with a couple changes.  I doubled the beef broth, sliced up a fresh red onion rather than using the french onion soup, and added a packet of Italian salad dressing mix.  Very, very good!

This is easy. Just added a pack of onion soup mix. Mine turned out a bit dry, but I overcooked it but it was still great.

Have made this several times to rave reviews. Like several reviewers I have made a few changes. I add garlic & worchesthire sauce, use a dark beer, melt provolone or swiss cheese on teh bread. Make sure you have a small bowl of juice to dip tha sandwich in!

I really really wanted to love this, as it is so easy (and apparently lots of other people love it!).  I followed the recipe and the advice of many many prior reviewers and added some seasoning (garlic etc) to the base of 1 can beef consomme, 1 can beef broth, 1 can french onion soup, and, after much debate, 1 12 oz can beer.  DH and I LOVE beer, but for some unknown reason, neither one of us likes food cooked in/with beer.  I ended up using it and I wish I hadn't.  I even purposefully used a yucky light beer someone had left here hoping it would do it's tenderizing thing, but not affect the taste.  Neither one of use really liked this and I ended up throwing out the leftovers AND the au jous.  This will not be a repeat in our house.  It's really a "1" for us, but I have a hard time rating it that low since there's nothing *wrong* w/it, it's just didn't appeal to our personal taste.

While waiting for roast to cool I roasted some potatos with garlic.  They went great together.  Changed the broth around a bit and put pot on high heat to condense it a bit while roasting potatos.  I'll be doing this again, but will play with the recipe (might use wine instead of beer next time).

Much better the second day. The first day the sauce which is so rich was much too fatty for our family so I refridgerated it, took the excess fat off and then reduced it by half. So yummy. I added the beef back to the sauce to reheat before layering it onto warmed outdoor rolls. Then it was the best!

I've been using this recipe for awhile. everyone loves it.  I also made a change, instead of the can of french onion soup i use 1 package of dry onion soup mix it cuts back on the liquid but is just as good, you can't tell the difference!!!!!!!

Very good and very easy to do. Used some of the great suggestions made by previous reviewers, added chopped garlic, worcheschire sauce, chives, pepper, paprika, topped sandwiches with Mozza,  and red onion and grilled under the broiler (open face). Great recipe, will make again and kick it up another notch!! Thanks a bunch!!

This is one of my favorite recipes for simplicity alone--but it tastes great too!  I've made it several times and even my 4-yr old daughter loves it--when she sees it, she says "oooh, my favorite".  A couple of changes I've made... I slice up an onion and add it to the slow clooker while the meat is cooking.  And I melt some provolone cheese on the sandwiches when they are done.

I loved this recipe--quick and easy--by the time I got home from work, dinner was ready!!  My entire family gobbled this up and I hardly had any leftovers.  I added about 1/4 cup of red wine and a splash of liquid smoke.  I used onion rolls--very yummy toasted.  I didn't have any cheese on hand, but I think mozzarella would've been very good on this.  Can't wait to make it again!

Definitely use beef consommé instead of beef broth w/ the dark beer - yum!!  I also let it cool a bit and skimmed off the fat and then re-heated it for another hour.

I've made this several times and it is always delicious.  I took advice and used the french onion soup and beef consome with the garlic powder and beer.  I have tried rump roast and chuck and both are so tender I can barely cut it.  Comes out more like shreaded roast beef.  I'll try a tougher cut next time.

Super, super good! I used a little under 3 lbs. top sirloin, 2 cans French Onion soup, 8 oz. beef broth, 1 clove garlic, and a couple splashes Worcestershire sauce. This will be made again, and again, and again....

Nice, mellow flavor! Smelled great while cooking, too!  Used Foster's beer cause I don't keep it on hand, and they had singles of Foster's.  *My roast was very tough* cooked for 9 hours, sliced it, then put back in broth for about an hour!  Served on mini sub rolls that I buttered and toasted on my griddle.  Used Provolone cheese on top, super!

I'm not sure what I didn't do right, but I didn't end up being able to slice my beef very thin, it was already falling apart too much. But we did have a delicious pot roast dinner!

AMAZING!  We made sure to use a good dark beer.  These were to die for.  With some thinking and experimenting, the left over jus can be tweaked and used for french onion soup the next day.  My husband even enjoyed french onion soup.  WOW!

You don't get this recipe because you're looking for something that's healthy, that's for sure! But if you're feeding a bunch of guys after a rigorous band practice (as I was when I tried this recipe) it'll be inhaled quickly and with much enjoyment. 

I made no changes. This is definitely an easy "when the guys are coming over" type of a recipe.

I love, love, love this sandwich!  I omit the beer; tried it once and just don't like it.  I don't replace the lost liquid with anything else but I do use a 14.5 oz. can of Swanson's broth instead of the 10.5 oz. the recipe calls for.  There's plenty of au jus left for dipping.  Instead of baking the french rolls I place them buttered side down on a griddle and toast them that way.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wonderful! This recipe was so easy, and my whole family ate it up. I just have one question, how did anyone have leftovers?!?

I didn't know if I should review this recipe since I had to make some changes. I could not find condensed onion soup so I used progresso onion soup, added a lipton onion soup packet, a couple shakes worchestire sauce, some garlic, and my husbands homemade beer. I had to use smaller cuts of meat and could only find shoulder. It turned out pretty good. I did have to add more salt and I don't think the meat was the best to use since it wasn't fatty enough. That being said, it was a good recipe and I can't wait to try it again with the right ingredients and the right cut of meat.

Delicious and so easy. They were right, you can't taste the beer. It's great topped with provolone cheese. YUM.

We loved this.  Followed the recipe but added some spices (garlic, oregano, etc.).  Just used budweiser beer, but would maybe try more of an ale next time. Cooked for 7 hours and then sliced and put back in juices. Ended up leaving it there for another 2 hours (got busy) and it was wonderfully moist and tender.  I used a bottom round roast as my butcher did not have a rump roast.  This is definitely a favorite.  Thanks!

I added garlic.  Also I used almost a 3lb roast and still kept the rest of the ingredients the same and it turned out well. If I used a bigger roast I think you should add more soup or broth, especially if you like the dipping sauce.

YUM! Both the men in my house really liked this. :)
I think next time I make it I'll follow other reviewers' suggestions and only use 1/2can of beer. I could reeeeally taste the beer in this, and I'm not sure if I liked that. Other than that, perfect!

My family wasn't too sure about this but once they tried dipping their sandwich they were hooked! Only problem I had was that the broth turned out greasy from the roast.

I used a sirloin roast, 2 cans of consumme, 1 can of french onion soup, a bottle of Sierra Nevada, seasoned to my liking, and used pepper jack cheese and green chiles. The meat was tender but I thought the beer was way too overpowering. I would use less beer or go with something a little lighter. This recipe was okay, but I would still prefer to get some roast beef from the deli, and throw it in with some au jus and a jar of heinz or boston market beef gravy. Mmmm....

I definitely like this recipe, however next time I will be adding a lot more spices to make the meat more flavorful.  It definitely needs some garlic, salt, pepper, etc. to add some flavor.  I also added provolone cheese to the sandwiches which was great.  Overall a good recipe and very easy for a weeknight.

Very good. I followed the other reviews and seasoned and seared the meat before cooking.  I also added a package of mushroom onion soup mix (no water), worchestire sauce, garlic, mushrooms and seasoning as needed.  I also put cheese on the bread while in oven.  It was wonderful!  Very flavorful and the au jus was perfect!

My husband LOVES this recipe. It is in my permanent cooking schedule. The meat is so tender and delicious and the juice is perfect for dipping the sandwich in. I highly recommend this. It is so easy to make and so delicious. I have shared this recipe with ALL my friends and they are all cooking it now. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

We thought this was FANTASTIC!  I am serving it tonight for the second time in a week.  It is very easy.  I only made some very small additions:  I put garlic powder on the toasted rolls with the butter and I sauteed green pepper and onions in a smidgeon of butter and au jus from the meat.  I am so excited to add this meal into our meal rotation.

This was so good and so easy. I did as other's suggested and sliced the beef about a half hour before serving. Perhaps it was the cut of beef I used, but my beef was not very tender. I was hoping for really tender meat. Next time I'll try a different kind (I used Tender Chuck Roast because my grocery store didn't have Rump Roast). Also, I added some garlic powder, minced onions, worstershire and liquid smoke to mine (just a tad of each). We both devoured every bite and there wasn't much left today to bring for lunch. I saved the juices (beef broth/onion) and plan to use those later in the week for a French Onion Soup as another reviewer had suggested. Oh, and I put some shredded mozzarella on the buns and it was awesome! Thanks Robyn for the easy recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for the suggestions on how to improve it.

Big hit. I served with melted provolone on toasted buns along with mushrooms and onions. Most of my guests had two sandwiches. 

Very easy to make. The beef was so tender it sort of fell apart instead of slicing but wasn't a problem. I added a little garlic and will probably try using onion soup mix next to see how it turns out. Will certainly make again. 

Once again, a testimonial to power of the slow cooker.

Fabulous!  This was so yummy!  We'll be having this often!  It is so easy!  3 simple ingredients added to a crock pot and beef... let it sit all day and you're ready to eat!  I didn't make any alterations to this recipe and everyone loved it!  Even the kids loved it!

I was suprised how much I loved this recipe. I followed the advice and sliced the meat then returned it to the juice in the crockpot for about 45 minutes. Super moist and yummy! I also only used half the can of beer. Make sure it isn't light!

This was soo good!  And easy.  I used an Icehouse, added a splash of worchestershire sauce, and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  I also melted mozzarella over the meat and bread, in the oven.  Perfect.  Will definitely be making again!

Made this for Super Bowl and it was a big success.  I added about 1/4cup BBQ sauce after slicing the roast for the last hour of cooking just to give it that 'zip'.  Will definately be making this one again.  Thanks.

This wasn't great. The only thing that saved it from tasting like potroast was the melted provolone on the bread. I don't think I'll make it again.

MMMMMMMmmmmmmm!!! This beef comes out so tender and delicious. I used about a 3.5lb chuck roast (well trimmed), 1 can French Onion Soup (onions removed, yuck can onions), 1 Can Beef Consume, seasoned roast w/ a little sea salt/pepper, garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. After 6 hours I removed the beef and cut it up, I then strained the liquid twice and placed everything back in the slow cooker for another hour. Also, I tasted the au jus at that point and had to add a bit more seasoning to it. Served on buttery toasted French rolls w/ melted mozzarella cheese and a side of vegetables. BIG winner at my house! Who knew something so good could be made at home by an ordinary cook?!? This is going in the Sunday rotation, it's so nice to come home from church and smell the wonderful aroma!

Fixed this yesterday for the Super Bowl.  Wow, was it easy.  I added onion, worchestershire sauce and a can of Consommé and garlic.  I used a 3lb chuck roast, sliced it like others suggested and put it back in the liquid for another hour.  DELICIOUS!  I cant wait to make it again. HUGE HIT.  Thanks!

I have made this over and over for my picky teenagers and finicky husband. It is so easy and delicious. I drop it all in the crockpot before work, and the house smells great when we come home starving from work. GREAT for working, time crunched Moms!!

AWESOME!!! Definitely give it 10-12 hrs. to cook on slow BUT about 2 hours before serving, remove beef, slice and cut up, return to cooker.  Makes all the difference in the world !!!!!

This was a fabulous sandwich!  I used some suggestions...beef consumme, worcestershire, minced garlic and montreal steak seasoning while cooking.  I cooked on low for 10 hours while I was at work.  I added sliced onion and swiss cheese before broiling and added horseradish spread after it came out of the oven.  Delicious!!!!

I made this today and it was good. My 11 year old even liked it. I think I bought the wrong piece of rump roast though because mine came out a little tougher than I wanted it. I think it was a bottom rump roast something. Other than that it was a good sandwich we added a slice of jalapeno cheese on top.

This was easy to make and has great flavor. I used a dry french onion mix, half the amount of beer and double the amount of beef stock. Also added onions and some Worcestershire sauce. Be sure to remove as much fat as possible or it will be very greasy. I will make this agian for sure, thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe!! I too added the sliced onions just because we like them with our sandwiches. I also took the meat out and shredded it and added it back to the pot and then put the crock pot on warm until supper time.I did use  a sirloin tip roast just because that is my favorite roast.

I had thought I already reviewed this. I used a homemade French onion soup I had made instead of just the beer. I brought this to work for our holiday party, I didn't have any, but, everyone that did eat it loved it. I had trouble slicing it however. I will definitely try this again, a good use of leftover French onion soup!

This recipe was excellent!  I couldn't find the canned onion soup, so I just used a packet of the dry mix and water.  The juice that was left over, I added crushed canned tomatoes, come corn, green beans and potatoes, and made awesome soup the next day.

We all loved it! This was so fantastic. The flavor was perfectly blended and it was so easy to make. I cut the recipe in half for our family. After slicing the beef I put it back in the sauce to keep everything hot. I also put mozzarella on the hot bread and put it all under the broiler just until the chesse was melted. I will be making this for my next big gathering!  YUM!!!

My family simply loves this meal - including the children!  I prefer to use an arm roast because it seems to be less dry.  I have made this recipe many times and I prefer to use light beer.  Also, the last time I made it I didn't have the French onion soup and I think we liked it even more! I didn't know that was possible.  I do also salt my meat before cooking. We could eat this every week.

Very Easy to Make and the sauce was much better than most places I have had french dip. The seven hours was a little long for my roast (although I bought the cheap stuff , so maybe that was the problem) as it was over cooked in my opinion. Everyone who had it loved it.

This was okay.  It would have been very bland without the changes I made.  I added worcestershire sauce, extra salt, two packets of dry Lipton soup mix, and a can of cola instead of beer.

This was really good - especially for being sooooo simple!  I added in 1/2t onion powder, 1/2t garlic powder, a good shake of pepper, and 1T of worcestershire.  We'll definitely be making this again!

PERFECT recipe for the working wife!  I cooked the roast on low for 10 hours while away at the office and upon return my home smelled like heaven!  I added a packet of onion seasoning & used Sam Adams Boston Lager.  You couldn't taste the beer - but it definitely have a very unique "au juis" flavor.  This will be made again!!

This is easy to make.  The only modification I made was I added a package of Lipton Onion Soup.  I also, pulled the roast out when it was just about done and sliced it and returned it to the slow cooker.  Made for some nice sandwiches on a cold day!

This was excellent!  I made some of the recommended changes, using less beer, some extra spices and worcestershire and it was very good.  We didn't have French rolls, so I made it on Pillsbury French Bread (from a tube), which wasn't the greatest substitution as it got mushy from the juice in the meat.  On the right bread, I think it's fantastic!

wonderful recipe.  After cooking for about five hours I thinly sliced the meat and let put it back in the cooker.  It helped tenderize the beef and soaked up the juices better.  Everyone gobbled this up.  Thank you!

Made it exactly as the recipe called for except I just about doubled it.  Used Guinness Extra Stout and a boneless rump roast; after putting the meat and cheese on the buns I browned the cheese under the broiler for a bit.  Usually a crock pot full of food will last my boyfriend a week (we are on different schedules so I always have something for him to eat when he gets in)...this lasted only 2 days!  The broth with the bits of beef made the best French Onion Soup I've ever had.  We'll be making this one again and again!

YUMMY!!  I used a 1.5 pd roast and let it cook for 2.25 hrs.  I wish I had time to cook it a little longer as it still had the slightest, tiniest beer taste (I hate beer) but I think another half an hour would have been perfect.

YUMMY!!  My family loved this!  I made it exactly as written except that I sliced it about an hour before serving and put it back in the crock pot.  This is definitely going to become a favorite for us.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I thought this was pretty tasty also, but changed a few things...

I used the butt roast recommended but found it to shred to easily when slicing - but did turn out very tender.  I also added garlic, red pepper flakes, and worstechire.  I also used a package of dry french onion soup mix prepared as the package states with water and a can of beef broth and the beer.  Was very tasty and would make again but would try a different cut of beef.

AMAZING! My changes: Used a pre-sliced sandwich beef, added garlic salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 an onion sliced and doubled the beef broth and french onion soup. I used Fat Tire beer. This was soooo good and I'm not a big meat eater. My kids ages 6 and 4 loved it as well, my daughter said "can I have this for snack tomorrow after school"

Unbelievable...and yet so simple to make!  My only change was to add some fresh minced garlic and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce!  Slow cooking for seven hours the flavors were perfect and the meat was tender and juicy!  I used toasted onion rolls and melted provolone to top the sandwiches off!  Great meal to server while watching a Sunday night football game!

Awesome!  My sister and sister-in-law were talking about it and I was blown away when I finally got around to making it.  I would safely say that I never even liked roast beef and/or french dips.  With this recipe- I love them!

This recipe I thought was fantastic. It did taste more like a pot roast type sandwich, but I still really enjoyed the flavor. I added the french onion soup mix and the au jus gravy packet. My husband did not like this recipe as well as my son and I did. But he's really picky.

Oh my goodness, this is excellent! I followed the tips from others & added garlic pepper, seasoning salt & 1/2 a package of dried onion soup mix. I sliced the meat & added it back to juice for 30 minutes. This is one of my favorite slow cooker recipes!!!!

This was wonderful and moist, and I think the beer made a big difference.  I used Warsteiner and it brought out a lot! of beefy flavor and I also added mozzarella.  This one's a keeper!

We really liked this.  I just wish I'd read the other reviews first and gotten some provolone cheese to put on these.  I used a chuck roast and thought this was really flavorful.   Definitely a good recipe for an easy night!  Thank you!

I usually love any recipes I get from Allrecipes, but I'm completely baffled by this one.  I'm no amateur cook, yet I could not have been any more disappointed with this recipe.  The meat was dry and tasted like an ordinary pot roast.  The au jus was salty and bitter--and I DID follow the directions carefully and accurately.  I finally strained out the meat and used it in BBQ'd beef sandwiches.  Now, THAT was great.  I'm sorry, I can't and wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't let that stop me from using lots of other recipes on your site because many of them are all they promise.

I didn't think this was that great. Granted my cut of cut wasn't the best but the au jus wasn't very flavorful either. My roast didn't slice it just fell apart, not necessarily the recipes fault but it did just taste like a potr roast on bread. I may try again with a better cut of roast and modifying the au jus to add more flavor!

Take it from someone who read a LOT of reviews on this; if you like a good french dip, go turn on your slow cooker.  You wont be disappointed!

My family absolutely loved this recipe!  It was convenient, easy (I think it took me about 4 minutes to open the cans and 1 minute to pour them all into the crockpot) and delicious.  I added about half of a fresh onion to the mix because my family loves onions on their sandwiches.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was mainly just a roast beef sandwich.  I followed the recipe exactly the way it states and even added provolone cheese and I didn't like it very much.  The au jus dipping sauce just tasted like roast beef broth didn't taste like the au jus sauce I have had before.  Thanks for the recipe however I won't make again.

THIS IS ONE MEAL THAT MY FAMILY ABSOLUTELY LOVED....THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS I USED A LOAF OF FRENCH BREAD, SO I COULD CUT THE SIZE I WANTED FOR MY KIDS.  MY HUSBAND TOOK THE LEFT OVERS TO WORK THE FOLLOWING DAY, AND EVERYONE WAS IN AWE BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL SMELL LINGERING THE JOB SITE.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE....IT WILL BE USED OFTEN!!!

Wow!  This recipe is easy, no prep time, and makes some of the best frnch dip sandwiches my wife and I have ever had.  I melted provolone on the rolls like previous reviewers suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This recipe is a keeper and will be a regular on my table.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the result; the meat was very bland, but the au jus was good.  Next time I will definately season the meat before cooking.

Made this for the family last night and they loved it.  It gets 5 stars for taste and 5 stars for ease of preparation.  I used a rump roast as the recipe states and it came out perfect.  I topped them with provolone cheese and leftover green and red bell peppers and red onions from fajitas the night before.  YUM!  Also, I'm cutting back on carbs and rolled it in a Lo Carb whole wheat tortilla and thought it was even better.  Even my 11 yr old son preferred it on the whole wheat tortilla.  (easier to handle for little hands)  I will make this again and again... and again... :) UPDATE:  Made this again last night and the only beer I had in the fridge was Corona.  I was a little hesitant using a Mexican beer in a French Dip, but it turned out just as good.

So simple... great to come home to.  Great flavor with minimum effort.  It's best to use the suggested roast to be sure that the meat will be tender.

YUMMY.....This was an excellent recipe that offers some versatility.   I used a 3lb pot roast, and seasoned the pot roast with a little garlic,seasoning salt, and accent. put in the crock pot with the other ingredients.  cooked on low.  Toasting the buns is a must it gave the sandwiches an authentic taste.  Wonderful. This will be added to my favorites.

This recipe is so good and so easy.  You could serve this to a crowd in the same amount of time that it would take you to make it for just a few people.  I love putting this on to cook before I leave to go somewhere and when I get back, dinner is done!  
*Edit-I have made a few changes and now I believe that it's even better.  Now I add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and some salt and pepper to the cooking liquid.  Wow!  Yum!  I could eat the juice as just a soup at that point and be happy.

Made this yesterday for dinner with a chuck roast.  Like others I peppered and garlic powdered the roast before adding the liquids (to which I added a TBS or so of woistashire and maybe 1/4 c of red wine). It made it very tasty and I agree it will make a great french onion soup base for tonight.  Thanks!!

This turned out very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly but mine needed extra salt. Maybe I used a low sodium beef nroth I can't remember...so next time I will use regular or add more salt. It had more of a roast beef flavor ( maybe because of the cut of beef?) than a french dip so next time I think I wall add a packet of au jus to it as well. Will try it again.

My meat came out a smidge dry, but that could have been the cut.  The flavor was great and I'll definitely try again.

Fabulous! A little salty for me, but I just added some water to tone it down. I do not have a slow cooker so I took the advice of another review and made it in a pan, covered it with foil and baked it at a low setting all day. My b/f loved this!

Made this several years ago and forgot to rate it.  My whole family enjoyed this french dip. I could not believe that I used a can of beer, because I could not taste it at all.  Great recipe and will be making again.  Thanks for sharing:)

Really delicious! I served it for my parents who were in town and it was a hit. I bought bagettes and toasted them with a little olive oil and garlic, put the meat on, and back in the oven for a few minutes to let the cheese slice melt.

This was easy and pretty good although I thought my meat was a little dry. I am going to blame it on the cut though and try again.  Served on toasted hoagies with provolone and au jus on the side, next time will have some horseradish.

This was great, I added onion,garlic,bisto granules and used merlot instead of beer. I made these french dips with the french rolls from this site and there were no left overs. It's a keeper.

This is a keeper - very simple. Used the Knorr French Onion Mix and added sliced shallots and chopped garlic. Served on hoagies and on onion rolls with side salad. For special treat, fried some frozen waffle fries in peanut oil.  This made ten servings for us.

Excellent! I followed the recipe amost exactly adding only black pepper and garlic salt. I spread the bun with horseradish mayo and topped with provolone and put under broiler until melted and toasty -- then topped with the beef. Really nice flavor and oh so easy! A keeper -- thanks!

The meat was tender but a little dry.  Anyway, I thought this recipe was pretty good.  My husband on the other hand thought it was great!  I just love the idea of coming home after a long day of work and having dinner waiting for me.

So good!!!!  French dip sub is my favorite sandwich.  I will get one where ever I go if it is on the menu.  This was the first time I ever made a French dip sub at home and I have to say I was a little skeptical that it was going to be very good.  It turned out so good and I will definitely make it again and again and again.  The beer gave it the kick that it needed.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

Turned out very well; tasty and couldn't be easier.  Sauted some mushrooms, green peppers, and onions to add to the sandwiches and served with baby carrots, cucumber slices, grape tomatoes, and leftover mac & cheese on the side.

So easy and so very wonderful.  I also added carmelized onions and provolone cheese then put the sandwiches under the broiler until melted.  I paired with the "Baked Zuchinni Chips" recipe and it was perfect!  I am already planning to make it again this week.

A great slow cooking recipe!  My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Instead of using just the au jus for dipping, I created a cheese dipping sauce (inspired by a local restaurant).  I used a can of  Cambells Cheddar cheese soup, and some of the existing au jus, heated it, and served it along side of the french dip.  It was great!

So good, so easy!  A family fave, "birthday quality", that is their highest rating.  I don't change a thing, and it is fabulous.  Occaisionally we might add some sliced provolone, and saute a few sliced onions and red or green bell peppers to make it a bit more like a philly cheese-steak, but we still dip them!

What a wonderful recipe and so easy and Tasty. The only this i did different was add a little seasoning to the roast before cooking it. The roast was so tender and the au jus was very flavorful

I thought this was pretty good, but it's not ground-breaking as I had hoped.  Others have mentioned that the beer is undetectable, and this is definitely true.  I wish it had added a little bit of flavor.

I will make this again, but it just didn't seem that different from every other pot roast I've ever tasted.  Not much like a French Dip at all...

I was disappointed.   I didn't have beer, so I added some Burgandy wine.   Salt/Pepper, garlic powder, & worchester.   There might be some other spice I put in there too.   With all that, it dried out, wasn't moist at least.  So if I make it again, I will have to work a half day and watch it.

I was really not a fan of the 'au jus' here... the french onion taste was really overwhelming to me. I also didn't cook the roast the full length of time and it still ended up dry... but that may have been my slow cooker too!

Wonderful recipe! My husband could not stop talking about..I used Guiness for the beer, and french onion soup mix. I also seasoned the roast with garlic powder, salt and pepper before putting it in the slow cooker. I adjusted the seasoning of the broth to my taste once the roast was cooked. I cooked the roast on low for about 10 hours, and the meat was so tender it fell apart. Definitly will make again and again! thanks!!

This recipe tastes great and was super easy.  I used leftover beef to make beef and noddles.  My family loved it !

I used dry onion soup mix instead of the canned soup and it was the best!  Even my single son cn do this one and his friends are impressed!

Very easy, very good and makes good leftovers.  Served on toasted rolls with provolone.  The only change I will make is the type of meat I use.  I don't think the rump roast was the right call -- too stewy.  Maybe something less grainy next time.

First of all- I thought this was very good and I'll make it again. The only thing is that I felt it was missing something but this could be because my mom has always used coffee in hers. I may try experimenting next time to see if that's what's missing or not. Even still, it was good!

Pretty good,  I did follow others suggestions and put in some garlic powder, soy sauce, and worcestershire.  Served on rolls with sauteed onions and mushrooms and a little cheese.  I did cut up the meat at 7 hrs and put it back in for another hour or so. Maybe my cut of meat wasn't the best - I thought the meat would have been more tender.  Overall good recipe and will make again - but I reserve 5 stars for outstanding recipes.

This was fabulous. I can't say enough! Loved the flavor of the dipping sauce. I used a loss expensive cut of beef and still turned out tender and delicious.

Okay - Not as good as some great restaurant quality French Dips like some in Los Angeles but it was an easy recipe. The meat needed an extra hour to "fall apart" so I cooked it for 8 hours but the au jus was lacking. I didn't like the choice of beer I made - Bass. It was too strong.

I added lipton beefy onion soup mix, a bottle of michelob lager, and garlic powder as suggested by others. After it was done cooking, I sliced it, returned it to the crock pot on low for about an hour. Had leftovers for only one sandwich.

The flavor was wonderful, but my roast ended up completely falling apart in the slow cooker. It ended up more like pot roast than french dip style roast beef.

This was so good.  I ended up seasoning the meat with Garlic Salt, Ground Pepper and Salt as well as used a darker beer.  It came out awesome.

I definitely won't make this again. This just didn't suit our taste buds at all.  It is so bland it's just tasteless.  And even though the meat I bought appeared very lean this still turned out so greasy that we couldn't use the au jus at all because of all the grease.  Just not my cup of tea.

Excellent flavor for french dip sandwiches.  I didn't have the onion canned soup so I used 1/2 pkg dry mix and water & beef broth.  I was afraid there would be too much beer taste (I'm not a fan), but it turned out wonderful.  My hubby loved it too!!!

I thought it was OK (although I'm not much of a French Dip person) but my husband thought it was pretty good. It's definately something to do different with roasts. My only problem was that the roast was falling apart at the end, so I couldn't slice the meat, so I shredded it instead, which turned out alright.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband thought the au jus had a funny taste, but I told him it was probably the beer that he was tasting and not expecting.  The next time I might leave out the beer and see how that works for his taste buds!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I think next time I will cook it an hour or two longer.  It was not as tender as I had hoped.  Still tasted great.  My husband and I had leftovers for lunch today.

This overall was a great recipe and I will definitely make it next time with modifications.  I did find this to be on the bland side. I think maybe the condensed version of beef broth may should of been used instead.  I do love the tenderness of the meat, I cut up the meat and returned it to juice for at least half an hour.

Excellent - I am not a slow cooker type person - I tried this and everyone loved it - will use again for sure - I love my french dip sandwiches - and this will be a keeper - I used garlic powder, and two dashes or worchestshire - i also could not get condensed french onion so i used lipton onion package soup - My kids are picky eaters and they had seconds.

I've made this twice and my roast does not get tender at all, certainly not enough to shred it.  The sauce tastes wonderful, but I guess I suggest using a top quality roast.

Wonderful flavors!  I made a much smaller cut of beef and it only took 90 minutes to cook.  We loved it.

First time I made this, I messed up and used a smaller cut of meat and it was too dry (I halfed the liquids).  The second time I used a better sized rump roast and used all the liquids- huge improvement!

Very yummy dinner receipe. I only made a few changes. I added provolone cheese slices and a packed of au jus mix as others suggested. I also thickened the dipping sauce a some cornstarch. Made with french fries from this site.

This was perfect AS IS, but if you need to add anything for your individual tastes, go for it.  We used a local porter (Polygamy Porter, a Utah product) for the beer for stronger broth, and added a slice of swiss cheese on the sandwich for extra flavor.  The au jus makes a great gravy for hot roast beef over biscuits, too!  Just add a roux made with flour and butter and cook to desired consistency -- no additional seasonings required.

This is consistently good, and easy. Even my very picky 11 year old likes it. I skip the beer if I don't have any on hand, and it tastes fine without it. Be sure to trim visible fat from the roast first.

My Husband absolutely LOVED this. I added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic. I also only used a 2lb roast (made about 6 full sandwiches). We toasted the rolls for about 5 min on broil and then added the provolone for a few more. Will definitely be making this again and again. My husband even took the leftovers to work with him for lunch the next day.

This was super.  I made mistakes, and it still turned out great.  I accidentally cooked it on high for several hours (can't read the crockpot dial at 5AM) and it was still nice and moist.  And, I forgot to add the beer until several hours into cooking.  I added a teaspoon of rosemary, and a dash of garlic, along with the au jus mix that others suggested.  Everyone loved it.

We made this recipe last night. I added a bay leaf and used Samuel Adams Boston Lager.  It was easy and tasty.  By 7 hours the meat was falling apart, next time I'll decrease the cooking time by an hour so I can actually slice the meat so it won't be as messy.  I'll also sautee some onions to place on the sandwich and add either swiss or provolone cheese.  We'll definitely make this again.

Very good recipe! My husband loved it. I added 1 packet of Au Jus seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

I served on the buns with sauted onions and melted provolone. Wonderful recipe!

This was good, but was missing something. I tried to add more seasonings... but it still needed more. And for some reason was a little on the dry side. But when dipped it tasted better.

This was so good!  I use arm roast (Foreman's Choice) because I do not like all the fat in rump roast and it turned out wonderful.  Great flavor and very tender.  I didn't even have to use a knife to cut it!  Will definitely make again.

This was my first slow cooker meal after just purchasing one! It turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly as it was printed for the meat. I also sauteed up some mushrooms and onions to put on the sandwiches. We popped them into the oven for a couple of minutes after the sandwiches were assembled and it was great! Thanks for this recipe!

This is so easy and so tasty! I serve it on buttered toasted buns and sometimes for a different twist I serve it with melted provolone cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms.

This was alright.  I thought for all the time cooking the meat would have a lot more flavor but it was quite bland.  I added some spicy mustard to enhance the beef and did use the juice for dipping.  I didn't think my kids would like it at all but they surprised me and I think enjoyed it more than I did.  I may season it a bit more next time and see how it turns out.  The meat was very tender however and the house smelled great when we walked in the door.

Very simple and delish!  I used a nice strong ale and it gave it added a good robust flavor to the sauce.  I thickened the gravy a bit also, and added a slice of provolone on a kaiser roll.  This will become a classic in our house.

I've made this twice..once with au jus and once without.  I guess it was a little better with it.  I think it might be too oniony from the soup mix but I don't know how to resolve this.  For us 2 lbs. of top roast (very lean) with 6 portugese sub buns was the perfect ratio for one dinner and 2 lunches.

This is the first recipe I made with a slow cooker (well, besides queso). I must say, this is a keeper! I used the exact amounts in the recipe (my roast was more like 3.45 pounds) and added fresh mushrooms and a sliced onion to the broth. Use good beer - I had some Newcastle Brown Ale on hand that did the job. Towards the end when the roast started to get tender, I added a bit of corn startch to thicken up the broth. Served with rolls, mashed potatoes and fresh green beans - fantastic!

Very good.  I only used 1/2 can of beer, cause I hate beer. And put salt/pepper/garlic powder/ and sweet onions in with it. My family loved it but I felt that there was a little something missing. I think next time I'll add more spices and maybe try some other seasonings.

This was the first recipe I tried on our new slow cooker.  I served it with bread and cheese on top.  Also cut up onions and mushrooms and added to the mix with a good beer.  Good, but I don't know if I'll make it all the time.

This was was very easy, but the flavor wasn't too exciting.  I would add spices next time, and brown the meat a little first.

This was so easy and so tasty. My hubby took a sandwich to work with him the next day. I used provalone cheese on the sandwiches and for once silence filled the dining room because we were too busy eating!

I made this dish a few nights ago and it was fantastic!!  I didn't follow the recipie exactly because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I substituted the french onion soup with extra beef broth and a whole quartered onion, a dash of wortcheshire and a slpash of red wine.  I used the suggestion to add spices to the broth and melt cheese onto the bread.  This was definately a hit with my boyfried.  He said it was even good the next day in his lunch!  I will definately make this again and again!

This was a snap to make! I have limited time in the morning and this only took a couple of minutes to throw together. The meat was so tender by the time I got home that evening that it just fell apart! Yum. Definitly make with french fries - the au jus tastes great on them, too!

First time I made this was for my husband's family reunion and thought I'd throw this together. It turned out GREAT and everyone raved!! This web site is making me look good!! My husband is now expecting new recipes all the time now! What I loved was putting the beer in the crock pot!! We had to leave for errands on the day of the reunion and I had two crock pots going. We came back to dinner already done and three dogs drooling at the mouth for smelling the meat all day! Of course they loved it too! Another winner and will be made again!

great recipe.  I used an eye of round roast.  since I can't have MSG, I sliced a large sweet onion in the bottom of the crock pot.  I seasoned the roast with emeril's essence, salt and pepper and 1/4 cup red wine.  I then covered the whole thing with a 32 ounce beef broth (MSG free).  the onions were great on the sandwich and we took some advice from previous reviewers and melted cheese on the top under the broiler.  YUM!

This is really great!!  My roast was still partially frozen when I placed it in the crock pot, so I cooked it a little bit longer.  It turned out so tender and had a great flavor.  I followed the recipe as written, but did add sliced mozzarella cheese as I toasted the rolls.  YUM!

Absolutely great!The meat was very tender but didn't fall apart into strings.I browned the roast on all 4 sides first,I used Guinness and put slices of provolone cheese on the bread while I toasted it. Next time I'll add sliced sweet onion to the meat as it's cooking.(Just because I think it might be even better, if that's possible!)

YUMMY! I love this recipe, but if you use Campbell's brand beef broth and French Onion Soup you are looking at something like 1500mgs of sodium!  I think it is Swansons that makes an organic beef broth that is lower in sodium (by far), but I am still looking for a substitute for the French Onion Soup.

Very good!!  I prepared it just as directed.  I also sliced it with an electric knife, just because it is quicker.  It was very tender.  The dipping sauce was better than at restaurants as it wasn't too salty.  Oh, we could not taste the beer, just really good sandwiches.

This was a huge hit at my house.  I can hardly wait until tonight when we have leftovers!

I did add a package of au jus mix, substituted a package of onion soup mix for the condensed soup, beef consumme for the broth, and used a Shiner Bock amber ale.  And since they were on sale, I used a chuck roast.  

After cooking for about 4 hours, I took the meat out and sliced it very thin with an electric knife and then put it back in the slow cooker.  About an hour before serving, I sliced some mushrooms and added them to the pot. I also skipped the butter on the french rolls, split and toasted them and we topped each with a slice of provelone and then spooned on the french dip.  The meat was tender enough to cut with a fork.

This will absolutely be on a regular rotation at my house!

This dinner was excellent!
I worried I would not be able to cut in into good pieces for a sandwich, but it practically fell apart!

I give it 5 stars, and will surely be making this again!

I made this dish according to the recipe.  It was quite good and the meat was very tender, but the au jus seemed like it needed something - maybe salt.  Next time, I will add a packet of dry onion soup and some Worcestershire sauce to see if that helps.

This recipe was good by all means, but was definitly not a five star.  It was a bit bland for my taste, next time i will add salt before serving.  I served it with mashed potatoes and used the juice for gravy.

Great recipe. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added worchestershire sauce, thyme & garlic powder and served on rolls with grilled peppers, onion & cheese. Also used dry French Onion soup mix instead of condensed. The gravy was a bit thin so I thickened it with some flour once the meat was done. My husband loved the beer flavour!

This is a great recipe, I tend to make it a lot.  I like to add a couple of cloves of garlic and fresh ground pepper to the broth.  It looks more appealing if you strain the au jus before serving, but I don't always take the time to do it.  I'm usually too excited to dig in to my sandwich!  I also put provolone cheese on my rolls and broil them until the cheese bubbles.  The leftovers are excellent as well!

The best french onion soup ever.  My husband has said it is better than any resturant style he has had.

I have been using this recipe for years.  I do add more spices to the au jus, otherwise there isn't a whole lot of flavor.  This is the one recipe my husband always requests.  I like to make homemade potato chips with my mandolin slicer to go along with it.  Just use Lawry's seasoned salt on them for a different flavor.  I also toast my french rolls with provolone instead of butter.  I think I will try the dark beer as one reviewer suggested for added flavor.  This will always be in my top 5!  I saw one reviewer had a problem with the meat falling apart, but I actually prefer it...the more tender the better!  I love love love this.  Try it!  You can always make adjustments to suit your own taste but this is a great base recipe with few alterations needed.

Ok, this was my first time making a French Dip and i was really excited that it turned out.  The taste was AWESOME!  However, My Husband and I both agree it was pretty greasy.  If it wasn't for the Grease i would give it a Five.

My teenage daughter and I ate half of the beef just waiting for my husband to get home from work.  I added a heavy sprinkling of Lawry's Seasoning Salt, garlic, a dash of worcestershire and a Tbls. of Kitchen Bouquet.  I grilled garlic bread, placed the beef, provolone cheese, sauteed onions and peppers on top, and served it as an open-faced sandwich.  We will definitely have this again!  GREAT recipe!

First off, let it be known my idea of cooking is hamburger helper :)  With that being said, I made this for dinner this eve.  Followed directions just as listed.  It was good, but not great.  I could taste the beer, everyone else said they couldn't.  Perhaps because I knew it was in there, I could taste it.  Was still good, although I would not go out of my way to make it again.  Everyone else did like it.

This was the first time I had ever made french dips. My mom used to make them when I was little. These were awesome. The meat was juicy and perfectly done and the flavor was great. I am looking forward to making these again! Everyone that tried one loved them!

A quick, easy dinner!  We serve it on buttered, toasted rolls and make a horseradish sauce with horseradish and sour cream to go with it.  Even my kids love the sandwiches, minus the horseradish.  The meat is really tender!

YUMMY!  Use 1 can beef broth, 1 can beef consomme, 1 soup can water, 1 envelope dried onion soup mix and throw in veggies that I had around (celery, carrots, onion).  We've had this several times using whatever roast is on sale.  Great au jus to dip your sandwich in, my husband ate the broth like soup.  Have taken the crock pot to my mom's for dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  We use crusty rolls and provolone cheese and melt it under the broiler.  Mmmmmm...

As usual, I didn't have everything called for in the recipe. Having no french onion soup, I had to substitute 1 pack dry beefy onion soup, 3 beef bullion cubes, a dash of garlic powder and a cup of water. The only roast I had was a chuck which wouldn't slice so I shredded it and dumped it back in the pot with the juice. Took the rolls, split them, spread them with butter and a little garlic salt, put some shredded mozzarella on top and stuck them under the broiler until toasty and bubbly. The guests dipped their rolls in the "au jus soup" and said it was heaven! This recipe would be excellent for a beef and noodle soup. None of us could detect a beer taste and usually if there's beer in a recipe, my granddughter just turns her nose up. She loved this one! Thank you Robyn, I will use this recipe many times!

This is super easy, however, I feel it lacks something. Salt, garlic? My husband really liked it, but I felt it needed some salt or spice.  I used 1 can beef broth, and 1 can French Onion. And I added garlic powder, and 1 beef bouillon cube. When almost done I sliced and put back in juice to soak. Made a pot of packaged Au Jus and toasted buns on grill pan, added cheese and combined juice from roast with packaged Au Jus.  Was good. Will perfect and post.  Thanks.

It "ain't" quick but it sure was easy and it's worth the time to make! The meat came out very tender and tasted really, really good.  I melted swiss cheese on the bread. I did add onions in the sauce at the begining. I don't know if that changed the flavor of the dip or not but I didn't care for the au jus as much as the regular kind I'm used to. I give five stars for the sandwich but only two for the dip. The leftovers were even better the next day. I cut up the meat and left it in the slow cooker with the sauce, put it in the refer and let it soak overnight. The flavor of the meat the next day was even better! Wow! Great French Dip sandwiches!  Thanks for a great recipe Robyn!

Delicious!!  I didn't change anything.  I used "mini" kaiser rolls.  This recipe is so easy to make and turns out great.  I sliced the meat and returned to slow cooker to heat through and let meat get juicier.

This is my 13 year old son's favorite meal. He even orders the French Dip sandwich at restaurants to see if they compare- so far he has ordered it 5 times and continues to say mine is the best- and I love that because he has always been my pickiest eater. Btw, if I'm in a hurry I use deli sliced roast beef, make the au jus on the stove and it's still good - although not AS good. Also, I think the beer really adds a lot of flavor.

There isn't much more to add that hasn't already been said.  Very good recipe and extremely easy to make.  It tasted much better than it smelled.  The beer gave the juice sort of an odd smell.  I may try a can of cola in place of the beer next time, but it's good the way it is.  Be sure to buy really good bakery rolls, that really helped make this sandwich.  Good recipe, Robyn!

Absolutely delicious sandwich. I sliced the meat and returned to crock pot for the last hour of cooking. Meat was very tender and juicy. It's a favorite among all family members. Very easy and a meal in itself.

My husband, who is a picky eater, really liked this recipe (even though I think I overcooked it a bit).  It was so easy to make!  This will go into regular rotation.

This is a great recipe.  I cooked the meat for about 8 hours and it fell apart.  I used a mixture of the other reveiwers suggestions.  I used the beer, beef broth, french onion soup, beef consomme', and beefy mushroom soup.  It was very flavorful, and I didn't taste any of the beer.  I served it on toasted hoagies with provolone cheese then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  My husband loved this.

This is an excellent recipe. I also added 1 can beef consummate and had more than enough liquid. We ate it as French Dip, then the leftovers were made into Italian Beef sandwiches by adding a tbsp. orengano & garlic powder and cooking longer (you don't need garlic salt as the soups are salty enough!) Thanks for sharing this recipe; it's a keeper!

This recipe is so good and extremely easy to make.  Highly recommend it!  The only negative thing I could think of is the Au Jus is a bit bland.  I'm a huge salt and garlic fan though so that was enough for me.  .

This was sooooooo good.  I think it was as good or better then the ones you get in restaurants.  I used the beer, and I think it helps make the roast very tender.  When it was done I used an electric knife to cut up the roast as thinly as I could.  We like French Dip meat sliced thin, then I put it back into the crock pot to help keep it moist. I toasted the rolls on the grill instead of in the oven.  Thanks!  This is a great recipe.

Well it just dosent get easier than this! I used a package of dry onion soup mix too and light beer. I did quickly sear the roast on all sides to seal in the juices before I put it in the crockpot. I will make this again.

This one goes in my recipe box.  Excellent!!!  I used a 2.5lb bottom roast.  No beer, instead I used I can beef consummate, 1 can condensed beef broth and 1 can condensed french onion soup.  I did add a few slivers of garlic into the scored beef right before searing it.  We are eating the left overs right now and my hubby, who hates leftovers, requested it!!!  He also suggested that I pick up a few more pieces of that beef--while its on sale this week.  YUMMY!

TERRIFIC RECIPE!! I did try a few suggestions from other reviewers; used top round roast instead of rump, beef buillion instead of canned beef broth for intense flavor, added a tablespoon of french onion soup mix (to give more flavor to the canned soup), and a teaspoon of garlic salt.  My husband & I love this recipe and you really cannot taste one hint of beer!  Thank you so much for sharing Robyn!!!

Wow!  What a delicious, and easy recipe!  I made this over the LaborDay weekend, and enjoyed every bite!  I did use a can of Coke, instead of beer, as others had suggested, and it was fabulous.  I also studded the roast with garlic cloves (5 of them!), as is always done when a roast goes into my crock pot...for fabulous flavor.  After eating these yummy sandwiches for 2 days, there was still extra juice, along with a little meat which then became the base for the most delicious beef stew I've ever tasted!  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and will be enjoyed on many a weekend to come...thanks for the awesome recipe!

YUMMMMMMY!  I made this with a sirloin tip roast as I couldn't find any rump roasts.  THIS IS 5 Star restaurant quality. The only alteration I did was I ran the french onion soup through the blender as I don't like chunks of onion but I love the flavor.  I have 3 dogs and they all got some of the broth with their dog food and they also give you 5 stars!  Ruff! Ruff!!   Can't wait to make it again.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!

The way I made it, it's a meal in the crockpot. Since I used frozen meat I put the crockpot on high.  Only used 2# of beef, but kept all other ingredients the same. An hour before we were ready to eat I put a quarter of a box of linguini into the liquid and 1/2 hr before serving added 2 cans of mushrooms, liquid and all.  Delicious & easy!

We liked these, although the oven made the bread a little too crispy. The meat was so tender and had a lot of flavor.  We also added horseradish to the bread.

This was a delicious recipe. I browned the meat first (which was hard since 4lbs was heavy!) and used a can of bud light. It was a little salty, but we thought it was similar to what you would get at a restaurant. I don't have a meat carving knife, so even though the pieces were a little thick in places, we ended up with more than 6 (delicious) servings.

I'm not a beer drinker maybe that's the problem.  I ended up draining the liquid off before it had cooked too long and put on bottled Au Jus so i wouldn't waste the meat.

This turned out really well!  It was very flavorful and easy to prepare.  My husband and his visiting friend both raved about it!  And for me, I just melted a little Swiss cheese on my sandwich and it was absolutely perfect. Definitely going on our list of "regulars."

Tried this one with my unpleasable bunch. They liked it of the first time, the second time I used two cans of soup and used bullion cubes instead of beef broth so I could add three cubes to a can of water. WOW! Can you believe they request this. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I am giving this 5 stars because it really does have a good flavor.  My husband sliced this up for the meal and did not slice it very thin so it was more like roast beef sandwiches but tasted really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really good!  My husband threw it together one morning before work.  He was too lazy to trim the fat off (typical guy), so our juice was very greasy, but I have made this myself once before and the juice turns out well if you DO trim the fat.  My parents came over for dinner (they are on Adkins' diet) and they LOVED it plain (with no bread).  I will make this often!  So easy!

This is my favourite thing to order in a restaurant. I admit to being skeptical considering there were so few ingredients. I have to say that this is better than any restaurant has ever served me! The only thing I added was a can of beef broth! Excellent recipe!

Family liked it.  I did add some garlic powder to it,  it needed a little something extra.  I used Kings Hawaian Sandwich roll and toasted them up with butter,  and had a side a tater tots.  Will make again very yummy.

These were quite good, and very easy.  I do agree that they need a little something, but I don't know what.  We melted provolone on top, which was delicious.  I would make this again, but perhaps add some more seasoning.  My whole family did enjoy this meal.

This was just okay on flavor - seemed to be missing something.  I even added several cloves of chopped garlic as some others have suggested.  It is very easy, just not as good on taste as I expected.  I would add some wine vinegar and maybe some chilies or pepper flakes next time.

I thought this recipe was alright.  You could the beer.  I think next time I'll take others advice and use more beef broth instead of the beer.

This recipe was good and very easy to make. I left out the beer and subsituted beef broth instead and that could have accounted for the fact that while we thought it was good, it was nothing extrodinary.

Very good and easy.  I did like other readers and added worcestershire, garlic, and thyme.  I did use a little of the beer, but I will omit it all together next time.  I took a long french baquette, sliced it in big hunks and made sandwiches.  I also melted cheese on some of them and everyone loved it.  Great recipe!!!!

I bought my crock pot on Sunday and made this Wednesday and what a hit it was!!!  It was soooo super easy and so tender you barely needed a knife to cut it.  My kids & husband were in heaven (me too!)  I saved this in my recipe box so I can make it over again!  I order this out all the time and am so glad I can make it myself now!  And, I didn't change a thing from your recipe -- thanks for sharing!

Easy!! Just love crockpot recipes...I used a beef brisket instead of a rump roast. Turned out delicious....sliced thin and served (as suggested) on toasted buttered rolls. A small cup of the juice on the side for dipping....yummy! Very tasty and tender, will make again...maybe with a different cut of meat. Thanks for a great sandwhich!!

Three delicious meals came from this recipe. French Dip was even better the second night and finally I thickened the gravy and made mashed potatoes. Used condensed beef broth to add flavor. Took advice from reviewers and sliced meat very thinly (with an electric knife) and returned it to the au jus for another hour. Small french rolls were just right. Thanks for this recipe.

This is a super easy dinner. My family really enjoyed eating it. I made homemade french fries and salad.  I recommend it highly.

Delicious. Put it together before leaving for a Sunday afternoon football game. By the time we got home, it was all ready. A perfect (and easy) winter meal.

This is the best Roast Beef recipe. I am an extremely picky eater and I love it. I serve it on sweet bread with provel cheese and sprinkle a little seasoned salt on the sandwich before you eat it and it is delicious. To tell you how good it is my Mother-In-Law even said it was good! So easy my husband makes it now.

THIS WAS NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IN MY OPINION IT WAS BLAND. I HAD TO ADD ALOT OF SALT. I MADE MYSELF A HALF OF A SANDWICH AND DIDNT FINISH IT. I WOULD RATHER BUY DELI ROAST BEEF AND A PACKAGE OF AU JUS MIX. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT THREE STARS IS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND LIKED IT.

This was great! I made this exactly as written. Then I toasted the sesame seed rolls, added Swiss cheese and they were excellent. The au jus is perfect. I served the sandwiches with Greek Orzo Salad, also on this site. Everything was awesome. Thanks!   Erin

Roast turned out very tender.  Easy to make recipie that everyon enjoyed.  I tried the melted provolone cheese on the rolls, didn't care for the cheese.  I'd maybe use mozarella or no cheese next time!  This would be a great recipie to come home to after a day of skiing!

i'll have to agree with the other negative feedbacks on this one.  I cooked and followed the recipe to a "t" as well. The meat was dry and fell apart. Couldn't possibly cut nicely to make a sandwhich. If i didn't have the tasty ausjus though i don't think i could have eaten the rest.

This recipes was delicious.  I added mushrooms, sauteed onions, a splash of Worchestire sauce, and packet of McCormick's Au Jous sauce along with the indicated ingredients.  I let it cook for 4 hrs., then I sliced the meat in half, and let it cook another 4 hrs.  When I removed the meat for slicing, I let it sit untouched for ten minutes so it can asorb the juicies to prevent dry meat. After slicing, I placed the slices back into the pot for another ten minutes scooping it out with the mushrooms and onions. The meat was juicy, and the gravy was flavorful and delicious. Sooooo good!

I think this is a great, easy recipe. I used a smaller roast and substituted a packet of dry onion soup; cooked on low for 8 hours. Then, I shredded the meat and added some Italian peppers and juice... mixed it up and let it sit on low for another hour. Great!!

This was an easy recipe..I think I would have preferred it with real beef stock instead of beef broth in the can though.  It was a little too strong for my taste.

This recipe is a real winner - everyone loves it, and it's so easy. My only tip is that you need to cook it for the MAXIMUM time stated - two times I cooked this and the meat wasn't tender enough to shred.  Not the recipe creator's fault - just the cut of meat.  So cook this one a loooong time.  Once you do, though, it's terrific.

We didn't like this recipe at all.  The meat came out very tough and chewy.  My husband didn't like the broth either. I think we'll stick with the packets you can pick up at the grocery store.

This was so good I will definately make it again!  I had to cook it about 9.5 hours due to work and commute but the "worst" that happened was the meat fell apart into chunks that I then placed on the rolls.  I added a sliced onion to the pot to cook with it and served it in a bowl for those who wanted to top their sandwich.  Everyone raved!

This was so easy that my husband went to the fire station and made this for everyone.  When toasting the french rolls we put them in the oven for six minutes and then pull them out put shredded mozzerella cheese on them put back in for 4 minutes then add meat and eat.

Delicous as everyone says. We could however taste the beer, I think I'll leave it out next time and add more broth. I also grilled onions and put provolone cheese on our buns, it was great.

Merry Christmas, Robyn, and thanks for such a wonderful Christmas gift--this recipe to all of us who want something delicious and easy, as well. We used a rump roast, and started it before we went to bed. I'd wake up during the night and smell it cooking! Yum!  It is so flavorful and tasty! And here is the kicker, Robyn--I am a vegetarian--your dish tempted me too much and for the first time in years, I ate beef! Thanks again! I sauteed up some green peppers and mixed in after it was done. Try it--you'll love it, everyone! And Merry Christmas to all my fellow foodlovers and cooks out there!

This is truly wonderful. This recipe started an argument over "Mom's best dinners" and everyone decided that this recipe is in their top 5! Thanks for such a great recipe. The family has decided this is a "once a week" meal!

Great Recipe, my family loved it. I also sliced the meat and added it back into the broth to cook for an additional 30 minutes, I don't know if it made the meat more tender, I do know it was a great way to warm the meat. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

What a delicious and easy meal! I used a beef tip roast. I didn't have any beer in the house, but wanted to try it anyway. It was soo tender and the gravy was yummy. The French onion soup is a great ingredient, I think. I will be making this often-next time with the beer!

I was sceptical about the beer but it actually gave it that restaurant taste.  Mine was so tender it was difficult to slice thin.  Absolutely terrific.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I should have let the roast rest longer after removing from the slow cooker to make slicing easier.  I added a small amount of cornstarch with water to the gray to help thicken just a touch.

I also did this once in a electric pressure cooker.  This is great comfort food.  I just wished that I got myself a deli slicer to shave the beef into paper thin slices.  Slice the meat and return to broth.  Reheat and serve the next day.

After cooking for the 7 or so hours, I sliced the meat but still wanted a different texture. I then put all the sliced meat and juices in a pressure cooker for about 15 mins. and what a wonderful moist juicey tender meat. Thanks

I enjoyed this very much (as did my 6 year old) but my husband wasn't overly impessed.  It may have been the cut I used (bottom round).  I will make this again using the recommended cut of meat and add a bit more spice to it as well.

OH MY GOSH!  Definately a keeper!  I served the thinly sliced meet on potato rolls with horseradish, mustard and even ketchup on the side.  You can't stop at just one...Also, there was plenty of juice left over.  I was going to try french onion soup with the left over.

I don't know what everyone else is raving about. I could definitely taste the presence of beer in this recipe.  I would cut the amount by half.  
Nothing worth singing about.

I hate to give this recipe its seemingly first bad review, but I didn't think this was so great.  My meat turned out extremely dry and I followed the recipe to a "t".  Oh well.

This recipe was very good. It did need some salt and pepper added. My 11 year old loved it. We made little sandwiches with a french baguette since my husband bought home the wrong thing. They were great for dipping.

This IS a great one if you are a working mom!  Just put it all in the pot and go.  My children loved dipping their sandwiches. The meat was tender and flavorful. They didn't even mind it the next day as leftovers.

The beef was a *tad* dry, even though I cooked exactly according to recipes and ingredients.

Just a tad - still was excellent!

Easy and quick.  The meat was so tender.  It is a nice meal to come home to after a busy day.  I put the sauce in a custard dish and dish the sandwich in eat.  Enjoy with some mash potatoes on the side.

This recipe was excellent.  I just tried it out with a tiny 2 lb. rump roast, and cooked it in the slow cooker on medium (3) for about 4 hours.  There were no leftovers due to the small size of the cut of meat - will definitely go for the 4 pounder next time!  Might cut the beer in half, the kids commented on the taste of it being a little strong.  Simply delicious and couldn't be easier to make!

The flavor was absolutely wonderful! My only problem was that the meat wasn't very tender. I'm going to attribute that to a bad cut and next time I will use a cross rib roast. This was very tasty and easy!

Thought it needed some more flavor. The Au Jus was pretty good the meat just didnt seem to have absorbed much of the flavor.

My husband hates what he calls "Wet Meat".  He loved this.  My 1 year old cried when I took it away from her when I remembered it had beer in it.  I printed it out and gave copies to my co-workers.  But I have to admit I added a little beef boullion and I, um, er, a OK... I tried to thicken it with flour because I didn't know French Dip Beef was thin. But it was *still* good.  This is one of the easiest things I have ever made.  It took 5 minutes before I left for work.  Thank you

This is absolutely fabulous and it couldn't be easier!  This was an instant hit with my family.  They even asked for leftovers the next night.  I have passed this on to two friends and they both loved it, too.  This is on my 'tailgate recipe' list for next football season.  I used my meat slicer and the result was worth the hassle it takes to clean the slicer.(lots of non-removable parts)

After I talked my kids into trying it (they refused at first since the it contained beer), they absolutely loved it.  We carried it to a potluck dinner and it was gone in minutes.  The juice it created was great tasting and the beef itself turned out very moist, so moist that it fell apart while taking it out of the slow cooker.  I will definitely make this again.

My children were not too crazy about this recipe. However, it was a big hit with all the adults. It is even better, later, warmed up again in the crockpot. I served the sandwhiches on Turano French rolls, lots of jus, and added melted mozzarella cheese on top with hot peppers. Very tasty!

Frank was correct.  I had a venison roast in the freezer that I din't know how to cook. I used this recipe--added some garlic, salt, pepper, and carrots.  9 hours later-delicious-tasted like a tender roast beef.

Excellent!  I didn't trim the fat until after I cooked it, which probably isn't as healthy, but very very tasty.

I made this dish and served it with some grated Monterey Jack cheese and sauteed onions and bell peppers.  My husband and our neighbor had 2nd's and raved about it all night!

This took all of 5 minutes to throw into a crock pot. I put it on when everyone left for work and school, and dinner was ready when they got home.Serve w/ crosscut fries.I was able to catch up on housework and my favorite soap this day!!

I liked this, but honestly I didn't think it's worth the raves everyone is giving it.

We really enjoyed this recipe. the beef had an excellent taste and very tender. I added provolone cheese to the french bread while it was warming.
The beef was actually better the second day. Enjoy

This is a very easy recipe. I used dry onion soup mixed in water and it worked fine.  We ate it the first night sliced with veg and potatoes and the second night on a bun dipped in the juice. Will difinitely make this again.  It is so easy. If you have it sliced, make sure you soak the slices in the juice first or it may be a bit dry.

My husband just loved this recipe.  He said it was the best chuck roast he has had in the crock pot.  My only question, the recipe calls for chuck roast and the directions call for rump roast-which is it?

This was good - but not great. The beer was somewhat overpowering - but backed it down on the second try - and it was better,

A great idea.  Plan for leftovers.  I made it for my family and then went on a business trip for a week.
