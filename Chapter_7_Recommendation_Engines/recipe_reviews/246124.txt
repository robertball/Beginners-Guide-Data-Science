Wow -was super good!  used black beans, sprinkled with lime juice,  marinated steak in fijita sauce,  mixed chipotle with ranch dressing for topping,  fresh cilantro and cheeses of your choice.  included chunks of avocado,  sauteed peppers and onions and sirloin.   a little bit of extra prep - but sooo worth it!

Thanks!!

A bit of a pain to make but  THESE ARE  GOOD.  As my nickname goes I rarely give a 5 star (it is the BEST after all) but these nachos really are very good.

These are fantastic nachos - better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant, certainly.  I substituted the refried beans with some pre-prepared, homemade ones from a local Mexican tacqueria but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Amazing.

We absolutely LOVE these nachos.  The chipotle seasoning is crucial.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used store bought pico de gallo instead of tomatoes and used black beans instead of pinto beans.  Came out delicious and filling.  This is perfect for gameday or parties.  You can also make this vegetarian by just using more beans or using chopped mushrooms instead.  I will be showing this off for SuperBowl Sunday!

Great recipe! I modified it slightly by using hamburger instead of steak because I didn't have time to marinate it like I usually do. I also added lettuce and tomatoes. Loved it!
