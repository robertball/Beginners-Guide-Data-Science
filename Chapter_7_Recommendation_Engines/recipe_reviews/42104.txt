These were really tasty porkchops...  I didnt have any wine so instead I used about 1/2 cup pineapple juice from the crushed pineapple can for the marinade.  I also threw in some of the pineapple chunks into the marinade as well and then added some chopped fresh rosemary.  I marinated the chops for about 5 hours and they were really juicy.

Marinated over night, baked instead of grilled, added a little cajun spice.  Will definitely make again.

I skipped the wine and marinated only four hours, but it still turned out great.  The family has requested it again!

I didn't have the wine, and I didnt add soy sauce, but I used the rest of the ingredients (except I had fresh pineapple on hand) It was quite tasty! I also added red pepper and some spiced rum. The pork chops were still a tad dry in the center after being in the crock pot all day but they fell apart nicely. I would definately do this again.

Hear were the best pork chops I've ever made!  I made them up in the marinade and froze them then when they thawed out I grilled them. Absolutely delicious!  I will make these again!

Made this for dinner tonight. It was great with some smashed sweet potatoes. I didn't have wine so I used the pineapple juice as someone else had suggested. I also baked it in the oven, 350 for 40 min. I'm not a huge pork chop fan but I would definitely eat this again!!
