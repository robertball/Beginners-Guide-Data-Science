I loved this one! I read the other reviews, but didn't try boiling the beans first (I'll try that next time, just to be sure). I loved the sesame oil suggestion, so I put the seeds in but also subbed some of the vegegable oil w/sesame oil. To add kick, I recommend adding a bit of cayenne or other "hot" pepper while cooking the green beans. The beans were fresh, hot, and had the perfect blend of crisp- & tender- ness after only a few minutes on medium heat.  The short cook/prep time is right on, too!  It took me 12 minutes and then a few minutes on very low while my Pad Thai w/tofu (chicken for the husband!) finished up.

This will become a regular at home, and for get-togethers!

This is the best recipe I have ever used for green beans. My only regret is that I didn't have sesame seeds, but I don't think this dish could have tasted any better than it did. I used 3 cans of drained green beans instead of fresh. Excellent recipe, Robin!

Loved this recipe and my husband ate almost all of it. This recipe so simple and easy. I don't really like the taste of green beans so I am always looking for a green bean recipe that has a lot of flavor and this is it! I didn't have any sesame seeds so I used about 1 tsp. of sesame oil and it worked out fine. I served this with sweet and sour chicken (a recipe I found on here) and rice. It all went well together. Thanks for the recipe, it was great!

This is the turns green beans into crack once you eat them you cant stop. I used Almond butter instead of the Peanut butter and I added 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil the the sauce.

I can now say, "good bye" to the same old green beans I use to always make.  My husband and I loved this recipe. I made some slight changes this time.  I used Canola oil, Splenda brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce.  Next time(and there will be a next time because I find it difficult to get my husband to eat veggies) I'll try to stir fry the garlic with the beans (or to use a little less). Although I found the taste was really excellent I think I the raw garlic was a bit to strong for me.  I don't know much about cooking but I think it may help if I cook it a bit.

This is the best and I hate green beans.  Made the recipe as stated and will probably make again tonite.  Thank your for sharing!!!  UPDATE: Last time I made these, I parboiled them for 1-2 minutes...dryed them off and stir fryed as directed.  It seemed to speed up the stir fry time.  Thanks again....delicious!

These are so, so good! My 4-year-old, who usually has to be reminded to take another bite, actually asks for seconds of these. 

A few modifications for the recipe: I used the thin green beans from Trader Joe's (the whole bag!) and defrost them under running water in a collander. 

- Add the garlic to the greenbeans for the last minute of cooking to avoid the garlic becoming overpowering. 

- I omit the sesame seeds and use about a tablespoon of peanut butter 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, but I keep the sugar at about a teaspoon, maybe less. 

- I also add a little bit of Sriracha, more if the little guy isn't eating with us. 

These have become a regular in our house. So good!

Great recipe, I've made this twice already. I double that amount of sauce, but reduced the amount of brown sugar.

My 13 year old son, an aspiring chef, made this while I was making the main course and felt it needed more sauce so he doubled it.  I must say it was so flavorful and easy.  The only thing I may do differently is add the garlic in with the green beans as they're stir frying, but this is one recipe we will do again and again!!

Wonderful and tasty recipe. We loved this!! Added wasabi paste to the sauce and steamed the green beans instead of frying them. Also used more reduced sodium soy sauce. Cannot wait to make these again and again.

I love this recipe!  So easy and quick!  I haven't liked beans since we had to pick them from the garden and eat them all the time.  I actually had seconds of these beans!  I did steam them rather than stir frying to reduce the fat content so I can't really call it green bean stir-fry anymore, but I am so glad to have the recipe for the sauce,  I wanted to go ahead and review it in the hopes that floks don't miss out on this tasty treat!

I give these a 10, my husband gave them a 2. I guess he only likes green beans from the can...who knew. I love the flavor this gives the beans, and I can't wait to make it again so I can eat it all by myself.

Very tasty! I doubled the amount of sauce for a pound of green beans, and added extra peanut butter. Steamed the beans just to crisp tender and then stir fried them with the sauce. We all enjoyed this.

I made these because of the review that said the sauce made the green beans as addictive as crack.  It was pretty good but I might not go that far.  I added some crushed red pepper which added some nice heat.  Beans will definitely be crispy and retain a nice fresh flavor.  I threw in lots more sesame seeds because they are just fun and yummy.

Easy and delicious!  The peanut butter flavor is not that strong; could add more if you particularly like the flavor.

Our first green beans out of the garden and I tried this recipe for  6.  Didn't use nearly as much PB, since that's such a strong flavor, only had one clove of garlic, which was just right for us, but followed remaining instructions to the letter.  Those beans were eaten well ahead of my entree and I had 2 little faces ( 8 and 11 years old) asking if there was more!  Totally delightful recipe and I can't wait to do it again at the request of everyone! When I can get the little guys to eat their veggies first, you can bet this will be a keeper.  MANY thanks.  We just harvested green beans for the first time (July 2012) and everyone asked me to "cook the beans with the peanut butter".  I did and increased the recipe to 12 servings!  Not one bean left over. I can't help but giggle when something is this easy AND this good, AND attracts the tastebuds  of my entire family!

This may be my favorite green bean recipe of all time! I doubled the sauce. The peanut butter really makes the recipe, though my kids weren't keen on it. Oh well, more for me!

These were delicious!! I highly recommend this to anyone! The only changes I made was I cut down the oil to 1 tablespoon and I added about 4-5 shakes of a tabasco sauce bottle to give it a little kick. I might add a tiny bit more tabasco next time though. I think this recipe would be great to stir-fry chicken in as well! I hope to try adding some chicken with the green beans sometime soon!

Wow, this was absolutely fabulous and so easy!  I didn't have the sesame seeds but didn't miss them.  I wouldn't recommend steaming the green beans because then you'll miss that great caramelized, browned flavor from sauteeing them.  This is going to be the only way I prepare green beans from now on.  Thanks!!!

This is an excellent recipe as written. Everyone that I've graced with this gift of fine cuisine, has asked for the recipe. There are NEVER leftovers, regardless of how much I prepare. I actually caught a friend filling a ziplock bag with intent to steal...(I was flattered, I assure you). Two things I do a bit differently though it's certainly not necessary to enjoy this dish: I steam the green beans,(don't boil, EVER), and often times use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. Since I'm not stir frying, I wisk the oil into the other ingredients. I get a wonderful smooth pudding-like texture, and then toss it with the hot green beans. Either way, you can't go wrong with this recipe! (Unless you overcook the beans!).

It doesn't get any better than this folks.  Seriously, this will be my new go-to recipe for fresh green beans!  I parboiled my beans first and then quick- fried them so they wouldn't be too squeaky. Then added the ingredients as stated in the recipe. Yumm-o!  :o)

Doubled the sauce.  Used canned green beans (but would be much better with fresh) and didn't toast the sesame seeds and didn't use the oil.  LOVED LOVED this recipe.  GREAT flavor!

I have been meaning to review this for awhile now. The green beans are just excellent! My only comment would be to watch the amount of peanut butter you use, I used to much one time and they were not as good as they usually are. 

This receipt is a keeper though, I have made it several times and will keep on making it!

This was very good but it needed something--a few drops of chili oil or something.  I'll try that when I make it again.  I will probably also double the sauce--didn't seem like enough.

I have to be honest, I was a little scared about this recipe, with the brown sugar and peanut butter I thought it'd be either too sweet or too like peanut sauce, which my hubby and I don't like. We were plesantly surprised. This recipe was fantastic! I added a few drops of chili sauce to add some spice. We loved it and we'll be making it over and over again!

YUMMMMM! I was looking for an asian green bean recipe because my son, who is from Liaoning province in China, does not like "American" green beans. I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not have sesame seeds. It was fine without them. Will be making this a lot more. Thanks for the excellent recipe Robin.

Yummy! I didn't have brown sugar so I used splenda instead. I also used honey roasted peanut butter. I will definitely make this again. My eight-year-old daughter loved it!

These were so simple & soooo good! The only thing I change, is to add the chopped garlic to the pan about a minute before the green beans are done. I think it's a little better when the garlic isn't raw. :)

Very good! Lots of requests for the recipe. My only suggestions are that you need to get the beans out of the pan ASAP after done cooking or else they tend to get a bit limp looking. Also, make these as close to actual eating time as possible-they don't sit well. They do not lose flavor, they just being to look a little on the limp and mushy side.

My family has enjoyed this side dish a number of times. I have learned to make the sauce in the serving bowl and then add the stir-fried beans directly to the serving bowl and toss with the sauce that way.  One less bowl to clean and still turns out tasty.

Love this recipe easy and quick. I did double the recipe for the sauce.I have used the sauce on other stir-fry. Tonight it's broccoli and left over pork loin. Just cut meat and broccoli up and followed the rest of the directions. Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious!  I steamed the beans in the microwave first for a couple of minutes to soften them just a little.  I also used a little less oil and lite soy sauce to cut down on the sodium.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  What a nice flavor, and as some pointed out, it doesn't taste at all like peanut butter.

I was not impressed with the first bite, but it got better and better.  I would do as other reviewers have suggested and steam the green beans first.  Also I don't like salty food so I will try reduced sodium soy next time.

I thought this sounded different enough that it would either be really bad or good. This was really quite tasty and EASY. My daughter, who really is NOT a vegetable person, said "It is surprisingly good". My teenage son, who HATES peanut butter and green beans, said it was "okay" which is a really HUGE compliment. My husband and I thought it was really good. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

I stole this sauce recipe; added a garlic pwdr & chili's rather than raw garlic.  
Subbed blanched Chinese long beans, stir fried with onion, dry roasted peanuts and garlic with this sauce over top ... yum, this was good. 
May just add as a new recipe since I can never find anything to do with Chinese long beans on here .. thanks for the inspiration

This recipe is great. I've recently became a vegitarian and with an addition this recipe makes a great main dish for non-meat eaters. I don't have sesame seeds so instead I use chunky peanut butter for texture. I double the sauce recipe, add salt and pepper to the stir fry and add two cups cooked quinoa to the mix. Very yummy....

This actually ended up being quite good. I steamed the green beans since we like them tender, doubled the soy sauce, subbed 2 tsp. of sesame oil in lieu of 4.5 of veggie oil, and then cooked the green beans in the sauce mix with 3 garlic cloves for a few min. in a saucepan on medium. Then I added a heaping Tbsp. of dry toasted sesame seeds. 

My dad and I don't generally like green beans that much, but we enjoyed this as a way to use up the stash that came with our produce deliveries. I wouldn't buy green beans to make it, but I'll make it again until we're out of green beans. :)

Wow.  This was really good.  I didn't have sesame seeds so I stir fried in sesame oil.  No need to boil beans first.  Just get the oil really hot and don't be afraid if the beans turn a little black, they are really good.

Really nice flavor - great way to enhance your green beans. To cut down on the fat, I steamed the beans, added a tsp. of sesame oil to the dressing and then tossed. Best hot, however, I was hoping to serve as a room temp salad, but the peanut butter sort of congealed a bit. Bet it Would be delicious on any steamed or stir-fried veggies.

This was awesome!!  I can't stop eating them!!  I doubled the sauce and used about 1 1/4 pounds of green beans.  I loved the sauce, i was a little bit skeptical at first, but I'm glad I tried it.  I'll be making these a lot!

I have a bounty of yard long beans growing in my garden right now and needed something new to do with them. This was wonderful! These beans are quite thin and stirfried up very quickly in the hot oil (I used less than called for). The only thing I will do differently next time (and these really are THAT good) will be to use processed peanut butter. My natural one didn't blend very well even though it was still delicious. (I'll probably reduce the amount of sugar when I do this.) Oh, and I didn't have any sesame seeds so used some sesame seed oil instead. (Maybe another time I'll use tahini for the peanut butter! Mmm!)

The beans never cooked through so I ended up adding some water and steaming them. I wouldn't stir fry the beans this way again, but the sauce was great. I'll save the recipe for the sauce and double it next time.  I'll probably roast the beans, though.

Hot dang these are good! I'm giving them four stars just because I added sesame oil and just eye-balled the measurements. Also added the garlic during the last couple minutes of cooking time, so it wouldn't be raw. I'm eating these for dinner tonight - just these! I have no desire for anything else. :)

Excellent flavor; very easy to prepare.  I made it with frozen green beans as well as fresh.  I prefer the fresh because I like the beans a bit on the crispy side.  This dish is a winner.

I thought this was fabulous!!! Made it exactly as described, however, I thought it didn't need as much vegetable oil.  The second time I made it, I only added 2tsp of vegetable oil and it was just as wonderful!  Next time I might try peanut oil or canola oil since vegetable oil is not the healthiest option.  Overall, LOVE THIS RECIPE and will make it again!

Great recipe!  I used frozen green beans and it turned out just fine.  Instead of cooking them in oil I simply steamed them with a little water.  The sauce was a little sweet for my liking so I added a little extra soy sauce.  But the pb/soy combo was delish!!

I can't say i've been much of a green bean fan, but I absolutly love this dish.  The whole family eats their green beans now even the 2 picky kids. The only change I made was adding a little sesame seed oil when stir frying and then a little bit more to the peanut butter sauce.

My family loves this!  Especially my picky 7 year old.  When I don't have sesame seeds on hand, I crush some peanuts and put it on top.  I also add red pepper flakes and double the sauce.  Delish!

Great recipe! I steamed the beans in the microwave for 3 minutes before stir frying. I'm thinking that next time, I will steam for 2 minutes and make the sauce with a little less peanut butter to make the dish a little lighter.

Delicious! I would maybe 1/2 the sauce, though, if you like green beans. The sauce its good, but seems to overpower the bean flavor. I made these with Pad Thai, and my fiance loved it!

I substituted soy nut butter, as I am allergic to peanuts and it turned out great! Super easy. Also didn't have sesame seeds, so left those out, but next time I will try it with them or at least sesame oil.

These are really good. Did not have fresh greens beans so I used frozen that I precooked and drained. I can not wait to use this recipe this summer with fresh beans from the garden. I did double the sauce as others suggested and I thought that it turned out just right. May add alittle fresh ginger and chili flakes next time since I like a little heat.

We loved this! I had some fresh green beans and wanted to try something new. I used a little less oil when cooking the beans and then I put the mixture on the beans while they were in the pan still. The heat kind of carmalized the mixture. YUM!

Yum!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I doubled the sauce because I am a sauce person.  I boiled the beans for 2 minutes before stir frying them because my husband prefers softer beans.  If you are worried about the Peanut Butter in them...don't.  It is an amazing flavor.

This turned out fabulous!  I didn't and wouldn't change a thing!  I doubled the recipe to serve 9 people, it all disappeared and 2 of the other families at the gathering asked for the recipe.

I'll be making this again very soon.

I was browsing through today’s photos and I happened upon this recipe.  I had everything except for the sesame seeds so I tried it and I’m so glad I did.  We enjoyed the taste and it went well with our grilled salmon.

Let me start by saying that there are maybe two foods in the universe that everyone in my family will eat. Since finding this recipe, I can make it three. I thought it needed low-sodium soy sauce (because it was a bit salty) and I'd like an idea for thinning out the peanut butter a bit so the sauce wouldn't be quite so thick, but my entire family raved at me not to change anything, just to make more next time. I'm a little stunned at what a huge hit it was. (I caught my stepson licking the empty bowl, having fought off my daughters for the privilege.) Thanks loads!

This is a great quick side dish. Be careful not to go over on the ingredients as you will have too much sauce

I was looking for new ways to cook my green beans, but I wanted to stay away from vegetable dishes that were smothered in bacon! This was surprisingly good, but I dunk the green beans in boiling water for a few minutes first. I added the sauce to the pan with my green beans and stirred it around with the heat turned off. The sauce came out a little too salty to my liking, but it was still good.

This one is a new favorite of mine!!  My guests rave about these things!  Because I don't care for "crunchy" beans, I steam them before I stir fry.    I serve them with sweet and sour chicken and fried rice or as a side with grilled chicken breasts.  My husband would eat them with anything and every meal if I would make them!

Awesome recipe.  My  4 1/2 year old twins went from never touching green beans to eating them like candy with this recipe :).  I Didn't have sesame seeds so substituted with toasted sesame oil.

These are amazing!  They are like Thai Peanut noodles with the bennefit of having your veggies!  The beans were not getting done to my liking by just stir frying so I added a little water and covered the pan for a few minutes.  I did add a little ground red pepper to spice it up.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!  I wish that it was the beginning of the summer instead of the end and I had lots more green beans in my garden to use with this recipe.

Delicious & VERY easy!  I stir fried the beans until they were more shriveled and puckered (like they serve them in a Chinese restaurant) and omitted the sesame seeds (I didn't have any.)  Turned out absolutely fantastic.  Very complex flavor for such a simple recipe!

Thanks for the recipe!  I used frozen French cut green beans.  Reminded me of Thai food.  Next time I am going to add a little cilantro and lime juice.  Even the kids loved it.

Great quick and easy dish. It goes really well with asian type meals. I only used about half the oil, but other than that I made as written. Make sure to follow the recipe carefully and remove the beans from the heat before adding the sauce. I didn't the first time I made this and the sauce completely burnt :(

My husband really liked this one! I thought the sauce was great, but next time I'll boil my beans before beginning the recipe--they were too crunchy for me! I used thawed frozen green beans. I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, and took the suggestion of replacing part of the oil with sesame oil, for a total of 3 tsp olive oil & 1 tsp sesame oil, which added a delicious flavor. The soy sauce gives these beans a definite Asian slant, which seemed to me to be begging for some Sriracha but I restrained myself this time--in the future I will add it for sure! Thanks for the recipe, I'll make this again :)

Absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately, I didn't have any sesame seeds so I added about a tsp of sesame oil.  Also, I wanted a little kick so I added some thai red chili sauce.  Amazing, I wish I had made more!

Great Great Recipe.  I doubled the sauce as I like a lot of sauce.  This is a fun way to make green beans.  I'm going to try this on other veggies next time as well.

this was really good.  I used sesame oil since I was making it with seared tuna and had it out already.  I did omit the peanut butter, but only bc my 1yo had to eat them and we haven't introduced him to peanut products.  I did top my husbands and mine with almond slices.

Um, YUM!  These we wonderful!  I did decide to add a little red pepper for added spice, but they are still 5 stars without it.  I only had chunky peanut butter, but wow.

I loved this!! but I'm giving it four stars becuase I wasn't sure how long to cook the green beans for and it doesn't exactly tell you in the recipe... :( I mean, I figured it out and they were AWESOME!! so it was okay, but I would of appreciated some kind of tip on how long is long enough. (I'm a novice chef.... ha) I added almonds just for kicks too and let those cook with the beans... very very good!

Awesome, soooooo good!  Made it for my husband and he literally licked the plate clean.  I doubled the sauce recipe and subbed honey for the brown sugar, and sauteed the fresh garlic with the green beans.  I also omitted the sesame seeds, using chunky peanut butter instead of creamy for the added crunch.  This was just delicious and I'm making it again soon!  Thanks so much.

We loved it! Next time (very soon,) I will steam the beans first so they aren't crunchy. The sauce was so good. My 3 year old gobbled them down and said she loved them.

This recipe is a real winner.  It only takes minutes to put together and tastes wonderful.  I used 1/4 tsp. garlic powder in place of garlic cloves as I didn't have any.  I also threw in some sliced almonds in place of sesame seeds for the same reason.  You can use canned green beans, but fresh will taste better.  I will be making this often.  It's a keeper.

Great recipe!!  I absolutely love fresh green beans, so I can't understand how some people have used canned green beans in this recipe!  Seems like that would be very mushy!  I like my green beans crisp!  I French-cut mine & also add some slivered almonds to the pan before I add the peanut sauce.  Tasty!  Thanks!

excellent,  everyone raved.   Made lots of beans and didn't increase sauce and it was great.   Added toasted sesame seeds last.

Really yummy.  I made a few adjustments though.  I added an extra clove of garlic, omitted the sesame seeds (didn't have any), a pinch of red pepper flakes, and pretty much just eyeballed the other ingrediants.  I also stir fried the beans in sesame oil and as they were cooking, added the sauce mixture so the garlic had a chance to cook and the sugar could caramelize.  The sauce turned out really thick and gooey and coated the beans perfectly.  Better than what you'd get at a restaurant!!  I'm editing to add that I used a couple of tablespoons of water to deglaze the pan while cooking the beans.

Wow, this was sooo good! I usually don't like green beans, but I loved the flavor of this dish! The only thing that I did differently was omit the sesame seeds since I didn't have any and used frozen green beans. Next time I'll have to try it with fresh green beans. :)

I loved this recipe. We didn't use the peanut butter as I have a little one who can't eat it yet but I did everything else the same. This is one of the only ways I can get my husband to eat green beans (he's not a vegetable lover.)

Delicious!  Very quick and easy, so I'm going to add it to the make again list.  Also very tasty!  I followed recipe, and used crunchy pb (what I have open), and it works great.  Might use less oil--my new pans are non stick and don't need much at all--but otherwise fantastic.  Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good.  I was a bit apprehensive about peanut butter and beans (I used was since that's what I had), but it just tasted like nutty beans.  Very good over white rice. I did steam the beans first since I don't like them crunchy.

I whipped this up real quick and thought it was pretty good.  I left out the sesame seeds since I was too lazy to toast them.  I cooked some minced garlic with the green beans.  Not bad...

Awesome!  Even the I-don't-eat-green-beans members of my family liked this receipe.  Also, we have food allergies, so I used soy butter instead of peanut butter.  I plan on fixing this many times!

These were fantastic!  I did boil the beans in water for about 2 min. before frying, my family doesn't likes them softer.  This is really easy and really yummy!!

This was the first time I tried this recipe and I was a little nervous since it was making its debut at a BBQ party we were having for about eight people. It was so easy to make and tasted DEE-LICIOUS that everyone was asking me about the recipe!!!  

The only thing I deviated from was that I stir-fried the fresh green beens a little longer and I used "crunchy" peanut butter and I think it added to the flavor.  Thumbs up on this one.  I will definitely be making it again.

I liked it, both my kids did not;  and they are NOT picky eaters.  (maybe if they hadn't known the ingredients ahead of time...)  Just hearing that peanut butter and green beans were going together probably influenced them!

Although upon looking at the recipe initially it seemed a bit odd, we tried it.  It was great!  I would recommend making the grean beans a bit smaller - halving them - so they cook through better (I also have the confound of a new pan, though).  It was a good recipe!

Awesome. This is easily my new favourite vegetable. I made what I thought was a tonne for four people - not a bean left left. Served it with baked tilapia and rice - our company loved it.
