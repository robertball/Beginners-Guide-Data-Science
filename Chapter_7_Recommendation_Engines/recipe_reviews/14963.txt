This is a very good idea, although I did alter the recipe.  I used my own macaroni noodles and added milk and velveeta for the cheese. I also added a quarter cup of salsa for a tangy taste. Very good and creamy.

I used Annie's white cheddar macaroni and some leftover taco meat I had in the fridge (cutting corners where I could which meant using something from the pantry and leftovers in the fridge--this saves both money and time. It's pretty much the same thing, ground beef and homemade taco seasoning if you want to get technical.). I did not try this myself but the kids thought this was great. This helped me make something quick for two hungry boys who absolutely did not want another sandwich for lunch. NO leftovers.

My husband and I like this when we're running late for dinner.  We use the Velveeta shells or elbow macaroni.  It's always been a hit with the wee ones as well.  Quick, easy and filling!  Thank you for sharing!

This was good and easy! I did change it up a bit.  I did use the white cheddar mac and cheese but I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chilies to the meat with the taco seasoning and let that simmer and then added the mac and cheese (cooked like directions on box)and let it all simmer together for about 10 minutes.  Very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait for leftovers tomorrow for lunch!

Great!  Just before adding the meet mixture, add a lot of fresh grated cheese and let it melt with the meet. Yummy!

Scrumptious! I made this with some slight variations (like added shredded gouda cheese since I had some and some taco meat). I wanted it for every meal until it was gone. Great Recipe : )

Sorry, I just didn't care for this at all.  Pretty strange taste combination.  Only my teenage "hoover" son ate some and mumbled something unpleasant in my direction as he poured himself a bowl of cereal instead!

Delicious alternative to Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni (which I love!)... and definitely more tasty! 

I made the recipe as stated, and we ate every bite - especially my 15 month-old son!

Tasty, nice variation on mac and chese. I used Kraft Homestyle Mac and chese because that was all I had. My husband really liked it and I thought it was good too but I will probably add a few seasonings to my taste next time.

Not too bad! My husband requested Hamburger Helper and I was at a loss, so I did a little looking and this is what I decided on (with a few modifications). Very comparable and actually pretty tasty. A nice and easy quick fix, especially for a night when Christmas preparation is trumping my desire to make supper :) I did mine all in one pot like you would for Hamburger Helper and it worked out just fine.

I'd rather have hamburger helper. Better flavor and you only use one pot. No one in the family was thrilled with this.

We really loved this! The only thing we did different was instead of elbow macaroni we used shells. Very tasty, definitely will be adding to our rotation.

We love making this and it is a regular on the menu. We like to use the regular Kraft Mac and Cheese. In the meat mixture we use two of the Taco Seasoning packs to add flavor to it. Also we add about two tablespoons of salsa and one tablespoon of queso. Then serve with Tositos multigrain scoops and it is outstanding everytime.

The idea sounds good but I already knew it was going be depressing when I read the ingredients. I wasn't wrong. I'm going to give it another try but instead of powdered box mix I'm gonna just use milk and cheese (cheddar, gruyere, cream cheese) and instead of "packaged taco mix, I'm probably going to go for something closer to the stuff used in chile con carne and make some kinda of "chile con mac and cheese" unholy concoction... actually I'll probably use that soup over the milk and just make it super cheesy. Hmmmm sounds like a plan.

I made this dish a little more healthy and vegetarian friendly by using a whole wheat macaroni kit and Boca. I also added about a half cup of salsa. It was delicious!

Looked unappetising and tasted blandish.  My daughter and I ate a half a bowl each and went 'eh' and couldnt eat the rest.  Not bad - just boring.  Probably best suited to kids/toddlers lunches.

If your family loves hamburger helper, they will go nuts over this recipe! The only change that I made was adding fresh lime juice over the meat

I made this for my boyfriend's picky son. Pretty easy? Check. Tasted okay to the adults too? Check. Works for me.

My family LOVED this dish!  I did change it up a little bit.  I used regular Velveeta mac n cheese and just cooked the hamburger with a lot of onion and garlic powders and some of the seasonings used for tacos, since I didn't have the prepackaged in the cabinet.  I also added some frozen chopped spinach to get some veggies into the kids.  They all raved about it.  I will make this a lot, I'm afraid!!
