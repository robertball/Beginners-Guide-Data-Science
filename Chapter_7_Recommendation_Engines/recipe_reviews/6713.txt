Wonderful!!!
I took the advise of other reviews and did 1cup white sugar and 1cup Brown sugar. I also used an electric mixer. The batter was so creamy, I ate alot of it raw(yummmm). I did have to cook it for an extra 15 minutes to get it done. I also toasted my pecans in a pan with butter flavored Pam before I put them in the batter. I sprayed both pans with Butter flavored Pam then sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar(mixed) in the bottom of each pan added the batter then sprinkled the top of each with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Both came out of the pan clean and the top was sooooo good. I got this idea from another review as well. 
I looked at every recipe on this site before I decided on this one. I only found two reviews that were negative for this recipe and I have decided the cook must have done something wrong or their oven was not working properly. 
I am very pleased and will make this often!

I have a reputation at work as being our best baker, but I didn't have a banana bread recipe I was confident to share...until now!  I made this for the first time tonight with a few substitutions:  half shortening/half applesauce; removed 1 c. of the sugar; added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  It turned out perfectly moist and delicious.  NOW I have to decide IF I'm even going to take one of the loaves to work!  Thanks, Teri Lynn for a classic recipe to add to my recipe box!

This is THE BEST banana bread!  I recently made it with SPLENDA sugar substitute and added 1 tsp extra baking soda and 2 tbl molasses.  It turned out much lighter (in weight of course) and was more cake-like in texture. I was also pleasantly surprised with the taste.  Good for us diabetics. Thanks for this versatile recipe.

My husband is very picky when it comes to banana bread.  I have tried about 5 different recipes now to find the one "like his mom used to make."  My search is finally over.  We both love this banana bread.  It is moist and just fanatastic.  I made one loaf with chopped pecans (I didn't have any walnuts on hand) and the other loaf plain.  I am not sure which loaf we liked best.  I always dread getting the end pieces too, but the entire loaf was wonderful.  Absolutely perfect!!  I wouldn't change a thing!

I used this recipe for muffins - bake 23 minutes.
To quote my husband, "These are the best muffins I've ever had."  I halved the recipe, used 3 bananas, which yielded almost 2 dozen muffins.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to half the batch for the choco-holics in the family.

This recipe is awesome, very cheap too. I made 40 loaves for Christmas gifts wrapped them in nice kitchen towels with color matching lace, all that for less than a dollar per gift. Wonderful, moist and flavorful. I added chocolate chips and left tiny pieces of banana "unmashed" for a different touch.

If I could give this recipe six stars I would!!  Very moist and tasty.  I did cut back on sugar by a half cup.  My old recipe was dry, This one is definitely a keeper.

Well, with all the high ratings, you know this is a keeper. The bread was so rich and moist! I didn't have 5 ripe bananas-only 4. I also didn't add nuts. It's awesome!

Easy, good recipe.  Very good banana flavor.  The best banana bread recipe I have found so far.  It makes a double batch so you can either cut it in half or freeze one loaf, it freezes very well. Thanks

This is for you chocolate lovers!  
I am a total nonconformist when it comes to baking.  I used 1C white sugar and 1C brown sugar.  I also took out about 1.5C of the batter and put it into a small bowl.  I added 1.5 Tb. of cocoa powder, 1Tb. of white sugar, 1Tb melted butter and chocolate chip.  Mix that all up, pour the banana batter into bread pans and drop the chocolate banana batter on top.  Take a butter knife and swirl it all around.  Super Yummy!

I've made this recipe several times now and have made adjustments as I've gone.  I think it's perfect now.  I substituted 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter for the 1 cup of shortening. I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of the white sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the dry ingredients before combining them with the wet ingredients.  
In addition to this, I cut down on the baking time by baking them at 325 degrees, and making 12 jumbo muffins instead of the 2 loaves. 
 This recipe is the perfect amount for 12 jumbo muffins.
Very good flavor with the brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks for the recipe.

Nice basic banana bread. I made this recipe as small gift loaves so I needed a bigger volume recipe. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar back to one cup (my bananas were nice and ripe--no need for that much sugar) and because I am low on butter, I used a half cup of melted butter and substituted half homemade organic applesauce and half low-fat vanilla yogurt. I also added 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to lightly spice the loaves. I got 5 small gift loaves out of this one recipe, 1 1/2 cups batter to each loaf pan. 350 degrees for just over 30 minutes each and I was all set. Great recipe for me to use a surplus of ripe bananas and I was able to provide a random act of kindness for several people. NOTE: When I made this, I melted and cooled my butter, then wisked it into the wet ingredients. I wisked together the dry ingredients and folded the dry ingredients into the wet. This prevents overmixing and your bread dosen't peak up in the middle or turn out tough.

I tried this bread because I was out of butter which my regular recipe calls for. This bread was so awesome that it will be my new regular recipe! I made 6 loaves and substituted 1/3 of the shortening with applesauce and it came out wonderfully. My whole family *loves* this bread. Highest recommendation!

I had 3 over-ripe bananas and no brown sugar so I searched and found this recipe.  I made a 12-serving size, one loaf and it was delicious.  This is the best banana recipe I've ever made.

An awesome, easy to follow recipe.  I substitute brown sugar for the white sugar, and use butter as the shortening.  Great as is!  I even baked for a competition at my job, and it won!

My first attempt at making banana bread and this turned out great!  I would, however, add some nutmeg and allspice to the recipe.

Love it! I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, as well as added a teaspoon of cinnamon. In one of my loaves I added walnuts and I think it really added to the excellence of this sweet bread. Definitely will make many more times!

Delish, delish, DELISH!! I'm munching a muffin right now. This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing.  I did use half whole wheat flour, half white, and substituted half applesauce for the shorting. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg, for personal taste. Baked perfectly, and is moist. Just delicious!

Excellent! This b.bread hits the mark with super moistness and 'breadyness'. This is not the puddingy, gummy kind of b.bread...it's dense yet the 2 loaves baked up quite nicely (compared to any other b.bread I've made). The only tip I have is..make sure your bananas are super ripe, mine were just turning and I think it effected the depth of the banana flavor in my bread. The loaves were still wonderful and gone in a flash. This is now the only banana bread recipe I will use. Thanks Teri

This banana bread recipe creates one of the best (if not the best) banana bread I've ever eaten. And that's saying something considering I used to stop and get Amish banana bread once a year and trust me it was delicious. This was even better. I did cut the recipe in half, added walnuts, and kept the middle slightly undercooked (just the way I like it) but I devoured half of the loaf within two days and I don't usually eat very much. The other half was given to some friends for a Christmas present and it disappeared within an hour. Try this, you won't be disappointed. Even the part that was completely cooked was amazing.

I thought I would try a different Banana Bread from the one that I usually bake.  I choose this one because of so many positive reviews.  I was very disappointed  the bread was just o.k. for me. Very little banana flavour considering you use 5 bananas.  I don't think I would make this again.

just like my Norwegian grandmother made! I've been looking for a good banana bread recipe for years and this is it. I used both brown sugar and white sugar. Also used 1/2 c. butter (didn't have enough shortening). I tossed in just a bit of cinnamon and a bit of cardamom. The bread was wonderful.

I made this bread and it is awful.  Crisp on the outside, a gooey, uncooked mess inside. While cooling, it fell flat in the middle.  Determined to find out what went wrong, I consulted an old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook which features a banana nut bread recipe I made years ago without a problem.  I was surprised to find that both recipes use all the same ingredients, with just vanilla added to this one, but it also has one glaring omission:  the bh&g recipe calls for baking POWDER, in addition to baking soda. I believe adding baking powder will prevent the collapse.  Also BH&G uses half the sugar (I know some reviewers said this recipe is too sweet).  And BH&G says to cook the bread at 350 degrees (not 300) for 45 to 50 minutes, which means the bread will bake throughout. I think the changes made in this recipe when compared to the old tried and true BH&G one ruined a wonderful bread.

How do I love thee .... This bread is near perfect!  I am not a fan of bananas, but I CANNOT leave this stuff alone!  I have tried pretty much ALL of the banana breads on this site.. this is our (me/sis/and all our kids & hubbies) favorite, by far.  The crust that forms  on the top is to die for...  the scent as it cools on the sideboard is heavenly... I could go on and on...

When a recipe has so many stellar reviews, I rarely bother with the low-star comments - but in this case, I wish I had, as the problems I had with this banana bread were exactly echoed by other members. I halved the recipe and followed it exactly, and my bread took 1 hour 40 minutes to bake at 300 degrees - as a result, it was too dark on the outside and the very middle was still slightly underdone.

After looking at 10+ other banana bread recipes, I notice that the vast majority called for being baked at 350 degrees. Most also added baking powder to the mix, which this recipe lacked. The flavor is good, though not quite as rich with banana flavor as I like, and the ingredients are convenient so I may try it again. But I would add 1/2 - 1 tsp of baking powder and bake at 350 degrees for 50 - 60 minutes. The recipe, as written, just doesn't work for single batches.

This set up so good. The cooking time was on the money. I still don't know if it's better than my Mom's, but will give some to my brother and see what he thinks! I can't help but tweak with recipes, but this one was fine without my intervention. Thanks for the good recipe.

I made this for family vacation. My brother-in-law said it was the best he'd had - and my family bakes.  From one batch of batter I made a plain, chocolate chip w/streusel top, & a streusel top with walnuts.  I used butter in lieu of shortening as well as large chips.  The butter worked well, I would use mini-chips next time.  Thx for the recipe!

Wonderful, moist, dense, lots of flavor.  I also went the 1 c brown, 1 c white sugar and added pecans.  Cooking time was about 10 minutes over the recipe, but that's probably the oven.  This one is a keeper and I've been making banana bread for a long time!  You go Teri!

Very yummy bread, although I had to make some revisions due to ingredients on hand.  I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the shortening.  And, I was out of baking soda, so used 6 t of baking powder instead.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts.  This recipe made two large, very dense and wonderful loaves.  We ate one and froze the other for later on.

This was very good!  I liked the texture.  It didn't have the wow factor for me that I expected.  Don't get me wrong this is very tasty.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar...because I was out of white sugar....So that may have something to do with it....Very good recipe.  I will be making again for sure!

I made bread for the first time this weekend using this recipe. It was easy to follow and yielded two fantastic loaves of bread. It makes me want to open a bakery and do this full time. I really enjoyed myself and my family is loving the bread. Thank you!

THIS IS WONDERFUL! I did change it a little like the others suggested. I added a couple teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and cloves. Used 1/2 brown sugar and half white, 5 1/2 bananas. I also sprayed the pan with butter non stick spray, sprinkled a handful of brown sugar on the bottom of pan as well as the top of the mix b4 baking. I used pecans and I used a blender to mix it all. It was the best bananna bread I have ever had. Will be making this alot! very moist !

very good bread.  i made a few changes just to make it a little healthier.  I subbed one cup of the flour for whole wheat flour.  Used only 2 cupS sugar and 1/2 of it was brown sugar.  I subbed half the shortening for butter and I also only used 3 eggs because that was all i had.  i added in just a small handful of pecans. No one can tell it has healthy changes to it.  next time, I will use 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and egg beaters for the eggs.

I made this twice in the past month. The second time I made it, I added a 1/2tsp nutmeg, a tsp cinammon, and  a 1/2 tsp allspice. I also browned some walnut bits and almond slices in  1 1/2 tbsp butter, about a tbsp brown sugar,and cinnamon sugar. Then I added 3/4 of that mixture to one of the loaves batter, and sprinkled the remaining on top of the loaf before baking it. And the last change I made was to dust the pan with cinnamon sugar. The additions were a nice and delicious change but the origianl recipe is just as good.I suggest only making the changes I made if you like a sweeter banana bread with more spices and a crunchy  nutty top.  I only added the nuts to one of the breads but both times I made this recipe I did dust the pans with cinammon sugar.

Excellent! Better than my mom's, and that is saying a lot.  My boyfriend said it was the best banana bread he ever had...better than his mom's, too!  So dense and moist  with rich banana flavor.  The only change I made was to replace 1/2 of the white sugar with brown sugar. I made one of the loaves for my boyfriend and he ate half of it before he left the night I made it. Thank you so much for this excellent banana bread recipe.

Loved, loved, LOVED this banana nut bread.  It was a huge hit with my family and my co-workers (made a loaf for each).  It had the perfect texture with a wonderful taste.  The only things I changed were using 1 c. white and 1 c. brown sugar for the sugar, 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco and 1/2 c. butter for the shortening, added a little (about 1/2 t.) cinnamon, and since I didn't have pecans on hand I used chopped toasted almonds.  Got rave reviews all around.  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a divine find! I used 6 bananas only because they were rather small. I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup of butter. I used 1 cup of white sugar and just shy of one cup of brown sugar. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. I dusted the pans with cinnamon sugar and also the top of the loaves. Four of us devoured one loaf in less than 2 hours! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Delicious!  It truly is sweet, it is banana cake vs. banana bread.  This is the first time I've ever been chided for cutting pieces for people too small!  My husband ate almost a whole loaf himself in two days.

Love this recipe!  Sprinkle a good amount of brown sugar on top before baking.  Irresistable!

When I made this banana bread,my boyfriend took it to his construction site and the guys ate the whole loaf within minutes! This bread is the best I have made yet! I used Crisco butter sticks and walnuts. I will keep this recipe around for a long time.

My husband purposely bought a dozen bananas and ate only 3 ( hint, hint).  I've never made banana bread, and this was so easy and we loved it so much, i have a feeling that I'll have a full stock of very well ripened bananas on hand courtesy of my husband!

Fantastic recipe that also yields six huge muffins and one large bread. I traded the shortening for butter and used the half brown and white sugar trick. This is now my go-to recipe for banana bread.

Awesome!  Actually could have made 3 loaves.  I used half brown and half white sugar as well.  I also used vegetable oil and 7 bananas because that's what I had.  My new go to for banana bread!  Thanks so much for sharing! Update Feb. 25/12. I make this weekly now it is the best and the easiest. half brown half white sugar and veg. oil as my lard. LOVE IT!!!

Great recipe!  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla so that I would have a nutty flavor.  I also added chocolate chips to the top of the loaves with 20 minutes remaining on the time.  Turned out great!

I made this with a few add ins. it was a huge hit with my picky family. I was going to add cinnamin and by mistake started sprinkling  red cayanne pepper probably about a tablespoon or more then sprinkled in cinnamin ginger and nutmeg along with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. it was delious. thanks for this recipe i will be making it again and again

Excellent!! I made a loaf for my 89 year old Grandma and she ate the entire loaf in a few days, said it was the best she ever had and she was always a wonderful baker so a huge compliment there!
I sprinkled the loaf pan with brown sugar and cinn. Also made muffins with chocolate chips in them, kids loved them!

I've made this recipe dozens of times for adult children and grandchildren and friends. It's a very good recipe, makes two loaves or 4 mini loaves and is a recipe you can play with. I like to add cinnamon, chocolate or butterscotch chips to it, different kinds of nuts and have even made a strudle topping for my loaves. Try this one... you will really enjoy it. My freezer ALWAYS has 2 or 3 small loaves I can give as gifts or thaw for afternoon tea.

I have been making bread for years...I wanted to try something new, so I found this recipe after extensive searching....The bread takes FOREVER to bake, it comes out Extremely DARK, and the middle is gooey, if you bake until the middle is done, the outside is burned.  I saw some warnings on this recipe before I tried, but I tried anyway, heed the warnings!

Made this recipe tonight and followed the ingredients exactly.  I added less than one cup of roasted pecans to the recipe and placed whole pecans on top then sprinkled it with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I baked it in a 300 degree oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes, and although it looked perfect, it was too well done. The inside of the cake was browned halfway up to the top;  I also added the 2 1/2 cups white sugar (scant) and it was a little too sweet.  I will make this again, but will cook it less time and use two cups of sugar.  I did not find the cake as moist as the other reviewers, but probably because it baked too long.

I have tried a dozen or so banana bread recipes since I've been with my husband, but have always received a simple "It's OK" review.  This one was given a "Fantastic!" review by my hubby as he ate 3/4 of the loaf in one sitting.  I did make one change to the original recipe.  I'm not a fan of cooking with shortening, so I used 1/2 cup butter + 1/2 cup oil instead.  And I also added a little cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe.

Teri, your recipe is the answer to my prayers!
Living in Texas we have more "ripe" bananas than
I would really care to admit.
We used to make the perfect banana bread by following a recipe that was printed in the banana
bags...where is the recipe? I don't know! However
we feel that yours is so much better because it
includes vanilla, which is a staple item in our
household...and we do not use any kind of cheap
vanilla, it has to be genuine Mexican vanilla.
Thanks so much for the BEST BANANA BREAD in the
net!

This is the recipe I have been looking for!  This was a very moist, very flavorful bread.  I added mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts, and it turned out wonderful.  It would be nice to have a per-cup measurement for the bananas, though, as they come in all sizes.  Five small bananas wouldn't be enough, and large bananas might make it too wet.

This is really good banana bread! The recipe is clear and easy to follow. I think it would be good with walnuts or pecans. Also, this recipe would be a great one to make with someone because it has separate little tasks in each step.

Tried this recipe for the first time tonight. It was excellent! My husband and myself really enjoyed it. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of white. Also used 1 cup of buttered shortening, and 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. nutmeg. Pans I used are 4 1/2 x 13, used both of them and baked for 1hr and 10 min. Will do this one again.

I had some bananas that had gotten ripened too quickly for me to eat them so I searched all over for a good banana bread recipe.  I was very hopeful when I tried this one but I was disappointed.  The bread came out really heavy and didn't bake well in the center.  I guess I will just have to go back to my grandmother's recipe.

I've been bakeing banana bread for over 30 years, & I made small loafes out of this recipe to share with neighbors who no longier bake! I sprayed the loaf pans well, with spray greese, & I just took it out of the oven & it had not raised, & it stuck to the pans as I took them out, to put on the cooling rack! I'll go back to my old tried & true recipe! They turn out well, & are a picture to give as gifts. I was not pleased with my results-- from this recipe. And it isn't like I haven't baked that much in my life time! Ha!

My boyfriend had 6 overripe bananas and was he just going to throw them away when I thought - "hey, I'll make some banana bread".  I had never made banana bread before and didn't even have a recipe.  So I went on the web and I found this recipe which uses 5 bananas so I decided to try it.  It was excellent - so moist and flavorful with a sweet crsipy top crust!  And it made two loaves - one for me and one for my boyfriend.  I think he's going to be buying bananas more often now!

This Banana Bread is really delicious.
I have made it many times and always get rave reviews.  I like the fact that I get 2 large loaves and that I can use up 5 very ripe bananas all at once. Sometimes for a change I add 1/2 cup Butterscotch Chips and reduce the white sugar by 1/2 cup.  It is different and really good. Adults and Grandkids love it.  Freezes well too.

My wife and I made 2 rather large loaves, absolutely gone within 24 hours.  This bread was flavorful and substantial, though not overly sweet nor heavy!  We can't wait to make more!  Thanks so much!!

This recipe is a lot like my own "family favorite" passed down by my grandmother.  However, this recipe seemed to come out more moist.  It is actually better if eaten on the second day.  Also, I usually use pecans instead of walnuts.

I just pulled these out of the oven as my 18 year old (picky) son walked in from school.  He ate an entire loaf and said it was the best banana bread he's ever eaten.  I did do as some suggested and did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I've been searching for the perfect banana bread...very flavorful, moist, banana-ey....and this is the best out of all the recipes I've tried. It's perfect. The only substitution I make is using yogurt instead of shortening. It's healthier...changes the texture to make it a little less crumbly and more chewy like bread, but in a good way. For variations try using cream cheese or sour cream or applesauce in place of oil or in this case shortening and if you wanna play around with the flavors try adding fresh/frozen fruit (strawberry banana bread is a good combination) or using peanut butter. This is my permanent base recipe for banana bread now and good by itself or with any of my tinkering when Im in the mood for something different! Happy baking! Yummy!!
Ps: walnuts are sooo good in this. Makes about 24 muffins if any one is curious, although I guess it depends on your muffin size.

Delish! I made it exactly the way the recipe said. The only drawbacks were that I had to cook the loaves for nearly another half hour than what the recipe stated, and upon cooling the center of the cake caved in a bit. Heck, I didn't care. The crust was so crispy and delicious and the cake is moist and soft. So easy, too!

Very moist. Excellent flavor. Perfect for that bunch of bananas you let get a bit too ripe.

My boyfriend can't get enough of this bread! I added 1 C of chopped Walnuts, and I also substituted 1 C of the white sugar for 1 C of light brown. This was the first time I've ever made bread, and it came out perfectly, thanks to this recipe! I have two beautiful loaves of banana bread!

very moist. Some changes: since i halved the recipe, i only 1/2 cup sugar cause I added 1/2 mini choc chips; for flour, i used 1/2 c all purp, 1/2 c whole wheat and 1/2 c 12 grain flours; i also used only 2 bananas. The 1/2 c sugar was plenty sweet. Fold the flour gently and do not overmix. it took forever to cook but it was worth the wait.

This recipe is hands down the best Banana Bread recipe ever, my family goes crazy for banana bread. I wanted to make into mini loves for the kids lunches, Using this recipe I also tried adding in 1/2 pkg of vanilla pudding and 2 tbsp of milk and it also turned out fantastic. Great Recipe Teri-Lynn thanks for sharing...

I adjusted size as I had 7 bananas. (Calculated for 34 servings.) This made 2 loaves and about 18 muffins.  I made this tonight using 1 1/2 cup egg substitute and per suggestions, used 2/3 cup applesauce & 2/3 cup oil for the shortening. I used 3 cups a.p. flour and 2 cups whole wheat, 1 cup white sugar, 2 cups packed brown sugar. Also added a 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp cardamom, and 2 cups of chopped walnuts.  This was very good.  Moist and not too sweet.  Thanx, Teri Lynn, for this wonderful recipe.

This came out fantastically, espeically for my first time making Banana Bread!! My boyfriend and I, and all my coworkers loved it! I will say that I used the half brown sugar and half white. I do think that it should be mentioned you will need two large mixing bowls and one small, I had to wash one then use it again haha. overall I loved this though.

This was my first attempt at banana bread and it got RAVE reviews. One of my coworkers interrupted training to come back for seconds yelling DANG this is good can I have another piece? I have another coworker who I am printing a copy off for because she LOVED it too! I made a "home" loaf in a pie pan because I only have one loaf pan, and the "work" loaf I added pecans to. It was wonderful! Thank you!

I used 1 cup of brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar to get more flavour. But i find that its too sweet - could be because the bananas already lend a lot of sweetness to the cake. Next time will probably cut the sugar by another 1/2 cup. The cake is moist & soft and not as dense as I expected it to be. But everyone who tasted the cake loves it. Maybe next time will try adding some sour cream to balance out the sweetness.

I had lost my old favorite - this more than made up for it! I added chopped nuts, because we love 'em in our banana bread, but this was so good it would have still been 5 stars without them. Moist and delicious :-)
One suggestion, that I've used for years with sweet breads of all sorts: instead of flouring the greased pan I use sugar, or in this case cinnamon sugar - it makes a lovely additional crunch and flavor rather than that floury taste, and works just as well.

This is THE BEST!  I followed the advice of other reviewers by using 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. granulated sugar; I also used substituted butter for half of the shortening with great results.  Sprinkling the loaf generously with the cinnamon-sugar mixture is a must!  This creates a moist crust with a unique look.  This loaf is dense and moist; if you're looking for light and cakey, search elsewhere.  By far the best banana bread recipe I've found to date.   I even received great compliments from someone who normally doesn't like banana bread!  Do yourself a favor and try this once--you'll never try another recipe.

Overall I would say this recipe is good, but it just isn't quite what I've been looking for.  I did take the advise from some other reviews and instead of 2 1/2 c. sugar, I used 1 c. sugar and 1 c. packed brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I think the cinnamon and nutmeg drown-out the banana taste too much and ended up tasting more like a zucchini bread or something!  This did turn out very good, but I was just looking for something heavier than this.  This recipe is very cake-like, which isn't bad and I would make this again, it just wasn't what I was looking for this time!

I followed the advice of several of the previous reviewers and changed a few things: 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves; used half white and half brown sugar; used pecans instead of walnuts (it's what I had)and I used 2 cups, chopped; sprinkled brown sugar/cinnamon blend on bottom of greased pan and on top of batter in the pan. The loaves come out quite easily and have a nice, sweet crunchy topping. I did have to cook the bread about 15 minutes longer but still very worth it. The best banana bread I have ever made. Everyone asks me to make this again and again. Thank you Teri Lynn for posting this recipe and thanks to the reviewers for adding the finishing touches!!!!!

This bread was sweet and light, just right.  I added walnuts. I baked and compared this 
bread to the Banana Banana Bread recipe.  I preferred this recipe.  The bread is not as dense, and it is sweeter than BBBread. Much lighter, and better overall.

This was a very good banana bread. I followed some tips from other bakers and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used 1/2 cup veg. shortening and 1 stick oleo instead of a whole cup of shortening, and I added a few dashes of cinnamon, next time I'll probably use a little more though. The texture was perfect. Next time I'll use 6 bananas instead of 5. I like a little more banana flavor.

Can anyone suggest a way to make this banana bread rise a little more? I love the bread, but my loaves are always flat on the top. More baking soda? Smaller pans?

One of the best banana breads I've tasted!  Unlike some banana breads that don't become moist until they've sat around for a couple days, this one is moist straight from the oven.  Oh, and no crack on top during baking!  I was too lazy to use my mixer and just stirred the batter by hand (used butter-flavored shortening and melted it first), and it came out great!

I use 3 eggs, bisquick reduced fat mix, Stevia in place of sugar, and applesauce instead of butter. It is delish!

I did half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I also tossed in about 1/2 a tablespoon of ground cinnamon. The kids LOVED it. For half a batch of muffins I also put some raisins in and that was good too.

Best banana bread I've ever had! Followed the recipe exactly, but baked it in mini loaf pans and baked for 35 minutes. Definitely going to make this again.

The best recipe yet and I've tried many. This always turns out perfectly. I make it with 3/4 c white sugar & 3/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c shortening. Next time I'm going to try it with 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce. I also dust the top with flaxseed for a nice touch. This is good cold, warm with butter, or cold w/ chocolate frosting!

Incredible. I made this last night but cut it down to one loaf, used 3 bananas instead of 2.5, added walnuts, and subbed half the white sugar with brown sugar. Came out fantastic and there won't be any left by tomorrow. :)

Excellent recipe!  We are a no-dairy household; so it was nice to see a recipe that didn't call for any of the ingredients we can't have.  Tasted fantastic and DIDN'T LAST LONG!  ;o)

i loved this recipe! it is so moist and reminds me of my mothers banana bread when i was a kid.
my oven only needed 55 minutes baking time. 
at first i was concerned it was a crispy crust, but after i let it cool i wrapped the loaf in saran wrap and the next day it was much softer, and kept the loaf nice and moist.
thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is my new favorite banana bread recipe!  I added pecans and made muffins - the recipe made 2 1/2 dozen.  I love the way the tops came out nice and crunchy, but the rest of the muffin was so moist.  Yummy!

I made this with butter and put the batter in 6 mini loaf pans. By mistake I had the oven set at 350 and over baked them, but the bread was still delicious, just a bit dry at the ends.

A solid recipe for banana bread. I used this recipe because my usual recipe calls for sour cream and for some reason I was out of sour cream and greek yogurt but needed to use up over ripe bananas. I did use cinnamon sugar to coat the pan and sprinkled over the top and that was fantastic and I seasoned the batter with cinnamon and nutmeg, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and added toasted chopped walnuts all things I usually do. Like I said, solid recipe but i'll be going back to my usual recipe next time.

Delicious!  My cookbook has a recipe that requires buttermilk, which I never seem to have on hand, so I was excited to find this recipe, which only required regular milk.  I also did what previous reviewers suggested- I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and let the bread stay in the oven for an extra 15 minutes after the timer went off.  Next time I think I'm going to try adding cranberries in, and make muffins instead of bread.

I usually make my grandmothers recipe but I couldn't find it and didn't ahve a lot of time to go hunting.  I found this one on Allrecipes and it sounded similar.  After reading a few of the reviews I decided to make a couple changes.  Reduced the sugar by 1 cup.  Used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 applesauce.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour to add to the texture and added 1 tsp cinamon and 1/2 tsp cardamom...  Everyone in my family loved them up.  Thanks for posting this recipe! It's become a new family recipe.

This is the best bananan bread recipe EVER!  And I don't like bananas! I have made 9 loaves of this in the last 2 weeks!  I have teens and they keep gobbling it up.  I did do what someone suggested and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. Was perfect! Also added toasted chopped pecans.  I put brown sugar and cinnamon mixed in the bottom of the pan and then sprinkled more top also.  Each batch made 3 loaves, I think my silicon loaf pans must be smaller. I only had to cook them for one hour.   I only used 3 bananas and it was just the right amount of flavor, not too over the top banana-y.  This stuff is just to die for!

I've made this recipe twice now. I took note of previous hints and use 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar, butter instead of shortening, add 1/2 tsp nutmeg, coat the pans with cin & sugar. I also cook this at 325.  I make one loaf with 3/4 c pecans and 1 loaf w/o nuts.  My family loves this bread.  I always have made bread out of old bananas so they have tried a lot of different recipes. This is "The One".

Excellent banana bread; however, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 2 Tbsp. of buttermilk.  I baked the bread for 1 hour and 20 mins and covered the loaves after removing from the oven.  The bread was moist, not soggy, and had a wonderful flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Pretty easy, too.

This has been the best/easiest recipe I've found. I doubled it and substituted half the butter with cranberry juice I also used half cake flour (and half all purpose) to make it even better. And I added watnuts - yum!

Wonderful! Very moist, not as dense, lighter and fluffier than most banana bread recipes, nice flavor and a great touch with the vanilla. I thought it sounded like an extreme amount, but it turned out fabulous. Thanks, I agree with your family, this is some of the best banana bread!

This was a nice dense bread. I did not use shortening. Instead I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil. I also used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar. Very good!

wow I have made bananna bread before and had many different recipes but decided to try this one, It came out clean from the pans and was so moist it melted in our mouth.  I would suggest any first time bananna bread maker to use this recipe.  I used butter flavor pam for the pans as suggested by another review and it was awesome

I love to make Banana Bread and up UNTIL NOW my family really didn't care for it as much as I did.  This recipe, along with the suggestions of others made this the best Banana Bread I ever made.  Moist yet not oily.  I substituted some Wheat Flour for all the white flour.  I think it adds something to the bread.  I just always have done this.  About 1/3 of the flour was wheat.  Also used half brown sugar.  I also put sugar and cinnamon on the pan after spraying with Pam.  AND I toasted the walnuts in a pan of a bit of oil, then added some sugar and cinnamon to them, then put them in the batter.  The loaves need to set a bit to firm up, but before I knew what was happening, the first one was gone - my husband (the one who really doesn't care for Banana Bread) ate nearly the whole thing.  I made 3 loaves b/c I had lots of bananas and it was really fantastic.  You won't be disappointed!  They also freeze great!!

This bread is OK. I took the advice of other members and added lots of cinnamon and some nutmeg. I also used 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/2 white, and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I read some of the reviews of others as well, and added about 1/2 tbsp of baking powder.  However, the bread still fell a little, and I did NOT open the oven until after about 50 minutes. It took a LOT longer to bake than the specified time, even though I made more, smaller loaves.The batter tasted really good, and I will try and make this again, but will add more baking powder, and cut out 1/2 cup of sugar, whether or not I add chocolate chips. It was rather sweet. I should add, too, that I had made this to give to my neighbor as a thank-you for helping me, but in light of the fact that it fell a little, I didn't think it looked good enough. But my husband and I enjoyed it, and froze some of it as well. I am not writing this one off, but it needs a few more tweaks.

This recipe is great! It is easy to prep. It was my first time making Banana Bread.The bread turned out fabulous!
My family quickly gobbled it away.
I only used 2 cups of white sugar.I used butter instead of shortening.
I coated the pans with butter, brown sugar, and walnuts. I placed on top of the batter walnuts & brown sugar. I had to be careful to cook the loaf exactly @ 300 as the recipe directed. The first loaf I cooked too fast at 350 resulting in an uneven texture. The second loaf at 300 was perfect! I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

The recipe I normally make calls for sour cream and because I didn't have any I made this recipe.  I THOUGHT my recipe was the best but I was wrong.  This is the best bread I have ever made or tasted.  I added 1 tsp banana extract and baked in a bundt pan for 1.5 hours.  It fell out of the pan beautifully and is now the only banana bread recipe I will use!

6 star recipe.  The only problem is it is too good.  I reviewed all the 5 star recipes and comments and made this one (added 1 cup choco chips- as it if wasnt rich enough!) and this seemed to be the winner.  Its amazing- almost more banana cake.  This is my last banana bread recipe, why mess with perfection?

This is an excellent banana bread recipe as is, or with 1-2 T. Cinnamon added.  My kids ask me to make this at least once a month, if not more.  It doesnt last long in my house!

very good! i added dried cranberries and walnuts to the bread and it turned out very good.  My loaves were a little thick so i had to lower the temperature to 250 to keep the bread from burning. i also used butter instead of shortening. it was a hit in my spanish class.

Followed the recipe exactly and all I can say is awful, awful, awful.  Heavy, sticky, gooey - yuck!  Both loaves went right in the trash.  A waste of ingredients for sure.

I cut this recipe in half.  I put it in a preheated oven 300 degrees.  I cooked for about 2 hours and it still came out gooey.  I double checked the recipe, time and temp.  I did everything right.  I will not make this again.

This bread is a consistant winner. I have made it so many times when bananas are over ripe. I make it in smaller loaf pans and add different optional ingredients. Shredded carrot, cinnamon chips, dried cherries and cranberries, they all work.  The best thing about this reciepe is that it freezes so well.  I give loaves away often as a gifts to friends and family. Everyone loves it.

Super easy.  I've made banana bread quite a few times and wanted to try a new recipe.  I added all my wet ingredients then in a separate bowl mixed all my dry ingredients then put them together.  Instead of shortening I used vegetable oil and I added 1 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  And I made banana bread muffins, before I put them in the oven I sprinkled cinnoman sugar on top.  They came out very good.  Made the top have a crunch. And baking powder made it fluffy.  I got the idea from another persons post for the top it was a great idea.  Easy enough for a beginner.  Next mission is to try it with Apple sauce to cut down on sugar since this recipe has just as much sugar as there is flour.  :)

I cut this in half since I didn't have enough flour to make 2. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used coconut oil in place of shortening and added a tsp. Of cinnamon. It turned out wonderful! A good basic recipe that you can tweak to your own like.

My first banana bread, and I don't believe I will be looking any further.  I have actually been reluctant to try banana bread after being told that it never bakes in the center.  This turned out beautifully.  I used Butter Flavored Crisco, which is one of my 'secret ingredients', but I made the recipe exactly as written.  Once cooled, I put the loaves in gallon size plastic bags overnight, and that softens the crust perfectly.  This was moist and beautiful......even in the center.  This might be the Christmas gift for the co-workers this season!

This is my first time making banana bread, and it turned out great. I don't have two loaf pans, so I used a 9x9. It took about an hour and 45 minutes and was a little difficult to get out of the pan, but it was very good. Very moist, as other reviews have found.

Have finally decided to rate this recipe after making it dozens of times over the past year or two. This is definitely the best banana bread recipe I have tried. The one thing I do differently is cut down on the sugar and use only about 3/4 of what is called for and use half white sugar and half brown. I usually make this in a mini(ish) loaf pan - that kind that has room for 4 small loaves.  I have found that 1 banana per loaf works perfectly. So if you happen to have one or two bananas on hand that are starting to get pretty brown that no one wants to eat anymore (like happens at my house) just adjust down and voila!

I was not impressed with this one.  Had too much of a shortening taste and not enough banana flavor.  I did change it by using half and half white and brown sugar and added cinnamon.  Won't be making again.

I baked this recipe into muffins! Loved it! Another reviewer posted how long she cooked her muffins, 23 minutes. I also added some chocolate chips! Wonderful recipe! I will come back to this one again!

I made this today and stuck to original recipe except for using half brown sugar, half white (I have a lot of brown sugar and need to use it up). It is delicious, so moist and flavorful. My husband and I both love it.

I only had 2 banana's so I scaled down the recipe to serving for 10 (1 loaf). It was gone in 5 min. Kids and even my mother-in-law loved it. Now I have to buy more banana's and wait....

I selected this recipe because I didnt have any butter on hand (turns out I didnt have any baking soda so I had to make an emergency trip to the store anyway!) and it is moist, a little chewy and great banana flavor. It will be my go to from now on!!

Made it for my co-workers and it was gone by the end of he day!  They loved it!  Did cut down on calories and fat some - used 1/2 applesauce for shortening; egg substitute and 1/2 of sugar was substituted with Splenda.  Was moist and tasted great!  Baked it in one bundt pan for something different.

All I can say is delicious...  Adding the streseul (cinnamon sugar mentioned in some of the reviews) was really good.  Even my friend (who hates banana bread) now makes this recipe.  A definite keeper!

I made this for Fathers Day.  All I did was add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 3/4 cups of walnuts.  I made 3 smaller loafs instead of two bigger ones, and cooked for an hour instead of 1 hour 15 minutes.  It's the day after Fathers Day and I don't have one piece left!  I guess I'll have to make more!  Great recipe, it's a keeper!

This is pretty good banana bread.  A little on the sweet side.  I used half vanilla and half almond extract (ran out of vanilla) and it gave good flavor, but almost overpowered the banana.  It baked up with a little lighter texture than a butter-based bread and almost crusty on top.  Tasty.

OMG. THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER. this recipe was so delicious, and the bread is still moist days later.  I didn't realize though that it was for two pans, so i made muffins as well and put chocolate chips in them. so good. but they cook a lot faster. Totally recommend it.

It was my first banana bread, and everyone has liked it! Good recipe as-is, if a little sweet. (Maybe it's because I couldn't believe I was measuring out 2 1/2 cups of sugar for it!) I also added a cup of chopped pecans for texture.

Real Good! My husband made banana bread for the first time tonight, using this recipe. I picked this recipe because, it was easy and it contained all the ingredients that we already had in the kitchen. Without having to go purchase other ingredients and rarely use them again. We don't cook or bake with salt, that was the only thing omitted. Just something we started many years ago for our parents, and we carry it on. Next time we are going to try adding more bananas. To see if we can achieve the banana rich flavor in the completed product. But I have to tell ya...this batter AS IS taste wonderful without baking. My husband and I could hardly put the spoon, beaters, and bowl down without trying to remove every spec, first...ha! Almost like banana pudding but better. Thank you for having it available on AllRecipes.com! 5 STARS!!!

This was a good recipe and I will make it again. You can reduce the sugar withour too much of a differene in taste. Debends on how sweet you want it. I did bake in a glass pyrex loaf pan and I think it may have had a small effect on my bread, I think is should have been more moist. Next time because all I have is that loaf pan, I will make sure to reduce the baking time by just a little bit to keep the bread a little more moist. Overall good and nothing a cold glass of MILK couldn't handle.

Really yummy!  I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 cinnamon applesauce. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 unbleached flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp. cinnamon for that great flavor that makes it stand out in the crowd of ordinary banana breads.  Yummy!

I've been looking for a fool-proof banana bread recipe, and this is definitely IT!  I made the following few minor adjustments, I used 6 very ripe bananas, decreased the sugar to 2 cups, and added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe turned out great.  I added a scant two cups of flaked, sweetened coconut, about 2 tsp of cinnamon, and a scant quarter tsp each of ground nutmeg and ground cloves.  I only had 2.5 bananas as well, but made the full recipe.  It turned out moist and yummy.

I used to work in a bakery/deli where we made homemade fresh breads everyday. I have had a hard time finding a recipe that is as good as the recipe to that bakery.

This, to me, was as good as that recipe. It was simple to make and came out wonderfully. 

I added walnuts in the batter and then sprinkled the top with more walnuts when I put it into the oven. It gives it a nice crunch. 

Love it!

This was a delicious bread that I plan on making many more times. I used butter flavor shortening as it was all that I had and it turned out great. Like some of the others suggested I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Also, I did not have any nuts but the taste was so rich and flavorful that we did not miss them at all!!

Delicious recipe! I also tried dusting the pan with cinnamon sugar as others had recommended, and it was soooo good...I wound up eating the crust first for each slice. It did take me extra time to cook...just check it frequently after the regular time is up.

Man, I wish I wasn't on a diet!  Smelled heavenly, and the husband and kids scarfed it down quickly.  They said it was the best they'd had, and from my family, that says a lot!  I'll make it again.

very good even though I accidentally baked it at 350 (this made the crust browner that I would have liked).  I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Hint:  don't open your oven door for the first half hour to keep the bread from falling.  Also, dust your nuts with flour before adding them to the batter to help keep them from sinking to the bottom of the bread.

Delicious!  The best banana bread I've had.  Dense, moist, and a nice crust.  We made the recipe twice in three days because the first batch disappeared!  I used half brown sugar and half white, and I added walnuts.  I baked it an extra 5 minutes to make sure it was done.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I've tried. I did go half white / half brown sugar like many suggested. I made one with nuts and one without and they were both delicious. Within a few minutes of them coming out of the oven 1 1/2 loaves were gone. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is amazing!  I used parkay margarine in place of shortening, reduced the baking time slightly, and made muffins instead of loafs.  The end result, fantastic.  So good, so moist and fluffy with a golden crispy top.  Heavenly - an instant family favorite.

This was excellent!  I used half brown and half white sugar but otherwise followed the recipe (and baking time) as written and it came out great and not at all undercooked.  My whole family loved it!

This was the best banana bread I have ever made. My 5 yr old daughter and 6 yr old neice thought so too as they ate a whole loaf themselves in two days, and my daughter doesnt even like babanas. I choose this recipe because I had ripe bananas but I was out of butter and margarine but had shortening. I also used 2 cups of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and added about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious!

I have never had or made a better banana bread in my life (don't tell my grandma!)  I made one loaf and a dozen muffins.  The recipe if VERY sweet and really cake-like.  My family loved it!  I did reduce the amount of sugar to 2 cups and in place of shortening I used half cinnamon applesauce and half shortening.  The only banana bread recipe I will use from now on.

This recipe is a keeper.  I wasn't able to find my loaf pans so I poured it in a 9x13 in cake pan and it made a very full pan of bread, I was worried about it overflowing but it didn't.  Besides adding walnuts I followed the recipe exactly.

This tasted just like every other banana bread I've ever had. It's good - just nothing spectacular. If you've never made banana bread before, and are looking for an easy, sure-thing recipe, this would be a good one to use.

I made 12 muffins and a loaf instead of 2 loaves. They tasted really good. My loaf rose beautifully but the muffins didn't rise really. They were pretty much flat, I'm not sure why. But they tasted great and didn't look bad really. They received many compliments from everyone who ate them, they were for a business meeting breakfast.

Very easy to make! I really enjoyed this bread. Yum!!! Originally I only made 1/2 or this recipe or 1 loaf. (Note:I went ahead and used 3 bananas instead of 2 1/2 bananas for one loaf.) When the picky eater in my family asked for more with his mouth still full...let us just say the smell of this wonderful bread baking in my home is quite regular now. Thanks for the great recipe!!

The best banana bread recipe!  Moist and downright perfect. My whole family loves it.  I add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Both really add to the flavor.

Thank you thank you thank you for a wonderful banana bread recipe.  I have tried several others from this site and this is by far the best.  This is a dense, moist, flavorful bread.  The best part of this recipe.....the ingredients are all things that most people already have in their pantries....just add over-ripe bananas!

Love this recipe. It is so good and makes two nice
loafs. I like the idea of adding the eggs and vanilla to the mashed banans too. I did add Cinnamon to it also. My husband raved about it. I
will be taking the extra loaf to a Pot Luck tomorrow. Thank you Great Recipe

Great recipe!  I only used 2 cups of light brown sugar and it was very sweet.  Could even reduce some more, I think.  Also added 1cup of walnuts, which really added a nice flavour.  Very moist - I made one loaf and some muffins.  Taste even better after a few days in air-tight container or plastic wrap.  I had to bake a little longer than suggested.

This recipe makes 2 delicious loaves of bread.  The whole house smelled wonderful as these baked.  Better yet, they are so light, and moist. I'm throwing out all my other banana bread recipes
and using this one every time!

Easy, delicious, and a hit at my church workers' meeting.  Even the self-appointed cook who runs the  kitchen had to take a second piece.  She marveled when I told her I made it.  I'll forever use this recipe!

This turned out awesome!  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and added a handful of choc. chips plus a 8oz jar of marashino cherries - juice and all! It turned out great.  Let it sit for a day, the banana flavor comes out.  Still have some a few leftover bananas on the kitchen counter, will make again today!  Great receipe!

I thought this bread was very good.  It was easier than my old recipe, my husband said it didn't taste any different than my old recipe so I will use this one from now on.  I had to bake it about 7 min longer than the recipe called for and I addded cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe. 11/2 tsp. cinammon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

Excellent bread with great banana taste. I made one loaf and put the other in the freezer for when we needed a quick dessert. Definitely one of the best banana breads I've tried.

My 5 year old son helped me make this recipie he loved making this.  We added about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the recipie already doubled, and it helped make it a bit sweeter.  There are 4 kids here and they all want more.

I always am trying new banana bread recipes in hopes of finding "THE" one.  After all the rave reviews for this one, I couldn't wait to try it. Well I  to say it, but I am very disappointed in this recipe.  I am not a professional baker, but am also far from a novice, and this bread turned out terrible.  Soggy and undone in the middle, terrible color, and too done on the outside.  I will go back to what I have concluded to be the best recipe, and that is one I found in a Cooking Light "Best Of" cookbook.

Wow... this is probably the BEST banana bread that I've ever made.  I took the loaf with me to work and, needless to say, it didn't last long.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

Better than my mama's recipe!  Delicious - I just had my first slice - it won't last long!  Nice texture, very soft and moist. I used about 6 bananas, I can tell from the other reviews and my experience that adding more bananas doesn't hurt the turnout. Ended up baking it for about 1.5 hours too, 5-8 more minutes at a time while checking it with toothpicks but that's OK because my apartment smells SO good right now! Thanks!

This was the best banana bread recipe we have tried and we will be sticking with this one! We only made one change, we reduced the sugar to two cups instead of 21/2 cups. With very ripe bananas it is sweet enough.

Loved it!  I made mini muffins to send to my son's pre-school class, they were a big hit.  I added the bananas into the mixer with the butter and sugar instead of mashing them separately, saved a dirty bowl.  I even had to add the eggs at the end (because I had forgotten them) and they turned out great. Any recipe that fool-proof is a keeper!

I have used alot of different recipes
for banana bread but this is wonderful.
I substituted a stick of real butter
for 1/2 of the shortening and it
is just wonderful!

My husband was thrilled with this bread.  This is definitely a keeper and what a great use for overripe bananas!  In order to keep the bread from sticking, I cooled the bread in the pans on a rack for ten minutes before removing them to cool on the rack.  I am not an expert cook so I am thrilled to find a recipe that even I cannot mess up!

I will definitely make this again!  It's not often I have 5 overripe bananas but I did today so I looked for a recipe that would use all of them.  I made the following changes:  I used 2 c white flour and 1 1/2 c whole wheat bread flour, 1 c light brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar and it was plenty sweet.  1 stick unsalted butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg, and 1c chopped walnuts. Next time I think I'll put in more nuts and/or try pecans! I baked it for about 45 mins at 325 degrees.

Just tried this because I'm in Japan without my favourite recipe and, being an idiot at times, I failed to pack it in my suitcase. But this recipe is AWESOME. I was able to modify it for a convection oven and smaller disposable baking trays. I used a 1/3 cup of butter and deducted that from the shortening. Love this!

I have been using this recipe for years. Turns out consistently good every time. The flavor from this recipe is nothing short of delicious. I feel there is no need to tweak this recipe, great the way it is. Don't wait to long before removing the loaves from the pan after baking. I found using pam for baking in the pans seemed to give the best results for getting the loaves out of the pan after they done.

Hands down, the best banana bread recipe I've ever seen!! I've done the recipe exactly as written and I've also changed a few things.  Either way, it's amazing!! It makes 2 loaves and comes out perfect everytime!  
I highly recommend it! 
Another variation is to use 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening.  I always use the butter flavor crisco sticks.  I always use mexican vanilla (you cannot get a better vanilla taste)! I've also substituted 1c. brown sugar instead of using all white sugar.  It turns out about the same either way.  One trick is to grease the pan, then coat in brown sugar before you pour in your batter.  this way, it has a nice crust and everyone seems to really love that!

I did not think this bread was the best that I have made. However, I prefer a much denser bread and this was more cake like. I cut the sugar down to 2 C and did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and it was still too sweet for our tastes. I took many suggestions on this site and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 veg oil. Added some cinnamon/sugar to bottom of pan and they just popped right out. They did rise very nicely and baked nice although a bit too brown for our liking as well. I don't like the bread to be really dark on sides and bottom and this was because it took that long to get done. I can't say that I would make this again only because I have other recipes that are more dense that I much prefer. It is very moist and cake like if that is what you prefer.

I cut this recipe in half and made 15 muffins. I also took the advice in previous reviews and used brown sugar instead of white. I also used a few more bananas, used margarine instead of butter, added some whole wheat flour and did the brown sugar/cinnamon mix for the bottom and top of muffins. This was the best recipe ever! My kids (and their friends) ate them all up! Thanks for a great recipe Teri Lyn!

I have made this recipe a few times using the advice of other reviewers and they are right about the cinnamon and sugar on the top and bottom.  Also using half brown sugar and half white makes a great difference.

What do I do on a snowy day in PA with 5 overripe bananas on my counter?   Try this recipe!    After taking several suggestions from other ratings, I made the following changes:  I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar (this was plenty sweet); I added 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp cinnamon; I added 3/4 cup chopped, toasted pecans to one of the loaves.  I used butter for the shortening, and needed to bake the loaves about 10 min. more than stated in the recipe.  It was delicious!  Great texture and taste.

I was looking for a banana bread like mom used to make and this was as close as I could find.  Many recipes only ask for 2 over-ripe bananas and the bread comes out a little dry or too many and it's almost cake.  This was a good compromise.

This is one of the better banana breads that I have made and I have tried lots of different recipes.  I reduced the fat by using becel margarine instead of the shortening.  It was still very tasty.

This is so good!!!!!

I made muffins instead of bread ....I think it is easier that way....makes it fast to cook. I added some chocolate chips in mine also! Yum!
I am totally using this recipe from now on! It is so moist and the perfect texture as well as sweet the way I like it. :)

I had tried another recipe last weekend, and finding to be a miserable failure, I figured maybe I wasn't cut out to bake.  Then I tried this recipe and woohoo! it came out great.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and made 3 small loaves.  It was a hit.

This recipe is not as bad as I initially thought.  I added chocolate chips and walnuts to give the bread a little more flavor, but I had many of the same problems as other reviewers.  I needed to increase the baking time by 40 minutes in order for the center to get done.  On my second try, I decided to cover the pan with aluminum foil halfway into the baking time, because I had some problems with the top of the loaves getting too crisp. The final results are rather dense, and the loaves collapse a bit in the center while cooling.

Wow! This banana bread was so yummy! It was so moist and flavorful! I added a tsp. or so of cinnamon, some chocolate chips and chunks of banana to give it some more texture. My roomates loved it! Thanks!

This was my first attempt at banana bread that didn't come from a box.  My family loved it, and couldn't believe that I made it from scratch. I added some chopped walnuts, and did the brown sugar cinnamon on the bottom.  I will make this again soon.

This was absolutely wonderful and very moist!  I left it in 10 minutes longer than recommended and it still was soggy in the middle, but I didn't mind!  I just cut around it.  Next time I will adjust the cooking time.

Really great banana bread! I don't add any spices or extras, I love the pure banana taste in a banana bread. It's a very dense, sticky...almost dessert-like and wonderful bread. I haven't had a need to make another recipe! What's really great is it's a 2 loaf recipe! Mmm!

This has to be the most moist  banana bread, I loved it. I did use 5 egg whites instead of the 4 eggs, and used 1/2 c applesause, 1/2 c crisco butter flavor shortening, 1 1/2c sugar and 1c brown sugar, and sprinkled a little cinnamon in it YUM!!! the other thing I did was use my bread maker, on the sweet cycle, it did work good how ever I had to put it on bake cycle for another hour to get it done, so I may try again on just the bake cycle or just use the oven, at any rate this is a 5 star recipe,

Excellent banana bread! I followed the  recipe exactly and the texture of this bread is wonderful. The taste is very banana and not too sweet. I've made it with whole wheat flour and with freshly ground wheat and spelt flours; it always turns out great.

While this was easy to make and not bad tasting, it wasn't the be-all and end-all of banana bread recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the bread a bit too sweet and bland, lacking any depth of flavor.  I probably will not make it again. My family agreed.

I loved this recipe, the bread was very moist and delicious. I did change a few things, I used 1 1/4c. white sugar and 1 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also used 2 more bananas for extra flavoring. I added the brown sugar sprinkled on the bottom of the pan, like another recommended, that was delicious. I also put a bit of butter mixed with brown sugar on top when the bread was just about done, it melted from the heat and formed a glaze. It was so good that my brother who is a chef himself, took over a half of loaf home, saying that everyone else had enough already!

All I ca say is FANTASTIC! I do not even like bananas and I loved this bread.  The recipe did make 2 loves so I added walnuts to one, and chocolate chips to the other one. I also took others advice and dusted the pan with cinnamo and sugar. The 300 degrees and the time listed worked perfect!

I tried the recipe this morning adnd I just have one word...Fabulous!!!!  It tastes just like the banana bread my grandmother's neighbor used to give her for Christmas.  My cousin Heather and I would fight over each bite.  Followed recipe and it came out perfect.  I don't see how you could mess this one up.  Do not raise oven temperature to 350 as suggested by some.  I baked the loaves at 300 and the result could not have been more perfect.

DELICIOUS.  I did add 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup white. My 4 year old granddaughter helped me make it. Easy and everyone loved it.

Absolutely delicious.  Following recommendations from other reviewers I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also coated the pans with cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled a little on top.  It was wonderful!  Moist, very banana-ey, and even better the following days!  Out of curiosity, has anyone tried using butter-flavored shortening?

This was an AMAZING recipe! We only had one loaf pan, so I made muffins like many others did - baked for about 35 minutes. We originally made them to share with our neighbors who have been sharing the veggies from their garden with us... instead we will be sending a thank you card because these are just too good to give away! Thanks for sharing!

This banana bread was delicious, I will definitely make again!  I had enough batter to make a loaf pan and a bundt pan.  I omitted the nuts and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  It would also be good with a cream cheese icing. Definitely a keeper!

I've been making this recipe since 1999, it's the best I've ever tried.  I add cinnamon to mine, gives it that extra something.  Definitely a recipe to add to the family archives.  Very moist and dense.

I only had 3 bananas so I cut everything in half, and used butter instead of shortening, the bread was a little too sweet for my taste but other than that I liked it, I baked it for 1h 15 min exactly at 300 F and it was done, not sure why some people had problem with baking time

When making it I thought it would be very 'cakey' because of all the eggs.  It smelled great while cooking- but I did have to cook it about 10 more min, on one loaf- the other was exact.  Next time I will add choc. chips.  My husband likes this better than his mothers :)

I made this recipe exactly as indicated.  Unfortunately being 9 months pregnant I put it in the oven and completely forgot.  Two hours later I remembered.  The bread was terrible but not for overcooking - it was still raw in the middle.  Not sure what went wrong but I can tell you I won't try this one again.  I'm a pretty adept cook and I've never seen something come out this soupy after being grossly over cooked!

This banana bread was so good!  The only changes I made, were to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and about 5 oz chocolate chips!  It is a moist delicious oooy gooey treat with a nice tall glass of milk.  I will definately make again.  It freezes and thaws well, great for holiday baking!

i halved the recipe, added cinnamon, used 3 bananas, and no nuts...almost perfect. dense, moist and flavorful all the way through to the ends!! I was worried because i had it cooking for almost 2 hours. i checked it every 15 minutes or so and toothpick was still wet. i had to cover the top with foil. also it didn't rise that well but it sure tasted GREAT it wasn't ugly just not beautiful but I personally don't make banana bread for looks. I willd definately make this again and again.

this was pretty good, a little dry. But great anyway. I baked 1 in a regular pan and the other in an airbake pan. They both turned out good, the airbake takes longer(10 or so min). I used a crumb topping and it gave it a nice crispy top.

WOW, this was fantastic, even my picky 9 year old LOVED it. I did like a lot of others suggested, I did half brown sugar and half white. It turned out so perfect, baked in stone and one metal bread pan both came out perfect at the time set in the recipe! THANK YOU THANK YOU for this one!

I finally found a banana bread recipe I will make again! Excellent recipe.  Only change I made was I made muffins instead of a loaf and I cut in half because it seemed like too much but wish I would have made fully because they are almost gone. Thanks for sharing!

VEGAN VERSION

I used flax seed n'eggs instead of the eggs (Grind flax seeds in a coffee grinder...1/4 cup seeds pre-grinding per 3/4 cup cold water...1/3 of that mixture makes 1 n'egg...so make sure you use enough for the eggs called for).

I used non-hydrogenated vegan margerine.  Earth Balance.  YUM!

I used one extra banana for extra moistness.  

SO good.  SO dense.  SO moist.  Quite easy.

OH, and I used mostly brown sugar as well.

WOW-- I added cinnamon chips (no nuts) and substituted brown sugar for white (and added cinnamon and allspice) but this basic recipie is fantastic--I've gotten all sorts of rave reviews--the texture is divine! (you can also do this with canned pumpkin if you add enough spices--works well)

Thank you!

This banana bread is awesome. I've made it at least 3 times and it's definitely in my "greatest hits" culinary catalog. I use brown sugar in place of white, though it's great both ways. I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon & 1 cup of chopped pecans and it's heavenly. Baking time for me always seems to be a bit slow, and as a perfectionist I always like to keep a close watch on this bread and time-test it every so often to avoid under/overbaking. I also vary my pan sizes but usually get 1 big and one small pan loaf or 3 small pan loaves. Great to eat for breakfast or a pre-workout energy snack.

Our bread turned out good. We followed another persons reccommendation and added nonsweetened applesauce instead of shortening. We had to bake the bread longer than suggested. I wish we would have added some brown sugar, at least to the top to make it sweeter. Of course, it tastes better made with butter, but considering the calories we saved it was worth it.

This recipe was absolutely incredible.  Decided to reduce the fat and calorie content by reducing the amount of shortening to 1/2 cup and replacing the other half cup with 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce as well as substituting 4 egg whites for 2 of the 4 eggs.  Added a bit of cinnamon as suggested by others...INCREDIBLE and I saved over 850 calories and 100 grams of fat in the entire recipe.  This is definitely my new favorite banana bread recipe!

Awesome!  This is a great recipe to use up all those bananas in your freezer!  I loved how moist the bread turned out!  I added a topping of cinnamon and sugar to give the bread an added zip.

First I just wanna say this bread is different than some of the banana breads i've had i guess cause this one didn't consist of cinnamon and all the spices i guess but it was very good. I added a little allspice and some nutmeg couldn't find cinnamon. this is more like bread then cake which is what it should be cause bread is in it's name they made huge huge loaves. WE had ours with vanilla icecream it was kinda like a dessert snack. I also added baking powder by accident but came out ok i didn't relize till it was in the oven but it didn't affect it any this was a traditional very easy recipie thanks for sharing.

Great Banana Bread.  I substituted 1/2 of the fat for applesauce, and it turned out well.  I made one large loaf for freezing, and one smaller loaf.

This is a great bread. I made a few changes(substituted applesauce for shortening, cut sugar by 1 cup, cut 1 egg for 2 tbsp. of sour cream and added chocolate chips). Will keep this recipe and use it instead of my old one. Thanks

This recipe is the  best banana bread I have ever made.  When I was a kid we use to eat a lot of peanutbutter & banana sandwhiches, its a good combo.  So what I did was add a bag of peanutbutter chips to the batter.  Oooh la la both breads whent in the same day!!!!

This truly is a great recipe.  I put applesauce in place of 3/4 of the shortening, added an extra banana and it was really moist and good.  I actually even through a couple of chocolate chips on the top of one of the loaves (just out of curiosity) and it really WAS good.  I thought the chocolate chip idea was weird, but for some reason, they seem to go together.  Try it!

This is very good. I had always tried a new recipie for banana nut bread because I had never found one that I really like. I have found it now and the search is over...I will most likely never try another. People are now asking me for this recipe! It's yummy!!

My husband brought home a case of over ripe bananas from the fruit market that he paid $2 for so I made this bread for my daughters baptism. Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. I'll be making more to use up all of those bananas!!

I have been looking and looking for a good banana bread recipe. So many are too dry, or too sweet, or too something else. This one is perfect. My husband says it's the best he's ever eaten ... and he is picky!

We love banana bread at our house.  I usually make two loaves and send one to my in-laws.  My husband ate this one so quickly that he ended up cutting the second one before I had a chance to send it along.  Needless to say I had to make a second batch.  Great in lunch box.  Super moist receipe.

I loved this. I added a small (8 oz) bag of milk chocolate chips into the batter, it was divine. Everyone that tased it loved it. :)

This recipe deserves a good grade.  Boyfriend didn't go crazy over it though ... took weeks to finish eating it -- but it stayed moist!  

The search continues.  Will try Banana Banana Bread recipe from this board next.

I have used this recipe for years.  The shortening keeps this bread so lush and moist.  I agree with the brown sugar.  The first time I made this in early 2000 or 2001, I automatically did a combo of the sugars, dark brown and white.  I have found that brown sugar and dark brown add a little more body to baked food and sauces.  Refined white sugar tends to be flat.  I find I need more refined white sugar too.

Sorry for posting so many pictures I could not figure out how to write a review while posting the photo. Apparently I can’t it and now I cannot delete the other version so I apologize greatly! One of the smaller loves we made that we put chocolate chips in them and it was amazing two of the other smaller loads we did cinnamon sugar on top. The big regular loaf pan is just regular banana bread. I can’t believe how moist and delicious it is and now I just wanna eat the whole thing myself.

I like this recipe, a lot. Instead of using shortening I used butter, and I used one cup of brown sugar and one and one half a cup of white sugar. when I made it I doubled the recipe, which made four loaves. instead of using ten bananas I used nine and it worked just as well.

Outside was tough and inside was dry. I suggest a tsp of baking powder, 350 degrees and check it for doneness after 40-45 minutes.

It’s ok. Not bad, but not as moist as I’m used to (Someone mistakenly packed all my cookbooks for the move) and not as much banana flavor, but better than other recipes I’ve tried before.

I didn't have loaf pans so i made one tray of muffins and then used a casserole dish to bake the rest of the batter.  I also added cinnamon chips and chocolate chips, and frosted the cake with vanilla icing.  Delicious!

Great recipe! The only thing I did differently was replace Shortening with equal part butter, added a tsp of cinnamon, a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and reduced sugar to 2 cups. I also used 3 extra ripe bananas and 2 regular bananas. The banana bread is savory and not super sweet, which is exactly the way I like it!

Turned out great.  Used 1c brown sugar and 11/2 c sugar instead of all sugar. Also put some choc chips and pecans I had in pantry.  Made a fleur de lis for Saints since it’s game day.  Makes two loaves.

I love this recipe! Excellent bread! I started making it because my boys have friends with dairy allergies.  Now it’s the only recipe I want to use.  I do add 1tsp of cinnamon, substitute 1 cup of white sugar with brown, and have also used applesauce instead of oil.  Always turns out great!

Wow!! Loved this! Used 5 super ripe bananas. Used a cup less sugar (1 1/2 cup total). Appreciate that it makes two loaves. Will make again!

Great B-bread !  Only had four b-nans but still came out moist. Used 1 C. Brown, 1 C. White sugar and added chopped walnuts.
Check at one hour, mine was done.  If browning too fast,  lay foil
Over top.

Did not go well. No idea why, recipe followed exactly. Bubbles over and destroyed oven; what was left was either soggy & inedible or solid & inedible. Gutted :(

I get so many compliments in this.  I've made it in little muffins, big muffins and bread.  All excellent, I put a generous amount of cinnamon in, I put some old peaches in, excellent.  half the flour with whole wheat, excellent.  I do use vegetable oil and it makes it so much better.    Very forgiving recipe.

This was easy and delicious!!! I used two sticks of real butter for the shortening, and I only had 4 bananas. I cut the sugar back to a little over a cup. I used a mixer for creaming the butter and sugar, but did the rest of the mixing by hand. Even without nuts, it is wonderful!

Easy to make and taste very good! I substituted shortening with butter and adjusted serving to 12 for one loaf, it’s good! I will definitely make it again.

My son and I made this recipe Wednesday and it is amazing!  I doubled the recipe to make 4 loaves instead of 2 and it came out perfect! No nuts added though as we don't care for them. I used mostly organic ingredients too. I will definitely make this again!  So yum!!!

Teri, your recipe is wonderful. The only thing I did different was I deleted the sugar, I added 7 small packets of Equal sweetener, (I can't have sugar). I gave my son and husband a slice, and they didn’t know I with held the sugar from the recipe, they loved it. Then I gave them a slice with cream cheese frosting on it for their dessert, they loved it too. Thank for sharing. Cheers, Sharon

Most amazing recipe!!!! I substituted Brown Sugar for a cup and a half of the sugar. Added 1/2 teas. Nutmeg & 1/2 teas. Cinnamon. Half a cup of mini Chocolate Chips and half a cup of crushed walnuts. I knew it was a keeper recipe when I asked my Aunt to try a slice (mind you, she has never liked Banana Nut Bread!!) and she fell in love with it and wants it all the time. She went as far as to say that mine is better than my mother's  (her sister) and better than my grandmother's!!! To me that says alot since they are the best cooks and bakers I know!

Moist even days later, —without having to warm it up.  Having made it the first time just a week ago..., I made it a second time already.   My kids scarfed this up like little piggies, and they are the pickiest little piggies ever — so I am grateful to have found this recipe.

I followed advice of others and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown.  I also added 1 cup of peanut butter chips and 2 cups of chocolate chips.  Delicious!  Moist.  I made this into regular sized muffins (it made 24) plus a small loaf of bread.  I was short one banana and substituted 1/2 c applesauce.  Still turned out great!

I ended up cooking it on 350, and I probably shaved off 20 minutes at best. My only issue was that I didn't portion is out right between pans. Oh well, I'll try again next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and made this for a 4th of July party.  My husband and I loved it as did many others at the party.  My nan felt it had too much of a banana taste to it; she said she never uses more than 3 bananas when she makes it.  In the future I made add some dark choc chips just for a different flavoring.

Wow! Grandma loved this recipe! Don't worry if it comes out on a lighter side of what you are used to. I'm a ham for heavy breakfast bread and this was a winner. I also did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. My family is allergic to nuts so I went with a zest of lemon in the banana and egg mix. Bake for only 1 hour and let sit.  Woohoo! But, I can't keep it out over night or its gone!!! Thank you for a great one :)

I made this in a muffin tin instead of the bread pans. Made two batches that turned out really well. Baked them for aprrox. 30 mins I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, an extra tbsp of vanilla extract and put sliced strawberries on the top of each muffin... my friends and the neighborhood kids gobbled them up!

This simple recipe is perfect for substituting with egg-free ingredients.  I used the flax-meal egg substitute (1 tbsp flax meal/3 tbsp. water = 1 egg) and got the exact result I was looking for.  I also chose to use brown sugar in place of regular.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked that it made two loafs at a time. I also did one cup white sugar and one cup brown. I also added 1/2 tsp of Ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of Allspice,  2 Tbl spoons of apples sauce. I love how Ginger and Banana taste together.

It was easy and awesome! I used 1/2 butter flavored shortening and  1/2C butter and I used 1C sugar and 1 C brown sugar and used the electric mixer, it turned out great, I did not add nuts and it was moist and delicious.

The perfect substitutes for this recipe is...the thing I had to change(and will always change)with this recipe was simple I was out of white sugar so what I use to substitute was one cup brown sugar, quarter cup honey and 8 packets of stevia. Then sprinkled at most one teaspoon of white sugar on the top. AND it came out absolutely amazingly delicious and moist.

I made it using canola oil instead of butter.  It just called for shortening and I never know which one to use or if it matters.  I am making them to donate it to a bake sale to benefit my church.  Which is why I wanted to make 5 little ones.  Well, in this case, the breads took FOREVER to get one.  They were crusty on the edge and too moist in the middle.  I'm not going to donate them, I'll eat them ourselves.   I don't know if I'll make this one again.

I made this recipe without any modifications, and shared it with my family. My husband especially loved it.  Everything came together very quickly.The end result was tender, moist, and full of of banana flavor. Held together well and didn't crumble too much when I sliced it.  I'll be making this one again.

I'm rating this delicious recipe 5 stars even tho' I made many changes - I know, I know - but only because if it was so good w my changes that I can only imagine how good it would be as is. And for those who appreciate, as I do, the sharing of changes that might be of help to others, here were mine (changes only) for a 1/2 recipe that was lower sugar & carbs, higher protein:  3 very ripe bananas; A/P, buckwheat, & almond flours (30% each); Kerrigold unsalted butter; 3/4 cup Xylitol, 1/2 cup coconut sugar; & added 1/2 tsp BP, 2 tsp molasses, heaping 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1 Tbsp each ground flax & chia seeds. Other ingredients were as written for half the recipe. Made 15 muffins (3/4 full), baked at 325 deg for 35 min (next time will try 30 min). 
   Just absolutely moist & delicious on 1st & 3rd day, but best on the 2nd day. A little sweet for me personally, so next time I'll reduce the coconut sugar by 2-4 Tbsp but increase molasses. 
     Please don't hesitate to try this recipe. If my picky 32 yr old daughter loved it, I can't imagine anyone who won't. Even my 9 yr old banana-hating granddaughter loved it!  :-D

Excellent!   Used 2 sticks melted butter instead of shortening.  Also changed sugar--used 1 c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar--probably could've used 1/2 c white. Kept flour same.  Yield 3 dozen muffins. Baked at 325 for 15-20 mins. Really yummy. Muffin papers peeled off perfectly.

The family likes it. Its not the best recipe we have tried for banana bread but its simple enough to be satisfied. It wasn’t very moist so I like the idea of using a little applesauce and maybe a pinch of Nutmeg to give it a lil more taste!

I would have to give this 4.5 stars.  I made two loaves, one with nuts and one without.  I really enjoyed this bread, especially the crust.  I did think it was  tad dry.  My husband liked the bread but thought it had too much sugar in it.  He also said that it has more of a cake like texture than a bread like texture.

This recipe turned out so moist and delicious! I followed the advice of a few brilliant bakers and substituted half apple sauce for half the shortening. I also added 1 1/12 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of pecans. i also threw in 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips. For the finishing touch I sprinkled pecans over the top of the loaf before baking. I couldn't be more pleased with the way it turned out.

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups as suggested.  Also have made it with 6 bananas.  Either way it turns out fantastic.  Also put chopped pecans in a batch.  I think the vanilla really sets off the banana taste.

I have been using this recipe for years. I bake it for bake sales, Christmas gifts, and for coffee hours. EVERYBODY asks me for the recipe!! I use light brown sugar instead of white sugar and am generous with the vanilla. it is good because it yeilds 2 loaves. I put in my Church women's recipe book to share with everybody.

Delicious! I reduced it to a single loaf, used three medium over-ripe bananas and swapped 1/2c of white sugar for brown, based on others' advice. I'll definitely make again.

A much sweeter/richer bread than I am used to.Less density than most bananna breads. I made with brown sugar and added a healthy dose of cinammon

When my wife and I used this recipe, the bread came out fantastic!  It had the right sweetness and banana flavor.  We will continue to use this recipe and now add it into our own.

The flavor of this bread was excellent, but it was very dry.  I added 3/4 cup of pecans, so maybe that was the problem?

Wonderful recipe!  I used butter instead of shortening only bcs I didn't have any.  I also took the advice of others and replaced some white sugar with brown sugar.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I think I'll add some raisins and nuts next time also.  This is definitely a recipe I will use over and over again!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Although you must adjust the baking time according to your oven (it took longer for mine to bake up right), this is a wonderful banana bread! Family always gobbles it up! Great as gifts during the holidays!

I have been trying for a long time to find a recipe that parallels my mother's that my husband approves of...this is it! This bread is fabulous....very dense and heavy and very moist. I used three whole bananas per loaf. I was a bit worried becuase the bananas were too young, but the recipe picks up the slack. Great!

This recipe is delicious, but I had a few problems with it.  I made a loaf and 14 muffins.  I made the mistake of putting the loaf in the oven then filling up the muffin pans and putting them in a few minutes later.  As a result, the bread fell.  But the muffins fell, too, so I don't know what I did wrong with them!  I baked the muffins for 40 minutes, but they were not done.  I ended up baking them for 55 minutes and they are still very moist.   I also baked the loaf an extra 15 minutes. They taste great, so next time I will try baking at 350 and I will NOT open the oven door!  Maybe then they will come out perfect.

My husband and I are currently living overseas. Finding food that resembles something edible has been difficult and certain ingredients are difficult to find. This recipe was a hit before I even baked it. The amount of shortening is staggering when you only have butter at your disposal, but if you're willing to walk a little...it's definitely worth the extra calories. I plan to use this recipe on a regular basis while we are out of the country and I’ll certainly use it when we get back home.

This bread is delicious! Cooking temp and time were perfect!  I halved the recipe and made one loaf- used 3 banannas,added 1 Tsp of Cinammon, and topped it with cinammon sugar before putting it in the oven! So yummy!

PERFECT taste, the first loaf was LITERALLY GONE within 20 minutes,  although I've made this only once, I plan to make much more in the future
Thank you Terri Lynn Lynn!

SUPER!!!I did use a half a cup less sugar and found that to be enough sweetness for my taste. As an added extra I coated the form with cinnamon and bromn sugar, then I topped it with chopped walnuts coated in flour, brown sugar and cinnamon.When it cooled I drizzled a creamcheese glaze made of powder sugar, creamcheese and milk.This is the best B.B. recipe I have tried so far.

I couldn't find my other saved banana bread recipe so I used this one and made a streusel topping myself--it turned out very moist with a wonderful flavor.  I'll probably use this one from now on.  :)

I am not good at baking anything and have been wanting banana bread for sometine now. I saw this recipe, read some reviews and tried it. AWESOME! I did add 1 tsp cinnamon to batter and coated the pan like another member with cinnamon and sugar. I also added to the top of the bread. Substituted 1 cup of white sugar with brown. You can't go wrong with this!

Made this and it was awesome. I added 1 tsp baking powder and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. I'm going to try and use Splenda for my sugar free friends. My picky husband who never eats this sort of thing even liked it and couldn't keep him away from them. I made muffins too and the baking time was only 30 minutes. Five star receipe.

The bread had a good flavor but it baked funny.  The top middle part didn't get quite done and the bread didn't really rise very much.  I'm not sure what happened since this hasn't happened to me before.  I'll keep trying other banana bread recipes.  Thanks for sharing though.

I made muffins instead of a loaf because I didn't have the right size tins.  They came out so moist.  I baked them for 40 minutes.  My 1 1/2 year old son loves them.  The people that say this has no flavor, just simply can't cook. If you follow the recipe to a "T" it will be fabulous.

Whenever I make banana bread, I use old, brown bananas because they're sweeter. Also, coat the bottom of the pan with sesame seeds. It gives it a nice nutty flavor.

SO. GOOD. I accidentally used only four bananas - I happened to be holding one of them when I went to turn on the TV and forgot to bring it back to the kitchen with me. Didn't notice until the bread was already half cooked. Didn't make a difference though, still tasted good. I even had some for breakfast this morning. Try adding in some cinnamon, it adds to the flavor and makes your house smell even more delicious while it's baking.

I did not have enough white flour on hand, so I did a combo of white flour (1 1/4 c.)& whole wheat flour (2 1/4 c.).  Although the bread stayed flat on top (instead of mounding up like my previous recipes) the flavor & texture turned out great!  It is a bit sweet for my tastes, so next time I will reduce the sugar as suggested.  Baked three small loaf pans (cheap aluminum type) for 1 hour & 15 mins exactly.

My family loves banana bread and this is "the recipe". I have been making this recipe for over a year now and it always turns out great. The only changes I make is to substitute some brown sugar for white as some others have suggested. I have some in the oven right now and my house smells wonderful!!!!

This recipe will easily make 3 - 8" by 4" loaves(those foil loaf pans).  I made 3 loaves instead of 2 from the recipe and raised the oven temp to 325 degrees.  Baked perfectly in 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Came out very moist! Yummy recipe!

Great taste.  I substituted brown sugar for some of the white sugar.  The one loaf was a little under done in 1 hr 15 min, but again, it had a great taste!

This was a good bread for my first time making banana bread.  I found it a bit tough for our taste and only used 3 bananas, added some chocolate chips because my kids won't eat anything without chocolate, and put a brown sugar streusel on top. I also substituted half sweetened applesauce for half the shortening; maybe that's why I found it to be a bit tough.  I baked it for the recquired hour, too. Hmmmm, I will try this again to the letter because my family did enjoy it, and it smelled heavenly while baking!
ETA:  Ok, made it again today (3-17-06) This time added more banana and chunks of chocolate, but used only shortening and no applesauce.  Baked it for one hour and it tasted DELICIOUS (with its streusal topping), but this time it fell in the middle! Next time, I'll do it the same, but bake it for a longer time.

PERFECT! I was looking for a recipe that was similar to my grandmother's (my mom was taking too long to email it) and I found this one. It's nice and dense with a great banana flavor. I almost have to lock it up to keep my husband from eating both loaves in one sitting! Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good. It was easy and made two large loaves. I would not call it the best I've ever had. I did'nt have any complaints from my family. I made it exactly as written, except I used butter flavored crisco. It turned out a little dark on the inside.

This recipe is definitely a good recipe but not the best. I like more cinnamon type banana breads and while it is really good, it seems to be missing that "zing" for lack of a better word. I've tried 3 other banana bread recipes from this website and this one is definitely the best one.

This bread got better and better with each passing day.  I added chopped pecans and a handful of chocolate chips as well.  I got one loaf and 12 muffins out of it.  Before baking, I sprinkled the tops of both the loaf & the muffins with brown sugar and more chopped pecans - it gave it a nice sweet, crunchy top.  Next time I'll add more chocolate chips!

This was a success!!  Apart from being a little too sweet for me, it turned out to be perfect.  I've been asked by my friends to make some for our annual Christmas party.  One thing...I did add more bananas to the mix for more banana flavour.  Thank you so much!!!

VERY Moist!! Great Flavor! I always add at least 1 extra banana ,since it cooks at such a low temp, and it ends up cooked perfectly :)

Five stars for a banana recipe that taste great and doesnt take all day to make. I have made it many times now w and w/o walnuts for my kids. I usually use it for banana muffins for on the go mornings or mini muffins for a snack.

This bread was pretty good. I bet it would have tasted a lot better if I hadn't over cooked it.  Do not cook this bread for over an hour. I cooked mine for an hour and it was to long.  45-50 would be more than enough time.

This was a really tasty recipe! It isn't the best banana bread I've ever had, but the ingredients were handy and it is something I would make again. My husband liked it a lot.  I made mine in a tube pan (like for angel food cake) and cooked it for the same time/temp as called for and it turned out just right.  Thanks for helping me use up those bananas!!

This recipe was FABULOUS!!!! I did follow others recommendations and added 1/2 tsp of allspice and some extra cinnamon.  I forgot to add pecans or walnuts, but it was very moist and delicious.  Great with a nice hot cup of tea.  A keeper!! Will make again and again.

Very good.  My co-workers are loving it.  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have the shortening, so I substituted a combination of oil and butter.  I also added pecans.  It turned out very well.  Great texture and very yummy.

Pretty good...although I have a low-cal/low-fat recipe for banana bread that I like better....I guess I prefer a lighter taste...this was really good but richer than I am used too.

We LOVED this recipe!  It's sweet and dense and very moist!  I followed to the letter....EXCEPT I added 1/2 tsp more vanilla and heavy tbsp of cinnamon into the dry ingredients.  It added just the right amount of spice.  This is my end all banana recipe--good by to the other recipes!  THANK YOU!

Five stars does not adequately rate this one.  I've tried several other banana bread recipes from this board and they were OK.  THIS IS BANANA BREAD IN ITS BEST FORM!!  By the way - instead of two 9x5 loaf pans I used one bundt pan.  It took about 1hr, 45 mins, but was WELL worth the wait.  Thank you SOOO much for this one!

Wow! What a terrific recipe!  Had to freeze the second loaf quickly before it disappeared, too!  Even my picky 6-year old loves it!  Thanks!

Very good banana bread recipe- moist and very banana-y. I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times and it never lasts- gets eaten in a day or two. Last time I added chocolate chips as an experiment and it was delicious.

This turned out great in my staneware pan!  Also can be made sugar-free using fructose.

This banana bread recipe was absolutely wonderful, it was rich and moist.  It was very easy to make, it does take awhile to cook but well worth the wait.  I cant wait to get more overly ripened bananas to make more :-)

This was the first banana bread I've ever made, and it actually came out great!  It's moist yet light.  I added chopped walnuts which makes the texture more interesting.  One thing of note is that I had to cook it for nearly 2 hours; perhaps my oven was at fault.

This is the only banana bread recipe I have used since I found this one in 2000 (sorry, mom).  I have tried a few others but always come back to this one.  One change I make is to split the recipe into 3, not 2, glass loaf pans. Yes, the bread is sweet, so cut the sugar by 0.5-1 cup if desired.  I have a batch in the oven now - smells heavenly!

This recipe was great... everyone gobbled it up.   I added a 1/2 chopped pecans for a little added crunch, very very good!

Yummy!  I had an extra banana and threw it in, didn't seem to make a difference.  Actually seemed extra moist. Instead of making loaves, I put them in cupcake papers and baked for 30-35 minutes.  (I also added chocolate chips on top after I filled the papers.  They were a HIT!)

While this is not a fast recipe (cooking time = 1 hour and 15 minutes), it is by far the best banana bread recipe I've ever had....and therefore, well worth the time investment.

I was specifically looking for a very moist, rich banana bread.  I certainly found that in this recipe.  I plan on making this often.
