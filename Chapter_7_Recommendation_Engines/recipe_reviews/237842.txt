Just finished dinner and I was anxious to recommend this recipe. It was absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare. I doubled the amount of chicken thighs but I left the liquids as they're listed. I did cook them longer but that might be because of the increase in chicken.  My husband who's not crazy about chicken legs loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I used 2 chicken breasts, no flour, garlic powder instead of cloves and added onion powder and ginger powder. It was good but it needed a little something extra. Next time I am going to add a squeeze of honey and a dash of crush red pepper flakes.

The meat slides right off the bone and it's sooooo flavorful!! The gravy that the ingredients made can be used as a topping for future meals, so I sealed it in a container and put it in the freezer. As a pineapple lover, I recommend giving this recipe a try!

I made this for company and followed the ingredients exactly. It was so easy and just delicious. I was very happy with the results and my company loved it. I had extra sauce that I saved in a bowl in the fridge. Later in the week I fried pork chops with just S&P in a cast iron skillet and put the leftover sauce over them in the pan. Outstanding! I love this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the amount of chicken thighs and sauce. Made it for company and accompanied it with kale chips and roasted potatoes. Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great quick recipe!

Very yummy. I added ginger, chili flakes and honey as someone else suggested. I also cubed 3 large chicken breasts instead of using bone-in pieces.

We really liked it. However the flour left it a little mushy. Could do without I think. I used breasts but I think the thighs would be tastier. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this using 4 boneless skinless thighs. Used all the pineapple chunks in a 20 oz can (the pineapple juice in the can also supplies the juice you will need). Cooked it 5 hours on low in a large slow cooker. Chicken came out juicy with the right amount of flavor for me. May add some bell pepper to it next time for a little color and different taste. Served it up with white rice and Steamers Asian Medley veggie mix. Easy and good!

Excellent flavor for a quick easy meal

This was yummy! I didn't use flour (husband is watching carbs), otherwise made just as written. Next time, I will drain the pineapple better as there was too much liquid due to no flour. Made for our weekly Family Friday, and everyone loved it, from 17 to 82. Easy and a real crowd pleaser!

Great tasting and so easy to make! This is a perfect comfort dish served over rice. I used chicken quarters, bone in with skin. Spicy ketchup was substituted for regular and I added red pepper flakes. Lots of sweet and hot to satisfy my palate. I loved it, thank you so much!

I have made this several times & found that, in order to pump up the pineapple flavor, I needed to use pineapple chunks in heavy syrup.  I used all of the syrup, reduced the soy sauce to slightly more than 1/4 cup, added water chestnuts for some crunch & lots of fresh grated ginger.  Next time I am going to add a red pepper for color & some onion.  There's lots of sauce so if the thighs are small or the skin removed, use 6 thighs. I served it over rice.  One reviewer set aside just the excess sauce & used it for pork chops.  Sounds good to me!

This was so easy to make and it was so yummy! The chicken came out really tender and the pineapple really made it good. I made some rice for the side and it went perfectly. I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was delicious! The chicken was so moist and fell right off the bone. I didn’t make any changes to the recipe and the chicken had a nice flavor with the sauce poured on top. I made it with white rice, a salad, and corn bread. My family loved it.

Kind of bland. I added ginger and some crushed red pepper but it still need something more. I probably won't make it again.

I decided to give this a try because my hubby and I love pineapple and I'm always looking for crockpot recipes. I made it exactly as  written minus the flour part because I ran out of time before work. So I just threw everything in the crockpot and let it go, it was good. Everyone liked it, I made some chicken and garlic ricearoni to go with and it was good. I just feel like it was missing something, something to add a bit more flavor. It was slightly sweet and slightly salty. Maybe I'll add something next time to jazz it up, maybe like that salad dressing that was suggested.

It tastes fairly good, but I found there to be too much sauce for the amount of chicken... Not sure if I'd make it again

We used chicken breasts instead of thighs (because that's what we had in the house) and used bbq sauce in place of the ketchup but otherwise exactly as the recipe said. It came out fantastic. Will definitely be making again!

Didn't  make  any changes,  perhaps  I should have , however .
Was very sweet,  which, in fairness, was probably my fault,  as I used pineapple in syrup, instead of juice.
Chicken was, indeed, tender, but skin was too flimsy; I removed it prior to serving.
If I do make it again, I will add a green pepper, mushrooms.

Ok, following some other reviews I did alter this one a little. I skipped the flour, didn't see the need for it unless I was going to brown the pieces in a skillet before putting in the crock. I also used Heinz chili sauce instead of ketchup. I added some ginger paste and some red pepper flakes as well, to jazz it up. I also used boneless, skinless thighs. I tasted the sauce before it went in, and it was really good. But once the chicken juices get mixed in, it waters down the sauce and it becomes kind of bland. There must be a way around this, I just don't know how. Next time, I will flour and brown the pieces first and see if that helps. Great idea, it just gets lost...

I followed the directions to the letter and this chicken was fantastic. I thought I would never eat chicken thighs. Well, I changed my mind. Much better than breasts. I'm now a chicken thigh convert .  Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I served it with white rice and peas. Wonderful!!

Was really good. Even my fussy children enjoyed it. Next time I will take the skin off the thighs. Otherwise I certainly will make this again ??

Love this!  Used the sauce on Pork Chops also and it was so yummy.  Substituted Sweet Baby Rays for the ketchup and reduced the soy sauce with no flour.

Yummy! I used nine chicken thighs so I doubled the sauce and used two cans of pineapple, each in its juice. This made much too much sauce. I certainly will add less soya sauce next time whether I double it again or not. An extra garlic clove for our family's taste is fine.

I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple (all I had) it provided the cup of pineapple and the 3/4 c juice.  To the sauce, I added some onion powder and a few squirts of sweet chili sauce. 
I used 2 lrg boneless breasts. 

This was okay. I liked it, but I was alone in this. The chicken was  a bit dry, but I am one of those weirdos that likes it dry. I did cook it for way longer than the recipe called for because I was out and couldn't turn it off.  I'd say don't overcook it unless you are weird like me! :-)

Not amazing. I used fresh pineapple and juice though. I wouldn't make it again.
