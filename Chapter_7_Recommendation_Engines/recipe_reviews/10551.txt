Very easy to make and the dough was wonderful to work with.  Not too sweet.  I used 1 tbsp of vanilla instead of 2 tbsp.  Made about 3 dozen for me.  Great, easy recipe!  Thanks Lois!

These cookies turned out really good.  They are as cute as can be too.  Followed recipe exactly except baked for 20 minutes.  Will make again.

I have been looking for this recipe for years. I used to make it as a kid. It was in an old cookbook my mom had put out by Crisco I think, dated 1948. But we used maraschino cherry halves. I remember they used to kind of melt in your mouth and the cherry added such a nice chewy touch.

These were great; they just melt into your mouth when you bite into them. Not real sweet, but the cherry blends in the sweetness. Excellent flavor. Next time I will try a whole cherry (only because I love them). My aging father-in-law ate several of them, he loves it when I bake cookies, so I try to bake different cookies every weekend or two.

I thought these cookies had too much salt and not enough sugar.  The only change I made was using maraschino cherries instead of candied cherries.  Cookie texture was very nice, taste was flat.  Lois, sorry for the less than favorable review, but think Iâ€™ll be moving on.
