This was a really easy recipe to make! I only rated it with 4 stars because it needed a little extra flavor. Personally I like more sauce and I LOVE cheese so got rid of the flour, used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and added 3/4 cup of Kraft’s grated Parmesan and Romano cheese blend. Also I'm not a big fan of mushrooms so I substituted them for 8 oz of extra-firm tofu. I'm sure shrimp or chicken would make excellent additions to this pasta. Might sprinkle a little cayenne pepper for some extra flair next time around.

One of the best dinner  I've ever had! It was easy to make.  I used milk instead of cream, and it tasted great.I added chopped carrots to make it more colorful and tastier.

this recipe is really great. quick and easy!  but i made a few changes..  instead of using just the cream for the sauce, i pureed the squash, added it to the cream, spiced it with a small pinch of cinnamon (kinda like making creamy squash soup except the consistency of this one is a lot thicker..) i didn't bother puting flour anymore cos its texture is already a bit starchy..so there.. i used that as the sauce and added broccoli and tomatoes to the zucchini and mushrooms.. it turned out great as well! thanks for the recipe idea! :)

Ooo this was great.  I made my vegetables last night and ate them on a bed of rice and finished them up today with the sauce.  Trick is to add a little of your (salted) pasta water when mixing in your cream and flour.  Delicious.  I'm going to make it again for my friend tomorrow !

This was absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 an onion, 4 cloves garlic, yellow zucchini, 3 cups penne and doubled the mushrooms and sauce. I sprinkle the top with parm and a little cayenne pepper for color and kick, and it was perfect!

I used a whole onion, lots of minced garlic, fresh Basil & parsley and sprinkled the finished dish with parmasan cheese! I also used more pepper & sea salt. Delicious!

This definitely took longer to prep than listed with all the squash cutting up. It's missing something, and I think 1 teaspoon of lemon juice was just the ticket! A little bit of lemon enhances everything... a better alternative than making it spicy or making it non-vegetarian with cheese! ;) Overall good, especially after the lemon.

A bit bland and unexciting.  I didn't add the Thyme so maybe that would have helped some.

This had great flavor, however, the 'white sauce' that you make up to mix with the vegies thickened too much. Next time I'll use a little less flour(?) I will make it again though, tasted great!

It was not terrible, but not something I plan on making again. The sauce tasted a bit pasty(raw flour flavour).

This made for a tasty dinner and was even a hit with the resident picky eater (7-year-old). I didn't have zucchini or squash, but the broccoli/peppers/tomatoes that I used instead were quite tasty, and I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the heavy cream. I only give four stars because it tasted a bit dry; maybe using the yogurt. Didn't have thyme but basil and dill worked great. This is definitely a keeper, so delicious!

My son and daughter-in-law made this for our evening meal one night before Thanksgiving. I was only an observer because they wouldn't let me lend a hand. But this is not a very complicated dish and it delivers a lot of band for the buck. I will pass along one thing they do differently. They double the sauce. Even if you don't like too much sauce it won't be too much if you double it. This is a great dish. I have definitely added it to our recipe box here and at home. It takes very little prep time and cooking time but it is sure to please. Try it. You won't be disappointed. I will add a little fresh grated parm on mine when I make it. Parm is good for the soul.

This was great!  I shredded a zucchini, 1/2 an onion, and 3 small carrots to hide the veggies from my 3 year old.  I used two huge portobello mushrooms as well.  Used Wondra flour and used heavy cream and milk since I was making more than the recipe called for.  I eye balled the amounts but guess it was more like 1 cup of liquid perhaps a bit more.  Will make again.

This was good, easy to make. I used a lot more mushrooms and skim milk instead of the heavy cream. Next time Ill add a few more spices, it needed a little more kick. My boyfriend really liked it so it'll enter the rotation.

Very good.  I added a little milk to the sauce mix, because I was worried it would be too rich.  Also, instead of 1 TBSP of flour, I added about 1/2 TBSP of cornstarch.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, and I was very happy.  It fed my husband and I and our 4-year-old perfectly with no leftovers.

I thought that the sauce was a little thick so next time I think I'll omit the flour or reduce the amount. and I didnt have any mushrooms or thyme around so I added shrimp.Not vegetarian anymore! I followed another review to add some spice to it so I added 1/4 teaspoon creole seasoning. And it turned out Delicious!

My husband made this for us all for dinner and it was delicious.  He added eggplant and switched out the flower for Kraft’s grated Parmesan and Romano cheese blend as someone else suggested.  This will definitely be on our go to favorite dinners list!

The thyme was overpowering and I had to add water to the cream mixture to get it THIN it was so ridiculously thick. I decreased the butter to 2 tbsp and it was still too much, the veggies tasted like they were coated in it. I'm not even interested in trying again and tweaking.

This turned out really well except for one thing.  If you follow the recipe, it is much too salty.  Thankfully we had enough extra cream to save it!  Next time we'll just salt to taste rather than following the recipe.

A really lovely, delish, and simple dish!  Any veg that you fancy can be added or taken out, and its so tasty no matter what you do! The only sub I did was twice the garlic, cause that's the way we like it, a little extra cream, and of course cheeeeese :)  So good! Thank you for the recipe!

Ugh! Delicious and so so filling! I doubled most of the recipe (last minute) so I forgot to double the veggies. My bad! It was great though. Husband ate so much that he had a stomach ache! That flour/heavy whipping cream mixture was so tasty! I wanted to have more of it for a thicker sauce! Maybe I'll triple that portion of it... but YUM!

I gave the recipe 3 stars because all the ingredients blend well together but it is a little bland as written, and not enough sauce.  I tripled the sauce  and spices with the exception of the salt(I added that to my liking). I also added a little stock at the end to make the sauce a little thinner and add some extra flavor.  I also seasoned my veggies while they were cooking.  Overall, this is a great base for this recipe.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I have cooked this many times, it is sooooo good!! I did as others and omitted the flour, so I mix  3/4c parmesan cheese and 1c cream then add to the pan and cook for a few mins. Amazing!

Added carrots and broccoli to the recipe to add more variety. Also used milk instead of heavy whipping cream and added a spoonful of sour cream to make the consistency a bit thicker. Also took other reviewers' advice and reduced the amount of flour to about 1 tsp because our family doesn't like sauces too thick.

i absolustely loved the taste(: i've made it three different times and my mom and i can't get enough of it. (i'm the one who cooks most of the time because it's so fun). i don't think i made any adjustments except i added more cream because i felt it needed more sauce to it. but yeahh, it was great!

This was great!! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars rather than the 5 is because I didn't think there was enough vegetables. I would have added another zucchini. I also add shaved parmesan which added an extra delightfulness to the meal!

We made this dish for our weekly Wed. night dinner, everyone loved it!!!  We doubled the recipe and used 3/4 cup half and half instead of heavy cream and only 1 Tbs flour.  We also added shredded carrots, shrimp, oregano and basil!  Everyone at our dinner said it should be brought again!

Maybe it was operator error but when I added the cream sauce to the pan it quickly turned to paste and had to keep adding cream to thin it out and it thinned out the taste as well.

This meal was delicious however a little low on veggies for me, and i'm not even a vegetarian. I added a few sundried tomatoes and a half a green bell pepper and it was perfect!
Next time I think I will also add artichokes, my new family staple!

Yummy! Made it tonight and it was so fast and easy. I did not have zucchini or squash so I used green onion and tomatoes. Like many others, I did not have cream so I used milk. Will make this again! Thank You!

Great! I just made this after working a 12 hour shift and wow did it hit the spot.  I loved the flavors in the sauce and the cook time between the pasta and veggies was almost perfect.  I used half of a spanish onion instead of just 1/3 cup and it was good.  My only problem was that the sauce seemed very very thick (although I've always had trouble with the sauce) but I just added some more cream to thin it out and it was perfect. I also topped with a bit of parmesean cheese but I think it would have been just as good without.

WOW! Easy, delicious and better than I expected.  Sauted the mushrooms in a separate pan and used them to garnish the finished product. Family asked for it again the next night.

This was really good! It takes very little time and very few steps so its a great thing to make when you need something simple! It doesnt need any modifications to be good, but to my own personal taste, i think you could add more mushrooms, buttter, and cream. Great Recipe!

This was a very yummy and easy to make recipe! I nixed the mushrooms, so it just have the zucchini, but it was still awesome. It has a nice sweet zang to it. This will definitely be apart of our routine of dinners!

This is VERY good! I followed the directions exactly. Advice to someone trying this: while preparing the sauce I thought it seemed too salty and like it wasn't enough, but it's perfect! Well, I did add some parmesan slices on top of it :o) EXCELLENT!

It's pretty good.  You can definitely play around with this by adding tomatoes, basil, or perhaps red pepper flakes.

This is one of my new favorite easy dishes to whip up weekly.  It is so creamy and a great way to used up whatever veggies you have in the house.  I added the red pepper flakes like someone else suggested and thought it was a great edge.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe!

Fantastic!  I doubled the sauce and added 1/4 t reed pepper flakes.  I also used whole wheat flour and evaporated skim milk instead of cream.  I think I used more than 2 cups of penne...  maybe more like 3.  Next time I'll add more veggies.  The sauce flavor is so yummy-  Thanks!

This was really tasty.  I think next time I'll add some red pepper slices for color.

Great recipe!  I used everything except for the squash because my local grocer didn't have the right kind.  I added soft tofu and my own special seasonings in addition to the seasonings in the recipe.  The whole family loved it!
