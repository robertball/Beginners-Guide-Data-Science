I love Cuban Sandwiches, so, I was excited to try this recipe!  The pork was very flavorful and so tender!   I made exactly as prepared except I didn't use the red onion because I forgot them.  The only thing I missed was the chewy Cuban bread.  I like the ease of the bun, but, it became very flat in the panini press.

I made a dijon mayo and used bread and butter pickles instead.  It was absolutely delicious and easy!

Oh my, this was delicious! I made the meat the day before, which made assembly super easy the next day. The meat, itself was wonderful, but combined with all the other ingredients, it was just awesome! It makes more meat than needed, of course, so I just froze it to enjoy these wonderful sandwiches another rime. The whole family really loved these...a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved this recipe. The pork came out so flavorful and delicious (I just dumped all the crockpot ingredients on top of the roast, and then proceeded to cook). The ballpark buns held up very nicely to being grilled. I will absolutely make this one again. Homemade cubans are a favorite of mine.
