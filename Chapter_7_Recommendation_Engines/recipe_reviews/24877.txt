At least it was filling...
I made this for dinner tonight and was not impressed.  The taste was not what I was looking for, too bland for a "southwestern" dish.  Even after doubling the jalapeno and seasoning the green pepper.  The creamy dressing was bland, I added salsa to it and it still was not good.  Will not make again, but at least my tummy is full.

Easy, quick and yummy. I accidentally left my  unfinished pita with this salad in my mom's fridge after visiting her. She asked me a few days later what I had left because she had eaten it and loved it!

My 19 year old daughter made this for us the other night. She wouldn't tell me anything about what it was until it was on the table. We all agreed it was yummy and a recipe to keep. I think that marinating and grilling the chicken would add a lot of flavor. It was good cold and served as a wrap filling, I added a little cheese to mine. Definitely will have her make this one again!

Needs more salt and spices. This has the base for a truly delicious salad but I agree with the others it needs to be kicked up a couple of notches.  It was good on chips and would be good on tostada shells but it just missed the mark. Note:  2nd go-round added about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp Tabasco sauce, more salt and pepper and it was much better.

Needs more salt, but otherwise outstanding served with chips and salsa.

My husband and I really like this salad. I use about 12 ounces of chicken, light mayo, and light sour cream. I add either lime or lemon juice to the dressing to add a little brightness. I added halved grape tomatoes to it last night and found that to be a nice addition as well. I think leaving the seeds in the jalapeno would add the zing other reviewers are seeking.

This recipe was okay. I prefer to have it warm in a tortilla. While it wasn't a big hit with me, my family loved it!

I made some changes to the recipe and I think it made all the difference. I added chili powder to the chicken while cooking as well as garlic powder. When making the dressing, I added more chili powder and garlic and some lime juice --squeezed about a tablespoon. This made the dressing so much more flavorful and more Southwestern.

Very tasty!  Really like the flavor of the chicken and the 'dressing' was good too.  Yum!

The chicken did have good lemon flavor and was juicy cooked this way.  However, I thought the dressing lacked flavored.  In my SW salad, I like to add avocado and blackbeans as well.  Good concept.  Fun to serve in little tortilla bowls.
