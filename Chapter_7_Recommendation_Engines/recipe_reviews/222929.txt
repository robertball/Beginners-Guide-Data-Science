Not a bad salad. I think it could use a little more "oomph", maybe some fresh garlic and a touch quality balsamic vinegar to offset the oil.

I have been making this salad for over 30 years and my mother always made it when i was living at home. it is an all time favorite in our home. my son and daughter  also make this salad in their homes for their family and they also love it. i add a bit of chopped garlic and a sprinkle of balsamic vineger and it tastes fabulous. when i don't have fresh oregano i use dried oregano.

I make this all the time at home. The only difference with my recipe is a splash of red wine vinegar and some crumbled feta cheese on top - gives it more of a Greek flare.

Five stars with white balsamic (four without-I LOVE vinegar, and it adds just the right finishing touch).  I used more onion and cuke as well.  Tasty, easy, simple salad.  Highly recommend it.  If you don't have fresh herbs available, dried Italian seasoning works fine too.

Very nice salad.  Hadn't thought of adding gorgonzola to such a salad.  My husband really appreciated that!  Thanks for the idea. I agree with others who use some garlic (dried, roasted, or minced fresh garlic if making the salad ahead a little so it can mellow a bit in the dressing), one or more Italian styled pickled peppers, dried Italian herbs of one or more type when fresh are not available, and one vinegar or another (depending on the mood of the day and what's available), oh - and even a touch of sugar sometimes.  Left the seeds in our more typical type cucumber, and it was simply refreshing anyway.  Might add pasta or beans with this salad if the meal is lean in the carb or protein area as well.  (pssst - Really, we only use sugar more as a seasoning to take the edge off of the vinegar, but mostly because we don't use enough oil to do the job traditionally.)  I like to make this with extra vinegar and oil (more vinegar than oil) and use the whole salad to top a green salad.  Yum!  Very refreshing!

Nice simple salad. I've been making this and a similar Greek one all summer. I like it OK as is, but agree with others that it needs some vinegar. I added plain white vinegar, and that ups it to a 5. I've now tweaked mine to the perfect way we like it-- a whole English cucumber (or 2 regular cukes), 2 T zesty Italian dressing, 1 T olive oil, a few pinches of Italian seasoning and a good tablespoon or so of vinegar. I add a fresh banana pepper too when I have one.

This is a very nice salad and easy to prepare.  I used vegetables right from my garden including the oregano.  We did add some vinegar to our salads as we like that bite it adds.

I love fresh salad and so does my family. This is a good basic  salad, but I also felt it needed a little oomph.  So I added a couple of shakes of parmesan cheese and chopped some pepperoni into it,  and garlic power.  It came out really good and the family can grab a bowl whenever they want.

Had this growing up as a kid in an Italian household.  Prepared pretty much the same, but you really need to add some red wine vinegar as someone suggested. Also, let it sit in and release the juices a bit in the fridge before serving.

this is a light fresh delicious salad. That said here are my modifications. I used yellow/pink blush cherry tomatoes,  I added a tablespoon of chopped fresh red and green basil to the oregano, and 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar to the olive oil. I used kirby cukes, as they are more firm than regular and I used 1/3 of a white onion cut in 1inch slivers.

Very refreshing and crisp!   It was a hit at the BBQ.   I did add a little red wine vinegar to sharpen the taste a bit.   I think a squeeze of lemon juice would be nice as well.

I love basil, so I did change the oregano to basil. But will definitely use oregano if out of basil. Thanks for the easy side dish!

I added a bit of vinegar and the tomatoes were from my dads garden,it did the trick! It was delicious! Even my hubby (who isn't very fond of tomatoes) loved it and when I went to get the leftovers for lunch the next day....it was gone...he had taken it to work for his lunch lol that's saying something on its own!
