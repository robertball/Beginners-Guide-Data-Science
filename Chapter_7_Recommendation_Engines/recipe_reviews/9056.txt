I made this recipe for my in-laws and it was a hit! The chicken was real tender and the flavour was incredible. I probably cooked it for 45 minutes rather than 1 1/2 hours. I think that's way too long and the chicken would have been way too dry. I also didn't have any almonds but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I would definitely like to try it with almonds next time but it was just as good without! Yum! This recipe is a keeper!

The sauce was a little too thin. I added flour to make it creamier. The flavour was great.

dry and bland. might be OK with some changes. Add rosemary or thyme. Try Sherry instead of white wine? Pan sear the chicken and bake for 30 minutes?

Sorry but we really did not like this recipe. I followed it exactly and had to thicken the sauce with a butter/flour mixture. It never thicken the other way. Then when it baked for so long the sauce was VERY thin and didn't offer ANY flavor. I think that if the chicken was browned in a skillet and "quick" baked with the sauce it may be better.Good luck trying it

Recently made this for 72 people - recipe scaled perfectly great recipe - I used about twice the quantity of flour (maybe even three times) to thicken tho - then really nice thick creamy sauce (its a LOT of cream!!) Top tip - when cooking for that many people its an awful lot of mushrooms but it works very very well. You have to add them gradually tho or they won't fit! I cooked this then kept it warm for about half an hour - worked fine served with new potatoes and green beans

Had this for a dinner party last night and I thought it was good but a little bland and the sauce was very thin. We all still enjoyed it though but I would season it a little more and thicken up the sauce some. Will definetly fix it again though.

This recipe was really easy to prepare and would be easy to make ahead of time. The chicken came out soooo tender BUT it didn't have much flavor. We added a lot of salt and pepper which helped alittle. I also had some trouble getting the sauce to thicken.

Very good. Goes well with a Sauvignon Blanc. Good to keep some sauce on the side for dipping. Chicken tended to get a little dry towards the end.

My family and I loved this chicken dish. I used baby portabella mushrooms in the recipe and it turned out marvelous. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Made for a dinner party and it was a hit... had to share the recipe with others. We served ours with orzo with romano cheese and broccoli and a Gerwurtztraminer wine. Delicious.

This was beyond tasty and so easy too the hardest part was remembering to start dinner early enough since it cooks so long. I did change it up though I used yogurt instead of cream; cauliflower carrot and zucchini instead of mushrooms and chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts. I added basil 5 spice salt and freshly ground black pepper. I put the almonds in the food processor which made them evenly distributed into every bite. The house smelled so good on a dark wet dreary day. I served it with buttermilk biscuits.

I did tweak a little. Instead of chicken breasts I used the organic chicken drumsticks ( I personally love drumsticks and wings over breasts.). When making gravy or sauce I used ground almonds instead of chunks because that's what I had in the fridge which I grounded for adding in my yogurt purposes. When I was done making the sauce in the pan I placed the chicken and gravy all in crockpot with 2 cloves of garlic and let it cook for 2 hours. When it was done it was blend so I added salt and pepper placed the chicken on plate and pureed the sauce all together and poured it over my chicken and pasta. The blend of almonds mushrooms onion and garlic went well with my pasta and chicken! Served it with asparagus side. Delicious Thank you for the recipe

Something as missing. Needed a seasoning of some sort. Choosing spices is not my strong suit. I would like to try it again with some advice.

I personally did not care for this recipe. It came out very flat with no depth. I ended up adding soy sauce to the chicken and sause which did improve the flavor. I'm sure it produces a wonderful flavor for some but was just too bland for myself and family.
