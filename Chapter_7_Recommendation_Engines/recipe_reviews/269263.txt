I used just 3 cups of flour but added more (after the initial rise) while rolling out the discs. The dough was pretty stiff to roll out. The only other issue I had was that I need to take more time with the pinching the points of the Star together. It was still DELICIOUS but DIDNâ€™T  and look quite as amazing as the one pictured. BUT, I WILL be making it again!
