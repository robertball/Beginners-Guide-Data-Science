With a little creativity, this became one of the best soups I have ever made.  I started off mixing low sodium broth with regular sodium to cut the salt.  (I like the flavors to come from other ingredients.) The key is to add an ENTIRE cooked rotisserie chicken to the broth with the veggies.  Be sure to pour in the drippings from the pan.  Let this simmer for about 15 minutes, then remove chicken and add the meat back in.  This gives it the most amazing flavor!  I also added peas, carrots, fresh garlic, basil, bay leaves and fresh cracked pepper.  Superb!

Thank goodness for everyone sharing their reviews.  I made this last night for a good friend who is just home from surgery and she gobbled down 2 bowls as soon as I showed up.  Here's what I did:  12 cups chicken broth is 96 oz., which is 2 large cans of broth.  I bought one regular can and one low fat/low sodium and tossed about a teaspoon or so more salt in throughout the cooking process.  Also made it easy on myself and picked up a roasted chicken from the grocery store; it's cheap, easy, has great flavor and really makes the soup chock full of chicken.  I tossed in about 1/2 bag of frozen carrot slices along with the onions and celery and also just tossed the noodles directly into the soup to cook.  I added a little black pepper for some pep.  This is a delicious recipe.

Well if you attempt to make this soup, do so using your common sense.  If you don't like things salty, well then omit some of the salt, because it is obvious that the broth will pretty much contain any salt needed.  I used my own broth from scratch & added carrots (whats chicken soup without carrots?)  I used small pasta shells (out of egg noodles - sick of shopping), which I didn't add oil to.  Salt to taste after the starch, because that is when your going to need it.  Thanks & Happy Holidays!!

Just had a bowl at work for lunch -- delicious! I read all reviews and made the following changes: Used 6 cans reg chicken broth, 6 cans low sodium.  Brought it all to a boil and added 1 cup each chopped onion, celery and carrots.  Added noodles, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove chopped garlic, fresh black pepper and oregano.  Added an ENTIRE rotissierie chicken and covered.  Simmered fifteen minutes and then took chicken out, removed meat and put back in pot.  Simmered thirty more minutes.  I'm taking it to a sick friend today -- it does make a TON so next time will freeze some for this winter.  I'm usually not one to change recipes, but followed other's advice and it turned out great -- not too salty as so many posters have noted.  The key is using half low sodium chicken broth.

Good standard chicken noodle soup.  Save yourself a step...don't pre cook the egg noodles.  Throw them in about 15 mins. before you plan on serving.  Cooking the soup longer wont hurt it and you'll be minus one pot for clean up!

With a few tweaks, this was hands down the best chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten. My changes were: Saute the onions and celery with GARLIC in 2T butter until lightly golden, then add in the broth. Add 1T butter, black pepper, dried basil, and just a dash of cayenne pepper to the broth. When the broth is boiling, add in a whole cooked rotisserie chicken you pick up from the store. Cover and let simmer for 5-10 minutes. Remove the chicken and take the meat off the bone, shredding to the consistency you like. Meanwhile, add the egg noodles directly to the broth. There's no need to cook them separately. When the noodles are close to being done, add in the shredded chicken and chopped green onions. Let boil until heated through and the egg noodles are done.  This was seriously delicious. I didn't have poultry seasoning on hand, so I'm not sure what I was missing with that flavor. The rotisserie chicken gave it plenty of flavor, though. I also used low-sodium chicken broth and did not add ANY extra salt.

Sorry, but I just don't see what's so great about this particular recipe. Can't figure out what everyone's raving about. It's good, but not great. You don't need oil to cook pasta, the oil just floats to the top of the water. Just stirring the pasts every so often while it's cooking is sufficent. And you don't need salt to cook your pasta either. And the AMOUNT of salt called for in this recipe! WOW! Who needs all that salt? There's plenty of salt in the canned chicken broth. Even if your using homemade broth, you still don't need that amount of salt.

I have made this soup 5 times now and everyone can not get enough. I even give it out to friends. We're not big on salt so I think it's safe to say a teaspoon is plenty. I bake 6 chicken breasts (with skin and bone) first, and cube the meat as soon as they're cooled. I also add carrots. College Inn chicken stock is the stock to use! and Mullers extra wide noodles. They stay firm. I throw in a couple of the breast bones when simmering for more flavor and remove later. What a wonderful soup!

Now I remember why I have always stuck to my mom's chicken noodle soup recipe...this was a disaster! I read the reviews carefully and omitted the salt, added extra celery, 1 1/2cup cut carrots and reduced the broth to 10 1/2 cups.  However, although I was going to add potato flakes instead of cornstarch, I put the potato flakes away and used cornstarch.  I poured the "mix" in slowly but a chemical reaction occurred causing the soup to "foam" over...I lost apprx another cup and a half (which is now all over my stove). Still, I wish I would have used potato flakes because the cornstarch gave the soup almost a "fishy" flavor.  Oh, most of all, chicken broth itself is high in sodium so even though I omitted the salt ingrediant, there was plenty in the 9 cups of broth left....can we say sea water?  TOO SALTY and I wasted a lot of ingrediants!! Sorry, will not make again nor will I recommend!

The grandmother who threw this recipe together has got to be long dead from high blood pressure. The amount of salt in this recipe is absolutely ridiculous. Completely drop the 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt and add some carrots and a few dashes of pepper and the recipe gets 4 instead of 3 star.

When I get home after traveling, I have neither the time nor the desire to make a “fussy” dinner.   Nor did I want a quick stop at McDonald’s or Subway as we’re inclined to do from time to time.  Besides, Hubs is sick with a cold and chicken soup seemed the right thing to make for him.  I’ve made chicken or turkey soup with poultry seasoning before so I already knew I’d enjoy that addition in this recipe.  It was the cornstarch, frankly, that was the deciding factor in choosing this recipe.  I knew I’d adapt this a little – I don’t EVEN like onion in chicken soup so I left it out.  It gives the soup almost a sweetness that I find unpleasant. I made up for it with extra celery and some fresh mushrooms. I did add some sliced carrots, but only a little.  I don’t like the sweetness of carrot in my chicken soup either, so it was simply for a punch of color that I added it at all. The cornstarch was not enough to thicken it, but just enough to give it a certain velvetiness.  Nice.   I finished it off with some fresh, chopped parsley (and a little grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for me!)    This was a nourishing, tasty and comforting chicken soup in a fraction of the time as homemade – and darn near as good.

I haven't made this yet, but I plan to. It sounds good with a few changes to accomodate my families personal tastes. Everyone is complaining about the salt content. Quick trick...If it has to much for your taste throw in a peeled raw potato or 2 and boil about 10 minutes. The potato will soak up the salt and you can start over with seasoning it, instead of throwing an entire batch of soup away. Make sure to pull the potato out and discard. Hope this helps!

This recipe is awesome!  For those of you that thought it was too salty...let me explain why!  The chicken broth is HOMEMADE!  You season it yourself unlike the store bought stuff that is packed with sodium.  I made this with my own broth (Take a pot and fill it with water.  Add your chicken bones, skin and all.  Add veggies such as celery and carrots along with your chosen seasoning.  I use a homemade rotisserie seasoning.  Stew it all in the oven for 8-10 hours.  When done strain broth out and seperate chicken and you've got what you need for this great soup.  I use a HUGE stock pot and I usually get 9 quarts of broth out of it.  You can can up the extra broth in jars by processing for 20 minutes.)  Hope this clears up the mistaken "salty" problem for all of you!

I have been making this for years and never wrote a review...well, it's about time!  This is, by far, my favorite chicken noodle soup.  I always add almost a whole bag of baby carrots, after cutting them in half.  I also add the noodles during the boiling stage.  I use a total of 20 cups of chicken broth and a whole bag of egg noodles.  Also shake in some pepper.  I don't put in any additional salt. I get a rotisserie chicken from Costco and rip it apart and add that.  They have the best chickens!  That's it - fabulous soup!

I omitted the corn starch and added a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of celery soup. I've made this a few times now. The first time I thought it was bland, so I tried adding the cream soups for both flavor and as a thickening agent and it made it delicious!

Agree with others - skip the salt, add carrots and don't pree cook the noodles. Otherwise very good, quick, easy soup.  Will make again.

Delicious! I have been wanting to make chicken noodle soup and decided on this one based off the reviews. I did read all 300+ reviews b4 I made this soup just to get the average review of what to add and what to take out. I made the soup for my family of 4. I boiled boneless skinless chicken breast and used the broth from the meat as the broth for the soup so I only added one can of chicken broth to the soup and maybe a cup of water (I don't do true measuring, sorry) Based off the other reviews I waited until I added all my other seasonings, chicken, and noodles to the soup before adding the salt and add to taste. I didn't have celery so I used celery seed and that worked out fine. I did add a pinch of sage and marjoram based off several other reviews. I didnt use the cornstarch only b/c I am use to chicken noodle soup being thin and I didn't want to run the risk of having stew LOL. Overall, this is a good starter soup for those that have not made soup before and feel free to adjust the seasonings to taste. Don't be afraid to add the seasonings that you and your family like. Thanks for a GREAT soup.

Number 1 rule (in my house) when cooking pasta - ALWAYS boil noodles in the broth! Grabs the flavor. So, first, I pre-boiled fresh chicken (which makes extra broth to replace the added water)...removed the chicken & added the 12 cups of chicken broth. brought that to a boil & added the noodles. In the meantime, I sauteed the celery & onion in a very small amount of butter to tenderize & release the flavors. Debone the chicken & add all to the pot except salt...plus carrots & simmered till carrots were done. I added a little more poultry seasoning.

Excellent!  My husband wasn't very excited when he found out I was making chicken noodle soup. The first bite he took he exclaimed how amazing it was "I wasn't looking forward to this but this is SO GOOD! oh my god!" He isn't an "eater" but ate a huge first bowl, and went to get seconds.   Definitely a winner!  Only changes I made was to add carrots and peas!

I just had to sign up to rate this recipe! I have tried several recipes on this site and this one is by far the best!! My very picky 2 year old ate this saying "yummy, mmmmm" throughout dinner and even cleaned his plate. My 5 year old, who doesn't like chicken at all asked for seconds.  What I did..I sauteed onions, carrots and celery in 1 tbsp of butter in a frying pan, cooked my wide egg noodles, drained and rinsed in cold water...brought 10 cups of chicken broth and seasoning (omitted salt, but added fresh cracked pepper to the veggies) to a light simmer, added a whole rotisserie chicken for 15 minutes, took out, shredded and put back in broth. Added cornstarch and water, brought back a simmer then added in veggies. Cooked for another 15 minutes and added cooked noodles. I also topped with Grammie Bea's Herbed Dumplings (from this site) for 15 minutes. FANTASTIC recipe!!! This is definately a keeper in my household. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I tweaked it some to make it more of a cholesterol watcher's meal.  Here's what I did: 1) Saute onion, celery, 3 medium peeled/thinly sliced carrots with 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tbsp minced garlic until veggies are tender.(Pepper to taste) 2) Add 2 large cans reduced sodium/fat free chicken broth to large boiler and heat to boiling. 3)Add cooked veggies and 1 grocery store rotisserie chicken(with pan drippings) to the broth. Bring to boil and simmer 15 minutes. 4) Season broth mixture with garlic powder, sea salt, pepper, and onion powder to taste. (I used about 1 tsp each) 5)After 15 minutes, remove chicken from pot.  Remove breast and thigh meat, chop, and add back to broth mixture. (You can add all the chicken if you want.  It will still be great.) 6)Boil about 2 and 1/2 cups of yolk-free egg noodles, drain, and add to chicken soup. 7) Mix about 2/3 cup of corn starch with about 1/2 cup of cold water in separate bowl until dissolved, then add to soup slowly. 8) Simmer at least 5-10 more minutes and eat.  **Thank you to the previous poster that suggested the rotisserie chicken idea.  It saved so much time and probably cost less than buying raw chicken and cooking ($5.99 cooked fresh that morning!).  Be sure to follow the prevous poster's directions and add the pan drippings.  Also, you can save even more time buying pre-chopped veggies.  It made enough for me to actually freeze some too!  Loved it!

Grandma, this was fantastic and super easy for a home cooked, weeknight meal! Perfect for working moms and busy families.  I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I Googled a substitute and found this: for 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning, substitute 3/4 teaspoon sage plus a 1/4 teaspoon blend of any of these: thyme, marjoram, savory, black pepper, and rosemary.

Great Chicken Noodle Soup BASE recipe and for that I give it 4 stars, because it basically makes it full proof GOOD!  I've made this about 6 times for my entire family over this winter. I am actually enjoying a bowl right now! We never knew about using corn starch to thicken soup until this recipe. If you are using homemade chicken broth that you get from boiling your chicken then I do somewhat agree on the salt proportions!! But not for store bought chicken broth. I'd say omit most of the extra salt entirely. Also, no need to cook the egg noodles separately, I throw them in the same pot and they cook in 9 minutes.
I always add about 5-8 different types of veggies depending what I have on hand, the ones I've tried and have worked deliciously are
(potatoes,carrots,celery,zucchini,mushroom,eggplant,tomato,onion,red bell pepper, asparagus tips) I try to sneak in as many!! The ones that HAVE NOT WORKED WELL (cabbage, brussel's sprouts and broccoli). I guess I got too ambitious.

As for taste, herbs and such I added:
thyme, basil, bay leaves, parsley, granulated garlic powder, paprika, crushed red pepper flakes, and seasoned salt and black pepper.

Solid healthy meal every time!!

This recipe is great--although I'm glad I looked at the reviews before making it.  I tweaked a couple things and this turned out beautifully.  I used half low sodium/half regular organic chicken stock and a whole rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I also found organic fresh herbs in a "poultry seasoning" bundle (rosemary, thyme, sage). Simmered the whole chicken in with the broth, the fresh herbs, and some fresh ground pepper for about 20 minutes.  Removed the chicken and cut the meat into chucks.  Added the chicken back with diced carrots, celery, and onion (I sauteed the celery and onion in butter first--yum!) and cornstarch thickener.  I added the noodles last and let them cook in the broth, no need to cook them first.  I thought the cornstarch thickener was a nice addition--it gave the broth a little more body and smoothness.  My husband LOVED this recipe--and I will be using it for turkey soup at Thanksgiving this year!

This is an excellent base recipe! However, I've modified it to make it less salty, more hearty and more authentic. Here's what I do: 1) Change 2.5 cups of egg noodles to 4 cups 2) cut 1.5 tbs salt 3) for 12 cups chicken broth, I basically boil/simmer a chicken for 25 mins, remove the meat, and throw back the bones for another 30 mins and add a few tsps of chicken broth powder to get it to the right taste 4) double up on celery and onions using 2 cups instead 5) add a few cloves of garlic 6) add 2 cups of peas 7) add 2 cups of carrots.  Skip direction 1. You can just throw in the noodles when you're done cooking and by the next morning, they'll be tender.  And viola, this is a delicious and hearty Chicken Noodle Soup!

I made this recipe in a hurry (sick child) and didn't take the time to read what other posters had said. Hence, a overwhelmingly salty soup! Yuck! It was salvagable because I added lots of water to it. (I would have had to add water to it anyway because it was too thick and pasty for my liking). Next time, I will omit the salt (broth adds plenty) and also add carrots. With these alterations it is worthy of a 5 star score.

This is an excellent recipe!!  My first attempt at making a homemade soup, and everyone just raved about it!  I did make a few changes though.  I used less salt, added some carrots, and I also used more noodles.  I made this soup for a friend that was sick, and it turned out fantastic.

I gave this recipe 4 stars b/c I tweaked it a little based on other people's suggestions. I wanted to use a rotisserie chicken since everyone raved about it but since I already had chicken breast I used what I had. To jazz it up I used Mrs. Dash Grilling Blends for chicken. I mixed it with a little olive oil and brushed over chicken on 1 side then put in the oven after it cooked halfway i flipped it over and seasoned it some more. While that was cooking I diced carrots, onion, and celery and sauteed with some coarse sea salt and black pepper and garlic poweder (season to taste). I used low sodium chicken broth and put in 2 bay leaves and a piece of the chicken i cooked (along with pan drippings) in the broth and brought to boil. Once it came to boil i took chicken and bay leaves out and added noodles and a little seasoned salt. once noodles were halfway done cooking i added veggies and the remainder of diced chicken. to thicken it up a little i omitted cornstarch and used cream of chicken and cream of celery soup. about half a can each. I cooked this while sick so i also added a little cayenne pepper to give it a kick to break up my cold and it worked great! The rest of my family ate the entire pot that night!

This recipe is a good place to start. I thought it strange that it didn't include carrots!  So I added 1 cup of chopped carrots, a cup of frozen peas, and some diced red pepper.

This recipe is amazing! Best chicken noodle soup I have ever had, and sooo easy too! I took some advise from other reviewers and sauteed onions AND carrots in butter until onions are tender. (I omitted celery as we don't like it.)  Added the broth (I use low sodium...it doesn't even need the extra salt) and seasoning, added the chicken, then added the noodles and cooked until noodles were done. Add the cornstarch and water mixture last.  Much easier this way.  It's great, because you can use turkey or chicken!  I make this when I have leftover chicken or turkey from a previous dinner...so all you have to do is cut the chicken up and throw it in! Great stuff...make in a big batch and eat off it for awhile or freeze it!

Very nice recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken I picked up from the grocery store for the meat. I used the bones from it to make a homemade chicken stock. Since I didn't use sodium filled store bought stock I definitely NEEDED the salt that was mentioned in the recipe. My guess is Grandma made her own stock, not the stuff from the store. When you're cooking just use common sense when it comes to salt: if you are using salty ingredients like chicken broth, bullion, or salted butter you may have to omit some of the extra salt. I added the uncooked pasta directly to the soup instead of cooking it separately. The extra starch from the pasta thickened up the broth enough that I omitted the cornstarch part. Although when I do cook pasta in general I add a little bit of salt and oil to the water. It keeps the noodles from sticking together in a clump. The only other thing I changed was that I added carrots. For me, carrots are a must in chicken soup! Thanks for the recipe Grandma!

Very good.  I used only 1 tsp of salt and that was more than enough with regular chicken broth.  I did not have cornstarch so I used potato flakes instead and just sprinkled them on the boiling soup. I also added a cup of carrots and a tsp of garlic.   The family loved it.

OMG! Grandma did the world good (with a reviewer accomplice) coming up with this recipe! Only things I did differently per preference was I added carrots added more celery and made my own chicken broth. and after reading some reviews I thought the whole "adding an ENTIRE rotisserie chicken with the simmering vegetables then remove after 15 min shred desired amount of chicken add corn starch then add the shredded chicken" was an AMAZING idea. I halved the recipe for 6 . But everyone said this was thet best chicken noodle recipe EVER!

I think this was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever made!  I had a friend here who is not the complimenting type, and after one bite she was like,"Wow, how did you make this?" Mu husband had a similar reaction.  I did make some changes based on the reviews. I pretty much did the same thing as reviewer "Linda Lobo"..... used a rotisserie chicken from the store, added 1 cup of chopped baby carrots, threw the noodles in the soup to cook, added a bit of black pepper.  Left out the poultry seasoning, salt, and forgot the cornstarch mixture but I dont think it mattered!  Using the rotisserie chicken was the BEST suggestion by others, it saves time and packs so much flavor!

Three words for Grandma: TOO MUCH SALT!  (I
wonder if Granny was related to the Mortons). 
Anyway, I cut the amount by half and it was
STILL too much.  Next time I'll just eliminate
the salt entirely.

A very simple and tasty recipe! I added carrots in along with the celery and onion. I also added basil, oregano, rosemary, and dried parsley to the broth while it was boiling. By the time it took to cook everything, all of my dried seasonings were softened and added a great flavor to the soup.

I loved this recipe, I added 1 cup chopped carrots, and I also used 640z sow sodium broth and 32oz regular chicken broth and added no additional salt as requested in the recipe.  I also bought a rotisserie chicken at the deli and broke it into small strips for the 3 cups of chicken. This recipe was so wonderful and I'm glad I reduced the salt. I figured that my family members that wanted the additional salt could add a little to their own bowl.   Thank you Corwynn for posting this recipe, its wonderful.  The best homemade soup I have made yet.

A tiny bit too salty, and I used the Swanson Natural Goodness broth that is 33% less sodium. I recommend cutting the salt down to 1 tbsp. I also added carrots. A must!

Made this again tonight for the second time. I always boil the noodles right in the soup, add the whole roasted chicken(bones and all) and simmer for 20 mins or so, and of course add carrots. It's been a hit both times so thanks. Delicious.

I made this for my daughter's birthday as she requested chicken noodle soup. Also again for guests on New Year's.  I added a clove of minced garlic. My children's father is from the Middle East so they're used to heavy garlic in food. I thought it added something without being overpowering.

Since several reviewers remarked about the salt, I used low-sodium broth and omitted the salt.  I also added a couple of carrots and left the celery leaves in while cooking.  I prefer shredded to diced meat in my soups, so that was another alteration I made.

I'm often flummoxed by solid ingredients that have liquid measurements, e.g. "a cup of diced (whatever).  How many onions will create 2 cups of chopped onions?  How much chicken do I have to defrost to get 3.5 cups?  I can't tell you how many measuring cups I've destroyed trying to jam frozen chicken breasts into them.

So I just took wild guesses.  I used three boneless chicken breasts (20 oz total), two baseball-size onions, and three largish celery stalks.  It all seemed to work out just fine, but this is probably one of those recipes where you have to miss the measurements by a lot before you really make a mess of things.

Terrific soup.  I see myself making this one twice a month for the upcoming cold season.

I doubled this recipe in order to feed a big crowd and found it very easy to make. I boiled a whole chicken, with some celery, carrots and onion in order to make my own stock. To this I added more water, the deboned chicken, and the rest of the ingredients. Really tasty with a minimum of fuss.

This was really good.  Did as another reviewer suggested and took the meat off of a rotisserie chicken boiled in the stock.  Also added some additional breast meat, sliced carrot, garlic powder, white pepper and some salt at the end.

This was a great recipe. I made it on a cold, snowy night, and served it with some hot out of the oven crusty french bread, and my family loved it.  My 9 year old kept asking "what is that yummy smell" while it was simmering on the stove.  I used a whole rotisserie chicken, simmered it in the chicken broth, and then removed the skin and bones.  I also used a whole bag of egg noodles, and added carrots. I didnt see a need to use the cornstarch. I agree with others who said you may need more broth for leftovers the next day, because the noodles did soak up a lot of the liquid.  Thanks for sharing!!

very good soup, filling. next time i think i'll add more veggies and probably up the seasoning because it was a little bland in the flavor department, but other than that it was a good base

I really like this soup. I've made it twice. The first time it turned out perfectly, but the second I doubled the recipe and used a ton of cornstarch and it wouldn't ever really thicken up. I'm planning to freeze the leftovers and when I pull them out add a little more cornstarch and try to thicken it up then. But the flavor is excellent!

This is a good recipe. I cooked ingredients in a different order than written. Made my own broth, cooked chicken breast and thigh with seasonings. Removed chicken from broth(to let cool and to cube or shred) then added celery, onion, and carrots to broth, when veggies were almost done I added noodles. Cooked noodles according to doness preferred then added constarch and cubed chicken.

What I liked about this recipe is that it seemed to have the right combination of broth-to-chicken-to-noodles. However, I really changed the recipe. I took the meat off a rotisserie chicken and simmered the "remains" for 30 minutes in two cartons of chicken broth and with two bay leaves. I strained the broth from that, then added extra broth to make the 12 cups. I put in lots of extras--two carrots shredded on a box grater, 1 clove of diced garlic, 1 tsp. of thyme, 1/2 tsp. of marjoram, 1/2 tsp. of oregeno, some paprika and a sprinkling of pepper. I did add salt since I used low-sodium broth. I like the idea of thickening the soup, but it wasn't clear to me if the cornstarch thickened it that much. When all was said and done, the soup was very good, but still lacking something. I sprinkled more pepper in and that did the trick--delicious! So I'll probably be using this recipe in the future as a basis, but will still tinker around with the spices.

I loved the idea of this soup, but I changed a lot of things before I found it to be the perfect chicken noodle soup.  I pre cooked the chicken in a skillet with a little water and set it aside to start off.  Then I sauteed carrots, celery and onions in a dutch oven before adding the broth and other seasonings.  I brought it to a boil and then  let it simmer for 30 minutes so all the flavors blended.  I then added the chicken and allowed it to simmer another 15 minutes.  I added the raw noodles directly to the soup instead of cooking them separate and they were cooked in under 10 minutes.  I tried using the cornstarch the first time and it made it way too thick to be a soup, not to mention very starchy, so I omitted it completely the next time and really felt like I was eating a really good homemade chicken noodle soup from back in the day.

I love this recipe, it is easy and fast, but tastes like you cooked all day.  I didn't use the recommended amount of salt, but just salted it to my taste. This is a recipe for people who like lots of chicken and noodles.  Using a rotisserie chicken from the grocery gives it a great flavor, plus there is enough meat left to freeze for a second pot! I will make this often.

I'm not sure why everyone thinks this is the best ever...it tastes like every other chicken noodle soup I've had.  Actually, it was a little bland.  I think a lot more spices/herbs/seasonings would have helped this soup a lot since I used REAL chicken stock.  (If you use the canned stuff...there's already a lot of salt, MSG and other stuff in there, so it wouldn't be as bland...or healthy!)  Although I did like the cornstarch/water slurry touch.  Made the soup a little heartier.  Overall not bad, but definitely not the best.

I'd give it more stars if I could.  This was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had.  My husband and toddler couldn't agree more.  I added thin slices of carrots to mine and used 7 boullion cubes rather than chicken broth and let it simmer all afternoon, mmmm!  I did have to use a little more corn starch than was called for.

My fiance asked me to make him chicken noodle soup when he was sick so I came to AllRecipes and found this recipe, which turned out to be perfect. I ended up eating most of the pan instead of him because it was so delicious! Just the thing to warm you up on a cold night.

I found this recipe to be average at best. I used canned chicken broth (perhaps homemade broth would have been better?) and found the overall flavor to be ok, but not great. I agree with other reviews that it was too salty, and I didn't really like the flavor of the poultry seasoning in this recipe. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Wow this was a wonderful recipe!  This was definetly the best soup that I have ever made!  The only thing I did different was add carrots.  There was a lot of reviews that complained how salty the soup was, but they were probably using high sodium chicken broth or didn't make the broth from scratch.  Healthy Choice sells broth that is 98% sodium free.  Anyway, you got to try this soup... its easy, delicious, and made enough for a family to get thirds!

My kids and husband loved the taste and the wide egg noodles.  Made a huge portion.  Wish there was some easier less time consuming way to get the broth without spending a fortune on canned broth.  Other than that it is a winner.  I froze half of my batch because it made so much, but the noodles didn't fair well.  I would freeze half before adding noodles and for a quick supper one night boil egg noodles and add to defrosted soup.

This soup is alright, I mostly like that it's quick and easy to make and yet still has a fair amount of flavor.  Maybe with the right noodles I would like it just a bit better though.

Best homemade chicken noodle soup I've ever had! I left out the extra salt and the oil. Added peas,carrots & pressed garlic and sautéed them with the celery and onion to soften before adding to the broth. I Put the entire rotisserie chicken with 3 bay leaves in the pot and boil for 10-15 mins. Adds flavor! Remember to remove the bay leaves. I'd make this again!

I made this for a friend with a sore throat she loved it. I used a whole rotisserie chicken like someone suggested. Added in spinach, a bit of pesto, garlic, carrots, mixed veggies. Even the neighborhood girl said it got her to eat her veggies happily.

used whole-wheat noodles, and boiled the whole roasted chicken and the juices from the bag, as the other review suggested.  Delicious.

Very yummy.  I could tell right away this was too salty w/out even trying it, so I read the other reviews and did the following: 6 cups regular broth, 6 cups low sodium broth, no salt.  Added 1 cup of sliced carrots, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2 bay leaves, some freshly ground black pepper, and a whole "naked" (i.e. no spices) rotisserie chicken.  Boiled it for 15 min., then removed chicken, tore meat into little pieces and added it back into the soup.  I made the egg noodles separately and added them before serving.  Oh, I also forgot about the corn starch, but it was still delicious!  Next time I might try a non-egg noodle to see which is better.

Great chicken noodle soup! It's not to thin and runny like some can be thanks to the corn starch! I also omitted the salt and used reduced sodium chicken broth. I am watching my sodium, so my husband can always salt his to taste if he wants. But it tastes salty enough to me!! I also added a cup of carrots. I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used 1/4 a tsp of dried thyme and 3/4 tsp of dried sage to replace. I also used whole wheat noodles to up the fiber!

I did follow another users suggestion and added the whole chicken then removed it and added just the meat.  I also added a cup of carrots.  My husband and I both agreed this was the best chicken noodle soup we've ever had!

Looks like a good recipe but I always add fresh diced carrots. Also, we found that if you're not going to finish the soup at first serving, add noodles to each bowl. The noodles tend to soak up the broth thus having to add water when re-heating.

Just so easy and good.  Don't add any salt! Used "Better than Bullion" soup base and leftover rotisserie chicken. Added carrots, and used less cornstarch/water at the end.  Just enough for my husband's lunch tomorrow after feeding 4 young kids and 2 adults.

This chicken noodle soup is excellent.  I roasted a whole chicken (30 mins in the microwave in a pampered chef roaster) seasoned with sea salt, pepper and garlic.  Then put the whole roaster & juices  in large pot with the low sodium chicken broth, carrots, celery and seasonings.  I didn't have time that night to pull the chicken off of the bone, so I put everything in the refrigerator until the next day.  Next day - pulled all chicken off of the bones added to the soup in a crock pot I let it simmer for 4 hours.  Added the noodles at the very end - let it all heat through and served.  It was excellent!  I did find that the chicken and noodles do absorb a lot of the broth if you put the leftovers in the fridge, so have some extra chicken broth on hand to add later on if you need to.

Recipe is very good, However I would recommend using less salt unless you like salty soup. And probably only a tablespoon of cornstarch because 1/3 of a cup does make it kind of thick.

Very Good!  Simmered what was left of a roasted chicken for 1 to 2 hours in 5 cups of broth/water mix.  Added one chicken bouillon cube for additional flavor.  Remove from heat & cool.  Pick chicken from bones & return to broth;  discard bones.  Chill overnight.  Next day about 1 hour before serving, melt 3 T. butter & splash of oil in 3-5 quart pot; add 1 onion, coarsely chpd & 1 bunch of chopped celery to butter/oil mixture in pot; salt & pepper and stir occasionally for about 15 min.  Add the chilled broth/chicken; stir in 1 frozen bag of mixed veggies and additional canned broth if needed.  I use 3 min. noodles so they can be added just prior to serving.  I did add 1 t. smoked paprika; nice slightly smoky flavor; add more if you want a stronger taste.

This is a GREAT soup! It is so easy to make!  I made a couple of changes.  I first put the broth, seasonings, celery, carrots and the whole chicken (as rec. by others) into a crock pot.  I really wanted to capture the flavor of the chicken!  After a few hours I pulled the chicken out, cut the meat off and added it back to the pot along with the noodles, water and starch!  Then I just waited for the noodle to get done (about 20 mins.)!  It turned out GREAT!  I love it and will be making this again!

This was so quick and easy to make, and wonderful. I followed other reviewers' suggestions:
*used whole rotisserie chicken, and add to broth right away
*added half bag of frozen carrots
*added bay leaf, italian seasonings, crushed garlic to broth
Came out wonderful.  Only thing I would do differently is cut down on the salt.  Mine came out a bit salty but I did not use low sodium broth.

This is definately a keeper ! I did not add any salt per other reviews. The soup was plenty salty with the broth. I did however add black pepper to taste and I also sauteed the celery and onion with 3 cloves of garlic and the poulty seasoning(this really brings out the flavor in your spices) in evoo then added the broth to that. I also used a store bought rotisserie chicken- per other reviews. Yummy.

I didn't quite follow the instructions for this recipe. It was easier to follow my own instructions. I'm usually brave enough to try that. 

I first sauteed the celery, onions and carrots (I added carrots to my soup). Then cubed the chicken and added to the sautee. Sauteed for about 5-7 minutes then added the chicken broth (I added 3 cups of water on top of the chicken broth because the broth made it too salty). I let it simmer until the carrots were almost done then added the noodles and simmered until everything cooked. I used flour instead of cornstarch because I didn't have any. Then I added the flour and water to make it a little thicker and let it simmer for another 2 minutes. 
I didn't add any salt or poultry seasoning because the chicken stock gave it enough flavor.
It came out wonderfully.

I made this tonight, and my hubby & I loved it!  I made only a few changes, I sautéed in EVO the onion & celery, and added shredded carrots.  It seemed to add a little something extra from a soup I made from allrecipres last week.  I followed previous comments, bought a rotisserie chicken, and had it cooking in the broth for about an hour before shredding.  I used 6 cans of chicken broth, which comes out to 84oz.  I used the frozen Reams noodles instead of the regular egg noodles, I just like them better.  I would use less salt next time, 1 1/2 tbls seems a little too high for me.  All in all, this is a keeper!

I'm not a fan of canned chicken noodle soup, because my mother always made us yummy homemade chicken noodle.  My mother passed away when I was young and so I could never find the recipe she used with the *frozen* egg wide noodles (I prefer the frozen ones) until I came across this recipe!! This nearly tastes just like my mother's, except the way I make it is slightly different, as my mother did.  Instead of using a saucepan or Dutch oven, I use the crock pot for those ingredients to cook all day. However, I use organic chicken broth, a couple cubes of chicken bouillon, a package of chicken tenders (whole, not diced, as they will shred nicely for you at the end of the day), chopped carrots/celery, and a little onion powder in place of the strong taste of regular onions.  When it's time for dinner, I follow the first and third part of the directions exactly, except it's added to the crock pot, of course.  I let it heat through for about five or ten minutes and serve with crackers.  I'm so thrilled to have ran across this recipe, as it tastes a lot like my mother's!  Mmmmm, delicious!  Perfect for all sorts of occasions! My family loves it!  Thank you so much, Corwynn!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  If you are looking for a good chicken noodle soup for comfort food this is it!  And it's soooo easy and fast too!  The recipe is fantastic as is, but I jazzed it up the second time and I think it made a better one.  The most important thing is the broth.  Choose a broth that is made from 100% chicken stock.  Basically, a homemade stock in a box/can.  Be sure to read the ingredients and make sure there is nothing artificially added.  Organic would also be ideal.  I used a rotisserie chicken which meant that the meat itself was more juicy and flavorful.  I also added a couple of carrots cut up, and threw in a handful of peas at the end.  Lastly I really liked the flavor that the poultry seasoning added, so I doubled that. YUM YUM YUM!

Fantastic soup! Can't say enough good things about it. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Halved the recipe to 6 servings and had plenty left over. My husband has been after me to learn to make chicken noodle soup forever and he absolutely loved it! I don't really eat much soup and I thought it was great too! Left out the salt because I couldn't find low sodium broth, but it was just salty enough. Also left out the celery and added carrots. Bought a roasted chicken and boiled the meat with the vegetables. Also cooked the noodles in the soup. The best!

This soup is the best! I added 1 cup of carrots and 1 cup of parsnips in addition to the onion and celery. I steamed the carrots, parsnips, and celery for a bit to soften them up. I used a rotisserie chicken and boiled it in the broth as others suggested. The flavor was fantastic. If you use a rotisserie chicken, I suggest using half the poultry seasoning as others have suggested. It was a bit on the salty side. 5-stars indeed!

This is a delicious soup.  I make the rotisserie chicken version (omit poultry seasoning, add a whole cooked rotisserie chicken & juices to the broth with the vegetables, simmer for 15 min, remove chicken, cut up meat and put back in).  My husband and 3 year old son love this soup and this recipe makes enough for dinner and a few days of leftover soup - perfect for lunch or afterschool snack!

This soup is good but I agree with other reviewers-way too much salt! I would recommend not adding any - your broth should have plenty. I used a homemade stock from this site. I used macaroni noodles and just added them to the pot along with the veggies, then I covered and simmered for only ten minutes. There is no need for the extra fat from the oil, or an extra dirty dish! For color, I added some fresh parsley right before serving.

I have to agree, this is the best chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten! We made this for 150 people at our Lenten Soup and Sermon, and got soooo many compliments. Even gave the recipe to everyone in the kitchen and some in the crowd! We too added carrots. I love this recipe site.....it is so nice to just put in a number and punch a button and have the recipe for the number of servings you want. My compliments to your Grandmother!

Okay, I see all the great reviews but I have to agree with those who said this was too salty (and I didn't even use the salt ingrediant). But I think this wouldn't have been as salty had I used a low-sodium canned broth or had I made my own homemade chicken broth. Using regular chicken broth is high in sodium, which explains the too salty complaints..including mine. I might give this a second try with a different broth.

Liked the ease of cooking. Had to cook a whole chicken breast in the broth. Poached for about twenty minutes. Removed chicken from the broth, then the meat from the bones, diced and added 
to the recipe.

This was the 1st time I made Chicken Soup.  It turned out great.  My whole family loved it.  Great flavor.  A little salty.  I might think about a little less salt next time but other than that it is a keeper.

My family really liked this.  Even my extremely picky 14 year old son who doesn't much like soup.  I used 3 four cup boxes of Swanson's no fat chicken broth, a 10 oz. box of Perdue Quick Cuts precooked chicken, mini bow tie pasta, added lots of chopped flat leaf parsley and about 4 T. of grated Romano cheese.  Something Italians do.  It adds a lot of flavor and no one suspects. Also no salt and no cornstarch.  Will definitely make again.

Thought this was a great chicken soup recipe. I only added a dash of salt instead of recommended amount. I also added baby carrots and frozen sweet corn. Turned out great. Do not leave out the poultry seasoning. It definitely enhances the flavor.

Would have been probably a 5-star rating if not for the saltiness. It was way too salty and nobody liked it because of this, however had it NOT been for the salt content being so high, felt it would have been wonderful.Didn't check the other reviews before I made this or would have probably eliminated the salt alltogether.

Very tasty soup, and easy to make.  I added larger amounts of onion, carrot, and celery, because I like a heartier soup, and thickened with dried potato flakes instead of cornstarch.  I didn't use 12 cups chicken broth, because my pot wouldn't hold that much, and I used Reames (frozen) egg noodles.  I also added fresh parsely and garlic.  I will use a different type of poultry seasoning next time - the kind I have is made by Corning Revere and has a strong thyme flavor, which I am not fond of.  But overall, definitely very good.

I have been looking for a good, easy chicken soup recipe and this is it!!!  Instead of noodles, I used the recipe for Dumplings, and my picky kids were in seventh heaven!  My husband took one taste and said "Now, this is a KEEPER!"

I followed some modifications and put the whole rotisserie chicken in the stock with the pan drippings, added basil, garlic powder, 2 bay leaves, and a cup of cut carrots. Then lifted the chicken out stripped it and put the cut up chicken back in. It was the best ever, maybe a little salty.

Pretty good soup; very basic, so it's easy to make your own.  I opted out of using the noodles, preferring instead to use up some of my potatoes, roughly chopped, and I also added chopped carrot to the soup.  I simmered this all day in the crock pot and ended up with a huge amount of soup (I halved this recipe as well, so be forewarned) that was delicious with a garlic bread I got at Costco.  I left out the salt entirely while putting it together--it's so much more practical to let individuals season with salt and pepper at the table as needed.  I do think this needs garlic (for once I forgot to add garlic on my own!) and maybe a few other seasonings, but it's a decent start and makes for a hearty soup that is good for a winter's day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as written for my husband who has a cold. I've never made chicken soup before so I didn't know what to expect (so I cut it down to 4 servings). The flavor was decent and he seemed to like it, but I don't think it was quite what I was looking for. I don't know if it was my broth, (homemade) but the liquid seemed to evaporate and I ended up adding water at the end.

This is an excellent recipe that allows many modifications to taste, the main of which is the addition of more vegetables for me. I have seen many reviews stating that the amount of salt is excessive, but I would counter that one and a half tablespoons of salt is JUST RIGHT if you're using your own chicken stock and NOT canned. When I make my own chicken stock, I do not add salt; therefore, adding salt when making the soup is necessary for taste. Sure, some tastes would add more or less, but the recipe as written is not excessive. My guess is those who found it excessive were using canned broth that already contains salt.

Very good base recipe. I made this several times - both as written and following reviewers' comments. I definitely recommend adding at least 1/2 cup of sliced carrots and parsley flakes, plus garlic. I had better luck cooking the noodles separately. It is great with egg noodles or with wholegrain wheat egg noodles.

Great soup.  I save myself a step and an extra dirty pot by bowling the noodle in the soup at the end.  The starch from the noodles makes it just as thick as the addition of cornstarch.

Thanks to the poultry seasoning, this soup has suprisingly good flavor and is a good basic recipe.  You can substitute or leave out a vegetable and use bouillon cubes instead of broth, but I wouldn't bother making it without the poultry seasoning.  Next time I will add white pepper and also see if I can make it with fewer pots and pans. 

I realized about 2/3 through that I didn't have the cornstarch--or couldn't find it.  I used flour instead--which was fine.  Instead of pouring the thickener into the soup and hoping it doesn't turn lumpy you need to add spoonfuls of the hot cooking soup to the thickener after you've mixed it with water and stir.  When it's about the consistency of whole milk you can pour into the soup pot and stir.  You won't get lumps.

You can make this soup as written and you'll be fine.  Or, you can add the things you like to it and all should be good.

I made this recipe twice now, the first Time I followed the recipe exactly as shown. The second time i used low sodium chicken broth, and two cups (I modified  the recipe to serve 6) of water and it was still too salty. I ended having to add more water to lessen the saltiness! I would recommend to avoid adding the additional salt the recipe suggest.
Easy recipe, with a few modifications it makes for a perfect soup!

I added carrots as well and doubled up on the celery. I also added a tablespoon of poultry seasoning which gave it even more flavor. The first time I made this, I followed the entire recipe and it was a little bland. If you like a little more flavor, I recommend more veggies and more seasoning. Very easy recipe and delicious!!!!

Yum! This was wonderful with some small, simple changes.

- For 6 cups of the broth, use low-sodium
- Only use 1/2 a tablespoon of salt vs 1 1/2 tablespoons
- Add a cup of sliced carrots to the celery, onion mix
- Drop the entire chicken (and drippings) into the broth when you get the broth to a boil after adding veggies - fish it all out and then pull it and put it back in

Great recipe! Will use again and again!

I make this soup all the time and freeze it in ball jars for lunches.  I add carrots and leave out corn starch.  I think the people that complain it is too salty are starting off with broth that is too salty.  If you start with high quality broth or make it yourself, it is fine in the end.

A good recipe, but in need of significant modifications.  Using 1-1/2 tablespoons of salt is waaaaaaay too much and will cause your blood pressure to skyrocket!  I used only a small dash of salt as the chicken stock already contained salt.  Also, I didn't use all the cornstarch specified in this recipe.  Instead, I slowly added the cornstarch mix to the soup and frequently taste tested the soup.  Half of the cornstarch mix was more than ample and had the desired thickness.  I think you would loose the flavor if all the cornstarch was added.  There is no need for poultry seasoning if you marinate the chicken breasts for several hours ahead of time in a good spice rub like I did.  For additional flavor, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons of pepper and 3 bay leaves.  As for the vegetables, I also added 4 small diced unpeeled red skinned potatoes and a bag of frozen sliced carrots.  I precooked my noodles to an al dente texture and rinsed out the starch and added them at the very end.  A great soup to have with home made or store bough biscuits in a can.  Because of the alarming amount of salt and excessive amount of corn starch, this recipe only gets 3 stars from me.

Made this recipe last night for dinner (two colds in the house!) and it was great!  Made some of the suggestions others put on here namely letting the whole chicken sit in the broth for 15 min, dash of red paper flakes, added cream of chicken soup to thicken it, sauteed the onions and celery in butter to soften them up before adding the broth... very good!

This is the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had!! Only made a few changes: didn't pre-cook noodles, just threw them in with the vegetables, added carrots, and the only seasonings I added to the broth were 1 t salt, 1/2 t black pepper, 1/2 t garlic powder. Perfect! I was looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow, but there weren't any!

Yummm! i scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. used 1/2 teaspoon of Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt. threw the noodles right into the stock during the boiling. this made the soup thick without using corn starch. i also shredded the chicken instead of dicing and put in some carrots. this came out so flavorful and so easy! thank you for this recipe.

Thanks again for another great recipe Corwynn! I added carrots and that was all that I changed. I wish I had some peas, I think I would've added them, too. But, as is, it's a great soup! It makes a lot, too! I got four big containers full out of it.

This is an excellent soup! I made it for my husband and he loved it! I cut the recipe in half and it still turned out fine. The only thing I would change next time is the amount of salt. It came out way to salty (even though we love salt). I ended up adding water to dilute the amount of salt. I would cut the amount of salt in half next time.

this recipe was great. Whole family loved it. I followed advice of others a used a rotisserie chicken. I cut up the chicken then boiled the bones in 12 cups of waterto make a broth. Then added chicken base to my preferred taste. I added a cup of carrots, celery and chopped onion. I added poultry seasoning, some minced garlic, a dash of oregano a bit of season salt and pepper. I added the noodles directly to the soup to cook and skipped the corn starch. My husband said it was better than his grandmas which is the ULTIMATE compliment. Will make this again and again.

This was fabulous! It was my first time ever making chicken noodle soup and I will definitely make it again with this recipe! I followed the advice of putting the cooked whole chicken into the simmering pot with the veggies and it gave the soup good flavor but the chicken was soft and chewy. Next time, I will not cook it for the whole 15 minutes and take the chicken off part way through and put the carcass back in. I added some dried parsley as well.

For how simple and fast this was I was shocked at the amount of flavor it had.  I did add 1 cup sliced carrots and increased the noodles to 3 1/2 cup and it was perfect!

Delicious...just cut back a tiny bit on the poultry seasoning...and make sure to use Broad egg noodles- they hold up better.  I added some carrots too...what is soup without carrots????!

In grandmother's day she would have boiled the chicken in water, making her own broth, hence the need for salt.  Today, judging by the reviews, everyone buys chicken parts and uses canned chicken broth (not nearly as good) so if this is what you're doing, do NOT add any salt.   Also, constarch needs to be mixed/dissolved with water before adding it to the soup.  This is a great old fashioned soup recipe.

I can't believe Grandma didn't put carrots in her recipe. Chicken noodle soup just isn't the same without carrot, so I put them in. I also did not use the cornstarch because I wanted more of a brothy soup. With those simple changes this was a five star recipe.

A great basic recipe!  I omitted the cornstarch because the noodles added a touch of starch even though I boiled and rinsed them separately.  
I added carrots which gave it a sweet taste.  For the 2 of us, I used one large can of broth and cut up 2 raw chicken breasts and cooked it together.  Delish!

I agree, this is a good base recipe for chicken noodle soup but tastes much better customized. I definitely added carrots, made my own chicken broth, although did add poultry seasoning. salt isnt necesarry, i agree. Each person salted their own if they wanted to, others i served this too thought it was best as is. I made the stock out of chicken wings (all i had) and used the whitest part of the wing for some the meat then boiled chicken breast in the almost finished broth, cubed it, and added it the last 10 mins. I made my own egg noodles(found on allrecipes!) and everyone looooved this dish!. If you've made soup be/fore, you'll know what works best, i think.

I always turn this into a 12 qt. chicken noodle soup. To to this you need one entire roasted chicken from the store, deboned and diced, one bag of celery, one bag of carrots, about 15 ck bullion cubes, 5 bay leaves, some thyme, a bag of egg noodles, and pepper to taste (and a little cornstarch + water to thicken a little). That makes 12 qts and its delicious. My husband loves it so much he asks for it...in the middle of the Florida summer.

I think what made this extra good was that I used the "Grandma's noodles" found in the frozen section. I also used the suggestion of a rotisserie chicken.  I don't do well with corn so I used potato starch insead.

DELISH!! Since I wasn't using a rotesserie chicken (grocery had fryer chickens on sale for $1 a pound) because I roasted a chicken earlier in the week. I decided to use full strength (full sodium) broth. This was perfect even after the startch of the noodles set in. Worked as wrote for me.  Just what I needed on a cold wet rainy day. Thanks for sharing!

Critical move: make this with roasted chicken! I just buy the rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I shred the meat by hand and throw it in the pot! Once you get that right, this is great.

excellent fix for a sick husband!  i started by sauteeing the onions, celery (and carrots that i added).  then, i added them to the simmering stock.  i added some garlic powder and a bay leaf, too!  the noodles soaked up a lot of the broth, so add more if you like it thinner.  i did not add cornstarch, because i wanted to broth to be thin for the sore throat i was trying to mend!  thanks for the great recipe...this one's a keeper :)

This was very good.  I followed the recipe to a t except that I sautéed my carrots (added them), celery and onion prior to putting the broth in.  I had heard a chef say one time that the base of all really good soup starts with the saute of the veggies. I also followed another reviewers advice and put my whole cooked chicken from the deli into the pot for 30 minutes and let it simmer before taking the meat off the bone.  I waited to salt my soup until the end and it needed about what the recipe called for.  This may be because I used good Organic Chicken Broth.  I also had no issues with the corn starch water mix.  This made a big pot of soup with lots of leftovers.  I will make this again. Thank you for sharing.

This is very good, but I had to make some changes because my kids run from the sight of onions and celery.  I cook a whole chicken in four cups of slightly salted water along with whole stalks of celery (leaves also), sliced onions, a little dried parsley, and sliced carrots.  When the chicken is done, remove it from the pot and strain the broth to remove all of the cooked vegetables. Skim off as much of the fat as possible.  Add enough water to the broth to measure six cups, pour it into a clean pot and bring it to a simmer, adding a bouillon cube if you wish.  Add about 2 tsp. of salt and just a sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  Taste before adding more.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture, using 4 tbsp. of cornstarch.  Cook for a few minutes until the cornstarch is clear and the broth is slightly thickened.  Meanwhile, bone and cube the chicken.  Add the dry noodles and two cups of chicken to the broth.  Cover and cook about ten minutes until the noodles are tender then adjust the seasonings. The finished dish is a tasty, light-amber clear broth thick with noodles and chicken. So yummy with toasted garlic bread.

This was good and super easy.  I omitted the salt and added peas and carrots and corn.  Big hit with the family.  I make the noodles separately and add to each soup bowl -- it keeps better in the fridge and you have the option of freezing.  It makes a LOT of soup.

I hate to dissent, but I really didn't find this recipe to be great. It was pretty bland, even after adding additional salt, pepper, garlic, and about 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley. I skipped the noodle-boiling step and added the uncooked noodles directly to the soup, which worked fine. If I try this again, I'll follow the suggestions to use a rotisserie chicken; I think that'll add the flavor that's lacking.

I've tried 'em all and this is the best chicken soup I've ever made!  I only used 8 cups of broth.  I added sliced carrots.  Did not use cornstarch or water.  I put three large frozen breasts in the crockpot and dumped a large carton of broth over them and added the rest of the ingredients.  Right before serving we shredded the chicken and added a few cups of cooked, skinny egg noodles.  It was to die for!

I was looking for a chicken noodle soup recipe that tasted good and wouldn't take 4 hours to make.  This was it! I used 3 boxes of broth (one of them low sodium), and I purchased two pre-cooked chicken breasts from the grocery deli, and that seemed like plenty of chicken meat in the soup.  Added about a tsp. more salt while it was cooking. By all means, do not waste the time and energy to cook the noodles separately; just throw them into the boiling soup. A good blast of black pepper helps if you are suffering from a cold.

Absolutely gross.. Thats all I can say.. With a family of 5 only one liked it. I really thought that his would be better since most 5 stars live up to there ratings.  This was entirely to salty and starchy. I followed the recipe to a tea. Next time I will stick to my original Chicken Noodle Soup even if it takes longer to make... I gave it a one since only 1 out of 5 of us liked it...

This is a good starter recipe for a non-cook.  However, there needs to be quite a bit of doctoring.  Cut water/broth to 8 cups, add a generous portion of chopped carrots, forget the poultry seasoning and add a bay leaf and a pinch of marjoram and sage.  I added my ingredients to a crock pot starting with a chicken breast (with skin/bones) that was seared in a hot pan all sides.  The bits in the pan were washed with hot broth and added also to the crock pot.  After several hours, I removed the bay leaf and skimmed some of the residual fat on the surface.  Tear the chicken meat into pieces and return back to soup with the noodles, only 1 tsp. salt and a generous dash of pepper. Forget the cornstarch slurry for supposed body...this only takes away from the homemade fresh quality.

Really good!  I "sauteed" the vegetables (I, too added carrots)in 2 cups of chicken broth along with the salt and the poultry seasoning in my big dutch oven.  After about 5-7 minutes, I added the rest of the broth and simmered for 15 minutes.  I also only partially cooked the noodles (about 5 minutes) before adding them to the hot soup along with the chicken.  I'll be making this again for sure.

Yummy!  I used the whole broasted chicken from the deli, as others suggested ... great flavor, and really simple.  I cooked my noodles separately before I added them, but they still soaked up all the broth the next day!  Too much work and too many containers to store them separately in the fridge, since I pack for lunches ... I just added a little canned chicken broth when I was ready to reheat for lunch the next day.  I'll be making this one again!

This recipe was very good but I added 2 Tbsp. of chopped garlic and used the thin noodles. My family LOVED it! By using the thin noodles I didn't have to pre-cook them. I just added them after everything was hot! Very easy!

This is a very good recipe. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was of changes I made. I ignored the salt as suggested by others. Did not use the cornstarch, and added dried parsley flakes, garlic powder, and pepper to taste. Tastes better when cooked longer.

Oh my!  Do NOT use store-brand chicken stock with this!  It is sooooo salty, I had to dump it down the sink :(  (Even after I tried the potato method of removing salt).  I am willing to try the recipe again, since 5*'d recipes on allrecipes.com tend to be pretty good, but just wanted to warn others to watch the salt.

Wow! This soup was great. I made a smaller portion, since it was just me and my roommate. I used 8 cups of low sodium chicken broth, meat from one small game hen, and 2 cups of wide egg noodles. I wanted the flavor of all the veggies, but I can't stand eating cooked celery. I put 1/2 yellow onion, 3 stalks celery, and 5 cloves of garlic (all coarsely chopped) in chesse cloth and allowed them to boil into the soup before it finished, about 10 minutes, and then removed them. I also cooked the noodles directly in the broth and added sliced carrots at the end of it all. All in all, the best soup i've ever made at home!!!!

This recipe is simple and delicious! I froze the leftover soup to eat later.
I took the advice of some other reviewers 1)doubled my veggies + added carrots 2) I baked 5 large chicken leg quarters for an 1hr on 350, put a few of the bones in the broth with the veggies for extra flavor, and removed them before adding the chk. and nood. 3) Ended up using the cornstarch and water mixture after seeing the soup would be bit thin without it(added this before the adding the chk. and nood.).You should add it gradually over low heat. There shouldn't be a chemical reaction ;) 4) Threw noodles in about 15 minutes before time. 5) Basil is also a great addition to this soup!

This was an excellent soup. Only changes I would make would be to add salt according to taste. Per the recipe, it was too salty. As for adding the cornstarch, it gave the soup a nice consistency instead of a watered down soup.

Everyone in my house loves this recipe. I cheat a bit because I buy a baked chicken from the local supermarket and I tear all the meat off which equals out to what the recipe calls for. I also add some carrots. This is a delicious recipe. I have made it many times.

Loved the recipe.  It looked too watery, but have tons of flavor.  I added 1 cup more noodles, 1 cup carrots, 1 large onion, and 4 pieces of celery, instead of the 1 cup.  My family loves it.  Will keep this soup for the winter, to combat those colds and flu.  ;^)

Great and Easy soup recipe.  I use the slow cooker chicken broth recipe from this site.  Add poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and dean and delucas fine herbs.  Serve with the great garlic cheese biscuit recipe from this site.  Makes a complete "All Recipe" web site meal.

This is the best chicken soup we've had yet!  I agree, the poultry season really makes it.  We didn't have chicken stock, so I used chicken bullion (1 cube for every 1 cup of water).  I also didn't have egg noodles, so I used lasagna noodles and just broke them into pieces.  We didn't add the salt and it was still salty!  I think next time, we'll add more water.  Other than that, it tasted great!  Thank you!

I thought this soup was wonderful. Due to several reviews that I read prior to preparing the soup, I decided to cut out some of the salt. As it turned out, I do not feel that was necessary. Next time I think I will add carrots for color and an extra cup or so of pasta. Other than that...great!

I read the reviews that said that this recipe was to salty.(To salty? Obviously not a Texan)  I added a clove of garlic and carrots to mine, and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great.  I added lots of carrots and peas also, but also half a cup of chopped hot kimchi. I also did not think it needed any salt.

Very good recipe and fairly easy.  I poached my chicken as well and shredded it and I used frozen egg noodles.  I prefer those to the dry ones.  I added some sliced carrots as well and it was just what the doctor ordered for my husbands cold.

Well, I don't know what all these reviews about saltiness are about, since I actually had to ADD salt (nothing wrong with that BTW).  This soup is excellent and easy!  All 3 of my kids are sick today, and I was fresh out of Campbells.  I did substitute arrowroot as a thickener, which I highly recommend.  Like all soup, seasonings should be added {{slowly, gradually}} to taste.  If you haven't tasted the soup every so often as it cooks, Grandma would scoff if you said her soup wasn't any good.  Thank you, Corwynne!  This hits the spot!

A very nice recipe.  I made it with plans of putting it into individual jars so I could just pull a jar out of the refridgerator, take it to work/school, throw it in a microwave and eat.  Didn't work so well, as the three other people in the family devoured the whole pot when I wasn't looking.  I substituted carrots in for celery (tho next time I am adding both), put a few more onions in, used half of the salt called for, and used a chicken boullion to make broth.  My family appriciated it (even my kitten got his fair share! He adored it) I loved it, it was fairly easy to make.  All around a very nice, basic, easy, tasty chicken noodle soup recipe.

This soup is great!   I added more noodles and also crushed garlic.  I used less salt, the same as other folks did.  The broth is salty enough so you really don't need too much more.  Made a lot, too. Great recipe, I'll make again.  Thanks!

Very good!  I hate when people comment on a recipe but make there own alterations to it and comment on how THAT turned out.. however, soup is one of the forgiving recipes.  This was a very good base soup and would be perfect as is, however I wanted a little more flavor and spice.  I didn't have any onions so I used onion powder (just eyeballed it), I also used chicken thighs and that made for a very moist, flavorful meat to bite into.  I ran out of broth so I used bouillon cubes (same diff, right?!) and added some water to lower the sodium.  I also added 2 bay leaves, some parsley, fresh black pepper, carrots,  and corn.   I loved the how the corn starch made it perfectly thick.  Overall, great recipe with or without your added preferences.

This was delicious. I did 1 TBSP of salt instead of 1 1/2 and I will even do less next time. I will 1 1/2 times the veggies, I would have put peas in but didn't have any.  Other than that it was great. My two year old gobbled it up!

I used this as a base for my soup, I always use a rotisserie chicken. I take off the legs & wings from the chicken, and that's another meal for my wife & myself. I ad the rest of the chicken just like it is to the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and then simmer on low for 30 minutes. take chicken out and strain the broth & return to to pot.  ad a pinch pf salt, tyme, & garlic powder. mean time I sauteed an onion & a cup of celery in 2 tbls of butter. I ad that to the broth simmering on low. I pull all the meat of the chicken & discard bones & skin.best to use your fingers so no bones slip into the broth. I then add a whole bag of frozen carrots to the broth and bring to a boil for 3 to 5 minutes & then ad the extra wide noodles to the same pot and cook for like 6 minutes. No need for corn starch......Mighty good soup.

This soup is wonderful!  I made this for a friend up on her discharge from the hospital and she is very specific about what she did NOT want in her chicken soup.  This recipe fits her tastes perfectly!  My tendency is to add a lot more vegetables for me, but this is a classic, balanced recipe that everyone will appreciate.  It will give the wonderful, medicinal qualities of a chicken soup for even the picky eaters in your family.

The cornstarch thickened it up way too much! I added dumplings to it also, and it was almost like a casserole. The seasoning is off too.

I made this today for my wife who has the flu.  The soup is very good!  Got compliments from the wife & kids.  I will be making this often as this is now my go to recipe!  I took the advise from one reviewer and bought a rotisserie chicken and cut it up.  Next time though I will buy or make a couple of breast instead as we like all white meat.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this using rotisserie chicken and homemade noodles. It couldn't have been much easier, and I doubt there is much of anything one could do to mess this recipe up. The only other thing I changed was to add some carrots and a splash of cream towards the end of simmering. I felt the cream added just a bit of richness to the broth.

Added carrots, garlic and use smoked chicken as someone else had suggested very good.Might try a variation with blacked chicken or garlic roasted chicken to kick up the flavor.

Ok, but needed some adjustments. Added garlic, carrots, dash of oregano and dash of basil to the ingredients. Omitted celery, salt and cornstarch. Used 2 vegetable broth cubes instead of chicken broth. Cooked pasta with soup, rather than cooking it separately.

Great basic recipe! I used leftover turkey instead of chicken, replaced the celery with carrots and my own "italian herb" blend in place of the poultry seasoning.  This was very easy to make and the results were yummy.  I will be making this again :-)

I changed up the recipe a little as well. I added carrots, frozen corn and frozen Lima beans. I also omitted the onion. Instead of adding extra salt I added about 2 tbls chicken bouillon for extra flavor. We liked it a lot.

My whole family enjoyed this soup and it was easy to make.  The only things I did differently was use canned chicken, carrots that were already sliced I added more noodles.

I have made this several times since saving the recipe.  This is so good, especially on a cold blustery day, it makes you feel all warm and cozy inside!  I don't really change anything unless I am out of an ingredient, it's perfect in my opinion the way it is.  Thank you Corwynn for sharing!

Awesome recipe. I follow instructions for the most part. We used fresh rotisserie chicken as one reviewer suggested. Boiled it for 15-20 minutes in broth. We also added a dash of oregano, dash of rosemary, dash of terragon, and added bisquick dumplings. Turned out amazing!!! :) Everyone went back for seconds! I call that a success!

Great recipe I have made more times than I can remember!!! I know this is suppose to be an easy recipe but, I'm old fashioned along with being budget wise. I buy the 10 lb. bags of chicken leg quarters at Wal Mart ( $5.90 this week) and make my own broth. I refrigerate the broth over night, skim the now hardened fat off and freeze the extra broth in usable amounts.  I also now have lots of chicken meat for this soup and broth and chicken to freeze so I can make soup in a jiffy at a later date.
 
 I use 1/2 the amount of poultry seasoning and no cornstarch as I use Kaluski noodles ( or homemade) which have flour on them.  I also blend the veggies from the broth I made and add to the soup which gives it a wonderful flavor. This soup freezes well.

One of the best soups I have ever made. Instead of broth I used concentrated chicken stock and water. Uses a rotisserie chicken, and added extra carrots. Really helps when you feel sick so I put some extra in the freezer.

Great recipe, everyone wanted seconds.  Followed the advice of many other reviews 1/2 stock reg chicken broth 1/2 low sodium & placed the whole roast chicken for 15 in soup before tearing up.  This is the best chicken soup recipe that I have ever made.

I did as some other reviews recommended and used a rotisserie chicken. AMAZING! I tossed all the ingredients together in a pot with the whole chicken, added carrots and garlic as well.  Boiled the chicken for a while then took it out and and removed the bones and put chicken back in pot.  Made some corn bread to go with it. YUM!

Great soup!  Wasn't sure how necessary the cornstarch and water are, but I added them.  I thought it was a very salty soup, so next time I'd either get a few cans of low sodium chicken broth or cut back on the salt added.

This is a wonderful recipe, especially for busy nights.  Often I will cook the veggies, broth and chicken earlier in the day and then I add the noodles in right before dinner.  I have used this recipe for years but change the order I do things.  First I cook the onions in the oil until they are translucent and then add a couple stalks of celery and 2 carrots ( sometimes more depending on how many are eating that night).  I also add 1 lb chopped up raw chicken (unless I am lucky enough to have a rotisserie chicken which is not often).  After the chicken is cooked through I add 1 carton of chicken broth and 1 tbs of boullion.  I dissolve the cornstarch with 1 cup of water and add that in.  If I have the time I let it simmer for at least an hour to get the chicken tender and the broth to thicken.  Lastly I add the egg noodles 15 minutes before dinner.  I also like to season with pepper.  A family fav!

Good chicken noodle soup!  I used this recipe as a base and added carrots and peas for more flavor and color.  And just for fun, instead of egg noodles, I used Cavatappi, which is a spiral, tube-shaped pasta.  Hubs likes brothy soups, so I didn’t thicken this with any cornstarch.  We enjoyed this, thank you!

This soup was delicious.  I followed the hints that reviewer Susie gave and it was awesome!  I did not add oil, cornstarch, or water.  I basically used the seasonings from the recipe and added in Susie's.  Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time ever making homemade chicken noodle soup - and it was a success! I made a couple small changes. First, I simmered the remains of last nights roast chicken in the broth for an hour. As suggested by other reviewers I added carrots and cooked the noodles directly in the broth! I didn't add any salt or poultry seasoning and it was perfectly seasoned. Delicious!

In all my years I had never tried to make homemade chicken noodle soup until I saw this recipe.  I followed it exactly, and it was wonderful!  I always buy fat-free, low sodium chicken broth, so saltiness was not an issue for me.  It freezes well, but I try to remember to let it thaw on its own so the noodles don't get mushy from excessive additional cooking.  Love it, love it!  Thanks to Corwynn and her grandma!!

Great, easy recipe. I added carrots to the soup and as others have suggested, also put in a rotisserie chicken as well. I made the soup chunkier with more veggies and chicken but did not like the pasta in it. Maybe it was because I used a white, whole grain pasta and it tasted funny, but it tasted a lot better just as chicken soup. I also added 2-3 tbsp of chicken bouillon just to give it more flavor as well as a dash of oregano and basil, 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper to taste. I made it for my bf when he was sick and it was exactly what he had in mind when he thought of chicken noodle soup.

I love this recipe!! It's both easy to make and very tasty. I made this with leftover chicken and frozen broth and it was really good, but when I used a fresh chicken, boiled it, and made the soup in fresh broth it was to die for!!

My husband gave it a 4. He said it needed a little more flavor. I give it a 5 because it doesn't have a dominating flavor. I like it's mild flavor. Everything works well together. It was quick and easy to make. The only thing we changed - we used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. It was a big batch, so I have leftovers to freeze. Will definitely make it again!

My children loved it. I am mexican and we fry the noodles before placing them in the chicken soup. This is definitely healthy and we loved it. This became our favorite soup now.

Delicious!  Made this for my mothers 60th birthday party 7 years ago and I'm still being asked by the guests for the recipe!  I used rotisserie from the grocery store instead!

Of all the different chicken noodle soup recipes, this one is king (or at least archduke). Better with a whole chicken and carrots as others have suggested. I always cook mine with extra love, that usually helps.

Very good.  I will be making this again.  Followed recipe except I added a bayleaf, carrots and pepper.  I didn't have cornstarch so I used a flour and water mixture instead.  I also only added the noodles a few minutes before serving instead of making ahead of time.

very good recipe. the only thing that kept it from getting five stars is the amount of salt and it wasn't clear if I was supposed to use canned chicken broth, chicken bouillan cubes, or "real" broth from cooking a chicken. the salt issue is easily remedied; sample while you are cooking and salt to taste. The cornstarch was a good addition as it thickened the broth just enough (I do this when I make veggie soup too).  Also I added a cup of carrots.

This soup is really terrific.  Easy to make and modify.  The basic recipe needs no modification but if you like to add more veggies (carrots and potatoes work well) you can just toss them in.  This soup is a real kid pleaser and great for lunches.

We make this all the time. This is very simple to make and a huge hit in our family.  I skip a step and just add the noodles in the pot (we have 14 L pot .. I add more broth because I know it will absorb in the noodles)

This really good soup. My only complaint is the amount of salt made this soup wayyy to salty. So I had to add a few cups of water to calm it down a bit. Once I did that it was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had. I will know next time to cut the added salt.

Whipped this one up last night and it was pretty good...I didn't have any poultry seasoning and I made a smaller batch for just the bf and I. He was impressed which is all that counts! Will make again.

A pretty quick, simple, and tasty recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it. Although I did not add the corn starch to thicken, as I personally prefer chicken soup broth to be thinner.

This soup is wonderful!  I took advice from previous reviewers and added carrots, garlic, and peas.  I also boiled and shredded the chicken rather than cubing it, it combines with the soup much better.  All around a great recipe!

This was so yummy - it lasted 3 days and we ate every bit of it! Here's my spin to it: I didn't have the low sodium broth, so I put in 10 cups regular chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I had another carton of broth on hand just in case, but it didn't need it because of the rotisserie chicken made all the difference! If you are going to try this recipe the rotisserie chicken is a must!! I let it simmer for about 25 minutes with the chicken in the pot and then took the chicken out and removed all the meat (left the skin off) and then put it back into the pot for the remainder of the time. Veggies added: carrots, celery, onion and spinach. Will make again and again. Yum!!

I had a family get together and we all brought a soup - I made this and it was gone.  I did do as the some suggested - I put the ENTIRE WHOLE chicken in the pot for 15 minutes and added 2 cloves of garlic, carrots and basil.  There was a person there who is a chef and she loved the soup.

I used this recipe and "Classic Chicken Noodle Soup" and "Fast Chicken Soup Base" to make my own broth. This is what I did: 1. Add 3 frozen chicken breasts with bone and skin in a crockpot with 8 cups of water for 8 hours 2. Add 1 onion, 3 handfuls of baby carrots, 3 stalks of celery, 1/2 tsp of dried thyme leaves, 2 cloves garlic, a dash of dried basil, and some fresh parsley. 3. When the chicken was cooked, about 6 hours later on low, I seperated it from the bone/skin and added frozen peas, pepper, and started cooking the egg noodles in a seperate pot on the stove. 4. I mixed them all together about 30 minutes before serving.

A true winner. I have been making homemade chicken noodle soup for years and this is definitely the best. I made the recipe as indicated but did use others suggestion of adding precooked chicken from the grocery store with it's juices. A true keeper and so easy.

Love this soup! It has become a staple at my house. My only changes are to cook the pasta in the broth since that alleviates the need for corn starch and I add carrots.

Good but in my opinion you can't make chicken soup without carrots and definitely a bay leaf or two. They add the depth of flavor that this is missing.

I made this for my fiance last night because he had a cold. I actually had everything on except the celery. I cut the servings down to 6 and used angel hair pasta instead of the egg noodles. I just broke the pasta into 4 pieces before boiling. This came out nicely and I will definitely make this again.

This soup is great!  I used two boxes of chicken broth and 4 cups of water with some chicken bouillon granules. I also bought a rotisserie chicken from my local supermarket.  This one happen to be greek herb seasoned, which I thought went perfectly with the soup. I also added a little ginger and some pasta seasoning (onion, lemon, pepper, ginger, garlic).  The soup thickened nicely and had great flavor.

Oh yum! I am on a mission this winter to find the best recipe for different types of soups, and I don't need to search further for chicken noodle. This was fabulous - even better the second day after the spices had to mellow a bit. 

I added carrots and a little more chicken than called for - I used an entire store bought rotisserie chicken. 

I'll be making this soup frequently this winter.

WOW!  This is just the chicken noodle soup I have been searching for!  I made my own stock with no salt(medical reasons); from there, I made the soup.  I cut the salt to 1 tsp. (using 6 C. stock) and added a little thyme, garlic powder, and pepper.  I also used carrots in place of half the celery.  The ratio of chicken to noodles to stock was perfect; this is definately going into my permanant files!

Soup was good. I used chicken base, which wasn't as salty as broth from a can and only put 1/2 a T. of salt. 
The poultry seasoning was a bit overpowering, next time I'll use half.
Still, a very good recipe and a heck of a lot better than from a can!

One word SALTY! We're a high salt family and this was way to much for us.  If your making this change the recipe or it's a waste of food.  Good with the changes others made but am rating it the way it's written.  Some of the changes need to be posted as a new recipe.

This was good comfort food.  The only thing I did different was add carrots and halve the amount of chicken broth since I like thicker soups.

Great hearty meal, especially when you're sick. I made it for my husband because he's been feeling so ill lately and he absolutely loves it. I halfed the recipe (since it's just the 2 of us) and made the following revisions: used 1/2 the amount of salt called for (think this should be adjusted depending on how much salt is in the poultry seasoning you choose); baked one large chicken breast with lemon pepper sprinkled on it at 350 until cooked all the way through and then diced up into the soup; substituted leeks for onions (not a big onion fan and prefer leeks for my soups); added same amount of carrots as celery and then sauteed carrots, celery, and leeks in butter prior to adding all other liquid ingredients; omitted cornstarch concoction since we like our chicken soup thin. Wonderful recipe and it makes great leftovers!

I BOILED A WHOLE CHICKEN CUTTING OFF THE FAT TO MAKE THE CHICKEN BROTH.  WE ADDED SPICES BECAUSE IT WAS BLAND.  I EVEN ADDED 2 ONIONS AND GARLIC.  I THINK I SHOULD HAVE ADDED CHICKEN BOULLIION FOR FLAVOR.  I WOULD RATE IT A 2 AFTER I SPICED IT UP IT WAS A 3.

Hands down, the best chicken noodle soup I've made.  Per the advice of other users, I added an entire cooked rotisserie chicken to the broth (along with the drippings from the pan).  After 15 minutes, I removed the chicken, sliced it up and added the meat back in.  My only other additions were 2 diced cloves of garlic, 1 bay leaf and fresh cracked pepper.

This has got to be one of the best soups.  My kids and my husband love it.  I even made it for the marching band and the loved it.  I use a lot of shortcuts such as pre-cooked chicken I cut into small pieces and I cook the noodles with the soup, not before.  I can't tell you how many times I've used this recipe, and will continue to use it.

This recipe is very good, however, I'm only giving it 4 stars rather then 5. I feel that it lacks veggies... But it's a great starter for chicken soup that you can jazz up with your own veggies, depending on your personal preference. I added some frozen sweet peas and fresh spinach. Very tasty indeed!

This recipe was DELICIOUS, but I made a few changes that made it even better. I first omitted the corn starch, and the loose texture was so much better. I also sauteed the chicken before-hand, then put it in the soup with the egg noodles later on. The soup turned out to be fantastic, and my sick boyfriend thought that I had brought him some soup from a restaurant! It's a great recipe.

PS: I used home-made chicken broth, because I had some left over from the other day. But I tried the same recipe with a canned broth, and it was still great!

Sorry to be a damper, but I was not too impressed with this recipe. I cut the salt back to 1 1/2 tsp and it was still way too much (I ended up having to add another 2 cups of water to cut down the saltiness). And how can you have chicken noodle soup without carrots!! Other than adding the carrots and cutting down the salt I didn't change anything. It was OK i suppose, but the leftovers aren't moving too fast so i probably won't be making it again unless I make some major changes... but then that just wouldnt be the same recipe anymore would it!

Read the other reviews and agree this is a great starter recipe. For the chicken I always found it a great idea to buy the whole Rotisserie chickens in the grocery store already seasoned with rosemary and garlic. and cut that up into the soup. It saves so much time and tastes awesome.

A definite make again dish!!!  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli.  I added some sliced carrots (about 1 ½ cups) and a ½ cup frozen corn with ½ cup frozen green beans.  This is the best home-made chicken soup I’ve ever had…even better than the “really home-made” soups that I’ve made.  Thank you!!!!  Loved it!!!!!

This comforting soup filled the house with a delicious aroma as it was cooking! My uncle is the best cook I know, and this tastes just like his homemade chicken noodle soup that I loved as a child. I made a few additions, even though they probably weren't necessary - black pepper, minced garlic, parsley, carrots. This soup is THE BEST!

A very good and easy recipe.  I did do step 3 and you need to let the soup boil again to thicken it up a little bit from the cornstarch.  It is very flavorful!!!

Great for a quick dinner! I took others' suggestions and got a Costco chicken, added a little of the drippings to the broth. I used canned broth- a large can of chicken and 2 small cans of vegetable broth. I left out the salt and put in 1tsp. of poultry seasonings, carrots and celery. I put in a small amnt., of onions for flavoring but I know the kids won't like it w/too much onion. Thank you for sharing Grandma's recipe!

I made this recipe using 5 bouillon cubes and omitted the added salt. I wasn't too pleased, but my husband and daughters enjoyed it very much, next time I think I'll try using actual chicken broth. I found it too....salty, maybe a little less poultry seasoning as well, I could taste it and found it to be a tad to much. But it is super easy and makes good use of left over chicken breasts. very filling!! Also, flavor depends on how fine you chop your celery & onion. I used about 7 celery and a little more than half of a large onion.

Very nice--I shared half with a sick friend and it had a great, homemade look and taste to it.  Like most others I ommited the salt and added carrots, otherwised follwed exactly.  The consistancy of the broth was wonderful.

Great soup... it's easy to make which makes it even better.  I also omitted the salt, but I found that broth was still a  bit too salty.  So, I added a quartered potato to the recipe.  It soaks up the excess salt.  I also added ground peppercorn for some extra flavor.

Great recipe. I totally omitted the salt bc poultry seasoning and broth have enough salt in them.  I also omitted the cornstarch. It's only necessary if you like your broths thick.  I used Maggi chicken cubes and garlic for flavor, and lots of carrots. Came out great! My family loved it.

Great base for my chicken soup. I add carrots and other spices and more noodles, but the broth is the exact consistency I have been looking for without tasting like the thickener. Thank you.

I'd rather open a can of Campbells.  This soup was just so dissapointing.  So plain and drab.  It was like poultry seasoning and water.

This was GREAT SOUP! I made it for my husband when he was sick, and I ate it with him. 
I added about 3 bay leaves. And I used the dark boneless chicken pieces that came packed together. ADD LOTS OF CARROTS AND CELERY!! I wouldn't add any salt either!

Very good Chicken Noodle Soup. I added carrots, doubled the noodles, chicken and celery to make it very thick and filling. A definite winner.

I used 4 regular carrots when I made this soup tonight but didn't use the cornstarch-water to thicken it.  Rather I made 12 cups broth and added 4 cups dry noodles to cook in the broth.  DH said it tasted like wonton soup.  It was good, especially after I added black pepper to my  bowl.  I love soup with black pepper!

We used turkey meat and chicken broth, but I think this is better with either chicken/chicken broth or turkey/turkey broth instead of mixing them.  It was too bland for us at first, but adding some white pepper made a world of difference!  Like other reviewers, we added some chopped carrots, left out the vegetable oil and salt, and next time would reduce the poultry seasoning a little bit.  The cornstarch didn't seem to thicken the soup much, it's still think like normal chicken soup.

Made this last night and it turned out great!  It was first time making homemade chicken noodle soup and it was the best!  The only thing different I did was to add sliced carrots.  I will definately be making this again!

Very good!  I made homemade egg noodles and just added them to the simmered broth.  I also added carrots.  I will definitely make this again!  Just like Grandma's.

I have made this a few times and I am just now writing my review.....EXCELLENT, this soup is so easy to make and absolutly wonderful.  Only thing I do differently is I make sure to use salt free chicken broth otherwise it is a little too salty for our tastes.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!  And it is just like what my Grandmother use to make.  Like the others I added carrots to the soup and I also added some parsley flakes.  I being the salt-a-holic that I am, I didn't think that the recipe called for to much salt.  I also didn't add the corn starch since it tasted so good without it.  I'm going to use the basic recipe minus the noodles when I make Chicken & Dumplings.

Very tasty chicken soup recipe.  I may cut down the salt ever so slightly next time, but I rarely use salt at the table (meaning I don't need table salt for flavor) and I thought the soup was fine.  As others have indicated, the poultry seasoning was a wonderful, distinguished touch.  Seven inches of snow outside doesn't seem so bad after a meal like this!  This soup is everything I expected and more!

I made this one for the first time for work. I cooked my chicken ahead of time and put it all in the crock pot at work a few hours before we were ready to eat it. It was great, everyone loved it. I made it the second time in just 30 mins. or so at home by boiling the chicken first and then adding it cut up to the soup just before serving!! Very good both ways!!!! I also added peas and carrots both times!

This was very tasty and saved me the it-must-be-a-new-ER-tonight-so-all-we-get-is-canned-soup-and-sandwich guilt trip. (never mind what they get the rest of the week) I did add some carrots, peas and parsley.  I used low sodium broth as it has no msg and ended adding about a teaspoon of kosher salt.  Very nice, quick and cozy bowl of soup.  Thanks.

The overall recipe is great. The second time I made it, I added extra noodles to "stretch" the recipe a little further and it did not take away from the soup itself.

This is exactly like my recipe except it calls for poultry seasoning. I used to use thyme. BUT NOT ANYMORE! This substitution made it even better. Thank you so much.

I never thought I'd be ever be able to duplicate my Polish grandfather's homemade chicken soup that I remember growing up but this is it. Boy, did it bring back memories. At the suggestion of other reviews I left out the salt called for in the recipe, the canned broth has enough sodium. And I added 1 cup of diced carrots along with the celery and onion. I even found the perfect noodle just like the kind I remember him using; I found Mueller's Old Fashioned Golden Egg Noodles has a package with a green ribbon on the label that says "FINE" (not the medium or wide noodles.)  This is the BEST RECIPE!  Not only the great memories but my very picky young son actually tried a new food and liked it.  Now that's saying something.

Excellent receipe! As a "spice" variation, my mother-in-law suggested to also add a half of a cinnamon stick and two cloves.  It added an amazing flavor.

Made this tonight for my sick husband and son. Sadly, this recipe was very bland. They both commented that it had no taste, so I had a bowl myself and have to agree. Extremely bland and needs a lot more seasonings. I’ll keep looking for a good chicken noodle soup recipe.

I make the broth from the bones of the chicken I roasted and use chunks of any pieces of the cooked chicken (dark and light)when added to the broth. By using the roasted chicken pieces, more flavor gets added to the soup. If you make a big enough batch, you can easily freeze some for later use

I made this as directed with one small change. I added carrots and cut back on salt. I don’t think it’s fair to add spices and change ingredients completely then give this a bad rating. If the recipe calls for more salt than you think it should have use common sense and cut it back or add a bit and taste. I thought this soup was delicious.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful. It's easy to make and very very good. I always add carrots. Also, if I'm in a hurry, I use frozen grilled chicken. I thaw the chicken and dice it for the soup. Tastes great and super fast.

This recipe is wonderful! I reduced the salt to 1½ tsp and added 1 cup of carrots. Next time I will add more celery and carrots (I might try 1½ -2 cups!) Best chicken noodle soup I've ever had! My husband loved it too! :)

The only changes I made were to add 1/4 teaspoon of poultry seasoning plus 1 hind quarter of chicken for a total of 1 1/4 chicken. I used frozen egg noodles and everything came out perfectly. will definitely make it again

Due to lack of ingredients I left out several items including celery and corn starch, and added carrots instead.  It was delicious and my husband who was sick came back for seconds .

My family loves this soup.  I followed suggestions and used low sodium both mixed with regular.  I also used a chicken from the deli that was roasted.  I added carrots, thyme, chicken poultry seasoning, garlic and pepper.  I served with french bread that was broiled with butter and parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

Excellent!!! My husband ate 2 big bowls full. I had to change 2 ingredients because I just didn't want to go to store on a cold day. I used 1 and 1/2 cups uncooked brown rice and flour verse corn starch. I added uncooked rice then boiled soup for good hour or so. With the flour, in a small saucepan I added 2 cups broth and whisked in 1/3 cup flour til the lumps were gone, then added that to the big saucepan. I will be telling all my friends/family about this recipe. Thank you

I recommend about 25% more veggies, noodles and chicken unless you like a very brothy soup. But very tasty regardless. This feeds me and my wife for about 3-4 bowls so its good for a few meals.

Oh my my my!!!  This is a great recipe!  I've never made chicken noodle soup before so I gave this a try. I seasoned my chicken with season salt and ground mustard for some kick and I kept the juices it cooked in and added it to the broth. I also added chives to the broth and some frozen vegetables. This has been the best soup I've ever had!

Great soup! I baked 2-3 boneless chicken breasts with a little butter, salt, and pepper and cut into bite size pieces. I only used a tbsp of salt in broth, but everyone has different tastes when it comes to salt. I added a cup of carrots to soup also, used a can of cream of chicken to thicken instead of corn starch, and cooked the noodles in my broth about 15 mins before serving. I will definitely make this soup again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I took some of the previous recommendations  for example I did sauté the onion and celery but I used for the first time Amish noodles.  I think the noodles added so much I also added a couple of teaspoons of Glory seasoned chicken base which I think added even more flavor. Thanks to all for sharing!

Great soup! Fed a crowd of 12 and everyone loved it! Made it twice and added fresh mushrooms both times and leftover green beans one time. Both worked great and added flavor and nutrition. Rotisserie chicken made it quick and easy and I used precut carrots to save time as well. Also used low sodium chicken broth and didn't add any other salt.Also added extra garlic. My mom and daughter's boyfriend both asked for the recipe.

Made this last night.  Read a few reviews and followed their suggestions.  Used whole rotisserie chicken and half regular and half low sodium broth.  Also added carrots and garlic.  I'm not good in the kitchen at all and almost never cook, but I found this super easy, fast and practical.  Thanks!

Made this as written, only adding some fresh herbs and a bay leaf while the veggies cooked.  Used some smoked chicken I had in the freezer and added Better Than Boullion base to the noodle cooking water.  Won't cook noodles separately next time.  Hubby had two big bowls and gave it a big thumbs up.  Might try to make it a creamy soup or maybe more stew-like next time.

This is a dead simple recipe to execute. Anyone can do it and achieve superior results. When I have homemade stock available, I will replace 3 cups of broth with stock for an extra kick. Also, I find adding a cup of carrots to the veggies is a wonderful addition. I also love the corn starch step at the end. It really gives the soup some body.

Followed recipe as is.  A little bland for my taste but the kids loved it.  I made extra noodles and had them put aside so those who like more noodles than broth could load up on them.  Whole pot was eaten so in my book, that's at least 4 stars.

For basics, this is fine. I buy no salt chicken broth because broth can be the problem. I used to be one of those moms that cooked the whole chicken, made her own noodles hanging from the chandelier to dry. No MORE.  I bought two boneless chicken breasts for $ 2.58. I won't throw a Rotisserie chicken in soup. Too expensive. Two large chicken broths, no sodium, sauted celery and onion, carrots, fresh basil, a little poultry seasoning, five little garlics and I learned to make my Reames noodles in a different pot. I don't want stew. But that is good too over mashed potatoes. I put pepper in it. I need to see where the salt tastes like before I add any to the pot.  I was going to Panera to get soup but it is too salty so now I am making it myself. $ 13.00 for about 9 bowls of soup. Even if I freeze it, I know it will taste good.  As a side note, I would cook the carrots in a different pot and add those and the juice to the soup. Speeds up the process and then you are not boiling your broth to death. I just taste tested mine and finally added some salt. This is good.

This soup was great! I added, garlic, carrots, cilantro, basil and parsley. I used tapioca starch instead of corn starch and I used emirl's original essence instead of poultry seasoning. Instead of  regular salt, I used black, orange and White Island salt. I did roast my chicken in a crock pot and I added all the juices from that at well.

Definitely could have used some more seasoning, but I thought it was pretty good. My boyfriend said it was his favorite chicken noodle soup (though he was sick as a dog, so he might have said that about anything I served).

Really good basic soup recipe. 
I made dumplings instead of using noodles. Very light, fresh tasting, and warming.
Thanks for sharing!

Didn't change much... just added almost 2 cups of chopped carrots and a bunch of fresh parsley and added 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Perfect for a snow day, or any day!

There is nothing quite like chicken soup when your ill.  My wife has a bad cold so I made her chicken soup using this recipe.  I made my own chicken broth (to control the amount of salt) and made two changes to the recipe; I added a cup of sliced carrots and decreased the amount of salt to one tablespoon. Because the carrots are slower cooking than the other vegetables I added them 10 minutes before the celery and onion, and then continued with the recipe.  We loved it and will make it again.

Let me start out by saying I can't cook.  That said, I prepared this per the recipe instructions (minus the salt) and it turned out great.

Very good recipe! I did alter a bit also. I used 8 cups of unsalted chicken broth and 2 cups of salted, but added about a tablespoon of salt and it was perfect! Used a little less than 1/3 cup of cornstarch due to less chicken broth. I also added a cup of carrots and omitted the onions. I also followed the advice of others with the uncooked egg noodles being added towards the end, once soft, I added the chicken and it was finished. The hubby and I were very satisfied with the outcome. Will make again.

Incorporated a lot of the suggestions, added a few of my own, and then I would say it was a 5-star.  Sauteed the onion and celery along with 3 chopped cloves of garlic and a large chopped carrot in a tablespoon of olive oil.  Then added the chicken broth (low sodium) and no salt.  Simmered an entire store-bought rotisserie chicken (bones, skin, and all), along with the juices,  in the veggies and broth for 15 minutes, then removed the chicken, deboned and deskinned it, shredded the meat, and added the meat back in.  Brought the broth to boiling and added all-wheat noodles in (did not pre boil them).  Followed the rest of the instructions.  Initially this low-salt version soup may need salt or pepper for some folks but it's best to add those to taste when the soup is done, not before.  I prefer to let individuals add their extra seasoning to their bowls, because unless you've got a very large family there are going to be leftovers and once chicken soup sits a while it always has more flavor, and adding salt in the first go-round makes for salty second-day chicken soup.  Also added frozen peas and I would say the corn starch adds a slight thickening but it's not a big deal whether you use it or not.  It is also quite thick with meat and veggies so second-day reheat could benefit from adding another small can or two of chicken stock.  Delish.

I made this for dinner tonight-- you can amend this recipe to your liking. It is a great starting point. I added 6 cups of chicken broth and 6 cups of water. I added the following seasoning: 2 bay leaves, basil, dill, rosemary. I seasoned the chicken breast before cooking and adding. I also added lots of carrots, garlic, and fresh green beans.

Great comfort food! I omitted the celery (I hate that stuff!) and added fresh carrots. I cut the added salt in half and used low sodium chicken broth, and it still tasted plenty salty to me. I also used a rotisserie chicken, and 4 cups egg noodles instead of 2 1/2 cups. I will definitely make this recipe again! Great leftovers too!!

I read many review posts that suggest to cook the noodles in the same pot with the soup. I find it a good idea to cook the noodles separately and then add the noodles separately to each soup portion. I know that if I leave the noodles swimming in the soup, the next day, they are too mushy when I want to have leftovers.

This recipe is a hit in our household. I use my own stock from a whole chicken and make my egg noodles homemade. With the three of those combined it is an amazing dish !! Great for winter and/or if your not feeling so well.

Loved how simple this was. Used store bought rotisserie chicken, which I refrigerated ahead of time. Pulled off the cold meat, threw the leftover bone and skin in cheesecloth and threw all of it into the broth with the veggies. For the broth I just used 12 cups boiling water and 12 tsp chicken bouillon since I didn't have enough canned chicken broth. Also added 1 cup chopped carrot. Left out the salt until the end and added it to taste. Left out the cornstarch altogether. I tried it both ways, with and without, and in the end it tasted too much like canned soup when I added the cornstarch, in my opinion. I seasoned as some others suggested with garlic, pepper, parsley, bay leaves etc. Whatever sounded good. Also, while you could throw the pasta in with the rest of it towards the end, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't plan to eat it all in one sitting. If you try to reheat it, the pasta will have soaked up the broth and gets mushy and you might as well eat canned soup at that point. I use whatever spoon sized pasta I have on hand and it all tastes great either way. Since there are only two of us, I keep the cooked pasta separated and throw it in when I reheat it, so it's not soaking up the broth in the fridge. Very tasty and comforting when you feel a cold coming on, and not too difficult to make when you don't feel well. Thanks!

Great recipe! Perfect for a rainy day, and it's super simple to make. I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving, since we didn't have any chicken in the house. It tasted sooo good! Also, I used spaghetti just because I'm too lazy to go buy egg noodles, and I didn't have any poultry seasoning either. The soup has awesome flavour and I would definitely make it again!!

I love this recipe.  Funny though, the picture has carrots and parsley, but they aren't in the recipe.
I would definitely add these ingredients for more flavor and substance.   I use roasted chicken.  Great for a rainy Fall day.

I was sick yesterday and out of canned stuff so I figured I could attempt making my own. It came out pretty good, but I made substitutions based on what I had...which included a mix of chicken and vegetable broth, some frozen/canned veggies, and canned chicken (my grandmaw gave that to me, I've been wondering what to do with it). I used Italian seasoning, marjoram, and a dash of Tony's Chachere's, and I threw some angel hair pasta in the mix because I don't have egg noodles. Came out good, better than the canned stuff. Hopefully next time I can use a rotisserie chicken though.

Used rotisserie chicken and added carrots.  Have made this easy recipe many times.  If I have vegetables (raw, cooked, or frozen) that need to be used, I will throw them in at the appropriate time to cook.

This is a favorite in my house every winter.  My daughter absolutely loves it, and she's a very picky eater.  Changes I made per reviewers-I always use a rotisserie chicken from Walmart or Publix.  I put the whole chicken in the pot with all of the ingredients and then once I have a good boil going, I take the chicken out and debone it and remove the skin. Saves a lot of time and adds a lot of flavor. Thanks for posting this.

I've also always used a rotisserie chicken and boiled that with water and chicken stock for about twenty min or so and add bay leaves but my grandma always uses about a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half of marjoram to the soup for extra flavor but with a few extra ingriedients this recipe a five star soup

I am on a fixed income as so many of us are. The first thing I do is cut the recipe down to 2 serving. If it isn't to my liking I haven't lost that much I used as recommended and I am NOT a salt person by any means. Using low sodium is always a good choice. I thought it was VERY GOOD and I will make again

I really liked this. I used a rotisserie chick, shredded all the meat and set side. I simmered the carcass in the broth for a while, removed it and followed the recipe but added 5 carrots sliced and added the noodles directly to the soup at the end. I loved the satiny  consistency of the broth as opposed to watery. There is plenty in the freezer but I would definitely make this again in the future. Thanks for sharing!

High five.  Very nice.  I wasn't sure about the cornstarch, but as another review stated, it added a velvety texture to the soup.  Very rich.  Adjust the salt to taste.  And, of course, add whatever veggies you want.  I personally like a hearty-style soup with corn, peas, green beans & carrots.  Will definitely make it again.

Fantastic... I added a can of cream of chicken and didn't add the celery (my family doesn't like celery). It vanished from the pot! YUM!

The most delicious chicken soup I've ever had. If you are planning on freezing it for later, I would recommend using a heartier noodle than the egg noodle.

Such a great recipe! I followed others suggestions though and I think that really made the difference in how it turned out. I used a rotisserie chicken and boiled it in half low sodium half regular chicken broth for 15 minutes with the carrots. While I was taking apart the chicken I added a chicken bouillon cube, noodles and the seasonings. I added Thyme (must have!)basil and oregano. I suggest adding the salt and pepper towards the end and to taste so that  you don't end up over salting like so many others who have made this soup. 
My husband had 3 bowls so it will definitely be made over and over again in this house!

Good idea, but cut out the salt and the corn starch and dice a clove of garlic and add a cup of chopped carrots instead of egg noodles I used brown rice.. Yummy

This is a fantastic base recipe.  I didn't have chicken broth, but I did have 2 leftover chicken frames in the freezer, so I covered those with water & let cook for about 1/2 an hour.  Out they came... I measured 13 c of broth... close enough to the recipe...& took the meat off the bones.  Chicken & broth out of one step! YAY!  The rest of the recipe I followed from there including the amount of salt suggested (no salt when cooking down the bones).  I doubled the noodles after I added the first batch to the broth...I think there should have been more... but mine were whole wheat, so that might have been the issue... and added 1/2 c carrots to the vegs when I started them to cook because I thought that would look nice.  The only thing I didn't do was mix in the cornstarch... the noodles were going to be sitting awhile in the soup on the stove & I figured they would give off enough starch to thicken the broth. It is simmering on the stove right now & the house smells heavenly. As an aside, once the WW noodles have been sitting in the broth, they have expanded greatly... so I probably could have done without the extra noodles!

Hello, I tried this its great, but you can also cook the pasta right in with the soup, makes a fuller base that way, I made it with alphabet pasta this time, easier to eat at work !! but love the wide noodles the best !! Also, smoked chicken is a good idea  too !! you can add just a drop or two of liquid smoke to your chicken sauté for a min. throw it in there !! wow !!

This is my second time making this recipe and me and my family really love it!  Instead of adding cornstarch to thicken I add heavy cream, it doesn't make it thicker just creamer ( got this from Paula Deens "Lady and Sons Chicken noodle soup") this is a keeper. Even though picture has carrots its doesn't say so in recipe but I add them anyway along with mushrooms...absolutely delicious!!

I've been craving chicken noodle soup lately but I didn't want to eat the processed Ramon noodles that are so incredibly unhealthy. So I thought it would be nice to make it from scratch for once.I found this recipe and it had great reviews so I thought I'd try it. And I'm so glad I did!!! I thought it so delicious and it had so much taste! I followed other user's suggestions and added peas and chopped carrots. I also included a little garlic and a couple basil leaves. Sooo good. This will definitely be my go to recipe!

I  required a little more spice. Otherwise this was delicious. This is so good on a cold day. Also, this is my go-to soup for anyone who is sick with a cold.

Instead of using a cornstarch slurry, I used a couple tablespoons flour and threw in a couple tablespoons butter and I cooked the flour/butter until brown, then added in the chicken broth. I added in some fresh ground pepper, too. This was a quick and very basic chicken noodle soup recipe that my family enjoyed.

Wonderful and easy recipe, will make again.  I did have celery, only it was too far gone so decided to use some celery flakes that were in the spice cabinet.  Let's just say that since it was close to St Patrick's Day it was jokingly referred to as Irish Chicken Soup!

I wonder why all you reviewers bother to post under this recipe at all if you are going to change the entire thing. Why not just post your own recipe separately and leave this one alone? Now, there's a thought ;)
Review: I do not think this recipe is too salty. BUT I used homemade broth(no salt) and pressure cooked boneless chicken(again no salt ..as there is in store bought rotisserie chicken).

This soup was really good.  However, I did make a few small changes to it -- cooked 3 boneless chicken breast in the oven.  Shredded the meat and added it to the pot with the onions, celery, carrots, poultry seasoning and 7 cans (15oz) low sodium chicken broth.  Brought that to a boil and added the uncooked noodles.  After they were cooked, added 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to 1/4 c of the broth from the pot.  Mixed that up and added back to the boiling soup.  Let that cook for a bit.  I didn't add any salt while cooking and added parsley at the end.

Loved this recipe!!  I added carrots to the recipe and just used water and Penzeys chicken broth base.  Boiled and shredded 3 chicken breasts and only used 1/2 tsp of salt.  Also did not use any vegetable oil.  My husband and 3 kids all loved it!!

I followed the suggestions from other reviews; simmered an entire rotisserie chicken for 20 mins, and used only a slight sprinkling of salt.  I'm not a huge fan of salt, and I agree that this recipe calls for an excess quantity of it.  With the modifications, this soup is great!

I boiled the noodles in 12 cups of water, removed them with a slotted spoon, and then used the same pasta water to boil a chicken with chunks of celery, carrots, onion, and garlic for 1 1/2 hr. I removed the chicken to cool, then strained the water to use as a base for my chicken broth. I then proceeded to follow the recipe as written, using only 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (my preference), adding carrots, and adjusting the salt to taste. I only had medium noodles, but felt wide noodles would have held up better. This is a true classic, comforting  soup that has now become my go-to chicken noodle soup!

I am not a good cook by any means, however, this recipe was very simple to follow and the outcome was wonderful.   My picky preschoolers begged for dinner early and asked for me to make more for tomorrow's dinner.  

The changes I made were simply due to what I had available:   12 boulion cubes to make the broth and minus the poultry seasoning. 

 I baked chicken earlier in the day and pulled it.  I used garlic powder,paprika,S&P.

I will definitely be making this more often!

I did things a little differently. I didn't cook the noodle ahead of time as that would be silly. Sauteed the onion, celery and carrots in a pot with butter, poured in the chicken broth, had the chicken cooking in a separate pot. Once the broth was boiling I added the egg noodles, and began chopping the chicken into small cubes. Added that and some poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. I let it simmer for about 20 minutes while I made some grilled cheese to go along with it. Came out great! Hubby was happy and we had left over soup for lunch the next day :)

Finally found a chicken noodle soup that the whole family (including 4 kids aged 5-9) like.  I left out the onion since not all the kids like it and took the suggestion of other reviewers to put in a whole Rotisserie chicken for 15 minutes (then pulled it out, chopped up the chicken and added it back to the soup).  Used extra wide homestyle egg noodles.  For broth, in order to cut back on sodium and spend less money, I only bought 2 containers of broth - one regular and one low sodium.  That was about 7 cups.  For the remaining 5 cups, I just added water.  I left out the extra salt called for in the recipe until the end.  After boiling the noodles directly in the soup, I taste tested and added just 1/2 tsp more salt, and it was plenty salty for us.

LOVE IT!!!  I tweeked it a little bit - I LOVE chunky soups with lots of veggies, so I used FOUR cups celery, 2 or 3 cups shredded carrots, and 2 cups onion, as well as 3 cloves of garlic.  I used only FOUR cups Chicken Broth from a box, TWO cups of drippings (I crock pot roasted the chicken and used the drippings), and four cups water.  When much of the liquid boiled down, I added one to two more cups of water.  It took about 30 mins to get all of the extra veggies soft.  Then I added 1 can of CREAM OF CHICKEN soup with another cup of water instead of the starch/water mixture.  Added chicken and noodles and let simmer.  I only used 1 1/2 tsp of salt (as others suggested) and I added black pepper for a kick.  DELICIOUS !!!

Used a rotisserie chicken and low-sodium broth, cooked the noodles in the pot, and turned out great!

This was just what Dr. Mom ordered!  I had everything on hand and made it in a jiffy for my son who just had surgery.  The only thing different that I did was add a can of Cream of Celery soup.

This is excellent! I used rotisserie chicken and had exactly the amount needed. I would probably only do half a tsp of poultry seasoning or none at all, if I had to change anything. I don't really care for my noodle soups to be too herby. Overall, excellent!

Excellent, excellent. Everyone loved this and we ate leftovers for two days! My only change was that I did not inlude the cornstarch as I didn't want the thicker consistency.

Very tasty recipe. I made a few adjustments to the recipe though. I added a little more celery and onion and also added carrots. I didn't have poultry seasoning on hand, so I used Old Bay seasoning instead. I also added a little parsley and more salt to taste. I would definitely make this again!

I think this soup is hearty and very tasty.  My young children love it.  Make up a big pot...eat a few bowls and freeze the rest into meal size containers for future use.  Freezes well.

I brought home a rotisserie chicken on a night I didn't feel like cooking and on a whim decided to make soup with the leftovers. After browsing through some recipes, I chose this one. I am glad I did. It is delicious, though like others I made some changes. The ones I most commonly see are the use of low-sodium broth and the addition of carrots (of course! gotta have carrots!). The salt like everyone said was a lot. I used about 1 tsp last time as I halved the recipe and this time I skipped it altogether as I chose to use half a packet of lipton soup mix in lieu of chopping an onion. Yum!

One great soup!  I did agree with the lady with the Italian method.  Make your own broth boiling the chicken in water, with your spices---take out chicken when tender, shred, then put in the noodles and veggies so they soak up that flavor.  I added broccali and half a bag of slaw cabbage to Grandma's original recipe w/o sauteing any of the veggies.  Put the chicken back in at the end.  Yum!

Great, simple, easy to make chicken noodle soup.  Omit salt, add carrots, use a whole rotisserie chicken and you're good to go.

I am thankful I read the comments before making this. I went the easy way and bought a rotisserie chicken. I boiled it down for about 20-30 minutes to create my own stock. It was a hit. Very easy recipe.

I'm sad to admit it but I am a 26 year old woman that has very little cooking experience. Married for a few years and the hubbys burnt out on cooking.  This recipie was my first attempt at soup. I was without a dought the most delicious chicken noodle.  I made a few changes, omitted onions added carrots. Only used ten cups of broth, no addiaianl salt needed. Used 3 shakes of poultry seasoning. A helpful hint I used was to throw in the noodles 15 min before service. No need to boil/cook prior. My hubby said it was the best homemade soup ever!! Not bad for the first attempt!!

Didn't give it 5 because a few changes were made. My husband made this recipe for me a couple of days ago when I had a stomach bug. He used some of the advice from reviewers such as adding carrots, and used all reduced sodium broth. It was plenty salty & was unbelievably amazing tasting! i can't say enough about it. I couldn't believe how good it was. He doesn't eat soup & I had never made it. He loved it, I loved it & my 3 & 5 year old kids gobbled it up! Not that's saying something!

This was a great basic chicken noodle soup! The only thing I did different was add carrots.  I didn't find it too salty at all, in fact everyone added salt at the table, and we're not big salters. A little bland, but most chicken soups are.  Would be great with dumplings too!

Grandma knew what she was doing!  The poultry seasoning gives it a great flavour.  The first time I made it, I cut back on the salt (I was a little leery), but then had to add some chicken soup base.  The second time, I didn't even add chicken; it was fantastic just with noodles (I used chinese noodles) and the veggies.  Super easy and super tasty.

I used homemade chicken broth and added carrots, and it was delicious!  The liquid turned out a little thicker than I like after the cornstarch step. So next time I make this I will skip the cornstarch.

I fixed this one night because I was wanting chicken noodle soup.  Wow, was I surprised.  This is a terrific soup.  Again, as with the other soup, my family loved it, including my picky son.  I froze what was leftover and will be having it soon.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made it as veggie noodle soup instead, substituting cubed tofu for chicken and veggie broth for chicken broth.  Delicious.

Thought it was wonderful.  I used half low salt broth half regular. and no added salt  Added carrots and no cornstarch.  I cooked Kluski directly in soup.

This was good. I did add carrots to mine and a can of cream corn.  If others are saying they didn't care of it much or didn't like it then they just don't like traditional chicken noodle soup. This will takes like traditional Chicken soup.  Which I like so thats why I gave it a five.

It is cold outside so we wanted warm, comfort food. What better than Chicken Noodle soup,  and this was perfect. I really wanted to rate it 4&1/2stars but could not figure out how to do a 1/2 star. (not good with a computer)  I followed the reviews (adding whole chicken for 15 minutes with the veggies) I also added carrots , peas, fresh basil, etc. And, my husband likes lots of noodles so I added a touch more. Great comfort food!!

Do NOT put in any salt until after all is said and done and tasted. WAY too much! I even cut it down and it was too salty. Was pretty good otherwise.

Yum! I didn't change much other than I didn't have poultry seasoning so used some thyme, rosemary, sage, crushed oregano, and parsley instead. I'll definitely make this soup again.

This was an amazing soup!  I prepared as indicated with the addition of sliced carrots.  Yummy!  The only change I will be making in the future is to use less salt.  My family loved this and I will be adding  it to my recipe rotation.  Thanks, Grandma!

Very easy, I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used some sage and plenty of pepper. It turned out amazing. I also didn't have egg noodles and subbed about 3/4 cup of elbow noodles.

This soup is simply delicious. With the help of an earlier review, I added carrots to the soup and used low sodium chicken broth. The corn starch gives the soup perfect consistency. I also added Parsley to the soup. Perfect way to end a cold windy day with a big bowl of this chicken noodle soup and crackers.

This is a great Chicken Noodle recipe! I followed other suggestions such as simmering the whole chicken for about 15 minutes, adding carrots and bay leaves, and it turned out excellent.

This was good for a quick soup.  I added carrots, used all low-sodium chicken broth, all the meat from a rotisserie chicken and 4 cups of noodles for a heartier soup.  I'm sure we'll make this again.

I made this recipe, and it did get very good reviews from my family.  There were, however, a couple of things that I changed:  I used the suggestion in previous reviews, and went with the whole rotisserie chicken.  I dropped that into the broth, and let it cook for about 15 mins.  I would let it go for even longer next time, more like 45 mins.  Also, I used all reduced sodium broth.  I prefer to season as I go, and using reduced sodium allows me to salt to my liking.  We added more celery and carrots to the pot than recommended, as well as potatoes and just half a chopped onion (we like mucho veggies).  I used just the meat from the rotisserie, and added it just before eating.  The two breasts and what was left of the dark meat was more than enough for our soups for the next couple of days.  Also, I recommend cooking the noodles (we use broad No Yolks noodles) and add them at the same time as the chicken.  This way, you avoid gritty or mushy noodles.  No one likes a mushy noodle!  This was a great base recipe, and I definately will make it again.

This was a good soup,I made a few changes,I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I used a chicken bouillon cube,didn't use celery,had a half yellow bell pepper,had 3 cups of homemade chicken broth then used can for the rest and I cut down on the salt! sounded way to much for me but it still tasted too salty and I also put in a capful of liquid smoke. Very good recipe.

I love this recipe and highly recommend it! It's so easy but tastes like my mom's cooked all day version. The only modification I made was to use garlic sea salt instead of regular salt. It give the soup great flavor.

I cut the salt by half, and added an 1/8 of a tsp of pepper.  Next time I will definately add carrot slices.  I have been searching for a classic chicken noodle soup like this for years, and will be making this recipe from now on. Quick, delicious, and by far the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Excellent, although I usually add more vegetables.  Also, be undercook the noodles when boiling them, because they will cook more in the soup stock.

One of the best chicken noodle soups I've ever had. Only change was to add frozen carrots & peas during simmering stage. Threw noodles in to broth straight from the package. Did not add much salt as the broth had enough. Found that I had to add broth to get more liquid.

Turned out great.  I cooked 5 chicken breasts with bones and skin in the slow cooker for 4 hours.  Then I chopped up one onion sauteed it in 1/4 cup butter, added one clove garlic minced, two stalks of celery, and 4 cups of carrots..then added 12 cups chicken broth and some of the drippings from the slow cooker.  When it came to a boil I added 12 oz dry egg noodles and after about 6 minutes added a bag of thawed peas and the chopped up chicken.  I actually forgot about the cornstarch...I thought this turned out great, especially for the amount of effort.  It could use some tweaking, so I will play around with it a bit more to make it perfect.  But as it stands this recipe was REALLY good.

I tweaked it a bit: Used a rotisserie chicken, used half low sodium half regular chicken broth, and did not use corn starch. This was my first attempt at making chicken noodle soup It was delicious and my boyfriend loved it, and he doesn't usually like chicken noodle soup!

This was great chicken soup for the 7-year-old's soul (and mom's and dad's too!!). My little boy came home not feeling so great, and this yummy soup seemed to hit the spot! I added fresh ground pepper, Tony Chachere's (I'm a Louisiana girl ... I add Tony's to everything!!), 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies and 2 cups of frozen okra.

This recipe is a good start.  I used whole wheat wide egg noodles, large dash of black pepper, low sodium chicken broth, and 1 cup thinly sliced carrots. 
Also boiled un-cooked chicken in water for 25-40 min (length depending on how thick the chicken is) After chicken is cool shred and add to soup to warm.

This was a very flavorful soup recipe without all the work. We'll be eating this regularly & I'm using this in my neighborhood soup exchange.  My changes were: added 1 cup chopped carrots, used a rotisserie chicken & added all the drippings into the broth, added 1 TBS of Spice Island's Savory Blend spice mix (I got it at Sam's & can't live without it!), added 1 cup more noodles for my 2 & 5 year old kids.  Great flavor. Easy & fast prep. Smiling faces at dinner. What more can you ask for?

This is very good. Like other reviewers, I used a rotisserie chicken, added carrots, garlic with the onions and celery and let the whole chicken simmer with the veggies awhile before I shredded the chicken. I also added a bit of basil, parsley and black pepper. I did not add any salt and it was perfect (and I'm a salt lover!). Will make again.

VERY tasty. I did this over the course of a few hours. I added ingredients and raw chicken pieces. I let it simmer for about 4 hours, then I added a lot of noodles and no corn starch. It was surprising flavorful and yummy!

Tried to make according to the recipe but found it kinda bland.  So I added some chicken bouillon, some sliced garlic cloves, a little sage and pepper.  Came out great.

I didn't care for this. It's okay for a cheap meal, next time I will use more seasonings. I cut down on the amount of salt and glad I did.

I used the rotissaire chicken, added carrots, dumpling style egg noodles and did not add salt as I couldnt find low sodium broth in the large cans. I did add the whole chicken to the broth with the veggies to let it get some more flavor. It turned out great!

I forgot to add the corn starch, and it still turned out good!  The reccommendations to add a rotissere chicken and to salt to taste were great.  My husband said it reminded him of his grandma's soup!  No more canned soups for me, thank you!

I followed this exactly. We didn't care for it. Maybe the broth you start with makes it good or bad. All I could taste was salt and poultry seasoning. Sorry.

Not a big soup fan, but this was very tasty. It makes a ton! :) My suggestion though, throw in some extra veggies like corn, peas, carrots, make it extra hearty.

I took the advice of other posts and did not bother to add any salt during the cooking process. Only at the end. This soup turned out to be way too bland for me. Maybe I have been eating to much spicy Mexican soups lately, but I had to do a lot of doctoring to get this to have flavor.

I added some pepper. It was way too salty. I couldnt even finish a bowl. I may try it again without the added salt and with reduced sodium broth.

This was a great recipe, and I made just a few changes.  On the 12 serving instead of using 12 cups chicken broth, I used 8 with 4 cups water.  I only used 1 tablespoon salt, and added some garlic powder.  My husband loved it!

We thought this was quite bland for our taste.  I added some garlic and Cavender's Greek Seasoning and that helped.  I would suggest to taste this before adding any salt then salt to taste.  Adding the cornstarch made this different but I don't think I will add it again, I just prefer is soupy.

Per previous reviews, I sauted vegetables, and added carrot as well. Boiled some of the rotisserie chicken breifly with broth, and added can of cream of chicken soup for thickening. With no salt added, this was still salty. Next time will purchase low sodium broth. Just added the uncooked noodles at the end. Still enjoyed the soup, and will make again.

I made this for my mother-in-law who's been under the weather.  I boiled up some chicken thighs and legs the night before, then removed skin and deboned and put chicken in the fridge.  Next day I put the chicken and seasonings along with onion, carrots and celery in crockpot and let cook for 7 hours till I came home from work.  I cooked wide egg noodles till done and threw in crockpot for about an hour to let the flavors blend.  She loved it.  Thanks for the post.

I just made this for dinner the other night.  I used canned white chicken meat and canned chicken broth.  Even though I usually do everything from scratch, my husband raved about how good this was!  Will make this on busy nights-it doesn't take long to throw this together.

My under-the-weather daughter loved this for dinner tonight. I scaled the recipe down to 6. Just the right amount of salt. I added some carrots and sauteed the veggies and the ckicken. Very good. Much better than the canned stuff where you can hardly find any chicken!

This recipe is amazing - a great comfort food! I've made this a few times for myself and friends when feeling under the weather and it's been such a good pick-me up. Everyone always says this is the best chicken noodle soup they've ever had - better than their own mom's! I've always used chicken breast or tender meat, but I think next time I'll try using chicken right off the bone for more tender meat.

Sensational- using hommade broth from chicken, i put in all the salt called for and it was great.  The noodles ended up being very overcooked (i will not precook them next time).  I also added peas, carrots and lots of onions.  A great keeper.

I made a few changes in this recipe.  I scaled it down to six servings.  I increased the broth...we like brothy soups.  I omitted the chopped onion, added a little dry minced onion and added a couple of carrots.  Used 4 chicken breasts from my local grocery stores deli.  I needed a bit more cornstarch to achieve desired consistancy.  I also used the egg noodles from the freezer section of the grocery store.  They tasted homemade and really made the soup.  Will definately make again.

I added sliced carrots, more chicken and more noodles.  I also sauted the onions in olive oil and then added the broth, etc.  My husband (who is a soup nut!) said this was the best chicken noodle soup he has ever had.

The best chicken noodle soup I've ever had. I used homemade broth and one can of canned chicken broth. I added salt to taste, after reading other reviews. I also decided not to use 12 cups of broth. I used about 10 and no corn starch was needed. I cooked the noodles in the soup, and used left over Thanksgiving turkey for the meat. I also added carrots and increased cook time to 1 1/2 hrs. Thanks for the recipe Carrie!!!

Great recipe used the rotisserie chicken and let it simmer in the pot with the chicken broth and it gave the chicken a lot of flavor as well as the broth. I put in baby carrots instead of celery.But I steamed the carrots and onions not all the way just so they wouldn't be crunchy when the soup was done. Turned out great it was done in about an hour with prep time and everything will make this recipe again. (plus I was sick so it was great on my throat)

I was not too impressed with my first try.  I was in a hurry and forgot the poultry seasoning.  I also used dark meat because I had some already cooked.  I also used cheep noodles and they fell apart.  I will have to try again using good ingredients.

Good. Didn't cook noodles separately- added to broth after 5 minutes of simmering. Used 1 T. salt, 4 c. of chicken., & added 1 c. sliced carrots in with the celery, onion.

This is what I crave when I'm wanting comforting soup!  
Definitely omit the salt, but do add chopped carrots. I've also added garlic because I like that flavor. I completely skip the thickening step because I prefer a broth-style chicken soup. The high quality canned chicken sold by Costco is an easy way to handle the chicken when you need a shortcut--you don't even need to drain it.
We eat up every little drop when I serve this soup. It's fun to deliver it to friends who are feeling under the weather, if you have the time.

Although I changed it slightly, this recipe is a keeper for sure!  I added 3/4 cup of onion and celery, and then also added the same amount of sliced baby carrots.  I also followed the advice of others and reduced the poultry seasoning to 1/2 tsp.  I didn't add the cornstarch at the end because it was SO good just the way it was!!  We live in Rhode Island and it snowed all
day...having this recipe saved us.

We loved this recipe - I usually added more veggies to my soup, but the celery with onion was very flavorful, yet refreshing.  It is my favorite!

This soup was wonderful!  However, I used all the meat off a 4 lb chicken that I seasoned with a bunch of herbs while cooking.  I also added carrots and a lot more celery.  It was very salty, so I'd recommend using your own chicken stock, or not using as much salt as the recipe calls for.

Big hit with my husband.  Perfect for cold days and the sniffles.  I used store bought frozen egg noodles (cooked them in the soup) and roasted chicken.  Served with a couple of pillsbury cheddar and garlic frozen biscuits.  Couldn't be easier!

This was the best chicken soup I've made.  Friends and husband loved it.  I thought it tasted a bit too "green" and will probably reduce the amount of poultry seasoning next time.  I used the Kitchen Basics REAL chicken stock, too.  This is a keeper.

This was a wonderful soup I made it for a fall birthday party and everyone at it all up. I did make a slight adjustment I browned the chicken in olive oil and coated the breasts in powdered onion pepper and salt, I also omitted the water and cornstarch in the end I dont like thick soups

I used two cloves of fresh garlic (instead of the powder) and this dressing was fabulous.  My three young kids ate the entire salad.  It is an excellent recipe!

I use home-made broth and omit the oil. Otherwise, I follow the recipe closely. (I only prepared 6 serves.) It tastes good, if you like the sage taste. I am not sure if that's caused by the blend of the poultry seasoning I got from a local grocery store (Bi-Lo).

This is comfort food at its best. Home-made broth, some mushroom slices, and seasoning to taste made it absolutely perfect. My father-in-law walked into the house and asked what smelled so good. I'll make this again. I think I'll try dumplings like other reviewers.

This soup was hearty and comforting.  However, I do not know if it is because I have never really had homemade soup, or if canned soup (Progresso, for example) as gotten better, but it kinda tasted like a lot of store bought soup.  I think the "idea" that it is homemade makes the soup that much better. Still good, and a nice gesture to let someone who is sick know that you made it yourself for them.

Great Tasting, very savory and fairly easy to make.  Cooking the noodles separately and then later adding the corn starch seemed to defeat the purpose of .... why not just add the noodles in at the beginning and cook with the broth and vegetables.   I added carrots for taste and color and next time I would cut the salt in half.  In any event it was DELICIOUS!

I made this with homemade stock and smoked chicken.  The results were super!  The poultry seasoning gives the soup richness, and the cornstarch gives the broth some substance.  This will be a standby in my home for years to come.

Great chicken noodle for sure. WAY too salty. Highly recommend using half low sodium broth. I also added carrots because that makes sense to me.

Excellent base recipe which you can add or delete items if you like. Poultry seasoning is a must! I added frozen peas and carrots to make it more hearty but left out the cornstarch and as I didn’t see a reason for it. I also left out the onion as we don’t prefer onion in our chicken soup. This is a keeper.

Added carrots, garlic, oregano, touch of hot sauce,  and  a bay leaf. Used rotisserie chicken and low sodium broth, cooked the noodles with the soup. Extra salt was not needed. 4.5 stars after changes.

Made this with many changes-I didn’t use oil, poultry seasoning or cornstarch.  I purchased one 32 oz broth box, used it all and incorporated equal parts water. Followed the cooking instructions as listed with the omissions above and also used a rotisserie chicken vs cooking fresh chicken.  The taste was spot on, not too salty, just right. I think I took the fuss out of it and my family loved it.  These leftovers are delicious too.

This is my go-to chicken noodle recipe. Sometimes I'll add in a dash of poultry seasoning for taste. I found that using low sodium chicken broth made it bland, so switched back to regular. So hearty and comforting!

Excellent, and so easy! Took the advice of other reviewers and used half low-sodium broth and didn’t add any additional salt. Put whole rotisserie chicken in with veggies and let simmer for 15 mins. Took it out and cut off chicken and put back into soup. Put raw noodles in last 15 minutes. So good! Next time I’ll add an extra can of broth as it came out very hearty, but could have used just a little more broth.

Made 8 cups with 5 cubes chicken stock. Added cubes potatoes (precooked), roasted chicken breasts with skin, pepper, cubed carrots, sliced celery, and sliced green onions. Used thin egg noodles, so they do not need to be precooked. No need to add additional salt. Delicious!

It was a very good recipe and tasted great.  It is a bit salty so if you are sensitive to salt or need to keep salt to a minimum you could easily reduce the salt used.

I also used two stalks of celery and two carrots instead of one cup of just celery.

Soup was easy to make and tasty enough that my husband and I both loved it. I served this with seasoned crackers. I used chicken thighs. Dark meat seems to have a bit more flavor when making soup. I will make this again.

Wonderful recipe!  I added some minced garlic, a bag of frozen crinkle cut carrots (no fresh on hand), and bay leaf.  I did end up using a smidge more of the corn starch mixture to account for the water in the frozen carrots.  Next time I will use advice from some reviewers and get a whole rotisserie chicken.  As it was, I just sautéed some chicken cutlets in olive oil and diced. Makes a lot and your house will smell wonderful!

This was tasty! Like others had said this is a great base for your creativity. Tune it to your preferences. I made this for my husband who was super sick and we both love chunky chunks of chicken so I cut up about 6 chicken breasts and browned those with a tiny bit of olive oil and barley seasoned it with Vegeta seasoning. (i don't really measure my spices, just eye ball it) Set that aside. I did make my noodles separate cause #1 I don't like the way it alters the taste of the soup #2 I didn't want it to soak up the organic chicken broth.  Set that aside. Sauted a large onion, about 2 cups of celery and like 6 cloves of garlic in a tiny bit of olive oil. Set that aside. Then I brought the 12 cups of chicken broth and poultry seasoning to a boil, then added the sauted goodness and threw in some chopped up green onions and let it simmer til the celery was soft about 20 min. Then I threw in the chicken and noodles, along with some turmeric and a few pinches of salt and it came out pretty good. Once I had it in my bowl I put in some cayenne pepper to give it some kick and a little bit more salt and it was very tasty! Excited to make another batch and see how it turns out!

As the recipe is written, this is WAY too salty. It tastes like the canned chicken noodle soup. I'm not giving a five star review AFTER the changes I made - just grading it on how it was written.

Outstanding!  We used all organic ingredients, and chicken bone broth instead of regular broth.  Only real change to recipe was to add some black pepper.  Beats the pants off any chicken soup noodle soup I’ve had!

This soup was delicious! Per some of the reviews, I used 2   32 oz cans of regular chicken broth and 1 32 oz can reduced sodium broth and it was salty enough. Also cooked the egg noodles separately in case I wanted to freeze the soup. I sautéed the onions and celery first in some garlic before adding to the broth and also added 1 cup diced carrots. For the chicken, I put in a whole rotisserie chicken  in the broth for 15 min, removed, shredded and then added back into the soup. Such a nice flavor! Will definitely make again!

On flavor I’d give this a 3, but liked how quick and easy this was.  Good ideas to use low-sodium broth as oftentimes chicken soup can be extremely salty.  Definitely add the carrots and some additional seasoning, otherwise it’s a bit bland

Like anyone, I made some changes.  I added fresh mushrooms, chopped carrots and chopped potatoes. Then I added minced garlic, Italian seasoning and a dash of Red pepper flakes because I can.
 For the chicken I used a whole Rotisserie chicken in pieces. About 4 cups.
Again I wish All Recipes would use the right picture. They put their own in many times.

- used shredded rotisserie chicken from the store
- almost doubled the poultry seasoning
- no added salt
- put the uncooked noodles in the soup for the last 15 min. of cooking. I added a cup more noodles (I like lots of noodles)
- sautéed carrots, celery, and onion in 3 tbsp of butter and chopped garlic before adding broth.
- added fresh chopped basil

LOVED it!!! My changes were only because I didn't want to run to the store at last minute because we have a sick one home.  I did a full package of organic chicken broth (not 12 cups),  1/2 onion,  2 carrots, 2 celery, no poultry seasoning, approx tablespoon of corn starch in a little water to dissolve and rinsed off 3/4 C. of dry Orzo pasta, placed in broth mix, brought to boil, then let it simmer for the remaining 15-20 minutes until orzo was just soft enough.  That was just enough for 2 big bowls of soup.

I substituted with potato starch, and added cut up pork strips and a carrot. I also have gluten free pasta, so I cooked a cup separately and poured the soup on top.
It's exquisite. You could definitely can eat this several times without becoming fed up.

This was delicious!!! Definitely my go to from now on. The only things I changed was that I used the homestyle egg noodles from the frozen section (I have always loved Bob Evans chicken noodle soup, and they use the same type of noodles and I just can’t compromise with using any other kind) and I added a cup of diced carrots with the celery and onion. My picky 2 year old will lick the bowl clean when I make this, which is always a win!!

I had to make a few changes bc of what I had on hand. I didn’t have poultry seasoning so I used seasoned salt instead. I also only used 8c of broth instead of 12c, so it’s a thicker soup. I did not add any additional salt! An extra tablespoon and a half is crazy in my opinion (why I gave it 4 stars - that nasty).  But if you like salt then make the soup and add whatever amount you want at the end if it needs it. I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Followed other reviewers' advice and added a whole rotisserie chicken.  It was good, but could have used a bit more cooking time.  Also, I used reduced sodium chicken broth and left out salt, but ended up adding a bit of salt at the end.  Overall, this was a very good soup, although I would have liked more broth.

I read the previous reviews and incorporated many of those suggestions, especially adding the rotisserie chicken, low-sodium broth, garlic and carrots. It was yummy! I liked it a lot and it took much less time than the previous recipe I've been using. My toddler lapped it up as well! This will be my go-to recipe moving forward. I rated it 4 because I do think the suggestions from other reviews made a big difference. I'm not sure if it would have been as savory without those additions. Thanks to the original author and everyone else for sharing this!

A note about  cooking noodles in the actual soup pot or separately. I recommend doing separately, for these reasons :  1) soup is cooked to a level of it being hot -not boiling,  noodles you would boil to eldente.. The soup should not be boiled. 2) when you boil the noodles you will see the cloudiness in the water, that is starch, you really don’t want that in your soup, you should thicken your soup with other methods 3)If that starch/cloudy water  is in your soup it changes the color and flavor of soup 4) The noodles will absorb  your soup broth/liquid if cooked in the soup, yes you can add more liquid but this depletes the recipe/intended flavor 5)Noodles are more apt to get mushy when cooked in the soup and the soup have Less broth

2nd time making it. I added carrots but other than that followed recipe to a tee. It was very good and easy to make. Used a rotisserie chickken so that prep was very simple. I tried using 6C low sodium chicken broth and 6C regular. Had to add a lot of salt after so may as well go for regular for all 12 cups but we like salt in this house. Great easy recipe!

Turned out really good!! Used someone’s idea of a whole chicken that was done already, and also used black pepper and lemon for a little zest. It was AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!! Also added some carrots. Would probably put less salt next time. It was a little salty. Maybe 1 tbsp to start and then go from there

I use this as my "Cold Buster" recipe for my fiancee every year.  I increase the ginger to about 1TBS and follow the top comment every time.  Submerging an entire rotisserie chicken with the veggies.  My own twist from an old family recipe is to hard boil six eggs.  Pull the yolks out when they're done and slice the egg whites up for additional protein and vitamins to help get over the cold faster.

This is basically a good recipe but the cornstarch ruins it! I have never heard of adding 1/3 cup of cornstarch to anything!! What a gross gloppy mess!

Easy recipe and makes me feel good about making my sick kiddos homemade soup without having it take hours. I sautéed the veggies, with some carrots and garlic added to the celery and onion in butter for a few minutes before adding broth. I also used rotisserie chicken, one was sufficient but could have probably added two, and as suggested added the juices from the chicken to the pot of soup. Also added parsley for color since I had some on hand. My kiddos loved it!

We used 4 cups of chicken broth, and then 8 cups of water + 4 bouillon cubes. Also, didnt have poultry seasoning, so instead used some adobo, sazon, nutmeg, rosemary, and general italian seasoning. It came out beautiful!

I wanted a simple chicken noodle soup for a cold day, but didn't have lots of time.  Made this & everyone liked it.  Just used one tsp of salt & it was just right.

I followed advice and added the whole rotisserie chicken to the broth for 15 mins. Then I shredded the chicken and added back to soup.  I also added frozen, peas, carrots, corn and onions.  I used 12 cups of broth.  I cooked the small spaghetti noodles and rinsed them then added half to the soup.  I simmered about 30 more mins.   It made a ton, which I will freeze for later. super easy and wow, what a flavor.

No cooked chicken or rotisserie chicken? Add two chicken thighs and it even works using them from frozen. Just cook a little longer. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Don't add the salt.  It is too much.   There is plenty in your chicken broth probably.  Let each individual use more if they want to.  I use Better Than Bouillon chicken broth paste.  It has no MSG and lots of flavor.  Yes, you do need to add a dash of salt and some olive oil while boiling your pasta.  It keeps it from sticking together.  Most seasoned cooks use this method.   Stir it to coat the noodles.  Some oil will float to the top, just give it another stir to help the noodles catch more it.

As far as I'm concerned, this isn't "grandma's chicken noodle soup".  My grandma really knew how to make it and you didn't start with cut up cooked chicken. You used a whole chicken and cooked it until the meat fell off and you got a rich delicious broth, not to mention all the other ingredients. Sorry, but not my grandma's soup.

I made this today for dinner. While proofreading the recipe, l saw the 2 tablespoons of salt. Common sense said that was a salt lick, waiting to happen. I think it’s probably a typo, so l reduced the salt to two teaspoons, and that was just perfect! It’s simple, and fast, and will be a staple in our home.

I’ve been looking for a great chicken noodle soup recipe and this is it! This is what I did: I sautéed onion, celery carrots and minced garlic with 1T. Of Butter for about 5 minutes. I then added 96 oz reduced sodium chicken broth, and 64 oz regular chicken broth all in a large stockpot. I added pepper, sprinkle of cayenne pepper, sprinkle of basil leaves, 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning. Cooking on medium heat, I then added the whole rotisserie chicken (bought already cooked from Sam’s Club). I let it simmer for 10 minutes. Removed whole chicken from pot to plate and removed chicken from bone. Placed chicken in pot and added 6-8 oz of kluski noodles. Let simmer/cook while stirring for about 8 minutes. Soup turned out awesome!

I made no changes to the soup and I  can happily say it is flavorful and yummy. I will be making it again and possibly adding carrots because I like the added veggies and I’m silly and miss some color.

I added carrots to the veggies. I actually started cooking the veggies in the broth first before starting the noodles so that everything was tender. I add the chicken to the veggies and broth before the noodles are ready. Turns out great!

I followed the reviews and used 1/2 reduced sodium chicken broth and 1/2 regular. I also added some carrots and sautéed the onions in garlic. It was delicious! Me and my boyfriend loved it. Will definitely be making again! :)

I made this using the recipe to the letter and didn't read reviews! Mistake! It resulted in a very salty chicken soup. Although pleasant, too salty for me and my brood. Next time I'll take heed of the advice in reviews!

Really good!  Making your own stock gives you a deep, rich flavor for the soup.  The recipe is straight forward.  It just takes a little time.  I didn't change the recipe but you can always put in some different/additional vegetables if you want.  Try it yourself and see what you think.

I cooked a whole organic chicken because it makes the most flavoranlr broth. Other than that, the ingredients didn’t vary except I used homemade thicker egg noodles. I love those more vs the dried noodles. They also don’t soak up all the broth.,

Someone said you don’t need oil to cook pasta.. i’ve Done it both ways but have found that putting olive oil or a little butter & salt makes them taste better & they never stick together. I also stir them occasionally with a fork. 

This is a good, basic chicken noodle soup to use. Chicken Souo is known for its healing effect when someone is sick.

My go to chicken noodle soup recipe for years! Of course carrots are a must so I add those and simply add the egg noodles to the broth (I'll throw in an extra cup or two) and cook the noodles that way. Rotisserie chicken is the go to meat for me

It was the first time I ever tried chicken noodle soup from scratch.  It was just easier to open up a can.  But this turned out great!  And so satisfying to make it yourself!  I shared it with several people and got nothing but rave reviews on it, including, “That’s the best chicken noodle soup I ever put in my mouth!”  I did add 1 cup of carrots to the mix, , and may rip up some fresh spinach for the next batch.

I made the recipe as is and I really don't see what all the rave reviews are about!  It needed so much more - I added carrots and some frozen soup veggies I had on hand.  It still needed more - I added a can of cream of chicken soup in desperation.  My family ate it up and asked me to make it again!

I was concerned about the amount of salt in this recipe so I followed some of the other reviews.  I used 6 cans of regular chicken broth and 6 cans of NO sodium chicken broth.  In the end I did add a pinch of salt to the soup but it turned out great.  Like others, I used a whole rotisserie chicken, carrots, celery, onion, 2 bay leaves and a clove of garlic.  simmered all together for about 15 minutes then removed the chicken .  I then added a bag of  frozen Reames Noodles and shredded the chicken from the rotisserie.   Simmered everything together for about another 30 minutes and added a pinch of black pepper.

This was a wonderful start to the best chicken noodle soup I've ever made.  As per previous reviews I added a rotisserie chicken directly into the broth with carrots, onions, and the noodles.  After simmering for about 40 minutes I took the chicken out, took the meat off and put it back into the soup.  Added the seasonings some Thyme as it gives a wonderful flavor.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Couldn’t agree more with Linda Hamilton. Use the ingredients and measurements as an idea and let the rest come together with what you already know. Instead of salt I used Knorrs chicken flavor bouillon to flavor the original chickens broth. After the chicken was cooked I chopped it up and used some roasted garlic and herb seasoning along with regular chicken seasoning to season the chicken prior to putting it into the broth. I added some carrots to! Delicious for a cold day and easy to make if Moms can’t be there to make you soup ;)

Very good soup!!  The broth came out a little salty for me so I added some sweet corn which did the trick.  Otherwise I used the same recipe omitting only the cornstarch.

Love this but I try to avoid processed foods, so I added whole wheat flour instead of baking power, whole grain egg noodles?, and used low sodium chicken stock for the salt. Also, I added fresh chopped spinach for more antioxidants and added carrots chopped for color.

I didn’t add the extra salt or cornstarch! I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store! Took all the meat off and put all the ingredients in the crock pot on low for 8 hours except the noodles. I added the noodles last 30 min of cooking! My daughter said I made it super delicious! We enjoyed it

I made this after coming down with a virus and it was so comforting, tasty and just light enough to not make me feel heavy..only addition I made to the recipe was I finely chopped and sautéed the celery and onion with garlic before adding to the broth (for added flavor). I also added fresh frozen sliced carrots.  This recipe is highly recommended!!!

My biggest tip is to use a package of cut rotisserie chicken instead of cooking and dicing it.  Definitely saved time for me.  I do think a few carrots or combination of vegetables and thickening of the broth might turn this into a great casserole or pot pie.

I added some chopped parsley which enhanced the flavor and color just a bit. Made it on a cold, winter day and it was the perfect comfort food-delicious and filling. I made enough to freeze three pints for future use. Excellent recipe!

Made this soup today and give it 5 stars for a couple reasons....first, its EASY.  I love easy!  2nd, great flavor and very adaptable.  I used chicken tenderloins.  Put them in a pan with olive oil. onion, fresh garlic, carrotts, salt & pepper.  The flavors blended  together so nicely  & when added to the broth, was magical.  I did not precook the noodles.  As the other posters mentioned, why dirty another pan?  I added them once my soup began to boil.  Perfect-o!  Great soup!!

Added carrots, no salt and came out great and so easy. Cooked the noodles in the soup and not separately.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I made it for my daughter who has the flu.  She ate two full bowls!  My wife, who is not sick, loved it as well.

Pretty good. Next time I’d add garlic with onions and carrots. I put too much noodle in which made it almost a stew. I’ll cut back next time. Also this is a huge supply. I froze a couple of pints though. Easy and tasty!

This is a very good basic chicken soup recipe.  I changed it up just a little bit.  Omitted the salt which seems excessive.   Instead, used chicken bone broth for its nutritional value and taste.  Added Chicken Better than Bullion to taste as well as a good amount of Poultry Seasoning.   (If you still need the salt, add at the end to taste. I found the salt in the bone broth, the Better than Bullion and seasoning was enough.)  Used rotisserie chicken and added at the end after the veggies were cooked.  Also added carrots for both flavor and color.  Cooked the noodles separately and added with the chicken.   Simmered about 15-20 mins.  My husband raved about it.  4 stars due to the salt.  Otherwise, a good, basic recipe.

Very good, but I would say go without the salt. You can always add that at the table. This most recent time we made this we added wild rice instead of noodles. This one is a keeper.

Didn’t have poultry seasoning but used salt, pepper, tony creole, cayenne, and garlic powder. Rotisserie chicken- shredded, carrots, celery, whole wheat egg noodles. 1 box chicken stock and 1 box chicken broth. Used little cornstarch. Had leftovers and added half box of chicken stock to it. So good!!

This is a great recipe.  I made mine in a pressure cooker and I made a few changes.  I put the chicken stock, one small chopped  onion, 2 chopped ribs of celery, 4 chopped carrots, along with 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, poultry seasoning, and salt in the pressure cooker and cooked for 20 minutes.  Then I chopped the chicken and added half of a bag of egg noodles and cooked for 5 minutes.

Soup came out great!!! I cooked it with the updates suggested (low sodium - whole rotisserie chicken, simmered in broth with veggies) used the fresh garlic, poultry seasoning, basil, & bay leaf. Flavors came out great! Will definitely cook again!

Without a doubt the best chicken noodle soup I’ve made. I used fresh herbs for the poultry seasoning and one whole shallot instead of onion. I also added some chopped carrots. Fantastic.

My husband made this soup and used home made chicken stock. He added one cup of carrots
and 2 garlic cloves. He used medium egg noodles instead of wide.
Wonderful soup, best ever

My husband was sick so I made this for him. It was fabulous. I sautéed the onions and celery in butter in a Dutch oven. I added frozen peas/carrots, lots of pepper, herbs de Provence, parsley, and a dash of cayenne. I think next time I’ll use fresh carrots sauteed with the onion but that’s just because I want extra carrots! The frozen tasted fine, but when added with noodles. I used 2 32oz low sodium organic broth and a rotisserie chicken. Everything else I did according to the recipe. It needed a touch more salt, but that can be done to taste when you serve it! It was delicious.  Yummmm! This is the staple chicken noodle soup at my house now!!

I made this a few days ago and I have had at least one bowl EVERY DAY since!! I did follow one of the recommendations and sauteed the onions, carrots and celery in butter and garlic before adding the stock (prefer it to broth). I also added a big spoonful of better than bouillon to round out the flavor, along with both freeze dried and powdered poultry seasoning. Added the noodles for about 15 minutes and put the chicken back in to hear through. The cornstarch really does give the broth a silky texture and I found that it also seemed to keep the noodles from absorbing too much broth and becoming mushy. I will definitely be making this again and again!! It's especially yummy with some Whisps parmesan crisps on top!#bestchickensoupever

I like to make my own broth from a rotisserie chicken. First I take all of the meat off. And then I put all Of the bones and skin in about 8 cups of water .Bring to a near boil and then lower to a simmer for about 30 to 45 minutes .Strain the broth through a sieve .I also like to add to tumeric, ginger and cumin to the broth .

This was the first time I made chicken soup and it was delicious. As suggested in many reviews I also used a mix of regular and low-sodium chicken broth. I also added carrots, both white and red onion as well as a few garlic cloves. This was so easy to make and I had plenty left for future meals.

Very salty and has too much of a celery taste. I didn’t even use all the called for salt and a lower sodium stock. It was ok. Didn’t love it and didn’t hate it.

So good!  I cooked the noodles in the broth with the celery and onion instead of separately.  I added an extra pinch of  dried thyme and rosemary, which gave a little more kick to the poultry seasoning.  I put the salt in a little at a time to make sure that it didn't get to be too much and ended up only using about 1 Tbsp.  Black pepper at the end made it perfect!  I will definitely be making this again soon!

This is a good soup! You probably don’t need extra salt if you are using broth bought at the store. I added in an extra 32oz of chicken broth, 2 bay leaves, 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, threw in a cup and a half of chopped carrots and 3/4ths cup of frozen peas, and changed the noodles to rice noodles to make it gluten free (and just threw them in the pot to cook with the broth rather than cooking them separately). My boyfriend thinks it’s fantastic and I’ve been enjoying it, too!

This soup was delicious. I precooked chicken thighs and then added the bones to the broth during the cooking process. The only additions I added was parsley. Family loved it so it will be made again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using only 1 T salt. I wish I had used less. I also would prefer this with carrots in it. This soup is a little too basic for me, but I suppose it’s a good starting point.

I made a few slight changes. I slow cooked it. Didn’t use salt or water went straight chicken stock reduced sodium. It came out amazing. My wife was sick and wanted home made chicken soup. This hit the spot and then some.

This soup was great! I followed several reviews who said to buy a rotisserie chicken already cooked, but I wish I hadn't. It was good but next time I'll add a chicken and let it soak in all the flavor of the soup. It was great nonetheless.

Great starting point! I typically make recipes as written the first time, but I noticed some small changes I knew would make a big impact. First, I sautéed the onion/celery in butter, also adding 2 cloves of garlic. At the same time, I added the poultry seasoning, oregano, thyme, one bay leaf and cracked black pepper, cook until onions/celery are tender. Once you have all the good smells going, add the broth and simmer. I used the pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from Costco as that was all I had. Delish!!!

This was an amazing recipe! Found it when my DH was sick with a cold. I followed a couple of other's users recommendations. I did 1/2 regular stock and 1/2 low-sodium and omitted the additional salt in recipe (I wanted a little more salt when I tasted, but my DH thought it was good), put the whole rotisserie chicken in the stock and veggie mix for 15 min, I added carrots and peas (about 20 min before it was finished since I was using canned peas, and I just cooked the noodles in the mix in the final 20 min. Next time I will add more stock or omit the corn starch. Since I cooked the noodles in the soup it was a little thick with the starch from the noodles cooking and the corn startch, but still amazing!

This soup is wonderful! I couldn’t find my cornstarch so I skipped this step. It didn’t matter, the soup was delicious!! My family likes chicken and rice soup, so I substituted Minute Rice for the noodles. I think the poultry seasoning is a fantastic addition!! My family LOVED it!

4 stars for the base recipe. It was a 5 with a few tweaks. Changes: added 3 carrots chopped very thin, 2 celery sticks chopped, 1 whole medium onion, 1 tsp dried basil, NO added salt, and 1 rotisserie chicken (thank you to whoever suggested this). Next time I will use 1 carton of low-sodium chicken stock & 1 carton regular. It was bit too salty, but manageable. Next time I may just buy half a rotisserie chicken instead of a whole one. I also had no cornstarch on hand so I left that out. I sautéed the onions for a couple mins in a bit of olive oil and some minced garlic. Then added everything else. Added the whole chicken for 10 mins. Removed and shredded and readded. While you're shredding throw in the egg noodles to cook. Then re-add and serve. My bf loved it and asked for me to pack leftovers in his lunch!

Turned out great. Used a rotisserie chicken. Let the chicken stew for about a half hour, pulled, pulled off and chopped up chicken and added to the soup.

I love homemade chicken noodle soup, it's my favorite food!

This is my first time making homemade chicken noodle soup, and it turned out perfectly, even with the carrots I added in with the celery!  This is one of the best chicken soups I've ever eaten!


I also like how this recipe is simple and not too involved, nor time consuming, which is always a plus.

If you make this soup, you won't be disappointed! :)

My family loved this soup, no leftovers! The only changes I made was I cut the salt in half and used half regular broth and half low sodium broth, that is what I had on hand. Thank you, will make again.

Followed the recommendations of other reviews and added, garlic, bay leaves, poultry seasoning, celery salt (no celery on hand). I used the leftover beer-butt chicken barbecued for the stock and chicken pieces. Used rice instead of noodles so it was gluten free.
Tastes pretty good.

From other reviewers (thank you), great with rotisserie chicken (Boil 15 min:  3 qts broth, 1 t poultry seasoning, 1 c chopped celery, 1 c chopped onion, 1 rotisserie chicken.  Then remove chicken from bone and return chicken pieces to soup. Add 2-3 cups homemade noodles* and return to boil, then cook until done, about 15 minutes.  *Noodles--Beat until light:  3 egg yolks +  1 egg.  Add 1 t salt,  3 T milk  and beat again. Mix in 1½ - 2 cups flour.  On a floured surface, roll these out until thin, then cut into strips.  Allow to dry until ready to add to soup.  This is a perfect dough for noodles. Noodles are weather sensitive, so don't be afraid to add more liquid or flour if needed.

This was a HUGE hit at my house!!! I had to substitute the nutmeg for allspice because I was out.  So wonderfully savory and tasty!! I used a rotisserie chicken I got from Costco, shredded both breasts, and omitted celery because no one here  likes the texture. This is a must make! My husband has tonsillitis and it's the only thing he can keep down. This recipe is a keeper!! Enjoy

This was delicious! Not too heavy  just right.
I added some carrot just to add some color.
I will be making this many times! Thanks for the recipe!

we love this soup, I am out of poultry seasoning so I added a sprinkle of Thyme leaves, salt and pepper,  and it is just perfect! I just added everything to the chicken broth I cooked the chicken in, last went in the egg noodles, when they were nearly done I added the cubed cooked chicken. Simple, but delicious, no fuss.

Absolutely love this soup! It's now a family favourite. I took the comments about cooking the whole chicken in the broth for 15 mins and removing it, taking the meat off the bone and returning the meat to the soup, cooking  the egg noodles at the end, in the broth before serving. I never have poultry season so basil and bay leaves and garlic. And finally cooking the onion and veggies in butter before adding the broth. Seems like a lot of changes but it's not really and I still use the recipe as a guide everything I make it.

This was good. Wished I had used shorter noodles, but the flavor was good. The next day, the soup looked a little less appealing, but still tasted ok. I would definitely serve this as soon as I made it the next time instead of making ahead of time.

Best chicken noodle soup I have ever made.  I read the reviews and decided to use the rotisserie chicken instead of boneless/skinless chicken.  It was so tasty.  I boiled the chicken in water for 15 min. Each side, drained, and used the water I boiled the chicken in for stock along with the bought chicken stock.  This also made the chicken easier to take apart and remove the bones.  Turned out great, will make again.

I have made this recipe quite a few times now. It’s simply a phenomenal fast home made chicken soup recipe. I’ve not found one that is its better, and particularly considering how quickly it can be made. Firstly, following some recommendations in the comments, I used 1/2 low sodium broth, and 1/2 regular broth—and I added more than recommended to get more broth in the end, about 14 cups. I use a rotisserie chicken from the store, with the meat all hand-separated and torn into bite sized chunks, no skin or gristle. I save the large bones from the chicken and throw all of that into the broth. Also, the celery and onion can be sautéed first or simply added to the broth raw, I’ve found it makes little difference in the end. I don’t pre-cook the noodles, but after letting the meat, bones and veggies simmer for a while—at least twice as long as recommended (my mom used to simmer hers all day)—then I throw the noodles uncooked into the broth. I used a whole bag of egg noodles, I didn’t measure. 
In the beginning, before simmering, I also add a couple bay leaves and about 1/2 TSP of dried oregano and basil, plus about 1 TSP dried parsley. In addition, since we love it, I added 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic. I didn’t use the cornstarch since the consistency seemed perfect without it at the end. Every time I have made this, the KIDS can’t get enough, let alone the adults. I’ve never seen something like it before. They want it for BREAKFAST. Great recipe! Thank you!

I made this with the roasted chicken from the recipe below (sans maple syrup and potatoes). Having roasted garlic and drippings to add really put this over the top.

Good, basic recipe for chicken noodle soup. I have an InstantPot pressure cooker so I cooked a couple chicken breasts that shredded up easy. And I added sliced carrot to it too, otherwise I used the recipe as-is. I've always made my soup without a recipe, and have never tried corn starch in it, so I used it this time as per recipe, but didn't really see any difference good or bad. Might just leave it out next time.

Loved this recipe, but changed a couple things.  I used predominantly chicken stock and one container of chicken broth.  It doesn't ask for carrots or pepper, so added them.  Instead of noodles I used half a box of penne pasta and the end result is incredible.

I've been looking for a good chicken noodle soup recipe to make homemade GF soup, and this will be my recipe from now on! I substituted GF egg noodles and added a cup of diced carrots to this recipe (you can see carrots in the picture...they may have been accidentally omitted from the recipe). It turned out wonderfully!

This is the 2nd time I have used this recipe...was feeling under the weather with a summer cold (yuck) so I decided was that I needed a little old fashioned pick me up...chicken soup to the rescue! I even had a chance to share with my granddaughter, who is 5 1/2 , and she can be a little picky...guess what: she Loved It too! I am a success. I am making more right now (I had made a 1/2 recipe before) so I can have some for work tomorrow.  Looking forward to lunch time!

It was more work than most recipes I make but it was worth it.  The only change I made was I added several sprigs of fresh thyme and dill when I added the onions and carrots to the stock.

Very good soup, if to add your own taste to it. I used mostly home made chicken stock and a little store bought, added  garlic, chives, and a few other spices. I used leftover chicken quarters I had cooked on the smokers he day before. The entire pot was eaten in two days.

I have converted this recipe to the electric pressure cooker (the magic cooker) and made slight alterations so it's pretty much straight from scratch ingredients.  (I do omit the oil, corn starch and broth).

I put a  chicken leg quarter in the bottom of the cooker, the celery, onion, and I add 1 cup of carrots chopped.  The salt and poultry seasonings go in next.  I add the 12 cups of water.  I then use the stew option on cooker for 40 minutes.  When it's done I pull the chicken and then put the cooker on the brown/saute feature.  Once it comes to a slow boil I throw the noodles in.  I usually use the brands that are as close to German or Amish or like my grandmother used to make.  Not the standard egg noodles.  Trust me it makes a difference.  

After about 4 minutes on brown/saute and stirring the noodles/soup, I turn it down to the "keep warm" feature on the cooker to let it finish.  While it's doing that I de-bone/de-skin the chicken and shred the meat.  I'll add the chicken back to the soup.  I use dark meat here because it adds so much more to the flavor than white.  Continue until the noodles are ready.  Outstanding soup.  Enjoy!

I made it just as the recipe stated. It's too salty for my liking. I think next time I'll either do half low sodium broth or leave out the additional salt it calls for. Hard to enjoy with this much salt.

I tried to make it a little healthier so I too used low sodium chicken broth. I also used whole wheat noodles. I omitted the celery and added 1 small bag of frozen sliced carrots and 1 small bag of frozen corn. DELICIOUS!

My family and I loved it! I made it per the recipe, mostly. I used McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning as the "poultry seasoning." That is my go to, most favorite chicken seasoning. I used Reams frozen egg noodles, the thick chewy kind meant for soup. You just need to dump them in the same pot as the other stuff, no separate cooking needed with these noodles. I did add one cup of sliced carrots, which is actually in the picture so I consider that following the recipe. So even though the 4 of us loved it, I would add one more cup of carrots (bringing that to two cups), and at least another 1/2 cup celery. Any chicken will do. I agree that rotisserie chicken does make any chicken dish 10 times better, that's not always convenient. I did have to add water twice as the ingredients soaked up liquid and some boiled off. Very yummy, easy and I'll be making this again.

Easy and tasty! I modified after reading other reviews.  Did not add salt and only used reduced sodium chicken broth.  Used a store purchased rotisserie chicken for the meat and added a cup of sliced carrots and about a cup of peas. Everyone, even my twin 3 year-old critics, enjoyed it!

Can I just say that grandma had to boil a raw chicken if she wanted to make soup.  There were no rotisserie chickens.  I start out making my soup by boiling chicken leg quarters in water.  Once the meat starts falling off the bone, I remove the meat. Now you have broth!! To the broth I add thinly sliced carrots, celery and fresh parsley and simmer till vegetables are tender.  After the chicken cools, I remove the meat from the bone and return it to the pot.  I also buy kluski noodles from the store. I never add them to the pot because the broth gets cloudy after just a few re-heats. Salt and pepper can be added to taste.  As a bonus, I buy frozen cheese tortellini to use with or without your noodles.  That came as a recommendation from my son who works FDNY and that's their secret in the kitchen!!  Grandma always said that chicken soup was so easy to make.  I hope that you find these suggestions both helpful and delicious.  ENJOY!!!!!

Too good. I added a cup of carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, and some regular black pepper, then to top of my bowl of it, paremesan cheese. Rather than a tablespoon and a half of salt, I used just a single tablespoon, and reduced sodium broth. I used chicken thighs rather than breast, and it turned out a lot easier to eat (I personally don't like tough chicken, and I feel the breast is too tough for soup) This recipe makes A LOT so for my house of 2, it will definitely be frozen for another nights dinner.

Eleven hundred reviews, most of which rave about this recipe.  I found it very bland.  What taste there was was fine.  Nothing bad or exotic about the ingredients.  Just extremely bland.  Tasted like something you'd be served in a hospital.  I'd give it a 2 on the intensity level.  I had to knock it up a bit by adding a couple of teaspoons of Better than Boullion chicken.

This soup was so good. No leftovers went to waste here. It was a little too salty for my taste so I added some extra water at the end but overall a very delicious cold weather meal! Will definitely make this again and again.

The soup was great but I would add only half the salt and corn starch next time.  Added more celery and carrots and made homemade egg noodles.  Turned out great otherwise.

Will use less salt next time. Otherwise, great, rich soup! Added two chopped carrots and could probably add one or two more. With the 1.5 tablespoons of salt, and three containers of broth (one of them being reduced sodium), the recipe as is is a bit too salty (and I love salt). But still a great and quick soup that lasted us through a few meals.

11.23.16 ~ What's not to love about a hot and steamy bowl of homemade chicken and noodle soup?  I made this as written (double batch)and added some carrots for color.  It was very good and all the people I shared this with, loved it.   The recipe comes together easily and the house smells amazing while it is simmering.  Simple, basic recipe with amazing taste.

I used No Salt Added broth because I'm not a fan of overly salty things. Instead of poultry seasoning, I just used most of the spices that are in it: sage, thyme, rosemary, marjoram. I added black pepper. Following the recipe as is made the celery and onions a little crunchier than I prefer, I think next time I will sauté them a little, and add carrots to the mix. 

I made this last night because my best friend and I had both been feeling under the weather, him more so than me. This morning we're both feeling almost back to normal. That's the magical healing power of chicken noodle soup!

Awesome!  Best CNS ever.  I tweaked the recipe by adding fresh chopped parsley and kale leaves.  Adding a squeeze of fresh lime juice to keep the kale green and eliminating the cornstarch.  I cooked the noodles separately then froze a couple of containers for a snowy weekend.  My husband gave his thumbs up for a do-over in the future!

This is a very hearty recipe, the only think I would do less of is the poultry seasoning because it tends to make it too salty and overpowering. And I did half low sodium chick broth and only 1 tblsp of salt. Other than that is was delicious.

Sautéed the onion, celery, before adding to the broth. 
At the suggestion of my daughter I added some dill weed.
I add noodles as needed for each bowl instead of directly into the soup so the noodles stay more firm.
Really good soup!

Followed recipe exactly using homage chicken stock. Salt not an issue, probably because of homage stock. Soup turned out fabulous. Giving four stars instead of five because it needs carrots or some kind of others vegetable in it.

This was the first time I made a soup from scratch.  It was a hit!  I made sure to buy the chicken broth with lower sodium and did not add any more salt.  I also used a rotisserie chicken and added a cup of carrots.

Amazing soup. I listen to the reviews and changed a few things. I took 4 cup so chicken stock and boiled the bones of a rotisserie chicken for 30 minutes. Then strained the chicken bones out of the broth. Then added the broth to the rest of the soup. I added 3 small sweet potatoes chopped, 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 teaspoons turmeric, dash of ground ginger, dash of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon dry Basel. Amazing

I took the advice of others and purchased a whole rotisserie chicken from Costco (it saved a lot of time), I let the broth boil, then added the noodles let them boil then added the whole chicken to the pot. Once the chicken started falling off the bone (after about 20mins) I removed the bones and skin and chopped the meat. I also added garlic powder to the seasoning. I didn't use salt at all my family doesn't eat salty foods, used 1 can (49ozs) of regular chicken broth and 2 cans (49ozs each) of low sodium Chicken broth. I used a whole bag of noodles and added carrots.And because i like creamy chicken noodle soup I used 2 small cans of Campbell's cream of chicken and 1 small can of Campbell's cream of mushroom (Wow!!).. It made so much but I was pleased because my family fell in love with it that night for dinner, had it for lunch the day next day and begged for more for dinner the following night.  I froze the rest in sandwich bag portions (enough to make a bowl full) for my family to thaw, heat and eat as they go.

I used more noodles than called for and cooked the noodles in the chicken broth and let the starch of the noodles substitute the thickening of the cornstarch. Also I left out the onion and added carrots. My husband says it's the best chicken noodle soup he's ever had! Will DEFINITELY be keeping this recipe and making it again!

This recipe was amazing.  We too purchased a fully roasted backed  from the store (we chose the rosemary garlic for flavor), and simmered the chicken broth in it.   It was awesome!  Would definitely recommend adding additional  garlic it. Our first time out we didn't, and it was a bit bland.  Certainly suit with extras to taste.  I will tell you that the leftovers didn't even last TWO DAYS!  I was able to scrounge up only 4 spoonfuls after on day two:(  Absolutely love this recipe!

Added carrots and some thyme.  It WAS delicious. I may have put more noodles in than called for, which soaked up more broth. Was also careful not to use too much salt.  Easy and fast recipe.  No need to precook the noodles, just add the last 15 mins or so. Just remember doing it this way you need to add water or more broth.

As suggested by some other reviewers, I sauteed the onion and celery in butter, along with some freshly minced garlic, prior to adding the chicken broth.  I added some sliced carrots and used fine noodles, cooked in the broth, thereby making the cornstarch mixture unnecessary.  The soup was delicious!  Great comfort food for a cold winter's day.

So yum! I made my own broth though by boiling chicken legs in water spiced with salt, pepper, onion power and garlic powder.  After cooked I pulled the meat out and let it cool on a plate while other stuff was cooking. Then pulled the meat off and added it back to the soup. I also added sliced carrots.

I made this recipe as written. I thought it was a little on the bland side so tweaked it to our taste with about a half teaspoon of ground black pepper. I definitely will make this again.

I did not like the poultry seasoning...too much sage. If I make it again I will use my own combination of spices with far less sage.

The soup turned out REALLY salty... I also thought the recipe called for too much poultry seasoning. If I were to make this recipe again, I'd cut the poultry seasoning in half at least. Chicekn noodle soup shouldn't smell/taste like Thanksgiving stuffing.  I'm going to try to thin out the broth later on today. If that doesn't work, I'll probably pass on this recipe in the future.

This recipe is much like my G.Grandmother's that all I can say is that I use a 3 lb. whole chicken (fryer), I stew it (boil) until the bones feel "loose".  Bone it, throw out the carcass, skim the fat from the remaining broth...add more broth or water if you wish and follow the recipe.  I boil my "pasta" separately and add it just before serving, this keeps the broth clear and more attractive.  Cornstarch..........never, no thickeners ever in a good chicken soup!  Unless of course it's a cream of chicken.

I made a few changes but this was a great recipe.  I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and  used all the juices. As another reviewer suggested I put it all in the broth for 15-20 minutes. Took out the chicken and returned meat to broth.  I also added carrots, 1 bayleaf and celery to broth at the beginning.  I have picky eaters and added a half onion, whole, then removed the onion before I served soup.I added noodles to the soup and did not  use thickener.  My grandchildren loved the soup, especially the "best broth ever!"

I did as others suggested and sauteed the carrots and celery (i left out the onion) in a little olive oil first. What messed it up was i didn't have corn starch, so i used 1/8 tsp. Of flour to make the slurry. There were no lumps, but it sort of made the noodles gummy, like they tasted like flour. Next time, i think I'll leave that step out completely as it didn't seem necessary at the time, but i wanted to stay close to the recipe. I used home made veggie stock, and i may not have used quite 12 cups, figuring i could add more if necessary.

I liked this a lot, but it was definitely too salty for our taste. I will cut down the salt to 1 tablespoon next time. I'm guessing maybe it has to do with the broth I used or that I left out the corn starch. I used alphabet noodles instead (I added them in with the celery) and I added carrots that I pre-boiled. I sauteed the onions and added them in to the bowls of people who wanted them. Otherwise I made it exactly as is.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it needed some more herbs. Otherwise it is pretty yummy!!

Loved this.  I've eaten PLENTY of homemade chicken soup but this was my first time trying my hand!  At another reviewers suggestion I used a rotisserie chicken to make preparation even quicker.  I will decrease the salt or use a low sodium broth next time but other wise perfect and even my children gobbled it up!

YUUUUUUM.. super simple and yummy. followed advice of others and simmered a whole  rotisserie chicken in the broth with the veggies (added carrots) then removed the meat and threw it back in with the noodles.  Can't go wrong!  By the way.. totally forgot about corn starch.. didn't need it in my opinion

This is a delicious recipe! I boiled chicken legs and used the meat from the legs. I also added carrots. Turned out fantastic!

I love this recipe, especially in the fall. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used low sodium chicken broth for my own taste preferences. So good!!

I would say that it calls for too much salt. I even used 8  cups of 35% less sodium chicken broth! I would suggest adding less salt to the broth. This was my first time cooking it so it was my fault for adding too much salt so next time I am going to try adding 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt.

I simmered a chicken carcass in half water/chicken stock. The meat fell off the bone, so I fished the bones out and added the veggies and a good palm full of fresh parsley. Did not thicken with cornstarch, I like a thin chicken noodle soup. Very delicious! Being it's only the start of fall, I'll make this a few more times this year!

This is an awesome soup!
In the chicken cooking process, I used rotisserie chicken,
To richen the stock, I simmered the skin of the chicken into the soup for 30 min, then removed. It was incredible.

The recipe was really quick and simple which is what I was looking for. 
I definitely took everyone's advice and bought a rotisserie chicken (herb flavored).  I poured the juice into my broth and veggie mixture to give it more flavor after I had let the whole chicken simmer in it. I did cook the noodles with the broth (it'd be crazy not to!).  I also added carrots and a bay leaf. I forgot to add the cornstarch completely, but I don't think it took away from the soup.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was still a little too bland, and I didn't think the recipe had enough noodles so I grabbed another pot and made extra, just a personal preference though.

Very tasty soup for those days when you want chicken noodle soup! I followed the advice of a lot of other reviewers and sautéed the onions, celery and extra cup of carrots in a little bit of butter first. Then I added half low sodium broth and half regular chicken broth and completely omitted the salt. I had planned on using a rotisserie chicken but they weren't out yet when I did my shopping so I just cooked 3 huge frozen chicken breasts in a crockpot with McCormick Perfect Pinch Rostisserie Chicken seasoning for 3 hours. I didn't have any poultry seasoning and ended up omitting it, since I was pretty liberal with the Rotisserie Chicken seasoning and it tasted fine to me without it. I also didn't precook the noodles, just added them in about 10 minutes before I was ready to eat and the noodles were perfect! It makes a ton, so I had a lot of leftovers and the noodles held their texture fine after a couple of days in the fridge. It was just as good, if not better, than the chicken noodle soup you can get from grocery store soup 'bars.'

This soup was very good.  I didn't add salt.  I used chicken bouillon and felt that that had enough salt.  I also, used my crock pot and through in the noodles in the last half hour of cooking.  delicious!

This recipe was just ok.  Even with all the changes I made such as: using Costco rotisserie chicken, adding spices, carrots and celery, etc., it was still lacking in the taste department.  Admittedly, I was disappointed because there were so many favourable reviews.  I'm going to keep searching for another recipe

Great basic recipe & a breeze to make.  Used two large boxes (48 oz/box) of low fat/salt broth, a rotisserie chicken from the store, ADDED 1 C of  carrots (I think this was forgotten from the list of ingredients) and did NOT add any additional salt. Adding shredding parmesan (we're an Italian family!) in addition to the store-bought chicken gave it plenty of salt  for us (we don't used a lot normally). Not sure why someone had problems with the cornstarch - worked fine and gave it more body than just using the watery broth alone. I will definitely be making this again & making extra to put in the freezer for the cold winter nights ahead...ugh. Thanks for the post!

I really liked this but did it a little differently. Chopped 1 C each carrot and celery plus 1/2 of a sweet onion and cooked in 1 T melted butter in my stock pot for about 5 mins. Added 3 quarts water, 4 T Better Than Bullion, and 1 t poultry seasoning. Brought to boil then simmered covered for about 15 mins. Added 3/4 bag of uncooked extra wide egg noodles and 3 C cooked chicken that was frozen (I fill the crockpot once a month with chicken breast then shred and freeze in bags). Simmered for another 15 mins and it was perfect. I did not add any additional salt or the cornstarch. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a very tasty and easy to make soup.   I think that maybe it has just a little more salt in it than I would like, which is funny because chicken soup needs a lot of salt IMO.    Otherwise, it's fantastic.   A lot of flavor.   I'll just back off a little on the salt next time.

Perfect!! Love making this soup for dinner or when someone in the family is sick. The flavor is delicious. I will either pick up a roasted chicken from the grocery store, or make one for dinner the night before.

Really yummy! Added some carrots and corn and took away the onion and it turned out great. Easy enough to make when you're sick and easy enough to make when you're not sick.

I've made this soup about 5 times for my husband and 17 month old son.  Husband claims it is the best chicken soup I've made.  I make a few changes.  I use bouillon cubes for the broth (cause I always have them).  I use one less cube than needed.  I add carrots(lots for the baby),  oregno,  basil.  I use half the salt called for.  People can add their own.  The cubes are salty enough.  I I cook boneless chicken breast in a pot with the poultry seasoning.  I cook the chicken long(again for the baby),  covered.  It becomes almost shredded.  I have used flour when that's all I've had.  But it must cook longer and be mixed longer to avoid lumps and the taste of raw flour.  Last change is that I add the noodles at the end so that my husband doesn't end up eating mushy baby food for soup.  It's delicious!  Oh!  And the oil is absolutely unnecessary!  Thank you, all recipes!

Delicious. I also used half low sodium broth and rotisserie chicken like the other review. Also added carrots and beef bouillon cube. Completely forgot about cornstarch and didn't miss it to be honest. It's a really great recipe you should try!

This soup is a stable for us in the fall and winter time.  I probably cook it twice a month.  I use the low sodium broth.  I have used store bought, rotisserie chicken as well as cooked my own chicken.  Both ways tasted wonderful.  You can always add additional veggies per your preference.

Good basic recipe. Sautéed veggies plus added garlic and carrots. Did not have homemade broth on hand so used low sodium broth. Great way to use up cooked chicken breasts.

I also added some potato to make it a little more hearty. And seasoned it with some basil and parsley. Great recipe!

I made this for a sick friend and she raved about it! I made it as is except added more noodles than called for. I doubt that changed the taste and it was wonderful!

I have made this about 5 times, Im in the process of making it again. I read a bunch of the reviews and made my tweeks. First off I make a run to the local Sams club to get my rotisserie chicken $4.99, i also add in garlic as others have suggested, i omit the salt, add carrots, peas and celery, 96  oz of tyson chicken broth. I do simmer the chicken in the broth for 15 minutes, remove skin  and bones and place back in the pot with the veggies. I add the uncooked noodles to the pot in the end and cook till tender. I do add parsley flakes and suggested seasonings. The best chicken noodle soup.

Great soup!  A friend gave me a copy of this recipe and I wasn't surprised it was so wonderful.   We both have smokers, but she has had hers for years, and when I got one last year she told me I had to make this with the smoked chicken.  What  difference the smoked chicken makes.  We typically eat a breast, leg and thigh, then I freeze the rest of the chicken (whole, bones & all) to make this soup with.  I use half stock and half water for the liquid and bring it to a simmer with the whole carcass in it.  After an hour I remove the carcass to cool enough to remove the meat and return it to the soup.  I also add a C of diced carrots with the onions and celery.  So good and so easy, too.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
Update 1/7/2016: I don't cook the noodles separate, I add them with just enough time for them to cook before serving. I also found that egg noodles REALLY break down if you freeze this for later so switched to pasta which holds up much better.  Spirals or bow ties both work well.

This is my second time this week saying "I don't usually write reviews, but this was too good to not share", but it's really true. I did follow the recommendation of putting the whole rotisserie chicken in the broth with the veggies. I took the chicken out and added the noodles right into the broth. No need to cook them separately, let them absorb some of that flavor from the broth. And then added the shredded chicken back in. It was seriously amazing. I could eat this every day. Thanks for sharing :)

I made this soup today and I have to say, it is one of the best chicken noodle soup recipes that I've tried yet! Other recipes seem to lack fullness and flavor, but this one had a great base! I did make a few additions/ modifications:
1. I added 1 cup of carrots AND 1/2 tsp. minced garlic at the same time I added the onions and celery.
2. I used rotisserie chicken rather than boneless skinless - in hopes that it would add extra flavor.
3. I added 1/4 tsp. dried basil, 1/8 tsp. black pepper and 1 tsp. of dried parsley to the chicken and stirred it up before adding it to the broth.
It turned out great! My boyfriend had two bowls worth and another friend said it was the best homemade chicken noodle soup she'd had! YUM!

Great soup! I followed the suggestions of others - added a whole chopped onion, 3 stalks of celery, and some carrots, sauteed in oil, then added 2T butter for more flavor. Used 2 boxes of low sodium broth and 1 regular. put the skins and the wings of the rotisserie chicken in the broth to simmer for 15 minutes. Brought the broth back up to a boil & added the noodles to cook for 8 minutes.  Added the shredded chicken, and some parsley. So yummy!!

My husband said this was the best chicken soup he's ever had--not a compliment he tossed around. I added carrots, omitted the onion, cooked the noodles in the broth (a 16oz package worth), and used all the meat from a 6lb whole bird. I had no poultry seasoning, so I tossed in white pepper, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Perfection!

This is just a great, all-around recipe!  Whenever I get sick or am just in the mood for chicken noodle soup, I make this; so much better than canned soup, and it freezes wonderfully for another time.  I always add thinly sliced carrots, also -- like I had growing up!

The soup was good and relatively easy to make. Adding additional seasoning was necessary. Also the measurements for some of the ingredients were not even close to correct. There were more noodles than broth. I also added carrots, just having celery for the veggie was not going to cut it for me.

This is solid. Not amazing. Probably better things out there. I must admit I didn't follow the recipe completely...more leaving feedback for my own memory than anything. Cubed chicken, made stock. carrots, celery, onions, potatoes (cook longer next time) add thickener (corn starch) cook with very little liquid or wont be flavorful...put a spice seasoning in there...i also used fresh cut up cilantro.

Have made this several times. Along with this recipe have made the noodle recipe from allrecipes. 

I do this recipe a little funky. 1 pot + 1 large crock pot + 1 skillet. The pot is for fast/slow boil, mostly for the carcass. The crock pot is the "gathering place" for all the parts. The skillet is for sauteing onions and carrots, with 2 garlic cloves (chopped) added at the end, in butter.
We do lunches for the kids with a rotisserie chicken. We use about 1/2 the meat for lunches and the rest is for soup. Take the chicken carcass and let it simmer for a few hours in water along with any drippings from the rotisserie packaging, added to the water, 1-2 bay leaf, pepper, salt, basil, oregano, old-bay and couple-few chicken bouillon cubes (if needed), 
Once the pot has boiled/simmered the carcass (clean bones) and filtered into the crock pot, I let the crock sit on high while I do the noodles and saute the other things. While in the crock, skim the fat off the top several times. Once the saute is complete, add to the crock. At this point, the broth has been simmering for a few hours. Get the soup to taste (salt/pepper, etc.) before adding the noodles. Don't want to stir the noodles too much.Once the noodles are dried to your taste/preference, add to the crock. Ready to eat! The way I do this recipe isn't for everyone, long and drawn out, but on a lazy cold Sunday afternoon, it's just the thing to warm up

The cornstarch completely ruined the entire recipe and made it into a goopy mess, there was no broth left and absolutely NO FLAVOR.

I took the suggestions of another reviewer and used low sodium chicken broth, boiled an entire rotisserie chicken (from Costco)  I also sauteed the carrots, celery, onion and a lg clove of garlic in some butter prior to putting it in the pot.  I also reduced the salt to 1tsp, it  was a winner in my house with 3 picky children. I also omitted the cornstarch.  My teenage son, suggested next time to try it with frozen egg noodles (I use in a different recipe) because they are thicker.  I may have to try that.  I prefer Amish Noodles over egg noodles (thicker than regular egg noodles but thinner than frozen egg noodle.)  I also add about a tsp of Nature's Seasoning and my family loves it.  It's a definite go-to meal in our home

This is a keeper. I did a couple of things different than the recipe called for. 1) I took another reviewer's suggestion and put a whole cooked rotisserie chicken in the broth and simmered for 15 mins. 2) I strained the broth into a large bowl, removed the chicken and stripped the meat. 3) using the soup pot, I sautéed the onion, celery and some carrots until soft, added back the broth and spices 4) added the uncooked noodles to the broth. After 5 mins I added the chicken and let it simmer for 10 mins. Probably the best chicken soup I have ever had.

What I loved about this recipe was that it was EASY - and tasted  just as good as the kind that takes me 2 hours.  

Some delicious ideas/alternatives:
-used chopped roasted turkey instead (pre-roasted from trader joes) - very flavorful
-CIPRIANI PASTA - I can only find this at Fresh market - but it is SO much better as a soup noodle (tender - 10x better than egg noodles) that I would order them online if I couldn't buy them locally
-like many others I used equal parts carrots

I am not the best cook but this recipe was fail proof! Similar to all the other reviews I highly recommend using rotisserie chicken, adding carrots, and cutting the salt. The soup was delicious but I felt like the broth was missing something but I can't put my finger on it. Definitely worth trying.

First time making chicken soup and this recipe was a winner.  Easy to make and very tasty.  Substituted low sodium broth for half of broth required.  Used a whole rotisserie chicken as suggested in the reviews and let it simmer in the broth for 15 min.  Added 1 clove of diced garlic and 1 cup of finely chopped carrot.  I cooked the noodles separately as indicated and added them at end to avoid overcooking.  I did used all of the salt indicated in the recipe as I felt it was needed buy YMMV.  Will make again.

used 1 onion, bag of carrots and 6 stalks celery and tops.  Sauted in butter until tender and then added broth.  Half low sodium.  added 4 or more poached, shredded chicken breasts.  used gluten free pasta that was added to each bowl so it dosn't get mushy.

Classic chicken noodle soup taste. I roasted a whole chicken for this recipe. I excluded the 1 1/2 Tbsp salt, I think it was a typo.

This is a great soup.  I did omit the salt and used low sodium chicken broth. Other than that I followed recipe.  It is super fast and easy to make and tastes like it simmered all day.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice before and this time it came out salty.  I admit, that I did add garlic and onion powder to enhance the flavor.  I do feel that this recipe calls for too much salt so next time I'll cut down the salt.  Overall, it's a very good recipe. My boyfriend was full of one bowl!

I gathered ideas from some reviews and did the following: sauteed carrots, celery, onion and garlic in 2 tbsp of butter, added 2 cans of chicken (didn't have fresh or rostisserie handy), black pepper & poultry seasoning and sauteed a little longer. Added the broth and brought it to a boil. Added the cornstarch/water mixture and allowed it to thicken a little. Kept it at a boil and added a bag of Mrs. Miller's medium egg noodles. Cooked until noodles were at desired consistency and removed from heat and served. I did not use additional salt. Very good!

I made this soup, with one question....why does the picture of the soup HAVE carrots in it, when there are no carrots listed in the ingredients??  Haha....things that make you go hmmmmmm.

As far as the recipe itself, I found it far too salty (and I like salt), so I did some modifications (added more water to cut salt, and used seasonings to bring back taste),  plus added lots of carrots, some garlic and some white pepper.

I then only partially cooked the noodles, then put them in the soup and let them finish cooking in it.

After doing the above, I found that it turned out pretty good with my "tweaks".  I would definitely suggest that you NOT add ANY salt until after it's put all together, then see if you even need any.

Changed the recipe from the original a bit. Got rid of the poultry seasoning and just seasoned the chicken breasts I cooked when I made it. Also added thinly sliced carrots, toned down the salt a bit, and added more pepper. Great base recipe overall tho.

Made this a few times. I added the chicken poultry seasoning the first time, but went without it the next few times. I just don’t care for it. Also I add a tablespoon of tomato paste to give it a little hearty flavor. All in all a great combination, give or take with personal preference.

I would give this recipe 5 stars, but I didn't like the original too much. When I cooked it the first time I found that it was not salty enough, and I am typically a person who does not like salt in anything! So the next time around, bought one jug of low-sodium broth, and 2 of regular broth. I did NOT add the salt in the recipe. I added more celery until I was satisfied with the look, approx. a 1/2c. more, and even added carrots. I cooked the noodles in the broth as well. After my little tweaks, this is the best Chicken Noodle Soup recipe I have ever had

This was definitely a hit! I never made chicken soup before and always relied on my mother-in-law. But with my son being sick I couldn't wait for her to make it. It was delicious! I used the low sodium broth, rotisserie chicken  added the noodles to cook with the broth and eliminated the cornstarch and water. Even my  mother-in-law gave it a thumbs up! Thank you Grandma and others for your suggestions!

I made this exactly as recipe said with the addition of a sprinkle of thyme and rosemary and it was delish! I used less sodium chicken broth and didn't add much salt at all. It had a wonderful taste, very healing!

DELICIOUS, just like my mom used to make. But why are there carrots and parsley in the photo and not in the recipe? Ha ha you've got to have carrots and parsley in chicken noodle soup! Anywho, I add 3 peeled and sliced carrots. My mom did matchstick carrots once in a while to make it easier and those were great too!

Awesome, and easy!  My tweak was to reduce salt to 1 TBL, add 3/4 tsp. pepper, and 1 1/2 c. carrots to the veggies.  Use smaller noodles because they really swell up.  Dont cook noodles first like recipe says, put in broth after 10 min.  Cook for 5 minutes then take off stove and let cook the rest of the way as it cools.

I made this and LOVED the outcome! I use homemade Amish noodles, and do not pre-cook them, just toss them in after the broth has come to a good boil.  Perfect soup for lunch on a rainy day and also to freeze some for another time! If planning to freeze I half the portion before adding noodles. The aroma as it cooks is AMAZING as well!

Easy and wonderful! I used regular skinless boneless chicken breasts and shredded them. Next time I'll buy a rotisserie chicken for extra flavor and ease. I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount for me. I will definitely make this again!

Very good base recipe!  Added more celery and onion and added carrots and garlic.  Sauteed veggies in a little olive oil, then added broth. (low sodium).  Did not have poultry seasoning, so used sage, rosemary, thyme, marjoram and a little curry powder, 2 bay leaves, black pepper and some fresh lemon.  Used 'No yolk' egg noodles - came out great!  Will make again.  Would be good with leftover turkey too!

Ok.  I just made this soup.  I added 1 1/2 pack of frozen carrots and I would add more celery.  I also added more chicken.  After all of my additions, it was pretty good.  I respect the fact that this is a family recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This is my first review - after years of using allrecipes - because this really is that good!  I followed the recipe pretty close, because I always like to give it a fair chance as written. The only changes I made we're adding a cup of sliced carrots and reducing the salt to 1 tablespoon. I used buillion cubes to makes my broth and they're pretty salty so I thought this would balance out.  I love salt and this was just right when it was done, however; the next day, the leftovers were too salty. I think this would be perfect if you cut the salt down to a teaspoon to start and then adjusted to taste, knowing it might get a little saltier as the days go by.  The seasoning and the thickening of the cornstarch are just perfect to make this true comfort food. We couldn't get enough! I also skipped pre-cooking the noodles and just added them into the soup to cook - saves a pan!

This soup was very good and hit the spot on a cold winter night. I took the suggestion of others and didn't add the salt. I also took the suggestion to only add 6 cups of broth and not 12. Found that 6 cups was plenty. Added some cooked carrots that I had on hand as well. This came together very quickly for a weeknight meal.

Yummy soup!  I tweaked it a little - I sauted the onion and celery and then added the broth to it and also added chopped carrots and rotisserie chicken.  Try adding a squeeze of fresh lemon to your bowl - delish!  Definitely a keeper!

Gobbled this up. Good overall recipe. I did not cook noodles separately but added them at the end. I added carrots since I think of them being in any chicken soup. I did add the cornstarch though I don't know what difference it made. I will use this recipe again and add a bit of garlic and bay leaf.

This could be a good soup with some major changes to the recipe.  

The first thing is get rid of almost all the salt.  You already have it in the broth.  

Second, to call this 1/12 of this portion a serving is only accurate if you're serving them in espresso cups.  This whole recipe filled a medium size saucepan.  It filled three large soup bowls. 

I found the amount of poultry seasoning a bit strong, so when I make it again, I'm going to cut that down.  It might be fine for some folks.

Otherwise, it's a nice, hearty, thick, chicken soup that was SUPER EASY to make.

My dear husband made this soup for me when I was sick.  He made it exactly as written.  It was soooooo over-the-top salty that it was inedible.  We added about 2 quarts of water to at least save the beautiful chicken meat, but the recipe itself needs work, starting with no salt.  Even low sodium chicken broth is flavorful enough, and if at the end it needs a bit, add a bit.  But 1 1/2 Tablespoons is outrageous!

Made this soup after a couple of my friends fell sick with the flu. Followed most of the steps to a tee but I also added the broth from cooking the chicken into the pot, some carrots into the mix, and a little scoop of chicken bouillon. Taste and looks delicious- hope my friends enjoy!

Absolutely delicious and super simple to make. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery to make my stock (de-skinned it and threw everything but the breasts in with 12 cups of water, carrots, celery, onion and herbs) ... then strained it and added the new veggies (added carrots for color), chicken breast, cornstarch mix, and noodles and it was perfect. My husband raved about it and he's not an easy sell!

I use this as a "base" recipe for my chicken noodle soup. The first time I made this, I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was way too salty for our taste, and too thick with the cornstarch.

The changes I made are that I tend to cook chicken in a skillet with some dried herbs before adding it to the soup, then boil 8 cups low sodium broth, 4 cups water and add about twice the amount of the listed veggies. I will say that this is primarily for dietary reasons, but as I said I don't like too much salt to dominate in a dish.

My biggest advice with this recipe is to definitely watch the salt, if you add any at all considering most prepackaged broths have a lot of sodium (even low sodium products) and omit the cornstarch. This doesn't just make it a healthier dish, but it makes it taste better.

It was a bit salty even with reduced sodium broth. I think I'll skip the salt next time. Otherwise delicious!

This was hardy and easy. You could prepare the carrots, onions, chicken, and broth in a crock pot and cook while at work. Put noodles in when you get home and have dinner n hour later. I added half and half at the end by warming it to a low boil in a sauce pan first. This made it slightly creamy.

Made this recipe today with a few changes. I used two packages of sodium free chicken bullion instead of the poultry seasoning and low sodium chicken broth. Also sautéed the onions, celery and added peas and carrots that were also sautéed in olive oil and added 3 garlic cloves finely chopped.  And finally used frozen egg noodles and omitted the cornstarch. 

It turned out great!!!

Perfect recipe as is!!  I only added carrot slices & used a vegetarian substitute for the chicken.  I was worried about the veggies not softening up enough, but they were perfectly tender.

I usually make this soup in the crockpot and my husband and son love it!  My husband requested I make some early this afternoon and being short on time I made it on the stove.  Used low sodium broth and no salt.  As always, a huge hit!

This recipe came out great.  I made a couple of changes to reduce the sodium.  I used Herb ox sodium free chicken granulated bouillon to make the chicken broth, only used 1 tsp of salt in the broth, added a can of no salt added sliced carrots, sprinkled the chicken (on both sides) with some Mrs. Dash Table Blend and cooked at 350 till it hit 160°.  The Mrs. Dash really added a lot of flavor to the broth.  When we tried it, we didn't need to add any salt.  I will definitely make it again.

Great soup! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added carrots, garlic, bayleaf, thyme, and parsley. I also cooked my egg noodles in the broth before adding the chicken and nixed the cornstarch. I've made this twice now and it got rave reviews from my family both times. Definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly as outlined in the recipe (why rate things when you basically change the entire recipe by adding and subtracting ingredients?).  It was tasty and I'll make it again.  Left to my own devices, my chicken noodle soup is often rather bland; this recipe solves that problem.

I didn't feel like the corn starch added much, and this was WAY to salty for me.  I'll probably leave the salt out entirely next time.

This recipe turned out great but I did take some advice from the comments and made a few changes. As everyone else had previously mentioned, what is chicken noodle soup without carrots! That being said I added 3 cups if carrots and 2 cups of peas in addition to the onions and celery. I also added some black pepper and a bay leaf. The rotisserie style chicken is the best way to go! If you are planning to freeze a batch make sure you do not add the noodles to the soup before freezing or it will be a mushy mess. My family prefers to add the noodles to the broth separately. Happy cooking!!

I've made other types of soup but never chicken noodle...Loved it and so did my honey!  He had to stop himself from eating more than 2 bowls:). I added about 1/4 cup of chopped fresh dill because it is my favorite herb of all time.  Also added sliced carrots.  Did not use the cornstarch.  Hats off to Grandma!!

This is a good recipe.  I roasted a whole chicken and used the white meat and the juice from the bottom of the roaster in my soup.  I also used chicken stock and broth. Some garlic powder. Yummy!

I based the rating on the original recipe. Very good soup!

I did make it again with a few changes. I used 6-7 celery ribs, 5 carrots, omitted the corn starch, and used a rotisserie chicken. I sautéed the carrots, celery, and onions in a few tablespoons of butter first, until the onions were translucent and then added 4 cloves of minced garlic and the poultry seasoning. I also dropped in the whole rotisserie chicken for 15 minutes once the soup began boiling. Added chopped parsley and celery leaves during the last 2 minutes- delicious!

I made my own chicken with celery, onion, salt & pepper and used that broth to make this recipe. I had no problem with the salt issue  using canned broth will give you. My husband said it had a lot of flavor. He never says anything about my cooking.  I personally loved the soup, as well as my little girls. Thanks for sharing Grandma's recipe!

Very savory chicken soup.  I didn't add the cornstarch because I like it thin, and I think the noodles absorbed a lot of water.

Followed some other reviewers comments and used half reg chicken broth and half low sodium chicken broth. Added a whole rosemary garlic rotisserie chicken that I bought from the grocery store. 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt, a little bit of oregano, black pepper, chopped fresh parsley. Delicious!!

This is my go-to quick chicken noodle soup. I absolutely love it. I make it exactly as the recipe calls except I use gluten free spiral noodles. The poultry seasoning really gives it life. It even tastes better the next day. I'm not sure how anyone could give this recipe less than 4 stars!

Our family loved this! Thanks for the tip about just throwing the noodles in! I also loved the flavor of simmering the whole rotisserie chicken in the broth for 15 min and then taking the meat off the bone. This one is a keeper!I added carrot disks and it was great!

I used the "Fast Chicken Broth" recipe found on allrecipes.com, and then this recipe to make the most delicious chicken soup I've ever had!  Oh, and I didn't use that much salt because of the rotisserie chicken and I use sea salt which I think is better for you.

I used only 8 cups chicken broth and 4 cups of water to cut down on salt. I also used 2 cloves garlic 1 tsp of oregano and added  carrots. I also saved the step of not precooking the noodles I added them when veggies were tender. I also finished simmering  my chicken with the vegetables while they cooked.

Great recipe & easy to make. I added minced garlic, chopped red pepper, carrots & spices to taste. Used a rotisserie chicken. I find it easier & it adds a ton of flavor. Will definitely make this again. Next time i will also add fresh sliced mushrooms. I love homemade soups & this one hit the spot!!

Pretty good and easy! The thing that took the most time was chopping the garlic, carrots, celery and onion and also running to the store to pick up a rotisserie chicken. I sautéed the veggies first, pulled the meat and added the broth and bones to the pot. I also boiled the noodles separate and added them and 1/2 the meat to the pot after fishing the bones out. I skipped the cornstarch and poultry seasoning and added much less salt than the recipe listed.

I have always wanted to try homemade chicken soup so I picked this recipe and wow I am so glad I did! It is great and easy too. Simple ingredients make it easy to make. The only change I made was I got a  rotisserie chicken already cooked and shredded it up that cuts a lot of time off and the only salt I added was in the noodle water. My wife loved it also.

I really liked this soup. It was fast and tasty like others I added carrots and bought a rotisserie chicken already cooked and simmered with the veg's for about 20 min. I also added hot pepper flakes and took out the amount we were going to use added the noodles and cooked until the noodles were done. Plenty left over to freeze for later. Thanks for sharing & will make again.

This was a very good recipe. I did make a few changes according to some of the comments and for what I had on hand. I used powdered instant chicken boullion (I shudder to think of the sodium content), added some shredded some carrots and left out the salt. I left the rest of the recipe the same. My kids loved it.

I cook a lot but this is the first time at homemade chicken soup.  We were trying to eat healthier so omitted the pasta and cornstarch.  Like others, I added carrots but I cut down the salt and poultry seasoning and also added cabbage because my husband wanted more veggies.  This is an easy and tasty recipe!

Made it today for my family and they loved it.  Always found the restaurant style chicken noodle soups to be too salty.  This was great in that I could control all the ingredients and it was very simple.  I didn't change except for leaving off the onions and adding in celery instead.  Altogether, from preparation to cooking, it took about 60-75 minutes.

I have been trying to make good chicken soup for years and this was awesome.  I used alphabet pasta instead of egg noodles and added a few too many but this recipe is a keeper!

4.5 Stars: I decreased the salt and added a cup of diced carrots.  The flavor is really good. I followed the suggestion of boiling a whole rotisserie chicken for 30 minutes in the broth before deboning. The only problem I had (other than my teenager complaining about celery) was the noodles were too soggy.  I need to figure out how to fix that if we are not eating it immediately. I also plan to puree the cooked onion and celery to sneak them past the teenager.

I've made this a few times and it's super simple and yummy. Add a cup of carrots as well. I like to saute the onions, celery and carrots first off. Adds a nice flavor and releases some sugars to sweeten up the saltiness. I also don't bother with pre-cooking the noodles, but just throw them in raw when everything else is in the pot.  This is a good one to throw your own little twists into. Quick, easy and yummy.

I really liked this simple recipe. The only thing is it appears to be missing the Carrots on the ingredients list as you can clearly see them in the picture, so I just added them. If you use the full sodium broth, it really tastes even better, but you can always use low sodium if desired.

I like the versatility of this soup! I cooked the raw chicken in the pot first, added onions, carrots and celery and cooked the noodles in the broth instead of in a separate pot - I didn't see why I cannot just cook the noodles in the broth... Is there something I am unaware of? Anyway, turned out to be a nice comfort food. Easy on the stomach too. By the way, I used 3 of those Knorr chicken broth concentrate (meant for 10.5 cups of broth), but added 12 cups of water still and then salt and pepper to taste.

Not bad.  The flavor is too strong so next time I will use less of the poultry seasoning.  It is also a little salty so I watered it down a little.  Husband disliked but the kids and I liked it.

As is, it was just okay. 

I had some chicken breasts and boiled those first in the broth. I used 4 stalks of celery and about half a bag of baby carrots halved. 

I used all the ingredients specified except for the salt and finding flavor lacking I added basil, thyme, oregano, pepper and garlic salt. This made it edible...

It's probably better if you use a whole roast chicken already seasoned, I just didn't have one. But I'll try another recipe next time!

Very good soup, especially for the amount of time it took to prepare (the 45-minute estimate was pretty accurate for me). I added in some chopped cooked carrots along with the celery; that was the only thing that seemed to be missing. Thanks, Corwynn!

I made this for my grandson's birthday party and didn't want to take a chance on bland soup, so followed the suggestions given by several reviewers. I doubled the recipe. I started with homemade chicken broth. I added fresh minced garlic, grated carrot, bay leaf, basil, and pepper. I used all the salt called for. I cooked the wide noodles in the broth, then added the cornstarch and chicken. I also made broccoli/cheese soup and homemade whole wheat rolls and the guests raved about it all! Many said it was the best chicken soup they'd had. Thanks for helping me be known as a great cook!°Ü°

Easy prep, inexpensive very good soup! I have to agree with a lot of the reviews the salt is a little over kill. Use sodium free broth, or a 1/2 teaspoon at first then add to taste. I used a clove of minced garlic, and carrot as well. If you enjoy a little spice i added a teaspoon of sriracha as well.

I have made this several times using either turkey or chicken and everyone comments how good it tastes.  I wait until near the end to put the egg noodles in so they remain a bit firmer when served.

This was very good soup! My husband and I made it together tonight as he has a bad cold and thought chicken soup would help his recovery. I totally agree! I thought it was different with the thickening agent so the broth wasn't so thin and it was good!

Nice soup, added a cup of carrots because I can't imagine chicken noodle without it. Suggest you salt to taste at the end and shouldn't require much and I used low sodium broth. I also used a little fresh ground pepper, about three turns of the grinder. If you love chicken noodle as I do then you are sure to be pleased with the ease and flavor of this soup. Enjoy!

This was so good!!  I have picky eaters (4 1/2 and 3-year-old) and they loved this.  My 3-year-old had 2 full bowls.  I did add carrots and 2 garlic cloves.  Thanks for the recipe!

1664 mgs of sodium per serving? Who eats 1 serving? I liked the soup but the sodium content is outrageous! I used low sodium broth and I will adjust the recipe more next time.  Remember to look at the nutritional facts and adjust accordingly.

We felt this soup lacked color and flavor. Adding carrots and frozen peas helped but would still need a lot more seasoning because it seemed bland to us. We did not use salt or cornstarch. Maybe next time I would try rotisserie chicken instead.

This was a great tasting soup!!  I didn't have chicken broth so I just used 12 cups of water and 12 bouilion cubes.  I ended up adding about 2 more cups of water since 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning made the soup too salty.

a very nice and traditional chicken noodle soup.

I'm added dried rosemary leaves to give expand on the chicken flavor. One of these days I'm going to buy poultry seasoning to try that. And I cut the chicken from 3 cups to 2 or 2.25 cups. I don't need that much chicken. 

And don't fret if you forget the cornstarch.

I used reduced sodium broth, water & a soup base for the 12 cups of broth.  Didn't put the whole chicken in as other people suggested, but it still tasted great.  It would probably have even better flavor if I used the whole chicken instead of the pieces I cut from the bones.  The chicken I had was leftover from Juicy Roasted Chicken on this site, which by the way, was true to the name!  Grandma's Chicken Noodle Soup is a great base recipe that allows you to change up the recipe as desired.

I made This with with the  Dumplings on this site posted by Carol. My 14 yr old gave it 13 on a scale of 1-10.  If you have the time smoking the chicken puts this over the top...  We did not add any additionl salt. The chicken broth has plenty. We did not pre-boil the noodles.  Honestly there is no need...  We did skim the fat off the drippins from smoking the chiken.   It turned out awesome...  Oh & we doubled the dumpling recipe.  Go for it... You won't be dissapointed...

Nice and simple.  I used the teaspoon of poultry seasoning, and it was strong.  I would have liked to use about half that.  I had to add more chicken broth to dilute how strong it was.  I also used a rotisserie chicken, (I've never tried that before), and it really added to the flavor.

This soup was great.  Making it for my hubby who is not feeling good.  Instead of using chicken broth however, I used water, and then added some chicken boullion cubes.  Also I had to add carrots.  I think that doing this instead helps cut down on the salt. You basically control it yourself by the number of boullion cubes you add.  I also love the suggestion on adding the pasta to the soup in the last 15 or so minutes.  I'm planning on that!  It does make a boatload though!

I made my own chicken/vegetable broth for this soup. After cooked I discarted most of the vegetables, but added some carrots and celery. I omitted the cornstarch and added a couple of potatoes instead of noodles just as suggested.

I just made this soup for the first time and I really do like it. I also added carrots and peas and omitted the onions since I don't care for them. I only used three (32oz) of broth which comes out to about 8 cups rather than 12. So I would recomend this to anyone. Better than can soup anyday!!

This was fabulous!  I used 1 large box of reduced sodium chicken broth and 1 large box of vegetable broth.  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a whole chicken and added carrotts. I removed the skin before I added it to the soup and let it simmer for a couple hours on very low heat.  The flavor of the broth was so rich, just fantastic. I can't say if it will be better tomorrow, because it's gone.

This was a very good traditional chicken soup- my husband thought it was bland, but that is how I like chicken soup. FYI- if you leave this on the stove for long, your noodles will loose their consistancy.

This receipe was soooooooooo easy. Very tastey.  I did add a whole Rotiseire chicken from the grocery store.  When it started to fall apart and pulled out and picked the chicken off and put back into the pot.  It was wonderful for a snowy Maine night with a grilled cheese sandwich.

I have made this 3x in the last month.  I made it several different ways but each time using my own broth from a whole chicken.. first time with just a plain chicken and then a baked whole chicken and then with turkey.  The 1st and third turned out fabulous because I also made home-made noodles instead of store bought egg noodles.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN FLAVOR.  I used as little chicken broth from the can as possible, added some sage and carrots and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe.  Wonderful.  I made a HUGE pot and my 2 guys ate it each time within 2 days... a family favorite!

Really though, this is a stellar chicken noodle soup recipe - really easy to make! It makes a TON, though - only a problem if you're only cooking for two!

I followed this recipe very closely it came out great.  I altered the ingredients for 4 servings, and used Mrs. Dash Original instead of poultry seasonings.  I also used a roasted chicken from the deli.

Great flavor overall.

I'm chuckling guessing that Grandma NEVER started her chicken soup with canned chicken broth and a rotisserie chicken! Certainly they make the recipe convenient, but hey, if you're going to make real chicken soup start with a chicken and a pot of water and make your own stock. If you're not sure how, check out the Boiled Chicken recipe elsewhere on this site. Not only will you have wonderful, flavorful broth to start with, but you can easily control the salt, seasonings, and fat. Granted, it will take you longer...you need to make your chicken stock a day or so ahead and let it chill to skim the fat away, but it will give you a great start to this recipe. Otherwise, the soup recipe is wonderful! Just add some other vegetables if you wish, adjust the salt and seasonings to suit your own tastes, and you can't go wrong! Aren't Grandma's recipes always best?

First of all, thanks for posting this recipe, my boyfriend said I am long-term material because I can make a soup like this!

I made some alterations and simplified it, though and it turned out great.

I did not use any seasoning aside from black pepper. Used 3/4 chicken broth and 1/4 water with celery, onions, shell pasta, and chicken thighs.

For the chicken thighs, I flash boiled them (approx 1 min) to remove any dirt / oil. After the broth begins to boil, I put in the veggies, and put in the pasta / cleaned chicken thigh cubes when the broth reboils again.

Very flavorful and took me less than an hour to make.

Hands down, the best chicken soup ever.  We make it weekly during the winter, and every single time somebody gets sick.  I add carrots and maybe a little more poultry seasoning than called for, but otherwise, the recipe is perfect as it is.  Utterly delicious.

It was good but I don't think the "best ever."  I used rotisserie chicken, low-sodium broth and cut the amount of salt added in half and it was still a bit salty (and we love salt here.)  It is very good for how quickly it comes together.

Perfect. I cooked the noodles in the broth with the veggies so I ended up needing a lot more broth, well worth it. 

It's good even w/o chicken.

Hubby accidentally grabbed a Pico de Gallo flavored rotisserie chicken from Walmart.  I pulled the blackened skin off where most of the spice was.  The spicy flavor on top of the classic chicken soup tasted great (and cleared the pores!)  I reduced the sodium, added a cup of frozen peas, and boiled the whole chicken before removing it to cut off the meat.  I will make this again, even with a spicy chicken.

This was great with a few changes.  Add carrots, garlic, oregano, a whole rotisserie chicken then shred it and out it back in.  No salt- I also used low sodium chicken broth and some stock I had left over.  I added a lot more noodles cause that's my favorite part.  Made a ton so I froze some for the coming months.  Completely hit the spot!

I LOVED THIS SOUP!!! I took another reviewers advice about adding the entire rotisserie chicken to the broth as it cooked and it was FANTASTIC!  I brought some to my mom when she was sick and she even loved it (without giving any of her own suggestions on how to change it!!)
thanks

This soup was pretty good, however, it was quite bland for my tastes. I ended up putting much more chicken bullion cubes than what was called for. Good recipe, just needs to be tweaked some according to your tastes. Will probably make again!!!!

Just wonderful!  I added a carrot and only 1/4 tsp. salt.  This will be a family "comfort" food during the winter - and on those sick days.
Thank you Grandma!

Great comfort food recipe. I used a small amount of flour in place of cornstarch since I didn't have any at the time of making this recipe. It came out great.

This was very easy and  delicious recipe.  I didn't use the cornstarch because I like my chicken soup thin.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to give some extra flavor.  I also used low sodium chicken broth so I had more control over the about of salt that I added.

No need to add salt- I did not do the corn starch thing at the end but you sure could- I used Grandma's Old Fashioned Egg Noodles in the frozen pasta section (they are SO good)- I added some diced carrots - and I used the breast meat from a rotesserie chicken- be prepared to add more chicken broth and pepper- let simmer as long as possible adjust seasonings- easy!

This soup turned out great, and was gobbled up by my family.  It does make quite a bit, however, so be prepared to freeze the extra or else halve the recipe for a family of 4 or less.  I would also use about half as much poultry seasoning next time, but that is just a personal preference!  This is a great recipe.

This soup is delicious. I did saute the celery, onions and carrots as another reviewer mentioned and the family loved it. I did not add the noodles to the soup, rather I cooked them seperately. Some went back for seconds...thanks so much for sharing.

Only used 8 cups of broth as recommended by someone else, and I used a rotisserie chicken and a little less salt. Perfect for a cold day. Yummy!

I made this for my brother in law when he was recovering from surgery.  It was one of the few things he could eat and he raved so much about it I had to make another batch becuase his family wanted some! The only change I made was to add a little cilantro because he loves that flavor.

I rated this 3 stars because the proportions of ingredients are well-balanced (with the exception of the salt), but I had to change a number of things. I halved the recipe. Changes I made: made noodles w/o oil or salt (never needed), added only 1/4 teaspoon salt, added 3/4 c sliced carrots, omitted the celery, added thickly-sliced button mushrooms to the last 5 minutes of cooking, and omitted the corn starch slurry.  If something is missing from this soup, it is the taste of homemade stock, if you have the time, use it instead of store-bought.  It made ALL the difference.  Using store bought broth made for a bland, barely-edible soup. With homemade stock, it is wonderful.

This recipe was run of the mill chicken soup. I added celery and carrots because I have never heard of having chicken noodle soup with out it. Other than that, it was good. It made a ton. I actually will cut it in half next time.

I made this for dinner on a cold, snowy, stormy day. It really hit the spot! I doubled the recipe, used grilled chicken breast, and replaced the celery with a can of sliced carrots. It went great with the crusty potato bread on this site! Very warm and filling. Fantastic comfort food!

I liked the consistancy and it tasted really yummy but I'll have to find a good way to cook the chicken that I add. I boiled the chicken and then added it but the next day the whole thing tasted gross because of the chicken. Any suggestions on which method to cook the chicken?

I have made this soup several times now. I can only give it three stars because as written, it is a little bland. However, it is a good place to start from if you want to make your own additions. I bake my chicken with rosemary, salt and pepper before adding it to the soup. I also like to add carrots and garlic to the broth at the boiling stage.  I add extra noodles and chicken because I like a chunky soup. After the first time, I left out the cornstarch and cooked the noodles right in the soup. Never turns out the same way twice, but always good. Thanks for a good "starter" recipe.

I made this recipe to the exact measurements and I have to say that this is the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had.  My entire family loved it, including my 2 year old son!  I will definately keep this recipe to make again and again.

This soup is delicious! You will love it!  Chicken soup is the one kitchen basic I have never been able to master, but now I can!  I added fresh garlic, carrots, 5 whole peppercorns, and 1/2 tsp. each of basil and oregano, plus left out the corn starch.  Also, I used about half the salt per other reviewers suggestions.  It's perfect for this cold, rainy night!

Funny story - I ran into a woman making the same recipe in my grocery store today.  Our soup was great. We used the regular rotisserie from our deli counter and added carrots. We also used Wheat Pasta for the noodles for the healthy touch. 

It was a cinch to make and my wife said the best chicken soup I;ve made her yet!

I followed some other's suggestion and used a rotisserie chicken for this recipe - I wish I had not. The chicken I bought had a smokey flavor that I really didn't think complimented the soup. Other than that, the only change I made to this recipe was to add carrots. Next time, I will use plain chicken instead. Overall, a good and easy recipe. Thanks!!

I only rated 3* because of the taste/smell of the soup after adding the poultry seasoning.  I have never used it; to me, it had a very 'wierd' taste/smell.  I only used about 3/4 cup. of onions and added 1 cup of carrots.  Adding the cornstarch did do a nice job thickening the broth.  I think the next time i make it, i will try a rotisserie chicken like many people have suggested, and perhaps add 1 tsp. of seasoned salt in place of the poultry seasoning.

This was good! I omitted the salt, used a little more onion than called for and also added sliced mushrooms, carrots, and about two teaspoons of basil. I served the soup with homemade honey wheat rolls. My family enjoyed this. Thanks!

This comes out very much like the chicken noodle soup from the campbell's chunky soup line.  

Also added carrots which helped I think.  

I was persuaded enough by the warnings of salt to use low sodium chicken broth and no salt which made the soup kind of bland, but then persons could add salt to their own tastes.

Recipe also makes alot of soup so probably will cut in half if I make it again.

This was sooooo good! I added a heaping cup of chopped baby carrots, but left out the cornstarch mixture.  I also cut the salt down to almost 1 tsp, and it turned out just right.  I bought rotisserie chicken from the store because I like using it in recipes that require shredded chicken, since its so flavorful.  Thanks!

I loved this soup. I used to make a homemade chicken soup that cooked all day.This is just as good and much easier! I really liked the poultry seasoning. I cooked a chicken in the slow cooker all day and used that for the chicken meat. Delicious. Have made several times!

This recipe was definately better than chicken noodle soup out of the can... but i was a bit disappointed. It lacks some flavor...next time i make it i will use more vegetables and also add a lot of pepper.

So simple but so good.  I made this in the slow cooker after browning the chicken I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and it was very good.

Outstanding recipe!  I added 1 c. diced rutebaga and 1 c. sliced carrots in place of the celery (I was out!) and it was still wonderful!

Good soup!  I used bouillion cubes, but it would be much better with homemade chicken stock, definitely no salt needed.  I also didn't use the cornstarch mixture as suggested by others.

I wonder if the submitter meant to put 1 1/2 "teaspoons" rather than "tablespoons".  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons and that seemed about right.  I added carrots, and a little more celery cut really large.  I also added garlic and parsley.  It was incredible!!!!  I made it for the first time last week, and I am making it again tonight.

Great soup! I used very small thin egg noodles instead of the wide. Family loved this! I also added carrots...we love them in our chicken soup.

Yummers!!  I took the advice of Chessacat and bought a rotisserie chicken and added the entire chicken (bones and all) to the pot.  Very tasty and flavorful.  Would definitely make again!!

I followed others advice and left out the recommended salt and just salted to taste.  I also used less poulty seasoning than suggested.  It was very good and I will definately use it again.

I made this for my "sick" husband and he preferred other chicken noodles soups that I made for him in the past.  He was well enough to say that I should stick to my other recipes. I think that it was the cornstarch that really threw the taste off. I will not make this again.

Delicious, easy and quick...perfect for a snowy day!  I also reduced the amount of salt, added carrots and cracked pepper and it turned out fantastic.  Maybe a little too much onion for my taste but other than that, it's a keeper!

this is a quick and tasty chicken noodle soup.  i read the other reviews and so reduced the amount of salt, and it still turned out a little salty. so i would suggest adding salt to taste. but otherwise, a very nice recipe and a quick soup to make if a loved one is sick.

It was okay, but nothing spectacular. You are better off to forget the salt, forget the cornstarch, forget the water.  If you want to thicken it a little stir in a can of low sodium cream of chicken soup.

Great recipe, it made a ton of soup. However there wasn't any leftover. It was perfect for the winter weather. I must agree with others, it was the best chicken soup I've ever had.

I didn't have poultry seasoning so I added a can of condensed cream of chicken soup. We also prefer more noodles than broth so we added less. This recipe is a good base, everyone likes their soup a little differently, and you can just add whatever you like to this one.  We like more intense flavors so we add some garlic while the onions are cooking, and carrots just to give it a little more color.

This soup was excellent.  I added 1 cup of chopped carrots and reduced the salt by half because the canned stock I used was fairly salty already.  The cornstarch addition thickens the broth a bit, but isn't essential to the recipe in my opinion.

This was a pretty quick soup to make.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I used 3 Knorr Chicken Boullion cubes and 3 T chicken granules.  I also cooked my chicken and noodles in the soup instead of separately.  The noodles had a great chicken flavor.

This is wonderful! I've also done it with turkey with equal success...also, I never use the poultry seasoning and notice no difference.

I added sliced carrots as other reviewers recommended and will definitely add again.  I used a bit less cornstarch so that it still had a soup consistency.  Very good chicken soup.

An excellent base recipe to start out with.  I added a can of mixed vegetables and I used left over rotisserie chicken which gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  I would cut back on the poultry seasoning, but only because I'm not a big fan and you can definetly taste it in this soup.  I will be using this recipe again

I cook this one at least once a month.  I have to double the ingredients, because this family of five just can't get enough!!  So easy to make.  Also, tastes great reheated.

This was very good.  I used whole wheat rotini instead of egg noodles.  I also didn't both with the cornstarch and water to thicken at end.  Next time I would add more veggies.  Will definitely make again.

Maybe because I made this as a remedy to my cold, I did not enjoy it.  I used the rotisserie chicken as suggested and my husband and I were not fans of this.  Ok, but the leftovers were thrown out.  Probably will not make this again.

Made this soup for a friend in chemotherapy, but it smelled so good I had a small bowl.....I am making a pot for us tommorrow!  Best soup I have ever had.  I added a can of green beans and a small tomato.  Excellent!  Also a bit of fresh ground pepper and the juice from the chicken pan.

This was a wonderful recipe which truly tastes as if it were cooked all day.  Since I had to tailor the recipe to feed two people, I seasoned it with garlic salt and poultry seasoning to taste.  I aslo added carrots and parsley for the more traditional version of chicken noodle soup.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Corwynn!

this was a great and simple recipe. i made a few changes. i added sofrito and recao. also omitted the poultery seasoning and salt, but used adobo instead. the changes were because i am cooking for my sick puerto rican husband and his mother. got rave reviews. if you can't find recao, use cilantro. it is similar in taste.

My husband is a bird hunter so I used grouse instead of chicken- no one noticed the difference. The next night I added chicken gravy mix to the leftovers and had it over mashed potatoes. It was excellent! (I, as others have done, left out the salt.)

Great recipe but WAY TOO MUCH SALT!  I even used low-sodium broth and 1 T salt, but it was too salty.  I almost wonder if the author meant 1 1/2 TSP salt.  That's the most I would use.  I also added carrots.  It is a very tasty and easy recipe without the salt.

I made this recipe for my in-laws when they were sick.  They said it was the "BEST" soup they ever had. It has a really good taste.  The poultry seasoning really makes it a hit!

Best chicken noodle soup I've ever tried.  Really quick if you have prepared or left over chicken. Does stay better second time.

This soup is great! I didn't add the cornstarch as I didn't see the need for it, I also added carrots. The poultry seasoning makes the soup! Thank you!

It was hard to believe that a soup that tasted this good, took only a short time to prepare! I agree that the secret is the poultry seasoning. Don't leave it out! My 84 yr. old grandmother(who is a great cook) became ill and I made this soup and gave it to her. She really enjoyed it. I tried it also, and enjoyed it. I will make it again. Thanks!

I made this for a town event and scaled the recipe for fifty people.  I used smoked chicken and some mesquite chicken seasoning while simmering vegetables.  I added the noodles just before serving.  It was awesome!!

Great Soup! I added a little more chicken, broth and noodles and the family loved it. I also had put in a can of corn and served it with fresh bread. I never could make a good chicken noodle before, but this is great.
