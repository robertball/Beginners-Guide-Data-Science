As I was making this I was convinced it wouldn't work out, but in the end it they turned out beautifully.  I substituted a hard mozarella for the gruyere, and did a simple coating of egg followed by cornstarch instead of the batter (to make it gluten-free).  I also added a clove of mashed garlic to the cheese mixture.  I served them with avocados and green chile salsa.  They were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make these any time I have squash blossoms.  It isn't a hard recipe, it just seems hard the first time, and it is very much worth it.

Remove the piston inside the blossom (just pinch it out) before stuffing. They are very bitter.

Simplified the recipe a bit. Didn't blanch the blossoms just rinsed them gently in cool water. Instead of making a filling I just sliced some chevre and added a coin to each blossom. I didn't remove the center and it did not taste bitter. I prepared a beer batter with 1 cup fine harina flour, 1 egg, onion powder, black pepper and 1 can of beer. Will definitely make again, maybe with cream cheese and chevre. Served over fresh pasta and marinera sauce.

Delicious! Don't be afraid to try this recipe! If you are growing zucchini or yellow squash this spring, you must try these. Thanks Chef John!

This recipe replaced my husband's family long time recipe for zucchini blossoms.  Although we have not stuffed them yet, the battered blossoms fry  deliciously crisp.  I don't normally have self rising flour so I made it with all purpose flour,  baking powder  and salt.  Perhaps that is why it took about 3/4 cup of water  to get the batter the right consistency.

These were awesome! The goat cheese/Gruyere combo was tasty without overpowering the squash blossoms. I had to add more water than specified to get the batter the right consistency for dipping, but if you eyeball it you should be fine. 

The final product was almost like tempura in texture/richness. It was great.  I might try replacing the batter with a lighter flour dusting another time just for comparison. I dipped the final product in tomato sauce as I saw suggested on another site, and it was a great counterpoint to the richness. Great recipe.

There were amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly , next time I will just dunk them into boiling water - 30 seconds was way too long.  Aside from that they were perfect and it was pretty easy

I bought the squash blossoms at an outdoor market from Italians.  I was nervous because I didn't know when I would have time to do them when they were fresh.  It turned out that I made them that day.  I had all the ingredients and the knowledge and they were superb.  I always wanted to try them.  Thanks Chef John.  I have your cookbook and I am a big fan.

It was my first time working with squash blossoms and boy did I love this! I had stuffed squash blossoms once at a restaurant and I was determined to recreate it at home.  It was the perfect appetizer to serve before the meal! Crispy outer coating and creamy on the inside from the goat cheese mixture. I also chopped up some leftover Italian parsley  and added it to mixture for a little extra flavor. Fantastic recipe!

These were absolutely delicious. I used cream cheese for the goat cheese and sharp cheddar/parmesan cheese mix for the gruyere and used squash blossoms that were in the garden. I had made another recipe on allrecipes that I thought were good a couple days ago, but this was way better. I will make these from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

These are great!! I needed more water than advised to make the batter into pancake consistency, but that’s no biggie. One time I made them with feta in place of the goat cheese, because that’s what I had on hand at the time, and that’s tasty, too.

I won't make it again. The cheese filling would be better in something else like a jalapeno. The flowers were a little hard to handle-- I may have blanched them too long. 
It was hard to get over the idea of eating a flower with a pistol inside.

I used spaghetti squash blossoms.  They are not as large as some of the other varieties, but worked fine for appetizers.  I also used goat cheese and Manchego cheese for the filling.  Would make it again, but will wait for them to cool a bit before biting into one.  As a result of my impatience to try one, I'm currently sporting an unsightly blister on my lower lip.

Nothing at all wrong with the recipe; I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating a flower from outside that recently I had shaken the bugs out of.  Although they were washed, and they fried up beautifully (I switched around the filling in mine), they just kinda turned my stomach, although I did choke down 1 and a half of them.  My husband ate the rest.  I am an Earth-child, and a gardener, and a lover of Nature, but something was just so off-putting about eating these, and I have eaten dandelions right from the yard, and feverfew leaves right from the plant.  I think it was the insides of the blossom that threw me - they didn't look at all appetizing, and when the blossoms were fried, they reminded me of a fried soft-shell crab, which I hate, because it's the whole thing.  I know, I'm weird.

These were sooo good! I used Mexican crema instead of Gruyere... Delicious!
