5.24.18  Followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of sub’ing Hillshire Farm® Chicken Hardwood Sausage (tasty and much healthier) for the kielbasa.  I have to wonder if all of that beef stock is really necessary because there was a lot of it in the Instant Pot® after the cooking cycle was completed.  I had to use a slotted spoon to dish out the sausage and cabbage, so I’ll try reducing the amount of stock next time.  Served withe boiled potatoes with a drizzle of vinegar, cooked apples, and Chunky Garlic Bread with sliced tomatoes (also on this site).

I made it and after reading the reviews I made the following adjustments: I used 3/4 cup beer with 1/2 cup water, 1 rounded tsp of garlic better than bouillon base, 3 heads garlic chopped, and 1 lb bag of baby carrots. Delish! Hubby loved it! Since it only cooks for 5 minutes, 2 cups off broth is too much, so I cut back on the amount.

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed is the Kielbasa.  I used turkey sausage instead.  The whole family loved it!

This was good, I mean, how can you go wrong with kielbasa and cabbage? We ate it with cornbread and it was a complete meal. My only thing was it seemed like there was a gigantic sausage to cabbage ratio. Maybe my cabbage was on the small side, or maybe I just prefer more of the vegetable, but I’ll probably double up on the cabbage next time. And the hubby says there should definitely be a next time.

Added crushed garlic, simple but yet delicious. My husband already wants it again.  Will be added this to my arsenal of good recipes.

It was a hit!   Absolutely delicious!   I used our venison kielbasa (4 links) and added shredded carrots that I had on hand.  No salt or pepper added during cooking.  I cooked in an InstaPot Ultra on Pressure Cook High for 5 min, natural release for 8 minutes.  There was still a good bit of liquid, so I turned on Sauté for an additional 10 minutes to reduce more liquid.   Served with sliced sourdough.

I didn't add any salt because it was salty enough with the beef broth I used (Better than Buillion). I did not add onions because my hubby doesn't like them so I put about 1/4 teaspoon onion powder in. I used Siracha for the hot sauce. This will become a staple in the meal rotation. It was perfect!

I made this recipe.  I modified it a little. I used beef bouillon instead of beef stock (adds salt), and Worcester sauce instead of hot sauce.  It was very tasty.  I do think the time in the Instant Pot was too long, because the cabbage was overcooked to the point it was disintegrating. So, I would scale that back to maybe half the time.

I made this for family and friends and it was a huge hit! It is so tasty and delicious. The only change I made was I used Octoberfest sausage. This will be a staple in our household.

This recipe is excellent!  I followed this recipe pretty much as written except I adjusted amounts since I only had 14 oz of keilbasa.  I also used vegetable broth instead of beef broth.  This will definitely be one of my favorite dinners that I will make on a regular basis.  Hope to see many more  Keto friendly recipes.

Made exactly as recipe states, except I changed the servings to 4 (which was perfect since it uses one ‘rope’ of sausage!).  I work late and need to get something on the table quickly for my husband and I.  This was delicious and fast!  The broth is buttery and so tasty. Not much leftover because my husband had two helpings, but just enough for lunch tomorrow :). Will definitely make again. Might try it over noodles next time.

This was so good! I used the alternative suggestion of 3/4 cup of light beer and 1/2 cup of water instead of beef broth, and added a teaspoon of chicken flavored Better Than Bullion when I added the beer/water combo. I also diced up a potato into it as suggested. I used the thyme and several healthy dashes of Louisiana Red hot sauce. 

My husband and I both loved it!

I only used 14oz of kielbasa because that was what came in one package, so it was a little light on sausage.. but still very tasty. The cabbage ended up quite sweet.

This was surprisingly good however I think I will reduce butter and the stock and try beer as someone else suggested.  The cabbage did get a little too soft even after only 5 min.  That said, it was delish.  I spooned it over rice.  Yum!  :)
