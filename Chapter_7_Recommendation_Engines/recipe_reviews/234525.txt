Smoked a 5 lb. pork butt and needed a bbq sauce to go with it. Just picked some habanero and jalapeños from the garden so I googled a recipe and decided to go with this one. After reading the reviews I decided to switch things up. I added 2 cups of apple cider vinegar instead of 4 and 1 cup of water as hubby hates an overpowering vinegar taste and from the other reviews it sounded like 4 cups was too much for our liking. Chopped up the 2 habanero and 1 jalapeños and minced it in the processor then dumped it in the pot. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 2.  Substituted ketchup with tomato paste because I was worried the sauce wouldn't thicken up. Everything else stayed the same. The sauce is better than I anticipated and adds an amazing kick to our pulled pork. Hubby said it was a tad bit too vinegary still but he got over it and thought it was delicious regardless.  Will definitely be making this again!

We tried this as a sauce for wings..We love the habenaro hot BBQ at Taco mac and wanted to replicate it.  This is even BETTER than their wing sauce...but we did make modifications.  We cut the recipe into 1/3 b/c we didn't want that much sauce.  Then, we doubled the amount of brown sugar as well as ketchup...and we did NOT add any cayenne power mostly b/c we did not have any.  Oh and we used black pepper, again, it is what we had on hand.

We put it on wings that we grilled and put Lotta Bull BBQ seasoning on as they grilled, then tossed in the sauce.  They were out of this world!

My hubby suggested we only use 1/2 of a habanero next time if we are making it for others b/c we like hot food and it wasn't uncomfortable but certainly noticeable in terms of hot on our lips after we ate.

My hubby said a MUST make again. Delicious!

Yes i have tried this. I smoked 3 boston butts for X-Mas and made this for the beer drinkers of the bunch. I wanted to kick it up a notch. I have my own sauce for the average non heat lovers but i have to say this was VERY good on pulled pork. I cheated a bit and added 1 more habanero that it called for but 5 stars on this one. Thanks Derek. :)

Woah, way too much vinegar. I ended up boiling and simmering for over an hour and it's still waaaaaaaay to vinegar-y. I went ahead and jarred it anyways, and am about to throw it back in the pan, water it down, and reduce it down again to try and get more of the vinegar out.

I helped my 14 yr. old son make this to go with pork chops.  We halved all the ingredients since there are only three of us who enjoy spicy food. It was delicious-sweet and spicy, a great combination.  My son did add a little extra ketchup and a small amount of spicy bottled BBQ sauce because he was afraid it wasn't going to thicken up enough. Would definitely recommend you try this sauce.

I cut the apple cider vinegar in half and left everything else the same.  About halfway through the boil added 1/8 cup of honey One of the best bbq sauces I've ever had. I also strained it before it cooled to get the chunks out.

I've been looking for a bbq sauce that is both vinegar-y and spicy but not too sweet.  This is definitely the recipe I've been searching for.  I ended up using habanero flakes because that was what I had at hand and it is delicious over everything.  Just be careful not to over reduce something that contains habanero in it like i did or there will be dire consiquences on your bun-hole.

One of my favourites.  To make it into a really good sweet BBQ hot sauce, add 6 or 8 serranos and don't strain before bottling.  I eat it on pretty much anything.

I made the first batch exactly as listed and it was excellent!  In my second batch I added a few more habs (I'm using some red variety I grew years ago) and 1/4 cup molasses.  Also great!   I don't think it's too vinegary at all.  In fact, I much prefer this over those ketchup sauces.
 
You have to follow the directions in boiling/stirring for fifteen minutes then simmering for at least 45 minutes to reduce and thicken.

I add a lot more onions. Sometimes I add peach preserves and reduce the brown sugar. Always tastes great.

Wifey loves it!!!!!  I made it twice.  I edit the recipe a little after the 1st time. I cut the vinegar amount in half with water.  It was WAY to strong the 1st time.  After cutting the amount of vinegar from the recipe, it tasted SO much better.
