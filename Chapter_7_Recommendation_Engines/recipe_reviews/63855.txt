This chili recipe has become a family staple because it is so adaptable.  The flavor is pleasing to everyone at the basic level.  I like more spice so I add jalapenos, my sister likes moresweet so she adds more cinnamon and some nutmeg.  The previous reviewer was confused as to if you drain the beans or not.  Do not drain the beans as the juice acts as the liquid base of the chili.  I recommend making it exactly as the recipe calls once and then trying new variations each subsequent time!

Intrigued by the idea of black beans in chili, I set out to try this recipe.  All in all, it worked out okay, but as I read through the recipe, I was confused as to whether or not to drain the beans as the recipe didn't specify.  I decided to drain off the liquid before adding the beans to the chili;  the chili was really thick, which is always good, but I think it was perhaps a bit *too* thick (I like the consistency of a bowl of Wendy's chili, and this was much thicker, with almost no liquid).  I created a bit more broth by adding a can of beef broth to the pot.  I wish I would have known whether to drain the beans before beginning cooking, though;  I'm not sure whether that was a mistake on my part.

I substituted cans of chopped tomatoes with chiles for the can of plain tomatoes because I like more spice.  I also added additional cumin and chili powder.  The result was a hearty, spicy chili that I will probably attempt to make again.

Really good,I used a different combination of beans, because that is what I had. I used more cumin, my family loves the flavor. I will be sure to use this one again.
