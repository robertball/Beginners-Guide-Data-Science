I brought this to a memorial day bbq, it was a hit! It is sweet.... the women liked it more than the men. I would recommend using only 1 pink lemonade container instead of 2 for the punch part. Very easy to make and refreshing.

This was a real hit.  Easy to make and was well liked by all ages.  I even ran out of this.  I usually have punch left over.  This is a keeper!

Excellent!  Easy to make and was nice and refreshing.  Not too sweet and yet not too strong.  Just  right!

this is yummy! everyone enjoyed it and was asking for the recipe! I left out the orange since I didn't have one.  I also made a second batch, but used raspberry ginger ale (instead of lemon-lime soda) and added lime slices! very tasty! I am making this punch again for sure!

I can't rave enough about this. It goes fast so have back up available. I only use one can of the lemonade and have even left out the fruit slices and I get rave reviews on this. It is so refreshing and easy to make. Really makes a bottle of wine last!!

This was a huge hit at the party I threw. I only added one can of lemonade, following some of the suggestions, and it was wonderful, not too sweet.

Fabulous & SO EASY!  I'll definitely remember to buy enough ingredients for a second batch the next time; we went through this fast because it was so tasty!  Not too sweet either.  Everyone loved it & many requested the recipe.  I left out the maraschinos since I forgot to buy them, but they're not really a necessity.

I actually just used the lemonade that comes in packages instead of frozen and it was still good. If it didn't have alcohol, I would make it everyday. Very big hit!

I would make again but use less frozen lemonade because it just tasted a bit too sweet.  I would also not hassle with the lemonade ice cubes because I think it just made it even sweeter.  Next time I will use plain ice cubes with the cherries in each one.

This was yummy and my guests liked it too. Didnt do the orange slices. Very easy to adjust to taste by adding more sprite or wine.

This was soooo good, lots of compliments on it.  I like a strong pink lemonade, so I would probably add a third can of pink lemonade concentrate next time (just personal preference though), but really tasty and refreshing!   Oh ya, and I used white wine (Dr. Zen Zen)

ever since the first time I made this, it has been a repeated request when friends come over. sometimes I make a batch just to have in the fridge, and have a glass or two before bed instead of regular wine.  delicious!!!

Made this exactly to the Letter and it is good. Please note that many of the frozen lemonade cans come in 12 oz cans.  The recipe calls for 2 (6oz) and 1(6oz) cans. Do the math if you are not using the right amount then I can see this drink being 2 sweet. I purchased 2  (12oz) cans. I used one can to fill up 2 ice trays and the other can to make the punch.

This was good - next time will make with just one can of pink lemonade as I used a shiraz and it was pretty sweet.  I also froze the marchino cherries and surup into the ice mold and that surup may have over-sweetned.

great punch, with mild alcohol content, I made it close to the recipe , think I used a cab sauvignon for the wine.  I froze the lemonade and cherries in a small mixing bowl to get a frozen agent to fit in the serving container.  The only problem was that it went sooooooo fast.

I served this at my book club, and we drank every last drop and wanted more! The ingredients sound like they would not be good in a mix, they are wonderful. I followed the suggestions of others and used one can of lemonade mix. It was still very sweet. Will make again...and again!

I made this for a Panty Party I had for a friend the weekend before her wedding. Everyone LOVED it! I'm glad I bought double the amount so I could refill the jar! I used just 1 frozen pink lemonade, the sprite, and wine. I used 2 bags of frozen mixed fruit to keep the punch cold and simply sliced up a single orange and lemon (had plenty to spare) for flavor and decor. Kept it cold all evening without watering down the flavor. Was just the right amount of sweetness. It had a sangria taste with the sweeter wine that I bought. The recipe filled the jar perfectly for one good round. I had about 9 guests and we drank about 1 and a half jars worth (there was another drink offered as well) so plan accordingly! Everyone asked for the recipe. Will make again

I thought this was just OK – next time I would probably try it with a white wine. The ice cubes made out of lemonade melted very, very quickly, so if I made it again I would just put the maraschino cherry in regular water ice cubes .

This is one of my favorite summertime sit by the pool sipping drinks.  Try experimenting with different kinds of red wine for a different taste.
