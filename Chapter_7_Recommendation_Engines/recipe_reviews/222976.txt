Low calorie meal that delivers great flavor!  I didnâ€™t have the called-for seasoning nor lemon juice so I substituted standard pepper and rice vinegar in the same proportions to taste.  Served it over a bed of baby leaf spinach. Delicious!

I followed the recipe with the exception of feta cheese instead of mozzarella. It tasted a bit bland to me so I added dried mint, marjoram, and basil. Then I thought that I would use some of the Mediterranean fruit that I had on hand so threw in some chopped dates and figs and a potato that I had left from the  Russian salad that I made Fri. So after all of those additions, it was fantastic! That's why I gave it 4 stars. It is a wonderful basic start to a great healthy filling salad.

Great!  I substituted mozzarella with feta and omitted the olive oil, seasoning & lemon juice - I just added some zesty italian dressing and it was yummy!

Great flavor in this salad.  I didn't have mozzarella so used shredded Mexican blend cheese instead.  It did help to let it marinate a little in the fridge to help blend the flavors.  I served it over fresh baby spinach.  Overall, quick and a really nice side.

Excellent recipe and health to boot! I cut up some marinated artichoke and red pepper with it. Also used feta cheese instead. Ate it for lunch all week and left me feeling full and satisfied.

Excellent, quick summer salad!  Added broccoli slaw I stead of cucumber, and a fistful of raisins.  For the dressing, I added balsamic vinegar and 1 packet of equal.  Best if refrigerated overnite for flavors to blend.  Have already made again!

Nice side dish to serve with the Mujadarrah I made. I subbed cilantro for the parsley and rice vinegar for the lemon, as I didn't have either! Will for sure make again!

This was delicious!  I don't keep fresh parsley in my fridge, but I always have cilantro, so I subbed that.  I also had sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella and used hierloom baby tomatoes.  So good!  Even Grumpy, who proclaims to hate chickpeas liked this salad and took it in his lunchbox! :)

We all LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this!!!!! I mixed it up earlier in the day and put it in the fridge to allow the flaovrs to blend. I've never used the Goya(R) Adobo seasoning w/ pepper, but I will never be without it again...soooooo good! The flavors all complimented each other well...this is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This one is a keeper!  Very refreshing and tasty.  I made it to the recipe but added 1/2 of a red pepper.  Truly delicious and great for a picnic as a cold salad.

This was a yummy salad, a good side dish to many different meals.  I left out the red onion as we do not care for it.  I used the mozzarella as called for, but feta would be a good substitution.  I think the olive oil could be reduced a little.

A great light dish.  I use a Greek seasoning mix instead of the adobo.

Absolutely delicious! I recently started LOVING chickpeas so I've been trying a bunch of different salad recipes. This is by far the best! I had never used Goya Adobo seasoning before this and I'm sold! This salad is so easy, yet full of flavor. I love the addition of mozzarella cheese. I did find it slightly salty, but I did not use low sodium chickpeas, so that was likely part of the problem. This is a keeper!

I made this pretty much as written except I forgot to add the cheese.  It was great without it, but the next time I will add it.  I really liked the brightness of the parsley and lemon juice.  The Adobo flavored it just as well as my usual herbs.  Thanks Goya!

My friends loved this and keep asking me to bring this dish for an appetizer.  I couldn't find Adobo so I used cider vinegar/balsamic vinegar and soy sauce with olive oil.  Also, I found mozzarella pearls - tiny balls of fresh mozzarella . The cucumbers keep this dish light and refreshing!

Very tasty.  Like most recipes on here, it needed tweaking a little for my own preferences (used cavenders Greek seasoning, more lemon, and a generous amount of salt and pepper).  All that said, it was nice and I appreciate having a good recipe to riff off of.  Thank you very much!

9.20.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222976/mediterranean-chickpea-salad/ ... I'm hesitant around chickpeas - mostly the feel, eyeballs - but I made this & distracted myself with pretty colors while I tasted.  ;D  I liked.  Rather than lemon juice, I used white balsamic vinegar.  Nice, light salad with some protein.  :)

I could probably eat all this in one sitting. I absolutely love it. I left out the onion and traded yellow and orange peppers for the cucumber. Definitely cut back the olive oil. I wouldn't even do 1/8 cup.

Easy to find ingredients and no problems to assemble. I peel the cucumber and remove the seeds from the tomatoes in addition to the cucumber. I have been using mozzarella balls for the cheese. I added capers and a bit of brine for that salty bite.  Vinegarette was made with equal parts of lemon juice, olive oil, and red wine vinegar (about 2 ounces each, which is typically how much juice a lemon has). Added dried parsley, tarragon, and salt.  Turns out great every time!

Good salad. I liked the different textures, the softness of the chickpeas, the crunch of the cucumber, the chewiness of the cheese.. I didn't have any adobo so I just seasoned the salad to taste with salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano. Also threw in some chopped radishes and some Kalamata olives. This amount made 5 servings as a side salad.

Easy healthy salad. Nice and light for the summer, but enough protein to make it filling. I substituted feta for the mozzarella for a little more tang! Added colorful bell peppers as well. I travel often for work, and this salad is easy to prepare ahead, grab and take for a nutritious lunch! 2 thumbs up!!

This was amazing. Would decrease olive oil and we removed the cheese to be lower cal. Great flavor and my daughter wanted to eat it all in one sitting!

Made this up with CSA items and a can of chick peas.  My 17yo son said, "individually, I don't like any of these ingredients, but this is really good."  I used a Chipotle seasoning in place of the adobo and add about 1 tsp sugar to the dressing.  Also used 2 cloves fresh garlic in place of the onion since that's what I had.  Thanks for a healthy and easy meal!

Overall it was good. If I prepare it again I'd definitely swap the mozzarella cheese for Feta, and add a bit more salt.

I substituted artichoke hearts for half the amount of chickpeas. They were terrific in this.  I used balsamic vinegar for my acid in the salad. I used mozzarella cheese sticks for the cheese and cut them in 1/2" pieces.  Lastly, I added fresh basil for half of the parsley. Was going for more of a Italian take, like a caprese salad. The chickpeas kind of gave the salad an odd texture. Not bad bad overall.

I really enjoyed this salad! I'm dairy free right now, so I skipped the cheese, and I substituted cannelini beans for the chickpeas (just wanted a different consistency of bean today.)  Excellent-- can't wait to eat it tomorrow, when the flavors have meshed even more.  FYI, I also couldn't find Adobo at the store, so I googled it and made my own...

good recipe and I agree with another person who said to add gets cheese for a kick. I used oregano, garlic powder and basil - thanks again to another revier and it was delish! I plan on adding tuna for more protein.

I liked it, however I felt it needed more seasoning. I didn't use any cheese cause I am trying to limit. I would suggest for of a dressing rather than just lemon and olive oil.

Very tasty, very quick. I followed the recipe all but for omitting the parsley because I had none on hand. The seasoning mix really has a good flavor.

very refreshing and nice compliment to an Indian curry I made.  I used basil and oregano for my spices since I do not have Goya seasoning available.

I loved this recipe!  I made it tonight with parmesan-crusted halibut, and it was a great dinner combo.  I will definitely be making this again.  And again.  And again.

This was really good!  And a great way to use up some of the fresh garden cherry tomatoes and cucumbers.  I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any and only used 2 Tbsp olive oil (because I don't like much dressing on salads).  It tasted better after it sat for a while and let the flavors blend.  And so healthy!!

I liked this. It was so quick to mix together. I have tried some somewhat similar recipes, but liked the addition of the cubed mozzarella cheese. It made it more filling, like a complete meal. I would be happy with this for lunch, with something small on the side. I followed the recipe exactly just subbing chopped tomatoes and I cubed the mozzarella 1/4." I like how the Adobo seasoning gave the lemon juice and olive oil a little extra flavor without being too strong like some seasonings. Edit note: I have made this at least 3 times since trying this the first time. The olive oil, lemon juice, and Goya seasoning is just a good combination. I like to halve the mozzarella and onion and even a little extra parsley is good. I have added corn and different beans and have even used the dressing with just cucumbers and tomatoes. This salad is fool proof. Just serve it fresh, as with any salad with the dressing mixed in with the vegetables.

Very tasty, I added more lemon and seasoning.  My 2 year old daughter loves Chick peas, especially when they're seasoned.

Instead of using the Adobo seasoning, we used our own mix of pepper and garlic powder. We also splashed it with a bit of red wine vinegar which gave the salad a tangy taste which was very good.

Tried this recipe tonight, the cucumber got lost somewhere on the way home from the store, so we didn't have that; I think it would have made a great addition to this dish though! I also just made up a lemon/olive oil dressing with a few dried herbs I had laying around; I drizzled a little over my plate and that was great for me. I think doing as recommended and tossing the vegetables in it would have made the dish too greasy for me.

My 2 year old approved and actually ate some (a lot of times she won't even try a dish, so I was pleasantly surprised when she ate a few mouthfuls!) but my picky husband didn't like it and couldn't really place why - he listed a few things and basically it sounds like he didn't enjoy the flavour combination.

If you like chickpeas, this is a great meal! Next time I would use cilantro instead of parsley, but that's just a personal preference.

Overall I think it turned out great and although I probably won't be making it again for the family (since my husband didn't like it) I would definitely consider making it again, if it were just for me and someone less picky than my husband!!!
