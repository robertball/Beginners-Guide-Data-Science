I used the Magic Bullet to puree the dal and chiles (several batches) which made it much easier. The recipe makes A LOT more than 15 dosas! I served them with the Zucchini Chutney (recipe on website). It needs an interesting sauce to 'finish' the flavor.

Turned out pretty well. I just used ground cumin instead of whole as I did not want seeds just like that this time. Leftovers can be made into uttapam by laying out a little thicker and adding fresh chopped onion garlic and cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!
