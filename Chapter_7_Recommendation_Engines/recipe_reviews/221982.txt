A neighbor gave me some fresh collard greens from his garden.  Seriously, these may be the best collards that I've had, either homemade or in a restaurant.  Two things that I really liked about this recipe are the rich flavor that the chicken stock adds and the little kick from the fresh jalapeño peppers.  I know many people add crushed red pepper flakes to collards, but the jalapeños brought a different flavor (I added a pretty good sized pepper).  And the fact that this is a slow cooker recipe, keeping me out of the hot kitchen at dinner time, is a bonus.  Served with a splash of vinegar at the table.  3 D's Mom, thanks for sharing your recipe, we really enjoyed it.

The only changes I made to this recipe was omit the jalapenos due to personal preference & I used the chicken stock throughout the recipe. I did not use salted water as directed. Also added onion to the bacon. It was delicious & the family loved it!

Made it pretty much exactly as the recipe stated, except I used premade bacon pieces and 2 tbsp of saved bacon grease.  My first attempt at collard greens, and it came out better then expected.

loved it! Made it just as the recipe follows because I love spicy foods! Turned out delicious and not as spicy as I thought it would be. Maybe because the peppers weren't as hot as they could have been. Will definitely make this again!

I was making this to go with baked ham.  I cooked it on the stove for a couple hours and used chorizo instead of bacon or ham hock.  Greens are soo very good for you! I also like to sprinkle a little red wine/ balsamic vinegar.  Yummy!  Thank you 3's Mom! You know I will make these often.

The only thing I added was a little Tabasco sauce for a little heat. other than that, it's turned out to be the best collard green recipe ever. Even better that what I remember my mother made. She would be so proud of me.  I've  turn  on some of my friends to the recipe and they all say the same thing, Awesome.

great flavor and so easy! I used a mix of collard greens, mustard greens, and kale. Also, cut bacon into little pieces prior to cooking and added onion and garlic to it.
