This was amazing! I followed the directions to the 'T' only making one change; instead of plain water with the pudding, I used cold coffee. It was so rich and delicious. My father said it was the best cake I've ever made.

This was a great frosting.  I used Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake from this site instead of buying the cake from the box.  My husband would not shut up about how much he loved this cake.  It was my first ever scratch cake and icing.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very easy and very tasty!  I didn't read through the directions well at first, and panicked because I didn't have the required (total) 90 minutes of chilling time.  But, mine didn't need that much time and turned out just fine.  I chilled the chocolate/pudding mixture about 20-25 minutes, but only chilled the chocolate/whipped cream mixture about 15 minutes, which was plenty.  I think I slightly over-whipped my cream, which may have contributed to the extra stability of my mixture, but it worked out and great. :-)  My husband REALLY loved this, and I will make again.

I didnt use this as frosting, I used it only for a layer of mousse in between two layers of chocolate cake.  It is perfect for this!  It is very easy to make, and very tasty!

I used a doctored chocolate cake mix recipe from the cake doctor cook book and then made the frosting as directed. My daughter commented that it was the best frosting I have ever made and addicting!  I will be using this recipe again and again, it really is very good and very easy.

I did a combination of receipes, as i have my fav. chocolate cake receipe already. I used this for the mousse receipe and it tasted FANTASTIC!  I would have Rated it as a 5 star, but the whole cake (made 4 layers of cake, 3 layers of mousse) wasnt able to hold its form at all. I used the outside part of cheesecake pan to put around the whole cake to hold it up. Even being in the fridge for 18hr, when the metal form was lifted off, it started sliding. (I now know why when you order Chocolate Mousse cake, they are individual and have the clear plastic form on the outside holding it together)

sooooo good JUST how it is. i made this and added a layer of mashed fresh raspberries in the middle of the cake. soooooo delicious. i also had a bunch of the mousse left. so we sliced some strawberries and snacked! YUM!  note: i used this in a cake covered in fondont. it was gooey and ripped the fondont so this isnt the greatest for frosting if you need to cover the cake with fondont. it may be ok if you let the mousse sit for a while so it isnt so gooey. (but it may not be as good then)

Thank you, this is a great recipe! I took the advice of one of the other posters in using the fabulous fudge cake recipe, because I could then change the portions a little easier since I only wanted a small cake.  The mousse is delicious and I recommend using it as a frosting/filling.... or as I had some left over I just used it as mousse.  Absoluely delish!

I just used this recipe for the frosting and tweaked it a tiny bit.. Used a semisweet dark chili chocolate for a kick.

I tried out this recipe for the first time yesterday and it turned out amazing!! The chocolate moose frosting was super delicious and I even thinly sliced strawberries and put them in the middle layer and some on top of the cake too!! It was super yummy, I would defiantly suggest this recipe!

My daughter requested a chocolate mousse cake for her 11th birthday and I decided to try this recipe after reading the reviews. It was super easy to make and the 10 girls at the birthday party devoured it. I saved a piece for my mother and she said it was to die for! I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good!!!! Made it for my foods class and shared it with my uncle and his family- the kids loved it and so did we!! The frosting is perfectly sweet and was whipped to prefection!The chocolate pudding mix really adds to the flavor and smell of the cake!
