This is an excellent breakfast or brunch fun but easy food.  I do not chill mine and cook them in oil verses the butter.  Serve with powder sugar and or whipped cream.  Great and impressive.

This was my first attempt at crepes and I thought that they were just okay.  A tablespoon of anise extract seemed like too much.  I couldn't taste the orange flavor at all and my husband said that they tasted "mediciny," but maybe anise just isn't our thing.  In the end, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and then squeezed some lemon over that and that seemed to sufficiently cover up the mediciny taste.

I used only 1 tsp. of anise extract and found it was the perfect amount.  While the taste was amazing, I had a lot of trouble working with the batter - it tore even as I spread it.  I may try adding these flavors to the basic crepe batter recipe to see if I can duplicate this recipe without the tearing.
