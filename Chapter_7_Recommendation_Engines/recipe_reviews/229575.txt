I loved it!  I placed Torani Sugar Free Coconut Syrup in a mug, heated the milk with 2 packets of Splenda (I like it super sweet) and frothed it with an immersion blender. I then poured the frothed milk into the mug and placed it in my Ninja Coffee Bar. I selected Cup Size, Specialty Brew and wound up with this beautiful layered drink, sprinkling cinnamon over the top.

I did not have espresso but I do have a Keurig. I warmed the milk with the coconut syrup and the cinnamon and added it to my coffee cup, then brewed the coffee from my Keurig into the coffee cup. This. Is. Delicious.

Yummy yummy!  Different and delicious!  I used a little bit less milk as I don't like my coffee as creamy.

This coffee flavor combination was different. Not so sure, I like the flavors of coconut, coffee, and cinnamon together. Only change I made was using coconut cream as I find it equally as sweet. I also whisked the milk to make it frothy. I think, it would be rather flat otherwise. It's not a bad recipe, just don't care for the flavor combination. Others may like it though. Citrus fruit and coffee has never worked together for me either. I guess, I just like the coffee taste to be dominate in the drink.
