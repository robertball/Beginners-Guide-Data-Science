I took this to a family reunion and got rave reviews!  I did change a couple of things, though.  Instead of potatoes, I used frozen hash browns (32 oz bag) and 2 fresh containers (10 oz each) of Alfredo sauce.  I probably added a little more swiss and parmesan than called for but it was great!

This dish was delicious and went a long way.  The milk really brings out those onions though, I might use less next time.

I was intrigued with this recipe, so I had to try it. Part of my job is to create interesting and new recipes and I really liked the basis of this one. I gave it 5 * because of the changes I added to it. I par boiled my potatoes whole for about 15-20 min. Just until fork goes in fairly easy when tested. Cooled completely. I used klondike gold potatoes. I used really large ones. I used Bertolli alfredo in the jar. Used 2 jars because my potatoes filled a 13x9 dish pretty full. So I doubled all the ingredients listed. I didn't use the onion because too many in the family don't like them. I added mined garlic about a tsp. Added italian seasoning. I don't measure but it was a good size pinch. Along with the parsely. Did'nt add any salt because of the salty cheeses. Added a lot of black pepper and cayenne. Added a bit more swiss and fresh grated parm.than called for. Baked about an hour. 15 minutes before I took it out I topped it with more swiss and parm and sprinkled with panko crumbs and stuck it under the broiler. Everybody raved about these at our Easter dinner! As far as I was concerned it was the best part of the meal! Thanks for posting!

Tried this recipe for an elegant side dish with Chicken.  They stuck to the dish pretty good, even tho it was sprayed well, so you have to watch them on that.  We liked them, but I would add maybe a bit more Parmesan than I did.  I also covered the dish with foil for the first hour, then removed it for the last 15 minutes, & sprinkled Paprika on top for a little added color.

These were very very good.  I used one of the other suggestions of using 6 potatoes and cutting the milk in half because I used an 8x8 dish.  I also added garlic powder and used pizza cheese instead of swiss. The only thing is next time I'd let them bake a lot longer.  They weren't as tender as I would have liked.

I made this for a church potluck, with a few adaptations so I could use items I had on hand.  I used shredded pizza blend cheese and a light alfredo sauce from a jar.  I added a liberal sprinkling of liquid smoke flavoring.  I baked covered for the first hour and a quarter, then sprinkled more cheese over the top and browned it, uncovered, for about 10 more minutes.  It came out perfect!  Keeping this recipe, for sure.

I love this recipe! My boyfriend requests it at least once a week. I change it up now and then, varying the type of sauce, or replacing things with what I have in the house, but it comes out fantastically every time. It's become a bit of a signature dish for company. Thank you!

Okay, I took a little bit of everyones suggestions and did the following:
Use pizza blend cheese to replace swiss cheese.  For 8x8, use 6 potatoes and cut milk in 1/2.  Sprinkle some liquid smoke, add 1 tsp. of garlic powder and cook at least 1 1/2 hours.  It came out wonderful and I wish I had followed anothers advice to sprinkle cheese on top the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Was not disapointed with this one.

These were okay but I do not think I would make them again.  Maybe it is the taste of jarred alfredo sauce.  I tried adding a little cayenne pepper to give it some zing but that didn't even help it.  The base recipe is okay but I would add some cheddar mayb or tope with bacon.

Unique potato side dish. Very rich. I didn't have shredded swiss so I used mozz cheese. Got a little greasy during cooking, so if I made this again I would cut down on the butter to a few small pats.

i did exactly what most everyone else did. substituted pizza cheese (hate swiss), added garlic powder, halved the milk, omitted onions (allergic), and added extra cheese and cooked 10 extra minutes. The top was golden brown, the potatoes were tender but not mushy, the sauce was the perfect consistency. i was thoroughly impressed with it all. thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty.  I made a few changes due to what I didn't have at home.  Left out the swiss cheese and had to sub sour cream and chicken broth for the milk and alfredo. I then added a little flour to thicken it up.

I made this last night for my family and we all liked it.The only thing I have to add is that I only had to cook mine for 45 minutes and it was done.Thanks for another use for the jarred Alfredo sauce!

this recipe is not complete.if using an 8"X8" square pan, change quantities to only 6 potatoes and reduce milk by half. i also added a teaspoonful each of italian seasoning and garlic powder.
delicious!

Perfect,every detail of recipe is great, the only change is pre-cook the potatoes for 20 minutes in boiling water, let them cool and  then slice and add to recipe, total cooking time is still about the same, but potatoes will always be tender.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my son liked them so much.  He even ate them as leftovers.  The cooking time was much longer than what's reccommended.  I cooked them on convection 1 1/2 hours.

Didn't have time to bake this dish so I used this same recipe only I precooked the potatoes and made a mashed potatoes version! I also left out milk, precooked the onion in a bit of butter and added some garlic, then beat until smooth with electric mixer. Went well with italian herb grilled chicken breasts. My whole family including the picky ones loved this. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe because I had some Newman's Own alfredo sauce to use up and wanted to make something besides another pasta dish. This was outstanding! If I made it again, though, I might try leaving out the butter. This is already really rich with the sauce and the cheeses; not sure it needs even more. The onions really make it!

I really liked this. I really need new side dishes so I am thrilled that this was good.  I used a 32oz pkg of southern style hasbrowns (chunks not shredded), I used mozzarella and mixed cheese instead of swiss.  I could really taste the cayenne pepper andI will probably use less onion next time or I will cook the onion first.  I used less then 1 jar of sauce to cut down on some of the calories and I would like to try and make this local.  It was great a few days later to.  I would like to make a meat casserole with this as a base.  I may use shredded next time since some of the potato chunks were a little bland when bit into.

These were OK, I probably wouldn't make them again, but not because they were specifically bad...just kind of bland for me.

I cubed the potatoes and left out the other cheeses, but it turned out great!  I love alfredo and potatoes, so this dish was heaven.
