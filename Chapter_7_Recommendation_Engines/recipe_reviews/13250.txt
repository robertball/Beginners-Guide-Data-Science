This was one of and still is my favorite soup. A lot of people think because it has duck blood in it that it is gross. But honestly, it is the best soup in the world! The best way to explain the taste of this soup is like a sweet & sour soup, you can add more sugar or more vinegar. All depends on your taste

Mother's is always best, right?  So I agree with most ingredients except the heavy cream.  It's just too heavy and too risky for a fruity soup with vinegar and lemon flavors!  Also, I put in onions and garlic and celery leaves and bay laurel leaves.  I put all the fruits, spices and vegetables in together with the duck and then strain the soup in a cheesecloth-lined colander. Then add the blood and thickening as expertly directed.  It's an all morning process, but so worth the trouble.  Especially with the homemade kluski!  My family eats the potato kluski by the ton!

I have made a similar recipe but never with any dairy.  I can not purchase duck's blood.  I found a German recipe that is similar and uses port wine.  I've made it this way several times and was pleased with the result.

Tried this and loved it. I'm from Wisconsin and we'd go to polish fest, someone always made this and I miss it. More recently I buy the 'kit' from upstate NY from a place called Redlinski meats, or buffalofoods.com. It's expensive, so I usually buy two kits to save on shipping and it's a more rare treat. I've never added flour and I don't remember adding heavy cream, maybe plain yogurt for that tang. I always top it off with sour cream too. A note to those first making any type of duck soup, the duck needs to simmer a  fairly long time or else you will have a bear of a time getting the meat off the bones.  Although Redlinski's mixes the blood with vinegar to prevent clotting, I usually add a bit more, again for that sweet and sour flavor with the fruits and a touch of sugar. Love it! Blessings all! Dobra!

I rarely make changes the first time I prepare a recipe, & I didn't this time, either. I loved this recipe! As it was not hunting season, I got a duck from a local farmer, and the vinegar did prevent coagulation, just like she said it would. The interplay of all the flavors, and the subtle richness of the sauce was incredible.  I will definitely make it again. I can hardly wait for duck season, when I can make it to my heart's content.  I fear some people will be hesitant to procure a freshly butchered duck, which is a shame, because they will miss out on a truly glorious dish. Thank you, thank you, for submitting this recipe.
