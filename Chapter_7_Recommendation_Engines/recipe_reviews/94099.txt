This is my families favorite veggie recipe but after the bacon gets crisp I add 1/2 a diced onion, cook 5 minutes then add fresh green beans (about a pound or two).  My neice loves them better when I add 1/2 pound of new potatoes.  Yum.

This has been served in our family for years.  It is the only way I can get my husband to eat green beans!  Canned green beans is the only way to go with this recipe, and I usually add 1/2 diced sweet yellow onion.  Fantastic!

This is a very good way to cook green beans. However, I do have a couple suggestions based upon the way I make them myself. For anyone who hasn't ever had beans cooked in this, or a similar type manner, I would first suggest that you begin with ONLY  a TEASPOON of sugar, and increase the amount of sugar based upon your own family's personal taste. Like some other reveiwers have mentioned, another really good addition is a bit of diced onion. One final addition that really seems to tie all of this together & really takes this dish 'over the top' is to add a splash or so of some apple cider vinegar. Again, the amount that you add should be done to taste & based upon the taste preferences of your own family. Don't worry, a splash or two of vinegar will NOT make your beans taste vinegary in the least, it only enhances & ties together all of the other flavors in your dish & makes it a much more vibrant & flavorful way of cooking traditional green beans. (Even if you do end up making a mistake and add too much vinegar for your taste you can always cut any sharpness by adding just a bit more sugar. Another way is to just increase your cooking time a little bit more. By doing that, you'll 'cook off' any of the unwanted excess vinegar, and your dish will 'mellow' itself right back out. Plus you'll get the added benefit of your beans becoming even more tender for you with any entended cooking time you might add.) Hope this helps!

This is a wonderful way to make green beans!  I omit the sugar and add 1/2 of a medium red onion to the pan and then add 1 tablespoon of butter at the end to finish it off.....fabulous!

O. Wow. These beans are sooo yummy. I grew up with mama growing & canning our beans, and now my husband and I do the same, so my entire life I've eaten green beans at least once a week :)  
I dont know why it's taken me this long--I'm 27--to figure out this is the best way to make them!
I gave it four stars for the changes I made, but it got my wheels turning and is a great recipe by itself.
I cook the bacon, put it aside to drain (then I drain off some fat depending on how much is left), cook very thinly sliced onion in the bacon fat for a few minutes. THEN I add the sugar--Brown Sugar! I let it cook and caramelize a bit, then I add the green beans, partially drained and the bacon that I've crumbled. I like it in still fairly large pieces. 
Really...these are awesome, and I make them very very often. My husband and I struggled to eat a jar before...often I would throw half out. Now, we eat it ALL!

Great recipe!  After the bacon was done, I add diced onion and garlic.  I also cut the sugar in half.

I used precooked bacon and then added some unsalted butter to make up for the bacon grease that was missing. I used frozen whole green beans and this turned out well. It was a little sweet but not obviously so. This was really good and I will definitely be fixing this again with fresh green beans the next time. This is a wonderful way to showcase those summer beans fresh from the garden. Thanks I really enjoyed this dish.

I have friends and family that only like canned green beans.  This is a wonderful way to dress up the ho-hum!  Suggestion:  Cut back a little bit on the sugar and use smoked thick sliced peppered bacon.  The sweet/spicy thing is great!

Super easy recipe and tastes great! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I did not add the recommended amount of sugar right away, then added to taste, and I found a happy medium!

These were delicious and so easy!  I didn't have any bacon but I did have the pre-made bacon pieces and they worked just fine.  You could add garlic and onions or whatever you wanted to this.  Thanks for an easy solution to boring old green beans!

Awesome - I'll never just heat up a can of beans again!! The first time I followed the recipe exact (half for only 2 people), second time I added a chopped up fresh mushroom and some sliced onions. The extras will probably be added from now on, but this recipe is fantastic. Thanks so much!

Southern Fried Green Beans Haiku: "Pretty tasty beans! Can't go wrong with the bacon, which I left chunky." I didn't dice my bacon, as I'd prefer it less like baco'bits, and more like bite-into-it-bacon. Also added some minced garlic too. This was a nice way to dress up canned green beans (which I'd normally eschew for fresh or frozen), but ultimately, I was pleased w/ this as a side dish to finally finish off a lonely can that I had hiding in the pantry.

My husband and children do not like green beans, but they ate these! I used turkey bacon just because it was what I had on hand. I think real bacon would be better. These were great. Thanks for posting.

This was a great recipe! Especially when you're trying to make green beans more interesting. However, I'd put just a teaspoon of sugar as a tablespoon was a little  too sweet. I highly recommend this recipe if you want to do something to make your side dish  a little different and much tastier than just coming out of the can.

I made this receipe.  I followed what other reviews suggested and used bacon bits, added fresh yellow onion and garlic.  And used only one teaspoon of sugar, granted the caramelization is much less, but more sugar would have been overpowering to flavors.  Family of three grown men cleaned the whole pan and were quite complementary!  Thanks for receipe.

These were yummy. I used 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and added a onion. I didn't get the caramelized cause I added a can of green beans without draining cause I got ahead of myself. So had to cook the water down a good bit but still turned out great. Will make again.

ive made these three times now. green beans seem to be about the only veggie my family wants as a side lately. the second time i made them i deviated from the recipe a little bit. i used less bacon ( 2 strips i snipped with a scissor) and i added a splash of bottled italian dressing. makes sort of a sweet and sour green bean. very good.

This is exactly what everyone says it is. Easy, quick, and absolutely yummy. I did like most said and cut the sugar to 1 teaspoon and it was fine. I didn't add onions because our guest doesn't like onions. I will add them next time and I bet it'll be even better. It was FINE without them though. MAKE THIS Y'ALL!!!!

Good!   Green beans are not my favorite but this  recipe made them good!  I added a bit of onion and cut back on the sugar to 3/4 tablespoon.

Wow! Even my kids who won't touch green beans loved this. I had to make more the next day. I cut down on the sugar, but the dish was still great.

These were awesome!!! I made them to go with the garlic prime rib and wished I had doubled the recipe.  I did add 1/2 of an onion while cooking the bacon.  Will definitely make again and again.

I used precooked bacon crumbles, 1/2 an onion chopped, and a heaping tsp minced garlic sautéed with a pat of butter then added 2 cans of green beans and it was delicious

Only missing the onions. This is the only way I've cooked green beans for years and the only way my kids and grandkids will eat them.

This was the best new dish I have done in a while! I did change a few things, though. For starters, I omitted the sugar. Then I drained half of the bacon grease prior to mixing in green beans. I used a fresh ground peppercorn mix rather than regular ground pepper. And lastly, I added 1 tsp of a McCormick-type steak seasoning. Served with pot roast and whole potatoes.

Made this for about 100 people at our church and they loved it even those who thought I was crazy when they saw me pouring in the sugar.  Definitely going into my favorites.

Big hit with the family.  My daughter in law who is a great cook honestly thought they were fresh beans.  I read the reviews and took the advice to cut back on the sugar and added a splash or two of apple cider vinegar.  I let them sit covered for about 1 1/2 hours and rewarmed them when we were all ready to have Thanksgiving dinner.  I was asked to share this recipe.

Tasted great! My hubby doesn't usually eat canned green beans. He loves this recipe! I took another reviews advice and added apple cider vinegar the second time I made this. It made it come together even better!

I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it in half to feed only 2 people. I am Southern, but I really prefer much less bacon grease in my food. Not bad though.

We loved these green beans.  However, next time I would drain off some the bacon grease.  I added sweet onion chopped fine & after it was all sauteed, I simmered the beans with a lid on pan soften (about 5 minutes).

These turned out great!  I've been trying to make green beans that tasted anywhere close to the way my grandmother made them (she's from KY).  This was the closest I've gotten. Delicious!

Yummy! The best I've made! And easy! I used the "real bacon - recipe pieces" since I don't like frying up bacon in the house very often, plus it's just easier and saves time. I think it tasted just as good. Plus, added a sprinkle of slivered almonds for some crunch at the end. These were just sooo good. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My husband loved this. I did not use the sugar, but added a tablespoon of butter right before serving. Flavorful and so much nicer than out-of-the-can green beans alone!

These were really really good!  The sugar adds a nice twist! This will be a staple in our house for now on.
