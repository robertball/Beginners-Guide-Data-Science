My family loved this!  The sweetness overtakes any flavor from the zucchini.  The only disappointment is that it doesn't use very much zucchini.  Garden growers tend to have a lot of zucchini.  Overall, it was delicious.  My kids and husband asked me to bake them another one.  We also topped ours with vanilla ice cream.  Yum!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this pie! Everyone who has tasted this pie loved it! I have even passed out the recipe! So far I have made 5 pies with the only change being a little extra vanilla! ( I have had the recipe 2 weeks, lol) DO NOT doubt this recipe. DO NOT stick up your nose to the fact there is zucchini in it this recipe is AWESOME! :) Getting ready to go make another one now....

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't think that zucchini sounded appetizing in a pie, but I was willing to try...and I'm glad I did.  It definitely doesn't taste like zucchini.  It's just like a custard pie with a sweet topping.  It was also extremely easy to make.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this pie today following the recipe exactly.  Unfortunately my husband and I thought it was the worst "pie" I'd ever made and I'm a great baker especially pies.  There is no way we felt it had an inkling of apple pie taste.  I'll stick to zucchini bread or a savory zucchini pie.  Very disappointing overall and wouldn't waste my time with making this again.

This was the first time I tried this recipe and it was wonderful!  I took it to a covered dish dinner and everyone loved the pie! Will be making again next week for a family picnic!
