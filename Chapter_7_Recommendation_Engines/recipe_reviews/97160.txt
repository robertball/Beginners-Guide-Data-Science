This lasagna recipe is AWESOME!  My mom, who isn't a big fan of lasagna, loved it as much as I did.  However, I'm only giving it 4 stars because I changed a bunch of things, according to what I had in my kitchen.  Instead of 2 cups of onion, I only used about 1/3 cup.  2 cups seemed a bit excessive, in my opinion...  I used Prego spaghetti sauce instead of the can of crushed tomatoes.  It was easier that way, since you don't have to add anything else to the sauce.  If you're using spaghetti sauce, you'd have to use about 1 1/2 jars (26 oz. jar) of sauce because the amount of tomatoes (28 oz.) called for in the recipe wasn't enough.  I used a 8 oz. bag of mozzarella, and a 8 oz. bag of Kraft's Classic 4 Cheese Melts, instead of just plain mozzarella.  Dried parsley flakes worked well in place of fresh parsley.  I kinda forgot to add red pepper flakes, but the lasagna still tasted wonderful.  For my first time cooking lasagna, it turned out pretty well.  Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe!  ^_^

This recipe makes a lot of food, so we had leftovers. It is really good, very cheesy.
