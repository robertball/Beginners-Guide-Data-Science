This had to be one of the easiest salads I ever made.  And it tasted good too.  I used medium shells instead of macaroni because I had it in my closet.  Also, used Fat Free Mayo (and I always like to cut the calories).

But I like a lot of flavor, so I also added about a half cup of chopped onion and a half cup of frozen corn.  Also, put in about a Tbsp of chili powder for more Mexican flavor.  Then right before serving, I sprinkled chopped cilantro on top.  Yummy!!
 
I will definitely make this again.  And maybe use black beans as someone else suggested.

I was worried about this one before I tried it -- it seemed pretty odd. I followed exact recipe directions, including the black olives, which really added a lot to the flavour, and hot salsa (Herr's brand). If I had to do it again, I would do it with medium salsa, since it was a bit hot for me. I tested it out on college-age friends and they seemed to really like it. The recipe is not as creamy as I am accustomed to in a pasta salad, but one could always add more mayonaise if that is desired. I think choosing a good brand of salsa is key to this recipe -- many of the salsas on the shelf looked machine-made. This came out as mostly pasta with a little bit of the veggies here and there -- those who prefer a more varied mix may want to add red and yellow pepper and perhaps even some cucumber. Good constitution though, nice proportions, and has a very 'surprising' effect on those who eat it. Nobody expects a pasta salad with zip!

I made this for a party of about 40 people.  I doubled the recipe and added a few extras, i.e. the black beans, corn, chopped celery, etc.  This was way more than enough for our group.  I don't think I'll double it the next time, but a least I had some great leftovers to take home and enjoy.

Greetings all! :-) Thank you for trying my recipe and for your reviews. I love to read how others have taken one of my recipe and added to it, to make the recipe their own. The addition of corn, black beans, green onion, etc... all great ideas. Most recipes are adaptable to variation so never be afraid to experiment, that's what makes cooking fun. And when someone says "I love this, can I have "YOUR" recipe?"... now that's a great feeling.

This salad needs to chill for at least a few hours before serving. It isn't very good otherwise. The dressing is a very odd shade of pink and I was nervous to even taste it. I didn't like it when it was first done, but after an hour it was tasty. I think a whole teaspoon of garlic powder (the brand I have anyway) would be WAY too much. I used about 1/4 teaspoon. I added a can of kidney beans and I think they balance out the salad visually, texture and flavorwise.

This recipe was a big hit at my neighborhood potluck!  I did have one problem though- I had only 1/2 cup of mayo, so I used 1/2 Kraft Miracle Whip with the mayo.  It created a great sweet contrast with the hot salsa!  Also, using Rainbow Rotini was very festive and appealing to the eye!

This is a keeper!!! I made the salad just a little while ago to go with the tamales we're having for supper. It was delicious even before the flavors had a chance to meld. I used tri-color spiral pasta and added black beans, Mexi-corn, cilantro, chives and a can of mild green chilies. I used Pace medium salsa. I omitted the black olives because husband and son don't like them. I'm thinking next time I might add some cooked chicken to make it an entire meal.

Excellent macaroni salad!  This is so easy and it tastes like it was sooo hard to make.  I will make this over and over again.  I took advise of others and added the corn and black beans which was a great balance of mexican flavors.  Highly recommend this for potluck socials...it'll be a hit!  The black olives are a MUST!

Great starter recipe - I added two tsp's Chipolte Chili power, shredded sharp cheddar and a tsp of cumin. Next time, I'll probably add black beans, corn, maybe some roasted red peppers. Very easy to make this your own!

This was a wonderful salad. I did add and take away a few things. I put in spicy green olives with pimentos drained and chopped, 3 oz each of black and green olives added also was one package of taco seasoning mix, I used one cup of sour cream (you can add more sour cream of you want) instead of mayo also the tri color macaroni for color. I used a very good quality salsa that was home made. Eliminated the chopped green bell pepper. I also added 3oz of sharp cheddar cheese and 3oz of pepper jack cheese.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!!  An excellent idea and a wonderful and tastey dish!!  I didn't use green peppers or olives, but I did add some sweet corn, black beans, a hard boiled egg, tuna, and chili powder for more of a kick.  At first I was unsure because it wasn't looking too tastey but OH WOW did it taste good.  THe next day when it was cold it was TO DIE FOR!!! I LOVE IT!

This salad is definitely missing something.  Next time I make it I will add additional spices.  You could also be creative and add a lot of different veggies, like green pepper, black olives, etc.

This is just too spicy.  I used 1 1/2 cups of Krafts Olive oil Mayo,
1/2 cup of fresh pico de gallo.  
Used hand made pasta.  Picolino oilves, pimentos, celery, green pepper, capers and some anchovies.
Mixed and let it stand a day prior to serving.
The original recipe was just tossed.
No one liked it.

You have recipes that you would give five stars to, then you have very few like these that deserve six.  This is a fantastic recipe and here's why.  1.  It really is as easy as it says.  The only downfall is having to wait til it's done refrigerating!  2.  I love recipes that I can easily make from things I already have in my kitchen and not have to run to the store. And the best one is 3.  It was one of the best macaroni salads I've ever tasted!  My husband went back for seconds and my 15 month old who is as picky as can be gobbled this up without even realizing she was eating veggies!  I had to make more the next day because my husband was already asking for it.  The only thing I did different was not add olives, since none of us really like em that much and the second time I just added onions that I had leftover, which was a nice addition.  We also prefer it with medium salsa, as even my toddler could tolerate it and it had more of a bite than mild.  Six stars!

Very good! Added some chopped scallions, cubes cooked chicken and chunks of pepper jack cheese to bulk this up to full meal. Lots of yummy flavors. I used orange and yellow peppers and also added some reduced fat ranch dressing to kinda "moisten" it up the next day. Used mini wagon wheels instead of elbows....great summer pasta salad. Thanks!

Followed recipe exactly and we all loved it! Great base recipe.  Will try it with black beans, grated cheddar, etc.  Couldn't be easier to throw together with items you already have on hand.  This one is a summertime keeper!  Thanks!

I tried the recipe as written and although it was good - I thought it needed a little something more.  I added two chopped green onions, a can of drained and rinsed corn, 1/2 tsp of cumin, & 1/2 tsp of chili powder.   I let chill about 3 hours and it was perfect.  Mine was not saucy at all, but, clung to the noodles.  It did receive mixed reviews in my house -I thought it was great, but,  my husband would have given it a 3.  He thought he may like it with a less firm pasta like a bowtie.

This was an interesting change-up to the traditional macaroni salad. Made it according to the recipe the first time and while the flavor is good (after sitting overnigh) it is much better if you doctor it.  I've added corn and pepper jack cheese.  I'm not a bean fan so went with chick peas instead for texture.  With additions it's even better.

I added a few other ingredients and spices to kick it up a notch and used Miricle Whip instead of Mayo.  Your basic salad though was a great place for me to start :-)

Fast, easy and has some zip!  I like it because it uses things I generally have on hand.  I might try a chipotle salsa...or add some cheese next time.  A good change up over "regular" macaroni salad.

I think it was all the mayo that made us dislike it so much, maybe 1/2 sour cream would have made it better?  Sorry, but I would not recommend this.

An awesome recipe! My husband doesn't like green pepper, so I omit that. He loves olives, so I double them. This recipe is great because you can just eyeball the amounts for the dressing - you want to make it to your own taste, anyhow. I like to add a little bit of finely diced onion (or green onion, if I have some), and I only use about half the salt (because I love salt, and I'm trying to cut back on my intake). Thanks so much, Joslyn, for an excellent recipe!

I liked this recipe it was a nice change. I used a medium chunky salsa and added chopped green onions and finely chopped celery for a little added crunch. Everyone enjoyed it. Next time I think I will add some corn. This recipe is easily adaptable to whatever might suit your taste.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I don't like black olives so I omitted them and used a can of black beans instead. I also used miracle whip instead of mayo. Made it with my cooking class of developmentally disabled adults and they loved it used a medium salsa and the heat was good.

This is a quick and easy salad for a potluck or party. I made this for the Super Bowl and it was a huge hit. Great taste will defiantly not disappoint.

It was very good. I added a few dashes of Cayenne pepper and about a cup of finely chopped up cilantro.

I thought it was too bland.  I tried to buy a "good" brand of salsa too, but I still prefer more flavor in my pasta salads.  I added beans and corn as others had suggested, but it still needed more.  After eating it once, I added some taco seasoning, french dressing, and additional salsa, but the flavor was just still too bland for me.  Everyone's taste buds are different!

Recipe for me is 4 stars as is, 5 stars with modifications. As others stated, this is a great base recipe. I opted for half cup mayo, half cup sour cream and seasoned with fajita seasoning as well as the garlic. For an extra kick, I added about 10 splashes of Tapatio hot sauce. For texture, I added Santa Fe flavored tortilla strips and black beans. Next time I think I'll make with ground chicken for an even more fulfilling meal! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is delicious! I did add about 1/4 cup chopped green onion, 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes and about 1/2 tablespoon chili powder for a kick! I only gave 4 stars because next time, I would do 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream...the full 1 cup of mayo was a tad overpowering. Aside from that, I will definitely make this again!

Hellman's put out a similar recipe to this a few years ago and I've always had good comments about it.  I also add some "extras" and a blob of lowfat sour cream to make it creamier.

This is a great base recipe to adjust to your liking.  I think using mayo is better if you plan to eat this for a couple days (it becomes less runny), but sour cream works well if you are going to eat it up right away.  Instead of salsa I use petite diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, onion.  I also add green onions, fresh garlic, and some hot sauce.  Instead of olives, I like to add a little avocado and lime juice.

I substituted sour cream instead of mayonaise. Besides the green bell pepper, I also used red bell pepper. I took a small can of corn, drained it and then heated it in a frying pan until crunchy. Shredded cheese was mixed with all the other items and then the pasta was mixed in. This really made the tasted different and wa la, very good!!!

What a fantastic recipe! My husband said it was the best mac salad that I've made yet! The only thing I did was add corn since I love it in salads...loved this recipe just as it was. Will definitely add this to my recipe box!

I would make this again especially if I were doing a mexican theme.  I used medium salsa and the next time I would use a hot one. What I did was add hot sauce to it since it was not spicy enough and I overdid it and I completely forgot about adding the olives.  My fault.  Thanks submitter.

I liked this a lot and will make it again but I had to make some changes:  I used 1 cup lite sour cream instead of mayonnaise and I added 8 oounces of shredded mozzarella.  I also didn't think it tasted good cold but it was good heated up.

I JUST made this and it's soooo good! Wow, what a suprise! I didn't measure anything- just added  until it was good. I didn't put green peppers, but added some dill weed and it makes a nice flavor. I can't wait to eat more of it with my supper!

5 stars with some modifications.  I skipped the olives, but added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and a lot of cumin and cilantro (dried, but fresh would be even better!).  A very good change from traditional mac salad, plus, a lot healthier.  Will make again - thanks for the great idea!!!

This is a great starter recipe, and I followed directions first time.  
But because we all want to add our personal touch, I used 2 cloves fresh garlic, added 4 slices bacon, plus pickled jalapenos.
This is, without changes, a five star recipe, thank you Joslyn H.

I loved this salad! Very fast, easy to make, and addictive. I didn't have any bell peppers the day I made it, so I substituted celery, and it worked well. *When* I make it again, I might do bell peppers and celery.

Well I don't like pasta salads normally but I loved this one. I halved the recipe and didn't have the black olives but finely chopped pimento stuffed green olives and I loved it! This is going to become a family favourite.

This is absolutely delicious!!! I was a little nervous about trying this because I hadn't thought of mixing noodles with salsa. It is now a family favorite. My niece gets super excited when I bring this to Sunday dinner. She always gets the leftovers!!

Yummy!!  I did modify (by adding some ingredients) the recipe some, but I think it would still have been yummy without the changes.  I added a can of corn (drained), a can of Black Beans (rinsed), 2 cups of Shredded Cheddar Cheese, and some Chili Powder to spice it up a bit.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Made this last night to take to a pitch-in this evening and it was liked by all.  I read each and every review and tweaked it just a little.  Instead of 1 cup mayo I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip.  Instead of 1 tsp garlic powder I used 1/2 tsp and I added 1/2 tsp chili powder.  This makes a very large bowl of macaroni salad.  I know I will be making this again and again.  Thanks Joslyn for a wonderful recipe.

We really enjoyed this macaroni salad. A nice change from mexican rice that I usually serve with any mexican dish. I added diced onion in with the green pepper. I think this would be even better with sour cream in place of the mayo. I used a hot salsa which made it even better. I had curly pasta cooked so I used that. I will make this again, so easy with so few ingredients.

I really liked the idea of this salad but thought there could be more to it--so before starting anything I read all the other comments noting all the great ideas. One thing I did that no one else added in their comments was that I substituted sour cream for mayo--I use a ratio of 1:2 salsa and sour cream for chip dip and love the flavor. I thought it would be an excellent creamy and zesty sauce for this recipe. In this instance I used an equal portion 1:1 ratio for the macaroni salad. Loved and used the beans, corn, celery, onion and cilantro additions as well!

easy to prepare.  I used whole wheat macaroni and cut back the mayo to 3/4 cup(used light mayo) and added extra salsa (hot kind), can of black beans and a can of fiesta corn(as suggested on previous reviews).  My family enjoyed it!

My husband actually made this, so it must be easy LOL. Seriously, this is a very good salad and easy to make. He followed some other reviewers advice and cut back on the garlic powder, added in olives (though he used whole, pitted small olives), added in the red kidney beans
and used a medium chunky salsa. We will be having this again...this is a keeper. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Very easy and tasty! Everybody liked it, and I liked the fact that it wasn't the typical rice served on the side.

One of my favorites.  I added a can of rinsed black beans as well.  The salad is so good even before it is chilled.  I used Pace medium salsa.  So easy too!

This is very good - and previous reviewer is right that it makes a ton.  Even half of the recipe provided salad galore, so I'll be feasting on this for the next few days.  I did, like others, add corn and I also threw in some cumin, cilantro and juice from half of a lime.  Additionally, I just added salt to my pasta water and nixed it in the salad...It went well with the fajitas I made and I can definitely see myself making this one again in the future (it would be super tasty with the addition of black beans as well).  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I liked this one....It makes alot so I might have to cut in half next time.  Leftovers are good but.....this was a little excessive.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  Smelled so good I couldn't wait for it to sit in the fridge before eating it.  It tastes just as good hot as it does cold!

Loved this salad as did the rest of my family. I didnt have any green pepper so I threw in some frozen peas and it was great.

the mac, mayo, green pepper and garlic powder, salt and pepper wasn't too bad by itself -- you could add marinated chicken or tuna to it and have a nice lunch. Throw in some fresh peppers for a little punch. 

Overall, this was just okay.

All though it didn't look appealing, this was a very good recipe.
