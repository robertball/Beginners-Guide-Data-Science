I loved these! I followed the submitters advice and did not stir the batter while it rested. Consequently the majority of the butterscotch chips fell to the bottom of the batter. The last pancake was bursting with the chips, while the others had only a few chips. Nonetheless they were still delicious. Next time I will stir the batter and see what happens.

Instead of mixing the chips in the batter sprinkle them on the pancakes when you put them on the griddle before you flip them over. I always do that with chips, blueberries, etc.  in my pancakes. It comes out much more evenly.

I did't have buttermilk so used 1 cup yoghurt 2 cups whole milk and used 3 eggs.  Then mixed 1/2 c whole wheat flour with 1&1/2 cups all purpose flour, cinnamon and other dry ingredients - BUT only a scant tsp salt.  Also didn't have butterscotch chips so used mini-choc chips. I doubled the recipe as we had 6 kids and 6 grownups. I should have tripled it! Delicious, not  crumb left.

These pancakes are delicious and I've already made them several times. I used white chocolate chips (didn't have the Scotchies) and one time didn't have buttermilk so did the vinegar and milk substitute. It worked, however, like the buttermilk one's better. They are my favorite pancakes now and would highly recommend every pancake lover to try this recipe.

I'm a pancake addict and have many recipes.  This is one of my favorites.  I make it as written except for upping the vanilla and using whole wheat pastry flour.  They come out moist and fluffy and have incredible flavor.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes sweet pancakes.

I misjudged what I had in the pantry and had to make these with sea salted caramel chips instead of butterscotch. The wife and I both loved them! Thanks for sharing!

Loved them!! One of our favorite recipes! We don't use any syrup, they are sweet enough alone. Sometimes I pre make the batter and keep it in the fridge over night, which makes the batter even thicker.  Consistently good!

Pancakes, but something different!  I halved the recipe (there's only two of us), using the smallest egg in the carton.  I have old-fashioned and steel-cut oats in the house, and thought these might be toothsome, then found a packet of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal (so I cut out the brown sugar), and made sour milk with Lactaid and red vinegar.  The integrity of the recipe withstood my pantry!  These probably do well with just whipped cream (no syrup); serving bacon complemented the sweetness.
Oh!  And never add solid items (chips, berries, nuts)  to pancake batter  - add after the batter has been poured onto the griddle.  This solves a lot of issues, from portion allotment, to over-stirring the batter.

Love these!  There are my 81 yr old mom’s favourite!  If given the choice she would have these every day, served up with homemade applesauce.  I’ve made the same adjustments as many have already stated; less salt, milk with vinegar, and whichever chips I have on hand added once batter is on the griddle.  I also use margarine and have found that I prefer not melting it before hand as the dough can be a little thin. They’re even great without the chips!

These were so good. My husband doesn’t like pancakes, but he loved these. He even asked for them the next weekend. I didn’t have buttermilk, so substituted with milk and sour cream. I also took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled the butterscotch chips on top while frying. Yum!

Made this for the Grandkids!  Only change was I Just added chocolate chips  after the batter rested and I was pouring them on the griddle.  ( did not have butterscotch chips). They loved them!!!  I never got to eat any.  Suggest making a double batch.

I omitted the brown sugar and changed the chips to mini chocolate to show that you can  changed it up and it  still comes out great!

Great recipe! It was a nice change from traditional pancakes. The only thing I did change was I mixed the butterscotch chips into the dough instead of folding them in. The pancakes are on the sweet side so no need for a lot of syrup, I did drizzle a few thin lines of syrup on them and it was perfect. Definitely will be making this again.

I found these to be a little too salty.  They were also extremely soft, which made them difficult to flip.  They weren't terrible, but I am not going to make them again.
