when i checked for my recipe, i noticed that it had been changed a little.
I takes a total of 5-6 cups flour.
It has to be refrigerated at least 2 hours before baking.  (Instead of refrigerating you can put dough or the prepared item in the freezer for future use. You just let it thaw before baking).You bake the rolls or bread for 30-35 min.
I hope everyone likes this recipe.

Thank you so much!  This is wonderful!  We are a gluten free family, and this recipe was a lifesaver!  I was able to use this recipe frozen for make Marcia's Famouns Sticky Buns (on this site) and my family LOVED them!  We have a holiday tradition of sticky buns on Christmas morning which went away with the gluten intolerance diagnosis, but this recipe saved the day!  By substituting Kinnikwik mix for the flour and making just a few changes, I had the whole crew raving.  My daughter even asked for these for her birthday!  I added one extra egg, 2T xanthan gum, and 4 envelopes knox unflavored gelatin.  I rolled the dough into balls and froze them first on cookie sheets, then put them in freezer bags. Now I can pull out as many as I need.  I may try a less sweet version for dinner rolls, the texture was that great!  That's a real compliment with gluten free baked goods!  Thank you!

I halved this recipe and ended up with a decent sized loaf.  I just baked it without refrigerating for two hours and it still turned out great.  This is one of my favorite bread recipes.

I cannot say ENOUGH good things about this recipe!  It makes WONDERFUL pizza dough and yummy dinner rolls!  I mixed all the dry and butter in a pan, put the egg and water in my bread machine, dumped in the dry and let it mix - superb!  I don't put mine in the fridge - just use after letting it sit for a few minutes.  And, to make dinner rolls, use about 2 oz. of dough, roll, and put in muffin pan.  I like to drizzle mine with some EVOO.  When they come out, you can eat then, or you can store (I use an old bread bag).  When you want to eat them, put butter and garlic salt on them, heat in the oven, and NUMMY NUMMY!!!

I used this recipe to make fry bread because I like the sweeter dough...it tasted fabulous!!! My friends couldn't get enough of it! I altered the recipe slightly so I could use my bread machine to make the dough. I added the first four ingredients (flour, yeast, sugar, salt) into the bread machine. Then I melted added the warm water and let that sit for just a minute while I melted the butter. Then I added the melted butter. Whisk the eggs and add to mixture. Then top with remaining flour. My bread machine did a pretty good job of mixing in everything, but I found I needed to add a little more flour when I went to roll it out. I am definitely keeping this recipe on file and will have to try it with other recipes.

This recipe is GREAT!  My husband loved it.  I devided the dough into small rolls and let rise.  I did not refridgerate at all.  I just punched down the dough and let rise again and then baked them for 12 minutes.  I will use this recipe again.

My family flipped over this recipe!  I used half to make a yummy loaf of white bread, and used the other half to make small cinnamon rolls by rolling out, smearing with margarine or butter, and sprinkling generously with cinnamon and sugar.  The flavor of both was excellent!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent!  I used all whole wheat pastry flour, and rapid rise yeast  and then followed the rest of the recipe perfectly.  I divided the dough in half and made croissants for dinner and threw the other half in a floured baggy in the fridge overnight.  I pulled it out rolled it a bit and put butter cinnamon and sugar on top, for cinnamon rolls.   They got HUGE in the oven and wow they were amazing!

Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.
I made cinnamon rolls that were refrigerated overnight before baking and they turned out perfect.  I will certainly be adding this recipe to my collection.

I used to work in a bakery and this is the closest recipe I have found to the sweet dough they made. It is the absolute best for making pepperoni rolls. The combination of the dough and pepperoni work beautifully together. My husband and son(4) can't get enough of this!

My 12 year old daughter wanted to try making bread, I found this recipe and she did a great job. We live in a humid climate so sometimes a little more flour is needed. 
It's simple and delicious.  Her older brother's friends seem to end up at our  house when she's baking it.  Her Grandma wants her to use it to make cinnamon raisin bread.  Maybe we'll just experiment....

Very simple.  It made wonderful cinnamon rolls.  I just used some dairy-free margarine (I have a child allergic to milk products) and it was perfect for us.  Thanks.

I put all the ingredients in a bread machine and set it on the "dough" setting.  Of course the water (in my case milk) and butter go in first.  Next, the sugar and salt.  Next is the flour and then the yeast on top. It makes a beautiful silky dough that is perfectly sweet on its own or for your favorite sweet bread recipe.

This makes the best bierock dough. I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup; it makes 16 medium bierocks. It is so dependable and delicious. I had lost this recipe (the print version with many uses and water spots) when I cleaned my counter, but am so glad I found it again on the web site!

I must have done something wrong. . .I read all the 5 star reviews before doing this recipe.  I just bought the yeast today, so I know it was good.  The dough raised during the 20 minutes, but when it was punched down and put in the pans, it didn't raise at all.  I made cinnamon rolls, dinner rolls and coffee cake.  The half hour baking time was too long--The rolls were too dark and very hard.  I will try it again.  Live and learn!

This is the best and simplest sweet dough recipe I have ever tried.  I had ribs in the oven when I decided to make some buns and they came out beautifully even thought I didn't put them to rise for the two hours.
(I did put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven to aid with the humidity.)

I've made my share of breads/rolls through the years but this one takes the prize.  Easy to make and oh, so consistently light in texture.  I used a large plastic bowl to mix and was able to knead it in the bowl and then covered and let rise in the same bowl.  Dough is easy to work - rolls out nicely for crescent rolls.  My family snarfs these down in no time flat!  Making again tonight to serve with pot roast, mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans which is their favorite meal.  Please note I did change one thing:  Used 1/2 water and 1/2 milk for the liquid.

I love love love this recipe. Although the amount of flour in this recipe is way off. I made a batch of sweet dough in my kitchenaid mixer and found I had to add an additional 2 cups of flour then turn it out on the counter for a light dusting before letting it rise. The dough turned out wonderful after all. I made rum cinnamon rolls and got raving reviews.

I really liked this recipe - I don't know if I'm nuts or not, but I had to add add'l flour, like 3 cups worth. It was just too sticky to rollout without it. I used it for making cinnamon rolls and turnovers. I will definitely make again and see if somehow I did something  wrong (add too much liquid?). Anyways thank you!

Great recipe.  I made cinnamon rolls and what we call scones (fry bread-where you take a golf ball sized piece of dough, flatten it and fry it in a bit of oil, flipping when underside is golden brown to cook both sides) and both were delicious!

I used this dough to make baked brie, and it was perfect. I halved the recipe and then only refrigerated for about 1/2 hour. Then I put the block of brie in the middle, wrapped it up, and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on top. It baked for about 20-30 minutes (until the cheese softened). And I've gotten tons of compliments on it. Thanks!

Very versatile dough, I can imagine myself making all sorts of things with it. Soft, pillowy and yummy. =) I'd use an extra 2T of sugar, but that's just personal preference.

UPDATE: JUNE 22: This dough makes excellent garlic bread too!

No changes. Have made it twice. Each time was with my daughter for her famous Apple Cinnamon Roll Cake, which has been the highest seller at our church’s auction. Very easy and forgiving recipe, and it tastes great.

Fabulous dough.  The recipe is perfect as is.  This can be used for just about anything.  Our family favorite is to make small loaves and let each person put in a couple treats - chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, cinnamon & sugar, fun colored sprinkles.

I made this in my bread machine and it was easy and perfect. Great taste too. I made cinnamon buns. I followed the recipe and chilled the dough. The only change I made was a touch of butter extract to match the light sweetness of the dough. I only made half the dough as that was all I needed.

Delicious! One suggestion: add the yeast to the warm water in a small bowl first and let it sit for a few minutes, then add it to the rest of the mixture - comes out PERFECTLY!  Thank you very much for this recipe!

Great recipe! I did use 5-6 cups of flour & only 1/2 cup of sugar.   Great dough foe Bierocks!

Wonderful recipe!  This is my new fav!  I did a few things different.  I made 3oz. Dough balls and spaced them 2 inches apart.  I brushed the tops with egg wash and sprinkled them with salt.  I also thought 30 min was way too long.  I put them In for 15 min.  Success!!!

I used this dough to make our New Years "Pretzels".  It is a very wet dough and I was concerned that it wouldn't rise well.  Once in the oven, itrose prefectly and mine was very dense.

OMG. This dough, made into rolls, is officially the household favorite. After one batch! Okay, so I tweaked it a bit. I used 1/2 cup coconut flour, 1/2 cup oat flour, 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum, 2 cups whole wheat flour, & 2 cups bread flour. I used 1/4 cup sugar & 1/4 cup Stevia (in the Raw), instead of the 1/2 cup sugar (hubby's diabetic), & 1/2 cup canola oil instead of margarine, because I'm out of butter. I let it rise in the warmed oven for 10 minutes & it doubled in size. I rolled it out & cut it into 12 pieces, then re-rolled them each into a nice round ball. Then I tossed them into a muffin tin (buttered, which is why I'm out), & let them rise in the warm oven for another 20 minutes. They're so fluffy! Baked @ 375°F for 20 minutes, and they've been referred to as Ninja Rolls (disappear quickly & without a trace) after a few bites (hubby & his brother). I think I'll keep the changes I made to the dough recipe, because of our dietary requirements, but I would like to thank Ms. Dunlavy for this awesome recipe.
