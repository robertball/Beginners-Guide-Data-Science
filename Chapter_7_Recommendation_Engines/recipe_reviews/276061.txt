I followed this recipe as directed, using a dab of milk instead of cream at the end. 

It was good, but lacking something. I wish I could put my finger on it, but it needed to be thickened and have some sort of additional flavor. 

Still I found it quite edible, and had a little more then two cups of it for dinner.
