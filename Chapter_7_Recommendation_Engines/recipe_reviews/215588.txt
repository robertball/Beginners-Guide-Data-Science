The nutritional breakdown on this recipe intrigued me, and I had some very ripe peaches and bananas which needed to be used soon.  I used Truvia for the sugar substitute, and although the peach-banana portion of the dessert was very good, I didn’t care for the cobbler topping.  The recipe says to “...pour batter,” but it was so thick, I just had to drop spoonfuls on the top.  And that’s OK, but I was disappointed in the taste of the topping.  Followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using regular Georgia peaches (what I had on hand) instead of white.  Really wanted to like this, and although the recipe writer says it's good for diabetics and it may be a compromise that person's willing to make, it's doubtful I’ll make again.  I’m the first reviewer, so I don’t want to discourage others from trying, personal taste is always a factor.  SandiNicol for sharing your recipe.

I halved the recipe. 
Used whole milk instead of skim. 
Used honey as my sweetener. 
Only used 3/4 of a banana. 
Used half baking soda and half baking powder. 
Let the fruit mix rest overnight. 
Garnished with brown sugar and whipped cream.

Nobody but me was willing to try it. 

Parts of it tasted like banana bread where the topping and a banana slice were touching. The peaches were mushy and turning to sauce. There was almost not enough topping to cover the fruit. 

The only positive I can give it was that it was simple to make.

I do not know what I did wrong but the topping didn't puff up it just stayed the way it was when I put it on top.

I put honey instead of sugar, butter instead of the oil, whole milk instead of skim milk, mango instead of peaches (out of season), real vanilla instead of extract (boiled the milk with it) and half the salt. Thanks!

I like the addition of bananas to the peach cobbler.  She's right, without the sugar you really taste the fruit.

I made this recipe as written w/ only 1 exception. I can't do dairy so I sub'd rice milk for the nonfat milk (it seemed the closest in consistency). I didn't have the same problem as the other reviewer w/ the batter being too thick. Mine seemed just like what i would expect. I used agave nectar for the sugar substitute. I only gave this 3 stars b/c I wasn't huge about the bananas. I also thought the cake topping seemed more dense than i would have liked once cooked. I will probably make this again but will do only peaches next time. I will probably also add some nutmeg and will research whether using baking soda instead of powder (or a combo of the two) will fix my issue w/ the topping.
