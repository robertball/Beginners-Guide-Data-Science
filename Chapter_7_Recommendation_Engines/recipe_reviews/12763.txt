This was pretty good--I loved the topping!  Next time I make it I think I'll cut down on the amount of melted butter that's poured over the lobster.  I'm also going to try adding a little bit of garlic powder to the melted butter.

I served this at a recent ladies' luncheon in very small ramekins as a side dish with a wonderful steak salad submitted by Linda on this website. I felt the dish might be too rich for large servings. My ramekins held about 1/4 cup, which was just perfect for the ladies. I reduced the amt of melted butter poured over the lobster by half after reading other reviews. Even the gals that hate to cook took this recipe home with them.My group gave you 14 thumbs up, Gina. Way to go!

Oh my gosh!!!!!!  This was DELICIOUS in every sense of the word.  My hubby thought we were dining out at the Red Lobster...only this was better!  This one is a keeper for sure.  Next time I make this, however, I will cut down on the amount of melted butter, and add some garlic to it.  Thank you so much for this one!

Wonderful recipe! I cut the recipe in hlaf & then divided teh lobster among two large ramekins. I topped the lobtser w/ chopped garlic (did give it a quick saute in EVOO) & Old Bay. I was out of bread crumbs so I whirled up stuffing mix in my food processor. Loved teh extra flavor the seasonings in it added!  I strted off our Valentine's dinner w/ Chambord Spritzers, Deep Fried Camembert w/ Raspberry sauce (from allrecipes) served w/ apple slices. Then for dinner, we had Raspberry Cocktail Sauce w/ Chilled Shrimp (again from allrecipe), this excellent lobster dish & white wine steamed asparagus w/ Chocolate Cherry Heart Cakes for dessert.  It was a fabulous dinner...very fitting for the holiday. Thansk for your contribution Gina Owens-Stanley!

Gilding the lily, personally.  I thought the lobster flavor was smothered by the ingredients.  A bit too rich and oily for my taste.  But, matter of personal taste, there was nothing objectionable to the mingling of flavors.  I would adjust proportions though.  Butter amount could probably be reduced significantly without affecting the dish.  Maybe it could be spooned onto portobella mushrooms for a fancy appetizer presentation?

Just awful. So full of fat and calories my clients refused it. Lobster is rich on its own so the additional calories and fat is unnecessary and plain gross. To  ad hundreds of excessive calories in the form of butter didn't improve the dryness either. This recipe is not for the health conscious person but one who has no concern for health or appearance. I swear my thighs turned into tree trunks just tasting the sampler. Dry meat floating in fat makes an unattractive dish that even a glutton couldn't stomach. Don't waste the lobster on this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! Very quick and easy to make. We used the frozen canned lobster and it was great, however we cut about 1/4 cup of butter out and it was still a little much, might add a little more lemon next time.

This was good. My boyfriend loved it. I thought 1 tbsp of lemon juice was a bit strong, but nonetheless was very tastey.

This tastes like a delicious restaurant dish. I used unsalted butter so it wouldn't be too salty and it was perfect. I baked it in a 13X9 pan because I didn't have individual ramekins.

I doubt this was ever served at Red Lobster but it is, as an appetizer at our dinner parties here in Maine.  I found this recipe years ago in a Gourmet Cooking magazine. The only difference being the addition of a pinch of dried red pepper flakes over each ramekin before baking.

Great recipe! Made four servings of this and it was enough for a main course for two. Reduced the butter by about half as others recommended and added two cloves of garlic.

Made this tonight.  Went over well with the wife.  I cut the butter in half like people suggested but if I make again I would cut by 1/4th rather than 1/2.

I will make again for sure.

I loved this recipe!  I cut the butter in half as suggested and served it with a side of wheat pasta tossed in garlic flavored olive oil, crushed red peppers and ground garlic.  The heaviness of the pasta countered the richness of the lobster.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

surely you meant butter and not margarine in your directions.NEVER substitute anything but butter in lobster recipes(and in my book, any recipes) unless you are on a strict diet from your M.D.

Yum... This was great!  I used imitation lobster meat that I put in a food processor for a second or two to dice up but it was FANTASTIC either way! We will definately make this again, it was definatly something different for dinner.  But for those of you thinking about cutting back on the butter, really dont!  I used a reduced fat Country Crock to help curb the calories, but the butter really makes the dish!

This was so easy and quick! Unfortunately, I couldn't find the lobster where I shopped that day, so I used crab chunks...but still tasted great!  Will definately use as a quick side for many meals.

Wonderful! I have made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. The second & third time I did not put the butter over the lobster. It wasn't so rich, which I prefer. I also tried it with shrimp to save on cost. Will make over & over!!

Divine!  I made this exactly as written, except divided it down to two servings.  I would consider cutting the butter at the end down by half, but it was still very good.

We cut the recipe to 2 servings and made in small soup mugs as we did not have ramekins of any size.  It was a side dish to our traditionally non-traditional Thanksgiving meal this year. I can only rate this 4 stars because we did not use real lobster but imitation instead (due to no availability of lump meat locally) and the fact that we cut the butter in half.  I think it would have put us over the edge with delight had it been real because even imitation meat in this one was AWESOME!  As many reviews suggested the butter would have been overwhelming to us had we not cut it in half.  Well worth a try!

Oh Boy! This was SO good! I rarely get a chance to eat lobster because it's so expensive here (in Oregon). I searched a number of recipe sites today trying to find a way to fix these two little lobster tails (6oz. each) so that we could really, really enjoy them. I picked the right recipe, that's for sure! 

I think that the next time I make this recipe though, I will have extra lemon to add if we want it. I also added garlic powder to the crumb topping as other reviewers suggested. Other than that, I followed the recipe other than changing it to two servings. 

I want to move to Maine so I can eat this a whole lot more than I can here! Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!
