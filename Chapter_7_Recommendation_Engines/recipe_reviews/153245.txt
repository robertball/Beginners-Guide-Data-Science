The first thing I noticed is that just about every person making these were changing the recipe to make them better so therefore they are not rating this specific recipe. I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because there are a few things I noticed that is a big no no. First for the perfect moist cupcake you should use oil instead of butter. While butter does taste better the oil will give it the moistness that is needs. The second thing was the ratio of pumpkin. I added an extra 1/4 cup because I knew it would need it. Also it does not matter whether or not the eggs are at room temperature. I use them straight from the fridge. Because I am adding extra pumpkin I just make sure that the spices are not level but instead are slightly mounded. One last thing that I add is 1/4 cup applesauce because that will also give them a great texture. To cook them, you should ALWAYS bake cupcakes at 350 degrees so they cook more evenly and then you should not bake them for 25 minutes, otherwise you will overbake them. I cook them for 19 minutes and they come out perfect. This recipe does  have potential but I have created my own recipe since I have more then 10 years of baking experience.

After following the top rated reviews I decided to make some of my own personal modifications. The result was the most MOIST, SPICY and DELICIOUS pumpkin spice cupcake I've ever had!   First, I definitely replaced the butter for an equal amount of vegetable oil- BIG contributor to the moist factor. Second, I reduced the heat to 350 deg and cooked for 22 minutes, NO MORE! Third, wait for it... I DOUBLED the pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. I know it sounds crazy but it contributes to the beautiful deep color I got and the spicy, full flavor.  Fourth, I DOUBLED the frosting recipe. I had a bit leftover but when I tried the original recipe AS IS, it was not nearly enough.  Fifth, I added an extra egg and did not worry about keeping them at room temperature. Mine came straight out of the fridge.   This modified version was STELLAR!

I just made these cupcakes and they were by far some of the best I have had in a long time. They taste and look like they were purchased from a cupcake store. I did however read a lot of the reviews, and took all the tips into consideration. Here are the changes I made for perfection:
1. Reduced Heat to 350 and baked 22 minutes.
2. Put 1 whole can of pumpkin puree (equals about 1 1/2 cups)
3. Used 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead of butter.
4. used "heaping" spoonfuls of the spice, and left out the clove.
5. used 1 tsp salt (instead of half)
6. For the frosting only used about 2 cups sugar instead of 3.

I am already heading out to the store to buy ingrediants to make these again!

WHY ARE ROOM TEMPERATURE EGGS SO IMPORTANT? A typical step in a buttercake recipe is to cream with fat and sugar and then add in the eggs, one at a time. This creates an emulsion. Fat and liquid by nature are unmixable, and the goal when mixing a recipe is to form a water-in-fat emulsion. A well emulsified cake batter, for example, should not be curdled or weeping liquid, which happens if cold eggs are introduced to a room temperature butter/sugar mixture. If the emulsion breaks, the batter will loose air cells. This results in a baked cake that is grainy or flat in texture, dry and flavorless, look uneven and may even sink......This is why she used room temperature eggs.

I am giving four stars based on the original recipe...my changes would boost it up to five.  This is a great, basic pumpkin cupcake recipe as-is.  However, as other cooks have commented, OIL is really what is needed to make a very moist and tender cupcake.  Leave butter for your full-size cakes, bundts, and pound cakes (I even have certain bundt cake recipe that are all oil rather than butter.)  I am not big on all the spices, so I kept it simple: 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, that's it!  This will sound crazy, but I also double the salt.  Why?  Because something magical happens when you add a hearty dose of sea salt to a spicy cake.  I make a spiced applesauce bundt cake a few weeks ago, and the recipe called for 1 and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I was hesitant but made it that way anyway.  It was UNBELIEVABLY good!  Now I always double my salt when using cinnamon and other spicy ingredients in my sweet stuff.  As for the sugar, I just did equal parts of white and brown.  And I made cake flour instead of using all-purpose.  This small change alone will make your cuppies very fluffy and moist.  I used buttermilk instead of whole as that's what I had on hand.  Buttermilk is great with pumpkin anyway.  And as a few others did...I increased the pumpkin by 1/4 cup, and then I added another 1/4 cup of sour cream.  It seems like a lot of moisture, but it really makes the cupcakes super moist.  I made both large and small, all turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly, which I NEVER do, but did this time, since I was making this to put out for Bunco night, and gatherings like that require full-fat goodies.  Well, they taste delicious, but I found them to be a bit dry, so next time I will use oil instead of butter and moisten them up a little more with some applesauce!  Good recipe, just not the ultimate- Yet!

After MUCH searching for the perfect pumpkin recipe I think this one is close! I added a bit more cinnamon and clove and used "pumpkin pie" mix instead of puree. I also added an extra cup of the pie mix to make the cupcakes much more moist. they are perfect! Crunchy on the outside and VERY moist on the inside!

These cupcakes were so good! I did change a few things though, after reading some reviews. I replaced the butter with oil, and I doubled the pumpkin and cinnamon. I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 min. They were so moist and tasty and the cinnamon cream cheese frosting topped it off nicely. Thanks for the recipe.

Before I tasted these but after I had them mixed up and in the oven, I looked over some of the reviews.  “Oh, no!”  I thought to myself.  “Maybe I should have used more spices.  Less spices.  Oil instead of butter.   A different baking time or temperature!  Not to worry.  The recipe as is, which is how I made it, is just right.  The cupcakes are pretty, moist, tender, definitely spicy, with good flavor.   If I have any criticism at all, it’s that if you like a fair amount of frosting, the yield is inadequate as written  - were I do make this again, I’d double it.  Also, as I always do, I took the cupcakes out of the oven a few minutes sooner than the recommended baking time and I’m glad I did.  At 22 minutes I don’t think they could have stood one more minute without being overbaked – not a good thing, especially for butter cakes.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before trying this recipe.  It seems like everyone said, "These are so good, BUT I made changes."  I followed the recipe and did not make any changes.  The result: a mild tasting cupcake.  I thought 1 cup of pumpkin was too little, and I was right because the pumpkin flavor does not stand out, nor is it spicy enough for my tastes.  

So it was OK, but don't give 5 stars to a recipe that you had to "fix" in order to make better.

Frostin was amazing!!!  Everyone loved these.  I loved how easy they were.  I read reviews before and I followed the instructions on the temp and baking time since I have a gas oven.  I baked at 350. Next time I might bake for 22 minutes.  I had alot of frosting left over so next time I'll cut ingredients in half.  I also added a whole can of pumpkin for an immense pumpkin flavor and used heaping teaspoons and 1/2 tsp. of spices.  These make your home smell so delicious.  Defintely a recipe you should make before an open house!

it is difficult to rate this exact recipe bc i changed it a bit so i will rate my finished product. when i first read the recipe and started making it, i realized it is probably more of a muffin than a cupcake. cupcakes for me are light and airy and i could tell it was going to turn out thick and heavy. i fudge a lot of my recipes and i did the same with this one. i added maybe a 1/4 c more of pumpkin and a few tablespoons of applesauce since a few of the reviews said they were not as moist. i also added a little oil to thin it out and help the moistness and a tad bit more baking soda to puff it up. the cake was ok but for me it needed the frosting. now the frosting, IT ISN'T! this is icing, thin and not pipable. so just beware when thinking about decorating the cakes. also, my oven cooks faster (read: it burns baked goods faster) than others i have baked in. so i watch my time and the cakes. i adjusted the temp due to my pan. you have to feel out your oven and know what to look for for "doneness" (when you poke your cakes, if it puffs back up it's most likely finished). i don't care how experienced a baker one is, we all have different ovens and there is no exactness to time and  temperature in my opinion.

Icing was PHENOM!  Like others said, more of a muffin.  Mine needed to be tweaked to add more spices, but I'm not the greatest cook/baker so I pretty much stuck to the recipe, with the exception of using oil instead of butter and using the entire can of pumpkin puree.

I gave this recipe a 4 of 5 because you definitely need to make your own modifications. I made these for a bake sale and they were a hit. Thanks to the reviews I read my first batch was perfect!

OMGosh! These were SO good. Very moist and had a nice cake texture (as opposed to a muffin). The cinnamon cream cheese frosting was a huge hit, although I doubled the cinnamon. I doubled the recipe to make standard and mini cupcakes for friends, work and home and all of them were gone within 24 hours.

I doubled the pumpkin and the spices, and used pumpkin spice instead of allspice - it was great! I baked them at 350 for 22 minutes and they were moist and perfectly done. The flavor of the cream cheese frosting was AMAZING! However I couldn't get it to firm up so it is a soupy consistency - still trying to work on that.

I made this recipe twice this past week. I never read any comments before I made it, so this is AS IS in the recipe.  First I made them as cupcakes and they were perfect AS IS!!!  If yours are turning out dry, you are overbaking them.  Yes, the eggs need to be at room temperature or they won't rise right and be flat. (just put them in a dish of hot water for a few minutes in their shells, warms them up great) I love all the spices, which I always have on hand and make my own pumpkin pie spice out of when needed.  the frosting was great, but don't expect it to be fluffy and pipe out on the cupcakes like the picture, because cream cheese frosting won't do that unless there is a lot more powdered sugar in it.  Two days ago I made this as a cake and also turned out perfect, took to a funeral yesterday and am on here to make copies and share with people asking for the recipe.  this is from a professional baker with 37 years experience and lots of customers, so try it as is and just don't overbake stuff.  Also baked goods take a day to mellow and actually get moister as they sit overnight, so just make ahead and don't eat straight out of the oven and it won't be dry. I can see how a little sour cream or plain or greek yogurt in the batter would make even richer.  happy baking!!

I followed the recipe exactly and wish I had read some reviews before I made them. 
True to all the reviews I thought they were a little dry and the texture more like a bread than a cake. 
If I ever make these again I will definitely add more pumpkin and spices. 
The cinnamon in the frosting didn't really add that much flavour and made the normally velvety smooth and creamy cream cheese frosting a bit gritty.

These were super tasty!!  I substituted oil for butter and doubled the pumpkin puree.  I baked them for 19 minutes at 350, and they were super moist.  I took a shortcut with the icing.  I bought cream cheese icing and mixed ground cinnamon in it.  Tasty tasty tasty!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but did add 1/4 cup extra pumpkin.  The cupcakes came out wonderfully.  Tasted great, but as another reviewer stated, they do need to be eaten the day you make them, the two I had left the next day were not as good.

I can't believe that it was only a few weeks ago since I discovered pumpkin puree.  Now I am addicted and this recipe is perfect to feed that craving!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing.  For me it was the cinnamon cream cheese frosting that just finished this recipe off.  So delicious, I know I will be making these again...

This is a great basic pumpkin muffin recipe. Be careful with some of the other advice on the reviews, the room temperature of the eggs is very important when working with soft butter, the eggs won't properly emulsify with the fat of the butter if the product is cold( like trying to mix oil and water), the end result of using cold eggs is a drier tougher product. Also judge for yourself what temp you use, I have two ovens one is a regular and one is an oversized Thermadore professional, the temp in my standard Thermadore bakes cakes on 375 and the same cake needs to be baked at 325 on my professional oven, so be your own judge. I used pumpkin pie purée in lieu of standard pumpkin purée because I prefer a sweeter spicy cake.

I followed exactly until I got to adding the cinnamon to the frosting and I added pumpkin spice instead....but OMG! These things are dangerous to have in the house. I wanted to give some to my husband to take to work and I was gonna take some to work, but I am not sure they will last until tomorrow :) Great recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Oooh my goodness! What a neat recipe. The 1 tablespoon of baking powder may seem like a lot, but I think it's designed to achieve a cup-cakey texture with so much pumpkin (a heavy, moist ingredient) in the batter. And boy it's a success! We iced with chocolate, to make kitties and spider webs (with black licorice and jelly beans). This will be on our regular Fall/Halloween baking list!

These were really good.  They were definitely more like a pumkin bread/muffin than a cupcake.  I used the "Cream Cheese Frostin II" recipe from this site to frost them (only because I've used it before and I love it).

They're just lovely - the aroma of those subtle spices, gorgeous colour and cream cheese frosting! Do use oil instead of butter, bake at 350 degrees F for 22 minutes and add more spice. I topped each cupcake with a pecan and will add a whisper of orange rind to the batter next time.

I actually went against the trend and didn't make any changes at all.  They turned out perfect as is!  I'm not sure why you wouldn't use all butter, since the pumpkin adds so much moisture.  They came out moist and fluffy.  I did double the cinnamon (as I have a tendency to do) and kept the other spices the same.  I would recommend using aluminum-free baking powder.  I used a 1/4 cup measure to fill each cup so they would all be the same size.  The frosting was the perfect cosistency for piping.

I absolutely loved this recipe as did my family! I followed DelightfulDines revisions with a little alterations of my own. I created a cake instead of cupcakes which was a great idea. Instead of creating the pumpkin spice with the individual spices I just bought McCormick's Pumpkin Spice. I added 3 rounded teasopoons of the pumpkin spice to the flour. I also added 1/3 cup oil instead of the butter. I used the eggs right out of the fridge and I added the whole can of pumpkin puree. I baked the cake at 350 Degrees for about 30ish minutes. This is definitely one of the yummiest cakes I've had in a very long time! Can't wait to make it again at Christmas ;)

I thought these cupcakes were very good, but I did make a few mistakes (which were fixed). I halfed the recipe and used a mini cupcake pan (plus 2 regular size cupcakes because I had just a bit too much batter for my pan). I baked them for 19 minutes at 350 degrees per the suggestion of another reviewer. I should have taken the mini pan out at maybe 17 minutes because the outside crust was a bit tougher than I would have liked (but it didn't burn). However, the 2 that I baked in the regular size pan were perfect. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I didn't have any cloves or allspice, so I subbed 1/2 teaspoon of apple pie spice. Cupcakes turned out tender with a mild pumpkin flavor. However it really does make a difference to use room temp eggs if you use butter instead of oil. I made the mistake of using them straight from the fridge, and once I mixed the eggs and milk with the sugar-butter, my batter "curdled" and separated (evidently, this happens when you mix cold eggs with room temp ingredients). Instead of throwing it all out, I simply popped the wet ingredient bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred it again, and it came out perfect. Next time however, I will substitute oil for the butter as other reviewers suggested and probably can bypass this snafu in the future. So here's what I learned:
 1. Bake at 350 for 17 min with mini muffin pan or 19 min with regular muffin pan
2. Use room temp eggs, but 30 sec in microwave can fix "curdled" wet ingredients.

I made these cupcakes to share with friends for a birthday celebration and they were wonderful.  My only recommendation would be if you have a gas oven to take the temp. down to 350 and bake for 25 minutes.  I made one batch and cooked for 22 minutes at 375 and they weren't as moist as the 2nd batch I cooked at only 350.

The BEST!!!  My whole family loved these cupcakes!  Also, I wasn't sure if I should fill the cupcake pan 2/3 full or not, so I filled them almost to the top and they came out perfectly with none having run over.  I will make these again and again!

The cupcakes were great, but it was the frosting that was mind-blowingly awesome!  I made these for a party and they were a big hit.  I did add some mini chocolate chips to the cupcakes because everything is better with chocolate.

I love this recipe! I doubled the recipe (I wanted to use the whole can of pumpkin up!), and they turned out great! I'd recommend to NOT double the frosting recipe though!!! I have a lot left over!!
I took them to my college students, and they LOVED them!!! Thank you!!!

These were AMAZING. I followed the recipe almost exactly except instead of cloves and allspice I just used pumpkin spice because i didn't have the other two. But still they baked nice, were light and fluffy, and the icing was to die for!! I will definitely be making these in the near future!! A+++++!!!

I followed another reviewer's recommendation, and added two cans of pumpkin, 3 eggs, and doubled the spices. These were so good! They were very fluffy, pumpkin-y and all good fall things. I did not include the frosting, as these were yum on their own, and my toddlers did not need the extra sugar. These were a huge hit, and I will make these bad boys again. Thanks for sharing!

Didn't really care for this recipe.  Cupcakes were dry (I even added the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin).  Didn't really like the frosting either.

I made this recipe today. Since I am gluten free I used gluten free flour blend and added an extra egg. These were moist and so delicious that you'd never know they were gluten free. They had just the right amount of spice and the frosting is to die for! Definitely making this again!!

I really liked this recipe. The batter was thick and creamy. I filled exactly 23 cupcake liners half full. They baked in 25 minutes rising up and giving a nice brown top. The cake itself has a nice mild flavor and with the added sweetness of the cinnamon cream cheese frosting, it gave a good balance of flavors and overall - a pleasing treat for the fall! I would definitely make this again.

These are the best pumpkin cupcakes I've made. I followed the recipe exactly as followed. I'm not sure why so many altered the recipe.  The ONLY thing I changed is the baking time.  I set the time at 20 minutes. They're perfect!

I used pumpkin pie spice in about the same quantity as the recipe specified rather than the recommend spice combination. It turned out great, moist and delicious. It tasted like a pumpkin pie flavored cake. Lol :) thanx for sharing!

nice flavor.  nothing out of the ordinary.  Maybe I will try eliminating the ground ginger and adding some crystalized instead.

Made these to take to a meeting last night and they were raved about! Because of a lacking pantry, I used canola oil instead of butter in the cupcake recipe and all white sugar with no brown sugar. I made the frosting recipe with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and these little gems came out perfect! Thank you to Javaru!

The cupcakes were moist and delicious but I only had to cook them for about half the time that the recipe called for. Some of my family loved them and some thought they were a little to spice-y.

Great recipe, and received a lot of compliments! Thank you!!! I did change a couple of things based on some comments. First I did leave the butter instead of replacing it with oil, as some suggested. But I used 1 cup and changed a couple of other things; 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of salt, 1-1/2 cups of pumpkin. And for the frosting I used 2-1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar rather than 3. It was terrific!

MMMMMH!!!! These cupcakes are divine! Let me start with the icing. The highest compliment came from my husband who HATES frosting. He was practically licking the bowl after I made it. I did take the advice of many reviewers and used a whole can of pumpkin, heaping spoons of the spices, 1/2 cup oil and 2 cups of powdered sugar instead. I baked at 350 for 23 min. Perfect. The cakes were moist and delicious on their own, but the icing totally seals the deal. I will be taking them to my mom group. I did make the icing last night, and plan to frost them as I am walking out the door.

I can't give this a full five stars because I changed the recipe as others recommended. However, with those changes, this is a definite keeper! They are absolutely delicious. I baked at 350 for 19 minutes. Also, I omitted the butter and used 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead for increased moisture. I added 1 can pureed pumpkin and doubled all the spices. With those changes....PURE YUMMY!!!

Very good! I halved this recipe, added more cinnamon to the cream cheese frosting & used light cream cheese instead of regular. I made miniature cupcakes & they baked perfectly in 10 minutes. I wish I would have added more pumpkin to the batter, but the spice mixture was great. Everyone likes them... Because of the cream cheese frosting they were refrigerated & we found they tasted best chilled. Over all very good, all I can say is if you're a big pumpkin fan you'll want to increase the amount you put in the batter :) I will make these again.

This review is for the frosting only. I had made the 4 egg yellow cake that is also on this site and was a little disappointed in it and needed to do something to 'salvage' it. This icing rocks! It made my so so cupcakes delightful. My family and coworkers loved them. The icing recipe is def. a keeper. Going to make the pumpkin cupcakes for halloween, can't wait to try them. I do know now that even if they suck the icing will rescue them!

I made both the frosting and cupcake as written.  Very flavorful, tender cupcakes. I thought the cinnamon in the frosting sounded like a nice touch, but it largely tasted just like plain cream cheese frosting. I frosted some of the cakes with a maple cream cheese frosting, and preferred that one on these cupcakes. Thank you for sharing the recipe, and I would make these again!

Just what I was looking for! These were so yummy! A tad on the dry side, will add some oil or applesauce next time. The frosting... out of this world! I have made so many different cream cheese frosting recipes but I have never had one that asked for butter. I think this may be the key to their super deliciousness!

These are delicious! The recipe only calls for a cup of canned pumpkin, so I just freeze the rest of the can for a batch later on.

I made these cupcakes last week and got RAVE reviews.  I didn't have 3 cups of icing sugar, only 2 1/4 cups which made the icing taste more cream-cheesy.  Everyone commented on how yummy the icing was.  I would make this icing for cinnamon buns, spice cake, coffee cake...it is deeelicious.  Also, I used canned pumpkin, not pumpkin puree.  Not sure if this made a difference but the consistency of the cupcake was dense, more like a loaf than a cupcake but still so good.  The kids gobbled them up!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful and tasty autumn treat.  This will be an annual tradition for sure!

I have made this recipe twice in the past couple of weeks.  They are very easy to make and tasty.  I made mini-cupcakes and the recipe made 48 cupcakes.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used oil instead of butter and increased the spices to a rounded measuring spoon.  Since I was using a mini-cupcake pan, they only took 13 minutes in my oven.  They were delicious.  I increased the frosting by 50% and piped it on so it was nice and thick.  Plus, they looked really pretty.  It is a great fall/Halloween/Thanksgiving recipe.

I use metric system, I don't know if something went wrong when I used AllRecipe's automatic converter, but I did not care for these cupcakes at all. (And I doubt it was the converter's fault, I've never had a problem with it so far.)  

I'm not a big fan of too-spicy food, and I saw other pumpkin spice cupcake recipes involved a lot less spice, so I didn't put cloves and allspice, and I made my own pumpkin puree that I always make instead of store-bought can, followed everything else. They still tasted WAY too spicy-salty like. The only good thing was frosting, that was okay.

If you still decide to make these and try yourself, my best advice to you will be... make only 4-6 cupcakes and NOT try it when you have guests or something.

So incredibly good!  Loved the frosting, too.  My husband took these to work to share around, and everyone loved them.  Will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and we live in the UK, so the flour is different and so on, but I have learned how to compensate for that, and these STILL came out beautifully.  Thanks!

Very tasty.  I used a can of pumpkin and substituted milk with almond milk.  I made it in a 13x9 glass dish and baked for 30 mins at 350.  I think I will use less cloves next time.

They are great if the recipe is altered. I just made 24 of these bad boys :)
To start, I doubled every spice.
added 15 oz cup of pumpkin instead of cup.
sub oil for butter. deffff
ONLY PROB. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BAKING - EVER ! AND I FILLED MY CUPCAKE LINERS TO THE TOP.. I HAVE CUPCAKES THE SIZE OF MY OVEN ;)
Either way, tomorrow for Thanksgiving everyone will get extra fat... and at least they are awesome!!!!!

These were AMAZING! But I did alter the recipe so only giving 4 stars.  I used oil in place of the butter and added the entire 15 oz can of pumpkin. They were moist and delicious. My coworkers loved them.  The taste even better after they've been sitting in the fridge for 2 or 3 days (if you can keep them around that long)!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes were very yummy and moist. Next time I would still try oil instead of butter just to see the difference. Well, just remember I used an entire can of pumpkin puree instead of just a cup. 
The reason why I give it only 4 stars is the frosting. For me it was just way too sweet. For me frosting recipes with 2 cups of conf. sugar seem better. This frosting was so sweet that you didn`t taste the cream cheese anymore and I don`t like that. Mine also turned out too liquid, but I think that`s because somehow the cream cheese here in Germany is different even though I use Philadelphia too. So I don`t count that as a negative.

These cupcakes were great.  I only substituted pumpkin pie spice for the spice combo here and added a bit more pumpkin, but they turned out so light and moist.  I baked at 350 for 24 min.... Much better than any other pumpkin muffin i have had!

I gave 4 stars because I opted to use 1/2c of oil instead of butter and 350degree oven for 20mins. I also used 1.5c pumpkin because we roasted a pie pumpkin and I wasn't going to leave 1/2c of pumpkin to waste. They aren't going to be light because of the dense pumpkin, but mine were plenty fluffy, moist and tasty. You won't need to double the frosting unless you are piping, otherwise a single batch is fine.

These were very tasty, but the cupcake itself was slightly more muffin-y than cupcake-like. I expected it to be a little sweeter. However, the frosting is DELICIOUS.

These were amazing! I made the cakes just as the recipe stated with the only change being baked at 375 for 10 minutes, then I read that this might make the cakes dry, so I put the heat down to 350 for 10 minutes and they came out perfect! Not like a muffin...perfect cupcakeyness. (Maybe adding extra pumpkin like many people did here might make it more dense, but as is it is light and fluffy). I doubled the cinnamon in the frosting and it was so yummy. But I wish the icing was more like a pipable frosting. I will try to make it more like a buttercream by adding more sugar, but the taste is so good.

Left out the allspice (I didn't have any at the time) and substituted white sugar for brown and slightly reduced the amount (see previous comment for reason).  They still turned out SPECTACULAR!  Beautiful, delicious, light & fluffy. Perfecto!

This is a very flavorful cupcake, although mine came out a bit dry.  I think I'll bake about 5 minutes less next time.  We loved the frosting with the cinnamon in it!  Very nice touch that really makes the cupcakes.  I topped with marshmallow pumpkins and candy corn.

These were very good! I did use oil instead of the butter. I also added 1/4 cup more pumpkin and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. Instead of all the different spices I used 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon. They came out very moist with lots of flavor! I did have one problem with the frosting. I made as directed but it was very runny so I added another cup of sugar which didnt seem to help much. The frosting will not stay on my cupcakes! Maybe I did something wrong? Either way these were delicious and I will definitely be making them again. Maybe next time with a different frosting recipe.

Well, here's my little story. I thought this recipe looked great, but I didn't realize it was scaled for 24 cupcakes.  I only wanted 12, so I halved the recipe...at least, most of it. I somehow FORGOT to halve the butter and eggs (important things!), and didn't realize until they were in the oven. I also put more pumpkin in, based on the other reviews.  MAGICALLY, these cupcakes turned out perfectly.  I don't understand it. This is a magic recipe, seriously, so, yeah, I'll definitely be making them again.  Also, the frosting was awesome.

I found these very easy to make, and quite tasty as well. I did NOT edit the recipe for the cupcakes themsevles, but I did add quite a bit more powdered sugar for the icing because it was too runny for my taste. I like my icing to be a little stiff so that I can decorate with it.  I didn't find them dry, as some other people complained, in fact mine were quite moist. It may have to do with the fact that I use real butter, and raw (whole unpastuerized) milk. Anyway, they're a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

Since there were many reviewers at odds about whether to use oil or butter, I did half oil, half butter. I added extra pumpkin also, and baked at 350 for about 18 minutes. They turned out full of flavor, delicious AND moist. Didn't have any allspice, but I didn't miss it at all. I only wish the frosting held its shape better.

I used many of the tips in the reviews (1/2 oil and 1/2 butter, extra 1/4 C pumpkin, 1/4 C applesauce, 3 extra T flour, bake at 350 degrees) and we love, Love, LOVED these cupcakes.  They were beautifully tall and rounded.  The cream cheese frosting is the same I always make, but the cinnamon is an added surprise.  It adds an elegant touch.  My little guy loved adding a candy pumpkin to the tops and taking them to his preschool teachers.

I made these for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and decorated them like pumpkins. The icing was great but I only used about half the icing sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also used oil instead of butter in the cupcakes as other reviewers suggested and they were very moist. My family enjoyed these, thank you.

I found this entire recipe really time consuming and labor intensive for a run-of-the-mill end result.  The frosting's flavor was ok but kind of too sweet and it started to run everytime it got even a little warm and didn't look near as pretty as the picture.  I used oil in place of the butter so the muffin wasn't dry.  I too, baked at 350 for 20 minutes instead of the higher temp and longer bake time so they wouldn't burn.   I'll stick with my pumpkin bread from now on.

I decided to follow the recipe as is.  I was pleasantly surprised at their moist texture.  I didn't think the cupcakes turned out dry at all.  I did, however, cut the baking by about 5 minutes.  I would definitely recommend these cupcakes for anyone with a sweet tooth for pumpkin, and I may try some of the suggestions from the other reviews the next time I try this recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the others reviews.  I added oil to the batter instead of butter and 1/4 c. applesauce.  They're SUPER moist.  I did have to refrigerate my icing in order to get a thicker consistancy as it seemed to melt right off at first.  I added cinnamon graham crackers to the top once iced.  These are delic... they taste almost exactly like my pumpkin roll.

I made this recipe this evening and it came out amazingly well! I was out of allspice, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead, but they're practically the same thing, so I figured it wouldn't matter. These cupcakes are so light and fluffy, they can barely hold up the icing!!

I made these, following the recipe exactly, but instead of just using one cup of pumpkin pie mix, I scooped in about 2/3 of the can, and it made them really moist and delicious. 25 minutes was perfect. On the frosting, I used a little more cinnamon than it called for, and it made it amazing. I only used about a half of a box of confectioner's sugar, which is around 2 cups. I'm definitely baking these again!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, so I think it deserves all five stars. The pumpkin cupcakes aren't super sweet, which I prefer to your typical cupcake taste. The cinnamon cream cheese is a perfect complement to the cupcake flavor. I filled these with a bismarck pastry tip and piped the frosting on top too. They were absolutely beautiful.  My finicky little brother loved these - he cleaned up all the leftover cupcakes!

These were great!  Because of prior reviews that they were a bit dry, I added 1 extra egg, 2 extra tablespoons butter, and 1/2 cup extra of pumpkin puree.   I omitted the allspice and the ginger because I'm not a fan of those 2 spices.  I made them into mini cupcakes -- which requires less baking time: 15-18 minutes.   These were great.  Definitely adding them to my thanksgiving list of recipes!

These cupcakes turned out excellent. They are moist and don’t stick to the cupcake wrapper. I did add chocolate chips and baked at 350 for 20-21 minutes and got about 20 cupcakes out of the batter. Overall, really happy with this recipe and will definitely make again in the near future!!!

I loved these cupcakes.  I wasn't sure how they'd turn out because the batter was pretty thick and they didn't rise very much but they turned out great.  I used cake flour and I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and the toothpick came out clean and the cake was tender.

These were great! I made them for a Halloween party and everyone gobbled them up. Even my boyfriend, who very openly hates pumpkin, said they were okay and that it was amazing that he could say that about something with pumpkin in them. I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they turned out great. Especially the frosting-everyone raved over it.

Very good, but mine turned out alittle dry for some reason.  Has the texture of a muffin more than a cupcake but very good regardless. Would recommend

I followed the cupcake recipe to a T. And I agree with previous poster that rating this recipe with changes is not a true rating of THIS recipe. I would have given this 3.5 stars if the option existed. My family and I "Liked it" and it was more than "It was okay". I did these as mini cupcakes (reduced the time to 15 minutes) and it yielded about 70 minis. I think I might try oil instead of butter next time. I'm fairly new to baking, and so I'm learning a lot by trial and error but don't know enough yet to get creative and try my own variations and substitutions. I did have to add more powdered sugar to the frosting because I over mixed and the frosting was too runny, but otherwise, I find the creaminess of the frosting as a good balance to the slightly dry recipe of the cupcake. In any event it is a hit with my family and one of my twins said it was her favorite cupcake I've made yet (and I've made quite a few!), so that's saying something, I guess. :D

I didn't read the reviews before I made these, but can now see that the reviews echo what I found. The cupcakes did not need to bake for 25 minutes and there is not enough pumpkin nor spices. Next time I will look at the advice in the reviews to spice this up a bit more.  I didn't mind the texture with the butter.

This recipe is excellent. I followed the ingredient list exactly and used baking best practice for all measurements. I have a kitchen timer and oven thermometer to mitigate inconsistencies and avoid over-baking with my electric oven. Butter and sugars creamed. Milk and eggs set aside to reach room temperature. Pumpkin puree set aside. Dry ingredients poured into a 3 cup sifter. Ingredients added in order. Oven set to 375, timer set to 25 minutes. For my oven, the cupcakes passed the toothpick test at 20 minutes (your baking time may vary). Deliciously moist end result.

Thought it was pretty good but not like OMG PUMPKIN which would have been preferred.  Very moist even without using oil.  Followed the recipe fairly closely - only shook a bit extra pumpkin spice.  The frosting came out more like icing, but that was probably my fault.  All very tasty.

I made the recipe as called for exactly. I did not read any reviews before I made them. However, I wish I had. I believe the 375 is a lil too high. The bottom of my cupcakes are overbaked. The taste of the cupcake is really good, next time I'll add nuts in the batter. I got 21 cupcakes, filled 3/4 full.

These cupcakes are very pretty, and good to eat. They have a somewhat muffin, or pumpkin bread texture to it, and the cream cheese frosting is a perfect flavor to go with! It definitely got me in the 'Fallish' kind of mood! ;-)

I loved the cupcakes! My friend and I made them during a sleepover. Make sure not to over-bake. They did taste a little dry in the end. And if you want to make them look pretty, sprinkle some nutmeg and cinnomen on top! This recipe requires lots of ingredients- but it's worth it!

This is one of my favorite recipes! It is the perfect blend of spices and pumpkin for a great seasonal dessert! My family begs for this each year, and my coworkers just got their first taste (which gathered nothing but praise!) The only adjustment I have made is to bake them for 20 minutes. I have found when I bake them for the full 25 minutes, they come out a lot more dense. YUM.

This recipe is AWESOME I give it your highest rating.  They are very rich though can't eat more than one.  Made them in large cupcake pans only made nine but will use the smaller ones next time I couldn't finish the cupcake it was so rich.
I am the baker in my family and everyone comes to me for recipes.  I always bake from scratch and this will be added to my cookbook permenently

So I usually make cookies instead of cakes, but I wanted to try these.  I started out with the original recipe, but when I started beating the butter, it looked wrong with what the description said it should look like so I started reading the comments.  By then it's my own fault for how things don't go right, but I feel like I should still say: even with only half-way following the recipe, and trying to win ground by altering it by following other people's comments, these aren't THAT bad, and maybe the original recipe would have been good to follow with just the normal amount of tinkering.  I mean, as far as the comments go, I think doubling the spices took things a little too far.  I also think that doubling the pumpkin made them way too moist, to the point where they're not still doughy in the middle but they're kinda almost like that (you know?) and baking them for another couple of minutes doesn't quite make things right.  So if you're going to alter the recipe, you might not want to do things quite so drastically.  Take the comments with a grain of salt.

AWESOME recipe but like others I did modify it. I used a whole cup of pumpkin puree and less milk. My grandma and my boyfriend helped me make this (as I am only 17 and have no idea what I'm doing)and she suggested I add more cinnamon but I wanted to stick as close to the recipe as possible. I believe more cinnamon would have given it a more spicy feel but I love them anyway. The cream cheese icing was good to eat on its own haha!

Made them today and they were very good. I think the frosting needs to be a little thicker and then it would be a 5. But the cupcake itself was very good.

I should have read some of the reviews.  The cupcakes came out much thicker than I would expect (part of this is 100% my fault, I accidentally used 1 cup of Bread Flour).  That being said:
Fully support using a full can of Pumpkin, wish I had instead of 1 cup.
I favor butter, but I think it is worth having at room temp and creaming a long time.
The Frosting was AMAZING.
I suspect in the future I'll add more milk and pick up actual cake flour.

these are delicious but make sure to substitute oil for butter.  I've made them both way having forgotten the switch the 2nd time I made them, and the butter makes the cupcakes too dry.

Made these for my hair stylist before chirstmas and she Loved them.  was happy to have some baked goods around her house that nobody else in the house would eat because shes the only one who likes pumpkin.  added about 1/2 cup more pumpkin, left out the allspice and clove, used fresh grated nutmeg(lots more) and chopped crystallized ginger up real fine and used in batter and the frosting! went with oil instead of butter and they were soooooo moist. will so make these again around thanksgiving and christmas when i have pumpkin puree (right from the pumpkin cause that's how I bake) around the house again!

I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out delicious!! They were very moist, and the frosting was a great cream-cheesy, cinnamony perfection, too. I didn't change a thing except that mine only needed to be baked for about 17 minutes at 350.

The cupcakes were very good.  The only thing I changed was the cooking time.  In my oven, cupcakes take 15 minutes.  Ovens vary, so I suppose 20-25 minutes could be the correct time for her oven.   But, they were perfect for me in 15.  I liked the frosting also.  Good recipe, thanks!

These were better then I thought. I'm not a real pumpkin person but these were really good. The flavors blended well. The pumpkin was not overwhelming. The icing was not so good. It was runny and way to much sugar. I think less of that would be much better.

I tried some modifications as well.  I added a couple teaspoons of pumpkin seed oil to give it a seedy flavor, 1/4 cup of apple sauce and definitely change the baking temperature and time!!! That makes a whole difference: 350 degrees for no more than 19 min!!! It came out PERFECT!!! Thx!! These are mini cupcakes...

I thought the cupcake part of this recipe was very good.  Maybe a few too many spices.  Something seemed a little off, maybe the cloves.  Also, I'm not sure if it was that I used low fat cream cheese, but the frosting turned out extremely runny.  Next time I'll try regular cream cheese to see if it helps.

I just made these for my son's school Halloween party and it's a good thing I had to give most of them away, or I probably would have eaten half a dozen of them before my kids even got home from school! They are wonderful! Even the frosting is amazing, and I don't really like frosting. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did take them out about 5 minutes early, and they were perfect, moist and delicious! I put a little candy corn on the top for fun, and they turned out to be the perfect Halloween treat. These will be a new fall and Halloween tradition in my family. Now, who else can I make these for...

great festive cupcakes. A few changes made:
oil instead of butter (better for moist cupcakes)
cake flour (lighter cupcakes) and I added 2 Tbsp.  extra since I live at altitude. 
added extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin and applesauce
decreased cloves to 1/4tsp.
Baked at 350 for 20min. 
Used maple frosting instead of cream cheese...yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I substituted equal amount applesauce for the butter and used soy milk instead of dairy milk. I was generous with the spices and added some pecans to the batter. What a fantastic way to welcome autumn! They had great flavor and were wondrously moist.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!  Baking time of 25 minutes was absolutely right.  I thought there was the perfect amount of spices-- it wasn't overpowering, but still very flavorful and delicious.  I also liked that the batter was a bit on the thicker side, which made me less likely to spill it while filling up the cupcake trays.  (I'm a bit accident prone, haha.)  Wonderful cupcakes and fairly easy to make.  I highly recommend!!

Made these today. Followed the recipe exactly except didn't add allspice since I had none.  The cupcake portion was moist and delicious.  It was not too sweet and paired up perfectly with the cinnamon flavored cream cheese frosting.  Cannot wait for my friends to taste them tonight.  My daughter gave them a rave review!

Soooo good!  I will definitely make these again.  Very moist and very flavorful without being too sweet.  I used Pumpkin Pie Spice in place of the ginger, cloves, and allspice, and also added a little more than listed of the cinnamon and nutmeg because I wanted a spicier flavor.  I also used 2% rather than whole milk and they still came out perfect.
I agree with some of the other reviewers that they are more muffin-like than cupcake like, but I think that is mostly true for all true pumpkin muffin recipes due to the density of the pumpkin.  
The icing was almost too sweet for my liking.  I made a double batch, so I used one package of reduced fat cream cheese and one package of regular, and only about half of the powdered sugar required.  I only iced half of the cupcakes for decorating, the rest we have been enjoying plain, like a muffin.  
The recipe makes closer to 18 large muffins, not 24.  I suppose you could squeeze 24 out of it if you were to make a flatter muffin, however I like mine with a full, round muffin top - it's the best part!  Love these muffins - a definite recipe to keep on hand especially for these great fall days.

Cupcakes taste OK.  I added about 3/4 cup of toasted chopped walnuts.  I didn't like the frosting; too goopy and doesn't have a good taste; too sour.  I kept adding confectioners sugar but frosting didn't thicken up like I expected.   I suggest Caramel frosting (google zucchini cupcakes with caramel frosting).  Would have been much better.

This was a hit at my dad's 60th birthday!  I actually made mini's out of it and the cupcakes were good and the frosting was to die for!  I would try using oil next time to moisten them up a little bit more.

I have made these twice now. . . .the first time I followed the recipe exactly, and changed the baking from 375 to 350 based my cupcake experience.  The second time, I changed it a little by adding more pumpkin (1 15 oz. can plus 1/4 cup) and I used a egg replacer powder due to an egg allergy.  For the frosting, both times I made different as I like less sugar.  Used 1/2 the called amount and added more cinnamon.  These are VERY good, and everyone has liked them, the changes I made were based on what people thought about the first batch.

I don't think it's fair to change a recipe drastically and then rate it according to my alterations. That being said; I intentionally changed nothing. Unintentionally, I doubled the spices. Oops! They turned out great! I used neufatel cheese rather than cream cheese simply because it was what I had in the frig. My oven cooked these to perfection at 22 minutes.  These are TO.DIE.FOR! **UPDATE** made these a 2nd time, followed the recipe verbatim. Out of this world yummy!

This was a big hit at the Halloween Party, the Kids loved them, as did everyone else, they were soo moist and the pumpkin flavor really stood out. I even adding Black coloring to the frosting, made them even more festive. I added a little more nutmeg, and pumpkin to the recipe as well, giving it more flavor.

The frosting is amazing!  The cupcake, though, was just OK.  It didn't have a great pumpkin flavor and 25 minutes at 375 was too much.

I am only rating this recipe 3 stars. Although with the alterations I made mine turned out 5 stars. I read through the reviews and used a few recommendations. I did add more pumpkin, used heaping measurements of spices instead of leveling them and used oil instead of butter. I also added about 1/4 cup of applesauce. They were perfect! If I could rate the frosting separate I would give it 5 stars. I would recommend to use this frosting recipe before trying an alternative.

The cupcake part gets 4 stars, but the frosting gets 10, so overall, this one gets a 5 from me.  I would definitely increase the spices in the cupcakes.  The frosting is unbelievable.  Cream cheese frosting is already a favorite of ours, but the addition of the cinnamon puts this one over the top.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe and I'm not a huge cupcake person.  I LOVED the cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting, so delicious and I have had lots of compliments on this one.  I thought they tasted like these pumpkin rolls that my mom makes around Christmas time and these are a lot less work!

Very good but a little dry. Will try using 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter next time. When adding the spices I put a little extra of each and used pumpkin pie spice in place of allspice. Added 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree. Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. For the frosting I used only 2 cups of confec. sugar and added 1/8 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice as well as the cinnamon. Will make these again.

These cupcakes turned out really moist in my opinion.  I agree that the eggs do not have to be room temp. and I substituted 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg, ginger, cloves and all spice.  It made it quick easy.  My husband even liked it and he is not a big cupcake fan.

Perfect!!! I used oil instead of butter in hopes of retaining the moisture. Everything else is just right as is. This frosting is to die for:)

Only 4 stars here because they could use more pumpkin flavor.  I used two cups of fresh pumpkin and it was perfect.  This icing is a fantastic match, although the cupcakes are just as good without.

The only change I made was to double the amount of pumpkin puree (I used the entire can of Libby's). They also only took about 20 minutes in the oven.  Next time I would let the milk and the eggs come to room temperature.  Great Recipe. Will make again

These cupcakes are delicious.  I made them for Thanksgiving and topped them with cream cheese frosting.  The only change I made was to add an additional cup of pumpkin puree.  They came out very moist!!! Oh and I did not have ground cloves but they were still really good!

This was a great recipe. Very easy to make and frost. If I made them again I would cut the frosting in half because I don't like my cupcakes over-frosted. All in all in was a perfect recipe, no changes needed to be made.

These were amazing! Made them for a bake sale and ended up having to make a second batch so we could keep some because they were so good! I followed the advice of other viewers and used a whole can of pumpkin instead of just a cup and I think it helped keep them moist.  However, the best part was the icing! I will start adding cinnamon to my cream cheese icing when I make carrot cake, too.  Awesome recipe all around.

I never give 5 stars.  Soooo good!  Like others, I added some pumpkin (1/2 cup more) but the rest was exactly the same.  I put 2 tsp. black food coloring into the frosting and ended up with 72 perfect Halloween mini muffins.

I followed this recipe exactly as printed, and the end result was more like pumpkin bread than a cupcake. They didn't rise very much and weren't all that light and fluffy- but they were very tasty and the frosting was delicious.   Next time I'll use cake flour and oil, instead of butter to moisten/ lighten it up a bit.

I added the entire can of pumpkin instead of just a cup and didn't change any other amounts. It came out delicious -- we had a hard time waiting for them to cool to eat! Of course, cooled off and with frosting they are amazing! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Since I'm in Miami I decided to put them at 350 degrees instead and after 20 minutes they came out PERFECT! Also, I was okay with just 2 cups of confectioner's sugar for the icing. They're very addictive and taste amazing!!

Good.  I substituted half the butter with applesauce and used agave nectar instead of sugar (1/3 of the amount requested and decreased the amount of milk).  I still found these a little dry as someone else mentioned.  They were more muffin like then cupcake like, but still tasty.  If you use agave, don't use the cupcake papers as they tend to stick. These would probably be good sans the frosting and with some raisins or cranberries tossed in.

Loved these cupcakes - moist delicious and the frosting is amazing - was wondering if this could be made in a loaf pan or a bundt pan? Not that experienced a baker so would need help with recipe adjustments if any.

If you want to use a full 15oz can of pumpkin (so as not to waste any), you can do such and increase all the other ingredients by 1 1/2 times (see below). The math works since a can of pumpkin is 1 1/2 cups. You shouldn't need to increase the frosting recipe since it makes plenty. [I had submitted this info along with the recipe, but it looks as if it didn't make it through the editing process.] Alternatively, some reviewers are saying they made the recipe with a full can and kept the other ingredients the same and it resulted in a very moist cupcake. Enjoy.

I made this cupcakes to recipe, but also added in a cup of walnuts.  They turned out fabulous.  I used the cream cheese recipe and garnished with a couple walnuts on top.  Everyone raved.  They were so moist.  Took them to work for the bosses birthday.  I will be making then again, maybe next time in a whole cake form with the cream cheese as a center layer.

This was a great recipe!! It has more of a muffin consistency than a cupcake but it's still light enough. 
I put 1 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree instead of just 1. It turned out VERY moist and nice!

I modified the frosting a little bit because I wanted to make swirls to decorate it and the frosting from the recipe was too thin.

I will be making another batch for a bake sale this weekend!

These are the best cupcakes I’ve ever made from scratch! The perfect moisture, taste, and texture for the cupcake and a delicious cream cheese frosting that did not overpower the cupcake with too much sugar.

This recipe is a keeper! T
hese are delicious! That said, I used buttermilk for the regular milk and  I  had pie spice, so I used a rounded tablespoon of that. It was a little too spicy, so a scant tablespoon would be fine. Also used oil instead of butter. These cakes are soft and light. I topped mine with American buttercream instead of cream cheese icing-hubby doesn't like it. He sure loved these and so do I.

These were a HIT.  I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.

Delicious!   The frosting is so good, just a hint of cinnamon.  Everyone has raved about them.

This is a good recipe, but I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of baking powder might be a mistake.  There's a definite aftertaste/bite that I associate with too much leavening agent.  Next time, I'll cut that back to 1.5 teaspoons.

These are sooooooo gooooood!! And they came out beautifully. I wonder if there is any way to make the cake more moist, and make the icing less runny.. these weren't huge problems, just personal preference. Nonetheless, delicious!

I used the cake recipe (used my own frosting). The cupcake did not end up a light cake-texture... very dense... not very smooth. It was okay for a hearty breakfast muffin - yet not a traditional cupcake which is to be the texture of cake, just a smaller serving. The taste was good. Just not what was expected.

These were very good. I followed what other reviewers suggested like to use vegetable oil instead of sugar and to bake at 350* for 22 minutes and it all came out great.

This is a decent base recipe but I had to double all the spice to get a good spice flavor. I also increased the pumpkin substantially (1.5. Cups). With those changes the cupcake was excellent. I did not use the frosting recipe. I made a cinnamon buttercream that was outstanding  family  pumpkin spice cupcake.

I would definitely make it again but I actually made a cake instead of cupcakes, you just have to bake it for around 45 mins on 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Best cake I’ve ever had, and its so fall its perfect. It was very moist and in the process of making the batter it curdled but it was fine and still delicious.

I made these as written and they were good but not quite pumpkin-y enough for me so I used the whole can of pumpkin puree instead of half and left out the milk.

These are DELICIOUS !!!!  Just made a batch for our  Halloween Party at work & they were devoured in no time at all, with requests to make more !!!!  I did however read other reviews & made changes as suggested:  used 1/2c  canola oil in place of butter & 1 1/2c pumpkin(definitely gives much better moisture & texture), omitted cloves(not a fan) but increased all spices & salt to 1 tsp.  The cream cheese frosting is wonderful... I only used 2 1/4c of powdered sugar & just sprinkled enough cinnamon to suite my  taste.  Going to make another batch tomorrow...but this time ...for home !!

Wow! These are fantastic! I took everyone's suggestions and doubled all the spices and pumpkin puree. I also used 1/2 the recommended amount of butter and then 1/4 of oil for moisture. I haven't finished frosting all the cupcakes (with the added ingredients made 30 total cupcakes), but seems like I will probably need to make more. I have tasted the frosting and it is sweeeeet. Next time I will probably reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. Other than that, the cupcakes are so delicious and moist. They are very fluffy! I want eat them all.

Highly recommend this recipe! Thanks!

It was tasty but dry. I followed the recipe. They were a bit dry even after taking them out 5 minutes earlier than the time stated. Next time, I will take them out even sooner. They do not need to be in the oven that long.

I did not change a thing with this recipe and they were outstanding!  I do use JUMBO cupcake papers and made 11 cupcakes.  My husband said these are the best and loves them the way they are....but I might tweak the next batch a bit with some of the other writers suggestions ....just to see if he notices :-)

Loved these, but with some minor changes.  I read reviews and swapped butter for oil.  Also added more pumpkin (1/4 cup more)  and doubled seasonings.  BUT... doubling the salt, i feel was a mistake!  I could taste the saltiness!  
I know i made changes but still... they were awesome and so moist!
I topped them with my regular butter cream icing with cin/sugar topping, as per my husbands request.  Im sure the cream cheese icing was awesome too.

You might as well skip the pumpkin because there is way to much spice. I used half of the ginger, allspice, and nutmeg and just a dash of clove. I also used half of the cinnamon in the icing. That should have been skipped altogether.

Added more spices and two cups pureed pumpkin. The Frosting was a little runny but super delicious. Will make again. My family devoured them.

OMG these were a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I was going to make pumpkin pies but when i saw that so many guests were bringing pies, i went searching for a great alternative.  I wanted to make a bigger cupcake so i made 15 cupcakes with one batch instead of 24.  Yum

I followed the recipe, made no ingredient substitutions and they are so delicious. A taste of fall on a California 85 degree day lol. I have a convection oven, so I reduced the heat to 350 degrees and baked for 20 min.

These are just the thing to start off October! I did read reviews as well and take that into consideration, made the following changes; baked at 350 for about 22-25 minutes. Used 1/2 cup I believe of vegetable oil rather than butter and left out the cloves. The frosting I followed exactly and best cream cheese frosting  I’ve made to date! Very happy with the results will be making again!

So light and fluffy! These melt in your mouth. I've made the recipe several times, and it usually turns out very good. I even had a little girl say these were her favorite cupcakes ever (heart melt!). I've both made the frosting in the recipe and used store bought to save time. The recipe version, unsurprisingly, is better. I'm not a huge pumpkin spice person, but these are not too overbearing in flavor, though you definitely know what you're eating.

I made this recipe twice, with the same basic changes both times. I used the entire can of pumpkin puree and heaping spoons of unexpired spices (I suspect the people complaining that the cake is bland are using old spices that lack potency). I baked for a bit longer due to the extra puree, but the cake turned out moist and good.

The first time I made this recipe, I used half that batter for cupcakes for my family and the other half as a small cake in a foil pan as part of a meal for a sick friend. The second time, I bake it in two cake pans and made it into a layer cake. All turned out great. 

It would also be good without the frosting as sweet muffins or with some streusel topping.

Followed recipe exactly, with just one adjustment: I subtracted 1 cup of confectioner's sugar from the frosting, as the texture was fine by the second cup and I felt 3 cups was too much sugar. These came out really good, but if I were to make them again I would follow others' suggestions and use vegetable oil instead of butter for the cupcakes, and reduce oven temperature to 350 F and increase bake time.

I did change the oven temperature to 350.  I wish I had read the reviews before I made them.  Next time I will use oil instead of butter, and I will use the whole can of pumpkin.  Maybe the yield will be 24, rather than 22.   They do smell heavenly!!  I hope my granddaughter's soccer team likes them.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and they came out fluffy, light and delicious.  I read the reviews and decided to stick with the original recipe, because I think adding oil takes away from the flavor.  I have made other cupcake recipes on Allrecipes and read many great reviews, with great advice, that has turned an amateur cook, into a "can I get that recipe" type of cook.  The first advice is, use fresh quality ingredients. I recently learned from a reviewer that baking soda gets flat quickly, so I buy several small boxes and use a fresh one when I bake(baking soda helps with the rising). Second bringing the refrigerated ingredients to room temperature is very important.  The third and most important thing I have learned is in the incorporation of dry ingredients with the wet ones. I use a hand mixer to mix the wet ingredients, however to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet ones, I use a spatula since I don't own a stand mixer.  I use the spatula in a folding motion until the dry ingredients are blended and there is no visible flour, this helps keep air pockets in the batter and what helps make them moist and light.  the last thing is the time, do not keep them in too long, for my oven 20 minutes was perfect. I decided to look for this recipe after eating a cupcake from a local grocery store bakery, because my kids loved them. They said these are better than the bakery ones!  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe! It was a big hit and I am baking several

This was SO good! However, I didn't add ginger, allspice, or clove, and I put in a full cup of unsalted butter and extra sugar. Despite changing the recipe they still came out nice and fluffy, they tested delicious too.

If I could survive only these cupcakes I'd totally do it! Wow! I'm nooooo baker by any means so these made me look good. My 4 yr old and I made these and they were outstanding! The frosting was perfect with only 2 cups powder sugar.  The changes I made for personal preference were to use coconut oil vs butter, added 1/4 cup applesauce and an extra 1/4 cup pumpkin. I also used heaping spoons of spices. That's it! This is gourmet worthy! Yuuummmmmyyy!

Made exactly to recipe.  I thought 375 degrees for 25 minutes was to hot but followed the directions.  Cupcakes were too dry but good flavor.  I will make them again but bake at 350 degrees and check for doneness after 20 min.

this recipe is great I've made it twice now and I find it is best to double it and use 3 muffin trays for 36 total I made it exactly as is the first time and they were small and I did not get the 24 it promised. The second time I doubled it and added extra brown sugar and white sugar and a quarter cup extra milk and used a full 29oz can of Libbys pumpkin puree, it comes out a bit more than the 2 cups called for but adds some extra flavor. Overall as written the recipe is OK but I will always make it with the changes I used the second time because it was so much better.

I thought these cupcakes were very good!! they are GREAT for fall, and since thanksgiving is coming up, I will most likely make them then, too! It's a great recipe and i'd recommend it! I did add a bit more cinnamon, though.

Made as mini muffins for breakfast (baked 12 min) then full-size frosted cupcakes for later with remainder. One kid liked both ways, other ate one because of frosting and doesn't want more... I'd want more spice for myself.

Great recipe, lots of flavour from the spice mixture. There was to much icing for me, next time I will make about 2/3.

I loved these cupcake/muffins.  Texture of cake was like a cupcake but ingredients and flavor seemed more muffin like.  I used oil in place of butter and doubled all spices and salt but I did not have allspice so left out.  I used one whole package of pumpkin and baked at 350 for exactly 19 minutes.  All perfect and my children liked them as well.

I liked this; moist! A bit heavy, but that's moist for you. Great with cold milk or a coffee. I made plain buttercream frosting and that works perfectly. I'm still new with cupcakes so I had to eyeball how much dough I put in the cups. 

Not hard to do, tasty, moist. It's a keeper.

Very good! I live at 10,000 feet and baking can be tricksy here, but I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting veggie oil for the butter for extra moistness, per the suggestion of another reviewer, and a couple minor adjustments to baking powder and sugar, all for altitude purposes. Things tend to dry out and/or collapse up here. I baked them for only about 17 minutes and they turned out wonderfully! Super moist and a delicious flavor and texture and loft! I'll definitely be making these again, though I think I will add a little more pumpkin next time. Oh! I almost forgot. I halved the recipe cause I'm a single lady and I don't need 24  cupcakes all to myself, but it only made 10, which is perfect for me but just FYI. Nice work, hive mind!

I made this and loved it. I am giving only 4 stars because I changed the butter to vegetables oil like others suggested, and when I was mixing the batter I kept on tasting it for flavor. I had to double the amount of spices. I wanted them really flavorful. A real hit. Thank you.

Maybe some beginners mistakes, like forgot the flour, only my second time baking. My wife is a professional baker, so she enjoyed my mistake but was very surprised at how well it came out. Will definitely make this again.

Good flavor, especially the delicious icing! My one disappointment is that this didn't seem like enough batter for 24 cupcakes. I wish I had just done 12 very generous cupcakes instead of the 24 dinky ones these turned out to be.

Yes to more pumpkin and salt!  I'm at HIGH ATLTITUDE so I used a little less leavening and sugar.  I baked for 21 min at 375 to account for the lower air pressure.  YUMMY!!!

Delicious muffin and the cinnamon in the frosting was just the right touch (although I used less than the recipe called for). My only problem was the muffins sticking to the bottom of the papers, which I suspect was my own fault, from a bake time perspective!

I think this is a good recipe to work off of.  Like others, I made some changes.  I substituted 1 Cup of unrefined coconut oil for the butter, replaced the milk with half and half (I didn't have any milk but someone did suggest using Buttermilk) doubled the salt, and added 1/4 C more of pumpkin puree and a 1/2 Cup of applesauce.  Reduced the heat to 350 and baked for 22 mins.  They came out super moist and very flavorful.  For the icing, I only used 2 Cups of confectioners sugar and it was plenty sweet.

This is the absolute BEST pumpkin cupcake I have ever made/tried. The cake texture is absolutely perfect and the frosting is heavenly. Although, the recipe doesn't make enough frosting for each cupcake to have a generous swirl on top, so I increased the proportions for the frosting by about 50%. Also make sure to only fill the liners about halfway or they'll make mountains! Definitely making these again(:

My cupcakes came out moist and delicious. One suggestion that I did take into consideration was to substitute the butter for vegetable oil for the cupcake mix they came out great. 24 cup cakes gone within 1 hour.

It tasted great, but the batter was more similar to a dough consistency and they turned out much like muffins. 25 minutes was way too long.

These were delicious, i didn't have any brown sugar or all spice so just added a little extra sugar an omitted the allspice, i did however add more pumpkin than the recipe. Overall it was a low fat content and moist cupcake which was a huge hit the family.

I always do buttercream to taste, usually half the amount of icing sugar and double the cinnamon.

Very nice cupcakes - the flavour was perfect "pumpkin spice". Adjusted recipe along the lines of other reviewers: 1)Reduced oven temp to 350 and cooked for 20 minutes (in fan oven), 2) used 1/2 cup oil instead of butter, 3) was generous with the spices (also added some cardamon as didn't have much ginger). Also I subbed cooked butternut squash (about 1.5 cups) as couldn't find pumpkin puree here in UK.  I also did this gluten free so used GF flour and skipped baking powder just mixed the batter a bit more. Seemed to work fine!

Read the reviews. When almost every review says change something, it probably turned out well. With this in mind, I just did what everyone else did: 350 degrees, used heaping measurements of spices with extra cinnamon and allspice for the cake part, replace butter with oil. It turned out perfectly cakey, with tons of flavor that goes very well with the cream cheese frosting. I made 48 mini cupcakes which took about 19 minutes to be ready (a little crunch/crisp for the outside and soft/moist on the inside) and 3 regular sized cupcakes. I halved the frosting only because I ran out of powdered sugar but it was enough for all the cupcakes.

I did change the butter to a combo of oil and applesauce, because I had to wait a couple of days to serve them and wanted them extra moist. The spice mixture and sugar content of this recipe is amazing! People commented especially on the cloves. The frosting was so, good and a perfect complement to the muffins.  I scaled the recipe up for 6 dozen and only got 5 dozen out of it. I don't think the muffin cups were overly full, either, so maybe note that. I guess that would be less noticeable if only making one batch.

My kids and I agreed these were the best cupcakes not only that Ive ever made but that we've ever had!  This is a great recipe idea however I did the variations that were recommended by others with a bit of my own preferences as well.. Heres what I did: I doubled the spices (except omitting the cloves), used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice (didnt have any) and doubled the salt. I also used 3 room temp eggs, half unrefined, half brown sugars. Just a note: everything I made these with was organic (but thats just me :)  Hmm what else..Used all the pumpkin I had (about 1 1/2 cup) Baked on 350 for 22 mins. I did half butter, half coconut oil (I love both sooo much!). Didnt get 24 cupcakes (got 23)-figuring I overfilled the others just a wee bit lol.  Not too big on super sweet anything personally so I cut down the confectioners sugar for the frosting to 2 cups and kept everything else the same. We also added sprinkles as you can see by the pic. Again they were PERFECT! Not dry in the slightest with perfect flavor. Im in love &will be remaking over and over. Thank you everyone for all the great advice!

Took advice of many reviews and added 1/4 cup applesauce, substituted butter for vegetable oil and used heaping spoons for the spices. Also baked at lower temperature too. I'm sort of a beginner so I can't quite explain why these changes make it better but regardless, the end result was very good. Was easy to make and got really good comments from family and coworkers. I will definately make them again.

Perfect as is, no adjustments needed!  However, next time I will not let the cream cheese sit until room temperature.  I piped the frosting on the cupcakes, which made it a little more difficult since the frosting was so soft.  But both cupcakes and frosting are delicious!

The cupcakes were quite good, after a few changes. First, double all spices and the pumpkin puree. I know,  it sounds crazy, but I doubled them because of a few reviews I read, and without doubling, they would have been terrible. Also, I halved the recipe (I only made 1 dozen) and I had to put them in forever. First,  15 minutes, then another 5, and another 5, and then 20 more. They were not burned or raw, they were perfect.

Yum! All I had was pumpkin spice mix.
 I used 2 1/2 tsp of that and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I used oil instead of butter and equal part of sugar and brown sugar . Oven is at 350•F . 
These are really good though! Can't wait to try them with the icing everyone is raving about!!!

I made the recipe as started. It's that the point of using a recipe? :) Made these for 100 ladies and they loved them. The frosting was a little runny but was able to still pipe it on the cupcakes. My husband even liked the frosting and he is not a cream cheese fan. Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly how it is (besides adding a little extra pumpkin spice on top of the frosting and in the cupcakes just for good measure) and they were scrumptious! I even added a little pumpkin candy to the top of the frosting for decoration and my family loved them. Would definitely make again.

I baked these delicious cupcakes mini style; 350 for 13 minutes. I checked after 8 minutes, then 3 minutes, and then 2 minutes. I made a Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting and decorated with orange, green and whites sanding sugar. I read the reviews that everyone changed or added to the recipe. I used the original recipe and have no reason to change it at all.

the Vanilla Chi-tea Butter Cream recipe, with a slice of sugared ginger on top. Yummo, and pretty. Lu Ann

It was amazing! I didn't have pumpkin! I used cherry pie filling with gelatinized fresh blueberries! It worked! I was going to use orange pulp and banana. I thought spices work better with those two instead. But cherry and blueberry tasted great! My only issue was I didn't frost them. I think cream cheese wouldn't mix well with berry flavors

This recipe is really good! I too used vegetable oil instead of butter, used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and used heaping teaspoons of the spices, and it turns out so deliciously moist! I highly recommend!

This was a hit at a halloween bonfire. I will absolutely make them again. I love pumpkin and am always looking for new recipes to make with it. I did make a few changes however. I really like a stronger pumpkin flavor so I put about 3/4 of a can of pumpkin in and gave the rest to my puppy. I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added a smidgen more of the other spices.  The cupcakes came out super moist and had great flavor. Everyone loved them. The frosting was simple to make and I followed the recipe exactly. I bought enough cream cheese to double the recipe after reading other people's review, but a single batch was plenty to generously frost all the cupcakes. The frosting however is crazy sticky, so I ended up with it everywhere after making it.

The cupcakes were delicious. The only changes I made were adding the whole can of pumpkin and about a cup of plumped up raisins (I boiled the the raisin for a few minutes and them steeped for a while before draining and adding to the batter before baking.) The raisins were a wonderful addition.

I just took these great tasting and smelling cupcakes out of the oven. Love this recipe and will be making them again. I will add a little more of the spices. Waiting for them to cool so I can frost them.

Delicious! Cupcakes turned out perfectly. I added just a cup of the pumpkin pie filling and it was just enough. Frosting was yummy, but a little thin. Could use something else to make it a little thicker. Otherwise great recipe! Will definitely make these again. -Christy

I love these, and I'm a pumpkin lover. I used oil in place of butter and upped the pumpkin by 1/4 cup per other reviewers,  and they were perfect! I baked them for 18 minutes and decided to use another frosting recipe on them (mistake! ) but had to throw out the other frosting even though it was very well reviewed.  Use the frosting recipe provided, it's perfect for these.

I read a lot of the comments and adapted still further- so far that maybe I should just print this as a new recipe?!  But it worked great.  I doubled the spices (but the cloves and allspice should be kept as is- they both overpower if doubled), and changed the fat to oil (but I used olive oil as this spicy kind of cake can take the additional flavor and it is so good for you!).  I also decreased the white sugar and increased the brown.  I increased the milk to 1 cup and increased the pumpkin to a full 15 oz. can.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I feel like the fat ratio is still low, for a standard cake recipe but the cake was moist and good, so...!  I also made a Bourbon Brown Sugar cream cheese frosting that was insanely perfect on these.  I typically make a "roux" style frosting (starting with a base of cooked flour and milk) and used that technique for this one.  I never use confectioners sugar in frostings as they never turn out as silky and light as frostings that use regular sugar- whether you go the route of a Roux style or Swiss or Italian style frostings.  Trust me- if you give up on powdered sugar frosting you will never go back!

Rave reviews...trumped pumpkin pie (which is hard to do in our family). The cinnamon cream cheese frosting is simply YUM! I have made this as cupcakes, but have also made it as a layer cake. It's always a big hit.

I loved this cake recipe! I didn't have any pumpkin on hand but fortunately I had some sweet potatoes lying around and mashed and used those instead. Wonderful flavor, moist, and baked up great in the oven! Improvised and made my own frosting because I also didn't have cream cheese.

First off, I'm generally not a fan of pumpkin anything but these cupcakes were quite the surprise to me. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the moistness of the cupcakes having used butter. They were quite moist & light. I will say that I didn't use the suggested amount of sugar in the frosting because it was sweet enough before I used it all. I will use it all next time though because the consistency of the frosting was a little too runny.  I will definitely make these again.

I give these a 4 because I think this is a good starter recipe. I added a WHOLE can (15 oz or so) of pumpkin and heaping spoons of the spices. They turned out awesome. My boyfriend said they would have been better with some different texture like nuts but because I don't really like nuts in dessert I don't think I'll change that next time. Leftovers were still moist in the fridge 3 days later and it seemed like the flavor had gotten even more intense! Great starter recipe.

Followed recipe, they were a hit at the birthday party. Frosting is not too sweet and the touch of cinnamon was great. This recipe is a keeper for me. My cupcakes baked a little faster than the time given.

Off the charts moist and delicious!! But, okay, I did change a few things. I simply replaced the butter with unsweetened apple sauce (something I do with virtually all recipes that call for oil or butter), I doubled the pumpkin and I used a bit more cinnamon. I also baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes and they were perfectly done! (This is one area that I felt was way off in the original directions. 375 is too high and 25 minutes would have meant very burnt cupcakes for me!) With these changes, they were perfect!! Great recipe!!

I'm only rating this recipe as a 5 because I made the all adjustments from DelightfulDines rating comments. I think these are hands down the best cupcakes I ever had! My dad and I would like to lose weight so I guess we shouldn't have made 24 to share between the 2 of us lol :D

I Tried this recipe for church,and people loved it.
They kept coming back for seconds.
Some people asked for the 'recipe.
I did find one thing,I like to pipe my frosting on but this frosting is so runny.So I added about 11/2  cups of powder sugar.
But great otherwise.

I followed the recipe exactly, and these did not turn out like cupcakes at all. They were more dense, they were muffins. I was hoping for a fluffier cupcake, they were for my daughter's birthday party. They did taste good, just not the texture I was hoping for. I was very pleased with the cinnamon cream cheese frosting, though. It is so delicious, the ratios of butter to cream cheese and sugar are perfect, and the cinnamon made it delicious!

Used oil instead of butter (personal $ preference) and added extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin.  Used full teaspoon of Allspice as I didn't have ground cloves.  Baked for 15 mins in paper liners (dark pan).  Delicious without frosting, and the kitchen smells awesome!!

My 11 year old cousin needed to make these for her science class so I put her in charge of the dry ingredients and she shadowed me for the rest.  They were a complete success, light and tasty and topped with one of the best frostings ever!

These are AMAZING - they have become my go-to cupcakes for the holidays! I didn't change much as the recipe was really good, but to make my life easier I used pumpkin pie filling, instead of pure pumpkin, and I bought the pumpkin pie spice as well and added maybe a tsp or two to it, to give it some extra spice. If you like to customize your pie spices, then you can do it the old fashioned way, but I've made it both ways and this way makes it taste nicer. I also used half of the can (those big pie filling cans they sell in the grocery store), instead of measuring out a cup. They are really moist and delicious and have that great taste to them. I also don't usually follow frosting recipes as they always call for too much sugar, but the cinnamon/cream cheese duo is to die for. I don't like frosting, but this one I could eat straight! Great recipe!

Tried this recipe. I believe I put too much cloves. Other than that easy to put ingredients together. Loved that it called for butter - I ran out of vegetable oil. The cupcakes came out moist. The icing was tasty. Overall very good recipe.

These were really good, but I should have taken the advice of other reviewers and add heaping spoonfuls of spices.  I used a whole can of pumpkin and I think I could have used an additional half of a can.  I'm not a fan of baking with apple sauce, but I noticed other reviewers mentioned it and I think I will try that next time.  I felt like this recipe was lacking something.  I also substituted oil for butter and I'm glad I did because they came out very moist and not greasy like butter would have made it.

I let my cream cheese sit out for a few minutes to soften and I think that was a bad idea.  After mixing the ingredients for the frosting it was very soft and difficult to pipe.  The flavor was nice though.

I doubled the amount of pumpkin and omitted the cloves and allspice. I also only used about half the amount of cinnamon in the frosting. Before they were frosted, they tasted like muffins. Once frosted, they tasted like cupcakes.

Yum. These were really good. I baked them for about 22 minutes instead of the full 25. I also used about 1 cup less sugar in the frosting.

Just right! Not too much spice, not too much pumpkin.  Thanks to all that suggested setting oven to 350 degrees, that was much better.  Also, I thought the batter was a little runny, I thought I did something wrong or forgot an ingredient, but they turned out perfect! Thanks for this muffin recipe!

This recipe is right on target! Only tweak I did was to not sue the all spice. I never use all spice, I feel its too strong for me. Hope the leadership council at school like them!

I didn't use milk- didn't need it- also bought Pumpkin Spice, instead of all the individual spices, was a lot cheaper- and includes all the spices it counts for.  Added extra nutmeg, and poured a little over half of batter into baking cups and added Hershey's Pumpkin Spice Kisses (available at Target only I believe) and poured more batter over it.  Also used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin.  Came out perfect!  Frosting is delicious, but really runny even after letting cupcakes cool to frost.  Love them and will be making them again!  My oven cooks hotter I think, but I baked 19 mins and came out perfect.

This was wonderful. I changed the amount of ingredients and decided to leave out the cloves. I made my own cream cheese frosting not from this recipe. I made 32 of these and decided to fill half of them with the frosting and leave half of them unfilled. Almost all of these were eaten almost immediately after they were finished. The spice was just right and not overwhelming, like others I've tasted. I definitely recommend this recipe, and was very happy to serve these.

I think these cupcakes were tasty but i feel that they need more spices and may need a little bit of vanilla to it as well. Bake time was very accurate. The icing makes the cupcake!!

I halved the recipe to make 24 mini muffins instead. I baked them in a nonstick pan so I made sure to reduce oven temp to 325 degrees and bake 14- 15min to avoid overbaking. They came out extremely moist and perfectly sweet (but not too sweet) even with my substitutions.   Here were my modifications: 1. used whole wheat flour and egg beater  2. used pumpkin pie spice (instead of allspice) 3. reduced butter by 1/2 and replaced rest with applesauce  4. doubled the amount of pumpkin.  I did not make the frosting as I wanted my kids to enjoy the muffin itself. But I will make for special occasion next time.

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half to make 12 cupcakes.  I used oil instead of butter and didn't worry about having the egg at room temp.  Baked them at 350 for 18 minutes, turned out perfect and moist.  I used a different cream cheese icing recipe so I can't rate that.  Sooo yummy!

So Delicious! The cupcakes were super moist and flavorful; the only changes I made were adding Pumpkin Spice and using vanilla icing. My only suggestion is to eat them the first day they're made, because they just aren't as yummy after that. But overall, these were amazing!

This recipe was great - very grown up. I followed some other people's suggestions with the muffin batter. The frosting, is AMAZING as is and I've used it now on other things too. I made butterhorns for Thanksgiving with this frosting to rave reviews. A keeper!

Just made these cupcakes exactly as the recipe states, and they turned out great! They are very moist and quite good. The frosting is good as well, though I might prefer a little bit less cinnamon next time. Overall, a great recipe!

This was a nice recipe. My 14 year old was able to make it himself for his school party. We did use canned frosting but it was just fine and the kids didn't care.

These were fantastic! The frosting is phenomenal and ties everything together. Next time I make them, I'm going to try adding a bit of sour cream to add moisture and fluffiness since I live in such a dry climate, but these were great!

Tested this recipe out recently and took some to work for a tasting. Everyone loved them, really enjoyed the cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I will definitely make these again.

MMMM.... SO GOOD!! I took the advice of a few other people and doubled the amount of pumpkin to make them more moist. I also used low fat cream cheese for the frosting.  It was less thick than regular cream cheese but still tasted great!  We live in Hawaii and I miss the fall season so this was a perfect way to remind us of that. My boyfriend said the cupcakes remind him of home (NY)  :-)

Excellent - followed it exactly (with only a little difference in the spices). Turned out great.

Hmmmm, I hate to be one to not give a good review after so many good ones, but I followed the recipe to a "T" (which is unusual for me) and it didn't turn out that great. The taste was ok, but they were a bit rubbery. The frosting was good, but I won't make them again=(

I've made two batches of 48 of these so far.  Some for home, some for a pot luck and some donated to my local zoo. And 48 of 48 were gobbled down with zeal. I've been asked to make even more! I got lots of kudos for these guys. Only change I made was to use Neufchatel in place of standard cream cheese. Thanks again!

I used 2 cups of pumpkin and they came out very moist. However, I tried to use fat-free cream cheese and the topping came out a little too runny - I will stick with regular cream cheese next time!

So delicious! I made them with a full can of pumpkin pie filling and they were so moist. Used Splenda instead of the sugar and brown sugar. The pumpkin and the spices are so good you can't taste the difference. Tried to use Splenda for the icing and it didn't work quite as well. I will need to work on that.

The cream cheese icing is what makes these cupcakes so fantastic! Other reviews mentioned their cupcakes turned out dry; even though my oven runs hot, I thought they turned out perfectly.  I like lots of icing on my cupcakes, so I actually filled the cupcakes with icing AND put icing on the top. They were gone within minutes!

This recipe is very tasty! I followed it exactly. Next time I think I will follow one of the other user's tips and add more pumpkin. They were definitely more like a "Muffin" not a cupcake but i was not disappointed. The frosting recipe made WAY TOO MUCH if you follow this recipe exactly.  I would use 1/2 the frosting ingredients next time.

Fantastic. I added about 2 cups of pumpkin and a little more clove and cinnamon to the mix. A big hit at work.

Awesome.  I added extra pumpkin like other suggestions (8oz can of pumpkin puree).  I also used the cinnamon cream cheese icing.  Great recipe!

Very good.  I also used a full can of pumpkin pie mix, based on other reviews.  It's awesome and I'm taking it to work!  My mother is taking it to card party next month. Thanks much!

amazingly awesome! I generally like to stick to the original recipe the first time around to give it a fair shot but I was lacking in some things so I made some modifications... such as I used 1 can of pumpkin pie mix (because I couldn't find plain canned pumpkin). I also doubled most of the spices because I love spice in my pumpkin foods. Oh and I cut the sugar in half in the cream cheese recipe and it still was more than sweet! Thank you for the awesome recipe. Will make again

Light, fluffy and delicious. These are perfect for Fall! I added some milk to the frosting to make it a bit less sticky and more spreadable.

I liked the recipes very much.  However, it needs to pack in more nutrition.  I altered it with the following:

FOR THE FLOUR
1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/4 cup flax flour

FOR THE SUGAR
I used 1 cup Sucanat sugar (not refined)
and did add the brown sugar.

FOR THE FROSTING
It only needs 1 cup of confectioner's sugar not three!

Now the cupcake has more fiber, and less refined sugar.  Much better for you.
