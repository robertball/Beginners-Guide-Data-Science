Nice flavor, I omitted the oil and just mixed it in the blender.    I used 4 ancho's, 4 guajillo's, and 1 chipotle softened in 3 c. boiling chicken stock, along with an onion and 4 garlic cloves for the base.

Quite delicious. It takes a bit longer than 3 minutes to get it to a good consistency. Thank you for the recipe.
