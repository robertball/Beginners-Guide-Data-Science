I was asked to make a sweet potato casserole for a dinner party.  I saw this and wanted to try it out before serving to others.  I halved the recipe and baked it the full time.  It was very good.  I found the bread to be a little too soggy; I possibly could have baked it a little longer to take care of that, although the topping was really perfect.  Cooking any more would have changed that.  At any rate, the dish has a lot of good flavors, the subtle orange and ginger flavors really adding to it.   It is sweet and could certainly be served with whipped cream or ice cream as a dessert.  In fact, when my husband tasted his, he said, "This could be a dessert."  I am definitely going to make this for the dinner party  and will make it many more times in the future.

I took this to my family's Easter dinner & everyone loved it...it went so well w/ our Easter ham. I doubled the recipe but only used 5 eggs & not 6, which was plenty. I did use the streusel topping (which was fantastic w/ the orange zest). It will become a new Easter tradition...thanks.

WOW !!! I never knew vegetables could taste this good. I omitted the streusel topping and placed extra sliced pears onto pudding before baking.
It was served as a side dish (not dessert).

this was a wonderful warm desert on a chilly evening!  

i used fresh pears and fresh sweet potatoes, and cut the calories, carbs, and fat by using non fat milk, non fat sour cream, and sugar substitue.

I loved this. I did it using real sweet potatoes, pears and pineapple. I also, did it as a desert and topped it with dream whip. My husband and daughter loved it. I love pineapple so I just cut pieces but next time I will definitely crush my fresh pineapple. This is definitely a keeper but if you decide to use fresh I had to cook it for a total of 1hour and 15 minutes therefore it gave enough time for the potatoes to cook in the casserole.

Maybe I was expecting to much but had it not been for the topping this would have been a full disappointment. I had to make a carmel sauce to put over it so my family would eat it. Also found I had to bake it an additional 25 minutes for it to be done in the center. Will stick to my old  bread pudding recipe.

This was really tasty tho I had to make some modifications for what I had on hand. I used half and half instead of milk just because I had a lot that needed to be used up, acorn squash cooked in simple syrup because I didn't have any sweet potatos, and I used sweet potato rolls that I made with acorn squash from last night instead of french bread. We really really enjoyed this and it used up the can of pears and pineapple I had hanging out in the pantry for way to long.

I served this with Christmas dinner.  My parents loved it.  I might try a lower calorie version with splenda.

I donâ€™t know yet if the middle is done (had to cook longer than recipe), but I did a taste test before Thanksgiving tomorrow and YUM!! Perfect sweetness level. This is a winner.

This dish brought me more compliments than anything that I have ever made.  I substituted regular sugar for the fine sugar without problems.   I used a slightly stale, very crusty baguette.  Once it soaked in the batter it not only worked, but had great body.

I served this for Thanksgiving with our maple glazed bourbon turkey and the flavor complimented the meat very well.  After reading the other reviews I increased the bread cubed to 6 cups and let them dry in the oven while preheating so they would absorb more liquid and this easily filled a 2 qt baking dish which needed to be baked twice as long as recommended.  We don't care so super sweet so I left the topping off.

A truely versitile recipe. I used leftover banana bread, apple instead of sweet potato. It turned out to be a winner at Sunday lunch with friends.
