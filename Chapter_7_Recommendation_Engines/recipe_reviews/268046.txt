This recipe gets 5 stars on flavor but 4 stars on directions. I followed the directions exactly as written and it failed due to the moisture content in the zucchini. Next time I will grate the zucchini over a dish towel and squeeze out the excess moisture. The seasonings  are spot on.

Too spicy. The texture was more like mash potatoes and not like hash.
