This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I doubled the marinade and had enough to make over 6 lbs. of ribs with plenty of leftover sauce. I placed the leftover meat in my food processor and added additional sauce for a wonderfully delicious pulled pork!

Yum! My family won't be able to get to Carolina this year and I think I'm more upset about missing the bbq than the beach. This is an awesome substitute. Thank you!

I was really disappointed with these! I followed the recipe to a T and I really love vinegar... but thats all I tasted!.. I think I would have added less vinegar and more molasses

Was looking for a new way to prepare some country style ribs and hubby (over my shoulder) saw this one and thought it would be good. Seeing as how we had everything on hand I said "Oh why not". It was easy to prepare. I am startled that we did not like it more. I adore a vinegar based BBQ sauce but this is not what this is. It is a marinade. Very different. Not trying to be harsh but it was almost as if the ribs were pickeled somewhat. I will say that for some reason it was better lastnight when we had the left overs. So seeing as how Hubby picked it out I asked him to give it a star rating and he said 2. Still, it was not bad at all. It's just not our thing.

This sauce is very good and super easy!  It's not a thick, tomato-based sauce, so don't expect that.  I had never had vinegar-based bbq before, but I had some country style ribs, and my partner said it sounded good.  We LOVED it!  I am making it again tomorrow with pork spareribs.  Yes, you must like vinegar to appreciate this sauce, but if you do, go ahead and try it!

All we could taste is the vinegar. I even cut down the vinegar after reading other reviews.

Vinegar will keep the meat from drying out.  This is a very good basic recipe.

I had country style ribs and no recipe. This one looked good. I followed the recipe exactly, sans the cayanne pepper. My husband gave it a four, but I was not a fan of the heavy vinegar flavor. I added more molasses to the basting batch, but it didn't seem to help my tastebuds. I am a southern girl and that could be my reason for not liking the vinegar based BBQ. The ribs had great texture and cooked perfectly as instructed.

Tender and tasty. I cooked these in my smoker for 7 hours and finished them off with my favorite BBQ sauce on the grill.

Not to bad. I have had better. I was looking forward to the taste. I prefer more of my southern bbq style ribs but thanks anyways.
