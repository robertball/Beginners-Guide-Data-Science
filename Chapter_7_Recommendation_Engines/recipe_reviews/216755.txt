Great recipe for "Extra-Yummy" Pancakes with a nice touch of cinnamon! I used only two tsp. of cinnamon vs. a full Tbsp. and added a full tsp. of vanilla for good measure. Also, letting the batter rest for a few minutes while the frying pan heats up makes for really fluffy pancakes. These were perfect topped with butter and REAL maple syrup! Also equally awesome with sauteed apples over top...

When I read the recipe and it asked for 1 tablespoon of cinnamon I admit I did a double-take.  However, as this is a new recipe that hadnâ€™t been reviewed often I made the recipe exactly as stated.  My initial thought was correct, the cinnamon is overpowering.  The reason the cinnamon taste was so strong may be that I use a very high quality cinnamon.  They were still good, but I would cut back to two teaspoons of cinnamon the next time; and as stated they were light and fluffy.

Light and fluffy, the five minute waiting time is really important to remember. They turned out great!

These were outstanding. The family LOVED them. I did a double take when I saw the amount of cinnamon. I ended up only using 1/2 Tbs and that was PLENTY. They turned out a lot fluffier than I thought they would when I poured them on the skillet. Will definitely make them again!

Absolutely extra-yummy and fluffy! I used whole wheat white flour and "soured" milk (milk soured with lemon juice). I did only use a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon only because I didn't want that to overpower the rest of the pancake and I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil only because I'm low on oil until payday. These turned out just wonderful! I served these with a homemade maple-vanilla syrup (which is also from this site) and it was just heaven. I think these would be just as tasty without the cinnamon, too.

Sorry to say but mine did not come out fluffy at all not even a little bit.  I followed the recipe exactly so I don't know where I went wrong.  Also, way too much cinnamon.  Both of my kids did not like them and I didn't care too much for them either.  I will not be making these again :(

I made these this morning for my husband. They were good. I used 2tsp of Cin. like others suggested and it was still a little too much. Next time I will use less.

I tried these after I tried the Fluffy Pancakes on this site, and hated the taste of them. For these, I left out the oil in the batter because the batter was already very runny for my taste. I also cooked with cooking spray instead of oil. I only added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and even that I think was too much. It just didn't taste much like a pancake and was too thin. Maybe I did something wrong. I did let it sit for 5 minutes. I would never make these again.

Excellent, yummy, fluffy pancakes.  Love the addition of the cinnamon; although, I did cut it in half in fear of it being overpowering.  In the end, we felt they would have been great with the full amount, so my mistake.  Seeing the whole family pleased with recipe, I will be repeating this one!

These are delicious, cinnamon pancakes.  We loved them.  I'm not sure they're any more fluffy than any other pancake I've made, but they certainly were good!

I liked these but I found them to be very dense in texture and kind of heavy. I will try to make them again to give them another shot but I may change things up a bit.

Yummy Pancakes and they passed the kid test but the recipe calls for too much cinnamon. I did cut this to 2tsp and felt I could have used less. They are nice and fluffy pancakes that melt in your mouth.

These pancakes live up to their name! They are extraordinarily thick and fluffy! I only used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and it was perfect. 1 Tbsp. would have been WAY too much. I also rounded up to 1 full tsp. of vanilla, and I let the batter sit for a full 15 minutes. They came out nice and thick. I paired these with fried cinnamon apples (2 peeled and diced apples, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 Tbsp. butter), which created a sweet, thick syrup to top the pancakes with. I will never use pancake mix again now that I know how easy it is to make them from scratch!

These are so easy to make and cook and I loved the taste and texture. I will reduce the amount of sugar next time, but other than that, they were perfect.

I'll have to make these again, to get a truer idea of this pancake, overall. Because so many noted the cinnamon was too strong, I only used 1/2 tablespoon, then tasted the batter. Since it did not taste overpowering, I added the other 1/2 tablespoon, so more stirring. These did not "fluff" as I would like, and the batter was thin. To add more flour would require still MORE stirring, so I'd like to try it next time using the full tablespoon cinnamon and adding an extra tablespoon or so flour.

Loved this one is so simple, fluffy and yummy!  Everyone loves them.  I double it and put it on my pampered chef bar pan when we have lots of guests stay over usually on the holidays.   Makes it much easier while cooking other things.  Big batch comes out at once :) excellent recipe

I made these once recently and plan on making them again this morning. I substituted some wheat flour for some of the white and added frozen blueberries to them while the were cooking and they were delicious! !! The best pancakes I ever made even with the full TBSP of cinnamon! The cinnamon flaver esp. With the blueberries was so good I snacked on them later on that day without syrup and I'm not even a big fan of blueberries! Definitely a keeper! My husband and kids like them too!

Just made for breakfast this morning and they are light and fluffy just how I like my pancakes. 

I did omit the cinnamon because to me it wasn't necessary for my flavor pallet.

This one is a keeper! (5 stars)

These are the ONLY pancakes that I ever make!  My kids even request them by "name"!  My family is full of pancake lovers, and ever since we've started using this recipe, there are no more "boxed" pancake mixes for them!  The pancakes are consistently moist, fluffy and have great flavor-- the way pancakes were meant to be!  We change some of the measurements of sugar, vanilla and cinnamon to our tastes, but it is also awesome the way the recipe is written.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

These were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and loved the cinnamon flavor. I made cinnamon syrup (another recipe on this site) to eat with my pancakes, and that was too much cinnamon. Next time I'll make a different syrup for these pancakes.

This is good. I didn't use the entire amount of baking powder, more like 2 tsp's. Used melted butter instead of oil. My batter sat for an hour prior to using and it was fine (contrary to previous review). I wasn't about to use a tablespoon of cinnamon - I used maybe 1/2 tsp. Also grated some fresh nutmeg in. Nice, simple easy recipe. I'll use it again. Thanks Janice :)

This is basically our go to pancake recipe. My son LOVES cinnamon, so the amount of cinnamon is perfect for us. I add a touch more vanilla. Other than that this recipe is perfect. Fluffy delicious pancakes every single time.

I didn't find these pancakes particularly fluffy.  I took others' recommendations to reduce the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and used applesauce instead of oil.  I will probably go back to using the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe which I prefer to this one.

These turned out great!! I followed the advice of some reviews and only used about two teaspoons cinnamon. This was my first time making homemade pancakes. I normally just use the batter. I won't be buying any boxed batter anymore!! It's sometimes difficult for me to find vanilla extract (I'm currently living in the Middle East), I wonder how it would be without it?

Extra-Yummy Fluffy Pancakes' Haiku: "Not 'extra-yummy', the cinnamon was too strong. But fluffy, they were." I should've known better than to dump a whole TB of cinnamon into this, as directed, b/c whew, that's all that I tasted. I figured w/ that being the dominant flavor, I'd eat them w/ hunks of apple and a drizzle of syrup, but I couldn't quite shake that overwhelming cinnamon taste. But the title including "fluffy" didn't disappoint - these were thick and filling, but nowhere near as good as the "Fluffy Pancake" recipe on here. Oh and I couldn't bring myself to use additional oil in the skillet, so I just went w/ a heavy squirt of Pam in b/t batches.

This is a good recipe, with one exception (to my palate). The cinnamon! I added much less (about 1/4 tsp) and I still thought it was too much, I can't imagine what the full amount would be like. To be fair, I am not a huge cinnamon fan, and I will probably omit it all together next time. They were indeed very fluffy and worlds above a box mix. I also appreciated the fact that this recipe calls for oil and not melted butter like many recipes do---a little more convenient.

I didn't have regular milk on hand so I used sour cream.  I've read on different sites that sour cream can be a substitute for buttermilk recipes. I still mixed the sour cream with vinegar. These pancakes came out so moist and fluffy.

I made these for my brother and I this morning and neither of us cared for them. 
The initial sight of these made me feel like I was eating some sort of vegan, healthy, flax pancakes and so naturally I was disappointed. This uses way too much cinnamon and overtakes all the flavor, these don't feel "fluffy" when you make them, they feel really cakey.

It was good yet when you adjust it to twelve serving the batter was extremely watery. Add about 2 and a half cups of flower about a cup of sugar a table spoon of baking powder and two table spoons of baking soda. Very sweet and yummy

These were quite nice, and a bit of a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon, but it's okay, and I thought 1 T. of it in this small batch of batter would be too much, but it turned out fairly mild, to me. And I don't really care much about "fluffy" pancakes or not, but these did seem to turn out a bit fluffier than other recipes I've tried. I made the recipe exactly as written. I've never used oil on my griddle (it's non-stick, I guess), but I tried it here and it seemed to be superfluous. I did find that it took at least 3 minutes per side for the pancakes to cook long enough. All in all, this is a pretty nice recipe.

Mine did not come out very fluffy, but they were still tasty.  We only added about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and even that seemed like a bit much, but it was a nice change from plain pancakes.  I probably won't make these exactly the same next time, but I think I will cross this and the other Fluffy Pancakes recipe we use (use buttermilk or soured milk, melted butter instead of oil) next time.  I do love that this recipe included vanilla!  Surprisingly, many pancake recipes do not, so we always add it as our "secret ingredient" :)  All in all, I do recommend trying this one - just use your discretion as far as the amount of cinnamon is concerned!

I did not care for this recipe. I had saved the recipe and forgotten to re-read the comments and made it as written. There is a ridiculous amount of cinnamon. Aside from that, they are so brown to begin with it's hard to tell when they're, well, brown.

These were very fluffy.  I replaced the oil with canned pumpkin.

We loved this - today is a cold, snowy Sunday!  I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and served with maple syrup and bacon.  Perfect!  Will make this often.

I used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the called for 1 tbsp.  It was very nice. I will make these again. I have been waiting for a nice recipe like this.

Lets face it the basic pancake is not a knock your socks off flavor experience. I was attracted to this recipe because it had "real" quantities of cinnamon / vanilla....not the meager 1/2 teaspoon found in most recipes. On the other hand I was concerned about the tablespoon of baking powder..seemed a bit risky. All in all these are nicely flavored pancakes, get a hint of the baking powder, but not a deal breaker. Probably cut back to 3/4 Tbls the next time. Key to texture is to not go beyond the 5 minutes after mixing the dry with the wet. Baking powder reacts very quickly with moisture so waiting any longer will not increase the fluff factor.... just the opposite.

Best. Pancakes. Ever. These are delicious. I didn't have baking powder so i used baking soda and cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, added a little extra sugar and some lemon juice. The five minute rest is very important! I also tried this recipe with chocolate chips, awesome!

These are SO GOOD! I've tried other pancake recipes to mix things up and I always come back to this one because it is consistently delicious. One change I make to it: I add more flour to make the total 1 2/3C flour. It helps thicken up the batter.

I did cut the cinnamon by almost half and we enjoyed the flavor of these pancakes.  Since my baking powder was out of date, will have to see if they are a little more fluffy in the future; texture was still nice and light.

I have always used the ready made pancake mix and one morning i had run out.  I tried this recipe and now i will never go back to mixes!  The family could'nt stop raving about how good they were! I cut the cinnamon back to a 1/4 tsp for a double batch but that is all i changed.  Best pancakes we've ever had!

I made these for my family and they absoloutely love them. The kids and my wife told me that they are the best pancakes they have ever had. I cut the amount of cinamon by half though and added a tad bit more vanilla. I love to watch them eat and be happy.

These are very flavorful, moist pancakes. My boys loved them. Like others, I thought a TBSP of cinnamon was a bit much, so I cut it in half. There was still a nice cinnamon flavor, but I think the full amount would have been over-powering.

Flavorful, and Easy and best of all my extremely picky daughter LOVED them; I did read through some reviews and only used 2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1 tbs. and it was was the perfect amount; I used vanilla soy milk instead of traditional milk and this didn't seem to matter either; The five minute wait noted in the recipe is imp.-can't wait to try these again with apples on top!! This is the FIRST pancake my daughter has ever been happy with, homemade or boxed, this is saying something considering she will be 14 soon! I mean I didn't even have to fish for an opinion or compliment, she just had a bite and said, "Wow, these are good!" Thank You Janice!!

This recipe was OK. I honestly only did not add the cinnamon because the hubby is not a fan. However, the vanilla gave it a subtle flavor for a change, but was not thrilling or anything. Still, the pancakes were not as fluffy as the recipe flaunts....I even gave it an extra minute of rest. This recipe would benefit from replacing the vegetable oil for butter and or at least the adding of buttermilk or soured milk to add flavor AND fluff. They are indeed light, but somewhat flat in flavor and texture. Will definitely not make it again. The "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe from this site, gives better results than this recipe.

It would have been 1 star, but I added chocolate chips and added some more sugar which made it taste better. Flat pancakes.

Did only 2 tsp of cinnamon and full tsp of vanilla per other review suggestions, but probably would stick with full 1 tbsp of cinnamon next time. Also, think will skip the salt as well as they seemed to taste a bit salty.

Did the job! Probably not the best pancakes I've ever made, but no complaints. I used chocolate nutmilk instead of regular milk because i was out. I also added little bits of dark chocolate in :P  very easy to make. The batter was thinner than i was expecting, but it rose nicely.

No changes but I probably won't make these again.  They weren't fluffy, just as flat as my usual pancakes.  Think I'll try a recipe where you separate the egg and see if that makes them fluffy.

A super tasty recipe! They are like a mix of French Toasts with Pancakes. Simply delicious! One thing I got to point out is that sometimes the batter is perfect and sometimes  is a bit harder than usual. I double check to see if I did something wrong but no. The only difference that I could notice was the temperature in my house. On colder days the batter is more liquid and on hot days the batter gets harder. To fix the hard batter just simply add more milk.

This is the best pancake recipe, the cinemon was a little too much so i cut it down a bit. When i finished the batter it was a bit runny so i put some more flour in. When it was done i tasted it and i think i hit the best recipe i wish i could give you an award it was amazing. I am definitely going to make i again.

I really liked the texture of these pancakes. They were  quite fluffy. There was WAY too much cinnamon for our taste though. Next time I will significantly decrease the amount of cinnamon added to the recipe.

I'm curious if the full tablespoon is a typo.

This is a great pancake recipe. It uses ingredients I always have in my household, and the mixture is easy to make. The vanilla and cinnamon add a nice touch to the pancakes and give it a cool sweetness so not too much sugar is used. I like that it isn't too sweet, and that it's just right. I think this is the recipe for pancakes I'm gonna use from now on.

I added a pinch of cinnamon instead of the full tablespoon and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla instead. I also substituted agave for sugar and the pancakes turned out fine.

These pancakes were amazing! I cut the cinnamon down to 1 teaspoon, (as I am not a fan of it) and letting the batter sit for 5-10 minutes make the perfect combination for a perfect pancake. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and my pancakes were flat and gross. The batter went straight down the garbage disposal. I did try cooking four groups of four pancakes each just to make sure it wasn't a case of "first batch is a throw away".  It was a very disappointing experience.

Used all the cinnamon called for. Was in a hurry and did not allow batter to sit, therefore it was pretty runny and pancakes were not very fluffy. However, that's my fault, and there were NO complaints. Six kids and a husband gobbled them up and everyone loved the cinnamon flavor! I'll put this in my pancake recipe rotation. Oh, and subbed in a little bit of wheat flour.

Quick, easy and the kids ate 3-4 pancakes each. No joke! I was a little concerned about put 1 tablespoon of cinnamon into the batter but it seemed to work. I did add a full teaspoon of vanilla & aside from that followed the recipe exactly. The key is to let the batter rest as long as possible. Delicious with chopped apples on the side & some whip cream. YUM!

Little too much cinnamon for my husband so will cut back next time to about 1/2 Tablespoon.  We added raisins to them and they were quite tasty.

Alright where to start on this? I did everything beside I didn't use oil on my griddle. But these are not "pancakes" that picture is a fake and these are more like creepes. I used the 2tsp of cinnamon instead of the top, cause that would be too much! And I used 1tsp rather then 3/4 of vanilla extract. They aren't that bad, but they aren't the "american fluffy pancakes" they were hard to turn unless they were as thin as you can get them, then it i as like the middle never cooked, it definitely didn't take 2 minutes to cook per side and it burned very fast. They fell apart when trying to flip, I ended up trying to make three, then ended up dumping the rest of The batter into the trash and moving on with my day. Not worth my time, and I wouldn't make them again.

Did nobody else find the batter way too thick? I added water until it got a little runny (probably around a half a cup of water). It was still too thick. If you like really fluffy pancakes that are an inch thick, then this is your recipe. But if not I'd try another.

I don't like cinnamon all that much, so I added just a teaspoon of cinnamon for just a hint of that cinnamony flavour with a teaspoon of vanilla. I have a bag of self raising flour I want to get rid of, so I just used it instead of plain flour with baking powder. I had to add a bit extra milk (maybe a few teaspoons?) before I thought the consistency of batter good enough. Despite the many changes, the pancakes turned out absolutely divine! It was my first time making pancakes, and I will definitely make them again. Pancakes w/ maple syrup for dinner ftw!

OMG THANK YOU! I'm never making boxed mix again! The recipe made me the fluffiest homemade pancakes I've ever had. I did take the commenters' advice and went way lower on the cinnamon, and even then it was still a bit strong for my own taste. I'm going to start experimenting with adding fruit to them. 
Thank you for finally making my pancake Sundays delicious!

They were not as fluffy as I had hoped. Next time I would only put about a tsp instead of a Tbsp of  cinnamon.

Surprised these are only 4 stars compared to the typical # pancakes recipes always ranked at the top, these are way better. We make homemade pancakes every weekend, hate the mix and it only takes 2 minutes longer.  Don't be afraid of the monster amount of cinnamon, these are really good.  careful with the salt. I wouldn't go the full amount , maybe  slightly more than half of amount called for.

I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and thats a perfect amount. Mine turned out extremely flat (possibly over-mixed?) I even let the batter sit for 10+ Minutes. All in all, the flavor of the cakes is good! But flat for me unfortunately :-/

Theyre delicious! But not as fluffy as the reviews made it sound to be. I also taste the baking powder in the pancakes. But I followed the reviews advice and decreased the cinnamon and added extra vanilla. I also crushed up Oreos and added them in and that was amazing!

Great recipe. However, too much cinnamon and too little sugar for me. I don't like a lot of syrup, so I like my pancakes to be a bit sweeter. But they were definitely perfectly fluffy!

Overall, this recipe came out good as the pancakes did come out fluffy and did taste good. However, the cinnamon was overpowering. The next time, I will reduce the amount of cinnamon to 1/2 Tbsp, and increase the amount of vanilla. I think then it will be perfect!

I made this as directed, except I reduced the amount of cinnamon and sugar to suit our tastes. They came out great! Very glad fluffy, as I let the batter sit for 10mins before cooking. They are a bit dense, but I was happy with the overall result

I was expecting a sweeter taste and instead got a bitter and slightly salty taste. I will try it again with a little less salt and a touch more sugar and see how it goes. They didn't come out fluffy either. Maybe it's my ingredients....IDK, but I want it to work better. I love cooking with cinnamon. I would not use my review to turn you off to trying this because we all know that making something for the first time is always a gamble and others seem to be having success with it.

I just made this for my wife this morning. She told me to give it 5 stars hands down... I did reduce the amount of cinnamon based on the  other reviewers suggestion. I also let it sit while the pan heated up. I used a 100 year old cast iron #8 frying pan that has been passed down through several generations. These pancakes were light, fluffy, and sweet... A definite keeper... As an addendum, it should be noted that my mother-in-law who is a very picky eater of other peoples food, thought these were fantastic. Let me tell you, if she likes it, there's nobody that won't love it...

These are the best pancakes I've ever made. Extra fluffy! my pancakes used to be so hard before.
I didn't add cinnamon or vanilla extract as my kids do not like cinnamon. I've printed out the recipe and stuck on my fridge! My kids just kept asking for more. Thanks a lot for this recipe!

I love this recipe.  I always double it to feed my family of four, and I usually have a few left over.  I find this recipe calls for too much milk though.  As I said, I double all ingredients, leaving the milk for last.  As with making bread, I start with 1 1/2 cups and continue adding it until I get the consistency I want, usually somewhere around 2 cups total for a doubled recipe.  And I go heavy on the vanilla.  Most times I use melted butter instead of the oil, but using the oil is also fine.  Last night I added chopped fresh peaches.  Delicious!

Very nice taste and texture. I have been experimenting with different pancake recipes and this one cooked up beautifully and easily. Next time, I would cut the cinnamon just a bit as others recommended but keep everything else the same.

Perfect Perfect Perfect! But the only thing I have a question about is the cinnamon. I added the whole tablespoon but I felt like it was too overpowering. But probably the only reason why is because I am not really a cinnamon fan.

We love this recipe, although letting it sit seems to be the key to the fluffiness - the ones I cook initially are very dense and they get fluffier as we go along. So I would recommend letting the batter sit more than 5 minutes. We love cinnamon so everyone loves these, and we always double it since we have a family of 6 and need plenty of pancakes.

not only are these NOT the fluffiest pancakes, but extremely disappointing on so many levels. They were flat and the amount of cinnamon made it impossible to add anything else to it for flavor.

These are really good, if you love cinnamon! They were very fluffy. But I did not care for the dark color created by the cinnamon either. I did use Saigon cinnamon, not sure if that made a difference or not. I will try it without the cinnamon next time.

Well I hate to say, but mine did not turn out anything like the picture. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were flat and way too sweet. I love pancakes so I'm pretty disappointed, but glad everyone else had good luck. I don'y know what I did wrong.

I loved the strong cinnamon flavor. They smelled amazing while frying. Even my picky hubby enjoyed them. We serve them with home canned peach, blueberry and strawberry jam.  I think our grape butter would be good, too.

I replace the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce. You can add a handful of blueberries or chocolate chips right after you pour the pancakes to make blueberry or chocolate chip pancakes. They're a real hit!

These are so moist, fluffy, and tasty. I swapped the oil for applesauce & did not add the cinnamon. You just have to be careful not to make them so big, otherwise you risk some of them not being fully cooked through.

These were dense, the total opposite of fluffy. I followed the recipe specifically, and was very disappointed. I did top them with a homemade berry syrup that made them less of a failure.

If you don't wait five minutes, they are a bit runny. My fault. After the first round, they were perfect. I didn't measure the cinnamon just went with my gut. Also, I made with whole wheat flour because it's what I use in everything.

The cinnamon and vanilla added such a great flavor to these pancakes! I've been searching for a recipe that is easy to make and packed with flavor and this does just that! Highly recommend. The only change I made was I melted 3 Tbsp of butter and them tempered the egg with the melted butter.

It was okay. Some of it is taste preference and some of it is the large amount of cinnamon. Since one of my peeves are reviewed recipes where the reviewer didn't actually make the recipe, I did it to the letter this time. Next time I would reduce the cinnamon to the same amount as the vanilla - but the texture was fantastic and if you love cinnamon, as is would be the best way to try this recipe!

Way too much cinnamon, and not really very fluffy. My plan is to cut the cinnamon to a teaspoon, add one more egg, and separate yolks from whites. Then fluff the whites and fold them in last--that's a guarantee for fluffy.

Make really good pancakes every time.  Add ins are easy : blueberries, chocolate chips etc.  The only thing is with this recipe you have to oil the pan every so often or your pancakes don't brown like they should.

I made these this morning since I ran out of the Great Value Extra Fluffy pancake mix I usually use.  Very easy to mix up!  can't believe I spend money on pancake mix! LOL!   Anyway, I didn't add quite a whole T. of cinnamon, because I knew my little guy wouldn't like them if they tasted too cinnamony.  I let them sit a little more than 5 minutes, but they were too runny.  I added a little more flour and they were much better.  I will make them again.

My husband and I loved these.  I used 1tsp of cinnamon, as the called for amount seemed like too much for us.  They were still quite cinnamon-y.  I also reduced the oil in the pancakes to 2Tbs.  Really tastey!  I got 8 pancakes pouring 1/4c fulls into the pan.  Will use this recipe again!

I did not like these half as much as other recipes I have found on allrecipe.com.  I do like the cinnamon flavor, but I will probably added cinnamon to the recipe I usually use instead.  Probably won't make again.

I was looking for a simple and quick pancake mix for my family of 5. This is it! I had to double the recipe and when I did, I swapped out one cup of white flour for one cup of whole wheat flour (try to add it in where I can) and they rose nicely and where still fluffy with a  light taste of cinnamon... my kids loved them! This is definitely a keeper!

These were good. Seemed sort of dense, even though I followed this recipe exactly. Still, they made a pretty pancake that was edible and somewhat enjoyable. I'll keep looking for that perfect pancake, though.

Made this today and LOVED them!  I used soy milk instead of milk since my son is allergic to dairy, and they came out great.  My 2 year old had 3 pancakes!  Loved the super-cinnamon flavor.

yummy is certainly the right word for these!! I made a slight modification by decreasing the sugar to 2 tsp. and used 1cup white all purpose flour with 1/4 cup whole wheat all purpose flour; and 2tsp cinnamon. These were great!!

These pancakes were very light and fluffy. My family loved them. The only changes I made were that I only used 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and I omitted the vanilla extract and milk using Very Vanilla Silk soymilk instead. Delicious results.
