My oldest daughter gave this a 5 star the rest of us gave it a 3-4 star. My daughter just couldn't get enough. She said she'd eat it again tomorrow! I thought it was a bit over powering.

I really liked this... would have been perfect with some more veggies. Add more veggies and double sauce. I served over rice noodles

Easy recipe. I did not add mustard and added red and yellow peppers in addition to the green. I added a couple of dashes of a spicy pepper blend in the last 5 minutes to give it a little more of a kick.

Ended up marinating the chicken overnight. Instead of adding the onion and green pepper I used a bag of mixed oriental vegetables. This was very good served with a side of rice.

This was so good! The only change I made was to slice the chicken thin before adding to the marinade instead of after. This way more of the chicken is exposed to the marinade. I served it with rice and some garlic and mushroom green beans. I loved the chicken the next day--oh so flavorful!

Good preparation if you dont have much time and want something simple yet flavorful. Small changes per what I had available: chili sauce in stead of ketchup garlic powder instead of cloves dijon mustard and left out green peppers. Served with rice.

Good Choice I loved all the ingredients would make it at least 3 times a month.
