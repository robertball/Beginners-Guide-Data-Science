Very nice. No vegetable oil because I used most of it to fry chicken, so I used all butter. I also used buttermilk. Even when I cut the recipe in half, it baked up beautifully. Thirty minutes and wa-la, perfect. No issues with sinking bread when you thought it was done. And the flavor is very fluffy and sweet. My kids and husband especially liked this.  I served it with whipped butter and extra honey. Thank you for sharing your recipe. NOTE: I served this with Tanya's Louisiana Southern Fried Chicken and Broccoli Salad. It was a nice comforting dinner. EDITED: I've made this three times now, in 24 hours. My family has dubbed this the best cornbread they've ever had.

This cornbread is one of the best on the site!  It rivals "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" 'til now I thought that was my favorite.  I cut the recipe in half and used one up of cornmeal and one cup of flour.  It was perfectly done in 38 minutes - moist and delicous.  I think the only thing that could possibly make this better would be to replace the whole milk with buttermilk.

I am the original submitter.  I just wanted to note that if you decide to use buttermilk, you should add some baking soda.  Baking soda neutralizes the acidity of the buttermilk so that the flavor comes out rich and not tart/sour.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Instead of putting all the flour asked for, I used only a cup and a half and for the rest I used masa (or corn flour) to give a more cornlike taste.

I love this recipe - I am of the sweet cornbread persuasion.  I made it as written the first time and give it 5 stars, however, I've made it several more times and this is what I do now:  I use 2/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/3 cup oil and totally skip the butter, I use only 1 cup of sugar.  With these 3 minor changes I just love this cake!   It's still sweet, but just a little less.

Honey hush! This is the best comfort food since Cliff's chili on The Cosby Show. My seven-year old daughter helped make it and we could not wait for it to come out of the oven! When my husband came home, we had HUNKS of it! Thanks for sharing such an amazing recipe. This should be sold in restaurants ALL OVER! Look out Paula Deen! Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!

I made this for an office brunch and everyone loved it, even those who professed to not like cornbread. It was very simple to make.

This was AMAZING. I was literally eating the batter, it was so good. I halved the recipe for a 9 inch square pan, this baked for exactly 38 mins. I upped the cornmeal to 1 C & lowered the flour (used whole wheat) to 1 C. I don't keep whole milk on hand so I made a buttermilk substitute. I used skim milk & added a tablespoon of vinegar & let that sit for 10 mins before adding to the bowl. This recipe is just amazing. Best cornbread I have ever tasted. Right after making it, I ate 3 pieces, it was so good. Thanks for the recipe.

This cornbread is amazing! :) I baked mine into mini-loaf pans, which just made it better (since there was more of a crust on it). Delish!

This was just what I was looking for. I don't care much for regular, dry corn bread. This was very  moist and sweet. I did add a half a can of  corn, drained. (15 oz can) and I didn't have enough milk, so I used 1 1/2 C evaporated milk and 1 C water instead of the milk. YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, not your ordinary cornbread.  I substituted about half a cup of whole wheat flour and half a cup of ground flax for 1 cup of the white flour to make it feel a little healthier.  My 3 year old loved this "cake"!!

If cornbread had personalities, this would be on my best friends list! This recipe has a wonderful flavor and texture. I make half the recipe and bake it for 37 minutes in an 11x7 baking dish, and it comes out perfect each time. I whisk the wet ingredients together before adding to the dry ingredients. That way I don't over stir the batter. 2% milks works just as well as whole milk. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I found this recipe while searching around on here for a cornbread recipe to make for my husband.  I noticed he purchased slices of cornbread from a local gas station (now how sad is that?), and my southern pride was a bit bruised when he told me he preferred it over my own.  I was like okay, we'll see.  I found this recipe and didn't hesitate to make it.  After he had a slice, he loved it, and proceeded to eat more and more of it 'til he was practically stuffed!  LOL  Needless to say, I was so happy, and my pride was restored!  LOL     I do agree with the review of 'Doree' in that it was also a bit too sweet for my taste, too, but I had to give it five stars as it was such a hit with my husband and my children!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Judging my family's reaction to it, I'm sure I'll be revisiting it again!

I made this substituting King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour for regular white flour, and it came out wonderful.  (Also used real, naturally dried cane sugar.)  Only adjustment might be a little additional milk and levening.

It was easy to make, and came out light and fluffy.  Just like she said, it's a cakey type of cornbread.  Great for breakfast.

This came out fantastically, I've had to stop myself from eating too many pieces. I made a few changes, however. I used 1/4 cup of melted butter and only 1 cup of organic cane sugar. I added an extra half cup of corneal and replaced the vegetable oil with 2/3 cup of apple sauce and a tablespoon of olive oil. Oh, and instead of honey, I used two tablespoons of maple syrup. And let me tell you, this cornbread is delicious. It doesn't have the same flavor as the traditional Southern cornbread I tend to prefer, but that's okay. It melts in my mouth and the flavor is still excellent. Great recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I have been looking for the perfect cornbread. This is the best I have found yet! I didn't change a thing. I made it first a few days ago, followed the recipe exactly. I made it again today, using less sugar, 1 cup. Still great. This is my "go to" recipe now. I was looking for a cornbread recipe that made the cornbread rise. Nice, beautiful, big cornbread. This is it.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It's light, fluffy, and sweet. No, it's not your traditional cornbread, but if you're looking for a cornbread that you can butter and eat without anything else then this is it. Don't try it if you're diabetic or on a diet.

I love my cornbread sweet and have been looking for a good recipe.  Well, I found this GREAT one! It tastes like the sweet cornbread I had in a restaurant. My niece and nephew are not cornbread fans, but they loved this.  I will be making this again soon!

I was pleasantly surprised as a professional chef that this is one of the best cornbread recipes I've ever made. its light yet especially moist and has lots of flavor even without 
corn added. It is also extremely easy to make- a one bowl wonder!

Only the 2nd cornbread recipe I've found that my family will eat! I cut the recipe in 1/2 because there was just 4 of us and I never know if the cornbread will be a winner. I used 1/2 c. of sugar, and all butter as I try not to use vegetable oil. I also subbed ww pastry flour. Very delish!

Delicious cornbread!  Next time I make this I will probably use less sugar because it is pretty sweet.  Even with the amount of sugar called for this is wonderful cornbread. :)
Update:  I have made this again using only 3/4 cup sugar instead of the full amount and it came out perfectly!  I will definitely be making this cornbread again and again!

I followed he recipe exactly written and I was very happy with my results. The cornbread was moist, sweet, and a huge hit at my mom's office (I bake for them every Tuesday for their staff meetings, I'm 13) I have tried at east 10 different cornbread recipes, but none came close to how great this one was. I highly recommend this one to kids that are my age and love to bake. It's quick and easy, but it tastes like you spent hours making it. I will definitely be making this again.

I have Celiace Disease so subbed out the all purpose flour for Masa harina flour, and subbed out the milk and butter with almond milk and almond butter. I love this recipe so does my whole family, it is truly lovely!

Excellent.  Not too sweet either.  I had to get rid of some buttermilk..so I used a cup of that as part of the milk for the recipe.

Fabulous! Makes a mountain of cornbread. Substitute applesauce for the vegetable oil, and it still came out fluffy but not greasy. Loved this!!!!

This came out really good, made it tonight.  Could be a little sweeter for my taste.  But the texture and flavor and ease of preparation was great.  And I have everything in the cabinet almost always (except the corn meal...).   Thanks!

These were just what I was looking for. I prefer cake-like cornbread rather than the traditional kind that my grandma makes. I added a 16oz bag of frozen corn to the batter. Yummy!

After I came back from Chicago to the UK I had to fine a corn bread recipe and this didn't disappoint.  I had to substitute the fat content due to pantry issues (used 2/3 cup butter and 1/3 olive oil) also switch honey for maple syrup.  Epic Corn bread that my son said he wants as his birthday cake now!

I had to return and rate this recipe!  It exceeded my expectations.  I did make a few healthy substitutions and my family LOVED it!  Instead of all-purpose flour, I used whole wheat flour.  Then, I used Splenda, skim milk and egg substitute and baked it all in an iron skillet.  Yummmmeee!  I was a little worried about the consistency of the batter, as it was very thick, but it baked up quite nicely.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Just made this tonight and it was delectable.  The only changes I made was to replace part of the flour with whole wheat ('bout a half cup) and the milk with evaporated milk + water.  Couldn't be easier and it was great with a side of ham and garlic spinach.

I made them into corn bread muffins to serve with some bar b que. I added a little more sugar than it called for and next time I will add even more. I also want them to taste more "corny" (haha!) so I will up the cornmeal as well. But a very good place to start, wayy better than all of the other ones I have tried. Good texture, just needs more flavor.

Excellent cornbread!  I halved the recipe and followed Jillian's recommendation of using a cup of flour and a cup of cornmeal.  It was sweet but not overly so!  I'd definitely make this again.

I am OBSESSED with this cornbread recipe. Oh. My. Goodness. Whenever I pop this baby in the oven my heart is overwhelmed with joy. I start drooling from the anticipation of indulging in this hunky pan of bread. WARNING: you will cry when you eat this, it's so beautiful, just ask my friend @cornbreadlover2!

Best cornbread recipe if you like it on the sweet side...which we do! My whole family loves this & devours a pan of this in 2 days! I slightly tweaked the recipe by substituting buttermilk for the whole milk and adding 1/2 t. of baking soda to neutralize the buttermilk (that took it to a whole other level!). Update:  I've since made this  using cake flour instead of all purpose flour to make this even more cake-like (remember: substitute 1 c. regular flour with 1 c. + 2 T. of cake flour.) It was moist, cake-like and delicious!

This recipe is the Berries! We do like more of the cornmeal flavor so I delete one cup of the flour and add one cup of corn meal. This is the only recipe I use now! Very tasty!

Yum! I didn't choose this recipe for it's healthy nature, but because my husband likes sweet cornbread. It delivered! Made it for New Year's Day to go with black-eyed peas and cabbage. Neighbors also loved it.

A NEW FAVORITE!  Very moist and just the right sweetness.  I made it according to the recipe and everything was perfect.  It was just like what we used to find in a bread basket at our favorite restaurant.  Thank you myfoursonsks for sharing!

This recipe is not cornbread in the traditional way - either sweet or not.  This is a sweet cake that happens to have cornmeal.  It is very good, but it is a rich cake rather than cornbread.  Taste is sweet and comforting though and terrific topped with extra honey and butter.  Work for cupcakes too, but not a cornbread by definition.

Easy recipe and really good. Sweet and light cake. Made enough that I could make some up as muffins and some as a cake. I'll be making this my regular cornbread recipe.

I love sweet cornbread.  I was afraid that this might be too sweet so I cut the sugar down to just 1 cup and I would say it was pretty perfect, I could have kept the sugar as the recipie stated and it would be great, too.  This was fluffy cornbread, which was awesome with so many recipies thin and dry.  Definatly a keeper!

A little on the oily side but one of the best I've tasted so far.  I will probably use all butter next time. I'm still looking for the 'one' like marie calendars.

Been making for 2 years and love it! Now I reduce the sugar a bit and is still fantastic.  Tried subbing applesauce for some of the fat and did not like the texture. Thanks for the great go to recipe!

I made this bread yesterday and let me tell you it was the BEST cornbread I have ever made. I split the recipe in half and used a round cake pan and it was about 3 inchecs high. My husband did not realize that it was homemade. My kids do not like cornbread and they both asked for seconds.  It was so moiste.  Thanks for posting this.

Absolutely delicious! Hubby commented several times on how much he liked the cornbread...it was so moist and flavorful! I halved the recipe and baked it in an 11x7 baking pan, and that was perfect. I had some buttermilk to use up, so I used that in place of the whole milk, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. This is hands down our new favorite cornbread recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'm sure this cornbread is super, however, I've been cooking it for 55 minutes and it's still batter in the middle. I suggest splitting into two for more even cooking.
I look forward to tasting it and seeing if it's like my mom's recipe.

Made it before and making it again. I followed the instructions to a T, only difference was, putting a sprinkle of ground cinnamon on the top of the batter before putting the dish into the oven to bake. People raved about it, even my father who claims he is a master chef, even he asked me for the recipe.

O.M.G.  I have been looking for the perfect, most delicious homemade cornbread recipe FOR YEARS!!!  And this it!!!!  I had never tried a recipe that was called "cornbread cake", so I thought why not?? And to my amazement, this was so good that I ate myself sick on it! After reading some reviews, I will reiterate that yes, this is a sweet cornbread. If you're looking for no sweetness, this recipe isn't for you.  Also, I cut the sugar back from 1 and 1/3 cup to 1 cup. Don't know how much of a difference it made, but my end result was fantastic!

My family and I are not fans of traditional corn bread, so I searched for a sweet corn bread and this is by far our favorite. We all love it every time I make it and I've made it many times over by this point. I prefer to add creamed corn to the recipe because that is my family's preference, but the recipe is outstanding as is.

BEST CORNBREAD EVER and we've tried quite a few. I used only 1 cup of sugar, 3 eggs (2 large, 1 extra-large- still think I should have used the fourth one) and soured milk (milk + vinegar). Baked up beautifully in the time the recipe states. I made this to serve with 'Chili I' one night and the other night 'Maple and Beer Lentil Stew' accompanied with honey butter. PURE PERFECTION; the cornbread hunt is over.

Best cornbread I ever made. Still not as moist and sweet as Boston Market's unbelievable cornbread but I'm sure this is not as fattening.

Love it...the closest I have come to Boston Market Cornbread...If you like it sweet and not so gritty~this is perfect! I soaked the cornmeal in a cup of milk for 15 mins or so....and baked as muffins! Perfect and yummy~thanks for sharing!

This is really good cornbread, but it does taste more like a dessert cake than cornbread. I ate several pieces fresh and hot out of the oven and thought it was really good. I think I'm used to more of a "cornmealy" texture, this had more of a cornmeal texture in the crust, but moist layer cake texture inside. My 5 year old couldn't wait for it to finish baking.  When it finally did, she loved it and wanted more. My husband also thought it was good too. I am going to hang on to this recipe, but next time use a little less sugar. I may give"Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" a try and then compare the two.

This recipe IS awesome! The ONLY changes I made was with the honey, and milk.  I FORGOT to add the honey to the mixture, so I made honey butter instead, and brushed it over the hot cornbread as soon as it came out of the oven.   I subbed b'milk instead of regular milk. The cornbread was so moist, and it baked up nice and soft.  I also baked this in a 10 in cast iron skillet.  I ate this with a basic chili recipe on a rainy, and cold day.. The few leftover slices we had?  I nuked my portion of cornbread in the microwave for about 30 seconds...Mmmmm hmmmmm!!! Tasted like it was just made! I'm a southern girl, and this is not my usual way of making cornbread, NEVERTHELESS, it's a cornbread CAKE, and I really enjoyed this one, and so did my fiance... a nice change from the norm!  This WILL be MY go to when I want to break tradition and do something different with my cornbread! Thanks for sharing!  Peace and blessings!

very good base recipe! I say base because I tweaked it. Used only 1.5 cups flour, 1 c. brown sugar instead of white sugar, 1 c. unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of whole milk, and 15 oz sweet creamed corn. It's very moist and oh so delicious!

This was great. Very moist compared to other cornbread recipes. I quartered the recipe and baked in muffin tins as there are just two of us.

Yum! Exactly what I was looking for in a cornbread recipe.  Many others are just too dry, but this was perfect. What made it really cool was I dried and ground corn into meal from my own garden and I have just enough to make another recipe.  I may cut out some sugar to make it a bit healthier, and I'll make mini loaves to freeze instead, but this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Super moist like it says it's almost cake like with a hint of that cornbread crumble. My one thing I think I'll do next time would be adding in some corn just to beef up the cornbread factor. Beyond that ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!

This was AMAZING!!! Best cornbread I've ever had! Only changes I made were: 1-1/4 C sugar instead of 1-1/3, I used 2% milk instead of whole, and I added 1 tsp vanilla. My whole family loved it, and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This came out light and airy, with a fabulous crumb. To make it a little healthier, I cut the sugar to 1 c. (and even that was really sweet!) and replaced half the oil/butter with applesauce. I also used a little more cornmeal and a bit less flour. My family loved it.

I love the sweetness to this corn bread.  Made a few changes: used 1.5 cups AP flour and 1.5 cups masa harina.  Cut the sugar to 1 cup. Used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup oil (only because I didn't want 1/3 stick of butter leftover)  Added a bag of frozen corn, and baked them in cupcake tins (made for a potluck, and wanted something easy for people to pick up instead of having to cut into slices).  It made about 24 total.  Also made some honey whipped butter to go with the cornbread.

This I the BEST cornbread recipe I've found! My kids LOVE it. I don't make as often as I used to because whenever I do, they eat the cornbread first and then don't eat anything else! Love it!!!

Hot !! This is a great and easy to bake recipe. Followed top reviewer advice to use 1c butter and omit the oil. Made it three times in the last week including a batch that made me boyfriend hero at my girls' office!

Made this tonight and it came out amazingly good. I even did a few subs. b/c of my diet. I cut the amount of sugar down by half and then used equal to make up for difference. Didn't use any butter. Cut the oil down to 1/3 of the amount in the recipe and substituted fat free mayo for the rest. Only used egg whites, but equal to the amount of egg in recipe. (Used about 2 egg whites from shelled eggs= 1 whole egg). Used whole wheat flour in place of white. Mixed dry ingredients in one bowel. Beat wet ingredients together. Beat eggs separate and then lightly mixed the beaten egg whites into the wet ingredients. Slowly mixed wet ingredients into dry while mixing. Also added a pinch more baking powder than recipe called for b/c used whole wheat flour. Since I couldn't finish the top off w/ butter I put just a pinch of honey on top while it was hot and spread it extremely thin (b/c only used a pinch). Made the top look shiny as if it had butter. Even those not on a diet loved the bread. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely awesome. So good warm with butter. Made this morning and almost gone. Great as a snack or for breakfast with coffee. Definitely a keeper.

I love sweet cornbread and this recipe is just what I like! Better than Marie Callender's or Krusteaz corn bread.

Wow - my husband loves cornbread (of the sweet variety) and I've been looking for months for the PRIMO cornbread recipe to make for him. I've tried many many different recipes, and can declare that this is the ONE! We prefer corn muffins to corn cake (just easier to take in for lunches), so I halved the recipe and the result made 12 good-sized corn muffins.  I baked the muffins at 350, for about 15 minutes or so (don't hold me to that - I wasn't sure how long to bake them as muffins so I kept checking them and pulled them out when a toothpick came out clean). They were moist, dense, not crumbly at all, and sweet (just like the submitter's description). Also, they were very easy to make.  My search for the perfect corn muffin/cake is over!

I made this last night but cut the recipe in half, used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the regular white flour, used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil, browned the butter and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.. WOW! Best cornbread i've ever had. I used a 9x9 inch pan and baked for about 30 minutes.

Used butter milk in place of whole milk, and poured extra honey on the top of the batter prior to baking! Created a nice sweet glaze, so good!

This was by far the best cornbread I have ever had.

I halved it, and used 1 cup cornmeal and 1 cup flour. Everything else I left the same (just... half). Baked for 35 minutes. Really, REALLY good.

Good corn bread!  Next time I will use less oil, and a bit more corn meal just for my taste.  Thank you for adding this recipe to share.  I will make this again.

My husband, kids and mother in law loved this cornbread. I made it exactly per the directions except I baked it in a cast iron skillet. It makes a very large batch so make sure you use a big enough baking dish. Next time I am going to use more cornmeal and less flour and also less sugar and see if they notice.

I was expecting more from this recipe. Just didn't do it for me, was expecting more of a lighter sweeter cake, but it was more dense.

ridic. i intended to sub out the oil for more butter, but didn't have enough butter on hand, so made as is with canola oil. i usually hate baking with oil, i can usually taste it, and feel its slimy texture, but omg this turned out pretty amazing. effortless and delicious. 1/2 the recipe baked in an 8x8 pan in 30 minutes. thank you!

I made this yesterday to go with chili... OMG, this is the best cornbread I have ever eaten, let alone made! I can't believe that I actually made something so delish! I followed the recipe exactly but halved it and put it in a 7X11 Pyrex brownie pan and baked it for 30 minutes. Absolutely perfect!

Needed a recipe quick when I realized we needed to make some cornbread. Did a quick search and picked this one because of the good rating, and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I would have to agree with another reviewer that said this recipe rivals "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread".  I have made that recipe as well and it is good, but this is better to me because I dont always have buttermilk in the house.

Great recipe, will make again!

Delicious! I think it's even better than the Krusteaz mix I tried before! If you like Sweet Cornbread, this is a must have for your recipe collection! I didn't have any milk on hand so I used buttermilk....it made it even richer! SO good!

This cornbread is amazing! I didn't change a thing. The best I have ever made! It's sweet, dense, but very cakelike. It's what i remember eating when I was little, unlike all those other cornbread recipes that are dry and blech. Thanks a million, myfoursonsks!

Loved this!  I followed the exact recipe, with the exception of using 1% milk instead of whole milk.  It baked up very nice and was very moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family HATES cornbread and I found a jar of cornmeal that needed to be used.  So I found this recipe and modified it to be more tasteful.  So on my first try(which i made today) I cut the sugar to 1 cup, instead of the butter and oil, I did 1/2 c melted butter and 1/2c applesauce.  I didn't have honey on me so I added maple syrup instead.  Then I used 2 cups of buttermilk(if you don't have any then add 1tbsp of vinegar to 1 c milk) and 1/2 c orange juice.  Then I added 1-2 tbsp of orange rind. Plus I added 1-2 tsp of vanilla extract to give it a little kick.  To make them look cute I baked them in muffin pans and also in the super mini muffin pans.  They turned out yummy and very flavourful.  Yum Yum :)

This is great--light and tasty!!  I modified using 1% milk instead of whole and cane sugar instead of white sugar and white whole wheat flour.  I also added 1 can of cream-style corn to make it super-moist!

I have been searching for this recipe for over 15 years!  Just as the name implies, it's a sweet, cakey cornbread.  Some might consider it more of a corn-flavored yellow cake than an actual corn bread.  You could even put some vanilla frosting on it, and it would be wonderful.  My mother made a similar dish when I was a child.  Then she lost the recipe, and I was never able to duplicate it.  Every time I saw recipes for "sweet cornbread", I'd give them a try and be disappointed.  Now I've finally found it!  I will hold on to this one and print several copies!  :)  Thanks so much for posting it, myfoursonsks!

Absolutely fabulous!  This was light and fluffy and just sweet enough.  My neighbors and kids ate two batches of this in one day!  I was out of oil as well and substitued 2/3 cup of melted butter (making one cup of melted butter).  Awesome!  I will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe! I've made this a couple of times and each time it gets gobbled up. I do add a little more honey than usual because I like the cake-y part of cornbread more than anything, but all and all; this has become my only cornbread recipe that I use! :)

This is an excellent cornbread recipe! I made it as written, except I ran out of baking powder and didn't have quite two tbs. Because of this, the cornbread had a somewhat denser texture, almost pudding like in the middle. It was still very, very good...almost everyone in my family loved it! I really want to try it again with the full amount of baking powder, to see if it is even better that way.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it again!

Traditional, savory cornbread....no.  Delicious....YES!  We love sweet cornbread, and this recipe is a superb version.  We've made it twice now, and it came out fabulous both times.  The first time we made it in our cast iron skillet to get the extra crispy edges that we love.  Although it made a bit of a mess in the oven (our pan just wasn't quite big enough for all the batter) it was amazingly good.  We followed the recipe's directions the second time, and made it in a 9x13....once again, success!  Thanks so much for the recipe....no more searching for the perfect cornbread.

I was looking for a recipe similar to Marie Callendar's and this is pretty close.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 glass pan.  45 min at 350 was just perfect.  oh sooo good!!

It IS moist! But a little too sweet.. I would make a great dessert!  I will try to use some whole wheat flour and more corn meal and a little less sugar.. I like the idea of ground flax.. we'll see.

I've been baking since the time I was 12 years old and never I have I had cornbread taste as delicious as this recipe. My husband never gets excited about food so when I heard him say yum I knew it was a winner! It looks like we will be having chili and cornbread for dinner! Thank you to whomever submitted this recipe!

It's snowing here so I had planned to make cornbread and chowder.  We are almost out of milk  so I got creative.  I had a bunch of very ripe bananas so I used all the dry ingredients and  mixed 2 cups water with 4 ripe bananas and a mixture of oil/melted butter to equal a cup.  I didn't add the honey because the bananas made it sweet.  It was supposed to be a breakfast bread in the morning, and luckily, there is still some left for tomorrow, because we had it for dessert.  So moist.  The point being that use what you have and adapt.  Breads are versatile and breakfast breads are a treat.

This is a lovely moist cornbread! It is sweet and light. My friends loved it and want the recipe.  I'm making it a second time to go with my chili. I did use 1 1/2 c. cornmeal and 2 1/2 c. flour. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I listened to the original submitter and added some baking soda.  I have been searching for a cornbread that is moist and not dry like the recipe on the cornmeal box!
This one fits the bill!

I’ve never heard if cornbread “cake” before and I did not like it at all. The flour to corn meal ratio was off and I did not enjoy the cake like texture of it. Cornbread is supposed to be gritty/grainy the way cornmeal is, and this was  fluffy and soft, more like cake. 
I give it 3 stars because it wasn’t bad for what it was, it’s just not cornbread. Now I understand the 1 star review that said it’s great for people who don’t like cornbread. I tossed it and made a simpler smaller recipe that turned out perfect. I’m just disappointed that I used the eggs and milk for this recipe and it didn’t turn out the way I wanted.

This cake was a hit in the house however not as sweet as I care for it to be. When I was mixing it was really soupy at first and then had major clumps so I took my immersion blender to it and felt better. Took a little longer than 45 minutes. This was a recipe that I would use again, just with a touch more sugar.

I have been looking for the perfect recipe for cornbread that was sweet and moist and finally found it. The only change I made was to use 1% milk as that is what I had on hand. It didn’t seem to affect the result. The cake rose to the top of my 9 x 13 glass cooking dish and the taste and texture was just what I was looking for.

I did this and only changes I made was I changed the ratio of flour to cornmeal from 3 to 1, to 2 to 2. I think it gives it more of a cornbread texture while still keeping the cake texture. It tastes wonderful very sweet, moist and tastes great with chili (or just by itself). This is the only cornbread we make anymore.

This is a great recipe! Sweet, moist and less dense. Don’t get me wrong, I love a traditional, coarse cornbread baked in cast iron, but this was a nice twist. It works great with gluten free baking flour and vanilla almond or soy milk! G/f breads are usually too dense

I made this for thanksgiving. I added a half can of creamed corn, and although the recipe was very moist, it lacked a “corny” taste. Next time I will try roasting the cornmeal, as suggested in other reviews.

Great recipe!  I was looking for a made-from-scratch cornbread recipe that tasted as good as Jiffy mix.  This cornbread is better!  I'm  planning on making a double batch of corn muffins for our church's weekly breakfast for those who are food insecure in our area.  I know they will love it!

Lots of changes! 
- used Mazola, had no butter in the house. 
- used half white half brown sugar
- used half buttermilk half milk
- added baking soda to the mix
- replaced some of the flour with bisquick type pancake mix

I was out of milk and honey, so I subsituted 1/4 C Brown sugar for the honey and water for the milk. It came out great. Cornbread with a sweet zing. I will make this again sometime.

I did like this, but I would try using buttermilk next time.  I was looking for the cornbread cake to be a bit richer...almost to a pound cake texture, but not quite.  
Good recipe though!

I don't usually write reviews on here, but...
Today I was making tamale pie for dinner, this one here..
While the meat was simmering I was going to start mixing the cornbread and found I was out of jiffy mix. I was scrambling for a quick cornbread recipe and this one popped up first. I started getting nervous about it when I saw how thin the batter was, pretty runny. 
It made a lot more than I needed so I used what I needed for the tamale pie and put the rest in a cornbread pan. 
After I put the tamale pie in the oven I got to thinking about how runny the batter was and looked at the recipe again to check cooking time and see how it jived with the tamale pie cooking time. THAT'S when I really looked at the title of the recipe and saw CAKE. WHAT? Cornbread CAKE?? So I spent the next 50 minutes debating whether to go to Subway or Cain's Chicken when my tamale pie was ruined...
No worries.. BEST tamale pie ever! This cornbread recipe is now part of my tamale pie recipe.
I just tried a piece of the cornbread from the other pan. Great flavor but a little too much "cake" texture for my taste. I'll retest with butter in the morning ; )

I have never been a huge fan of cornbread because I always thought it seemed too dry but I love the texture of this cornbread. Fluffier and less crumbly than most cornbread I have had with a nice sweetness. I like it with butter & my husband drizzles honey on it. The only adjustment I have made was to bump the cornmeal to 1 1/2 cups and lower the flour to 2 1/2 cups just because I wanted a little more "corn" flavor.  This is my go-to cornbread now!

My grandmother used to make sweet cornbread but her recipe was simplier. She used 1 cup self rising flour,  1cup corn meal and 1cup of sugar, 2 eggs, and enough milk or butter milk to make a batter. She would put butter or lard in an iron skillet in a 400 degree oven until it was sizzzling take it out and pour the batter into the skillet, then put it in the oven for about 20 minutes or until done. The edges came out so crispy and delicious we would burn our mouths because we could not wait for it to cooloff.. .

I love this recipe! I make recipe as is EXCEPT I use only 1 cup sugar. Then I sprinkle a couple tablespoons of brown sugar on top before baking. It gives the top and edges a nice crunch.  Yum! I have been making it for years and get raves every time.

I made this last night.  The batter felt very liquidy to me, but it turned out great!  Did rise pretty high.  Because of time restraints ended up serving as dessert, but will pair with leftover chili for lunch tomorrow. Btw, did substitute gluten free flour.  Turned out great!

This recipe rocked.  I replaced the all purpose with fresh milled flour and my kids still loved it.  I poured the batter in to skillet that I had just fried up some bacon and it gave the bread a nice crust.  Mix a piece with some ice cream and I think I was in heaven for 3 minutes!

Should be called “Hint-of-corn Cake”
Wish I’d read more reviews or trusted my gut when reading the ingredients. Someone else said it better: good cornbread for those who don’t like cornbread. I do like cornbread, and this doesn't cut it. Sorry, not a fan.

This cornbread is the Hercules of cornbread. It is your friend that casually has a six-pack without trying. It is delicious without effort and the only reason I have an account on this website. You could have the baking skills of a squirrel and it would still turn out flawless.

I have tried so many different recipes for corn bread and I have found a winner.  I knew it when my husband yelled as soon as he ate a bite.  Thats how I know its good lol.  I followed the recipe exactly, only using almond milk instead of regular milk.  Came out perfect.  Wasn't too sweet and still tasted like corn bread.  In my opinion there was no need to adjust the flour and corn meal.

This is so good.  Even though it doesn't use that much cornmeal in proportion to the amount of white flour, you still get a corn bread taste, just not as much. It has all the flavor and texture I was looking for in a cornbread, sweet and moist.  It's a large recipe and there are only 2 of us so there was plenty left over for the next morning and dinner, even after my husband had several pieces during the day. Delicious on these cold Maine winter days.

Deliciously very moist and cake-like. I added 1/2 cup frozen corn to the batter...but is not really needed.  This is my go-to recipe for corn bread going forward.

Followed recipe with 1 change suggested by other reviews. Only used 1 cup of sugar. Everyone loved it and sending the recipe to 4 at the party. I divided in 2 and used 2 loaf pans at 39 minutes.

Delicious! After reading the other reviews I made just one adjustment. I used 1 1/2 cup cornmeal and 2 1/2 cups flour and it came out exactly how I like it. I would definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE cornbread, but usually it’s great right from the oven and dries out by morning. This one right here I followed to a tee and yummy! Next day was still super moist! I am so making  this again and again! Two days later still moist!

This recipe was just ok. I made it as directed. I love cornbreads... sweet or not. This was not a typical cornbread.. so, I was a little disappointed. As a result, I will not make this recipe again. Also, WAY too much fat! 
I will keep looking for a better recipe.

This recipe was so simple, yet so good! I took a huge risk and used wheat flour because it''s all I had at home and STILL the cornbread turned out just as the title reflects: nice and sweet and also very moist and fluffy. I loved it and will definitely make it over and over again!!

This was an excellent recipe. My daughter and I made this and substituted the milk with almond milk. It was the consistency of a pound cake yet light and fluffy at the same time. It was so delicious and I’m very pleased at how well this turned out.

Great recipe! If you want a sweeter taste. 1-2 tablespoons of honey will do.

This was definitely more like cake. Not bad, but not what I was looking for in a cornbread. I have yet to find a recipe I like. I had the best cornbread at a family reunion, but no one fessed up as to who made it, let alone the recipe... I'll keep looking.

Delicious cornbread. After reading some reviews I did decrease sugar to 1 cup. I added some smoked Gouda cheese and crisp bacon because I thought the smokiness would blend well with the sweetness and I was right! I also cooked it in a cast iron skillet.

Delicious, moist, fluffy, slightly sweet cornbread. I won't be able to eat regular cornbread again.  I followed the video directions exactly: mix the dry, mix the wet, and then mix them together and it came out  amazing. Don't expect the final product to look like the picture on the video link; whoever made that must have added a lot more butter or sugar or buttermilk.

Amazing. You get the crunchy exterior of cornbread with a moist cake-like sponge inside. Next time I make it, I will try it with half cornmeal and half flour to up the corn flavor, but that’s just personal preference. This was super easy and spot on.

Occasionally I might use Smart Balance margarine instead of butter. My family loves it and it does not last long around the house.

I love this recipe. I'm not vegan because I eat honey, so I call myself plant based. I get so aggravated with a lot of the vegan recipes online that make cooking/baking fairly uncomplicated things into an ordeal with all these crazy expensive ingredients only to end up with a subpar finished product. I was really missing eating cornbread, I especially love sweet cornbread. I searched for a vegan recipes, tried a couple and they weren't great, at all. So I found this one and tweaked it and it is seriously the best cornbread I've ever had. First of all, instead of using regular butter, I of course use a vegan butter. And instead of the eggs, I use a vegan egg replacer. I prefer the follow your heart brand veg-egg vegan egg replacer. It works excellent. And instead of whole milk, I use almond milk. I like using vanilla almond milk for an even sweeter touch. And when I'm feeling really fancy I use my expensive manuka honey instead of regular honey and ooooommmgggg it's so good. My very picky toddlers beg me to make this cornbread, and my husband does too and he isn't vegetarian, vegan or plant based, and he said this is the best cornbread he's ever had in his life. I love to pair it with a good bean soup, but I make it and eat it alone just as a snack all the time. It's so good. I can't rave about it enough lol. A must try, and super easy to tweak in order to accommodate food restrictions.

No changes whatsoever! Took it to a July 4th party to serve with pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket and there were three men at the party, all cornbread lovers, and all three raved about it and were happy to take home big leftovers as it was not a big group and I made the full recipe. Very easy and already thinking about jazzing up a bit with some easy add-ins like jalapenos, cheese. This is a keeper!

I made this to serve at a Saturday brunch and it was a hit with everyone who attended. It had just the right amount of sweetness and was incredibly moist (even though I didn't hear the timer and slightly over-baked it). I stored the leftovers in a plastic container and they were still moist several days later. Will definitely make this again! NOTE: I didn't have any oil so I used all butter . I also didn't have whole milk, so I used fat-free half & half. Since the end product was so good, I will stick with those choices in the future.

It is delicious. I made it in a skillet, using the recipe as stated, but placing the skillet in the oven alone with 2 T oil in it at 450 degrees for 3-5 minutes prior to pouring in the batter. It cooks in 18-20 minutes. My skillet is 11" diameter at the base, so if you have smaller, you will want to decrease the ingredients, as my cornbread came out nice and thick. 

Important Note: if I make this again, I'm planning to increase the cornmeal to flour ratio (maybe flip flop the measurements?), as it was a bit more cake-ish than a true cornbread lover would appreciate. Delicious, but not quite the same as cornbread.

I made it as is and also switched out the milk for buttermilk. Buttermilk instead of milk is more moist and sweet.

This one is a winner as per recipe or with changes!!!!!!
Over time I've made slight changes.
I've added 2 cups of cornmeal with 2 cups flour.
I've also used cassava flour in place of all purpose for a healthier option when needed. I definetly have been decreasing the sugar, omitting the butter and substituting baking soda(1/4 tsp per cup) in place of baking powder.

The flavor of this cornbread could have been good if not for the overwhelming taste of BAKING POWDER. so so offputting. Should have trusted my judgement that 2 tablespoons was way too much! It leaves a really weird, gross taste in your mouth. Will not make again.

I made a slightly modified version. I used 2 cups cornmeal/flour, brown sugar, buttermilk instead of milk and added a dash of nutmeg. I baked it in a cast iron skillet. Delish!!!!

Great flavor and texture!  I had to substitute Splenda for the sugar in the recipe, due to diet restrictions in my household, but I did add the honey.  Fantastic made as either the bread or as muffins.

It seemed like every cornbread recipe had to have buttermilk or shortening and we did not have either of those. We did not have any cornmeal so we used cornstarch instead and it turned out amazing. This was so great and everyone in my family LOVED it! Thanks for this amazing cornbread recipe!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!  I just made this EXACTLY as it is written.  Nice and moist (not dry like other cornbread) just a hint of sweetness, but not overly sweet.   Perfect cooking time as written 350 for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect!!!  This will be my only cornbread recipe from now on!  Thanks so much for submitting.  Well done!!!!!

I was born and raised mostly in Texas.  This recipe is my go to for sweet cornbread.  Occasionally I like to add diced jalapeño (I LOVE spicy foods).  Also, I’ve changed the oil to Ghee, which adds a beautiful deep buttery flavor to the cornbread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as a "savory cake" and frosted it with whipped cream-cream cheese frosting (with chopped jalapenos folded in), and topped it with classic queso dip. It was awesome!

I am so confused as to why this recipe gets so many 5 star reviews.   The "cake" isn't bad but it's not very good either.  I like the texture but the flavor is very bland.  I'm going to keep looking for a sweet, moist cornbread recipe.

I love cornbread & thought, why not try. It was so easy to prepare. I followed the instructions pretty much to the T. I didn’t change the recipe. It came out perfect. My lil’munchkin loved it so much that he seriously went for more. Approved by a 5yrs old. ?? The family enjoyed it. Moist & fluffy. I’ll definitely make this more often. Thanks for the share

I am enjoying some of this cornbread as I type this review. It's awesome! So moist, not dry and grainy like cornbread sometimes is. And so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely be making this again!

I don't generally like cornbread but I was asked to make some for a family dinner so I made this recipe. It was delicious and everyone LOVED it--inculding me!! It isn't really like cornbread but more like cake. It's not crumbly like regular corn bread and it doesn't need butter or honey on top.  I used white corn meal. The only thing I did different was soak the corn meal in one cup of milk for about 10 minutes before adding it in.

Really easy and delicious! Just slightly sweet, but wonderful when fresh out of the oven with some butter and maple syrup! I substituted sunflower oil for vegetable oil, but I don't think it made a difference.

I hate to be one of those people who rate something after making it differently , but I have made this recipe as written and with my changes as well so I think I can speak to the recipe as being a really great one. I made minimal changes. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and I left the amount of honey the same , but 1/2 cup sugar was  plenty. I also used 1 3/4 cup cornmeal and 2 1/4 cup flour  because I wanted my cornbread cornier.  It was still extremely fluffy and thick and moist. This change did not make it any dryer. One cup of cornmeal and 1 1/3 cup of sugar  was too sweet and did not have enough corn flavor for me personally. The small changes customized it more to my liking. I love a sweet yellow corn bread and it was still very much this with my changes. This makes a lot of corn bread, you could easily cut this in half and make it in an 8 in  pan or you could even make some muffins with it.  if you like moist, sweet, fluffy yellow corn bread this is definitely the recipe for you!

I have made this over and over.  It is the best corn bread I've ever had.  I love how moist it is.  I never liked cornbread because it was usually corse and dry.  I had one like this in a restaurant and none of the recipes I tried before were even close.  This one is a keeper.  Everyone loves it!

This is not a good recipe. It tastes worse than the boxed cornbread packs. I would recommend skipping it. Worst recipe on Allrecipes so far, especially with so many stars in its rating!

I tried this some time ago and loved it. I think of it as a type of dessert, and in fact it is called "Sweet Cornbread Cake". To me it's kind of ingenuous to criticize it for not being cornbread-like enough. Anyone who has made traditional cornbread should be able to tell from the recipe that it's going to be different. I've been craving pineapple upside down cake lately. I'm going to use this recipe for it!

Really good! It actually tastes as it had regular corn instead of corn meal.

Made this as written.  My husband and I loved it.  My husband is even taking some to work early for breakfast to share with his friends.  Carbs are usually verboten in our house but they taste all the better when you splurge on REAL food.  ***HEADS UP***  I'm adding this the DAY AFTER I posted my original review.  Husband just requested I make this cornbread in LESS THAN A WEEK to go with the country style ribs he requested.  I'm afraid he's gone cornbread-carb-crazy!

I added a whole can of creamed corn to this recipe and it still did not taste like corn.  The texture was great, but  this won't be my go-to recipe.

OUTSTANDING!  If you love sweet cornbread then look no further. I replaced 1 cup of the milk with buttermilk because I didn't have enough regular milk and it turned out fantastic. Also, I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 min. Absolutely the most divine cornbread I have ever eaten.

This was the first time I've tried this recipe and it was moist and sweet.  The only thing was it didn't taste "corny" enough for me. I'll try what someone else posted and substitute 1c of flour with the cornmeal or masa harina corn flour.  Also, I would like to add more honey and vanilla.Thank you for sharing your recipe

We made it while on vacation with family and it was a huge success. Even those in our family who typically do not care for cornbread really enjoyed this version.  It turned out just as described. Very sweet and moist.  It did require the full 45 minutes as some reviews had said that it took them less time but this of course is oven dependent.  It was very easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe!  We will definitely do this again!

The first time I made this I mixed the butter directly into the batter and it came out so buttery and absolutely yummy. I think I ate most of it by myself in 3 days. I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings, so not a total glutton. The second time I made it I followed the instructions exactly and melted the butter before adding it to the batter and it tasted okay.  So as I type this review it is in the oven as I make it for the third time with the butter unmelted and mixed into the batter. So my 5 stars for the "mistake" version.

I love this recipe and i've made it several times. The only thing that I do differently is that ten minutes before it is done baking i brush the top generously with  slightly watered down honey. It is delicious!

I made this cornbread cake this week and it was fantastic!!! I will make it over and over again. Breakfast, lunch or dinner...it's great anytime. I did add about half a can of Trader Joe's corn. I loved it, and so did my BF!

I love this recipe.  I halved the recipe, used buttermilk and melted coconut oil, and baked in a 9 inch square pan for 38 min. and it was perfect.    Will be making often.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as directed, and it turned out exactly as I had hoped! It's not the same type of cornbread that I'm used to, but that's a good thing sometimes. Not at all grainy, very moist and soft, and really, really delicious.  It was perfectly sweet and had the perfect amount of cornbread for a cake-y bread. My husband wasn't crazy about it not because of the taste, but because of the texture. He wanted more cornbread in his cornbread.  But I read this recipe to mean I was making a cornbread cake, not just cornbread. When I want to make the firmer cornbread with more texture, I will turn to a different recipe but this was absolutely perfect for what I wanted.

Awesome recipe! I subbed the flour with 1 to 1 Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Flour, and halved the recipe. I added a bit more oil and a bit more milk to the halved recipe. Everyone keeps asking me to make more!

I like sweeter cornbreads and this one turned out fantastic! I only used 1 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of honey (all I had left on hand) and it was still nicely sweet. Served it with veggie chili and dinner was a hit. The leftovers are hard to resist!

Tried many recipes and this one is the best.  Moist, sweet and so yummy.   Only change was I used a 9x9 dark non stick pan and baked it for exactly 65 min.

I made this cornbread and didn't change a thing. Great consistency and just the right amount of sweet. I usually like honey on my cornbread, but this didn't need it. I've tossed out all my other cornbread recipes. This one's a keeper!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I have been searching for a corn bread recipe like this one for years. I'm so in love with it. The cake is beyond moist and so delicious. This a must in everyone's recipe book.

SUPER YUMMY! Whole family was excited to try it (it's been a while since I've made corn bread!), they smelled it from the kitchen.  It was moist and spongy! Only changed whole milk to evaporated milk (3/4 milk and 1/4 water for every cup) since my kids used last of the milk for cereal. I was worried that it might be too sweet, but it was perfect! I'll be making this again using evaporated milk!

I made this recipe exactly like Sarah Joe suggested, only using butter instead of vegetable oil and butter. I also halved the recipe as it makes a lot. I wasn't sure if I had enough sugar for the entire recipe and it still made two cake pans full! I spread butter on the top then flipped it onto a plate and spread butter on the bottom (I don't know how I stay a size 0 genetics I suppose) and it was the best cornbread I and anyone who tried it has ever had. It's moist like a cake and very sweet. We love sweets in this house so if you don't then don't make this recipe and if you make it don't knock off points for it being too sweet. You have been warned! This is going in the recipe book!!! Thank you!! And by they way, I used 2% milk as that's what we drink and it was amazing still. Use whatever is on hand. Fool proof recipe.

I was making chili and decided to make cornbread at the last minute.  Because I didn't have buttermilk, I used the next most popular recipe - this one.  My husband LOVED it!  It's not your typical Southern cornbread, but cake-like as the name states.  It's sweet with a little bit of grit from the cornmeal but it's moist and so tasty!  I did everything according to the recipe except I used heavy cream instead of milk only because I was trying to get rid of things.  It was delicious and will definitely go into the rotation!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe to a "t." To me it was just good, but everybody else thought it was really good. I wasn't crazy about it, as I tasted more flour than cornmeal. To make it to our liking, I used all butter, and changed the flour to corn meal ratio to 1:1 (2 cups each). This is how I make it from now on, and we love it and give it 5 stars!!

I made mine in a bundt pan. Came out great! A tad too sweet. You can get away with putting less sugar into this. And more salt. Mine wasn't very yellow in color. I would make this again.

A wonderful recipe for those that love sweet cornbread. I served this with a beanless chili and with the leftover cornbread (about 1/3 of the pan) I made a cornbread pudding. Delicious!

Absolutely  delicious! It was super easy to make, and so moist . My boyfriend and I were really impressed with the rich flavor. I would cut the recipe in half next time though and add some buttermilk for a variation...this went nicely with BBQ baby back ribs and corn on the cob.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.!  It will really come in handy during the holidays.

I made this exactly as stated. Moist and delicious. I brought it to work and everyone loved it.

Update: 1/9/17. I've made this several times and was always delish. This time I mixed all the wet ingredients together before adding to the dry. Usually I add each wet separately to the dry. Well, it came out kind of dry this time, and the only reason I can think is because of mixing all the wet together.....

Exactly what we were looking for. Only mods made were more butter, no oil, less sugar, more honey, added corn kernels.  My dinner companions ate it all up and said they wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe, taste great and it is more like a moist cake vs a dryer cornbread.  The only problem is the amount of oil that is added seems a little much.  Everybody loved this recipe and it was awesome.  Going to make this again!

This is one of very few recipes from allrecipes.com which I didn't feel any need to alter. This sweet cornbread cake doesn't last a full 24 hours in my home. I baked it in a 9-inch springform pan for almost an hour and it came out looking like a magazine photo. It's just as delicious served with a savory meal, like my taco chili, as it is with a little bit of strawberry jam. I do not understand the few folks who said that this recipe comes out too sweet.

LOVEEEEE this recipe, this cornbread turned out exceptionally moist! Which is hard to get with other cornbread recipes, not overly sweet, just right! My sister who hates cornbread actually came back for seconds! It is that good!

This has become my absolutely favorite go-to cornbread recipe. I made a few substitutions the first go round out of necessity and loved it so much I make it the same each time.  I use 2 cups each cornmeal and self-rising flour, keep the baking powder the same  and use coconut oil in place of veg oil. We also use 1% Lactaid milk so wouldn't know if coconut oil is making up any textural difference but man, ooohh man is this the fluffiest, moistest YUMMIEST cornbread our house has ever had! The 3year old's nickname is "cornbread" for her love of it- she is in heaven!! Thank you SO SO SO much for sharing!

Made as written with the exception of baking in a cast iron skillet, extended baking time about 10 mins. Wonderful stuff! Moist, great texture, a little sweet but a pat of salted butter on top was a perfect contrast. Keeper!

I made this for the first time and followed the instructions  exactly as instructed and it was a winner. Everyone enjoyed it, even my niece who is not a fan of cornbread (she complained that the one she ate at a church function was too dry and the texture was crumbly). She said she won't be able to eat anyone else's cornbread now. It had a nice moist "cakey" consistency. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was delicious!!!  I threw away all of my other recipes as this is going to be my go to from now on.  It's extremely moist and sweet enough that I didn't need to add butter or honey to it.  In all reality, you could probably cut the sugar a bit and it would still be great.  I brought it to work and everyone loved it!

Love this recipe.  I give it 4 stars as is, and 5 stars with 2 little changes. It  DEFINITELY, as the title states, is a sweet corn cake- not your regular old fashioned cornbread.  Reviewers expecting savory dry cornbread instead of sticky moist corn cake will be disappointed and should learn to read the titles of recipes before trying...
That aside- in my opinion it is a little too sweet as written. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup when I prepare it, sometimes even less. Also I add about 1 to 1 1/2 cup frozen corn kernals, because I like the extra moisture, texture and fresh corn taste. 
Made this way, my whole family adores it! Definitely a keeper in this house.

Was good but not great.  I like the sweetness but thought a bit dry, I like my cornbread a bit moister.  Only baked 40 minutes and probably should have taken out at 35.

I have made this several times now, exactly as listed. It is my family's favorite, exceptionally good with just enough corn taste. When I brought it to a church pot luck the co-founder of a local restaurant chain asked me for the recipe, saying it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten.

AMAZING. Everyone raved about it. I poured the batter in the pan then sprinkled some chopped fresh jalapeños on one half of it for those who like a kick. Next time I will reduce the cooking time by 5 min. Already can't wait to make it again!!

I didn't think this was too sweet at all, but we like a sweet cornbread. My husband thought this was the best I have  ever made. I think I will exchange some flour for masa harina for a little more corn taste next time.  It went great with the homemade  chili. The edges were nice and crispy, and the inside fluffy. I will be making this again for sure.

I  made it just as written. There was enough to make a 9 inch cake round  and 12 muffins in my cast iron muffin maker . It baked  up with a little crust  on the outside but perfectly moist on the inside .EVERYONE  went on and on about how perfect it was. ( and  for god sake's it's just cornbread! ) Not crumbly, not dry… Very moist. Definitely cake like but still cornbread like. Not too sweet. Yet not unsweet . Take it from a baker who has made TONS of   Recipes over the years . Definite crowd pleaser

I decided to try this recipe because of all the great reviews and it didn't disappoint! I made it mainly for my father in law who is a man of few words. After dinner he made a point to tell me the Cornbread was "Very, VERY Good!" It was just one of many compliments that night! It is Super Yummy!!

Wanted more cake like texture so I used cake flour instead of all purpose and all butter no oil.  Very good.  Daughter had sleepover and all 6 girls had seconds.

Really delicious, and I especially love the moist yet fluffy texture. I have made this a few times and can't seem to have all the ingredients I need on hand, but it is great every time regardless. Once I made it without honey. Once I ran out of AP flour and had to use cake flour. I usually cut the sugar by about half, and it is still noticeably sweet without screaming "cake!" Once I took a reviewer's suggestion and substituted masa de maiz for one cup of flour, and that was my least favorite iteration, was too crumbly. As written it is delicious.

This was great! By far the best cornbread I've made from this website so far! Served it with turkey chili. I added a can of creamed corn to the mix at the end and used 2% milk as that's what I had on hand. Also used 1C white sugar and 1/3C brown sugar. Kids had fun helping make this. It needed about an hour to be done. Great served warm with butter!

Bullet proof!   I added ~4oz of frozen sweet corn and 5-6 de-seeded, minced,  jalepeno crowns (not fresh / jarred) for texture and a little zip.   
… really,  Really,  REALLY GOOD!

I prefer a honey so replaced the sugar with 1 cup of honey, added 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and took off 1/4 cup of milk. I also substituted 1 cup of sour cream in place of 1 cup of milk. Lowered the cooking temperature to 425 degrees (so honey wouldn't brown) and a moist delicious honey infused cornbread was created!

I have always preferred a sweet cornbread to a regular cornbread.  This recipe definitely qualifies!  It is super easy to make and everyone thinks your something extra special because you served home-made cornbread from scratch!

Feels heavy because it's so moist but it's light, airy and rich! I added a can of niblets corn, drained. Because I had a bit of extra batter than my pan would hold I lined a muffin tin pan with paper liners and tried the batter as muffins too, knowing they would need only 12 - 18 minutes to cook instead of 45 minutes. Both the corn bread cooked in the 9 x 13 pan and the corn bread muffins were delicious! My husband likes the idea of corn bread muffins in his lunchbox for snacking. Guess I'll make a bigger batch of muffins and maybe a small loaf with the rest of the batter!

Love this recipe! I hate most corn breads because they are so salty and dry. This is super moist and sweet but not too sweet. My kids gobble it up!

Delicious and sweet. Love the honey. I use more honey and less sugar and split less than a cup of sugar - half white and half brown. Still sweet and moist.

It was very moist, but very cakey and a little bland compared to my usual recipe.  It was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

This is a good recipe.  I was very pleased with the results however it leans towards being more of a cake than cornbread.  I will make it again but I won't use it  to accompany the main dish that I made.  I needed more of a cornbread flavor and texture.  Very nice recipe though.

I followed the instructions exactly as they are. I took this cornbread to accompany my chili at a chili cook off and won two out of for First Place prizes beating out individuals and restaurants both. People were housing this as quickly as I would hand it too them. They came back for 3rds and 4ths just to get more cornbread. One man told me it was exactly like a local restaurant's cornbread and a lady asked for me to leave her the recipe. Can't go wrong with a sweet cornbread and a spicy chili. I nailed it!

Best sweet corn bread ever!!!  I’ve made this cornbread over and over for myself and family gatherings and it's always a BIG hit.  I personally LOVE it.  After years of searching for a Cake like cornbread, I found this recipe and never looked further.

Only thing I did different was bake in Demarle at Home Silicone Muffin bakeware and only baked for I think about 20 minutes - it made about 36 muffins that were perfect.  Moist and delish!  I had forgotten to buy cornmeal and ended up grounding my own using popcorn kernels in my Vitamix.  Husband raved.  These are in the "DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN" file.

I LOVED this cornbread recipe!!! My favorite for sure, but I have to say I don't generally enjoy typical cornbread. I did increase the cornmeal a half cup and cut the flour a half cup, and actually used some vegan butter (long story, not vegan, just trying to use it up!), and used a cup of sugar. This was moist and sweet, just how I like it!

Yes, I changed, only because I am broke and only had ap flour and masa corn flour.  But it was still deeelish.  I am Southern and usually only like corn bread with just corn meal and no sugar...... But this is great.  Think of breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert all in one dish.

The best cornbread ever! Light, fluffy, sweet, and delicious.  I make a half batch and it's perfect size for us.  I have even substituted some of the oil (1/2) with applesauce and it works fine. But I keep the butter for flavor.  Watch the time with a half batch as it does not take as long to bake. Serve with extra honey. Make this today.....your family will thank you later!

I love, love this recipe!!! I found this recipe 2 yrs ago here and it is the only corn bread allowed in my home. The kids love it so much that they take it to school the next day as part of their lunch. The corn bread is very moist with just the right amount of sweetness. The cornbread is a pretty golden color with a nice glaze on top, it is certainly picture perfect for a food magazine.

I just made this amazing Corn Bread!
I changed 3 ingredients.
1. Coconut oil - Instead of regular oil 
2. Carnation Evaporated milk - instead of whole milk
3. Maple syrup - instead of honey
Will make again!!

Didn't have honey on hand, but it tasted great with 2 tablespoons of maple syrup instead. 

Love this recipe.  I've made it as directed for the last several years. Much better than box cornbread.

I substituted buttermilk for the milk since I had some in my fridge. I used white self-rising cornmeal and  just followed the recipe after my substitutions. My husband usually loves my cornbread, but he raved about this recipe. He loved it so much that he invited his family over to try some, and he also requested that I only make this recipe from now on.

I made this for my daughter,  she hates cornbread.  It did not disappoint!  She was picking at the cornbread before I could get it out of the pan after I had her try a bite.  The only thing I changed about the recipe was substituting coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  It ended up having a subtle coconut flavor but it turned out delicious.

Quick and easy to throw together - used buttermilk and added baking soda as per the original poster's review - and added a bit more cornmeal when the batter looked a little runny.  Only had a toaster oven to work with so I baked it in little 5.75x3 loaves and they were done in 30 min

Love this recipe.
To make this gluten free, instead of regular flour I used 1.5 cups of gluten free flour, 1 cup of coconut flour, 1 cup ground flaxseed, added 2 extra eggs due to the coconut flour and 1 extra cup of cornmeal (cause I really like the cornmeal taste lol)

I made no changes other than using all organic ingredients. It was sweet, moist and delicious! I served it with chili and salad on a camping trip and everyone loved it! I loved it toasted with a little butter. YUM!  I have made several different recipes for corn muffins and cornbread from this website and like this one the best. The others are too dry, crumbly and tasteless.

Proof this recipe is so good it's impossible to wreck: 
Even though only whole wheat and flax flour was used in mine, plus the cup of cornmeal of course, the flavour was fabulous and the all-critical texture was super satisfying. It's a keeper. Breakfast, snacks, birthday with crm cheese icing. 

*Apply the usual alterations - sub with a-sauce, reduce the sugar, a nix on butter. 
Used 1 c homemade buttermilk plus a can of evaporated (it was due).

I made half the recipe. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil/butter (We LOVE coconut oil for everything), also didn't have milk so I used Coconut milk (might as well use shredded coconut instead of cornmeal while I am add it..jk). 

But in all seriousness, I followed the rest of the recipe and this turned out SO GOOD! Too bad no one is home tonight to share.. I will have to eat it all to myself ;)

I made this exactly as written. It was delicious! Delicate and moist, with a tender cake-like texture. I prefer my cornbread sweet – and this was just right.

Way too sweet for a cornbread, and way to plain for a "cake". I guess I lean more towards the cake view. My cornbread loving hubby did not like it. My sugar loving kids did not like it.

I thought this recipe was very good, however I did change one thing and that was substituting part of the oil for two-thirds cup of applesauce.   Really great.   Carol12

Absolutely awesome!!  My family loved my cornbread recipe that I had before I tried this recipe. When I told them I was trying this recipe they all begged me not to!  They said that my previous recipe was the best cornbread they had ever had!  Well I made this recipe anyways because I thought it had a chance of being pretty good after reading the reviews and looking at the ingredients.  The only thing I changed was buttermilk in place of whole milk.  Well everyone ate this and were amazed!!  My husband said that this cornbread was on a whole new level of great from what I had made before!  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!   I have since deleted all other cornbread recipe that I had in my recipe box.

This is amazing! I was worried as the batter was so thin but remembered that this is more of a cake than a bread. It turned out great no changes required.

We liked this recipe, but I made some changes. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I used vegan eggs and soymilk. I also used 1/2 cup applesauce so I could cut the sugar and oil in half. The whole family enjoyed. Next time I would halve the recipe. It makes a ton.

I use all butter instead of vegetable oil, otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. This is a delicious, moist, and sweet cornbread. It gets rave reviews every time I serve it, which is often!

I cut the recipe in half, still cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish, and it turned out amazing! next time I may add more butter just to make it even more buttery delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend. ..with some chili beans and he loved it... he said if I keep cooking like this he will marry me... lol ..guess that means he liked it. I cut everything in the recipe in half and used buttermilk instead of milk (like another person suggested). It was so moist and not overly sweet, which was what I thought because of the amount of sugar the recipe asked for. Adding it to the menu for life

Everyone in my family loved this recipe. I was looking for a cornbread that would not be so gritty and this one was perfect. I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in a 8 x 8 pan for 40 mins. PERFECT! Nice and cake-like. Will make again!

Moist & sweet, like cake.  The family loved it.  It even turned out well using coconut milk (milk substitute, not coconut flavor) & butter substitute for a dairy free version.

I read the reviews and used 1 cup of cornmeal and 1 cup of flour for half the recipe.  I made it in an 8x8 pan - I was worried about it overflowing but it rose very nicely to just the top of the pan.  I also used 2% milk because I didn't have whole milk.  It was very tasty - definitely beats the Jiffy box that I usually use, with not too much extra work.

I didn't have honey so I used syrup. I think I would half the recipe next time. I takes a lot longer than 40 minutes to bake. It was cake like and sweet. Mmm

I made half the recipe, and did half cornmeal/half flour to increase the corn flavor. I also added some vanilla and let it cook for 38-40 minutes. It was absolutely delicious. I couldn't stop eating it! Definitely a diet breaker

Excellent recipe that lives up to all the claims it makes.  It is nice and moist, unlike some cornbreads that crumble on your plate and in your mouth and make you feel like smacking your lips as though you were traveling through a barren desert with a couple of camels and a guide who speaks some Middle Eastern language you can't comprehend.

I've been looking for a sweet cornbread recipe that rivals a local restaurant I love.  This is as good or better!  Made it exactly as the recipe states.  Took it to a chili/soup potluck and it was devoured!  So many rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe!  This will be my new go-to recipe.  Thank you for posting!

Yowza damndoozle!  This is good cornbread cake!  Delicious.  I halved the recipe  as I was only cooking for two.  And it turns out, I only had 1 egg so I added a little more butter and oil. 

 I used a small 6" (?) iron skillet for baking using a little oil to coat and after pouring in the batter I heated up the skillet a tad on the burner before putting in the oven for 35 minutes.... I can't wait to have some with butter and honey and strong  coffee with heavy cream in the morning. Yum!  You gotta try this if you like a sweeter cornbread.

I didn't have honey, so used corn syrup, which worked. Can't wait to try it with all the ingredients as written. This was the best cornbread recipe I have ever tried.

I love this recipe! Use it every time! Today though I didn't realize I was out of eggs and I quickly added 3 TB of mayonnaise (for half the recipe) We still loved it! It was a bit crumbly but good and soft and fluffy. Thank you so much!

I am not a fan of  dry crumbly cornbread, But I like to have the taste of cornbread, and some recipes don't have enough cornmeal to give it enough "cornbread" flavor. This recipe is by far the best! it's moist and perfectly sweet (not too sweet) It is my families favorite!

I teach religious education on Saturday mornings and try to bake for the kids dishes that fit the calendar/holiday.  I learned that on Saint Nicholas Eve (Dec. 5th) they make honey cake in Europe for St. Nick (who brings presents the following mornings).   I went looking for an American honey bakery recipe.  I made this recipe and added a honey glaze.  I received rave reviews.  Glaze recipe below .

Honey Glaze
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/2 tsp. vanilla
¼ cup water
1 tablespoon butter

While the cake is finishing in the oven, in a saucepan mix the ingredients.  Let the mixture cook for just a few minutes (until the butter melts).  Pour on the cake after it is removed from the oven. Let the cake/glaze cool.

This is heavenly. So happy I found this recipe. I made a batch the day before and it was not good. I was going to wait awhile before making another pan but for some reason, I think out of boredom, I decided to make this recipe. Turned out awesome. I'll stick with this for a long time. My 5 year old son will love me even more now ??

It's a wonderful recipe. So much room to change things up a bit and still come out a tasty treat. I had to switch out a few things due to what was on hand but it still came out good. I used 2 cups cornmeal and 2 cups flour, 2.5 cups water and 6 TBL of buttermilk powder, and 3 eggs instead of 4. The one thing I will change on purpose is using less sugar. It was a bit too sweet for me, but hey - the recipe does say "sweet cornbread". Hope you have a sweet tooth if you like it in it's originality. :)

This recipe is great because the base ingredient list is so solid that if you want to play with certain aspects, it's pretty easy to guess what the result will be. I changed out a cup of the flour for more cornmeal with fine results. Based on rave reviews, I'd say it's a winner.

I love cornbread but the bf does not, I thought I would try this recipe since he said he prefers sweet bread.  Definitely has more of a cake texture than cornbread texture which I think he liked, said we should it was good and make it again. I guess that means it's a keeper!

This is my cornbread recipe for now on. I used one cup sugar with the honey. I also used coconut oil and did 2 cups of cornmeal and 2 cups  of flour. It was awesome and my family loves it.  It did not take 45 minutes for mine to bake because of my big pan. Thx.

Update:  I made this three more times for my hubby. He eats it with milk.  My children have the cornbread for breakfast.

Rises good and very nice taste, does not come out as yellow as that though.  All in all is very good.  Will make again.

Its good, but not great...needs a little something for the flavor, its a little bland. Definitely not as good as Trader Joes cornbread....maybe some creamed corn could be added or substituted for some oil or milk for a more corn flavor.

Wonderful recipe!  Cornbread is dense, rich, and moist - a real winner!  I have made this about six times in the past two months and am never disappointed!  HINT: Even though the baking time (45 min.) may have passed, and the bread may have cracked, BE SURE TO TEST FOR DONENESS! A wet toothpick means 5-10 more minutes, at which time all of the sugars will turn to a deep golden brown and your finished product will be perfect. I use safflower oil (available Whole Foods) for this recipe. Thanks for the corn bread I have wanted to find for 30 years! :)

I didn't have much luck with this particular recipe and I followed it fairly religiously. However, I did use a 9x9 glass pan instead of the larger 9x13, the latter of which was called-for in the recipe. Consequently, the mixture was a bit deeper than usual going into the oven, and I think that was the problem. I cooked it for over 60-minutes at 375, but the inside was still like pudding - way, way too soft. I'm gonna try it again tomorrow with the proper pan size and I think that'll solve the problem.

We love this cornbread my husband loves the left 
Overs for breakfast. I wanted to make corn muffins so I decided to use this recipe I omitted the sugar used 2 1/2 cups of flour and 1 1/2  cups of cornmeal  they came out great. I got 12 large muffins out of the batter. They took about 20-25 minutes to bake . I shared with some friends everyone loved them. I served them with honey butter 1 stick of butter to 1/3 cup of honey . Very yummy. (FYI ) later this week I will make again but put the sugar in since my family loves the original  recipe. :-)

Delicious, with a wonderful cake-like consistency. Substituted extra light-tasting olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Will probably cut back a tiny bit on sugar next time. Otherwise great, and had people that usually don't like cornbread eating seconds.

Shut yo' mouth! This cornbread recipe is a definite keeper.  I've eaten it hot and cold and it's delicious.  I like it nice and brown so that it cooks through.  Very moist and flavorful.  After reading the comments, I cut the recipe in half and used only 1/2 cup of sugar so that it wouldn't be too sweet.  Delicious.

i'm not a huge fan of corn bread but this recipe was very very good the only complaint my family had was that it was a little too sweet, so next time i will probably try to half the amount of sugar and add a little more honey to hopefully balance it out a bit more. :)

It was amazing. I followed the recipe for the most part only changes I made - I used buttermilk instead of regular and no oil- I used 1 cup butter. Everything else stayed the same. It came out wonderful. My MIL was in the in the kitchen while I brushed it with honey butter 1/2 way thru cooking and she was anxious to try it. I served it with White chicken chili and it was a good compliment. Thanks myfoursonsks, it was good. Honestly with a name like that, I knew it had to be good. This one's a keeper. We froze our leftovers,since it made so much.

Made exactly as recipe stated.  This is incredibly delicious, moist and super easy to make.  You cannot mess this recipe up.  My 6 year old made this with my supervision.  This is a great recipe to introduce the love of baking with your little one.  The full recipe makes a large amount  so it is perfect for brunch or when you'll have a few people over....otherwise do what we do.  Enjoy it all week long.   Thank you so much for this terrific corn bread cake recipe.  Even those that do not like traditional corn bread absolutely devour this one!!

This recipe is excellent.  Glad to have found it.  Tried two others - too dry.  This is the best cornbread recipe.  It says it is rich, sweet, and cake-like, and it truly is.  I was asked to make a large batch of cornbread for our church feeding program, and here it is. I did use the suggested substitute for whole milk with buttermilk.  Five stars and more.  Thanks!

Very good cornbread.  I halved the recipe and I only had 1% milk on hand, so that is what I used. I served this with 'Mulligatawny Soup I' from AR and it was a nice compliment to the soup.

Light, scrumptious, best cornbread I've ever eaten.  I substituted coconut milk for the whole milk due to an allergy, and taste and texture were both perfect.

This recipe is great and soooooo easy to make. I make it often. The second time I baked this I added 1/2 cup sugar only because my husband likes it sweeter. A must try.

Moist, sweet and delicious.  Substituted unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the oil and cut down the butter a bit.  Cut the sugar in half.  Came out great.  Next time I will substitute an equivalent portion of nonfat Greek yogurt for 1/2 the butter.  

The crumb is more like a cake than a cornbread, but I liked it just fine.  Will definitely add to my recipe favorites.

I find that most cornbread is too dry and frankly, not sweet enough.  I also like actual corn in my cornbread.  I modified this recipe by reducing the milk to 2 cups and adding 1/2 cup of creamed corn.  I did need to cook it somewhat longer, but the result was exactly what I was after.  A sweeter cornbread with moister consistency.

We all love this cornbread and I will never make from a box again! I tried to cut the recipe in half though because it makes a ton of cornbread. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It does not make the cornbread taste like coconut. And I use less sugar, but more honey.

Living in Germany, I tasted cornbread 26 years ago and told my family about it since then. Now I found this great recipe and it was just sooo delicious. I used butter instead of oil and buttermilk instead of whole milk. Thank you so much for sharing this!

Absolutely love this recipe! I followed it to a T and it came out perfect. I love sweet things so I made a quick vanilla glaze to drizzle over the top, too, just to see how it turned out. That might be a bit much for some people, but me and hubby really liked it. Even converted a gal at work to liking cornbread once she tried this.

I have been long looking for a good sweet cornbread recipe, and this one is excellent. The sweetness truly does make it more like a cake than traditional corn bread.  I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

This is best cornbread I have ever eaten. I followed the directions closely. I didn't have any vegetable oil but used an extra virgin olive oil. I thought I was taking a chance with that but it worked out very well.  I also buttered my baking dish. The crust turned out a very appetizing, slightly crispy golden brown.  I will never buy a corn meal mix again. This recipe could not be easier and the results are terrific. And, it makes a big batch. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Oh yeah! This is the one for me. Just made some of these for the first time. I made mine in a cup-cake maker and so handy. This is fun and easy to make - so much quicker in the cup-cake maker. I halved the mixture and got 18 muffins. This is definitely a hit for this family. Thank you ever so much for sharing.

I can't imagine anyone giving this cornbread less than 5 stars!  :)  Every time I make it, people want the recipe.  I told my son that soon all our friends will have the recipe!  It is an amazing comfort food, especially with chili.

What a great recipe!  Like normal I started out with the original and branched out. I love the cakey-ness of it, which is what I look for instead of the regular dry variety.

A few things I did differently, one is I added a can of whole kernal corn for that extra homestyle taste. I also added bacon to the recipe, yes, you read correctly. BACON! This was my nephew's idea and it was a hit.  Lastly, I made some one night and realized I had no milk, but I had heavy cream and WOW!  This is not something I would do all the time, but if you like to sin once in a while the heavy cream makes it truly decandent and sinful! ;)  When adding the heavy cream I let it bake an extra ten minutes as the cream seems to make it a little denser and extra rich. If I just want a small change the corn it just the ticket.

Luckily I workout and don't do this all the time.  Kudos for the recipe!!  Definitely something you can play with.

This tasted ok, but I can't give it more than a 3...although it tasted good, it was somewhat dry.  It definitely needed something more to moisten it the day after

My husband absolutely loved this cornbread, and he is a big fan of cornbread.  I just made this cornbread this morning, and it turned out to be a delicious part of our Sunday brunch.  It was sooooo yummy warm right out of the oven.  I did modify the recipe a tiny bit.  I used all butter and no oil.  I didn't have whole milk so I used my nonfat milk.  I was a bit worried about using skim milk instead of whole milk, but I am definitely sticking with nonfat milk since it tasted so good.  I have other cornbread recipes that I make.  This recipe is so good that I am adding it to the top of my page of favorite cornbread recipes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Awesome. I followed other previous suggestions by substituting 1 cup of buttermilk for 1 cup of milk and increasing cornmeal to 1 1/2 cups while decreasing flour from 3 cups to 2 1/2 cups. It came out perfect.

I love this recipe so much that it has become the staple cornbread recipe I use. The pan is gone as soon as it hits the table!! I have followed some of the other reviews and have changed to 2/3 butter and 1/3 oil other than that PERFECTO!!!

I made this cornbread for a chili cook bonfire party last night, it was delish! I had never made anything other than Jiffy mix and was nervous of how it would turn out. I liked it better than the heavy corn meal style (just my preference).  Another successful recipe from Allrecipes! Thanks!

Wow. Wow . Wow.  I love this cornbread.  I halved the recipe and only used 1/2 cup of sugar and skipped the honey.  I baked in a 8X8 square pan for 35 minutes.  It came out moist, tender, soft and perfectly sweetened.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe.

I initially tried this recipe and it turned out awful with a weird after taste. However, I found out what the problem was - old cornmeal mix! Tried this again with new cornmeal mix and it was wonderful! Definitely more cake-lik than your typical cornbread, but still incredible.

I halved this recipe as its just me and hubby now. I have searched and searched for the perfect cornbread muffin and this is it!!! Cake is right! Sooo lovely you're going to want to take the whole pan and a bowl of honey butter and just make it all disappear! I used half cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup reg. sugar. I think I'll go one step further and do 1/4 cup Splenda. I was worried that I had somehow mistranslated the numbers when halving because it was very runny and loose and nothing like what cornbread usually looks like but it baked up perfectly in my toaster oven and now I'm just waiting for hubby to get home so that I don't eat it all! Oh I also used 1 c. cornmeal and 1 c. flour. LOVE LOVE LOVE

Love this recipe! It turned out great. I didn't have any honey so I add some fresh raspberries. I think next time I will replace some of the oil with applesauce, but I will for sure make this again.

This is the cornbread of my childhood! I was so happy to find a moist, sweet-but-not-too-sweet recipe.  I would like to know how to use less sugar or what I could use instead of the 1 1/3 cup of sugar.  Nevertheless, this hit the spot! My husband, who does not eat American food, was also well pleased!!!

I made this recipe last night. It has a soft, light texture and a sweet taste. I wish I could give it 4 and 1/2 stars. My only complaint is that I noticed that bitter baking powder taste. It wasn't too strong, but noticeable. Any suggestions to get rid of that taste? I guess I could try again w/ less BP.

I have tried at least 4 different cornbread recipes looking for one that is sweet and nice and moist. Each time I found myself disappointed by either the flavor, the texture, or both. I am thrilled to say that I have finally found what I was looking for!  This bread has the perfect texture and just the right amount of sweetness. I made the recipe as written except for using a special low glycemic sugar and 2% milk. The only downside is that this bread/cake is addictive!  I find myself going back for seconds (and thirds).

This is one of the best corn bread recipes I ever tried. Its great if you add a little chili peppers. So much you can do with it by adding extra little touches or great plan as is! YUMMY!

This cornbread was fabulous! I used masa flour in place of the regular flour and the cornbread was light and sweet with a touch of cornmeal texture but not dry at all like others we have tried! This will be our new go-to cornbread recipe from now on. Our first 9x13 batch was gone in 4 hours so I will be making another batch today! My 4 and 7 year old grandsons loved it! Thank you for this recipe!

It was very easy to make. I just supstituted the honey for white sugar. I plan on making this a lot more often. I give this 4 stars. It was very good.

I would like to say thank you so much for this recipe. My family fell in love with this. I have been looking for this recipe for years. I will never cook box corn bread again. It came out perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness, and corn meal taste! My daughter can not stop asking for it.

Absolutely delicious!  Love the cake-texture.  Something different from the usual cornbread that's more grainy.  Will definitely make this one again and again.

I've never cared for cornbread before, but decided I wanted to take it to a church supper along  with chili.  So, I did a search, found this and decided to try it.  Everyone who tried it, loved it.  Even I loved it!  Thanks "myfoursonsks" for sharing this with us.

I've been looking for a sweet cornbread like one at a local store and have tried a few recipes.  This one is the best I've found so far (and is very good).  Not sure if made any difference, but I used non-fat milk.  I'm sure there were still plenty of calories and fat from other parts though.

THE BEST cornbread I've ever tasted hands down!!  I like my cornbread to be sweet and very moist and this is definitely moist!  Oh, man!  I should not have just eaten 4 pieces!!! Ate it with chili.  I followed the recipe to a T except I got it outta the oven after about 33 min or so.  But my oven runs very hot.  If you like cornbread flat and gritty and slightly on the dry side you probably won't like it.  Like someone else said, you could definitely ice it with vanilla icing and eat it like a cake!  YUMMMM!

Great recipe. I made the cornbread with all ingredients except whole milk. I added buttermilk instead. I did not bake for 45mins because i was serving for 2 people. Cornbread was sweet and moist. the crust was crisp as i like it. Boyfriend enjoy the cornbread. I made it with turkey macaroni. Next time i will try to bake for 45mins to see if there is a difference, hopefully its still moist when done. This is most def a keeper and will be made all the time when i consider making cornbread. thank you

Very nice cake but I modified mine to include less sugar (it tastes less sweet so it's great for just snacking) and cardamon and put a cinnamon glaze on top: use 1/2c sugar and add 2 TB agave nectar 1/2 t cardamon  Glaze: 3/4c confectioners sugar, about 2 TB whole milk, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 t vanilla -- stir, adding more milk if you want it runnier.  drizzle over the top when the cake is cool.

I actually want to give this 4.5 stars. It's really good, moist and still tastes like cornbread, just not all dry and crumbly.  I ended up using self-rising flour with just a little extra baking powder to be sure it was active, omitted the salt because that's already in the flour and then I added a can of drained Niblets corn to the batter. Baked up beautifully and was a big hit.   It's kind of like a much moister version of cornbread that's already been buttered and had a light drizzle of honey. I will make this again.

This is a definite keeper. My husband raved about this for three days after I made it!! I did make some changes to "healthy" it up a bit: I subbed 1 c whole wheat flour, cut the sugar to 1 c, skipped the honey, and used 1/2 c instant nonfat powdered milk + 2 1/2 c water. I also added a can of Mexicorn (drained) for texture. Next time I make it, I'll also sub unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I was just out of applesauce the day I made it. :(

I normally don't enjoy cake like cornbread. This is sooooo good. The only complaint I have is that it is a resource hog! A box of jiffy is cheaper than the ingredients needed to make this. I'll cut the recipe in half next time.

My variation on these was to make them as corn muffins, and baking them at 425 degrees for 15 mins.  They turned out the fattest, lightest, yummiest corn muffins I have ever tasted!  Definitely a keeper!

After trying a few other cornbread recipes, this is the one I am sticking with.  I made no adjustments. It was sweet, moist and absolutely delicious.  A real keeper.

Tweeked it a bit and this was a HIT! I changed the following..used 2c. med. grind Bob Red Mill Corn Meal, 2c. flour, 1c. melted butter, cut milk to 2c and added 1 can Cream Style Corn. Very moist, truly a cross between corn bread and corn pudding. Might even try to up the milk to 2 1/4c for additional moisture. The med. grind gives it some crunchy corn, adding to uniqueness & texture. Looked a long time, this is FINALLY A KEEPER!

This is great and so moist. I served it with a hamburger soup that I also got from All Recipes.
