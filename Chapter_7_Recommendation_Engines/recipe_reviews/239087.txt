This was great tasting rice dish. The only change  I made was to add the whole red bell pepper, since I like lots of veggies. I did use my homemade vegetable broth. I'm certainly going to make this one again....a keeper.

Outstanding flavor and relatively easy to make; for recipes of this type, I have grown accustomed to a fair to good result.  The taste of this was amazing!  The one note I will add, because it doesn't show well in the picture, is the sazon seasoning turns the rice pink to red in color!  Some people seemed a little disturbed by the appearance but immediately forgot it when they tasted how wonderful the rice was.  I think warning people ahead that they are going to get a "festive" change in rice color will alleviate the surprise and help them fully enjoy this great recipe.  I know I will be making it over and over- particularly on any red-themed holidays!   Love it-

A very tasty dish! I left the Goya spices out and replaced them with standard seasoning. Perfect for dinner and lunch.

Great tasting dish and easy to make. Personally, I would add a can of corn for  sweetness and texture. All in all...DELISH!

Very good recipe, adding to regular rotation. I made with beef broth as that was what was on hand.

This is amazing and I'm so excited that I can make my own Spanish rice and vegetables!! Only change I made was that I used homemade veggie broth and added peas. Simple and easy I will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent!  I forgot to pick up vegetable broth so I used chicken broth instead.  Turned out great!

The rice was very good and tasted great.  I would put less water next time because the rice was clumped together and not very fluffy.  Instead of 3 cups of water, I will use 2 cups of water for 1 1/2 cups of rice.

Really good authentic Mexican taste. I added some chopped chicken and increased liquid to accommodate added chicken so it made for a complete meal.

My toddler and husband loved this. You can  put any vegetables that you want and it will taste good.
