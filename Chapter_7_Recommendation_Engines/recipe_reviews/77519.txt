These were really good and easy to make. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and it turned out fine. Very good especially for people who are following diets such as the South Beach. Thanks!

Very good and extremely easy to make - I like them better than spicy nuts made with more complicated recipes.  My only complaint is that they aren't very spicy - they are much more sweet.  I think I will try adding more nutmeg the next time I make them.

The Spicy Mixed Nuts were easy to make and everyone who tried them over the holidays enjoyed them.

Excellent Recipe - thanks for sharing.  I used raw, unsalted mixed nuts, and hence added a pinch of salt to the spice mixture.  You kick the spices up a notch by adding a dash of cayenne.  Finally, I saved a tbsp. of sugar and dusted on the nuts after they were done, but still warm - very pretty effect.

Very tasty and easy!  Just be sure to let them cool in one layer or else they will get all sticky and clumpy.

These were very good and really easy.  I agree they were more sweet than spicy so I added a dash of cayenne pepper to the mix.  I also used splenda instead of sugar.   I definitely recommend these.

Love this recipe for taste and ease of preparation.  Taking a road trip later this week and will be taking these along for a snack.  These are also great on the Pear and Blue Cheese Salad from this site. Thank you for sharing!

We enjoyed these.  I brought them to a friend's house  and 2 of the ladies there asked me for the recipe.  I've made them twic now.  I didn't have the specific nuts called for, so I used 2 cups unsalted mixed nuts.
