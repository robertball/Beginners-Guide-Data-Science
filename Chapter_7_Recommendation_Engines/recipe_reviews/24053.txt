Delicious!  More like a plum cobbler than a pudding.  Note: dough topping came out a little raw in the middle after cooking only 10 minutes at the end.  Would decrease temperature and increase topping bake time to 18-20 minutes to cook through.  Other than that, this dessert was a real hit and the flavor was excellent.  Will make it again!

My mom and I tried this recipe, but we may have used the wrong kind of plums.  While the dish was very good, we were wondering just whether the supplier of this recipe could tell us if she used the small blue plums, red plums, or the larger black plums.

This turned out beautiful. I wasn't quite sure what baking mix was, I google'd it and got a quick recipe(add certain ratio of baking powder,soda and salt to the flour) sorry, I didn't write it down. I didn't have tapioca, so just omitted it(next time i'll put it in)but it was still excellent. I will post a pic on this pretty dessert!! Also I halved the recipe, I had 6 over-ripe plums in the fridge. I used soft butter instead of the margorine, to cut it into the dry ingredients to give it the "crumbly effect"

Very delicious and I will for sure be making this again! I used fresh plums that my neighbour picked for me (the little ones)Yummy! Since they were smallish I ended up using ~20. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and it was plenty. I didn't have instant tapioca so I used what I had on hand - the pearl slow-cooking tapioca. Not a good idea as it didn't really cook through. I normally love tapioca and its a nice concept but I think next time I will omit that. I made a baking mix I found on this site (2 1/4 cup flour, 1 tbsp. baking powder, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 cup shortening. Mix dry indgredients, cut in shortening til crumbly.) Turned out wonderfully - except for the slightly chewy tapioca which was my fault!

I give this a great score for flavor, but the consistency was quite runny, it actually seemed more like what we would call a cobbler. It coagulated once I put it in the fridge, but then the crust was cold :( Ah well, yummy anyway and everyone liked it :) Maybe it could use a tad more tapioca?

We enjoyed the flavor of this dish, and I was happy to find a recipe to use some of the plums from our tree.  I replaced the water with the liquid that was produced from the thawed, frozen plums.  I cut the amount of sugar in half.  I really wish, though, that the recipe would've specified the size of plums to use or given a weight.  My plums were small, so I ended up with way too much biscuit topping for the amount of plums.  I will know to use more plums next time.

The fruit mixture needs to cook twice as long to become thicker. The baking mix topping also needs to cook twice as long. I also cut the sugar in half. All said and done, good flavor and raves from all.

Because my nephews have allergies I made this recipe gluten and dairy free. I used a gluten free pancake mix for the top and instead of shortening used Earth Balance Soy free butter. The amount of water was too much, however, and I had to add more starch to thicken it. In place of regular milk I used rice milk and I must say you can't tell that anything was substituted for the original ingredients. Overall a fantastic recipe. I'd change the title to plum cobbler though!

I really love that recipe. Will make it for our next Thanksgiving dinner. I folow some members advice and reduce the temperature when cooking the top. I put down at 300 F for 22 min and add 5 minutes at 350 F to get the top brown a little bit. I also add 1/4 tsp of all spices and it was really tasty. Do it!

I had some plums that were getting too ripe. I used them in this recipe to make the plum pudding.  The plums that I used were about 3 inches in diameter. I used red plums.  I followed the directions on the recipe and made some adjustments as were suggested in some of the reviews.  I cut back on the sugar when cooking the plums with the tapioca.  After it was cooked, I tasted the juice and thought it needed a bit more sugar.  In all I probably used 3/4 cup of sugar in the plum mixture.  The plums that I had were quite tart and may have been the reason I felt like it needed more sugar.  
It was suggested to cut the temperature in the oven by Kelinwa when baking the baking mix topping.  I cut my oven temperature to 400 degrees and baked it for the recommended time.  It was perfect, the topping was brown and just perfect.  My husband and I both loved it.  There was plenty of juice in it for me, and plenty of sugar in it for him:)  Great recipe,I will definitely use this recipe again, thanks for sharing.

Not a "plum pudding" in the English sense, which is more of a cake.  In traditional plum pudding, the "plum" is dried raisins. Oh, those crazy Brits!  Gotta love em.  This is a plum cobbler and pretty good at that.

very easy recipe to follow and tasty. A little on the sweet side for us so next time will omit the sugar. Also agree with another review that it needs to cook a little longer for the tapioca to do it's thicking thing. I also added a tsp of Epicure pumpkin pie spice just for a twist. next time will try their lemon chiffon. Different, easy and tasty what more can you ask for.

I've made it twice! Easy and delicious! I used prune plums fresh from my sisters tree. They are smaller but so much sweeter than store bought. I used extra the second time; maybe 25 -30 plums.

This was o.k. as written, but I made some changes that I thought made it much better, although it may have to do with what type of plums you use.  I used red plums right off the tree, and they are very juicy, so I left out the water.  I also doubled the amount of plums and cut the dough in half.  I cooked the plums a little longer, until they were bubbling all the way through. The first time I made it as written, and there was too much dough and not enough of the plum. With the changes I would give it five stars.

It's really nice!  Great use of plums and I have a tree.
