Given the broad and varied array of ingredients I expected something different, unusual.  Would I taste the coffee?  Would it be tomato-y? Would it instead have its own unique flavor?  I probably don’t need to mention that the aroma of this roast filled the kitchen all day, and it was wonderful.  As I was eating this, I completely forgot that I was on the look-out for something unusual, noticing instead that what I was eating was a good old tender pot roast (I used a rump roast which I dredged in flour before browning) with a rich, beefy “jus.”  No one ingredient stood out and in my mind that’s a good thing. So there was nothing particularly different or unusual about this, but I was not disappointed. It was just plain hearty and good.

Interesting twist if you are out of other "staples" for making crockpot roast. I also like the fact you can control the amount of sodium (unlike the recipes that use dry seasoning packets such as onion soup mix,etc).  It's pretty hard to mess up a slow cooker roast, and this recipe resulted in a tasty, tender dinner. I always add onions at the beginning, and add carrots and potatos midway through cook time.

I would like to give the one star reviewer zero stars for mis-using this forum as a grammar/spelling review.  If you haven't tried the recipe, you have no bizznus writing reviews...of anything!  The last time I checked, most grade schools are looking for volunteers, so perhaps that is a better use of your skills and talent :)

I made this for company.  I doubled the amount of coffee, a mistake, but was OK because we like lots of gravy.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I love Montreal Steak seasoning and it's a staple in my house.  I will be making this many times over.

This is really very, very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, only I did slice an onion and minced a clove of garlic and put them in the crock pot under the roast.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Well, I should say I didn't measure the spices or the Worcestershire sauce...I just eyeballed what looked good to me.  Next time I may thicken the gravy, but this time I just ladled a big ol' spoonful over my portion...so moist, so tender and so tasty!  5 stars and a tip of my hat to you, crancherry :)

I will try anything and needed a new pot roast idea. This sounded good. Followed the recipe to the letter. It was just ok. I had made some nice Czech style dumplings to go with the au jus. A waste of the dumplings. The roast looked and smelled great while searing... But my family was unimpressed, as was I. Something was missing in the flavor, and I am at a loss as to what.

I haven't tried this yet, but I will soon...looks delicious!
RE: the one star vote. I read the directions and yes, there is a "typo". Not too many of those on this website. I think most of the cooks that enjoy All Recipes will be able to make this dish without a problem.

Do not let the odd combination of ingredients scare you away from this recipe. I made this for the family tonight, and followed it exactly (although I did add 1/2 an onion and 3 whole cloves of garlic to the slow cooker below the roast).  It was delicious!  Nobody could guess the secret ingredient (coffee), and there was no trace of tomato either. After the slow cooking process you are left with a rich, beefy jus, and tender fall apart roast.   I also boiled some of the jus along with cornstarch to thicken, and served it on the meat an homemade mashed potatoes. I'm even saving the leftover gravy to liven up some chicken tomorrow.   I'll be making this again for sure!

Fantastic! The only thing I did differently was that I used some frozen pulverized tomatoes that I have from my garden (I am trying to use them up and didn't have a can of tomato sauce.) It worked out fine, but I would use the tomato sauce if I had it available next time. The meat was sooooo delicious, I kid you not. I will go to this recipe the next time I am making a pot roast...which will be soon, I'm sure, because everyone loved this one! Note: I did not need to cook it for 8 hours, because it was done way earlier than that.

Quick, easy, delish!  I prefer the Roast Beef and Gravy from this site, but hubs DEVOURED and RAVED about this, so it gets a 5.  We served on toast hot beef style to soak up the nice sauce.  No, you dont taste the coffee and it's not too tomatoey either.  Made this exactly as written, although I usually don't brown meat that I'm putting in a crockpot.  I just think it's a wasted step and adds cleanup.  I recommend this recipe especially if you are a newbie to cooking or using a crockpot.  This will turn out fine without much fuss.

Tasty although I thought au jus style gravy is thin, but this turned out quite thick. Tasty meat still though and so easy!

I did not think this roast would be good with the odd ingredients but, wow, it was! I prepared it as written except my 4 lb roast was cooked through and tender in six hours. I did not sear beforehand or use the bouillon cubes. I made my own Montreal seasoning, as well: garlic, coriander, black pepper, Cayenne pepper flakes, dill seed, and salt. I added some carrots, too, for color.
I didn't give this recipe five stars since the cooking time is not accurate and I felt it needed more salt. However, the flavor profile is very good and no, you cannot taste the coffee at all nor is it overly tomato-y. Nice flavor and will be made again.

My picky 11 yr old declared this was the best meat I've made so far and that I should make it again. I followed the recipe as stated except that I did slice an onion and put it in the bottom of the crock pot. I also then added baby red potatoes and carrots on top and around the meat so a complete meal would be ready when I got home. My husband loved it as well, it was the most tender, moist, fall off the bone roast I've ever done in the crockpot. Delicious! I have lots of left over juice and meat so I will thicken it into a stew for another meal.

Just like other reviewers I was a little apprehensive of how good this would taste after looking at the ingredients, but this was delicious!! I eyeballed the amount of worcestershire sauce, used 2.5 teaspoons of oregano (I really like oregano). Also we didn't have the Montreal seasoning (although I swore we did!) so I sprinkled some cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, and hamburger seasoning that we had. I seared on each side like suggested an I do think it is a needed step. I used basil garlic pasta sauce because thats what we had and when I took out the meat to thicken the gravy with corn starch, I used a stick blender to break up the tomato chunks. Overall great recipe will definitely be using this again!! My boyfriend and his family who I made this for, swore up and down that this had a gravy additive because it was that good!!

Outstanding gravy! Wow was that good! I have to say, though that I started out with homemade beef stock rather than using bouillon which I'm sure had a lot to do with the great flavor of the gravy. I did not add the coffee, nor did I add the steak seasoning. I did not have those on hand. I did add instead a little "Herbamare Spicy" and a little Tamari. I also prefer to sear the roast before adding it to the crock pot, but didn't have the time so I skipped that step. All in all the roast was falling apart tender and the gravy very possibly was the best I'd ever tasted!

Classic 'Old French' (Escoffier) using a bit of Tomato addition to a Beef Sauce.  I would probably substitute Thyme for Oregano but either way very tasty.

Husband & son loved it ... 1 cup coffee, 2 cups beef broth, one small bottle of red wine, 2 ribs celery & tons of garlic with other seasonings, 4  potatoes cut in quarters  Instead of tomato sauce I used a can of tomato paste.   Seared the meat, took out and then simmered onions, mushrooms, celery,  garlic  in wine & beef broth for 10 mihnutes. Lined potatoes in bottom of crock pot & cooked on low for or so 8 hours.  At end could add corn starch to make a really great gravy.

Awesome taste with a wonderful gravy!!!! I dont see how anyone can say this has an overpowering tomato taste. If you did not know the tomato sauce was in there it would be hard to identify the taste. I added one sliced onion and some fresh sliced mushrooms when I put it in the crock pot. My whole family loved this wonderful roast!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This will be my go to recipe for roast from now on. I was so excited to find a Crock-Pot roast recipe that was not too salty.  I used a 4 lb roast and followed the recipe except I added 8 ounces chopped fresh mushrooms to the pot before adding the roast and cooked 10 hours on low.  The leftovers will make a great beef pot pie.

I was too nervous to add the coffee, and omitted it.  Nonetheless, I kept all the other ingredients and seared the roast and all that.  It was very good.  The biggest difference between this recipe and others is that it really does make a very nice au jus that wasn't over powering.  I kept it just as it came and had great au jus sandwiches.  Make sure you start with really nice roast.  I also really liked that this recipe doesn't have a bunch of packaged seasonings like most of the others.  Many of those contain MSG.  I used extra broth because of the omittance of coffee liquid.  I had broth in the cupboard so I used that instead of buillion cubes.

Delicious! I was going to take a photo but forgot...and now it's too late bc it's all gone! Oops :) I too dislike the weird sweetness in some pot roast recipes I've tried so I am thrilled to have found this particular recipe that has no weird sweetness, but instead, has a scrumptious gravy! Thank you to the submitter! (I did add sliced mushrooms in the last hour- it was a fantastic addition bc it tasted great and served as a nice garnish)

I'm not sure why this got so many rave reviews. I will say the roast was EXTREMELY tender and juicy, but completely lacked in flavor. It was just bland to me. I think the coffee took away from the other flavors. The ONLY flavor that remotely came through, was a hint of black coffee. 

Will not be making this again.

Incredible flavor! You may not think the combination of ingredients would work, but the outcome was wonderful. I also added sliced onion.  Shredded the leftovers and served with sauteed peppers, onion and mushrooms on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.  Yummy!

This has been added to the regular rotation. The juice can be kept for a number of different uses later. I don’t know if it’s ok to freeze.

This is hands down the BEST roast recipe. Don't think of it as a regular roast cooked with veggies. It's entirely different  but Oh. So. Good.  Serve with mashed potatoes and a veggie. A wonderful flavor that you won't be able to get enough of.

I've never tried a rump roast before this recipe, I've always done chuck roast.  I made it as written and it was delicious. Not as greasy as chuck roast. We couldn't get enough. Thanks.

I love this recipe!! I did not change any of the ingredients, added two veges tho. The coffee really gave the sauce the added depth it deserved! Delish!! We did the Homer Simpson drool when we tasted the finished dish!This is now a favorite!!

We really enjoyed this roast. I was out of Montreal Steak Spice so I searched and found " Authentic Canadian Steak Spice, eh" on the site. I added a 1/4 cup of dry red wine to further tenderize the roast. Nice blend of flavours and none of the ingredients stands out.  Thanks for sharing.

I am allergic to onions and it is difficult to find a recipe for pot roast without them.  This recipe is so savory that it doesn't need onions.  The taste is  not what I expected, as you can not taste the coffee ( I used espresso) and it does not have a strong tomato taste neither.  I made this in the slow cooker on high in four hours.  This is so easy too.   I like thicker gravy so I mixed flour and cold water and added that mixture to the au jus before serving with mashed potatoes.  The kids loved it too.

I was looking for a pot roast recipe that did not depend on canned condensed soup, and was pleased to find this one. This is now our go-to pot roast recipe. Prepared 100% as described, although it is ready in 6-7 hours. Love that this preparation doesn't have the tinny, metallic taste that can happen with creamed soup. Next time I might add onions, but they're not needed. This approach lets the flavor of the meat shine through.

This turned out wonderful! The ingredients were an unlikely combination, and I used a pathetic little freezer-burned chuck roast, in case I had to throw it away. But the roast turned out great (no sign of freezer-burn) and my family loved the sauce over boiled potatoes. I did not have Montreal-style steak seasoning, but onion flakes and a few other dried herbs did the trick.

I have to admit, I had my doubts with the coffee and tomato sauce.  I was wrong - it was fantastic!!  I followed the recipe and the only change was that I added in a couple of sliced shallots.  The au jus was so good.. and the leftovers the next day were even better!  This will be the go to recipe every time I make pot roast.

Made exactly as written. Did not skip a step. It was very good. Made a 3 lb. roast ready in about 6 hrs.in my not so slow slowcooker. I have had other roasts made in the oven that were better.

The coffee was a genius base for the Au jus. I only used a 2.5lb chuck roast but I had a ribeye that I didn’t want to go to waste so I pan seared it and threw it in there with the roast. Both cuts of meat fell apart they were so amazing. After reviewing the other reviews, I opted to add a third cup of coffee and half bouillon for extra sauce and boy am I glad I did. Once the meat was done, I thickened the gravy up in a pot with corn starch. I froze it to have with mashed potatoes any time. Next time I may throw some carrots and potatoes in there too.

I made it as directed in the recipe. I used a bit of spicy Montreal Seasoning as well for a bit of a kick. It is a great sauce and I was surprised by the slight flavor of the coffee. Since I am not a coffee drinker, I thought it might be overpowering, but it mixed well for a new flavor in the meat and gravy.
Served the roast with smashed red potatoes and cooked carrots with butter and orange marmalade to have color and a bit of sweetness.

I made it just like it was written.  It had good flavor and it was nice and tender.  I used it to make street tacos, the fam enjoyed it . Then had left overs on mashed potatoes, with veggies. Very versatile, definitely will make again and add some onions!

I did make some changes to suit my pantry. No coffee, just used water instead. I used leftover marinara instead of the tomato sauce and oregano.  I cooked it in the instant pot for 2.5 hours on low pressure instead of the slow cooker.  And a teaspoon of Better than Bullion instead of cubes.  That sounds like a lot, but I think it was still loyal to the essence of the recipe.   It was excellent!  I will definitely make this again. 

I reduced the sauce for about 10 minutes then strained it into a sauce pan. Thickened it with just a little corn starch slurry.  The solids I stained looked good so I  served that as a condiment.  It tasted like super thick marinara (go figure), also yummy. 

We had mashed potatoes because some of us just love mashed potatoes. I think it would be fabulous with polenta or gnocchi, too.

I followed this exactly as written (or so I thought). This was a very easy dish to throw together, and all I had to get at the store was the roast. When I tasted it, it was great, but a little strong with tomato flavor. Then I realized that I had used a 15 oz. can instead the 8 oz. can  in the recipe. I love tomatoes, so it’s not a problem. I will definitely make this again, and I’ll probably add some onions and mushrooms to the bottom of the pot!

Will make again & again! Very flavorful. Whole family gave this recipe a thumbs up. I used what I had on hand: 2.5lb roast, seared ea side 6min in ghee, cut into 3pcs, Montana seasoning along w/ as listed ingredients. I prefer my Instant Pot, 65min on Manual. Quick release, remove meat then add a chopped onion, half head chopped green cabbage, 4oz chopped mushrooms & 16oz bag baby carrots. Stir to coat. 4min on Manual. We enjoyed w/ mashed potatoes I made on the stovetop. Thanks for this keeper, Crancherry!

Perfect pot roast!  I don’t add the tomato sauce or oregano  but the coffee is a must!  Followed the recipe and the roast has perfect every time I make it.  I put the liquid from the roast in a sauce pan and add a brown gravy mix using the beef juice instead of the water the gravy calls for!  Amazing.  Mashed potatoes and a salad and we are happy!

I was looking for a Venezuelen shreeded beef, and this was a close as I could find.  I ended making a few changes based on what I had in the house, and what I wanted the end result to be,  but essentially stayed with this recipe and know I can say it is very good.  I didn't realize I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so substituted with soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  After the roast had been in the slow cooker for several hours, I took it out and shredded it, then returned it to soak up juices and added 3 diced tomatoes and a diced onion.  Turned out really well!

yes, we loved it. I would add 1/2 the boullion or low sodium due to the salt in the seasoning. Also flour or cornstarch to thicken the liquid.  Great flavor.

This was probably the most tender roast I've ever made.  Did not taste coffee or tomato sauce.  It actually tastes even better after a few hours or the next day.

This recipe is amazing.  I made no changes, it was perfect!  I call the coffee and tomato sauce the "secret ingredients" because they are so unusual.  Believe me this is great.

I don't care for traditional roasts with mushy carrots and all, so I thought I'd try this. It is wonderful!  I've made it several times- I even made it for Christmas dinner last year.  The only change I make to the original is using the spicy version of the Montreal seasoning. It gives it a really great warm heat. BTW, this makes fantastic French dips.

This turned out great! I made a couple changes for personal preference. I rubbed the chuck with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, minced garlic and thyme then browned in a skillet.

I also added chunks of carrot potato and onion to the crock pot which are a great addition.

Finally, the juices that develop through cooking are amazing for a gravy. It's a simple extra step to make a roux , I did a medium roux, and simply add the juice to desired thickness. If you've never done it simply google making a roux or gravy from a roux and you will be very happy with the results.

Haven't eaten Pot Roast in many years because I never liked it.  But THIS!!! I never tasted Pot Roast like this.  So tender, incredibly flavorful.  I bought enough chuck for 3 dinners (family of 2 adults and one 10 year old) and it was gone in 2!  We will have this as often as as good health will permit.

Easy and delicious.  Yes, I cheated and did not sear the meat first as I was trying to get out of the house to work.  Still came out great and the jus has a great flavor.  I sliced an onion and placed it under the roast.  Keeper recipe.

This was a hit with my family. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a tin of tomato soup. Like others I put onion and garlic on the bottom of slow cooker and the roast on top.

This was my first pot roast. My guests RAVED. I followed the recipe and left it in the crock pot untouched for eight hours. I would probably do another hour or so as there were a few tough spots. Made a gravy from the drippings. Fantastic with roasted veggies.

This was delicious.  The meat was tender, and the sauce did have a tomato base - but tasted great.  It was a nice alternative to the onion soup based recipes we have used in the past.

My husband, myself, and our two year old (who doesn't eat a lot of meat) really enjoyed this. In fact, my husband said this was the best roast I've ever made. Instead of a chuck roast, I used a thin cut chuck steak and only cooked it about 4 hours on low in the crock pot. Omitted the tomato sauce and used garlic pepper seasoning as I didn't have steak seasoning. Delicious!

I followed the recipe to the best of my ability. I didn't measure most of the little stuff. Just eyeballed it really. 
It came out wonderful. I added small red potatoes into the slow cooker about 2 hours before it was done. 
Everyone loved it and I will for sure make it again.

The strong coffee definitely make the difference. I made this following the directions, and using a Hereford bottom roast. It was delicious and kept well refrigerated several days. Well done!

This was super simple to make, only took me like 10 minutes to put together. I did slice up half an onion and a couple cloves of garlic and threw those in under the roast. Oh and I didn't have tomato sauce so I had to use v8. When it was done I took half the sauce and thickened it up for gravy. Flavor was great!

This was a hit in my house. Both my kids (3 & 6yr) asked for more! So glad I found this slow cooker recipe. My husband loved the flavor.
