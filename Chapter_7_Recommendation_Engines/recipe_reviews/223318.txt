Our favorite combination of vegetables for this salad is cubed zucchini, red pepper, cherry tomatoes, red onion and sliced Baby Bella mushrooms. We don't care for Wish-Bone dressing as it's really salty for us, I usually make an italian dressing from scratch. This makes a GREAT all in one meal for summer if you throw in leftover rotisserie chicken or sliced pepperoni. The longer this salad sits, the better it gets--I usually like to make it the night before, toss the ingredients in a big bowl with the dressing and then toss it again right before serving.

I thought this deserved a rating, and it's very similar to my own version of the "suddenly salad" classic pasta salad. Even better, we can use our favorite italian dressings or homemade and tweaked a bit. The best part is that the fresh veggies in it are adaptable and taste so much better than the dehydrated stuff in the boxed pastas.

I used half Wish-bone Italian dressing and half mayonnaise, as suggested in the footnotes. We liked the creamy texture and subtle taste.

To make this pop with flavor and taste homemade, add some olive oil, a fair amount of red wine vinegar and a generous amount of garlic powder and oregano...to taste. The salad dressing is a good base, but just a base... I've made it this way for years and people ask me to bring it to gatherings.

It was okay, but there was a tinny flavor that I think came from the commercial dressing. I like the mix of ingredients, so I'll try it next time with homemade dressing.

I had some cooked noodles leftover from another dish and found this recipe. I just had to about cut it in half. It was quick to mix together. My mom made something similar but added salad surpreme seasoning. As this was not going to a pot-luck, and I wasn't concerned about appearance, I just added some shredded cheddar instead of the cubed. It was what I had. For the veggies, I used a bag of steamed Normandy vegetables. I am not a fan of raw broccoli and similar vegetables. Only wished it refrigerated well. It was good fresh, but got mushy by the next day.

Used penne with cucumbers, onion, carrot and radishes. No cheese and we did add olives. I did add a bit of olive oil and red wine vinegar to the wishbone dressing.

I halved this and it made three good meal(lunch) portions for our appetites. I make my own homemade Italian dressing so I did not use wishbone brand. For the halved recipe, I did not need nearly 1/2 C of dressing as it would have been way too much and hid the flavor of the vegetables. I used yellow squash, orange and green bell peppers, and tomatoes.

I used the wishbone dressing with a very large pasta salad mixture for a BBQ. I did not add cheese but did add several heads of broccoli, some ears of corn and some mixed veggies. I left out the onions because I know several of my guests don't like them. I was happily surprised at how tasty the wishbone dressing is on pasta salad! Despite using 3 bags of pasta (and a ton of veggies) I did not use the entire bottle of dressing because I hate salads that are dripping in dressing. Instead I added just enough to give the salad a mild zesty flavor that made it tasty yet appealing to all palettes. I will definitely use the wishbone dressing again in future pasta salads as it was a winner! (And soooo easy too!)
(I gave this recipe four stars only because I did not include all of the ingredients in my dish)

This is my regular recipe except the cheese and the olives.  Sometimes simple is just the best, and I've never found a home made dressing that has just the right flavor for this.  Wish bone really is the best for pasta salad.  I always make this a day ahead to let the pasta and the veggies absorb the dressing, then add another big squirt right before serving.

Good recipe. For veggies I used 1/2 cup of chopped onion, 1 cucumber, 1 cup of shredded carrots, 1 whole chopped tomato and added shredded cheddar and tbsp of Italian seasoning. Works well with salad seasoning!

A great combination of veggies and pasta. I did make the creamy dressing, combining Italian dressing with  mayonnaise about half and half. Yes I will make it again!

I usually make a pasta salad that calls for more ingredients than this one, but I didn't have a lot on hand. This was perfect for a side dish. I used red and green bell peppers, red onion and zucchini. I had the Wish Bone Italian Dressing on hand, and I just added a sprinkling of Italian seasoning. Quick, easy and tasty. (I like all the variation ideas listed in the footnotes, although I didn't try any of them yet.)
