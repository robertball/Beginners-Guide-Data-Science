This was like a yummy oatmeal Mounds bar.  I used applesauce for the oil and added about a quarter cup of milk.  The kids really enjoyed it.  I will probably make it again...but I'll probably add some slivered almonds and use mini chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe Shirley.

I know the recipe says "crispy" but I think I was still expecting somewhat of an oatmeal consistency.  To me this is more like granola.  My kids enjoyed it because it was like eating cookies for breakfast.  If I do make this again it will definitely not be for breakfast.

LOVE IT!! I just love baked oatmeal to begin with and tried this recipe because I didn't have milk and am very happy with the recipe. This is the one I now like best because it is most similar to a healthy oatmeal cookie in consistency without having a load of unhealthy ingredients. I use 1/8 c. brown sugar (I don't like it sweet) and 2 t. B.P. (not even sure if the B.P. is needed but I used it) and added crushed walnuts instead of chocolate chips and did not add any salt. After mixing and pouring in the pan I patted it down with a fork so when it baked it would form a bar. It is great sliced into bars (it is a delicate bar) or crumbled into a bowl with milk.

I think I am unfairly rating this recipe because I'm trying to find the baked oatmeal that I remember having a couple years ago and this one just wasn't what I remembered.  I made this for a couple people and they all really enjoyed it, but I just couldn't get past the fact that I am craving the baked oatmeal I remember.

I skipped the coconut and chocolate and added chopped apples and fresh cranberries (had to use them up.  Then I added milk cause I thought it looked dry and a tsp of vanilla.  I baked it about 30 minutes and served with a little milk poured over the top.  Loved it!!

This is something that freezes well so we make several and freeze. We add some kind of berries to the bottom of the pan and sweeten with honey. We also add ground flaxseed.

Turned out like a soft, chewy granola.  The kids thought it was OK.  I thought it was better than OK.  A little salty though.  Will make again with the coconut, no salt, and substitute the applesauce for the oil to keep the fat down.

I'm not a fan of raisins so I make this more like a cookie and add mini chocolate chips and pecans. It is a little dry, especially the next day but great with a cup of coffee or milk.

This was great right out of the oven.  It was a little dry the next day, but still good.  This could easily be modified to suit your personal tastes by switching the mix-ins.  Pecans, dried cranberries, or apples would be delicious additions.

This just didn't hold together. It was super crumbly. You would think with all that sugar and chocolate it would be a hit with the kids. They said it was just ok. It wasn't worth the effort or the calories.

I'm changing my rating to a 5.  That's after I just finished off the remainder of the batch.  Like I said before, a very good base.  I'll definitely use applesauce instead of oil, add nuts, probably flax seed, probably some dried fruit and who knows what else.  Really good!
I'd give it a strong 4.  I actually made 1-1/2 of a batch because I had 3 eggs to use up.  Therefore it made it thicker in the pan.  I didn't pack it down much at all as it just said to spoon it in.  Next time I'll pack it down abit as it really crumbles if you don't.  I'd like to have it stick together a bit more than it does.  I also added almonds (which I liked).  It tastes a bit salty to me, but no one else thought so.  But it tasted salty in a good way - like kettle korn (sweet and salty).  I will definitely make again and substitute at least 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  Basically a very good base to which you could add nuts, cranberries, etc.

I have used this for a year or more, making it like a cereal with these changes...no chocolate chips...and instead of raisins I use other dried fruit..cranberries, and the "blueberry-pomegranate" flavored cranraisins...a whole pkg...2 handfuls of whole almonds, a handful of sunflower seeds, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 c flax seed and increase the oatmeal to 4 cups.. Bake for about 20 minutes...and then I store it in a container in the frig after cool...and we eat it with fruit and milk instead of store bought preservative full cereals..and it relatively healthy with your flax, oats, and nuts..

This came out tasty, but I did add milk. I was scared of how dry it looked, and added just enough milk to make it look like I thought it should. (I also halved the recipe.) Adding the brown sugar to the wet ingredients made it lump up -- I suggest adding it with the dry ingredients and incorporating it there before adding to the wet. All in all I was pleased, but, like I said, I did add milk. From the looks of the "batter" before I added milk, this WOULD come out ok -- just a little less soft & cakelike than I wanted this morning. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I omitted the coconut and added a sprinkle of nutmeg just for personal taste.  Will definitely make again.  It's a great quick dinner (with fruit) when you don't have time to make dinner!

Great alternative to a plain bowl of oatmeal when you're trying to increase your fiber. It got a little crumbly by the next day and used it in my yogurt.

This was an excellent brunch item.  I thought I'd over-baked it, but it was even better with crunch!  I made it again the next Saturday morning.

I made this last weekend when I was visiting my Aunt. I followed the recipe exactly except for the chocolate chips because neither one of us felt like having something THAT sweet for breakfast. The recipe turned out great, except for (as other reviewers have commented) it was a little bit too salty. So I would suggest using 1/2 a teaspoon rather than a whole one. Next time I make this I think I'll try serving it with fresh berries on top and maybe try almond milk rather than regular milk.

This recipe is almost exactly the same as my moms recipe that i have grown up on. The only thing that is different is that its so much drier. I would use less oats. And its always best with applesauce poured over it or milk and cinnamon and sugar!! Over all good recipe although i use olive oil instead of vegetable just to be healthier.

The oatmeal turned out pretty poorly. I have had better. My family all asked if it was a knew recipe. I think I will go back to my tried and tested baked oatmeal.

Maybe without the choc chips?  I don't love the combo of raisins and choc.
