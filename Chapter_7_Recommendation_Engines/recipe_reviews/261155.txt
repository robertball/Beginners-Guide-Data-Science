We thought the amount of frosting was too much and it needed flavor. We added vanilla and salt to help the taste. The scones needed more pumpkin flavor. Next time we will add Moore pumpkin and maybe some pumpkin spice.

I made it, not impressed...  needs more pumpkin than the recipe requires, bland and the texture not what I expect in a scone (?) had to try it though.  I doctored it up with pumpkin puree in the glaze.
