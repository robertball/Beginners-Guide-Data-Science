My whole family loved this (6 yr old, 10 yr old, father, and mom)!  Excellent.  I  used it on a pork butt to make pulled pork.

Yummo!  Everyone loved these ribs!  I just want to add that  prior to rubbing the spices on,  I use a very sharp knife and remove as much of the membrane on the back of the ribs as possible.  I also cut a slit between every 2 bones and get the rub inside there too.  I smoke them for 2-3 hours on a wood fired grill.  Then I put them into the oven for 3-4 hours on 250.  I like to do them a day ahead of time so there is no rush on the party day.

This rub is great! I used this on some ribs (followed by barbecue sauce) and my husband and I loved it. I left the cilantro out of the mix because we don't care for it and I also did not add the cayenne pepper.

I added more brown sugar, but this is a great mix for chicken breasts on the grill.

I've used this rub for about 10 years now.  The only difference with mine, I cannot use cilantro(wife is allergic).

We thought this was awesome. I put it on about 24 hours before I cooked my ribs and the meat was so flavorful and just spiced perfectly. Will definitely make again.
