Very good! I used a bag of slaw mix (b/c I'm lazy, lol), and an 8oz. can of pineapple tidbits, that I cut in half, and both worked great. I also doubled the dressing. I think that I would use more green onions next time, as I really liked the flavor of them w/ the pineapple. A nice change from the usual...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is an amazing cole slaw if you are like me and don't like the overloaded mayonnaise feel of most slaws. I also went the easy way and bought bagged slaw mix, and used a red bell pepper for both flavor and color. The green onion gives it a nice pop as well. I will be making this again and again, I served it with BBQ pork sliders and Mac 'n Cheese.

I also bought a bag of slaw and a can of crushed pineapple!  I used Rice vinegar, Vegenaise and 1 tsp of Agave instead of all the sugar the recipe called for. I also skipped the salt and pepper because it had so much flavor on its own. My entire family LOVES IT. This will become a summer fav.

This is my first review after years of using this app. I am a sailor aboard a ship and came to port with krout I made myself and found a pineapple tree. With much research if found that the two actually go together. A little dill, onion and sugar I was able to make a great slaw. I also added jalape√±o. I'm not sure how to make my own recipe on here but this was good. I am an amazing cook able to fork out food with ingredients on hand. My krout is just literally stuffing cabbage in a jar with no extra ingredients so when a recipe calls for cabbage and vinegar, the cabbage makes vinegar, something I never knew before sailing. It is so good. I mean so good!

I made this and used canned pineapple because that was what I had on hand. I added the pineapple juice and reduced the vinegar to offset

I thought this was a very nice variation. We love Cole Slaw!  I only had a small can of pineapple so l added a can of mandarin orange segments and I got lots of compliments at a potluck gift exchange.

This was yummy!  I didn't have real mayo so used Miracle Whip and didn't add any extra sugar.  The red bell pepper mixed in really made it look pretty on the plate.  I made this as a side to a marinated pork loin and coconut rice, and my daughter commented that it tasted like Thai restaurant food.  As she has traveled in Thailand, I considered that a real compliment :)

This is a good recipe. Because I'm basically a lazy cook, I used a bag of shredded cabbage. I liked using fresh pineapple because of it's natural juices. This is my go-to summer potluck recipe. It's best to let it sit for a few hours before serving. I always get rave reviews.
