I just wanted to thank the submitter SO MUCH for this recipe because finally it is not a chore to eat vegetables.  I make this all the time to get my veggies in.  I usually add corn and cilantro because they go so well with this dish.  I also use whatever cheese I have on hand and the result is always good!

Yum! I made this as written except for cutting my veggies a little chunkier than called for because I like them barely cooked - and I also put the chopped tomatoes at the very end because I had a tomato-hater in the house. This was my first time eating hot jicama and I really liked it in this. Asedero cheese behaves similarly to an American processed cheese, so subbing with a processed Jack cheese would bring you close to the intentional flavor and texture of this dish if you are unable to get Asedero . Thanks for the recipe - delicious!

I roasted my vegetables instead, drizzled with a bit of olive oil for about 20 min., delicious.  Hardo to find the queso asadero, but I used another mexican cheese, and it was delicious.

I was able to find all of the ingredients including the queso asadero. My only change is that I got this "brilliant" idea to make it a little less fattening. Instead of using a cup of cheese, my idea was to just melt a little and then drizzle it over the finished dish. Problem is that it had been a long time since I had bought this kind of cheese and I had forgotten how thick is stays after melted. All I had to thin it out was half n half. So much for less fattening..ha ha. Next time I will use the entire cup of cheese and make as written. We enjoyed this very much. The jicama did stay a bit crunchy as others mentioned but we liked it that way. Almost forgot, my tomatos had gone bad without me knowing it so I substituted with some red bell pepper. This is a great side to go with Mexican meals. Thanks for sharing Linda!

This will be a great side dish for any mexican main entree. I had just some zucchinis, yellow squashs and tomatoes in my fridge. And I looked up on this site, a vegetable side dish using these 3 veggies. This one sounded good since I needed some vegetables to go with a mexican casserole. I gave it a try, using just what I had in my fridge , plus onions and garlic Also added some cilantro). I did not have the cheese it called for either. But it still came out delicious. Thanks you so much for this good recipe.

I didn't have jicama or chayote on hand, so I used quartered brussel sprouts which I sauted about 15 min prior to adding the squash.  Delicious!

I really liked the veggies.  Lots of flavor.  As I started cooking looked like too much seasoning, but tasted really good.  My husband is not a big squash fan so he thought they were only ok....does make al ot of veggies...

No one went crazy over this. I couldnt get the jicama cooked. I would suggest cutting into very small pieces and cooking them first.  The squash and zucchini were very mushy by the time I was finished cooking and the jicama still was too hard. Or leave the jicama out all together. I dont like very spicy things and I still thought this didnt have enough flavor.  We also used this to fill tortillas which was a good suggestion by another reviewer. You could make this a good dish with additional seasoning and no jicama.

Absolutely delicious! We loved this dish! I had to leave out the jicama only because my market was all out, and I also couldn't find the cheese, but only had a day to try and find it, so I used velveeta. The seasonings are right on in this dish, not one overpowers the other, they blend perfectly. I can't wait to make this in the summer with  zucchini and tomatoes from my garden. Next time I make this (which will be soon), I'm wrapping this mix up in a big burrito sized tortilla and making a meal out of this! Thanks Linda for sharing this recipe, we really enjoyed it :)

We really enjoyed this.  The veggies are tender crisp and the flavors blend beautifully.  I was unable to find any white Mexican cheese, so I subbed goat cheese.  I will be making this again and trying different cheeses.  Thanks for sharing Linda.

Very good. I used vegies I had on hand: zucchini, carrots, and broccoli. I cooked the vegies for 10 minutes. I added the fresh tomatoes just before adding cheddar cheese. Will most definitely make again!

I changed some of the vegetables but did most of what the recipe said to do.  I had a chayote, zucchini and tomatoes that needed to be cooked then added cauliflower, fresh corn, thinly sliced 1/4 C. yellow bell pepper and about 1 tsp. of fresh jalapeno pepper.  I didn't have jicama on hand and used cheddar instead of mexican cheese.  To finish I added about two TBSP of half and half to make it creamier and served it over white rice.  I love it and so did my guests.  Nice kick but not too hot.

I used this as a very helpful starting point. I cut up thick chunks of onion, zucchini, and red and orange and yellow bell peppers and tossed them in melted butter, Mexican seasoning from Whole Foods, and a little Trader Joe's taco seasoning. I roasted them at 350 for about 30 minutes and they were a perfect accompaniment to tacos with Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos (from Allrecipes).

It needed to have a greater variety of flavors and spices.
