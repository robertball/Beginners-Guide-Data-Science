Best kraut dog I ever made! Followed directions but didn't have celery seed, so I put in a pinch of celery powder instead. Simmered everything for about 10 minutes before putting on bun, then hotdog on top. Finished with a line of spicy brown mustard. Will make again and again! Loved it!

Love this recipe!  The only thing I do differently, and that is just because I like to make the hot dogs in the sauerkraut, is I add about 1 & 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken stock to the kraut mixture after adding the other ingredients.  Let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  Add your hot dogs (we buy German hot dogs at the meat market) and simmer until they are heated through.  Serve on poppyseed buns, with German mustard and the kraut as a garnish .. mmmm .. you can't go wrong!
