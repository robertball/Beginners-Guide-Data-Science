One of our favorite Panini recipes!  Quick and easy to make for a lunch that looks like it was slaved over.

This was pretty good. Very light sandwich. Perfect for the summer. Only reason I wont go 5 stars is the ingredient list. I probably wont make this again because the items necessary arent something I would keep on hand. In the end its just a sandwich...

Everyone loved this panini!  We used a Tuscan bread which was delicious.  The goat cheese along with the red onion gave it some tartness that blended well with the other ingredients!  We will definitely make again!

We ate every scrap!!! Very good taste combination and the Dijon dressing really makes it good. I don’t have a panini maker so put the ingredients between two sprouted tortillas making it more like a quesadilla. Used feta rather than goat cheese because it’s what I had. Sliced up leftover rotisserie chicken very thinly because we had no turkey. Followed everything else as stated in the recipe. Made my own Dijon dressing with garlic, easy to do. This recipe is a keeper! Healthy too.
