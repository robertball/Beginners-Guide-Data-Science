I added the red pepper prior to cooking and also added some baby spinach, extra lemon and a little olive oil. I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used thighs, just as delish. Very good recipe

Great, simple recipe. I marinated my chicken in lemon, olive oil, black pepper, oregano and parsley a couple hours before baking. I assembled the dish, pouring the marinate over the chicken and kept on the fridge until ready to bake. Easy "make ahead" dish. I think I'll save the juice to make rice or orzo.

Great recipe.. made a few alterations, I added the red bell pepper before baking, added some spinach, extra lemon, and some olive oil.. threw in some cashews towards the end. Won't give it 5 stars because it's a good recipe.. but not blow your mind good.

Simple and delish! I added the red pepper before baking but followed recipe exactly other than that. Everyone had seconds!

Fantastic recipe!   I also added the red pepper before cooking and we added some cherry tomatoes too.  It smelled amazing and tasted just as good.  I'm making it for the second time in as many weeks tonight.

My family loves this recipe! Play with it to suit your own taste... we like a little spice so I add extra seasonings. I also add whatever veggies I have on hand (broccoli is the favorite) and little white wine. If the kids are home I melt some mozz on top too - soooo good!

This was so good I have made it a few times now for different people and everyone has loved it but I did bake the bell peppers with the chicken even though the recipe was to put the bell peppers and parsley on after it baked and I used juice from a whole lemon instead of the amount it said

I added the red pepper before putting in the oven and threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms that I had on hand.  I  used dried oregano instead of parsley.  Chicken was moist and tender, but overall was just an OK recipe.  Good for finicky eaters as even my son liked the chicken-only!

Love this recipe! Very simple and very yummy. Not a red peppers person so I don't use them, but I add olive oil along with the lemon juice. Plus I use tomato and basil feta cheese and it's just as good.

Nice, easy recipe. I used roasted red peppers and added them before baking. I think next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll use a Greek seasoning mix instead of salt & pepper. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I first saw it in the container of Athenos feta and figured I would try it... it was a winner! I like to put the red pepper on before cooking as I like it cooked better than raw.
