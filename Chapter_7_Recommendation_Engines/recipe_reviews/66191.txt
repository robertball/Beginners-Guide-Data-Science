I absolutely loved this recipe! I made some minor changes to suit our tastes: instead of cashews, I used sesame sticks (don't like nuts), I used half white cheddar and half regular cheez-its, and instead of onion salt, I used a spicy salt ("Vulcan Fire Salt" from the Spice House). I really wish I would have made a double batch! Thanks for posting...

I doubled this for a party and even though there weren't as many people attending as I expected there was hardly a crumb left when the night was over.  I used butter instead of vege oil and stuck with good old chedder cheez-its (don't care for the white).

Because I didn't have Crispix or Cheez-IT's, I used Rice Chex and goldfish crackers. I didn't want to overdo it on the salt, so I used a half teaspoon of celery flake and two teaspoons each of garlic/onion powder instead of half garlic/onion salt. I increased the vegetable oil to a quarter cup cup, one tablespoon couldn't have been enough for this whole batch. I won't be making this again. It just needs too much adjusting and definitely more spices.

Excellent snack.  We made several times to send to our daughter in college.  She and her friends loved it, and requested it be sent often.
