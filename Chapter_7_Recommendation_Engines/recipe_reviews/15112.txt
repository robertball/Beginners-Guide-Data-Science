I've been making these for years (we call them speedy little devils).  A favorite of many.  Two things I do differently though: bake for 18 minutes (they are a bit more gooey) and I use more peanut butter (approx 3/4 - 1 cup depending on my mood:).  Really, when is more peanut butter a bad thing?

Simple to make is about all this recipe has going for it. The result was crumbly and dry and the flavor of chocolate and peanut butter are hidden by overwhelming sweetness. I was disappointed and won't be bringing it to the picnic I'd hoped to share it at.

This was good, but I'd recommend using a smaller pan, and increasing the peanut butter-marshmallow mixture.

Maybe mine came our PERFECT because I DOUBLED it; used 3/4 butter and used 1 C. PB.  I have also used BROWNIE MIX - which is my husband's favorite since it's a little more gooier.   I have also tried this with Vanilla mix & lemon pie filling (3/4 can).  I have also tried this with Vanilla mix and raspberry pie filling (3/4 can)   UMMMM YUMMY !  TAKE OUT BEFORE YOU THINK IT'S COOKED ALL THE WAY... that's why it's dry.

I must say, these are quite tasty little treats for such a simple, 4 ingredient recipe....I was pleasantly surprised!  After reading all the reviews, I decided to make these into cupcakes to avoid the hassle of trying to spread the filling onto the base in a large cake pan.  It worked out very well!  Put a tablespoon of the cake mixture down, then a spoonful of filling, more cake mix on top & pressed down lightly.  I baked these for about 14-15 minutes & they were perfect!  The kids gobbled them up....my 11 year old son said they were "AMAZING"!

Great cookies, especially if you're a chocolate & peanut butter fan!!  When I was assembling them, I didn't think it was going work, but they came out wonderfully.

Dry, crumbly, though the flavor was good.  I think I will play with this recipe until it is the consistency I enjoy.  More filling, less cooking time, less crust all possibilities to improve the texture.

Yummy!  Next time I'll put more crumbs on the bottom so the top part of the cookie isn't so thick.

These turned out really yummy!!  Like the other readers, I wasn't sure they would turn out, but the cake/butter mix makes a great bar crust.  With only 4 ingredients, it doesn't get any easier either!  I baked them in a little bit smaller dish then 9x13 and the bars were nice and thick.  My family yummed them up!  Definitely a keeper recipe!!!!  Thanks Susan!

These were fantastic.  I did have to work with the crust to get it to stay in the pan, but as long as you're willing to be patient, it's just fine.  I think next time I make them I will double the filling & add in a bit more peanut butter.  I found that a big pizza cutter works better then anything else to cut them.  Great recipe!

I thought this was amazing! The peanut butter and marshmallow creme together was good enough to eat on it's own. Poking the mixture into the corners with your fingers works fine because it's too stiff to do so with a spoon and stiff enough to not leave your fingers all sticky and gooey. The trick to cutting is cool it completely and wait for the marshmallow to stiffen again beforehand and it works great. It is a bit crumbly; you might want to use less cake mix on top or press it down more. Awesome!

The filling was too sticky too spread. Next time I will melt peanut butter(maybe it will help to be spreadable.  But otherwise these were really good.  I used a 9x13 pan and they came out thin.  So I will try a smaller pan maybe 9x9.  I liked this since it was fast too make and really good.

These should be called Lil' Addictive Devils.  Yummy!  My three year old and I have already eaten quite a few and they haven't even cooled yet.  These are so good and easy too.  Hope there's enough left for my husband to try when he gets home.  =) I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again soon. Thanks for sharing.

Super easy to make! Cut these in large squares while they are still warm and then put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with chocolate syrup or hot fudge! Yummy!!! Will make these again!

I did not care for these at all. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and am fond of just about any chocolate-PB combination - EXCEPT for this one. :( The PB / marshmallow fluff mixture was really good on its own (I literally licked my bowl and spatula clean!), but when combined with the cake mix, it was purely sugar overkill. The bars had a gritty texture, most likely from the cake mix. The PB taste was also barely noticeable even tho I added 1/4 cup more than called for. My bars crumbled a bit (which was a nuisance), but the real deal breaker for me was how sweet these were. Maybe these will float your boat, but they didn't do anything for me. Thanks anyways, Susan.

This was a major hit!!  I agree with the others, it doesn't look like it will work when you're putting it together, but amazingly it does.  I added more peanut butter and marshmellow creme than the recipe calls for to make it extra gooey.
