This is a good recipe and fairly easy if you are short on preparation time.  It is actually very similar to gooey butter cake, I usually only bake this 35-40 minutes so it maintains some of that gooeiness, and sometimes I will add some chocolate or toffee chips if I want a change.  Will make again!

Simply loved it. I did have to substitute a few ingredients. Instead of using yellow cake mix, I used a box of Angel Food. Also, I used home-grown eggs and used 2 additional ones overall. Finally I decided to add a layer of chocolate on top, so I used 3 ounces of unsweetened baking bars, 3 T Powdered sugar, and half a can of sweetened condensed milk to make a topping in a double boiler. Once Again, this is one of the best desserts I've made in a long time.

Love this recipe! I have used it as a base so many times experimenting with different cake mixes      ( favorites butter pecan & swiss chocolate). As of late I melted & added ghiradelli bitter sweet chocolate chips to top layer for an exceptional brownie so decadent I have saved voicemails from coworkers spouses on my office phone telling me it was the best they'd ever eaten! Thanks for a wonderful recipe:)

These have been in my oven at 300 degrees fr 1 1/2 hours.  They no have foil over them as the top is brown but the cake mix is still gooey.  (as if it hasn't yet been cooked) I am hoping that the top works out because that is the reason I tried this recipe.  Other recipes that are similar always have a runny top... so far this one seems nice and thick.  Now let's hope it doesn't burn.

I had a commitment to make dessert for 70 people, then got sick, and my plan for little elegant mini-cheesecakes had to take second place.  I decided to try this recipe because I could rest while it cooked.  Boy am I glad I did.  I live out of the country and much of the time, when people want cakes, they buy Tres Leches cakes that have lots of fruit and cream on top, but I want to eat cake, not drink it.  So I have become popular for bringing new flavors and desserts to events.  This one went over really well.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in an 11x16 pan, only making one change.  I added orange extract to the cake part for a bit of extra flavor.  Caramel sauce over the top and we have 70 very happy participants.

EVERYONE devoured these.  I keep getting requests at work for me to make them again!  Definately a 5 star.  The only change I made was I press some mini chocolate chips into the brownie layer before pouring the cream cheese layer on top.  DELISH!!!

I've made this recipe for years, but as lemon bars - which are awesome! Here's what I do differently:

Melt the butter and blend with cream cheese; save 1/2 C and set it aside (this will be the glaze frosting after it bakes). Then add the egg to the remaining mixture.
To the confectioner's sugar (2 3/4 C for those who buy the big Costco bags!), I add either 2 tsp lemon extract or 2 TBS lemon juice.
Bake at 325 for 35-40 minutes; frost it as soon as it comes out of the oven. It becomes a bit of a glaze. Always a hit!

I subbed candied fruit mix for chocolate. It's like a light fruit cake. Great heated with ice cream.

Very sweet and delicious! I used 2 eggs in the "brownie" mixture part, so that was the only thing I'd change. Other than that, I will definitely be making this sweet treat again!

Ok this was so delicious. I used whipped cream cheese and it is so important to let it completely cool before you cut it. I wanted to submit a picture of it but it's almost gone.
