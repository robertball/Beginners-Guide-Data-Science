I added an extra egg, powdered milk, chicken broth in place of the water, half a jar of peanut butter, and crumbled bacon. I also used 1 cup of rolled oats in place of 3/4 cup of the whole wheat flour. The beauty of this recipe is that you can add in just about anything that can be mixed easily, and it will work. Used part rendered beef fat since I only had 3 strips of bacon. I wasn't up to rolling and cutting, so I just rolled little balls and flattened them to bake. You can pack them closely together on the baking sheet, since they don't expand as they bake. Remember to store in the fridge, as they don't contain preservatives and will get moldy in time. I feel good about giving these out as treats because they're all natural and I know exactly what went into them. My Westie, my daughter's mixed breed and her boyfriend's puggle will do back flips to get their jaws around one of these! Edited to add:No need to buy bacon. Save all trimmings from steak, chicken (plus skin,) pork,etc. in the freezer. When you have a handful or two, render (fry on low for about 15-20 minutes to melt off the fat.) Chop up the pieces left in the rendering pan and put them in the mix with the rendered fat. No expensive bacon needed. That's stuff you'd normally throw in the trash. You're recycling, AND your doggie will go nuts - promise!

my dogs love this and other dogs do too. Even fussy dogs. I don't use eggs or milk, and add a teaspoon of baking powder. will try adding corn meal next time. I flatten the dough with my palm, bake, and leave the pan of biscuits in the oven after turning the oven off so that the biscuits get hard and dry.

These were great, according to my dogs ;-) Both dogs loved them. I diced up a pound of bacon and cooked it adding the bacon bits along with the fat. I increased the recipe size then added more fat and bacon. It was a hit! I refrigerated the leftovers and even froze some... thinking my dogs wouldn't eat them so quickly. They were gone within the week! I'm making more today at my dogs request!! Oh, I also wanted to mention that salt is not healthy for dogs so I'd advise omitting it from the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!

Made these just now and my dog loves them!  I tried them myself just to see what they tasted like, and from a human perspective they were a little too floury and bland, but I'm sure in the canine world it doesn't matter much!  I didn't add the salt because the bacon has so much salt in it already, but I did finely chop up 1 piece of bacon and added about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and I also flattened them with the bottom of a glass.  And lastly, since after tasting them I thought they were bland, I decided to baste the top of each one with some leftover bacon grease, like icing!  Great recipe, and in moderation the ingredients are not bad for your furry friends!  2/21/12:  Made these again today and didn't have quite enough bacon grease, so I added 1/2 smashed banana and left the rest of the ingredients the same.  Came out great!

FUN!  I made these as a project with my three year old niece, and she LOVED helping add the flour and the impromptu extra seasonings (like garlic powder and parsley.)  She's even mastered the levers on my stand mixer which we used (dough hook) to mix it all up.  The dough was not greasy like I thought it would be, and we hand-pressed it flat and used bone-shaped cookie cutters.  They baked perfectly in 35 minutes, and somehow my dog knew these were for him when I took them out of the oven.  I am thinking about selling these at a farmers' market this summer!  Fun, fast, easy, kid-friendly baking recipe!  Thanks!

I was looking for recipes because I ran out of biscuits.  I made a baked ham in the crock pot and had left over drippings.  I substitued this for the water and bacon fat and ommitted the salt.  My 120 pound Akita is in heaven.
I also rolled the dough out on a floured board and used a dog cookie cutter.  They turned out perfect.

All of my friends have dogs and when we get together, everyone brings them along.  When I brought out the batch of biscuits there was a swarm of dog's all around me! I couldn't get them to leave me alone!  To be funny, I used a cat shaped cookie cutter to make the biscuts in the shape of cats!

My name is Boomer I am a 5yr.old GreatDane/Labradore Retriever mix. I am a very picky eater. There are some human foods that I find shocking that my mother would eat. There are some dog foods that I was astounded that my mother would try to feed to me. There was a dog treat that my mom tried to feed me and I was insulted and turned my head.    When my mom gave me this biscuit my tail wagged the whole time I ate it , I walked up to her sat pretty, hoping she would give me more but she told me I would get more tommarow.

My name is Shadow I am a 3yr.old Akita/Pitbull mix and Boomer's little brother. I am not picky. If you give it to me i'll eat it. These biscuits were quite tasty. I like the idea that it only took my mom between 45mins and an hour to make them, when before I had to wait on mom to get back from shopping to get my biscuit which took 2 or 3 hours, and also I get to eat extra store bought biscuits
that my picky brother just lets leave laying around.
What can I say I got it made. I went from an abusive home to a loving home, whith a sharing brother and homemade biscuits.

Thank you miss, 
Boomer and Shadow. (kiss kiss slup slurp)

I did add one thing not on the recipe.  I live by myself and do not like bacon, and did not want to wast it. So after I cooked the bacon I put it in a blender, chopped it up, then put it in the mixture after the salt, and before the bacon fat. This was very easy to make, and my first time making home made anything for dogs, or any animal.

Because I don't save my bacon grease, I went to a diner and asked them for some.  I ran out of wheat flour, so i filled up the remaining 5 c of flour with cornmeal and white flour.  The dogs love them!

It is funny how my precious Libby knew they were for her.  I have never seen her sit at the oven while I am taking out a dish.  She just set there, wagging her tail like hurry up mommy.  Now she is so spoiled.  I have used peanut butter when I have no bacon grease and she knew they were for her too.  I did change the recipe after I tried it the first time.  It got so dry it was hard to handle, so now I mix with all purpose flour and it is a lot easier to handle.  I roll the dough out and cut with a pizza cutter.  I found I get a lot more that way.  Leave it in the oven over night to make sure they are dried out and store them in container.  If they are not dried out they will mold. So make sure they dry out before putting them in the container.  My dog thanks you...

Our dog absolutely loves these treats!  He is a pug and they made him extremely gassy.  It might be a pug thing but it might also be a treat thing...

These are great and my dogs love them. So, I just made two batches for an animal shelter bake sale! I rolled them out to 1/4 inch thick, cut them out with a tiny heart shaped cookie cutter, and baked them for about 18 minutes. It made a couple hundred and they turned out perfect.  I did run out of whole wheat flour, so I substituted regular flour and wheat germ. It worked just fine.

The dog loves them!  I made a few revisions.  Along with bacon, I added a jar of beef baby food, chicken broth for water, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 cp peanut butter.  My first batch baked at 350F for 35, they came out looking burnt.  The second, I bake at 200F for 30 mins and then turned the oven off, leaving the cookies in the oven till cool.  Tips:  roll out small batches at a time as not to overwork the dough.  I made 70 cookies.

My daughter and I enjoy making these for our 2 dogs. We roll them out and cut them with cookie cutters. Both of our dogs enjoy them. My daughter says that they are "dog delicious".  This recipe is a good project to make with kids and will save you money on healthy dog snacks for your furry friends. (for even more flavor use the water/oil from canned tuna which would normally be thrown away).

aweseome.....just a side note..how ever you shape them they cook that way. They do not rise or expand so you can make little biscuits and put the very close to each other on a cookie sheet.

My Granddog, an Australia Shepherd, just about attacks me when we go to visit.  He knows I will have his treats. I've never seen a dog so wild over a treat like these.   I use about 7 T of bacon fat (which I freeze till I accumulate enough) and the rest liquid Crisco, 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness and use a large shot glass for a cutter.  It is about 2 inch's in diameter. The dough rolls very nicely, not at all  sticky.  They are so easy to make . I bake them for about 39 minutes.  It makes about 85 to 90.  I freeze them as we only use them when Boomer visits us or we visit him.  So I really give these  treats 10 stars. I know Boomer would too. He sneezes for his treats and starts to sneeze constantly.  LOL

My dog loves these treats! I add tumeric and fresh parley, sometimes ground flax for extra nutrition. They go fast! Great gift too for friends that are dog lovers.

This is the best dough I've ever used for dog biscuits.  Very easy to handle.  I just formed balls and then flattened them just a little bit.  Excellent!

Noodles and Lilly love these.  We shared with a little puppy friend who also loved them.  Easy to make!  I had this printed for a while before I made these (had to collect the bacon fat) - forgot the picture shows FLATTENED balls and the recipe doesn't say to do that. . . Also, my dogs are small so next time I'll make smaller balls and adjust the cooking time.

This recipe is absolutely AWESOME!!! I have changed the recipe some. I cooked some bacon and chopped it up, added some cheddar cheese, and I also rolled out the dough and used a bone shaped cookie cutter. My dogs stay in the kitchen while I make them. After I give them one, they follow me to the kitchen when ever I go. They think that they will get one of these tasty TREATS every time!!!

These have become a favourite of all my friends dogs...to them I have become the lady with the delicious treats!

I use beef bouillon in place of the water and sometimes I add garlic powder which is a natural flea repellent.

5 Stars according to my pug, Riley and my neighbors Jack Russell, Leon! Riley loved them so much he swallowed them whole.  I crushed some of the bacon and placed it in the batter.  The dogs found them irresistible!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I make it almost once a week.  It is versatile, sometimes I use white flour or substitute corn meal for some of the flour.  I don't make bacon very often so I save grease from hamburger or leftover oil with the crispies from frying chicken or pork chops.  I have a bowl in the fridge for grease that I save up until I am ready to bake.  I also throw a jar or two of meat baby food if I don't have enough grease.  Word of warning, my dogs will not eat store bought biscuits now.

Made this recipe (with some tweeking) for my two very picky and spoiled pit bulls...I replaced the bacon grease with coconut oil (good for healthy skin and shiny coat)... And I used chicken broth instead of water, and added about 1 cup of oats... Both dogs love them! And now they know the sound the container that they are in makes when it is opened and come running! Will be making many more recipes through all recipes.com... my favorite cooking/baking website!!

These were a hit with our three dogs.  And since we eat a lot of bacon, I love having a way to use the grease.

I can't believe my dogs ate these.  I SWORE they wouldn't, but they LOVED them!  Also substituted bacon for chicken and rice (friends dog has sensitive stomach) even they loved them!  This is a perfect recipe with no need for tweaking or additions.  A KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing!

My veterinarian friend and my two vet-tech friends repeatedly tell me about dogs with terrible cases of pancreatitis in dogs who have been fed pork, including bacon/bacon fat.  Apparently it's just too rich for them (hence the digestive issues experienced by dogs. Just a heads up!

I made these for my dog, but did leave out the bacon and substituted with chicken broth and 2 teaspoons of butter, pork gives my dog gas, also added a little garlic powder to the last pan. Thanks for the recipe, they are very easy to make.

Great recipe! My French Bulldogs LOVE this biscuit~ I went a step further and lightly cooked 1lb of bacon, diced it fine as I could and added it along with the fat it produced to a DOUBLE batch of this recipe...the 1lb didnt quite give me enough oil so I used vegetable oil for the rest. I also used broth instead of water. You wanna dice your bacon fine or use a food processor if you plan to use cookie cutters because the bits of bacon in your way is annoying! Also, I added the flour in a little at a time and decided my dough didn't need all the recipe called for & the salt I omitted completley. The dogs went NUTS for these biscuits but make sure to keep them in the fridge, freeze some as they go mould fast even in a ziploc at room temp.

Love this simple recipe, but a few suggestions:  1. cut up some bacon to add more flavor.  2. You don't have to roll out and cut into shapes.  My dog doesn't care what they look like so he gets dropped cookie-like ones. They take far less time to prepare.  3.  Remember to store these in the fridge because they do spoil.  And as another reviewer stated, this recipe is very flexible, try adding in your other favorite things to the mix.

This is a fantastically easy recipe definately deserves 5 stars!  Both the cat & dog went absolutely crazy for these!  As our animals are old, I added Omega 3 oil & Glucosamine Condroitin finely chopped up.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My son and I made these for his dog Killer, and he LOVED them! ( the dog not my son....) They were so easy and a great way to use leftover bacon grease since I hate to waste anything. This recipe makes alot and they do not keep well at room temperature, so I would recommend storing them in the freezer and taking them out as needed. Great recipe!

My dogs absolutely L.O.V.E. these treats. I've made these many times, and I don't usually make them too big and then I get several more than 25.  Today I added garlic powder, and a couple tablespoons of Kirkland No-Salt Organic Seasoning.  Elvis and Jasmine just love them.  :) These also make great Christmas gifts for your friends who have dogs, as well!  :o)

I must say that I was worried about the texture until the very last cup of whole wheat flour was added. The only change I made to the recipe was using chicken broth in lieu of water, only because I had it. If I hadn't, I would have just used water. It was very much like mixing peanut butter cookie dough--works out the biceps! The consistency was awesome for my purposes. I separated it into thirds and added red food coloring to 1/3 and green to 1/3. I made "original color" snowmen and "gingerbread" boys and girls, red candy canes and green Christmas trees. My husband just HAD to taste one, and he said they were very bland and tasted like nothing. LeeLoo (my doggie), however, is a picky eater (won't even eat dog treats!) and LOVED them! **** 4 (out of 5) star review. I took one star off because they take 35 minutes (supposedly) to bake, BUT I accidentally halved the time on one batch and doubled the time on another, and the doubled ones were burnt black (grr!) but the halved ones were just fine. SO I think if you do them cookie-cutter style like I did (roll out to 1/4 inch and use cutters), you could cut the time down by half. :n)

My husband & I constantly argue about the amount of $$ that we spend on our pets, so I was looking for an alternative to store bought cookies. I read all of the reviews first & decided to substitute beef broth for the water & to add crumbled bacon for a little more flavor. Our 4 outside dogs gobbled them down!!!! I doubled the batch & ended up with 70 medium sized cookies -- which will only last @ one week with our gang. My husband is happy & so are the pups!!

These turned out really nice! A very picky German Shepherd who will refuse brand name treats loved these!! I used chicken broth in place of the water, added 5 slices of crumbled bacon, and omitted the salt. I will definitely be making these often, Buddy loved them..thanks!

These were great and super easy to make! I had teany tiny ones for training my dog. I used regular flour instead of whole wheate. This recipe is great for toying around with (you can add anything!) and my dog loves these much better than the store-bought kind.

This was very simple to make. I replaced the bacon grease with peanut butter and just patted the dough into 24 muffin tins. I also let them cool in the oven to get extra-crispy. The dogs still gobble them quickly, though!

Adopted a lovely dog who will not eat her treats. After trying a few store bought I tried these and she actually will eat them! Thanks! Definitely going to use this as a base and try peanut butter and chicken instead.

This was a great base recipe for me. We have a doggie that has Allergies to wheat, cornmeal and beef. So I ended up making these with rice flour. I added 1/4 cup extra bacon fat, replaced the wheat flour with rice flour and added an egg. We also used little cookie cutters to make fun shapes instead of balls. Rascal loved them and it was an easy, safe and cheaper alternative  to buying cookies for our dog.

My pup is loving these biscuits but I like others made several changes so it is difficult to review the recipe. I omitted the milk, used rendered chicken fat instead of bacon fat. I was out of whole wheat flour so I used white, cornmeal & rolled oats. Additionally, I added a few tbsps of peanut butter and one banana. Prior to baking I brushed each biscuit with chicken fat for added flavor. He's loving them!!!!

Easy to make. I rolled them out and let my kids cut out the biscuits. I also added a beef boullion cube to the water to give it more meaty flavor and therefore only put in 1/2 tsp of salt.. Our dog loved them!

These were fairly easy to make, and the dough is so thick and pliable that it was super easy to roll them out and make bone-shaped cookie cut-outs. I added 2 pieces of crumbled bacon for extra flavor, and my fiance's pitt goes crazy for them! My bacon-crazed teenage brother was eyeing them, too!

Followed recipe exactly and my English Bulldog went nuts over them so they seem to of been very well liked.  Then again there's not much she doesn't like :-). Seemed a little healthier too though since it was mostly just whole wheat flour.

My daughter and I made these for our 2 dogs.  They loved them!!  The only thing we changed was adding some bacon bits.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My two Cocker Spaniels love this recipe!  I rolled it out and cut with small cookie cutters.  It makes a large batch so I froze them in a Lock & Lock and only took about one cup out at a time.  They kept well for at least two weeks. Will definitely be making these again.

I made these for our 5 month old pups and they are wonderful. The pups go crazy for them. I omitted the salt (since I have read salt is not good for dogs) and added cheddar cheese and bacon cut into tiny pieces. Greta and Gus love to do tricks for these treats!

Max, my lovable mutt, liked these treats. He was a little confused by their shape at first, though.  I had to break the first one open. I made them a little smaller than the suggested 2 inch ball and had a total of 40 treats. After seeing that the first tray did not spread out, I "squashed" the second tray a little before baking. I will probably make these again, but may add cheddar cheese or chopped up bacon to the dough.

so easy and the dogs loved them; I can't walk through the kitchen today without them following expectantly! I replaced the salt with chicken boullion, I do need to make them smaller next time for my little dog, but that should have been obvious to me before I baked them :) she's not complaining. woofs to the chef

My dogs absolutely loved these treats. They just had to hear the bag open and came running and sat in great anticipation!!! Took one to my mother in laws dog who does not normally eat treats. He scarfed it down and took the other one away from her other dog. Making these again today and will be sharing with other dogs. By the way my husband and daughter both tried these and liked them too.

I made this with a few modifications and it got a big paws-up from my dogs. I cut all the ingredients in half except the eggs (I used two), for the bacon grease I substituted fat I rendered from leftover ham hocks, and I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 cup nutritional yeast. I flattened out the dough sprinkling liberally with more flour as I tri-folded three times (see Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits recipe for example), then rolled the dough out to about 1/2 inch thick on a floured surface and sliced into bite-size pieces with a pizza wheel. Next time I'll try it with just one egg and maybe add some oats...

This is my "go to" recipe for bacon dog treats! But I almost never get the whole 5 cups of flour in, usually it's around 4 1/2c and I use 2/3c of bacon grease (11 Tbs) because it's easier to measure... Be aware that by the time you get all the flour added it is quite hard on your mixer (or I should say it is on my sunbeam) so you may have to work the last bit in by hand.  GREAT RECIPE!

Love making these because the recipe is so versatile. I use 1/2 the batter at a time and freeze the rest in a flat patty. Since they don't spread, I put them on a silpat sheet in fairly large balls and flatten them. I turn them over at 20 minutes, and leave em in the oven to dry out a bit. I break the cookies up before storing them in the fridge. My GSD plants herself in front of the fridge as a "hint"  several times a day, for cookies, and these are ones she specially likes.

These were easy to cut into shapes---I made squirrels.  The dough WAS sticky, so I had to flour the parchment paper very well (and repeatedly) to keep it from sticking while I rolled it out and cut it.    I crumbled up little pieces of the bacon into the batter too.

My dogs LOVED these for Christmas!  One of them had to take it off to herself so she could just savor it -she's hilarious.  I added shredded cheddar and crunched up 5 pieces of bacon that I used to get all that grease.  Great easy little treats!!

I modified this recipe as well, by leaving out the salt due to the fact there is salt in the bacon. I also rolled it out in a long log roll then took another basic treat recipe (dog treats l ) and wrapped it around the log and cut into 2 inch pieces. This gives my little terrier both her favorite flavors in one. bone-appetit:)

My German Sheperd, Elias, absolutely went C-R-A-Z-Y for these! He loved them-- or as I say to him, "luffled!" My other dogs would try to steal hs from him and I would have to go get it for him! Now, whenever I make them, I make sure they do something to earn them!

Great recipe! They don't look like much but the doggies I gifted them to at Christmas scarfed them down! Do make the balls smaller than the recipe calls for if you have smaller dogs.

Very easy to make.  All the dogs loved them (not that they are picky).  Will make again & again.  Dipped 1/2 of each cookie in a melted white chocolate mixture.

I made these for my 3 dogs and they gobbled them down fast i gave them to em in portions not all at once so they last.... i added some garlic to keep away fleas.... all  in all my dogs are happy with the biscuits and just want to keep coming back for more.
Did these again same way but no garlic or bacon fat this time instead of the bacon fat i used some canned beef broth i had in the cupboard because i was also making them something else 4/29/18

All I can say is that my dog is addicted to these treats!!! He literally drools for them!! While I was making these he parked himself on the kitchen floor and laid there (im)patiently waiting for these treats to be done! My bf and I were laughing because once he had a taste of one he wouldn't leave us alone! He was attached at our hips trying to get more! I added chicken broth instead of water and pieces of bacon because they had to get used, but other than that left the recipe the same. My dog is an American Bull Dog and about 85 pounds so he had no bathroom problems with these. I have a feeling that my dog won't finish the box of store bought biscuits we had bought for him after having one of these!! Guess I'll just have to keep making more...

I read this recipe while baking a meatloaf.  I thought I'd try the flavorful dripping of a meatloaf instead of bacon.  I did not add water and used dry milk no salt.  I used my small tsp scoop and baked for 20 min.  Perfect and my dogs love them.  Thanks for an easy healthy recipe.

The people that are adding real bacon and steak or chicken fat are killing their dogs! They are not supposed to eat that stuff. Heck, why not add chocolate chips to it??? Then you will really kill your dog. And who can afford to put bacon in it anyway?!  You can add vegetable trimmings to it, just not onions or garlic and no raisins or grapes.
And if you feed TOO MUCH to the dogs.....yes, they will get the runs!!! Everything in moderation!!!

My dogs just love these treats! I'm not a cook but these are so easy to make and store. I added the bacon bits from the grease the second time I made them.  They were a hit! Store them in a air tight container to keep them fresh.

My dog loves my bacon biscuits.  I'm not sure how to rate this since I made more than a few changes: I crumbled & threw in the 16 oz bacon that rendered the fat. Other changes: used 3c ww flour + 1c quick cook oats + 1/2c flax seed + 1/2c wheat germ, used 3 eggs, used 1/2 c milk + 1 cup low sodium broth, eliminated salt.

I found it less tedious to flatten out dough to 1/4" and use a shot glass to cut out the biscuits. Baked 20 min on 2 cookie sheets, rotated 180 degrees and switched top and bottom cookie sheets and baked 10 minutes more. I made original recipe once and my recipe 3x. My recipe: if they're in my pocket, my dog will nose in and try to steal some!

My dogs absolutely LOVE these treats. I have made a variety of slight adjustments like using broth I had lying around instead of milk or adding some cornmeal or oats when my whole wheat flour ran short and they still go crazy for them.

Easy enough to make, but yes, I tasted them, and they were very bland. My dogs are eating them, but they aren't doing any dances for them. lol I think next time I make them I will use honey & peanut butter instead of bacon grease and taste the dough before baking so I can tweak as needed. I ended up with about 70 biscuits that I cut out with a cookie cutter. Makes a nice amount & its fairly easy. Just needs to be a bit tastier.

I've made these cookies several times now, as written and with several different variations.  We're not bacon eaters, so I cooked up some turkey bacon, chopped up and added 1 c bacon bits, like you would chocolate chips.  In the cases where I didn't use bacon grease (from local diner) I subbed 1/4 c vegetable oil.  If I didn't use bacon, I have subbed 1c of cooked sweet potato(they LOVED it! who knew?) or 1c cheddar cheese (all but the pickiest liked this variation) 1c cooked leftover salmon. In all cases, I omitted the salt and added 1t baking powder.  Will make again and again!

I made two different versions of this recipe.  The first was bacon and cheddar.  Followed the recipe except I didn't have enough bacon grease so made up the difference with coconut oil and added about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese powder.  My pups loved these.  Second version was peanut butter and honey.  Added 1 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of honey.  Baked first batch 29 minutes and second batch 25 minutes.  Going to give these treats to all my favorite pups for Christmas!!!

The dogs luv these! I had only 5 Tb bacon grease so i substituted 5 Tb grapeseed oil for the rest. I also substituted yogurt for the milk and water. Next time, i might try what another reviewer suggested--eliminating the eggs and milk and using baking powder instead.

Added 3/4 cup bacon grease and 1/2 c cottage cheese.
I have large breeds dogs and these were meant to be "snack treats" so I used a large cookie scoop and flattened them like large thick "cookies" before they went into the oven. 
My cooking time was 50 min at 350.

Very user friendly dough. No extra flour required. I used chicken broth instead of water. Dogs were going crazy before they were out of the oven. Definitely a keeper

my very picky dog really loves these. I'm happy to have that bacon flavor in it. I used cookie cutters but this recipe is best for forming something like a buscuit as it is doughy.

One little change-I also baste the biscuits after I take them out of the oven (if I have any bacon fat left!).  Dogs go crazy for these treats-I make them whenever I make bacon and give them to friends. I don't even have a dog but it's fun to see how the dogs I give them to react to this tasty treat

My dogs love these treats. I made 1/2 with just bacon fat and bacon bits from 2 pieces of bacon and the other 1/2 I added peanut butter. They love them both. I used white flour.

Even though the ingredients were people friendly- I didn’t try it, but our 3 dogs gave it a 4-Paw review! This recipe makes a hard treat that seems to help with keeping their teeth clean! When our pups smell them baking they start drooling because they know they are in for a treat! Thank you for sharing this recipe and cutting our treat budget to a small fraction of what we have been spending!

I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, chicken broth instead of water and a cup of rolled oats for 1 cup of flour. Easy recipe to use up bacon fat. I tasted one and it tasted similar to a big pretzel.

Good basic biscuit recipe.  Make as is or substitute white flour, rice flour, oats/oat flour, and/or potato flour for some of the white flour.  I used a combination of 3 different kinds.  You can use peanut butter as a substitute for all or part of the bacon fat, and applesauce for all or part of the milk.  I used a spoon to flatten somewhat before baking, flipped them after bake time & baked them 3-4 minutes longer to make sure they were dry & crunchy.  Our dog "Bruiser" loves them!

I used 3 c whole wheat flour, 1 c rolled oats and 1 c ground spent grain leftover from homebrewing. I used 3 eggs, threw in a small handful of shredded cheese and a little olive oil also. 
I rolled and cut it with small round cookie cutters about quarter sized for my pomeranians and about 2.5 inches in diameter for my labs.  The poms are doing tricks wanting more after having one!

I have been making these treats for my dogs well over a year now.  They adore these treats.  The only thing that I think many may forget is to keep them refrigerated.  My doggies give this recipe five paws! :)

I love making treats and birthday cakes for my dogs because I know exactly what goes into them. Bacon fat and other fats (chicken skin, etc.) are good to keep their coats moisturized. However, 10 tablespoons of bacon fat is too much for only 25 biscuits made. It can cause a lot of diseases which are fatal. I work in an Animal Shelter, so to keep the dogs safe I took it down to 5 tablespoons of bacon fat. Dogs loved it just the same and it's better for their health! Other than the excessive bacon fat, turned out great.

I added shredded cheese to this recipe and my dogs loved it!  Even my picky eater loves them. These are so much better than store bought where the ingredients can be questionable.

Was a big hit here. I did substitute two cups of wheat flour for a cup of ground flax seed and and some wheat germ. Rolled them out and cut into bone size treats.
