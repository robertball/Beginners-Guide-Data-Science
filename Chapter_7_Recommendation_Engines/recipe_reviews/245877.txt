Made it for a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was delicious.  Everyone likes coconut so I added about 1/4 cup of flake coconut.   Also added an extra 1/2 cup of Jerk marinade.  Served it over Jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk.  Side dishes of plantains cooked in brown sugar and butter and pineapple coleslaw.  A real Caribbean feast.  Next time I would use pineapple tidbits instead of pineapple chunks.

I didn't make it but I am writing in the hopes others did and can help me even though 17 people made it, nobody has reviewed. Maybe they had the same problem. It calls for Jerk seasoning but nowhere does it say what that is...what spices. And it also calls for jerk marinade. Again, what is in it? I even watched the video but nothing was mentioned. Can anyone help?

This was delicious.  In order to reduce the heat, I used 1/8 cup of jerk marinade and 3/8 cup of teriyaki marinade.  Next time I would add some broccoli or bok Choy for a one dish dinner.

I was pleasantly surprised how these flavors came together. I have to admit I was a bit nervous that the family wouldn't like it. But they loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and no changes are necessary. I used "hot" green chiles for a little bit of a kick.   The Jamaican jerk seasoning was in the spice area of the grocery store and the jerk marinade was near the bbq sauces. Took time to find them because only one company offered them.

My family loved this dish and it will be put into our "rotation" of dinners. I was afraid it would be too spicy for me - but I found that the flavors were delicious...esp the pineapple. Even better the next day, I guess the pineapple soaked up more of the flavor! A total hit at our house

This meal was fantastic! I didn't change anything. I'm usually one for tweeking recipes to my family's  preferences but this was perfect as is.  It does have some heat to it which we enjoyed but I would keep that in mind if you're family isn't a fan of heat.

Doubled the recipe. Chose pineapple in natural juice instead, which made the recipe sweet enough.  If your family does not like beans, you can put them on the side.  I could not find Jerk seasoning, so I googled it and made my own. I did find a marinade at the store, which I used and was ok.. It is "jerk chicken" so make sure that your guest like Jerk before making..

I liked it a lot, but I got mixed reviews from my family.  I think the ratio of beans to chicken was slightly off, so the consistency felt more like a chili.

I used spicy Jamaican seasoning and marinade, along with spicy green chilis. I found it to be very spicy (my fault) and I also cut up 3 bell peppers with it. I found 3 bell peppers made the pan overflow and would recommend if anyone wanted to add additional peppers to only use 1 pepper! Other than that, the dish was very tasty and I served it over jasmine rice!

I made this nearly just as written, and loved it!  The only thing I did differently was include more jerk seasoning in the chicken rub, which made it spicier, which I like. I couldn't find jerk seasoning at the store, so I made my own based on an online recipe, and it turned out great.

Used Lowry,s Jerk marinade this time and grocery brand before. (I asked the butcher & he found it for me.) skipped the rice but added some corn. Didnâ€™t have black beans so used black eyed peas. Sort of like fusion Jamaican Hoppin Johns. D lish.

It seemed like a heavy dish. My sauce was pretty thick and I wasn't wild about the black beans.

This dish was amazing. Exactly what I was looking for. Not to hot and just the right sweetness. I made it exactly as the recipe . Personally I would not change a thing.

This is a great recipe, and pretty simple and quick to make. A couple of things I did differently: I used 2 lb. of chicken and double the oil, just because I like more meat. I didn't bother to measure the jerk seasoning, I just dusted the raw chicken liberally with it before cooking - I'm sure it was more than the recipe called for. Fresh pineapple was available, so I used it instead. The good thing about that is we had pineapple chunks left over to pick on while it cooked. 

As a side dish, I made sliced plantains dredged in flour, brown sugar, and a pinch of nutmeg (no recipe, just winged it) that I fried up in melted butter. Salt them when you pull them out, and you're good. 

This meal goes nicely with a Dark & Stormy (what doesn't?).

I loved it but my boyfriend thought it was fair and the chicken needed more flavor. Maybe it's because I didn't marinate the chicken long enough.  I could not find Jerk Sauce at the store so used some pepper sauce instead. I also added coconut milk to the rice which made it amazing as well as coconut flakes on top.  I bet it will be better today when I have it for lunch.

An excellent combination of sweet and spicy!  I thought I might like the combination of ingredients, but was surprised how much.  I didn't use any rub as all I had was Caribbean Jerk marinade sauce.  It still turned out great!

I found it to taste mostly of hot spice.  Flat tasting and too much liquid.  I won't make it again.

We really enjoyed the flavour change from our typical food flavours.  I did go extremely lighter on the peppers which just cut down the heat, not the taste.  I will make this again.

I'm in the same boat as Chef Cosmo. I want to make it but I have never heard of Jerk Marinade. Is there a recipe for it on the site. Or is it  something I can purchase, and where. Thx.

The flavors were great together in this recipe.  As for heat, it's about at the max of where I like it, but for some people it'll be not enough.  I adjusted the jerk seasoning to dial it up or down.

I used Grace's Jamaican jerk seasoning instead of jerk marinade. It was too hot even though I only used 2 tbsp. I guess it's not the same as the marinade, but it was very good.

I used jerk seasoning I had on hand that I had bought from Whole Foods which was delicious!  I had a hard time finding the jerk marinade, but found something with similar flavors that I used. It all worked in the end and both my husband and I loved it! Will definitely be making this again.
