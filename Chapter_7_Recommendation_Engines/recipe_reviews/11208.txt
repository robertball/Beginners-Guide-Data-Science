From all the previos reviews, I can see that people have a problem with the batter being runny. I had the same problem, so next time I will put the batter in the fridge for a bit before baking them b/c it is more of a liquidy consistency, and chilling it will make it easier to roll into balls. This cookie is so great b/c it is soft, but not cakey. I slightly overcooked two batches, but they are still pretty soft. It tastes like a chocolate chip cookie is supposed to taste. You got to try it, so chill it, if you chill it, it will be easier to get it on the pan, and also not flatten out so fast. this is a chewy cookie recipe, and alton brown even said for chewie cookies, chill them, it helps the cooking process for this kind of cookie recipe, and this mix has a great taste.

These babies are DELIGHTFUL - so soft and melt-in-your mouth, they disappeared in an instant in my house.  I can't recommend them more!

I found the these cookies so tasty! I did not find it runny, I actually added milk!  My recipe, very similar  1 stick butter 3/4 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup white sugar 1 tbsp milk 2 tsp vanilla 2 eggs  whisked together by hand.  Then add 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour 1 tsp baking soda Added another tbsp milk. Stirred together by wooden spoon.   Then add 2 cups choc chips  I also added 1/2cup mini marshmellows to give this a goosy texture!  It came out heavenly!  350 degree at 12 minutes

I tried this recipe tonight, the taste is great! They were easy to make but they are so thin. I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the directions, but they are more like twille cookies, than chocolate chip cookies. I'm going t try chilling the dough first next time.

When I made these cookies, the dough was very very dry. I suspect it may have something to do with not having US-sized cups here in the UK. So I just added an egg (and a touch more flour) and voila! Perfect cookie dough!
Also, I used ~300g of Galaxy chocolate. Very creamy taste!

these were very good tasting,but it called for a tad to much chips, and the dough tended to run into really big cookies and then they stuck to the pan. i even tryed to spray the pan first to
stop them from sticking, but no such luck

I just pulled them out of the oven and there really flat but look pretty yummy and smell SOOO good. I added a bit more flour to my next batch and I chilled the first a bit. Over all it worked so I like it! I wish they would look like the pic!!!

This recipe was awesome.. I had no trouble with it being runny, and it didn't stick to my pan because i put it on parchment paper..  the only thing was that i came out brown because teh chocolate chips started to melt when I mixed with the butter..but it didn't affect teh taste and they are really good..

I could NOT stay out of this batter!! It is super yummy tasting, but when I tried to make cookies out of it, they flattened and ran together. (I did chill the dough first.) I made another batch, but put them in a pan for pan cookies, and they are delish!

There is not enough flour in this recipe...The cookies dough was runny and the cookies were flat. I added another cup of flour making it 2 1/2 cups and then they were fluffy.

This was the first time I didn't read the reviews for a recipe before I made it because I didn't have time and I thought, "how hard can a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe be to make?"  I made a huge mistake.  If I had read the reviews about how thin and runny they were I would have picked another recipe, and I SHOULD have!!!  I they stuck all over the pan and they tasted good, but the end result was frustrating and I won't make them again.  I have half a bowl of batter left that I am dreading to make tomorrow.

Yummy, Yummy.  I took the suggestion of letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours, and added about 1 1/2 cups of flour....They're wonderful!

Those cookies in the picture look a lot better than how mine turned out - very flat and kind of gooey.  I think it might just need more flour.

Absolutly great taste, problem with dough running while baking. I think a little extra flour is needed for this recipe. It certainly is a recipe to experiment with to improve end results.

I used this recipe, leaving out the vanilla and using self-rising flour instead of flour, baking soda, and salt. The batter was not terribly thick, and the ratio of chips to batter was high.  Maybe adding a bit more flour would help. I decided to just spread the whole mess over an 11"x17"x1/2" cookie pan and made bars. Cook time was about 15 minutes at 350*F, and they were still a little gooey.  They are just delicious, though.  I'm going to stick them in the fridge and see how they are when they're cooled off.

They taste alright once you get them peeled off the cookie sheet.  Tried chilling them but that didn't really seem to help.  I won't be making these again.

LOVE this recipe! I followed the ingredients, but used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, added some Reese peanut butter chips and added 1/2 cup more flour than asked for. I also found that the dough is easier to work with if chilled before dropping onto the cookie sheet. The results were fantastic!! Will definitely make these again!

I am not sure what happened! I made this recipe and the cookies were flat. I think there is not enough baking soda or something. My 4 year old son asked what was wrong with them. They stuck to my all clad non stick cookie sheet. I still have 3/4 of the dough left. I really do not want to waste it so I will bake them. The kids will eat them, but I cannot, they are kind of chewy and get stuck in my my teeth, like I am eat caramel or something. I will not be making this recipe again.

Mine also ran all over the pan at first. I tried to chill the batter for 10 minutes, and it didn't help. I added more flour and they turned out okay.

I've made these many times and they are easy, delicious and consistently good.  Don't cheap out and use margarine (nasty stuff, that is.)  Even high school students can't mess these up!

This cookie has a different texture and taste with the melted butter. I added some coconut and almond meal which adds some texture and flavor as well. Overall - it's quick but not sure it's the best, so I'm still searching for the best recipe!

I had the same problem with the thin cookies and running into each other.  I thought it was because of over-mixing them.  I added more flour to the mixure and they turned out ok, but not as good as the kids usually like.  Probably won't use this one again. Sorry...

Had same problem as previous reviewer, they ran over the whole pan. Tried them still, strange texture.
