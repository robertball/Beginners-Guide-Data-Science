Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I made another similar recipe to this one on the same night except the other called for steaming the cauliflower. I actually preferred the one with the steamed cauliflower better but hubs preferred this one so there you have it. We both agreed we would have liked a little bit of heat so next time I'll add a diced jalapeno.
