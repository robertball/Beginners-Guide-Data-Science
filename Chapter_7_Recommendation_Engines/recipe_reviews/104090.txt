I can't believe no one has rated these yet.  These are really good onion rings if you like slightly sweet batters.  I was worried the batter wouldn't stick, so I made sure to coat them really well with flour before dipping in the batter.  This made it stay on the onion rings really well during frying.  I found I only had to bake them in the oven for a few minutes on each side, otherwise they would start to get a bit burnt.  My family loved them and they disappeared very quickly.  I think this batter may go well with other things too.  I am going to use the leftover batter on some shrimp.  Thanks for a great recipe.
