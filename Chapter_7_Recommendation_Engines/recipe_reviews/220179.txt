This was quite good. I left out the bacon to cut calories and replaced the can of water with more chicken broth to up the flavor. Came out delicious. Do make the garnish and use either sour cream or yogurt to top it off. Black beans are so healthy so any way to incorporate them into your diet is a winner - if it's tasty too than all the better!

I am really surprised that no one has mentioned the use of an immersion blender for this recipe.  If you don't have one of these handy "stick" blenders, I strongly suggest you invest in one.  It's much easier to use and clean than a regular blender for this type of application.  You can control how thick you want the soup to be by the amount of time you blend the soup, and you do it right in the same pot!  What could be easier than that?

subbed basil for oregano and simmered an hour to thicken and blend flavors. Cheated and used blender. Awesome flavor! Loved this - will make again for sure.

Best Black Bean soup I've ever had!  BONUS:  I made it!  :)  I used low sodium beans, but followed the recipe exactly and the result was perfection!  I didn't even make the relish, but I did use sour cream.  It was a big hit with the hubby too.

I followed the core recipe, except I made a couple adjustments. I cut down to two pieces of bacon, used a little olive oil, added a green pepper with the onion, 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 2, 1 can of water, 2 garlic cloves instead of 3, immersion blender (as mentioned in another review), and as little corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit. AMAZING. A little bit of rice in the bowl then added the soup....delicious! Next time, I will take out 1/2 or 1/3 the beans before I use the immersion blender, then replace the beans into the soup puree. That way there's a little more bean texture. Great recipe nonetheless

Really good!  I have a always relied on a wonderful recipe from a Seattle restaurant (Cafe Sport -- now gone), but it took a better part of a day to make.  This is just as flavorful and easy to make for a weeknight dinner.

I made the recipe as written and added a large diced carrot for color.  I used an emersion blender and cooked it down to a thicker consistency, so it made about 2 large bowls worth.

Thanks for the recipe.

Just tried this recipe.  Is it just me, or would this be EPIC with some grated cheddar on top?  Just an idea.  Also, I think the soup will taste good no matter what, but would probably look "prettier" if it was blended/pureed a bit if you're willing to take the extra time.  All in all, a scrumptious hearty soup!  Also, I think because of the bacon it doesn't need a lot of extra salt-- just be wary with that shaking hand!

About to make this exactly as written for the third time...(triple the recipe this time for freezer). In addition to the wonderful garnishes, I put fresh slices of avocado on top in a pinwheel shape...simply fabulous!

EDITED to add: I have tried a potato masher, then an immersion blender. The masher works a lot better as it doesn't pulverize the bacon. I make this a lot!! Thanks Chef John!!

This is so good, I'm not even done with it and I have to come give it a good review! Don't change anything about it, it is perfect. I didn't have red chili or sambal but I did have red curry paste which had red chili peppers in it. I used it for the relish and I can't imagine the dish without these flavors.

Wow.  I must be the only person who had problems with this recipe.  It was runny, couldn't thicken it no matter how much I smashed.  tried the blender, that helped some, but messed with the texture.  What struck me the most is this was not "black" at all.  more like beige.  taste was bland.  had to add a can of black bean mole to spruce it up some.  I was kind of grossed out about the bacon fat.  it was overwhelming.  What did I do wrong?

Super good!  I also didn't add the bacon since I am vegan, but I added a half can of mild rotel (diced tomatoes/green chilis).  I followed everything else just as is and it was so good!  will make this regularly thanks so much for the great staple recipe!

Gotta rate this five stars.  Ate two bowls of this soup so far.  First bowl of soup was without the sour cream and garnish, since I wanted to know what the soup tasted like without any enhancements.  First bowl was tasty.

Ate second bowl a day later.  Topped this with the sour cream and garnish.  Second bowl was even tastier than the first.  Soup flavor intensified over the course of one day.  Sour cream and garnish also added flavor, though my pallet would have preferred a little less
lime juice.

When making this soup, the bacon that I used was pretty fatty.  Because of this, after soup was finished simmering, I fished most of the bacon out of the soup, then cut away most of the fat, then readded the bacon (with fat gone) back into the soup.

Can't wait to make this soup for guests!  Thanks Chef John.

This was delicious!! And easy! My 5-year-old son made the soup - with a little help. We didn't have bacon so started with a few mini-pepperonis (which I don't think added much to the flavor). And we just used what we had on hand for the topping - sour cream and feta cheese - served with tortilla chips. My whole family loved this - even my 14-month old son. My 5-year-old (who made it) said it was the best meal he's ever eaten - even better than french fries :) Next time we will have to double or triple the recipe - my husband asked if we could go make another batch even before he finished his first bowl!

I have to admit... I didn't have Sambal Paste, so I used Chili Garlic Sauce. Still, this was one of my Mom's favorite lunches! Hubby and I also enjoyed. I garnished with green onions and nobody asked for sour cream here. Thanks Chef John... a recipe we can all agree on gets a 5*~

This recipe is scrumptious. I crisped the bacon and removed it to use as a topping and sauteed the onions in the residual oil, I also used turkey bacon. I wasn't too fond of the bacon being cooked in it. I also added a can of rotel tomatoes and instead of the garnish I topped it with greek yogurt, cheese, red onion (out of green), and the bacon that I sauteed. It was very good even with my substitutions. Family loved it.

Hello John, I am so glad to see this recipe I had it everyday in San Jan Puerto Rico many years ago so I will top it with the sour cream, more chopped onion and a great salad on the side like they did, Thank you, Charlie

Made this for the first time for me and my hubby. All I can say is it was not enough!  Served with a salad it is a light healthy meal and quite filling.  I was so impressed, I made it again for my friend. She loved it! Now, I'm having a dinner party Saturday, and guess what, menu is chicken and steak fajitas with black bean soup! Good enough for company. Made exactly as written. Served with sour cream, green onions and fresh cilantro.

This is delicious!  I wiped away the bacon grease after cooking the bacon and before adding other ingredients (personal preference).  I did not make the relish.

I opened up the AR page today and saw this on the home page.  This was perfect for tonight there wasn't a single complaint and the soup pot was left empty to the drop.  I used a cup more chicken broth subbed for a cup of water.  Also, I didn't have any red chili peppers, so I improvised with a minced sweet red bell pepper and a half teaspoon of Penzey's Medium Hot Chili Powder.  I also used turkey bacon instead of the pork bacon, but I doubt it was as good as it could have been with the real deal.  I served it with a some tortilla chips on the side, but had also considered corn bread as well.  From what I can tell, Chef John had this one spot on and if I had had the exact ingredients, I would have stuck to it.  I'm the type of person that uses recipes as suggestions, so this says a lot.  Eat this soup. Enjoy this soup!

Prepared exactly as written.  Very flavorful, simple and will be preparing again. The relish does add a mild spicy element that gives this soup that extra layer of flavor which I happened to like.  My husband tried the soup without the relish, and then with the relish.  He liked both helpings, but preferred not using the relish and getting the "true" black bean soup taste without that extra spicy flavor.  So you decide, ...spice or no spice!  Either way, it's all good!

This soup was very good.  I started with a smoked ham hock, added cilantro and cubed canadian bacon.  I also mashed 2 cans of drained black beans.  I also put a few drops of liquid smoke.   It did not need these, it just enhanced the flavor.

The flavor in this soup surprised me for the ease. I made 1/2 recipe to try it and it did yield the suggested servings. I dislike cooking bacon, so I just used 1-2 tsp of real bacon bits sauteed in some olive oil. I left out the cayenne, because I dont care for it in most recipes along with just a sprinkle of black pepper. I mixed my broth from reduced sodium vegetable paste. To save time I boiled it 5 minutes, then let it sit 2-3 minutes. I realized I forgot the water. I ended up only adding 1/2 of it at the end. I didnt want the soup to thin by that point. We topped with sour cream, chili paste, and a little 4 blend cheddar.

Wow wow wow!!!  This was awesome!  I doubled the recipe but didn't double the bacon (I just didn't have it).  I substituted chix broth for the water (so used 4 cans broth for a double recipe, and no water). I used low sodium beans.  The bacon was unappealingly floating around so I used the immersion blender instead of a masher, and I made it quite smooth.  I didn't make the relish but I did serve it with green onions and a big dollop of plain Greek yogurt.  I can't believe how delicious this soup was!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!!

It took me a while to find the red chili paste, but I'm glad I did. It really made a difference to the final product. Hubby and I will have this again... and again.

Easy and yummy! I did add another can of black beans, plus one small can of diced green chilis as well as some fresh chopped cilantro at my hubby's request. I also pureed about 1/3 of the soup mixture instead of mashing (I have a bad wrist).
Finished it off with cilantro, tomoato and green onion relish and delish! Thanks Chef John!

My husband-who is NOT a soup guy- asked me to add this to the family recipe collection. We loved it! Finished it all in one sitting:) And so easy to make..it's a very forgiving recipe. I only had one can of beans but it still turned out, looking forward to making it again. New favorite!

I am a very picky eater, and have been learning to cook new foods lately... I cut down the cumin to a fourth of a teaspoon, and afterwards was glad about it. My sour cream had spoiled, so I just added shredded cheddar cheese on top. The soup was easy to make, and it was good too. The only problem that I had with it, was it being a really thin soup... Otherwise, I liked it! This was a good recipe for a junior chef!

I made this soup and it was delicious.  I added in a few diced carrots and used Chicken Stock instead of water.  I used fresh Sage and Oregano from my garden --approx 3 T Oregano and 1 T Sage -- a pinch of cumin, salt and pepper to taste.   I cooked it overnight in Slow Cooker and in the morning I mashed the beans and carrots with a potato masher and served the soup at noon to a friend I'd invited for lunch.  I served Corn Bread and fresh-made Raspberry jam with the soup.  I'd make it again.  My friend liked the soup a lot.

I’ve made this a few times now, and doubled the recipe this time because I love it so much and like to freeze it in portions for lunches. The only change I made with the seasoning is to use Herb de Province instead of Orgeano. I did not double the bacon, however-I used six slices of quality bacon from the butcher. I also scooped out most beans and puréed in my manual food processor.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made it with black beans the first time and the second I used black soybeans because they are low carb and my bf loves this soup. However for me I need more spice within the soup instead of on the garnish. He loves garlic chili sauce, green onions and limes so this soup was right up his ally. The bacon didn't flavor it enough for me so I opted to throw a smoked ham bone so it cooked in the soup and it was even meatier. Thank you for the recipe. Its a keeper!

I actually made this from scratch. I had dried black beans & cooked in my Instant Pot. The only garnish I had on hand was sour cream & green onions and it was very tasty.  Another great recipe from Chef John.

This recipe is delicious!!
I added a bell pepper, a red pepper, and 2 onions rather than 1, and it added a great amount of flavor!! I also added a 3rd can of black beans.
Instead of making a relish, I mixed the lime juice and the Sambal Paste together and added that into the soup when I put in the water. 
Also, I diced and crisped up some bacon on the side to add on top of the soup, along with sour cream and avocado on the side to add in as well. 
Everyone came back for more and it was gone  by the end of the evening! lol. This is my new favorite recipe to cook, and to eat - for sure!! 
Thank you for this delicious recipe!!!!! A++++++

Truly was tasty and easy and everyone loved it. I did not have canned beans but used dried which I soaked overnight. Increased the cook time to compensate for the dried beans. Will  definitely make again!

I added another can of beans to make it a little thicker and instead of the bacon, I used ground turkey. I ended up doubling the simmer time. It turned out  delicious! I also added fresh chopped tomato on top instead of the garnish. Definitely a keeper.

I used this as a starting point.  2 onions, 3 carrots. 3 garlic, 2 stalks celery, 1/2 pack bacon (I cut off the large fat sections at the end of the bacon), 4 cans lack beans, same other stuff.  Blended with an  immersion blender.  My kids love it, even with all the vegetables, suckers...

This is my go to base recipe for black bean soup.  I can't eat bacon so often I'll replace it with browned ground beef for an excellent black bean chili.  I always add a can or two of diced tomatoes.  If I've got a fire roasted on hand it adds a real nice twist.  Always get rave reviews, even without the bacon.

I have been craving a good black bean soup for months.  This recipe is a keeper!  It really hit the spot!  I loved the relish it was a perfect blend of citrus and spicy.  The sour cream softened the heat and the flavors in the soup just meld together perfectly!

Excellent and very easy!  Some things to consider: make the bacon crispier than I did as it is not pleasant to eat the chewy fat.  Also, do not be worried about the order of the spices as they blend well no matter if you get confused like I did.  I used onion powder instead of an onion.  This soup is so good and I am pleased that I will have a protein packed lunch from it!

I was determined to make soup on this rainy, dismal day despite not having a lot of ingredients on hand.  This soup really hit the spot!  I made only two substitutions (ham for bacon, and caraway seeds for cumin) and one omission (no cayenne on hand).  Perhaps I overmashed the beans, but it got very thick, and I had to use the whole quart of chicken stock in addition to the 14.5 ounces of water. No problem.  Bottom line is ... easy, quick and very delicious!  P.S.  I didn't use the relish or garnish.  I don't think it needs either one.

all I can say is OMG. But... I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chick peas. I also hit it with some red pepper flakes.  This recipe is very versatile. I can see adding cooked italian sausage to this instead of bacon.

This is very good and easy to make. I used all chicken broth and no water, it was way too salty so I added water and it was great. I also added some pepper sauce at the end. I will be making this again.

This was very good - I did make some edits, however. I cooked the bacon all the way until crispy, drained it in a metal mesh sieve, then returned some of the drained bacon fat to the pan - that way I could save the crunchy bacon to garnish the top, which was nice texture contrast. I also replaced one can of beans with refried black beans and didn't need to bother mashing up the beans. Will definitely make again - paired nicely with a spicy cheese bread.

Soaked black beans overnight instead of using canned beans. Added more onion and celery, plus a carrot.

Fantastic!  Got approval from my son and husband. I didn’t have any cumin but I threw in some taco spice instead. Used some Better Than Bullion to add more flavor to the plain water. Didn’t use the relish but I had the chopped green onions and cheese. Yummy!

I love Chef John  recipes but as a seasoned cook (pun intended) no matter how hard I try I always manage to put my own spin on it so often ends up being a solid guideline. In any event, for this recipe I followed it but  doubled it and used an entire pound of WELL TRIMMED bacon, degreased the pan sans a tablespoon or so of drippings then added carrots and celery sauteed with the onion. Beside the oregano (great addition CJ - TY!) a tablespoon worchestershire and lime juice. Used homemade chicken broth throughout (i,e., no water), added a can of  refried black beans and then 3 cans rinsed whole black beans. This worked well rather than mashing them in the pot. Topped it with a mix of sliced green onion and jalapenos, shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream. Thankfully to rave reviews. Thank you Chef John !!

This was a really delicious black bean soup.  I made it as written with the relish and all.  In the future I will do away with the relish.  It ended up being SUPER spicy with that.

Didn't  love  it. This recipe is not like the black bean soup I'm accustomed to;  it was way too thin and I didn't even add the 14 oz of water the recipe calls for! I blended 1/2 the beans and thickened with cornstarch like another reviewer mentioned. Flavor was ok, but too smoky from the bacon and I only added 5 slices. I suppose it wouldn't taste so strong with the extra water but that might dilute the other flavors.

My family loved this.. made it exactly as written.  Next time I would not add any extra salt and I would trim as much of the fat off the bacon after I cooked it.    I used an immersion blender.  It was excellent.

Will absolutely use this recipe over and over. I trebled the Cayenne (I do enjoy heat) and felt a third can of black beans helped , but this is delicious soup, hearty enough for Dinner on a cold night!

Good and simple dish. I made a couple of adjustments: doubled the beans and spices, added sweet paprika for the colour; all in all will make again.

Excellent. Will definitely make again. I followed a suggestion in the reviews and used three cups of broth (made from bouillon) instead of water. I also added some lime juice and fresh tomatoes at the end. Has a nice hearty flavor. I'm happy to have found a delicious recipe high in protein, iron, and other nutrients.

This was SO VERY DELICIOUS!  Used the recommended amount of chicken broth, but didn't use the recommended amount of water (at most I only added about 1/4 cup of water).  Made the relish with green onion & red chilies, no lime, and in my opinion, soup is just fine without the relish.  You won't  be sorry you made this one!!

We made this recipe as written and it was fantastic! The only thing is its not really four servings. My husband and I each had a bowl, and then there was only one bowl's worth left over. When I make it again, I'll double the recipe so we'll have more leftovers. Overall, a wonderful dish.

I changed a few things. I added a can of Rotel and left out the cayenne pepper.  This added some tomatoes and chilies to brighten up the soup and give it more texture. The other thing about using Rotel is they offer 3 different types based on heat so you can adjust the heat on the soup depending on which type you use (mild, original, or hot).

Don't forget the garnish!
There are similar recipes on this site and this recipe was very good.
But what really made my taste buds sit up and yell in ecstacy was the garnish of lime juice, sour cream, chopped onion and some asian 'chile garlic sauce'.  
Marvellous!  Really very well done!

Chef John, you did it again!  Great recipe!  I have never done well with cooking dry beans and always used canned (I'm an inherently inpatient person!).  Made this soup for company following the recipe almost exactly...almost!   I used chicken broth for the water and have to admit, I did what one other reviewer did and fished out the bacon after starting to simmer the soup.  The bacon wasn't cooked well enough, or maybe I used cheap bacon, or maybe I didn't dice it small enough,  but I had to fish out the bacon with a slotted spoon and just pick out the meaty bits and put them back in the soup.   I just couldn't stand the thought of chewy bacon fat in my soup.  That being said and done, the soup was superb!  My guests LOVED it and ate it all up.  Oh, I didn't make the relish either.  Some added a dollop of sour cream , others some cilantro.  Whatever you add, it was really good.  I will definitely make this again soon but crisp my bacon or do what I did this time.  The bacon definitely gives it a great flavor so I won't leave it out.  Simple, easy, good and yummy!

Loved this! Recommended by a friend, just substituted the chicken stock with vegetable stock and no bacon for a vegetarian variety. It’s a bit difficult to mash the beans, so I found it easier to blend half of the mixture and add it back to the pot while cooking.

This right here is delicious! The title to this recipe is right on the dime. I substituted the sambal paste with sriracha because I couldn't find it at my local supermarket and I didn't have chicken broth so I used 2 cups of water with 1 cube of chicken bouillon. I will be definitely making this again. Thank you Chef John!!

Okay.  First I will say this did not turn out fantastic for me. It came out very very thick and not incredibly flavourful.  As others have said it was very flavourful I wonder if I did something wrong.  Next time I am going to add more garlic and way more spice.  I served it over rice with taco chips.  It was not terrible but I will only try it again with a massive boost.

I omitted the bacon and used homemade vegetable stock. This soup was perfect even though today is  the unofficial start of summer. I imagine it would be good for any time of year.

Yeah, this was awesome. Great flavor and texture.  I served basic quesadillas on the side and my family basically licked the pot clean. It takes a little longer to cook than described, but the extra time is forgiven over the first spoon.

I made this, but did not have bacon.  I had a ham bone and left over ham so I used that instead.  It was good and had a smokey flavor.  I had a avacado, green onion and lime so i topped the soup off with that.

OMG, this is absolutely heavenly and soooo easy!  I happened to have made black beans from scratch that were in my freezer, about 4 cups, so I used those instead of canned (after defrosting of course). But, I'll try it again with the canned beans since it will be so much easier. Also, I didn't have samba paste so I used a couple of cherry peppers for the relish which turned out great.  Agree, the relish and sour cream added a perfect contrast to the soup.  Thanks once again Chef John for another fantastic recipe!

Made this tonight to stick with weight-watchers and it was super tasty! Only used 3 slices of bacon but followed rest of recipe exactly. Hubby had thirds! I still have some leftover and can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't make it exactly as written but it was really good. 

1. I always used reduced sodium chicken broth. Why not?
2. I didn't have all of the spices. I did use cumin and minced garlic though. 
3. I pureed one can of beans before adding it, rather than smashing them later.

I'll definitely make this again. At least one kid liked it enough to go for seconds.

Definitely quick and easy.  Very flavorful, especially if you increase the spices a bit.  I also added a can of Rotel.  I think that added a lot of extra flavor.  Love the green onions and sour cream addition before serving.

I feel bad only leaving 3 stars because I usually really like Chef John's recipes, but this didn't have enough spice or flavor for me. I left out the cayenne because my kids don't like it, but I substituted ancho chili powder, which has it's own heat and flavor. Once the soup was done and I taste tested it, I ended up adding more spices because it was blah. With additional spices, I liked it quite a bit, and it was even better the next day.

This was great!!! Made a few small changes based on other reviews. Added a can of Rotel mild tomatoes with green chiles. Also cooked bacon in oven before adding it to pot. Worked out well, as there was not as much bacon fat as others complained. 
Used an immersion blender to blend soup in pot. Added cilantro, sour cream, bacon and chunky salsa as toppings. Would be great with some cheddar cheese and onions on top. Husband even commented on how good it was. High praise coming from him, as he does not like black beans. Will definitely make again.Update: March 2017. 
Made this again with original recipe. Was very good..husband liked it better this way, since it wasn't as spicy. Either way, you can't go wrong.

Based on other reviews I trimmed some fat off the bacon before cooking and I also replaced the water with chicken broth. We thought it was very good and I will definitely will make again.

This soup is delicious, I've made it several times. My sister begs for it every time I have her over. The only changes since following the recipe exactly the first time is, I cook the bacon, set aside, cook the onion & garlic in the bacon fat, drain the fat, and use my blender versus potato masher . I have to double the relish because it's sooo popular, and for the garnish, I cut up avocado, have sour cream, and chop up that cooked bacon. Thanks Chef John!

This soup was delicious! I would definitely cut down the amount of bacon next time. The flavor was delicious but I felt like there was too much bacon in each bite.

I followed the recipe but found I needed to use an immersion blender, which blended the soup much better than the potato masher. The beans stayed whole and I prefer the blended version with just a couple beans left whole. Garnished with sour cream. 
Enjoyed it very much!

I love this recipe and so does my entire family.  I did change a few thing.. I added a can or RoTel (HOT green chilies and tomatoes). I reserve some bacon and add it about 20 minutes before serving.  I also use a blender and some re-fried black beans to thicken it up.  garnish with parmigiana cheese, sour cream and cilantro as well.  delish!

Cut the bacon in half and cook in separate pan. Immersion blender is a great idea. Sirarcha sour cream is also a great topping. Add Cajun seasoning. Will make again.

I really do love this recipe. I've made it as is and it was great. However, recently when I make this I use this recipe as a foundation but add to it. I used 4 cans of black beans (so I doubled everything) I throw a whole onion, several cloves of garlic, one green bellpepper, one red bell pepper, several serrano peppers, and 12 strips of bacon into a pan to cook. After that's done I throw it all into a crock pot to slow cook together for a few hours. It really is an amazing spicy and smoky black bean soup. I also mash up the beans a good bit while they're in the crock pot. I don't like the soup completely pureed, but I do like it to be thicker than a brothy soup.

I made this tonight and it was a hit. Granted it was a spare the moment type thing so. I didn't necessarily have all the ingredients but it still came out good. I watched chef John make this on youtube and after eating this at Panera bread the day before, I wanted to learn how to make it asap! Next time I will try the  recipe to a T to really enjoy the true taste. I had to substitute tavern thick slice deli ham for bacon, vegetable stock for chicken stock, no onions(i was out :(  ) and no oregano so I used thyme. But I kept measurements and everything else consistent to recipe. Very good. Thumbs up

Great soup! Easy and fast. Made it just as recipe called for other than a little heavy on the onions and garlic-think I need a support group. Had great luck using my stick blender. Don't leave out the bacon or dollop of sour cream. Thanks Chef.

It is delicious and easy my only change was I used low sodium, beans and bacon.  65% of your salt intake in one dish is a bit much.  The spices more than made up for less sodium.

Made this 3 times already and I can't tell you guys how much I love it. Been sharing this recipe like crazy. 

Good trick: once the onions and garlic are softened and done, add all the spices and stir for a minute. THEN add the chicken broth & beans for 30min simmering. This way, the spices stick to the onions and the flavours become enhanced.

Really good basic black bean soup. Didn't even use the bacon but I may dress it with some next time I have a bowl. I added a poblano pepper with the onion. Definitely freezer worthy. Use a hand blender if you have one as another person suggested. Two spoons up :)

Sorry chef John, I gotta ding this recipe as written. I can only speak for myself and, without the addition of more cumin and other spices and flavoring, this soup would have been bland.
As I started making it, it reminded me of a recipe for easy black bean soup that I really love: Dave Lieberman's on Food Network's website. However, I soon realized I needed to basically add the ingredients in Dave's recipe to yours if I was going to love it. So, that's what I did - I started out making your soup and ended up making Dave's. The only thing I didn't have was fresh cilantro to add at the end. The reason I gave your recipe 3 stars instead of 2 was because I liked the sambal mixture, which I believe also helped save the dish, and also because the recipe is fairly quick and easy to make. And, I really loved the texture after using a potato masher to help thicken it, which I never thought to do with Dave's recipe - great tip!!
I made these changes for those who are interested: I removed some of the bacon fat before continuing with the recipe b/c it doesn't need that much, added more cumin, chili powder, worchestershire, and a couple tablespoons of organic ketchup (it's in Dave's recipe). Roughly chopped cilantro added right before serving is also very tasty.

The soup alone was delicious. With the added relish and sour cream added, it pushed it over the top to 5 stars. I'm not great at making soups and don't cook much, and this recipe was still easy for me. I used turkey bacon to cut down on fat and added a little more cayenne and cumin because I like spicier food. I will definitely be making this again and it will definitely be devoured again.

This soup is excellent!!  I made it exactly as instructed in the video and it came out perfectly.  The relish was delicious and really added a nice bite to the dish.  And I used creme fraiche for the first time and really enjoyed it in the soup, although you only need a very small dollop of it as it is very rich.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is excellent in flavor.  I used diced pancetta instead of bacon.  I also added an additional teaspoon of cumin.  I will be making this recipe many more times in the future.  I loved it!

This was amazing just as it is written.  I like my soup a little thick, so I simmered it on low for an extra 15 min and added a tablespoon of cold water mixed with corn starch.  That made it the right consistency for us.  Some reviewers talked about using an emulsion blender.  Unless you just used that for 1/2 of the beans in a separate bowl I don't think that would be a good idea.  Seems you would likely blend up the onion and bacon which I disagree with.  The potato masher worked just fine.  If you like your food a little spicy like me, make sure you get the sambal paste.  I found it at my local Asian market.  That mixed with the lime juice and green onions  really kicked it up for a fantastic taste.  This made two bowls, and two for the freezer for later lunches.  We had it with a light salad.....Nirvana!!!!

The immersion blender is a must!  I love bacon, but it just seems trendy to put it into everything. I always use dried beans and a pressure cooker.  If you haven't considered a pressure cooker, you should.  They are much safer than they used to be with about seven safeguards built in and can cook a bean soup in 7-30 minutes from scratch, depending on the beans and if you pre-soaked them.

great tip about the immersion blender! Except I took out a couple of cups to blend and then added back to the soup so there were still plenty of beans and bacon. I would agree, this is the best black bean soup I've ever had.

I have always love black bean soup but I always have to buy from the store but after making this for the first time for me and my 7yrs old daughter, we both LOVED IT. I then make it a second time for husband and myself, he practical eat most of it. So today I had to double the recipe for the whole family, we love it very much and thank you for the recipe.

Excellent and yes, the suggestion for an immersion blender
is perfect, I make lots of soups and it is indispensible.
Thoroughly delicious, may I suggest using a Beano table before
eating for those with sensitive tummys.......
Also, I used for spice a 'Mexican Blend' YUM!!!

Made this today using my pre-made and frozen black beans I cooked from scratch. This was delish! I live alone so I liked this recipe because it was easy to halve. I was using up some chicken stock so I only needed about 2 TBLS of the water and I did not have a fresh lime so I substituted 1-1/2 T of lime juice concentrate, and I did not have green onions so I eliminated them from the garnish. This is a keeper since most ingredients are on hand in my home!

Hubby liked this more than me.  It was good and I especially liked the onion relish for the top but it took me 2 hours simmering to get where I wanted it texture-wise.  I think if I make this again I will leave out the can of water.... because the flavor is definitely there.

Yum.  Eating it now.  Creamy and just a bit spicy. I used about a pound of dried beans instead of cans.  I also extra little extra chicken broth but otherwise followed the recipe. I did use the relish and sour cream. This is yummy stuff.

So tasty, loved the flavor combination.  I added some carrots to mine and tossed them in with the onions.  I followed Georgi's advice and used the immersion blender just to chop up the long pieces of bacon and make the soup a little thicker.  Although next time might try pre-chopping the bacon and leaving the soup chunky....  either way this soup is wonderful, cheap and easy.  Even my husband who isn't a bean fan loves it.

This soup is delish! It's creamy, hearty and flavor packed! Like the other reviewers, I may add less bacon next time so it's healthier OR use cubes of ham instead. I also added a can of diced tomatoes to offset the creaminess of the beans with the acid and tartness of the tomatoes. SO GOOD.

I used 2 slices of bacon and added extra garlic and onion. In addition since I didn't want to waste my boxed chicken stock I added the whole box instead of water and let it simmer longer. Since I had no hoty sauce I subed in red chili pepper flakes and 1 dollop of low fat sour cream..dELICIOUS!!!

SOOO SOOO good!!  I pure'ed one can of beans to give it a really nice consistency.  I skip the topping, honestly I prefer it without it.  This has a permenant spot in my soups section of my recipe folder.  I have made it 3 times since I found it in December 2012, and will make it  numerous more times I'm sure.

I'm such a sucker for Chef John's recipes!  I prefer a healthier black bean soup but saw the addition of bacon, thought of my fiance and knew I had to try this...the bacon definitely takes this recipe over the top!  Thanks Chef John for sharing (and for your videos which I always enjoy :)!

This was absolutely fantastic as is... I cheated and used the store-bought chili paste/condiment but it was fabulous.  Don't forget to also top with a spoonful of sour cream and fresh cilantro.

I loved this recipe. I subbed the bacon with turkey bacon but didn't change anything else. Couldn't find sambal so I used fresh red chili peppers. AMAZING. The relish is a must with this soup. By itself it's great, but the relish makes the flavors pop. My family loved this. Will definitely make this again.

This was good, and not too difficult for a weeknight. I'll definitely make it again. I used turkey bacon to cut calories, and it was still yummy. I was tempted to not make the garnish, but I'm really glad I did. I couldn't find the sambal paste, so I combined the lime juice + green onions +  ~ 2 T "hot sauce. Both my fiance and I thought that the garnish added a really fresh, bright flavor to the soup. It was delicious with sour cream!

Wonderful!  Only had 1 can of black beans & 1 can of black bean soup (tried to pour off some juice so it didn't affect the flavor), forgot to add the water, but the mixture was loose.  Cooked it a little longer to thicken, I like it hardy!  The bacon melted away ( I was leary about unbrowned bacon).  Looked just like the video in the end.  Added couple of broken tortilla chips instead of the relish.  Absolutely wonderful.  This is a keeper, don't be afraid to try it!!
