These buns had the *best* flavor of any hot cross buns I've ever tasted.  The grated orange peel and other spices went very well together and the flavor was excellent.  I used dried cranberries (a.k.a. "Craisins" from Ocean Spray) in place of raisins and that worked very well, too.  My only word of caution to other readers about this recipe is that all bread machines are different, and what works in one might not work so well in another.  In my machine, these buns, although most definitely edible, did not rise enough, making the bread very dense.  If you prefer your buns to me more "fluffy," I would suggest adding an entire 2 oz. packet of yeast, or perhaps try the special "Very Active Dry Yeast" that's made just for bread machines.  All in all, my Easter guests enjoyed these buns, and I will be making them again.

I think a big part of this tradition is to cut crosses into the buns with floured scissors or sharp knife just before egg-washing them. Then you can spoon the icing into the grooved crosses after they come out of the oven. Also, I think they are supposed to be served hot. (I didn't think the icing in this recipe tasted good.)

Very good. I added about 1/4 more sugar to the batter. To make them more traditional, I made a soft paste with equal parts flour and water, and piped  it in crosses before baking the buns. This is the traditional way to make the crosses instead of the icing sugar!

Delicious!!

Very good. Next time I think I'll up the yeast by 1/2 tsp. as I thought they should have risen a little more (in comparison with my non-machine recipe).

My 4 year old nephew ate 3 of these on Good Friday afternoon with coffee.  He said to make them again, "a lot". Very easy and delicious.

These Hot Cross Buns are absolutely wonderful.  We will most likely enjoy them year round instead of just at Easter.

I have to say I made this twice in 2 days and it turned out different both time-better the second time.  Excellent both time first time more like bread second time more like buns I made these for my daughter for school for Sts. Day and they were a hit.  Instead of candied fruit I used dried cranberries and they turned out great.  I also mixed into the powdered sugar apx. 1 T. real butter...they were good either cold or warmed in the microwave for 45 secs. will do again I made them in my bread maker and took them out after the 2nd rise step and rolled into balls and placed on greased cookie sheet and let them rise covered on top of the stove while the oven warmed up for apx. 45 minutes...the second rise in the bread maker made them lighter and more like buns.  Will make again, and again

We love this recipe!  I have made it for the past two years at Easter.  My husband grew up having these but they were store bought and not very tasty...these impressed him!

great recipe----if you need paper weights.  Very disappointing- tasted better and the best hot cross to make is that not made in a bread machine.

Mine turned out like little mini hockey pucks that didn't rise at all.  I used regular flour instead of bread flour - maybe that is what made mine flop :-(

These just didn't work out right in my bread machine.  The dough was really wet and sticky and when I baked the buns they were really dense.

The spices and flavorings were spot on, but mine did not rise at all. There is something wrong with the liquid measurements and there isn't enough yeast.

We loved these. The water/icing sugar mix was way to runny though. My crosses ended up just being a glaze.

This is just as good, if not better, than my bread machine adaptation of my Mom's wonderful traditional recipe. I added 1/4 tsp. allspice and used 1/2TBS each of lime and lemon juice instead of water for the glaze. M.R.

I agree that the recipe needs more yeast.  The flavor was ok.  I liked the orange zest etc. The buns just didn't raise well.   Might also need additional sugar as they didn't brown well either.  Probably will try another recipe next time.

I did not have a bread machine so adapted it to my way of mixing ingredients together. It turned out very good, but may have been alittle too dry.  Otherwise, I found it tasty. I made crosses on top of the bun before baking and drizzled buttercream icing on top as crosses.

They turned out pretty nice. I heated the milk and water in the microwave for a few seconds, and added 1/2 tsp more yeast, as others suggested. The first rise didn't look like it went well, and I was worried a bit for the end result, but they rose nicely after they were shaped and they turned out well. I'd make them again.
