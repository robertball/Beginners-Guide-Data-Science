Very easy and quick to put together for a snack! I used a Mexican blend cheese and seasoned my tomato with a bit of cumin and chili powder. These were delicious with a side of homemade salsa and sour cream!

Ok, I never give 5 stars to anything I have to tweak. But, with a little work, these are really very good. I took the basic set-up, and altered it. The original recipe was way too bland for our tastes. 
I layered the first tortilla with a Mexican blend cheese, and a Monterey-Jack jalepeno cheese, then salsa, then more cheese. The cheese on both sides helps the tortillas stay together when you flip them. Cook over a very low heat so the cheese gets melted and the tortilla doesn't burn, then serve with sour cream.

I made these as a side dish for the aztec chicken recipe also found on this site.  My family loved them.  They also used them to spoon up the main dish.  I made them ahead of time and then just heated them up in the oven and then served them with a cup of salsa.

My husband loves this recipe.  He cuts leftover grilled corn off of the cob for an added sweetness and smokey flavor.

These are very good and very simple to make. I put salsa right in them for an added flavor and then served then with sour cream. You could add a whole lot to these too. I had to add scallions because I love them. Very good!

These were good! I used all cheddar since thats all I had on hand I also added the tomato to the inside instead of on top. The corn really added a nice sweetness to balance the inferno chili I made for dinner.

This was just wonderful. Loved it. I added the tomatoes in between the tortillas with the corn. Very tasty. Thanks.

This makes a tasty side dish. I cooked them on the BBQ and served with a dollop of sour cream - yummy!

Heh...maybe it was the choice of cheese that made this kinda bland?  You definitely need a good dipping sauce with this one.  I used sour cream which didn't do the deed for me.  The tomato on top seemed ridiculous so as others I chopped it up and threw it inside.  I don't think I'll make this one again, cheddar would have been better.

The corn and tomato make this healthier than just a cheese quesadilla, but they also makes it extremely messy to eat. Next time I'll leave out the tomato.

I added a taste of onion powder, black pepper,  and garlic salt to the cheese and corn layers, and used mild salsa instead of tomatoes on top. Delicious!!! I'll definitely make it again!

What's not to love? Fast food for starving swimmers.  They loved it.  Robards a van of black beans and added with the corn and cheese.

This soup is DELICIOUS! The only complaint is that it doesn't make enough.  You just want MORE!
