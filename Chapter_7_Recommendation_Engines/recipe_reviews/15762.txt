I was searching for this recipe for a few months, I had made it before in culinary school and loved it sooo much.  I made a few changed:  I used apple cider vinegar, plus more of it, I also used brown sugar rather than the white.  I did however cook the cabbage a little too long, I would have liked a more firm texture and the apples lost their texture as well.  Otherwise this is a nice dish, a little different and a pleasant change from corn or green beans!

This was a very delicious recipe. I presteamed my cabbage. When it was time to prepare the rest of the dish I simply sauted the onions and apples 10-15min then added everything else. it was done after about 5 min. of simmer time! I also substituted with the brown sugar and cider vinegar.

This recipe came the closest to the Rotkraut we had in Leavenworth, Washington.  Instead of apples I used applesauce so the flavor blended more evenly through the cabbage.  It brought back a lot of happy vacation memories!

This was an easy, quick and really tasty recipe.  I substituted 3 strips of bacon in lieu of the oil and also used apple sauce instead of apples.  I wish I would have made a double batch!

We really enjoyed this different dish. And easy enough to make. I used another reviewers suggestion and used apple cider vinegar (instead of white) and brown sugar (instead of white).

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  This time I used bacon drippings instead of the oil and it was better yet!

I'd had Red Cabbage with Apples in a German restaurant and really loved it. This recipe was so close to it and really good. I did add about 1 c. of sweetened applesauce to it, instead of the apples. Then I reduced the sugar to 2 T. and increased the vinegar to 4 T.  Delicious!

Good, colorful dish.  I used 2 Tbsp. each of vinegar and sugar and liked the result.  The only thing I would add to the directions is to watch carefully for sticking during the 25 minutes of simmering.

I really like red cabbage. This was one of the best I have had.   I am sure this recipe would have been great as is, however I changed it a little, taking suggestions from other reviewers.  I changed the veg oil for bacon.  I changed the white sugar for brown sugar and the white vinegar for apple cider vinegar.  I also used 1/2 an onion and 2 small leeks.  I think I Iiked this recipe because it didn't have too many spices like cloves or allspice that some people use in cabbage recipes.  The sweet and sour of the apples, sugar and vinegar along with the cabbage was good on its own without any additions.  Great recipe thanks.

This is a delicious recipe. Instead of 2 tbsp vegetable oil, I sprayed the bottom of the pot with a liberal amount of cooking spray and sauteed the onions for 5 minutes. Then, I added the cabbage with 1/3 cup vegetable broth. Healthier option with virtually no calories and it came out beautifully! Also, I used 2 tbsp brown sugar instead of 3 tbsp white sugar and 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar instead of 3 tbsp white vinegar. So yummy!

Very delicious. I followed the recipe just as written with no changes. Be sure to add the vinegar/sugar mixture and taste test as you go to get it just where you want it. Perfect balance of sweet to sour and a very lively dish!

At 45 years of age, I'm embarrassed to say I've never made nor eaten red cabbage.  Friends & family warned me against making this stating its too difficult & unpredictable.  My boyfriend hovered over me when I made it, lecturing about over & under cooking it.
I have to say, this recipe was not only easy & foolproof, it was DELICIOUS!!!  I can't believe I've been missing out on something so tasty all these years!  Can't wait to make this again!!!  SCRUMPTIOUS!

This was good both hot and, later, cold.  A little sweeter than I cared for.  Next time I will increase the vinegar and decrease the sugar, as I like them a little "pickle-y"

great recipe. Wife and I loved it. I used the Food Pro to shred the cabbage. Next time I will cut by hand to give more texture. With the increased surface area/smaller shred size that the Food pro shred gave, I lessened the cooking time by 8 minutes. I used 3 apples, and almost quadrupled the sugar/vinegar measurements. I would be cautious to say that the sugar/vinegar would be this or that since it's a taste preference. I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar.

Wow.  First I actually followed the recipe fully.  I'm glad I did.  This was great.  Unfortunately...or fortunately I just found out after 8 years of marriage  that my husband doesn't like cabbage!!!  He ate the helping I gave him and said it was good.   I'll absolutely make this again...but just for myself and company.

I'm a cabbage fan and really liked this recipe. I DID make larger chunks of cabbage, rather than shredding it, used Canola oil, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Also added a little garlic and more sugar & vinegar than recipe stated. Thank you for the recipe.  : )

Good. Pretty much made as written.  Added apples halfway through cooking time to make sure they didn't get mushy.

This was a really easy recipe to put together and very good!   I made the recipe exactly as stated, but, only used 2 tbsp of sugar instead of 3.  I also used a combination of butter and oil to saute in instead of just vegetable oil.  This was great served with roasted pork butt.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow this looks really similar to my Moms recipe (she is from Germany). We grew up eating this stuff and all loved it - 5 kids.  Differences: Add 1 -2 c. water -  Simmer for 2 hours - when it's done at 1 T flour to make a little "sauce" optional.  Also She used apple cider vinegar and maybe just one tablespoon of sugar. I make it now all the time with 1 T. Splenda - have a big plateful every day for lunch. Good diet food!

This was great! I cooked it for more like 20 minutes, so it wasn't complete mush. I also used cider vinegar and brown sugar, and only ended up needing 2 Tbsp of each to achieve the taste I wanted.

I browned six big chicken sausages, and then cooked cabbage in juices. Finished cooking sausages in oven. added 6 more apples and used apple juice instead of vinegar.  Added the juice from sausages in oven when I added sausages back in, Makes a heartier dish.

Good but not as great as I was hoping.  It made a ton and the leftovers weren't very appealing so I felt guilty for being wasteful.

This is pretty good, although I'm going to work with it a bit to bring out more flavor. I think the next time I'll use less onion. I'm also going to first fry some bacon and use the bacon grease instead of the oil. I'll then mix in the broken bacon pieces.

WOW this is an amazing recipe. So simple but delicious -- and what fun colors! The cabbage turns the apples hot pink. A great recipe to 'eyeball' with too -- a bit more of this, a bit less of that... Have fun with it!

Great recipe.  Made this with German Sauerbraten by Cathy Eland and German Spaetzle by MARBALET.  Felt like we were eating in a german restaurant.  Used brown sugar and cider vinegar as some others had suggested and cooked it all together as soon as the cabbage and onions had wilted.  Thickened it with a little cornstarch mixed with a little more vinegar and brown sugar.  Really yummy and made a ton.  I doubled the recipe because I was feeding 7 but had enough for a couple more.  When you said generous servings you really weren't exaggerating!

After eating at my husband's favorite German restaurant in his hometown, I HAD to find a recipe for red cabbage and this was it!  I don't add the onion and I use apple cider vinegar instead of white.  We eat this a lot in the winter with meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Yummy!

This was phenomenal!  Made it with grilled keilbasa and hot german potato salad and it was one of the best meals I've ever made.  My hubby went nuts for it.  The only thing i changed was using bacon grease instead of vegetable oil, and I added the sausage to the simmering cabbage once it was done grilling.  Will make many times again.  Thank you.

I have been trying to find the recipe that is the same as my late mother-in-law's. The only thing I did different was I remembered a bay leaf was added to the pot while the cabbage was cooking and then removed near the end.  This is perfect with goose, duck or poulty.

Fantastic! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I shredded in my foodprocessor with the slicing blade: 3/4 of a large green cabbage, 1/2 of a very large sweet onion, and 3 small Granny Smiths, cored but unpeeled. Fed 6 adults as a side dish. This one is a keeper.

The combo of ingredients kinda turned me off, but all I can say is...YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT! Some simple changes-didn't peel apples,omitted the oil (presteamed cabbage in micro. as someone suggested), and sub'd sugar w/Splenda. Whatta nice change and beautiful color! Entire family enjoyed it.

I love this recipe and it's so good for you too.  When I make it I double the apples and the vinegar- I like it a little bit more tart.  I found that it also works with apple sauce if you don't have apples.

3 servings?  More like 9.  We just made this for the 3 of us and split the leftovers into 2 dishes for the freezer.  However, it was very, very good.  Because I had a few apples that were getting soft, we added a little more then called for and really loved this side dish.

After reading this receipe and checking my fridge I didn't have any apples but did have fresh beets.  I sliced them and cooked them with the cabbage.  It was great.

It was good but I don't think I made it tart enough. It seemed that the vinger and sugar flavor hand not penetrated the cabbage. Maybe I did not cook it long enough but I didn't want to cook the cabbage down too much and have it loose its consistency. I'll keep experimenting

My husband enjoyed this and, besides peeling the apples, this was simple to make.  My biggest problem was in gauging when the cabbage was "cooked down" enough to add the other ingredients, and I way overcooked it.  If there was some type of guideline for those of us who are cabbage ignorant, it would be really helpful!  :-)

Great recipe!  I added a bit of grated fresh ginger, 1/4 cup of raisins and a pinch of allspice.  Used brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.  Next time I will also use apple juice instead of water as I will be making this one again.

I'd give this 6 stars if I could its so delicious!! Needed a recipe for red cabbage since we had a bumper crop in our garden this year. Cooked exactly as written, with the exception of using the Fuji apples that I had on hand, though I'm sure it'll be even better with granny smiths!

Love it! A nice variation on the equally good Hungarian or German recipe. I used cider vinegar as well, and I think it could taste great with white balsamic vinegar too. I also agree that adding the apple at a later stage is better, you will have a nicer bite. Last time I added a few golden raisins with the apple too.

I love red cabbage and apples so this is a nice little recipe for me. The first time i made it i followed the recipe exactly and while i enjoyed it i felt that it needed a bit more sweetness. The second cooking i did substitute mirin for the sugar and used cider vinegar instead of white. It's a little sweeter and not quite as tart. I like it a bit on the sweeter side

This was ok I think it would be better without the apples. Also was a little too tart.

Delicious!  I followed others' suggestions and subbed apple cider vinegar and brown sugar.  And it didn't need the full cooking time.  Will definitely be making this one again!

This was the exact flavor I was looking for!!! Had it at a restraunt once and I have been craving it ever since. I used brown sugar and apple cidar vinegar like someone else suggested. Perfect! I gave this five stars because I loved it, my husband hated it but he doesnt like cabbage anyway. oh well, thanks for the good recipe!

Awesome! I halved the recipe due to what I had on hand but wish I had more! The only change I made was using brown sugar instead of white. I cooked it a bit less than 25 minutes, probably about 15 minutes as I didn't want the veggies getting mushy. Will make again and again, perhaps add more apple too. Thank you!

My german great grandmother made this dish when I was a kid. I loved it then and wanted to make it for my kids. This was very very close to what I remember. I think butter was used instead of oil. I remember stirring the melted butter, brown sugar and water then pouring it over the cabbage. Any way loved it

This was tasty, but I felt the 3T of vinegar was overwhelming.  I had to drain the cabbage and continue cooking.  I also added 3 slices of bacon (cut into bits) and added brown sugar instead of white.

It's funny - when I tasted this out of the pan, I thought it was just so-so.  Then when I served it and ate it alongside a sausage and potato dish, it really popped!!  Must be something about the flavor combination.  Good recipe!

WOW.  This was sooooo good.  My husband really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to scale down the recipe a bit.  I also did not add any salt, and with only a half head of red cabbage, only added a few tsp of vinegar and sugar to taste.
Thank you so much for the recipe.  It was extremely simple to make and just the right amount of sweet and sour.

Yum!  This was much better than I had anticipated.  I added one extra Tbsp of vinegar, because it was initially too sweet, but the extra vinegar fixed that.  Served it with pork roast and dumplings and even my kids thought it was ok.

not bad at all!  I did add more vinegar as others suggested...using 3 TBS white vinegar and 2-3TBS of cider vinegar.  I didn't have time to shread the cabbage, just chopped it, so next time it might be better with it shredded.

I prepared this dish at for a German-themed dinner party but forgot to put in the apples.  It was probably just as good.  Even my husband liked this side-dish.  I used cidar vinegar and no water, and it was very tasty.  You'll love this dish!

This was a very tasty recipe. Though I do feel that baking, rather then stewing would have enriched the flavor of the apples, and made the whole side dish a little more hearty.

Great recipe and a nice change for vegetables.  I lowered the calories by using a non-stick pan and no oil plus I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Didn't have the vinegar they called for so I tried the tarragon vinegar I had on hand and it was great.  Found myself going back for seconds on just the vegetables!

I used my home made red cabbage sauerkraut and a red delicious apple. I made half the recipe here as I only had four cups of cabbage. It turned out great except next time I'll use Granny Smith apple because the red delicious got too soft too quickly. I also used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar as others suggested. Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding dish!  Loved the sweet and sour aspect.  Made the recipe as written but used apple cider vinegar and splenda to make this a guilt free side dish.  Will make it again.

After getting a whole head of red cabbage and no ideas of what to do with it except slice some for a salad I turned to All Recipes.  This recipe sounded good so I tried it.  It was just ok.  it was a small head of cabbage and there were 4 of us for dinner, not one person took seconds.  It's still in the fridge and none have touched it.  Will not make this again.

I just made this recipe and it came out great!  I used apple cider vinegar, as suggested by an other reviewer, but other than that, followed it exactly.

Very easy and tasty.  A little caraway seed would make it more German flavored.

This is as close to the red cabbage I had as a child that I have ever found and it was great.  My family loved it also.  I will make this again and will try it with bacon fat for a change of taste.

This is delicious! I followed other's suggestions and used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. Also, I only needed to simmer it for about 15 minutes instead of the 25 before it was really tender.

I only had 6 C. of red cabbage + 1 green apple but used the same amount of not-packed 'brown sugar' and white vinegar.  Totally, totally yummy.  It made a lot.  I served it as a side dish w/ Beef Strogenoff, my husband's favorite dish. Thanks. I will be making this again.

Very yummy, although cooking times were a bit off for me. I didn't have any tart apples or white vinegar on hand, so I substituted sweet apples, a bit of rice vinegar, about a tablespoon of lemon juice, and cut the sugar in half. It worked just fine and still had that characteristic sweet and sour flavor.

If you had told me a year or two ago that I would ever willingly cook a cabbage and *like* it I'd have looked at you as if you had antlers! It was very good though and I shall certainly be making it again. One note though, serves three? Three giant hungry vegetarians who were eating this as a main course?

This is a fast and excellent side dish. Can serve it with Pot Roast, chicken, even burgers. The only changes I made were using Apple Cider Vinegar, as other reviewers have mentioned, and substituting unsweetened applesauce for the sugar. Delicious.

The great thing about this dish is that people have usually never had anything quite like it.  I made it as a side dish for Hungarian Goulash (a la Jo Cooks if you are interested.)  The goulash was good but the red cabbage and apples stole the show.

This was surprisingly good.  I initially made it just to have a cabbage dish to go with the corned beef for St. Paddy's Day.  But we will definitely be making it again.  I used Granny Smith apples and apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  A nice cabbage side that blends just the right mix of sweet and sour.

Great recipe, but I made two small changes! First, I used Red Wine Vinegar instead of White Vinegar and Water. I also used a tsp of Cinnamon. I then combined all the ingredients in the Crockpot and let it simmer all day. It was the perfect side to Pork Schnitzel and Spaetzle!

Made it on a whim for a side-dish for some Bratwurst we were having.  Turned out beautiful.  I substituted brown sugar for the white, and used apple cider vinegar as per other commenters.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of Caraway seed which worked nicely.

This was a wonderful and different way to serve cabbage.  We love cabbage anyway and now we have another way to enjoy it.  The only difference I made was that I doubled the sauce. It was great!!

Very similar to the way my Polish grandmother (Babcia) used to make this. Sometimes I throw in applesauce along with the apples. I do find it takes longer to cook down and soften the cabbage then the recipe suggests. I have also thrown in some fried kielbasa when I have some on hand. Yum!

I used a very small head of cabbage since my family is not usually a fan of sauteed cabbage dishes.  I sliced my onions and apples thin to match the shred of the cabbage.  I used more than a few tablespoons of chicken stock (maybe 1/4 cup) and found it needed more salt than was called for.  I also ended up using a bit more vinegar since I felt the apples added a lot more sweetness even with only 3 tablespoons of sugar as called for.  Overall  I liked the flavor but my family wasn't thrilled so I doubt I'd make this again....after all, how much cabbage can one girl eat! LOL...Still my last comment is to try this one and see for yourself.

It was just too sour for us. I'd use less vinegar and sweet, not tart, apples next time.

Very nice recipe.  I've been seeking dishes without tomato-based sauces, since tomato-anything triggers GI distress for my husband.  This is a great alternative.  I added shredded carrot (I add carrot to just about everything). I also followed other reviewers' suggestions to use cider vinegar and brown sugar.  The seasoning balance is perfect.  I served it with simple boiled potatoes, sausage, and salad.  Thanks for posting!

This was great - my husband, daughter and I really enjoyed it. I took note of another reviewer's suggestion to use brown sugar. I thought I had apple cider vinegar but didn't - will probably taste even better with that. And I also think you can cook it maybe 5-10 min. less if you prefer a little firmer cabbage.

Easy and tasty - the entire family liked it.  Used brown sugar and apple cider vinegar, and the equal proportions of 3T/3T worked well with my small head of cabbage and two apples.  Good side dish to let cook while spending time preparing other items, and great with pork!

Perfect as long as I don't overcook the cabbage.  Brown sugar and apple cider vinegar are good substitutions.

Easy to make and has a good flavor.  It does not exactly taste like the German restaurant red cabbage, but found this to be simple and easy recipe.  Will try it again.  Like others, I used brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.  I did not have tart apples on hand, so I used a couple that I had.  Don't think it changed the flavor any.

I loved it. I think it needed a little more apple, so next time I'll add more. Also, for the indicated serving size, this made a LOT. As a side dish, I think the serving size listed is too small.

Very good, really nice to serve hot or cold. I've made this several times, sometimes changing the vinegar and sugar--brown sugar, honey, agave syrup, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar and tonight used some lingonberry vinegar. In the summer, we serve it at BBQs for a side or topper for hotdog or sausage sandwiches.

Most excellent and very easy to make. Has a smooth flavor, due to the apples, but does satisfy sweet and sour cravings.  To reduce carbs I used some Splenda and it worked very well!

I made this for my 9 month old son. It was good. My husband and I both ended up eating some.
