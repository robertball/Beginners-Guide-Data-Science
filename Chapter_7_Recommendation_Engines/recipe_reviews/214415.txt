These are absolutely delicious and super quick & easy to make!  I used canned crabmeat. (You can find it right by the canned tuna. Bumble Bee Premium Selct Fancy White Crab Meat is my fave.)  I definitely recommend this recipe!

These were wonderful! Easy to make, and tasted awesome! I used plain bread crumbs and added some oregano!

I have had much better- prefer mushrooms that have some buttery taste on top...these were kind of mealy & too crispy- I won't use this again.....
