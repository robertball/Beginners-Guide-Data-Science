I read the reviews first, and wanted to make sure the cookies didn't flatten out while baking. I added half a cup more flour to the recipe, and they came out soft and chewy, and about as high as I'd like. (Maybe 1/4 cup more flour next time to get them really fat...) I was out of chips, so skipped that, and they were still great as basic chocolate cookies. And since they were plain on the inside, I made up for it by rolling the cookies in powdered sugar before baking. That came out well. You could add anything to this dough; the idea of orange extract and zest crossed my mind, or maybe mac nuts with almond extract.

These cookies were quite nice. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and added an extra cup of flour. I omitted the salt and added a little bit of milk because the mixture was really dry. I was a little timid about the amount of sugar - I did put the 2 cups in, but next time I'll probably cut that down. They came out really nice and chewy - very heavy though, very chocolatey. I made two trays of biscuits then put the rest in as a cake (I got impatient) and that turned out quite nicely, I just left that in a little longer. 

I agree with the other reviewers, you must let them cool on the baking paper before transferring them to the rack because they will fall apart. I liked the texture - nice and chewy in the middle, harder on the outside. 

I'm giving it a four because I feel it's a tad sugary for my liking but the biscuits are quite nice. About them being flat - mine weren't very flat but I did add that extra cup of flour - they spread a lot so make sure you space them with big gaps in between. Yum! :)

My favorite new recipe!  I have made these 3 times now, and they are great!  The first time, after reading comments about them being flat, I used half margarine/half crisco.  Cookies were a little dry then.  The next 2 times I followed the recipe EXACTLY (well, Blue Bonnet stick margarine instead of butter)and they are fabulous!  Everyone loves them.  They are not flat, and very soft, but definitely done!  Just a note, they should be dropped by Tablespoon, not teaspoon.  I have a cookie scoop that is a measured Tablespoon, works great - bake 9 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

If the term "BET YOU CAN'T EAT ONE" ever described a cookie perfectly, this is the one!! I've made cookies for over 40 years and can't believe I never thought of this one.  It's very easy and very delicious.  I used real butter like it stated and (oink, oink) I think that really made a difference!!  HINT:  Let them cool a bit before trying to remove them...lot easier.  Thanks for a great recipe, Linda

First of all, let me say, "I loved these cookies!" After reading the reviews I decided that I would add an extra 1 cup of flour so the cookies would bake up nice & fat and they did. I used a small size ice cream scoop to make the cookies uniform in size & I also baked a couple of 1 inch balls that I rolled up in my hands to experiment with. The ice cream scoop ones were larger & baked just right for 9 minutes on an air bake cookie sheet with a silpat. The 1 inch balls on the same sheet for 9 minutes baked up more dry. Now for the add ins. I only used 1 cup of choc. chips but I also used 1 cup of chopped up dried cherries. I was very pleased with the out come.

I made the cookies as stated and they're great!  I then decided to try to reduce the calories and did this:
replaced 1/2 cup butter w/seedless, sugarless raspberry jam, and half the sugar with stevia by the cup.  All the other ingredients were unchanged - except used white chocolate chips.  Wow, they were fabulous cookies.  This is an all around great recipe - versatile but great as is, too.  I'll be using this a lot in the future.

Deeeelightful!! I have been looking for a good chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe, and this is it! The search is over. I also added an additional 1/2 cup flour,as others suggested, and they were perfect. The batter alone is fab, but the cookies are wonderful! Thanks!

These cookies are great!If you do not want you cookies to be FLAT though, you should use 1 & 1/4 cup of butter flavored Crisco and 7 1/2 teaspoons water in place of the butter.  Also I use peanutbutter chips in place of chocolate !! What a HIT!!

these were great, however this is the exact same recipe as Hershey's Reese's Chewy Chocolate Cookies.  The only difference is they add peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  Either way these are great chocolate cookies!

These are, in short, amazing. I have a hard time stopping my family members from eating them all fresh out of the oven which is really something. My only suggestion would be to take these right off the cookie sheet 1 to 2 minutes after they've cooled-or you'll have to deal with them being stuck to the sheet!

I was on the fence about making this cookies because the reviews were so mixed.  I read through a bunch of them, took tidbits of advice from all and came out with a fabulous cookie that stayed moist for almost a week (I kept one to test that out) and cooked up nice and high.  I made them for a cookie exchange and it was decided that they are so good they can almost be called "illegal."  I had to stop myself from gorging on all of mine instead of trying the cookies others had brought!
My variations:
Used 2 1/4 cups flour instead of 2
Used a little more than 3/4 cup of cocoa
Used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2
Used most of a bag of chocolate chunks and Reese's Peanut butter chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips
Omitted salt

Perfect.  They puffed up beautifully with an outer skin with the softest inside...they were gone within half a day.  I substituted 3/4 of the total sugar amount with powdered stevia, and one cup of mini-chocolate chips instead of 2 cups of regular-sized chocolate chips.  Next time, I plan to infuse the mix with a lil peppermint extract for a holiday flavor.  A suggestion: do not use butter or anything else that has less than a 53% vegetable oil, some peeps will advocate 80%.  Anything less, and more than likely the results will be flat cookies.  Likewise, the butter and sugar/sweeteners mixture has to be mixed until light and fluffy not just mixed.  Have fun and thanks for the delicious recipe.
*Note (12/10/10):  Scratch using the exact measurements of flour.  My brand, new "Anchor" 4- cup glass measurement cup is off.  Each "marked" cup is actually 1 and 1/8 cup...so for 2 cups (per this recipe) actually yields 2 1/4 cup, and extra 1/4 cup of flour for delicious fluffy cookies!  Enjoy.

Sooooo yummy!  I absolutely love them!  I didn't put the chocolate chips in them and just rolled them in powder sugar.  Perfect crispy shell and soft middle.

Very good recipe! I made a few small changes based on other reviews I read. I didn't soften my butter, instead letting my Kitchenaid do the work. I used almost a whole cup of cocoa, of which about 1/4 cup was black cocoa (can get from King Arthur Flour Co), added an extra 1/3 cup flour, and about a half cup extra chocolate chips. Used 1 3/4 cups sugar instead of 2 cups. Added an extra tsp vanilla, too. Baked on convection at 335 degrees F for about 9-10 minutes. I used a cookie disher, size 40, and got about 50 cookies. They are chewy and taste almost brownie-like. Have a beverage handy; these babies are RICH. I do agree with another reviewer that they are fragile right out of the oven. I use parchment sheets and just let them cool right in the pan for at least 5 minutes, to fully set up. I will definitely make these again.

My family loves these cookies. The only changes I made were to half the chocolate chips (because the first time I made them I didn't have enough and after that it just stuck) and to roll the dough in powdered sugar before baking. The only problem with them is that they don't keep well, so they should be made at most a day or two prior to eating. (But really, how could you wait a day or two?)

My family loved these cookies, they actually told me not to make them anymore because they couldn't stop eating them. Instead of adding vanilla I added coffee extract and that gave them a nice mocha flavor, yummy.

These were much better than I was expecting, one of the best cookies I've ever had in my life!!  The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 cup flour and refrigerate the dough before forming the cookies.  A must-have cookie recipe!

OMG!!!!! these are so friggin good! first of all i love big fat soft and chewy cookies>>>>based on the reviews i added one extra cup of flour and also used extra dark unsweetened cocoa powder and also milk and white chips in addition to the semi sweet on. They came out so yummy but not fat:(...that's ok though bc the taste makes up for it. I also baked them on parchment paper for easy cleanup! thank you!!!

We loved this recipe.  I noted that other reviewers mentioned adding an additional cup of flour, however, I added a cup of oats.  Also, I substituted 1/2 cup of the butter for a 1/2 cup of peanut butter (or almond butter)...yum!

Oh...my..god! Best cookies EVER :)))) I also used 1 additional cup of flour than the recipe says and added 1,5 cups of sugar instead of 2. They turned out perfect, so  2 cups of sugar would definitely be too much.

These are hands down the best chocolate cookies- and dough (yum)- ever. It also happens to be the exact same recipe from Martha Stewart's Cookie Book (Grammy's Chocolate Cookies). I am a huge fan of black cocoa (hard to find- I get mine through King Arthur Flour) and replace 1/4 cup of the 3/4 cup of regular cocoa called for in this recipe with it. The black cocoa makes the cookie just that much darker and richer. In addition to the chocolate chips or chunks, I also add a Ghirardelli white chocolate baking bar (broken into chunks). I roll the dough balls completely in coarse, clear, sparkling (sanding) sugar before baking. The sugar adds a nice little crunch and the white chocolate adds another creamy flavor surprise and a nice visual contrast to the dark, rich chocolate color. Luscious.

YUM!!  I did make some changes to this recipe, based on previous reviews.  The cookies were very good, though.  
I did change the flour to 2 1/4 cups and I used 1 cup each of brown and white sugar.  I used about a cup each of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips and I added chopped pecans, too. I baked them for about 9 minutes and they were great.  I love a soft, yummy cookie, and these fit the bill.

one of the nicest double chocolate cookies ever!
i decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 mix of white n brown sugar and increased the flour by 3/4 cup to 1 cup.if not they will turn out awfully flat.
the cookies turned out nice.they were moist chewy n yummy!they had slighty crispy edges.they weren't thin at all.
yummy!

Absolutely wicked cookies! If anyone has given these questionable reviews, I say check your internal oven temp or something else, because it is not the recipe. Yes, they spread to a lovely flat round cookie, so allow room for that and definitely let sit until firmed up a bit before removing from cookie tray. And BTW, cookies are supposed to be sweet or they would be called crackers. These cookies are perfect!

These were a big hit. Great chocolate, chocolate-chip cookie. They were soft and chewy and when baked a bit longer the edges got crispy but the center was still soft & chewy. Be sure you beat your butter and sugar for a while (3-5 min minimum), don't skimp on this step. Will make these again! Thanks for a great recipe.

Ok, Just made them .. for some one who LOVES sweets those are TOO SWEET so what I recommend :
1. add half the amount of sugar
2. add an extra cup of flour
3. they do not spread much as some have recommended 
4. do not add any liquid even if you think the dough turned to be a bit dry just mix it a bit with your hand it will mix better and you can see there is no need for extra water or milk.
5. bake them for 9 minutes no more 
They are SUPER rich and chewy  
I will give them 3 just because how Sweet they turned

I have been making these for years.  I grew up with these cookies and stumbled upon the recipe here.  One recommendation is I add 1.5 cups of Reese's peanut butter chips instead of 2 cups choc. chip.  They are a big hit for any occasion!

I did add an extra cup of flour as per other reviews, I won't next time.  But as with all baked goods, flour has to be adjusted depending on altatude and humidity.  They were VERY sweet, hubby loved them.

These were excellent!!  I followed the original directions except I put mine in the fridge to chill and then rolled into balls and  then in powdered sugar.  They baked perfectly.  I let them cool for a minute and then topped them with a white chocolate hershey kiss with crushed candy canes inside.  They look so festive and cute and taste even better:) They weren't at all dry and and not fat but not flat either.  They were nice and chewy, absolutley perfect!!  Got rave reviews from my coworkers!

The cookies turn out great. They were a little dry so in lieu of milk as someone else suggested I added some vanilla yogurt. My only complaint is that they were very hard to mix. I'm no baking expert so I didn't want to stray too far from the original recipe as this has turned resulted in disaster more than once! Overall, I love the taste, but it was definitely killer on the arms!

Very Good. I added a 1/4 cup additional flour and used semie-sweet chocolate chunks/  I also made the slightly bigger than suggested, but none of the cookies ended up touching each other which I assume was the extra flour.  They stayed nice and thick.  If you like chocalate you must try this recipe.  I got a little creative at the end and sifted a little powder sugar on top.

Absolutely the best cookies ever!  My daughter just made these, as we were looking for a new cookie.  They were perfectly moist and thick.  I did not soften the butter completely, because I read reviews that they spread too much.  They were perfect.  Literally, they just melt in your mouth!

These were really good chocolate cookies.  This is my first successful attempt at a CHEWY cookie!  I had my doubts, but they really are chewy and good.  I used margarine and added about 1/4 cup of extra flour as suggested by others.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cream of tarter to get a crackly effect on the tops.  This is a great base chocolate cookie recipe, thanks!

Very yummy!  I actually make these cookies into bars for catering.  I add about 1/2-1 cup extra flour like others stated and pat the dough into a jelly roll pan with a rubber spatula or lightly wet fingers.  Everyone loves them and they don't last long!

these cookies were GREAT!!

i cut down on the sugar, increased the cocoa, and added some cinnamon.

But i have to admit it was a little too chocolaty and needed a little more sugar

These cookies are disgustingly sweet. And if you
don't bake them exactly the right time, they
come out either way too soft and doughy (chewy is nice, but I wasn't looking for falling-apart chewy), or they come out crisp and hard. I won't
be making these again.

I was looking for a recipe similiar to the chewy chocolate cookies Torrance bakery makes and I thought I had found it.  But I was wrong.  The cookies weren't bad but I don't think they deserve the raves previous reviewers are giving them.  They turn hard and crunchy by the next day. The ones from the bakery are not quite as chocolately (don't add the choc. chips maybe?) and they have a shiny look to them and don't flatten out.  Anyone have any ideas what causes the shine?  I'm still looking to make these perfect chewy choc. cookies.

Everyone in my house loves them! I added 1/2 cup extra of flour and it was exactly what I wanted. We now divide the batch to make them with regular mini choc chips or mint chips or peanut butter chips or crushed english toffee. They are best right out of the oven but, keep well in a ziploc bag for a few days.

These are AWESOME!! I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 lard (NOT that nasty, plastic tasting shortening )so they would not go flat. Straight butter will make your cookie go flat. I used a cup of cocoa powder. Mine need just a touch of liquid, so I used about 1/4 cup coffee. Then put sea salt on the top of some. SO gooood! Will save & make many times!

My husband the skeptic was very doubtful of these cookies before I baked them. He is a believer now and so am I. I followed the advice of several comments and added the extra flour. Kept in plastic storage container they stayed soft but I left a couple out to dry some and they were excellent with morning tea.

I made this today. Results: - too sweet- very flat - need to bake at least 10mins so that it can stay in one-piece. I would not recommend this unless you like extremely sweet cookies.

I LOVE this recipe!  Since finding it here a few weeks ago, I've already made them several times since.  I love that the ingredients are simple and things usually on hand. ** I do add about 1/4 cup more flour than listed, since when I didn't they were paper thin (but still tasty!).  Adding the extra flour helps them come out still somewhat flat and spread out (which is how I like them) and chewy and not at all cakey.  One batch I did accidentally add too much flour and they were puffy and cakey... blah!  I've learned that 1/4 cup is just right.  I don't add the chocolate chips b/c that's just too rich for me, really they are delicious plain.  I might add walnuts or white chocolate chips sometime, though.

I made these for treat day at my daughters preschool and they were gobbled up by the kids and teachers! I did add a little re flour like the other reviews suggested and I had to bake them for a few minutes longer but they were awesome and chewy. Will definitely make again!

Oh my, these were delicious.  I was looking for a chocolate cookie recipe that would work well being wrapped around a candy before baking.  This recipe was perfect.  I needed something that didn't flatten too much, could stand up to the extra weight of a candy, and had a texture that complimented the gooey candy well.  This was probably the third recipe I tried, and just what I was looking for.  Without the candy inside, this was still an amazing chocolate cookie, and I will absolutely be making many more!

Yum! Just made these and they are awesome. I used two sticks of butter and added 1/8 of a teaspoon of peppermint oil to make them more "christmasy". Easy and makes a lot of cookies.

Not really what I was expecting.  I was looking for a more thick cookie but this came out very thin and flat.  They tasted okay but not what I wanted exactly..

I've never had any luck with chocolate chip cookies. They usually either fall flat or are too tall and cake like. Not these!! These are as close to perfect as any cookie I've ever eater, let alone made. I kept the recipe exactly as is. Didn't add a thing and I'm glad. If I had added extra flour they would have been too cake like for my taste. All in all a GREAT cookie that I will make again and again.

I followed the recipe to a "t" and didn't like the results. I usually dont say that about cookie recipies, but these came out extremely flat and when I tried to take them off the cookie sheet, they stuck and ripped apart. So, next time I will make something with a better recipe and will not do these again. It made me upset due to trying to make something diffrent to celebrate a friend having their first kid. Guess being in a hurry now I have to buy premade ones. Bummer.

Amazing! If you're looking for chewy, soft, brownie- like cookies..these are it! I did however add about 1/2 cup more of flour like the other reviews said and they came out perfect. I think vanilla ice cream would be a perfect match for these! You must try this recipe!

This were so ooey gooey delicious! Definitely make them no bigger than a tablespoon if you'd like them to bake correctly.  My husband made these for a gamer party with marshmallow fluff for cookies sandwiches. They were gone almost instantly - 4 dozen (counting two per sandwich). Definitely a favourite and we will make again!

I added 1 cup of oatmeal to the recipe (instead of extra flour as some suggested).  They were nice and plump with very good flavor.  Will make again!

simply amazing. i've done a ton of different versions of this recipe including peanut butter filled, mint chips, caramel chips, and coating the whole cookie in powdered sugar.   it's just a great cookie base.

OMG!!!  These are amazing!  I was not expecting these to be sooo good!  I was looking for a cookie recipe without brown sugar (I love the ingredient search feature on this site!) and I wanted to make cookies with what I just had on hand.  I got a very pleasant surprise with how exceptionally good these were!  I used half butter and half butter-flavor Crisco (to make a taller cookie) and they were perfect!  Thank you for this contribution!

Very good. I was out of chocolate chips so I essentially made chocolate sugar cookies. Minus the chips, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and ended up with dense, rich, chocolate-y cookies.

I used this recipe because I did not have brown sugar on hand and it was the hishest rated amonst choc. chip. cookies not requiring brown sugar. They turned out delicious, chewy and crunchy, soft in the middle. My one problem is that in the last legs of the 8 mintues baketime, they spread out ALOT. They were nice and round throughout the beginning, but all of a sudden they just melted together and I had to seperate them as soon as they came from the oven. I will fiddle around with the recipe to remedy that problem. I also added skor bits to the mix to make it a little fun!

Tasty, tasty. I also reduced the sugar to, oh about 1-1/2 cups, and 3 Tbls of that was brown sugar. I have a nasty dislike for measuring, and tend to just guess (I know--bad, bad,bad).
Then I increased the flour to, say, 2-3/4 c.
Added 2 tsp. cinnamon, which is a great chocolate enhancer. I used a small bag of choc chips-don't have a clue how much that is, but it worked. The best hint--a VERY slight spritz of nonstick spray on sheet. Baked exactly 9 minutes (I actually set a timer for once). They are just the cutest, most perfectly shaped round and chewy cookies. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY. Hubby loves them. Me too. Had to go get more milk.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I came to allrecipes looking for a cookie recipe, without the chocolate chips.  I decided on this one b/c so many people had said they either substituted or omitted the chips entirely.  I baked these in a 9x13 pan and then sliced them up.  Very tasty, reminds me of brownies a lot, but that's probably because I added about 6 chunks of bakers chocolate.  I baked them for about 25 minutes, and they still appear very gooey even after cooling for 35 minutes.  Still very tasty though, very rich, one piece is more than enough for me!

I've tried to bake twice, which are all successful.  Taste good and chewy.  Im very happy that I found this recipes, since it is very expensive to buy chewy cookies in Hong Kong (around HK$9.00).  Thankyou very much!

Amazing cookies!  I regret making only half the recipe!  These remind me of the Entenmann's double chocolate cookies, only they're much better since they don't have a chemical-y taste.  I followed the recipe closely, though I used a little less sugar and a little more cocoa powder.  I didn't have any problems with flatness--they were nice and round--I did form each tablespoonful into a perfect ball before dropping it on the sheet.  Baked for 8 minutes, they were perfect.  They taste the best right out of the oven, but although they are slightly dry today (I baked them yesterday), I think they held up quite well.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks!

Very chocolaty! The first batch I put in, was following the directions to a T, however, the flat, falling apart texture wasn't to my liking, so I added a bit more flour. Still very gooey and chocolaty, but not quite to prone to falling apart when they've fully cooled - which is a must if you're transporting the cookies anywhere. (And I do that alot, since most of my cookies end up at get togethers.) Good cookies all around.

Awesome chewy chocolate cookies.. especially right out of the oven.  I found they went "stale" even more quickly then other cookies, and lost their chewiness over night. I will make them again!  A good change from plain old chocolate chip cookies!

This recipe really worked! Thank you! I'm in the UK, so I needed to add an extra 30g of plain flour (slightly less absorbant than all-purpose flour). Also, I substituted the choc chips for chunks of peanut chocolate bar (called Snickers here).

This recipe is the greatest!  As a choco-holic, I think it is the best cookie I have ever tasted.  I love the recipe just the way it is, and I also made delicious peanut butter and chocolate cookies by adding two HEAPING tablespoons of peanut butter and substituting one cup of peanut butter morsels for one of the cups of chocolate chips.  People beg me to make these cookies!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, Linda.

Did do   tweaking as follows; used half shortening,,half margarine, for sugar did 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugars,  also  needed additional 1/4 cup of flour. Added white chips along with nuts. Chilled dough for 45 minutes. Baked for 81/2 -9 minutes (depending on pan size) Soft, chewy, and chocolatey. Batch made    approximately 7 dozen  cookies dropped by heaping teaspoonfuls  and gently pushed down with finger.  Excellent base recipe. Will make again.

I added an additional 1 Cup of flour. I think next time I'll cut it down to an additional 3/4 Cup instead.  The cookies were a big hit. We dipped them in heart confetti prior to baking and they made a perfect Valentines Day treat.

The cookies came out perfect, soft and chewy! I did make one change though, I reduced the amount of white sugar to 1/2 cup, and used 1 1/2 cup brown sugar.

These are great flavorful and chewy. I used butter instead of margarine and I added a dash of finely ground expresso to enhance the chocolate flavor. Lastly I worked quick mixing the batter and refrigerated it right before scooping on the baking sheet to avoid flat cookies.

These are so delicious! I have tried the recipe as is as well as with an extra half cup of flour. Both batches were chewy but the cookies with the additional flour were fatter and I prefer them that way. This has become a go-to cookie in our house!

I read a bunch of reviews and have to admit to tweaking the recipe a bit. I added about a 1/2 cup more of flour, 1/2 cup less of sugar, about a 1/4 cup more of cocoa, AND as a surprise twist added in about a 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Yummy. I might lower the amount of additional flour to 1/4 cup next time since the cookies were pretty high at the end of baking; I actually had to tap them down with the back of a spoon about a minute before baking was done. All in all, these cookies turned out fantastically. Super rich, and definitely requiring of some milk, but delicious all the same.

I added everything but the chocolate chips because I ran out. I added a full cup of cocoa powder to make up for the missing chocolate. I thought they were a little to sweet, so the next time I will have to cut back on the sugar to 1 - 1 1/2 cup. Mine also didn't come out flat.

These are delish! Made a half batch since there's only 2 of us. Added +/- extra 1/4c. flour as per others reviews also used shortening and a few tsp water for butter (what I had on hand). I accidentally added 1/4 tsp too much salt but it was surprisingly good, a sweet slightly salty combo...so a good accident in the end! :) Used half semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 dark chocolate chips for the most deliciously chocolatey cookie ever! Important: you only bake them 9 min so you get that perfect chewy texture. Be careful not to overbake. Baked mine on parchment so I didn't have to wash the cookie sheet after and for easier removal. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box. Gonna try adding nuts next time or maybe switch chocolate chips for peanut butter chips...an awesome cookie either way!

Took the advice of others and added an additional cup of flour. Other changes made: added one ripe banana and omitted 1/4 cup of butter, used whole wheat flour, only 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup walnuts. They turned out great and still soft! I rolled half in autumn sprinkles for a festive Halloween kick. Yum!

They taste amazing, super indulgent soft cookies, but the cookies spread to twice their size so make sure to space them out. Also be careful after they come out of the oven as they are extremely soft and malleable, let them cool on the baking sheet and don't try to pick them up until they reach room temperature.

These cookies are by far the best I've ever made! They are absolutely delicious! The only thing I had to do different was I added about a 1/4 cup of milk because the dough was to dry. I think next time I make these instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I'll use a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of peanut butter pieces. Awesome recipe, thanks!

I tried this and made the recipe for 24 cookies as opposed to the original 48 because I wouldn't need so many. The batter itself was delicious.. but the cookies were flat for me, tasted just awful and literally smelled like nothing, which was very strange! I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I rated this 1 star because that is "Couldn't eat it" and couldn't eat these cookies.

Good luck all.

Yummy!  I made them with a cookie scoop. Maybe they were bigger than they were supposed to be, but they needed to cook 10 minutes. When I took a pan out at 9 they would not firm up and were still raw. If they are still shiny cook another minute.

Great for what I had on hand.  Family was craving chocolate chips cookies, and came across this recipe.  unfortuantely I didn't have enough chocolate chips... BUT I did have Reece Peanut Butter chips... so 1/2 amount chocolate chips and 1/2 amount peanut butter chips... and tossed in a 1/2 cup of salted peanuts.... it was a HUGE hit.  thanks!

If I read the reviews first, I would probably rate these cookies higher, but in reality, the recipe as it stands is flawed in my opinion. It DOES need more flour and it really has too much sugar. I would add half a cup of flour and decrease the sugar by 3/4 cup. I added the flour half way through the batch and it improved the cookie, but it was still too sweet.

I gave this 5 starts because of the modifications I made.  First I used 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup of flour, 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and used 1 package of milk chocolate chips.  I also stuck the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes before my first batch went into the oven and kept the rest in the fridge while the others were baking.  Since I kept the dough in the fridge it took 12 minutes to bake.  The cookies came out nice, fluffy and very rich and I got 67 cookies!!!

I always read the reviews on recipes before I try them, yet i usually prepare it the way it says the 1st time & then go back the 2nd time & tweak it. These reviews said to add a little more flour, but they came out perfect for me the 1st time; i wouldn't change it the 2nd time. They were delicious! The first time i added white chocolate chips & macadamia nuts to half the dough & semisweet to the other half. We prefered semisweet.

These are excellent chewy chocolate cookies, exactly what I was looking for.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and followed the directions exactly, not changing anything.  It made 36 perfect cookies, baked at 9 minutes and then cooled for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet.  Perfect chocolate fix.. just what I needed!

Wonderful chocolatey cookies! They do spread out a bit so I may take prior reviewers suggestion and try adding extra flour next time. They ended up like brownie-cookies. Everyone loved them nonetheless! Thanks!

Made as is, and yes, the cookies came out very flattened-but they tasted very rich and chocolaty and was wonderful fresh out of the oven.

Very chocolatey and delicious! I added the extra cup of flour that most of the reviews suggested and they turned out perfect! Make sure you have a glass of milk handy.

Just made these, came out perfect. I cut down the sugar by half a cup and used bread flour instead of regular because that was all I had. They were nice and plump, not flat at all. They didn't spread out much, stick to the pan, or come out messy. I let them cool for a few minutes on the pan and just popped off the perfect little circles, didn't even need a spatula. I really think the bread flour might have made the difference. These were a big hit and very easy!

Best. Cookies. EVER! I love these! Some people said they fell flat, but mine didn't at all. They also weren't too tall. They were perfect, chewy, flavorful... everything! My brother (who is quite picky, especially about chocolate cookies) loved them and said they're very "exciting." I made them big and baked them about 14 minutes. My favorite cookie recipe ever!

These are delicious.  I did half the recipe and got about 2 1/2 dozen cookies. I used a teaspoon drop size for the cookie size and substituted the sugar with a packed brown sugar same amount.

Chewy and chocolatey! I made half a batch mostly following the recipe. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also added just a bit of cinnamon. It made almost exactly 24-2 inch cookies - about a tablespoon of dough for each cookie. They were soft and falling apart just after coming out of the oven but set up nicely after a couple minutes.

I loved this recipe! Did alter it a little by adding 1 1/2 cups more flour and I didn't put in the chocolate chips (they were delicious as they were). The cookies came out nice and plump, yet they were still firm on the outside and chewy on the inside. I made them about the size of a golf ball and got quite a few (didn't matter for they were still gone in no time).     After making them a few times, I thought 'hey, why not make these mint chocolate cookies?'. So I added a teaspoon of mint and wow were they good! I even put mint chocolate chips in them after instead of just plain chocolate chips. Everyone kept asking me to make more, which I did. Yumm... Definately a keeper! :)

I think this recipie is missing baking powder? The cookies are flat i was hoping they would be more plump like in the picture. Perhaps the author could double check they havn't missed out baking powder?  ...The next day I tried it with baking powder and it came out perfectly, just like the picture.

My family LOVES this recipe.  They were super easy to make and so chewy and delicious!  I did increase the flour to 2 and 1/2 cups and also added finely chopped walnuts to about 1/2 the batter.  I was able to make almost 6 dozen cookies using a rounded tablespoon.  I did increase the cook time to about 12 minutes.  They were anything but flat, infact I don't think their size or shape changed much at all in baking .  I look forward to making them again and perfecting them!

Cut this recipe in half.  Made using Splenda in place of the sugar and half whole wheat flour.  Did not add extra flour. The cookies in the first batch hardly spread out at all, so I flattened them before baking with the second batch.  Tasted awesome!

WARNING: DO NOT attempt to make this recipe unless you are prepared to loose control and eat 10 cookies in one sitting. You will not be able to stop yourself, they are AMAZING. The only thing I changed was to replace 1/4c of the sugar with corn syrup for extra chewyness.

I love these cookies and they freeze really well. Instead of 2 eggs, I used 1 egg and 1/4 cup applesauce. Had no trouble with flattening and they came out fabulous.

I really liked these. I added the extra cup like the other comments said after i followed the recipe and the mixture didnt dry enough. I also omitted a cup of chocolate chips and added a half cup of fresh chopped cherries. I'll agree that these do seem a bit like brownies but i like brownies so they were good. Also, maybe it was jus my oven but i had to leave them n a bit longer than the recipe said.  Overall a good cookie!

I have to give this cookie three stars because when i tried to get them off the baking sheet they would just fold. I waited till they were cooled too. I ended up with just broken cookies, but what was left did taste very good.

I honestly didn't know how to rate this one, mainly because I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't stick to the main recipe. Reviewers suggested to add an extra cup of flour and less sugar.  I added 3 cups of flour and 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Some reviewers did this because they said the cookies spread too far too quickly and were very flat.  By adding the extra cup of flour my cookies wouldn't flatten AT ALL.  I had to manually go in and flatten them half way through baking.  I gave it 3 stars because I didn't like them, but solely based on my adjustments.  I have no opinion about the original recipe, I would say try the original first!! If you don't like it, make adjustments next time.

Yes, YES, YES!!!!!!!!!! These are THE best cookies I have EVER made.  They are crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfect!!

Being a bit hopeless when it comes to cooking sweets, I did read previous reviews and only attempted half a batch.  For this I increased the amount of flour used to 1 1/2 cups, the amount of baking powder to 1 tspn (my jar says to use 2 tspn per 4 cups of flour), and the cocoa by maybe an extra 2 tbpsn. I did everything else as per the recipe.  I found 9 minutes not long enough, but I think given all ovens cook differently, this is just a typical fiddle until you find the right time/temp.

And that was it!! "They aren’t half bad, are they!" is a rave review from my 5 year old who NEVER eats home made cookies!  We gorged ourselves on these and will most definately make again!! 

UPDATE: I have just made these again, only two days later, and this time used wholemeal flour since that was all I had.  These cookies are going to be so bad for my waist-line...I can't stop eating them! The kids love them...everyone loves them! Can I give another five stars....?!!

These were pretty good. I changed it after reading the reviews...Used 2 1/4 cups flour instead of 2 Used a little more than 3/4 cup of cocoa Used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 used a whole bag of Reese's Peanut butter chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips UPDATE: followed recipe except added a tbsp of milk and used a bag of Andes mint chips -- they were FANTASTIC! They were crunchy on the outside and thin... tasted just like girl scout thin mints!

these cookies are really good, but i must admit, it all depends on the cocoa you used. i used a good one - a really expensive one, actually. they looked really weird, but the taste is delicious.  of course, they were chewy, and my friends couldnt get enough of them! they asked me to make a second batch - which i am going to make soon!

Great consistency and taste. Adding an additional cup of flour and a 1/4 more cocoa helps tremendousley. I added 1 cup waulnuts, 1 cups semi-sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. Right out of the oven their awesome. Can't wait to see how they stand up after a day, it there's any left. Thanks for the recipe.

Very chewy and rich cookie.  I found I needed a extra 1/2 cup of flour.  Also I substituted 1 cup of chocolate chips for Skor bar pieces.

My hubby likes chewy cookies and I like crunchy, I thought I'd give these ones a go as I had most ingredients on hand... well I didn't have any cocoa so I used cadbury drinking chocolate and I didn't have any choc bits so I used a block of hazelnut milk chocolate. Seeing the drinking chocolate and hazelnut chocolate are already so sweet I only used 1 cup of sugar. They came out flat, But they were certainly chewy and tasted just amazing!! I wasn't so sure how they were going to turn out but I really surprised myself, these could be called chewy hazelnut chocolate cookies... huge thumbs up for this one!! Hubby is going to be surprised that I made awesome chewy cookies.. Thanx for sharing!!

I used 3 cups of flour and substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar and added reeces pieces.  They were a little hard and not as sweet as I'd have liked, but the reeces pieces made them more flavorful.  Since I'm a chocolate freak, next time I'll probably use the 2 cups of flour recommended and increase the cocoa slightly.

came out really flat, but had the texture and taste of pilsbury cookies. i would just make the pilsbury ones cos its way easier, but i like to bake and i like to use kosher salt in this recipe cos it gives the cookie so much flavor and some crunch. yums.

I agree, these are great.  I too used butter-flavor crisco, and also added some peanut butter chips.  My brother says these are the best cookies I've ever made.  I think he ate at least ten of them on the night I made 'em.

I liked this recipe it is easy and simple to make no fuss at all, and its versatile you could use nuts instead of chocolate chips or both. Loved the texture.

Well this would be one of the nicest cookies ever!  They don't look fantastic but the taste is to die for!  I have amended the recipe - 3 cups of flour gives a nice thick cookies that is chewy on the inside.  Big chunks of chocolate also make it nicer.  Now a family favourite!

Five star cookie!  Chewy and moist with a great chocolate taste.  Chocolate lovers will love these cookies.  They tasted almost like a brownie.  I used white chocolate chips to give a contrast between the dough and the chip.  Great recipe.

I think the people who said these turned out flat probably used baking powder instead of baking soda. Also, I didn't have enough white sugar, so I substituted brown sugar for half the amount.  I won't do that again. It's not a good combination with the cocoa.  The whole family loved them anyway though.

I don't knowo what's up with the "cookies are flat" comments because these turned out perfectly! I made the recipe just as it is, and all I can say is that I can't make them when I'm home alone. I'll either eat the batter (something I have never been prone to do), or I'll eat them all after they're done baking. Five plus stars!!

Rave reviews for this cookie!  Chewy with a great chocolate taste.  They don't transport too well, due to their tendency to fall apart.  Regardless of their crumbly nature, they are excellent!

I'm sorry, but I just don't agree with other reviewers.  The taste was good, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but they were so flat!  I like a nice round cookie, and these weren't. Have cooked the remainder of the dough in an 8'x8' pan to make a cookie bar slice - hopefully this will salvage something!

I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I made these without, but they were still quite good. I used a very generous 3/4 of a cup of cocoa powder, and the cookies had a good deep chocolate flavour. They stayed soft and chewy for the few days they lasted.

I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies, when I realized I had used all of my brown sugar cooking for Thanksgiving.  I came to my trusty all-recipes website, found this recipe, and was pleasantly surprised.  They were moist and rich without tasting too cakelike.  My kids were thrilled! I used about a fourth of a cup of shortening in place of some of the butter to keep them softer longer when stored.

These are delicious! Very rich, very chewy inside, and delicately crispy on the outside. I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and left out about 1/4 cup of sugar. I baked them at 350° for 9 minutes, and not any longer! They need to cool entirely before you try to move them or they will fall apart. I was pretty sloppy about dropping them on to my pan and then removing them to cool so mine cracked, but regardless of how they look they still turned out perfect! I'm a huge chocolate lover and these are perfect!

I made it exactly as is and they turned out great! Actually, I take that back - my sifter had a hole in it so I wasnt able to sift the dry ingredients and then I added marshmallows (sons a huge fan) to half the batter and they still turned out great :)

These are great. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I also added about 1/2 cup of finely crushed oreos (just the cookie, not the cream). Oh my did that amp up the chocolate flavor! I like my cookies big, so I use about a 1/4 cup of batter per cookie and bake for 10-12 minutes. These were fabulous and the addition of the oreos really was terrific.

This tasted like a traditional chocolate chip cookie but with a chocolate dough. Very good. I will make it again.  I ran out of chocolate chips so I used 1 cup chocolate chips  and 1 cup chopped Hershey bar. that added more interest. I may use M&Ms next time.

This recipe turned out great,  and usually I'm terrible at making cookies!  They plumped up nicely (which is where I usually fail) and are super moist in the middle. I used the recipe exactly as written,  but added a little decoration for Christmas by  melting some Andes mints on top, piping on a white tree with a star sprinkle on top,  and dusting with some ground up peppermints and they are fabulous. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

followed recipe as instructed, with the changes as suggested by other viewers, I added one more cup of flour and used only one cup of choc chips . my cookies came out crispy, which I didn't hope for. the last batch I baked  less than the suggested time and they were softer. I did miss the chocolate chips, however, adding one more cup of choc chips plus 2 cups of sugar seemed to me that it is overly extremely sweet. my cookies were too sweet even with one cup of chic chips. I was disappointed from the outcome. didn't even baked all of the batter. will not make them again.

This website has yet to let me down!  I read other reviews and added the extra cup of flour.  Very dry dough, so I added maybe  1/4 C milk to make the dough workable.  I do not know the yield because my husband ate tons of dough before I could get it into the oven.  FABULOUS cookies!  This is a new go to :)

This is the very best cookie recipe. I have made it at least 75 times. Lol. The only changes I made were 2 sticks of butter and 3 eggs. I am making them tonight for my son in law to take to a work Christmas luncheon. Our family LOVES this recipe.

I made these and they are absolutely amazing. I did make a few changes though. When I made the dough as written, it wasn't very dough-like, so I added 1/2 cup of flour as other reviews recommended.  I also chilled it for about an hour to help with the spreading people talked about. They turned out great! Chewy, not flat at all, and they taste like actual brownies. A+

These came out delicious but i did tweak the recipe a bit. To begin with I halved it, added about 1/4 cup brown sugar and used one whole egg and one egg yolk. I also added a half teaspoon of baking powder along with the half teaspoon of baking soda after reading that people had experienced their cookies spreading in the oven. I didn't add chocolate chips because I didn't have any, but i'm sure that would have been good as the dough isn't overly sweet. Rather I cracked a little bit of pink himalayan salt after spooning them on the pan, and baked them in a dark nonstick after refrigerating the dough for about 30 minutes.

So amazing! Crispy on the outside and fudgey in the middle! I have been using recipes on allrecipes.com for years but this was actually the first recipe that made me create an account. They're that good!! Be aware though, this makes a HUGE batch! I'm ashamed to admit that between me, my husband, and three kids, they still only lasted 24 hours! These cookies are soooo good!!

I followed the suggestions of adding an additional cup of flour and have made these cookies a number of times.  I had added Hersey's Sea Salt Caramel chips, Reese's peanut butter chips, mini m&m's and every time they turn out perfect.  They are soft and chewy and so so delicious.   Our friends and family love them.

Made these exactly as written and they are so good!  With my oven, cook time was about 10 minutes and then I let them sit on pan for few more minutes.  If you try to take them off pan right away they fall apart.  There is no need to add extra flour unless you want them fluffier and more cake like.

I made these as written using gluten free flour. The dough was very sticky so I added more flour, not sure how much, I sprinkled until I got the right consistency.  Baking time was perfect at 9 minutes and they were delicious. Perfect for chocolate lovers!

Ok lots of reviews say they changed the flour, the sugar and/or the cocoa powder. I was at a loss of what to do. So I just added 1/4 cup flour- here is what I found. Thin cookies that even when cooled kind of fall apart. That being said they are delicious, although very sweet (even for a cookie).  I did add mini Reese's pieces on top.

It was very sweet and dry, maybe I did something wrong. It wasn't trash but I didn't enjoy it.

Delicious and rich cookies. I made one batch (12 cookies) in tablespoons and the rest in tea spoons to an astounding result of 55 cookies. that's way too much for me and my family, if I made this recipe again I would half it. 

I followed the proportions as listed and they were delicious. it does produce a dense cookie, but if you cook it long enough it isn't mushy. I made enough batches to tinker with cook times and I settled on 10 minutes. 9 and the cookies were to mushy 11 and they would fall in the oven and be a tad to dry for my taste.

I recommend this recipe for a bake sale or another event where you need a lot of cookies. enjoy!

They aren't very good. We saw that the dough was not very thick so we added 1/2 cup more flour and they were still very thin. They spread out so much it was a puddle of brownie.There wern't even spaces between them! They were very flaky and crumbled when you ate them. They tasted like nothing with a hint of chocolate, sugar, and ashes. they were extremely under cooked at 10 min. They took TWO  hours to make, and 15 seconds to see the mistake... We chose the wrong recipe in looking for good cookies. we would advise people not to use this in the past, present, or future.

Favorite chocolate cookie recipe!!!  I didn't have chocolate chips on hand so I went on without them and they turned out delicious!  Will try them once with chocolate chips but I have feeling I'll prefer it without them.

Thanks for sharing this recipe Linda. I added a little more flour to give it a more fluffy consistency and added semi-chocolate chips and peanutbutter chips. I cut back on the amount of sugar because I put in 2 cups of chips. Made them yesterday along with Ameretti cookies and they're almost all gone. My family loves them!

When I put it in the oven, after about 5 or so minutes, they looked like whoopee pie cookies. I couldn't wait to taste them, but they were extremely soft when I took them out of the oven. I was going to put them back in, but they looked a little crisp on the outside, so I knew they were done. After a bit, they sunk down into flat, chewy cookies and were not as soft to the touch. 
I was a little disappointed, because they looked so good in the picture. But they were still great!

Big thanks to Linda for this awesome recipe! I'm glad I read the review, and added half a cup more flour into the batter. The cookies turned out great with crispy crunch on the outside, while soft and chewy on the inside. This is by far my favourite dark chocolate cookies recipe.

Amazing chocolate cookies!! I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips, and it turned out super yummy. My first batch I overbaked because they looked like they weren't done yet and left them in an extra minute. They came out a little more crispy but still really good! The next batch I took out at 8.5 minutes and they were sooo good! Adding this to my own Recipe collection :-) Definitely make these if you are craving chocolate, or if you are a chocolate lover!

Oh  my - these are probably the best cookies I've made in my life (and I've made thousands of cookies).  They were so soft and gooey in the middle - even after cooling.  They held their shape while remaining chewy/cakey.  Very rich but not overwhelming.  They sold out in the first 5 minutes of the bake sale.  These are now in my go-to cookie rotation and will remain there.

 I did read the other reviews about the dough being wet and a little sweet so I found the 'most helpful' modifications based on 'heart' ratings..

The mods were pretty minor.  Decrease sugar by 1/4 cup.  Add 1/3 c. flour. Increase cocoa to 1 c.

I made these cookies for Valentines day since it calls for plenty of chocolate. What better thing is there to bake some chocolate chocolate chip cookies? Nothing really! I followed the recipe and they turned out great! I scooped the dough using a normal spoon instead of a tiny tea spoon so I was worried that the dropped dough was a little too big but they came out the perfect size. I'll make these again for sure!

I give these  5 stars although I did have to make small adjustments based on reviews. Like others, I did add a half cup of flour which I feel was necessary. I may even add 3/4 cup next time. The batter was extremely thick so I added 3 Tablespoons of milk to thin it a bit. I made 20  large cookies using a 1/4 cup measurement. I used one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of walnuts which made for a nice filling. After dropping them, i pressed down on each to spread them a bit before baking. At this size, they can be very soft if you don't let them bake long enough. I found that 19 minutes produced the best result. If they are too soft they do remind you of brownies. They are very tasty, chewy on the edges and soft in the middle!

I read the reviews and changed two things. One I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar anymore would have been too sweet. Two i added 1/4 cup extra flour.  The mixture a bit dry, but the cookies came out great. Cooked them for nine minutes and you have to let them cool completely.

I substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil for some of the butter, and about 1/4 cup brown sugar for some of the white sugar . It probably didn't make much of a difference in taste from the original recipe... 

it was amazing!!! I made it for a friend's birthday and she really loved it. Totally recommend this recipe to anyone :)

These were really chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, and were a big hit, twice.  I did add a half cup extra of flour.

These are so good!! I had to restrain myself from eating the dough so that I could actually make them!!
I halved the recipe because I was rationing ingredients for my big Christmas-cookie-baking-spree, and they turned out very well. The cookies turn out  huge!! They expand a lot when they are cooked, so make sure you place them plenty far away from one another, and be sparing with your scoops!
I think these would also be wonderful with white chocolate chips, which may be what I try to do next time I make these. And there will definitely be a next time!! These are wonderful!! :)

This is a very good recipe for a basic chocolate cookie.  I was looking for just the basics to make some changes to please everyone in my family.  I cut the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups and then added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I increased the flour by 1/4 cup.  I used 8 oz. pkg. of mint  M&Ms ( red & white for Christmas) and 6 oz. of mini chocolate chips instead of the 2 cups chocolate chips.  They came out soft and chewy, extreme chocolate, nice mint flavor without being over-powering.   Everyone loved them.

I followed recipe but increased to 1 1/2 Times the recipe.  I then added 1/2 & 1/2 till a little over moist, then added what probably was about 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup coco.  I then added the smallest amount of baking powder and a literal pinch of salt to help (from America's test kitchen) and they were soft tending towards crunchy but still "chewy".  I added butterscotch chips, tried coconut, both great.   Would like to find cherry and almond extracts or mint .  (I would do 4.5 if could, I haven't found my "tweak" yet)

I think maybe the recipe is supposed to say a stick and a quarter of butter, not a cup and a quarter.  Anyway, when made as the recipe is written, the cookies come out absolutely flat - no height to them whatsoever - and very, very greasy.

These unfortunately came out very flat. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm thinking maybe it's because I put half butter and half vegan butter alternative in the mix (I ran out). The few that did try to rise, once they came out of the oven they instantly deflated. Very crunchy, no softness and some of them, they were so flat they just fell apart. Gonna say these didn't work out so well for me but I'm giving it three stars in case it is actually my fault with the butter.

My dough was too soft and the cookies ran and came out like little mushy pancakes. I may try this again and add more flour because the flavor was very good. The only change I made was to use pumpkin spice chips instead of chocolate chips.

Holy-cow, these are good! They are exactly what we were looking for to  cure our craving for chocolate.  Don't forget lots of cold milk for dunking once you are done.

Followed the recipe exactly and they were fabulous. Make sure to remove them from the oven at 8 minutes and let them cool some on the sheet before you take them off. They are very nice to eat when  warm and only improve once they've cooled. If possible to give them 10 stars here, we would! Just be prepared for the cookie dough to be quite moist--putting it in the  'fridge to rest  between batches was helpful.

I made these for the county fair and took 1st place.  Here is what I changes, based on other reviewers and what I had on hand:  Increased flour to 2.5 cups, used half butter and half coconut oil, was a little generous with the cocoa and added a cup of shredded coconut.  Very nice texture - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  A delicate cookie, but not falling apart.

Very delicious, chewy ,soft and little crunchy edges. Made as written except added 1/2 cup of flour and use 1/4 cup less sugar.
I used a small scoop and silmat on cookie sheet ,let cool completely. Also added pecans.
May try peanut butter chips next time. This will be my go to recipe for brownie cookies.

They were flat and burnt after eight minutes. We tried a second batch and checked on them minutely but after two minutes they were extremely flat.

These cookies are by far the best I've ever made! They are absolutely delicious! The only thing I had to do different was I added about a 1/4 cup of milk because the dough was to dry. I think next time I make these instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I'll use a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of peanut butter pieces. Awesome recipe, thanks!

4 stars as I modified it a bit:
2 sticks of butter (less than called for)
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
They were amazing. The whole batch was gone in one night....gave a bunch away so we wouldn't eat them all :)

I absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted one cup of sugar with a cup of brown sugar, used M&M's instead of the choc chips and added the extra cup of flour and made mini cookies for a kids b-day party. Total success! The yield was about 100 mini cookies.

These cookies tasted good but they were not chewy at all. I followed the advice of others and added a quarter cup more flour to the mix. I also found the mix very dry so I added a half a cup of milk to it.
Bottom line: These cookies were delicous, but in my case, they were not chewy.

I substitute a few ingredients, such as vegan butter and carob powder.  Vegan butter is sticky, so I added about tbsp of water.  Instead of eggs I used flax seed and water.  I left out the chocolate chips.

Halved this recipe (forgot to add the chips) and baked in a 9 inch glass pie plate for around 22 minutes at 350. Everyone loved them. We've tried them with the chips and they are better without.

perfect cookies! I added about half a cup of flour extra after reading a few reviews and they were out of this world!

GREAT recipe! Soft and chewy and delicious!

I only had 1 cup of chocolate chips, so I used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips... very good!

I made these as the recipe said and they came out perfect. I didn't even read the reviews until after about the cookies being flat and others adding extra flour and I'm glad I didn't. I don't know if it matters but I used all organic ingredients. Perfect chocolate fix!

This recipe was great, I thought it seemed like too much sugar so 
I made it with 1 3/4 Cup. and it was perfect. No trouble with the cookies going flat at all and I did not add any more flour. Actually 
I found the dough pretty dry and it didn't need any extra flour. 
Sub. choc. chips with mint or mini m&m's and it's a nice surprise. 
Awesome cookie though they are not chewy even if you underbake them slightly. Still darn good!

These cookies were delicious and all the girls at work devoured them. People were astounded that they weren't from a box. I did increase the flour a little bit and I also ended up burning two batches (oops!) but that's just because I got preoccupied. 
The batter is the best part and it was super hard not to finish the bowl!

These turned out AWFUL! I even added more four as other reviewers said and it's like they flattened out and disintegrated. I even added more flour after the first few batches of that nonsense and they just crumbled into nothing. I consider myself a pretty experienced baker. What a waste of ingredients.

I love these cookies, but I didn't make it the way it said, only because I have made these cookies before and they are always flat. I followed the recipe except I only put in half a cup of peanut butter chips; half cup of dark chocolate chips; 1 and 1/4 cups of old fashioned oatmeal; 1 cup of flaked coconut and they turned out moist and chewy and fat not flat.....also made another batch but I ran out of peanut butter chips, so I added a cup of peanut butter and only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and they  turned out just as good as the first batch...amazing

Ok so I used this recipe as a base. I added a half cup extra flour as suggested, kept the same amount of sugar and used crisco instead of butter. The dough was kind of tough to deal with at the end so I also added a splash of milk. To make it my own, I put some crushed thin mint crunch bars and a packet of land o lakes raspberry hot cocoa into the dough as well. All 33 cookies went before they were cooled.

LOVED these cookies! I ended up making them two nights in a row they were such a hit! I did add an extra quarter cup of flour, about a tablespoon of vegetable oil, and omitted the chocolate chips. Also, I just put in a full cup of cocoa powder to make a darker chocolate cookie. My boyfriend thanks you for posting this recipe!

These were yummy, a big hit with my family. I got way less than 48 cookies, though. I can imagine 48 cookies would be tiny. I only got about 18 decent sized cookies out of my batch.

So easy to make..so easy to eat!  Excellent cookie recipe.  Very chocolatey.  Only thing I changed was to use 1 C. butter 1/4 C. margarine (because I ran out of butter) and they were perfect.

Yum yum! I found these cookies absolutely delicious, but instead of using 2 CUPS (thats a bit much...) of chocolate chips i used a couple of mint aero bars. not only did this save money but it also came out deliciously minty and gooey!! :D ...the first time i made these cookies they turned out a little flat so the 2nd time i used 1 CUP all-purpose flour and 1 CUP self-raising instead of 2 CUPS all-purpose.............i loved this recipe and my 3rd batch is in the oven right now! ;D ;D thanks soo much :)

Wonderful! I didn't add a whole extra cup of flour, but I just eye balled the batter and added a few more tablespoons. They came out perfectly! So soft, so rich, and just each cookie just melts in your mouth! The kind you need milk with! Yum! I WILL be making this cookie again!

These were so yummy - just what I was looking for.  I am a cookie snob, and very picky.  I didn't add extra flour and I thought they were great.  I did use my Silpat to bake them on.  Not sure if that made a difference in how they baked up.  Another batch is in the oven right now!

I wish I had read some of the reviews here before trying out the recipe. My cookies came out really flat! Having said that, I'll still make them again (with more flour to make them stay fat and thick) because it was real simple and delicious! Super chocolately!

These cookies had the flavor I was looking for, but despite following the recipe exactly, they did not turn out.  I was looking for a flat, chewy cookie, but not that flat.  They turned into one big cookie in the oven.  I did put the rest of the batch in a small cake pan and baked for about 40 min and it turned into a great brownie type treat!  I am giving this recipe 3 stars just because they had a good flavor.

very tasty!  But, as the other reviewers stated, they are very flat and I ended up with one huge cookie because i didnt leave enough space in between them.  we prefer our cookies to be flat, so they were very good, but not very attractive.

Great cookies.   I thought the dough was WAY too soft to make good cookies.  I was wrong.  The cookies were soft and delicious.   Be sure to let them cool completely once out of the oven or they will fall part in your hands.

I cut back on the sugar slightly and the flavor is excellent; they are very chewy but they need a little extra flour.  Will try with nuts and marshmallows for rocky road cookies.

A delicious cookie that was ravenously devoured by my entire family! I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and they turned our great!

These cookies are perfect - clean and crispy on the outside, delicious, soft and gooey inside.

These are absolutely DIVINE!  Super duper chocolatey, and just perfect!!  This is definitely a keeper.  The only thing I modified, was I used butter flavor Crisco, instead of real butter.  They're fluffy, gooey and decadent!

Amazingly, I had all the ingredients for this recipe, so I decided to make it (and the all the good reviews were a great indication as well). I've got to admit that these are the best looking cookies i've ever made! They look incredibly proffesional, and my friend even asked me where I had bought them! On the down side, I found the taste to be too chocolatey. Next time, I won't add the chocolate chips. It adds too much of a gooey taste. It was also difficult to stir with the flour, but I got through it. Overall, this recipe was great, and I can definitely see why people love it. :D

Very good cookies.  I used half peanut butter morsels and half milk chocolate morsels, and they turned out very good.  I did make the mistake of thinking they were not done after 9 minutes because they were very moist so I baked them an additional 90 seconds.  They turned out a little crispier than I like, but still very good.  I think they would have been perfect if I had taken them out at 9 minutes and just let them cool.

Very Good - hard to stir after you add in all the flour, but well worth it. I added the chocolate chunks which to me, made them more exciting than the regular morsels.

I too had the problem of really flat cookies, but they still tasted great! I substituted Reese's Pieces for the chips.  Next time, I'll add a little more flour and refrigerate the dough.

Do not overcook!  And if they turn out flat, try adding just a little more flour - not too much or they won't flatten out at all.  
Tonight I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I added about 1/2 pkg of cinnamon chips and oh boy!  I'm going to be sick because I can't stop eating them :)

I'm going to agree with SoulfoodSara on these--they turn out pretty flat I think. Even so, the taste is really chocolately and very good.

These were great!  I freaked out at first because they were really soft coming out of the oven but they firmed up nicely.  You definitely do not want to overbake these.  My husband loved them which is always a good sign.

I really LOVE these cookies...taste like chocolate cookies you buy in the malls ( cookie factory).  I usually have a tough time mixing all the flour, but it's well worth it .  If you LOVE very rich chocolate taste this is for you.

These turned out wonderfully!  Very soft and chocolatey.  I made a few substitutions... I replaced one cup of sugar with one cup of Splenda.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs and I omitted the chocolate chips altogether.  My version is a little healthier and lower cal (about 70 cals per cookie) and very tasty!  Will definitely make these again.

I used one cup semi-sweet chips and one cup chocolate chips - they were great.  I really liked these and I got many compliments from others.  They were on the flat-er side, but definitely not skinny - perfect for me.

First the good news! My husband ADORED these! I on the other hand did not! I followed the recipe EGGS-actly  and these cookies are WAY too sweet! The worst part is they do not cook in the center. They taste like cookie dough~GOOEY~ in the center. They look flat and not very attractive. I prefer full rounded cookies. These look over~cooked but of course they are not. Not the greatest but like I said my husband thought they were terrific. I rate 3 stars on account of my hubby.

I changed 2C sugar to 3/4C white sugar & 1C brown sugar.  Also 2C reeses pieces instead of choc. chips. 
Wonderful recipe - almost like Otis's.  Thanks Linda!!

I made these last night. I had to bake them a little bit longer than the recipe said, but still a very good cookie. Thanks for sharing, Linda! My husband loves them.

Yup - they were great.  I left them for a baby shower.  When I returned, they were gone.  I used white choc. chips instead.  And I addedd 1 tpsb for ground coffee for a mocha flavor.  They didn't taste "mocha-y", but it added a nice subtle flavor.

Everytime I make these cookies I get raves.  For a change sometimes I put in peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.  They are always chewy and delicious.

OVERALL: a great cookie, except one complaint.. its way too sweet.. i'm thinking that if i use about 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups it will probably not be as sweet....
but these cookies are moist and chewy... very good!!!

It was easy to do. The ingredients were around my house. The cookies taste great and are soft. 
The only thing that is bad about these cookies......they are very flat! Oh Well the taste makes up for it!
Good Recipe!!

These cookies were FANTASTIC! I wowed my all of co-workers, and believe me, that bunch is a tough one! They loved these cookies so much, many asked for the recipe! I have gone through many recipes and many cookie disasters before I found this JACKPOT, and that was even my first shot with this recipe. I've had a perfect batch everytime since!

These cookies are about the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  They were very easy and soooo good.
