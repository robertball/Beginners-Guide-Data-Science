Try this instead:  2 pkgs cream cheese (1/3 less fat is great), 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 pkg Ranch Dressing Mix, 3 stalks of chopped green onions and only 1/2 of a beer.  Mix with a handheld mixer and chill for 2 hours in refrigerator.  I promise you that this dip is awesome and I'm required to bring it to all parties!

I was so excited to make this recipe.  There was way too much beer, it was more like a soup.  It also tasted pretty bad.  It went right into the trash - was not viable at all.

What a waste of beer!  I had high hopes for this, but like another reviewer this came out like soup and it went right into the trash.  A complete waste of ingredients.  There was no way to save it.  Absolutely awful - don't waste your time or money.

i had to tweak this recipe a bit to suit my style, but it turned out fanTAStic!  i used only half a can of beer (the secret is to add and mix the beer slowly, a little at a time until you reach the desired taste and consistency), and added a large handful of shredded cheese, as well as some chopped green onions.  i agree to also let it chill for at least an hour because the beer makes it pretty runny, but firms up quickly in the fridge.  i was kind of leery at first, but one taste changed my mind.  this was the hit of our UFC 100 gathering!

I also mix in about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and green onions and then top the dip with some of the green onions for a nice finish- I love it!

Loved this recipe!  I did take other users' advice and added 3 green onions, some garlic (to taste) and 1/2 a bottle of beer (6 oz).  I also used a stronger pale ale like Sierra Nevada, gives a great kick!  I used Hoegaarden beer and everyone loved it too.. I had 3 recipe requets the first time out.  This is a keeper and will be at many more parties with me!!

This one was okay for us.  Pretty salty.  Scaled it back to 12 servings- used a bit less than half a beer. It did need something (wish I had a green onion) so I added a handful of shredded cheddar and a sprinkling of red Thai rub.

Completely agree with KimM's recommendation... I also find it helpful to use the beer at room temperature

I followed the other reviewers advice and added shredded cheese and green onions.  I made this again for a St. Patrick's party and used Dubliner cheese and Guiness.  I took it a step further and heated everything through in a crock pot on low.  It was a good warm dip with beer bread.  The flavors are strong, but everyone really liked it.

Its awesome. My advice, make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour after you make it. It is very salty btw, for anyone who's watching sodium intake.

This is really good, but I changed it a little bit. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, half of the ranch powder and double the amount of beer. I used Miller 64 to try to cut out a few more calories. It has to sit out for a while to be soft enough to dip things in. I used "Everything" Pretzel crackers. It was great, lots of compliments.

I served this at a football party and it was just "ok"
People said it was just Ranch Dip with a hint of beer...meaning, just eat your ranch dip and stick to drinking your beer.

This was actually quite good. Perhaps the previous reviewer used only 1 package of cream cheese instead of 2? I did not find it too liquidy at all.

Made 12 serving recipe. Used some ranch sauce and some italiano powder. Added a bit less lager beer because used whipped cream cheese  ( easy to mix ) Added 2 handfulls of grated mozzarella cheese. It was strong so ended up using also as kind of marinade and warmed it up in microwave with ground beef for the man. He enjoyed it. One time try kind of recipe for me. It was a hit for #Nationalbeerday.

I have made this and it is always requested. I actually got the recipe from a tavern that serves food and this is always on their salad bar served with crackers and bread.  Excellent!!!
