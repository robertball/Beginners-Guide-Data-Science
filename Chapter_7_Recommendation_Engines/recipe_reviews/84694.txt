I used turkey bacon and reduced fat cream cheese. I think this makes a better spread than it does a dip, for us anyway. Next time, I think I'll try this with half reduced sour cream and then try it as a dip. NOTE: The longer it sits, the better it gets.

My husband LOVED this.  I made a couple changes.  First, it was way too much for a first taste, so I did a 6th of the recipe, which was a very manageable amount - made about 1 cup or a little more.  I also added some sour cream (maybe 1/2 cup?) to make it a little less thick.  I did the bacon, but I don't think it changed the flavor all that much. I'd probably leave it out next time, just to save time and money.

This dip was way too strong tasting, even for me.  Not having had leeks before, I understand that this is unfair but be careful....

This is the best leek dip I've ever had.  Once you start eating it you can't stop!

This was good, but I used only half the leeks called for and and still found the onion flavor a bit sharp.  Next time I may try carmelizing the leeks before mixing them into the dip.  Also, I thought this dip was beter warmed up than served chilled.

Really good recipe.  I found the amount of leeks to be too many, but that might have been my fault - it was my first time using them. I have sinde learned that you are only supposed to use the white parts, which I did not, so I just eye-balled the amount that I actually used.  Also, used real bacon pieces instead of frying bacon for this dip...
It really was good... I can't wait to make it again!

I'm fairly new to (raw) leeks; perhaps that's why we didn't like this recipe.  Even my husband who will eat pretty much anything, wouldn't eat this.  It is VERY strong, VERY strong!
