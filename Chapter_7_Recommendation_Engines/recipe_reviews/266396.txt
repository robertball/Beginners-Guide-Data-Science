I used Mexican seasoning instead of the chili powder and it was wonderful. The only way to make this type of corn.

Yummy!!  This corn was delicious. I’m going to keep it in the fryer for another 2 minutes next time to make the corn a bit softer.   Very good!

Great! The only thing I did different was add a little smoked paprika to give a bit of a smokey flavor. I will make this again!

My daughter's eyes lit up and said, I've never tasted anything like this before (that's a good thing). I forgot to add the cilantro at the end, but it was still delicious.  Will make again
