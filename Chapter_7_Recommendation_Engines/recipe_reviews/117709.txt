We love this recipe so much that I've made a big jar full of the dry seasoning blend (I just multiplied the amounts by 16 or something like that), and I mix up batches in no time flat.  The only thing I have added is 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the original recipe because we like our sausage a little bit spicy.  Without it, I think it would be too bland (personal taste).  I make 10 patties out of a 1.2 lb package of lean ground turkey, and they hold together perfectly well.  I imagine that the extra-lean would be too crumbly.  I make these patties ahead of time and freeze them between layers of waxed paper.  Thawing and cooking them up in the morning is a snap!

Loved this recipe for its' simplicity and great taste!  I didn't have the ginger spice so I substituted 1/4 teaspoon cummin instead and added cayenne pepper (I like it a little spicy too).  I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon but will try 1/4 teaspoon next time.  I have a feeling I could eliminate the salt altogether because of the cummin and cayenne.

I made this for my family.  My boyfriend is a pork sausage lover .. and he raved and raved and raved about this turkey breakfast sausage.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I added a dash of crushed pepper flakes.

I picked this recipe because I was looking for one that didn't have cayenne pepper. I used a 2 oz mini burger mold and got 7 good sized patties. I added 2 Tblsp. of real maple syrup, because I also like a sweeter tasting sausage. I left out the black pepper in the recipe, because I don't care for it, and everyone just sprinkle their own on at the table. This was absolutely delicious! I served with pancakes and it made a great tasting breakfast this morning. Thank you submitter. I already have it planned again for next weekend.

My husband and I have tried several homemade breakfast sausage recipes and have decided that this one is the best!  We love the simplicity of the recipe and the great taste.  I did make some adaptations - added 1/2 tsp. chili powder (we like savory/spicy sausage), about 1/2 tsp. dill weed, an extra 1/4 tsp. of pepper and substituted sage with savory.

Absolutely wonderful. I was amazed at how much this tasted like pork sausage! The only thing I did differently was to add a 1/2 tsp. sugar, a shake of rosemary, and some crushed red pepper flakes. I doubled the amount, but I wish now that I had tripled it! I saved most of it for my Thanksgiving cornbread and sausage stuffing. A keeper for sure!

I practically eliminated the salt and substituted in cumin. Next time I will up cumin and sage, and maybe add minced ginger instead of powdered ginger. Overall pretty good. UPDATED: fennel seeds make ground turkey taste like sausage!!

I had no idea how simple it was to make your own sausage!  After reading the ingredients on many of the prepackaged sausages I decided it had to be better to make my own.  It was super easy and good!  I made this recipe and another one from the Whole Foods website and while both were good, I decided to combine the two and got a GREAT sausage.  To this recipe, I added an egg, and 1 apple finely chopped with excess liquid squeezed out.  VERY GOOD!

This is so easy and so good. Not quite enough salt for my personal taste but I am not going to rate less than 5 stars for salt. The fisrt thing I made with this sausage was breakfast burrito's. scrambled the sausage, scrambled some eggs, used a piece of 2% Kraft american cheese and some piccata sauce. My husband said it was his new favorite breaskfast. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Really good!  I would do just a bit less ginger next time for my taste but over all it was very nice.  Husband loved it and said I could make it any time.  Added a few red chili flakes since I like spicy sausage.

I added just a little crushed red pepper, a scant amount really, and just a touch of Splenda brown sugar blend. I only used MAYBE 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt, only because we're watching our salt intake. This was great and much healthier than the pork sausage I usually buy. NOTE: This makes SIX small patties, not eight.

These are really tasty and easy to make!  I made some to freeze, but I tried one of them, and it tastes pretty close to the pork sausage we usually get, except it's not loaded with all the salt. Good recipe!

My husband is allergic to pork, so I've been looking for an alternate sausage for some time.  Commercial turkey breakfast sausage is just too bland.  This recipe is easy and tasty.  The only real change I'll make is to add a bit more sage, and mix it up on Saturday night, then let it sit in the fridge overnight to be cooked on Sunday morning.  Thanks for sharing!

I make this recipe by the pound, and then freeze it, or keep it crumbled for scrambles. The only think I do differently is add 1/2 tsp. garlic. Great recipe!

This recipe was so simple and delicious.  My husband and four year old both loved up and ate it up.  I made the recipe exactly as indicated except I used ground sage instead of rubbed (not sure what rubbed sage is and didn't see it in the spice isle)  I did triple the recipe and froze the patties..for easy future breakfast..a definite keeper and so much healthier than the frozen turkey sausages I usually buy (nothing processed here) YUM!

I combined these ingredients the night before so the flavors would "mesh" like regular sausage. I doubled the sage and pepper and also added red pepper flakes. Next time, I will use 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes so it will be more evenly distributed. I browned the sausage in the skillet, added a little butter and turned this into sausage gravy (just used a package with milk since there isn't grease to bornw flour in like with pork sausage) After it simmered for two hours, I served it to my family over biscuits and nobody knew it was turkey instead of pork!! I'll definitely do this again sometime to save all that saturated fat. I recommend it to anyone!

These are great as written! I used ground sage, not sure if it's the same as "rubbed" but I followed the recipe as written and then I made 12 links because it would be easier to pass off links with the kids and I needed to divide equally between the six of us. These are just as good dipped in maple syrup as the pork links are! Yummy!

I was skeptical of this, but it really is good.  And the kids liked it too!  The only problem I had was the "mess" in preparing it - since it doesn't have any fat to hold it together!

We really did not like this recipe.  I made it exactly according to the recipe except I cut the salt down a little because other reviewers suggested it is not necessary.

My husband and I found them to be bland, dry, and smelling only of turkey.  If I were to make this again I would double the spices and add something for moisture such as bread crumbs soaked in egg beaters.

I really was disappointed - we so badly wanted this recipe to work out.  I had to put hot sauce on mine just to make it edible!

This is by far my new favorite recipe! I have made it several times in the last few weeks and it keeps getting better and better! I have always used the 1.25lb package of ground turkey (not the super lean) therefor I increase the spices just a tad. Add a little crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick and its even better. I accidentally doubled the rubbed sage on my last batch and the flavor was very good. I think I will do that from now on. It's great in patties or crumble for breakfast casserole or burritos.

so much healthier than those at the market.  easy to make and great as written.  Much better with a little extra sage and the rubbed is stronger than the dried leaves.  I like a little red pepper flakes too.  You can take this any way you want to suit your taste or leave as is for delicious, healthy sausage.  Thanks for the guidance!

I'm totally blind. I say this now because it was this that caused me to accidentally thaw out a pound of ground chicken instead of ground turkey. Rather than refreeze already thawed meat, I decided to take a chance with the chicken. The results were, to say the least, much better than I'd expected with the mixup in the meat. The recipe itself was very easy and extremely flavorful, and I'm totally sold on it. Definitely one that I'll be making again, with chicken or turkey.

I made this today (half recipe because I only had 1 lb of turkey). The half recipe yielded 12 patties that are 2" round and 1/2 wide.  I didn't read the reviews beforehand so I didn't increase the seasoning,  they weren't seasoned enough for my taste.  I would atleast double the seasoning next time and perhaps add other seasonings and flavorings.  Also, they have a turkey burger texture which I don't care for but is not surprising.  Thanks Judy for sharing your recipe.

My family really liked this sausage. I'll be mixing up more this afternoon. We were surprised how much it tastes like store bought pork sausage. It even shrinks up the same way when cooked. To make sure the flavors absorbed well, I let it sit overnight in the fridge before making it into patties with a hamburger press. Good stuff!

This is just ok until you add 2 tbsp of maple syrup like one reviewer said.  I made it as written but after cooking 6 small patties and tasting it I could tell it needed the maple syrup.  Its subtle but adds a juiciness and flavor that is otherwise lacking.  Will make again and again.  Does not taste like turkey, my non dieters were surprised!

Don't skimp on the salt, you need it!  A little cumin and fennel seed make this taste very much like pork breakfast sausage.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke to kick up the flavor even more.  Make sure your patties are pressed thinly.  Use extra lean meat and saute in a little olive oil to swap out the bad fats for the good.  This stuff is great crumbled up with some scrambles eggs or egg substitute, a little low-fat cheese, and some veggies all crammed into a whole wheat pita.  Yum!

This was very good.  I did use fresh sage, and probably tripled the amount.  I, also, added some maple syrup & crushed red pepper.  After seasoning, I let the ground turkey sit in the refrigerator for several hours before cooking.  I put a little vegetable oil in the pan and had the temp on med-high, so that the sausage got a little caramelized.  It really tasted like sausage.  My husband and I were so surprised!

Hey Guys...while I do not eat meat/poultry, my family does...so this rating is based on their response to the dish. I bought some sage ground turkey from my local Amish market this weekend, because it looked interesting. Of course, since I have never used this type of ground turkey, I was not sure what to do with it. I knew that I could come here and find something, and I did! Everyone loved it. My husband was surprised to hear that I made it myself, because it tasted so much like regular turkey sausage. So, thanks for the recipe. This will be one of my regulars.  :)

Fantastic taste. Only made one change -- added panko because the turkey was too moist to stick together properly.

This is awesome.  I used 99% fat free which was a little dry, but the flavor was great!  I think a 7% would be perfect.

I made a couple changes for my own taste.  I used 1 tsp. Fresh ginger and 1/2 tsp. old bay for pepper and Italian ground turkey.  Thanks for the idea

I love this sausage recipe! Definitely decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp or less, and I also added 3/4 tsp Cajun seasoning for some spice.

This was a wonderful homemade recipe. I used whatever ground turkey I could find (organic, probably full-fat), and decreased the salt to less than 1/2 tsp (I figure everyone gets too much salt in their diets). The only problem I had was that my turkey didn't crumble and neatly combine into patties...more like it all squished together into blobs. But they cooked well and tasted delicious! It made 9 very small patties...we ate 2 each and could have had more.

Wow! I never thought that making my own sausage could be so easy. This recipe is perfect, my whole family loved it. I love that is was easy, quick and healthy. I wasn't too sure about the ginger because I'm usually not a fan but I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be more pleased. Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

If I'd known how easy it was to make my own turkey sausage, I would have avoided tossing out the over-salted, greasy products I've been buying. Thank you Judy. This recipe is perfect. I only regret not adding more red pepper, just a wee bit more for me and it would have tasted like my Louisiana family sausage. I am going to experiment with the seasoning quantities but not changing the ingredients at all. Texture in sausage is so important and this recipe gets five stars in all areas.

Love it! I will be making these again. I will probably play with the spices a bit, but otherwise it's really good.  This time around I added fennel seed. Realy yummy.

This tasted like turkey burgers. I even added more seasonings halfway through making them after I had tasted one that was done. Sorry, but it was not good!

Loved it.  So simple to make.  I mixed up the sausage ingredients a day before I wanted to make it, so the flavors would blend.  I like that this is made with ground turkey.

Great alternative to buying at the store. I have adapted the recipe to no salt and less pepper per my taste but its a great recipe.

Love this recipe! I added extra sage and some crushed red pepper. I like it a little spicier.

Thanks for sharing!
