I find it annoying when people rate a recipe that they have changed beyond recognition of the original, but I am prepared to be somewhat of a hypocrite since this recipe has not yet been reviewed.  I made an altered version of this -- maintaining the grapes, walnuts, red onion, and balsamic vinaigrette.  The flavors went well together and I added chopped chicken and some fresh thyme.  I  left out the other ingredients because I either didn't have them (radishes) or didn't think they were needed (raisins).    Ended up quite tasty.

I ended up using almost the same ingredients as the previous poster. For half the recipe I used grapes, walnuts, red onion, raisins and dressing. Omitted the green onion because it already tasted too "oniony",  and no radishes. The dressing was from another recipe from this site since I didn't have bottled dressing. Anyway, really did not like this recipe. We forced ourselves to finish it, but my mouth still tastes like onions. I hate wasting grapes and nuts and the time. Maybe it would have been better as part of a spinach salad???

Refreshing and delicious. I didn't have red onion and I used freeze dried chives instead of fresh green onion. I made a homemade raspberry vinaigrette dressing (recipe here on AR) for this and the salad turned out terrific. Thanks! I'll have to make this again sometime.
