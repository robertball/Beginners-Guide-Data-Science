I used 3 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs instead since I thought that using 2 packages wouldn't be enough.  Still, it turned out very flat... only 1.5 inches.  Very tasty, but presentation wise needed a little work since it was so flat.

For those who find that there is too much crust in this recipe, you can use 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs with about 4 tablespoons of butter instead of the original. I pressed that amount into a 9-inch tart pan and my cheesecake came out perfect. I used about 2 tablespoons less sugar in the cream cheese mixture and it was already sweet enough. It was quite difficult to get the "marbled" look because there was too much of the chocolate mixture. I would suggest mixing at most 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup of cream cheese mixture with 1 ounce of melted semi-sweet chocolate and swirling it into the rest of the cream cheese mixture.

Overall, it was yum!

Rather than marble the batter, I piped the chocolate (inject like a jelly donut) in as polka-dots. I had read about the technique and had to try it. COOL! Oh and I topped it with a lightly sweetened sour cream. To get clean slices, dip your long knife in hot water, do not dry it off. Do this between each slice you make. (great opportunity to taste it before serving it too)

The fact of the matter is that if you have to alter the main ingredients of the recipe, I don't see how it can get very many stars.  Easy to make?  Yes, but so is the boxed cheesecakes as well.  This is a thin cheesecake that would thus make it too thin to be a cheesecake. Putting half of the cheesecake with the chocolate mixture is way too much and does not allow for a good marbled affect.  I enjoyed reading the various methods of trying to create this affect.  Once again, too vital a piece of this recipe to have to alter. However, it tastes good except for all the crust.

I was very disappointed with this one. I thought it seemed like too little cream cheese when I was preparing it. There was more crust than cheesecake. It looked like a pancake when I removed it from the springform. I could never serve this for what I had intended it for.

Of course it's a thin cheesecake - you can tell that by the amount of ingredients. If you want the appearance of thicker slices, adjust the quantities accordingly. It's a very good recipe!

Flattest cheesecake ever! I see that was a common problem for reviewers and I wish that I had read that before making this cheesecake. It's about a 3rd the thickness of any other cheesecake I've made.

I would not make this again even thou it had a good taste, My family and I thought it was VERY flat and thin , more crust than cheesecake, and also took longer to bake.

I was really happy with the results from this recipe.  Since I live in a foreign country I didn't think it would work.  My challenges were expensive ingredients, different type/size of dairy products, and using a microwave oven.  Thankfully it was very good.  I used oreo cookies instead of graham crackers since we don't have those here. I added 4 tablespoons of yogurt and not as much chocolate batter (maybe 1/2) as suggested.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe Amy!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Valentines Day in the shape of a heart.  I used oreo cookie crumbs for the crust.  I have also made it iced with chocolate ganache.

I added an extra egg and extra cheese because it didn't seem to be enough.  It is not a very high cheesecake.  My husband loved it though!

This was easy to make and turned out really well.  My only complaint was too much chocolate in the marbeling (however my husband who is a chocolate lover thought it was perfect.)

I had to sub a few things because I didn't have everything on hand (cocoa powder; cake pan). Judging by previous reviews, this recipe is pretty flexible. If you're handy in the kitchen it should work for you and your experiments. Mine turned out well and the chocolate polka dots were fun to look at and tasty.

This recipe is awesomeeeee ! In spite of the small amount of cheesecake you will get, the taste is very delicious like every reviewer talked about. I actually used 3 ( 12 ounces ) of cream cheese and used 3 eggs - although the cake still not much you can get, but its just enough for me & my family since we're not one-big-slice-cheesecake-fans. We eat with desire portion - small scale. and in spite the fact that I add up more cream cheese and egg, I didn't add more sugar onto the batter, the amount of sugar remain the same with 1 tsp of vanilla extract. The taste its just what I look for, not too sweet cheesecake - more on cheese taste.

I have made this recipe 2-3 times, and it is quite delicious.  Very easy to make, and good cheesecake recipe for when you don't have sour cream on hand.  I always used my mini-springform pans (fills 2, plus a small pudding dish extra), because I didn't think it'd fill a 9 inch pan.  I have never been able to get the layers to swirl, they always just divide vanilla on bottom, then the layer of chocolate on top.  Any tips on getting it to marble?  I will keep making this recipe whenever I want to make cheesecake with chocolate, it's also good for a Valentine's Day treat in mini-springforms for dessert.  I always just use chocolate chips as the chocolate part.

Wonderful!  I used a 9" pie plate.  I dont think this would be enough for a spring pan..  I didnt taste this personally because my husband brought it to work, but called around noon and said it was gone (good sign!)  I also used an crushed oreos to make the crust.

This cake took a lot longer to bake than the recipe indicated, but that probably is because I made this cheesecake in an eight inch pan instead of the nine inch pan the recipe called for.  I took it to a potluck for my college singles group and everyone loved it.  Especially with whipped cream on the side.

This cheesecake is very easy to make and tastes great! For the lady who couldn't get it to marble...I used a spoon to put in the chocolate...making dabs all over the top, then I used a butterknife to swirl it around. I have made this a few times and everyone loves it! A big hit!

This recipe is great! I make A LOT of cheesecakes and I used this recipe as a "base" and incorporate all the types of flavors that I make and they turn out WONDERFUL every single time. The best part is that it NEVER cracks! THANKS Amy for a great, no-fail cheesecake recipe.

Gotta love it, I even won first place in a culinary contest using the basic recipe and garnishing it accordingly.  I also use a cake pan with hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven, and bake the cheesecake on the top shelf.  Very delicious indeed.

Took longer to cook than stated.  Is it possible to overcook?  My recipe was dry a little and there was too much chocolate.  If I had put in the whole cup the whole cheesecake would have been chocolate.  It was good though.

This cheesecake was quite good. I liked the fact that it only had 2 pkgs of cream cheese- a lot that I've read had 
called for 3. I also made a few changes; I had added 2 tbsp. of Kahlua liqueur to the "vanilla" part. (I removed the cup
of batter first) and I also added a few tablespoons of sugar to the crumb mixture for the crust. Great recipe- but I ate 
nearly the whole thing myself-yiiikks!! Thanks, Donna Hume

Excellant recipe! This was my first attempt at cheesecake and my family loved it. It was very easy to make and came out wonderfully. I substituted 6 T of unsweetened cocoa powder for the chocolate, with 2T of sour cream to make up for adding an extra dry ingredient (when I substitute in brownies I use melted butter as the liquid, but I didn't know what butter would do to this batter) This substitution came out well. I don't know about other people, but I always have unsweetened cocoa on hand, but never chocolate bars. I also added 2T of sugar to the chocolate mixture, to sweeten it up a tad more.

Great recipe!  Instead of making a homemade crust, I use a pre-made Oreo pie crust. The recipe works perfectly in this size crust.

Do Not Make! This cheese cake was good tasting but the ratio of cheesecake to the base was not good. There needs to be at least 3 packages of cream cheese also only half a cup of chocolate to get the marbled affect.

I will never make again. Its 1/2" high.  I will no longer trust allrecipes as they have this recipe over 4 stars. The reviews can not be  trusted.

Tasted pretty good but in order to get a good marble, use less creamcheese mixture and more chocolate in step 3!

I made this for my sorority sisters and their dates for our Valentine's Day Philanthropy Event. It was a complete hit with everyone! Next time I am doubling the recipe because it was a little too thin for my taste but considering everyone wanted the recipe it was well worth the time and effort! I paired it with a Chocolate Brownie Bundt cake I found on this website. Thanks for sharing!
