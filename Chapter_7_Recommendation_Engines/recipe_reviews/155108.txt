This was AWESOME.... A few reviewerssaid that they couldn't keep the toppings on the bread... I bought the wider italian bread, and scooped out some of the bread to make room for the fillings..  It was SOOOOooooo good...  Pleased even the toughest palates.. And the Hot Sausage.. Not a big deal..  I bought the premio links, and decased them.. and just fried it up like chop meat..   YUM!!

Oh my goodness, this is amazingly good!!! i'm giving this five stars despite the fact that i made a couple of changes, but it's just because i'm sure it would be delicious as it is stated.
I first broiled the bread for 2-3 minutes. Ok, i know this totally modifies the recipe, but i had to use hot dogs instead of hot italian sausage 'cause that's what i had on hand, but next time i'm using the hot sausage. Forgot about the black olives and increased the amount of dried oregano to 1/2 teaspoon. Also omitted the olive oil 'cause i wanted to reduce the fats, and i'll tell you i didn't miss it. We had this for dinner yesterday night and we're still raving..... Thank you thank you thank you Diane, your papa is a genius!

We used sweet italian sausage with the casing removed instead of the hot bulk pork and it was wonderful!

I really like this.  Very simple to prepare and delicious.  Also very filling.  I was going to eat this with salad, but the salad is on the bread!  I was a bit flaky when I shopped for the ingredients, as I ended up with fresh mozzarella instead of slices and regular sausage instead of hot.  I also ended up with green olives with pimentos, and looking back at the recipe, I suppose it calls for just green olives.  Anyway, I really like the combo of flavors in this and am already thinking about how to make it less messy.  It's kind of like an overtopped pizza or overstuffed sandwich--you can eat it with your fingers, but everything keeps falling off.  I like everything on this bread, and I think you really have to, because there are a lot of strong flavors!  I like how it all goes together, and I think that it would be wonderful to sub tapenade for the olives and toast the bread  first so that you could put the tapenade, the olive oil and balsamic sauce, then the sausage and the remainder of the ingredients.  I think it might make it a bit less messy and manageable.  Of course, part of it was my fault since I used fresh mozzarella and sliced it thicker than what purchased slices would be.  Still, the bread had a nice crunch on the bottom and I liked all the flavors together.  I tossed on some diced orange bell pepper I had to use it up.

This recipe is fantastic. I don't normally review recipes, but I just had to with this one.  I don't think I've ever had such a tasty meal.  I did have to modify a few things.  I didn't have bulk sausage, so I took the casing off the hot italian sausage I did have.  I used Hunt's canned petite diced tomatoes and they really added a lot of juice to it.  I also used minced garlic from a big jar I had.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! Used a wide Vienna bread loaf, sliced down the middle. Made two versions--per the recipe for my hubby and me, and with bacon and no olives for the kids. Yum! The balsamic dressing really made it something special.

Absolutely fantastic!  I, like the others, will try to find a way to make it less messy so that I can justify serving it as an appetizer.  I can't not share this wonderful recipe with as many people as I know.  I may consider making a pizza dough from scratch and just piling all the ingredients on the dough like a calzone.  Maybe cut back a little on the toppings.  Other than that I can't tarnish this one by taking any ingredient away...Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!

I took this to an appetizer get together and it was a huge success! The mixture that you drizzle over it added soooo much flavor. I used roma tomatoes and cut slices thin. I also served the olives on the side for two reasons. I have friends that do not like them and they kept falling off the bread. My mistake was buying bread that was much too large. I ended up cutting it into 4 lengthwise pieces. I will definitely make it again with different bread. It would be great on flatbread as well.

I didn't even have all the ingredients to put this together but if what I managed is only part of the flavor, this is going to be really delicious when I can do it all.

My husband really enjoyed this.  I served it as a meal.  I did do a few things different to suit his preferences though.  I used hot Italian sausage links and cut them into slices.  I also used hot peppers as well.  I used balsamic vinaigrette dressing with the chopped onion and served with a side of marinara.

This was pretty good and a great way to make pizza without having pizza/spaghetti sauce on hand. I suggest scooping out or pressing down on the middle of the bread and also cutting the amount of sausage in half. Super easy though - we'll definitely make it (or a variation thereof) again!

I made this for an italian party along with the tomato basil bread also posted on this site and everyone loved this one also.  Instead of Italian bread I used garlic bread and tosted it.  The only thing I had trouble with was keeping the olives on I think I had too much sausage on the bread.  I will definately make this again.

I used this recipe as a guidelinE, and made it like a pizza loaf. I bought Italian loaf with garlic butter spread on it. I used sweet Italian sausage, green olives with pimentos, black olives , cherry tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, roasted bell pepper, sliced red onions, large pepperoni slices and topped with fresh mozzarella and balsamic drizzle! It's absolutely fantastic! It's an easy and different way to prepare pizza loaf, with an Italian twist! I make this every two weeks as husband puts in his request!

Fantastic! I've made this several times-you can substitute the sausage with ground beef and it still turns out great! Thanks for an easy & flexible recipe.  It's a keeper for our house.

Great "fresh" flavor and not so heavy as regular "French bread pizza." The dressing throws it over the top. I did carve out some of the bread so they toppings stayed put, but otherwise no changes. Again, much lighter tasting, making the ingredients stand out.

Just finished this wonderful meal!! I used Jenny O hot turkey sausage links (out of the casing) and took some of the bread out of the loaf to hold everything. Delicious!!
