Simple dish, great for weeknight supper.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and 2 shallots to the bacon mixture for an added boost of flavor.

Entire family really looked forward to this dish but it's quite bland as written. 1-2 minutes to heat the brussel sprouts through isn't enough and while the texture is good, the flavor is a bit off-putting. I will try again with the concept but I'll do things a little differently. 1) no olive oil for the pasta 2) no saved pasta water 3) do not discard bacon grease but use to saute the brussel sprouts to create a crisp side 4) add in the mushrooms after a few minutes. Increase rosemary to a teaspoon. Add Parmesan as a topping after serving and individuals can mix in. Use a thinner pasta - maybe a spaghetti or similar.  I love the concept of this recipe but I think it just missed in the flavor department.

I love all the ingredients but somehow this was bland. I added garlic powder, maybe some extra salt would help.

I really enjoyed it and I plan on making it again.  I didn't have any Linguine so I used Fan-fair (bow-tie) noodles instead.  And I didn't have any Rosemary, so I used some of my favorite seasonings Basil and Oregano instead about a half teaspoon each.

Amazing. I didn’t have rosemary so I seasoned with Trader Joe’s Everything season and added a little Roasted  garlic seasoning and it was perfect. I omitted the olive oil as well but if you have a flavored olive oil it would be amazing. I have a roasted walnut oil I may try next time

I cut he recipe in half, as I only needed to serve two people. We still had left overs. Instead of a half pound of bacon, I did 1/2 pound of Italian sausage and 1/4 pound bacon. It turned out great!

This has become a family favorite. Even my 8 year old granddaughter loves it. I wouldn't change it a bit!

I thought this would be a light dish but possibly a bit bland. It wasn’t. The bacon grease you leave adds a ton of flavor. For 2 of us I only needed about half the pasta. I added garlic and used some shaved Parmesan as well. It was delicious.

We used turkey bacon, which meant we wound up frying the  Brussels sprouts and mushrooms in vegetable shortening and added some extra salt and Adobe seasoning to give it a bit more flavor.  Delicious, though!

The family liked this one. Reminded us of a dish we make with pasta, bacon, onions, and peppers...but we think we liked this one even better. Very good.

Proportions were off for this recipe.  You can't fit  all that food into a "large skillet."  I had to transfer the meal to a large wok to finish it, it was that much food. That said, it was tasty enough.  My kids and I all rated it at a 4.

I should have included the mushrooms because the mushroom-haters in the house didn't like this anyway. I wish they had. I'm not huge into bacon so I think I'll stick with roasting my sprouts as usual.

Used spinach noodles (which the ladies in my church make each year for our bazaar). After dishing it up, we topped it off with olive oil and Italian Seasoning. YUM! This is a keeper.

Great dish! I used angel hair pasta in place of the linguine and seasoned to my liking with oregano and basil. Thank you for the recipe!
