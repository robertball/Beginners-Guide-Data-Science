We omitted the cottage cheese, used real Ranch dressing instead of the dry packets, and this recipe was excellent. Extremely quick and easy, very pleasing to the taste!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was very good.  I halfed the recipe and omitted the cottage cheese.  The cayenne pepper adds a little kick to it.  Had this with with veggies and chips.  I recommend this one.

Warning: This makes a ton of dip and is addictive. The cottage cheese gives it a texture that is sooooo yummy (think chunks in bleu cheese dressing). I used the big container of cottage cheese 1 lb 8 oz because 8 oz was not enough. I also used a heap of the dip in mashed potatoes, very garliky and good. I used garlic powder in leiu of the garlic salt. I was worried about too much salt with the dry ranch dressing being so salty. I can't wait to make it again.

I love this dip and I have been making it for a long time.  My suggestion is to make sure that you are using the ranch "dressing" mix and not the ranch "dip" mix.  I also puree the dip because I like a more smoothe consistency.  That is just a personal preference and will differ person to person.  This is great with chips and veggies and anything else that someone may want to dip into ranch dip!

I cut this recipe in half. I used SD's dry ranch dressing mix (which is also from this site), reduced fat mayonnaise, reduced fat sour cream and "Trim" cottage cheese. Because there was garlic/onion powder in the dry ranch dressing mix, I did not add the extra garlic salt or onion powder. We thought this was quite good. I liked using the cottage cheese as it was little change up from the usual nonfat plain yogurt that I usually use in my homemade lowfat ranch dip. NOTE: I did run the cottage cheese through the blender as I have three boys who have issues with chunky cottage cheese dip and it sailed right past them.

This was ok, but very "ranch-y" tasting. I should have followed others advice and cut back on the ranch dressing mix, but I wanted to follow it exactly the first time and see. People liked it ok, but didn't love it, and I had a lot leftover. I'll cut the amt in half next time, and half again for the ranch. Cottage cheese was interesting, I used small curd and it wasn't too chunky.

I made it for a family party and everyone loved it! The only change I'll make next time to it is to only do 1 tsp. of cayenne rather than 1 1/2 tsp. It was a bit spicy for me. But very yummy!

First of all I halved the recipe, substituting finely minced onions for the onion powder and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Even still, my mother and I thought it was way too salty. The people I served this to at the meeting all seemed to love it.  I think the next time I would not use quite all of the ranch packet mix, to reduce the saltiness.  Also, per personal preference, I think I will up the cayenne a tad.

I halved all the ingredients because I didn't want that much dip... but right after mixing it up, I scooped up a big bite with a chip and it was delicious!  I can't wait to try it later after it has chilled and the flavors have had time to mingle.  I really like the added texture from the cottage cheese.  Great recipe!

This dip is the best bring-along dip ever.  I've used it twice now: for bible study and for work. I found myself without cayenne pepper tonight but it works even without the kick.

Great recipe. I received a lot of compliments. I added diced red and green onion to it as well. And I only used 1 package of dry dressing mix.

I love this! I made it for a birthday party and it was well liked.  I served with chips and veggies - it went well with both. The flavor was great and not to spicy with the cayenne, it was just right.  I will definitely make this again!

Great variation to the usual ranch dip.  I made it for a company function and it was a huge hit!! I think I will use garlic powder instead of the garlic salt next time. Great with veggies, chips and buffalo wings.

When I found this recipe I was not sure how the cottage cheese was going to turn out in the dip, but was pleasantly suprised. Next time I'll buy the small curd though. I loved the flavors and so did my guest

This was great! Made it for a group of women I had over for a jewelry party and they loved it. It makes a hugh amount so you might want to scale it down unless you have a big group to feed.

I have made this dip several times now and it's always devoured.  My 5yo begged me to make it again for him.  I leave some without the cayenne pepper for him.

My Mom use to make a dip similar to this when I was young.  It was very yummy.  Brought back memories.

Good base for a dip, except I omitted the cottage cheese and used almost 2 teaspoons of cayenne.  It gave it a perfect kick without it being too much.  It’s a staple I make for parties with sliced veggies.

This dip was fantastic!  Do not omit the cottage cheese.  I was concerned about the texture so I blended it smooth. Another reviewer pointed out that the recipe calls for packaged ranch-style DRESSING mix not the much saltier ranch DIP mix. That may be why some thought it too salty.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Perfect as is. Don't omit the cottage cheese. It  gives it body and nobody knows it is in there.
