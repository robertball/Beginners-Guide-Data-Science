I make this salad all the time! I love it! Make sure you use light or fat free mayo, regular gives it less flavor and a more greasy feel to it. I add a tad more sugar and use cider vinegar.  Another great variation is to add mandarin oranges and cranberries.

WONDERFUL!  Great on croissants.  My husband didn't think he would like the grapes (kind of a meat and potatotes guy) but he really liked it;  moreso with the grapes than without.  I didn't add the almonds this time only because I didn't have any.  This was heavy on the rice so if you prefer more chicken you may want to consider modifying the recipe accordingly.

I rated this recipe a five but i changed it all around so maybe it's not. Anyway i guessetamated the mayo/sugar/vinegar/salt and pepper, using far less than instructed. I used cashews instead of almonds, very few grapes and used a can of chicken instead of turkey. Regardless i consider this an A+ recipe

Great salad recipe.  I am extremely picking about the ingredients/flavors in salads, but this is so yummy.  The flavors are pretty mild and the ingredients go very well together.  And, it's healthy!  I substituted chicken instead of turkey, but I'm sure it tastes similar.  I also used 3/4c. of organic wild rice blend instead of a packaged mix.  The slivered almonds add great texture.  This is a nice salad to bring to a picnic or potluck too.  I will be using this many times in the future.

Very good salad...I toasted the almonds before adding it to the salad and it gave it a great flavour!

I too couldn't find just one 6oz pkg of wild rice so I measured 1cup's worth and cooked it per the directions on the bag. Also, I added a splash of lemon juice to the mayo mix and used cashews instead of almonds.  A very "summer salad" = great for the hot days we've been having around here!! Thanks Gina!

I'm only giving this a 3 star rating, but it might be my own fault it wasn't that great.  I couldn't find a 6 oz pkg of wild rice anywhere-- I mean just the wild rice-- so I used a 6 oz box of Uncle Ben's white and wild and didn't use the seasoning packet.  It was pretty good the first day, but as the week went on (I make things to take to lunch at work the whole week) it got kind of soggy.  I really wish I could have found the wild rice in the store I shop at, but maybe will have to try again and amend my rating....  It is pretty tasty the first day though.

Made as written, except I cooked the rice for almost 2 hours.  The almonds on top really made it.  It turned out really good

Good salad, but not spectacular.  Had cherries not grapes, so used cherries.  Dressing tasted bland so added 2t more vinegar and sugar which helped.

Easy, fast, good, cold dinner.  Great for summer.  I used 1/2 c low fat mayo and 1/4 c low fat sour cream.

I also substituted chicken - dropped a frozen chicken breast in with the rice. This added some flavor for the rice and gave me tender chicken to add to the salad. This is a simple and tasty recipe and great for sharing (if I can manage to leave some in the bowl...)

good but not impressed I think the meat needs to be browned in dry italian dressing to give it more flavor, and maybe add some walnuts or granny smith apples for some crunch

This is a fantastic recipe that my husband dubs "restaurant quality." I have made it just like the recipe but tonight I made it with light mayo, chicken instead of turkey and I cut up cherries instead of grapes. I served it in a warm pita and it was wonderful! It would make a nice dish for a summer party.

I would give this four and a half stars if I could. This was a very unique, satisfying alternative to other salads I have tried. I will most likely be making this again.

This was really good & a nice change from the ordinary.  Next time I think I'll add a bit of chicken stock or a bouillon cube to the water when cooking the wild rice.

I made this for myself today for lunch, and was very pleased with the results.  The only change that I made was using lemon juice instead of vinegar.  It was really good.  I wrapped the chicken mixture in bib lettuce, like a little wrap and it was really good. Oh i did make on additional change, I used sliced honey roasted almonds for a little sweet crunch.  So good, thanks for sharing this.

I love this recipe. I use chicken and use 2 cups of fruit either all grapes or 1/2 grapes and 1/2 apples, the other thing I have done that is great in this salad is to use blood orange vinegar in place of the plain vinegar. Yummmm.

Very delicious!  I used chicken instead of turkey because I am not a big turkey fan... I also use fat free mayo.  It is great on toasted bread or on it's own for a lite and healthy lunch.  It's a keeper!!

I had some left-over wild rice and found this recipe.  It was great!  Thank you.  My husband enjoyed it both as a salad, on a large piece of lettuce, and in a sandwich.  We topped it with dried cranberries each time.

Delicious salad!  I used left-over white rice, homemade vinegar and left out the onion.  Added some cranberries to the mix and next time will add mandarin oranges  suggested by another reviewer.  Will be making this one for company!

I served this at a party with small slices of pumpernickel bread and it all went.  I didn't particularly enjoy it, but everyone else did.  I omitted the green onion because I simply didn't have any and I think it would've been over the top if I hadn't.

Very good. I used chicken.  This is now my #1 way to use up extra wild rice!  Thanks!

Friends and family love it.  I use mostly organic ingrients and avoid white vinegar due to its acid content. I replaced white vinegar with apple cidar vinegar, cooked wild rice in chicken stock, used full spectrum organic mayonnaise and substituted turkey breast with organic chicken breast.

Great salad!  Followed the recipe as is (except I used chicken instead of turkey, but I don't think that really counts as a big deviation) and we loved it.  I served the salad on a bed of tender merlot lettuce from a local farm and it looked really pretty too.  This is a versatile recipe in which you can create your own variety depending on personal taste.  Almost any veggie would be great in this, and different vinegars would make interesting twists.  Enjoy!

I made this for Easter barbecue and everyone loved it.  I made a great big bowl of it and I didn't bring any home because it was gone.  It was a change from making jello or a fruit salad.

This recipe is amazing and always a big hit with guests.  I recommend Near East brand long grain & wild rice without the seasoning packet.  Wonderful on croissants.  Everyone always asks for the recipe!

I and my wife loved this as a summer dish.  I used rice for the best product.  I had to plan ahead to make this.  Had to cook the rice the day before but worth it.  Would make this again a future dinner party.

I used chicken and cranberries because that is what I had on hand.

Love this! I used Uncle Bens brown and wild rice, a dash of hot sauce and apple cider vinegar instead of white. Other than that , I kept everything the same. Will definitely make again

I made it exactly as written first, and rated it based on the original recipe. I thought it was a little bland, but the people I shared it with said it was delicious. Next, I added a little "Kaiulani Exotic Curry seasoning, (www.kaiulani.com) to my leftovers. It added a tang that I liked, but some might find too much.  Finally I had to add more grapes, and this time I quartered them so I would get some grape in every bite. Next time I might add some nuts to the mix instead of as a topping. My choice would be pecans.

I used Uncle Ben's Wild and Long Grain Rice WITH the seasoning packet. I cut down the green onions and salt by half. It's a great salad. Also used cashews in place of almonds.

I'm a vegetarian so didn't add any meat and it was really good.  I used it for sandwiches adding arugula and avocado and served on toasted bread.  I didn't have grapes so used craisens. I think the grapes would make it even better.  Green onions shouldn't be skipped.

Really great recipe! I used canned chicken because I was in a hurry and didn't have any straight wild rice, so I used a wild rice blend. But otherwise I followed the recipe. I wasn't sure about adding green onions, but they turned out to be important - don't skip them! Also, the grapes add some moisture and sweetness. In my opinion, I don't think cherries would work as well. The salad was still tasty the next day, but the dressing had been absorbed by the rice so it was a little dry, but still good. Thanks for sharing!
