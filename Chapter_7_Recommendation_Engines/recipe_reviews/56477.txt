This is similar to a recipe I use except I don't use any meat.  To make it easier, try using string cheese.  You just have to cut it to the lenght you need.  And be sure to remove all of the seeds and the white vein parts.  If not you'll feel like your mouth is on fire!

These were liked. I would have liked them hotter, next time I will not scrape so much of the insides out. I found pepperjack sold in string cheese style and found this made them soo easy to prepare!UPDATE: So I have made these a few more times and to spicen them up, I marinate my cheese in chipotle/adoba sauce - HOT!

I will preface this review by admitting that I actually didn't get to taste these; my husband grilled them for a party.  The guests who ate them said they were great.  During the prep, I had a hard time getting the salami to cover up all of the cheese.  I mixed a couple of tablespoons cream cheese in with shredded pepper jack for the filling, which helped it stay in the jalepeno.  The toothpicks burned on the grill (not the recipe's fault, though).    I think bacon instead of salami would work better for next time because it has a higher fat content and would be less likely to burn around the edges as the salami did.  I'll update this if I actually get to taste one next time.

I like to use recipes as inspiration. So I made a few changes to suit our tastes.I stuffed the jalepeno w/ pepper jack cheese to add extra bite, marinated the chicken in a blend of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, various spices and hot pepper sauces (we like it hot!), and wrapped them in bacon rather than salami. We have pan fried these and also grilled them, but think the best combination is to sear them on the stove top to seal in the juices and crisp up the bacon, then pop them into the oven to finish cooking. AWESOME AND TASTY! I give this 5 stars for a super inspiration recipe.

I liked this one.  Only problem i was having was that my salami pieces just wouldn't wrap around the jalepeno so i could only get a piece to basically cover the opened end and part of the area around it....hmm i just may try the bacon idea.  thanks for the inspiration to take this recipes many places.

These Cucarachas won't have time to scatter, they are that good. The salami grills up crispy with a bacon like flavor. I use pepper jack string cheese cut to the length of the jalapeno. The only other ingredient these need is an ice cold beer.

These are a must at your next game day party. Make sure your salame has the proper diameter, mine was a bit small and hard to affix to the peppers; better to be too big than too small. Thanks for the recipe.
