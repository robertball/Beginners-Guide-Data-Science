This was a great combination of flavors! I did cut the amount of oil in half, and it turned out to be PLENTY. I didn't bother to peel or seed the zucchini, and with the extra moisture, 2 cups of water was way too much. I cut it down to a scant 1/2 cup. I'll be making this again.

This sounded great, especially the combination of spices. But two cups was waaaay too much water, and the whole thing tasted watered down. I would recommend reducing or even eliminating the water - the zucchini and tomatoes both have a lot of liquid.

This recipe is great, it got the thumbs up from my husband who is a picky eater.  I used the ingrediants listed, but I changed the method to suit myself. I did saute the onions, then I dropped in garlic paste in place of the garlic powder (I didn't have any powder) saute the garlic.  I then added in the zucchini stirred that a bit.  I then added the rest of the spices and cooked that for a bit, then I added in the tomatoes cooked that for a bit, then added the water then the yogurt, cooked everything for about 5 minutes and then served with chopped cilantro.  I will def. make this again and maybe even change the vegi. out for another one.

I made this last Ramadan and my family and I really liked it. I served it over basmaati rice which worked out nice.

This dish was a delight for my husband and I.  Since he used to be a vegetarian before he met me, I try to find some all veggie recipies for him.  This turned out spicier than I thought it would, but is was fine for us.  It does make a lot more than a two person meal; however and cutting the amounts that go into it will work, but it seems to be spicier that way.

this recipe was kinda ok at first, but my family didnt like it, and the leftovers thenext day were horribe, it left a nasty sour lingering taste in the mouth, and made my husband swear off zucchini forever. (my husbands family is pakistani, thats why i made this, but instead of impressing them, i ended up having to throw it out)

We all loved this! I used 4 large squash, 2 were zucchini and 2 were yellow summer squash. Also, I was out of fresh tomatoes, so I dumped in a can of diced tomatoes with their juice and then reduced the water to 1 c. Also, I didn't see the need to seed the squash and I ended up cooking this more like 30 min so it would be nice and tender. It came out great, very colorful and flavorful. Served it over jasmine rice... will definitely make this again. It's a winner!

We enjoyed the mix of flavors in this dish, and found the texture of the zucchini delightful. Unlike another reviewer, we found that the flavors bloomed in the refrigerator: the dish improved with age.

Good.  Not spicy at all for our taste though.  But unique blend of flavors.  Nice change for zucchini recipe.  I used only a tablespoon or two of oil and two eight-ball zucchinis and 1/2 cup of water but left the spices the same.

Easy to make! I followed other comments and only used 1/2c of water, that way the sauce wasn't too watery. I also added 1/2t of curry powder. The flavoring was good, but I didn't find it spicy at all, but I enjoy spicy food. I wondered if it would be more flavorful if reheated the next day. I served with Basmati rice.

Made a few minor changes: didn't peel or seed the zucchini, used canned tomatoes with juice instead of fresh tomatoes and water, and used a fresh pressed clove of garlic instead of powdered.  I also added some yellow curry powder and cayenne pepper to spice it up a little.

This tasted good, I eliminated water, reduced oil to 2 spoons, and put 3 tbspns yogurt for 2 zucchinis...turned out nice...had to cook it a little more than 10 minutes though, nice experiment with this vegetable which is hard to feed kids or adults!

This was quite good - following the suggestions of other reviewers, I cut the amount of oil in half and left out the water.  I also used coconut milk instead of yogurt and used canned tomatoes.  It is quick and easy and the spice combination is very nice.
