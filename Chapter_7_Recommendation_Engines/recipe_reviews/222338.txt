So lovely.  I'd never had grilled figs before, but holy whoa, they were DELICIOUS.  I didn't even have a grill--I just used a cast iron skillet.  My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it.  The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild.  Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here.  The figs are what make it.

Oh my.  Never would have done this without the inspiration.  I took it a step further and smeared Burrata on Crostini, topped with Grilled Fig quarters/halves, and drizzled with Balsamic Glaze for a baby shower.  MOST popular - definitely will be doing this again - and the grill mess is a small price to pay.

Made exactly as written. Loved the grilled figs! Loved all of it except ... the Burrata cheese was sort of underwhelming. The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such.  This was good, just not quite perfection for me.

I made this with fresh figs from the garden.  I did substitute fresh soft mozzarella cheese and used a crusty bread.  Wow, was really nice, well flavored and fast.  Enjoyed it prior to grilling a fillet with fingerling potatoes.
