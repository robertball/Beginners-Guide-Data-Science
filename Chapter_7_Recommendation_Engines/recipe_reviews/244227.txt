Because of footnotes about changing, I altered this for family preferences.  I used equal amounts of gluten free and rice flours, honey instead of sugar, oil instead of butter and soy milk. These are wonderful!  The cracked appearance is normal for gluten free breads (see photo). Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions of altering!

pretty much not at all what I was hoping for, dry, crumbly, made it twice, second time added nuts and more butter and honey and cinnamon, made it much better. It has the flavor of plain pie crust without the additions

Tasty treat to eat, but these 5 stars are mostly for the name. Use way more butter and honey to give it a definite taste for sure, and this recipe will become a 5 star.
