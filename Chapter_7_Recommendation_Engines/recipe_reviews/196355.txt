A good use for spare and flat root beer. It has some zip and spice to it. I didn't like the undertaste of the sauce for some reason, but it will certainly get used up. I used mexican chili powder and hungarian paprika, so perhaps that was part of the issue.

I usually try a recipe to the LETTER before making a review, however I did not have any orange juice at the time I needed to make the sauce, I had only apple juice, so that is what I used..It turned out FANTASTIC.. Absolutely love the sauce..This is now going to ba staple sauce in my home. For those who like a thicker sauce (I like this  just the way it is, using apple juice instead, have not tried with orange juice), BUT if you like a thicker sauce just add a bit of corn starch to reach your level of thickness, but seriously I do feel it needs to be thicker.. LOVE this sauce..

Made this over the weekend to go over some Hawaiian burgers. Everyone loved the sauce. I made mine using Dr Pepper. Next time I am going to try some cream soda.

Super good. Super easy! I did not taste the root beer. I was happy about that. Very subtle flavors. If you have people sensitive to hot food, you might want to leave out the red pepper flakes. I'm looking forward to using different sodas to see the taste change:)

When I make this people rave about it.  It has a lot of tang to it. 
 I like it with the full amount of spices but several family members don't like any heat.  Therefore, I usually cut the spices in half.  I always use root beer but I've substituted Pepsi in a pinch once and it was still really good.

Pretty decent BBQ sauce.  I used the Dr. Pepper substitution as I thought the cinnamon flavor would be a nice addition.   I also substituted apple juice for orange juice out of necessity.  After mixing this together, I thought it was terrible, but after cooking, the flavor profile really came around.   I ultimately added in about 1/2 cup of brown sugar because I wanted it a little sweeter.   I also thickened it a bit with corn starch.

This is the best sauce I've found. This is a keeper , I did add some other ingredients to the recipe yellow mustard, liquid smoke and brown sugar. We loved it . I will not be buying BBQ sauce in the future! 

Thanks!
~Ree.

This sounds really good and I want to try it.  As there are only 2 of us in the house, I was wondering if any leftovers could be frozen to use at a later date.
