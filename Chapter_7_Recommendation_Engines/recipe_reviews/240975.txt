Easy, fast...and delicious. Very nice and versatile recipe too. Infinite mixtures you can do here; what is important is that the amounts are spot on resulting in a not thick but not too thin drink. I added some ice to one of mine and it was just as good but runny. We tried one with almond milk and buckwheat flakes instead of water and there was really little difference in taste, texture and consistency. Tried one with quinoa flakes and it overpowers the flavour some. All-in-all a great recipe anninlondon, thanks for sharing it with us.

A delicious and filling breakfast smoothie.  My steel cuts are mixed with chia and flax flakes, just a little added fiber. The texture was good, but I wanted it to be colder, so I blended in some ice cubes.  That did the trick.  I am not a breakfast eater, but I am a breakfast drinker, starting my day with a glass of juice or a smoothie.  This is very good as I got my fruit, my fiber and some dairy.  A great way to start the morning.  Thanks AnnInLondon, for sharing your recipe.

Pretty good! It grows on you as you drink it. We did only have strawberries, and used vanilla ptn powder. Scent was a bit interesting, but that's just us being new to ground up oats in a smoothie.

The shake was tasty. I liked it a lot, but it didn’t keep me as full as some of the other ones do. I was hungry after about two hours, but I just had more of it. I’ll make it again.

I just started making smoothies and this was my first one.  I did tweak it slightly.  Instead of regular water, I used Coconut water (1/2 C) had to increase the water amount because the smoothie was a bit too thick for me.  I also added a tsp of Ceylon Cinnamon (added health benefits).  I used 1/2 C of frozen berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries).  I don’t have steel cut oats so I used quick oats (1/8 C added to 1/8 C ground flax seed) (more fiber). Flavor and consistency were great.  I’ll make this again for sure. Overall, the one I made gave me 36g of Protein, 8g fiber and 388 calories.  Don’t let the calories scare you, this is chock full of healthy stuff.

I have made this in the last month a lot and absolutely love it. As I'm lactose intolerant I make it either with Rice Milk or Kefir! YummY

I loved this recipe, but i needed to add more liquid to it because it was just a little too thick for my taste.  I didn't have any steel cut oats, so I used some barley that I had soaking already over night for lunch...  I also didn't have berries, so I used a variety pack that had pineapples, mangoes, papayas, and strawberries. YUM!
