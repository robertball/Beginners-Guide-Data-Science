These were very good and so easy to make! After mixing it up and tasting it I liked it but I usually add a bit or worcestershire (sp?) sauce tabasco sauce and garlic powder to our bloody mary's so I did put a bit of each in this which made it REALLY taste like a the bloody mary's that we're used to. Hubby really enjoyed this...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

Waste of vodka!  Made it for a Bloody Mary bar.  Glad I sampled at home first - didn't bring it.
