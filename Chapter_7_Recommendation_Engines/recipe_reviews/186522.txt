Very yummy and satisfying to a sweet lover. However, I made these changes to the recipe, only because I had this on hand: I used a 1/2 of 16 oz bag of frozen, mixed berries (raspberries; blueberries; blackberries; strawberries,cut up)and sprinkled 1/4 cup sugar on the fruit before thawing in the microwave. This produced a syrup with the fruit. I combined a 1/4 cup of  sugar with 1/2 cup water to pour over the fruit. When I added the fruit to the batter, I poured the juice it made with it, also. Next time, I'm going to double the fruit and use Splenda and light Bisquick mix for the batter.

Great recipe! Easy and very good. It only took me 5 minutes to make, which is a huge plus in my book. I followed the recipe exactly and don't think it really needs any improvement upon. Will also go well with a cup of coffee for breakfast. Thanks!

An excellent recipe for what it is - a quick, easy and pretty darned tasty, comfort food dessert mixed up and poured into the pan in literally just a couple of minutes. Had I not made this myself I would have never known this cake/cobbler started with packaged baking mix.  As I assembled this I had my doubts that this could EVER work - it's a layer of batter, followed by a layer of cherries and finished by pouring a lot of juice over it all.  It looked strange. How it came to look like it did after it baked is beyond me, but it worked and it was good, warm or cold and particularly good topped with whipped cream.

This was a really good, easy cherry dessert.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan, because of that it took about 15 more minutes to bake.  I also sprinkled a little sugar on top before I baked it.

This was SO simple and so, so good. All my Momma kept saying was how much it tasted like the cobbler her Mom made for her as a child.
I would recommend Bisquick instead of Pioneer buttermilk baking mix though. The Pioneer doesn't seem to rise as well

Very easy to make.  I made my own pancake batter (without the wet ingredients), used the cherries I canned from last year,  and had to add a bit more milk than the recipe called for (maybe 2/3 c).  I also added a few drops of almond extract, because cherries should always accompany almonds.  ;)  It is in the oven, so we will see how we like it later! edit: This was fantastic!!

Great recipe!  I substitued real buttermilk for the milk and used fat free Bisquik.  I also added a bit of anise extract - which I feel is a requirement in any cherry dessert!   I have to admit - I was a little nervous after pouring all that cherry juice on top of the batter - looked more like I was making a jello mold!.....BUT  - it really did all absorb and turned out fantastic!!  I'm going to try this recipe with the same brand of canned blueberries next time!!

Easy to make and tasted good too. My boyfriend doesn't care for cherries and he even liked this. I had to cook mine a little longer to get the top to lightly brown. Will definitely make again.

OK...so I made a couple of changes: increased pancake mix to 3/4 cups, increased milk to 1 cup, added 1 teaspoon almond extract tossed with the cherries, melted 1/4 cup of butter in 9 x13 " baking dish in the oven before pouring batter over.  Then proceeded with the recipe as written. Served warm with whipped cream....heavenly.

Really great!  I needed to make a quick dessert for a get-together and didn't have enough flour for a cherry pie.  So I came across this, had the Bisquick, and threw it together!  SO easy!  I actually doubled the recipe, baked it for about 15 minutes longer in a 9x13.  I also added some almond extract to the syrup mixture before pouring it on top of the batter and cherries.  Will definitely be making this again sometime!

Crust was a little soft...not crispy like I would like.  It was tasty, though!  Just a texture thing.

Tasted good, and it's certainly easy to make. Too much liquid was left in the bottom after baking, but that might have been my mistake as I had a larger container of cherries and may have over estimated the amount of cherry juice. Served warm with whipped cream. Thanks!

I used tart frozen cherries, because that's what I had.  This was excellent. I also added cinnamon.

I made this for Bunco yesterday. It's super easy and very yummy, especially with whipped cream topping or Cool Whip!

I used Bisquick for the baking mix.  I cooked it in the microwave, about 8-9 minutes, just until it had a congealed look. Then, when I arrived at Bunco, we stuck it in the oven @350 to brown it, probably about 15 minutes.  It was delish!!

I would imagine it would work with any fruit. I plan to try it soon with peaches.

have been using this for a long time, my mother-in-law calls it surprise pie, wokrs well with any fruit, especially great with peaches and apples. I use a good quality self-rising flour (saves a little  money) instead of the baking mix

Oh-So-Easy is right, and Oh-So-Good!!!! I had to cook it a bit longer so as to get the top a nice light brown, but that could be my oven. Made this for dessert last night and it was an empty dish that I found this morning. Will definitely be baking this up often... we love our cherries! Thanks, mzlizz!

I doubled this to use in a 9x13. I had frozen cherries so I just sprinkled them with the sugar and defrosted them in the microwave. That made the syrup when they were finished thawing. The only other difference I made was to add a bit more sugar to the batter and to melt a stick of butter in the pan and then pour the batter on that followed by the fruit and syrup. My family loved this but my 7 year old son ADORED it, I ended up getting only 1 piece. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great in a pinch.  I used 2 cans of tart pie cherries, halved both the sugar quantities and used 2 cups bisquick, and 1 cup milk.  I spilled about 1/4 cup of the cherry juice on the floor and the cobbler still turned out fine, in fact it was a little runny on the bottom.  Next time I may try a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch.   I baked it in a 9x13" at 350 for 25 min and then broiled it at 550 for 5 min and the top is nice and golden.   It was superb, will definitely make again.  Guests raved about it.  Thank you!

this recipe sounded so good, i had to try it. i bought sweet dark cherries packed in heavy syrpe by mistake. i bought jiffy buttermilk biscuit mix and measured out one cup of mix and followed this recipe. it was very thin. i topped with the cherries and slowly poured the syrpe mixture over top. this is when i said to myself how will this turn out, as it looked liked everything blended together. what a surprise when the crust formed on top and everything thickend up. it turned out fantanstic.  i didn't have icecream, but topped it with a little very vanilla soy milk. it was to die for. this super easy recipe will be one of my all time favorites. thankyou.

It came out perfectly despite using regular milk in place of buttermilk (confused by the directions), browned perfectly.  It definitely took real willpower to make it last 3 days.

I made this but made it easier! I poured 2 cans of cherry pie filling in a 9" x13" pan. I then sprinkled a box of WHITE cake mix on top, as evenly distributed as possible. Then, I cut up in small slices 1 & 1/2 sticks of real unsalted butter & arranged them all over the top of the cake mix.   I put the pan in a pre-heated 350• oven & baked it for 1 hr & 5 min. (Depends on how accurate ur oven temp is!)!  The white vs yellow cake makes ALL the difference! Makes for a crunchier more cobbler-like appearance & it just tastes GREAT!!

I doubled this recipe--tripled the cherries but just doubled the juice and the rest (because I love cherries)  and it was awesome!  Big hit -- did add sugar on top too.   Thanks--made it for my dad's 77th birthday party and he loved it!!!

I gave it 3 stars because the recipe was not very clear to me. Sweeten or unsweeten cherries? What is buttermilk baking mix? Bisquit???? Should the cherry juice be cooled before pouring over batter? I added 1/2 teaspoon good almond flavoring and 1/2 cup sliced almonds on top before baking. Baked 40 minutes. It was very good, but had to guess at all these questions.

Great Idea.  I exchanged the cherries and sugar for Cherry Pie Filling and then used Bisquick instead of the Buttermilk mix and added 1/4 cup more milk.  My baking time was 40 minutes.  This was very good.  Thanks

This was very easy and nice for a weeknight dessert.  The only problem I had was the recipe says it will bake in 25 to 30 minutes, mine took twice that long.  Other than that I had no problems and will make again.

I have made this numerous late nights, and I'm here to tell you it will make your tongue smack your brains out!  Top it warm with vanilla ice cream to really indulge yourself.  I've also made it with canned apples (NOT PIE FILLING) for my husband, and he  loved it.  I think canned peaches  would work well too.

This is wonderful. I doubled the recipe batter mixture, which is actually between a batter and a dough following the recipe. I used the larger Pyrex size pan to pour the dough into, and just opened a can of Comstock Cherry Pie Filling and poured it on top. I used 1/2 cup Keebler Graham Cracker Crumbs and added 1 T sugar to them. Poured this over the top of Cherry Pie Filling. Cooked for 20 minutes and then ran a knife through the mix to stir it up a bit. Baked total of about an hour. It came up some crispy, some gooey, and some chewy. Very Nice with just a cup of milk to drink with it. Thank you for sharing this simple work of art that so easily adapts to whatever we have on hand. LOVE IT!

Have made this twice this week! The second time, I brought the cherry juice and sugar to a low boil on the stove, for about 5 minutes  then let cool for a few minutes. Worked out better, I think; kinda like a thin cherry jam.  I also doubled the recipe and made in a 9"x11" pan the second time. Rave reviews!! I think it turned out better doubling and using a slightly bigger pan; more loft.

I double this recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Bake time was a little longer to achieve the desired browning of the crust.  This was very sweet and if I were to make it again I would reduce the amount of sugar substantially and probably add a litte salt to the crust mixture.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The cherries on our trees were ripe! I pitted them and they seemed wet so I tossed them with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch like my Mom used to do. I was out of milk but had coconut milk on hand. Turned out great.

As advertised, very easy recipe. Saw comment about it being too soft, so added a bit of melted butter to generously sprayed pan before adding batter. Cooked an extra 10 min. Came out perfect with crisp edges. Used 16oz bag of frozen cherries, heated in the microwave with the sugar, and it made lots of liquid. Didn't think it would gel without cornstarch, but it did. Could easily double the fruit next time. Could do the same with any fruit. Must have vanilla ice cream with it. Great with a splash of rum or red wine over the top.

I absolutely loved it. I used frozen cherries a large bag. Defrosted in microwave with 1/2 cup sugar which created the juice I needed. Then strained and cooked juice as directed. I put cherries in a strainer and they drained some more. I doubled the recipe for the bisquick mix. I used regular not buttermilk. I added only 1/2 cup of sugar. Mixed as directed with a cup of 1% milk.  Spread batter in bottom of pan and arranged cherries over the top.  To the juice that drained from the cherries I added a tablespoon of cornstarch and mixed in with the microwaved juice and sugar. Poured over the top of batter and cherries. Baked for 35  minutes . It turned out perfect.  I was so surprised.  I thought it would be soupy because of all the juice.  But the cornstarch helped I figured.  Best cherry cobbler I ever made.

Measured everything out as stated, opened the can of cherries and proceeded. Am very good at following directions to a 'T' and was very optimistic because of all the rave reviews but this recipe turned out to be a disaster and nothing even close to a cobbler. I don't remember ever giving such a bad review but guess there is always a first. Would give zero stars if possible. What a waste of precious food money

I am absolutely crazy about cherries and as it is now the cherry season, this recipe falls well, that is it would if I knew what a buttermilk mix was.

This was a great beginner recipe for me since I just started baking.  My family enjoyed it but my dad said it didn't taste like his favorite one from Bob Evan's.  It's missing something.  Definitely would make again though!
