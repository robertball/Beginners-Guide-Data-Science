Well I made a few changes. We used a brand name sauce. We also added fresh ginger, garlic, red pepper diced and scallions. It was delicious.  Not like restaurant KONG Pao, better. It was delicious.  Will definitely do again with the changes we made. Good home cooks, go for it.

This is really good!  I doubled the amount of bok choy to give it extra vegetables.  Would've given it 5 starts but one of the kids was not a fan.  (and she loves Chinese food)
