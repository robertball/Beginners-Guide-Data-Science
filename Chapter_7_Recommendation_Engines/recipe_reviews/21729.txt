Thank you to all the reviewers on this one.  I made their changes and this turned out wonderful.  I increased the feta cheese, spinkled the inside of the fish with garlic powder.  After they were rolled I added lemon pepper, subsituted the water for lemon juice and poured a litte lemon juice over the top of the fish. We live in Alaska so I subsituted halibut for flounder (just a bigger version of flounder)

once again, I did substitutions, which turned out
really great. instead of using flounder, I used
tilapia. I also used quite a bit more mushrooms,
feta & spinach.
just a hint for anyone who's always used reg ol
parmesan on their spaghetti. try using feta for a change. we won't ever again use parmesan on our
spaghetti. it adds a totally new & different flavor.

This was excellent and simple.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the spinach and mushroom mixture for some extra flavor...next time I will add more garlic and some salt and pepper.  It's a great recipe, just needs a little more flavor.

Excellent!!!  I added chopped tomato and per the reviews I added garlic, and probably 1/2 cup feta.  I also coated the fish with mixture of bread crumbs, Paul Prudome Seafood Magic and Tony Cachere's creole seasoning.  I covered it with lemon and butter.  You must drain off the moisture from the stuffing mixture (I may even strain it next time) or you will have a mushy problem.  I baked it longer than 20 minutes--maybe 30.  It was so good--and healthy!!!

This was good. I increased the amount of feta that i used to about 2.5 oz and I sauted my mushrooms with fresh garlic.  I would also recommend seasoning the fish with season salt, paprika, pepper and garlic.

This recipe is only good if you season the fish.  By itself the taste is nothing special.  Also, 1 T. of feta is not enough.  You need atleast 1/4 c.  I agree with a previous reviewer that dredging the fish in breadcrumbs is the way to go.

Very Quick and easy and best of all it tastes great.  I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and some garlic powder and instead of using the fresh vegies, I used frozen spinach and canned mushrooms.  Hubby really liked this alot.!

This was absolutely delicious! Now the end result will depend on where you get your fish and how fresh it is. I was lucky enough to pick up some very fresh local flounder from my local farmers market and it made this dish spectacular. Remember, if it smells like fish don't eat it. Fish is meant to smell like salt water if you can imagine that. It should have a very clean almost fresh scent that doesn't make you pull back or scrunch your nose upon taking a good whiff. I also recommend getting your hands on local spinach and mushrooms. I sautéed the sliced mushrooms for about five minutes with a tablespoon of butter and a nice sized garlic clove mined. I added the spinach,salt and fresh cracked pepper to the mushrooms and finished cooking it down. Afterward I drained the liquid from the pan and set it aside. I took the fish and soaked it in cold water for about five minutes. I took it out of the water and patted the filets down then rolled them over the mushroom spinach mixture. I used two toothpicks and actually baked the filets seam up. I couldn't fit all my veg in the filets so I stuffed the remaining mixture into the filets from each side making sure to pack the fish with the mushrooms and spinach mix. I saved a little of the butter from the sautéed pan and I poured that over each filet and then baked it following the recipe above. I served it with baked/broiled red potatoes and it was one of the best meals I've ever made. You'd pay a fortune for this at the beach. Great!!!

This is a good dish as long as you season as you go along. I added herbs and spices to my filling and to my fish. I used more feta than called for and finished with a squeeze of lemon juice. Very nice Verona!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It was very easy to make and very light.  But it was still satisfying.  I used fat-free feta cheese.  Next time I might season the fillets a bit before baking.  Definitely will make again.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I did make a few changes.  One change I made was to use lemon juice instead of water.  I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them.  I also used talapia because that was all I had on hand.  I served this with Feta and Greek Basil couscous and steamed broccoli.  It was delish!

This is a great low-fat meal for anyone on diet. It is only 2 points for one stuffed fillet on WW.  It is very satisfying.

Excellent recipe!  Fabulous without any changes except a little extra feta. We have used flounder, halibut, cod, and sole.  Any white fish work. If the fish is too hard to roll, just put the stuffing between two fillets and bake flat.  Ours have never been mushy as some reviewers say, but the firmer fish is probably best.  Season the fish and/or stuffing any way you like - breading is nice, but not necessary - add wine or use butter instead of cooking spray-  it doesn't really matter - always delicious!!

I doubled this recipe and made a few small changes.  I sautéed the mushrooms in 2tbs butter with 1tbs minced garlic.  I used frozen spinach (measured out on my kitchen scale to 16 oz), thawed and pressed.  I used a couple handfuls of Feta.  I sprinkled Ms. Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning over the top of the rolls.  Delicious.

Loved this! Didn't have feta, so used crumbled blue cheese (roughly half as much cheese as in recipe). Added chopped garlic to the saute, as well as smoked paprika, salt and pepper, and just enough cayenne pepper to prop up the paprika. Topped the rolled flounder with extra spinach-mushroom stuffing. Roasted at 400 till cooked through and lightly browned.

absolutely delicious. I do not normally bake fish as I tend to go toward frying or grilling it. This recipe was delicious and easy! (Quick too!)

This was very tasty I made it tonight. I added 1 minced garlic clove while sauteing the mushrooms. We just put salt and pepper on the fish and basted with olive oil and BBQed. Everyone loved it, it could have come from a restaurant. Defintely converting to fish lover.

This was good, but not spectacular.  I added minced garlic to the sauteed mushrooms and spinach, and used lots more garlic and herb flavored feta cheese than what the recipe called for.  I'll hang onto the recipe, simply because it was low fat.

This was very good!  I used garlic and herb feta and added a lot of salt and pepper.  The market didn't have flounder so I used filet of sole and it was just fine.  I will definitely be making this again!

After following suggestions in other reviews, I made this tonight and it was FANTASTIC! ( I gave it 4 stars, since I made a few changes.) Used one TBS EVOO and one TBS unsalted butter when I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic. Used the recommended 1/2 cup feta (a MUST!). My hubby mentioned this would also be great if we added bacon (cooked and chopped) to the filling.  Instead of "rollups", I placed one flounder filet in PAM sprayed baking dish, topped with the "filling", then topped with second flounder filet and seasoned with Lemon Pepper. Baked for full 30 minutes. MAGNIFIC!

Okay, I followed directions and wound up with fish mush. I'll have to pass on this one in the future. Maybe my flounder was too thin? No idea here.

This was easy and fun. Here's what I did. First I put a cup or 2 of frozen spinach in the frying pan. I poured a little white wine on it and added some water too just until it was defrosted. No mushrooms. I seasoned it with garlic salt, adobe seasoning, little lemon juice, little salt then added enough feta cheese to cover the top of the spinach. Heat that a little bit. Take the flounder and put in the stuffing mixture and roll as directed. Sprinkle w/olive oil, lemon juice and paprika. It looks wonderful and a great flavor!! I took the extra spinach and put it in the middle of the three flounder rolls. If you like feta cheese,you will like this! Enjoy!

Really didn't like this one too much. It might have been my fault, because the flounder I get in the grocery store is the same size-not that large...so my roll ups were so tiny! I kind of felt like it was a lot of work for not that exciting of a meal. I made this months ago and haven't thought to make it since.

This is a fantastic recipe, and so easy. I had grey sole instead. I sauteed mushrooms and spinach in olive oil with garlic and sprint onions and added feta cheese once the mixture cooled. I had some seasoning mix that I added to the fish, and sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top. The outcome looks like something out of a fine restaurant. Will absolutely prepare this again. Thanks!

Like many other reviewers, I used a lot more feta. I highly recommend tomato-basil feta (or another seasoned feta) because it really livened up the dish.

I hesitated to make this dish when I saw the spinach/feta/mushroom mix w/ no additional flavors. I have used this combination in many other dishes. Unless you dress it up a lot, this dish is as exciting as watching your toenails grow.

I couldn't find fresh flounder for the recipe so I used sole and it was great.

This recipie is good for a weekday meal because   it is quick and easy.  I opted to bread the flounder before I baked it and I think I ended up with a better product.

This was a really good base recipe.  It needs more feta, I used about 3 ounces.  I sauteed an onion and a little garlic with the mushrooms.  I marinated my filets in a bit of fresh squeezed lemon juice, garlic, and salt and pepper for about 2 hours before I prepped.  I also used lemon juice in the pan instead of water as suggested by another reviewer. The family loved it.

my bf loved this and i just thought it was alright.. i had to deviate from the recipe bc all i had was red snapper.. didnt have feta and just used a cheddar/mozz cheese blend.. used frozen spinach instead of fresh.. added a clove of garlic and some minced onion.. lightly seasoned the fish with lemon pepper.. i think if i had marinated the fish i would have liked it more.. either way ty for a recipe that my bf couldn't get enough of

I substituted red snapper for the flounder and added 4 gloves of garlic (I also used a feta in garlic oil...we're a little garlic crazy in my house!) as well as used more mushrooms than the recipe called for.

It was really tasty. My boyfriend was amazed at how healthy the meal is too (fish, lots of veggies, no butter and very little oil). It was really simple to make as well! I will definitely use this recipe again, and it will be great for stuffed chicken as well.

Love recipes like this! They are so versatile AND delicious!

This was a simple recipe that yields a very tasty way to serve flounder! It takes very little time (especially if you buy pre-sliced mushrooms) and looks very good when served.

I included the additions suggested by other revieweers and this came out SO good!  I was skeptical considering how simple and so few ingredients.  I strained the mushroom/spinch mixture, sprinkled the fish with garlic powder and lemon...covered with bread crumbs and lemon before baking.  the feta was so good in this.  My husband and I loved it!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  It came together perfectly and cooked without any problems.  The only change I made was to add a touch of parsley and tarragon before cooking.

Yum Yum! I used frozen spinach and canned mushrooms... because I'm a busy man. I also used reduced fat Feta. I had difficulty finding fillets big enough to roll so some of them I kept open faced.

After reading all reviews you need to add to recipe for extra flavor- so I added to stuffing mix: crumbled blue cheese, parm, greek olives,garlic, spring onions, white wine, mix of fresh mushroom and spinach.  Then for the fish i seasoned w/ sea salt, basil, lemon pepper, garlic salt and italian spices.  I dreaged fish in same baking dish w/ spices& fresh lemon instead of H20 for baking.  It was great full of flavor-Rolled them topped w/ bread crumbs. Baked longer too 30 minutes. The only thing I would cut back little on salt since Olives brought extra salt flavor  once cooked..  yum would make again!

I prepared it as the recipe states.  I had higher expectations than I should have.  I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and expected the spinach and mushrooms to do the rest.  It was bland.  Definitely needs more seasoning.  I like the concept and it was easy to fix.  I will try with lemon pepper next time.

I agree with needing a lot more cheese which is not surprising coming from me. I also added garlic and some scalions which blend in very well with the spinach. This recipe works with blue cheese as well.

This dish was incredibly easy to make and it was delicious!  I also added more feta than the recipe called for.  Next time I will marinate the fish prior to cooking, as it was a little dry.

I used Swai fish filets instead and seasoned it with garlic powder. For the stuffing, I used Parmesan cheese and shredded Mexican cheese instead of feta since it was a very last minute  decision to try this dish.

Delish!

I substituted flounder for tilapia and seasoned the fish with tomato and basil. I also used a tomato and basil feta for more flavor. When I was finished I topped it with just a little bit of finely shredded mozzarella to hold it together. All in all very good.

I like lemon pepper seasonings on the fish and fat free feta. Great dish and healthy as well as satisfying! The flounder was the best fish. Sole also would work.Forget the talipa mentioned in another review as it is much higher in fatty acids. Thanks.

We loved it.  I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil with garlic, added more cheese, seasoned the fish with Webers lemon seasing for fish, and and threw some fresh sliced banana peppers from my garden on it just before serving before serving.  Hubby and I both loved it!

Delicious, but we did make 2 changes.
I switched the feta cheese for ricotta, my husband doesn't care for feta. And I sprinkled the fillets with Old Bay seafood seasoning. I'm saving this one to my pinterest account.

Really loved this dish, even my picky husband had to admit it was pretty good. I used a lot more cheese and sauteed some minced garlic with the mushrooms. I also salted and peppered the spinach when I added it to the pan and salted and peppered the raw fillets. After stuffing the fillets I cooked them on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray without covering with tin foil at the recommended time and temperature, and they were not the least bit mushy. Absolutely delicious, thank you for this awesome recipe!

Pretty good, with modifications suggested by other reviewers: butter added for sauteing the vegetables, and more cheese. But I also had one roll turn mushy and my husband suggested (after I mentioned the cautions in earlier reviews) just always buying one extra fillet on the assumption that one would be bad. We liked the recipe enough to keep working with it.

added lemon pepper to fish, used lemon juice instead of water, topped with paprika. Could add more seasoning on top.

This melted in my mouth. I sneaked a little and dredged the fish in breadcrumbs and drizzled olive oil over the top instead of water. Will definitely add this to the rotation!

These were impressive-looking and yummy!  I seasoned the spinach mixture and the fish with lemmon pepper and doubled the feta.  I also added 1/2 slice of american cheese on top of the spinach to make a melty, gooey center.  Really good!

Really good and easy.  I followed the advice of other and used 1/4 cup feta for 3 fillets.  Also sprinkled a mixture of bread crumbs, fresh garlic, onion powder, and lemon pepper on top.  Plenty of flavor! It took MUCH longer to cook than 15 minutes- at least 25-30.  Next time I'll uncover it for the last 5 minutes to crisp the bread crumbs.

If there were negative stars, I would give those!Even though I drained the fish twice while cooking it came out gooey. The fish tasted like paste. The spinach stuffing was good with a little seasoning and I will use the stuffing with rolled flank steak or something of the like, but I will never make this again. We didnt even eat it, threw it out. PASTE!

I added some cut up shrimp, diced almonds, pepper and garlic to the stuffing mixture and it was more tasty than following the orginal recipe.  Also, I had some stuffing mixture left over that I put into small oven-safe soup bowls, covered with cheese and baked along with the fish.  made for a great side dish!

It was okay.  It might have been my fish, but it turned out mushy.  I added garlic, salt, and pepper to the fish and also to the filling.  Instead of water I used lemon juice.

This didn't go so well for me, although it was largely the fish that I think was the problem.  I liked the filling so I'll probably try making this again sometime.

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe without embellishments is bland. I increased the feta cheese to 1/2 cup.  I sauteed the mushrooms with margarine and olive oil and added onion and garlic.  I sprinkled lemon pepper  and garlic salt generously on the fish.  After rolling in the spinache, I set it in the baking dish and put the remaining spinach stuffing on top of the fish rolls.  I topped it with panko bread crumbs and some shredded parmesan.  I baked it for about 12 minutes and then put the broiler on high and toasted the panko bread crumbs.  Turned out great!  I gave it 4 stars because the recipe as it is written is not very good.

Love Love Love this recipe. I made adjustments as noted in the comments (kept the fillets flounder) and used the extra spinach, mushroom, feta stuffing mixture as a base for the rolls to sit on. Full cook time for 3 rolls was 25 minutes at 400. Will make it again!

This is about the worst recipe I have made from All Recipes. We followed the recipe exactly. It needed salt to begin with. The fish was totally unseasoned. If you like fish without any seasoning, this recipe is for you. But it certainly was not for me! The spinach was OK but not great. This recipe is a pure loser.

LOVED it!  I tend to 'loosely' follow cooking instructions. So, I increased the feta, added onion & garlic (just because I always do).  It was delish!  I'll definitely make this again!

With a few modifications based on reviews (wine instead of water in  the bottom of the pan, season fish with garlic powder and squeeze lemon over fish before cooking) this recipe was a hit! Restaurant quality!

This recipe is perfect for those who are watching their weight. The only changes I made were to add some seasoning along the way, and extra tablespoon of feta, and about a teaspoon of EVOO to the spinach mixture. My husband and daughter loved it as much as I did. I will definitely make this again!

I always season my fish. The recipe wouldn't be good any other way. I added 4 cloves of garlic to my sauteed spinach. Also, I dipped the outer side of the fish in bread crumbs. I used grated parmesan instead of feta. I sprinkled some parmesan on the fish portion prior to putting the spinach on it, then added another sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top of the spinach. After folding the fish over the spinach, mushroom and garlic mixture I sprinkled the remaining bread crumbs on the outside of fish and added another sprinkle of parmesan cheese. This recipe was better than any I've ever had in any restaurant. I will make it again. It was quick and easy to make. I can make it for guests. It looked very nice and presentable as well.

this was a good base, I combined it with Alton Brown's Baked stuffed flounder recipe. Made the spinach mix with cream cheese, feta, wine, onions, garlic a bit of milk and corn starch.  Set aside and cooled. Then rolled the flounder, put over a bed of left over rice and baked.

This was bland and I tried to spice it up with more garlic salt pepper and old bay. I need to add more to make it better.  I will try gain because I like  the combination of spinach mushrooms and fish.

I made this and it was very good but made a few changes.  I breaded the fish with olive oil and breadcrumbs. Then added 4 cloves of garlic to the mushroom/spinach mixture for some flavor.  I made 1 version with parmesan cheese and the other with Feta.  baked it for 20 minutes, maybe should have done a few more minutes.  All in all my family was happy, original recipe needs some spicing up for more flavor but overall good and will make it again.

I made this today, but I read the reviews on it before I cooked it and the main thing people said was it didn't have enough spices. So I cooked it my way and with my favorite spices...I added onions to the mushroom, spinach and feta cheese stuffing. And seasoned my flounder with fresh garlic, a little Goya Sazon, pepper, parsley and pepper seasoning. AND IT TURNED OUT FANTASTIC! My husband loves it!

I gave it a 4 because as the recipe stands, it needs a lot more feta and a whole lot more flavoring on the outside. With a few tweaks, this will be a household favorite!

4 stars as written and 5 stars with my mods.  I added garlic, red bell peppers and sauteed onions.  We loved it!

I actually tried a variation on this recipe, I added tomato topped it with breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. It's a delightful variation on this already very good recipe. For more variations on some classic recipes go to www.pantryexperiment.wordpress.com

I not really enjoy this recipe. It was ok but the fish tasted very bland even with the spices recomended. I even cooked it in lemon juice instead of with water but it created an odd soapy taste. The spinach,mushroom, and feta mix sauted with the garlic tasted very good but the fish ruined the taste of the filling.

Agree with the others, and realized off the bat that unseasoned fish would be bland. Added several cloves of minced garlic while I cooked the mushrooms, then sprinkled in some garlic powder when I added the fresh spinach. Seasoned the fish with a mixture of sea salt, thyme, and lemon peel, then substituted the water at the bottom of the pan for lemon juice. Excellent

As-is I think it's a great idea for a healthy dish, but  needs seasonings -- 3 stars. Using suggestions of other reviewers, it is 4 stars. Next time I will try cooking it on the stovetop (covered skillet) to see if fish turns out more moist.

This we pretty good, but didn't seem to have much flavor.  Next time I think we will add lemon juice or stick a lemon wedge in with the stuffing.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I am 4 stars because they did not season the fish.  I sprinkled salt and lemon pepper Mrs. Dash it was great and low fat.

This was very good and easy, although I changed a bunch of things from the original (as I usually do!)  I used tilapia instead of flounder, which tasted good but was a bit hard to roll.  I also added garlic to the spinach/mushroom mixture and added more feta than the recipe called for.  (It's really important to squeeze that extra liquid out of the vegetables before adding the cheese.)  Also, after reading reviews that it was soggy, I just cooked the fish in a glass baking pan - I didn't add extra water or cover with foil.  I had potatoes in the oven at 400 so I cooked for about 15-17 minutes and it was perfect.

This was great!  We used sole instead of flounder, it was hard to keep together but when cooked it was delicious!

This was so simple and really tasty! I made so many modifications but it was still good. I used frozen package spinach and mozzarella cheese since I didn't have feta or mushrooms. I also seasoned with lemon pepper, lemon juice, and garlic powder. I can't wait to try the orig. version of the recipe, but this one works well too! Served w/ white & veggie blend.

This recipe was great and easy to do. I didn't have Feta but used freshly grated parmesan and it still was good.  I also seasoned the mushrooms with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and basil.  I used frozen spinach - cooked that on it's own first then blended it in with the mushrooms for a couple of minutes - grated the parmesan over the mushroom spinach mixture - heated it thoroughly then use to stuff the flounder. Once stuffed, I then sprinkled Italian style bread crumbs on top of the rolled flounder. Cooked as directed.  Turned out great!!

I really liked how quick and easy this was to make. I did add some minced garlic to my spinach, and upped the feta. I also seasoned the fish with some pepper, but I didn't use salt since the feta is already so salty. I'll probably make this again, although I'm not sure if I'll use flounder again, but that's just a personal preference.

I had to compromise and use fish I had, which was Talapia.  I thought it was good, but my kids didn't care much for the feta.  Will make it again, just leave that out of theirs!

I added basil, garlic, onion salt, pepper, oregano, and lemon juice; I thought it was still a bit bland but my parents thought it was perfect. Next time I'll add more spices (and feta, mmm).

This dish was very yummy. I prepared it exactly as was called for (well I didn't measure I just threw together the ingredients) and I added garlic to the mixture. I also used blue cheese instead of feta. My whole family loved it. The only complaint I have is that the fish was a bit bland. I think it needed butter and salt on that top. Other than that, it was wondeful!

This is a very simple recipe.  I added some salt, pepper and dill to the filling and sprinkled the top with paprika and lemon juice.  Very delicious.  Will make again.

We used frozen whiting instead of flounder, and couldn't roll them up, but this was very tasty. Next time, we might season the fish a bit more. And we used a lot more feta, just to use up what we had. We loved it!
