I made a double batch of this but only used one box of Uncle Ben's wild rice, cooked in organic chicken broth and in place of the extra rice, I added three medium cubed zucchini, a cup of shredded carrot and a small bunch of celery that I chopped fine. I get more crunchy vegetables this way and I cut back on my carb intake as well. I used all organic chicken broth, baby bella mushrooms and I increased the garlic to....a lot. Because I'm watching my milk intake, I used only enough evaporated milk to lighten the broth, maybe a quarter cup and I also used fat free evaporated milk. I thought this turned out really well and it'll be enough to last me all week. This is a very hearty and flavorful soup. NOTE: At the last minute, I stirred in one 10 ounce container of organic spinach leaves. That made it even better! I also want to add that I did not need double the amount of cornstarch. Using two tablespoons in the four tablespoons of white wine was plenty.

I lowered the fat by using some broth to saute instead of oil and by using fat-free evaporated milk. Tasted wonderful. Oh, I also added some shredded carrot.

The prep time is a little deceiving because you still have to cook the rice mix but the extra time is worth it.  This is a really good soup that's even better the second time around.

Yummy!  I made this soup for the family ever since my daughter was a baby.  She is now 5 and has been able to enjoy it with us ever since she began learning how to eat solid foods.  I make mine a little thicker with more chicken and more rice (I use my own combination of plain brown and wild rice - cooked without any seasoning).  I also add another tablespoon of tarragon.  But definitely a recipe that will be a family tradition.

i solved the time problem by using uncle bens express 5 minute rice mix instead of the normal, rice was done before i finished chopping the rest of the ingredients. yummy, yummy.  my husband loved it, and now he wants me to make it all the time.

This soup was excellent.  I was craving a rice soup and found this one.  I followed the directions except I did add some diced carrots.  The color was a nice addition.  Will definitely make again and again

This soup wasn't bad just very boring. I added worcestershire and soy sauce trying to give it some flavor. We could eat it but who would want to with so many better recipes out there. Think I will and roasted red peppers to the leftovers maybe that will help.

I made this recipe today.  It is delicious.  I read it several times but forgot to cook the rice package before adding it.  But it turned out fine and I think I would do it that way again to save time and extra work.  Seemed like the extra cooking time was nice too.  Great soup dish on a cold day.  Thank you for the recipe.

Hmmm, I expected more after all the 5 star reviews.  This was good, and the look was very upscale-restaurant, but it needs more flavor!  Added extra s+p plus fresh snipped chives (I did not have either optional ingredient) which would up our rating to 4 stars.

I loved this recipe!  I did add 2 more cups of chicken broth so I would have a larger quantity (leftovers!).  I also added a little parsley, bay leaf, and basil.  The green onions and almonds are great and my guests loved the recipe.  Thank you!

I used frozen chicken breast and chicken broth with the seasonings for 3 hours, chopped the chicken, then added the rice mix and canned mushrooms for the last 3 hours. I added the wine, evap. milk, 1 more cup of chicken broth and the cornstarch the last 30-45 minutes.  Turned out Great!

This is so good.  I love the toasted almonds.  I added about 1/3 cup diced up, cooked bacon for extra flavor.  Since I did that, I should have omitted the salt 'cause that made it a little too salty, but that was my fault.  This soup was so good that even my two , picky little ones ate it all without a single complaint.  Yum.

We love this soup!!  I actually found this recipe on the carnation site a couple of years ago and misplaced it.  Lo and behold..  It is a wonderful comparison to the FLAVOR of Panera's ckn and wild rice soup.  I hate mushrooms but LOVE this soup!!!!

I made this for a wine tasting party.  All of my guest raved about it and asked for the recipe!!  It was a really easy recipe to make. The only changes that I made were:  1) I added frozen carrots after I cooked the onion, mushrooms and garlic for a while. 2) Rather than cook my own chicken, I pulled apart a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (so much easier and delicious).  3) I added more wine than called for (it was a wine tasting party!).  SO GOOD!

My BF is a very big fan of this soup.  For me, having first tried Chicken and Wild Rice soup in Minnesota, it fell a little short of my expectations.  But, it's quick and easy, and it makes him happy, so it's in our rotation -- thanks for sharing.

This is a great, easy, quick soup.  The nutty flavor of the rice and the toasted almonds as a garnish made it a big hit at my house.
