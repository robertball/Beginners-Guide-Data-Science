This was really good - I liked being able to make a dip like this at home without a mix. I served with multi-grain gluten-free crackers and wavy potato chips. It just needs a little bit less milk and way more garlic. ;-)

UPDATE: I made this a second time and can say that it's a MUST to use fresh crushed/minced garlic -- do not try to substitute granulated or jarred garlic, it simply doesn't work.

Quite good! When made as listed, I found it to be just a tiny bit too thin. I think if I make this again, I will either lessen the milk or add in more mayo. We also used it on salad as a dressing and it was really good! If you are a garlic lover, you will love this!

I added a whole bunch more garlic and used heavy cream in place of milk and now it's delicious!

I made this dip for a theme party I hosted.  I almost didn't serve it because the garlic smell was pretty strong.  Well...they devoured it and praised it continuously during!!  Next time I will double it!  They all left with the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Not a bad base to start with but way to much milk and  needs more garlic. Maybe the garlic is my thing but like a pretty strong taste.

Hooray!  This tastes like a garlic-garlic dip made with a mix purchased at a party once.  Now I can make it without the mix.  I did double the minced garlic for a stronger flavor.
