This sauce came together nicely. I was worried when the fresh parmesan cheese clumped up when I added it to the sauce. It eventually worked itself out when I used my big wisk. I added just a tsp. of lemon juice, as I learned to do this with alfredo sauce from my Grandma AND I used fat free half-n-half. Other than that, I changed nothing else. This was simpler than I thought it would be. (I suck at alfredo sauces.) Very good and most comforting. EDITED: Using fat free half-n-half works but it's not the same as using whole fat. If that's okay with you, do it. It's still good, just not as rich as regular alfredo is. Me using a lower fat cream shouldn't affect the review.

I would definitely make this again.  It was quick and easy.   However, I would use more parmesan cheese next time.  I like I stronger flavor.  It would be good with red pepper flakes too.  Lastly, I mixed in steamed broccoli and thin slices of beef tenderloin.

We liked it. Simple and good. I didn't think there was enough sauce, but then it ended up being the perfect amount.

We enjoyed this quite a bit. I made small changes. I used half parm half asiago cheese and I sauteed green pepper with the garlic. I topped with some left over chicken from kabobs. Wonderful and easy.

I added onions, more garlic and seasonings and still needed some more something, but the family did like it.

Bravo! I chose this recipe out of about 8 and I'm glad I did! I did the cornstarch and water wrong so had to scoop out the lumps and used flour instead. A delicious meal!!!
I used three cloves of garlic and eyeballed the cheese.

I enjoyed this but my husband and kid did not, so I had quite a bit of leftovers for myself.  Although it was very easy to make, I should have followed my gut and doubled the sauce, it doesn't yield very much, and turned out a little dry.  This was good but it was a bummer no one else really liked it.

Good, basic sauce, altho super thick. I agree w/another reviewer that it's missing "something", just not sure what?! It's just a tad bland.

Pretty darn good. Felt like it was missing something though... maybe chicken or some veggies would really complete it.
