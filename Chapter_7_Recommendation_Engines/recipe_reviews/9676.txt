These were very good.  I skipped the rasins and nuts because we don't like them and just added a few more chips.  Very soft and moist.  I used the parchment paper as recommended and they slid right off. I also made them much smaller than suggested and lowered the cooking time. Will definetly make these again

I also had sour cream that I needed to use, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  While it is not your traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe, I thought it was very good.  I omitted the raisins and added chocolate chips and walnuts instead.  I have made this a few times already and they have turned out great every time.  You may want to underbake these slightly so they are moist.

This is a good recipe.  They definitely are soft and chewy.  Make sure you grease your cookie sheet, even non-stick.  They will stick.

I doubled the recipe, omitted the raisins and walnuts, and used half white sugar, half brown sugar and they were wonderful.  I gave some to some friends about a week after I made them and they were still moist and tasty.  I had to share the recipe with them.  Thank you for this great recipe.  I am about to make them again right now.

Dude, these are the BOMB! I replaced raisins for Craisins and pecans for walnuts. Fabulous! Don't know why everyone's complaining about the cake-ish texture. It's great for a change!

Ok, I added abut 1/2C of brown sugar and doubled the chips and left out the nuts and raisens.. I also cut the bake time to 12 minutes.  They are a very cakey cookie, but overall they turn out pretty good.  Very yummy.

These cookies tasted okay, and they were really puffy, but they are very cakelike. Not what I was looking for at all.

This is my absolute favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I've been trying to figure out the secret ingredient, and sour cream is it.  I use it every time now!

This cookie is a great change for the traditional chocolate chip cookie.  If you like raisins and nuts, the chocolate chips add a nice addition.  Good texture due to the sour cream!  Yummy!

These had a cakey texture which I like. I also did not put in the raisins which didn't appeal to me and I didn't have any walnuts so I used granulated nuts instead, worked out well. 13 minutes baking time didn't seem to be enough to brown them and I was hesitant to let them bake longer should they dry out so my cookies seem a little pale. Ah well, still a good tasting cookie in the end.

I found this recipe due to buying an abundance of sour cream on sale. The recipe is easy but makes a cake like cookie instead of the gooey kind that melts and spread on the cookie sheet. It has a very mild flavor without the intense chocolate chip flavor I prefer. If you like Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies, this is definitely NOT what you find here.

I did not find these cookies to be chewy at all.  I also thought that a little brown sugar would have helped this recipe, if not more white sugar.

My new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! It’s perfect in taste and texture, I love that they come out soft and muffin like, that’s exactly what I wanted. I, too, omitted the raisins and walnuts to accommodate taste preferences, you don’t miss them at all. I had the mini chocolate chips on hand so that’s what I used, and I think I will keep it that way. I halved the recipe and baked at 350 instead of 375 for 13 minutes because I was using a dark pan. That worked well. Thanks for the recipe, it’s a keeper!!

I had sour cream that needed to be used up so I decided to try this recipe.  I left out the raisins and nuts, and added a little more chocolate chips in their place.  We thought these were good, although we prefer my usual chocolate chip recipe.  They are soft and puffy, which I expected and was okay with.  I think a bit of salt and/or vanilla would be good additions.

I omitted the raisins and doubled the amount of chocolate chips. I also used half granulated sugar/half brown sugar instead of all granulated. What I liked about this dough is it did not need to be refrigerated. I was able to take it right from the mixer bowl to the oven. Baked at 350*, these were done at exactly ten minutes. These are cake-like in texture, not a favorite of ours but good nonetheless.

I omitted the raisins and nuts as I only wanted chocolate chip cookies, not chocolate, raisin, nut cookies.. The first batch came out  looking thin, but tasted good, the second batch, with a shorter bake time, came out thicker. They tasted good, cakey, but good.

okay, i also added 1/2 c brown sugar and i was out of baking soda so i had to sub and use 4 tsp of baking powder in place of the 1 tsp of baking soda. I also skipped the rasins and nuts and added peanut better chips with a few extra chocolate ones. They are a lil  cakeish but overall they are pretty good.

As with many others, I too left out the raisins and doubled the chocolate chips. I love the texture of these cookies. They are practically weightless!  It must be the sour cream. I will absolutely make these again.

1 1/2 cup walnuts (didn’t have pecans)
2 cups dried cranberries
1 cup choc chips

Baked 375 degrees for 12 to 13 mins on parchment.
Turned out great. They are a nice soft drop cookie. 
Yummy!

Had sour cream I needed to use up so tried something different...these cookies. As I have an allergy to nuts, just added the raisins and chocolate chips. My husband said "not bad"...which translates to okay. I agree with others regarding cakey tecture. Would I make these again? On the fence with that decision.

These are very good soft choc chip cookies, however, the recipe doesn't call for any salt, (assuming author feels salt would come from the walnuts, so if walnuts are being omitted in the recipe, add 1/2 t salt.  I read many reviews where lots of people said they omitted raisins & nuts, & I'm surprised that nobody commented on the bland taste without some type of salt.  I also used 1/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c lt brown sugar.

I substituted walnuts, raisins and choc chips for jujubes. Cut them into choc chip sized pieces and bake as you would with the other ingredients. This combo sounds weird but is AMAZING and a Christmas fave for the color. Your kids will love! Works great with this recipe, thanks for submitting!

Oh I LOVE this recipe! to put a healthier twist on it,  I substituted 1 cup of quick cooking oats for 1 cup of the flour, and 1/2 cup Splenda for baking for 1/2 cup of the sugar. I also added 1/4 cup more flour, it seemed like it needed it. I also omitted the raisins and nuts and added more choc chips! (sugar free semi sweet).

Great cookies, my kids loved them.  I left out the nuts (allergies), but left the raisins.  Loved how moist and soft they were.
