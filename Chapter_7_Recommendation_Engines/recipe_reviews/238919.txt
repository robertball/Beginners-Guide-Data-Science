Burrata is our newest addiction; it's decadent and delicious.  This is a beautiful presentation, although we find it easier to simply place the burrata on a plate, sprinkle with salt and pepper, drizzle with a good quality extra virgin olive oil, and slather it on baguette slices or tomatoes, and top with chopped fresh basil.  Try it, it's like a taste of summer.

OMG!  I never thought of using Burrata this way!  I usually just scoff it down, slowly of course.  This cheese is a bit hard to find and not likely at your local grocery but if you have a Fresh Market or cheese shop near by you should be O.K.  It's definitely worth the search and farm fresh tomatoes are mandatory!  (In a pinch, fresh mozzarella will work but not as wonderful to eat.)  Chef John has done it again!!

This recipe is my family's favorite! We added a lot of basil and the only thing we did different was add lots of balsamic which to us, gave it the kick it needs. Lots more flavor that way! We put it over a sliced banquette. Yummy!!!

Burrata, where have you been all my life?  I went to an Italian specialty store,  father/son type business and asked.  Well Pop was at the market at that very moment and an hour later I went to try my first taste of this new obsession. 

My tomatoes and basil were abundant in my garden.  In case the color is distorted,  I used yellow and orange low acid varieties,  please don't think this was an unripe red.

I love the presentation,  the flavors divine.  I wish I had company planned so I could impress someone!  I did not use any vinegar;  would have been a shame to mask the delicate flavors.  Also used Himalayan pink salt, slightly too much.   Definitely  have some crusty Italian bread on hand,  not to spread the cheese,  but to mop up every last drop of goodness from your plate.  Summer ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella are one of my favorite food.  I shall never think of them the same way again.

This was amazing.  I have never had buratta before and it is really delicious.  I used 3 large tomatoes and basil straight from the garden and cut each tomato into 4 slices.  I made 6 "buratta sandwiches", 3 with balsamic and 3 without.  We all agreed the ones with the balsamic were better. I can't wait to use the rest of the burrata tomorrow. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.

Traveled from Texas to Wisconsin to get the Buratta Cheese (okay, I went to watch the Packers play, but I wanted the cheese too).  Very good, very refreshing.  You should really try this.

Made exactly according to directions. Excellent! Burrata a little hard to find, but found at a specialty grocery store. Glad I did!

I made it exactly as the recipe. It was so much fun to experience a new type of cheese and it was fun building the presentation! I'll make this again! P.S. I found the cheese at Trader Joe's!

OMG!! You just cannot go wrong with burrata! I fell in love with burrata while pregnant with my third baby and begged our local store to start carrying it. This recipe is simple yet delicious which with burrata is all you need. I did not have fresh basil so I used dried which did not do this justice but was still yummy. The better the olive oil and balsamic the better your dish with be. Thank you chef John! Will definitely be making this again!

I could not find Burrata in the store and substituted with fresh mozzarella. I made two servings, one with the olive oil drizzled and the other serving with Balsamic vinegar. Both ways tasted great and so fresh! Very easy to prepare this dish!

So simple and so delicious! But the next time I make this, I'll try to drain the burrata (buffalo mozzarella) or buy it in a different package because it's very liquid-y when sold in a plastic carton.

I will in the future use less salt and much more basil.
