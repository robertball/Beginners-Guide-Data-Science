Ok, so a few changes were necessary, but nothing too drastic.  The basics were there.

#1.  Ignore the directions on the box & follow the recipe
#2.  Try 3/4 tsp of mint extract
#3.  Use 1/2 cup of milk after you whip the shortening and egg together
#4.  Stir until you get a sticky batter
#5.  If using a Silpat, it will take 12-15 minutes depending on how many you are baking at one time.
#6. Try putting a peppermint hershey's kiss in the middle of the cookie after it's cooled for appx. 1 min.  Not too much longer though or you won't be able to press the kiss in.
#7.  One batch makes around 34-37(ish) cookies.

Very easy and very quick to make.  They were a HUGE hit a the cookie party!

Very easy, and very good.  Makes more than 24 cookies, though!  I put a little mint M&M in the middle right after I took them out of the oven, and it made them look even more festive.  Easiest and best Crismas cookie that I have ever made!

The name is, unfortunately, really misleading. I was looking for "balls" to make for my daughter's first birthday - I was going to build a pyramid. But these are, in fact, flat cookies. Delicious flat cookies, but still not balls. Oh, and I had to add milk because there was not enough moisture to form balls.

The dough will be dry.  It will be necessary to work your shortening and egg yolk through it by hand.  If you are in a hurry, this probably isn't the best recipe for you to work with.  I found they do come out as "balls", but it's time consuming.  Also one swipe back and forth with PAM and wipe it all around your cookie sheet with a paper towel..
allow balls to cool for 15 minutes BEFORE removing from cookie sheet.  Balls will crack when they are done in the oven.  Allow balls to cool completely another 20 mns or so BEFORE rolling in confectioners sugar.  I also upped the peppermint extract to 3/4 teaspoon.  These are my husband's favorites.  They turned out great!

The cookie dough was so dry I had to squeeze the crumbs into the balls and they tasted rather dry as well. I think there is something missing from this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I was way to dry to shape into balls so I took other reviewers advice and added a half cup of milk. The balls spread into more of a cookie shape but the taste was wonderful. The second time I made them I added half a cup of crushed candy cane along with the milk. Added nice color.

Something has to be missing, the cookies turned out VERY dry and just crumbled.  Is the cake recipe suppose to be dry as directed?  Or is is suppose to be prepared as directed on the box 1st?
I followed the directions and was just very disappointed
