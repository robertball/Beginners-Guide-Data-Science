I had to make one substitution--I used apple juice instead of blueberry juice only because blueberry juice cannot be found here and apple juice was what I had on hand. I have made muffins using bran cereal before--what I did was mix all the wet ingredients together and add the bran cereal to that and let it sit for 20 minutes. After that, I folded in all the dry ingredients and the blueberries to be sure that the mixture would not be overmixed or the blueberries smashed. I baked my muffins at 350* for 20 minutes. This muffin was VERY moist with a nice chewy texture.

I thought these were just okay.  The muffins did not rise as much as I'd like them to and I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe I can modify this a little to correct that.  I might try to find a way to add more blueberry juice for flavor without having the batter become too thin.  I'm an amateur baker, so maybe someone else will perfect this before I do!  I would have given these a 2 but my husband really enjoyed them.

They are very moist and taste great but I was worried at first by the batter consistency. The batter was very runny, I had to use a ladle to spoon it in. I expected it to be much more doughy. I used cranberry juice, and frozen fresh picked blueberries. I also used bran flakes cereal. The muffins did not rise.  I will try again but may use all bran cereal instead which may absorb more liquid.

Don’t make the mistake I made....I think they mean an ‘all bran’ cereal and not flakes. I used flakes and got blueberry bran soup...had to add flour to make it muffin consistency. They should just revise the ingredient list to make it clear, I think

My version turned out awesome! Instead of using blueberry juice I replaced with a pouch of cinnamon applesauce . This made the muffins moist and flavorful . I also threw in some extra blueberries . I felt 1 cup was not enough.

I was looking for a way to use the crumbs left over from many bags of frosted wheats cereal. This worked perfectly! When I added the cereal, I simply let it sog for 10-15 minutes before continuing with the recipe. The kids loved it! (I'm sure the extra sugar from the cereal helped!)
I also didn't have any juice, so I just used the juice from the frozen berries I had put up. BTW, this works great with cherries, too!
I made as mini muffins, baked for 10-12 minutes.
I will be making it again and again. Great way to use up the dregs! Waste not, want not!
