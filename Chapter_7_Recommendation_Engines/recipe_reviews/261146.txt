Just popping in to say that this is rather delicious - I added a lot more broth and coconut milk to make a soup instead, but the flavors are spot on :) Yum.

Very good!  I almost forgot about the cilantro and started to eat it - adding the cilantro definitely made it complete. I even started with frozen chicken breasts and shredded them up at the end.
