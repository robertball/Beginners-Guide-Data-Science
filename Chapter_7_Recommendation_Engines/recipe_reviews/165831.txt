My finished results were excellent! The buffalo literally fell apart. The meat was tender and flavorful. Two thumbs up.

Did not care for this recipe.  After 6 1/2 hours in slow cooker it was not very tender and really did not have much flavor.

I tried to make this exactly as written. My brisket was a little smaller, at 2.55 lbs. I basted at 2 hours, but since the brisket was swimming in broth, I didn't baste again. I did informal fork tests for tenderness at 6 and 8 hours, and since I was getting pretty hungry, took it out at 9 hours. I carved off about a third of the meat and let the rest cook for one more hour (the full 10).
The meat was fairly tender, enough to cut small pieces with the edge of a fork and not needing a knife. But I found the flavor kind of boring. I ate it all, certainly - it just wasn't anything special. This was my first brisket of any kind, and this recipe didn't make the meat shine. As a small bonus, though, the leftover broth made several bowlfuls of decent tasting soup, as is. I probably won't make this recipe again, though.

This dish was very well received at home.  I have had Buffalo at restaurants before and this was as good as any I have been served.  I followed the exact cooking temp and time.  The only thing I changed was to put on a packet of dried onion soup mix because I didn't have any onions.  Served it with Carrots, Potatoes and "Joan's Broccoli Madness" Salad. It was a hit.
