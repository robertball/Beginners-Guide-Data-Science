We thought this was wonderful!  The demi-glace sauce is to die for.  I now make it anytime I roast a whole leg to acompany it as it is perfect with the lamb.  Two racks of lamb is a bit much for two people unless you are really hungry.  Could easily serve 3-maybe 4 people with this recipe but it was wonderful!

I browned it in skillet and then put in oven to bake. Then added sauce on top after baking and slicing. Don't know if it's necessary to brown in skillet first, I think not. It was good, expensive, worth it every once in a while.

This is a great dish. The flavors of the demi-glace are very impressive. I prop the chops against a mound of mashed potatoes, drizzle with demi-glace and garnish liberally with fresh mint. I have made it several times for friends and family, all with rave reviews. This yields a copious amount of demi-glace which I vacuum seal and stick in the freezer.

Though delicious sounding in theory, in practice this dish fell far short of advertised expectations.  The glaze was runny, black, and unappetizing.  After attempting to sear the rack of lamb as instructed, though against better judgement, a small catastrophe occurred.  After an elapsed time of thirty seconds the "seared" side of the lamb resembled something seen in a Rob Zombie petting zoo.  To the originating author I send my sincere thanks for making this an anniversary to be forgotten.

Very nice.  It did take more like 15 minutes to cook the lamb, and it I simmered the demi-glace after adding the jelly for a long time, but it never thickened.  After I gave up and decided to use it thin, it thickened as it cooled down a little.  I was worried I wouldn't like it because I wasn't really loving the smells as I was cooking it, but by the time it was all done and I tried it, it was delicious.  Half a recipe was perfect for two people.

This recipe wasn't bad. I have never really prepared meat on my own before seeing as how my previous boyfriend was a vegetarian. I am much better with vegetables. My sauce never thickened, but was very good with the lamb. I had to cook the meat even longer than 15 minutes.
