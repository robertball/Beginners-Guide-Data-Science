I am the submitter of this recipe. If you want to lessen the calories a little bit more you can omit the maple syrup and it still comes out great! I have even added 1 tsp. apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon nutmeg and maple syrup. It's like eating apple pie without the crust. Enjoy!

Great recipe! Where I was missing a few ingredients (pears and maple syrup) I changed it a bit. I used the apples I had on hand (3 med Golden Delicious 10 tennis ball sized Red Delicious) 1/4 cup water 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and 2 tsp Truvia sweetener. I microwaved it in a Rubbermaid bowl with the cover loosely placed on top for the suggested time. It came out smelling and tasting great!! I will definitely make again. Next time I'll use the pears and maple syrup.
