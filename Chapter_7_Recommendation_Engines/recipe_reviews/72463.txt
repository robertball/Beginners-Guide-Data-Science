Oh yeah, baby.  This one is a winner!  Ironically, having been an allrecipes.com member for a long time, I actually learned of this recipe from a posting at another website.  Thankfully, they gave proper credit to allrecipes.com.  I didn't have the mushrooms called for in the recipe, so I just used a 10 ounce can of mushroom stems and pieces, and it was exceptional.  I'm trying to eat healthier again and this one is a nice choice for that.  Next time, I may add more onions, potatoes, and roasted red peppers ... more would have been better, especially if one doesn't prepare another side dish.  Good stuff!

This was a delicious recipe. My family loved it.  I did have a problem getting the potatos to be done enough.  I think next time I may put the potatos in first and then add the salmon nearer to the end.  I will definately make this again.

This is VERY GOOD! Some of the reviews make me wonder if people actually followed the recipe. It is true that the potatoes dont get done enough, realizing this we actually cut the potatoes super thin and cooked them with the onions for  fifteen minutes... But they still werent done. This dish has a very simple, clean flavor. We made sure to season each layer very well with salt and pepper and followed the recipe to the letter.  Will definitely make again but cook potatoes longer before adding the rest of the ingredients....

This was easy to make. The end result was not good for me. I had to cook it longer b/c the potato was still crunchy which made the salmon overcooked but that wasn't the main issue. The main thing was the flavours just didn't meld together, they were very individual.  I think frying the onions with some butter a little garlic, cooking the potato a little and adding some more spice to the salmon would make it better. And perhaps covering with tinfoil for a bit.

This is a wonderful recipe. Very tasty, easy to make, and looks attractive. I used one enormous sweet onion, fresh red pepper strips, and canned mushroom pieces instead of the portabellos. I baked it on the lowest rack to be sure the potatoes cooked through (and sliced them less than 1/2" thick). The onion was slightly undercooked, crisp-tender and sweet. The baking dish was nearly full, and made a very appetizing appearance on the table. Love this recipe!

I enjoyed this very much. I will add a touch of garlic the next time I maket it. I did not use sesame oil as I do not care for the taste of it. I used more olive oil and the flavor was lovely.

Thank you...this recipe is a keeper!

This recipie was a hit with my family! They loved it, but I agree with Konnan the potatos are still crunchy after the 45 minuts. I advise to cook the potatos atleast 15 mins befor everything else, to give them a chance to cook and not OVER cook the fish.

This was just okay, nothing special. There are so many exceptionally good salmon recipes on this site, but this isn't one of them.

Very nice recipe, easy to play with. I was concerned that the salmon would overcook in that amount of time so I mixed the veggies and cut the mushroom into large pieces and sprayed all with a mixture of the lemon juice, sesame oil and olive oil. I pan roasted the seasoned veggies (yam instead of potato) for 15 minutes and then popped marinated  salmon on top for another 30 minutes or so. Yum

This turned out pretty good, but the timings are way off. Like others have noted, 45 minutes is way too long to bake a piece of salmon. I sliced my potatoes paper thin, and they were just about all cooked properly after 35 mins. I then added the salmon, and baked for another 12. This was ok, but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

This dish did not have enough taste.  I added lots of fresh garlic which helped somewhat.

If anyone made this dish and liked the potatoes... you severely destroyed your fish. This dish is impossible to make as instructed, and I am shocked this one came into my inbox. A simple hack is required here. Boil your potatoes until soft, place them on TOP of the fish. Viola, crispy potato’s on perfect fish. Increase temp and cook for less time. I like my fish medium rare (salmon/tuna... never halibut).

May I suggest for those like myself who have a hard time deciding from all the wonderful recipes here: I was torn between this and the "spicy garlic salmon" recipe.  I LOVE the fact that all the ingredients for a full meal are in this one and that the natural taste would definately blend well, but again I was torn... so I combined the two.. the mushrooms were underneath the salmon and then the sauce for the salmon taken from the spicy garlic version!!!  mmmmmm.  Thanks for a great meal idea :)

It only needs a little bit more seasoning. I would recommend Tastefully Simple Seasoned Salt. But overall satisfactory and I enjoyed the feeling of healthy eating.

Salmon is one of my favorite fish to cook with.
As my wife doesn't like tomatos and fish together, I was excited to break out the roasted red peppers, they bring a great flavor to the fish that pairs exceptionally well with the lemon and red onion.  I did not use potatoes, I love asparagus, so that went in the pan along with onion and portobella mushrooms, fresh and lots of them.  I cooked the salmon in parchment layered with onion, red peppers, and surrounded by cilantro.  Oh man, the Wife said the last fish I made was a 7, but not to worry, this one is a 10!

I simply cannot Believe it's taken me SO LONG to eat this fish dish! OMG:) I used a chicken rub (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Roasted-Chicken-Rub/?prop31=1) on this a few hours before dinner. Fantastic flavor!! I didn't have any mushrooms, LOL too lazy to go to back to the market:)"". I read that some folks had trouble getting the potatoes to cook, so I hedged my bets and nuked mine before I put them on the fish. I was going for a pretty presentation, so I stacked everything On top. Cynthia, you waited a LONG time for a photo, I hope you like it.:) Thank you very much! Loved it!

I also had trouble getting the potatoes to cook even when I used the longer cooking time specified.  Maybe if I had sliced them with the food processor (which would get them thinner than by hand) or covered the dish with foil (it wasn't specified in the recipe) it would have helped, but I can just bake salmon, sautee vegetables, and steam or bake potatoes.

Very good recipe. It took longer than 45 minutes for the potatoes to cook, so next time I would be sure to cut them thinner.
