I have never had chess pie. My friends were talking about how good it is and easy to make so I looked it up and made this one. Really easy. I had to cook it a lot longer but there wasnt any left by the time everyone had all they wanted.

I gave this recipe to my sister, and she made it at home. She said it was really good.  When she came to visit, I got her to make it for us, and it was really good.  She used brown sugar instead of white, and evaporated milk.

This does not taste like chess pie at all.  It is a very good custard pie, and they brown up beautifully with the beaten egg whites mixed in, but I was a little dissapointed.  Probably won't make again, but if you like custard pie, go for it.  Thanks Liz.

This deserves more that 5 stars.  Wow, this is a great pie. I wanted to try a Chocolate Chess Pie, but didn't like those recipes. So I choose this one instead. Only wanted 1 pie, so I made half of it.  I added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa to it (did not add any extra sugar). I was almost afraid that it would not make a full 9 in. deep dish pie, as I made my own crust.  It worked out perfect. I accidently forgot to add the flour! So I cooked it about an hour.  It turned out fine.  The chocolate and egg whites stayed at the top and the bottom was custard. Thanks for sharing a great recipe, I sure will use it over and over again.
