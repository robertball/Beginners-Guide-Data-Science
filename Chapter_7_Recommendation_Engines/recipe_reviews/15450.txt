These are fabulous-tasting and no one has ever resisted them. I would have given them a 5 except that I found wrapping the dough around the candies to be a bit of a challenge. Be sure to create a complete seal around the candies--otherwise the goo will spill out, which is fine if they are just for you (chocolate is chocolate!) but it doesn't work well if you're presenting them to friends or family. Still, they are highly decadent, even without the white chocolate, which I omitted.

I made over 300 of these for our fellowship's Vacation Bible School and everyone LOVED them. We baked them right there on the campus so they were still warm and nicely gooey. I didn't bother with the white chocolate drizzled over the top to make things easier. (I also made one that had a York peppermint patty in it instead of a Rolo and that one was even better than the original.) Mine didn't look like the ones in the picture. Mine flattened out a lot more and had deep cracks like molasses cookies. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to print up copies of the recipe for the many people who requested it from me.

I have made this recipe several times- it is always a hit!  People love it!  I use Rolos and I don't bother with the white chocolate, it is decadent enough without it.  Awesome recipe.

These were delicious..time consuming but worth it..I used Brachs caramels..Next time I will try Kraft..caramels were a bit hard and chewy..Hoping a different brand might be more tender.

Awesome!  Word of advice though- do NOT cool on wire racks!  The caramel will fall right out of the soft cookie!  I put parchment paper on top of the rack after the first few cookies emptied themselves out.

I have been making these cookies for years and everyone loves them!  I use Rolos as well and find it works best if I let the dough sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before I wrap them around the candies, it makes it much easier to work with.  Since it is a time consuming recipe, I always at least double the recipe. When I make the cookies I put the balls of dough (uncooked)on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for an hour, then you can transfer them to a freezer bag--you have a bunch already made up and can make as few or as many as you want when you want some!

These are great. After awhile of playing with them, I finally figured out how to do it. I kept a pile of powdered sugar in front of me on parchment paper, so I could put my palm  and finger tips in it to keep them coated. I would take a TBLSP. of dough out [approximately] and put it in the palm of my hand, flatten with finger tips to a size of a small pancake, put your caramel in center, fold up sides and pinch close. Roll between your two palms. Keep putting your fingers in the powdered sugar as needed. Roll in sugar. Scrumptious

Really good cookies.  My 9 year old sells cookies to family and friends to make extra money.  After reading the recipe name, he decided he wanted to add these to his offerings.  I thought it might be too complicated for him after reading other reviewers comments about the difficulty of the dough.  He didn't have any issues getting the dough around the caramels.  Of course, he made them completely by himself so he may have added or omitted something that I don't know of (lol).  I think next time he makes them, I will melt down the caramels and put into candy molds to flatten out as the cookies were pretty tall and would come out prettier if flatter.

These are phenomenal!!!! These will be the new "go-to" cookies in our house.  They are rich, so it is easy not to over-indulge.  It is easy to over do it on the sugar coating; a little goes a long way on the final product.

I have made these cookies several times.  They are best warm out of the oven.  I use rolos and leave out the pecans.   They dough is sticky when you have to put it around the rolo.  I have found that if you spray your hands with some Pam it helps.

I just won an cookie contest with these!  Although I put a small peanut butter cup in each one, omitted the white chocolate and sugar, and placed a peanut on top of each cookie.

I hope this is the same recipe I've used in the past! I lost my other one. The dough is chilling now! We call them Santa Surprises at our house and only make them at Christmastime. I am excited to try some of the suggestions I've read! One thing I like to do is change up the candy. We use Rolos and Snickers and today I'm going to try York Peppermint Patties! :-)

These were very rich and chocolaty.  I did chill the dough for about half an hour prior to rolling and baking since my dough felt a bit too sticky to handle at first.  I also used parchment paper which made getting them off a tray very easy, and waited about 3 minutes prior to removing from the tray.

This recipe was a frustration for me! When I was mixing the first ingredients, gooosh, the smell was amazing! I followed all steps exactly (expect I didn't used pecans) but all started to fail when I start warping the caramels.. it's impossible to do it with your hands, and flour doesn't help a bit. I start doing it with two spoons, it was ok. When I took it from the oven, my God! The caramel was completely melted into the cookie sheet and I barely could move the cookies without breaking them. The taste was not what I expected, and I chocolate and caramel are my favorite flavors in the world. I didn't liked this cookies at all.. :(

Holy cow! These were good! I realized I didn't have cocoa after mixing the wet igredients so I melted 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips and added it to the wet ingredients instead. After adding rolos I tried out cherry cordial kisses, and assorted mini chocolate bars (milky way, three musketeers, twix etc.) they were amazing. I didn't add the white chocolate, and I only rolled half of them in sugar. They were amazing! The only problem with so many varieties, is you have to try every one!

Excellent cookie! With a very fudgie base, I found using a cookie baller and a floured finger to work best for stuffing the 'ball'. load up the scoop, squish a rolo inside, and seal. I also did not drizzle choc. over the top (didn't have any :)and they were great just like that. I doubled the recipe and got just over 6 dozen evenly sized balls... one perk about the cookie scoop!

I've made these twice (without the frosting).  They are fabulous and everyone loves them!  I made them for my grandsons birthday and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used Rolo's one time, but Doves choc. covered caramel the second.  They were just as good both times.  I highly recommend these.

Very good ... wrapping the caramel is tedious ... use caramel that will melt and spread easily.  Make sure there are no openings on the bottom for it to leak through.  In addition, I tried cooling them upside down sometimes ... I skipped the white chocolate drizzle.

A hit at the ladies cookie exchange during the holiday season! Also a hit year-round. I've made them with mini reeses, rolos, and junior mints in the middle. I made these for my roommates when I first moved in and one exclaimed, "dang girl, you sure can bake a cookie!"

It took such a long time! Even though I chilled the dough,within minutes of taking it out, the dough was melting in my hands.  Also, my first batch was too soft when I followed the 10 minute bake time. So for the second and third batches (I had to bake 3 batches to finish the dough!) I baked it for 25 minutes and it turned out better.

These were great and gone in a flash at a church dinner.  My wife made these and at least 4 or 5 people came and asked for the recipe with one saying they were the best cookie ever.  They were chewy and excellent.  Will definitely be doing again.  She took the minature peanut butter cups and cut them in half and used those, and those were the best.

Instant keeper. I omitted the pecans, used 26 caramels (recipe made 26 cookies), slightly warmed and flattened and I was out of white chocolate chips so I used butterscotch. Very good!

I thought these would be perfect for my taste, but I was shocked when I didn't love them. They were just *shrug* okay. I think the flavor is too subtle and creamy - it needs something to jump out, flavour wise. Maybe cinnamon?
I used the rolos and they came out fabulously gooey.

I liked this recipe & will use it again. It has great flavor. I would give a 5 as a perfect addition to my cookie trays except I found it's not mentioned in the recipe to cool completely on the pan verses not transferring to wire rack. I saw they were starting to fall & caught most I'm time before having a Carmel mess to clean

These cookies are always a hit & there are never any left.  It helps to keep the unwrapped candies in the freezer until you are ready to use them.

Wonderful recipe! I have made these several times and they are always a hit!  I keep them premade in the freezer, and when I have company just pop them right into the oven and serve them warm - you don't need the drizzle on top, they are delicious without it.  I also like many other reviewers use rolos.

The white choclate made it to sweet, and I didn't add the nuts, and I rolled it in flour instead of sugar.
