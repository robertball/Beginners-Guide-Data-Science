Fantastic! I used a homemade version of "chili" sauce not knowing what "chile" sauce was. I made a half portion (using skin-on, leg quarters) in a 7-quart pressure cooker. I started with a bit more sauce and water than written just in case. After 15 minutes, the chicken wasn't cooked all the way and needed a bit more liquid. After 22 minutes total, the chicken was cooked throughout; tender-literally falling off the bone; and juicy with extra sauce. The flavor was unbeatable. Really, really delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe.  But I cheated and used our favorite bottled barbecue sauce adding the onions, vinegar and water to it.  Halved the recipe (only 2 of us) and I cooked an extra 5 minutes but the sauce was still too runny and didn't stick to the chicken.  So I put the chicken under the broiler until crispy.  It did have very good flavor and was tender.   Next time I will probably only add half the water or none at all.  Update:  Made again using no extra water in the cooker.  Worked better  but still needed to broil to crisp and caramelize the sauce.

I used 3 packages  of Costco's boneless thighs, and Stubb's sweet heat Barbque sauce  instead of chili sauce.  The 3 grandkids and 4 adults gobbled it up --- no leftovers. My Christmas present, Power pressure cooker XL , was on for 15 minutes, with immediate cool down. Next time I'll try 10 minutes. Great recipe,thanks!

Loved it! Didn't have chilli sauce  on hand so I substituted generic bbq sauce. The next time I'd double the delicious sauce as I served it on a bed of rice.

This was easy and tasty.  I made it exactly as the recipe said other than adding a little more liquid as recommended by an earlier review.  I don't think I would have had to....but it never hurts to have extra sauce. :)

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe. The chicken came out OK and the sauce was OK, but it tasted absolutely NOTHING like barbecue sauce!

I am so happy to see a pressure cooker recipe on one of my usual recipe sites. I recently cooked chicken in my 6qt Power Pressure cooker. It came out great! I didn't use this recipe but I'm sure it will come out great when I do. More Pressure cooker recipes please.

It still tasted OK, but 15 minutes and "natural release" basically made it mush.

Very tasty and tender! Used 6 hind quarters  weighed 2.8 # before deboned and removed skin. Substituted chili sauce with Famous Daves Hot and Sassy barbecue sauce. Had plenty of sauce.  Pressure cooked for 12 minutes and let it cool naturally for 5 minutes before released steam. Going to make again but may try different sauce next time.

Made it pretty much as the recipe, but not a big fan of "creole seasoning" so made my own, was GREAT! Having an avocado tree, I'll be making this again, and again.....

So this is what the rest of the world refers to as BUFFALO chicken. Not BBQ. But it was still delicious! But maybe change the name? =)

Was a great tasting dish. First dish in new quick pressure pot. Family enjoyed it. But little watery after cooking. May have to use less water than recipe calls for.

Followed recipe exactly except not 15 min. pressure cooking! No, no! My pressure cooker is 15 lbs pressure, so it was 8 min., then let pressure drop off by itself. Chicken color was mustard yellow and though "good", did not taste at all like barbeque.  Adding the Fred's Hot Sauce gave it the photo red color and spiced it up. Since I like using my p-cooker, will probably  try this recipe again, but with a BBQ sauce instead.

1. No way on God's green earth should this be called barbecue when it doesn't use barbecue sauce/ingredients nor does it use barbecue technique.
2.  Flavor was just okay for what is was.  
3.  Would not make again, it'd be a waste of chicken.

This was tasty.  The flavor is not representative of an American's idea of barbecue, but it is still a good dish.  I would make it again.  A little more flavor would push this up to an amazing/great recipe.

Yummy.I did not add anything else to the recipe,otherwise I might as well submit my own.
