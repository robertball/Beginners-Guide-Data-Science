!e loved these cookies. The butterscotch morsels make the cookie. I used a small scoop instead of a large scoop. I flattened the cookies with a flat bottomed cup on a parchment paper that I sprayed with cooking spray. I placed the cookies in the refrigerator for one hour.  I also made some cookies without the Oreos by just using a small scoop and baking. Both ways make for a great cookie.

I made this for a weekend cabin trip and they were a huge hit - they are the size of a slider though, so basically a meal replacement. A delicious meal replacement! The oatmeal-scotchie sans the oreo is delicious, and the oreo in the middle takes it over the top. Next time, I might try flattening them a bit more, but overall they turned out great!

These are interesting cookies that do take some time.  I got to the part where you add the cinnamon chips and discovered to my dismay that what I thought were cinnamon chips were instead white chocolate chips, and I had to go with those.  I followed the recipe, letting them sit in the fridge for several hours before baking them.  My first tray burned like crazy into flat puddles with a big bump (the Oreos) on top.  I turned the heat down to 350 and got a better second tray.  I do think that the double-stuffed cookies were just too much and would recommend just regular cookies.  I will try these again using cinnamon chips since I realize that those chips would make a huge difference!  Thanks for an interesting cookie!
