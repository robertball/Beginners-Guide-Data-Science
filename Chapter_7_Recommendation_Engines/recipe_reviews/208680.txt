Perfect for the wanna be gourmet chef with NO TIME!!  YUM!!  I wasn't sure how this was going to taste.. figured it would be really good or really weird.. Well, it was really good.. even my picky teenage boy loved it.  Very easy and quick to make and even super healthy.  I will definitely be making this to share at family dinners...

My family loved this! I think it helped that the avocado and grapefruit we had were absolutely perfect in ripeness.  We had never tried fennel before but were pleasantly surprised by it's flavor, unusual but not weird.  I served this salad over romaine lettuce and it was a great side to a mexican meat dish.  I will make this again.

This was extremely bitter.  The tastes complimented each other so some extent.  If I made it again, I would put less fennel and a little more honey.

This salad was every bit as good as it sounded (or better).  Even my son ate it.  I left out the grapefruit because my husband doesn't like it, but I didn't feel it was missing anything.  (I left out the extra salt in the recipe.  The fennel had a slight saltiness to it already, and with the lime juice, I didn't feel it needed any extra salt - just a personal preference).

Really good.  Not amazingly great, but solidly good.  It was nice and tangy, and the contrasting textures were a pleasure.  A few generous dashes of powdered cayenne made it worlds better.

First let me say that we'll try anything and the odd combination of ingredients wasn't a turnoff.  I really wanted to like this, but it was just eh.  The citrus tasted good but the avocado and the fennel were just blah and bland.  Maybe we just had bad fennel, but I was expecting a bit more juicy crunch.  We ate it all and it wasn't exactly repulsive or anything, but it just didn't have a compelling taste that made me want to eat more of it.

This is a crisp fruit salad and the flavors mix okay.
However, I found it too bitter. I couldn't really force myself to eat a second helping and felt bad wasting the food. I think the only reason I liked it is because I love avocados. 

It took me a little longer than indicated, but it could be that I had to cut the fruit on a cutting board. I did not know how to do it over the bowl.   Also I could not get the honey to dissolve into the lemon and fruit juice mixture.   The addition of the fennel gave it a nice mix of textures. 

Creative recipe, but it was difficult to eat.   Maybe it would be better if the pieces were smaller.  Could some kind of flavoring, but I'm not sure what...maybe maple syrup.
