Great recipe, you're right out the macadamia nuts, they are a nice surprise in this creme brulee.  It wasa  little bit too sweet for me so next time i would probably reduce the sugar amount or use a less sweet chocolate.  This is a winner, made for a dinner party and admired by all.  I served it with strawberries in cointreau which provided a good balance.

I followed the recipe to a T and it never completely set up.  The flavor is great but I've got more of a thick, cold soup...

The first time I tried this recipe I followed it exactly and the custard never set (even tried increasing bake time).  After asking one of my friends, she suggested using more egg yolks.  So the 2nd time I used 8 yolks and kept all the other ingredients the same.  It turned out perfectly!  I do suggest getting the water in the pan and then turning the oven on to preheat.  That way by the time you're done with the mixing, the water is hot and this helps to bake the custard properly.  Keep in mind more egg yolks means even more calories! Lol

If only this was zero calories... No matter. Make this and grab a TABLESPOON to eat it with.

Macadamia nuts are great in this recipe. I made it for Easter dessert and will be making it for Christmas. It was my first time making creme brulee and it turned out perfect. A great recipe!

This would not set up for me, even though I baked it for an extra 15 minutes or so...we also found it very sweet.  I usually read all the reviews before I make a recipe, and I wish I had this time...someone had suggested adding 2 more egg yolks to it to help it set up.  I have tried other creme brulee recipes and had wonderful success...so I'm not sure what I did wrong this time.

I have made this twice and both times the brulee turned out wonderfully!  My guests loved it and requested the recipe.  The nuts add a twist that really makes a unique flavor.  Be sure to toast the nuts as directed this brings the flavor out more.

I was nervous about making my first creme brulee, but it was so easy and it turned out great !! My only suggestion is to use 1 teaspoon instead of the brown sugar.

Very, very good!  My family loved the crunchy macadamia nuts with each bite of the creamy pudding.  I doubled the vanilla and served cooled to room temp.  Just wonderful - Thanks!

This was easy peavey to make and delicious.  It was, however, overpoweringly rich and sweet.  Anything more than a small portion would be too much.  But yummy!

My creme brulee was not as thick as I would have liked it to be, but it wasn't soupy either.  My advice to anyone making this recipe is, make sure to use boiling water to pour into the baking dish.  That always helps it set more.
