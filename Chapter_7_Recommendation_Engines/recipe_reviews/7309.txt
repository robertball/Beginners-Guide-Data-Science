This cake was TOO dense and dry (especially when refrigerated), but the flavor was very chocolatey and good.  The topping was interesting...the sugar/nut portion never turned into a powder (was this really supposed to happen?)...so the frosting was whipped butter with crunchy toffee pieces.  Many people said they loved the cake, but I don't plan on making it again.

"A very dense and rich chocolate cake. This recipe works best if you use sweet cream butter and a very fine quality of chocolate."
