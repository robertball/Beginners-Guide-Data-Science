Loved this recipe!  I made it for company to serve as a side dish to some paella, and it was fantabulous!  Very easy to make, and has a wonderful texture, like bread pudding.  Highly recommend trying this one!

this recipe has been passed around at family functions for years. it is WONDERFUL... the only thing that needs to change is instead of using bread crumbs, crumble up ritz crackers. the butter flavor from the crackers makes this dish perfect!!!

My family loves this.  This is the second year I've made it and this time I found Hawaiian Bread.  It was good with plain white bread but a bit less sweet.  Next time I'll make it with a good oat bread.

This recipe was perfect for what I was looking for!  I wanted a pineapple dessert, and this one really hit the spot.

The last time I made this, I was doubling the recipe when I realized I only had one can of pineapple.  I added a can of peaches, drained and diced, instead.  A little bit of toasted coconut on top after baking, and we had the perfect tropical treat.

Absolutely fantastic! I served this with ribs and everyone loved it. I used a fresh pineapple rather than canned and the proportions seemed right. I'll definitely make this again.

Very sweet and rich. Made for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Many complements! Still, best in small portions as an after dinner treat.

Fantastic!! I tweaked a bit: used pineapple in chunks and used tapioca instead of the breadcrumbs ( 2 1/2 cups), used whipped cream ( from heavy cream) to make it look fancy, and my kids LOVED IT! I whipped the heavy cream without any sugar and it helped to balanced out the sweetness of the other ingredients. I used it as a dessert, but I would use it as a side dish next. Easy to prepare, too.

I make this everytime we have ham, and it is always a hit.  Guests remark with curiosity until they taste it, then with raves.  This is my favorite side dish by far.

This is delicious!!  I always serve it with ham.  I have not tried any of the variations but this basic recipe is yummy. Try it with the Sangria Ham (cooked in a crockpot.)
