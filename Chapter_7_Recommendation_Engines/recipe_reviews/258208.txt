It was really easy to make. The spicy and sweet tropical flavors came together really well. I added some pineapple and red onions on skewers with the marinated shrimp and it proved to be a great addition. It's a great light summery dish!

Good, doubled the recipe, did a room temp 30 min marinade and added a touch of extra honey.  Didnâ€™t have mango nectar but I had a mango guava juice (usually blended with Bacardi!) that worked just fine.

This was a tasty marinade.  I tweaked to use what I had in the pantry.  I used a mango fruit spread for the nectar and honey, just pulsed in the blender until liquified.  Brushed the shrimp with a honey BBQ sauce at the final stages of grilling.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

Excellent flavors, although a little too hot for the rest of my family.  It's easy enough to cut back the cayenne next time.  I skipped the chili sauce to reduce sugar content as I just thought it wasn't necessary, and never missed it at all.  I'd definitely make this again.

I was super happy with this recipe! I didn't have the mango nectar, so I omitted it and it still turned out great. I've never worked with mango nectar so I don't know if it would have made the marinade thicker, which would have been nice, but I let it marinade for 4 hours, so the flavor was plentiful. Now I have to hide it into some noodles or something so my kids will eat it. My wife and I enjoyed them right off the skewer.

I loved the taste of the marinade but it didn't really come through as much as I would have liked after about an hour and a half of marinating.  I think next time I would double the marinade mixture, soak the shrimp for significantly longer in half of it, and reserve the other half to cook and thicken with a corn starch slurry for dipping.
