I always use Penzeys Spices and Arizona Dreaming was exactly what I had on hand when I went looking for a recipe for this.  I had a craving and used Frozen corn that I charred a bit in a skillet on the stove,  Made this as a side with a pork tenderloin rubbed with the same Arizona Dreaming mix.

Loved this and I especially loved the fact the sauce was just drizzled over the top instead of stirred in like most call for. It makes for a much better presentation this way. I also liked the flavor the ancho gave it. Great recipe and a definite keeper!
