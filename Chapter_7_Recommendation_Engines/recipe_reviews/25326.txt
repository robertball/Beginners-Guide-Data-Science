Decided to try new family tradition, and serve a meatless meal once a week. Recipe was easy to put together. Baked them in the oven and then placed them into spaghetti sauce. 
Flavor was a bit bland so will add more seasoning and cheese. I used a 1/4 measuring cup to be sure meatballs were same size, but I think I will make them a bit small next time.
Sixteen year old liked them along with my husband, but my nine year old ate the spaghetti, but not the meatballs.

I made the basic recipe and added cheese topping and I also added oatmeal. I added beef flavoring and rolled it into balls, greased a pan, poured barbeque sauce over it and baked it about 45 minutes ar 325..It was so good. My husband ate some of the meat balls and has no idea there is no hamburger in it..

Love them.  Quick to make, would cut cooking time with smaller balls.  I used melon scoop, 3/4 full and got about 3 dozen.  Used oregano instead of parsley and left salt out, doubled the Parmesan cheese, and used home made bread crumbs from whole wheat bread.  Thanks!

These really are very good. I only made half a batch, because I didn't have many eggs. I wish I'd made more for snacks! These are so very tasty! I read the other reviews about them being dry, so about halfway through the baking time I drizzled them with olive oil. I didn't have "italian" breadcrumbs, so I just used plain and added some herbs (to be honest, I don't really pay attention when I'm sprinkling, I just start with oregano and go until it smells right). The flavor is awesome, but there is a "springiness" to their texture that is a little strange. After mixing everything, it was so liquid-y there was no way that I could have shaped this into balls, so I added another 1/2 cup or so of breadcrumbs. In the future, I will use 2 eggs and a little olive oil for a half batch. I think the oil should help with the moistness issue.  I recommend trying these.

This is a creative approach to a vegetarian version of meatballs. This can be described as springy type of bread ball.  A couple things I did differently though. The amount of parmesan cheese was doubled. A tablespoon of both ketchup and Worcestershire sauce were added to create more moisture. Instead of one clove of garlic, a teaspoon of garlic powder was added so its flavors can be distributed more evenly. Salt was slightly increased and added Â½ tsp of oregano to create a bolder flavor. 
Since these are a bit dry, I would recommend adding a sauce factor. For example, place them on bare pasta noodles and pour the sauce on top. Some even mentioned baking with a sauce. Because of the dry texture, I would make the meatball portions a little bit smaller. This is certainly a very unique vegetarian recipe.

really great, added some minced onion. Yummy! Definitely add them right to sauce so they don't dry out. they absorb the sauce very well. Make this as is and let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, then form the meatballs. I make this all the time, the vegetarians in my family looooove it

This was great. I replaced half of the breadcrumbs with oats, added sauteed green peppers and a half package of tofu.

They were okay. They tasted like little loaf's of bread though, cute, but not really meatball-y.

This is pretty bland, but is okay when you are going to marinate it in something, or put a sauce over the top.  Quick and easy.

I just made these, and right now, they're mosit and smell amazing... I'm going to be adding them to spaghetti sauce and having them with supper tonight. I didn't have any parsley, so I added some garlic powder in its place.  I also added a little water, to make sure they'd turn out moist.  When I spooned them out, I shaped into ball be wetting my hands, and I think that added to them being moist... I cannot wait for supper and for my clients to try them.

My father used to make these when I was a little girl as a special lunch.  He used to make them into patties and fry them.  I used to love them.  I made them for lunch for me and my 2 yr old son.  My son likes it, but I guess I outgrew them.  They are bland and not how I remember them.  But thank you for the memory!

I find meatless meatball delicious. If you are trying to eat less meat or trying to reduce cost at the market. Being a single bachelor.

It's okay but very bready. It would be nice if there was some kind of protein in this recipe.

These have a great flavor, but were a bit dry.  We will try them once again - to see if a different bread crumb makes them less dry.  We used a whole wheat bread crumb from home-made bread.  Possible if we had used the bread crumbs that can be bought in the store they would have been better.
