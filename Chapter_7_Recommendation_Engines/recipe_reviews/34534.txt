This recipe turned out WONDERFUL! The only thing I did different was to bake the roast for 10 minutes at 450 degrees, then turn the oven down to 325 and bake it until it got up to temperature.  This is a technique I learned in cooking school.  Cooking a roast at a very high temperature for a short amount of time (10 minutes) sears the outside of the roast and helps to lock in moisture during the remainder of the cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe to prepare in a clear plastic cooking bag. No need to baste, with juicy results! Shake a little flour inside the bag before baking, to prevent sticking. No fuss, and easy cleanup.The sauce adds the final crowning touch! Yum...

I should give this recipe 5 stars for the marinade alone. Marinated over night, it made the most delicious pork loin I’ve ever eaten. I made it last night for “Halloween” dinner and paired it with seasonal veggies and cranberry stuffing. It was a perfect combination. The sauce was divine, but be prepared for the sweetness. I added about a tablespoon of Thai chili sauce for a spicy kick and couldn’t have been happier with the results. I also followed another reviewers advice and let the sauce cool a little to thicken. Because the sauce was so sweet I ended up making gravy on the side in case people didn’t like it…the gravy wasn’t touched once. Gravy…not touched. Now that’s a triumph.

Excellent!  I made this last night for my husband, parents and grandmother.  They all loved it.  My mother and grandmother wanted copies of the recipes so that they can make it for upcoming holiday parties.  It was wonderful - very flavorful and the currant sauce makes it delicious.  

A tip from my experience:  Let the currant sauce cool for a while.  It thickens and turns into a beautiful glaze.

TERRIFIC RECIPE.  THANK YOU!

I love to try different recipes.  The first time I made this pork was probably two years ago.  It is so incredibly awesome.  I generally marinate it overnight and throw it in the slow cooker in the morning.  When I make the currant sauce I put in just a touch of corn starch to thicken slightly.  This will again be part of my Christmas buffet table.  And mark my words - it will get the most comments.

I halved this recipe and used with 5 small pork chops instead.  I followed the directions exactly the same, except I baked the pork chops in some of the marinade mixture and only for 15-20 minutes (until cooked thoroughly).  The chops were wonderful by themselves, BUT the currant sauce--YUM!--made them taste even better!  It was THE PERFECT complement to the meat.  The flavors melded together so well!  Thank you Jackie!  I will definitely make this again!!

The taste was excellent and the pork came out very tender. It did come out a bit too salty for my taste so next time I will use lite soy sauce. I also had to occasionally add water to the pan while baking to avoid having the marinade dry out and burn. As suggested by another reviewer, I roasted the loin at 450 for 10 minutes and then lowered to 325 for the remainder. It took about one and a half hours to cook.

Made this for yesterday (Sunday Dinner)... what a HUGE hit!  Everyone just loved the sauce.  I had to use Plum Jelly because my grocer was out of Currant Jelly... it still was wonderful.  I bet a Black Berry Jelly would even be great.  Experiment with it.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!  : )))))))

Wow! My first ever pork roast was a huge success thanks to this recipe. I used fresh ginger and fresh thyme. Used an oven bag (no need to baste) to decrease the cooking time and took the pork out when the meat thermometer read 155 degrees (it continued to cook after I removed it from the oven). Everyone wanted extra currant sauce. I used half a jar of red and half a jar of black currant jelly, since I didn't know which one would taste better. Can't wait to make it again.

How oustanding was this!  Truly delicious, and a festive way to start 2011.  I made the marinade exactly as written and marinated my 4 lb boneless pork loin roast overnight.  Next morning I placed a large sheet of foil in the slow cooker horizontally, one vertically, and placed the roast and marinade in and sealed it up.  Slow cooked for 7 1/2 and it was perfectly tender and delicious.  I prepared the sauce as published, just added some shallot and pork broth, thyme & cracked pepper to the sauce.  Very, very good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jackie.  Happy New Year, everyone!

My whole family thought this was wonderful!  However, I didnt use the currant sauce.  I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly.  Wrapped it in foil and baked it in the oven with the marinade.  It came out so moist and flavorful.  Cant wait to make it again!

We made this dish for a formal dinner fundraiser for our youth group.  We served 200 people.  I marinated the pork overnight and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The flavor was wonderful and we received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  The only change we made was to add dried cranberries to the sauce for presentation sake.  The cranberries plumped up nicely and were a great touch.  I'll be making this dish for my family's Christmas dinner.

Very simple recipe and everyone loved this roast.  I added fresh grated ginger along with the dry and baked the roast at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then lowered the oven to 325 degrees.  This helped to sear the outside of the roast and kept it very moist.

I thought the marinade and currant sauce was top notch - served for my annual Friends Christmas Dinner Party - was a big hit.  I cooked the roast covered as the garlic pieces began to get too brown - too soon.  The flavor was wonderful!!

This was a great recipe.  I didn't change a thing, other than the cooking method.  I marinated the roast overnight, and then used a rotisserie. A 5 pound roast took about 2 hours.  I basted the roast during the entire process, and the meat was wonderfully flavorful and moist.  The currant sauce was fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this for a dinner party of 16 for a client.  She reported back that it was definitely a hit for her and her guests!!  I marinated this the day before in ziplock bags and then roasted it in a covered roasted except for the last 30 minutes or so for it to brown.  The loins were tender and juicy.  The sauce tops off the whole dish!

This is such a great recipe, especially for a large party. I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and bake at 450 degrees for the 1st 10 minutes and the meat came out moist and juicy. Awesome recipe - thanks so much!

I followed this recipe up until the point that I opened the oven to baste it after the first hour.  The marinade in the pan (actually a pyrex dish) was burned to a crisp.  Luckily the roast was on a rack so it was saved from the burnt marinade.  Also, the roast (a 4.8 lb pork tenderloin) was sitting at 165 degrees so I could not leave it for the specified 2.5 - 3 hrs or it would have been leather.

My girlfriend made this recipe lst night for us and it was great.  She overcooked her roast a bit so the meat was dry...however, we sliced it and poured the sauce all over it and let it sit...wow!  I'll do it again but be sure to pull the roast out at 160.

I used an oven bag also and the roast turned out very moist and flavorful. I marinatd the pork overnight.  In my opinion the currant sauce was too thin, I would have liked a thicker sauce.

I really really liked this recipe! The only thing that I didnt like was the marinade was a bit salty from the soy sauce, so I suggest using low sodium. I followed another reviewers advice and cooked the roast at 425 for 10 minutes to seal the moisture in and this roast came out PERFECT!! Very tender and juicy! I did tent it with foil when I reduced the temperature to 325. Be sure to baste the roast and add a little water to the pan if necessary since a lot of the marinade seemed to dry out in the pan.  YUM

Made this for an impromptu dinner party and it was a hit.  I didn't have time to marinate it, so I just browned it in olive oil on all sides, seasoned it with course black pepper, and continued with the rest of the recipe.  Couldn't find currant jelly w/o corn syrup (dau is allergic) so I used Thomson's TwinBerry Preserves (raspberry/blueberry) and it was still wonderful.  So simple!  Served it with green beans, steamed cauliflower, and red potatoes.

Excellent Sauce.  I enjoyed it abit cooler as well and let it cool for a while prior to serving it on the plate.  The pork was great with the marinade after sitting for 6 hours.  Fabulous dinner party meal main.

The pork was moist and tender but.....
Usually, I only use pork tenderloins but decided to give this roast recipe a try. It did make a lot but even though this marinated overnight, the flavor did not go all the way through the roast so only the edges soaked up the flavor. The sauce was O.K. but not really special. Won't be making again.

I only used the marinade portion of the recipe. Since I didn't have all the ingrediants for the sauce.  I roasted my pork roast on the grill and it was Very Tasty and Tender.  It didn't even need the sauce.

It appears that I may be the only one that absolutely did not like this recipe. I marinated the pork overnight, even pierced the meat several times to ensure more flavor. The cooking time was entirely too long. My Roast was not quite 4-lbs so cooked it for 1-hr 30 min. and it was extremely overcooked and dry with no flavor and half of the marinade burnes. As for the sauce, I'm sorry but I don't get it? It just tasted like heated jelly, should have poured the pan juices in it, would have been much better.

One of the best pork recipes I've ever tried.  I've made it with a shoulder roast and the tenderloin...both great.  I also increase the amount of sauce as it's so well liked.

This was extremely easy and delicious.  The sauce made the meal!!  We even put it on our potatoes.  I marinated it over night and served it up with Day Before Mashed Potatoes and a salad.  It was a great meal that I completely made a day ahead.

Wow! This was fantastic...made it for my family for Christmas...what a treat! So moist, cut like butter! It also looks beautiful when done. I had a 7 pound loin and didn't increase the marinade amount, it was great! My 7 pound loin was done to perfection in 3 hours. The currant sauce was also wonderful...not too sweet, with a little tang. Remember to bake it fat side up, so the juices soak through the meat. So easy and sooooo good!

Very good, did not cook as long as the recipe stated (ended up overcooked due to not checking the time).  Also per other reviewer suggestions, cooked in oven bag.

After reading the other reviews I was curious to try the sauce - it was quite good as others stated (I used red currant jelly, btw), but what was understated in my and my husband's opinion, was the marinade - made the meat fantastic!  Easy recipe and overall terrific.

This was SO good. I used a lean Pork Loin instead of an entire roast (I have a small family) and it worked perfectly. Next time will take another reviewer's advice and use low-sodium soy as it was a little on the salty side. My picky Husbund even ate this WITH the sauce, now that is a first! Thank you for the fabulous recipe. I'll be using it again this holiday season!

Delicious and tender--more tender than any other pork loin recipe I've tried. The sauce is awfully sweet, obviously, so I recommend only using a little of it. Will make again, next time for company.

My family loves this pork recipe.  Wonderful flavors and tenderness (when not over coooked).  With my oven I have to reduce the cooking time significantly, but as long as I keep an eye on the meat thermometer it turns out great.

I raided my freezer and added to the currant sauce about 2 cups of the black raspberries I harvested last summer in my woods.  Tremendously elegant.

As usual in so many on-line recipes the author knows cooking better than he/she knows how to write directions.
Examples:
In the directions
"Roast the pork with marinade uncovered at in preheated oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours....
After less than 2 hours the marinade roasted with the meat at 325 degrees was totally dried up. Basting was not possible.
In the ingredents 
What kind of currant jelly, red currents or black?

I've been making his recipe for Christmas for many years, then I lost the recipe.  I was so excited I found this on Allrecipes. Almost a perfect match.

Luxury meal that is budget friendly.  I was trying to find a pork loin recipe that allowed me to use up some dry sherry from a recent family event and this was a winner. I used drinking sherry, blackberry currant jelly [I had just a bit in a jar in my fridge], a tbsp of herb mustard instead of mustard powder, and some sauted onions and garlic.  I also seared the pork loin first in the pan before roasting it. This was very very good and restaurant quality. Yum.
