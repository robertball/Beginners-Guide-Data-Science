The evolution continues...I made the suggested changes from a reviewer  in the original(full fat) recipe[listed as "Most Helpful Review"] and then halved the whole thing. I also used a 1.6 oz package of sugar free vanilla pudding in place of the regular and they were unbelievably good! However, as another reviewer remarked, chewy softness was lost a bit with the applesauce. So, along with the applesauce I added 1/3 c ripe, room temperature avocado. This added back some fat--but the heart healthy mono/poly-unsaturated kind--which achieved that rich, melt-all-your-cares-away softens. My family had no idea--even my 7 and 4 yr old sons said they were the best cookies I'd ever made;)

Pros:  very nice flavor, the applesauce is a subtle, yet pleasant flavor addition.
Cons: texture is light and spongy, not soft and chewy or crisp and crunchy.  Kind of like a really heavy cupcake.
I appreciate the effort to make a healthier cookie, but I would rather relish one really good higher fat cookie than eat two of these low fat ones.

I raised the temperature to 375 because at 350, the middle wasn't getting quite done.  They were golden brown and done perfectly!  I live in high altitude, so that might've been the issue!

I suggest using a little less flour.

These were pretty good! I halved the recipe and left out the raisins, since no one here likes them much.  The texture is a bit more cake like, but still a little crispy around the edges.  It's nice not adding as much butter and swapping in applesauce to save some calories!
