Wonderful salad that tasted just like a "baked potato" with all the fixin's! I used red skinned poatoes and left the skins on and since to type of onion was specified I used green onion as it's mild in flavor and pairs well with baked potatoes. I used Hellman's light mayo cutting it with a bit of sour cream and like others I chose to used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta. I mixed in some of the bacon and left some to use on top. I left out the green olives and chose to use chopped fresh chives on top instead along with the rest of the bacon - YUM!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, shredded cheddar, and omitted the olives.  I can hardly wait to serve it again!  I think I might try it with the olives next time, just to see how it is.  This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Sooooooooo delicious! My family went nuts over this. Because my kids don't care for olives, I left them out and because I don't care for processed cheese, I used shredded Vermont cheddar instead. Great make ahead side dish for company!

I make this all the time for family gatherings and there is none left to take home.  I get the cheese from the deli and have them slice it thick.  I also omit the olives and double the bacon.  I mix half of the bacon in the salad and cover the top with the other half.

Absolutely delicious.  I have made this exactly as the recipe stated and have also made a "mashed" version omitting the olives.  I then serve it with eggs for breakfast.  Great for camping.  I made this for a potluck and literally had to give the recipe to 8 people!  A great hit.   Hint:  Use Best Foods Mayo for the best taste or use grated cheddar cheese.  Yummy.

The chunks of Velveeta in this recipe make for some nasty bites, so if I make this again I'll use shredded cheddar instead. I think it would be pretty tasty that way. I also omitted the olives.

I loved this recipe.  I used shredded cheddar and omitted the olives.  This tasted just like the twice baked potatoes I make that takes 4hrs or more.

This recipe needs some work. First, the velveeta didn't melt very well. Next time I'll use cheddar. Second, the green olives don't mix (and I love green olives). Also, there was not enough dressing. Next time I'll use some sour cream as well. I'd like to try this again but I'll remake the recipe with my changes.

I used low fat velvetta, low fat hellmans and low fat bacon.  This recipe was still very good and I got lots of good comments.

I made this recipe w/o the olives and it was great. The only thing I forgot to do was spray the pan with Pam and it stuck to the bottom (oops!). This recipe is delicious.

Wow! Made 2 trays of this for my son's 16th b-day party, and it was nowhere near enough. Awesome recipe!!! Used shredded cheddar, added about 1/4 cup of sour cream and replaced the olives with chopped green onions. Thanks for the recipe and all the tips. This one's a keeper.

I did make a few tweaks to this recipe. I made a mistake early on and actually mixed the bacon into the whole potato, mayo and cheddar mixture, rather than following the recipe's putting the back on the top of the dish.  I did end up putting extra bacon in overall, and did not feel it was overwhelming.  I would recommend adding extra bacon to the recipe - more like 2/3 lb instead of 1/2 lb.  I would also recommend nmixing 3/4 of the crumbled bacon into the potato mix, then putting the remaining 1/4 on the top before it bakes.  I also tried making an alternate one with ranch dressing added to it, and it only made the dish taste a bit sweeter.  Would definitely not add the ranch dressing again.  Overall, a great dish, all enjoyed.

This has been a huge family favorite for 25+ years.  My own cooking tips: use 4# red potatoes and leave some of the skin on; use a regular round casserole dish to prevent drying out; Velveeta cheese is best for smooth blending and the correct amount of moisture; bacon should not be sugar cured, hickory smoked is good; mix the olives in with the other ingredients; use slightly less bacon (6 slices), chop, and bake from raw on top until brown and crispy, using broiler if necessary; give a stir immediately after removing from oven to blend ingredients.

This recipe was so yummy w/a few changes.  I cut the recipe in half and used, turkey bacon instead of reg. bacon, used 1/4 sour cream & 1/4 of mayo, and used coupld handfulls of shredded cheese instead of the yucky block cheese, and I didn't use the green olives.  It turned out DELISH! Next time I'm going to use green onions instead of a reg onion.

I got a couple compliments on this recipe, but I didn't think it was anything spectacular.  I really don't like mayo, so I used the 1/2 mayo-1/2 sour cream as others suggested.  This mostly just seemed greasy and was lacking flavor.  With a few modifications it might be more my taste.  I also used fresh chives instead of the green olives.

With a few modifications this recipe was INCREDIBLE!
I chose to cube the potatoes and cook them almost completely before baking to reduce baking time. I used 3/4 sour cream and 1/4 mayo, and I added just a bit of steak spice to the dressing mix. Also, I added green onion instead of olives for color. Real cheese is a much nicer touch as well.
Scrumptious!

I've had to share this recipe with many people.  Family requests this a lot at gatherings.  Original recipe is time consuming.  The prep time is more than 15 min.  I've cut corners using Bacon Pieces (buy in a jar) and I use a pressure cooker to cook the peeled, diced potatoes in 5 minutes.  Although better with them, I have left out the onion and olives if I didn't have them on hand, and it's still good.

I love this recipe.  I had first tried it when I found it in The Three Rivers Cookbook in Pittsburgh over 10 years ago.  It is truly a great side dish.

PLEASE don't leave out the green olives!!!  I felt leary about putting them in, but as my kids love them, I left them in.  They really don't taste "olive-y"... they just kind of add a saltiness to the dish.  Everyone I make this for raves... even the non-olive afficianados!

I just used shredded cheddar since thats all I had on hand. I will say that it turned out a bit greasy from the cheddar cheese though. I omitted the olives since no one here would eat them. The recipe was good and I would make again.

We liked this but the second time we made some changes.  Rather than 1 cup of may we mixed 1/2 cup mayo with 1/2 cup sour cream.  We added in 1/2 tsp dill weed, 1/4 cup yellow mustard with dill, and 4 or so Tablespoons of milk. Also, the processed cheese wasn't appealing so I used a mixture of shredded cheddar, Havarti with dill, and Swiss.  With our changes this has become a favorite.

5 Stars with my additions-I used red potatoes which I cubed before boiling in salted water for about 10 min. I subbed non-fat yogurt for the mayo, and also added about a cup of low fat sour cream.  I mixed one packet of ranch dressing mix into the yogurt/sour cream with about half the green onion and a cup of shredded sharp cheddar, tossed this mixture with the warm potatoes.  After turning the coated potatoes into the baking dish I sprinkled another cup of shredded cheddar over the top, the rest of the onions and homemade bacon bits. Skipped the olives-personal preference.  Terrific dish!

These potatoes were so delish!! I am craving them again right now.  I served them hot as a side to sloppy joes. I used half mayo and half sour cream. And cut out the olives. They were superb.

I made the recipe for 4 and left half the skins on the potatoes and removed the rest, I also used shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese.  The mayo made it a little greasy but it crisped the potatoes on the outside great.  It was very tasty but I may try half sour cream and half mayo like someone suggested.  Simple painless recipe that I'm already planning meals around.  Went great with ham!

This is a wonderful new version to an the old staple of potato salad. Try roasting the potatoes. Leave Skins on, cut into bite size cubes, cover with pam butter spray and roast in the oven (400 deg) for about 30 min. Let potatoes come to room temp, then use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo. I use 'Real Bacon Pieces' in the jar to make it easier and they are great. Also I use the shredded cheddar/montery jack. Delicious.

I made this recipe and my family loved it. They kept asking me where I got it. The only thing I changed was adding black olives instead of green since my fiance isn't a fan of the green ones. Other than that it was perfect. Very very delicious.

This was great! I left out the olives and used American cheese singles - that way, I had the flavor the recipe intended, but was able to make it into much smaller pieces.

Absolutely a keeper!! Have made twice now.  Only difference I made was to use a 5lb bag of baby red potatoes which I baked then left the skins on...as much for color as for extra texture.  Also used shredded cheddar instead of american.  And omitted the olives.  The boys loved it!! Hard to please 14, 9 and 5 yr boys.  But they all came back for seconds!!

This got great reviews from the family at Easter dinner. I wanted something different than mashed potatoes and I definitely found it! I used cubes of mozzarella cheese (hubby doesn't like cheddar or american), ranch dressing instead of mayo, and 9 good-sized potatoes. This was more than enough to feed 12 people.  I will definitely make this again, even for everyday meals. It would probably even be good served cold.

Wonderful recipe. I used 1/2 shredded cheddar and 1/2 shredded velvetta and some garlic powder. Also, I used 3/4 sour cream and 1/4 mayo as others have suggested. Goes great with BBQ.

Loved this recipe!  My husband thought it was a bit "rich", but I felt it was an excellent dish for company!  Four stars because I felt that adding the bacon and THEN baking caused the bacon to get overdone.  Best to top with the bacon 15 minutes before done baking.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

My mom has made this for me since I was a kid. I don't put olives in the recipe and I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonaise. My friend makes this recipe also and she leaves the skin on the cubed potatos.  It is good that way as well.

I really liked this dish! The combination of flavors are unique and I thought it turned out well. Other than opting for cheddar, as opposed to Velveeta, I made no changes.

Very yummy - didn't use olives. Make sure your potatoes are boiled nearly completely with no hard spots or you will take the hard potato in the dish. Happened to me, but for 90% of the rest of the dish, it was so delicious! I also used bacon flakes (still real bacon) throughout the dish. I would have loved sour cream too but I didn't have any.

This was ok, there was a weird sweet taste..... I don't think I would make this again. I didn't use the processed cheese just shredded and didn't use green olives.... I can see where this would be good, but I think I would rather have roasted potatoes and cold potato salad.

Very good.  I used old cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese and I added some sour cream.  I did not rate it 5 stars as the green olives seemed a lttle out of place, next time I will leave them out.

I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Also added green onion in addition to the regular onion and black olives instead of green.  My kids absolutely loved the potatoes but my husband and I just thought it was okay.  I'm not a big fan of Velveeta so maybe that is why we didn't love this recipe.  If I try this again, I will use regular cheddar cheese.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I did make a few alterations, based on the reviews. First, I used sour cream instead of mayo.  Also, I, too added the bacon into the potato mixture and let the bacon flavor meld into the overall taste.  Great recipe!

You have to try this recipe - it is one of the best ever potato recipese on this site.  You will be asked for the recipe, my family loves it, my bunco group asks for it when it's my turn to host!  I do a 50/50 mayo/sour cream and use green onion.  Delicious enough to impress the family for a potluck or to dress up a hot dog or hamburger dinner as a yummy side dish.  Try it - you'll love it!

This was a hit with the bf, although halfway through eating it he asked me how much bacon I put in it.  That was completely my fault because I didn't even look at the amount of bacon or where it was supposed to go and just dumped a bunch in.  I don't like peeling my potatoes (part laziness, part wanting to keep them nutritious), and it worked fine.  I used 7 smaller red potatoes and halved the rest of the ingredients (well, except the bacon) and it worked fine.  I was okay with the mayo (surprisingly since I don't like mayo much) and I used cheddar instead of velveeta.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome is the best way to describe this recipe. Took it to a BBQ yesterday and it was gone in no time.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I also added 1/2cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ranch dressing.  It was xtra creamy!!!!

Sooooo rich and yummy! I added about a cup of sour cream for creaminess and used casserole shredded cheese (found it at the groc...the only cheese w/ american I could find!). Loved it with steaks on the grill and sauteed veggies.

I made this for a church pot luck and by the time I got up to the spot on the table where these were, they were gone!  I'm giving this a 4 based on that, and seeing as I didn't get to try it I have no idea how these tasted!  It is a bit time consuming to make, but aparently the effort was worth it!

I used bacon bits instead of real bacon because I had it on hand.  I tossed bits in with the mix before baking.  I also used sliced american cheese-no difference.  I crushed potato chips and scattered on top of salad before baking.  We enjoyed this recipe.
