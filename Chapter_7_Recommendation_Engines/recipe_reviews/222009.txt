These were so good! I made them with and without refried beans added and made my own salsa. For my cheddar I used applewood smoked cheddar inside and on top, and the flavor it added was amazing. I highly recommend using a smoked cheese with it. After baking I broiled the enchiladas for a couple of minutes to lightly brown the top. So yummy, and very easy to prep. Served with spanish rice and paired it with "A big honkin' margarita" from this site. great mexican dinner night!! Can't wait to make these again. Thanks bean machine!

I used medium salsa and sharp Cheddar; the recipe did not specify which.  otherwise made as directed.   This did not go over well for us, not sure exactly what is needed;  maybe some chopped peppers.   Thanks for sharing.

I changed things a little to fit what I had on hand. I only had white onion and had some echilada sauce that needed used up, so I mixed that with the salsa and topped the enchiladas with it. I had the burrito sized tortillas that were jalapeno flavored (the green looked kind of gross, but tasted good. I topped mine with cucumber salsa.

My family absolutely loves this.  I have to make it at least once a month!  Friends show up when they know I'm making it.  I use corn tortillas instead and pour enchilada sauce on top instead of more salsa.  Great flavor!!!

These wee pretty good! I used the enchilada sauce I had on hand instead of the salsa, and used minced red onions as well as the green. But everyone was happy with them.

I made this for me and my wife but I cut the recipe in half. They were delicious but unlike enchiladas you get at a Mexican restaurant the topping was a little dry. I'm not sure if that was because there wasn't enough cheese on top but next time
I will put more salsa and cheese on the top.

You can't really go wrong here... Mine were crammed in as I didn't have 8" tortillas on hand-- only the larger and no onions! Ugh. Haha. But it still turned out great. The only changes I made: with the cheese mixture I added some onion powder, onion and herb blend, and red pepper flakes.) A dash cayenne or chili powder wouldn't hurt depending on your tastes... Yum!

My husband loves cheese enchiladas, this recipe was very easy and tasty. I scaled to 20 servings as I had 20 tortillas to use. I omitted the green onions and made enchilada sauce for the top instead of using salsa. I used nacho cheese blend for the shredded cheese instead of each individual type. Needed more than 20 minutes to melt the cheese properly, more like 30 minutes would be better.

We liked this quite a bit, but my teenage son loved it. Next time we make it we will add some refried beans in the enchiladas, and I did use Mrs. Espy’s enchilada sauce (modified) rather than the salsa on top. Adding this meal to our ongoing idea list.

Used the three cheese filling combination, but used homemade red enchilada sauce instead of the salsa stated here.  Delicious and easy to prepare.

These were just OK. I won't make again. Looking for a different recipe. Not a lot of flavor and didn't love the cream cheese in these.

Not for us.  I cut the onion in half—still too much.  Hopefully, the disappointing outcome was the result of user error.

Great recipe! I made it mostly as stated, only changing one thing. Instead of pouring salsa over the rolled tortillas at the end, I used the small bit of filling I had left and mixed it with half a can of enchilada sauce and used that instead. So creamy and yummy! Came together in a snap too, easy prep and easy clean up. Thanks!

I made this as a college student trying to make a simple meal, and this is so good! I used more cheese on top of the enchiladas than called for but the cream cheese on the inside is delicious! Will make again!

These turned out so good!!! They’re so simple and inexpensive. My husband loved them! I didn’t add the green onions because I didn’t have any but you could definitely add whatever toppings you wanted they turned out great!

Wow!!!  I made these almost as per the recipe (traded out green onions for regular onions) and I used corn tortillas.  I'm confident the original recipe is amazing.  The filling is rich and creamy.  My husband loves cheese enchiladas and these did not disappoint!  My finicky cheese-hating son devoured two enchiladas!  This recipe is a keeper!  The salsa is a great touch and a nice change from enchilada sauce.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

I filled the recipe but added a little spin for my own preference. I added grilled Mexican sweet corn and fresh green onions on top. Delicious!

These came out pretty good. I used sautéed diced white onion instead of the green onion. I also added diced roasted red peppers to the cheese mixture.  Thanks for the recipe:)

This dish was a hit with our guests, I used home made pico de gallo and red enchilada sauce over the enchiladas instead of the salsa.
