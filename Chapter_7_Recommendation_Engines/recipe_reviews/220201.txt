I too thought this was a little bland but I served it with a leafy green salad and a lemon vinaigrette that helped turn up the flavor. Also added some olive oil, sliced the veggies thin and put them all under the fish. Not bad with a few adjustments.

I found this to be quite bland. It is worth making, though, it just needs onion or garlic or something to make it tastier. The veggies need to be cut extremely thin for them to cook as quickly as the fish does. I followed the directions exactly, worried that maybe there was some reason the zucchini wasn't seasoned and the veggies were separated. But as far as I could tell, the flavors all merged and coking wasn't affected by being separated, so now I think it is silly to have the zucchini and carrots separated. Put the zucchini in the seasoning along with the carrots, put veggies on parchment paper, top with fish, fold and bake.

Very simple to make.  I didn't have any carrots so I just combined the succhini, lemon, dill and fish in a foil packet.  Tiny bit bland so it needs a tasty side dish to go with it.
