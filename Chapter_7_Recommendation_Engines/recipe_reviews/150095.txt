This was just OK.  Kids, ages 7 and 1, enjoyed it.  My mango was not that ripe, so I'm not sure if that makes a difference.  I couldn't even taste the mango.  Just seemed kind of plain to me--no spices other than s&p--and some of the spaghetti noodles got crispy dry in the oven, so you may want to cover for the first portion of the baking process.  Since it was just tomato puree mixed in, it almost seemed like I was tossing it with ketchup.  I will post a photo shortly.

I thought it was pretty good:\ But I hate mango so I left it out.

My husband hates leftovers... Just cooked this and he wants to have it again, leftover!  I did adapt slightly, because I read it, wanted it, and didn't want to go to the store for real ingredients.  substituted 4 chopped carrots for mango, added 3 cloves garlic, added a bit of mozzarella, and used crushed tomatoes instead of puree.  It was super!
