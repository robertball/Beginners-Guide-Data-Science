I love this recipe!  This is one of the few things I look forward to making and eating (sad, isn't it?).  I use bulk mild sausage from the butcher down the street, and (like most sausage) it's a little greasy.  That said, I find the olive oil is just to make sure the peppers don't stick and not for flavor - so, for me, it's optional given the sausage grease.

These "Sausage-Stuffed Cherry Pepper Poppers" were excellent!  I served them beside a tossed salad for a "fast and easy" meal! I will definitely be making these again. So yummy! Thank you Chef John for sharing your recipe.

These were a HUGE hit at a party I brought them to! I followed the recipe as-is with the exception of using bulk, not linked, sausage and I added some Parmesan and garlic powder. So quick and easy, but packs a lot of flavor!

While this was good, it didn't trip my trigger. I would consider making it again though.

I could only find the peppers with seeds & had to prep the peppers first.  I will look earlier next time for the seeded peppers.  I added mozzarella cheese to the sausage mixture & they went quickly at Christmas.  Very tasty!

So simple and easy to make.  They are completely addicting as well!   Sometimes, as soon as I remove from the oven, I sprinkle them with shredded Parmesan cheese.   
They disappear fast, so make alot!

Have been growing these peppers and making this recipe for years. They are available as seeds on ebay in either hot or mild varieties. We also put some smoked gouda in them before baking 30 minutes @350 degrees

Very good but very spicy - and my husband and I can handle a lot of spice but these were a bit much!  I would recommend taking the seeds out of the cherry peppers both to tone down the spice and to avoid unpleasant crunching on a ton of seeds while you're eating these!

This was so simple to make .  Perfect for an after work potluck.  I thought I would have a few leftovers but they were gobbled up quickly.  Made exactly as is. No changes.

Who would have known? Ok...Chef John. These are great. The flavors were all there. I made 1/2 the recipie because I wanted to try it. They were the only appetizer that went. And they were soooo easy. I made them the day before and popped into the oven before guest arrived. I found yellow peppers that weren't as squashed as the red so I used them. I also bought spicy Italian sausage. Sure it would have worked with mild.

Probably would have been great but I got the wrong peppers.  Could only find hot cherry peppers and got bug eyed looks from everyone who tried them at our party.  Oops.

I did not care for these at all.  The peppers have almost a sour taste when paired with the sausage. They also left a terrible aftertaste.  Will not be making these again.

I really tried to like this receipe.  I used hot italian sausage, regular italian sausage and merguez sausage and didn't like any of them.  The peppers are great and I've used them in other dishes.  I disliked the sausage and my family said they were just ok.
