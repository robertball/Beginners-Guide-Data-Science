Made this last night.  Sort of bland in and of itself, but once I added fresh mushrooms and some Parmesano Regiano cheese to the sauce - it was pretty good.  Giving 3* on the original recipe.

My sauce came out a little thick, will cut back on the flour next time. Other than that it was great! My sick husband and I loved it! I will be making this again.

I hate fish, my fiance; however won't eat meat that breaths air.  I figured I'd take a crack at making this for her and that was a mistake because she wants me to make it all the time now.

the key to this sauce is the wine. I used a sweet wine with a slight fruity taste, nothing strong. The wine made the difference.  I have never done anything like this and first time cooking salmon.  Guests loved the sauce so much they ate it with a spoon.

I made this with a 4oz tilapia and halved the sauce (with some dill), and tossed it with some whole wheat pasta. It was so good! I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box!

Not a big salmon eater but I truly enjoyed this.  Had salmon we caught in Alaska shipped home and tried several recipes.  This was my favorite.  The salmon was delicious and so quick and easy to cook.

Made this tonight with a bottle of Mirassou Chardonnay. 
The sauce took about twice as long to really thicken, but came out beautifully with a delightful tang. I served the salmon with potatoes and mushrooms and drizzled the extra sauce over the whole meal. Will definitely be making this again in the future.

I will have to agree with another reviewer.... don't know where I went wrong... but this was not good. Another reviewer stated they used a sweet white wine... if I decide to try this again maybe that's what I will change because mine was extremely bitter.

I followed instructions to a tee, but I think I used a little more wine than I should have, and added a little too much salt. Not as yellow as I would have liked . I think the butter got more brown than I wanted  but it was good will be better next time.  Also used it on potato crusted trout. Decent sauce. I need to tweak it for me.

I can't think where I went so wrong with this recipe.  The sauce turned out terribly for me.  I tried to fix it... with cream, then lemon, then dill. There was far too much wine, it was so bitter. I must be missing something here?
