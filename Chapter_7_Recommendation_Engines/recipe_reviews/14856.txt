This recipe is very good, but doesn't travel so well.  If you are taking it to a dinner, you may want to prepare everything ahead but add bread crumbs and bake at your destination.  Otherwise, the dish can come out a little dry if left to sit.  The bread crumbs can absorb much of the moisture; however, the flavor is great! I will be making this again.

My Italian mother and I loved it -- my Irish husband did not. The prosciutto and
swiss are strong flavors to blend together. Also, blanch the asparagus well if you
don't like it crisp (it doesn't cook much in the oven). We had it for a second course,
but it would work as an appetizer on its own. Not as a side dish, though.

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time out, as I did here. I received several compliments for the dish, but had plenty left over. Next time, I think I'll just blanch the asparagus and then let it do its cooking in the oven, wrapped in bacon instead of proscuitti and  maybe using boursin instead of the swiss cheese. It really needs to be kicked up a notch. I think I'll leave off the bread crumbs too ... as they didn't add anything.

I think this is a great side dish to serve with a simple main course like a beef tenderloin or grilled pork chops.  The first time I made this I had extra prosciutto so I used two slices per bundle.  Way too salty.  The second time I followed the recipe exactly except to cut down on the parmesan and it way great.

Very good.  I used sliced ham and steamed the asparagus instead of boiling.  Also used a half-slice of cheese but next time will use the whole slice.  Not sure about the proportions...I thought the crumbs were maybe a bit too heavy (one-fourth cup per serving).  And if you use 3-4 pencil-thin spears of asparagus, for a total of 12-16, not sure that would be a full pound.  But whatever, the recipe is easy and looks impressive and tastes very good.

Since I do not eat beef/pork I make Asparagus Rolantina by substituting ham with smoked turkey slices I buy in Costco.  This attractive dish makes a wonderful impression on everyone to whom I serve it.  It is easy, nutritious and attractive.

My husband gave this 5 stars.  He kept stating that it was "awesome asparagus".  He loves asparagus, but felt this was extra good.  I found it to be good, but very rich.  As usual, I altered the recipe slightly.  I used much less melted butter and didn't have prosciutto available to me locally.  I substitued smoked turkey.  I served this as a main dish with a tossed salad and crusty bread.  It was a simple dinner for just my husband and I.  By reducing the butter and using smoked turkey, I cut the fat of the recipe.  This was a plus for us, as we are trying to lighten up our meals.

I made this with muenster cheese, turkey pastami, less butter, crumbs and parmesan cheese.  Was excellent!  Then tried it again with balsamic vinegar as someone suggested... did not care for this near as much.

four star due to me being a 2 star cook. I def left the asparagus in the oven too long and totally agree with alot of the other rating when they say go easy on the bread crumbs if you use any at all. Other than that it make a pretty nice presentation.

Very good side dish, everyone enjoyed it.  I would love to try it with provolone.  It needs just a tiny bit more flavor.

This was a great recipe using only the asparagus spears, prosciutto and a scant handful of grated cheese, easier and less fat.

I served it at a fancy dinner party and it was a hit. i would boil it longer though, the pre-boil and bake time weren't enough, it was too crunchy (for me).

This is surprisingly very good.  I used 1/2# of swiss (6 slices), pre-sliced & packaged deli ham 3/4# (12 slices)& about 1 1/2# of asparagus(steamed).  No toothpicks just seam side down & worked fine.  Make sure the asparagus is cooked to your desired doneness before rolling. Doesn't really cook very much in oven.  Avoid the temptation(I didn't)to add more butter, you won't need it.  Cooked full 20 minutes, let rest 5. Another surprise was that I didn't think it wasn't too salty but my wife did.  Don't forget to add pepper.  It really added something when leftovers were reheated next day.

My family loved this dish!  It is quite salty, so I modified it by using unsalted butter and lower sodium ham instead of the prosciutto.  By the time dinner ended, there was none left!

Excellent and pretty starter, but great as a light main meal with a few extra veg and potatoes and if you're cutting down on the meat. Varying the cheese also works - a medium cheddar for example.  I've tried using bundles of baby carrots too - they need to be blanched first otherwise they'll be too raw.

This is a wonderful recipe - all the ingredients work well together.  I too boiled the asparagus much longer and they were perfect.  My only complaint is that too much of the cheese oozed out while they were baking - I'm going to work on fixing that.  The presenation is beautiful and I would recommend it for dinner parties - I cut them in half so that all the differnt layers show!

Fabulous! Although I do admit I changed it a bit. I didn't have any ham so I made only with the swiss. I also cut way down on the breadcrumbs because we watch our carbs (I just sprinkled some crumbs on top). Otherwise, I followed the recipe. This was so good! I will make again with prosciutto or thin deli ham...Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful!!!  A big hit!  I used ham instead of prosciutto and I had to add a little more butter than called for.  I also followed someones recommendation and boiled the asparagus a little longer.  My spears were pencil thin but I think I could have boiled even a little bit longer.  Regardless....it was awesome.  I will definitly make this again!!!

Excellent recipe-- easy, but looks impressive.  I'd cut down a little on the parmesan next time to make it less salty.

I absolutely LOVe these! I have made them often. You do have to watch carefully so the cheese doesn't start to ooze out and make a messy melted mess on your cookie cheet. But they are so easy and quite delicious.

This recipe gets a 'wow' from my fam every time. I only wrap 3 or 4 spears per roll and use a small piece of Swiss on the inside. Delic!

This was enjoyed by all! I didn't pre-cook the asparagus because I like asparagus still crisp. I also skipped the breadcrumbs. Baked for about 20 min. and it was fantastic! Next time I might replace the swiss with a sharp provolone. I'll definately be making this again...especially for guests as it is almost as beautiful to look at as it is to eat!

I expected more out of this.  The proscuitto and cheese overpowered the asparagus in my opinion.  I love asparagus, but this recipe made me want to take the asparagus out and just eat the meat and cheese.  Too rich of flavors to be paired with a mild veggie.  Fun making it, but I will not make this again.

YUMMY!  Didn't bother to preboil the asparagas (didn't need it).  Didn't have Swiss so I used provolone cheese (1/2 slice in each "bundle").  Didn't need toothpicks - they stayed together wonderfully.  Also added a layer of fresh sliced mushrooms over the "bundles" before pouring the butter over this dish.  This dish looks beautiful and tastes wonderful!

What a great way to cook asparagus!  I didn't use as butter and I chose to use a parmesan bread crumb instead of italian seasoned.  This was yummy!

This recipe was good.  My husband was a big fan of it.  We kept close to the recipe but used provolone instead of swiss cheese.  We also made our own breadcrumbs and I used veggie 'meat' slices.  I only thought that the asparagus was not quite cooked to my liking so in the future I might roast them lightly before wrapping them in the cheese.

I made this for Easter Dinner yesterday. It was a hit w/the whole family. I think I would cut down on the Italian bread crumbs and use only one cup. I will keep this recipe on file and will make again and again. 5 stars.

Beautiful presentation BUT it was too, too salty. I don't know how to get around this either. Used proscuitto and bundled together four asparagus spears. Neat look when you cut through. Found the asparagus easy to put together. Will probably make again but need to do something about the salt.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes...I used bacon instead of proscuitto (b/c it's cheaper), I used provolone in place of Swiss, and I used a balsamic vinegarette instead of melted butter.  Got requests for this recipe!

I served this for a family dinner, and got rave reviews - didnt change the recipe much, except that i used fresh grated parmesean cheese (everything is better when it's fresh.)  We all love crisp vegetables, so this was great - I can see how someone who doesnt like their veggies mushy might want them cook longer - but this was perfect for us.  I found out that my aunt made it for a dinner party the week after I made it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this.....but hubby did not...so I cant give this 5 stars. Blanched the asparagus first and then made the bundles. I thought the flavors of the procuitto, swiss, bread crumbs, and parm were great. Thanks for a different twist on asparagus!

This was really good.  I used thin sliced deli lite ham instead and I used shredded swiss since that's what I had in the fridge.  I think prosciutto would have been over the top salty, and I'm a salt lover.  Anyway, the lite ham cuts the calories, and it tastes great.  My husband stole the leftovers this morning for a nice lunch!

Great recipe!  My sister-in-law does a great variation as an appetizer.  Rolls one or two cooked stalks in the proscuitto and cheese and  a splash of mustard - and serves as is - no further baking!

I love fresh asparagus, so naturally I loved this recipe. However, I will use no more than 1/2cup bread crumb topping next time because I seemed to have way too much breading.

YUM YUM YUM!!!  I'll cut down on the amount of bread crumbs next time, maybe 1/2 C at best.  This recipe was very delic, especially with early spring asparagus!  :)  Thanks!

These tasted really good but the cheese and breadcrumbs didn't stick very well.
But I'll definitely try it again!

I wanted to make something different to go with Easter dinner.  I put this together really quick the morning of and brought it to where we were having dinner.  We baked it there and everybody loved it.  It also makes a really nice presentation.

I didn't like the Italian breadcrumbs with this, so I made it again using Panko (unseasoned) breadcrumbs with a little garlic powder mixed in.  I liked it much better.  Great idea though!

Well received elegant side dish to the Christmas rib roast. Prepared earlier then baked while roast was resting( I have one oven). My asparagus was small so I used 5-6 spears per bundle. Also I used 2 slices a very thinly sliced Swiss to cover each piece of proscuitto before rolling. If using frozen asparagus, don’t use the microwave! It’s too easy to over cook the asparagus even when reducing the time. That was my mistake.

The only thing I did different to this receipe was sliced a piece of Parmesan cheese and rolled that up inside with the ham and Swiss cheese.   Everyone loved it!

Love this recipe - it's super easy to make, and definitely dresses up dinner. It's also about the only way I can get my veggie-phobic husband to eat asparagus :)

I have now made this recipe a few times for guests and everyone raves about it and want the recipe ASAP. We love crunchy asparagus so the bake time is perfect. I have used shredded Swiss cheese as well and it works too.
