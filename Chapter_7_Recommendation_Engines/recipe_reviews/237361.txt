Here is my version of perfect quark.  I use Costco's Plain Greek Yoghurt 32 oz size and drain it on cheese cloth for about 12 hours.  It comes out perfect to use in recipes and looks and tastes like Quark.

Itoo lived in Austria and have recipes.  I always use Magerquark (topen) and found a similar recipe.  It works with whole milk, 2%, 1%, and even skimmed milk.  Difference is quantity when finished.  My recipe suggests heating the milk to 185 (160 at 5000 ft, where I live.  Pour into glass, plastic, or stainless steel bowl.  Cool to 110 and stir in buttermilk aout 12 hours.  I strain through large coffee strainers.  Will have weigh which is great for baking bread, pancakes and I even use in green drinks.  But cuts down on the fats in the finished product.  The recipe as written here makes great creme fraisch.

I have lived in Germany for many years and have lots of recipes that require Quark! I never know what to use when in the US....thanks for helping everyone who wants to cook real German food....BTW quark is served with cooked potatoes, or cheese cake, served with puree fruit....the list is enless.

I was skeptical at first that this would actually separate to make cheese, but i followed the instructions exactly and it turned out wonderfully!, great texture and a lovely soft mild cheese, and so easy to do! Thanks
