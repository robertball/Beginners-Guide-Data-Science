Wow! This was great! Very moist and flavorful. I topped it with whipped cream although I am not certain it was necessary to do so. We all had seconds.

I had never made a 'pudding cake' before so it kind of freaked me out to pour the water/melted butter mixture over my batter but the results were awesome!  This is so moist and delicious and flavorful! We served it warm with French Vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.

Delicious.  Makes the house smell wonderful when it is baking.  Best served warm or cold.  Taste and texture NOT best served right out of oven.  I served it with vanilla bean ice cream.  My family loved it.

This was really yummy! When you are making any pudding cake....you are always unsure how it will come out because of the way it looks with the water on top but it came out perfect. We are having it tonight for desert topped with whip cream. I can hardly wait!

Very nice recipe. You get full-bodied  gingerbread flavor, in an airy yet moist cake. The top is slightly chewy; the bottom is fabulous and ooey-gooey. I used dark molasses, because I prefer a strong flavor -- unfortunately, when I measured it out, there was only about 1/2 cup left in the jar ... so I just rinsed it out and added 1/4 cup of molasses-water to the mix. Still worked well!

I'll never make plain gingerbread again. My husband, who is not a gingerbread fan, loved this. I served it with a little whipped cream. Easy and delicious!

So good.  Made it for my Mom's 81st birthday, as gingerbread is her fav. I cooked the minimum time, but would like to have had more sauce.  Will try incresing the water next time.

Very nice dessert.  I used the dark molasses as well.  I think I will add more water next time as I would like a bit more sauce.

I was concerned that this cake would be soggy, but it is delicious.  The top was a little too hard for my taste, but it you are eating it with ice cream or whipped cream it solves that problem.  Very delicious.   I'll make it again.

Delicious, moist cake. A little too "molasses-y" for my taste, but cooked up beautifully and tasted great. I might cut back on molasses next time. Definitely going to make again!

I'm probably a freak for making this in the summer but I had a huge sweet-tooth ginger craving and making gingersnaps was just too daunting. This is a delicious and easy recipe that hit the spot. I didn't change a thing; I only halved the recipe (but still used 1 egg) and it turned out great. Yummy the next day out of the fridge too. Yay!

Wonderful!  Made it for a Christmas dinner, and it was a hit.  I didn't understand what the "pudding" part meant, but you'll see!

Ooooooh this is so good!  I made this for a german-themed potluck at my church.  It turned out sooo yummy!  Although it was quite good by itself, it would also have been good with some whipped cream on it.  I wanted it to say, "I AM GINGERBREAD," so I used about 2 1/4 tsp of ginger, which was very good.  I also added 1/2 tsp of ground cloves, since they go hand-in-hand with ginger.  I recommend this dessert to all!

This is a very good--though not dense--gingerbread with a wonderful gooey bottom.  I guess the best testimonial is that every time I turn around, my husband is eating a piece of it--including after his breakfast.  If you like gingerbread, try my gingerbread pear cake on this site.  It's a winner too.

I did not care for this cake at all.  It smelled so good while baking, but it tasted so bland!  And the pudding sauce just made the cake soggy.  Yuck!
