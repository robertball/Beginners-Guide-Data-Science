I put about 1 tbs grated ginger and 2 cloves garlic in pan warm in 1 cup warm chicken broth for about 1-2 min when comes to boil add about 2tbs soy sause, add catfish cover with sliced mushrooms and diagonally cut green onions spoon broth over fish cover cook about 5 min.  FABULOUS.  SUPER EASY.  LOW CAL

This recipe is as it says: easy to prepare and hard to mess up. I used this on a Japanese bass and it turned out perfectly. I was a little more generous with the soy sauce than the recipe called for and spread the ginger throughout the fish -- inside and out. One additional tip: make 1" vertical slices along the length of the fish (both sides) to allow the flavor to really get into the fish. Definitely making this again!

Used my electric wok with the steamer rack.  Placed ingredients in a round cake pan, leaving enough room around the perimiter to allow the steam to circulate.  Makes a good amount of its own juice when cooking - delicious.  The sauce is thin like a broth, so serve with plenty of rice or noodles. I grated the ginger root instead of sliced it, used about 1T or so.  May want to add some more cabbage if there is room in the pan.  Easy clean up, healthy too!

I didn't have a steamer or cabbage so I took the suggestion to use chicken broth with grated ginger, garlic, pepper flakes, soy sauce but no add'l water.  I used more mushrooms,('cause I love 'em)but everything else the same.  Cooks fast (5 min.) and my family loved it!  Next time I would go with 2lbs. of halibut for our family of three.  Hubby and I were fighting over the last piece.  Great recipe, thanks!

Nope.  This did not work.  There are better ways to make halibut.  A lot of work for a little bit of flavor.  Nice idea but I won't make again.

I made this for myself and my father tonight and we liked it a lot! And he likes fried fish but I said we have to eat healthier. He said I could make it again anytime!

I didn't have a steamer so I baked it instead.  The red pepper flakes add a little kick.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was very easy to make. 

I would add one suggestion, and that would be after the fish and veggies are steamed and you are putting then on the plate. I added a small splash of Soy Sauce, then I added the cilantro ( a must ) but then I added a bit of lemon zest which I thought brought the overall to another level.

Overall, it was simple, quick, tasty, and will be added to the rotation.

I made this with catfish because here in the landlocked midwest it was half the price of halibut.  I LOVED this dish. The nappa cabbage and mushrooms were lovely and delicate.  This taste almost better the next day.  Make sure not to undercook fish.

Didn't have a steamer, but steamed it in a pan instead, with way more shiitake mushrooms, a little more napa, and a dash of sesame oil. Came out great, especially with a little extra simmering.

It was ok, although a little bland.  A little tweaking might be needed, bit I'll try it again.  Maybe add some green pepper and thicken the sauce for serving.

About as good as it gets. Made it for my Chinese wife and she declared it delicious. We cannot usually get halibut here but I have made it with snapper, flounder, large mouth bass, white perch/crappie and I tried it with red drum. All was good except the red drum. Too fishy tasting.

I use this on salmon. I spray the baking dish, pour the sauce on top, cover it with aluminum foil. Bake for about 20 mins at 375. Uncover, broil for 2-3 mins. I've also done this with haddock or any other fish on sale. Sooooo good!
