3.26.18  I’ve been cooking my corn on the cob for years in the microwave, but no longer.  Corn on the cob in the Instant Pot® has now become my go-to way to cook it.  I only cooked two ears, but still used 2 cups of water, it came to pressure quickly, and after two minutes, I left it on the warm mode until the rest of my dinner was  done.  It already had released its pressure naturally, and it came out perfectly crisp and tender (very forgiving).  Luv it!

I lightly coated the corn with butter and moderately sprinkled the ears with cayenne pepper.  Oh So Delicious. Give it a try!

I've been adding herbs to the water and trying out tossing the cobs with spices before steaming.

My favorite combination so far has been using a large sprig of tarragon in the water and tossing the cobs with a little salt, black pepper and poppy seeds before steaming. Seriously better than butter.

I've also used cilantro, dill and thyme in the water (all fairly weak taste, just a hint) and tossing with old bay, chipotle or garlic powder (all good stuff).

Easy. I like the 'set it & forget it', plus no heating up of the kitchen ;)

I love not having to mop up the spatter on the stove. Also I didn't have to babysit the pot and the corn turned out fine.

Like other reviewers have said, it’s effortless and very forgiving. I also used the trivet instead of a steamer basket. After the cooking time was up, the pot was on keep warm mode for a good hour until our chicken was fully cooked on the grill. The corn was perfect!! Instant Pot is the way to cook fresh corn on the cob!

This came out great if you don't want to worry about hot water, boiling on the stove! I didn't have a steamer basket, so I just used the stand that came with the Instant Pot and still arranged them as indicated.

For sure I will make this again.  I am fairly new to the instant pot but I love not having a big pot of boiling water splashing about.  I felt safer using this method.  I thought after pressing the meat/stew button that I had set it to two minutes but I think it was 2 hours.  That being said after 10 minutes I could smell the corn cooking so I did the quick release.  It turned out just fine.
