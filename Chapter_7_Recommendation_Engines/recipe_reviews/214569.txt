I love this gumbo. I prepared as stated but just put the chicken pieces in the broth and cooked. I cleaned the bones and skin after it had cooked. I used 2 types of sausage. One was an green onion smoked sausage as well as andouie sausage and 2 lbs total. I added 1 Tsp of liquid smoke flavoring and it was fabulous. I recommend this recipe! (I tend to make it spicy so put more cayenne pepper in it as well.)

Needed some tomatoes and something more to thicken it (I added more flour but it still wasn't thick enough).  Otherwise, was delicious!

worth all the steps, for SURE. Used some really spicy andouille sausage and added file powder at the end.

very good!! I didn't have any cayenne pepper though so it was a little bland for gumbo. It took a long time and constant baby sitting of the roux lol I was scared to burn it. otherwise awesome and should be easier the second time around.

I cheated and used boneless chicken breasts and premade roux (about 8oz). I was worried the breast might come out dry but they were super moist and easy to shred, I used andouille sausage (of course) and threw in a bay leaf, thyme, basil and some minced garlic when I threw in the sausage because I love SPICES!

Absolutely delicious.  The only things I did differently was use all boneless/skinless chicken thighs and omitted cutting slits into the meat prior to the marinade, and I also added a bit of okra to the last 15 minutes of cooking for some thickening.  Will definitely make this again!

Turned out amazing. We did add some jalapenos and chili powder because we're in Texas. But, other than that, nothing else was changed.

Great recipe.

I made it, added a bit more sausage (Andouille) and a half again on the liquids and veggies. I also made sure to scrape up all the chicken and sausage  scrapings left in the skillet after browning everything (deglazed with a little stock). If it had food in liquid or oil, it went in the stock pot. Never pass up the brown goodies left behind when you brown up meat, that's the gold!  I used stock in place of half of the water. I would have used all stock (never use water if you can use stock or broth) but did not have more on hand. Great flavor!

I aded a huge native Bay leaf to the base too. It only took 35 minutes to make a dark , milk-chocolate roux in a sauce pan. When I added the 1 cup of boiling water it frothed and foamed up and thickened into a glorious and dense goo and smelled divine! Fantastic! I added the saut√©ed veggies to the roux according to the recipe, but only six or seven large scoops with a tablespoon, the rest just went into the stock pot. I used five breasts, three huge ones with bone-in, two medium with no bones, and 8 or 9 drumsticks. I like dark meat and left the drumstick mean on the bone. This is a great recipe, better than the gumbo I ate with my Cajun friends, I would love to put some crab mean or crawfish in this gumbo.

I don't know what original gumbo tastes like, but 5 stars to the Dupre family! I used andouille (sp?) sausage.
