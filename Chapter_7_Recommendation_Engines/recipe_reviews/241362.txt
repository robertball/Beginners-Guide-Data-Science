I have made this 4 times now. Each time I have tried a different fish, the first time lobster, then prawns, then crab, finally smoked salmon. Every time it has been a total success. Great recipe and quite easy.

Used crab meat because it was what I had, and followed everything else exactly.  Excellent!  This was a big hit with everybody.
