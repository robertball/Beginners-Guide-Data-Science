Flavor is excellent.  I did not use 6 cups tomato sauce, and I'm glad I didn't, I think that would've been overkill that would drown out the coconut flavor.  I used a 14 oz can diced tomatoes, and half of a 14 oz can of tomato sauce.  1 tbsp of pepper paste is plenty spicy, if you like it mild, add less. I have to say that this recipe makes a large volume, I would have preferred it to be half the quantity, had too much leftover.

This recipe has excellent flavor and was delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down by at least half on the tomato and just a little bit of the coconut milk. I added extra curry and also, didn't have the red pepper paste so I substituted with some red curry powder which gave it a nice spicey flavor. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Easy and delicious!  Usually, I use tofu in Asian or vegetarian-zed American foods, I wasn't sure how Indian flavors would work with tofu but it was great.  My only confusion was the tomato sauce. I wasn't sure how many cans of tomato sauce I would need to get exactly six cups so I just used one large can.  Obviously this was a lot less than six cups, but the sauce was flavorful and had a lot of body.  Also, I substituted a pinch of chili powder because I didn't have red chile paste on hand.

I liked this recipe, but agree with previous comments such as:
1) it makes a lot!
2) Let it simmer, the longer it simmers the better it tastes
3) Use less tomatoe sauce, and more coconut milk. I think that it makes a more authintic cream sauce that way.
4) I definately added more curry powder and garlic for a zesty recipe. 

With these changes it is definately a keeper for my house! 

Reheats amazingly well!

This was really delicious, although it didn't turn out the way I had expected it to at all. It was less "keema" and more curry. For that amount of tomato sauce, I suggest at least doubling the tofu. As is, the tofu was drowning in the curry, and so its minced texture was lost. The curry, thankfully, was awesome, so not complaining. Finally, the dish had, in my opinion, a Thai-Indian hybrid flavour.

I used a combination of curry paste and curry powder instead of cumin and red pepper paste. 

This recipe also uses way too much tomato sauce. I stopped after about 3 cups of tomato sauce and found the curry to be really good as it was.

This recipe ROCKS!  I've added different veggies (runner beans, for example), which allows for variety, since I've made it frequently since the first try. I've also used powdered coconut milk, and had a positive outcome. I had it simmer for quite a long time, waiting for the hunny returning later from work than usual, and it made the  curry that much richer - which makes this meal a time-tolerant option as well. All around, this is a FANTABULOUS recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This is a fnatastic recipe!! My family loves it, and my husband really enjoys cooking it. We stick to the recipe, then let it simmer for about 30 minutes, then add more spices to taste. (Always more curry) It makes a lot but saves and reheats really well! It has become a staple in our house.

Very good!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Halved the pepper paste so it wouldn't be too spicy.  I used two cans of Hunts tomato sauce and one large can of chopped tomatoes (drained).  I ate this with Minute Rice.  This recipe makes quite a bit.

it took A LOT more seasoning to get this baby kicking, and even then i was told it wasn't enough. something was off, but i couldn't figure out what. i did hear on no reservations that when cooking indian you shouldn't use non-stick cookware, because the burning is a vital part of the flavor. i don't have nonstick, so maybe that was where this dish was lacking. a lot of time and tasting went into this - i think i will stick with going out for indian.

I make this all the time, but my recipe is a bit different measurement wise. First, do NOT use all those tomatoes! It will ruin the curry. Cut it down to about 1 and 1/2 cups of the tomatoe sauce and I like to put the tomatoes and onions in the food processor. I use about 3/4 a cup of coconut milk unsweetened. And, add flaked *unsweetened* coconut for extra flavor. ALSO, since my husband is Indian I use paneer. AWESOME if you can find it. Some Indian (Patel Bros) groceries keep it in their frozen food section. You can also find ready made naan, chapathi, and paratha that are authentic and taste homemade. But, you don`t have to do all that work. ALSO, veggies I cut down to 1 to 1 1/2 cup total.

I have this simmering on the stove right now; it smells so good and the samples are delightful!  I love the spices. I reduced the tomato sauce to 1 3/4 cup (15 oz), and it seems like plenty... I wouldn't add any more than that. I added one fresh chopped tomato, and I think cauliflower would be a nice addition.  I'll be serving this with basmati rice. Next time, I'll add the peas just before serving... they seemed over-cooked after simmering for a half hour. Also, this was fairly greasy, I will use lite coconut milk next time. A bit of cinnamon might be a nice addition. Update: Much improved with lite coconut milk - the spices are more pronounced. Also, I added the cumin, curry and ginger while the onions and tofu were frying - it made the tofu tastier. I did add a bit more red pepper paste. Love it!  This is going into regular rotation.

Made some of the same revisions as other reviewers---most important one is cutting down the tomato sauce.  I used 4 cups and could've used less.  (I like the idea of using diced tomatoes instead.)  Also, could've had a bit more tofu.  Will make this again and continue to play with it.

A vegetarian guest very well acquainted with Indian food gave this an 8 or 9 out of 10 (10 being the best Indian food he's ever had). That said, here are my modifications: 2 Tblspn cumin, 2 tsp curry, 2 tsp ginger, 2 tsp salt, 1/4 red cayenne pepper, one large can diced petite tomatoes, two heaping spoons of tomato sauce; served with brown rice on the side. I've never had so many compliments...

First off,, this is not a Keema dish,,, neither is it an Indian dish. 'Keema' indicates ground meat such as Beef or Mutton,,,, and Indian Recipes don't contain curry powder,,, ever. Heck, 4 of the other ingredients here are already in the curry powder! (Cumin, Salt, Ginger & Red Pepper).

Still a tasty recipe though,,,, cut the tomato sauce to 2 cups, add a can of diced tomatoes,, and replace the Olive Oil (1/4 cup? Really??) with 2 TBL of Ghee or Canola Oil.  And don't mince the onions,, chop them finely.

A decent start. Based on personal preference, I made the following changes: I drained the tofu, cooked it in roasted peanut oil, and added the garlic & onion during the last few minutes. I cut the cumin back to 2 tsp's, and next time I will omit it all together - it really didn't belong. I increased the curry to one tablespoon, and also added a tablespoon of Garam Masala. I used a can of tomato sauce, and also a can of fire roasted tomato's instead of all of the tomato sauce this calls for. Last but not least, I put the peas in frozen and they were fine by the time this simmered for a bit.

Awesome!  I used 1 and 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tbsp curry powder.  I also skipped the tomato sauce, added 4 large diced tomatos, and used 2 cans of coconut milk insted of just one.  I let it simmer for about 45 minutes, and it was perfect.

Very good.  I halved the recipe, but used a full block of tofu and a whole can of coconut milk.  Also only used about 1 c. of crushed tomatoes.  I didn't have pepper paste, so I used 1 1/2 tbs.  sriracha (rooster sauce).  For variety, I put in a half can of sliced potatoes and a cup of "asian stir fry" frozen vegetables.  I served it over minute brown rice (though basmati or jasmine would have been better) with a wedge of lemon and a dollop of plain yogurt.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

MAJOR typo alert!  6 cups of tomato sauce is ridiculous.  I'm pretty sure the recipe called for 6 tablespoons - anyway that's what I used, and it was just enough. But overall I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  It was good, but not delicious.  More salt & about a tablespoon of sugar helped but still didn't make it perfect; there is definitely something missing.  I'll try ground cashews next time... perhaps it's just missing the nutty flavor?  Anyway, I'll try it again and experiment!  Good base recipe.

I'm glad I read the reviews beforehand--I made a few substitutions.  Instead of using so much tomato sauce, I found that a can of diced tomatoes and a tablespoon of tomato paste worked quite well.  I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons and used lite coconut milk to cut down on the fat content.  It was quite tasty!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I added a lb of ground lamb to the tofu because I needed to use it, also I used a sweet potato instead of the carrots and simmered for at least an hour.  Absolutely fabulous with the naan bread recipe on this site!

I LOVE this recipe!  I make just two adjustments; to make it a little more saucy, I often add more coconut milk (either canned OR the kind that is refrigerated and comes in a carton).  I also only use one 8-ounce can of tomato sauce--the first time I made this I used the full six cups the recipe calls for and it was WAY too much for my liking.  Excellent dish! Great served over brown basmati rice.  Perhaps even better as leftovers the next day.

Outstanding with some of the modifications suggested-- 50% of listed tomato sauce, 2x coconut milk, 2x tofu.  I also skipped the red pepper paste and just did a few dashes of crushed red pepper so it wouldn't be so hot.

great dish and came out looking just like the picture posted. We will do this again! I used low fat coconut milk, and one can of tomato paste, otherwise followed this to a "T". Came out spicier than we thought it would be - good stuff!

Very good, I used 4 cups of tomato sauce, 1.5 tsp of red pepper and 1/2 cup of flower to make consistency thicker.

This is a nice hearty recipe, simple to make and easy to modify based on what's on hand. Modifications: I reduced the tomato sauce to one cup and added a can of drained, diced tomatoes. I added much more curry powder, somewhat more cumin, and used plenty of fresh grated ginger instead of dried. Served over long-grain wild rice as I was out of basmati, with a raita. I would make this again.

This was okay but nothing great.  It was bland for our taste.  My husband and I ate it the night I made it, but we had a lot of leftovers and most of them didn't get eaten.  Probably won't be making this again.

Really tasty dish.  I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I used 1 1/2 cans of mushroom spaghetti sauce, and this worked really well too.

I just made this for dinner. It was fantastic! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes and a half can of tomato paste instead of 6 cups tomato sauce. I also used 1.5x the spices...made the bridge of my nose sweat! I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This was pretty good.  I served it with rice and pita bread.  I really like Indian food and this was just so so.  Not really sure why it calls for so much oil.  Two tablespoons would be plenty!  Try the Chicken Makhani recipe off this site.  Follow the "most helpful" review suggestions and use chickpeas instead of chicken (if you are a vegetarian like me).  YUM! :)

YUMM! This was my first recipe I have made and especially a type of curry dish. I followed other reviewers in reducing the tomato sauce and I added about half a can of diced roasted pepper tomatoes. I didn't have ginger or red pepper paste which I think altered the tastes a little bit. I also added just a little bit of lemon juice.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed these directions more or less to the letter, and did not much enjoy the result. If I were to do it again, I wouldn't use canned tomato sauce -- maybe try tomato paste.

I did not add red pepper.  I also cut the spices down and only added a can of tomato sauce.(14oz).  It was good.  I would maybe only add a half a can of tomato sauce next time.

I like this recipe as a starting point, however I do change a few things.  First of all I too reduce the amount of tomato sauce by half.  Also I change the order in which I add things. I fry the tofu, then add mustard seeds, cumin, coriander, tumeric and curry powder.  I heat these spices until toasted together with the tofu and then add the vegetables.  I stir fry those until tender and then add the coconut milk and the tomato sauce.  I find that toasting the spices adds a lot more flavor.

This was delicious! I made half the portion size and this was more than enough to feed four. I also used half the tomato sauce amount listed and added a bit more coconut milk.

This was an absolutely delicious meal; easy to prepare and tantalizing aroma while simmering. Agree wholeheartedly with previous posts on reduced quantity of tomato sauce, appropriate spice level (1 Tbsp), and addition of diced tomatoes. Added chopped mushrooms last few minutes before serving over brown rice.

Amazing! This recipe is not only delicious, but super flexible as well. I put slightly less salt and substituted red pepper powder for red pepper paste, as well as using slightly less coconut milk and slightly more tomato sauce than is described in the recipe. These slight variations didn't take away from how delicious the final product turns out, though! This turned out better than the equivalent served at a local Indian restaurant, according to my Indian friend who I made it with. Fantastic stuff, definitely a keeper!

My rating is based on following these recommendations: 2 cans of coconut milk (one light and one full fat/cal),1 large can tomato sauce 1 TBSP each of curry and cumin; 2 tsp ginger; 1.5 tsp salt; 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 3/4tsp chili powder. And I used the same amounts of olive oil, garlic, onion, peas that the recipe calls for but replaced the carrots with sweet potato. Served over brown rice. YUM.

This was sooo delicious! My boyfriends been eating and loving the left overs for 3 days now lol. I did make some changes that I got from the other reviewers: I added a whole other can of coconut milk and curry paste rather than curry powder. It seemed to need way more seasonings to seem authentic. I also cooked the tofu longer just to get a good sear on the sides - just our preferred tofu texture. And we ate it over bastami jasmine rice - SO good!

This is amazing with some tweaking, but it would be WAAAAAAY too saucy and tomato-y as written.  Here is my version (which turned out super tasty):  Two 14-oz. packages of tofu; one can coconut milk; one large and one small can of tomato sauce (about 4.5 cups total); 1 TBSP each of curry and cumin; 2 tsp ginger; 1.5 tsp salt; 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  And I used the same amounts of olive oil, garlic, onion, peas and carrots that the recipe calls for.  Served over brown rice.  YUM.

So Delicious!

I made a few little alterations. I used only 1 can of tomato sauce and I added about 6 times as much curry powder. Also, I substituted a little chili powder for the red curry paste.

The recipe turned out AMAZING and is definitely going to be a new favorite in my house!!

Delicious.  I prepared as written, with the following exceptions:  1 Tbs red pepper flakes (because I didn't have paste) and one 14oz can each - tomato sauce & diced tomatoes (following other reviewer's advice).  My husband thought it was a bit heavy on the cumin so I will try decreasing the cumin and increasing the curry next time.  And maybe a bit more salt.

Wow! I tried to cook Indian many times before and it never turned out... until tonight! This was so good and flavorful.  I couldn't believe it because the ingredients were so simple.  I didn't have red pepper paste so I just cut up some peppers and put in a little crushed red pepper and chili powder.  I probably tripled the curry powder too (I never measure).  I used light coconut milk, just because that's all I had and two cans of tomato sauce.  It made a ton! Next time I'll probably only use one can of tomato sauce and a half can of coconut milk.  Only feeding two.  I'm so glad I finally found an Indian recipe that I can tackle.  I will definitely make this dish again!

this deserves 10 stars. So easy and delicious.  Even people who do not like tofu absolutely LOVED this recipe.  But i also made some with chicken instead and it's just as good.  Definitely one of my favorite recipes!

I thought this was good, but I made revisions. I used 1 can of coconut milk, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. I felt like the original recipe amount would have been too tomato based for me. I also adjusted the sauces and used more cumin and curry powder than the recipe stated. Finally, I added a little bit of cornstarch just to thicken the sauce a bit.

This was delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.  I followed the advice of others and cut the tomato sauce back to one cup.  Also, I didn't have peas, so I used one can of drained red kidney beans.  I will definitely make this again.

Okay, this is a fantastic recipe, however, I doubled the spices and garlic and use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of all the tomato sauce.  I also doubled the amount of tofu and added broccoli florets.  My family of four loved it and we had enough for 2 nights.  It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe.  I have made a few modifications to taste: lessened the amount of tomato sauce, added broccoli and sugar snap peas, and instead of red pepper paste I used red pepper powder.  I cut the recipe in half and it was still enough for 2 large dinner portions, then 2 large portions left over.

this was really good.  i wish i had made mine a bit more spicy.  i took the others advice and used about 1 can of tomato sauce and 1/2 can of tomato paste (that's what I had on hand).  I also used paneer, which can be bought in Indian grocery stores, instead of tofu.  I added some zuccinni as well.  Next time I make it I plan on adding more zuccini, bell peppers, and other veggies.

As per other suggestions, I used less tomatoes. I also omitted the peas and carrots, instead adding an orange bell pepper (since that's what I had on hand). Another modification I made is that I added more curry powder and some peanuts just before serving for some extra crunch. Maybe I should've used the full amount of tomatoes, because I felt like it was missing something... next time I make it I might add in some chicken broth too.

VERY good.  I took other reviewer's advice and cut waaaay down on the tomato sauce.  I only used one cup, and it was perfect.  I also didn't have red pepper paste, so I replaced it with red curry, as another reviewer did, and it turned out great.  I omitted carrots because I didn't have any on hand.  After cooking for half an hour I added a bit more seasoning.  I think next time I might add raisins.  I might also use paneer instead of tofu the next time I make this.  I served it with saffron rice and YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definitely make again.

This was FANTASTIC. I brought this to a dinner party and gave out the recipe to every single guest! I did take the suggestion to cut the tomato sauce in half. I also added fresh green beans and a little brown sugar and a bit more curry powder. It was amazing!

This was awesome! So easy, filling, and great tasting. Instead of the tomato sauce I used one big can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of coconut milk, and substituted the spices for 1.5tbs of gram masala to make it easier. Again, a wonderful dish the family loved it. Will be making again.

This was completely gourmet!!  Now, I didn't have the red pepper paste, so I substituted it with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and also a little more curry.  I also reduce the tomatoe sauce to 4 cups like other reviews suggested.  That was  good call, otherwise you would loose the coconut flavor.  My husband and I loved every bite!  I will totally make this for company.  Bravo!!!

This recipe is really delicious and so easy. I used bagged matchstick carrots so the prep was very fast. The flavor is excellent and matures even more as leftovers. Made an excellent dish to go with curried vegetables and rice.

The spices in this are delicious.  I only used about 4 c. of tomato sauce since I didn't want it to be too runny.  Next time I would probably add more vegetables to give it more substance--even with less tomato sauce, it was pretty soupy.  Tasted great served over brown rice!

This dish was pretty good, though it is much more "soupy" than I originally thought it was going to be, and I only used one can of tomato sauce (which came to be about 2 cups). It was also a little bit spicy for me, so I think next time I will cut the pepper paste. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added some other veggies. I really liked the contrast of the sweet coconut and the spices. I will try this again!

I have made this recipe several times and am surprised each time by how tasty it is.  Do NOT be afraid to adjust the recipe to your tastes.  For example, I add cauliflower and think it improves the dish quite a bit.  I also adjust the spiciness depending on who I'm cooking for.  Be sure to taste it often while it is simmering and add spices, etc. accordingly.  It does make a lot of food but keeps well.  Yum!

I suspect that as written, this wouldn't have been like any Keema I've had either.  I put in the coconut milk and spices, then added one 15-oz can of tomato sauce and tasted it.  And tomato sauce was about all I tasted!  Luckily, I had another can of coconut milk on hand.  After adding it, the taste was much more what I'm used to from restaurants.  Next time I make it, I'll use 1 can of coconut milk and an 8-oz can of tomato sauce.  As it was, the dish was a little soupy.  I can't even imagine it with another 2 cups of liquid.  I'd have had to make it in my stockpot!  That said, the overall flavor was nice, and with the changes, will be a 5-star, make-again dish.

I used 3c of tomato sauce and 3c of diced tomatoes (with liquid removed). I found this to be very heavy on the tomato taste, I could not taste the coconut milk at all.  I would not make this again, but would perhaps try using just some diced tomatoes with the liquid removed instead of all the tomato paste.  I did not like the consistency, I found it too runny.  I found it barely edible as is, but I did not have red pepper paste, but I can't see how that would have made a difference.  I used chili powder instead.  Sorry, thanks anyway.

I thought this was really tasty.  Quick and easy too.  I doubled the red pepper paste and it was extra spicy, just the way I like it!  I used 2 C diced tomatoes and 1.5 C tomato sause as was suggested by another reviewer.  Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good- I used 2 cups canned diced tomatoes and 1.5 cups tomato sauce, which was a great modification to add some more substance to the sauce.  I also only used a tbsp of olive oil, just enough to keep the tofu from sticking.  Next time I'll use 1/2 fat coconut milk.

Awesome recipe that I totally doctored.  Not a big fan of tofu so I used chicken.  I cooked the chicken in chicken broth rather than olive oil because I'm always looking for ways to cut fat.  Also used 1/2 fat coconut milk.  Used half the tomato sauce and twice the pepper paste because it wasn't spicy enough for me.  The flavor was wonderful, I just needed a bit more kick.  Love this recipe!!!

This is GREAT! I pressed/froze/thawed the tofu first, to keep it firm. I also added only 3.5 cups of tomato sauce, to keep more of the coconut flavor.

Great recipe! I've substituted paneer for the tofu a couple of times and it came out great as well :) one important tip though - you can get away with using just one 14 Oz can of diced tomatoes, and add it to the onions once they're done cooking but cover and wait at least 10-15 minutes for the flavor of the raw tomato to cook out.  You'll be left with a deep tomato flavor that will be evident by the aroma once the raw smell has cooked out.

I loved this recipe! It was my first time working with coconut milk, curry powder, and tofu. I read most of the reviews and I think I got it. For 2 people, I reduced the servings to 4. I then used 2 pressed cloves of garlic, 1/2 med onion minced, 3/4 can coconut milk, 3/4 package of tofu diced, 1 small can tomato sauce, 3/4 bag of frozed peas, and one carrot diced. I left the spice measurements as they were calculated. My dish turned out perfect even when simmered for 30 minutes. I ladled it over brown rice. This recipe re-heats really well!!

So good! I doubled the amount of curry that the recipe called for and only used 2 cups of tomato sauce. My friend and I both loved it. This recipe is easy to make, very filling and makes a lot.

Tasted great! Was more of a curry than anything. I didnt have chili powder so I used 2 tsp chilli paste. Instead of red pepper paste I chopped up 2 dried red chillis and put it in to give it a mild kick. It took 45 minutes of cooking before the carrots were tender enough. As well I used half the tomato sauce and it was plenty saucy still.

This was really good.  I added some chopped fresh mushrooms and instead of the tomato sauce I used a cup and a half of fresh tomatoes.  I didn't have any red pepper paste, so I substituted 1 T of crushed red peppper flakes.  I also felt that it needed a little more salt than 1 t, so I added more.

Wonderful! My dinner guests were very impressed and I felt like a true gourmet chef serving this. Like others, I cut the tomato sauce down to 1 (15oz) can. Definitely making this again!

Scaled this recipe to yield 2 servings. Used the exact required ingredients except I cut on coconut milk...used 2 oz or 1/4 cup instead of the required 4 oz or 1/2 cup. As to the directions, I only cooked my tofu for 5 mins. Also, I added the peas in the last 15 mins of the "simmering period". Served it with warm jasmine rice (I forgot to serve it with yogurt though I already had it on hand). Love, love the spicy/hotness of this dish! Too bad my hubby wouldn't share this vegan recipe with me...good for ME though, got to eat it ALL! haha! 
NEXT TIME I'll try other reviewers' suggestion of adding diced tomatoes, changing the cumin-curry powder-ground ginger-salt ratio, and adding cayenne pepper. Will also try to serve this with Naan bread. The Naan bread recipe I looked up here required 4 hrs cooking/prep time...I couldn't wait that long! But will prepare ahead of time next time ;-D
Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

this is the only way my family will eat tofu. try using ghee instead of olive oil for more authenticity. definately use more curry powder; i ended using almost 2 tbsp. i cut down the tomato sauce from 6 cups to a 6 oz. can, and that was all it needed, really. serve over basmati with some homemade naan, and you'll think you're in an indian restaurant; it's that good.

I LOVE this recipe! I only used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce, skipped the cumin (only because I don't care for it) and replaced the paste with red pepper flakes for heat. This is a fun recipe because it's easy to adjust to personal taste. Thank you!!

Good, but the red curry paste was too overpowering for my family. We like it spicy but not too hot. I'd cut it in half next time.

This was a pretty good dish, not my absolute favorite, but good enough to repeat occasionally.  It also has the benefit of calling for ingredients I always have on hand.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and a T. of tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce and it was more than sufficiently tomato-ey.  I never really measure spices but I expect I used more than it called for.  I definitely used more than 4 cloves of garlic, more like half a head or until I got tired of peeling garlic.  I used a couple dashes of cayenne and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes in place of the chili paste and added cardamom.    I also had a head of Napa (Chinese) cabbage that needed using, so I chopped it into thin strips and tossed it in at the end with the frozen peas.  I simmered a few minutes and turned it off, letting the residual heat cook them both but hopefully not overcook them.  I think potatoes would be an excellent addition also.  We ate a big bowl each with naan and hummus, a nice meal.

This is really tasty.  Next time I make it I will use a little less pepper paste.   I will make it again soon as we will be using this in our tiny vegan cafe this next week.

This was good but needed changes.  I used only a 16 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I also added some garam masala, cardamom, tumeric, and nutmeg.  It also needed more heat, so I doubled the amount of red chili paste.  Even then, when I ate it on top of rice, I even added some hot sauce.

We made the 10 serving version of this recipe and we too found it too tomato-ey.  We would add twice as much tofu and 1/3 less tomato sauce.  We still liked it and served it over hot jasmine rice.

This was absolutely delicious!  I'm always looking for good vegetarian recipes, but even my omnivorous friends who came by loved it.  I added some boiled potatoes and served on naan, also found on this site.

This was a very good recipe, but I had to give it a lower score because of all the changes I had to make.  I used significantly less tomato sauce (I pureed my own-about two and a half cups) and I had to add more spices than were called for.  The end product was very good, and I could serve a lot of people with very few ingredients!  I will definitely make this one again!

Good but WAY too much tomato. I cut the tomato sauce in half (only used one 28 oz can) and it was still too much tomato. I'd recommend using only 2 cups.

Despite the fact I made this with what turned out to be the nastiest coconut milk I have ever bought, this was great. I cut way back on the oil, upped the amount of curry powder, and also threw in a cup or so of cauliflower florets (curried cauli is my absolute favorite). I served it over basmati rice with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, and paratha. Thanks!

This was so easy and wonderful.  I've always been afraid to make Indian dishes because of their intimidating ingredient lists, but to me this tasted like something I'd eat in a restaurant.  I used light coconut milk with excellent results.

Perhaps I made some mistakes, but this recipe was not the best. I think that one needs to be very careful with the quality and quantity of spices used.  Mine turned out overwhelming gingery with dried Mccormick's ginger and the coconut milk flavor was completely buried.  I imagine it would have been better with fresh...

Loved how easy this came together.  Not too spicy or hot and one can add more curry or heat if they wanted to.  My husband liked it and ate leftovers (which he never does).  Next time I will add more curry, as i think it needed a little more ummmph.

This was the first time I have ever made/ate any sort of Indian dish and I thought the flavor was pretty good. The only changes I made were that I did not use red pepper paste because I dont have any and I dont like spicy. Also, I only used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and I think it was plenty. I cant imagine using 6 cups of tomato sauce, it was pretty soupy with the one can. Anyway, I ate it with some garlic naan from Trader Joes which was really good and actually my 2 year old loved it. Im not sure if I'll make this again, I think its a good recipe, but I dont think Im a huge fan of Indian food.

I did as others suggested and used less tomato sauce and more coconut milk after taste testing of course. I couldn't quite get it right. I am not sure I am crazy about this recipe. I did not have the pepper paste though so that may have been why. I used pepper flakes instead and it needed more curry too. I would give this 3 1/2 stars.

Nice dish for every now and then for us, served over garlic couscous. I halved the recipe, then after tasting it, increased both the coconut milk and the curry powder. I didn't have carrots, but used spinach instead, and it was good.

This is a great recipe; my boyfriend loved it.  I altered it a little bit: 1/2 of a large onion, only 3 C tomato sauce, and added a chipotle pepper spice sort of thing instead of the pepper paste.

again, it was great :) thanks!

WOW!  This is amazing with couple changes.  I, like other reviewers didn't use all the tomato sauce.  I added 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of the 6 cups sauce.  It was perfect consistency with coconut flavor.  My DH could not stop raving about this one and said I could make it frequently.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was very good.  I used Thai Garlic Chili paste in place of the Red Pepper paste, and I used only about 1 t instead of 1 T because I was afraid it would be too spicy for the kids.  Next time, I'll try 1 T as it wasn't spicy enough.

This recipe tasted excellent!! I cut out the tomato sauce entirely and just put in a can of diced tomatoes. It resulted in quite a runny soupy sauce at the end. Next time I'll add a can of crushed tomatoes as well. Pair this with naan bread and whole grain rice and you have a winner!!

I like this recipe but I added a lot more to it. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I added in chinese eggplant and red peppers. I don't normally measure things so I think I dumped in quite a lot of cumin and curry powder. I didn't have red pepper paste so I used this red thai curry paste. I enjoy this recipe and like the tomatoes in it!

I really enjoyed the idea of a tasty vegetarian curry!  The only thing that I changed was that I used curry paste since I love the flavour of it and I used diced tomatoes instead of the sauce.  My husband took this to work for his lunch and one of the guys said that he hated tofu!  So my husband gave him a taste and through this recipe he is a tofu convert!! Tofu doesn't have to be yucky!!

Very yummy!  It makes a lot - I halved it and still ended up with full belly and plenty of leftovers.  I had green chile paste instead of the red, but it was still quite flavorful, as I used hot chili powder and kept the spice level medium-high.  Only had 1 small can of tomato sauce, added two fresh tomatos diced instead.  Used lite coconut milk, added in some chopped mushrooms on whim.  A bit lighter than Indian fare I have when eating out, and very flavorful.

Easy and delicious, but sauce proportions way off.  Used approximately 1 cup sauce, 1/4 cup coconut milk, fresh ginger and no carrots.

I used only 3 3/4 cups of tomato sauce (two 15 oz. cans).  I also substituted yellow bell pepper for the carrots.  I served it with roasted cauliflower steaks and rice.

I make this on a monthly basis.  I love the warm, savory flavors.  Great aroma too.  If somebody tells you they hate tofu, they obviously have not tried this!  I substitute a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for the red pepper paste and only use 2 cans of tomato sauce, which is plenty.  I also increase the peas and carrots to 2 cups of each.  It's great as a main dish.  I also prefer this as a healthy snack alternative as opposed to potato chips and other empty calorie snacks.

This was a great way to use tofu and my husband loved it. I did not use that much tomato sauce, nor did I have red pepper paste but I used other heat and Indian-type spices. It was a big hit! We added naan and a salad. I will make this again!

Flavor and spices are excellent- BUT unfortunately I didn't read the reviews about reducing the amount of tomato sauce. Way to much tomato, and to much liquid for me. I am cooking it down as I write this. I will make again and reduce tomato...next time I'll read reviews first!

After experimenting with cooking many Indian dishes, this was the best tasting Indian curry I've made! It's sweet and rich, very filling and perfect for tofu skeptics. I made several small changes based on other reviewers' comments and our preferences. The biggest change was to use the slow cooker, which I'm always a bit wary of doing, but it turned out GREAT! I added everything together, stirred, and cooked it for 4 hours on low. We didn't eat it for about 10 hours though, so it had a lot of time on warm. Other changes: the amount of tomato sauce listed would definitely overwhelm the flavor; instead I used 15 oz  tomato sauce (about 2 cups) and 6 oz tomato paste.  I chose coconut oil and increased the curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp. Lastly, I used a pinch each of chili powder and cayenne instead of the red pepper paste.

This was easy, and a different way of eating tofu for me.  I followed other reviews and used only 1 can (8 oz) of tomato sauce, and the entire can of coconut milk (TJs coconut cream).  I hate curry powder so I used almost 1/2 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp turmeric,  some fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds, and chili powder.  Didn't bother using the red pepper paste in the recipe.  I omitted the chopped carrots.   I used fresh ginger as always.   Fry the onions and garlic until brown and then add tofu and continue frying.  I also added green bell pepper because I did t have enough peas.  Next time add veggies halfway during cook time, they were too soft.

Made this recipe tonight. Wish I had read all the previous comments before I did. Would have been a nice meal had I not put the 6 cups in (actually I put in about 5)...maybe will only put 3 cups in next time. Not a big tomato fan anyway :P

Okay, but needs some tweaking. I had to triple the tofu to make up for the amount of tomato sauce. Also, mine was a little on too salty. The flavors are good though. I think I will get it right in the next try.

Left out some of the tomato sauce (2C) and hot sauce sense some people in my house don't like spice. It was great. I served it with both a side of naan and brown rice.

I used a quart of unseasoned tomato sauce and light coconut milk and my dish lacked depth of flavor. I will prepare it again but I will need to make some alterations.

I did change the recipe a lot so the review is a little clouded. I used a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and about a cup of halved sweet cherry tomatoes from the garden. Also used 14 ounce can of coconut cream but coconut milk would work as well. I sautéed the garlic, onions, tomatoes, a bit of green pepper and the spices in olive oil. I bumped up all of the spices and used red pepper flakes instead of paste. Then simmered it about an hour because the peas were still frozen when I added them. Served it all over jasmine rice. It was still lacking something but good enough to make again.

Took advice from other reviewers and used 15 oz of tomato sauce. This meal was ok but I won't make it again. It was a good way to use tofu but the flavor was weak. Maybe doubling the spices would  boost this up.

As suggested by other reviewers, I did not use the amount of tomato sauce that the recipe calls for. I cut the sauce down to 3 cups and that was plenty. I also thought it needed more flavor, so I put more spices into the sauce as well. I liked it much better the following day, maybe because the tofu had time to marinate. It needs some adjustments, but has potential.

I love this recipe! Very flavorful and easy. I used a large can of tomato sauce (32 oz) and I was out of carrots so I used a whole 12 oz bag of frozen peas. I didn't have any red pepper paste so I put in some diced red bell peppers and a sprinkle of cayenne. I simmered it on the stove all afternoon. I wonder how this would do in the crock pot? I served it with some brown rice and everyone loved it, even my 2 year old grand-baby! I like this recipe because even if you don't have all of the ingredients, you can still make a delicious meal! I'm keeping this one for sure!

Had this for dinner to ifht with basmati rice.  We made some changes based on the other reviews, and I am very glad I did!  We used less oil.  I cooked this in a Le Creuset pot and I still did not need 1/4 cup of oil. I also cut way down on the tomato sauce.  I used 1 14-ounce can and I thought that was generous. The flavor was good, but not quite like the Indian we are used to eating :-). My 8-year old absolutely loved it.  We all added generous amounts of cayenne pepper to our portions!  This would pair nicely with a potato dish.  The hubby asked to add this to the rotation.  I will probably kick up the heat next time with dome turmeric and cayenne pepper.
