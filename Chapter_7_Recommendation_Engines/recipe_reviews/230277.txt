This is indeed very good, and Hubs and I cleaned it up. But Iâ€™m not so sure this was any better or much noticeably different with the uncommon ingredients of Bloody Mary Mix, Clamato and chipotle flavored hot sauce (all not so readily at hand) than had I simply used the crushed tomatoes and a little spice to kick it up.

I did not use half-n-half, I used evaporated milk and just enough to give it a creamy mouth feel without adding too much fat. I also used sea salt instead of garlic salt. I made NO other changes. This is seriously one of the best tomato soups I've ever had. Everything works together very well and makes this excellent unique tomato soup. I made a grilled cheese sandwich to go with and this was a quick soup recipe that made a filling and comforting lunch.

I'm very picky when it comes to tomato soup, but I really liked this.  Surprising, since I only picked it in order to use up some Bloody Mary mix in the fridge, but it turned out lovely.  I didn't have tomato clam sauce so just used the same amount of Bloody Mary mix--if I hadn't had enough, I probably would've done the same as another reviewer and used tomato juice.  I also used skim milk instead of half and half.  It makes a good amount of soup--we had enough for 3 servings of leftovers, which I'll likely put in lunches this week.  thanks for the recipe!

Was pretty good. I added a little brown sugar and it made a huge difference.
