I tried this recipe on my first attempt at pot roast, mostly because the technique seemed easy.  But I put my own touches on it.  I used the chuck roast and seasoned it w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little italian seasoning.  Make sure you sear the meat well, but not burned.  After searing, I put the onions in the pot with a diced bell pepper, a few cut up baby carrots, a can of sliced mushrooms, a dash of Worcestershire, and half a can of beef broth.  I let it come to a boil, then put the roast back in the pot and put it in the oven.  Last thing was to thicken the liquid with a little flour.  This pot roast tasted so homemade, my husband and daughter cleaned up for me!  Make sure that you add some type off liquid (broth, wine, water, or combination), otherwise yours will be very dry.  Hope this helps, I now have a pot roast recipe!!!

My husband said, "He couldn't have ordered a better meal in a restaurant."  Given my lacking culinary abilities and his finicky palate, this was quite the compliment!  This recipe makes a beautiful presentation and the juices and onion and garlic makes it's own gravy/sauce.  The key to it not coming out dry (as one reviewer complained) is searing the meat for the full 4 minutes on each side.  I set the kitchen timer and left it alone.  Also do not add salt (just like the recipe states) until the meat is seared.  This keeps the juices from running.  I was also able to use a less expensive piece of meat and it turned out fabulously!

This is one of the first recipes I found on allrecipes.com several years ago and I've been making it ever since.  My recommendation:  DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

When people complain that it's tough, but they added water, it's their own fault!

Don't add water or broth.  Don't add potatoes or carrots.  Don't even change the amounts on the salt and pepper.  Just do exactly what the recipe says and you will be happy with the results!  I always am...but when I don't follow it exacyly, I'm disappointed.

This was a big hit with my family!  I did make a few changes and it was juicy, delicious, and flavorful.  I seared it on all sides, 4 min. each side. Meanwhile, on the bottom of my Dutch Oven I put carrots, celery, 4 cloves of garlic, onion wedges,and quartered potatoes. I made a rub of lemon pepper, garlic salt, pepper and paprika. After searing, using disposable gloves, I rubbed the seasonings on all sides of the roast. I also stuck 5 cloves of garlic in slits in the roast. I added 1/2 can of beef broth over the vegies.  Covered tightly with heavy alum. foil and cooked following the recipe. Wonderful!

I picked this recipe because I wanted a plain pot roast without added vegetables, wine, beef broth etc. -- a recipe that allows one to savor the flavor of the beef. This is it! Followed the recipe as given, although my chuck roast was only 3 lbs. The roast came out very juicy and tender with a delicious flavor. There was a lot of juice in the pan, but it's a stretch to call it 'gravy'. You'll have to thicken and season it to get a traditional brown gravy but there's plenty of juice to work with. For those who have problems, two suggestions: 1) chuck roast is one of the cheapest beef roast cuts and I've only been satisfied when purchased at a good butcher shop. The one's found in the grocery store usually cook up pretty tough and/or dry. I've also had good luck with chuck roasts from Whole Foods. 2) Make sure your roaster/dutch oven has a tight fitting lid AND is sized for the roast. If the lid is loose or you use a roaster that holds a 25 lb turkey, the pot roast will turn out dry. Great and easy recipe.

This was excellent...but I'm happier with the success of the gravy that was produced from this!! Thanks to the tips from the "gals" (wink) I added some beef broth to ensure moisture, and per another reviewer, added 1/2 pkg dry onion soup mix.  I did have to thicken a little by adding some cornstarch (very little) but I assume its b/c I added a little too much beef broth. Excellent taste, texture and overall, was much easier than I thought it would be!! Very excited to make this again!! Thanks Teresa!!

My family loved everything about this recipe.  The flavor was outstanding.  I agree with others, FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN.  Go ahead and add some other spices per your taste but sear the meat as directed and then season.  I added some flour to the strained meat drippings and the gravy was wonderful.  My hubby commented that it was the best roast I've ever made.  I normally do a roast in the crockpot but not anymore!

Great recipe! I used about a 3 1/2 lb Boneless Chuck Roast and I cut away the largest parts of fat.  I seared the meat as directed and added 2 cups of beef broth (I use the powdered bouillon, so I used 2 packets to make the 2 cups of broth) and put it in the oven for the first 30 minutes. When I turned down the temp, I added the seasoning and veggies. I used 1 onion, about 2 teaspoons chopped garlic, 1 green bell pepper, 1 whole bunch of celery, baby carrots, red potatoes and 1 packet Onion Mushroom Soup Mix. I seasoned the meat with pepper, Tony Chachere's Seasoning, Worchestershire and a shaking of red pepper flakes.  I didn't use the bay leaves.  I just covered the Dutch Oven with foil and let it go for the next 1 1/2 hour.  It was FABULOUS!!!  I can't wait to eat it tomorrow!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  Easily the best pot roast I've ever made!  This also freezes quite well - just cool and slice and package with a little of the "gravy" in a freezer zip-top bag.

I made a couple small changes. I sauteed the onions and garlic (quite a bit more garlic than what the recipe called for, I'm afraid) in the hot pan with a little butter before layering it in the bottom of the pan. I also added 1/2 cup quality beef broth and poured 1/4 cup burgundy wine over the roast before covering it (partially because a) I did not want a dry pan under my roast, I knew from experiance that you want some liquid in the pan to help cook the meat and b) I wanted to make a decent gravy from those juices. Kickstarting that flavor is always a plus). I did NOT add the additional salt. Absolutely delicious. The cooking directions were spot on for a medium-rare pot roast. Out of one whole roast, there's one plate full of leftovers to fight over tomorrow. We loved it. NOTE: Covering the roast is a MUST. You don't cover it, you will have a hockey puck instead of a roast. Take it from someone who did this once or twice when first making her own first roast.....or two.

Made this recipe three times.  First time followed directions exactly and it was delicious.  Very flavorful with plently of au jus to make a great gravy. (VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE TIGHT LID!!) Served with mashed potatoes & carrots. Next time used the basic direrctions and 1 more onion and 2 more cloves of garlic...my preference.  (Used grated sea salt, it makes me feel like a real chef, especially when I wear my apron!)  That time made my recipe for boiled fingerling potatoes with butter & parsley with brown sugar/butter carrots.  I loved the roast even more with the extra garlic and onion.  Left onion whole so it could be set aside when making gravy.  To gravy, I added a touch of sherrry and sliced portabella mushrooms, carmelized in butter then simmered 5 minutes.  Make sure to get all brown bits.   Third time, I was missing the potatoes & carrots that are usually made with pot roast.  In a slow cooker many times what you gain in tenderness, you lose in flavor.  I did not want to lose one taste bud of the wonderful flavor and tenderness of this roast so decided to add halved potatoes and 1/2 sliced whole carrots.  Also added a little beef broth.  BOY!  BAD MOVE!  Adding veggies & liquid changed the meat (same Dutch oven).  Veggies OK, but meat not tender and lost flavor.  Making again tonite & will follow directions exactly like I did the 2nd time.  If anyone can suggest a way to roast the veggies with meat and keep the flavor, let me know!  GREAT ROAST RECIPE!!!

Calling this "Beef Pot Roast" is a bit like calling a Lamborghini a "vehicle," or the Mona Lisa a "picture." Maybe "Beef Ambrosia" is more fitting. No disagreement with any of the stellar reviews. This is a celebration of wholesome goodness, of simpler times before dinner meant grabbing take-out, a pizza, or fast food. The flavor is that of the beef without adornment. I made it almost verbatim. I had found two thick top round steaks which I had bought longer ago than I care to mention here, languishing in my chest freezer. They came to 4+ pounds altogether. So the cut was substituted for chuck. After browning, I stacked them in the Dutch oven. I simply cut the cooking time by 30 minutes, since top round is a much leaner and more tender cut than chuck. Fabulous! The meat was fork-tender. Whereas calling the resulting liquid "gravy" is a stretch, turning it into such was a simple matter of whisking 3 Tb of flour into about 4 Tb beef stock, adding to the pan liquid, and simmering for 10 minutes.  Poured over the meat with braised carrots and sauteed mushrooms, nestled lovingly on a cushy bed of homemade spaetzle, it was a meal fit for a sultan. Ladies, if there's a man in your life you'd like to marry, make him this dish. He'll follow you anywhere and be yours for LIFE!!!!

Oh. My. God. This is it, people. I've cooked pot roast a hundred different ways with all levels of results, but this one WORKS. I normally don't follow recipes to a T, however figured I'd try it as written and make any changes from there since there were so many good reviews. The meat turned out perfect and juicy, smelled heavenly while in the oven, and holy moly the gravy! All I did was pour the juices into a saucepan, add a teaspoon of butter to smooth it out, bring it to a boil and then thickened it - that's it and it was absolutely delicious. I won't make pot roast any other way from now on.

Followed instructions as described with a 5 pound roast. Came out with lots of juices, however it was well overdone. After cutting and slicing, the meat only tasted good for about the first 2 minutes. Then it quickly became dry and chewy without it sitting in the gravy/roast pot. I also thought it lacked flavor. I added lots of onions and garlic at the bottom to compensate for bigger roast compared to recipe.

I used this recipe for a 2lb, bone in chuck roast from a natural, grass fed cow.  Fortunately I checked it at 1 hour after the initial 30 minutes and it was just a little over done, but still delicious.  I like the fact that this recipe doesn't involve soups, broths, or the addition of vegetables, and just leaves the great flavor of the meat, and drippings for a wonderful gravy.  Especially if you want to use the meat for say shredded enchiladas or some other purpose after the initial meal.  It's a keeper.

I'll never understand why someone will give a recipe a lower rating if the IGNORE THE RECIPE.  I have tried many recipies for pot roast, and this one came out the best by far.  DON'T season the roast before searing.  This goes against most recipies I've seen, but that's why the others were all dry.  This one came out perfect.  Nothing needs changing.

I have made this dish twice with perfect result each time. After reading the reviews, I made only one change, I continue roasting for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees instead of 1 1/2 as the recipe calls for. After the 1 1/2 hours, the roast I used, 3.5 lbs, was not tender, the extra hour moved it to fork tender. When my wife asks me to repeat a dish within 2 weeks I know I have a hit! Thanks for the great, simple  recipe!

This was a real winner with my family!  I rubbed Montreal steak seasoning on the roast before browning. I thinly sliced the onions and briefly sautéed them with the minced garlic and then deglazed the pan with half a can of beef broth. Then I cut small slits in the meat and inserted slivers of garlic. Baked all in a cast iron Dutch oven and added carrots, small quartered potatoes and mushrooms for the last hour     There was plenty of liquid which I thickened with corn starch. Simply delicious!

Well, sorry, but...four stars because not much flavorwise. Not that I want to mask meat flavor but this could use a little something more. I always sear the meat 1st but...I make a salt free blend (like Emerils Essence) and season first. After watching an episode of 'Good Eats' (Alton Brown) I use the technique using HD foil to wrap the roast in. I put the onions, garlic, bay leaf, S & P on top. For me this allows the flavors to cook down into the meat vs meat sitting on top. I place foil wrapped roast in baking pan just in case some juice leaks out. Once it's done & still wrapped, cut a hole in one corner (over a pot) and let juices drain out for making gravy & leave the roast wrapped up while resting. Mine turns out ultra moist and tender every time. Oh, and I sear meat in bacon drippings vs olive oil. A decent and basic recipe for pot roast you can easily perk up with more herbs or spices of your choice. :)

I am a bad cook.  So much that my husband dreads when I want to make a roast for dinner.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and my whole family said I could add it to our regular menu.  Yay!!  It was delicious!!

This is the best pot roast ever.  I use to make pot roast in the crockpot and although it would come out tender, it seemed like all the flavor was sucked out of the meat.  This recipe keeps it simple and allows the true taste of the meat to shine through.  The broth makes a wonderful gravy and the meat is so moist and full of flavor.  I agree with others who have posted not to add any liquid.  I think if you add liquid to begin with it is kind of like boiling the meat rather than baking it.  If you have not tried this recipe yet, do it, you will be happy you did.

Not only did this make a very pretty roast, but it was juicy and tender. In order to make a gravy for the meat I added the drippings from the roast (skimmed to remove garlic and such) with 1/8th cup of cornstarch,  1 1/2 cups of beef stock, a pinch of white pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper. That made enough gravy for meat and mashed potatoes to serve 8.

OMG!!! 1st off, I used a 2.75 chuck roast (boneless) then followed the recipe to T.  Though, I was not sure if I was to season the onion & garlic mixture or the meat, so I did both without measuring.  I was a bit worried about it not being flavorful, I love BIG flavor.  This came out incredible!!! I just wish I had made the 4 lb roast.  I can't stand the crock pot method, not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but mine always comes out dry & stringy.  This was nothing like that! I will never make a pot roast any other way! Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely awesome! I, too, added a bit of beef broth, and after reducing the temp, cooked this for 2 hours. So tender, moist, and flavorful! I don't have a dutch oven, so I just seared this on all sides in a frying pan, then put the roast in an 8x8 glass baking dish, covering very tightly. I think that baking this in a dish that the roast fits snugly into is another key component to keeping this roast moist. We are making French Dips with the leftovers!

Just made this roast according to the recipe. It was very flavorful and the gravy, awesome. I made a 2 lb roast cooked @ 325° F for 1/2 hour and @ 300° F for 45 mins. The internal temp was at 170°. Browned the roast as directed in my cast iron dutch oven. Removed the browned roast tossed into the hot pan the sliced onions and garlic. A quick stir and returned roast to the pan. Added carrots and potatoes around to cook in the oven. Seasoned everything with steak seasoning.  Everything turned out great. Although I thought the potatoes tasted a bit like carrots. 
I was surprised that this produced a good amount of juice. I have always made my roast with a inch or so of water added before the oven. This tasted so much better and the potatoes were nicely roasted. 
To the gravy I added 1 cup of water and a bouillon cube, to stretch it, we like our gravy. To thicken I stirred in 1/4 cup flour mixed with a little water. Great recipe, thanks.

We really enjoyed this dish.  The prep was quick and easy and the result was moist, flavorful and delicious.  I added vegetables for the final 1.5 hours and used some seasonings on the roast itself, otherwise I followed the recipe. I will use this recipe whenever I'm in the mood for pot roast.  Thanks!

My family LOVES this dish- one of our favorite comfort foods!  I don't change a thing- except, I add cut up potatoes and baby carrots 45 minutes before it is finished cooking.  The seasonings, onion and garlic flavor the veggies too so you have a complete meal.  And, I add a little cornstarch or flour to the pan juices to make a very tasty gravy! thanks Teresa!!

This is my second time to review and this even though it is my "go-to" pot roast recipe.   This is the PERFECT recipe for beef pot roast.  DO NOT NOT NOT NOT add broth, juice, water or any liquid.  The only change I made was since I was out of bay leaves I used rosemary for my seasoning and it was delish.  PERFECTION!

Loved this !  The more color you get on the sear, the more flavor your roast will have.  And a cast iron skillet is perfect for this recipe, as it goes from stove top to oven and the cast iron will get you a sear that no other pan can.  When you're plating this, scoop up a generous portion of the onions and garlic off the bottom of the pan and serve them over some great mashed potatoes.  They were the absolute best part of this !!!  One warning:  Watch the roast weight.  I did a 2 pound but failed to reduce the cooking time as the original recipe is written for a 4 pound roast.  It came a bit overdone (still delicious) but that was entirely MY fault.

Just made this last night and let me tell you it was sooooo good. It was so juicy and flavorful. Also, as another reviewer stated, I had no problem with dryness. I washed my pot roast b4 I used it and dried it with a paper towel. After that I just put them into my Dutch oven and let them sit on each side for 4 minutes (timed) I did not touch them, except when added my seasonings to them while cooking which is onion powder, accent, worchestershire sauce and pepper. Instead of using 2 garlic cloves I used one large and then some minced garlic I had in the Fridge. I left them in the Dutch oven (stovetop) and put that in the oven. I cooked them covered for about 20 minutes and the rest of the time was uncovered. This combination of things made it's own juice/sauce and it was sooo good. Also I didn't have bay leaves so I left that out...didn't miss them at all. Thanks for this recipe && I don't even like Pot Roast  but this was good!

Simple and tasty. I had a 1 kg (2-lb) roast for the two of us, so after the initial 30 min @ 325° and 1 hr at 300°, the internal temp was 180° (well done). It was great, but next time I might cut it back to 45 min.

I was looking for a different way to cook a roast without the usual potatoes and carrots, and this fit the bill.  The recipe was followed to the letter, and the house smelled wonderful!  My "meat and potatoes" country boy loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.

I had about a little over 3lb boneless chuck but cooked it exactly the way the recipe stated. I followed some of the reviews and added green beans, potatoes and carrots cubes during the last hour. I don't have a Dutch oven so I seared the meat on top of a frying pan and transferred it to a Corningware ceramic casserole dish and put it in the oven. I covered with a foil and cooked away. The dish turned out really good, very flavorful. My fiance and company loved it. Although I would have liked it more if it was more tender but it still satisfied everyone's hunger. I had plenty of leftover and it was even better the next day.

LISTEN EVERYONE!!!!   If one follows this recipe exactly as written, one will get a wonderful, tasty & tender beef roast.   The secret is the searing without adding extra liquid.  One may season with extra onion or garlic (not needed however).  PLEASE do not change the recipe & then give it a bad review.  Make some mashed potatoes & steam some veggies & dig in!  It is delicious when made as given.

This recipe is unbelievable! So simple and straightforward, with amazing results. The two most important things to keep in mind for this recipe to succeed are: 1) Do NOT take shortcuts when searing the meat. Allow the meat to fully sear for 4 min on each side to lock in those amazing juices. 2) Do NOT add liquid to this recipe (broth, consumme, water, etc) because the meat will make its own delicios broth while cooking. The ONLY thing I changed was to use 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 (I adore garlic).   This goes in my permanent recipe collection as an instant classic!

Definitely added to my favorites. This was the best roast I have ever made. I made it in a cast iron dutch oven and followed the instructions EXACTLY and it was PERFECT! Do not change a thing. The roast was tender and juicy. The searing, which was super easy, made it look beautiful. And my favorite part of the whole thing was the gravy that the roast made in the bottom of the pan....OMG, it was delicious. I can't stop eating it. It reminds of this barvarion onion soup that I get at this German restuarant. Yumm. Thanks for posting, Teresa. And if you are considering making.....Do it! You will not regret it!

A different way to make pot roast if you don't want to get out the crock pot.  Creates an earthy rich taste different than most crock pot recipes, and it is quite tender to for the quicker cooking method.  However, there will not be the juice neccessary to make any gravy!  And, the vegetables do not roast with it, so you will have to make them on the side. I tried it in the pot once and they just get too greasy and the meat loses some of its tenderness, as the juices get soaked up by the vegetables.  In addition, make sure that you trim off extra fat, because it will not melt away like when the meat sits in the crock pot. Though, for some reason unlike many other pot roasts it is pretty good the next day.

I rinsed and patted dry my 3 lb. roast first, then basted both sides with olive oil and added seasonings, then seared the roast on the grill for 4 min. each side (seasonings were Montreal Seasoning, garlic salt and onion powder).  Had the baking dish in the oven while it was pre-heating and placed the seared roast ontop of 1 bay leaf in baking dish. I poured on the SIDE of the roast (not over the top) a half can of Swanson's beef broth (low sodium).  Grated fresh garlic cloves, rebasted the roast with olive oil and placed 2 bay leafs with thick cut onion rings on top of roast prior to covering.  The smell in the house was awesome! Took it out after it's first 30 minutes (at 325 degrees), reduced oven to 300 degrees, added full garlic cloves around the pan and placed snack size carrots around one side and large peeled Idaho potatoes (quarted) around the other.  Placed more large cut onion rings on top of veggies - added Lawry's seasoning (on carrots, potatoes and onions only).  Cooked additional 1 1/2 hrs and I was really surprised how tasty the veggies were once we served it!  They cooked thoroughly yet still stayed firm - and not mushy.  Next time, I'm going to include Brussell Sprouts and Mushrooms. The broth and juices from the meat really added to these veggies and my kids wanted seconds.  Usually they want more meat!  Enjoy this recipe.  It's simple and time efficient.  Hardly any prepping.  If you have two hours - your good to go with this delicious meal.

This was the first time I made pot roast and this is the perfect recipe. I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly. After I took the meat out, I added some red wine to the gravy and cooked it. It came out really good but the gravy had a strong onion flavor which some people may not like. The meat was also a little tough. The second time I made it, I added some water  before I put it in the oven. The meat was so tender this way! I still added red wine to the gravy and some cornstarch to thicken. I definitely suggest adding some liquid before puting the roast in the oven.

ok, I did use a different cut of meat, so that is probably why the meat was tough, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a "t" and I was disapointed. It was bland, and we all had to put steak sauce, or ketchup on it in order to give it some flavor. I consider myself a good cook, and boy was I embarassed with this meal. We had to fill up on the potatoes.....lol

OMG! Thank you Teresa! This was my very first time making a roast. I was very intimidated in doing so. But I found this recipe and it sounded very simple. So I made it for dinner tonight. It came out very tasty. I added red potatoes and carrots at the half hour mark when I turned the heat down. They turned out perfect. My husband loved it and so did my 2 year old! Thank you again Teresa for helping me overcome one of my cooking hurdles!

5 mega-stars! Followed the original recipe and its by far the best roast I've ever made. I'd never go back to a crock pot and/or broth. Satisfying and delicious.

awesome!  My husband and I ate most of the roast (1kg size) at one sitting; we both loved the taste.  Since the size was a little smaller than the recipe, I only cooked it for 1 hour at 300 (after the initial 1/2 hour at 350). This recipe is a keeper!

This was fantastic! I have never been able to make pot roast without a crockpot. otherwise it is dry, overcooked etc. I added a little bit of red wine to the onions and mushrooms and abotu a Tbs of brown gravy mix to thicken(after cooking). I also added some mushrooms with the onions. I will definitely make again.

Just made this tonight, it was delicious! I didn't have a dutch oven, so i just simmered the roast in a pan and then transfered it and everything else into a deep casserole dish. It turned out great!

I followed all the directions except I used boneless cross rib roast but the meat turned out dry and a little chewy. I have cooked this type of meat in the cook pot for 5 or more hours with a rub and it has always turned out very tender and moist. Maybe it was the type of roast in the recipe because it usually has more more fat in it.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor-too much onion flavor.

You can't over cook this recipe!  I left it cooking for about 1 1/2 hours too long and the bottom got a little brown but it was fabulous!  It didn't have enough onions for my taste so I'm adding a lot more and maybe some peppers this time.

This was one of the best roasts I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, using a round Le Creuset french oven.   The meat was tender and juicy.   Make sure you sear the meat before putting it in the oven.  It makes all the difference.

I have to say this was the best roast ever.  I was really concerned that there was no liquid and figured oh well the chuck roast was on sale and only cost a couple of dollars so if it didn't work out no big deal.  What a surprise it was, juicy, tender and terrific flavor.  I did it just like the recipe said to do it.  I only improvised on the gravy, added red wine and beef broth to make more.

Wonderful!  This was the first time that I have cooked a pot roast like this.  I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious.  I was surprised at how much liquid was in the pan.  The meat was tender and the gravy excellent.  This will be my keeper pot roast recipe.

I have made this several times with a sirloin tip and it is absolutely fantastic.  Have also added potatoes and carrots to roast.  Best result was in a LeCreuset pot, going from stove top to oven.  The meat is tender and moist, the gravy/juice outstanding.

I love the recipe.  I make it everytime we have family gatherings.  I do have to change some of the techniques but otherwise the recipe is great.  I buy chuck roast make sure it has a little fat on it, the fat makes the meat cook better.  I also season my meat the night before with Lawrys seasoning salt, then  wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it.  Searing the meat is good.  I put it in the oven at 350 degrees and keep it covered and just let it cook until the meat is able to pull apart with a fork.  Then, I will uncover it for 1/2 hour to brown it and all done.  Everyone in my family loves it and I have to bring it everytime we have a gathering.  The recipe is a great concept and a big hit.

I really wanted to like this recipe especially after reading all of the rave reviews. I have been making pot roast with my old family recipe for quite some time but I always welcome a change.I followed the recipe exactly except I added a can of beef stock to the pot.  The pot roast was shoe leather and the ONLY thing my husband wanted seconds of was the gravy to try and moisten the meat at all! I am used to pot roast that falls apart literally the minute you stick a fork into it. Hubby actually said "what happened to the other pot roast"? I am really sorry but we didn't like this at all.

First time I followed it exactly and it came out perfect, though no "gravy" the onions are almost caramelized and packed with flavor.  Though tempting don't put in extra veggies- the added moisture from them is too much in the pot which overcooks the roast (made this mistake the second time).  For smaller roasts (~2 lbs) I cut 10 minutes off both oven times (so 20 min @ 325 and 1:20 @ 300) and it comes out great, still fully cooked through but not tough/overdone.

Great pot roast recipe. I like that it's just meat without the added flavors of carrots and other veggies. Cooking time was perfect even though my roast was only 2.5lbs. Served it with mashed potatoes and roasted brussell sprouts. It's a keeper!

This was SOOOO good. Way better than any slow cooker roast I've done. Full of flavor and so tender. My family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly until the end. Then I took the meat and excess onions out to use the sauce for deglazing. I added 1/3 cup of red wine, mushrooms, salt and pepper and rounded it out with butter to have a french sauce at the end. I poured the sauce on top of the meat and onions. It looked so luxurious!

I was looking for a different pot roast recipe. I have relied on the crock pot for many years and wanted an oven pot roast recipe. I followed this recipe nearly exactly. I did cut a few slits in the beef after I braised it and put in slivers of garlic prior to roasting. I didn't have a big enough dutch oven so I used a roasting pan and covered it tightly with heavy duty foil. After the meat had cooked 1 1/2 hrs, there was plenty of liquid. I removed 1 1/2 cups of liquid to make the gravy and then I added quartered potatoes and carrots. I baked the beef and vegetables (still tightly covered) at 350 degrees for another hour.  I made the gravy by adding 1 1/2 cups of beef bouillion and thickened it with flour. My family RAVED about this pot roast! It was tender and flavorful and the vegetables were cooked just right. This will be the last roast beef recipe I will ever use! Thanks Theresa!

I have tried a lot of different pot roasts and tend to lean more to the fancier recipes, wine, different spices, etc.  Decided to try this recipe, I added 2 russet potatoes and 3 large carrots, cut in half and in thirds, use Kosher salt, and eyeballed it, this has to be one of the best pot roasts I have ever  cooked, thanks for a simple, easy and tasty recipe.

Very simple and very yummy. I didn't cook my roast as long b/c it was smaller. I think next time I'll add some baby carrots to the pot towards the end of cooking.

Wow!  That's the best way to sum up this recipe.  I didn't do anything different, just followed the directions.  My family absolutely LOVED it!  Easy to make and has fantastic flavor.

PERFECT!!! Only a little change...first I dredged the roast in a flour, garlic powder, rosemary, salt, & pepper mixture and used 2 shallots instead on onion.

Great aroma and taste!  I didnt have time to sear the meat - just put the olive oil and other ingredients in the dutch oven.  Cooked at 325 for 2 hours.  Awesome!

He is begging me to make it again tomorrow for Sunday dinner. I can't wait! This is the BEST recipe for roast we have ever had!!! I did not change a thing!

Per lots of reviewer's suggestions, I added about 1 cup of beef broth before putting the roast in the oven.  It turned out very flavorful and tender.  I roasted it for a little while longer and let it rest for about 30 minutes.  I would definitely make this again!

This was the BEST pot roast I've ever made! Moist, flavorful, almost melt in your mouth. I used one reviewer's advice and followed the recipe EXACTLY. No water or other liquid needed. This one is staying in the front of my personal recipies book.

The recipe results in a great roast.  I browned the beef roast in a heavy cast iron Dutch oven, then followed the recipe and simmered the roast for several hours.  The result was a moist and tender roast; it was delicious.

I always trust allrecipes.com so I thought I'd try this recipe. I noticed some people said the roast was dry. It dawned on me that nowhere in the recipe does it tell you to add broth! Tho when you get to the last line and it says to top with onions and gravy, I'm thinkin'
you're not going to get a gravy without a liquid!!

I followed the recipe and after the first 30 minutes, I added a half cup of beef broth and a good splash of red wine.  Now we have gravy. It tasted a little bland so I added a couple of teaspoons of Gravy Master (or Kitchen Bouquet) to give it taste and color.
Excellent...NOW it's perfect!

SUPER tasty and easy. Didn't have time to do crockpot so tried this one.  Can't have traditional pot roast in my house with out the carrots and potatoes. So I sliced and chopped about 4 each and put a little oil and just enough beef broth to barely cover them to simmer in the dutch oven on the stove, while I seared the pot roast in a different pan.  When done with the searing, put roast in dutch overn, spooned the carrots and potatoes over and around pot roast, did same with onions and bay leaf.  AWESOME tender and flavorful, enough juice to make nice traditional gravy.  Wasn't a bite left.  Had spur of the moment company, made some egg noodles to surround it.  Everybody was happy campers.  May never use the crockpot version again.

I've tried to make this recipe twice and both times it has come out hard and flavourless.  I am usually a good cook but not so good with beef.  I would not try this recipe again.

Followed instructions including one previous recommendation to add red potatoes and carrots when you first turn heat down.  One additional item I added was to shake a little Cavender's greek seasoning over meat at the same time.  Turned out perfectly!  I do not mean to push the Greek seasoning but have found it to be the perfect blend of spices in just about anything!
This recipe is a definate keeper!  Two thumbs up!

Mom would make her famous pot roast for me as a special meal for my birthday.  She passed away last year and I regret not having her recipe.  This one comes so close, my recipe card will read "Mom's Pot Roast".  I can't wait to have my leftovers tomorrow!  Thank you Teresa.

I have to give 5 stars because I don't even enjoy this cut of meat. HOWEVER, this was SO TENDER and *flavorful!- see the following:  I seasoned and browned the meat, then removed. I added onions to the same pot with some butter and 2 bay leaves, after 5 min added some garlic then after another 5 min I added Worcestershire sauce and used cooking sherry, only because I didn't have any red wine. I let this cook a bit longer to caramelize the onions a bit. I put the meat back in and popped in the oven 350/30 min then 300 for 70 min since I had a 2.4# slab of meat. After it was cooked I removed the meat and thickened up the juices for a nice gravy. Thank you I can now feed my husband for a little less $!

Simpler IS better! 'Respect the meat'!
I was always a 'chuck-roast-with-2-soups' or 'throw-some-wine-in-it' kinda guy.
The Mrs. (NE native) had just bought a 3.6 lb. chuck roast & said, "I just want a roast that tastes like meat!"
I went on AR & found this one & followed the original recipe. HOLY SCHNIKES! This NAILED it for both me & the Mrs.!!!
FOLLOW THE RECIPE VERBATIM!!! It's awesome AND you'll have really CLEAN meat for leftovers!
Whether you want simple roast beef sandwiches or if you want to throw in soups or wine, noodles or veggies, you'll have the PERFECT starter-base BEEF for your leftovers!

This recipe was simple, easy and not time consuming like crockpot cooking.  My crock pot roasts always come out fork tender but still dry.  I will not cook my roast in the crockpot anymore.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good pot roast recipe. Only thing I did different was put carrots, onions, and potatoes (from my garden) around it as it cooked and put beef stock around it. Family loved it and my 17m. old actually ate the veggies with it and didn't spit the carrots out, lol.

This cooked up wonderfully!  Searing it properly is the key to a moist roast.  Make sure you get all 4 sides.
I didn't have any bay leaves, so I omitted them.  I DID add sliced mushrooms to the pan with the onions.
Family couldn't stop raving about the perfect roast I made.

I followed the instructions exactly and found the meat tough.  I cook the exact same piece of meat in the slow cooker and it is always perfect and tender.  I tried this because I did not have time for the slow cooker but I think I am back to slow cooking.  There was plenty of liquid produced by the meat and the gravy was excellent.  Did not need to add liquid.

Made for dinner last night.  Delicious, family loved it.   I cooked it another hour to keep it warm at 250 and it was so tender.  Took the onions and mixed it with a gravy mix and combined it in a saucepan with a cup and a half of beef stock to go over the meat and fresh madhouse potatoes.  It was a hit!

Loved the crust on the meat.  I added potatoes and carrots and like other reviewed said, the meat was not done in the time recommended.  I removed the meat and cooked it another hour - separately.  Then, added it back to the original pan and warmed everything up.  Wonderful dinner for a Sunday afternoon.  I'll definitely make it again.

I modified this recipe slightly to meet our needs.  I was out of bay leaves, so I omitted those, but the flavor wasn't terribly affected.  Half an hour before the roast was to come out of the oven, I added some chopped up potatoes and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and my husband raved about the mild kick and flavor the chiles gave it.  Very tender, juicy recipe.

This recipe made the best pot roast I have ever cooked.  I only deviated slightly and used the seasoning mix I always use on beef instead of just salt and pepper and I cut slits in the roast to insert garlic slivers after searing on all sides and I did not use the bay leaves.  Other than that, I seared and roasted as directed.  When the roast was done, I removed it from the pan and added a cup of beef broth to the drippings and thickened with a bit of corn starch for gravy.  The roast was excellent!

This is the best and easiest pot roast. I cooked it exactly like it said. I added one cut up red, yellow and russet potato each on top of the meat about an hour before it was done. There is enough meat left for a small sandwich! If you are going to make this and want leftovers, make a bigger roast! My family loved it.

I have been using this recipe since I discovered it three years ago.  I deglaze the pan before adding the onions and garlic and also add about a cup of beef stock.  I have also on occasion added sliced mushrooms.  Perfect results every time.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent! Mine came out a bit dry, but I realized I was out of onions at the last minute & substituted dry onion flakes. I suspect it would have come out much better with real onions. Still, it was excellent & I will definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe! I was hesitant about the chuck roast but was pleasantly surprised at the tenderness and taste! I just added seasonings, potatoes, carrots and Marsala wine for marination. Enjoy!

Even though my piece of meat was small-about 2lbs, the flavor was outstanding. I'm thinking this is the main dish for Christmas this year. I had 2 servings of this meat and just finished nibbling on the crispy outer crust. This is way better than the over sauced and veggie roast recipes I've tried before. You must try it, just as its written.

Simple, flavorful pot roast. I've made them in the past with added liquid, however I do prefer it without as it seems to intensify the flavor of the roast.   This made an excellent gravy with the drippings; I used a bit of water, clear-jel (modified cornstarch which turned out perfect), and a dash or two of sage and pepper. I have 5 year old picky twin boys, and a finicky husband. They about licked their plates clean. :)

I love this recipe!! I have made a little change to it. deglazing the pan with cooking sherry with the onions and using a herd spice mix along with the salt & pepper. Great base recipe to follow.

Single guy- 1st time making my own roast. GREAT STUFF!  You can do it even if you don't have a heavy iron pan, so don't be put off by that.  The girlfriend was uber-impressed!

Don't change anything! The simplicity is what makes this roast wonderful. I did add 4 potatoes and 5 carrots to the pot (at the beginning), but no broth/water/cream of anything because the roast's juices flavor the vegetables. If you're planning to add vegetables, just make sure you season them, in addition to the roast.

Wonderful!  I really wanted to try a pot roast that didn't require packets or cans of soup, and this was it.  I used a rump roast instead of chuck because the chuck was too fatty for my taste.  I added some baby carrots and chopped celery to the onion and also added some rosemary and thyme.  Plenty of liquid was produced while cooking, which we poured on top.  Searing is key to this recipe and you don't have to add any extra liquid.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Wow!  As a rule I do not like roast.  I don't like mushy, stringy meat but that is not how this turned out at all.  I have several cuts of beef from buying 1/8 of a cow and was saving the roasts until last, as this is the worst part as far as I'm concerned.  But this recipe was not only easy, it was good!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit at dinner.

Such simple ingredients to create this great tasting pot roast.  I was really surprised it had so much flavor and the gravy made from the juice is good too.  I did season the meat before browning.  If you make this you won't be disappointed.

LOVED this recipe!!!!  Made it exactly by the instructions except added half of a can of beef broth.  Added baby carrots, quartered onion and new potatoes 45 min. before it was done.  The best I've ever eaten, much less made!  The house smelled heavenly too!!  I will never cook a roast any other way.

This recipe turned out great.  The meat was so tender it could be pulled apart with a fork.  I took the advice of reviewer MINDAYANDSCOTT and didn't add any additional liquid like broth or water.  The only thing I did do different was bake the roast for an additional 1 hour.  This should guarantee that the meat will be tender.  Next time, I will cut the amount of salt in half; it was a little too salty for my taste.  I served this with herbed, roasted baby carrots, onion, parsnip and celery and it was delicious!  Can't wait to make it again!

The taste was great! A little different than that of a storebought pot roast spice packet (that i normally use). My picky husband loved it and it was mild enough for my 18 month old. The leftovers were very convenient! *Only variation-after searing, i cooked mine in the slow cooker and made gravy from the stock. Will make again.

Used my cast iron slow cooker.  I think you can use any good size roast w/ this recipe.  Make sure to brown for 4 min. on all sides, very important to keep meat juicy.  I also added veges to bottom of pan,with fresh basil and oregano.w/ 1 can beef stock.  I used meat tenderizer w/ spices forked into meat.  2 packets of onion soup mix w/ water.  I also would cut time to 15 mins 325 and 1 hour at 275 then let sit for 30.

This was so good and so easy.  I did as others suggested and seared the roast on all sides before I put it in the oven.  I used a cast iron dutch oven and added 2 cups of beef broth and a splash of red wine.  I also added sliced carrots, celery and potatoes.  when it was done I took all of the vegies out and the meat and thickened the juices with flour and water and it was delicious.  My husband loved it.  Such comfort food on a cold night.  It made the house smell heavenly.

I wasted a 20 dollar roast on this recipe. I thought I would change it up a little and try something new and I HATED IT. The meat wasn't even close to being done, it was tougher then leather and the texture of the meat was just horrible. I will stick to my 8-9hrs in the crock-pot and take the extra time for a melt in your mouth roast.

This was better than other roasts I have made in the past. I think the pan searing ahead of time really makes a difference, locking some of the moisture in the meat.  I poked garlic cloves into the roast and added a whole garlic under it with the onions, which made my house smell divine!!  I also added 2 cups of au jus to the pan and threw in some potatoes and carrots,  roasting with the lid ajar. I rate this 4 stars,not five because it was still a little dry.

Made this pot roast last night and was very surprised.   Normally I do not like meat overcooked (which is usually the case with potroasts).  This turned out moist and even slightly pink.  I did perk it up by adding 1/4 cup each of red wine and beef broth.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

I gave this an average rating because it might be partly my fault that I did not like the meat.  The meat was tough but I used a bottom round roast which is generally leaner than a chuck roast.  I did add the Lipton onion soup mix and 1 cup of water and also added carrots and potatoes to the roast pan.  The veggies were excellent tasting.  I enjoyed the flavor of the bay leaves and onions on the veggies.  I also thickened the juice in the pan with 1 tbs of corn starch for a nice gravy.

I made this recipe over 6 months ago for a friend after she had a baby and her family loved it!  Her husband is still talking about it!  I added potatoes and carrots and garlic powder.  It was really tasty.

This pot roast is so moist, so easy and took less time than my recipe in which it's cooked on top of the stove.  I will definitely make it again.

This is the only pot roast recipe I use since trying it a few months ago. It is so moist & flavorful! The "gravy" is more like au jus, so is really great for french dips as well.

I have tried to make roast beef for years in a slow cooker and was tired of the "boiled meat" flavor and look.  I tried this recipe and loved it!  It was more tender than in a slow cooker - you just need to remember to COVER IT!  I think the trick is browning it first to seal in the juices.  I added much more seasonings to suit our southern tastes!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe to a tee. Excellent ! It made its own juice, so no beef broth needed . Putting tinfoil tightly around my pot then the lid really helped. I had lots of leftovers and this morning chopped everything up and added a jar of marinara with some Italian seasonings . Placed in to two separate containers for the freezer for future dinners.

Good base recipe . As all other explained searing is key.  Here are my changes. After searing the meet, I added the chopped onion, sliced mushrooms then garlic. Saute a bit until a onions start to get translucent. Added a pinch of salt and pepper.  Added 1 crushed beef bullion cube and about half a cup of water. Cooked as instructed but reduced by 30 minutes.  My roast was 2.5 pounds.  As I let the roast rest, I add flour to the pan juices and made a delicious gravy.  My family loved it. I will add this recipe to my rotation.

This roast beef was the best I have ever made.  My roast was just a bit under four pounds.  I did not change a thing except I made this in my deep cast iron skillet with the lid.  The flavor was absolutely delicious.  I had never used bay leaves before, maybe that made the difference.  I did not take the lid off until the time was up and it was perfect.  My new recipe for roast beef.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe Teresa.

Just finished dinner after cooking this pot roast. I am not a cook and I am now saying this is the best piece of meat I have eaten. I did this! Absolutley great. I used a 2.4lb chuck roast from Walmart on sale for $10.00.

I followed a reader's suggestion to rub the roast with spices after searing.  I rubbed it with a mix of lemon pepper, paprika, black ground pepper, and garlic. It turned out great - my husband and son really enjoyed it!  I will definitely use this again.

Awesome. Followed the recipe to a "T", but used a metal blue stone ware-type roasting pan.  Excellent!!  Took drippings, reduced them, and added a pack of dried beef flavor gravy mix for mashed potatoes. An amazing meal.

Delicious and easy...tho I did add a little broth and carrots.  Agree with review stating that it comes out better with a better piece of meat - if you are in Northern Ca look up Victorian Farmstead Meats - guy's name is Adam, lots of great cooking tips from him too.

This is delicious.  I followed the recipe and it came out beautifully.  The onions and garlic made a wonderful gravy with a little cornstarch.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and loves old fashion cooking.  He loved this dinner. I added carrots and celery to the dutch oven and a few fresh springs of rosemary.  I also took the suggestion of another user and cooked off the little bits with cooking wine.  Made some mashed potatoes to go with and it was a complete meal.

Tried this recipe tonight, exactly as stated, and I will never ever make it any other way!  I was a little nervous about not adding any liquid to it but that fear was laid to rest when I got a over a pint of delicious beef juice to make my gravy with.  Don't change anything.....very tasty, moist, and tender!  I used my cast iron dutch oven for searing and roasting, which I think helped a lot.  Just covered tightly with foil, and an hour and a half later.....perfection!

The perfect (every single time) pot roast.  A suggestion from one who just seldom feels the need to follow directions & has to constantly tweek & personalize every recipe I feast my eyes on - JUST TRY to leave this one alone.  It is perfect as it is, your guests will love it and you will be the little kitchen genius who knows how to make a perfect roast beef.

Are you like me? Do you purposely avoid this cut of meat because it's pointless and frustrating? Well.....not anymore!! The key to this turning out perfectly is taking the time to SEAR ON ALL SIDES (high heat for the caramelizing), USE A DUTCH OVEN, and COVERING IT. The previous comments about it not turning out for some people is most definitely related to not doing one of the previous three things. Whether or not you add liquid does not matter. I've tried both and found that I prefer adding a bit of broth or red wine to make more liquid for gravy. I have also added a can of mushroom soup with no liquid and it's come out perfect as gravy too. I also take my 3 lb. roast out of the oven 20 minutes less than it calls for and let it rest for 10 to ensure a moist turnout. It literally has been the top requested meal since the first time I made it a year ago and turns out perfectly EVERY time. Try seasoning meat before searing with celery salt, onion powder, and ground thyme then add a half cup of burgundy wine, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 1 Tbs. Dijon mustard, 2 Tbs. Jarred Minced Garlic before baking. SOOOOOO good! Serve with french bread to soak up all the rich broth.

Terrific recipe.  The roast I used was half a pound smaller than was called for by this recipe so I should have reduced the cooking time.  Because I didn't it was a little dry, though not bad.  I think if you follow this recipe exactly, including the weight of the meat, it would be perfect.  I'll definitely make this again.  It smelled heavenly while it was cooking and the taste of the gravy it made was fantastic.  I used a garlic paste instead of minced garlic and would suggest that you try that.

Followed the recipe to a T against my better judgment...boy, was I glad I did. No way was I expecting it to make some much of it's own juices. I was scared to put in dry, to be honest.  My roast was only 2lbs, so I pulled it out 20 minutes early, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Thanks, this one is a keeper.

It was great for our christmas dinner.  I got a 2.5 lb roast since there is only 2 of us.  I added two small onions, diced garlic and 3 bay leaves.  I did some beef stock in the bottom of the pan just because that is what I was always taught to do.  Once I got to 300 degrees I only did 1 hour and it was just a tad pink when it was done.  Tons of flavor and very juicy!  Will make this again for sure!!

After reading most of the reviews I decided in order to give a true review I would need to make the roast according to receipe.  Even though the family likes a roast I am not a fan of them.  I have to say I was impressed.  I followed everything to a T and I could not believe how tender and flavorful this roast was.  I was raving about it and believe me I don't normally rave about roasts.  I also made potatoes and carrots in a seperate roasting pan.  Would I make this again?  Most definitely.  Would I change anything next time around?  I really doubt it.  I also made gravy out of the drippings and even the gravy was good as I made mine a hot beef sandwich.

This recipe is perfect. I have been making beef roasts for years and this is one of the best recipes for an oven roasted roast. I used about a 3-4lb round boneless roast. Very moist, tender, excellent flavor (surprising for the lack of ingredients), sliced beautifully. Tossed in Yucon potatos the last 40 minutes (I tossed the potatos in olive oil and season salt before adding them). Follow the time and ingredients exactly to make the perfect roast.

I made this and it was delicious! I had to slightly alter the recipe because I used a smaller roast (2 lbs). The only things I did different were: seared 2 min each side and cooked @ 300º for 1 hour. Once it was done, I let it rest and then pulled it into bit-sized chunks.

This recipe really is perfect as is - there is no reason to add anything or take anything away. When it was done cooking, there was plenty of cooking juice in the pot. You could either spoon the onions over the meat or puree it. I left it as is because it was perfect. 

I highly recommend this recipe - it is SUPER easy and extremely delicious!

I have never cooked a pot roast in my life and I do not eat beef very often.  I used this recipe and followed the review # 2 by Jeanne.  WOW.  I prepared a beef gravey on the side. I separated the veggies to a casserole and put them on the oven vent.  I added the gravey to the remaining beef broth and thickend it a little.  Like I said WOW!!  Thank you All Recipies, and Jeanne!.      Joellen

This beats the heck out of the slow cooker!  My meat was tender and the juice at the bottom of my dutch over was a terrific au jus once I drained the onion and added some red wine.  A simple, perfect way to cook your roast!

This was absolutely amazing.  You MUST follow the recipe EXACTLY.  I was very tempted to fiddle with it, but I forced myself to be precise, and I'm glad I did!  What's left is not much of a gravy, so I did add cornstarch and chicken stock to the drippings and onions to increase the volume and thickness of the gravy.  Excellent recipe, very simple and delicious.

Really good! Changes: Rubbed a mixture of salt, Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt, Fresh ground pepper, Garlic powder + Montreal steak seasoning into meat before searing in extra virgin olive oil. Used 3 bay leaves and 3 crushed garlic cloves. Before adding the garlic + onion to stoneware roasting pan, I cooked them on low in the remaining drippings from dutch oven. This was an important step, I think. Then, I added 2 T worchestershire sauce + 2 C beef buillon to the meat/ onion/ garlic/ bay leaf mixture. Really yummy!

This was so delicious!  The meat was so tender and truly divine.  I seasoned the meat before browning with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I padded it down and let it sit so it would absorb the seasons.  It had great flavor.  I added potatoes, carrots, parsnips, onions, and garlic to the pan, along with a can of beef broth and 1/2 can of water.  This did not dry out the meat at all.  Everything tasted delicious.

Gave this recipe five stars, one for each one of us who enjoyed it, and one for the fact that my one son who is very picky asked for seconds and my other son requested it for his special birthday meal. Followed the recipe, except I didn't have a dutch oven/pan to put it in, so I wrapped it all in foil in a casserole dish, and cooked accordingly. Delish!

Very tender when I followed the baking instructions.  It looked like it was going to be tough, but when I lifted it out of the pot to cut it, it cut like a dream.

Made this just as it stated, but I didn't have onions so I had to skip those.  It was full of flavor and not too dry at all.  I'll make this one again.

My first successful pot roast after many attempts!  I followed the simple recipe exactly; the meat is tender and the sauce, which reminds me of onion soup, is awesome.  I'll try adding one more onion and a little more salt next time.

Ok, so I was a little worried about this recipe b/c there wasn't any liquid added to it.  However, it was DELICIOUS!!  The BEST and certainly the easiest roast I've ever made.  I made it ahead of time, took the meat out, and then added some cornstarch to the liquid in the pan to make a thicker gravy.  We ALL loved it and oohed and aahed while eating!!  Thank you, it's a definite keeper!!

Count me among the many cooks who said this is perfect!  No reason to try other recipes; this is the easiest recipe that results in a roast that is moist and tender.

Uh uh uhhh! This recipe was wonderful!  I just bought a chuck roast and needed to know a good way to prepare it.  Mine turned out juicy and flavorful.  I added potatoes and carrots prior to cooking and additional salt and pepper for the veggies.  I also have a very hot oven and reduced both the heat (to 315) and cook time by 15 min.  Perfection!

This was by far the BEST pot roast I have ever made.  I cooked it to 135 degrees. I let it cool for twenty minutes. Each slice was cooked medium rare ( pink center) perfectly.  Thanks Teresa!

My family LOVED this. It was fairly easy to make. The roast turned out with a wonderful flavor and fairly tender. It was still a little tougher than I like. I am used to my crock pot where it falls apart. The gravy was yummy too. I will definately be using this recipe again.

Good flavor and tender, but turned out drier than I would have hoped. I used a smaller cut of sirloin roast and cut 30 min from the time and it still was dry - the gravy made by the cooking helped though. Next time I would add some beef broth before putting in the oven.

Flavor could have been better. I followed directions to a T and regret it and wish I'd added celery with the onions and garlic. My beef came out tough and chewy but in fairness I did NOT use a chuck roast, I used Top Round and they always suck. I have to stop buying them, I guess. Or just made noodle soup out of them.

Made this exactly as written.  It was very good, the flavor was excellent.  I wish it was a tad bit more tender, but that might have been the cut of chuck roast I had or my oven.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Best pot roast I have ever made.  I made it following the directions as stated and did NOT add liquid as some reviewers suggested.  The roast made its own liquid by the end which made a nice gravy.  I did not add veggies/potatoes either.  So easy and delicious, will make again for sure.

I followed the recipe, and it turned out wonderful.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  As for the gravy, I followed the broth, onion dip and cornstarch, that was good too.  Thank you!!!

I have never had a better tasting pot roast than this. It is the perfect recipe if you want juicy tender pot roast. I did almost exactly as the recipe stated (except I added more garlic). There was plenty of liquid after the specified cooking time. Just add thickener like flour or cornstarch to make gravy.

This was great!  I used a 2 pound chuck roast and half of an onion, everything else the same.  I reduced the cooking time by half an hour because of the smaller amounts and it was perfect.  Added a little water and cornstarch to the liquid to thicken it up and used it as a gravy and we loved it.***I have made this MANY times now and still love it.  I have given the recipe at bridal showers and everyone loves it when they make it.

First roast I've ever made.  This is the only way I'll do it!  I don't have a Dutch oven, so seared in a large skillet before moving to a roaster and putting into the oven.  Problem was that the skillet is shallow and couldn't completely cover, so it does splatter some oil all over the stove top when searing.  No prob.  Easy enough clean-up and worth the amazing results!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have any bay leaves, but I did everything else exactly as stated.  My hubby and I couldn't get over how flavorful and tender the meat was!  I will definitely make this again!

This turned out really great.  My husband said it was the best roast ever.  I followed the directions, but cooked it only for 1 hr 15 min because I used  a 2.7 lb roast.  We think it's better than any restaurant roast we've ever had.  Thanks Allrecipe, Purple Velvet

I followed the recipe exactly and the pot roast was perfect.  The aroma and taste were both amazing.  My LeCreuset dutch oven was good for this- heavy duty with a well fitted lid.  The meat was not at all dry- in fact I was suprised at how much juice there was.

This is definitely a keeper. DH loved it! Added broth, carrots, potatoes and celery. After everything finished cooking, I made a gravy with the juices and poured over the meat and veggies. Comfort food at its best! Next time I'll add mushrooms.

A delicious recipe.  I usually make my roast in the crock pot and I won't do that again.  This turned out perfect and so tasty!  I followed it exactly.

This was really great...so simple, delicious and easy to make!  I had all the ingredients already at home...nothing special to buy or have on hand.  Other pot roast recipes called for a crockpot (which I don't have, nor do I like them) and things like canned tomatoes or mushroom soup with I didn't particularly want to use.  I followed the recipe exactly, making sure to sear the meat well and not adding any extra liquid.  The only additions I made were to add a little extra onion and garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon dried Herbes de Provence.  Next time I might try adding a stalk of celery and/or some carrots, but not necessary.  The roast came out very moist, tender and flavorful...even my mother-in-law raved about it!  I served it with mashed potatoes and gravy along with some steamed zucchini from the garden.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe...I won't make pot roast any other way now!

I hate pot roast, but this was so good. Followed the recipe exactly, as other reviewers warned me to do. Resulted in a tender, tasty pot roast with plenty of juice in the pan to make gravy. It was so tender, my toddler with two teeth could eat it. Thanks!

This is my first Beef Pot Roast and it turned out yummy! I followed the searing directions exactly, but added a cup of beef broth since we like a bit more "au jus" and added carrots and baby potatoes. We loved it! He had seconds.

Look no further! This recipe is super easy and incredibly delicious. My problem before was adding liquid. Follow the instructions as listed and DON'T be tempted to add liquid. Prepared it today and this was the best pot roast I have ever made. Plenty of au jus that is not greasy.   **My modifications: Vegetable oil instead of olive oil, more onions (I used FOUR!), no bay leaves**  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Amazing. I'd never seared pot roast before cooking, and it made a huge difference in flavor and presentation. The cut of beef was a bit higher in fat than we're used to, but it's a great choice for a special meal.

OMG - this was sooo good and tender!  I followed the recipe exactly (I always do the 1st time I try a new recipe), and I wouldn't change a thing.  Once I seared the meat (3-4 min on each of the sides of the rump roast, about 20 min total), I changed it to a smaller pan that fit better.  I read the other reviews, and didn't want to take a chance that it would be tough because of too much space in the pan. It's amazing that such a simple recipe can be so good - can't wait to try it again!  :)

This is a wonderful starting point for the recipe, its open enough so you can add your own spin on things. What I did-- I followed the directions--I cut everything in half, added potatoes to the pot as well as onions and carrots around the meat and then added a cup and a half of beef stock to the dutch oven (next time I will add even more--you can never put too much stock in a pot roast--makes for more tender meat and really tasty veggies) After it cooked ( I cooked it a bit longer than required--again a roast is awesome and safe in the dutch oven--I cooked it for 30-1 hour longer) I took the beef stock roast juices out of the pan and made gravy. It was awesome! It had a wonderful flavor! :)  Also, super easy.

This is now my main recipe for Beef Pot Roast! Went by directions no vegetables added, only onion. The gravy is the best/easiest to make. Husband's reply this is A Keeper with Thumbs up. No slow cooker roast was as this easy or as good as this. So slow cooker definitely gets rest after this.

Super delicious!  I don't have a dutch oven, so I just seared the roast in a frying pan and transferred it to a roaster.  Other than that, I followed this recipe as written.  The whole family loved it, including my 16 month old who couldn't get enough!  Definitely a repeat meal!

My husband made this one night when we had company and it was wonderful, the meat drippings make a great gravy.  If you like a smooth gravy I would use a hand blender to blend up all those onions.  Making on purpose left overs tonight!

I followed directions exactly, minus the bay leaf, and mine came out dry, but still delish. I'm going to try putting beef broth in next time to see if that tenderizes and moistens it up a bit more.

This roast is very easy & quick to prepare & cook.  It is also very good!  Everyone in my house liked it very much.  Adding the drippings, onions & garlic to my regular brown gravy increased it's flavor tremendously!  I will be cooking this recipe over & over!

This was a great recipe.Easy preparation and delicious. I did not have an onion but I used Lipton dry onion mixed with a small amt of chicken stock and it worked great. I will add this recipe to my list. Thanks Teresa

I wasn't sure about no water but looked at the ratings and went ahead with confidence! I loved the fact it wasn't boiled meat! Carved nice and was the best tasting roast I have ever made! I like to steam my veggies seperate though so I still did that. thanks!

I made this as written, except for adding a little more chopped onion. It came out perfectly, tender and delicious with plenty of gravy! While the roast was cooking I sautéed sliced mushrooms in butter and put them aside. After removing the cooked meat to the cutting board, I added the mushrooms to the onion gravy in the pan. Delicious! Thank you for the great recipe!

I followed this exactly using a 3.5 pound Blade Roast (I'm from Canada) that we got in our purchase of a 1/4 cow.   I know some people said to put in broth and other things, but this recipe is perfect as is.  I wanted a pot roast recipe that didn't taste like fat soaked vegetables.  Used a dutch oven with a heavy lid and that keeps all the moisture in.  The onion really helps keeps everything moist as well.  I cooked this the day before so I was able to slice the meat very thin the next day.  After cooking, I removed the onions, put them into a strainer to let the juices drain and then just reheated them the next day.  I let the juices cool overnight in the fridge and scraped the fat off.  Using some of the fat and the left over juices, I made a pan gravy with some homemade stock.  Served everything with the leftover onions and some roasted potatoes and a veg.  I would make this recipe over and over again.

This dish was great.  I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper and oregano and wrapped it up in plastic wrap.  Tucked it in the fridge for 24 hours.  Brought out roast today and let it sit for a half hour.  Then followed the recipe to the letter.  For gravy, I added some red wine to the simmering drippings along with a little beef bullion then added the roux. Made for a wonderful gravy.  Meat was excellent.  Recipe was simple and delicious.  Will do again.  Going bigger roast next time, it was that good.

WONDERFUL! I had a not quite 4 lb. chuck roast and followed this recipe very closely. Only thing I’d suggest is patting the meat dry, a la Julia Childs before searing. And I used some steak seasoning on top. DO NOT add liquid! I cooked my potatoes and carrots separately in beef broth then added that liquid to the pan drippings to make gravy. I might hold back some of the drippings till I taste next time as the drippings are very salty. Hubs said this was the best roast he’d had in many a long year. Will keep this recipe on top! I felt like it was a gourmet meal, yet that roast was a dollar a pound LESS than hamburger!!!  Kudos!

I can't believe this worked! I have always used some sort of liquid - broth or wine. But,  I followed the directions to the letter. I had plenty of juice, and chose not to make gravy out of it. We just used it as is over mashed potatoes, and had roasted   broccoli (from this site). How delicious, and it is definitely a keeper!!

So yummy!!  I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder (instead of the fresh minced garlic).  I seared the meat with the onions and then, after I seared all sides, I did a rough chop of some carrots (in biggish chunks), layered them on the bottom with the bay leaf and then put the roast on top.  All of the juices cooked into the carrots.  SO GOOD!  My husband asked to keep this as the 'go-to' roast recipe.  So so delicious!  I did extend the recipe a little by making gravy with the following gluten free recipe:  After taking out the roast to rest on a platter, I add 1 tsp. Xanthan Gum to the leftover beef au jus, whisk well.  Add 1 c. water and then a beef bouillon cube (or granules), bring to just to a boil and then spoon over your roast!

My previous roast came out so dry it sucked part of my soul out.  This one came out perfectly.  Because it was smaller (3 lbs) I cooked it for 1 hour at 300 instead of 1.5 hours.

I followed the recipe except my roast was smaller 2.5 lbs so I lowered the cooking temp. I did 15 minutes at 300 and then lowered to 275 for 1.5 hours. I should have checked it after one hour because it was cooked a little to well done for our taste but it was very tender. I will make this again and use a bigger roast or less cook time. Great recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls.  The only thing I changed was the cookie my vessel - since I don't have a Dutch oven, I used a cast iron frying pan and covered the roast in foil to cook.  The roast turned out perfect.  The delicious flavour of the beef stands on its own and the onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and bay leaves finish it off perfectly. The meat was moist and delicious.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds.  I'm saving this recipe into my favourites box.   Thank you for posting it Teresa!

Follow the recipe, with no changes, and you will have a delicious pot roast.   A  5# chuck roast cooked in the oven in a cast iron dutch oven was fork tender in under 2 hours.  I removed the roast and covered to keep warm, added potatoes and carrots ( cooked on stove top). When veggies done, I removed them to a dish, then added water to copious drippings heating to just boiling.  I used a flour/water mixture to thicken the gravy. I then returned meat and veggies to pan and placed in 250 oven to keep hot.  Easy and delicious - a perfect combinarion!

I made this today and it was wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly as written. I like the fact it doesn't call for a bunch of salt. Very easy recipe that will be made often. Thank you Teresa!

I cooked a 3 lb. Chuck Roast and followed everything in this recipe except I added 1 more clove of garlic and I cup of beef broth.  We love extra gravy.  I roasted it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours and added a slurry of corn starch and water to thicken the sauce at the end of cooking.  It came out perfect!

I have made this multiple times with and without veggies and it turns out great every time. When I add veggies, I put them in when I drop the temp to 300, I remove the roast and I put everything on the bottom of my pot with 1 cup of broth. The key is to not submerge the veggies in liquid so when you return the roast to the pot it is not touching any liquid only carrots and potatoes. I also prefer to use a bone-in roast because I feel it adds another level of flavor.

Very easy, very good...personal changes I made: season with onion powder, garlic salt, meat tenderizer, paprika, and rosemary prior to searing. Sear on all sides in olive oil in dutch oven. Once seared add a can of beef broth and a cup of red wine (used merlot). Cover and cook as directed (Sorry, I know people hate when you change a recipe and then rate it, I had to write my tweaks here because AllRecipes no longer allows personal notes on a favorite recipe)

I made this exactly by the original instructions. It was very juicy and tasty. The meat was a little tough but I think it was because I had a smaller cut and should have decreased the cooking time. Overall a simply but great recipe.

It was okay. I won't make it again, simply because my kids won't eat it and I don't want to have an entire roast to myself.

My first ever pot roast, I am embarrassed to say, but this was so easy.  It made the difficult cut/not-great meat so tender and juicy and flavorful.  My family loved it!!!  I used canned minced garlic that i had in the refrigerator, seemed to work fine, loved it loved it loved it!

This is simple, moist, and delicious! The meat stayed moist after it was cut. I only had a large turkey roaster, so I did what someone else suggested and wrapped up the meat and onion mixture in aluminum foil, then put it in the roaster.I added 3 onions and 3 garlic, adjusting to slightly larger roast size, and just blended it up in a small pot with my immersion blender once the roast was cooked for a thick and wonderful gravy.-no added thickener, just add an extra onion. thanks!!

If you make this beef the day before as recommended, how do you reheat it? I dislike meat heated in mic and wouldn't want to dry it out in oven. Just wondering.

This really is almost perfect! I made these changes: 1. I dusted the roast with flour, a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper before browning. 2. After removing roast from pan for veggies, I also added red potatoes, mushrooms, celery and carrots with the onion and garlic. Plus, I added 3 T. of A1 Steak Sauce and 1/4 cup cooking Sherry. (If you're against cooking sherry use the same amount of apple cider). 3. I cooked in the cast lidded roasting pan stovetop for about 15 minutes before returning roast to pan. 4. I cooked at 350 Convection Oven for 30 minutes, took out and stirred while reducing to 300 (Convection) for 1.5 hours. Everything else was exactly the same, DELICIOUS!

I made it exactly as written. I too was skeptical about not adding liquid but plenty was generated - no worries there. The flavor of the roast was blah - sort of overpowering onion-y, greasy - blah and dry. Thank goodness for gravy packets! Love the idea of pot roast on a chilly fall day in New England but I believe my attempts at making pot roast are over!

Excellent and simple.  It takes very little effort to have a moist and flavorful beef entree.  Both times I've made this I covered the beef loosely with foil inside my covered roaster pan.  First time I made this, I took the juices and made a gravy.  Second time, removed cooked beef and added 1 can condensed French onion soup (14 oz) and 1/2 can water to the juices/onions/garlic remaining in roaster. (I added the soup and water because I wanted au jus but didn't have nearly enough liquid from the beef this time.) Brought to a simmer on the stove for 10 minutes.  Strained all plus scrapings through wire strainer, drained off fat; wonderful au jus for meat.

This is a very good,  very simple recipe! I made it for Christmas dinner & my boyfriend really liked it! The only changes I made were marinating the roast for a few hours before searing the meat.  I also added mushrooms & beef broth to my French oven to help flavor the roast as it cooked. It was delicious!!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!!

I enjoyed this recipe very much...added about 1/2 cup of beef stock to the pot before adding it to the oven, as I was afraid that it would get too dry.  It was very moist, but very well-done, so I would probably cut back the time a bit...maybe to 1 1/4 hours for the final time.  However, it is the ONLY pot roast that my kids will eat without complaining!  Well done!  :)

This is a quick and easy recipe which is what I love about it. I added potatoes and carrots to the cooking process and I added about a cup of water after the first 1/2 hour. I don't know if it was necessary or not, but it helped the vegetables to cook faster. I found the meal to be bland, so next time I will season it, but I really like the ease of the meal

Yum, yum, yummmmmo!  This was SO tender and moist, so delicious!  My chuck roast was just over 2 and 3/4 lbs.  i was skeptical about the absence of liquid, so I did add about 4oz of beef broth and a few splashes of worcestershire.  I also sautéed the onions in the remaining olive oil and about 1 tbls of butter.  Definitely will make again!

I have to give this recipe 5 stars even though I changed it only to add liquid (beef stock and wine) and a bit of Herbes de Provence to the pot before covering and placing in the oven for several hours.  The resulting gravy was so flavorful it needed nothing other than thickening.  The meat was incredibly tender and juicy just falling apart when we were ready to enjoy it.  It's the first pot roast I've ever made and won't change a thing when making it again.......and again.......and again.  I love making Boeuf Bourguignon and consider it a complete labor of love due to the complexity of it.  This pot roast was so easy and delicious it provides a wonderful alternative to spending 4 hours making Julia's famous recipe!  Thanks so much for posting this!  Aunt Tilly

Excellent recipe.  Meat is tender and the gravy, made according to the Dec. 19, 2003 review by DREGINEK is light and flavorful.

This was a disaster.  i would've given it one star if I hadn't added carrots and celery to the bottom of the pot and a tsp of bouillon instead of salt--meaning I changed the recipe.  But I don't believe these changes were enough to turn out a dry tough roast.   
I read so many reviews and listened to those that said do not change a thing.  I figured I'll start from there and make changes next time.  The change I'm making is to NEVER make another roast in my life.  
In an attempt to save the expensive grass fed beef from going into the garbage, today I put the thinly sliced leftovers right back in the oven @ 250 degrees for 4 1/2 hours--in the gravy I had made with some extra water to keep it submerged.  At least now it's tender and falling apart easily and with a new batch of gravy I'll be able to disguise the dryness.

GREAT!   wish some changes.  I used a chuck roast and after searing, I put roast on onion mixture for 30 min.  then added carrots & potatoes and covered it with a mixture of :  1 can french onion soup, 1 envelope onion soup mix and 2 tbs. worcestershire sauce.  Finished  cooking @ 300 for 1 1/2 hrs. removed meat & vegies then thickened liquid with a little cornstarch.  EXCELLENT

Very Simple and very good!  I always seem to over cook beef roasts!, but this turned out excellent!  I had a 5.5 lb. roast so i cooked it 30 mins. longer, but i should have taken it out after 1.5 hours...my mistake, but it still was juicy and tender.  I do believe the searing is the key, like others have said!  I will use this as my pot roast recipe for now!  I may not even tell how i got the recipe...and just call it my own!  LOL
Thanks!

I hate to rate this only 3 stars but I checked the meat after only 55 minutes, 35 minutes short of the recommended time and my roast was already 190 degrees (well-done).  We live at 7,000' elevation so maybe that is why the meat cooked so fast, not sure, but the meat was barely edible.  I was thinking maybe I was suppose to lower the temp to 200, not 300.  Oh well, I also cooked some carrots, potatoes and celery in the pot and they came out great!

I didn't read closely enough and added my usual 1 cup water and half cup wine to the pan before I put the roast in the oven. I was nervous but it was still nice and tender. This is a good recipe. I'm looking forward to trying it again without the liquid

I made a few changes, but this was the best pot roast I had ever made. I sauteed the veggies with beef broth to get all the goodies off the bottom of the pan, and then added enough broth to cover 1/2 of the roast. I also added fresh rosemary and oregano, this was delicious.

This is a great recipe; however, after searing and removing the roast I add about a cup of red wine. This give such a rich wonderful taste to the meat and the gravy!

Inlaws were over last minute for dinner and they raved over this. I used sweet pototoes instead of white...just a family preference. Mother in law said it was much better then hers...YES! Success! Don't skip the vermouth..I think its the Pow in this dish.

Loved the flavor of this!  Mine was a bit dry, but I think that was my fault (over-cooked & didn't use a tight enough lid).  I can't wait to make it again.

good recipe made with tradition in mind. I think most people are forgetting to add fresh herbs to there recipe's. This one could have used some fresh parsley, sprig of rosemary and thyme. It always adds some freshness to the meal.

Delicious! The only thing I do different is cook it on top of the stove on low until the meat is falling apart. Very juicy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

This reminded me of the roast that my grandmother used to make!  I did make some changes.  I don't have a dutch oven, so I used my electric frying pan.  I preheated it to 325.  I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and garlic and onion powders before searing it.  I topped it with it some beef boullion (crushed), chopped onion, 2 bay leaves, and about 2 cups of beef broth.  Because my roast was smaller, I cooked it at 325 for about 15 minutes, then turned it way down to about 250 and let it cook for an hour.  I added new potatoes and baby carrots to the pan as well.  It was a great one pot meal and a great alternative to the roasts with mushroom soup!

I gave this Pot Roast a well deseved 5 stars.  My family loved this recipe. Tastes like my grandma's pot roast.  After reading reviews I followed the recipe exactly except I stired 2 cups beef broth and 2 cups of mushrooms in after the first 30 minutes of cooking only because we like lots of gravy. When the roast was finished I removed the roast from the dutch oven onto a plate, mixed together 2 Tbls of corn starch & 1/2 cup cold water.  I stired that into the broth in the dutch oven and brought to a boil, then simmered about 5 minutes.  I put the roast into a deep plate then poured the gravy over the top.   I also had placed whole unpeeled potaotes, carrots and celery in a baking dish with water covered tightly with foil and baked with the pot roast for same time.  Hot bread and you have the Best Pot Roast meal imaginable!

I think this was the best roast that I have ever made.  It was moist (I added the beef broth as many other reviewers did)and very flavorful.  I have to agree with everyone else that the searing of 4 minutes on each side made a huge difference. I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!! :)

I would give this one a 4.5 if I could.  The searing of the meat was a great tip!  I added some celery to my version of this recipie and used garlic powder in leiu of actual garlic and it waws delicious!  I've never had such a juicy roast in my life!  Thank you

Loved This!!!! I used a 1/2 cup of beef broth, and made a mixture of grated garlic(3cloves)grated 1/2 a small onion,1Tbsp. Greek seasoning, soy sauce(1/2 tsp.) about 1Tbsp. E.V.O.O and a few dashes of Tabasco, Worcestershire sauce and pepper. smeared it over the roast covered it and cooked for about 1 1/2 Hrs total... Best roast EVER!! and the gravy was to die for!!! My roast was so tender!!! and juicy!!! never again will I use a crock pot for roast.

Not too bad!  I followed the recipe exactly except after the 1st 30 minutes I added 1 cup beef broth, however I really don't think that it needed it.  The meat was tender and not dry at all.

I gave this pot roast 5 stars because only because I was able to spruce it up.  Searing the roast on all sides is great and the cooking time is perfect but recipe itself is bland.  I add, carrots, potatoes, bell peppers, and when I cook it, I use chicken broth mixed with gravy but more broth then you should so it's not too thick.  Also, Johnny's seasoning salt makes it perfect.

I did make some changes which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  I seared the roast in the roaster pan on all sides.  Then I mixed together 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup with 1 1/2 cans water (next time I'm going to use beef broth but I was out of it!.  I whisked them together and added 1-2 tsp of thyme and a couple of shakes worcestershire sauce. I surround the beef with chopped onion, baby carrots, and potato wedges. I seasoned all with salt and pepper then poured the soup mix over.  I roasted it for about 1 1/2 hours at 350.  It turned out great.  I will be making it again but I think I'll try it in the slow cooker.

Couple of changes made this recipe to die for. Add 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 dissolved beef bouillon, 1/2 cup diced celery & 2 cups water to onion/garlic mix.  Also, be sure to sear meat without any seasoning.  Once seared, sprinkle both sides with salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder.  Talk about your fixer-uppers!  This makes a 5-star DELISH!!

I have made this dish several times and everytime it has come out great!  Both my VERY PICKY husband and daughter love it.  Neither of them are a fan of "crock pot" pot roasts so this was a great recipe to find.....THANK YOU!  I follow the recipe exact, except that I had a cube of Beef Boulihan to the water to add flavor.  I also use jarred beef gravy (as I am not good at making my own) and scoop a few spoon fulls of the juices left after the it is done into the gravy and it comes out great.

This ended up so tough I had to throw it out. I followed the recipe, but I was told I probably should have cooked it a lot longer when discussing it with friends. Maybe I did something wrong, but I will always cook my roast in a crockpot from here on out.

This was my first try for a Pot Roast. It turned out excellent.Thank you for posting this recipe.I scaled it down for 2 servings. The meat was not dry, I made a gravy from the drippings, using cornstarch and a dash of soysauce. The recipe will have a repeat performance with my family.

I am not a huge fan of pot roast.  But my husband and children like it, so i keep trying.  This one has a very nice flavor.  Mine still turned out tough, although it definately wasnt dry.   I really liked the flavor of this, but am still looking for a melt in your mouth tender pot roast recipe.

I followed the directions and roast turned out dry. It may have been the cut of beef. I added the red potatoes and carrots as others suggested, they were excellent.

I increased the salt to 3 t. and used season salt for more flavor.  I also sprinkled both sides of the meat with the seasoning.  I agree it is an easy recipe and is now in my rotation of meals.

THis is the best tasting, easiest to make roast I have ever made. I start it in the morning and let it simmer all day with the veggies added around noon. I added a little ginger the 2nd time and it was great too.

Made this recipe tonight, I added a lot more garlic and added water to the bottom (maybe 2 cups? It was fantastic!! I misjudged and overcooked it but the meat was still moist and tender. The onions in the bottom were caramelized perfectly and I ended up just mashing them into the juices and thickened it with a flour/water slurry. Best. Gravy. Ever!! Will definitly use this recipe again.

I will definitely make this one again.  I did season the roast with freshly ground salt, pepper and Costco granulated garlic prior to searing it, but that was the only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe.  My boyfriend raved about the roast and made sure I didn't lose the recipe!

As was stated elsewhere, do not vary from this menu. Do not add potatoes, carrots, or stock. The moisture comes from the meat itself (and the onions). Prepare your vegetables separately - starting them during the 300F phase, i did them in the same oven, and the results could not have been better.

Wow! I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I was hesitant about this recipe because of some of the negative reviews saying it comes out dry, but I'm SO glad I decided to try it. I wanted something other than the typical slow cooker, onion soup mix, can of cream of mushroom recipe and this definitely delivered! Only change I made was doubling the garlic because we love garlic. This one is Absolutely a keeper. We can't wait to slice it and use the leftovers for sandwiches. Thank you for sharing this. Sincerely, Thank You!

Made no changes. Pretty tasty. Bay leave was not overpowering but came through as just a hint. Will make again.

I kept the recipe as is with only adding our preference of seasoning, OMG... we are not big red meat eaters but this was so tender and flavorful in its own juices  (remember do your own thing on the seasoning part) that I will be making it again.  DO NOT add water or broth to make gravy until the roast is done!

This recipe turned out great!  We added 4 cups of broth plus 1/4 cup red wine because we live in Colorado where it is very dry and foods need liquids to keep from drying out.  The next time, we’ll use a little less liquid because it was so much. We seared the roast as recommended and then removed it from the Dutch Oven.  We boiled the broth and then poured it into Dutch Oven to deglaze the bottom and get up the brown bits and added the wine.  We put the roast back in and set the onion quarters around it.  For an almost 5 lb. roast, it was done in 2 hours (145 degrees), but we had to keep it warm because the rest of the meal wasn’t ready yet and it got up to 160 degrees internal when we finally cut into it.  But still the tastiest roast we had made. The gravy came out great as well with lots of liquid to work with.

Make this recipe exactly how it is stated. Don't get creative. Don't add Don't subtract. I make this, and it turns out tender and juicy and perfect every time. I like carrots and potatoes, so I make them in a separate dish and bake them alongside the roast.

I made it exactly as it stated and didn’t change a single thing,ughh, I check the meat when it was 160° it wasn’t tender at all, then I check when it was 170° it wasn’t tender too... I wait until the meat came up to the 180° same thing. I hate to throw it out but I have to.

This may be the best pot roast I have EVER tasted.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I stayed true to the recipe even though I wanted to add potatoes and carrots.  I made sure to give the meat a good sear.  I am only cooking for two, so I used a 2 lb. boneless chuck roast.  Being that small,  I checked it an hour after I lowered the heat.  It was already done.  I let it rest 15 minutes.  I think cooking the vegetables on the side made the difference.  Plus the gravy right out of the pan on mashed potatoes was superb.

i made it it was one of the best i ever made......after i salted and peppered the meat then seared it.  cut up onions lots of garlic and half  a green pepper and 2 bay leaves and put them in.  put in 1 1/2 packet of sazon  on top of that and put the meat back in.  then finally put 3 meat bouillon cubes in about 1 1/2 cup of boiling water  then poured that on top. mistakenly cooked it at 375 for 30 mins then 300 for 1 1/2 hour. best one i have ever made wow.

I followed the recipe exactly except after 1 hour at 325 degrees, I lowered the oven to 300 degrees for 2 more hours. Adding the carrots and potatoes with a hour to go. I was happy with the amount of juices which made a wonderful gravy. The roast was moist and tender. This recipe is a keeper.

So I read this and decided to skip a bunch of steps, essentially putting a half-thawed roast into my enamel Dutch oven, coat it with seasoning of your preference, and put a layer of onion and a sliced carrot in the botoom.

Excellent and simple. I love Allrecipes.com because all the other recipe sites think you want  to know all about what they cooked their whole freaking first year of marriage and what was their first born's favorite recipe and how their great Aunt Sally did it and on and on. This site is just recipes without all that  that narcissistic people think we care about. Thank you.

Delicious!! Pot roast in the oven definitely low and slow is best. Just felt this needed some liquid so half way through the recipe I changed it. I will post a different recipe with the changes  I made as my family devoured it!

This was perfection.  The onion gave off so much liquid, I was shocked.  However it did not taste oniony.  I was all out of bay leaves but it still came out great.  What an easy and perfect recipe.

Amazing tender and delicious! This recipe does not include potatoes or carrots which allows for a wonderful gravy which results in an extremely moist roast. All the moisture remains in the meat.

Added water to cover bottom of slow cooker pot and cooked a 2 lb. roast on high for 5 hours (without first searing). Roast turned out very tender and tasty and produced enough broth to make onion gravy. For a side dish, halved and broiled red and yellow baby potatoes and baby carrots all seasoned with Penzey's California pepper and Kosher salt. Husband loved meal.

I followed the recipe, mostly. I tweaked a few things.  Before I brown my roast, I first cover it on both sides with some seasoned meat tenderizer.  I let that sit for about 30 minutes, then sprinkle with granulated garlic, black pepper and a.p. Flour. I then take a small ceramic plate and pound the roast on both sides.  I also added a cup of beef broth to the pan before going into the oven. This was the most delicious pot roast I’ve ever made!

Simple, quick and delicious. I skipped the artificial gravy and instead poured a cup of beef broth in the bottom of the roasting pan. Next time I will add some red wine for a little tang. Prep tweaks: Cut the roast into multiple sections, Salt and Pepper all sides, then sear it well. I added 6 carrots and 6 red potatoes, with salt and pepper, as sides - all in the roasting pan. Celery would be another option. Make sure you seal the pan well with aluminum foil so everything turns out moist. Best roast recipe I've made yet!

Easy to make, with yummy results - would definitely make again!  I opted to pre-season from the day before (made a "rub" by blending garlic, onions, escallions, and adding salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce)...so tender and delicious!

Not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe very closely. The flavor was wonderful but it had to be one of the toughest roasts I've ever had. Not sure if it was the cut of meat or if I missed something.

The prep was so easy, I followed the roasting instructions to a tee.  I sliced the roast,  removed  the fat and most of the onion from the drippings, then made the gravy.  I poured a small amount of the gravy over the sliced roast, covered the roast and put in the refrigerator for 24 hours.   On Christmas day, I took the roast out of the frig, let it set on the counter for amount an hour and then put it in a warm, 350 degree over for about 30 minutes, then turned the oven off until we were ready to eat.  It was so tender and juicy it was amazing.  I think it was the 24 hours in the frig that did the trick.  When I first sliced it, the roast seemed dry.  I was almost afraid to serve it, but I had nothing else.  I thought I was going to have 3 lbs of leftovers to make soup with.   But in the end, I barely have enough leftovers for a sandwich.  Everyone enjoyed my non conventional Christmas dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I also added carrots and potatoes into my Dutch oven. After the roast was done I removed it from the pot, turned the heat up to 350 and placed the veggies back in the oven for 45 more minutes.  I removed the veggies,  turned the heat on the stove to medium,  added about 1 1/2 cups of water, some beef bullion, scraped the sides and bottom and made a great gravy to top it off.

Absolutely loved this pot roast!!!  Perfect just the way it is.  I didn't have garlic cloves but substituted garlic powder instead.    The juices also made amazing gravy.

I am extremely upset right now, a complete waste of good meat. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out extremely dry and flavorless. Way too much onion flavor and completely bland, just disgusting. I don't want to offend anyone but um this recipe isn't for you if your used to soul food (if you know what I mean) WE are not the target audience!! Ugh I'm so mad... why so bland!? Why so much onion?? couldn't even taste the bay leaves. I made gravy and just dumped it on top but whatever isn't eaten tonight will go in the trash and I am going to RUN to the phone BEGGING my aboriginal grandmother for her pot roast recipe. This was gross y'all!!!!!!

This was really good! I did doctor a few things:
- added more garlic and baby carrots to the onions in the pot 
- added about 1" of chicken stock and let it boil
Then put meat over veggies
- added mini red potatoes ("strawberry red") to the sides of the pot
Then added thin slices of butter to the top of the meat before covering and placing in the oven.
It was moist, soft and very flavorful!

This was the best pot roast I've ever made. Followed the directions to the letter which is not my usual thing but I am happy I didn't change anything. This was delicious and I am not normally a lover of any beef cooked well done.  I made mashed red potatoes and sliced parsley carrots with the best gravy thanks to the juices from this method of cooking.

I made this not knowing exactly what I was going to do with the meat and then I realized I had all ingredients for taco's.
I simply shredded the meat at the end and it was perfect. Hubby loved it and so did I. Cooked it pretty close to the directions. The only deviation was time cooked because I only had 3lbs of chuck roast.

I just made this, and for someone who doesn't usually eat pot roast I actually like it! The only things I did differently was add this Chupacabra Rub before I seared it because I was in a rush and didn't read reviews until after I did. I also added chopped carrots and celery with the onions. My chuck roast was a little less than 5 lbs. I used a 2 piece lodge cast iron combo cooker (3.2 quart) together it's like a Dutch oven.  I had plenty of juices left over, I want to say around 2 cups? The meat was tender after the last 1.5 hours. I served it with sautéed asparagus and steamed potatoes ( in the Instant pot). This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, as other reviewers suggested, and the roast was great. I cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven with a glass lid in my electric oven. I've cooked many a roast in a slow cooker and this roast was much tastier and had better texture.

I read the reviews before hand.All I have is a portable roaster and I always cook my roast in a pressure cooker.It's always good  but I was intrigued with this recipe.I followed it just as written but had an emergency so it sat in the roaster for an extra hour.Didn't hurt it one bit.I did have room for 4 whole gold potatoes.On the stove I boiled some carrots /w/ sugar.Removed the juices and onions and boiled for 3 minutes  adding a little water and cornstarch.It looked wonderful on the plates and hubby said it was the best.Thanks.

I  followed this recipe with just a couple of additions and it came out perfect! I poked the roast first and added some seasoning to it before searing. And at the advice of another user who left a review, I also put about 1/2 can of beef broth in the pot before it went into the oven.

The roast came out perfect, very tender and very tasty. I'll definitely use this recipe again :)

This was fantastic!!!!  I used a 3.7 pound bottom round roast as it was all I could find at the grocery store.  Made no changes, except reduced the cooking time at 300 degrees by 1/2 hour to account for the smaller size roast.  It was a bit well done for my taste, but the middle was nice and pink.  And this was surprisingly tender!!!  Super easy - will make many times again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I followed the recipe including having a 4 lb. boneless chuck roast.  I know how to make a pot roast but didn't know how long a larger roast might take, so I looked for a recipe.  The flavor was wonderful as expected.   The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the roasting directions.  Frankly, I didn't remember lowering the temperature, but my memory is sketchy sometimes.   My roast had a thicker section, and this was where lowering the heat did it no service.  After two hours total, my roast needed more time.  Even the thinner areas and the carrots benefitted from a little more time.  I gave it another half-hour/45 minutes to get it done.  Next time, I will keep the temp at 325 degrees for the entire roasting time and plan for 2-1/2 hours with a 4 lb. roast.  Otherwise, this the classic oven roasted pot roast recipe.

Great recipe. Easy to make. I added fresh rosemary, dried herbs and a splash of red wine before popping it into the oven.

The simple recipes are always the best. This is a great recipe. 

I really wish some of you attention whores would just rate the recipe.  That way we'll all know if it's good or bad. 

If you want the world to know how you perfected someone else's work to your liking, POST A DAMNED RECIPE.

This is absolutely the best roast I have ever made.  The meat almost melts in your mouth.  I followed the directions exactly as written but did cook it about 2 1/2 hours.  Will make this again!! My husband loved it.

Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added beef broth. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. This roast was easy to make and very delicious.

The cooking method for this recipe was awesome. The only alteration I made was the following: After searing and removing the meat, I mixed one packet of French onion soup mix with 2 cups of beef broth.  I added it to the Dutch oven and brought it to a boil, scraping up the meat and juice reside after searing. After adding the onions and garlic (I also added extra garlic), I poured it over. Super flavorful and juicy!!!

Made a few changes and the roast was a hit with the family!  I inserted a bit of garlic into the meat before searing and added 3/4 cup of beef broth to the pot before adding the seared meat.

Came  out perfect.  The trick is browning it on all sides to sear in flavor.

best way to flavor the meat is to deep slit into meat at three times along the roast and insert at least one or two cloves of garlic (according to personal taste).

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and comes out delicious every time.  I've made this at least 5 times so far and will be making it again and again.  I have one in the oven right now.  I didn't change a thing.

Followed recipe exactly, except shortened the time because I had a two-pound roast. My husband and kids loved it! My husband said he couldn't get beef roast that tasted that good at a restaurant. The meat was so tender. Almost fell apart when we sliced it. Cooked in my Le Creuset dutch oven. Will definitely make again!

This was great.  Every bit was eaten.  I didn't change anything.  But the only problem I had was I didn't know exactly how big my chuck roast was (how much it weighed).  So I cooked it for 2.5 hours - looked like a hunk of leather.  Cooked it for another 30 minutes... not much change.  Cooked it for another 30 minutes and FINALLY - falling apart and delicious!  I put a little bouillon in the juice with Wondera to thicken it and that was great too.  Served it with a salad and mashed potatoes and everyone cleaned their plate.  Will definitely make it again!

I'm not sure I have ever left a review on Allrecipes, even though I use it a lot.  This is the exception.

My husband and son LOVED this.  My son, who has Aspergers, looked me right in the eye and said, I would eat this again...just so you know !.   I followed the directions exactly as is, and it was wonderful!  I plan to make it when I visit my mom next week.  I will be loved!!!

Well it wasn't bad. But....
It is so great that the recipes allow for servings size. From #1 on. However the technique doesn't. And that's where the problem lies. I adjusted the recipe to accommodate my family size great. But the cooking time.. Totally off. 4lbs of meat doesn't cook in the same amount of time as a 10lb. But nice taste

I didn't have bay leaves but it came out wonderfully. My roast was 3.45lbs and was ready after 1.25 hours total. I added carrots and portobello mushrooms during the final 45 minutes. Perfect!

excellent as is.  i only had a 2 lb roast and I did 30 min at 325 and 30 min at 300.  though it was overcooked, the flavours were excellent and the gravy that it made saved the meat anyway.  i'd make this again and simply cook it less.

2nd attempt: 2.5 lb roast.  I seared the roast on all the sides and then put it in the oven at 300 degrees for 38 min (15 min per pound of beef).  The beef was 146 degrees using a meat thermometer when  I removed it from the oven.  Let it rest for 15 min while I roasted some veggies on the BBQ.  Meat was medium

Thank you to all the reviewers who made the recipe AS WRITTEN and then encouraged others to do the same!  We were very happy with both the flavor and tenderness of the roast.  For company, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a roaster.   From now on,  I'll make it the day ahead (as Teresa suggests) because it's easier to skim off the fat and I can cut the roast into serving pieces before serving. Thanks for the recipe!

This came out perfect. Just the way roast beef should be. I fixed roasted carrots and potato separate after the roast came out of oven I made a fabulous gravy with the pan drippings and halved it to add mushrooms to some. Also warmed some sweet little jarred onions, and finished off with Chocolate Pudding for dessert. Perfect and so simple. Happy Valentines Day.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was the best roast I've ever tasted. The recipe didn't call for any fancy ingredient or 16 pots and pans. It was delicious and since my local market had a "buy one get one free", I'm making it again tonight.

Recipe was great! Mine was only 2 pounds so I cooked it at 325 degrees for 25 mins and then at 300 degrees for 45 mins. I could have cooked it for even less time for the size, but was still good. This was my first attempt making a pot roast and my first time using a Dutch oven, so this recipe is good for newbie cooks. And the drippings made a great gravy!!!

I seasoned the roast with salt and pepper before searing. I also added mushrooms and 1/2 a teaspoon of dried thyme before throwing it in the oven. served it over some mashed potatoes and it was amazing.

Beef was dr. The gravy was thin and oily, added boullion cube and cornstarch to thicken. The flavor was there but I think it needed less cooking time - will try different recipe next time.

This was amazing.  I used 2 chuck roasts that looked more like very thick steaks. I paired it with the Savory Roast Root vegetables and the flavors were perfect and danced in your mouth! I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I absolutely loved this. Followed recipe except for adding baby carrots. It was awesome! Served with mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans along with the delicious carrots I added to the roast. It was very tender and very tasty. The only thing that could have made it better, was if I had made homemade rolls. Make this, and enjoy!

I followed the recipe carefully including getting my chuck from Whole Foods, but it came out dry.   The sauce was delicious though.  I think the meat was too lean.  The last time I made pot roasts was 30 years ago and the meat had much more fat and always came out juicy and falling apart tender no matter how long I cooked it.  Sigh!

This was decent and very easy and moist but lacked in flavor. It would taste very good with worcestershire sauce or A1 sauce. It also works well with other meat cuts.

It was certainly simple and easy. The gravy from the drippings was tasty but the roast was just a chunk of meat.  It wasn't completely tasteless but it needed a heck of a lot more flavor.  The family thought that we wasted a good piece of meat that could have been slow cooked in a wine or some other sauce. It reminded me of the roasts my parent's used to make for Sunday dinner quite often.  My father was a pretty good cook, however, his roast cooking lacked a little something.  This recipe is alright if you like your meat simple, solid, and there.

I had a little over 2 lbs of the Beef Chuck Roast. I did what one reviewer said which I added a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce and about 1/4 cup red wire. It turned out great! While the roast was resting, I added about 1/2 cup of beef broth and one teaspoon (in 1/4 cup water) into the pot. The gravy was great and just enough for the mash potatoes and beef. My hubby loved it. Will make this again. So easy.

First time making a pot roast with such simple ingredients.  I cooked the onions, bay leaf, and other ingredients prior to searing the meat. Then seared the meat and put all the mixed ingredients after I took off the meat.  The meat came out soooo soft and moist.  It was delicious and my husband and kids loved it.  Best meal ever!

Made it tonight. It was a pretty basic recipe. I followed & have to agree with some of the other raters, it needed more, POW of something. Seasoning was lost, & yes, I too think wine would of been good in the pan as it baked.

This recipe was just okay. I doubled the onion and the garlic and I'm really happy I did because I think the meat and gravy would have been way too bland without it. The meat was a little dry but not terrible. The gravy really helped with the dry meat. I think there was a good amount of gravy for the amount of meat. I'd use this recipe again as a guide, but I'll make quite a few changes. I'll definitely add some rosemary, and maybe a few other spices, maybe 1/4 c or more red wine to deglaze the bottom of the pan which will help make more gravy, keep the onion and garlic doubled, and let it cook a little longer. The longer and lower it cooks, the more moist the meat will be. I'm pretty sure the meat was dry because it didn't cook quite long enough. My husband and sister really liked this recipe but they agreed it was missing something.

An excellent recipe and technique. Make it exactly as written and do not add any liquids to the pot! It comes out perfectly. If you add liquids, you're essentially boiling the meat, so it will become tough.

Meat was still dense and slightly rubbery due to not being cooked slow enough. Vegies needed a bit more time to cook too. Flavor was good.

This is excellent!  Best roast I have ever made!  I took advice and added 1/pkg of onion mushroom soup mix and I did add a can of beef broth.  I sautéed minced garlic and onions after I seared the roast and WOW!  I put it in the oven with a few mushrooms and some carrots.   Amazing and there was plenty for a gravy.  It cooked up perfectly and will be the only way to do it from now on.  Thanks Teresa!

I did not think I would ever find a pot roast recipe that I liked as much as my mom's, which uses an envelope of dried soup mix.  My husband has a MSG allergy so soup mixes and canned soup are not an option.  This recipe proves that it is possible to get the same great flavor using only natural ingredients.  I generally follow the recipe exactly, cooking the roast in a heavy, enamel-coated cast iron Dutch oven.  Fabulous every time.

I followed this to the T.  I wasn't over-the-moon about this and my family didn't rave like that have about previous dishes I have prepared but this was alright.  I could have gotten the same result by using a rub after braising the meat and then cooking it in my nuwave. It wasn't super juicy but it wasn't real dry either.

This was a great, simple meal. I did add in some basil, rosemary, parsley, and a dash of red pepper into the veggies. Cooked this at 50% power for 3 hours in my infrared oven and it came out tender, juicy, and just perfect. Loved it!

This recipe was awesome !!!  Made a mistake by diluting the soup with water but just needed to add some cornstarch & water to thicken the gravy at the end.

This was terrific and so tender.  I followed it exactly except I didn't have any bay leaves.  Even without the bay leaf it was great.  I would love to hear what others did with the remaining juices with onion in it.  Just whisk in some flour?  I've never been a gravy-making girl.

This is the first time I made pot roast and it was great. My stepson never likes my cooking very much but ate seconds tonight. I added carrots and potatoes. I also added half a can of beef broth. It was delicious.

I made this recipe last week and it was a big hit. As others have stated it is important to sear each side for four minutes to seal in the juices. I did added some beef broth and sweet vermouth to the dutch oven after searing it to deglaze and give me a nice gravy. My family loved it and is now requesting it again this week.

Sper taste, super easy.  My 4lb chuck roast took longer to cook; I finally pulled it out at about 2 hours at the second temp, but I had bumped the temp to 325 degrees 30 minutes before, too.  The onion "gravy" smelled so good so I am going to purée it down and use it for another recipe.

This was delicious exactly as the recipe says! Use a Dutch oven!!! It was dry after 3 hours so I added a quarter cup more red wine and a quarter cup more water!  Next time I will add more wine/water at the beginning I think because the sauce is delicious!  everything turned out amazing!! All of my boys LOVED it!  "this is a keeper, mom!" is what I heard 3 times!! Thank you for sharing :0)

Excellent recipe, the neat and veggies coalesce perfectly. I personally recommend more vegetables, and maybe some baby potatoes, since the recipe as stated leaves it rather meat heavy. I also pre sautéed the vegetables including the garlic in butter, came out amazing.

Sorry, I have to be one of the few that give this a low rating.  I read all of the good reviews so I decided to put it on the Thanksgiving menu instead of turkey.  I followed the directions to the letter and my roast was like shoe leather and dry as a bone. Back to the crock pot for me :(

Not the worst thing I've ever eaten but it's not that far behind.... I followed the recipe to the letter and am very disappointed. The meat was dry, even with gravy, and it had absolutely no flavor. Not something I will ever make again.  Bummed.......

This was great for slicing, and so easy. I let it rest more than 15 minutes and we didn't need or want the gravy. Served it with mashed potatoes and fresh garden grown green beans. Yum!

Ok so I never write reviews, always mean to, but sometimes, there aren't enough hours in the day! But I finished this roast nice and early, got it served and it was devoured in no time flat! My gang is not picky, but beef - roasts in particular - well, just one of those things that always end up with a ton of flavor but just never tender enough. Not this time! I followed the directions - well, almost to a T - because of some of the reviews, I added stock and because we love mushrooms, added those too. YUMMMMM!!!! My family is now asking me to tackle steak. Just another one of those that stump me!  Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!! We will use this one often :)

I made this tonight, my first pot roast and it was really good!  I did as a lot of reviewers suggested and didn't change the recipe except for replacing the bay leaf with some Italian seasoning and parsley (because my husband doesn't like bay leaves).  It was so good for a chuck roast and I just took the pan right out of the oven took the roast out to rest and heated up the juice/onions/garlic till it was boiling and added some flour water to make a gravy.  Very good, I'll be making this again :).

This recipe is WONDERFUL.  My husband really like this recipe. It is very moist and tender and did I say wonderful. I think it would be great if it had mushrooms but it is really good as it is.  Didn't change a thing and followed the recipe to the tee.  I love gravy and this gravy was awesome.   Thanks Teresa!

I've made this pot roast three different times. The first was low and slow and followed the recipe to a T. If you are looking for a roast that purely celebrates the meat than this is the way to do it. Plus doing it low and slow at 225 for 3.5 or 4 hours made it so tender and flakey like a fish. But for  me I needed a little more flavor so the second time I did it low and slow again but added 3 or so more garlic cloves, carrots, potatoes and about 1 1/2 cups of white wine and 2 or so cups of water. I also seasoned the meat after searing with garlic powder,onion powder and S & P.  this is the way I liked it best and just to warn you, I cooked it a third time exactly the same as the second except with beef broth instead of water but my roast was 2.95 lbs and I was short on time so I cooked it as the recipe stated and it was SO dry. I mean it was DRY DRY but the flavor was still there so warning to all: if your roast weighs less than what the recipe calls for and you aren't cooking it low and slow, check it after about an hour once you drop the temp.  I still think low and slow is by far THE best way

This recipe is awesome. My husband and kids loved it. My 5 year old kept saying this is the best dinner ever. I followed the recipe exactly except I added carrots and potatoes. It turned out very tender and delicious. I will defiantly make this again.

I forgot to review the first time I made this a couple of months ago! Since there are only the two of us I froze the leftovers and had two more meals! So I decided today I wanted this again, fortunately I was already on my way to the grocery store. Just want to say like a number of other reviewers, follow the recipe exactly!! I did, with some doubt, and it was perfect. So I'm doing it again today!

A crowd pleaser at our house.  Very simple but tasty.  For 4 servings, I cut the meat to 2 pounds, but still used the full onion and 2 bay leaves.  For the oven step,  I added 1 cup of liquid (1/2 water, 1/2 red wine).  Using a Le Creuset, I cut the cooking time to 30 minutes. To absorb the gravy, I mixed in boiled potatoes and carrots at the end of cooking.  Yummy.  I'll be making this again.

Came out very tough.  Followed the directions.  Seared and roasted in an enameled iron French oven. My roast was smaller so I cut back the cooking time and  used a meat thermometer as well so I know it wasn't overcooked.  This recipe was tough to cut through.  Giving 3 stars instead of 1 in case the size of the roast would make a difference.

This recipe is terrific as written.... Please don't add water... I only cooked a 1.5 lb Chuck Roast and there was 3/4 cup of liquid at the bottom of the pan after it cooked.... I too was sick of stringy, flavorless chuck roast from the crock pot! This new bride is sold on searing:)

Excellent AND simple.  The first time I made this I (accidently) didn't cover the pan....it was a little overcooked  but still very good. It tasted even better the second day.  I think it's hard to mess up chuck roast but I like mine done by this method better than the crockpot.  Crock timing can be vague  and I always think it has a dry quality to it, even cooked on LOW.  The precise timing of this is easier for me.  Thank you Teresa for a great go-to recipe.  AMH

Wow! I have a very picky daughter who said this is a "keeper" recipe. I seared in butter to give it that extra flavor, plus used Angus beef. Oh, I also put it into the slow cooker all day on low.

This is the BEST recipe! It is the only way I make roast beef now. It is also the seasonings I use to make beef stock out of other cuts of beef. It makes a wonderful gravy and is great with yorkshire pudding!

The recipe is super easy and the taste is yummy...however--the only problem I had (and I followed the recipe to the T, as I seem to have issues with cooking pot roasts on my own), was that it was rather overdone. I don't like my beef to "moo" at me (ha!), but this was a little more well done than I normally like it. I will make it again, but will cut some of the time off.

I used asparagus and red peppers for the vegetables because we eat minimal high starch b/c of the high rate of conversion on sugar in our bodies which causes inflammation. This dish was excellent!

Very good!  I usually just plunk a pot roast in the crockpot and let it stew all day, but I wanted something a little more traditional this time around.  Yum!  It came out nice and tender, and with plenty of accompanying juices/gravy.  Will be making again!!

My roast was 3.8 pounds and I followed everything except that I also added 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix with the salt and pepper.  Very tasty and plenty of liquid.  However, it wasn't tender at all.  If you are looking for shred-if-you-look-at-it pot roast, this is NOT it. My husband and I both preferred Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Maries-Easy-Slow-Cooker-Pot-Roast/Detail.aspx?prop31=4

This was great! I didn't use any extra liquids and since I had a 3 lb roast I cooked it for 2 hours instead of 1 1/2 on 300 degrees. Again, great recipe.

This was EXCELLENT. I followed the recipe as written, except I did add carrots after turning the heat to 300. I used a large cast iron dutch oven but next time will try my smaller Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker. This was seriously so delicious. I used a white onion and usually never eat the onions in pot roast but these were sooo good! I actually drank the gravy from the bowl because it was irresistible. Oh yum.

Great recipe!! And easy!  Made just as directed and agree with some of the other comments to not be tempted to add any extra liquid. I used a covered cast iron pot, and a tight fitting lid and following the recipe will give you the best pot roast ever with plenty of beefy broth to make gravy or to add noodles.  Made early in the day and reheated for dinner.  Fork tender and delicious.

Very good basic start. Moist soft fall-apart meat - tasty. Vegetable cooked just right.  Perfect for a winter day.  I would suggest really taking note of some of the add-on from the comments left - they will only make it EVEN BETTER.

I used this recipe to make my first pot roast and it turned out great! I took the advice from other reviews and added 2 cups of beef broth. It was so tender and moist! I'll definitely be making it again!

Very easy, good recipe for beef roast.  I added some beef broth and would reduce the amount of bay leaves (just my preference).  I made some extra gravy with beef broth (low sodium) and dry onion soup mix and extra seasonings and then served this over the left over beef that I sliced thin and served on a good whole grain bread!  Yummy.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Perfect.  Easy.  Delicious.  Make the recipe exactly as written.  The gravy is thin but not greasy, and extremely flavorful.  I've found my HG pot roast recipe.

Came out pretty tender. I followed the recipe except added some potatoes, that was a bad idea, the potatoes soaked up the pepper...they were the spiciest potatoes I've ever made. Other than that the roast was pretty good.

I added 2 cups of beef broth and a handful of carrots to the roasting pan, but other than that, followed the recipe.  I had a 2.5 pound roast and it cooked for an hour and a half and was pretty rare.  Pretty good, I'll probably make it again.

The only thing that I would add is, when you return the meat to the pan with veggies, drop in about 2-3 ounces of sherry, it comes out fantastic!

just ok, mine came out kind of dry and over cooked.  but the onion gravy from the juices was wonderful.  I think if it was done by temperature instead of time it would have come out better.

This was good.  Not fantastic, but good & very easy.  Only change:  I added some beef broth. 

Mine needed about an hour longer than the instructions said.  If I had taken it out at the time in the instructions, the meat would have been very tough.

Good, tender roast. I stuffed some garlic slivers in the meat before searing, and added about half a cup of beef broth, some carrots, diced potatoes, and onion wedges.
