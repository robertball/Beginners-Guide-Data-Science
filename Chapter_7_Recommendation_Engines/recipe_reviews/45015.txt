This is just a note to others making this pie.  I make a similar pie with peaches...and the best way to not have the pie stick to the plate is to line the pie plate with foil.  Then coat the foil with a little butter before putting the caramel topping down.  This saves a sticky pie pan and can prevent the pie from bubbling over as well.  :)

Overall this is a good recipe.  However, the baking time was about 15 minutes too long.  Had I left it as long as recommended, I would have totally burnt the pie.  Also I would add way more apples next time.  This ended up being a rather hollow pie when inverted.  I would make this again though, just taking into considerations the above.

This recipe looks just like one that my husband has been forever singing the praises of. He used to have something just like this at a restaurant that went out of business - so I'll try this and see how it turns out. Looks delicious - thanks Donna!

This was very delicious, but I encountered a few problems in the making.  When flipped upside-down, all the caramel and bottom pie crust got left behind, stuck to the pie plate.  Next time I make this, I'll double the batch of caramel, and spray the pie plate with cooking spray.

I would say to all the people having problems with the bottom almost burning or overcooking/sticking to pan, I had the same problem, but I am sure it's because I melted the margarine in the pie plate before putting the pie together.  I attributed the problem to the plate starting out warm and thus getting the bottom ingredients too warm to begin with.  Melt the margarine in a separate dish and then mix it in a cold pie plate and continue with directions.  I think you'll have better luck.

What a delicious pie!  I'm anxious to make it again.  Next time I will remember to place it on a cookie sheet to save oven clean up and plan for a shorter baking time.

I used to make this very pie, but lost the recipe. My husband has been begging me to try it again and I think I've found it. I used nut topping on mine instead of pecans, so the taste was more in line with a caramel apple we are all used to. As I recall, I sprayed the bottom of the pie pan before putting in the caramel, it did help a bit with sticking. Also, I left the pan on top for a bit longer after flipping...that helped, too. THanks for posting this!

My family including myself loved the way this tasted, but mine didn't turn out very pretty. I didn't remove it from the pan until the next day. That was a big no-no. It had glued itself to the pan. I reheated the pie in the microwave and was able to remove it. I also used canned apples instead of fresh and just added a little extra cinnamon and brown sugar to them. I also only cooked it for about 35-40 mins because my crust was already golden and I didn't have to worry about the apples being done.

This taste great!! I did as another reviewer said and lined the pan with tinfoil and sprayed that with nonstick cooking spray, I didn't have a problem with sticking at all. Just make sure that you invert the pan and remove the pie while it is still warm.

As other reviews advised, this was not the best looking pie, but it sure did taste good!  I doubled the amount of 'caramel' on the bottom, and also sprayed the plate with nonstick cooking spry before adding the caramel mix.  Used my own apple pie recipe, for which there really is no recipe.  Cooked it at a lower temperature about 375.  I was excellent with vanilla ice cream!  Will be making again!

Much of the bottom crust, which becomes the top crust when inverted, stuck to the dish, along with the carmel and nuts, when I inverted it. I think what we have here is basically a novelty to try. But who needs it? Why not just bake a pie with the topping on top to start with, or added toward the end. That would correct this problem PLUS you wouldn't end up with a pie falling apart on a a serving dish with no support around the edge. Tasted okay, though it was too much brown sugar for my taste.   If I baked it again, I'd heavily butter the dish before putting down the topping, in the hope it wouldn't stick so bad the next time. And I'd switch half the brown sugar to white. And bake 40 to 50 minutes, not 50 to 60.

I used eight cups of apples. Baked in a 9" Pyrex pie plate, came out easily after five minutes' rest.

I doubled the caramel and baked on foil as reccommended by others. The pie came out fine, the foil stuck to the pie pan. I set my timer for 50 minutes, checked after 40 and the pie was a little burned, it did not taste great - burned sugar never does.

Great, easy recipe. I added one additional apple to the filling.   Be sure to put something on the base of the pan to help with removing the caramel topping and heat it up a little bit before flipping to make sure it comes off smoothly.  Only took 30-40 minutes for my pie to bake and next time I will bake it on a pan to help with the spillover from the caramel filling that happens.

This is a delicious recipe!! I've been asked to make it a few times in a month!! My family eats this like there's no tomorrow. I did make a small change, my kids suggested that I put thier favorite apple in there so I put 2 Honey Crisp Apple and 2 Granny Smith. It does change the taste, but they eat it either way. Thank you.

Overall this is a good recipe.  I did lower the temperature to 375 degrees F as my oven tends to cook to hot anyway.  Also, a somewhat shorter baking time was a must or it gets too brown.

Oh, and be sure to not leave in the pan to cool for longer than 5 minutes.

No, it's not that pretty, but vanilla ice cream on top will fix that!

I tried this pie again and inverting it (after Greasing!!) made it look horribly ugly. I added more caramel also. The taste was excellent, but it is too ugly. I am going to try this again by cooking the caramel in a pot and drizzling over the pie afterwards, I think it will look much better, and be easier to handle. Thanks for the idea though! oh, and I didnt use pecans

The time was way too long and the temperature WAY too high for this recipe.  I almost burnt it and it is currently fused to my pie pan, not sure if I will ever get it clean again.  I did like the idea of the pecans and would add them to apple pie in the future.

This was very tasty pie. The only problem was that we couldn't get the thing to invert out of the pie pan. So we just served it like regular pie. Still very good.

I think I'll stick with plain old apple pie next time.  The pie crust dough (bottom layer that went over the brown sugar pecan mixture) didn't seem cooked enough.  Too doughy when inverted.
