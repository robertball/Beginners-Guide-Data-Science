Did the submitor forget a few ingredients? First of all, it's hard enough trying to cram 5 cups of flour into 1 cup of water, and the result is a very chalky loaf, and wasted rye flour. Also, shouldn't there be some other flour with it, you know, for gluten?

Exactly how Russian black bread should be.  I used all of the rye flour and it came together easily.  This bread does not rise very high.  It is heavy and dense. Slice very thin, butter and eat with a nice bowl of soup.  My mom used to buy this same bread in the deli.

Very heavy bread, with delicious flavour.  At first I thought that the flour/water ratio was off too, but I just kept kneading the flour in until I had the right consistency (not all 5 cups went in.

I did not cook it, but maybe the others have not been in Russia and eaten Russian bread. It sounds how it should be!!!

This recipe does not work at all. The flour to water ratio doesn't make sense and results a rock that won't rise at all.

It's what black bread (cherniy xleb) is supposed to taste like. Those who are insulting the recipe have clearly NEVER had actual Russian black bread. It's nothing like white bread, and it's not supposed to be like it!! Great with butter, served with a side of pickles and vodka. :)

Very dense, heavy, strong flavored bread. Not quite what one's taste is used to after the years of "fluff" breads from the commercial bakeries.

This is not a bad recipe. Better than most, but you have to use sourdough to raise a pure rye bread. Do that and you will get a pretty fair American-Russian black bread.
