He mentions in the video that the classic proportions are 3 oz tequila, 2 oz triple-sec, 1 oz lime juice. So I want to try that against this recipe.

This is a very strong margarita recipe. Cointreau is the better choice but it is expensive. Other triple sec is much cheaper and still makes a darn good margarita. You can make it more posh by rimming the glass with Himalayan pink salt. Make this and avoid the nasty neon green mixes.

Didn't have access to high end tequila or triple sec but still very good(well......I did add a little more salt to lessen the bite)

I skipped salting and freezing the glass.   
Will do that next time.  Used Cointreau and gold tequila because I didn't have white tequila.    Thank you!
