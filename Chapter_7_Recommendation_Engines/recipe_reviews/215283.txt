I come from asian back ground. To get the best out of this recipe you must use a tea spoon of turmeric, not a table spoon.

Delicious....though a bit spicy for our taste.  Next time we'll reduce the cayenne pepper.  Would be great with rice as well.

I've used all these spices before, but never with yogurt.   Tried to heat the marinade with oil & water and the whole thing just separated due to the yogurt curdling.

These had a flavor that just did not suit us.  I have had turmeric in other dishes, but not in such a concentration and perhaps that was the problem.  Thank you for the recipe, but I will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe to the letter....but instead of pita bread we used tortillas to make them wraps....WOW. My girlfriend is a picky eater and gobbled these up like they were going out of style. I will for sure be making this again.

I believe this could use some retouching.  The yogurt did not serve as a good base and the flavor was not intense enough for us.
