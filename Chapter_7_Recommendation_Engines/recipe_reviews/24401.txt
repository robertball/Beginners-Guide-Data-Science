The recipe might be very good, but unfortunately doesn't fit the name. Being a Hungarian, I've been born and raised on this food, and this recipe is more likely to be called paprika potatoes. Lecso never has any potatoes nor spaghetti sauce in it, you might stir in eggs or rice for additional thickness. Sadly a very altered recipe, far from original!

It is quite a good recipe. I have to protest though; it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the real Hungarian lecsó, which is a completely differnt dish. It has many variations in Hungary, but NONE with potatoe and garlic!!! ( I recommend a look into a Hungarian cook book!)

This is a dish my mom used to make in Poland. She did not use the potatoes and used 3 colour pepper (yellow,, red and green) then served it warm with black rye bread and butter. 
I like this variation and so do my kids. Easy and fast to prepare.

This was FANTASTIC!  A soup that eats like a meal.  I got stuck with Idaho potatoes instead of new potatoes but they tasted good too. I didn't have any fresh garlic.  I didn't cook it for very long so the vegetable were a little firm which made it seem like a meal.  Ymmmy!  I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious! Great on a cold winter's night. We had it with salad and black bread and there were no leftovers. Even my 2 year old ate it. Will definitely keep this in my file.

A hearty and easy recipe.  Try cajun flavored smoked sausage for an extra kick!

Ever have the most perfect recipe come up when using the ingredient search?  This is mine...  Overall very good - it did need salt and pepper though and a little longer to cook to blend flavors and to soften the poatoes.   Very hearty and healthy (used chicken sausage) on a cold evening!  Thanks for sharing!  Oh and PS for everyone who gave it bad reviews saying it's not authentic... the submitter never claims it's authentic - they say it's been "americanized" meaning adapted.  I appreciate this interpretation!

The is-it-or-isn't-it-traditional-Lecso reviews didn't affect my taste buds, as I didn't have anything to compare this recipe too. (I had the ingredients on hand and wanted an easy crock meal for a chilly night.) I don't think my following changes would affect the integrity of the original recipe. I browned the smoked sausage in a little EVOO w/ the garlic, onion, and bell peppers, and then dumped everything in the crock pot for 8 hrs on low. I used about 2 c. of homemade spaghetti sauce and 1 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos for some extra kick. (Truth by told, I can't recall ever seeing stewed tomatoes packed in a mere 8 oz. can.) It was the perfect consistency for dragging hunks of french bread through.

despite the dialog regarding the authenticity of this recipe, it is a good, basic cold weather meal. It is easy and quick to prepare. My only change would be to use a more spicy pasta sauce or some red pepper flakes for a little 'kick' as the tomato taste is a little strong for my taste.  Overall it is a keeper.  Thanks.

All that complaining about it being authentic didn't mean anything to us, we had nothing to compare it to. The bottom line is if you are looking for a recipe to use these ingredients in, this is the one. My son LOVED this and he is pretty picky.  My husband said it was okay. He could take it or leave it. It was okay for me.

This was very good, but didn't have enough sauce for us, so I simply used a 24oz can of spaghetti sauce and added 1/2 cup of water.

This was very good.  Wonderful on a cold night.  This recipe is very similar to all the other Hungarian Lesco recipes, with the exception of the jar spaghetti sauce.  The other recipes refer to it as a condiment and served over rice and noodles whereby this is stew-like.

Used sweet potatoes instead of new, Hungarian sausage, and a double dose of smoked paprika... turned out fantastic!

Very good recipe. I have made this about 5 or 6 times now and I usually follow the recipe as is I just add in a few pinches of salt and pepper. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect as it is. Very flavorful and tasty. Thanks for sharing with us. Also, someone mentioned it has nothing to do with real Hungarian. Just wanted to kindly point out that it does state above that the dish has been Americanized.

Very easy; not bad in a pinch. I used 4 tbsp butter instead of 1. Sauteed potatoes and garlic for about 10 mins on medium high. I used angus beef smoked sausage as well.

A little sweet for my taste, so I juiced it up with some hot sauce. But that's just me.

Good recipe! It took longer than 20 min for my potatoes to be cooked.  I used Al Freso roasted pepper and asiago chicken sausage, and used jalapeños instead of green peppers.  Also used green onion instead of white.  Will make again!

Should it still hurt me after all these years that there is that one unkind review that slams the authenticity of my grandmother's recipe?  It shouldn't, but it does.  I am glad that so many people enjoy it, though.  

And for the record, I visited my Hungarian Jewish cousins (direct from Budapest) a few months ago and they do almost the same recipe except for the potatoes.  :)

And yes, that's my submission.  I have a new account now that I'm married. :)

I changed it a bit. I used 3 medium sized tomatoes and about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce instead of the jar of tomato sauce and can of tomatoes. I also added rice to it. It turned out great. However, it isn't the traditional lecso that I'm used to.

This was very good and easy to make. The only changes I made was I substituted stewed tomatoes with diced ones because I didn't have stewed ones.   Next time I make this (and I will) I'm going to add a little more water because it was a little too pasty for our taste, and maybe a teaspoon or so of salt.   Thanks for submitting this.

This was a very satisfying meal. It tastes great and is very healthy. My 19th month old even loved it! I used hungarian and chorizo sausages since that is what I had on hand.

A most excellent recipe for Snickerdoodles! The 1/2 & 1/2 with the fats still leaves the buttery taste, but allows the shortening (which has a higher melting point) to keep the cookie up longer in the oven. My wife prefers these with just sugar, I enjoy the cinnamon added.

I tried this recipe mainly because I had all the ingredients on hand, but it was a bit of a disappointment.  It never seemed to "come together" -- perhaps a longer cooking time or a slow bake in the oven would have improved it.  It just tasted exactly like the individual ingredients that went into it.
