To those reviewers who had problems with the proportions I can tell you that I've been baking a similar recipe for years that calls for baking the bars in a 9x13" pan. My filling calls for 1 lb dates, 2/3c. brown sugar, 2/3c. orange juice, 1tsp vanilla extract & 1Tbs lemon juice. I also puree the filling in the processor. The oatmeal mixture calls for 1 1/2c rolled oats, 1 1/2c flour, 1c brown sugar, 1/2tsp baking soda & 2 sticks butter.Pat half of mixture in a greased 9x13"pan, spread with filling and top with remaining oatmeal mixture. It's important to press this top mixture slightly into the filling before baking. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes. Don't give up because this is a wonderful recipe.

My husband is from Canada where date bars are a staple, and he loved this.  I cut the flour from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups, the brown sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup, used butter vs. shortening, and used a 9x13 pan.  Excellent!

These bars are awesome!  The only problem is that they don't last long in the house.  These bars are quite fattening so I tried using half the amount of shortening by substituting applesauce in its place and they were still just as awesome!  I might try eliminating the shortening altogether.

This recipe seems to have a lot of issues going on as I noticed by the reviews. But I just halved the recipe to use up some dates and it went fairly well. Next time I would use more dates in order to make more filling, and probably would of followed more of the review suggestions in order to made the topping/crust more cohesive. All-in-all it was yummy, though crumbly as other people have noticed.

I made this at the request of my father for Christmas and they came out great!! I pretty much followed the directions except I used butter instead of shortening and I omitted a half cup of flour because I was concerned about the past reviews of the bars being too crumbly..but they came out great!!I also used a 9x13 pan, which was perfect..there would have been WAY too much for a 9x9 pan. My dad hasn't tasted them yet, but I hope he enjoys them! Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now. It is so darn delicious.  I have over time though, adjusted the amounts of some of the ingredients. I double the date filling and I use about an extra 1/2 cup of shortening for the oats so that it's not as dry. It's so much like date crisp. Excellent with traditional vanilla ice cream.

I was trying desperately to get rid of some leftover dates from a fruit basket, and this recipe worked nicely! The crust mixture was rather crumbly, but the crumbles tasted so good that I used them as a pudding topping. I don't think it would hold up well for cookie baskets and such, though. The only alteration I made was to use butter-flavored shortening. I will definitely make this tasty recipe again!

This bar was soooo dry that when you cut it all that came out of the pan was the date filling.    All of the oatmeal mixture just fell away.

Made these for a Palm Sunday coffee hour and they were a hit.  I just made sure to press the oatmeal layers with wax paper and everything held together very well.

It was all pretty good, but I did have to add extra butter to make it stick together better.  Also the portions are off, next time I would at least double the date filling part.

Absolutely delicious...this one will be a winner in my Christmas Gift Boxes this year.  I did take the suggestion of baking in a larger pan because of the volume of crust crumbs and date filling.  I baked in a 11 X 15 roaster to which I lines with heavy duty foil to lift out and cut easier.  Worked like a charm and cookies were a nice depth with plenty of filling.  Definitely a 5 star recipe!!

There's nothing crunchy about the oatmeal layers on this cookie.  It's doughy and floury and yucky.  I measured both the flour and oatmeal in scant measurements and added about 2 tbsp extra butter because of previous reviews.  But it came out dry and very crumbly anyway.  Not good.  Not good at all.

These were very good, although crumbly.  I think they need more filling or less crumb mixture.  I will make them again and maybe double the amount of date filling. I also added vanilla to the filling.

To me, this recipe is way to sweet with all the brown sugar. The crust portion was good. I couldn't get all this into a 9" square pan. I used a 9 x 13" pan and it was plenty full even with the mess made transferring it, the bars over an inch high. There are better recipes for these bars and I won't be making it again.

Really good flavor.  But should have read the reviews first.  I followed the directions and ended up not with date bars but with date crumble.  Really floury and  crumbly and still not totally done even though I baked it 33 minutes instead of the recommended 20-25.  And WAAAAY too much recipe for a 9x9!!  But mine will still be really good served with vanilla ice cream.

the recipe should call out for quick cooked oats not rolled oats.  To much flour, and to much oats, made to much for the recipe.

Just made this recipe and am VERY disappointed.  Much too crumbly and the dates have no taste.  I would change from shortening to butter and add vanilla extract.

Very good flavor, although, next time I will cut the topping in half, there was just too much in comparison to the date filling, I don't think there is enough date filling to stretch this to a 9x13 pan.

I've made these twice, with the recommendations posted by Shooga.  The second time I didn't have orange juice, and I have to say I like the filling much better with the oj/lemon juice added--it has more flavor.  I used quick oats with good effect.  And if you forget to press the top crumb layer into the filling, you can do it halfway through cooking.

I used the modified recipe posted by SHOOGA and it was undoubtedly the best bar cookie recipe ever = I used DOLE orange/strawberry/banana juice instead of regular orange juice and added cinnamon to the cookie base. I also plan to experiment w/using some different "rehydrated" dried fruits in place of half the dates, also different juice blends.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  They didn't really seem cooked even though I left them in way longer than directed.  I guess I thought cooking them would reduce the crumbling and somehow bind it all together, but the oatmeal crust was VERY crumbley.  I would say you could half the amt of the mixter used to make the crust.  Even so, I don't think they would have turned out well.

I tried a very similar recipe from another Website, and was so disappointed with the results .... I found this recipe, read the reviews, and followed Shooga's suggestions for adjusting ingredients and pan size.  My husband wanted date-nut bars, so I also cut back a little on the oats and added some finely chopped walnuts.  The family really enjoyed the adjusted recipe at Christmas. The bars are a bit sweet for my taste; I might use less sugar in the filling next time.  Thank you, Shooga, for some really good advice.

Imade it in a 9x13 pan and it was delicious. It only gets 4 because half of the topping didn't stick and ended up as an oatmeal mess in the pan.

This recipe did not work at all. It was a dry crumbly mess!  Upon review of the recipe my mom said she thought there is an error in the amount of flour needed.  Could it be 2 TBSP instead of 2 cups?  What a waste of ingredients.

It appears the ratios are wrong.  There is too much topping for the amount of dates.  We ended up scraping off a lot of topping  to enjoy,  The crumble was dry.   The fruit inside is amazing though!!!  We will keep looking.

My "go to" for making Date Bars.  My Mom would make them for me for Christmas.  I learned from her most of my baking skills.

I modified this recipe, both accidently and purposefully.  I put twice as much sugar in the date filling unintentionally, and that worked out fine for the sweet tooths in the family;  I substituted a cup of oatmeal for a cup of the flour to help lower the carbs.  (Okay, a total moot point with the extra sugar - and datesin general.).   We have come to like all our crisps and crumbles with more oatmeal and less flour.  I loved this recipe; it tasted like mom's-though I need to add walnuts to the date filling for the mom-replica.  I would make it again tomorrow if  the carb watchers would agree.

I found that there was too much crust and it was way too dry and crumbly.  I followed the recipe as written.  Never thought it would be that dry using a whole cup of shortening.  I should have read the reviews and taken their advice on changes like pan size and amounts.

Very good.  I have been craving date bars and looking for a good recipe.  I made two little modifications: used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortning in the crust and melted it before adding it to the flour/oatmeal mixture.. I also used a 9X13 pan. Next time I might add just a little more butter. I pressed the top firmly but I think a little more butter would help it brown just a little more.  These are not too sweet and are just what I was looking for. Yum!

lacked taste. Didn't look so good as far as presentation goes.  I added chopped pecans on top but they wouldn't stick, so all just fell off.

The recipe is BROKEN.  It does not work.  The crumble is way too much and a total mess...The recipe needs to be rewritten to get 5 stars.

The filling was "OK" but the "crunchy layers" were a pile of flour and oatmeal that neither browned or turned crunchy.  I tipped the pan and most of it fell of into the sink after I had cooked it for an extra 15 minutes.

This didn't work for me. The flour/oat mixture was entirely too crumbly. The Betty Crocker recipe I checked later called for quick cooking oats, I used the 5 minute kind. The taste was fine, so we just ate it as a kind of "crumble" with ice cream.

With a few tweaks these come out amazing. Here's what I changed: For a 9" square pan (or an 8" like I used) keep the ingredients for the filling unchanged but cut the crust in half (1 1/2 cups oats, 1 cup flour etc). Also I did not measure the shortening but rather cut in shortening with a fork until the batter had enough cohesion to form the base layer but was still crumbly. I pressed the top layer of crust gently into the filling with a fork. These will hold together much better if you refrigerate them overnight before cutting them.

Great recipe. Per some of the other commenter's recommendations, I cut the amount of fat and flour, and used butter instead of shortening. I took one star off for sweetness. I usually like things less sweet than others so I put only about 30% of the sugar called for in, but it was still too much. Dates are extremely sweet fruits already, there's no need to add more sugar to the filling (or crust). Next time I'll cut all the added sugar.

I used less flour and oats but I still didn't achieve the consistency I was looking for. Still a good recipe and satisfied my date square craving.

Very good recipe. I did read the reviews before making this recipe, and as a result I made the following changes:  added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the date mixture and pureed the date mixture.  I also used a 9 x 13 inch pan.  The result was great, and my husband loved them, which is ALWAYS my true test of a winning recipe.  Thanks.

This is my family's all-time favorite date recipe.  I was delighted to find it online!  (Especiallyl since I promised it to my family this morning and couldn't find my cookie cookbook when I got home.  Thank you Allrecipe.com for saving me.
