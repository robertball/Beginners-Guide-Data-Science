Not exactly Paleo because of the dairy (sour cream and cheese), but you can omit those. Otherwise a good dish.

The spices in this recipe were excellent, full of flavor with out being overly hot. The sour cream and salsa mixed together makes a tasty layer in this salad.

I made this tonight for my wife and I. We've been trying quite a few paleo recipes and I thought this sounded good... and easy to prepare. I wanted to stay away from other taco salad recipes, that use Catalina dressing. While I'm sure it's good, we are avoiding, what you might consider prepared foods. This taco salad recipe was outstanding. The seasoning mix added just the right amount of taste and heat to the ground beef. I tasted it before adding it to the browned ground beef, to make sure. The mixture of salsa and sour cream was also tasty. I will make this again in the future.

Such a great recipe on its own...  I give a 5 star rating, but like most recipes, I tweak it for my taste.  One thing I love to do on taco salad night is add finely diced red peppers in with the meat.  I cook half in at the start then the other half of red pepper near the end for a more crunchy pep.  On the bed of romaine I toss in diced cucumber.  While dairy isn't considered paleo, I still consume it...  I mean, c'mon, it's sour cream....  I can bathe in it!!  And cheese...  I'd be a cheesy crybaby without it!

I actually loved this recipe. The seasoning was fabulous and not very salty. Instead of sour cream and salsa, I used avocado, yellow peppers, tomatoes, and feta cheese in a salad. I tried to make paleo tortillas, but that turned out to be a mess from hell. My only dilemma with this recipe was I replaced the beef with chicken... do not replace the beef with chicken... It gave the meat a slightly grainy texture and the seasoning did not mix well, making it a bit overwhelming. USE BEEF!

Some people opt for a little dairy on a paleo diet, especially butter. I think it is more of a grey area than a hard rule. This recipe is very much like the taco salad recipe I have always made and loved, but I never thought of adding lime to the salsa/sour cream dressing. It was a nice touch. My seasonings are more complicated but this was just as good, and I liked the cooked onion over raw. Thanks

Not paleo, but can be considered "primal" because of the dairy. I added 1cup of water and simmered for 20 mins, to let the flavouring set into the meat and not be so gritty. I would make again.

Very yummy but not totally paleo so I substituted kite hill unsweetened almond milk yogurt for the sour cream, turned out great! Also used So Delicious dairy free Cheddar shreds.

The dressing it was a bit weird and I'm not sure I would make it again this way.  The flavoring tasted mostly like chili powder to me but my SO liked it.

Made them without the cheese and sour cream. The family loved them. Will make them again, just not so spicy.

Holy cow this is good! And so fast! It's perfect and the only thing I changed was added a lot more garlic cloves.
