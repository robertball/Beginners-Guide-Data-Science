I loved these doughnuts. They were easy to make and I loved the fact the doughnuts were baked instead of fried.

The only possible reason these could be mistaken as donuts is because they are piped into that shape.  That being said, they made very delicious small cakes.  I love that you can pipe them, maybe I'll try another shape next time.

Not really a doughnut but more of a cake. Next time I would try a different recipe.

These Donuts were pretty good. The only thing is, it tasted more like cake rather than donuts. They had a good flavor though.

These are pretty tasty and my kids loved the icing on these but... they are near identical to another pumpkin recipe here on Allrecipes that is a smidge better. I'm not a huge fan of the piped doughnut. It may be because I used gluten free flour but I did not end up with a crueler looking doughnut. The batter is perfect for a doughnut pan though.

When I made it they turned out really flat, this could be due to any number of things I did (like letting the kids help measure or only having really old baking powder). However, they are delicious and super easy anyway! :)
