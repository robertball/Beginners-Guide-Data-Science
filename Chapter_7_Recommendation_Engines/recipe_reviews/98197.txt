Excellent recipe! Very easy to make and tastes delicious. The "smokey" flavor sets this dish off wonderfully. I made two small modifications because of my personal preferences -- I eased up a tad on the jalepenos and used soy bacon bits. I would never have thought to add the molasses and brown sugar but they rounded the dish off nicely giving the beans a more mellow flavor. This is a new favorite!

Instead of pickled jalapeno peppers I used a 4 oz. can of diced jalapeno peppers and it was great.

I make this recipe regularly but I rarely have the forethought to pre-soak beans.. so I just use canned black beans. It's very good!

These are great! My husband AND kids like them. I sometimes make them without the bacon and less br. sugar and they are still really good!

I like the flavor of this recipe a lot though it surprised me as I guess I was expecting something a little more southwest and it reminds me instead of Boston Baked Beans only with turtle beans. For my own preferences I cut the sugar back to a tablespoon and added chipotle en adobo and a flick of fresh chopped cilantro. I'm sure it is great over chicken but it is also wonderful with vegetarian protein substitutes like quorn.

I don't really care for black beans but Husband loves them and he didn't like this at all. The sweet/spicy/smokey flavors just don't work. I ended up throwing most of it away. Thanks anyway.

We found that this recipe lacked something in taste and ended up dumping in a very large can of baked beans to give it more flavor. We also had to add a cup of water (possibly because we're at high elevation?) so not sure if that diluted what flavor was supposed to be there; but we probably would not make this again in the future especially using dried beans.

I eat a lot of beans and grains and I get tired of the same old same old cumin/curry options! This blew me away! This is my new favorite dish when I want to make something special. I didn't have bacon but I used a cube of chicken stock for flavoring. The essential ingredients are the sugar liquid smoke and molasses. The best part is that it is one of the easiest dishes I make; I keep cooked beans in the freezer to whip it up in less than 20 minutes.

I thought the beans were too sweet. My husband didn't think they were smoky enough. All in all not a recipe I would make again.
