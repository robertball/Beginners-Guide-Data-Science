I'm rating 5 stars even though I put in less sauerkraut and swiss cheese to my liking. I also added a bit of red bell pepper. We loved it! If you do put in less ingredients, you will probably want to adjust liquids as you desire.

Loved it. Added a full cup of beef broth as we like our soup a little less thick than it ended up. May add some veggies next time to liven it up a bit!!

I followed the recipe exactly but found the soup to be too thick. I added 2 additional cups of water and 2 additional teaspoons of beef bouillon. That helped.

Added a 1/2 cup of Irish beer. Was a hit!
