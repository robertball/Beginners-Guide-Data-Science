This is the best Spanish rice recipe on this site! I don't understand why people don't follow the direction to saute the rice! This is not supposed to be a "sticky rice" like Puerto Rican or Chinese rice, but that's what you'll get if you don't saute it first.  I don't agree that you should brown it.... it should turn translucent, but not brown.  If you are adding fresh garlic, add it after sauteing the rice and only cook it long enough for it to release it's aroma..don't brown it-it will turn bitter. After you add the liquid, bring the rice to a full, rolling boil before turning it down to low and putting the lid on. Also, make sure you have a tight fitting lid...cover it with foil to make it tighter if necessary.  Don't peek while the rice it cooking!  After 20 minutes move it off the heat and let it "rest" another 5 minutes. If you do these things you will have purfect rice! Even though I ususally use homemade salsa, I think the Pace "Make Mine Medium" gives the right amount of heat and flavor to the dish.  Thanks for a great recipe that everyone can  master and enjoy!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I've tried all the other recipes on this site & decided this is the best!  I like using salsa more than diced tomatoes b/c it has more flavor and spice ...and it doesn't taste like you just dumped salsa in it like I expected.  This is only for my family of 4, so I use 3/4C of uncooked rice, definitely a little more than half a tablespoon of olive oil (full recipe calls for too much), with 3/4 of the can of chicken broth (approx 1 1/2C), BUT still use 1C of salsa as I feel it's necessary, as well as a few dashes of pepper.   I only brown rice a few minutes longer after it's turned WHITE (very apparent white color).  Being Asian myself, I could cook rice w/my eyes closed it seems.  lol  Many times we don't add onions b/c I'm too lazy to dice them.  If we do, it definitely needs more than suggested or it's pointless adding. It's even better when you add diced green & red peppers to the rice you are browning or use green onion instead of white/red.  We eat the rice every time we make "Whit's Chicken Enchiladas" which is SUPER EASY and YUMMY! This takes less time than indicated for the rice to be done.  Also great to put in baking dish, add cheese, and bake at 350 until it melts! :)

I made this spanish rice for Xmas Eve Dinner, it was excellent.  However I did have to add some water & let it simmer a little longer to get the rice done.  I added just 1/4 tsp. chili powder to it.  My cousin who is a chef said, "it's perfect".  That ought to tell you something.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious results for minimal effort. I prepared this as written except for using butter rather than vegetable oil. This worked perfectly  with our chicken enchiladas and Frijoles a la Charra.  Good stuff!

I made this yesterday to go with the Mexican Theme of my son and husband's birthday party dinner. I modified it for a large group and used 6 cups chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups picante sauce and 4 cups rice. I did have to add about 2 cups more water since the rice was still a little chewy after cooking down.  I then just added garlic and onion powder to it, spread it in a 9x13 baking pan and sprinkled mexican blend cheese over the top and put in the oven for about 15 min till the cheese was melted.  this was sooo good and sooo easy to make! Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious & Easy!  Best Spanish rice I have ever made.  I think even better than our local mexican restaurant.  I added about 2 & 1/2 C. chicken broth.  Either need to do that or cut rice from 1 & 1/2 C. down to 1 C.  Also, did not brown rice as read reviews saying made it too crunchy.  I sauteed onions and then added broth, rice, and salsa and cooked slowly so that rice would be soft.  A keeper!

tastey! i used pace picante sauce (salsa) and 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 white. Next time, i'll use all brown rice since it is so much healthier for you! We couldn't taste the dirty bland-ness of brown rice at all, the flavor was perfect. One thing to change however- it takes about 30 mins or so to simmer! It was the last part of our dinner to finish. ;)

This is a GREAT base for spanish rice.  I love the idea of cooking it in chicken broth!  However I do make a few changes. I use enchilada sauce instead of salsa-just about 1/2 of a small can.  ( I usually make this with my enchiladas so I have it on hand) I also add cumin which is ESSENTIAL and green chiles.  I also add a little cayenne, but that is just my preference!

This is a good recipe. Did it exactly as recipe says except substituted with ROTEL...what I don't understand is people giving low stars but yet they make all these changes to the recipe...brown rice, etc.  By the way recipe say to cook onions on med. for about 5 minutes it doesn't say you have to. And as with alot of recipes when you brown or toast the rice first then you add the liquid.  It doesn't have to be hot liquid and then adding the rice.  I just get really annoyed when people change up recipes and then low star it It ridiculous.  Great recipe

I have tried many Spanish rice recipes, only to be continually disappointed.  I was about ready to give up until I found this one!  I have made it so many times!  And, it heats up just as good for leftovers, a huge bonus!  The liquid to rice ratio is absolutely PERFECT, don't mess with it!  After lightly browning the rice, I add in the broth and salsa and sprinkle just a touch of salt.  I stir it very lightly, just to blend and then bring it to a boil.  Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to the LOWEST setting, cover and let cook for 15 minutes.  Remove from the burner and let sit for another 10 minutes before uncovering.  The rice turns out perfect EVERY time!  UPDATE 5/15/13 - I still make this recipe all the time!  Last time I made it, I only had beef broth handy so I used that in place of the chicken broth - then, feeling adventurous, I also added in 1 Tablespoon of taco seasoning and didn't add any salt... can I just say WOW!  It was amazing, you should try it!

Delicious!!!  Use a name brand salsa, such as Pace, instead of a cheap brand.  Add more broth if necessary.  I will make this again!

This is a great dish! The first time I tried it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! The second time, I wanted to use ingredients in "as they come" quantities. My chicken broth comes in cans aof 15.5 ounces, just shy of two cups. The salsa comes in a 16 ounce (by weight) container, and is over one cup. Wanting a more saucy rice, I used the smallest onion I had, 1 cup of rice instead of 1.5 cups, one can of broth, and one jar of salsa. I enjoyed it just as much.   What a wonderful recipe this cook submitted! It's so much better than anything I've used from a package, and gave me the courage to modify it just a bit to suit my needs!

MUY DELICIOSO, I read some of the reviews and made a few changes because of them. PERFECTION! I used brown rice for its nutrients and reduced it to 1 1/4 cups, added a little more broth (2 1/4 cups) and also added  a tsp of cumin and cayenne pepper, salt & pepper to taste. It was delicious! VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT PEEK  DURING THE COOKING PROCESS. Since I used brown rice I added more cooking time -- 30 mins. Then I let it sit another 15 mins. before I took the lid off. Also, you really want to sauté the rice till it looks transparent before adding the liquids and that will ensure a fluffy result, not mushy. My family absolutely loved it and said it was restaurant quality! Definitely a keeper. Mahalo!

I LOVE Spanish Rice, and I've tried several recipes on this site.  I, like others, was a little reluctant, afraid it would just taste like salsa, but was pleasantly surprised that it was awesome!!  And as icing on the deliciousness is that it takes no time at all and uses very minimal ingredients.

The only alteration I made to the original recipe was that I added about a tablespoon of cumin.

Great recipe!!!

To be the best spanish rice you have to add a little cumin, it really gives the dish a lot of flavor.

This makes a fairly good rice, but plan accordingly if you use BROWN RICE. It WILL NOT be done in the time specified. I know brown & wild rices tend to take longer than white, but after 20 minutes, it was still fairly crunchy and swimming in broth/salsa. I've tried this twice now just to be sure I wasn't doing something else wrong. Be sure to allow about double the cook time if your family uses brown rice.

Pretty good. I was in a rush, so I just put all the ingredients in my rice cooker instead of doing it on the stove. I increased the chicken stock a little as I was worried the rice might not be moist enough. I was glad I did as it turned out nice and fluffy. I used Med. heat salsa, which ended up being to spicy for my poor boyfriend. If I made this again I would deffinetly use a mild, as I don't think the spicy heat is really necesarry. It's the flavour that's important. Pretty tasty :)

I don't need to try any more Spanish rice or Mexican rice recipes: this one is the winner.  It was so delicious that I looked forward to eating the leftovers!  Do use the 2 Tbl of oil, as part of that is necessary for when you add the rice.  Also, use an entire small onion and go ahead and cook it until it starts to brown and caramelize.  Make sure to use long-grain or basmati rice.  We used vegetarian broth and everyone highly enjoyed this rice.  It's great as a tasty side with your home-made Mexican dinner (if you have not yet tried the recipe "Authentic Enchiladas Verdes" on allrecipes.com yet, you MUST TRY IT!!  We used Quorn chicken substitute) or you can put tasty beans over it or use it in a burrito.  The recipe is easy and simple and still surprisingly good.

This is a really easy and good recipe and I really enjoyed it. But I do have to say that I read in a previous review that you will acheive "sticky rice" if you do not saute the rice. And I just have to say that this is not true. You do not have to saute the rice if you do not choose to, although it does add some nice flavor to the dish. The only way you will acheive "sticky rice" like what they use in many oriental dishes is if you use short grain rice. The reason is because molecularly speaking, it has a different amount of gluten than med or short grain rice and therefore the heat and steam begins to break down the sugars in short grain rice much more. That is what creates sticky rice, not the subtraction of sauteing it. So now we are left with this... To saute, or not saute. That is the question! Haha!

I fried some minced garlic and also about 3 tbs. of green bell pepper with the onion.  This was an easy recipe but I thought it laked flavor.  Maybe some chili powder, salt and pepper would go well.

This really is an easy and delicious way to make spanish rice; I've made it this way for years.  You can use all different sorts of salsas....tomatillo salsa (green) makes it very tasty and different from your run of the mill salsas.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great and easy sidedish for any Mexican meal! Served with "Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesdillas" and the combo was delish! Thanks to other reviewers, I too added some extra chicken broth (used 2 1/2 cups). I will be making this rice many times!

I have tried several spanish rice recipes from this site and this one is by far the best! I did not follow other reviews and feel that the measurements are just right.  My rice was not mushy and was not sticking to the pan/pot!  I used 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies since I did not have salsa.  I did add some chili powder and ground cumin to the rice (just lightly sprinkled over the rice).  As other reviews stated, you absolutely must saute the rice first (not brown, the rice should be translucent).  Thanks for the perfect recipe! UPDATE 4/19/2016: I've been making this for a while, but tonight I added about 1/2 cup La Preferida tomato sauce instead of chunky salsa and felt the use of tomato sauce was much better. Here's what I do whenever making spanish rice now: 1) saute 1.5 cups white rice (jasmine), 2) stir in the diced onion and 1 small clove garlic, minced, 3) stir in salsa/tomato sauce, 4) Add 2 cups water or chicken broth, 5) Stir in  about 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp oregano (you could also add in paprika or chili powder--1 tsp should be ok), 5) Reduce heat to low, 6) cover skillet with aluminum foil and then put on the lid. Do not open lid/foil. Just leave it alone for 20 minutes, then check to make sure it's done--it will be done in 20 minutes! Remove from heat. You can leave it covered while finishing other dishes you might be making to keep the rice warm and moist. Delicious! Follow the recipe as stated or with my notes and you will NOT have under

The youth group at our church had a Mexican Night and this is one of the things we made to serve 130 people.  We did change the way we cooked this, we put the chicken broth and salsa together and brought it to a boil on top of the stove and then added the rice and simmered it for 20 minutes.  Everyone LOVED this rice!  We served this with salsa chicken.  Good recipe!

This recipe is really easy and very good, but I would agree with the other reviewers..cut down the rice to 1 cup and do not brown the rice.  Also, I added about 2 tbsp of green pepper and 1 tsp of minced garlic to the recipe and it was great!

I'm sorry, but I don't know how this recipe gets such a high rating. I had a bad feeling it wouldn't turn out, and it didn't. You know why? Because there is too much rice for the amount of liquid. 1 1/2 cups of rice requires 3 cups of liquid. 2 cups of stock + 1 cup of *chunky* salsa does not equal 3 cups of liquid. The rice absorbed all the liquid in the pot and was still hard, so I had to add more water and cook longer. BTW, I actually used picante sauce, which is quite a bit more watery than chunky salsa, so I can only imagine how hard the rice would have been if I had used salsa.  In order for this to turn out you either need to use less rice or more liquid.  FWIW, the flavor was OK (a little bland, but that's easy to fix) but the texture (hardness) wasn't.

This is the best rice! I doubled this recipe and used 3 cups rice and increased the broth to 5 1/2 cups  put crushed garlic and 3 tsp of cumin..cover lid with foil, bring to boil reduce to low cover and don't take lid off cook for 20 minutes take off heat and leave for 5 minutes or so!!!  I used Pace Medium chunky and used a little more than 2 cups....perfect...put in 9x13 and used Mexico cheese blend and warm in over to melt...everyone loved it..

This is a quick and simple recipe to make spanish/mexican rice.  I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. I used parboiled rice and mild salsa. Kids loved it.  Served it as a side for chicken enchiladas.

I use this all the time love it. The only thing I do differently is instead of the chicken broth I throw in the Knorr concentrated chicken stock and add water. (I love the Knorr chicken stock use for everything)

Followed Karen H's instructions to saute the rice until translucent along with the onions.  I did add another 1/2 cup of chunky salsa.  It worked beautifully.  We loved the taste and the texture was excellent as well, with the rice being perfectly cooked.  I look forward to doing this often!

I really liked this dish.  I added 2 tablespoons of red bell pepper at the same time as the onion.  After the 5 minutes, i added 2 cloves of garlic and waited 1 min.  I added the chicken broth and fresh salsa, brought the whole thing to a rolling boil, then reduced the heat to low and covered for 20 mins.  After the 20 minutes, i took the rice off the heat (still covered) and let it sit another 5 min.  Right before serving I added about 1 tbsp of fresh parsely.

I served this rice with the "camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp)" from this website.

Loved this dish and so did my family. I made it with brown rice in a rice cooker and added 1/2 c. More broth, a little cumin and a dash of chili powder. I also sauted the onions in 2 Tbsp. Butter and added it to the rice cooker at the start. I Agee with another reviewer who said brown rice needs to be cooked a bit longer. I will make this again. No more need for store bought and this is so easy!

I've made this recipe twice:  once exactly as directed, and the second time adding 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1 teaspoon cumin.  The second time was definitely better for our Tex-Mex taste buds (although it did have kick).  I also used medium-hot chunky salsa, which added to the spicy flavor.  We loved it.  Having a Mexican restaurant on nearly every corner here in Texas, we've become quite the Spanish rice lovers, and this fit the bill for a version to make at home.  But, it did need a little extra zip for our Texas taste.

This was so simple and it turned out really good.  I used basmati rice and added some salt to taste.  My son ate this along with refried beans and said he really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

Sautéed about 1/4 C. minced onion, 3 green onions and 1 hefty garlic clove then added the rice to sautee. Used 1 can of mild Rotel (15 oz.) and 2 C. chicken stock with 1.5 cups of white Jasmine rice, cooking 22 minutes then allowing to set for 5 with the lid on. The end result was fluffy instead of gummy and very flavorful. Next time I'll add 1/2 tsp. cumin and maybe a dash of chili powder, but the overall flavor was great and, importantly, the texture was SO MUCH BETTER than any packaged rice of ANY brand (and believe me, we've tried them all).  I served this to 4 adults with some leftovers -- not a ton.  I'd 1.5 the recipe if serving for 6.

I was making my Chicken Enchiladas for dinner and need a quick side dish. Figured this recipe looked easy and had lots of good reviews. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand.
After reading some of the reviews I made a few changes as others found helpful. First while softening up the onions I added in a little garlic. I did not brown the rice, just sauted it before it started to color up. I was using a long grain rice so I added in an extra 1/2 cup of broth and also a couple tablespoons green chillies since I had some left over from my enchilada recipe. I sealed the pan with foil and the lid and did not peak until the 20 minutes was up.
Came out nice and fluffy, a little brown on the bottom, but it had a nice flavor and happy it wasn't all clumpy.

Yummy and EASY.  I do add some garlic while the oil is heating int the skillet.  I use olive oil as it's a little more aromatic.  We searched and searched for a good home-made spanish rice recipe and this is IT.  It's not too sticky like some.  Also, if I want it to be a little fluffier, I bake it in a 350 oven with a lid on the pan for about 45 minutes...while I bake chicken.

This recipe turns out great every time. Except I add two cloves of garlic and use 1-10oz can Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Jalapenos instead of salsa. Throw another tablespoon of fresh chopped Jalapeno in if you like it extra spicy. Everyone who's eaten it, loves it.

Best Spanish rice recipe ever!  I followed directions almost, then added my own touches from other reviews. My additions were: one small can of mild diced green chilis.  1/4 tsp. chili powder.  Also never removed lid while cooking and let it sit off the burner for 5 minutes.  Also.....used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of oil.

This is a great Spanish Rice recipe. It is extremely simple and the rice turned out moist and tasty. The only change I made was to add pepper (white, red, black) which I often do, so no stars deducted... I was very pleased.

I don't know why I've been BUYING Spanish Rice this whole time, but it will end now that I've tried this recipe :P It's so simple yet so flavourful, it's ridiculous! The only thing I did differently was using brown rice and adding some butter at the end - not sure why, but this is how I've always made store bought rice so I figured it couldn't hurt. Will be making this for Taco Nights instead of buying from now on ^_^

I followed the recipe except that I doubled the onion amount.  Not my favorite recipe but my husband did like it a lot.  I will make it again but probably add some browned ground beef and corn to it or something after it is cooked through and make it a whole meal.

My family loved this. I used a mix of homemade salsas - tomato & salsa verde. I used more onion than 2 t., we love onion. Also added in quite a bit of fresh garlic. The trick to this rice is learning your range temps, a good fitting lid and don't open it until it's done.

This recipe doesn't have enough liquid. The rice was not cooked after 25 mins. All the liquid had evaporated and it was burning to the bottom of the pan. I had to stir another 1/2 -3/4 cup broth in to get it tender. Between bringing that back up to a boil and the extra stirring and taking the lid off to keep checking, it came out gummy.

This is a very good starting point for Spanish rice, but it needs more spice. Specifically, it needs chili powder, cumin, garlic, and perhaps paprika. Additionally, it needs some salt added to it. It is a very good recipe to tinker with.

Wow, I thought I invented this recipe, but I guess if it's good, lots of people come up with it! We're usually in a hurry to get dinner on the table when I make this, so I often use instant rice in the recipe. Just adjust the liquid and rice proportions to about equal amounts. Quick, easy, and tasty!

Not the best spanish rice I've ever had, but it's so easy and tasty that I plan on making it often.  The first time I made it, I fried the rice and it came out a little chewy.  The second time, I skipped the frying and it came out great.  I've used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and liked that a little better.
Also--this is key--the better the salsa, the better the rice will turn out.  I've made it with regular salsa in a jar and it turned out so-so, but when I made it with the fresh kind you get in the gourmet-deli section of the grocery store it was really good!

Very good recipe.  I added some boiled shrimp I had left over from the night before and it was wonderful.  Instead of salsa, I used a homeade pico salsa I had made that had onions, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, green onion tops and bell peppers.  Boyfriend loved it and said I was an awesome cook!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

This rice was so easy and good. I used black bean salsa from Trader Joe's.  Will probably add a can of tomatoes next time because my salsa didn't have enough in it, but even still it was really delicious.  Served with Mexican Baked Fish from this site -- a gorgeous meal!

This is a very good spanish rice recipe. The rice was a little crunchy, next time I would add a little more broth, maybe a little red pepper to spice it up. Recommended!

Beeeeyooootiful Spanish Rice - so easy. Please, remember to season for your tastes! If you like heat, add it! if you like it extra tomato-ey add it! Other wonderful things that you can add or not to your taste --- olives! more garlic, diced peppers, hot sauce, kidney beans, chick peas, white beans. But the single most important step in this rice dish is you MUST sauté it first. the second - DONT use minute rice.
third - remember, everyone's stove is a bit different, every cup of rice is a bit different.. the standard liquid to rice measure is two to one. meaning two of liquid, one of rice - this recipe allows for 1 and half cups rice, so you would need 3 cups liquid for it to work, 2 of chicken broth and the other cup from the chunky salsa - not all salsa's are the same so in short keep your eye on the liquid. Espcially if you are adding additional ingredients that have a lot of liquid like diced tomatoes....last - you bring this to a boil, and then you slow simmer.  I generally bring mine to a boil, let it boil a good 4-5 minutes and I turn my stove top OFF(electric stove). I let it sit tightly covered for 20 mins on the same burner. but that's me and my stove - think about how your rice works on your stove - and if you have to have your stove on, then leave it on low but very low so the bottom doesn't stick or burn.. (I usually add a spray of butter flavored Pam to the bottom of my pot before putting anything, even water in. Thanks for the EASY and great tasting recipe!!

Our family loved this recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I increased to 1/4 diced onion and added one cube of chicken bouillon in addition to chicken broth, as I was concerned about having enough flavor.  We like lots of flavor!  I did brown the onions and the rice very well.  I used Pace Chunky salsa with medium heat.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you very much for sharing.

Excellent!  I doubled it and it was perfect.  I didn't change a thing- I used a jar of medium salsa from Trader Joe's and store brand low sodium fat free chicken broth.  BETTER than the restaurants!

Loved this!  Rice was moist and very flavorful.  Way too easy!  One thing to note, check after about 15 minutes.  Mine was out of liquid, but not yet done, so I added a little water fo finish out the time.

this is really good. used brown rice, just needs to cook alot longer. sauteed onion and garlic, then added the rice and sauteed a bit longer. brown rice can require more cooking liquid, i added some water along with the chicken stock.

This is a great recipe. Very simple and delicious. It's better if you use your own salsa instead of store-bought, however (I make salsa all the time in the summer.). Why bother with a box or envelope mix - that have MSG and who knows what else. Try this recipe!

I've been dying to find a perfect Spanish rice recipe, and as far as I'm concerned this is it. I used 3/4 cup rice, 2/3 cup salsa, and a cup of water, and it came out perfect. The amount of onion this calls for is questionable because it's so small, so instead of chopped onion I subbed in some onion powder. I also threw in a little sofrito (maybe a couple tablespoons). Everyone loved it, and I imagine the addition of some jalapenos would please those who need a little kick.

Update: I tend to cook this as a sticky rice without frying the rice first, and my wife cooks it as per directions. Both ways taste great. I've found not frying the rice takes about 20 minutes on my stove, and frying takes 25 (with 5-10 minutes of rest time after it's finished cooking). It doesn't hurt to throw in some chili peppers, sazon, or sofrito either!

Quite good for how simple and quick this recipe is. I followed it as written but used half the oil for browning the rice and onions. Browning the rice adds a nice element to the flavor. This recipe is subtle in flavor which is perfect if you are serving it with something spicy or flavor packed.

This was good.  I only made 3 servings and that still made what I would call 5 servings.  The flavor is not very strong so it is a perfect side dish for a more falvorful Mexican side dish like Enchiladas or Tacos.

I don't get this at all.. For one, the cooking times are COMPLETELY off. I can't fault this recipe 100% for that tho.... I subbed brown rice for white and think this may have been the reason my rice wasn't cooked thru after 20 minutes (but then again, many reviews specifically mention having to cook for longer than stated, even when using white rice as directed). Unfortunately, I'm not going to try this again to find out! To be fair, I'll award three stars just *in case* my substitution is totally to blame. My main gripe with this is two-fold. First, the "suggested" cooking time for sauteeing the onion is WAY off (my gosh)! I have been cooking for years and know that cooking onions over MEDIUM heat for 5 MINUTES is far too long! It should take a couple of minutes MAX (a few if you cook on low heat) to soften such a SMALL amount of onion. Second, you should ALWAYS bring your rice / liquid to a boil FIRST, then cover and simmer until done (duh). I'm not sure why the recipe submitter didn't instruct to do this (?). I'm very puzzled.... This seems to have been a hit for so many people. I'm a firm believer that if a recipe needs this much tweaking, it doesn't qualify as a "kitchen approved" recipe in the least (sorry!). Thanks anyways, ilovetocook.

This is a very easy delicious recipe.  I orignially decreased the amount of rice based on some reviews and the 1 to 2 ratio on the package.  but this was a mistake! The salsa adds moisture so the rice came out too moist.  I'd make this again with the called for 1 1/2C rice.  I added chopped onion as the recipe states but I dont think its necessary because the salsa has onion in it.

I must have done something wrong. I used white long grain rice and tostitos salsa and still had to add about another cup of chicken stock. Maybe it should have been made with instant rice???? The only ingredient I added was a whole onion. My family loves onion. Too bad because it sounded like a fast and easy way to make spanish rice :(

This is ok, nothing special. I prefer starting with chicken stock, using a can of tomato sauce, cumin, and mexican spices. Tastes more authentic that way. This is similar to a rice a roni type mexican rice. Meh.

I wasn't expecting too much from this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised! The kids loved it and it goes well with Mexican food. Be sure to use a quality salsa though, in order to avoid that spaghetti sauce/canned flavor you can get from some of the lower quality salsas.

I cooked this in my rice cooker, so I didn't fry any of the ingredients first. It was very eash to make. The rice needed more liquid, it was a little undercooked. I added some more stock and cooked it a little longer, which fixed it. I used a mild salsa, I added a half a bell pepper and half a small can of black olives. My husband said more tomatoes would have been good, too. Overall, we really did like this rice. I served it with tacos. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I had read the reviews before I made this, so I used 1 cup of rice, added more broth and did not brown rice. My family loved this. I will certainly make this again. Great Recipe.

This was so fast and easy to make.  It's also delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The rice was fluffy and tender like I expected Spanish rice to be.  I garnished it with some fresh chopped cilantro.  I'll make this again with the beef enchiladas from this website.

This is great, so easy! I make sure to use a salsa with less salt as this can turn out quite salty. I also find that if you leave it to cook it will stick to the bottom of the pan, you really need to continue stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot the whole way through.

Really delicious and very simple to make. I added extra onion and a bit of cumin added, as other reviewers mentioned. I made it with medium spicy salsa and it had a bit too much of a kick to it, to my taste. Next time I think I'll use mild salsa. Also, I didn't have chicken broth so I used the powdered consomme instead. I'm sure chicken broth would be amazing, but in a pinch, the powder works fine.
Thanks for the recipe!

Truly is the best Spanish Rice ever.  I did make a mistake the second time I made it - don't double the recipe and do not stir after the ingredients have been combined.  You will end up with mush.

I have always used a wonderful easy spanish rice recipe I was taught how to make from a mexican lady who makes it for her family.  I love the little clove of garlic, finely sliced carrot and corn, she adds to her Spanish Rice.  I also added a little more diced onion, to this recipe.  She also fries her rice before mixing anything with it.  Just till you see it start to brown or becomes translucent.  I didn't have the thick picante sauce so I used the mild regular.
If you don't have picante, just add some chicken broth, tomato sauce, garlic all into a blender and add it to your water and chicken broth to bring the liquid to the right measure for the spanish rice.  That's how my friend does her SRice adding the sliced carrot and corn.  Simple but very delicious.
Cover and don't peak as suggested in another post.  The rice cooked perfectly.

Good spanish rice, BUT...I am Puerto Rican and the secret is Cilantro, fresh minced cilantro...cut up about a 1/3 cup and fold it in about a couple of minutes before serving it and it will be perfect!

I was looking for a rice side dish to go w/ an enchilada casserole.  This recipe was just right and sooo easy!  I followed recipe just as directed and it came out perfectly.  I think the secret is to use a good chunky salsa.  The one I used was med spice w/ garlic.  No additional salt needed.  This recipe is a keeper for my family.

I made just a couple changes to this, nothing drastic.  I used butter instead of oil, minute rice, and my homemade canned salsa.  Adding the rice to the butter and onion is key.  It turned out fabulous!  The rice was nice and fluffy and the chunky salsa added just enough heat. I served this rice with homemade chicken flautas, gaucamole, and chips.  It's a keeper for sure.
Thanks so much for sharing this.

We were not really fans of this. I tried once w/a medium salsa & another time w/a mild picante. It just tastes too much like the salsa/picante that you use. Not the flavor I'm looking for, I guess. Sorry :(

I followed the recipe. Plus I've made rice before this way, i.e. sauteing it first and then adding broth to finish cooking it, but this recipe did not work. I think the problem was that 1 1/2 cups rice was too much. It never got translucent and then took forever to brown. Although browned, it was hard and uncooked, as expected. However, adding the broth and cooking for 20 minutes did not help. I kept adding broth, and then water. This rice took an hour to cook. It kept sticking and burning to the bottom of the pan. If there is a certain type of rice kernel that should be used, it should be specified. I used a white rice I had on hand - I think it was pearl rice - and it was a disaster. Fought with it, as I say, for an hour. It tasted alright when finished, but much of that had to do with the good, fresh salsa I used. Will not try this recipe again.

I have made this recipe several times and my entire family loves it!   It's really delicious as it is, but I've tweaked it a few times just for variety.  I like adding 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.  One night I added 1/2 pound (browned) ground beef, covered it and baked it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.... removed cover...sprinkled one cup shredded cheddar cheese and returned to the oven until cheese was bubbly.

This recipe is awesome...even better than our best Mexican restaurant here in Terre Haute, IN.  I did make a few changes.  I used 2 tbsp butter instead of oil, and I used a quarter onion instead of measuring out 2 tbsp.  Also, I didn't really wait for the rice to brown, just until a little translucent (something like 1 minutes).  After adding the water, bullion, and salsa, I cooked a few minutes until it started boiling before covering for 20 minutes on low.  Regardless, this was "¡Muy bien!"

Wow, this was so simple but came out perfect! I omitted the onions at the first step since the salsa has onions in it anyway. So yummy.

Pretty mushy. Nothing like actual spanish rice. Super bland as well. I suggest getting the white rice in the hispanic section at your local grocery store. Jasmine rice just doesn't cut it. Also, you need way more than 2 tbs of onion. I added cumin, chili powder, garlic, serrano peppers and corn. Without these things it would have tasted like nothing. I don't know why people are so stoked on this recipe.

This was a really great recipe and so easy. I added about 3TBS onions. And only used 1 cup of rice and same amount of liquids it called for. Next time I will reduce the water a little. Follow the suggestions of covering for 20 minutes and let sit for 5 minutes without removing the lid. It should come out perfect that way.

This was really good and I didnt even have enough salsa to make this with. I served it with the Tex Mex tilapia and a couple days later, I put some of this rice in a wrap for lunch and it was really yummy! Thanks for this simple recipe. I will be making it again.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  Even with a mild salsa (I used Pace brand), this rice still had more flavor than the dry, tasteless rice served at many Mexican restaurants.  If you like your rice spicy, you might want to amp up the flavor with a spicy salsa or some additional flavorings, but we liked it as is.

Let me start out by saying I do NOT like rice. My husband wanted spanish rice to accompany the enchiladas we made and so I pulled up this recipe. OMG! I think I ate more of this rice than he did. This is the BEST rice I have ever had!

This is really simple to make and tastes good too. I think it makes much more than 5 servings. Be aware that because a lot of the liquid from the salsa disappears, it tastes spicier than you think it will. Thanks for the great recipe!

I think the recipe was great!  For the few that didn't get the rice to cook properly I would suggest that you cover the rice while cooking and Do Not lift the lid until the end of the cooking time.  Rice steams to cook and apparently someone either didn't cover it or kept lifting the lid during the steaming process.

I loved this! It turned out fluffy with just enough flavor. It did take about 30 minutes instead of 20, but I was using a medium size skillet. This will be a staple on Mexian night in our house!

Great rice, perfect side dish.  I used pace for the salsa and veggie broth to keep it vegetarian.  It is light in texture and flavor and really nice!  Thanks, I've already made this twice!

Great simple recipe! I did have to add a touch more liquid, but that is to be expected when cooking rice. I took this to an "Un-Thanksgiving" Potluck topped with some shredded cheddar cheese. I did not bring any home!

I love this recipe!  Granted I made a few modifications (some of which I won't make again).  I used long grain brown rice, which means I had to increase the liquid and the cooking time.  I also added half a chopped chipotle pepper in adobo that I had left over ofrom another recipe(ended up being a tad to spicy for us).  I also added a bit of lime juice and zest at the end.

A winning recipe, for sure.  I diced up a large onion and used about 1 T. of garlic.  I thawed my homemade chicken broth that I always have in the freezer for such occasions, and used Costco's fresh salsa, which is outstanding in this dish. Ingredients tasted so fresh and no extras spices were necessary.  Will try a bell pepper next time, and maybe an extra half cup of salsa.  We served our rice with some sour cream on the side.  So good.  This dish paired well with orange roughy.

This was not bad,  very flavorful, but preferred the cooking method/ingredients amounts of another recipe on this website,  which recommended cooking 12-15 min,  then allowing it to stand 12-15 min, never lifting the cover.  That rice was perfect, this one burned on the bottom

This recipe is Divine!. I added salt and garlic as suggested by others who posted reviews. I also made it with parboiled rice (Golden Canilla) simply because I have tried cooking rice on the stovetop before and it hasn't really worked for me, but that's just me! Also, when I served it on the plate I sprinkled some shredded cheese on top and melted it in the microwave. Yummy!

I had tried one other Spanish Rice recipe from here that wasn't good. This one ROCKS! We had a spicy salsa so our rice had some 'heat' to it. Very good! This is the one I'll use from now on.

This recipe is really really good!  You do have to follow the directions exactly, though.  Thanks to Karen H for the tip about the foil, that really helped out.  (Covering the pan with foil and then putting the lid on for a tight seal.)  You have to remember that the salsa is going to make all the difference in this recipe.  Use a salsa that you know you like, and one that is not too hot for whoever you are feeding.  Also, the amount of liquid in the salsa needs to be considered, too.  I can't remember what salsa I used, but it came out perfectly!  Good luck, it's the best!!

This was the best Spanish rice! I made it exactly as written, except I added just a touch of cumin like someone had suggested.  I served it with some sliced black olives and melted some jack cheese on top.  It went perfect with the salmon fajitas I served.  I will definitely be making this often.  Thank you!

AWESOME! Thats the best word I can think of at the moment to describe this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be the best rice I have ever had. It's even really good reheated the next day. My husband who does not like rice usually, tried it, then he wouldn't stop eating it! Thats amazing! I made it as a side dish to a great chicken enchilada recipe I found on this site. Now if I could just find a recipe to change his opinion of sweet potatoes....? LOL My kids loved the rice too, cleaned their plates and asked for seconds!  Thanks so much for this recipe. I will be making this a lot.

This is a pretty good Spanish rice. The texture comes out perfect! I took other reviewers' advice, and added some salt and cumin for flavor. I used Pace Medium Picante for the salsa. I think next time, I will try something else- maybe a small can of diced tomatoes, slightly zapped with the chopper?- instead of the salsa. I like my rice to be a little less spicy, since I pair it with a spicy main dish. All in all, though- very good!

I loved this because it was simple and had great flavor. I made it as a side to the Slow Cooker Chile Verde (on this site) and it was very good. Will probably not need to try any other Spanish rice - this is perfect.

Delicious. Add a little chix broth if the rice isn't tender after 2 cups.  I used cheap rice I had on hand for rice pudding. When the rice was tender I sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top and turned the heat off and covered it until the cheese melted . . .mmmmmmm.Loved it!

Previous reviewer must have made this wrong.  This is delicious.  Add more chicken broth if needed as rice tends to soak up the liquid if it sets for a long period of time.  Also, use a good brand of picante sauce for best results. This is definitely better than restaurant rice!

This recipe ROCKS!  I'm ADDICTED!  I've served it to many friends and relatives and everybody loves it.  We're all picky eaters too!  Anyway, the only thing I would clarify is that I made it with LONG grain white rice and La Victoria chunky salsa.  If you use low-sodium chicken broth you may have to add salt for flavor.  VERY EASY and TASTY!

Yum!  I made a slight addition of  green bell pepper to give it some color and a little crunch. I  sautéed it in with more onions than recipe calls for.  This was perfect with the Salsa Chicken recipe here on Allrecipes. I served the chicken and rice with refried beans and it was all so good.

I would fix it with every meal!  I personally, wouldn't think so good with say---ice cream, but he would.  Try it, you'll love it.--especially with cheese/onion enchiladas and red beans.

This was an outstanding dish. Definitely worth the extra work. Browning the rice in oil before adding the broth definitely adds to the flavor. This does not compare to anything you can get from a box. Excellent!

This was fantastic!  I have been looking for an easy way to make Spanish rice with my chicken burritos and enchiladas and this was perfect.  Hubby loved it as well.  I will make this whenever I make a Mexican food dinner!

This is a simple and fantastic recipe for Spanish Rice.  I add a can of Rotel in place of the salsa and it's the perfect dash of spice.

Followed recipe, other than adding about 1/2cp onion. It looked and smelled delicious, but it turned out a little bland.  I use a salsa that I know and love, that is chunky and full of flavor.  I might try this again in the future, but it will need more seasoning for sure.  Sauteing the rice really did make it more Spanish style than sticky rice.

Not bad, and very easy in a pinch. I used beef broth, since I didn't have chicken. Turned out just as good. If you want to get creative with it you can add diced mushrooms, olives, etc.

This is a great Spanish rice recipe! I used Pace salsa, and halved the recipe to feed two people (but didn't decrease the onions, as we love them). Hubby raved about it! I could have made my entire meal on just this dish! A must try!

Great recipe! I did add a little bit of salt to taste, however. It seemed a bit odd that salt was not on the ingredient list. Otherwise, this is a no-brainer, fool-proof basic Mexican/Spanish rice recipe.

Great recipe and super easy to prepare. I did add a couple of small changes. I used Jasmine rice instead of white, because I just like the taste better. I also substituted about half a cup of green salsa for the chicken broth to give the recipe a little more spice. Then, I served it with a side of sour cream. It turned out amazing and my entire family enjoyed it. Thanks for the
wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! Really easy and quick. Make sure you use the full 2 cups of chicken broth though. I used a 14.5 oz can and it wasn't enough. Also I used mild salsa because that's what we usually use, but next time I'd probably try medium for this recipe.

I read the reviews, and also made the following changes. Increased onion (1/2 of an onion - chopped), and chicken stock to 3 cups (white rice is usually cooked 2-1 ratio liquid to rice). After the rice was browned, I added a little adobo, and put all ingredients in a glass covered dish, and into the microwave for 25 minutes. No stirring, no peeking. Perfect. Would make this again.

So easy, with results as good as recipes that have 6+ ingredients.  The real deciding factor in this recipe is which salsa you use.  I use only high-quality, organic salsa with plenty of cilantro and the flavor is wonderful.  If you use cheap, crappy, generic picante sauce, you will get a bland and too-dry version.  Picante sauce has a much lower moisture content than salsa.  The only thing I add to this recipe is to throw in a little roasted corn when I have it.  And remember, SAUTE THE RICE FIRST, PEOPLE.  It makes a huge difference.

This rice was a smashing success on Taco Tuesday.  I used vegetarian bouillon instead of the chicken broth, and I was too lazy to chop onions, so I used dehydrated onions... turned out great!  Easy too!

Please follow the exact recipe.  Watch and stir the rice, do not brown.  The best non soupy Spanish rice, ever.  You can add more seasonings, if you want.  Love this.

I added chopped garlic during the last minute of sauté. A fantastic way to use up salsa. I made this as a side dish to the beef enchiladas, which also called for salsa: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/better-than-ever-beef-enchiladas-2/detail.aspx.

Everyone loved this.  The only change I made was I added 1 package of frozen corn to give it a more tex-mex look.

Super easy and pretty good! I do half salsa, and half sweet corn relish mix that I find at the grocery store. Makes it slightly sweet, not half bad. I've made it twice already!

This was by far the simplest - tastiest - super easy Spanish rice on the planet! I have tried time and time again and they were too salty, scorched on the bottom, no Spanish flavor. I could go on but will save you the boredom. THIS one is easy and did NOT scorch. I did use my Dutch oven on the stove top and stirred quite a bit. *** I added more onion than called for just because I don't want my husband near me and food at the same time (j/k) I ? Onion. I used an authentic quality chunky flavorful salsa - Pass on the Pace - And a Must Must Must - ADD CUMIN! Cumin is a basic Mexican spice that you will thank me for later. Also. It's awesome the next day.

Good quick recipe. The reason I'm not giving it five stars is adding a dash of cayene pepper really elevated the dish (not shown in recipe).

I'm Mexican and this is often my go to Mexican rice dish because it's so easy.  I do know how to make it from scratch with my family's recipe, but this is fool proof and is quicker and easier to make.  NOTE:  I've made this with green salsa in place of the red salsa and it tasted equally good.

This was good, everyone liked it. I had to keep adding water to my rice because the rice wasn't done in the 20 minutes. I will try again adding more liquid in the beginning. But really turned out good after all. Very easy. I like the use of Salsa.

I have been looking for a good Spanish rice recipe for a long time, well I dont have to look any more. I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfect. I just added a half teaspoon of salt. It is better than some of the Spanish rice I get when I go out to eat. It was so easy to make too.

So, I used mild picante instead of salsa (because that's all I had), and EVOO and brown rice because that's all we use.  I had to keep adding water and the recipe took WAAAAAAAAAY longer than directions indicated. -of course, I anticipated it to take a little longer because of the difference in rice, but this was exceptionally longer - like over twice as long.  The flavor was ~ok.  I was excited to switch up our usual plain 'ole rice with our fajitas, and it worked out great, really!  I am interested to see how chunky salsa changes the flavor.  Overall, I LOVE how heart healthy and NATURAL this recipe is.  MUCH better than any store bought package and relatively easy to make.

Made this for guests as a side to chicken enchiladas. Made with brown rice instead of white because it was what I had. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So delicious and so easy! Also made spanish beans with the same basic recipe. Oil, onions, 2 cans of beans (1 black, 1 pink), 1/2 cup salsa, cooked down a little of the liquid, then left in fridge all day to absorb flavor. Got lots of compliments on both. Delicious and inexpensive sides. Beware this makes a LOT of rice. Recipe served 4 people with tons left over. Highly recommended!

Very good recipe.  Only thing I did differently was add 3/4 tsp of chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cumin because I only had mild salsa and thought it might need more flavor.

OMG! This is a great recipe for Spanish rice. My family enjoys it everytime I prepare it. I add about a half cup of ketchup, 1 tsp. of salt sense when I don't use the chicken broth because I don't have any, lol! I use the medium chunky Pace salsa, and 1/2 stick of butter or margrine, only because I have to have it in any rice I cook. I sometime even substitute the onion for dry minced onion when I don't feel like chopping onions. Last but not least i always use the jasmine rice for this recipe. Delisssssh!

Amazing. Even better after you let it settle in the fridge overnight. I also used more onions, garlic, and hot salsa. It was a huge hit at my office potluck!

Thought this was really and surprisingly authentic.  
 
Made some changes  . . . had to increase and adjust the recipe b/c I cut up about a generous half cup each of green and red pepper and onion.  It would have overpowered the 1.5 cups of rice.  Okay, I sauteed the 3 vegetable ingredients in a little olive oil and seasoned w/ little salt and pepper and dash of cumin and chili powder(s).  Once softened and fragrant, I added the (extra) rice, chicken broth and salsa in the order per the recipe.   Once done, I mixed and served with freshly and finely chopped cilantro.  The addition of the cilantro added a huge taste element, in my opinion.  Would make this again, I may try and add a little garlic with the sauteed vegetable mixture though.

Wonderful flavor. My family enjoyed it. I will still make mine from scratch. This is a great recipe when in a bit of a time crunch. I did add garlic and used basmati rice. Was not sticky at all. I will use again and again. Thanks for sharing! :-)

Very easy and tasted great. I'm glad I read the reviews before making this. Several reviewers said there wasn't enough liquid, so I checked it halfway through cooking, and saw that it definitely needed more liquid. I added another cup of broth, and it came out just right and was perfectly done in 20 minutes.

This was really good...and easy.  I won't be buying the packets or boxes of it anymore!   I was lazy and skipped the onion...used onion powder instead.  Added some cumin and a little chili powder.  Updated - added the onion and adobo seasoning (instead of using broth) it is a 5 star recipe

Simple ingredients that I always have in the pantry. Love it! This makes a dang tasty burrito-filler. I also love eating bowls of this rice with plain black beans.

Quite good!  I cooked a little bit longer and the rice was still not quite done.  Close enough though.  It could have used a touch more salsa; I'll do that next time and maybe add some additional spices.  Overall, very good and I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is my favorite spanish rice recipe.  It's easy and takes just a few ingredients.  I always make it as is.  I love to use this recipe to make chicken ranch tacos.  Just crumble up some tortilla chips and top with fajita chicken, this rice, taco toppings, and ranch dressing.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good and I would definitely make it again.  I made half the recipe, but I used the standard rice to water ratio of 3/4 cup rice and 1 1/2 cups broth.  Mine did burn a little on the bottom but that was my fault.  I may have been simmering over too high a heat.  I’ll watch that more carefully the next time.  This is a great and simple recipe that I’ll be repeating!

followed basic recipe, just added  2 cloves of minced garlic after rice was browning, some chili powder, added some cumin, and a little bit of crushed red pepper - no rules set in stone so feel free to experiment, thats why they have cook offs. I used powerded chicken flavoring and I doubt it would be any better if you used homemade - no need to add any xtra salt as processed powders have plenty of it already. I used a generic mild salsa from walmart. Great side dish and very easy to make just make sure to stir often when browning rice and final simmer. I'm not a real heath nut but I've been using plain yogurt insted of sour cream (U won't be able to tell the diff) as a topping, after a generious amount of cheese melted over a tamale or burrito with shreeded lettuce has been applied first - don't forget the refried beans of course!

This is YUMMY! My whole family loved it and wanted seconds. It wasn't too spicy for the kids but it had just enough spice for the adults. This wil be my go to Spainsh rice recipe. I followed the recipe exactly then sprinkled cheddar cheese on top in the serving dish. Loved it!!

Without the salsa this is your basic fried rice recipe, which is very good by itself.  With the salsa added it is spectacular.  I have never had Spanish Rise this good in a restaurant.  I doubled the oil (olive oil), used 1/2 cup of chopped onions and only 1 cup of rice.  Just be sure to check the rice, at about 15 minutes, that is isn't burning on the bottom.  It may look moist and fine on top, but dried out on the bottom.  Can't wait to pair this with our homemade refried beans and tacos!

This recipe is quick and easy and tasty. Onions brown way faster than rice so I never add onions until rice begins to brown.

I had to add 3/4 a cup extra chicken broth and the rice was still a little crunchy for my taste. My husband said he felt that it was perfect. I cooked it for more than 20 min. I added garlic, paprika, and chili powder.

This rice is so simple but so good! I add an extra 1/2 cup of broth as some other suggest, and cook it about 5 minutes longer too. No need to buy the boxed stuff when you've got a recipe this easy!

This rice was great.  I have 2 picky eaters and I didn't hear anything but muffled yums.  I had to make a few changes based upon what I had.  I used Uncle Ben's Brown Rice instead of white, and Newman's Own Mango salsa.  I will definitely make this rice dish again.

Very very good although I didn't follow directions.  Didn't saute anything. Used chicken broth and my homemade salsa. Cooked in microwave 7 min on high and 21 min on med and turned out fantastic.  Might try to saute next time to see the difference. Thanks for the recipe.

I can NEVER get spanish rice to turn out, usually it tastes burnt, or there are pieces of rice that never cooked all the way, this seemed too easy and miraculously it turned out perfect.  My kids were afraid to try it because of past atempts, but happily surprised!!  :)  THANKYOU!!

Great recipe! I agree with another reviewer who said that most people skip sauteing the rice, which is a critical step to the outcome.  

The only issue with this recipe is the amount of liquid needs to be increased as others have noted.

OK, so I don't like rice. I had some Spanish rice made by a Latino woman and was hoping this would taste like hers. Everyone else in the house really liked it, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I might make it again, but will try some others first.

Easiest, cheapest, and best Spanish rice recipe I have tried.  I have found its taste will greatly vary depending on the salsa that you use. I have used regular salsa but have also enjoyed canned tomatoes and chilis. This is my go to crowd pleaser to accompany enchiladas.

Made this tonight, it's after midnight that I'm posting this though.  Anyway, made it Oct. 22nd and I must say, it turned out awesome.  A couple of things, for the liquid, I added 2 2/3 cups of chicken broth. I already knew there was not enough liquid just by reading the recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup of chopped onion, which I sauteed in butter with the rice.  So yes, I did them together, not separate.  ***Note: I did "not" use picante sauce.  Instead, I added about 1 1/2 cups of mild chunky salsa.  Hubby tried it and fell in love with it.  He said I can make this for him anytime.  It cooked up perfectly with a nice flavor.  Will definitely use again.

I kept buying the boxed Mexican/Spanish rice mixes to try to get something like you'd have in a Mexican restaurant, but they were all pretty awful. This recipe really does taste like the stuff from the restaurant! I gave it 4 stars only because you really need an additional 1/2 cup of water or more for the rice to cook properly. I did also add a little taco seasoning, just for flavor.

I made this because of all the rave reviews, but I think it lacked a LOT of flavor.  I did add one extra Cup of broth per other reviewers suggestions of not enough liquid. My rice got perfectly done, was moist and looked good, but tasted bland. I used ChiChi Salsa as I do in all recipes calling for salsa. I cannot say I would make it again. Lacks a great deal in flavor. 
My sister makes great Spanish rice and I know she adds some brown sugar to eat, but I don't know the rest of the recipe. I will ask for hers and make hers going forward. 
Sorry for the mediocre review, but it just was not the best Spanish rice I have had.

Pretty good for how easy this is. 2 cups chicken broth was not enough to fully cook the rice. Next time I will just cook the rice as directed on the package using chicken broth. I added a full jar of salsa, but I think it was too much and 1 cup is plenty. I also used "Medium" salsa and thought it made the rice way to spice, so I will definitely good with mild next time. I will for sure make this again. This rice is way better than any kind you can buy in a box at the store.

Absolutely delicious.  I never add anything to rice when I cook it, so was a little wary about how this was going to turn out.  So glad I did it.  I only had a can of corn/bean salsa on hand.  It worked out really well.  Another keeper!!

Awesome! Cut down on sodium by replacing all chicken broth with water. Also, I only used brown rice and just let it simmer for longer (adding water liberally along the way to keep it from drying). Didn't have chunky salsa like I wanted so threw in a medium sized heirloom tomato (great flavor!) plus a 1/2 c. of medium salsa. Paired with "Summertime Tilapia" from this site and it was AMAZING! All my friends raved about my dinner :)

This was sooo good & super easy to make!!! I will never but boxed spanish rice again! My husband & I can't find a boxed spanish rice we both agree on & like but we both loved this!! The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needed a little more flavor so next time I'll add garlic with the onion & add 1/4 tsp chili powder! But even as is, its really good & went well with salsa chicken from this site for an easy mexican meal!!

I would give this more stars if I could. Absolutely the best spanish rice. I've tried all of the other instant box kinds and never could find one that I liked. This one truly is the best and tastes alot like the kind we eat at the restaurants around here.

I made it as written. It is fairly easy to make, but was very dry and had very little flavor. It also makes a lot...easily serves 6-8 people. I'll try a different recipe next time.

I must have "browned" the rice too long because a) I had to cook the rice way longer than 20 minutes and b) I still ended up with grains that were crunchy.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the flavor of the dish.  As others mentioned, I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of water after the 20 minutes, as there was not enough liquid left to keep cooking the rice the additional time it needed.  I added some cooked shredded chicken at the end and made a meal of it.  I will make this again, but I will not "brown" the rice at all.  Also, this may have made a difference in how much I liked this: I added a bit of cayenne and cumin at the end - it added the perfect amount of zip.  I give three stars because of the directions to brown the rice and the not-enough-liquid.

This was ok. It took more broth than what the recipe called for and it makes WAY more than 5 servings. I think next time I will use only 1 cup of uncooked rice and keep everything else the same for cooking that will take 20 minutes and not longer and for more flavor. Hopefully this will fix the problems I had.

My first attempt at spanish rice..Result: Pretty darn tasty, like authentic spanish rice. My alterations: Used chicken bouillon to prepare broth & added tomato bouillon (I heart tomato flavor) also added about 1/2 cup more water to this to help steam rice at the end (I always prepare my white rice 3:1 anyway) Truly enjoyed this!

Personally, I do not like Spanish rice but my husband does.  This is a perfect, quick and easy recipe for me to prepare for him.  It was simply to make only one serving.  I was unsure whether he would enjoy it as it appeared so basic but it got rave reviews!

I served this with cheese enchiladas and I thought it was pretty good.I did add some chopped red pepper along with the onion.I also added a little cumin and chili powder.Mine was done after 20 minutes but it had soaked up all the liquid and was sticking a bit so I added about a half cup more broth.I think next time I'll half the recipe because it made way too much for us.

The people who said you need more liquid are right.  I cut the rice by half cup and still needed mor liquid.  I like the recipe and will try again.  Also, browning the rice ...perhaps I didn't do that long enough.

This is a quick and easy spanish rice! I love the recipe and anyone I sereve it to always says, "This is so good, I bet it was hard to make!" Nope it's the easiest side dish I have ever made. I like to make my own homemade salsa. Such a great recipe, I can't stress that enough! Thanks!

This rice is to die for! I switched it up a little bit by adding some diced carrots and minced garlic to the onions and let them cook and added 2 cups of rice with the chicken broth and 1/2 cup extra of water, plus a few spices. Luckily, I had my Dad's homemade salsa on hand and that sealed the flavors. This is absolutely delicious though!!! Thank you!!

Liked this a lot. Have been looking for something to go with the tacos other than white rice or rice with chicken broth.  Used a combo of turkey stock and chicken bouillion.  WILL make this again if I have time to make the rice.

I was looking for something different to compliment my baked fish and this was perfect.  I only made a few adjustments and it turned out great!  I make my rice in a rice cooker and I only use premium Indian basmati rice (turns out perfect every time).  So for this recipe I used 2 cups of rice to 3 cups of chicken broth.  I also added a bunch of cilantro and one goya packet to the mix.  Cooked up perfect in 30 minutes..nice tender, flaky rice.....YUM!

I just made this recipe following the directions and it turned out great!  I did bring the chicken broth, salsa, onion, and rice to a boil before covering, reducing heat to simmer for 20 minutes though.  I think the originator of the recipe just left that part out, but meant well.  If you have cooked rice, then you know to do this. This recipe would also be good with some browned/drained ground beef with it..that's how my mom always makes it with the ground beef added.

This has got to be the easiest spanish rice recipe I have ever made.  We really liked it.  The only thing that I did different was use butter instead of oil and added 1/2 tsp of cumin and chile powder for a little more spice.

It turns out pretty much perfect every time. I may or may not have to add a little more liquid to the rice after the 20 minutes, but make sure you saute the rice until it is clear, after adding the liquid and other ingredients bring the pan to a boil, then turn the heat down to low (just enough to keep a simmer) and cover.  Don't remove the lid to check.  After 20 minutes, remove from heat and let stand about 5-10 minutes longer.  I have pans with glass lids so I can see how much liquid is left.    This is not much different than the directions on how to make rice-a-roni and I never had problems with it.  Don't keep it on high heat or the liquid will boil out too quickly and the rice won't have a chance to cook properly.

This was soooo easy!  Mine turned out fine with the amount of salsa listed, but if yours is super chunky (i.e. has less liquid) you might need more.  I agree that the 2 T of onion is pointless - you'll need to add much more to notice it.  We used water instead of chicken broth to accommodate the resident vegetarians, and I added some garlic salt.

This was really good. I used chipotle salsa and diced up two chipotles to go into it, otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Very easy and delicious.

I've been looking for a good Spanish Rice recipe for quite some time and I think I have finally found the one for me!  I try to avoid boxed/processed foods whenever I can but that often means a time consuming, labor intensive alternative when made from scratch.  This recipe produced a moist, flavorful, slightly spicy rice that was delicious!  I used a medium heat jarred salsa and the rest were fresh ingredients so I know it did not have any preservatives or unhealthy additives.  Plus it was just as easy, if not easier to prepare as the boxed variety.  This one goes into my binder of Family Favorite Recipes!!!!

Once I used brown rice, and literally added THREE more cups of (boiling) water as the cooking progressed.  Also, the brown rice takes about 80 minutes on my stove.  Just fyi, in case anyone else wants to make it with brown rice.  I've made this recipe "as is" with white rice, and the flavor is phenomenal!!!  Last night, I used white rice and instead of chicken broth, I used this tomato/chicken bullion from the Hispanic food aisle.  Outrageously good!!

very good! Only important added not (as I see others have also done,) Use PACE PICANTE. Do not use a cheap no name brand. It really makes a huge difference in flavor. I've made this 3 times and the one time I didn't use the name brand salsa it came out really bland and just not good.

Very good...my husband said it taste like authentic mexican cooking :) I did substitue brown rice for the white rice and had to cook the dish for about an hour and I also chopped up some red and oragne bell peppers and sauted with the onion. I will NEVER buy a boxed spanish rice again!!! Thanks for a great easy recipe.

This was so good & delightfully simple! I used chicken bullion cubes because I never have broth on hand. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the onion & rice as it was sauteing, a handful of frozen corn and a 1/4 cup or so of chopped green bell pepper before I put the lid on to steam. I'll keep coming back to this one again and again as a yummy side dish. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, it tastes exactly like the rice served in authentic mexican restaurants. I made the recipe as directed except added 1/2 cup additional water, and the rice turned out the perfect consistency. The only thing I would change next time is to add more salsa. The rice was just a touch blander than I would like. This is definitely the best spanish rice recipe I have ever made, though.

This rice has outstanding flavor and texture. I use brown basmati rice and add about 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. chili powder. As previously mentioned, make sure to brown the rice first.   This recipe is easily doubled, and is a great choice for a do-ahead side dish...it tastes as good, if not better, rewarmed!

I make this recipe all the time. Super easy to make and tastes great. I always have to add more liquid and cook it for an extra 10 minutes. If you follow the recipe exactly, it will burn on the bottom and the rice will be undercooked.

Very good- my husband would definitely eat again- his complaint was it was a little dry- Next time I will add more tomatoes when rice is done (This is the way we make "shrimp perloo" ,which my family has made forever,- I was taught to add your tomato product when rice was done or it would toughen your rice)- I used "rotel" (tomatoes with chiles)- added salt, pepper, garlic- flavor developed when dish sat a while- thanks-

We really enjoyed this rice, very easy to make.  I added a bit of cumin and chili powder and increased the liquid by 1/2 cup.

This is restaurant style spanish rice, not the sticky, soupy stuff my mom always made.  The grains separate from each other and it is not overwhelmed by tomatoes.  Perfect!

best and easiest! I have made spanish rice from scratch before and this tastes just as good and there's no chopping. I usually only use 1 cup of rice so we don't end up with too many leftovers. I use 2 cups of stock and 3/4 cup pace salsa.

So good. Followed the first review and browned the rice prior to adding the broth and once the rice and broth came to a boil I covered and left until the timer rang then turned off the fire and waited 5+ minutes before looking. I will definately be adding this to my side dishes for mexican food. The left over rice I put into a ziploc bag and put into the freezer.

We are living in Russia and so I've had to make most everything from scratch lately!  We love Tex-Mex food and so I tried this rice recipe and it is fabulous.  It has the best flavor!  My husband and family love it - I've made it 3 times already, so now it is a staple with our Mexican dishes.

This is simple, great and just like the local taco shop's!  Be careful, though if you sub brown rice for the white, as I did.  Check the bag ,  because my brown rice called for 3 cups of water per cup of rice.

I made this to use as filling for meatless stuffed peppers (I usually use a box mix but wanted something without all the additives) but we devoured it before I had a chance to prep the peppers! YUM!  

Slight modifications:  Used just 1 TBLSPN Olive Oil to cut down on calories, 4 TBSPNS of Onion (we like onion!) and a clove of minced garlic.  I used a Southwest style salsa I had on hand so the black beans and corn in it was a nice addition. Also used veggie broth instead of chicken and added a few shakes of chili powder & cumin.  

Thanks for the recipe, I plan on making my own spanish rice from now on!

Yum!  I modified this recipe just a bit as well.  I used brown rice instead of white and added 3c. of vegetable broth instead of  chicken broth because I'm vegetarian.  Added in a bit of chili powder, cumin & garlic powder to the onion mixture and this turned out superb!  I do recommend a much longer cooking time for brown rice.  It takes closer to an hour so be patient.

This is a really good and easy rice. I didn't use the 2T of onions cause the kids won't eat them and I figured the salsa would be pushing it! But they loved it and so did I. I will definately make this again! Thanks!

This is almost exactly how my family has made spanish rice for the past 20 years, we actually got it from a spanish family. The only difference is the salsa, try using a can of diced tomatos with green chilis, it's way better than the salsa. To actually make this a dinner dish, BBQ chicken (no sauce), cut it into pieces and add to the rice. It's very yummy.

I'm so pleased with this recipe I couldn't wait to post a review! I was looking for something quick and easy and this just seemed too easy to actually be good, but boy was I wrong!  I made it tonight and it tasted wonderful and I got rave reviews.  I followed the ingredients exactly, but after slightly browning the rice with the onions, I threw that into the rice cooker, along with the broth and salsa (used Taco Bell Chunky Medium Salsa), and let it do it's thing.  Came out perfect!  I highly recommend both this recipe and the use of a rice cooker to make it.  Will most definitely make this a regular recipe in my home.

MY aunt was visiting from Mexico and she said this is pretty much how she makes her rice.  The only difference is she adds water to the rice after browning it, then after that is absorbed, she adds the salsa.  Make sure the salsa has a lot of onion, garlic, and cilantro for the best flavor.

I love this recipe but i edited it a lot. Its good the way it is. But i use Tomato sauce instead of salsa and i only use half. I use and extra half cup of chicken broth. I like to add red peppers, corn, and a 1/3 of a Jalopeno pepper. Its just like the restaurants around here!

Excellent spanish rice recipe!  I increased the chicken broth to 2 1/2 cups and added corn.  Like others mentioned, be sure and bring to a boil before covering and reducing heat.

This is SO easy!  The flavor is great and you can switch it up a little just by using different types of salsa.  I used brown rice instead of white and added a 1/2 cup extra chicken broth to account for the heartier rice.  It came out perfect and my family loved it.

This dish was good the first night I served it.  However, the leftovers the second day were exceptional. I did add more tomatoes to the leftovers but I credit the marinading of the flavors for the improved taste. With a few extra canned tomatoes, this dish is a great source of lycopene and it is especially healthy if you use brown rice and olive oil. Karen H's recommendations were on the money -- don't over sauté the rice or the garlic and you will end up with a tasty rice side dish.  Thanks Angie.

Mmmm!  This was great even though I didn't add any onion or enough chicken broth. My mom and dad loved this.  I used to work at Taco Del Mar, and this rice would taste GREAT in burritos. Try them!

I LOVE this recipe. Quick & easy! My family loves it, and I made a gigantic amount for a birthday party (using the site's recipe converter) and it came out perfect.

great rice! I made it for a camping potluck. I did add more chicken broth and 1/2 a can of mild enchilada sauce and a sm. can of corn. There wasn't any leftover. Thank you Angie.

A very simple recipe - delicious, too. By choosing the heat level on your salsa, you can make your rice more or less spicy. I prepared it earlier in the day and then warmed it up in the micorwave before serving.

My whole family loved this recipe. It tasted just like what would be served in an authentic resturant.  I will be using this recipe again and again, thanks so much. I did increase the salsa for some added flavor.

I liked this recipe better the second time I made it.  I used 2 cups broth instead of 1 1/2 and added some canned corn and a little enchilada sauce.  The rice came out much more tender and it had a little more flavor.  Overall this is a very easy recipe and can be easily changed to meet personal tastes.  Thanks.

I spent YEARS looking for the right Spanish rice recipe.  This is it!

The key is finding the right salsa - it makes all the difference. (Even if I like the salsa on it's own, sometimes it doesn't work well in this recipe) It's worth trying multiple brand to find the right one.

Also, get your chicken broth boiling before you put it in the rice - it gives it the perfect Mexican restaurant texture! (I microwave it in a measuring cup - but be careful of the steam as you pour it in the skillet)

Really great recipe. I quartered a full Spanish onion instead of chopped or diced, I added a clove of garlic after adding the broth, and after the rice was done, I cut up two cooked chicken breasts into strips and laid them on top of the rice, covered it with a mixture of shredded mild cheddar, white cheddar, and Havarti, then threw the skillet into 350 degree oven until cheese melted. I added cilantro before serving and also topped with sliced avocado. Yum!

This was very easy to make. I didnt have chunky salsa on hand and used regular salsa but it still tasted great. I do think next time I will grab the chunky salsa. Thank you so much for the recipe, I will definitely make this again. Flavorful and easy.

Super easy recipe. I used a can of petite diced stewed tomato's with jalapeno. I will use more onion the next time I make it and add some corn and maybe dice up some fire roasted jalapeno. But this was a great recipe to get me started. Never had made Spanish Rice before and we enjoyed it with our Chicken Fajitas and fresh guacamole.

I gave this a 3 star because of how easy it was to make.  I made it exactly as is.  I really didn't care too much for it.  I thought it was rather bland and tasteless.  I should have done what some of the other reviewers suggested and added some cumin to it.  Will do that next time if I ever try it again.  Or maybe a different brand of salsa.  Also was thinking on using a chile verde sauce instead of the salsa.

Loved it! I did make a few changes due to what ingredients I had on hand though. I was cooking for a group so I doubled the recipe and used canned fire roasted tomatos w/garlic  and some diced fresh jalapenos, pepper,  chili powder and cumin. I sauted the jalapenos with the onion before adding the rice to brown. then added the chicken broth, diced tomatoes and spices. turned out perfect.

Wonderful! Hubs went back for more and really loaded up his plate!!! Only one minor issue. Rice wasn't done on time and had to add some extra water. I believe that if I had brought the mixture to a boil before putting the lid on it would have worked. I will do that next time, and there will be a next time!!! Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!!!

This was very easy, the rice wasn't sticky and it tasted pretty good. I did add 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1teaspoon salt and I used butter to sauté the onion and rice. I used mild pace picante sauce (because my BF is a wimp when it comes to spicy). Next time around I will use a full teaspoon of cumin and then I think it will be just right.

Cook the rice with the chicken stock in the amount of the water required in the directions on the rice packet. Before I did this, I had under cooked rice.

loved it! easy and delicious - FINALLY i can make something that tastes like the spanish rice when we go out to eat!
i've made this according to directions, several times, here are my observations:
1. no need to start the onion first.  just add it with the rice in the beginning.  sautee them both together for about 10 minutes, until the rice is well coated and browning.
2. sauteing the rice definitely makes a difference! i forgot to do it once, and was disappointed with the stickiness of that batch.
3. changing the salsa completely changes the flavor! our favorite is pace picante sauce (medium).

I loved this recipe and so did the family (ages 10-48).  So easy!  I did omit the onion since I knew there was onion in the salsa.  I think the key is to saute the rice in oil first.  I let it get nearly brown and then added the broth and salsa.  This is my go to spanish/mexican rice from now on.  No more box mix needed :)

So simple to make,  but a little bland. Adding a little salt made it much better! I also added a little frozen corn. Would probably be good with some black beans in it too. I was afraid that jasmine rice wouldn't work (which was all I had), but it was great. And be advised that it makes a huge amount. It would be nice if the amount of servings were given at the beginning or the end of the recipe. Was just c cooking for my husband and I, so we had a lot of leftovers.

So, I was in a hurry and found this recipe to be the quickest version of Spanish Rice I could find. Though skeptical that something this easy could taste like the "real thing," I am pleasantly surprised at how tasty it is. I included fresh pico de gallo with the salsa and may add a little cumin the next time I make it, but this is a good "as is" recipe.

This recipe is fantastic as is which is why I gave it five stars.  What I also love about this recipe is that it is very versatile. I will sometimes throw in a few add-ins such as corn, black beans, and diced cooked meat. I've also added Chipotle powder, garlic powder, and a little splash of liquid smoke. It also works well with minute rice (be sure to reduce the amount of liquid by half a cup or more and it cooks much faster, so watch that).  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe. It is a regularly requested dish in my home.

It turned out better than I expected. I used Jasmine rice instead, and used vegetable broth. I had to add more than 2 cups because the rice wasn't cooked all the way. I used 32oz of broth. I will definitely make this again.

I needed a spanish rice recipe to bring to a potluck. This recipe was easy to make. I hope it tastes as good as it smells.

I was really prepared not to like this.....living in New Mexico and all.  But it was really, really good.  Had to add more chicken broth as I went, and I started with 2.5 cups, not the recommended 2.  But we are at a mile high elevation, so sometimes that is expected.  I used Pace Picante Medium sauce.  Also, added chopped green pepper with the onion, and more onion.  2 Tbsp., like some other reviewers said, is hardly worth it.  Half a chopped onion, half a chopped green pepper. Otherwise, followed the recipe, including the browning of the rice. This is Mexican restaurant worthy.

Finally! A spanish rice that comes out perfect! I've failed a number of times to make spanish rice that doesn't come out sticky. This recipe made my husband a believer that I can, in fact, nail spanish rice! Thank you!

Great recipe, however, the goal for me is healthier eating so I used 1 cup of brown rice and 1/2 of white rice.  To accommodate for the brown rice I used an additional 2 cups of chicken broth(homemade). Perfect!

This was so good and so easy! I only had white jasmine rice on hand so that's what I used along with green onions. I used a medium salsa and it gave the dish a little bite! I'll have to try it with brown rice next time. YUM!

I cheated with success rice, and than added the broth and salsa, accordingly. This is so easy and yet has a nice freshness to it as opposed to the pre packaged rice. Another thing that is a plus, is you control the heat you like by your choice of salsa. Thank You for Sharing

This has the potential to be a great recipe. I tasted a little too much chicken broth and it made the taste a lil overbearing. Instead perhaps I'll add more salsa. I used fresh salsa and I liked that. Perhaps I'll use a combination of salsas and less broth.

We didn't like this at all. We don't usually eat jarred salsa so maybe that's why it tasted odd but we thought this tasted like packaged food not homemade.

I REALLY, REALLY liked this one. Totally awesome and it was so quick to get the point I could walk away and make the rest of my dinner. I guess I made it to early for over roasting my chicken but it warmed back up well. It was delicious with some taco shells and marinated chicken. Yum!

Mine didn't turn out, because I barely undercooked the rice. Took it off too early for fear of it burning. My fault, not the recipe's. What WAS edible, tasted great.

This recipe is easy and tasty! I have a habit of making sticky rice, so I soaked my rice for 30 minutes before cooking. Some commenters said this recipe is too bland, but its a basic rice recipe that is perfect for seasoning to your own taste.

I really like this.  Its yummy but easy and the simmering time is perfect for getting the rest of dinner and the table set.  I followed the recipe to the letter and see no reason to change it.   My only comment is that you want to be sure to use a salsa that you really like.   It will make the dish for you.

It REALLY doesn't get much easier than this, folks! I have a hard time cooking rice and it came out just fine. I'd love to try this with brown rice to see if it comes out just as good. It came out slightly under done (crispy) so I will turn it down a little next time. Perfect side to enchiladas!

Browning the rice for about ten minutes before adding the liquids really does make a difference in how fluffy it turns out in the end! Good recipe!

I made this at a work party for a large group, so we scaled up the recipe and it still turned out great!  The cooking time had to be adjusted until all the liquid was absorbed, but this was easy to monitor, so not a big deal.  This is very simpler to make, and easy to customize, such as different types of salsa based on how spicy you like it.  It keeps for a few days, so you can make a large batch and have it for a few days, too.  A great side or base for many other options!

I liked this recipe. I love the fact that it can be VERY versatile just by changing what salsa you use. I didn't follow the instructions exactly like I should have and suffered from undercooked rice, but by my own impatience. I look forward to making this again and doing it right next time. Thank you!

This was nice and simple. I used Thai jasmine rice and fresh salsa (from the grocery store). I followed the directions exactly and got perfect results: fluffy rice. Maybe next time I'll add some minced garlic, but that's just a personal preference. This does make a lot and a family of four will have leftovers. I estimated that this makes about 9 servings (1/2 cup servings, about 94 calories each).

Overall I think this is a great recipe. I have made this Spanish rice twice now and changes up a little bit the second time around. I think the changes added a little bit more flavor. I followed the recipe above, Substituting the 2 tablespoons of oil for butter. And then added an 1/8 teaspoon of ground mustard. I really liked these changes. Next time I would like to use brown rice or a mix of brown and white rice.

I think that this rice is good. It is quick, but it feels like it is missing some of the flavor you normally get in a Spanish rice. I have made it a few times now and I just add hot sauce and some sour cream when I am eating it.

I loved this. I used the left over salsa/chicken juice from making the Slow Cooker Lime Cilantro Chicken recipe from this site and it turned out amazing. This is a sticky rice, which wasn't what I was looking for but was great regardless.

I loved the recipe, it worked out great. But, because I love that taste of garlic in my Spanish rice, I added some and it was perfect for me.It was so easy to make :-)

This Spanish rice was delicious! I must admit that I had to modify it to use some tomatoes from my garden. I replaced the salsa with 2cups of cooked tomatoes  and McCormick's Mexican seasoning, and garlic. I used 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of long grain rice. I used  green pepper instead of onion. I made it a meal by add,ing browned lean ground beef and simmering it all for 20 minutes. I let it with the lid on for another 5 minutes ..... My husband loved it !

This is a great Spanish Rice recipe that is extremely easy. I only had a half cup of salsa so I used a half cup of grape tomatoes (cut in half lengthwise)to make up for the rest. I paired this side dish with pork carnitas and dinner was a huge hit.

Loved the recipe but made a slight change.  I added some bell pepper to it because I didn't have salsa.  In place of the salsa, I used V-8 juice!  Still gave us the tomato taste and the peppers and onions took care of some of the salsa veggies.

I've used this recipe at least a dozen times now...it's fantastic! I add whatever vegetables I have on hand when I'm first starting out...kind of like a stir fry, then add rice, then follow recipe. 

THANK YOU!!!!!

This worked well for me as a starting point.  To make it for those of us who don't each chicken, I used a vegetable soup starter in water, pre-mixed before adding to the dish.  I also reduced the amount of rice (and water proportionally).

To make a complete meal in the one pan, I added medium-thinly-cut (1/4" - 1/2") tuna steaks to the pan when it began to simmer.  When the rice was done, so was the tuna.  Use fresh tuna fillets; not canned tuna!

BTW, I added garlic but I doubt I would have tasted the difference given the salsa's flavor dominated.

I made this to go with chicken burritos and now we do not have the burritos without this rice.  It is the best rice I have made or have had at a Mexican restaurant.  Also is the easiest to make and I usually have everything it calls for.  Just follow the recipe.. no reason to change a thing!!!

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time I made this dish I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!!  The second time I made it I wanted to make it a bit healthier so I left out the chicken broth.  This made a big difference and was not near as good!

Pretty darn good. Very easy. I've been wanting a good Spanish rice recipe. Made it for a dinner party and it was a hit. My stove runs hot, so I really had to monitor it and couldn't cook it as long as needed, but with rest it turned out fine. I like the fact that you can change it up with different salsas, tonight it was a little spicy. I do believe the browning of the rice does something to it. I will make it again and again.

This is a great quick and easy Spanish rice recipe. I have made this dish several times in a few different ways that also came out just as good. I have substituted the rice for quinoa which came out great as well. I tend to add Serrano peppers because we like a bit of spice. Thanks for posting this recipe it was great.

Easy Recipe, easy clean up, easy crowd pleaser. What more can you ask for? Made this for Mexican night, added a dash of cumin and chile powder for a kick. You can also add some garlic. I'll definitely make it again!

Great recipe - made it exactly as instructed, used a good quality Mexican salsa and also added a clove of garlic after sautéing the onions. Surprisingly easy and delicious, definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe. I did make a few adjustments though. Instead of white rice i used brown rice. (to be healthier) I also used onion soup powder instead of onions (picky eater) but it was still amazing. I enjoyed it all and will be using this recipe again.

I made this using Minute rice (the only thing I had on hand), I increased the rice to 3 C. (as minute rice cooks up 1c dry = 1c cooked), added a Tablespoon of taco seasoning and cooked for only about 10 minutes....The best spanish rice I have ever had, definately better than a restaurant.

Maybe it's just me.., but this was too little liquid and the rice wouldn't soften up, even after adding more water.

Wow. I have never made home made Spanish rice before and can't believe how simple it was. Served this with the slower cooker Carnita recipe from this site and we loved it. Will definitely use this from now on instead of the box stuff.

This is a great recipe given it's simplicity. I'm a compulsive modifier though, so I added a couple of garlic cloves when sautéing the onions. I also added approximately a 1/2 tsp of cumin after adding the broth and salsa as well as 1 tsp of dried cilantro for a more authentic Mexican flavor. But this is an excellent recipe just as it is.

Ive been preparing  this recipe for years.  As stated in other reviews if you like your dishes on the bland side follow the recipe to a tee.  If you want ot kick it up a notch all that needed is a little seasoning such as cummin, taco seasoning or just plan ole johnny's seasoning salt.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper and it a great side dish for any mexican meal.

I made this tonight for supper with green chile chicken enchiladas. It is just right! Easy and tasty!!  Browning the rice slightly seemed to work well! I did add a bit more
 broth to the rice before simmering. 2 C wasn't enough rice seemed crunchy after 20 min. I added another 1/2 C and cooked another 10 min. and everything was great!

Wonderful and easy recipe. I upped the onion because we love onion, and added chili powder and paprika. Took a star away because the recipe should have called for more seasoning

Warning: be very careful when doubling the recipe - your water quantities might be different. To be honest, I wouldn't double it - I don't think it works as well.

Since finding this gem of a recipe, I have made it numerous times and never tire of it. As I don't care for spicy foods, I use mild salsa when making for myself. If friends are coming over and they like spicy, I use hot salsa for them and make another batch for myself with mild. To make a very quick meal, I slice Oscar Meyer turkey sausage, which is fully cooked, and add to the rice. Add a salad and crusty bread and voila, dinner in a jiffy. You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Delicious and easy. To keep it fresh I put a tomato in the blender and used fresh tomato puree instead of salsa from a jar. Also, I found that if I use water instead of chicken broth, need to add salt. I let it simmer on low for about 30 minutes and it came out perfect.

This recipe was super easy, very good and probably the best spanish rice I have made. Much better than the prepared packet I was thinking of using. And I thought it was as good and even better than rice I've had at some of the local mexican restaraunts.

Dry and flavorless. Made exactly as written, but found it to be lacking. Guests were adding extra salsa and cheese. If I make it again I'll make changes.

This is THE best rice I've tasted by far!!! Didn't have chicken broth so I made my own, boiling 2 cups of water and added 1 chicken bouillon cube and let it sit for about 5 minutes. I did listen to another review stating after adding the liquid to bring it to a boil. SERIOUSLY this is AMAZING!!! I'm from the Middle East and this is even better then my Arabic rice YUMMY! Served this with fish tacos and my homemade avocado salad :)

This is the best Spanish rice.  I have been making only this now for the past year.  No more boxed mixes for us.  You can vary the salsa to your tastes.  I've tried many different types and it always turns out.  You don't have to use chicken broth.  Most of the time I use water, just salt the onions, sauté the rice and salt the rice when you add the liquid.  This rice is BETTER than what our local Mexican restaurants serve!!!

This is pretty good rice. I used brown rice to make it a little healthier.

I love this recipe.  I first made it years ago, and then I lost it and couldn't find it again for a few years.  Luckily, it is simple enough that could pretty much fake it. I took the precaution of adding it to my recipe box this time. 
After I make it, I like to layer it with shredded cheddar, and put a few dollops of greek yogurt on top. Put some grilled chicken breast chunks in too, and you have a great casserole. YUM!

Excellent,I really loved the rice...I used Pace Medium Salsa and it was good. I recommend this recipe to everyone...hint, I found when making this, is to turn off the rice with a little bit of broth left and leave it covered until ready to serve...fluff with fork

This rice was amazing! I've always eaten Spanish rice but never really cared for it. I raved over this one, and I am my biggest critic. The kids even liked it. I browned the rice in butter. It still ended up very soft, not hard as others claimed and I truly cooked mine to a med golden brown. I used fresh garlic and because I had homegrown tomatoes and a green pepper, used that on top of the required amount of salsa. I agree that pepper is also needed. I was very skeptical about this tasting like jar salsa mixed with rice, but the chicken broth adds a unique, wonderful flavor and you would never know how simple this recipe actually is. I have found my keeper recipe!

SOOO easy and delicious!  I throw cooked brown rice into the oil--my kids can't even tell the difference and it is so good for them!  I love to make double or triple the recipe because it keeps so well and use it in lunches--we seriously have this rice at one supper a week!

This was a great recipe, but there was one very important step missing.  You should let the liquids come to a boil once you add the salsa and broth, and then cover and simmer.  I think this may be why a lot of people had hard rice.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles and less salsa.  It came out perfectly!

Really good rice. I was having a hard time with consistency. When I saw this recipe it was perfect. The second time around I used one fresh diced tomato, one table spoon of knorr, and one chicken bouillon cube. Came out pretty good. Our 11 month old baby loved it too. I recommend this to anyone that loves spanish rice.

Great recipe. Tried it with brown rice which gave it more texture. I recommend adding a few cloves of minced garlic to give it a more Latin flavor.

I used this as a base recipe for Spanish rice. I added cumin, cilantro and chili powder to it. With those changes made it was excellent. I also incresed the amount of chicken broth to 3 cups. Very tasty!

This really was very tasty and couldnt be easier. Great basic recipe, I appreciate all the reviews and great rating, Im sure the recipe is fine as is but altered it to my taste, I like flavor! I sliced 1/2 jalapeno, added chopped garlic, more onions and chopped shallots, traders has that already chopped so I added about 1/3 c of this mixture and added a bit more chunky salsa, a dash of lawrys seasoning salt and 1/2 tsp taco seasoning. I forgot to rinse the rice so it was a "bit" more sticky than I like but I will definitely make this recipe again.

5/9/16: Made this again with BASMATI rice. Made sure to SAUTE rice this time. Didn't have chicken broth  so used some vegetable broth stock I had in freezer.  Had to add a cup of water with chicken bouillon to integrate some salt. Also added onion powder, seasoning salt, a SMIDGE of garlic salt and On the Border chunky salsa-medium. It was much better this time around. 

2013:  I had to add some onion powder to liven this up a bit.  Also, I used Rotel instead of salsa.

I used Basmati rice and it came out nice and fluffy.  I feel that it could have had a little more kick to it but overall it was a family hit.

Excellent accompaniment to our steak tacos!   Except for using a whole small onion, I followed directions AND timing exactly.   Yes, the rice is not sticky or fluffy like we gringos are used to but it is very, tasty.   Will definitely make this easy and delicious dish again.  Thanks for sharing.

Since I found this recipe, it is the only Spanish rice we have. All the kids love it. I always add a little garlic salt and some groung cumin.

Really good simple and tasty rice dish that some of us put in tacos and others eat alongside tacos.  The rice/liquid ratio is incorrect.  I believe the recipe should read 3 cups of chicken broth (or vegetable broth in my case since one of us is a vegetarian).

I love this recipe.  It's so easy.  I'm not that great in the kitchen and I have never been able to make rice, so I cheat and use Minute Rice. I just don't cook it as long. I also don't brown the rice, but I do stir it around in the skillet before I add the stock and salsa.  During the summer I add some extra bell peppers from my garden.  I also substitute vegetable stock for the the chicken stock since I follow a vegan diet.

I thought it looked like something easy for a large group, and I had to cook for 15 last weekend.  I served this alongside enchiladas and everyone loved it!  This would be an easy recipe to customize by adding different types of salsa and/or your own spices.  I kept this simple and followed the recipe exactly, but next time I'll experiment a little more.

This was pretty good. Followed the recipe with the exception of the onion...didn't have one. Also, I don't use white rice only brown so ours was nuttier in flavor and took much longer to cook. The overall result was pretty good. I used an organic bell pepper salsa that wasn't too spicy for my kids. We all agreed that it was pretty good. I may try a few other recipes because although this was perfectly fine, it wasn't quite what I want in the realm of authentic spanish rice. But good, nonetheless.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed it as written and it turned out fine. The second time I made it, I added about 1/2 cup of the onion and a dash of cumin. Just before serving I added about 3 tbsp of chopped green onions (just the green part) and gave it a quick stir. My fussy kids liked it better the second time.

Absolutely DELICIOUS...the only thing I did was add 1/4 tsp of chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cumin. Made this when I made Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas and my family loved it. Said it tasted as good...if not better than most Mexican restaurants. This will be my "go to" Spanish Rice recipe!!

Tasty but I had to add more broth in order to get the rice to cook fully.  The first time I made it using only 2 cups of broth as written, the rice was still a little crunchy.

This tastes really authentic.  I used brown rice which required more liquid and a little more cook time but otherwise didn't change a thing.

This was one of the best Spanish rice recipes I have made and it was also one of the easiest. Will definitely make it again.  I added some extra chicken broth because the rice was not soft enough and also used picante instead of the salsa. Next time, I will add some corn and peas  to give it some more color.

Followed recipe with more onion and some red bell pepper and Garlic.  Added a little bit more liquid.  Brought to full rolling boil before turning down to simmer.  Tasted it.  It was Ok, but not very authentic tasting.  Added Chili powder and cumin, put it over the top.  Was great, but I feel cumin and chili powder are vital to making this dish work.  Used medium picante, which was to spicy for my son.  If your not a fan of spicy, would rec. mild salsa/picante.  I think mild salsa would have been closer to authentic, but I liked the spice.  This is my first time making spanish rice.  I feel with the additions that I made it is a thousand times better than those bags you buy at the store! Great, easy base recipe!

It was amazing, but I fried the rice first before adding the diced onion and then continued to fry the onions adding some cumin aand black pepper and cayanne, It was so yummy me and my husband loved it.

This is so easy and the taste is just like many Mexican restaurants in our area.  I did have a little trouble getting the rice cooked thoroughly even after saute-ing (sp?) it with the onion in the beginning of the cooking process.  I agree that this recipe needs a little more liquid but only just a tiny amount, perhaps a tablespoon or two.  Also, I feel it needs a little more zip to it and I may add chili powder and/or cumin next time.  Overall, a great recipe!

I don't know about the "best", but it is simple and good. There is a fine line between undercooked rice and mushy and I added a bit more chicken broth toward the end.

This really is the best spanish rice recipe. Easiest and tastiest one I have ever found.  When i first took it out of the pot the rice was a little crunchy. I put it in a closed tupperware container and by the time i got it to the potluck,  the rice had steamed to perfection. Will make this many many times again.

This is a great and simple recipe :) I only added a packet of goya sazon to be different.. Mmm soo good. My only thing was my rice was a bit wet? Could have been my fault but was still yummy.

I love making this and have done it by the recipe.  Most of the time I don't keep salsa on hand, so I simply add a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies for that wonderful bite!  Will even make it a main dish by adding hamburger and can't resist adding a whole onion instead of just a couple of tablespoons.

I usually make my own Spanish Rice but was never all that pleased with it.  I came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  Definately 5 stars - because it's so easy and most people have all the ingredients on hand.  The only change I made was that I also added fresh minced garlic with the onion.  It was definately a hit with my smothered burritos, my company loved it.

this was a good recipe tho i did change some things. didn't use onion, or the salsa. instead i blended a can of fire roasted tom chunks with cilantro and used that with the chicken broth. before simmering i added some parsley flakes. turned out fantastic and the man of the house is obsessed!

way better then the packages you get at the store...and much better for since you can control what's going it . i did use instant brown rice though since that what i had in my pantry.  i did step on as in the recipe but followed the box direction to cook the rice.  it turned out perfect.  oh and i added a little taco seasoning for a jolt of flavor!

I had to make some sacrifices to this but it turned out excellently.  I did not have salsa so I used the sauce in a taco dinner kit and some stewed tomatoes.  Also threw in a garlic clove to add to the flavor that would be lacking from not having salsa.  Came out beautifully. Just added a dash of sea salt.

I made this recipe and do agree to brown the rice first it really complements the taste of it. I followed the insturctions but added el pato sauce to make it extra spciy. I ran out of time and didn't have enough time to keep checking the rice so I took everything in the pot and threw it in the rice cooker and amazingly enough it was great! I have cooked it both ways now and love them both. Great recipe.

Oh yeah!  Great flavor!!  I didn't have any chick broth, so I used leftover veggie broth (Wolfgang Puck) which was 1 cup and filled the rest with water.  I sauteed about 1/4 cup onions, added about a tsp of chopped garlic and DID saute the rice about 3-4 minutes but not until it became brown.  Added the liquid and my fave salsa and it turned out fabulous!  The taste, texture and appearance was worthy of serving to guests.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was defintely good however, I would have liked a little more punch.  I made it as stated but added a pinch of chili powder.  Next time I think I will add cumin and cayene..

This was the best spanish rice I ever made. I'll admit, i usually make spanish rice out of a box, but this was so easy and did not take much longer than those. I made it exactly as the recipe and it came out perfect.

Excellent! Used 1 cup of rice and a can of Rotel with lime juice instead of salsa. Stirred in a teaspoon of chili powder before covering to simmer. Turned out awesome, kids found it not too spicy and husband added some cholula-hot sauce to his. Great dish for a crowd! I have made this recipe 4 times now (3 times exactly per recipe). Try it tonight!

Flavor was great, but rice came out crunchy.  Followed recipe exactly, so don't know what went wrong.

The key is to use the chicken broth. Without it its pretty bland. I also used about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, my mexican brother in law always uses this in hs rice and it adds a richer flavor. Very easy recipe and tasty!

Very tasty. Left out the chopped onion because I didn't have any...or I did and I was too lazy to chop them. But next time I will make sure and add them.

Followed this exactly and was easy and delicious.

Addendum to my first note - I have made this many times and if out of chunky salsa have used a can of Rotel and that worked great.  Awesome recipe.

Great recipe -- tasty, quick and easy.  I tripled the recipe for a large crowd and had no leftovers!  I did add a few things:  Used about 1 cup of chopped onion, added 1 chopped green pepper and about 2T of chili powder (again, for a triple recipe.)

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did not have chicken broth on hand, so I had to whip some up using boullion cubes. Idk if the rice was supposed to be firm, so I'm guessing minute rice should be used. Very tasty, and very easy. We had it with homemade chicken tacos.

Absolutely amazing! Tasted great! The only thing I did different was add 1/2 cup extra of chicken broth and added black beans.  I also bought taco bell Chuncky salsa.  I was a bit nervous bc I did that, but not to worry it still tasted great! Can't wait to bring my left overs for lunch tomorrow.

Loved this recipe as i needed something quick, easy with non-fussy ingredients.  I didn't have chicken broth but had vegetable broth and it turned out really good still with my steak fajitas.  Thank you.

This rice was so good!! So much better then the "rice" packets you can buy at the store! I will make this again and again! So easy!! The only thing I did differently was use 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. It was the perfect amount! Oops, I also added a little chili pepper :)
I served this with the salsa chicken from this site-perfect pairing! I also made corn and black beans. I plan on making burritos tomorrow with the leftovers and I can't wait!

I made this more flavourful by using a the liquids from "Simple Carnitas" from AR, which had been reduced to concentrate the flavours. I used some water to make up the difference. Then I simply tossed in the salsa, mixed it all up and let it cook in my rice cooker. Didn't want to meddle with more pans to saute a wee bit of onion when there's already some in the salsa.

Awesome Recipe! I've been looking for a good Spanish Rice recipe and am so happy I found this.  I did add just under a 1/2 cup of frozen corn, otherwise did everything exactly as written.  This is the BEST spanish rice ever!!!  I did find that I had to add about 1 cup extra Chicken broth at the end.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

This is my go to Spanish Rice recipe! I always add a little more onions then the recipe calls for, just because we like onions in my house. Also, I don't cook the onion first.... I throw them in at the same time I'm browning the rice. The first few times I made this recipe I did it with cooking the onions first, but by the time the rice was done browning the onions would be burnt. Otherwise the recipe is perfect as is!

I wasn't sure if I'd like this recipe as I've made a rice from this site before that called for adding salsa and didn't care for it.  Having used the exact same salsa in this recipe as I did then, I have discovered I LOVE this recipe!!  I did halve the recipe on everything with the exception of the onion--I used 1/4 cup, as I couldnt see saving a small portion of an already small onion.  This will be my go to recipe for spanish rice for now on.  No need to use store bought rices that are too high in sodium content anymore!!  I may try adding corn and black beans to it next time.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

I'm not too keen on this stuff. I have tried making this twice, following the recipe to a T, and it just doesn't do it for me. I was convinced that I had just done it wrong the first time since it has such a high rating. But to my disappointment, it had the same result the second time.

This was an excellent quick Spanish Rice dish to make just as written. I rated it on the cooks original recipe.  The second time I made it I added 1 whole chopped small Walla Walla onion instead of just 2 tablespoons plus also added one whole large minced fresh garlic clove to suit our particular taste.  Also seemed to need to add a little extra chicken broth towards the end of cooking because the rice wasn't quite tender and it was getting too dry (could have been the variety of rice I was using).  This recipe will get made whenever I make my husband Mexican recipes that need a rice side.  Thank you for sharing.

Good, but needs more onion and next time, I'd probably use 3/4 c of rice.  We have a TON leftover!  I added two cloves of crushed garlic when I was browning the rice - I just can't NOT add garlic. :)

I made this just as written with one addition, I added a half of a hot banana pepper in with the onion.  I used home canned salsa and it was so good!  I made chicken breasts in the oven while this was on the stove top.  When they were both done I put the rice in a baking dish and put the chicken on top then sprinkled cheese over the top and put it back in the oven to melt the cheese.  My hubby said it would be good with hamburger in it too like Hamburger Helper.

Taste was excellent, however in the end it needed more liquid.  The standard formula for rice is 2 cups water/liquid to 1 cup of rice.  This recipe only calls for 2 cups of broth.  There is a little liquid from the salsa, but not enough to make up the difference.  Next time I will use 3 cups of broth.

Super easy and super yummy.  I didn't have enough chicken broth, so I used some water and it was still great. I might add some frozen corn and peas next time.

This recipe is excellent.  It is more than deserving of 5 stars.  My husband just raved over it and said he wants this recipe from now on.  After reading other reviews, I decided to use 2 tablespoons butter instead of vegetable oil (husband can't have for health condition) and I used white Minute Rice so the 2 cups of chicken broth was perfect.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

I tried making this recipe for dinner tonight. I added bell pepper to mine and followed the instructions exactly. However, even after 30 minutes, my rice wasn't done cooking and after 50 minutes, only half my rice was done, the other half was still crunchy (I used white, long grained rice).

Quick, easy and the whole family enjoyed it, even my fincky 2 year old.  It doesn't get better than that!  I served this with the Southwest Chicken from this site, it was very good as well.

Loved this recipe!  I added some salt, garlic and chili powder.  Also used onions and peppers. I cooked a serving for two so I used the same proportions as on the rice box but used the broth in place of water.  Also used 1/2 c salsa.  I enjoyed this rice with some yummy steak fajitas.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made this recipe several times now. I just wanted to tell others who have tried this what I believe to be a great tip. I use Uncle Ben's Rice. If you use Uncle Ben's Rice; The recipe is as follows. 1 and 1/2 cups of rice, one 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth and one 16 oz. jar of Pace Picante sauce. Follow the directions for cooking the rice on the box, which is bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. I would also suggest, stirring occassionally while it is simmering as the mixture does tend to stick. If you want to make more, just double the recipe. 3 cups rice, 2 cans broth, 2 sixteen oz. jars of Pace picante sauce. I've had great results using these measurements. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I Love spanish Rice.

the title says it all! it is the best, and easiest! You HAVE to have a tight fitting lid though. I added 1 small can of diced green chilies and topped it with fresh chopped cilantro when serving and it was fantastic!

I followed the recipe though found I had to add extra water and cook the rice for much longer than suggested in the recipe.  It tasted okay though I will try a different recipe in the future.

Increased chicken broth by 1/2 cup, put all ingredients minus oil in rice cooker. This turned out great, if you like soft slightly sticky rice. It worked for us and is very easy.

I have tried numerous times to make Spanish rice without any success ...until now!!  The recipe is easy and straightforward.  Do follow the instructions when it says to brown the rice(not burn) it is the key to cooking a good rice.

The recipe is so simple and delicious, I will never buy pre-made spanish rice again.  I made it with Minute Rice and chicken stock, since that's what I had on hand and it was full of flavour!

Delicious! So similar to my great-grandmother's authentic spanish rice.  My variation to make it closer to my grandmother's recipe include:
2 T olive oil
2 T Chopped onion
1.5 C uncooked white rice
2 C chicken broth (or regular water with lots of salt)
1 C diced tomatoes (or you can add a little extra)
1-2 garlic cloves lightly brown at the end with the rice and let it cook with the rice and water. Pull out at end of cooking.

I love this rice.  Better yet my extremely picky kids love it.  I started out with this recipe for a trial of several different ones for my daughter's graduation party.  There is no need to try any others.  She loved it!!  This is VERY EASY to make and will be great as I will be serving approx. 150 people.

I like this recipe a lot. It's flexible and simple and very tasty. Today i made this for dinner and added some grilled shrimp and chorizo sausage, and it was almost a gumbo or a paella, but simpler and more family-friendly. This isn't a fancy recipe, but it doesn't have to be in order to be delicious :)

Hey I just made spanish rice yesterday!! This really is a more authentic Mexican spanish rice!! Some of the recipes that call for ground beef? Yeah...don't know where that comes from. My family and I usually use tomatoe sauce not salsa but hey, if you want something a little different....Make sure you use extra long grain rice not medium grain as it will be too mushy if you don't. If you don't have chicken broth on hand use water and season with garlic and onion powder salt and pepper comes out just as good. You're gonna need more liquid, usually 2 cups of liquid for every 1 cup of uncooked rice. So you should use 3 cups of chick. broth not 2 1/2. When rice starts to boil then reduce heat to low and cover. Perfect every time!!

super yummy and WAY easy! I made my own salsa with some fresh tomatoes, onions, and spicy chiles. love this as a yummy base to build from. pretty much impossible to mess it up :) browning the rice wasn't crunchy at all! took maybe 25 min to cook and I added a tad bit of water, but even that wasn't necessary...

I’ve tried other Spanish Rice recipes and none were as good as this one.  And talk about easy!  This is it – my GoTo Spanish Rice recipe.  I follow this recipe exactly and the rice turns out nice and fluffy – no stickiness which I only like if I’m eating Japanese rice.  I use Pace Medium Picante or Chunky Salsa which is just a tad spicy.

Fast and easy to make, and it's super delicious!!  This will definitely be coming back!

The only thing I changed was that I used a double-strength broth.

This was great!  I used 3/4 c rice, added enough chicken broth to the juice from a can of Rotel to equal 1 1/2 cups and threw in the tomatoes in place of the salsa called for in the recipe (salsa is highly coveted in my pantry since I rarely find my preferred brand on sale).  I cooked until the liquid had been absorbed by the rice.  This rice had wonderful flavor and will replace "Mexican Rice 1" as my go-to Mexican side dish.

I liked it but add mushrooms and cheese to my rice. A resturant in Colorado Springs does it this way and I always loved it, so I was looking for a basic recipe to tweak, this was it.

Very nice Spanish rice. Dry and fluffy just as we like it. Use tomatoes in place of salsa if you prefer a very mild rice. We added extra spices in ours.

This was a great addition to burritos.  I increased the onion to about 1/3 c., but next time I would use a whole onion.  I also added about 1 cup fresh cilantro which I chopped and added after the rice had cooked about 20 minutes; I then let the rice sit for another 10-15 minutes before serving.  This recipe needed extra liquid to cook properly.  I thought this might be too salty with the broth and salsa, but it turned out just right.

Yummy.  I love the addition of the salsa, it makes all the difference.  I did do something a little different, given I had to improvise.  Basically I mixed two recipes together, this one and salsa chicken. The chicken breasts I had were too small and misshapen lol so I cut them up, added salt, pepper and olive oil, baked and added it to this recipe (and kept this recipe as is).  I also added 1/2 tsp of taco seasoning and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. It was fantastic!  This way it would also be a fantastic filling for burritos, adding sour cream, cheese and refried beans...mmm.  I think I'll do that next time.  As is though I think this is a great side dish, something you can definitely see at a taqueria but I think I'll keep it with the few additions I made, it was just too good to change it!

I agree with the name of this recipe. It is by far the best Spanish Rice recipe that I have tried. I did not have chicken broth, so I just substituted water and chicken bullion. I doubled this recipe and let it sit for about 20 minutes before serving. I did not find it crunchy at all, only the rice was firm which is just the way I like it.

This is fantastic! I only had minute rice, so I altered it just a bit... 1 1/2 cups minute rice, 1 1/4 cup chicken broth, 1/4 cup salsa, same amount of oil and onion as in the recipe... and it turned out wonderfully! (and only took like 5 minutes to make!)  I was scared that it would just taste like I dumped salsa into rice - but it really did taste like Spanish rice! 5 stars!

This is a very easy way to make Spanish Rice, but in my opinion, it tastes like what it is . . . rice with salsa dumped in. Maybe I should have opted for a better salsa. This was decent. But just decent.

Very tasty! I didn't make any changes to the ingredients but instead of using the stove top, I dumped the sauteed onions and the rest of the ingredients into the rice cooker and it cooked perfectly.

Following this recipe exactly, it's on the bland side (yet still somehow really good). Next time, I will use a spicy salsa and add some cumin and red pepper flakes, maybe a can of green chilies. Definitely a keeper, and really easy (and affordable) to make an organic version!

Absolutely delicious!  I love when something so easy is so good.  This is now going to be my go-to spanish rice.  I think it also makes a difference on what salsa you use.  I suggest using what is your favorite salsa, because that is where the true flavor comes from.  Thank you for this perfect recipe!

This recipe is great - easy and tasty!  We sometimes make it using tomato bullion instead of chicken broth.  We also make it spicy sometimes and mild other times (using different types of salsa).  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make! And I'm a clumsy beginner in the kitchen. I followed the recipe and used Tostitos Medium Salsa. I liked the way it came out. I tested it out on my parents. Dad said it was good, but a little too salty for him. Mom said it was perfect.

Very easy!  If you are picky about your rice, then this is not for you.  But we hosted a taco night with a build your own taco buffet.  So fancy was not needed.  This was quick to make and flavorful enough to go into a taco.

Awesome!  Finally a Spanish rice recipe on here that comes out like the Torero's Mexican Restaurante down the street!  I changed the recipe just a tad so mine was quite a bit hotter!  Also, after I let the rice cook with the water and salsa, I let it sit just a little bit longer on the stovetop so it "crisped" it a little bit making it perfect!

This rice is wonderful, but it took a lot longer to make, plus a lot of extra water - but it is DELICIOUS!!!  Will definitely be making again!

Our whole family enjoyed this recipe. I did add a clove of garlic in with the recipe and sauted for a couple of minutes before adding the rice.  A wonderful addition to the chicken tacos we had.

Yum! I did tweek this alittle but after making it yesterday, I made a second batch just because it was so good. I used jasmine rice. The longer grain brings out more flavor in my opinion. My major change was mostly due to personal preference. In the recipe - just says "Oil" so I used 1 tbsp of seasame oil and 2 tbsp of peanut oil..and 1/2 cup of onions because I love onions.  I used mild fire-roasted salsa, likely should have gone for medium. Low sodium chicken broth too. perfect!

This is THE BEST spanish rice and soooo easy to make!!  I adjusted this recipe to a serving of 3 and it was plenty to feed 5 of us.  I did use a spicy salsa which made it nice and spicy.  I used 1 cup of rice, a whole can of chicken broth and 3/4 cup of salsa.  The onions, I just used my judgement. My 8 year old likes spicy food, and this is the first and ONLY spanish rice that she has eaten.  This is DEFINIATELY a keeper in my recipe box.

This was really easy and yummy but didn't quite taste like authentic spanish rice to me. Edit:  I actually made this again using home-made salsa and it was 100x better.  I should have known store-bought salsa wouldn't have been as good!  Will make again and again!

This is a great side dish for any Spanish or Mexican based meal. I ended up adding 1 1/2 tsp. of salt because the salsa I used had a sweet taste. Warms up well.  I used the left overs and added some shreaded chicken and fresh tomatoes.

I had to scale for use with instant brown rice (all we had) and used the ratio of chicken broth to salsa in the recipe.  Like other reviewers I added a can of drained/rinsed low sodium black beans and used spicy salsa.   Rice was good but not the best.  Look forward to seeing how rice is on Monday when we eat the leftovers.

I made this rice tonight to go with my meatloaf. I followed Karen H's specific instructions cuz mine almost always comes out gummy and sticky. I am married to a Mexican Man and I know that the rice is supposed to be fried. I think, in the past, I have fried it too much. Please follow karen's instructions and your rice will come out just like it is supposed to nice and fluffy. I will add one thing, after it is done cooking, and sat for the 5 mins, fluff with a fork instead of stirring with a spoon. Very important! I got Rave reviews from the hubby for this rice tonight. It tasted delishious! I will do it this way from now on! Thank You ilovetocook.

I have been meaning to write a review on this for a while. I have made this more times than I can count now. It is the easiest but BEST spanish rice you can make. I use Pace salsa and also saute a yellow bell pepper. SO GOOD!!! my boyfriend is tired of mexican food, but I make it all of the time just so I can eat this rice.

Good taste, but the crunch that the rice had really ruined it for me and my boyfriend.  Next time I won't brown the rice, and I think that will make this closer to 4 stars. EDIT: changed this to 4 stars ... I made this again without browning, and it just wasn't that good.  My third try I sauteed the rice for a few minutes, and it turned out perfect.  Trial and error. :)

This is an great recipe! Instead of olive oil, I like to use a little bacon grease to sautee the onion, rice, and fresh garlic (three cloves; I really think the garlic adds tons of flavor.) Also, I make my own salsa with fresh ingredients. At the end I sprinkle some fresh chopped cilantro on top. Definitely a great, versatile recipe!

Awesome recipe! I followed the directions with the exception of adding a hint of garlic powder, cumin and salt, and a dash of pepper prior to simmering rice. Very good! All of my family loves...which says a lot since two of them don't like tomatoes!

Wonderful and sooooooooo easy! Based on the type of salsa you use, you may need to tweak the proportions a bit, but you can't hold the author responsible for that. This is so delicious and easy that even some of my Mexican friends now use this recipe.

Just made this recipe and it is wonderful, I did add an extra 1/2 cup chicken broth, and some browned chorizo, also did the foil trick, cooked according to directions and it came out perfect.  My family went nuts over this rice.  I will most cetain use this recipe again.

This recipe was fast, easy and tastes good.  I thought it was missing a little something, so maybe next time I will use hot salsa rather than medium or undrained diced tomatoes with green chilles.  Either way it was a good side dish to the enchiladas that I also made from allrecipes.com.

Great recipe for spanish rice.  I love that it isn't mushy or wet after the cooking.  I had never tried it before serving it at my dad's birthday dinner, but it was a HUGE hit!

I really like this recipe.  I made it for the second time tonight. The first time I made it with picante sauce. Tonight I made it with green salsa for something different and loved it too! It's a great go to recipe because I always have these ingredients on hand.

I thought this recipe was very good.    I believe the key is cooking the rice in the frying pan before adding the liquid, this results in the rice being firm and not mushy-DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. I do think it needs a little more flavor, so next time I will add a little taco seasoning for some added oomph. Other than that this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really, really good - especially considering how easy it was to fix. My only problem was that I had to add about 4 additional ounces of liquid to get the rice to cook all the way. It could be due to high altitude, but I'm not sure, so I left off a star.

Make this tropical! Use Mango Peach salsa! I needed to make this for a Luau and have it be more tropical than Spanish rice. It's perfect with any kind of salsa.   Don't brown your rice...just cook it for a minute or two before adding the broth and salsa. With the addition of cooked chicken, this becomes a one pot dish just like arroz con pollo.

This is a great recipe, but you've got to remember that you need a 2 to 1 liquid to rice ratio. I was in a hurry the first time I tried this recipe, blindly followed it, and it was a disaster. If you add enough liquid, it's a great recipe though

There wasn't nearly enough liquid and it took about twice the time listed to cook. I ended up having to add another half cup of water to the rice, at least. I guess it depends on how liquidy your salsa is. The end result was just okay.

I appreciate this contribution however this dish was not tasty to me at all.  I thought the salsa would blend into the dish for a unique flavor.  Instead, it basically tasted like rice with salsa in it.

this is way to much salsa to add right away.  Let people put their own on, use just about 1/2 cup and throw in some sliced green olives if you like..

What a simple way to make this!! It turns out I only used one cup of rice. I liked the rice-to-salsa ratio I used. I used a rice cooker and thew everything in the rice cooker. Turned out wonderfully!

Ok, so I made this recipe and it was super easy! I am giving it four stars because even following the recipe exactly, the end result will be affected by the type and flavour of the salsa you use.( I prefer Herdez it tastes so fresh!) I also added a little extra broth near the end of cooking time. Came out great, thanks for the great shortcut!

I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out perfectly.  It had a great texture and plenty of liquid for cooking.  It doesn't taste like salsa and rice at all.  I used a cilantro-chipotle salsa, and it was delicious.  This is the easiest, tastiest Spanish rice recipe I've ever tried.

This recipe deserves the name "Best Spanish Rice."  My sister, who really enjoys good Spanish rice and is very picky about it, said it was the best homemade Spanish rice she had ever eaten and that it was "restaurant quality."  I followed the advice of other posters and used 2 1/2 cups of broth, gave it 25-30 minutes to simmer, and it came out perfect.   Thanks for a great recipe that's definitely a keeper!

Really easy, really practical, and also very good for a change from plain rice. I used mild salsa. Worked out great. I will try medium spicy next time. Served it with baked honey chicken and mint sugar snap peas from this site. Yum!

GREAT recipe! So easy and tastes delish! I added peppers (bell and jalapeno), just because I had some on hand and wanted to use them up, so I sautéed them with the onions and followed the rest of the recipe. Loved it - will definitely make again! THANKS for sharing!

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have any salsa the night I wanted to make it so I just added the same amount of crushed stewed tomatoes and some chili powder.  It turned out great.  My husband loved it.  I will certainly make again.  Maybe even with salsa next time!

I've never had a good experience with making rice!  You'd think it would be simple enough, but for some reason, I always find a way to mess it up!  This Spanish rice was not only easy to make, but it was SO good!  Why complicate a recipe with loads of work/ingredients when you can easily use the salsa instead?!!  Genius!  I served this with Chicken Enchiladas from this site and it was a fabulous Mexican dinner!

I threw this all in the rice cooker with a little more broth and it was so easy! I also added garlic, and instead of salsa I used pico de gallo I had on hand.

This recipe was really easy and had great flavor! The only problem we had was the rice didn't seem quite done. Next time I will add more liquid and let it cook longer. Other than that it was great! I will definatly use again!

OMG! I always hated spanish rice because my mother cooked it weird. It was always too tangy, but I had fajitas last night and wanted the Mexican dinner feel, so I tried this. I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for a fast easy recipe. The only change I made was I added garlic to the onions. Yum!

Tastes great!  This only takes a few minutes more than making out of a package, but tastes so much better.  Used 1c rice and 2c broth, and it still made a ton of rice!

I always used Rice-a-Roni's Spanish rice in the past, but I am trying to cut down on the salt in our diet so I looked up how to make it myself.  This is so simple and so delicious, I don't know why I never did it before now!  I will be using this recipe often.

This was the best rice ever! I used medium salsa which made it just spicy enough. I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and also added fresh garlic with the salsa and chicken broth. I will be making this again for sure!

Excellent recipe, I followed it to the letter.  The only thing I would change is adding an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth because my rice came out a little too crunchy.

This is a good recipe. My boyfriend said it was the best I had ever made.  He did suggest putting shrimp in it. (?) I used the HEB brand of picante sauce and it turned out great.  This will be my favorite spanish rice recipe.

This was delicious. The only adjustment I made was to use Rotel in place of the salsa. My husband is not a big spanish rice fan, and he had two helpings!Wonderful recipe, and I thought reviewer Karen H gave some very helpful tips.  Thanks for sharing your great recipe, ilovetocook!

be sure the brown the rice completely. 
otherwise, i wasn't impressed overall.
despite the seasoning it was almost bland... i wouldn't make this specific recipe again.

It was ok. Not bad, but I was expecting more flavor. I used a Medium-spicy chunky salsa. 

Directions do not specify to bring to full boil before reducing the heat. Thus, it will make some of the rice tough. Follow the advice of other members and bring to boil before covering up for 20 min.

Excellent recipe and EXTREMELY simple. Tasted just like I spent hours making it. I did not have any onion, however, I don't believe it made a difference in the flavor since there was already some with the Salsa. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I used Pace mild salsa. Served it with a Salsa Chicken recipe and it complimented the meal nicely. My Husband really enjoyed it and he is a very hard person to please.

I used wheat rice, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.  The wheat rice takes almost 3 times as long to cook! But it was amazingly good once it finally cooked through!

My husband and I love this rice. I always have the ingredients on hand and it is just too easy!! Never too salty if you use the low-sodium chicken broth.  
Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

Finally!  I have tried several spanish and mexican rice recipes and this one is IT.  I followed some of the suggestions here especially about making sure you have a tight seal on the skillet.  It came out perfect!  No more boxed rice mixes for us, I can make it myself.  Update:  I use just 1 cup of rice, but still 2 cups of broth and a cup of salsa.  Seems like it would be too much liquid, but it comes out perfect every time.

I make this when I am in a pinch for time instead of my regular recipe that is much more time consuming.  Last night I added a cup of frozen corn and sometimes I will add a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  This is really good for how easy it is!

I would give this a 4.5 if I could...not THE best but still VERY good!  It was a good, easy recipe for a side dish.  I have made another spanish rice recipe on this site which also called for browning the rice and it did not turn out very well...a little crunchy and a little chewy.  So on this recipe I decided to not brown the rice, which I highly recommend!.  I also added a little more onion since I like it and also thought the recipe needed some salt.  I also used a 'restaurant style' salsa since hubby doesn't like 'em chunky.  This was really good, next time I might turn it into a main dish and add some ground beef or even chicken!  Thank You!!

We have this all the time.  It is fabulous!  Easy, and I usually have all the ingredients.  We use a picante sauce instead of a chunky salsa and it works fine.

It was wonderful. I used medium Old El Paso salsa and threw everything in the rice cooker and it was all ready! I didn't even bother to fry the rice.

Super good.. I usually skip the onion as there is usually enough in the salsa, you the extra doesn't make a difference. Also I use beef broth instead of chicken.. it is much more flavourful that way!!

Rated a five for quick and easy!  I added canned corn as well, and it was really tasty.  Diced tomatoes would be good too. Thanks!

I've been looking for a side dish for my Mexican Entrees.  And this is it!  I did have to make some changes, but I did manage to stay with the basic theme of the dish.  The ONLY rice I know how to make is Boil in the Bag so I actually boiled the bag in the chicken broth and then added the remaining ingredients.  I also added a little Queso Dip to give it a cheesy flavor.

Made this for a side dish to Mexican enchiladas and it was great!  Ths salsa makes the dish, so make sure you get a good kind.  The only thing I changed was to add a little bit of ground cumin and sub. beef broth.

I made this tonight with "Salsa Chicken" (by Faye).  It was great, I did as others stated and added more water.  I also noticed that some of the rice did remain chewy - like others mentioned, don't brown it ~ and I did!!!  But I won't next time! ;)
DH didn't care for as much as I did.

This was wonderful, and very authentic!  I was lazy and used 1 Tbl. minced (dried) onions instead of grating a fresh one.  Would do that again!  I also used only 1 Tbl. oil to cut down on the fat - perfect!  This was so easy to make, and was a great complement to chicken enchiladas.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a couple of changes, I sauteed garlic with the onion and I added adobo seasoning when I added the broth. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Great recipe!

I gave this one five stars. I have made it 3 or 4 times and it is really good. One of the important parts is to brown the rice. I noticed some people skip it and it doesn't come out as good. I also discovered that adding some more salsa to it when you reheat it in the microwave works really great. This also goes for reheating left over restaraunt spanish rice.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I have never had Spanish Rice before, but I was going to have a Pampered Chef party with a Mexican food theme.  So, I cooked this up, not really knowing what to expect.  It was very tasty!!  Everyone loved it at the party.  The only thing different I did from the recipe was I didn't saute the rice until it was brown. I did it for maybe 5 minutes.  It came great!

Very good. Husband doesn't like rice unless it has some sort of sauce on it, and he raved about this recipe. I served this with the Salsa Chicken recipe from this website. It was a big hit with the whole family.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't use the onion or brown the rice...I just put the oil, rice, broth and salsa in a skillet, covered it and let it simmer for the 20 minutes and topped with mexican cheese!  Great with any Mexican dish!!! Thanks!

This was pretty good. I used 1 medium red onion and reduced the rice to 1 cup did not brown the rice as stated in previous reviews. Definitely a quick and easy side dish to prepare. Thanks for the recipe.

Although this was an easy recipe, I didn't really care for it. OK, but not wonderful. But others seemed to like it - perhaps you will, too.

I had this recipe revised to feed 20 people & it never quite worked. After the initial cooking time the rice was still crunchy. After adding much more water, broth & salsa & let it cook for another hour, it was soft, but not a crowd pleaser.

It was simple enough for me to make & it was perfectly fluffy. I used salsa that was a bit too hot for my taste, but that was my fault (and my wimpy taste buds).  Great recipe

Folllowed recipe exactly.  Liquid was absorbed long before the rice was done and it started burning.   Rice was mushy and crunchy and had very little flavor.  I’m sure I could tweak it and it would be great, but not a keeper for me.

Absolutely delicious - Can I make a mistake on such an easy recipe?  Yes I can.  I grabbed the brown rice instead of the white rice.  Still by adding extra water and cooking it twice as long it worked out.

Probably added too much salsa or not enough rice because I couldn't get past the sticky/gooey  stage. However, this is delicious and as good and spicey as the salsa you add. Will make it again.

Such a fast & simple dish that really delivers a delicious side on a busy work night. Easy to flex with different kinds of salsa & adding a can of green chilies gives it a nice kick.

I tried to sub brown rice in this recipe and it bombed! Totally my fault. The rice was just hard and never cooked all the way. The flavor however was great. I will try this again with white rice as the recipe states. Just wanted to post this in case someone else thought they might be able to sub out brown for white!

The rice was very tasty and very easy to make. I added other spices to it pep it up. The broth was so good that I think I will try to make a soup out of it with chicken, rice and vegetables.

Wow, I have no idea what went wrong, I double checked the recipe. I had the same crunchy rice results as a few other reviewers and had to add twice the liquid. I even left it in a crockpot on low over night. The only thing that I can think is that it’s the rice I picked. I was in the Mexican section of the store and picked a a bag of extra long grain rice, La Preferida. The only other thing that I could think is I didn’t bring it to much of a boil.

I made it as directed... I give it a 4 star because it just has to much tomato Taste to it which I been trying to get away with from trying other recipes.  Any suggestions to help calm the tomatoes  taste down would be much appreciated.

I will definitely make this again, easy.  Mine came out sticky, but i didn't realize i was using instant rice, which is why it wouldn't toast, hence the stickiness.  Made to compliment my slow cooker pork for tacos (pork loin, packet of taco seasoning on top, top with enough salsa to add a thin layer, show.com on low for about 8 hours, easy delicious).  It was a nice change for our old standby.

Browning the rice first made this dish really amazing. I will be using that method for other recipes as well.

We forewent sauteing the onion with the recipe as we were already using large slices with our fajitas. We also added a couple tablespoons finely-chopped cilantro to the dish while it was cooking. It ended up being the best Spanish Rice recipe we've had.

Heavy skillet = cast iron pan. Always. Great, simple recipe, and really tasty. Cheers!

I only had a half cup of salsa on hand so added an additional 1/2 cup of rotes.  Also used more onions than called for and added about half of a smaller bell pepper, diced.  I also added a bit of fresh garlic as well as salt and pepper.  This dish turned out great!  The additions to the recipe ensured that it was quite spicy.  If you are from south Louisiana as we are then it’s no problem for you however it may be too spicy for some folks!

Made this tonight, turned out great. Just used a little more onion and also added a tablespoon of taco seasoning. Served with shrimp sautéed with garlic, some chili powder and cayenne pepper.  Other side dish was TJ fire roasted corn, wonderful!

Made this slightly different. Use Salsa Roja which is popular in CA markets. After stir fry to get the aroma (not brown), mixed in a spoon of bouillon, put the mix into a rice cooker, added water and cooked like normal rice. Turned out great. The family loved it! Will make again.

I followed the recipe and it was perfect! My picky eaters love this and it has become my go-to for rice. The one thing I would add is NOT to sautee the onions first. They will BURN easily if not watched. But this is perfect.  In place of Picante, I have also used tomato sauce. It works either way perfectly. Just depends on the flavour you want. Picante is a bit vinegar-ish.

Followed all directions exactly with no changes, I wasn’t impressed I know I’m in the minority in the reviews but it just tasted like taco seasoning to me. And ended up being soggy. I wouldn’t make it again. I still left 3 stars due to the fact it’s got overwhelming positive results from most other people and feel like maybe this just wasn’t my preference.

I just made 3 batches of this using the exact recipe & every one turned out exactly how I want spanish rice to be. I will say that I got a bit of rice buildup on the bottom of the pot but it washed out easily.  Truly recommend this recipe - its so easy.

Loved it but reduced rice to one cup and let it set for 10 plus minutes.  Used a medium salsa, very. Flavorful.  Enough for 6 side dishes.

Made just as directed. Very simple and quick.
I made this to go along with shrimp tacos, but this would go well with almost anything.
I will make this again.

Easy side dish! I used 2 cups rice and 3 cups chicken broth. I added some black beans and corn near the end of cooking time and topped it with shredded Mexican cheese.

I made this as written with a name brand jar of salsa.  It was good.  My kids didn't understand the salsa in the rice.  We thought it tasted like salsa and rice.   I think with some tweaking it would be a 5 star.  But for ease and having pretty much everything on hand this is a handy recipe to start with.

I have made this with and without added green/red peppers. I ALWAYS combine the suggestions from “Karen Hintz” (except I use Herdez salsa) and proportions from “ChefJoy” and end up with perfect flavorful Spanish rice.

This was, perhaps, the 2nd best Spanish Rice I've ever tasted (apart from my wife's! -- I'm not going to make THAT mistake again).
I used brown rice for the recipe and cooked it for about 50 minutes instead of 20. It was a big hit! Definitely going to make this again.

This rice was sooooo good!  I didn't know that a simple ingredient like picante sauce would enhance the flavor of rice.  This is my new go to side dish.

This is a great recipe! I did not have instant rice but I did it exactly as the instructions say and then after the time was up I added one extra cup of chicken broth and gave it a few more minutes. It was perfect!

I actually made this as a side for a Taco Bar themed wedding. The guests loved it. It was so easy to make in bulk! A little trick I use when cooking anything Mexican or tomato based spicy is to add or substitute Spicy V8 for a little more flavor.

Just like other reviewers I followed the recipe to the T. Rice was still crunchy after 25 minutes so I added 2 more cups of broth and simmered another 20 minutes. Part of the rice was done and other parts still chewy. Couldn’t cook it anymore or it would just be mush. Maybe instant rice would work better?

I used up what in salsa, a little more than suggested but I added 1/2 cup extra rice also.  Instead of premade chicken stock, I used chicken bouillon and water as a substitute.  I also opted to finish cooking in my electric rice cooker/ warmer so I could rest after I had sauteed the onions in another pan.  I will make this again, so easy to make and tasty, too, thank you!

Made according to recipe but accidently used a jar of salsa instead of 1 cup, as the recipe calls for. It had good flavor and made a great presentation but there was too much rice. So, because of the amount of rice, it seems that the dish was drier than I expected.

I never realized how easy Mexican rice was to make! Thank-you for posting a non-intimidating quick recipe for all of us to try out. This tastes good as is so don’t feel like you have to add anything but since it’s such a great baseline- it quickly gave me confidence to expand my creativity and try some stuff out:) I like adding Rotel vs. salsa for a more spicy version a long with some taco seasoning. I also add a bit more onion with some fresh red bell pepper too. Top it off when serving with some fresh cilantro and *voila* looks so pretty and tastes great. I serve it with stuffed chicken breast and served it to some guests and they all loved it. Thanks soooooo much for making me look so great, lol

My family likes this recipe it is easy one skillet meal. I do add a can of drained black beans, frozen cooked diced chicken breast or you can use uncooked chicken breast if frozen cut back on chicken broth a little bit bc water from frozen chkn adds liquid. After cooking the 20min. I topped it with chedder cheese and let melt. My kids like it as is
or served with tortilla chips /soft taco shells.  Sour cream & guacamole and the salsa left . Makes a great side.
I have added corn if I have left over corn from a previous dinner.  Fyi, if using raw chicken be sure that it gets done to safe temp.  I have continued cooking in the preheated oven at 350o for 15-20min if i used frozen whole chicken breast that were thick. The last few min in oven i added salsa & cheese on top.  Remember to use a oven safe skillet w/lid if using frozen whole breast it may need to finish up in oven will keep the bottom from burning or drying out the rice while the chicken cooks to safe temp. if your using raw diced chicken it is usually will be done on stovetop after the 20/25min. If using raw chicken try to put it in the boiling chicken broth at beginning of the recipe and boil a couple minutes before continuing  the recipe if its not huge/thick peices going in the oven may not be necessary.  I have had  good luck with this recipe  prepared either way. It turned out  good.

There is no possibility the you can make the "best spanish rice" using a jar of store bought salsa. Firstly, it will taste like the salsa, not spanish rice. This is better called rice with salsa. Secondly, this is actually "Rice: The shortcut of shame" because it tastes like rice smothered in salsa.

Made this to go with my fajitas as a side. Used my homemade salsa. I used 2 different kinds of rice I had on hand, wild and brown they each had a different cook time but it turned out wonderfully. I halved the recipe for the 2 of us and used bone broth instead of chicken broth. It was really good. :)

Made it exactly as directed the first time. It was easy and delicious. A vegan version made with vegetable broth turned out equally well. With the vegan version, I mixed in 1.5 cups of cooked pigeon peas (one 15-oz. can, drained) for added vegetable protein; it made a good, balanced dish.

This was ok just nothing great. It was better than the box mix or packet I’ve tried. I had a hard time browning the rice but it did turn yellowish rather than white when I added the broth & tomatoes. I’m still looking for something else before I give up on Spanish rice made at home.

This is the best (and easiest) Spanish Rice. Ever! I’ve tried too many recipes to count, and decided I’d give this simple recipe a try. Don’t let the simplicity fool you! Delish!

This was the first time I made it and will make it again!  It is very easy and has a great taste. I did add some cumin and red and green peppers to the onions.I used brown rice and it cooked up nicely! Taking the dish to a family Mexican dinner.
Yums!

I followed the directions with the tip from another person saying to add an extra 1/2c of water and it came out perfect! Not too nutty (raw) and not too mushy. It was perfect!

This is an ok side - it cooked just fine, super easy to make, but it’is rather bland. I didn't change  anything , and wish I had. Lacks something. Idk what- perhaps garlic, maybe cumin. I’d add low sodium chicken stock vs broth for a richer background, too.

I've made this recipe 3  times now, and each time I try something a little different. The first time I made it according to the recipe, but added some extra spices and some grilled chicken to give it some additional flavor.

The second time I made it, I added in peppers, corn, and black beans, and that came out fantastic!

And the third time, I made it with brown rice, which came out good, but not as good as with white rice. It also took more than double the time to absorb the broth mixture.

I highly recommend this recipe, it's super simple, but really delicious, and there's lots of ways you can jazz it up.

Very good, easy recipe for a taco night party menu.   I had chunky salsa so I decreased the rice to 2 cups and left the chicken broth at 4 cups.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

As is, the recipe is very good. Much better than the rice in a box from the store and just as easy. I would recommend using a chunky salsa that the family likes. I’ve made this a few times with different rices. I have found brown rice  takes about double the cooking time. Also, I throw in corn or peas or celery at the beginning just to add more color.

Very good. Followed suggestions and midway I  added some chopped red and green pepper I had in the freezer. I let rice cook and get a crust and flipped over and crisped up the other side a bit.   Served with steamed  green beans and broccoli and rockfish fillets       My husband always prefers potatoes but liked the rice so well he gave the 5* rating

I have tried a bunch of Spanish Rice recipes, and decided this is my favorite. You can mix it up to suit your taste buds pretty easy. I agree with the other reviewers, sauting the rice is a must. I don't brown mine, but wait until the beads look solid, you can put onion in while doing this step, but definitely not garlic-add that right before you include the liquids. Resist the urge to open the lid during cooking and resting time, you will be rewarded! I have used many different kinds of rice, brown rice will take extra time to cook beyond the package directions, and you should still saute it ?? Happy cooking!

We liked this and will make it again. I just dumped in the salsa, so I probably used 1.5 cups. Next time, I'll add a bit of salt and some cayenne to give it some kick, though. As written, it is a little bland.

My husband and I love this recipe with fish!  I dice about 1/4 c. onion and cook until translucent, then add 3/4 c. rice and simmer until the rice starts to turn brown.  Then I add 1 c. chicken broth and an entire cup of my spicy homemade salsa.  After 20 minutes the rice really is not done enough, so.

I made this for dinner party that I went to and everyone complimented it.  I'm not a seasoned or very good cook and this recipe made me look like a rock star!   Very easy to make and a very enjoyable side dish.

Instant Pot success again!   Added all ingredients, no sauteing ... and used Herdez salsa and added some Adobo seasoning... about a teaspoon with a couple of shakes of Lawry's garlic POWDER.  Used the rice setting.

Every time I make this for a gathering there is none left to take home for leftovers! That would be my biggest complaint! :) It’s super easy to make and so very flavorful.

I absolutely LOVED this Spanish rice and so did my family!! I would say I'm not TOO savvy in the kitchen but I'm not bad. I usually shy away from making a receipe I've found online for fear of messing it up or having a hard time making it altogether. This was a VERY easy one to follow and will make my spanish rice like this from now on. I followed the receipe as is. I just added a few chopped up red bell peppers. I personally would say use fresh ingredients, like the lime and orange. I think the lime juice would've made it too sour. Also, BROWN THE RICE FIRST! Usually when I make normal white rice the rice is more stickier and not as "fluffy". Well I feel spanish rice is supposed to made a littler fluffier. Browning the rice made my rice not sticky and it came out perfect! It doesn't take long and definitely worth it! Just make sure not to over brown them.  If you're looking for an easy, flavorful Spanish rice look no further!! You've found it!

I could write all day and not say enough about this awesome recipe.  It's perfectly easy, and so simple with little prep time. 
 After all's in the pot and simmering I set the timer and always have perfectly moist Spanish rice to fluff and perfectly seasoned each time.  Sure wish I'd had this recipe sooner.  I tried others and weren't so pleased, they'd either be too soft and mushy, and the taste was off.  I use organic chicken broth and when I use brown rice I add a little more broth and simmer 15 minutes longer.

VERY GOOD!!! I’m not sure why it calls for diced onion and then salsa that has onion in it, but it was DELICIOUS. I’ll probably omit the diced onion next time unless I don’t use salsa. Yummy!!!!

Great recipe. Toasting the rice makes a huge jump in depth of flavor. I used beef stock because that's what was on hand. I used green onion and a little chopped orange  pepper. Ran out of salsa so used a little salsa verde. I'm serving this with tacos tonight but you could add leftover chicken for a one pot meal. Thanks for the recipe. This is my new favorite!

I've been looking for a good, easy spanish rice recipe. This was delicious, Even my husband (from Texas) loved it. I followed the recipe completely and used "mild" pace picante sauce.  Also, follow the advice of the reviewer, Karen Hintz. I covered the pot with tin foil, and did not peak for the 20 minutes while it simmered and then let it sit for 5 minutes before taking of the foil. It was perfect and had great flavor.

This is not another review, but a tip. Do not follow this recipe to the letter. You are going to have to modify it, so this is not a good recipe for beginner cooks.

I wanted a bit more bulk to it to  serve as a side with burritos at our Life Group meeting so I sauteed a chopped red bell pepper and a medium yellow onion. I had also drained (very well ) a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes. Since altering recipes that I find here before you try them has  always been a pet peeve of mine I then made the rice as directed before adding my extras. The result was perfect. Thanks for a great base recipe.

Forgot to buy my Spanish rice box at the store so needed a quick solution. Pleasantly surprised, it was easy and tasted great! Would make again

Delicious flavor! Followed the recipe to a T except adding a few sprinkles of cumin. I've never had much luck with stove top rice and usually use a rice cooker. The texture was a bit off (just done in the center, kinda mushy on the outside). It got better after letting it sit for a few min with the lid off. The flavor was on point and I'm sure the texture was my error. Will try in my rice cooker next time but my 10 yr old loved it so it's definitely a keeper!!!

This is actually a super easy and tasty recipe, the only flaw in my opinion is the type of rice you may use. You might need match broth ratio, or just generally watch and see if you need more. Other than that, super tasty!

Made it a few times now! Tastes really good and really good to make as a side! TIP: If you have any leftover rice, perfect way to make leftovers exciting. I just heat everything in a pan and add salsa.

loved the flavors, however, 2 C broth was not enough for the 1.5 C of rice. the rice was still eldente, which i do not like. I added an additional cup of broth and another 1/2 c of salsa. other than that it was a perfect quick dish.

I made this exactly to recipe the first time and it was good. The second time I doubled up the recipe however I didn't have enough chicken broth so I used half chicken broth and the other half I used V-8 and it was really good.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to follow and the ingredients were cheap to buy. However it will require more than the 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth that it asked for. When I cook rice I usually add the 1 or 2 cups that I need and let it boil down and then keep adding water/broth and letting it boil down until the rice becomes tender. Other then that I really enjoyed making this rice. Thank you!

I've been using this recipe for years of my family and friends love it. I've had instances where I've made this rice and they couldn't believe I made it it was so good. I tweaked my in a little bit here and there with different sauces just to try for taste but I find the best one for taste has been Pace Picante Sauce (Medium). It really does live up to the name because it's the best Spanish rice I've ever had or made. My family thanks you for sharing this recipe. LoL

Made this several times for my parents.  They love it.  For their tastes I did add 1.5 teaspoons of sugar to cut the tartness of the salsa.  Very easy to make.  I portion it out and freeze it for them.  Freezes very well.

I used 4 cups rice, 7 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of salsa. After simmering exactly 20 mins without removing the lid it was perfect. I also fried the rice and onions all at the same time. Fantastic and very easy.

Quick, easy and very tasty. Was looking for something with that criteria and I found it. Made it for nacho/burrito night for the family. Worked out really well and makes great for leftovers because I doubled the recipe. I made a few changes to work with what I had on hand. I used Pace Mild salsa instead of picante and added some salt, pepper, cumin and sautéed 2 cloves of garlic in the oil before toasting the rice. I would make it again on a time crunch! 5 year old approved!

Awesome recipe. This is by far the easiest and best tasting Spanish/Mexican rice recipe I’ve used. 

TIPS: instead of regular chicken broth use Knorr Caldo De Tomate (tomato bouillon with chicken flavor). 
Add frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas carrots)

Love it.  The first time I made it I followed it 100% and it was very good.  I like the salsa and cooking the rice.  Second time I made it I added ground beef, taco seasoning, garlic, red peppers, corn and used beef broth.  It is crazy good.  I will never use any other recipe.

This is the spanish rice recipe I have been looking for!!  I do not like a wet spanish rice, which I have found to be the case when making it with tomato sauce.  The broth and picante sauce give the rice a wonderful texture and incredible flavor!p

This was just okay.  It lacked flavor, kind of bland.  The rice takes a LOT longer to cook than indicated.  I probably will not make this recipe again.

The only change I made was to add a clove of minced garlic to the rice as it was browning. I was quite happy with this recipe. It looked exactly like what you would get at a Mexican restaurant!

Very easy and so good!  Used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa.  Also added a little chili powder and cumin. Made it vegan by using Better Than Bullion No Chicken base.

I didn't have any onion so I used 1 tablespoon of onion flakes instead.  Also I had just over 1 cup of medium tostitos salsa left in a jar and balsamic rice.

Yum Yum YUM!!

Easy to make.  Growing up in Asia we always wash the rice before we cook it.  Not because of reasons like so it won’t be starchy blah blah but because sometimes these rice have bugs that grow in it.  Not that these bugs are toxic but you are better taking them off.  Besides these rice are harvested using  either human hands or machine you are better off cleaning them first.   Lots of potential of  this dish and you can certainly season it the way you like it.   Just buy the right variety of rice.

I "tweeked" this recipe and won a Spanish Rice cook-off as a result.  I added "Dominican Brand" salami, sautéed it first, then sautéed Italian peppers, zucchini, and onions.  Added two bay leaves to the rice and broth.  Also substituted Goya brand Sofrito (red) for salsa.

Not enough tomato.  Used 3 times the amount of chicken broth to keep it from burning.   Lack of flavor, even added entire jar of salsa and still bland.  Rather make this from scratch next time.

Solid recipe.  Super easy and tasty.  I’m sure that this recipe varies depending on what kind of salsa people get.  I opted for a non-chunky medium spice local salsa.

Very good.  We made it as listed, except tossed in some fresh oregano because we had it on hand.  I like the short cut that the salsa provided.  A lot of flavor added in one fell swoop.

Only issue was the cooking time.  Our simmer was a bit low, and we had to turn it up a bit for another 10 minutes to get the liquid to absorb.  Next time will probably use standard rice technique, bring to boil, reduce to simmer for 20 minutes.

Made as directed.  Came out a little sticky but cooked without lid at end to dry it up a bit.

It was a good recipe, but definitely could have done with more spices. Maybe some Adobo or something. Over all, very good!

Could not have been easier or faster.  SOOO much better than boxed Spanish Rice because you get to monitor the salt by using your favorite low-sodium chicken broth.  I would definitely make this again and wouldn't change a thing.

Very good. I live in Tucson, where good Mexican food is abundant. I have made this dozens of times and have passed on the recipe to soo many people. Everyone that has tried it tells me that it’s the best Spanish rice they’ve had. It’s a very simple recipe and comes out great if you follow it. One tip- make sure you use a pot/pan with a tight fitting lid

I followed recipe but I peeked and stirred while cooking, and the rice ended up a bit crunchy when time was up. I added 1/2 cup more broth, stirred, and cooked covered about 8 more minutes and was perfect. I blame myself for the loss of liquid, and next time I make it I won't peek until done.

This is the best recipe for Mexican rice that I've found. Only one change... When I first made it I only had beef bullion cubes so I used them with 2 cups of water instead of chicken broth. Since then, I've used chicken broth, but I like it much better with beef broth from bullion so I'll use that from now on. Excellent and simple! Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly and it  was  good. I am not sure what the deal is with rice, but with the onion, chicken broth AND salsa  I was surprised that the rice wasn't more flavorful.  That should of been more than enough seasoning. Next time, I will try a can of Rotele in place of the salsa

Loved it!   I did make a couple of other suggested changes.   I cut the recipe in half, I used more onion and even though I cut the recipe in half, I used a full cup of picante sauce.  Very good!  Just like the restaurants back home New Mexico.

Loved, loved the simplicity and super excited that it actually looks like Spanish rice! I like it but  I think mine was lacking a little flavor (bland)  which could be the difference in the salsa or using sauce alternatives.   I will make it again and again and I would recommend.

This was sooooooo good! I took some of the ideas in reviews and made the best rice dish I've ever had. I cut the recipe in half since there were only 2 of us. We both had seconds and there are still leftovers. I used about a 1/3 cup of chopped onion and 1/3 cup of chopped red pepper. I added a little extra broth since I added more veggies. I used our favorite salsa, Frog Ranch, and added nearly a cup. Sauteing  the rice is a must, and don't peak while it's cooking.

Recipe was good and did it’s job, I felt it was missing something though. I think some spices added would really push this recipe over the top. I am not a huge fan of chunky salsa, I will probably add a thinner salsa next time.

My first time making this and my family seemed to like it.  I just have to figure out how to cook this - one minute the rice was still underdone and I had to add a little more liquid - but then it ended up clumpy and a little mushy.  But they loved the flavor.

so thats how you make the rice not sticky, you fry it first !!! ive added salsa or done some things with my rice cooker but never comes out that soft individual grains. simple recipe, i think ill mess with the spices but its easy spanish rice, what i was looking for. maybe adding cumin, coriander, chile powder might be nice. but glad i came across this as a side dish for cheese enchiladas. funny rice seems so easy but as mentioned usually it just is mooshy and "its aight" but not great.

This was bland, flat and a bit bitter.   It really lacked depth of flavor. I was disappointed.  I can say it was super easy .  We jsut threw the majority of it  away after it sat in the fridge for a week uneaten. :-(

Yummy. Made it tonight along with Salsa Chicken on this site and it was awesome. Made exactly to the recipe and this is definitely going in the rotation. 
I sauted the onion and rice and then popped everything into my rice cooker and it came out so good. 
Even though I stirred it well when I put it in I maybe should have stirred it half way through because some of the rice on the bottom was still white and didn't absorb the salsa. But that was probably because I was using the rice cooker.

Turned out great! I used yellow rice from Sam's Club, cilantro lime salsa, and low sodium chicken broth. It was a little salty at first, but now that it's sat in the fridge for a couple days, it's perfect! Next time, I might do 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water. The texture was 100% perfect; I never would have thought to stir fry the rice BEFORE I cook it. Thanks for the recipe!!

Added some cumin and a but more hand chopped onion then I used 10 minutes of high pressure in an instant pot/ electric pressure cooker.

It had the house smelling like it  was Mexican night.

Too much for two people.  Serves about 10.  Fresh the rest.

Instead of salsa, I used stewed tomatoes that I cut up. Used juice and all and made in my rice cooker.  It was a hit. I grated jalapeño cheese on top for some kick. That way you can control the heat. Mmmmm

I made this recipe inside of my rice cooker / steamer. I melted butter, sauteed some chopped bell pepper and onion for about 10 minutes, added the rice and sauteed that for about 10 minutes and then threw in my chicken broth and salsa. I used the organic salsa from Costco and it gave it a tiny bit of zip. This was by far the best Spanish rice recipe I've ever made

Best Spanish rice I've ever made. Made is exactly as written except added in a third of a cup of raw pumpkin seeds to brown with the rice. They added color and crunch. I recommend this to anyone who loves spicy rice. My husband couldn't get enough of it.

For the sake of time, I just added all the ingredients to my rice cooker.  I'm sure it would have been even better if I had cooked it according to the instructions (sauteeing the rice), but it was still good.  I'll make it again.

Wonderful recipe!  I did add a couple minor items in additional ingredients, a small can of diced green chilies and a half tsp chili powder, as I like a bit more kick, and it took a little longer to get the rice tender, and I did cover the skillet to reach the desired depth of cooking and flavor, it was so good!

This was ok but didn’t have a huge amount of flavour.  It needs more liquid for the rice to cook properly.  I had to add more water.  I think it needs some spices like perhaps cumin.

This is my new Spanish rice recipe. Very easy and tasty. You can add your choice of flavors to change it up. I use what I have on hand, so I added chopped red bell pepper and one chopped jalapeno to the onion.  I also added chili powder and cumin. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made the mistake of making this with brown rice and it took forever to cook, so learn from my mistake :) . I had to add a lot more liquid (probably an extra 1/2 cup of water and extra 1/2 cup of salsa) for it to cook fully and it took about 1 hour. The flavor was okay, but next time I would add some garlic and maybe tomato paste to make it more flavorful.

This was a great base recipe! I have some saizon (blend of peppers and seasonings) and added a tsp it really pumped up the flavor. I used Roberto's salsa from Costco which also has a homemade flavor that made it extra delicious!

I made this in my rice cooker and it cooked perfectly. I’m not a great recipe follower, but I tried to follow this one pretty closely bc I have just recently learned to use this rice cooker. I tripled the recipe but there was not quite enough room for the liquid, so I didn’t dump all of the tomato sauce in.. added 3/4 pack taco seasoning, jalapeños, minced garlic, and extra diced onion!! Brought it to a Mexican themed “Friendsgiving” and it as devoured! We were eating it on the side and stuffing our burritos with it! This ones a keeper!

I’ve never made Spanish rice and this was so easy and delicious.  I read reviews on it first and someone said to put taco seasoning in it so I did.  Also I used Pace mild picante sauce and it had absolutely the best flavor and moist.  I’ll be making this again.

I wouldn't make this again. This isn't even close to real Spanish/Mexican rice. Horrible. I followed the directions to the letter and the rice was still hard and there was no flavor.

Others liked it, but I just thought it was ok. It tasted like plain rice with salsa on top, despite using a high quality salsa. I would not compare it to restaurant quality. I would only make again if I was in a pinch, since the ingredients are something that are probably already in the pantry.

Very far from authentic "Spanish rice" however with limited ingredients and time this was a pretty decent recipe. I would definitely recommend it if you're in a pinch.

The directions could have been more clear. Normally I get my rice to boiling then cover and turn it down to low and 23 minutes later - perfect rice! 
But this recipe says nothing about a boiling point or turning it down. Result was - crunchy rice. :(
Next time I'll get it to boiling and turn it down like I normally do and see if it turns out.

Delicious! I will definitely make it again. The only change I made is that I used Sofrito (sp?) versus regular salsa and after cooking the onions and the rice I put it in my rice cooker with the liquids and let it do the rest. My rice cooker is designed to cook stuff like gumbo , so I figured this would work too and it did. Came out perfect!

I add a little pepper,  and some Fiesta Lime Mrs Dash. I have played with some different salsa flavors as well. This is my go to recipe for Spanish dinners. 
Still trying to figure out what to add to put just a little bit of spice,  for now just a bit of enchilada sauce for me works.

First time making Spanish rice and it came out very tasty! The only changes I made were adding a little more water and 1/8 tsp of cumin. Stirred in some diced rotisserie chicken from the night before and boom- arroz con pollo!

This was a pretty good recipe. I didn't make any changes to it because it was the first time I had tried it. My husband really, really liked it!! I will be making this again, such an easy side dish. The next time I try it I may add a little pepper and possibly try a few other spices like cumin.

We love this and have made it a million times with different brands, although it's not "authentic" it's really great! Love the flavor. It does matter what brand broth and salsa you use. Play with it until you find the brand you like the best. Change from mild to medium or hot salsa if you prefer spice.

I made this with guests over and it was a hit, along with the salsa chicken which I also tweaked. Rotelle are excellent along with salsa. I also added more chicken broth to cook a little longer.

Wow!  Quick and easy rice!  I have to agree with many other reviewers that it requires additional broth to cook the rice and it takes much longer than 20 Minutes.  I also used butter over oil to sauté my onions...provides better flavor and less greasy.  This was a great side dish to the 3 Cheese Enchiladas on this site!

Better than any package Spanish rice. My family loves it every time I make it. I refer Pace salad to the fresh in my the deli section. The salad that you use is what makes the big difference.

Good recipe!  Much better than the boxed stuff.  It is a great base to start from.  We had no idea how to make Spanish rice from scratch so this recipe really helped us get started.  I might tweak the ingredients a bit next time.  It was a little too sweet for us so we might use a different salsa or picante and add some garlic.  Thank you for sharing!

Kids thought it tasted like biryani!
Wasn't sure how to rate this as I didn't have chicken broth and used vegetable stock instead and used basmati rice. Not sure how much that affected the taste. Otherwise it was actually quite good, needs a bit more depth which maybe the chicken broth would give. But if I can get away with doing this rather than Biryani it gets a double thumbs up from me!!

I feel I can only give four stars because I was unable to follow the full recipe exactly do to lack of ingredients and current inability to go and get the proper in ingredients (that is to say that I am unable to see the full effect of following the recipe exactly). But the proportions and steps remain roughly the same and I got excellent results. I did make some substitutions and additions out of necessity (this may be useful to those who must also make changes on the fly):


Unsalted Clarified Butter (a tablespoon more than the required amount of oil).
El Pato sauce instead of chunky salsa.
About a tablespoon more of chopped onion and added a table spoon of fresh copped garlic (to make up for using a thinner sauce).

Given my changing things around a little bit I found that I needed to add 1 cup water towards what should have been the burner-off point and continue to simmer for 8 more minutes to fully cook all grains of rice.  Of course my heat may have been a tad too high. And I was cooking with cast iron. Which could have been a larger contributor to needing additional cook time and water.

Overall I feel it was the simplicity and conciseness of the recipe that allowed me to prevail despite not having everything I needed. The good base let me make small adjustments on the fly.

Very good! I had to make one change, though. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I used beef. Tasted great!

I followed the advice to bring the liquid to a full boil before lowering the heat and letting it simmer. 20 minutes on the flame, five off, and it was as nice and fluffy as you'd get at a restaurant. 

The only thing I'd do differently next time is cut the recipe in half. It makes way too much for two people. LOL. Way too much.

I made it but it was bland & flavorless. I spiced it up with 2 Tbsp. of hot chili sauce, added a can of diced tomatoes w/chilies in it, about 2 c. Diced leftover roast beef & used a whole onion,diced. I also added a little Thyme & some garlic. Much better flavor. Yes, I will make it again,but with my additions.

Simple and so easy. If i've made salsa I'll use mine or a Rotel diced tomato with chili. And I also may let it simmer a tad longer, rice can be tricky. A keeper!

I made this exactly as recipe states. However, needed to add 3 cups more water and 20 minutes to cook time. I'll make a note on my printed recipe. It is really good rice, but Vallarta is way better. But this is cheaper so

Oh my gosh!  This was so simple and really good!  I'm always looking for a rice dish to accompany my Taco Tuesdays.   Last night I made this rice and, once again, my husband loved it.  I made quesadillas with sweet potatoes, kale, sausage and black beans, seasoned with paprika.  Mmmm Mmmm good!

I used tomato sauce instead of chunky salsa. I did chop up some tomato to make it chunky and, used a mix of oregano, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. I used a  decent amount of these seasonings. Turned out great

This was the best Spanish rice I've ever made.  I needed to get rid of half an onion so I used all of it in the dish.  You can't go wrong adding a bit more onions to anything really.  I used what  I had left of the salsa and also chopped up some cherry tomatoes.  I can now make real Spanish rice and not some sticky tomato rice with peas and carrots, lol.

Good recipe as is. We don't like onion, so we used red pepper instead. Another fun substitution is to use enchilada sauce in place of the salsa. It's easy to change this recipe to suit individual preferences!

My first time trying it was a hit! I actually added some green pepper to it as well. Since it was a success I made it twice in 1 weekend. The 2nd time I diluted the chicken broth with 1/2 of water because I thought the 1st batch was a little salty. However my family loved it both times!

I'm from a border town and this is as good as any of my friends or their mothers make! I substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken, and Herdez salsa instead of Picante and I loved it. Even my husband said it was really good! Will definitely make it again!

I've been using this recipe for a few months now. A couple of changes due to my family's taste: I use tomato sauce instead of salsa and and spices to our taste and I leave out the onions. I also have found it tastes much better when I use homemade broth from my pressure cooker as apposed to bouillon cubes. Great simple recipe though!

I followed the recipe, frying the onion and rice in a cast iron pan. Then added the wet bits and baked loosely covered in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees F. Pulled out, Stirred a bit and let rest to get just a bit dryer. Turned out pretty close to restaurant style!  Cast iron is the answer to awesome cooking.

The flavor was PERFECT! The only thing is I'm not sure if I was supposed to use parboiled rice or not because I didn't and it took twice as long for the rice to cook!... I tried it after the allotted  time and it was still crunchy...I probably did something wrong but oh well it eventually turned out great (-:

Quite good. This is basically the recipe I learned from my Mexican friend.  Like others, I find you can make this 5 stars if you add about 1 tsp of cumin and some chili flakes (just a pinch).

Spanish rice has always been that side dish that isn't missed and not always eaten, leaving way for the "real" food -- tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc.  HOWEVER, I made this recipe for our usual Sunday family dinner and it's the best Spanish rice I've ever made, had or eaten.  My husband had thirds.  It is so flavorful and so easy.  Side note:  I didn't have the chunky salsa so I just used the regular Pace medium heat picante sauce.  Delicious!!!

This is a great base for the recipe.  However, for one, I noted there weren't any spices listed to add to it to "give it a kick."  And the second thing I noted was it called for too much rice for the liquid listed.  I cut it down to just 1 cup of rice.  Also, while toasting the rice, I added 2 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of granulated garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cumin.   I make my own homemade salsa, so I used that instead of store bought.  This did the trick!  And for some texture and a little "paella" feel, I added 1 1/4 cups of frozen, precooked shrimp.  Came out fabulous and my husband loved it!

Easy to make, but not as flavorful as most spanish rice recipes.  I would not make this again usless I knew what other seasonings to add or a recommendation for a good salsa to use.

I've been making this for a year, definitely  better than the store bought quick bagged Spanish rice.,  healthier too. I make with whole grain rice, can't tell a difference. I use a whole bag of rice (4.5 cups) to freeze portion size containers of it for quick easy, defrost and heat in microwave side with Mexican meals. 
Thanks for sharing

I didn't measure my oil or onions and I used 3 bouillon cubes to two cups water for my broth. (I got those at $General so I figured they wouldn't be as good as Knorr). Other than that I grabbed regular salsa instead of chunky but next time I will make sure to get chunky. It had a great flavor and my Honduran husband liked it so I guess it tasted pretty authentic. I will definitely make this again!

Two key words: Easy & Delicious.  I followed the exact directions using long grain rice and it turned out perfect.  This wonderful recipe took me away from using my rice cooker.  You can take it in any direction tweaking it to your favorite flavors. Most important to me is the end result of the rice texture which came out perfect. Now if only I could add a 6th star. Thank you!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I cooked my rice a little too much in the first stage of "browning" and it made it a little crisp.  I also should not have peeked when it was simmering because it needed a little longer on the cooking process.  Still, tasted excellent and will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe, and the liquid was all absorbed before the rice was fully cooked, so I had to add about an extra 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I loved the consistency of the rice, and you can determine the spice level by the type of salsa you use. Everyone raved about it.

Didn't change the ingredients, just the method. After stir frying the rice, I placed it in a rice cooker with the chicken broth and salsa and let it cook.  Open rice cooker, give it a stir, and put it on warm mode.  Rice cooker keeps it warm even after it cooks and your pan is not scorched.

Great recipe! Experiment with different salsas. Salsas I like with chips, didn't make the best rice. Everyone's taste is different, so don't give up on the recipe until you've tried a variety of salsas. Even if you don't get that far... the rice will not be awful. Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe and it worked out great.  As other reviewers stated, you must saute the rice first. I used mild salsa because of the company we had, but it would be very easy to spice this up a little or a lot more, depending on how you like it. I will definitely be making this again!

Tastes just like Spanish rice from a restaurant! The flavors are subtle and exactly as I expected. I liked this recipe and will be making it again. My husband wanted something more flavorful. He generally doesn't like Spanish rice. Next time I make it, I may try chicken bouillon cubes rather than chicken broth since they give more flavor.

Very good. Would definitely make again.  The next time I will add about a tsp of salt. Used water instead of broth.  Added oregano and onion powder instead of onion.

For how much flavor this has, it is very easy to make.  The ratio of the ingredients is spot on, and the rice gets a lot of flavor from simmering with the salsa.  In a pinch (if you are missing ingredients) you can even skip the onion and use water instead of chicken broth -- it will still turn out okay (just not quite as flavorful and balanced).

I'm giving this 5 stars with my own personal modifications.  We like things a bit more spicy so after reading some of the reviews of it being "bland", I sautéed the onions and rice in Jalapeno Olive Oil, used Medium salsa and it was fabulous!  Absolutely will make this again!  And sooooo easy. Much better than the box stuff you buy in the store.

My husband is always skeptical of trying rice recipes that don't come from a box. After taking one bite, he said he'd never eat boxed rice again! I didn't change a thing and the rice turned out full of flavor and with a nice texture. I highly recommend. I'm making it for dinner tonight!

I actually didn't make any major changes to this recipe, and usually I do :).  The only thing I did was add fresh garlic after I saute'd the onion for a minute.  I have made this twice now, it is super easy and taste great!! Thanks for tasty recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe called. I followed the advice of Karen's review by adding the liquids BEFORE the rice browned AND bringing it to a rolling boil after the liquids were added before covering and reducing hear to low. Turned out perfect!

I tried the recipe as written and it's ok.  When I make it again I won't do the onions as they're unnecessary since there are onions in the salsa.  And I'll purée the salsa.  The chunks were really unappealing!  Overall though the flavor was good.

I've made this as a side before and it's really good and very easy. Recently, I made this rice in to a meal by adding ground beef, red beans, corn and cheese. It turned out really good. My family loved it and made it in to burritos.

This recipe, simple as it is, is GREAT!   I LOVE that, including oil, this recipe only uses 5 ingredients and it tastes GREAT!  Not too spicy, so totally kid friendly, but if you like a bit more kick to it, you can add in some cayenne pepper, hot sauce, etc.  according to your tastes!  
I totally agree with Karen Hintz that you MUST sauté the rice before adding the liquids in.  It just has to be done.  Believe me, if you try it, you will definitely notice the difference.   Doing so, this way, will ensure that your rice comes out PERFECT, not gummy like sometimes happens with rice.

it was very good and cheep to make, but the recipe did not say to cook the rice first which I thought was a little odd. so I made it without cooking the rice first and it came out a little crunchier than I would have liked. I do not know if using brown rice contributed to this at all but I would recommend at least partially cooking the rice before preparing this dish as specified. Other than that it turned out quite good, and using spicy salsa gave it an extra kick.

We doubled this, so 3 cups of rice, 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups salsa.

After reading some reviews I decided to pour in an extra cup of water while it was cooking.

Rice came out great! Everyone is a fan. Wish it were actually a little dryer... but that's just me.

Made as written (unusual for me). The rice was bland and lacked flavor and needed more than 20 minutes to cook. I felt the liquid was enough, but really needed seasoning.

As this was my first attempt to make Spanish rice, I was admittedly a little apprehensive. My luck with cooking rice to perfection begins and ends with Jasmine rice. While the household liked the dish, I think the salsa flavor was a little too assertive, and I think I will have to play around with the recipe to see if I can get it closer to what I am used to. As is, it's good...but it can be better.

Oh man this is an easy and delicious recipe. I'll be making this again and again for sure. I was worried that there would be a lot leftover since there are only two of us, but now I'm super stoked to have it for lunch tomorrow. High 5 to whoever posted this one!!!

This was a very easy recipe to follow. I had never made Spanish rice before and this worked as a great guideline. I now add some garlic in with the onions and use a can of Rotel instead of salsa. It is a favorite of the family!

Update....4/30/19  Continue to use this recipe after several years.   So very simple and it is also wonderful warmed over. 

 Wonderful recipe, family loves it, and I always make additional so I can freeze it for use later on.  Have made it many times.

I loved this recipe.  It was so simple to make. I used brown rice instead of the white rice and added a 1/3 more broth but after 30 minutes it still wasn't done so I added about another 1/2 c. of broth and cooked it 10 minutes longer. I definitely will make it again. No need to look for another recipe because this is a keeper.

Very good and easy recipe. As a tip, I tripled this recipe and cooked it in my Dutch oven. I think it suffered from the large batch size because some of the rice was still crunchy at the end of the cook time. I will try it again with correct proportions and see if the issue is resolved. I used pace medium restaurant style salsa and it was a perfect flavor.

I have made this several time. It tastes great and is easy to make. I never buy the box mixes at the grocery store any more. I follow the recipe exactly. I especially like the texture. The rice feels smooth, not at all sticky.  The overall texture of the dish is semi-moist. Because I am only cooking for two, there are always left overs. They warm up beautifully in the microwave.

Best Spanish rice I've ever made!! I tweaked the amount of salsa from 1 cup to half a cup and instead substituted the other half with diced tomatoes. I also mixed chicken tomato bouillon with the chicken broth to give it a more flavorful taste. It did not overpower anything at all. Thank you for this!

Texture was beautiful, but like a previous reviewer stated, it was really lacking in flavour. The salsa flavours just evaporate! With some ground sea salt, ground black pepper and tabasco sauce, it was gorgeous! Great texture though. I thoroughly recommend cooking the rice gently in oil first, this is how I cook my pilau rice. It gives perfect rice every time. Individual grains, not all stuck together in a soggy mess!

Very disappointed.... I went right by the recipe. It had no taste at all. I even added Cumin and Chile Powder and it didn't  help at all.

Perfect!! Just used more onion per a review. Took about 35 minutes to absorb all the liquid. Delicious! Use a good salsa!

I followed the recipe to a tee. It was very good and simple to make. We put it in wraps with taco flavored beef.  The family sprinkled on what they wanted.... tomatoes, cheese, lettuce etc. I thought it was more flavorful the next day.

This was awesome!  I only used one cup of rice and it was more than enough to feed my family of four.  For the salsa, I used half of a can of Great Value Fire Roasted Salsa Style Tomatoes... perfect!  Served it with sour cream chicken enchiladas and black beans... YUM!

I made this tonight to go with our beef tacos. I only used 1/2 a cup of the salsa as it was hot and my 4-year-old doesn't like anything too spicy. But in the end I felt like it was a bit bland. I don't think more salsa was the answer, but perhaps more onion and garlic. And maybe a bouillon cube as well? Not sure. I'll try it again but I'll play around with it a bit more.

This recipe is bland and not according to the true Spanish style of cooking.  Please add the following to make it proper Spanish Rice.
1 x Pinch of Salt and Pepper
1 x 1/4 Teaspoon of Paprika
1x 1/2 Teaspoon of Garlic Salt or fresh garlic
1 x 1/4 Teaspoon of Cumin
1 x 1/2 Teaspoon of chilli flakes
1 x Red Pepper

Followed the recipe exactly & after 15 minutes of cooking, there wasn't enough liquid to finish, but the rice was still hard. Flavor was ok, but I would use a medium salsa & more chicken broth if I tried this again.

Tastiest and EASIEST Spanish Rice I've ever made. Everyone ate it up and raved about how great it was. I doubled the recipe but otherwise changed nothing. Just...Follow the recipe people. You'll be OK.

I used Medium Pace Salsa, and it wasn't chunky. I didn't think it'd be spicy enough so I added chili flakes to the browning process of the rice. I was right and the flakes were a wonderful touch. I also sauteed some garlic with the onions just for fun, don't know if it made any significant difference though :p. I didn't have broth on hand so I used some bouillon to make some artificial broth which worked perfectly. I also reduced the serving size to three servings and it took about five minutes extra to cook through to the perfect consistency. I loved the end result!! would make again

This was very good. I didn't know what to make with Mexican stuffed chicken breasts, and this Spanish rice recipe was so easy and also so delicious. Thank you for this awesome recipe. I will be making this rice any time I make Mexican food!

I will definitely make this recipe again! It was delicious and easy to make. I did add cinnamon, turmeric, garlic, chilli powder, salt, and paprika because it was a little bit bland, along with green peppers with the onions for some more colour, and it tasted great! Delicious!

This is a keeper recipe. We made it as a side for tacos and fajitas, and everyone( 6 adults and 2 kids) liked it. I added some leftover fresh cooked corn off the cob. My only reason for 4 stars was that it was a little bit dry. Next time I will add a bit more chicken broth and be more careful of cooking time.  Definitely recommend.

The rice came out fluffy and delicious, and it was very easy to prepare. Be sure to control the temp you use when you saute the onion - keep it low enough to the onion only browns a little as it softens but doesn't burn.

I have made this about 3 or four times, and every time it gets a little better! I add a whole chopped onion, approx 1/2 cup more medium chunky salsa than recipe calls for. I also double the recipe for my family who thinks it taste better the second day.

My quest is over.  This was perfect, restaurant quality.

Note:  The salsa you choose will obviously define the flavor.  I use a spicier salsa.

It was just OK if you follow the recipe, but if you add extra onion (I used half a small onion rather than the 2 Tablespoons), and add a little bit of garlic powder, salt, and pepper, it's great!

Followed recipe but used 2T lard instead of oil or butter. Absolutely amazing texture and flavor. This is NOW my go-to recipe.

Tastes like it comes from a Mexican restaurant and is also good if you add a diced jalapeño without the seeds

Was pretty decent, although i used instant rice instead. It cut the cooking time in half. I will try long grain rice next time to see if theirs a difference.

MY REVISIONS: I fried 1 lb. of ground beef and used beef broth. Stirred in a little organic black bean dip at the end. One of my new favorites ??

Perfect! I used my homemade salsa that I canned last year, minute rice, and 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, per another posters suggestion, I didn't saute the rice because I like it soft, and it turned out perfect!

Mine cooked for 5 more mins (total: 25 mins). Then I let it sit 5 mins. 
I used 1c. tomato sauce, instead of salsa. Of course, I added garlic. Very delicious. 
This was my first time making Spanish rice, so to have it turn out yummy relieves my nerves. Very happy with its tastiness.

This is quick and easy and works well in my rice cooker.  I like the tanginess and flexibility of using salsa, allowing for different results depending on what kind of salsa I use ...honestly, that largely depends on what might be bogo at the store.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Easy and fantastic! I used Minute Rice (white), and had no chicken broth so used beef broth. Used Pace mild chunky salsa. Barely sauteed the rice to translucence in the fresh chopped onions and oil. I was worried about over-cooking the rice, but I trusted the recipe and cooked it for the 20 minutes. It was just right and was almost too easy. My husband absolutely loved this. Definitely making it again!

Wonderful flavor! I've made this twice now and both times I cooked it differently. The first time I cooked the rice as the recipe indicated and it was wonderful. The next time I steamed the rice in vegetable broth then stirred in the other ingredients because I read the recipe ingredients but forgot to read the directions so ended up using no oil. You know what? Just as good! So I guess do what you want and it turns out great.

This is so easy and it tastes great.  It was a little spicy for some but just right for others.  I used powdered onion and garlic because it was what I had and it still had great flavor.  I did stir it a couple of times while it was cooking because I had it in a saucepan instead of a skillet.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have any salsa so I used enchileda sauce and some stewed tomato and it worked very well. After it was done I put in a baking pan and then mixed in a pound of cooked hamburger some quartered black olives and Mexican blend cheese on top and put in oven at 350° until cheese was good and melted and had a meal done in no time. I've made this dish before but this rice was the best and easiest I'm using this recipe from now on. And will use the salsa like it calls for. My family really enjoyed it.

LOVE the idea of salsa in this!! In my opinion, the best tips for cooking directions  were clarified by KAREN HINZ .....check out her review under "most helpful". Thanks Karen!.  This site also has tips on cooking various GRAIN length and  types of rice.I like adding in the following ) much more onion...1/2 C total.I also like adding green and sometimes red bell peppers. It gives the dish a bit of a Pico de Gallo vibe..&more flavor. I also like adding 1 t. of minced garlic.....but I tend to think that about many of the recipes I save. LOL.
THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER.

FIVE STARS! Tasted almost exactly like our local tex-mex restaurant's rice... And yes the sautéing of the rice is super important so it doesn't end up sticky.  This is forever going to be the only way I make rice with my Mexican food dishes.

Very easy and extremely yummy! I let my rice brown a bit more than the recipe suggests, and I use a bit more onion, but other than that, I don't alter the recipe. I used Pace brand MEDIUM hot, chunky picante sauce - perfect!

I make this all the time. I add fresh garlic  with the onions. Don't wait too long before the broth is added, because it will start to burn. Don't need all to be brown, just when some are lightly turning.  I learned that the first time.

It was pretty easy to make, and very few ingredients. I substituted brown rice and it came out kind of tough. It probably needed more than the 20 mins suggested to cook covered. Will make again!

This is a good recipe and easy. I used brown rice since I'd didn't have white rice available and wish I would have due to texture differences. All-in-all, the spicing was really balanced and the dish was great as a leftover meal. Easy and tasty.

Our family (2 teenage boys) love,love this Spanish rice! No changes to the recipe. I use coconut oil and Pace's Chunky Salsa. Such a simple recipe- quick and just a few ingredients. We make it weekly. Delish!!

Wow, I cannot believe how good this came out!  I was very hesitant since so many others had problems with this recipe, but I followed the directions and it came out perfect.  I doubled the onion, added 2 cloves of minced garlic (just before adding the liquid), and added sea salt and fresh ground black pepper before serving.  I think it would have been a little bland without these additions.  I will definitely be making this every time I serve tacos or fajitas.

Overall a good dish. Although it was a little bland for me, so I added some minced garlic in with the onions, then about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to get it as spicy as I like it.

Made this recipe several times now over the years.  Instead of jar salsa, I use 1 can of diced tomato and 1/2 - 1 whole can of El Tapato Spicy Tomato sauce (depending on your heat tolerance) this is delicious and my kids love it too!  Thank you for recipe!

So SO good!! Didn't have chicken broth so I made some using 2 bullion cubes and 2 cups of water. Used walmart's Great Value brand Cantina style Mild salsa. Tastes, texture, color, everything is just like the mexican restaurants around!! Put it in a deep sauce dish, covered and didnt lift the lid for the full 20 mins, when I opened it and stirred it was like magic, like someone dumped out all my usual crappy rice and replaced it with restaurant rice LOL  WIll be our go to mexican/spanish style rice from now on!

This is the easiest and best Spanish rice! I've made it about a dozen times now and turns out great every time!  Sprinkle cayenne before you put the lid on and it will have a little kick.  Just about  a pinch!

I made this and it was easy and delicious. I did take some other reviewers' advice and increased the broth to 3 cups (as the ratio of rice to broth should be 1:2). It came out perfect when I cooked it for 30 minutes. I also used about 1/2 an onion since I like onion and had it leftover from the enchiladas I also made. Perfect combination.

I love this recipe it helped me in finding my grove with what works best for my family. I have how ever tweeted the recipe a bit. I add 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 and a smiggen over of ground comino because I love the taste and smell it reminds me of being a young girl and being at my grandmothers home when she would cook family meals. 

You must sauté the rice just till it gets a little color it helps it to cook in this recipe. I add fresh tomatoes for taste/ look with the onions and about 1/3 of a can tomato sause for flavor and look because this is what helps to color the rice just the way the salsa does. Depending on who I'm feeding depends on if I do or don't add the salsa. 

I also add a few other seasonings but very lightly: garlic powder, onion powder, seasonal salt (low salt) and pepper. Before putting the lid on for the summer I taste the broth just a few drops in the palm or a spoon how ever you prefer to see how it tastes. This isn't a dish that you can check on half way through lifting the lid ruins it and to much water makes it sticky or soggy. Boy have a learned over the years. I honestly believe that making the chicken broth before hand (bouillon cubes and water, is how I do it) makes a world of difference in this rather then how my mom throws in the water and the cubes into the pot before putting on the lid. 

I've taken this for potluck parties, giving it to friends that I know love the it but aren't able to or can't make it for them selves and serve it to my fa

Used brown rice instead of white.  The salsa I used was not quite right - next time will make homemade salsa to use.  A bit too tomato-y for me!  That said, good starter recipe.

I lived in south Texas more than half of my life, and this recipe measures up to authentic TexMex Spanish Rice in flavor and texture after I made the following adjustments for my preference: 1/4 - 1/3 c. onion rather than 2 T, plus 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic, and 1/4 t. ground cumin added while sauteing the rice. At the very end, I moved the pan off the hot burner and let everything sit covered for 5 minutes to finish absorbing any moisture before fluffing the rice.

This was excellent.  I used equal parts rice and broth because I made it with Minute rice. I also used restaurant style salsa.

This is by far my go to recipe for Spanish rice. We live in Texas so it was hard to find a good one, I tried a lot of them on here. This is the winner!!

I love this recipe. So easy! When I make it I make my own broth using 2 soft chicken bouillon cubes (Knorr) and I add a tablespoon or 2 of powdered beef bouillon too. Gives it a very rich flavor. I also add a can of beans (red, black, or kidney beans). For the Salsa, any medium will do just fine, but the Aldi brand organic seems to taste the best to me. I don't add onions either. I don't open the lid at all during cooking. That seems to make sure it cooks just right. I could eat this all the time.

This is the easiest spanish rice to make with lots of flavor.  I use a ½ of an onion, 2 tablespoons is not enough plus I add a whole chopped up green or red pepper too.  Saute the onion, pepper and rice all together, don't forget to saute the rice too.  Everything else is the same. Perfect side for my turkey tacos.  Outstanding!

I was skeptical at first because it seemed too easy, but it was amazing. The salsa adds so much flavor with minimal effort. This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on. I added saffron for a brighter color.

As is, it's a little too bland.  Adding a little salt in addition to the broth and some chili powder makes it better.  I like that it's an easy recipe to make with things I always have in my pantry.

A great recipe. Fast and easy. For a little more zing, add small diced bell pepper or 2 or 3 small jalapeño.  Favorite hot sauce to taste.

This is the best base guide to follow. I added 1/4 jalapeno and 1/4 green and 1/4 red peppers for extra spice and traditional flavor. It came out PERFECT and I am a spanish rice snob. I recommend adding those peppers for flavor.

I have tried this recipe as written a while ago, and it was the best. Sorry I just now rated it but, I had to say that the directions on the video are different than what is stated in the written recipe about browning the rice. Written says "until rice begins to brown." The video says stir in broth after 5 minutes. This may be the confusion for some.

I made this recipe in my instant pot electric pressure cooker, so after sautéing the onions and rice, I added the remaining ingredient and set the cooker to low pressure for 10 minutes followed by a slow release.  I used uncle bens parboiled rice, and a medium salsa. Came out great, will definitely make again!

I constantly struggle to make Spanish rice.  It's good one time then not so good the next time.  This recipe is delicious, easy and the best Spanish rice I have ever made. It is dry and fluffy like it should be and the seasoning is perfect.  My family loved it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I have made this rice many times. It's not mushy, which we love. The only thing I do differently is I use 1 3/4 - 2 cups of rice for the same amount of liquid. It almost tastes like the rice we get at our local go-to Mexican restaurant!

Simple and easy, great flavour.  An obvious (to me) step the instructions that's missing is to bring the mixture up to a good boil before lowering the heat and covering.
--- Made this many times as directed.  Last time, I cooked for 15 minutes, then stirred in a half cup of frozen peas (corn would be great, too), and covered for another 10 minutes.

It's so simple that I had to try this out for myself. I didn't have any onions at home so that's the only thing I left out and it still came out pretty good! Being Mexican myself, this sure makes making rice so much easier. Next time I will cook the onion in the oil, incorporate the rice and add a clove of chopped garlic for a little more flavor! The salsa and the chicken broth give it a grand flavor!

Great recipe!  I make it all the time after I found this recipe and it works with all types of salsa.  I increased the onion and added some garlic but its unnecessary.  Would definitely make it again and recommend you try it!

This rice is really simple and tastes really nice. Take the time to sauté your rice and onions. The flavor comes from the salsa you use, so choose a salsa you like. I used chi-chi's mild, it's not my favorite but it's all I had on hand. It made the rice tart. Next time I will use a better salsa. I like this recipe because you don't have to add salt. Will make it again.

I pretty much made this as is and it was delicious! I couldn't believe how simple it was- which is what I needed since I was in a hurry and didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand. The only thing I had to do different was I used a chicken bouillon cube instead of chicken broth. (Only used 1 because I cut the recipe in half)

I made this last night and it was a hit with our whole family. I will definitely make it again.

Based on other reviews, I used more onion and added some cumin. I used a small diced onion, and added about 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I also didn’t “peek” into the pot during the cooking time (some other reviewers suggested that is the key to getting the rice fully cooked in the assigned cooking time. It worked for me.)

I was looking for a Spanish rice dish in a pinch to make with a saucy Mexican chicken and this was so much better than I expected! Made as directed with better than bouillon since I was out of broth and even my picky son loved it. Definitely recommend!

This is a really good recipe as is.  Although I did change it to our taste by adding some diced green pepper with the onion.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies along with the salsa.  I needed a little more liquid, so I added another cup of chicken broth.  Rice also needed to cook for 30 minutes total, but that might just be my stove.   Thank you so much for a great recipe.

Added 1/2 t chili powder and 1/4 t cumin, along with 3 cloves of garlic, minced, to the rice after the first couple of minutes of sauteeing. Just before serving, sprinkled shredded Mexican cheese mix over to melt. Served with more salsa. Easier than any Spanish Rice I've ever made and as good or better. Look forward to making this again!

Bf said it was the best Spanish rice he's ever had. It was perfect and I loved it too.  I used veggie broth and added diced potato and carrot with the onion.  Use fire roasted salsa if you can.

This is a good, easy basic recipe. I saute the rice in lt olive oil, and added more onion, maybe twice as much, and a dusting of habanero pepper. I also use my home made salsa.

I followed the directions except I added some cumin and chili powder when adding the broth and salsa.  It was very tasty and fluffy - follow the directions to sauté the rice before adding the liquid.

I used brown rice and half a small can of tomato paste and one tomato instead of the salsa. I also added about 1.5 tsp of chili and a pinch of pepper to bolster the flavour. Because I used brown rice, I needed to cook it for an extra 15-20 minutes.

The title says it all: this is the best Spanish rice.  Very quick and easy to whip up when you need a side dish for a Mexican meal.  For the salsa I use an undrained can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (like Rotel).

I make this rice all the time.  It's yummy and easy.  Especially with the changes I made.  I just use 2 TB dehydrated minced onion instead of fresh, I use brown rice instead of white, up the broth by a quarter cup and finally I just add a 10 oz can of rotel and put it all in my rice cooker and push the button!

I've always struggled with Spanish rice. I know, it shouldn't be that hard and this wasn't. It was light and fluffy and the  flavor was great, not overwhelming. I've tried other much more complicated recipes that I thought should be good and they weren't. You will not be disappointed in this recipe. I made no changes.

I found that 2 cups of Chicken Broth made my rice very "wet" more like porridge. I guess it's because I used Asian Jasmine Rice which tends to be more moist than other rice grains. To fix the issue I used 1.5 Cups of Chicken Broth and it came out PERFECT! Nice and moist, but not too much.

Love it!  The best thing is that you can easily customize this by trying different salsas. Even my child who usually doesn't eat rice liked it. I did use a whole onion and increased the broth to 4 cups since I used brown rice.

This is the best Spanish rice I have ever had in my life.  I like things to be flavorful and I followed this recipe exactly as instructed.  I did not brown the rice as some others recommended not to do but I did cook it with the oil and onion until it was slightly translucent.  I also took the recommendation from another person who reviewed this and used Pace Chunky  Salsa-Medium.  I  used some of the Spanish rice as a filler for some enchiladas I made.  A+

I have made this several times. I like the simple ingredients and directions. 
I always add garlic salt and tomatoes with chilies and double the salsa. Comes out perfect every time. People need to remember ,you have to season everything.

Awesome. Only change was adding 1/3 of a chopped bell pepper with the onion. Well, and adjusted the servings for 2 peeps. Was very delicious. Going to try with quinoa.

This recipe truly is the best homemade Spanish rice I've had. It is restaurant quality! I have even "healthified" this recipe a bit for those watching calories. Used riced cauliflower, omitted chicken broth, reduced oil to 1 &1/2 tbsp, added spices to make up for broth (onion/garlic powder, oregano, black pepper), and fried it all up. Obviously the texture is different, but the taste is still amazing!

This was pretty good. We live overseas where good Mexican/Spanish food is VERY difficult to come by, so we have to make our own. I did fry my rice, which made the cooking time much longer. I only cooked 1 cup of rice, and used 2 1/4 cups water (per the rice directions), but it took about 30-40 minutes for the rice to soak up the water. Even then the rice was pretty firm - almost crunchy. Next time I think I won't fry my rice for more than about a minute.

Family loved this wonderful recipe.  Fast and easy to pull together.  Next time I do this dish I will add some diced green pepper with the onion to add a little color.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a great basic recipe. I made it healthier and tastier by using brown rice and a combination of vegetables (chopped) and spices that we were using for fajitas. It did need more broth and a longer cooking time.

I love this recipe and use it all the time! I cut my cooking time down so it's not as dry.  Goes great with Gary's Turkey Burritos! I use bullion cubes instead of the broth, but that's generally because I forget to buy broth.  :) All in all, love it!

Just made this tonight! I added garlic powder (1/2 - 1 TBLSPN) and about 1 tsp. of Tajin Clasico Seasoning! This was so easy to make and was a fantastic accompaniment to the fish tacos I made!! My boyfriend loved it too! This is a "pinner" - I've saved to my Pinterest page so I can make it again!!

This turned out great! Probably didn't brown the rice enough and I know I didn't get quite enough chicken stock in (used on 14.5oz can) so after 20 minutes it was still a little crunchy. I added 1/4c water and that solved the issue. Next time I'll probably just add a little more salsa to make up for the missing stock. Will probably add a little more onion and maybe some green chilies just for a little extra pop next time too.

Super easy and very tasty. I did change well add a few things since I wanted more a one step dish. I added 1 lb ground beef, 1 small onion, 1/2 bell pepper and a large celery stock.    The rest I did as directed. It did need a little extra chicken stock and I added extra salsa because it dried out before it was cooked to my liking. Over all very good and filling.

I made a batch for 35 people for the 4th of July. It turned out wonderful. I will definitely make it again, and I highly recommend this recipe. I have tried others that were much more bland. The salsa gives it just enough kick.

Totally impressed!  I followed the recipe exactly and used Pace medium salsa and the flavor was so good!  It is a perfect side dish for many things.  My pan's lid wasn't was tight fitting so when time was up rice was not completely done.  I just put the lid back on and turned the heat up a little bit.  It was perfectly done in another five minutes. Everyone really liked it.  I typically find rice in a Mexican restaurant very unexciting this was 100% better.

I really wanted to love this recipe. However, I couldn't get the rice to be fluffy. I'm not sure if I browned it too long or did something else wrong? After I added some water, the rice got a little bit more fluffy, but I really had difficulty getting the rice to absorb the liquid.

Delicious! Though, I did use a whole onion (as someone else suggested) and added a tablespoon of butter after chicken broth & salsa.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Simple, easy recipe that pairs nicely with a Mexican dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Sauteing onions with oil and rice is the key!  Gives the rice a great flavor.

Very easy to make and taste as good as restaurant Spanish rice, even better than some. I added extra water, approx. 1/4 cup, to avoid scorching the rice and 1/2 cup corn with ours but even without the corn, it's delicious.

I made this last night and it was perfect!  I did add a bay leaf and cumin (advice from one of the reviewers) and it was awesome.  I should have listened to another reviewer where she said medium salsa was enough heat as I used hot salsa, and it was really hot.  Overall, I will make this many times over!

I never thought of using salsa in place of tomato sauce for Mexican rice.. EXCELLENT suggestion as it made it fabulous!  I also tried one cube of chicken bouillon and 1 cube of beef bouillon to the 2 cups of water.  This is my favorite :)

Easy, Delicious and the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! I wanted to make it HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE so I  used  2 cups of INSTANT BROWN RICE,  I also used OLIVE OIL and increased salsa to 1 1/3 cups using Walmart great value mild, chunky salsa, along with the other ingredients in the recipe and it was done in 20-25 minutes.  HEALTHY and delicious.

I've never felt the need to review a recipe but I am always thankful for the people that do. I love reading the honest opinions and using everyones tips to tweak a recipe for the better. I just finished making this recipe for the first time and it tastes so incredible I had to let everyone know! I scaled it back a bit to serve fewer people. Here are my slight variations: equal parts (1 cup) salsa, chicken broth and rice. I chose to use olive oil but also added a Tbsp of butter for a slight butter flavor. I also chose to use green onions vs. white or yellow and I was very generous with the amount (approx. 3/4c or so). I think the most important tip is to use a well made salsa. I used leftover salsa from my local Mexican restaurant so naturally it was restaurant style vs. chunky but it didn't matter because the taste is wonderful. Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

We've always used tomato paste to give it the red color along with chicken bouilion or broth, Cumin, garlic, onion, pepper and a little onion salt. I believe the cumin gives it more of a Mexican flavor so I did add some. This recipe takes less time to prepare so I will definitely repeat it.

This was an excellent recipe that I didn't change a thing. I used Pace salsa and I sautéed the onions and then the rice as the recipe instructed. This made a delicious side with minimal effort. Family loved it and I will be making this again.

THis turned out perfect! I used my homemade canned salsa and heated the chicken broth before adding it to the rice and onion. I used 1/2 of an onion. Nice and fluffy and great flavor!

Will make again. Not sure I agree with the cook in Twenty Minutes assessment. 

Then again I decided to use Brown Basmati, so it took like an hour and a half, and I had to almost triple the liquid. Super tasty though, and a great place to start.

Great recipe. Pick the salsa depending on how spicy you want it. When I've been out of salsa I have used fire roasted tomatoes instead with just a few spices include a little red pepper. This is my go-to recipe for Spanish rice on taco night!

ive tried this recipe twice and it doesn't turn out. The rice turns out crunchy cause it doesn't cook in 20 minutes. The liquid is soaked up so quick it just ends up burning the rice, this is more like an all day recipe instead of quick and easy.

Made it per recipe. It was really bland. If I could recommend somethings to add it would be: salt and a dash of lemon or lime. You could probably add some fresh cilantro too. It is lovely that it is so easy to make, but it definitely isn't as flavorful as the Spanish-Puerto Rican rice my mom makes. I think I'll stick to her more complex recipe.

I've tried about 15 or 20 different Spanish rice recipes over the years as its one of my favorite sides to accompany Mexican and Spanish cuisine.  Some have been better than others, but nearly all have fallen short.  I didn't think this one would be any good because there are so few ingredients, but decided to try it since I was cooking for a picky eater who likes food with fewer, simpler ingredients.  Success!!!  I will never, ever use another recipe again.  I've made it several times since and it has never let me down.  I cook from scratch, however because of food allergies in my household, so instead of using store bought salsa, I mix a can of organic tomatoes (or a few fresh that are quartered), a quarter cup of loosely chopped onion, with a good bunch of chopped cilantro, salt, garlic clove, a few slices of pickled jalepeno, and some pickled jalepeno juice, pulse a few times in a food processor, and use that, with the extra saved for the main meal.  I usually add a bit of cumin to the rice and some fresh chopped cilantro after its cooked.

I really like the cooking method.  As written mine was fairly bland, but I would assume if I'd used a more flavorful salsa that would not have been the case.  I ended up adding cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes and it was great!

Wow, this recipe is so similiar to a recipe that my family has been using for several generations. We use homemade salsa, but store bought salsa works well too. The only thing missing is a tsp of mexican oregano added to the rice while it's browning. That little step adds so much flavor to the rice. What i like about this recipe is the ratio of salsa and chicken broth to rice is perfect. The rice isn't mushy or undercooked. In the past I've had to press the liquid from the salsa and add that to the broth, then add the pressed salsa to the rice and saute for a min or two before adding the liquid. I agree that the rice should be browned, it gives the rice a more robust flavor. I also like to add diced green chiles to mine for a little more kick. All in all this is a very good recipe and i think i will follow your ratio instead of eyeing it like i've been doing (sorry abuela)thanks for a quick and easy recipe!!

I love this recipe. It's fast easy & delicious. I make it as side all the time. I also add cut up chicken breast, 2 cups of vegetables & a can of black olives. Tastes just like my moms chicken & rice she made when we were kids.

super easy and yummy to make.  surprised that I didn't need to use achote.  to add extra flavor, i like to saute onions AND bacon before adding the rice.  you can't go wrong with bacon!

this was spot on.   I used bacon fat and added bell pepper and salt and black pepper.  Awesome addition, next time may add some jalapeño for fun

The recipe as-is is only worth about two stars but the idea was a great starter and quick.  I used an entire chopped onion which I browned, then added 1 tsp minced garlic and cooked it for 30 seconds before adding the rice.  I did brown the rice before adding the liquid but I won't do that next time as I didn't appreciate the bite.  I used the Safeway Deli salsa which is excellent, added 1 small can of diced green chiles, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt, pepper and also used 3 cans of low- sodium chicken broth (14.05 oz) as even for basic rice the recipe is 1:2 (rice to water.)  This is a far better alternative than boxed Spanish rice and nearly as fast, so thanks.

Before finding this recipe I experimented for years trying to recreate that Mexican restaurant-style rice. This one comes closer than anything else I have tried, and I have since made it no less than a dozen times. I typically use brown rice, and add a handful of frozen, diced carrots and peas when I add the broth for color. Though I had never bought Pace picante sauce for my own consumption before, I tried it based on the other reviews and really liked it. Now I buy the big jugs of it at the warehouse store just for this dish. I always make a double batch and freeze half.

This is good. A little salty for me but I over did it on the chicken bullion.  More is not always better. I used spicy canned salsa and it added an extra bit.

KID APPROVED!!! I made this for the first time last night and my family loved it! They couldn't get enough and kept going back for more. My kids RAVED about it. This recipe will definitely go down in my cookbook as a family favorite and I will share it with everyone I know. It is appropriately named and so easy you could do it in your sleep. Thanks for the recipe!

I find that recipe's from the south east tend to be more flavorful. I found this to be dry and bland. I guess its kinda like country gravy, everyone has an opinion of who's is better

Excellent!!! This will be made frequently in my home! Made it exactly as is. Here's how the conversation went:Me:"Honey, will you taste this and see if you think it needs anything"? Boyfriend: "It's perfect" (Next time I may try it with brown rice and see how that turns out)

I added a pound of ground beef after cooking the onion, then followed the recipe as written from there. It was a quick delicious complete meal. The only thing I'll do differently next time is add a smidge more liquid, perhaps an extra 1/2 cup of broth. Try this. You won't be sorry.

Perfect Spanish rice made so simply! I didn't add the onion, and pureed my chunky salsa in the blender for a smoother addition to the recipe. (My son wanted a plain, but delicious Spanish rice, lol, and this recipe sure is a hit!) Also, I think lightly browning the rice first helps it to come out nice and fluffy, don't skip that step!

Excellent spanish rice.  Could not be any easier.  I used water with chicken stock paste.  Loved that the rice wasn't sticky.  Must try for a quick and easy rice.

Not spicy enough and a bit too tomatoish (probably owing to the whole salsa thing).  I would love to see a recipe with the spices etc and not so much tomato.

This is a delicious quick recipe. I used a time-saver to speed up the recipe. 

I cook my rice in a rice cooker in the morning; this allows me to have the rice ready to cook with later in the day. When I start the recipe in the evening, I first sauté the onions, then add the cooked rice followed by the salsa. Finally, I add one cup of vegetarian broth to the rice and allow it to simmer to remove excess water.

It's delish and all that much quicker ;)

Great recipe, only substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the chunky salsa, I didn't have any.  Made a large quantity of 4 cups.  I used 2 1/2 cups of liquid per cup of rice, covered it and let it come to a hard boil, then turned off the heat and let it continue to cook for 25 minutes, it was perfect!  Just don't be tempted to uncover during the last 25 minutes, it'll be perfect.

Omg!!! This recipe is the bomb. This was my first time making it and it can out so perfect. I use hot picante sauce instead of salsa along with the chicken broth. Can you say "Yummy"! My husband even enjoy it and his not a big fan of the spicy food. So I definitely will be making this again. Best Spanish Rice

I should have read more of the reviews before making this. I didn't use 1 cup of rice - instead using the 1.5 cups the recipe calls for - and my rice was still crunchy after the specified cooking time. I let it steam for an additional 5 minutes here-and-there, checking it each time the timer went off, until it had steamed for an additional 20 minutes, but it still had some crunchy bits. By this time the rest of my meal was cold so I had to give up on the rice. Despite not being done, I liked the flavor. I'd make this again, but use the correct rice-to-water ratio.

I used olive oil and half a white onion and two cloves minced garlic. Also, before adding the broth and salsa I added 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp ground coriander. Also, I used fresh salsa with fresh coriander in it.  Worked out very very well.

I made this rice and it was delicious! I made a few changes. I added 2 cloves chopped garlic and mixed tomato sauce & salsa. Very good.

This was great Spanish rice. It was the first time i tried making Spanish rice. It worked well with the fajitas I made. I used minute rice because that is what I had. I think regular rice would have been better. I would have browned it a little longer too. Also, I was fearful of adding so much of the salsa, but that would have been okay too. It was VERY easy, and tasty. Will definitely make this again. I used about 3/4 cup of Paul Newman's medium salsa.

This recipe is fantastic!!!! I used more onion than the recipe called for and added 1 tsp of garlic. Fried my rice until translucent. I didn't have any salsa so I substituted mild Rotel and Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning. Spicy and yummy. Best Spanish Rice I've ever had.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I used Pace salsa medium, which added some spice to it. Next time I plan on using Pace mild just because I'm not crazy about spicy things. I was surprised how well the flavors blended. ii want sure about the ingredients but it didn't taste like you just threw salsa into some rice. thus recipe is something we'll be making regularly new. love it

This was a huge hit at my house and I was really proud of it!  My first attempt at Spanish rice.  I used half the salsa because I was out but my family likes things mild.  I used Jasmine rice and doubled the recipe.  It was fantastic!  Cheese on top was really good.

Yum! So flavorful.
I added hamburger, chili, garlic.
Maybe I'll add a little more chili powder for an extra punch.

This is an old standby at our house. We whip it up and keep it in the fridge for quick burrito lunches during the work week. 

I made a couple of alterations: Use butter instead of oil to coast the rice. And use an entire tub of salsa instead of 1 cup.

Much better than the bag and boil Spanish rice mixes.  I too, like other reviewers have been taught the rice is supposed to be cooked in the oil until translucent.  If it gets brown when its white rice, it has a nearly burnt taste-at least that's my own experience. Suggestions welcome!  Only thing extra I added was a heaping dash of Badia complete seasonings.

A little too "wet" for our liking.  Also, it didn't have enough of a salsa flavor.  I think if I try this again I'll use less chicken broth and more salsa.

I thought this was really good and a super simple recipe. I added more onions than it asked for and it didn't seemed overwhelming at all! the only thing is, i should have watched it closer because the bottom of it had a crust. other than that, REALLY GOOD!

I've made this many times and it always comes out great. Sometimes I add a little extra water and simmer longer. I also like to add corn and black beans.

Super easy and super yummy!  I decreased the amounts because there are only 2.5 of us.  I sauteed the onions and rice, and I think that is what made it creamy and nutty.

This rice turned out excellent! What was really impressive, though, was that I made it with brown rice. I had to add a little more liquid and cook for about 45 minutes, but it was worth he wait for the added nutrition! Really impressive flavor, my boyfriend and I both loved it.

So good and so easy! My whole family loved it! It does take longer than 20 minutes to cook, but it is worth the wait. A great base for any Mexican dinner or side dish.

This had a good flavor but if you need a large quantity learn from my mistake and make it in small batches until you have the amount you need. I tried to hurriedly make a lot at once and it kept soaking up all of my liquid, sticking and not getting done.

I have never made Spanish rice and needed it to complete a dinner. i just started cooking for myself an found this recipe to be very tasty, and importantly, very easy. I might modify it as i go along, but as is, it is terrific. Four Stars!

So for years I've been using a different spanish rice recipe that I found on this site - I'm done with that one now.  THIS is how spanish rice is supposed to taste!!  And it's so much easier to make!  I don't recommend boiling the rice or doing this in the microwave....spanish  rice isn't supposed to be mushy.  Totally worth sauteeing it in a pan first.  YUM!  Thanks...!

I made this rice, but with a few key modifications.  First, after adding in the liquids, I allowed it to come to a full boil for about 2 minutes before allowing it to simmer.  Secondly, having made this before and finding it to be a bit bland (and simmering it for nearly an hour because I followed the directions exactly, without allowing it to boil first), I went ahead and added salt, garlic powder and onion powder.  I found that it was far more flavorful this time around.   As with any Spanish rice recipe, sautéing the rice is a critical step that you will pay for in flavor and texture if you skip.

I liked this recipe but found it needed some tweaking. I had to use  2-14.5 oz. cans of broth as the rice was still under cooked using only 2 cups. Also, I did not find the dish had enough spice. I used medium salsa this time but I am thinking to use hot for next time. However I will only be using more like  1/2 cup, as I think too much  salsa took away from the overall sticky consistency I was looking for with this dish. Also, I added a few dashes of chili powder because again,  I wanted more of a kick.

I've tried this recipe 2 times now....... I swear I can't get it right!! The rice was either over cooked and dry or it was under cooked with no liquid left! BUT! It had great flavor..... Im not going to give up! I have a feeling that tonight is going to be the night it's going to turn out!

I halved this recipe since it was pretty easy to do so. I didn't use regular oil (vegetable or canola) but used olive oil instead. Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly.

My husband and I agreed it was SO BLAND. I used a hot salsa but that did nothing to add flavor to it. I eventually added a pinch of salt and that helped. My husband topped his with more salsa while I topped mine with cheese.

If I make this again, I'm going to maybe add some garlic or chopped jalapenos or maybe even some cumin to add some flavor. A bit of a disappointment.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it exactly as it specifies in the recipe.  Even my husband liked it and he doesn't usually eat rice!  This is the closest to the canned version they used to sell in all of the stores but now I can't find it except for one thing.  The rice isn't as mushy.  It's way better this way and oh so good.  I served it with pork.

I made this New Year's Day and it was wonderful.  I will definately make this again. It was so easy to make. Recipe said serving size is 1/5 of the servings. I was not real sure how to measure that, as I am on Weight Watchers and trying to keep track.

Needed a little more onion (1/2 cup) and 1 1/2 cup salsa to suit me.  Then, I added 1 clove of garlic.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party along with chili, and it was a hit! I used a leftover duck broth that I made for Xmas, and I added some cumin, some corn and carrots. First I made it in the morning, refrigerated it, and  reheated it for the party in the oven with cheddar cheese on top. Delicious! I'll be making this one again. Thank you!

Tastes delicious! I used quinoa instead of rice- took a few more minutes to cook, but still tasted great (also added a little bit of cooked hamburger and Italian sausage to make it into a lunch instead of a side dish). I'll be making this again.

Mine turned out perfect...I used Pace chunky salsa, medium.  I followed the recipe to the tea.  Best Spanish rice we've ever had.

Super yummy!  Pretty quick and easy, which is awesome.  To be fair, I used a small can of Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa.  I think I'd like salsa a little better, but either way, it was delicious!

Made this to fill burritos and am impressed something so easy tastes so great.  I added diced yellow and green bell pepper and 1/2 a jalapeno with the onion.  I might add frozen peas next time.

I definitely found this easy to make- I also found it very tasteless.  If you aren't comfortable with adding your own spices to make it have more flavor, I recommend you try another recipe.  Otherwise, this would be fine as long as it is spiced more.

This is an excellent spanish rice recipe!  It delivers consistent results, and my family requests it often.  It is a staple of our burrito nights.  I find the onion to be optional (if I don't have it, the rice still turns out fine); when I don't use the onion, I decrease the oil to 1 T.

absolutely amazing. So simple if you make more than the 5 portions expect it to take a little bit longer for the rice to become tender. I made this for a mexican style potluck at work and everybody loved it.

I used brown rice instead of white rice. I had to add about an extra cup of water.  instead of salsa, I used Rotel Diced tomatoes and green chilies. It turned out so delicious, everyone loved it.

This rice was fantastic.  I used Pace mild salsa and the taste was just right - I wasn't sure the salsa would give it the right taste, but it did. I will definitely make this again.

This turned out wonderful! The texture was perfect! I've tried other versions but this one is the best yet. The salsa I used was medium whioh turned out too spicy for my kids, but my husband and I loved it.

Easy and delicious!  Followed directions to a tee (used Jasmine scented long grain white rice, Pace mild chunky salsa, Swanson's chicken broth) and the rice came out perfectly.  Yummy!

This is similar to the recipe I've used for years. I follow the recipe except add more onion (around a half cup). I add a can of Rotele. This adds extra liquid and an added depth to the taste. I try to keep a bag of either chopped or sliced mixed peppers and onions in the freezer. I often use them when I don't want to bother with chopping up an onion. I save the salsa for after the rice is done. We mix in a bunch of shredded cheese, top with sour cream and salsa, leftover taco meat is also a great addition.

I agree with other users that there is not enough liquid. I used only 1 cup of rice and the ratio is much better. Tasty recipe though, and much quicker prep than traditional Spanish rice recipes.

Very good! So much better than the boxed stuff, and healthier too, without all the chemicals and preservatives!  I didn't use the onion, I don't really like them.  I combined 3 different kinds of salsa (finished off the open bottles in my fridge!) to make 1 cup and added a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) as well.  It turned out very good, and I will definitely make this again!

This was so easy.  I put half a cup of salsa instead of a cup because I didn't want it spicy.  Turned out great, practically cooked itself. Family loved it with tacos.  So easy to do.

I have made it several times and like it enough. It is lacking something (like MSG, which I would never use), but to me, all Spanish Rice recipes do. Maybe it is designed to be on a bland side since it is a side dish...

So delicious! My husband absolutely loved them and he's not big on rice. I only had a cup of brown rice left so that's what I used. But I still kept the 1 cup of salsa. I used a canned salsa ranchera which was pretty delicious. I also added some garlic to the rice while I was sautéing it. I still used 2 cups of broth (1can) because brown rice needs more liquid anyways. Turned out very good.

This spanish rice is straight up comfort food!  It is super easy to make, DELICIOUS, and it makes great leftovers, so you can enjoy it for days.  I originally made it to accompany chicken fajitas, though it is great on it's own (or mixed with a little sour cream and cheddar cheese), on a taco salad, or in burritos.  My husband, who is the pickiest eater I know, LOVES it.  I make it several times a month and it comes out perfectly every time.  I would make it more often, but I fear I might eat the whole batch and supersize myself!  I like to sneak extra veggies into everything I make, so with this I use a whole onion and at least one bell pepper.  Other things I will likely try in the future include corn, celery, carrots, or peas.  I might even get away with some chopped up cauliflower.  I also like the idea of using brown rice to "healthy it up" a little bit.  We'll see if my hubbie even notices...  Enjoy :)

Better than any spanish rice I have ever had. This has become a family staple and a requirement any time we have tacos, taco salad, burritos, fajitas, etc... My oldest daughter loves it and she doesn't even like rice. I make it per the recipe except I use chicken bouillon cubes(2) instead of chicken broth as I usually don't have chicken broth on hand. I also use 3 cups of water with the bouillon cubes as I found I was always adding water as it cooked down too fast. Sometimes we add leftover chicken to it to make it a meal all by itself. My family would give this 10 stars if they could.

First of all, I made this for work for a taco bar food day.  Prepared it Thursday night at about 10 oclock after a 12 hour day.... so Easiness... 5 star!!!!!!!  Everyone really liked it when I brought it to work... taste 5 star (use a salsa to match your spice preference).  And for left-overs, since my husband doesn't like tacos or much mexican-ish foods, I used the rice for stuffing for peppers... He raved about that.  So versatility 5 stars!!!!!

Delicious! I needed a quick easy recipe using rice that was gluten free and dairy free, and oh, by the way I also had a jar of salsa that I needed to finish. I made this for a large group and I served it with vegetarian chili. Rave reviews! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Loved it! The only change I made based on the suggestions from the other reviews was I used only 1 cup of brown rice and had to cook it for about 50 minutes instead.

My youngest daughter really likes red rice from Rubios so I endeavored to make it at home using my rice cooker.  This recipe was her favorite of the three that I tried.  I used the saute setting on my rice cooker to cook the onion, then added the rice, letting it brown just a bit.  I substituted Rotel tomatoes & chilis for the salsa and added 1/2 t. of cumin.  I turned the rice cooker to white rice and let it cook as I would any white rice.  It turned out perfect!

I had to add 1-2 cups more liquid and cook for an hour, but it's quite tasty.  I also sauteed chopped green bell pepper with the onions and added a little chili powder.  Will definitely make again!

I will have to say this spanish rice beats anything you can get in a pouch or box. We loved it. I used some of the rice to go inside some beef enchilads I also made from this site. This was an Awesome dish

This is really good rice - and I don't even like rice!  My only mistake was keeping the temperature too high after I added the broth and salsa - it looked like way too much liquid to be absorbed when I first added it, so if it looks like way too much liquid to you, still lower the temperature - it will absorb and turn out great.

I didn't have Spanish rice on hand to go with the Beef Enchiladas II (from allrecipes) that I was making, and found this. I used Brown Rice - Fantastic! Such an easy twist and the whole fam loved it!

Deliciosa! I used real chicken juice left over from cooking the chicken in the "Quick and Easy Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole" as part of the chicken broth the rice recipe calls for and it was amazing! The rice and the casserole dishes compliment each other perfectly, too.

Easy and yummy.  I made it with petite canned tomatoes instead of salsa because it was all I had.

needed this for a Mexican night dinner, on a hot summer night!  It was great and so easy!  I did make a few changes, I only used 1 cup of rice and used canned 15.5 chicken broth and a can of rotel tomatoes with green chili peppers. also one whole small onion.  this is a keeper!

I needed a side for the Spicey Lime Grilled Chicken and didn't have a quick package rice so I made this since I had the ingredients on hand. Didn't change a thing. It was delicious and my company agreed. It is now a keeper in my recipe box.

First let me say that I misread the recipe and added two cans of chicken broth instead of two cups.  But even with that mistake, this dish was wonderful.  All of the broth was absorbed by the rice and the texture of the dish was excellent.  My kids, who will not even take a bite of a Spanish rice out of a box...gobbled this up.  I will definitely make again and with 2 cans of chicken broth.

it was ok. used med grain rice which was a mistake.  i also am better at cooking rice using a rice cooker, so i would consider this for next recipe.  too bland, so added taco seasoning which gave it a kick.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, including a good saute of the rice. The salsa was not overpowering, but the rice came out a little gummy. But, no one through theirs away!

I make this about once every 1-2 wks and it's a family favorite.  Lately I've been making it along with the Chipotle grilled chicken and it is a perfect fit.  My only tweek is I use some chopped fresh green onions and Chipotle salsa along with some organic free-range chicken broth, and this Mexican rice is fantastic.

It was alright. I probably won't make it again though. Even using Pace medium chunky salsa, it lacked any "umph" or zing. Maybe some added spices would help.

Well-receieved side dish with our chicken tacos! I was looking for something extra to go with our Mexican-themed lunch, and this (along with Black Beans a La Olla) were perfect! I needed something delicious, Mexican-spiced, and kid-friendly...and easy for me to prepare. This fit the bill - I used a jarred Pace salsa and opted for butter instead of oil, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the resulting flavors of a humble side of Mexi-rice. :)

This dish earned its title of "Best" in my book.  Beats anything I've eaten in a Mexican restaurant.  I used roasted garlic salsa, a few tablespoons of hot Jalapeno green salsa and chicken broth instead of water.  The key is sauteing  the rice to prevent grains from sticking together.

I have a similar recipe I got from a Mexican Cook Book. My recipe does not have the broth it has 1 1/4 cups of water and 1 cup of rice and also adds 2 cloves of garlic chopped along with the other ingredients. Hispanics that I have given this recipe to says it's the best. Next time I will try the broth and up the amount of rice. This recipe deserves a five star rating.

Have never rated before but this is worth it.  Have been trying to perfect for years.  Love Mexican food and I have had it all down except for the rice, Thank You Thank You Thank You.  I will have to modify because my son-in-law is allergic to chicken, I will use vegetable broth which I have substituted before, but I made it the 1st time as per the recipie. Pretty sure I could make a meal of this.

I use a similar recipe.  The key ingredient is using a salsa that you already know you like.  I also add a half teaspoon of cumin and a half teaspoon of salt if I have used the liquid from cooking chicken instead of packaged broth.  Using chicken broth is best but it turns out very well even if you use only plain water.  I heat the liquid, salsa and seasonings while I'm browning the rice, then add the rice to the simmering liquid, cover, reduce heat and cook for 20 minutes.

This is fantastic! I have made more than once. I do however add 2 cups of salsa instead of 1(we love salsa!!!). And by mistake one day I accidently put a stick of butter in my pan instead of the oil to brown my rice. Was worried about the taste, but not wanting to waste I went ahead and finished the recipe. It turned out just fine. Of course being from the south(Alabama-ROLL TIDE) we love our butter so for our taste buds was ok.

Made this last night and it turned out great, very moist and flavorful.  Since it's just the 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half.  And I used onion powder for the onion flavor then added about a half cup of diced celery for crunch.  I think I'll top what's left over w/shredded cheese and pop it in the oven, like one reviewer suggested.  This is definitely better-tasting than most of what's served w/Mexican meals at restaurants.  Another great use for picante sauce (I use Pace's)!

I love this recipe.  My little gobbled it up.  To make it healthier, I added in some extra veggies (mushrooms) and used brown rice, instead of white.  The brown rice needs more water to cook, but I'm not sure how much more, as when I did it, I just added water as it called for.

My family loved this. I used Pace chunky medium salsa and followed the directions just as written, except I added some garlic. My husband really loved it, because it isn't a real thick, dense, sticky rice. The kernels stay seperate. Making it again tonight!

I have made this many times now. Sometimes with quick brown and others with white. It always turns out perfect. I think people that didn't care for it used a salsa that was not good to start with...the rice can only be as good as the salsa. I use Jack's Cantina Style. There is no added sugar and only natural ingredients and the taste is amazing on it's own.

My family all loved this rice. I've tried other recipes before, but never could find one that everyone liked. I will definitely make this again. I used organic brown rice and vegetable broth, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This will make a nice addition to our taco bar in the future!

Wow! This recipe was easy and great tasting.  I used hot salsa for extra flavor.  I would cook the rice a little longer as mine was still crunchy at 20 minutes. I served this with the pressure cooker carnitas!! My picky family loved both recipes!!

I made the recipe just how stated. I thought the final product was very bland so I added some additional seasonings and made it work for our taste. I wouldn't use this recipe again.

This is the best recipe I can find for Spanish Rice.  I usually use a can of tomatoes instead of salsa, and I have to add garlic salt and cumin.  Tastes just like the restaurants!

Very good - got a nice kick - can use the rice maker (keep in rice maker at least 10 minutes after the cycle is complete to finish off cooking)- after the sautee'ing - must sautee the rice.

This was pretty good- really choose a salsa you like when making this recipe because as you can imagine it tastes pretty much just like the salsa. Other wise it was super easy to make, probably not the best recipe I've ever used and it's probably not going to have anyone begging you for the recipe but it was definitely very quick and easy and I'd use it again for the family.

Pleasantly surprised!  Was afraid it would be to bland due to the lack of ingredients.  However, that was not the case.  It had wonderful flavor for such a simple recipe.  After browning the rice I threw everything in a rice cooker minus a bit of the liquid and added a pinch of chili powder.  In no time we had perfect rice.  Unlike many other rices, this one tasted just as good reheated as it did fresh.

Seriously easy, and I followed the recipe exactly. I liked the idea the one reviewer gave about putting it in a casserole, topping with cheese, and baking till the cheese melts. Yum! Since I shall be making this rice all the time with enchiladas, tacos, and such, I think I'll try that idea! Thanks for sharing, and we loved it!

This recipe is very easy to make and is a family favorite.  I did need to increase my liquid the first time I made it, but it turned out great.  What's nice about his recipe is that you can really personalize it to your taste by using your favorite salsa.  I've used bouillon instead of broth, added cilantro and garlic and it always tastes great.

Update (1/20/13) This rice is so good! I tried it with a different brand of salsa and it was just as delicious! Better than Tex-Mex restaurants' rice IMO.

We love chicken enchiladas and I've tried many a spanish rice recipe as a side dish with unsatisfactory results. This recipe, however, was just absolutely delicious, easy, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone trying to find a great Mexican side dish.  I did have to cook it longer to get the fluid to absorb and sauteing the rice is a must!  Gotta try it!  I used brown rice instead of white for a healthier dish - just great!

For such a simple recipe, I was astounded at how very, VERY good this is!  I made this according to the stated ingredients and simply added some sauteed chicken strips to it to make it a one-dish meal. Served it with some melted shredded cheddar, a couple dollops of sour cream and some chopped tomatoes. This recipe is most definitely a keeper!  Many thanks for a great idea!

This recipe is fantastic! The rice is flavorful and very fluffy. It makes more than enough for 4 people. just add ground beef or shredded chicken for a great casserole.

I admit, I was skeptical.  I expected it to taste like rice I dumped salsa on.... much to my surprise, it was not like that at all.  Soooo yummy.  I'll never buy another boxed Spanish Rice again!!

Dull as written. I added some extra water and 2 tbs of both chili powder and cumin. Then it is better.

I have tried many other Spanish rice recipes and this is definitely the best! I sauteed the chopped onion in oil then added the rice, broth and salsa to blend.  I put the whole mixture in my rice cooker, turned in on and let it finish cooking.  It was perfect!  My family loved it and I will be making this again and again.

I had to add about an extra 3/4 cup of liquid to the recipe (I brought the rice/chicken broth/salsa mixture to a boil before I simmered it, which may have had something to do with it).  I also added some onion powder and garlic salt to the rice. It was yummy!

Used brown instant rice and a Safeway medium salsa with beans and corn in it. Fiancé (he who loves all bland) LOVED it! Even ended up with yummy pegao on the bottom of the skillet!

I followed the directions to the T. I had to make my own chicken broth. 1 chicken bouillon cube to 1 cup water. I used Pace HOT salsa bc that's all I had on hand. It was HOTTTTT. But still amazingly delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I think it would have been better to use just 1 cup of rice, as it took more broth and more time to get done.  Also, I agree that a little chili powder might add to the flavor.

This was the perfect addition to taco night!  Very easy to make, and easy enough to adjust the spice level, we like it pretty mild with a 5 and 3 yr old.  Great addition, thank you!

Wow!  So simple and so good!!  You can experiment with different salsas and add corn.  I used corn oil (out of veg oil) which was very good!  Thanks for this fantastic recipe, it's just like Mexican restaurant rice!!

excellent recipe - the only way this is improved is with the addition of a 15 oz. can of gandules (pidgeon peas): drain them and mix in after the rice is done cooking; adds fiber and texture - Yum!

I made this with bacon fat and added two pieces of crushed up bacon.   Used Chi Chi's thick and chunky salsa.  Tasted it before done and I am in love.   My only issue is that I don't have a proper cover for my cast iron pan.  Using one from another pan that doesn't cover up totally.  A five for  ease and taste nummy so far.

Made this to go with tacos. I'm very picky about rice and this was as good as any restaurant's. I will say to be careful about the choice in salsa as it makes all the difference in flavor. LOVE!

This is the easiest and tastiest Spanish Rice recipe, it's perfect!  If I don't have onion I just use dried minced onion.  Thanks for sharing!

I just made this almost exactly as written and  it is amazing! It is almost as good as the rice a Hispanic family I know makes from scratch and not nearly as complex.

My rice did get a little dried out and browned on the bottom but I used a non-stick pan and I stirred it as soon as the 20 minutes were up and it's just fine...it might have cooked a little quick because I might have had the heat up too high so that is my fault and not the recipes.

I didn't use onion, because I didn't have any, so I used a bell pepper instead.  I didn't use a chunky salsa I just used Wal-Mart salsa and added a little cumin, chili powder and onion powder to it because I can't make Spanish Rice without adding in some cumin.

OK not Great, And surely not the Best. 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 cup green pepper, use 3 tsp Tones Chicken Base in 2 cups water and 16 oz Hot Salsa, then it will be really good!

So easy and so delicious!! Used 1 cup of rice , added a pinch of saffron when browning. You really have to let the rice brown. Kept the 2 cups of broth and used a homemade corn salsa.

Had a hankering for Spanish rice, and decided to give this a go. It is the best I have ever had in recent memory! It was no harder than preparing it from a package (= ridiculously easy), and had LOTS more flavor than I ever remember the boxed stuff having. It will end up highlighting the flavors of whatever salsa you use, so make sure you like the salsa you plan to cook this with. I used jasmine rice, and onion powder rather than cutting up an onion. I used a tomato based salsa with peach and mango, which made it slightly sweet and that may sound odd, but it worked well with the jasmine rice, and provided contrast to the creamy refried beans and spicy chicken tacos I ate it with. I usually skip the Spanish rice with Mexican-style meals, but this was so good I am considering making it regularly with Mexican food. Thank you for the recipe!

I added some fresh cilantro, garlic and cumin. It is quick and easy. I've also added chorizo and melted cheese over the top to make it a meal rather than a side dish. My family loves it.

So simple.. yet tastes better than the rice at our local mexican hang outs...  I use Salsa from Frontier Grill (Rick Bayles) and skip the onion all together.  Tremendous.  I have made it twice in a week, and it has immediately become a standard.

I didn't have salsa so I cut the chicken broth by 2 oz and used a 10 oz can of Rotel.  Plus, I used homemade chicken stock so I added a scant teaspoon of salt.  Delicious.  It went straight into the recipe box.  If I would've had it, I would've added a pinch of saffron for color.

This is definately a good one.  I like to saute garlic instead of onion, about 3-4 oz of tomato paste instead of salsa. approx 1/2 tsp of Knorr chicken boullion (powder - a litltle goes a long way), and 1/2 a handful of cilantro if your a cilantro fan.

I must admit, I was a little skeptical that the rice would be acidic with cooking in the salsa, but not one bit!  This reminds me of the rice of a local authentic Mexican restaurant.  Very good!  My husband couldn't get enough and he is not a rice person.

Amazing! The only thing I did to it was I substituted chicken broth for my home made vegetable broth. I am a vegan and can't have the chicken, but it still turned out great! The family loved it too!

Excellent rice recipe!!! Followed it to a tee, turned out great!
I didn't remove the lid until I could see all the liquid had been absorbed, then I stirred thru it.
I will definetly keep this has my spanish rice recipe.

Quick & easy.
I must disagree with the reviewer who suggest covering this tightly, though!
Why is "Spanish rice" called "Spanish"?
It's basically a quick, cheap version of paella.
Ever seen a paella chef cover his paella pan with aluminum foil?
Open cooking works great, and it also gives it that tasty bottom "crust"!
Enjoy!

Made this tonight - yum!  I started it on the stove and finished in a fuzzy logic rice cooker. I sautéed the onion and browned the rice on the stove and then mixed the rice with the salsa and broth in the cooker. It was done beautifully in just a little while.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

By far the best spanish rice I have ever made! I made this a couple nights ago with slow cooker carnitas also from this site. Also made the mexican corn with it. Best meal I have made in a long time! I barely changed anything. Was good as is. I used corn and black bean salsa, since that was all I had on hand. The only change I would make next time would be to add an extra 1/2 cup of broth. Was just a tad bit too dry.
Overall... really easy, and flavorful. I will be making this again this weekend when we have company over

I HATE when people review recipes and change just about everything. The only thing I added was a small sprinkling of chili powder, adobo, tomato bouillon, and onion powder. But like just a small bit. And it was seriously soooooo much better than I expected it to turn out!

This recipe was great! I added black beans, (to make it more filling) cayanne pepper, and garlic. Then I served it with sour cream. This was amazing and I will definately be cooking this again.

Fantastic!  Sometimes it's the simple ingredients that make the biggest difference.  I think this is the best Spanish rice recipe I've ever made at home and tastes very much like what you get in a lot of Mexican restaurants.  The only thing I did differently was to add garlic powder.

Love this recipe!  Every time I make this rice everyone raves about the taste, says it's the best Spanish rice they have ever eaten.  I don't change a thing, do it exactly as the recipe reads and you'll never have a failure.

I wanted to use this as a main dish so I browned ground beef with the onion, drained it, set aside.  Then prepared as directed, adding the ground beef and onion before the simmering part. Turned out excellent!

Prepared as written.  Delicious taste!  Better than Spanish Rice served in restaurants and oh, so easy.  However, I had to add additional liquid to combat chewy rice.  Will definitely make again.

I just made this rice to go with enchiladas.  I thought it turned out fantastic!  Not quite five stars but the best Ive ever made at home.  I made it EXACTLY as written.  Its extremely important to cook the rice in the oi to keep it from being stickyl and it is extremely important to leave the lid on the rice for the entire cooking period.  If you mess up either of those your rice will have problems.

This rice was exactly what I was looking for. It is so delicious and my family loved it! It's very easy to prepare - but be warned. It says 5 servings. I made half of what the recipe called for, and had more than enough! I highly recommend this recipe and will be sharing it with my family and friends. Enjoy!

I made this the other day to go with soy chicken tacos.  I substituted with veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  Next time I will probably add more onions and some garlic powder to taste.  I also had to add 1/3 cup of water because the rice didn't co completely with recipe measurements.

I started to make this and realized it called for uncooked rice. I had already made some homemade salsa and had everything out for it. I decided to to just make it and cut back the liquid. For the broth I used a non-sodium type, and I just added my own salt to taste. As I suspected, it was way too soft. However, I am rating this on the flavor. With my homemade salsa I thought it had a nice lightly flavored taste.

This rice is amazing! 
So easy to make and really tasty. Even my husband said it was much better than any of the boxed stuff.
Actually, it's probably just as much work (or less) than boxed rice but this is much tastier, less salt and obviously cheaper!

This will be one of our go to staples from now on.

Love it!!

Pretty good! I used about 1/3 of an onion and chunky Rotel since I didn't have any salsa on hand. I also used brown rice and it came out really good. The kiddos really like it too! I think I'll add more salsa/Rotel next time-we like the tomatoes!

I have a go-to Spanish rice recipe but I wanted to try this one... it was good and I appreciate how easy it was to throw together, but I think I prefer the other one.  Thanks for sharing and I'm glad I tried it.

Absolutely amazing and so simple! All I did different is add garlic to the rice while I was browning it and left out the onion since my fiancee doesn't like them (but I'm sure it would be great with onions!). I used brown rice and simmered it for 45 min instead. It turned out wonderfully dry and flavorful just like restaurant spanish rice. I highly recommend!

Perfect title because this IS the best spanish rice I've ever had, yet so simple to make and such basic ingredients!  I had already made all the other ingredients for my burrito (beans, guacamole, etc), except for the rice. I was going to use my Rice-a-Roni, but found my last box to be infested with bugs. So that's when I searched here to make it from scratch and very glad I chose this one. I'll never go back to boxed Spanish Rice again! 
For the broth, I made it with a seasoning pack from the Ramen noodles (I always have a lot leftover since I don't use the whole pack when making Ramen noodles). I also made my own salsa (tomatoes, peppers, onions, cilantro, salt/pepper, lemon juice, olive oil). I'd say that the homemade salsa is a key ingredient.  I made this rice the 2nd time with the canned salsa, and wasn't crazy about.

Easy and good. I did increase broth 1/2 cup per others' suggestion. Also used few Del Monte canned Mexican stewed tomatoes in addition to salsa and added bit of cumin.

Fantastic recipe! Very easy with delicious results. Per other reviews, I added extra onions for about 1/4 cup total, about 1/4 cup extra broth, and I used tin foil to seal in the steam (since my lid doesn't fit very snugly). Result was wonderful! Just for fun, I also threw some cheese on top when it was done and popped it in the oven at 350 until it was melted.

The first time I made this my first thought was SALSA?I had Pace,and I usually don't like to cook with something sweet tasting,which I think alot of jar salsa and spaghetti sauce is.But it didn't end up tasting like salsa was in it,or sweet.I was really surprised how much I liked it.I do have another recipe I like too,more work.But I will make this probably more than the other.

It really is the best spanish rice. I just added red pepper because I had some laying around. Also, I was out of salsa so I chopped up a couple of tomatoes instead and it was still great. I topped it with a mexican blend of shredded cheese.

SO easy and SO tasty!!!  I made this for the first time for the guy I'm currently seeing, and he RAVED about it--and had thirds!  If the way to a man's heart truly is through his stomach, I suspect I'll be seeing more of him.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Super easy, taste great and authentic.  Was even better on the second day.  Make sure to not lift the lid while cooking and to have a good seal with the lid and pan or rice will not cook all the way.

Excellent recipe and so simple and tasty. I used brown instant rice and chili sauce instead of salsa because that was what I had. I also added a cup of mixed veggies which added some nice colour and flavour. Will make this one again soon!

Loved this. It was just as easy as a boxed mix but tastes so much better. I used a can of RoTel and increased the broth by 1/2 cup and reduced rice to one cup. Perfect. No need to buy another box ever again!

This is very delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of Chicken broth, and it came out wonderful. It cooked up very fast. I can't stand salsa, but this was *wonderful*. I will be making it again!

My search for the perfect Spanish rice recipe is over!  Because I like the restaurant style texture, after cooking for 20 minutes I removed the lid and put the heat on low so the rice would separate.

This recipe is probably okay if you used the chicken broth and a tomato with diced chilis in there but the salsa made it taste like there was ketchup in the mixture. Not authentic at all, I would use something like rotel tomatos and add a little chile powder possibly.

This was a good recipe, but I think next time maybe I'll use half beef broth and half chicken.  Using chicken broth made it too chickeney for my mexican dinner.  The texture was great though!  I'll make this again with my adjustments!

Not being a big rice or Spanish food fan, this recipe hits the spot. It's quick, easy, tasty & compliments my son's TexMex concoctions perfectly. Followed the recipe as written. The dish turned out perfect. Fluffy rice, not too spicy. If it works, don't fix it.

Excellent after I changed the cooking method. I made it the first time according to dirctions and the rice was still crunchy after 45 min.  Since then I have made it this way: 1 cup salsa (thinner=better), 2 cups chicken broth, 1 1/2 cup white rice brought to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 20 min. Comes out perfect every time!

I am very disappointed with this so called recipe!!! I followed instructions and it just wouldn't cook what a waste of time! So annoying if you want to cook it for 2 hours in your Le Cruset pan until the bottom turns black and it still isn't done then this recipe is for you enjoy uncook burn spanish rice!!!!  I started dinner 2 hours early and still was not done by the time guest arrived.  I had to fill the side dish with spinach instead!

I have tried for years to make spanish rice and only until last Oct 09 when I found this recipe did I succeed. -    This recipe is EXCELLENT and super easy -  I use Jasmine rice and stop by my favority Mexican restaurant fo the salsa  - I puree it  much better than jar salsa   I also when I have it on hand use homemade chicken broth     You really can use every bit of a chicken and it goes along way   5star recipe - very happy I found it!!!!

Absolutely wonderful! You'll be lucky if this is the first spanish rice recipe you try... you won't have to look for another! A tip from another review was so helpful, make sure you have a tight fitting lid, and cover with foil if you have to.... now I know why my rice was turning out different each time, using different pans.

Excellent dish. I didn't have any uncooked rice so I used precooked instant rice. Still turned out very good -- good flavor, very moist.

This recipe is Great & Simple,  the taste is magnificently true of Spanish Rice. The only changes I made is that I added more spices, a dash of chili powder & garlic powder and several chicken bullions. But when I make it again, I'll be using Long Grain Rice & I will be making this rice again

I didn't have any onion in the house so I used a minced clove of garlic that I browned in the oil (key is to let the garlic heat with the oil, always start with a cold pan).  Then I used a wild rice combination (Royal Blend, Rice Blend) that has Texmati white, brown, wild, and red.  It was very colorful and not bland at all!  Also used a mexican brand of medium salsa that was NOT chunky.

This is a great easy way to do Spanish Rice if you don't have your fave mix in the house or don't want to take the time to make anything more complicated. Watch the spiciness of the salsa though.  I pureed my salsa to a smoother consistency so that there were a few less chunks.

Very easy and it's nice to know you can control what goes into it, controlling the amount of sodium compared to the packets you buy in the store.

I use Minute Rice (brown or white) with this recipe and it is SO QUICK and works great with chicken burritos and tomatillo sauce!  This is my go-to spanish rice recipe.  : )

This is so much better than the boxed stuff. Browning the rice is the key to this recipe. My family loved it for our Spanish nite dinner.  Next time I will add some things, maybe black olives or corn. Yummy!

Made this for dinner for my boyfriend. Wow, what a hit! Great flavor! We didn't have onion, so we used onion powder, which worked well! It was so easy to make. 100 times better than store-bought Spanish rice! Plan to use this recipe in the future!

This is great Spanish rice!  And the recipe is a great base to add in things that you particularly like in this side dish, although it's great how it is, too!  I added green chilies in diced tomatos the last time I made it since I hadn't picked up salsa, and that was a good substitution in a pinch.  Definitely an easy and tasty side dish with Mexican food.

Hello all. I made this with all brown rice, and as one reader said, the normal distinctive taste of the brown rice was completely covered which was great.  I doubled the onions, used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and used only 3/4 cup of salsa because it was a spicy salsa, and I didn't want it to get too hot.  I cooked it for the recommended 20 minutes, and then left it on the turned off warm burner for another 7.  I added a little parmesan cheese on top as well. This was delicious!! The flavouring was unbelievable.  It was pretty spicy, so I will try it next time with normal salsa to see the difference, but I will definitely be making it this way again!!! So easy, and so yummy!

In our opinion...the BEST spanish rice recipe out there!  We've made it a dozen times or more and its always satisfying.  If you like it really spicy...exchange one cup broth for 1 cup salsa to give it more kick.

I thought the rice was really good.  I was looking for something easy to make for company.  My husband and daughter really liked it.  It only needed a little hot sause to give it that special flavor.  Next time I might add some peas.  Overall it was really good.

Delicious!  I will never buy the boxed spanish rice again.  I did have to cook mine for about 5 minutes longer though.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy and tasty. And the best part is these are basic ingredients I always have on hand.  One tip, take the time to brown the rice, it is worth it for the added flavor.

We love this rice and make it all of the time now.  We use a spicier salsa to give it a kick and also saute the rice first.  Makes good left overs too.

This rice is really delicious. I used medium salsa because I wanted it a little bit spicy, and it was really good. My husband liked it too.

Delicious and authentic! I added about 3 TBSP chopped green bell pepper with the onion, sauteed it together in the oil, added the rice (jasmine) and sauteed for about 3-4 minutes before added 2 minced cloves of garlic, sauteed another 1-2 minutes then added the broth and salsa. Excellent texture. This will be made again! Really good with Mexican Chicken I from this site.

Doubled the recipe and took to a friends house to go with chicken taco's.  It turned out pretty good.  I did add 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning, garlic and sharp cheddar cheese.  I will make it again.

This recipe tastes better than spanish rice you'd get at a Mexican restaurant.  Didn't change a thing, don't need to change a thing and from now on, this is the only recipe I'll use for spanish rice!

They're right about browning the rice before cooking... it really makes a delicious flavor.  I have made this recipe several times and always do it a bit differently.  My favorite is to skip the salsa and instead start the whole thing out by throwing a bunch of over-ripe fresh tomatoes and other random veggies into some broth and cooking till they get soft, then putting in the rice.  You end up with nice big veggie pieces in the rice that way and it only takes an extra 5 mins or so.

I have wanted to make Spanish rice forever and till today have not been able to get it right - This is an easy and fail proof recipe - Used salsa from our favorite mexican restaurant(which I pureed) and homemade chicken stock (added an extra TB though) - Finally, I have made spanish rice.

The rice wasn't cooked all the way.  This recipe needs more liquid.  I will add another cup of broth to it, which is how I would normally cook rice -- twice the amount of liquid as rice.  Otherwise, great flavor.

This was fine.  I think it lacks a little flavor.  Maybe add some garlic or green peppers?  Overall, I like it much better than boxed rice!

I think the chicken broth makes all the difference! Keep in mind that the liquid in this recipe may be too much if you live a humid place. I made mine with 1/2 a cup less of broth and it turned it out perfect.

I used brown rice so i needed more liquid and cooking time.  I had never made spanish rice before and i had limited ingredients on hand. I was able to make this and i don't think i'll use another recipe when this one works so perfectly.  THANKS!!!

Tasty. I made 1/4 of the original recipe for "Salsa II" to replace the canned salsa. Served with "Simple Carnitas," "Easy Guacamole," and "Empanadas."

It was good, but I didn't think it was anything hugely special.  Tastes like Spanish rice to me.

This rice recipe is very good and versatile.  The rice takes on the flavor of the salsa you choose.  We used a chipotle salsa that's local here to Texas.  Wow!  So delicious!!!

Was looking for something simple to go with my chicken enchiladas, but didn't think I'd find a recipe that I had all of the ingredients for...wrong!  I had slightly less than 1 1/2 cups rice, but kept the broth the same.  Used corn & black bean salsa, and didn't peek at all for the 20 min.  It was perfect!!  Thanks for a great recipe that I'll use over and over!

This is THE best, most authentic (from my experiences) spanish rice I have ever had! I did deviate a bit, because I always fail to measure and use my eye instead... I was heavy on olive oil, likely, and used scallion instead of onion. I used Pace Chunky medium salsa, and was a tad light on the rice, maybe. DO NOT UNCOVER the rice!!!!! You must let it do its thing. You also MUST saute, though I did it gradually and never to browning. That seems to give it that extra texture that I love so much. GReat recipe!!! Thank you ilovetocook!

I made this exactly to the recipe and found it pretty bland.  Next time I will kick it up some....maybe it needs more salsa or some chopped peppers or something.  It would be a good base for a chicken casserole.  I served it to 8 people along with chicken enchiladas and I got no comments on it, maybe because my enchiladas are so killer good that the rice paled by comparison!

This spanish rice is very mild but delicious none-the-less.  My four year-old loved it.  Next time I might try it with some taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested but it is really good exactly as the recipe states.

Thanks for this super simple recipe!! We make this all the time. We add a little more spice for our personal preference and make sure to get a quality salsa...it makes the biggest difference in the flavor of the rice.

this was pretty good,  I usually make cilantro lime rice with my tacos but I had people over and no time to go to the store.  this was perfect in a pinch.  I didnt have chicken broth so I used a mixture of chicken bullion and water.  I had to add spices,(chili powder, garlic powder, and more onion) to give it flavor because the salsa I had was not very spicy or flavorful but overall I was told that this was very good.  I made this with the shredded beef for tacos recipe from this site.

This rice is as easy as it looks, and is very tasty when the recipe is followed exactly. It is super easy to add cooked chicken or pork to for a meal-in-a-pot type recipe. If you want to do this, cook the amount of meat per person you normally would and then mix it into the uncooked rice and salsa and cook them alll together.

fantastic recipe. I agree it might need a touch more broth to cook fully. A single diced habanero per 1 1/2 cup uncooked rice adds a near-perfect amount of heat

This recipe taste as great as it is easy to make. I cook for large groups at church, which means I'm always on the lookout for time saving recipes that the majority of folks like. This is one I'll use again. I prefer my rice not on the 'sticky' side, so I follow this recipe as is, instead of adding any extra liquid, as some suggest.

I used a short grain brown rice that turned out a little sticky/moist than I would have liked. But this was easy and the flavor was good. I used a fresh fire roasted salsa from Costco and it had great fresh flavor.

Delicious!!! Made this recipe almost as directed - I used brown rice instead of white, (therefore cooking time was increased, but no biggy). So tasty, wil; definietly be making again, and again, and again...thank you for sharing.

Really simple and really delicious!  My rice cooked perfectly and my salsa gave it a nice kick (I have a seasoning mix that you add fresh tomatoes and lime juice to for instant salsa, much better than your average store bought jar, although some are quite good!).  Served this with Salsa Chicken from this site and steamed veggies, yummy!

Good and easy.  I added some peas and less salsa.  However, it was still too spicy for the kids.  I will use the mild salsa next time.

Easy and delicious!  I used minced onion because I was short on time and it worked perfectly.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  The only changes I made were:  used canned tomatoes w/ chili's instead of salsa, used onion salt because I didn't have any onions on hand, added minced garlic and a dash of creole seasoning.  Turned out great!!!! next time will also put tomatoes in the blender with the broth and garlic so the tomatoes arent as chunky.

This is a nice simple recipe and with two active boys that is perfect for me.  I did add a little chili powder to it to give it a little extra spice.  But other than that I followed the recipe and everyone liked it.

This recipe is fantastic!  My family does not care for chunky salsa, so I puree it first.  Additionally, I added 1 tsp. cumin to give it some traditional zing.  Don't skip the sautee and don't open the lid until its time.  This is a perfect side dish for mexican night at my house!

This was a good base recipe.  I made this with grilled fish and spinach salad and it was really easy.  I added a little chopped cilantro and it was really yummy!

Yum!  The only alteration I made was to use brown rice since I stopped using white rice (and white flour) a long time ago for the health benefits.  Simply delicious using everyday ingredients I usually have on hand.  I made this to go alongside of Whit's Chicken Enchiladas (which were yummy too) and it was a wonderful meal.  Thanks!

I don't have a lot of cooking experience, but I love to cook, and this dish was very easy to make! I followed exactly what the recipe asked for, except I added just a tad bit more chicken broth, and followed the instructions. Came out fantastic and delicious!

I did not care for this much--and neither did the family. Although I can see so much potential; we did not like the salsa flavor. It was overpowering. I used a salsa that we eat all the time so in other cases we love the salsa it just didn't work with this dish. I think if you cut back on the salsa it would leave the rice flavorless. I dunno maybe I'll try to mess with it again in the future. But for now, I will keep searching.

My husband loved this rice.  I want it to be a little fluffier.  My husband said to make it fluffier to soak the rice in water for about 45 min prior to cooking.  I would also recomend about 1/4 cup of water or broth extra.  The flavor is wonderful however and I will definately make this again.

I made this rice last night and it was a BIG hit!  My husband absolutely loved it and we will definitely make it again.  I followed the advice in the comments and used 2 1/2 cups of broth instead of 2 cups and it worked out perfectly.  I also added some jalepenos and garlic we had in the fridge.  Super yummy, but I'm sure it'd be just as good without!

My husband and son really liked this. I thought it was so-so. Next time, I'll scale down the recipe, b/c 3 cups is a lot of rice. I also didn't use the right pot, b/c it burned the bottom of it. Yuck. That was my fault.

I made this recipe as directed, but coming up on only 3 minutes left, there was a problem... not enough liquid.  I added another cup of chicken broth, but in the end it really needed a total of 3 1/4-3 1/2 C broth.  Also, the time was WAY underestimated.  It took 40 minutes.  Also, must be careful when "browing" the rice to not burn the onions.  Otherwise, very close to restaurant-style.

Loved it!  Substituted beef broth for chicken broth because I didn't have any and it turned out great.  I accidentally used very spicy salsa but it was still great and so easy!  Can't wait to try it with mild salsa!

I serve this rice with most of my mexican dishes-whenever someone new tries it they want the recipe!  The only changes I make is more onion, and I use beef broth instead of chicken, which gives it more color and flavor.

I've never been a big fan of Spanish Rice but this recipe has changed that.  It was delicious, easy and a great accompaniment to my chicken enchiladas.  I used Pace Chunky Salsa and added some cumin based on other reviews.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was just ok for me. The salsa was a little too much. If I do try again, I'll add a little less salsa and spice it up a bit with some onion and garlic powder.

Just finished making this recipe.  We used a salsa that we made from a "Taste from Home" recipe for "chicken with salsa".  It had pineapple in it.  And then we also added some cilantro, chives, scallions and parsley.  It was absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the "best" spanish rice.  My DH loves spanish rice but I am not too fond of it.  It was great.  I followed the Karen H-most helpful tips and it turned out awesome.

I made this tonight to go with the Fry Bread tacos I made. Pretty easy to make. My bad was not realizing I was using the remains of a hot salsa, which made it difficult to eat most of it. Add in that it never did cook, so it was crunchy. I did exactly like the recipe specified, and it didn't turn out. I plan on making this again, only when I'm not using hot salsa. I'm sure it's great when the cook isn't screwing it up. I'm a little peeved I wasted ingredients that could have fed my family for a couple days.

I used brown rice, so of course the cooking time was increased.  It turned out flavorful and good.  I'm not the best rice cooker, so it wasn't the best texture in the world, but my family enjoyed it.

This was really good! So easy, and went great with our beef enchiladas.  It was a tad on the chewy side, so next time I'll add just a little extra water.  This has a permanent place in my recipe box.

I added Cumin, red and green peppers.  Those were the only variations.  I had to adjust the servings to 8 and had to add A LOT more broth to finish the rice up.  It was an absolute hit and even had a little kick to it.  Enjoyed it but ADD MORE BROTH and leave the lid on, no peeking or hit hinders completion time!!

Absolutely wonderful!!  I used hot salsa for an added zing. Cooking time may be different depending on what type of rice you use. I boiled mine for abot 12 minutes and turned it off and let it sit for about 10 minutes. I used white rice. Oh, I also put some extra fresh garlic in as well. Try it.

I thought this was a really good recipe.  I used butter rather than oil, and jasmine rice because that's what I had. I cut the recipe down by half but added a full cup on salsa.  The only problem I had was the rice got sticky...I probably cooked it too long.  The kids and I liked it but the hubby didn't really care for it.  Thanks!

Ok, first of all I am not hispanic, but I had a first Generation Mexican American ex-sis-in-law that made some great spanish rice!  I personally loved this recipe and compared to hers, well I think I found a rice recipe that I will stick with!  I only had salsa to start with and while I was skeptical of it coming out tasting like Pace chunky Salsa, surprisingly it didn't but I could tell that it helped flavor the rice, as well as, the 2 cups of hot water with a Knorrs Bouillon Cube.  I put the water and the Cube in the Microwave while I was sauting my onions and garlic.  I added more onions than called for and garlic and sprinkled them with cumin.  I then added the rice and sauteed the combo and sprinkled more cumin.  My ex-sis-in-law always sauteed her onions and rice with cumin, as do most hispanic people!  It adds something more authentic to this recipe.  So, if you must know Sauting the rice for like a quick 2 minutes will do you don't really want to brown them like dark brown you want to simply heat them to a a very light golden color and with all that rice you will more than likely not be able to get all of them even if you keep stirring for the two minutes.  Doing this will make the rice a tiny bit more stiff than steamed rice, but it shouldn't be hard.  If it comes out chewy and hard than you sauteed the rice way too long!!!  I stuck with the amounts of water and salsa suggested put it on a very low heat and cooked it for 20 minutes.  The rice didn't stick and while i

Wonderful formula for perfectly cooked rice.  Needs a little hot sauce.  I added a couple of packets of sazon for flavor and color.  I also added a can of chopped chilies.

Why do I keep making Spanish Rice?  It is never as good as the Mexican dishes I make for it to accompany.  And Mexican dishes really don't need sides.

I make this recipe with the Easy Chicken Enchiladas recipe.  It is so super easy and turns out better than what you get in your typical Mexican restaraunt.

EASY EASY EASY! I like easy :)  I omitted the onion because I was in a hurry and figured the salsa would have enough flavor.  It was fine without-so I probably won't waste my time next time either.  This is definately a good easy weeknight side (I served it with the salsa chicken from this site).

Bottom line:  This is simple and tastes delicious.  Sure it's a little bit plain, but it's meant to complement your main dish, not compete with it.  I like the recipe as written, but to fancy it up a little for guests, I add some 'mexi-corn' and about a half-can of black beans (rinsed).

This is the recipe to use if you want an authentic flavorful Spanish rice recipe.  So easy and delicious.  I think the brand of salsa you use can make a difference, although one time I used the generic store brand - because it was the cheapest in a high priced market - and it came out just as good!  Being a pretty traditional mexican home, we are very particular of what recipes actually taste authentic to us - this is definitely one to use - the best on this site!

This rice was OK.  It was a little bland.  It could have been the salsa that I used, but to me, a recipe that calls for salsa as  the primary means of seasoning is likely to get more reviews like this.

I can never get my spanish rice to turn out right. I loved this version and it came out perfect not even sticking to the bottom of the pan. Even my hubby who doesn't really care for rice commented on how good it is and told me to make it more often. Thank you for the great recipe.

This didn't work out too well for me - the rice wasn't absorbing the salsa and broth. I plan on trying this again and hoping for a better turn out.

I made this recipe in quite a large scale (for 40 people) last year and it was a hit!
There were several vegetarians at our party, and they raved about it....


I accidentally used parboiled white rice and it turns out fantastic! (not gummy at all)

And now I top it with mixed frozen vegetables the last 5 minutes of cooking. When it has been taken off the heat, and stirred, let it set for about 10 minutes. 

People call me all the time for my recipe.
.

Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!

I have to admit this is the first and only rice dish I have made from scratch that actually tasted good!  I cooked the rice in the oil for a couple of minutes with dried sliced onion, since I didn't have fresh onions on hand.  I used a fire roasted tomato salsa and the dish was great!  Fluffy, full of flavor and even my little ones ate it up!

Very good, I did have to use 3 cups of chicken broth and had to cook for about 10 minutes more as the rice was still hard. I also used the Pace salsa, medium.

Unfortunantly this recipe did not do it for my family, when cooking a mexican dish I usually just buy the pack of spanish rice that you cook in the microwave for 90 seconds, but I wanted to try a homemade recipe to get a more authentic flavor. It tasted way too much like salsa, it was bland and needed more spices, also needed more onion. I also cooked this rice for the amount of time specified in the recipe and the rice was still a bit hard. I will look for another recipe!

Not the best but OK. It had a strong salsa taste to it, maybe it was the brand of salsa I used... It really needs more onion, 2 Tbsp was not enough. Don't know if I would make it again.

Really is the best!!  I used Medium Pace Picante sauce.  It was a little "warm" when it was freshly cooked.  However, as a leftover, it lost some of its heat.  I made it was Slow Cooker Enchiladas.  Yummy!!!

Better than at the restaurants!!  Sauteing the rice is a must.  GREAT flavor and worth the time.

This was cheap, easy to make, and flavorful.  I doubled the chicken broth and brought it to a boil before simmering.

Very good. 

I've tried other spanish rice recipes before and the rice-a-roni one (yuck), and this one was the best I've tasted.

Will definately make again.

Well, there sure are a lot of great reviews for this spanish rice dish, which is why I choose this recipe for dinner tonight . I found it to be    bland  . I didn't change anything either, it's not horrible by far just lacking in flavor. Maybe I'll try using beef broth  next time and add a can of rotel to see if that would perk it up a bit. Thank you for sharing.

I love Spanish rice and this did not disappoint.  I took the advice of bringing it to a boil before simmering.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Great recipe!!

Great easy recipe. I used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have salsa. My brother and husband are hard to please when it comes to rice, but they ate it all!!
It's definitely a keeper.

Excellent rice, didn't change anything, only added 1/2 cup water because after 20 minutes, the rice still wasn't cooked complete.  Therefore, I'd recommend cooking it about 35 minutes with extra water added.  I also didn't brown the rice and it tasted excellent regardless.

I used homemade salsa for this recipe and thought it was great. I was concerned that the simmering time would be too short but it was perfect. Great easy flavorful recipe. However, I would highly recommend using a good quality, fresh, chunky salsa.

I've made this several times and it's GREAT!  I always use the fresh salsa from the deli, with chuncks of tomato, onion, pepper and lime juice.  My husband asks for it all the time and, trust me, that's saying something!

I must have done something wrong because mine did not turn out very good. The rice was still hard I had to keep adding more broth and it was still hard. I also didn't like the taste all that much but maybe the tast just depends on what kind of salsa you use. I will probably try this recipe out again and try a different salsa.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I have made this several times and it always turns out perfect.  I have also turned it into a main dish by adding ground beef cooked with a little garlic and chili powder, as others have suggested. Yumm.

Three stars for taste, four stars for being easy.  I didn't really like it for a side dish, but it was great in the tacos with the seasoned beef.  I'll keep looking, but wouldn't hesitate to make this one again.

I use butter instead of oil to brown the onion and rice. When we have tacos this is the recipe I use. Try stirring a little bit of browned hamburger into leftover rice for lunch the next day. Yum

i fixed this rice for my family and a friend of the family.  it was a huge hit!  i created an account just so i could rave about this rice.  i didn't stray at all from the original recipe and it was perfect as written!  try it the way it is before you add anything you will just love the outcome.

My fiance whom is Cuban loves rice, but I get tired of eating the same three different rices I make. I thought this would be a change and had high hopes. Was I wrong! My own home made rice is way better! I followed the recipe and felt that two cups of broth was not enough. So I added a half cup of water, and salt to taste. The dish I felt had no flavor, the Picante sauce over powered the rice. I will use this recipe again, but I will add chicken bullion to give it flavor. Gave four stars, because fiance loved it.

So easy and so yummy! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it was a tad on the dry side, but we still loved it and it will become a regular dish for us.

Pretty good, almost comparable to restaurant quality.  I skipped browning the rice.  I used safeway
medium southwest salsa.  But sadly the dish didn't reheat well.

This was very good. I accidentally added some canned diced green chilis (I was making "Fabulous Wet Burritos" at the same time) and it turned out really good...added some extra spice. Great leftovers for breakfast burritos.

I added a clove of garlic and used 2 cups chicken broth.  Used mild chunky salsa, but use 1/2 c. if medium picante style.

Easy to make. Plus there are different ways to mix up the recipe. I added more salsa, and didn't use the chicken broth. I just used water.

Really good!  I skipped the onion, brought the broth and salsa to a boil, added minute rice, covered, removed from heat and let sit 5 minutes.  Turned out great!

This rice was awesome!!!! I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I used beef broth, and I used home made salsa, it was delicious!!! It was such a nice change from the normal rice we usually have!

This was good but not fantastic.  I didn't have any onions on hand so I skipped that part.  Next time I'll use onions & maybe stewed tomatoes too.
