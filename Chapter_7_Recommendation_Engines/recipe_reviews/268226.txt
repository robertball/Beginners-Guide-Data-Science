This recipe is SO good! Honestly probably one of the absolute tastiest dishes Iâ€™ve made from AllRecipes and so simple! My 4 year old loved it and my husband suggested making another batch and freezing the burritos so we could have them for easy to heat breakfasts. I only made a couple of tweaks and it would have still been delicious without, but I added just a little extra potato and cooked up some breakfast sausages in the pan first and then sliced and added them in at the end. I ate mine without the tortilla and it was still amazing!

The flavor was good, but they were pretty dry.  I did include some cooked sausage, as suggested by another reviewer.  We tried topping them with more cheese and some sour cream, and that was helpful.

Really easy and makes a lot. On busy evenings, I like to throw a couple of skillets of this together and let my six kids go at it. Thanks for the recipe!
