I am going to try this dish tonight, but w/3 changes: i'll use tilapia filets AND a grill pan on my stovetop, then i will use garlic and salt separately.  One thing that is missing in the directions as they are written: always pat dry the scallops before you either dip them in oil or begin to sear them.  The water on the fish will interfere w/the cooking!

This was great! But, I had a problem with getting the panko (not breadcrumbs) and the Parmesan Cheese to stick once on the grill. The grill was cleaned and oiled.
Any ideas?
Thanks

I did the recipe as written, however I placed the scallops in a shallow pan sprayed w/cooking spray and cooked them on the grill that way, turning them over once with a spatula. They were delicious even though they were not cooked directly on the grill grate itself. And they were not mushy as another reviewer had stated. Very delicious and very easy !

I thought this was wonderful!!!  I made it exactly as described, no changes, and it was delicious.  Scallops on skewers were a little tricky, but I even got the "grill marks" on the scallops.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Despite the beautiful golden color, the breading was soggy and mushy.  Yuck!  The flavor was good, but I'm not sure I would attempt this one again. If I did, I would try using butter instead of olive oil to see if that would yield a crispier coating.

I made this tonight and it was quite good. I grilled in on a cast-iron griddle on my stove top (not sure what it's called), and I guess that might be heresy to the hard core grillers, but it turned out OK.

We love this recipe.  I make it with shrimp and scallops baked instead of grilled...served with angel hair pasta tossed creamy lemon butter sauce and broccoli or asparagus.  I want to try it on the grill soon!

I made these today to go with some great steaks. At the end, we had plenty of steak left but we were cleaned out of the Scallops... they were awesome. I made half with Panko and half with Italian breadcrumbs. There was no substantial difference between the two. It is a little challenging to turn them on the grill without knocking off the breading. if I have some advice here, it would be to get the grill plenty hot. I was cooking the steaks on the lower grill and most of the scallops on the upper grill. They looked soggy. The scallops all ended up on the bottom grill to get the breading browned nicely. As suggested before, pat the scallops dry between the water and the olive oil steps.

Had promise but all the coating fell off into the pan. So had plain, naked scallops. Disappointing.
