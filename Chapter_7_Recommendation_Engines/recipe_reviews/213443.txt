Made these for our Bible study group.  Everyone liked them and was surprised to learn they were made with Spam.  Made it exactly like recipe.

Hubby loves SPAM, so we tried this out tonight, it was very easy to prepare.  I was too lazy to look for the cheese grater and used the food processor.  Hubby think the taste is good but need more texture.  So, may be I will just chop it into small pieces next time.  Since my hubby and child are ketchup monster, we serve it with ketchup instead.  Definitely would try again.

I've never had Spam before so I'm going to rate this with 3 stars.  I've never had Spam before and I didn't like them,  BUT  my husband had Spam as a kid and he likes them so and as long as he is happy, I'm happy :)  I'm not going to make this again, but he might.  Followed the recipe, minus the cayenne pepper.  Thank you Kerry for posting this, just not my thing.

I'm running late this morning so I cut the spam into cubes, threw it all in my food processor, with cutting blade, and processed for about a minute.  It formed into a ball which I shaped into 23 puffs.  They baked up beautifully, look great, and taste even better.

These were pretty good.  Similar to the sausage/bisquick balls, but lighter in texture.  I used hickory smoked Spam, increased the cheese to about 1.5 cups (because I add extra cheese to everything!), added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika & upped the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, which gave them a nice spiciness.  I'd make them again, and experiment with different flavors of Spam.

I was excited to see this recipe - I was expecting something like sausage balls. These were softer than sausage balls, and the texture was a bit off-putting to me. I made these for a potluck - some liked them, some did not.

Great for our Hawaiian Luau theme.  I added 1/4 cup more baking mix and a dash more cayenne pepper. The baked them 15 minutes.  The dipping sauce was a great finishing touch.

I think these are awesome. Maybe because I grew up during WWII, I don't like prime rib but I love Spam, lol. These are quick, easy to fix, and beloved by grandchildren.
