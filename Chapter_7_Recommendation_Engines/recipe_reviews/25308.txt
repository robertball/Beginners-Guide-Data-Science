The soup ended up tasting good, but i think you can achieve a similar result without such an elaborate recipe.

While I did make minimal adjustments with the texture (thinned) and spices, it was absolutely delicious and soothing with an amazing earthy, buttery flavor.  My whole family (picky eaters and all) enjoyed.

My boyfriend made this soup and it was AMAZING!!
It was a bit too thick for our liking, so we added more water/broth and it was perfect.  We also added extra pepper to spice it up a bit.

This was okay.  We didn't love the consistency, which was a little like applesauce.  It was a little too sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving two years ago as the vegetarian main dish for myself and my mother but everyone ended up having a bowl, or two.  I made it again this past year for Canadian Thanksgiving and wowed my friends. It's definitely a holiday favorite of mine now.

Iâ€™ve loved this soup since I first discovered it. It is an elaborate process, and worth it as far as I am concerned.

I made this on the weekend and was pretty pleased with the result. I think my ratios were a little off (since squash can vary in size so much), but it was very flavourful. The vegetable broth I picked up was a low sodium package, and I think in future I would get a regular one, or possibly even chicken broth to enhance the flavour a bit. I left out the cayenne, and used dried herbs other then the parsley. The only intentional substitute I made was using crab apples instead of granny smith (using some of the bounty in our yard), I cut up four largish ones which seemed to be the right amount for 2 regular apples. I started making the recipe a little later in the day then planned, so my soup only simmered about an hour and a half. It would certainly benefit from a longer period, but I don't think it negatively impacted my result. I expect that freezing the leftovers will bring the flavours together even better.

As stated in some other reviews this recipe does take a while to make, and requires a fair bit of prep, but it is not as difficult as some have made it out to be, and not as intimidating as the first read of the recipe may suggest. Once I had the squash in the oven and the apple mixture cooked up, I chopped all the other ingredients and set them aside in bowls. When the squash were finished I simply had to puree everything and add it all together. Simmering of course takes a while, but the prep was all done before the squash had finished roasting, and it really only need

The soup was delicious and I followed recipe as posted.  That said, beware this is a very time consuming dish, a lot of prep.

Great soup. - I doubled the soup base because it could be very, very thick otherwise.  I also used dried herbs, and it turned out very nicely, despite the lack of fresh herbs.
