Not bad for a quick and easy dressing! I cut this down to 4 servings and omitted the powered buttermilk since I didn't have any. I basically used 1/4 tsp. of everything except the black pepper and used fresh chives instead of dried. I thinned it out the low fat buttermilk and let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours before using.

This was pretty good.  After it sat for an hour I thought it needed a little something so I added 1 tbs of lemon juice.  My onion powder is new so it may be extra potent...next time I'll cut back on the onion or leave it out all together.  Thanks for a great low cal recipe!

This was way too bland for me.  I even added bacon bits and it didn't seem to help.  I'll have to keep on searching I guess.

I made this as is this morning and let it sit in the fridge for most of the morning to combine flavors. After trying it, I did add a little more of the dried chives and onion powder. This was great for me because I'm out of my usual reduced fat sour cream and all I had was nonfat plain yogurt. This was great to wisk up in a pinch for a lowfat veggie lunch dip.

Not bad since I used nonfat plain yogurt and mixed it together in no time. I do think it might need some extra spices to make the flavor stronger (even though I let it sit several hours before eating it). The ranch flavor isn't as strong as the dill and yogurt. Because of the thickness, I prefer it for a veggie dip.

I added 1 tsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of vinegar to this recipe.  I also used 1c of mayo and 1c sour cream instead of the yogurt and I used milk instead of butter milk powder.

I made this recipe exactly as written. This is too thick for salad dressing. It would be ok as a vegetable dip, but just ok. I won't be making it again.
