I have to admit I’m not motivated first thing in the morning, so I made a few modifications.  I microwaved the potatoes first before sautéing.  I also microwaved the eggs.  I crumbled the sausage to speed up the cooking process.  I omitted the ham because I don’t care for ham.  I zapped the cheese covered potatoes in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese.  So, while not drastic changes, they all worked beautifully.  This was a hearty and delicious dish, great with a glass of milk.  This is a tasty way to start your day.

This is a great anytime meal! A nice cold glass of Milk is the perfect accompaniment! Only change I made is omitting the sausage links so I used more ham. We had this for dinner and it was fantastic. Will make again.

This is perfect for Breakfast, Brunch, lunch or dinner.  We loved it. I added a jalapeno to it as I needed to use it and I am glad I did, as it added a little heat which was perfect. I will make this again soon.  Delicious! The milk helped to cool the heat.

This has all of the best things about breakfast. I forgot the red bell pepper so omitted that but otherwise, made the recipe as written. I had mine egg-less since I am not an egg person and my son had his with a fried egg and devoured it. I'm thinking this will be perfect for brinner and will be making it again.

We LOVED this! After preparing everything separately, I put it all together (except for the eggs) to make it easier on myself to serve to the family.  Fairly simple to make, and super yummy, this paired perfectly with a cold glass of milk~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Breakfast for dinner!  That's what we had tonight.  I followed the recipe with just a slight twist:  I used some Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand, and I also added a couple of cut mushrooms to the mix.  Next time I'd definitely add a slice of toast.  I used russets for this recipe, but next time I will absolutely use little red potatoes because I had way too many for our taste using the russets.  I wasn't sure about how to use the bacon, but either cut up or whole as I served it works well.   A cold glass of milk was definitely a plus!  We declared that this will be a keeper!  Thanks, Sandra!  I think my whole family will enjoy this!
