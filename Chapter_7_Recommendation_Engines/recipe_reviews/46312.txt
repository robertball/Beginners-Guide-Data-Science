I did make some additions to this, so I suppose I can't really rate it fairly - but it turned out awesome, so I'll share what I did.  I sauteed the onion first and when it was translucent I removed it from the pan and set aside.  I then sauteed all of the other veggies (doubling the tomato) until they were a little more than crisp tender.  I then added some cooked chicken breast (about a pound) and the cooked onion in with the veggies and cooked a couple of minutes until heated through.  I then added about a cup of shredded queso cheese, stirred and then put a second cup over the top, covered and let the cheese melt.  I served with flour tortillas and Mexican rice.  It was really good.

WHOA!  That is a TON of cheese.  We cooked everything in a huge skillet for about 15 minutes with the lid on.  Then shut off the heat and let rest about 30 minutes.  As we transfered the zucchini to the serving dish, we slowly sprinkled in the cheese in layers and stirred as we went. Out of a 1 pound bag, we used MAYBE 1/3rd of it.  It was cheese enough to hold the various veggies together without being overwhelming and making a huge mess.  (Also cut a ton of calories out of it)  Definately will make again.

At first, I was going to rate this recipe 3 stars. I had to add A LOT of spices before it tasted less bland and I was even tempted to add bacon! Which means something because I'm not one of those "let's add bacon to everthing" cook... Then I checked the amount of cheese and noticed I had used only a third of the recommended amount! I guess with 1.5 lb of cheese it won't be bland anymore. However, we really enjoyed the dish and I'm probably making it again soon. With less cheese and more spices, it's healthier and you can afford it several times a month!

Pablano instead of bell pepper. Olive Oil instead of vegetable. Eighty-Six the sugar and use cheese to suit your taste. IMHO non-fat cheese doesn't melt or blend at all and low fat cheese just doesn't give the same mouth feel.  It's worth the extra fat and calories (to me) to use real MJ cheese or pepper jack. If you're not vegan or opting for a vegetarian meal, throw some leftover pork or chicken or even beef in it, to round it out to a full meal with tortillas.

This was really good!! I normally like a lot of seasonings, but this was perfect as is. The combination of vegetables works well. I skipped the cheese, and served it as a side dish to enchiladas and mexican rice. My husband, who doesn't like zucchini, thought it was really good too!

Very good.  I use fresh corn and butter instead of the vegetable oil.  Also, I omit the sugar and use about 1/2 pound of sliced cheddar cheese.  I use 1  diced jalapeno chile instead of the bell pepper to give it more of a kick.  Make sure you let the cheese completely melt before serving.

This was just okay, definately needs some spices.  I added garlic, a chipolte chile in adobo, and green onions and it still seemed a bit bland.  Left out the sugar, didn't add as much cheese.  May be okay with some tweaking.

This is a good way to get your kids to eat veggies. We spiced it up a little with Pepper Jack Cheese, using half the amount of cheese called for, but it was still plenty. We'll be making this again.

I did without the sugar, and cut the cheese to only 8 oz.  This was so good that 3 of us finished the dish!  Wonderful recipe!

We really liked this dish and I will definitely make it again and recommend it to others.  However, I did make some changes -- some on purpose, some not.  :D  ~I used olive oil ~Used 2 cans diced green chiles as I had not bell pepper ~used 1 can of Mexi-corn, as that is what I had on hand ~forgot to add the sugar ~added a little garlic as well as salt and pepper ~left the cheese out -- on purpose, as we were having this with enchilada casserole and it was already LOADED with cheese.  It was delicious!

These waterbased vegies are a great compliment to some of the heavy textured mexican foods.Very easy to make.The 20  students I cooked for loved it-a good testimony of a good recipe.

I didn't like this very much when made as the recipe states.  I added some spices, salt, garlic powder and season salt, also used jalapenos instead of the green pepper.  I agree that the amount of cheese called for is excessive and only used about a cup and a half worth.

I really liked it but I changed it a bit.  I used about 1/2 c. cheddar because that is what I had on hand.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin and a handful of cilantro.  Also I used a bananna pepper instead of bell.  Next time I will take out the oil and use less sugar and cook in my non stick skillet.

This sounds good but I use a a similar recipe from Rachael Ray that is Calabacitas Caserole with Polenta and Cheese.  It has a lot more seasoning in it,less cheese and sliced polenta is layered on top before the cheese. Really good and everyone loved it.

I could not believe this didn't call for any spices -- and it didn't need any! This was a hit, and very healthy at the Mexican-themed dinner I went to.

WOW!!  Fabulous dish.  I followed the recipe except I drained the corn per other posts.  I used Mexican blend cheese (shredded) and cut down to 16 ounces.  This will be a regular at our house.  Served with the Adobo Sirloin recipe posted here also.

This was fantastic!  I didn't have everything on hand, so I had to substitute and used frozen corn for the canned, drained canned diced tomatoes for the fresh, and about 1/2 pound of shreeded Montery jack, and 1/4 pound shredded Mexican mixture (cheddar/M. jack/queso/asedero).  I also added a dash of Adobo seasoning and some roasted garlic.  Due to my entree taking longer than I thought, I cooked the vegetables as directed, then mixed in the cheese and finished it like a casserole in the oven.
This dish will be put into regular rotation.  It may be fattening with all that cheese, but the taste is well worth it!  Thanks for sharing.  :)

This was VERY good!  My friend from Mexico made this for me before using chayote, but plain zucchini worked for me tonight.  I was able to pick all the veggie ingredients right out of my garden.  I did add several cloves of roasted garlic, which was very yummy.  I also added a little chile powder in the end.  My husband is very picky and he LOVED it.  Thanks!

This was really pretty, with all the colors of the vegtables, but I followed the instructions and just put the cheese on top without mixing it in. When I served it the cheese wasn't very well incorporated with the vegetables and it kind of just slipped off the top when you tried to eat it. I like everything in it so I think I will try making it again with the following modifications. First I think I will use 1/4 of the cheese to make a cheese sauce to poor over the veggies after the inital cooking stage. I will mix this with the veggies before placing the remaining cheese on top as directed. Second, after cooking for a bit to melt the cheese on top, I think I'll add a breadcrumb/spice/salt & pepper mixture to the top and broil it for a few minutes so that it's nice and crispy on top. We'll see how that goes.

So glad to see this recipe. It's straight out of my mother's kitchen. Only difference is she used bacon drippings to brown onions, no chiles, canned corn, and grated cheddar cheese while it was still in the pot (cheese melts and makes a bit of broth). I like to make it like a soupy veggie intentionally.                                              Provecho -

The recipe is a great start for calabacitas. I sauteed the onions & bell pepper for a bit then added the rest of the veggies. Next time I will make it without the bell pepper.

I like this recipe but also changed it some.I used olive oil and canned fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh. It added a nice smokey flavor. I served it over brown rice. I also used a lot less cheese and omitted the sugar. It was a nice hearty meal.

This was pretty good as a side dish.  Like the reviews say, you don't need all that cheese. I ended up turning it into a casserole.  I prepared the veggies as stated, but added taco seasoning instead of other spices.  And rather than just straight cheese, I made a cheese sauce w/ Wonda Flour and threw some breadcrumbs on top.

I have made this dish several times and its one of my favorites! I use shredded cheddar and white cheddar on top after its done cooking. It melts and its delicious! It goes well especially with homemade fresh tortillas! I learned this dish from my mom and this tastes exactly like it. I definitly recommend it. I don't add sugar to mine though and if you are into spicy adding one jalapeno in there with the bell pepper is good. :-) and for those who haven't had this before, its suppose to be slightly runny but eating with tortillas helps alot and add cheese a bit at a time or right on your plate to avoid it being way too cheesy :)

This was so good, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. After I cooked it on the stove I covered it in more cheese and baked it like a casserole so it would be hot with the meal. Defenitely will make again!!

This recipe serves more than 6 and should be called Cheese with Vegetables.  I will make it again, but with a reduced amount of cheese.  Otherwise it was very good.  Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE this, but I do add a twist, I use Velveeta Mexican cheese and add chicken and sometimes yellow squash, depends on how much veggies I get from the garden. I make it a meal instead of a side dish.  My family loves it, best way to get the kids to eat zucchini.

Easy and very good! This recipe was easier than the other calabacitas recipes and it was very good. I reduced the cheese to 1 pound but that was still a lot of cheese. I left out the sugar completely. It didn't need it. I also used canned green chilis instead of the green pepper and fresh corn instead of canned.

I love this stuff! However, I'm a meat-eater, so I used about 1 lb of zucchini with 1 lb of ground beef. I also just eyeball the cheese until it looks good. I like to serve it with corn cakes. YUM!

Excellent...I've been looking for something to serve alongside Mexican food in addition to Spanish rice.  It was a big hit, and a great accompaniment to enchiladas.

This recipe makes a LOT...a single recipe was more than enough for twelve people as a side.  

Next time I think I will also try using grated cheese instead of cubed...it got kind of glumpy, even though I used about a third less than was called for.

I've got to admit, I wasn't too sure about adding the sugar to this side dish with the veggies and cheese.  But I did as the recipe said and LOVED the taste! The taste blended in well.  My husband couldn't get enough of it and he usually prefers no veggies.

This was so easy and tasty.  I made a couple of modifications; I drained the liquid once the veggies were done leaving just a little and stirred in 4 cups of shredded Montery Jack cheese.  The cheese melted easily and I did not put it back on the stove.  I will definitely keep this one and our guest wouldn't leave without the recipe.

This was a watery, gloppy mess.  It was like vegetable soup with globs of cheese in it.  Although it tasted OK, I will not make this again.
