I used orange juice for the pineapple to bump up the orange flavour, next time I would definitely add orange zest and/or orange extract as it was not really orangey tasting. My mixture never thickened on the stove, even after 15 minutes of cooking after it came to a boil, I put it in the freezer after adding the jello powder and it did set after about 90 minutes. I had enough for 2 pies, decorated with whipped cream and orange candy slices.
