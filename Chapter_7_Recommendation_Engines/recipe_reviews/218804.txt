My grandmother (born 1893) learned this from her grandmother (an Irish immigrant in the 1860's), but they added a Tblsp of cider vinegar to the water with the carcass  and cooked it slowly overnight on the back of the wood stove (my crock pot today) to draw the calcium from the bones.  Doing this turns the broth just slightly milky and gives the soup a unique flavor.

This is a great soup made from bones that most cooks discard. Like others for years I've used the carcass for soup.  After our turkey dinner is over, my husband immediately takes most all the meat off the carcass (putting aside any small scraps to be used in the soup) and cuts the carcass in manageable pieces.  Then I put the carcass in my largest crock pot along with a large onion, some cut up carrots and celery, and salt and pepper.  I cook it all night on low and the next morning after discarding the carcass and vegetables, I have the most wonderful stock.  I can then freeze the stock and turkey scraps until a couple weeks later when the family is again yearning for turkey.

I've also been making this type of soup for many years, but cook it longer on lower heat, to pull as much flavor from the bones as possible. I used tomatoes, as per recipe, but prefer turkey soup without them, so will leave them out next time. Also, I prefer a stronger turkey flavor, so I'll cut the water back to 3 quarts.  I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and did not strain the broth. Great recipe for those who have never tried this method. Thanks.  : )

WOW!! This has to be the one of the best soups I've ever made.  Here's what I did: Using 4 quarts of chicken broth, 1 whole head of garlic gently crushed, 3 cut up carrots, 3 stalks of cut up celery and one onion diced.  I simmered the carcass for almost 7 hours and then strained the broth twice and tossed out the solids.  Instead of shredding a whole cabbage I used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw.  I didn't use potatoes but with 10 mins left to simmer I put in a bag of medium egg noodles.  I had at least a full 1 1/2 lbs of turkey meat trimmed from the carcass that was also diced up and put in the pot. Everything else was exactly as written in the recipe. This was an incredible soup that we'll be eating for the better part of this week since it made so much.  Highly recommend using this recipe when needing to use up the holiday turkey. So GOOD!!

Makes a nice hearty soup. I left out tomatoes, cabbage & potatoes but added extra carrots, celery & barley.  I simmered the carcass on very low heat for more than three hours which produced a thick, gelatinous liquid. However this also dried out the white meat so I chopped that for the dogs & used only the dark meat in the soup. Then I chilled the strained liquid overnight & skimmed off a thick, pudding-like layer of fat before proceeding with step 2. Everyone asked for seconds!

Glad to see an after Thanksgiving turkey soup. I've making this for years as did my mother.  You might want to try creating the soup in a slow cooker. Less water is lost and the flavors remains very fresh.  Fantastic!

I have done this for years, my mother taught me, and I've fed this to my kids growing up. They lovingly call this " bone soup". Whenever I make this they come over for some. The grandkids love my "bone soup".

Delish! Great recipe and easy to make the day after Thanksgiving.  I had to adjust the seasoning a bit due to the huge turkey we had but turned it out wonderful and I'm going to make this from now on instead of going shopping on black Friday.

Very good. Made as directed. It does need twice the barley. Next time I think I might try it with mushrooms (sauteed) instead of tomatoes. I like the idea of removing the one processed ingredient and keeping it more in the seasonal vegetable theme.

It was a delicious soup, but the name of the recipe (carcass...) almost put me off! The soup should instead be called "Delish Turkey soup". 
I made a minor change: used half of the potatoes and added instead 1 cup of fresh green beans.

I thought it was  a good soup. I thought an hour to simmer wasnt enough ao I simmered the carcass all day and left it on the stove overnight on low. In the morning I strained out all bones . I also added a teaspoon of cider vinegar. I read somewhere that this helped draw the calcium out of the bones. . The broth flavor wasnt strong but better then oxo or bullion or the regual box broths out there. Its nice using everything plus you can toss in anything else you have kicking around in the fridge. I cooked the soup all day as well in the crockpot.  Still have the other half in the freezer for later.

Very good and filling. We used 2 quarts of water and 2 quarts of chicken stock to boost the deep flavor factor.  Guests raved about this. I also added 1 TBSP. minced garlic.

The only thing I would change would be the name. 'Carcass' has a rather off-putting mental image and we changed the name on our Fall menu to Turkey Soup instead.

This is the second year I've used this recipe.  I didn't have any barley when I made it this year but it was still very flavorful and hearty.  I happened to have some fresh parsley on hand so I added several springs while cooking and then removed.  When I got the barley, I cooked it in the soup liquid/broth and then mixed it into the batch for freezing.  I'll add cooked potatoes before serving..

My first time attempting to make turkey soup. I am a novice at making soup. I made this as written and it was the BEST! Even my son who dislikes vegetables loved it. Had it several nights in a row. Definately a traditional after Thanksgiving meal in our house from now on.

As a person who has been making homemade broth for over 40 years, I have a few suggestions.  Place the carcass in the oven at 350 for at least 30 minutes.  After that, place the turkey carcass, quartered onion, two carrots chopped in one inch pieces, three celery ribs quartered, a tablespoon of peppercorns, a bay leaf or two, rosemary sprigs if you have them as well as sage leaves.  Add water to cover, you may add broth if you feel like it.  Let it simmer for about 4 hours.  Let cool, strain and continue as noted in the recipe.  Your stock will be so flavorful , it will be so much better than anything you can buy at the grocery store.  You aren't making broth with this, you are making turkey stock.

I don't usually like turkey soup but this proved to be a pleaser, even for me! I followed some of the reviewers'  notes and also made a few modifications of my own:  Made the basic stock in the crockpot and added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the pot as a few reviewers noted. After adding the carcass and water, I added a handful of celery  (the smaller inner stems with leaves which I also removed later), and about a half teaspoon of dehydrated shallots (next time I will try minced garlic), and bay leaf.  Cooked the stock on High all afternoon (about 6 hours).  Then strained the stock into a soup pot on the stove and added all but the potatoes and barley ( I substituted cooked  brown rice to make it gluten free).  I also added the chopped celery and used chopped fresh parsley instead of dried, and a can of stewed tomatoes (original recipe) and cut them into smaller pieces with the edge of the spoon.  I had one large leftover turkey breast to add and that made this more like a stew since I didn't add as much water as called for in the recipe.   This is a great basic recipe and lends itself well to modify according to your taste and also to what you may or may not have on hand.

this soup is amazing1  I have made it twice, once with the worcestershire sauce, once without.  It was much better without.  The worcestershire sauce seemed to take over the soup in a negative otherwise it is fantastic!

Excellent soup.  I followed the recipe except for making my own turkey stock.  My recipe only made 2 quarts so I increased it to 4 qt. with more boxed chicken stock.  It was good the first evening but like all soups by day 2 and 3 it was EXCELLENT.  Husband and sister loved it too.  They said it's a keeper.

My mother taught us how to make carcass soup but we also made egg noodles from eggs, salt and pepper and flour and then roll them out flat and drop them in.  We never pre-dried the noodles or anything like that and they puffed up a little and were so yummy when served with just a little bit more salt on top of them.  Can't wait for Christmas.

Yes, the name carcass soup sounds a little gross !  Couldn't we call it 'turkey bone soup" as someone suggested?  Otherwise, I have no constructive suggestion, except to say that it is very good!!

This was okay, but didn't meet my expectations.  I had hoped the seasonings would result in a more flavorful broth.  I did like the combination of vegetables.

This was my first time making turkey carcass soup and it was a hit!!  I pretty much followed the directions as given, except I let the carcass simmer for an additional hour.  Also added a bit more barley and veggies.  I think next time I will add some canned corn or maybe instead of the barley add noodles.  Really is a great way to use all of the turkey.

Very good. I think it is a great way to start the soup and then add any vegetable you may have on hand.

I make this every year after thanksgiving. I skip the worcestershire sauce tho. never used it. I also add a heaping spoon of chicken base. You can add almost any combination of veggies, I use a large bag of frozen mixed vegetables in addition to the celery, carrots and onion. Havent tried tomatoes or cabbage, but I'm sure it would be good also. I also add a 1-lb bag of wide egg noodles 10 minutes before the end of cooking.

Delicious!  but I doubled the spices except for the Worcestershire and Bay leaves and used alphabet noodles, (1 cup) since I had no barley.  Oh, and also added 3 or 4 boullion cubes.

I followed this recipe completely and it had no flavor to it.  It sounds good and mine looked pretty much like the picture shown.  I thought with all the seasoning that it would have more flavor but it didn't.  Maybe I did something wrong since I see it with so many stars but my husband makes terrific soup and we were doing it together and he agreed, no flavor.  So we added more spices and chicken broth.  And it turned out good but not great.

I kind of had fun with this..... It is an exceptional recipe and stands alone very well as written.  Using it as a guide only I tinkered with it adding an apple, a couple of pears more carrots and celery while playing with the spices. I added cayenne pepper to taste a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Oh! I also added 4 pieces of smashed fresh garlic.  As I said I love the receipt  but also suggest using it as a guide and have fun with it.  By the way the final product came out astoundingly delicious.

I tried this soup recipe and it was very good. I literally used every bit of the turkey carcass, giblets and leftover turkey meat(lots of turkey meat). I did not add the barley as I didn't have it on hand but substituted gluten free egg noodles. I added more potatoes, carrots and celery and left out the cabbage. I nearly doubled the spices, added a couple of bullion cubes and a few dashes of tobasco sauce as I like lots of flavor. I also thickened the soup with a little flour and water mixed in a cup and added it to finished soup. Took it into work and everyone loved it!

Love this recipe - turned out great.  I did omit the tomatoes and worcestershire sauce. Once I had the stock made, I put all ingredients in the crock-pot on low for 4 hours - adding rice (instead of barley) during the last hour.

Followed directions exactly except my husband wanted me to add egg noodles in place of barley.  I put in too many noodles, and they used up too much broth.  So, my soup was a very flavorful pot of noodles!  But recommend this recipe and will make it again.  I really liked the selection and amounts of each spice.  Yum.

This is a wonderful way to use the whole bird. I made the soup as directed but instead of barley I added cooked rice that I had leftover too. You probably could use uncooked as well. It's delicious. Makes me want to buy turkey more than once a year.

This is the second year that I have made this soup. I did add some to the recipe to add extra spice to it. Instead of the whole can tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with jalapeños. I also added garlic seasoning, white pepper, cayenne pepper, corn & extra barley. Everyone loves it!

Great way to use up some leftovers. My mother-in-law use to take the carcass but this year I tried it.  It does make a pretty tasty soup. Gave it four stars only because using the carcass is disgusting.

This was very good, I added a little red pepper flakes other than that I only slightly modified the amounts of seasonings to my taste. I tripled it making twenty Quarts and froze the leftovers, and I'm glad I did so I can enjoy it all winter.

This is excellent! I added two packages of Saffron rice, corn, zucchini and Rotel tomatoes with green peppers and it is delicious! I love tons of veggies and added anything I had in the house. The flavor is so good. I ate a couple of bowls. Yum!!

I make this recipe every year after Christmas, with some modifications. I do not include potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage or barley. I use all the celery I have left over from making the stuffing, and 2-3 carrots. I cook the whole recipe in my pressure cooker (or my largest slow cooker). When the soup is done I strain it. My husband eats the boiled veggies - the dog gets whatever he doesn't finish. If the broth is not enough, I add chicken broth. I use the broth to make Greek avgolemono soup, by cooking rice until done, then beating together 2-3 eggs, adding 2-3 lemons and beating until light yellow and slightly thickened. I add hot but not boiling broth a little at a time and beat until the broth has tempered the egg mixture. I then add it back to the soup, stir well, and voila - beautiful soup. Note: you cannot cover the soup immediately after adding the egg mixture as it will curdle (ask me how I know!)

Easy meal.  I needed a recipe that allowed for boiling the carcass without all the veggies, since mine had already been simmering when I went looking for a recipe.  I added extra water, cabbage, and barley.  It accidentally simmered for over two hours, but ended up sort of creamy and quite delicious.

Wow, what a great soup!  My carcass had so much turkey on it, plus I had a lot leftover from dinner.  Followed recipe but added bok choy for cabbage and small pasta for barley.  Came out great!

Yes,  I made changes by leaving  out the potatoes and the canned tomatoes. Other then that I followed the recipe completely.  There was a suggestion to use chicken broth instead of water.  There was going to be enough flavor from cooking the carcass so I used half water and half chicken broth. Great suggestion for that added flavor. Perfect!!  I froze what I could not eat into two serving containers.  This recipe makes a large amount of soup. Will make it again!

It is a good Base recipe but I did find it bland,  I had to add additional spices to give it more flavor and a can of chicken broth.  I actually boiled bones for longer then it calls for and still it did not have a lot of flavor so added the chicken broth more pepper and Garlic Salt.  I did not use potato's but added Rice to make it a turkey and rice soup. I will def use it as a base but just needed more spice for my taste.

This is awesome!  My Mom has been making this soup for years.  I just made it this year and it turned out great!  I put a little extra barley in it.  I also didn't have any poultry seasoning or thyme but it's still really good.  My carcass was big so I had to divide it up between two soup pots and added a lot more water to cover both than what the recipe calls for.  It made about 1 and a half soup pots full of soup.  We have a lot of leftovers!

Tried this recipe without several ingredients that I didn't have on hand (cabbage, barley (we made noodles), tomatoes and basil).  It was still wonderful, and a big hit with kids and grown-ups alike.

AWESOME! Using the spices listed, I added about a tsp of each (except black pepper) to my taste. Omited the salt and added two hefty TBSP of chicken soup base (otherwise there's not enough flavor). I have not had one complaint - and I've served this to about 15 people. I've made it with and without the cabbage. I like the extra crunch whereas others said they liked it better without, but don't mind it in. Great recipe!!! DEFINITE keeper. :-)

This recipe is a great way to use up the leftover turkey and is really tasty. The only changes I made were reducing the Worcestershire to one teaspoon and I used rice instead of barley. I had family over for dinner and it almost all was eaten at one go. Everyone loved it. My refrigerator has lots of space again now that the turkey is out of there.

This recipe is great as a starter in my opinion. I always follow recipes and then tweak as I need to. I felt like I needed to tweak this quite a bit in order to get the flavors I want. Now that I've added a little more spices than the recipe called for it will be superb though. Next time I might enhance with some chicken soup cubes or simmer the carcass overnight as some others suggested. Still gave it five stars as it does get there with a little extra effort added in. The noses in this house are getting excited.

I simmered the carcass for about 5 hours, with half and onion, bay leaves and a teaspoon of black peppercorns to make the broth.  I used diced tomatoes, and I think it made the tomato flavor a bit too strong.  The recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful flavor!  I didn't have cabbage, so left it out, and used a 28-oz can of petite diced tomatoes, which was perfect.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks!

Although I used cherry tomatoes instead of regular ones and left over gravy in place of left over stuffing.  I also didn't have any barley, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf of poultry seasoning -  my soup turned out terrific.  I cooked the entire 9# turkey carcass but only used half the remaining ingredients since I'm the only one in the household.  Will have this for lunch tomorrow and then freeze the remaining in single serving sizes.  I suppose you could also add frozen peas, green beans or whole kernel corn.  I will make this again!

Very close to what I have been doing for many years. I've never thrown carcass/bones out. That would be sacrilegious. The only difference not mentioned: I simmer the bones/carcass on very low for about 3 hours, refrigerate it until the grease comes to the top and skim that off. Then I put the stock  on very low and keep adding my favorite cut up veggies, later add strained tomatoes. This stays on the stove VERY LOW, for about 3-4 hours. YUM YUM. Freezes well for the winter.

I made this after Thanksgiving after I'd already made the turkey broth from the carcass. It was so delicious I wouldn't change a thing.  The family loved it and my daughter-in-law had to take some to her mother and grandmother.

A really  good, classic soup.  I didn't include the tomatoes or cabbage, but added 3 cloves of minced garlic.  It did need a little spicing up for our tastes.  It smelled wonderful cooking all day!

I thought that this soup took a long time to make but it was worth it.  I added a can of cannellini  beans (drained  and washed) to make this soup a little heartier.  It was really delicious.

I had never made this type of soup before, but my mother-in-law mentioned it and assumed I knew about it. I found this recipe and she absolutely loved it. In fact, everyone loved it! I put egg noodles, instead of barley.

Great recipe for After-Thanksgiving soup! I substituted spinach (added last) for cabbage and left out barley (didn't have any).  I usually don't add potatoes or tomatoes to my turkey soup. . . It was delicious! Will use this recipe again!

I will use this recipe again - nicely spiced and a great soup to make after Thanksgiving.  I cooked rice and added that to the soup as I ladled it into bowls.  I like using rice in soup that way - it doesn't get mushy.

This was great -my first shot at making soup and I got to use my leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I doubled the paprika after reading the reviews and I didn't find it bland at all. So good.....

Another year another Turkey soup under my belt and this recipe never disappoints.

Great recipe. I about 1tbs of cinnamon, salt, pepper and garlic powder during the initial boiling of the carcass and it added tremendous flavour to the end result. I also left out the tomatoes, only 4 potatoes, and added an extra tbs of Worcester sauce. Great flavour and great overall recipe!!

I doubled the recipe, browned 4 cloves garlic first and used  4 quarts chicken broth and 3 quarts water. Didn't have cabbage or tomatoes but used frozen spinach and broccoli instead. Loved it! Thickened broth slightly with a three heaping tablespoons of gravy and 1cup water mixed with tablespoon of flour

I always make recipes EXACTLY before rating them, but in this case I didn't have the carcus just the Turkey meat. So the only difference that I made is that I used half water and half chicken stock and added my cut up turkey and followed the rest of the recipe to a T and it was amazing! The family RAVED about it! Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe/instructions for using the carcass. I made a few changes to fit my families tastes:  swapped the potatoes and cabbage with more carrots, celery, and also added about 2 cups of cut fresh green beans.  I also used 3/4 cup of white rice instead of barley as filler/thickener.  I kept the seasoning and spices the same, except for  omitting the salt since I'd brined the turkey (already soaked in salted solution for 24hrs).  If I hadn't brined the bird, I would have used the salt too.  Thanks AllRecipes and submitter BirdNSav!  Another recipe to put in my recipebox and save for future use!

Good starter recipe. I simmer bones on low for much longer and cut off good meat to add later, at the last minute, to preserve flavor. I generally use brown rice (instead of barley) and sometimes add curry and a little hot sauce. Never use potatoes in this recipe.

This was a delicious way to ensure your turkey doesn't go to waste!  Making your own broth is so easy and it really does taste so much better than canned or carton varieties.  This makes A TON of soup and is a great way to stretch your leftover turkey. I had to increase the salt from 1.5 tsp to 2 tsp, but perhaps if I had brined my turkey I wouldn't have needed to increase the salt. Highly recommended!

We had a turkey breast and made half of the soup recipe with it and it turned out excellent. I didn't get a lot of turkey flavor from just one hour of simmering, so I added one Knorr concentrated chicken soup stock, and that did the trick to bring up the flavor. Next time I would simmer the carcass longer. But, the husband loved it. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

We happened to have a smoked turkey this year, so I used the carcass in this recipe. As such, didn't have any issues like the folks who said  this recipe was bland. We also used leeks we had on hand instead of onions. Cooked all afternoon and was quite hearty by dinner time.

Great recipe for a left over turkey soup!  Very easy to make as directed.  I did add twice the barley, as some people suggested and I think it's a good change.  The only other change I might make next time is adding some chicken bouillon to the water.  I found it had enough taste, but my other half is a guy who really likes stronger flavours and mentioned that he'd like more but otherwise really liked it.  It was a hit with the family!

Made this (almost) exactly as described. I added 1/2 cup more barley and left out the tomatoes. I also used a free range turkey. The flavour of the soup is amazing! I had to add chicken broth though to thin it down, probably due to adding more barley. This was a great way to really get all the good meat still left on the bones, and was super easy. Thanks so much!

This is awesome...I tweaked it some, used rice instead of barley, added tomato paste, and put in cantenelli bean instead of potatoes...

I just made this soup and it turned out GREAT. I only used 3 quarts of water, although if you use 4 quarts, it will simply give you more broth. This is a keeper for sure.

I misread the recipe. It called for just a 1/2 cup of barley but I added just over a cup PLUS another cup of Quinoa! I didn't use 4 quarts of water but just under 3 quarts of chicken broth.  I didn't have a big enough pot so I used my big crockpot and everything BARELY fit in it! (I used more) veggies also.  But OMG, it was DELICIOUS! Best soup I've ever made.

I was a little doubtful about how it would turn out but I'm glad that I followed the recipe.  The soup turned out great and is inspiring me to write about the experience of making it.

One of the best soups I've made recently.  As recommended by others, added:  Garlic, string beans, crushed red pepper,.  Boiled and deboned the carcass the day before.  Also used about 1/2 head of cabbage cut fine not shreaded.

I’ve been making soup from turkey carcass  for years just like my Mom did too. Pop it in the slow cooker & simmer all night. But.... to make it even better, TRY ROASTING THE BONES in the oven  first! I toss in the bones, skin, neck, tail, etc & let it brown really good. Onions & carrots can be tossed in to brown too. Once really brown, add water or broth & scrape up all the bits in bottom of pan. Let the bones cook in the broth in the oven for a while. I them take a potato masher &  smash up the bones before straining through a sieve to get all that yummy broth. Discard all the solids & put the broth in the fridge overnight. In the morning you can remove the solidified layer of fat on top  & use the gelatinous broth to continue making your soup or pop in the freezer to use at a later date.

Personalized it a bit but overall love this recipe! We like our food highly seasoned so I’ll just tell you what I did different:
Increased Worcestershire sauce to 3 tbs, used 1/2 veg broth and 1/2 water, doubled paprika, replaced poultry seasoning, dried thyme and dried parsley with 2 tsps herbs de provence, replaced 1/2 of canned tomatoes with fresh, and added the turkey to the broth AFTER the vegetables had cooked so that the turkey would still have flavor. Yum!

I will definitely make it again. Very much a "comfort soup",  I couldn't use the barley because of a gluten-sensitive family member, and i should have substituted rice; so it was less satisfying than it would have been. But still delicious, and it always makes me feel good to have gotten the most out of my turkey!

I made this per all ingredients but I sautéed onion, carrots, celery and added some garlic together.  I added all of the spices to the saute and then added to the soup with tomatoes and cabbage. It was the most delicious soup I have ever made.  It was a lot of troule but well worth it.

Great recipe.  I substituted the potatoes for a cup of beans and it was great.  I probably added the cabbage too early and shredded it too finely because it basically dissolved after being stored in the fridge overnight.

Carcass soup is a Keeper!!
Admittedly I Only cooked a bone in Turkey Breast this year, but after carving the leftover breast meat, I put it in the crockpot. 
For 2 days I cooked it with 1/4c apple cider vinegar, to pull the minerals out!!  On the second day, I did what I do to my fryer chicken carcass when I make chicken broth,  I mash it a bit with my bean masher. 
I strained it after 2 days, and it made 1/2 gallon of broth.
I fried a sweet onion in oil and then added the broth, potatoes,  carrots,  and cabbage,  I didn't feel like celery. I didn't have stewed tomatoes but did have a can of Organic 24oz can of tomato basil soup so, I omitted the extra Basil but added Everything else!!
I used Organic sprouted rice, instead of Barley, since I don't usually keep Barley. I'm into varying my grains so, lll probably try it sometime with Organic Barley.

I didn’t have cabbage on hand but added fresh green beans instead.  I also did it in a slow cooker. It’s a wonderful recipe; the various spices and the barley make it  a delicious and very hearty soup.  This one’s a keeper.

I modified this quite a bit.  I used the Turkey Stock to create a Turkey / Andouille sausage Gumbo.  Left out the potatoes.  Made a roux from bacon grease.  Saueed the Holy Trinity - Bell Pepper, Onion, and Celery and flour.  Pretty much a home run!

I love a thick stew. I left out the cabbage and tomato. I added mushrooms and red bell pepper and rice. I had sooo much broth that I probably doubled all the vegetable amounts and cubed leftover turkey. The spices really made the flavor.

Delicious soup!! I loved the idea of cooking the carcass in the crockpot overnight ! Strained it in the am and put in fridge all day. Came home and skimmed off the fat and then made the soup . I did leave our cabbage and tomatoes and the soup has incredible flavor profile and is almost more like a stoup. Yummy

I used only 2 Q water plus the broth from the turkey, added a grain medley I had on hand instead of barley.  I had to add about 4 bouillion cubes for flavor but it was quite tasty!

I was out of parsley and paprika,  but it was still an amazing soup! I also omitted potato,  cause I wanted a lower carb option.  It will be a yearly tradition I think! Delicious!

Great easy recipe for a first-time soup maker.  After reading the reviews I made the following change:
- I simmered the carcass overnight in a slow cooker with 3.5 quarts of turkey broth (couldn't fit any more in my crock pot) and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.
- I omitted the canned tomatoes
- I added minced garlic
- I cooked the barley separately and added at the last minute to conserve the turkey broth.
Made a ton of soup, we'll be eating this all winter. :)

delicious...I sometimes substitute when I don't have all the ingredients.  I didn't use potatoes but doubled up on barley.  I also used vegetable juice and tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes.  It is delicious and I'll save the recipe to use with my turkey broth.  Thank you.

Did not strain, would have taken to much goodness out! I used 1 cup of barley (cooked separately and then added 45 min. into final simmer) and no potatoes.  Pulled 4 cups of broth into clear glass container with a baster and then skimmed fat layer off and added broth back. Added two cloves of garlic.

I am not a big fan of turkey soup, the only time I make it is during the holidays. I made this day after Thanksgiving and it was awesome. Right after it was done I had 3 huge bowls of it.
It was that tasty. I followed the recipe exactly as is with the exception of leaving out the barley since I used potatoes and the stock instead of water. I simmered the carcass in turkey stock for 4 hours, used mostly dark meat. After I pulled out the carcass and trimmed off all the meat I simmered it for 2 more hours. It was  simply DELICIOUS.

I like this recipe. I only used 4 potato’s, added a Large turnip and did not use any tomato’s. I also added a table spoon of garlic powder, and tripled the amount of barley.

We made some minor substitutions for the seasoning. The turkey carcass was cooked on a Traeger. I would add more barley next time and possibly other vegetables. Served to five adults, nothing but rave reviews. Thank you.

I made this soup with a few modifications of my own due to available ingredients.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added apple cider vinegar to the water when boiling the bones to help extract the calcium from them.  I let the broth simmer all day on the stove and then put the soup together at dinner time.

I added 2 tsp of chicken base. I didn't have worchester sauce so I omitted it. The flavor  was  excellent! My husband had 3 servings. My neighbor said it was the best I'd ever made :)

I made this with a frozen turkey carcass and it turned out well. I loved the combo of barley and veggies. I do not use dried parsley for any reason, so I used fresh. I did not like the flavor of the dried basil on day one, but the second day it was fine. I found this more interesting than a traditional day-after-Thanksgiving turkey soup.

I love this soup!  It's so easy.  I didn't use potatoes though because my family aren't big potato eaters but still good.  Great way to use up the turkey scraps after Thanksgiving.

Great way to go from carcass to soup without making a separate stock! Don’t hesitate to improvise— I added cider vinegar as other suggested and added way more barley.

Did this in my instant pot and it turned out beautifully! I used high pressure for 50 mins at normal heat and then took out the bones. Then added in the vegetables for 25 mins at high pressure, normal heat. Strained and served. Just delicious!

I added salt free garlic seasoning and doubled the barley. I placed several servings in the freezer, this soup is simply delicious!

It was very bland, even after I tried to add flavor with other spices. It was edible, but not enjoyable.

Really a great way to use the turkey bones. I didn't  use cabbage or barley in my soup. But I did put orso and lots of carrots ..came out amazing. I forgot to take a picture of the soup put here is one of the turkey :)

Great soup!  Reminiscent of my mother's annual turkey soup after every Thanksgiving.  I didn't add the barley, because she never did.  I can see that this will be an annual recipe for me also.

This soup recipe was great. I followed all the ingredients and spices except I did add a 12 oz package of mushrooms when sautéing the onions and celery when I started the actual soup recipe. One reviewer did that, I had mushrooms to use, and it turned out to be a great addition! I’ll definitely use this recipe each time I cook a turkey.

Made exactly as recipe minus the potatoes.  This is a keeper!  I always boil the carcass down but turkey pot pie is too much like the meal we have just had, this recipe uses up the left overs in a new tasty way

I actually cooked the barley in the pressure cooker first.  I added half of the cooked barley to all ingredients when simmering the veggies in the broth.  I added the rest of the barley afterwards for texture.  I did not add potatoes to allow for freezing half of the finished soup.   
Just yummy!

Great soup! I used some suggestions of others. I simmered the carcass with garlic, onion, carrots, celery for about 4 hours. I left out the tomatoes, but sauteed mushrooms. It was super good!

My go to guide. I end up substituting a fair bit with whatever left overs or things that need eating I have to toss in that make sense--- some chopped greens, left over rice, etc. A versatile recipe to work with and learn from.

I blanched and roasted the bones beforehand. I thought I had the tomatoes but didn’t. This was divine, and has made it in the top turkey leftover list.

This is a very tasty and easy soup.  I did follow some suggestions regarding the measurements (I added a little extra seasonings)  also added some Old Bay, dash of cayenne, garlic and crushed red peppers.
I did start with 1 quart of chicken broth and three quarts water and added the red peppers, onions, carrots, celery and garlic.  It simmered for almost 4 hours and then I removed the carcass and strained the broth.  
While waiting for the carcass to cool down, I added fresh carrots, celery and onions and then tossed in the other seasonings.  I did add some frozen mixed vegetables as they were in the freezer and used alphabet pasta as I don't like barley.

Liked this a lot.  Used all fresh herbs. Also no potatoes and substituted pasta at the end instead of barley.  Love the cabbage. That was the difference to other soups.

I used one large sweet potato instead of russets and tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, because that is what I had on hand, but the lady of the house absolutely loved it.  I thought it was pretty good the night I made, the first cold night we had after Thanksgiving, and better reheated the next night.

I always make turkey carcass soup; just did.  But I flavor it with fresh dill, a bay leaf, parsley, cut-up and peeled turnip, parsnip, celery and carrots. I leave out the cabbage and potatoes. Instead I stir in some egg noodles towards the end of cooking. And I do use chicken broth but also add Better Than Boullion chicken flavor to spike up the taste of the broth.  I love making soup and this is a family favorite.

Very nice ...Boil your turkey on its own , do not use that water for the soup ....drain it , strip the turkey meat , and then cook that all in a separate pot in chicken broth with the rest of the ingredients....recipe is nearly perfect , I just added a tad more salt and pepper

Loved it!  I didn't add cabbage.  I only added 1/2 a 14oz. can of tomatoes.  I used chicken broth instead of water to boil the carcass.  I am seriously considering cooking another turkey just to make soup!

Excellent recipe!  I love to make soup because it's very flexible.  You can use up whatever you happen to have on hand and it always turns out good.  I threw some chicken stock and three bouillon cubes into the water and used the carcass from a smoked turkey breast.  It gave the broth a wonderful flavor.  I left out the potatoes so I could freeze some.  Smoked sausage would have been a nice addition, I will have to remember that next time.  Paired with some sweet cornbread muffins, this was a nice light meal for the Sunday night of a heavy Thanksgiving weekend.

This is awesome! I've made it several years now. I make it as directed (except use a crockpot overnight to make the broth), taste it, then add more spices/Worchestershire as needed.  The amount of spices needed varies year over year depending on how many spices from the turkey end up in the crockpot.... you never know! oh, I do add a tablespoon of sugar to take away the "cannie" taste of the tomatoes.

I really liked the flavor of this soup, but I needed to triple all the amounts - water/liquid, barley, etc.  I did make it with some Chicken stock (1/2 chicken stock, 1/2 water) and I thought it needed salt.  But, will definitely make it again next year!

I made this as directed- only simmering the carcass for a few hours instead of just 1 hour and added 1 Tb. Apple Cider Vinegar. When adding everything to the stock, after removing the bones, I also then added 4 diced turnips and a few handfuls of chopped fresh kale, and left out the carrot as I didn't have any. I also added extra poultry seasoning, pepper, salt and a few chopped garlic cloves and a few sprinkles of powdered garlic. It was pretty good, but after I ate 2 bowls and the soup in the pot cooled, I added another quart of chicken broth as it looked like a pot full of vegetables, instead of soup. It tastes pretty good and I will make this again adding more stock as necessary to make it soup :). I am thinking chopped hot pepper would be good in this as well.

I added dumplings in place of potatoes, cabbage and onions. Since I was out of basil, I doubled the parsley and added garlic and onion powder in place of poultry seasoning. 
Never before have I been so pleased with the outcome of a soup recipe! *****(five stars)

I don't use garlic i go with a little of garlic powder. I use a box of turkey stock  to add more flavor. I also used about a tsp+ of poultry seasoning . 1/4 isn't enough.  I freeze it in 3 cup freezer containers and decide what starch to add when I;m ready to use it.  It tastes like a bowl of turkey dinner..yum

This soup was delicious!  The only changes I made was simmering the carcass for 7 hours and then adding a rosemary sprig and turnips instead of potatoes to the other ingredients. Also cooked that for a few hours. Nice rich flavor, my kids loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe!

with the exception of the cabbage and the tomatoes I have eaten this  since a very small child my Mother made this .  My children grew up calling it bone soup and  their children do too.  I think the tomatoes and cabbage would be great but  a dietary problem for my family. Make this and you will be very glad you did.

I was given this recipe years ago by a dear friend.  Before this I had never tasted a Turkey soup I liked.  This is now made every year at my house. Every time there is a turkey this is sure to follow.

I added some peas and one heaping tablespoon of Better than Bouillon  Chicken Organic chicken base. I also made some dumplings to drop in the soup. This was very yummy and a good way to use up a turkey carcass that I had frozen.

I made this soup twice and everyone loved it.  The first time I made it after cooking a 6 lb turkey breast and the second time I made it using turkey drumsticks.   I  used an electric pressure cooker to make the broth.  (I preferred the breast over the turkey drumsticks.) I took some to a gal who is sick and she loved it and said it was by far better than all the other casseroles and meals brought over to her.   That was quite a compliment!

Excellent  flavour, the barley is a step up from the usual limp noodles or over cooked rice.  The tomato and cabbage added to the complexity of tastes, and the Worcestershire gave a nice kick.

I had a big pot of roasted-bones turkey stock for the base. I had only one large red potato on hand, used two large very ripe tomatoes,  and put in somewhat more celery and onion.  Everything else as per recipe.  Simmered low and slow for about an hour and a half.

Added a wee splash of Worcestershire and Cholula at the table.  Delish.

This soup was delicious. I slow cooked the bones in water for 6 hours (for a bone broth base), I then removed the bones and added all the ingredients into the slow cooker for another 4 hrs. I followed the ingredients as per recipe except I didn't add barley as I didn't have any. We ate the soup the next day for lunch and it was delicious. This recipe will definitely be going into my roster of soups.

I was worried about it being gassy so I switched to some savoy cabbage, which I had bought and added two-thirds of a cup of pearl barely instead of potatoes and it came out beautiful..  Next time I make this  I'll use turkey backs and pieces.  It was a great way to finish of the carcass

Great base recipe. I also prefer without the tomatoes but I gave it a try (anything once) :)  It's really easy to make gluten free: just swap out the barley for some lentils to keep up the protein and a bit of texture. 

One thing I do differently is that when I boil the carcass, I throw in an onion, carrot and celery to give the base more flavour, then I compost them and put fresh ones in for the soup. I love the complexity it gives the broth :)

Put the carcass in a crockpot on high for 4 hours, then followed the instructions for the rest of the recipe.   Awesome use of the leftovers and pretty tasty. The family loved it.

Five stars for a good basic turkey carcass soup.  I used most of the spices listed, but did add some extras for our tastes.  No cabbage, added a bit of poultry seasoning, rosemary, extra pepper and sun-dried tomatoes, fresh parsley - AFTER the vegetables and turkey were almost ready.  The spices held their flavor.  It was a welcome comfort food for a lazy, gray day.  Thank you!

I didn't use the potatoes, tomato's or barley because I just wanted a traditional turkey soup and it turned out fabulous!  I made egg noodles to add to the soup when serving. Yum! Great broth!

This is really good.  I did feel that it needed more flavor so I added a few bullion cubes to boost the broth flavor.  I didn't have any cabbage.  I added garlic, I always add garlic to soups.  I wouldn't have thought of adding the tomatoes, but they're really good - I'm glad that I tried this recipe.

This recipe is a real winner. I didn't find it until I had already boiled my turkey carcass with carrots, celery and onion. I strained everything, captured the meat and returned it to the stock. For the other ingredients, I skipped the potatoes and cabbage, but added one can of cannellini beans. The beans and barley worked well together -- neither dominated, but together they added a lot of heft. And I never would have thought of adding tomatoes to my turkey soup -- but it works. Still have some soup in the freezer. When it comes out, I plan to try adding some chopped spinach.

It was delicious! I had everything except the cabbage. I did have a bag of brussel sprouts and thought that they are kind of like a small cabbage, so I cut a bunch of  them in half,  thinly sliced them and added to the soup. I made it exactly like the recipe other than that one substitution. I'll definitely make this again!

Generally I like to follow the original recipe and then make changes to suit my taste but after reading the reviews I decided to add right away and then decide. I leftout the barley because of the gluten &  I doubled up on all the spices and added diced rutabaga and any leftover gravy (GF) I had.  Everyone loved it!

Good recipe to use as base and perhaps alter to your own taste. I think the broth lacked in flavor. But my carcass was only a turkey breast and small. I added other items to get it to where I like.  Though I used potatoes, I still added some beans and also some tiny 1/2 inch vermicelli pasta noodles.

Opps !!! This turned into a mountain of grey colored turkey and vegetables.  Only the carrots had any color remaining.  Tasty but not very appetizing for the eyes . . . so I used phyllo dough and packages of cut, frozen spinach together to roll up into a neat, attractive packages for later baking.   I squeezed and drained all the water from the previously  frozen spinach. I have about 30 individual servings covered with aluminum foil and frozen.  In the morning, I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, and serve with bleu cheese crumbles and balsamic glaze.  Still tasty and more appetizing.

I found here a turkey-cabbage soup (with broth from stripping turkey carcass--used bone broth, chicken stock, and water + bouillon to cover whole carcass to simmer clinging meat off) that made my bland broth tastier. I added 1 Tbls. minced garlic. To save carbs, I omitted both the barley and and potatoes. I substituted a small can of tomato sauce for the tomatoes. I added chunks of turkey from parts that became darkened and tough during roasting.

I gave this only four stars because it asked for 4qts of water instead of broth. Along with the other ingredients it made this recipe completely lack luster in flavor.  So after I made this I quickly added powered chicken broth (good quality) and it made all the difference. Along with a tad bit more salt and barley( instead of brown rice-that's all I had) this is now going to become my go recipe for my leftover turkey carcass. Make this with a great homemade crusty bread and you have a very hearty meal.

Great recipe to put all the veggies in the fridge that need to be used up. I used what I had on hand, kale instead of cabbage and I used fresh parsley and basil instead of dried. SO good! I added 3 garlic cloves, a cup of white wine and some noodles since I didn't have potatoes. Very versatile soup!

a great soup to use up the end of the turkey!  I did make a few changes: cut up the carcass because you'll use way more liquid to cover it if you don't; add the wings to use them up; add better than bouillon chicken to the water to add lots of flavor & simmer it for 1.5-2 hours.  I didn't have potatoes, but I cut up & added the leftover green beans & added fresh parsley at the end.  Also, I doubled the flavorings/spices & added a dash of ancho chile powder for depth of flavor (no heat).  I ended up with two nights of soup for my big family & still had poured off & saved a bunch of stock.  very yummy!

This soup was always something my Papa made after Thanksgiving and now that he has passed, I have decided to take on the tradition. He never wrote down a recipe so I decided to look here. This is an awesome recipe although I did make a few changes. I used 2 quarts water, 2 quarts chicken broth to add flavor. I omitted tomatoes and potatoes (only because I plan on freezing most of it) and doubled celery, barley and carrots. I also doubled all spices and added 4 chicken bouillon cubes as well as 1/4 tsp garlic powder. These changes made for a super flavorful and hearty broth! Will definitely be making this recipe for years to come!

I left out the potatoes. I substituted one can of V8 in place of one can of diced tomatoes. I added a cup of dry white wine at the end.

Simply because I didn't have any on hand, I skipped the potatoes, carrots, onion (I did use a heaping tablespoon of dehydrated onion), cabbage (I added 1 1/2 cups of minced table salad), and tomatoes. Still, this turned out to be the best turkey soup I've made yet - as confirmed by my wife, kids and sister-in-law.

Wow! My first try and the outcome amazing. Added the giblets and let the bones simmer until the meat fell off the neck - several hours. Delicious!

I have made many soups from a carcass, this was by far the most tasty.  I even took it to a small neighborhood gathering and everyone raved about it.  I do usually use a boxed stock already to simmer it in (vegetable or chicken) - just because I like lots of flavor.
I did leave out the cabbage - nothing seemed like it was missing.

Great recipe. I always toss the whole carcass in the 
Oven with whatever clings to it and brown it well.itp should
Fall off the bone.remove bones and puree it and proceed to simmer it for a few hours and then proceed.

Very simple and great flavor. This is a perfect soup for a cold evening and what a way to use every last bit of turkey leftovers. You'd think I lived through the depression with my frugality on this one!
I've made this twice already this fall and it has been a hit.

Served it over Tubetti. I didn't have tomatoes, but it's great the same. Put shredded cheese on top and served with garlic bread.

Just made this fabulous soup! I'm a first-timer with using the bones to make soup-this recipe was so easy I'll be doing it again and again. I modified it slightly based on other reviewers by doubling the amount of barley called for and using 2 quarts water and 2 quarts chicken stock.  I omitted the tomatoes because the hubby doesn't like them. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it's definitely a keeper!
