Wow, this receipe is the best non-thick Spaghetti Sauce we have ever tried.  The sauce is great with pizza, dipping sauce, spaghetti, lasagna.  You should bottle this up and sell it.  We followed the recipe exactly and will never change it.  Again, thanks!!  Your crawfish recipe rocks too.

Loved this recipe and have gotten rave reviews from all who consumed.  I made some slight modifications... 1.) I simmered for many hours 2.) I added water gradually, 1/2 cup at a time to achieve consitency I liked. 3.) Put stewed tomatos in the food processor prior to putting in the pan (because I can't eat chunks of tomatos) 4.) added some sliced sausage  Thanks much for this great recipe!

DELICIOUS!  My husband said this was as good as sauce from a fine Italian restaurant.  I used yellow bell pepper instead of green because my husband hates green pepper, and I left out the water on the advice of other reviewers.  It was a perfect consistency and the flavor was awesome.  Look no further, this is GREAT sauce!

This sauce has an amazing flavor!!!  I did not add the water as directed, used 1/2 the sugar and added about 1/2# diced fresh mushrooms.  My boyfriend thinks I'm a gourmet cook and asked me to make a double batch next time.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, Richard & Suzanne. I normally don't like tomato-based sauces for spaghetti (I use olive oil, basil & julienned sun-dried tomatoes) but this recipe has changed my opinion.

Excellent!  Didn't add any water & only used about 1 tsp of sugar. This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good pasta sauce.  It wasnt one of my favorites but I enjoyed making it.  I dont like my sauce as thin as this recipe is, so I only added about 2 cups of water and simmered a lot longer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  I did have to season this very well with italian seasonings and dried basil.  When putting in fresh basil at the beginning it pretty much mellows out the flavor and is better to add close to the end to get the full basil flavor.  I chunked up some yellow squash and added it in as well.  The sauce came out nice and robust from all the vegies and simmering longer.  It didnt seem to coat the spaghetti as well as other pasta sauces do, and it made a big batch!  So we had plenty of leftover sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!  I may make again sometime because I really liked the addition of all the vegies in it.

My family LOVES this sauce. I made a couple of small changes; I used crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce (to make it just a bit chunkier), omitted the green pepper (because I'm the only one in my family of 4 who likes it) and added an extra can of Italian style diced tomatoes instead of the water because I didn't want the sauce to be too thin. It turned out fabulous! This is the 3rd time I'm making it this month!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's perfect for the days I've forgotten to defrost meat for dinner and I always have all of the ingredients on hand!!

Okay, Okay..I didn't read the recipe submitter's notes before making this recipe.  I looked at the ingredients and had everything and followed the recipe as stated except used only 1 teaspoon of sugar.  The end result was a very THIN and runny sauce (not like any sauce I have seen before).  In order to make it more like my family likes it I added one 6oz. can of tomato paste.  The green chili's give it a very subtle heat.  I served this sauce over the Maria's Stuffed Chicken Breasts recipe.  Overall, it was a good tasting sauce.

I added a couple more cloves of garlic, used a red bell pepper (we don't care for green pepper) and to make the sauce a little fuller, I did add in 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms. This was okay--not our favorite but filling. For my husband and I, we thought that the green onions just weren't a good fit and it could have used more seasoning. I think that this would make a good dipping sauce for breadsticks or even a meatball sandwich instead of over pasta.

I really enjoyed this simple recipe. I hadn't defrosted any meat this morning but had left over chicken from tacos last night. I also just used a Catelli spaghetti sauce as that's all I had. Very versitile - a keeper Thanks so much!

This was a really nice tasting sauce.  I folled it exactly, except I didn't have stewed tomatoes.  My family found it a little bit spicy, probably due to chili peppers.  We sniffed our way through dinner!  Next time I will omit the tomatoes with chili peppers.

This was great!  The sauce has a nice fresh taste to it, and I love the fact that it's a great no-meat sauce.  I will make this again for sure.
I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.

This recipe is excellent! My husband is not a huge pasta fan, but he couldn't get enough of this sauce. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and substituted three fresh jalepenos for the onion. It gave a nice aftertaste to the sauce. We will definately make it again!

This is by far the best meatless spaghetti sauce we have tried.  We followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  The only change was my husband topped his with a can of anchovies.

Great recipe, I left out the water because I like mine saucy.. If I wanted to increase the yield, I would add tomato sauce or more diced tomatoes.

This was delicious! But with the stewed tomato and diced tomato, the sauce was chunky, which I quite like. I also added chunks of zucchini.

Excellent! I didn't add any water and added one additional can of tomato sauce.  Next time I will use only 5 oz. of tomato and green chilies...it was a little too spicy for my kids.  They kept eating it though with lots of ice water...ha ha ha.

This sauce was excellent. My boyfriend likes thin sauce so i figured i'd give it a try. I added some italian seasoning to mine, and also some finely chopped pre cooked Italian sausage. Thanks for the recipe Richard and suzanne.

The sauce is very good, but far too thin. I think a two to three hour simmer would work far better than the 20 to 30 minutes in the recipe.
