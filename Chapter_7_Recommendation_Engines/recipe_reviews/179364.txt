The first time I tried this I thought it was just OK and maybe a little too sweet. But my fussy husband who usually doesn't care for desserts finished that one off. I made it again for a dinner I was going to and it was the hit of the dinner. I definitely will make this again.

An all time favorite in my house growing up. Enough to where we always make it even still. Its the easiest pie because you mix everything together and it forms its own crust, custard middle and flaky coconut top.....so yummy!

I don't know where I went wrong, but it didn't come out right.  When I took it out of the oven, it looked great, but as it cooled, the middle sank in...not very pretty. It looked nothing like the picture, not even when I cut into it.  It was flat and tasted kinda eggy.  Won't make it again.  I was nice and gave it two stars because I liked the crispy browned edges.

This pie is super easy to make and tasty.  I didn't like the custard-like consistency of the middle part of the pie, but that is a personal preference.  The crust formed nicely, and the coconut top was crisp and flaky.  This is especially good topped with Cool Whip when serving.  If you like coconut and custard, this recipe would probably be a winner for you.
