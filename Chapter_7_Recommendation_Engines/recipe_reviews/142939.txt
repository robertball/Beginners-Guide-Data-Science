I can only give this recipe 4 stars because of my modifications. I used a deep dish pie pan. added only 6 eggs and a splash more of milk.  Next a handful of Cheddar cheese, onion powder instead of onion and I sauted the spinach in garlic and butter. Finally, I added 3 strips of cooked bacon crumbled.

It was a good recipe, but it had too much egg and herbs for my taste. In the future I will be reducing the eggs to 6, the herbs to 1/2 teaspoon each and adding an additional 1/2 cup of cheese. My boyfriend thought it tasted great the way it was and actually ate over half of it in one night. He said it tasted much better than the pre-made frozen mini-quiches.

Very good. I had enough for two quiche pies, but the garlic was a little much. (And I like garlic). Next time I will use just a dash of garlic powder instead of a clove fresh.

Made the following changes based on reviews.  ½ tsp thyme (was just enough), 6 eggs (a bit dry next time will use all 8), threw the garlic in with the onion to cook for the last min, used 1 ½ C cheese. It was awesome and so easy.  I loved the flavor and can not wait to make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was delicious!  Everyone in the family really liked it--even our 2 year old daughter.  Well, she ate a big bite then wasn't too interested in more until we told her it was green eggs and ham!  It was a big hit and we'll make this again!

It turned out well. I am a novice chef to the extreme. I didn't use Romano cheese but added Feta and Cheddar. My creation was more a three cheese spinach quiche. I think I used a little too much spinach and the garlic was a bit much but overall we enjoyed this quiche very much!!

I never expected all my children to like this but it was so yummy looking I had to try it. Sure enough all five from the six year old to the seventeen asked for seconds. I'll make two next time and will try a bit of sausage. We used 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp dill, minused one egg per other reviews (next time I'll use all 8) and I grated my onions to hide them from the children LOL. Thanks for a great recipe!
Revision; Made this again using all of the eggs & 1/4 c. half & half. In the interest of time I omitted the onion/garlic step and used 1/4 tsp. powdered garlic and no onion. Tried diced broccoli and leftover diced chicken breast w/ cheddar cheese, and used thyme this time. So yummy. This is the perfect recipe to use what you have on hand. Definitely a favorite weekly meal now. Thanks again!

This was fantastic! I threw in some leftover red bell pepper and spring onions in with fresh spinach--all of which I sauteed together before following the rest of the recipe.  I did sneak in a bit more cheese--maybe half a cup more.  Wonderful--everyone in the family loved it!

Good recipe.  I made it as written and will use less thyme the next time I make it.  A teaspoon overpowered the other flavors, in my taste.

This dish is great to customize.  Saying that, definitely use six eggs instead of eight.  My husband loves this quiche.  Sometimes, I like to mix it up and use some seasonal veg.

Loved it! I took other's advice and added less eggs (4 whole eggs and 3 egg whites) and less garlic. Mine was done in 40 minutes, but of course that can differ with altitude.

This is very yummy and easy.  I made it following the recipe exactly (I did use 6 eggs and mozzarella).  The second time I made the same modification but also replaced the garlic, basil, and onion with 2 tablespoons of pesto.  It was yummy and cut the prep time in half.

This is great!  I add some tomatoes and mushrooms and yogurt and cook it without the crust to reduce the fat.   Simply wonderful.

I made this for a side for Christmas dinner.  I'm giving this 5 stars even though I didn't get any.  Everyone who ate it said it was great.  It was gone fast.

This was delicious.  I served it to my sister and niece for brunch and my sister was commenting on it the next day.  My niece doesn't like spinach or onions, so she missed out.  I used a deep dish pie crust instead of the rolled dough.  It worked well.  I used fresh spinach which I mixed with the onions after I sauteed them.  I turned off the heat, and covered with a lid to lightly steam it.

Took this to a morning meeting and it got good feedback.  I used 3/4 tsp thyme and it was plenty.  I HATE it when recipes say salt to taste...I added a heaping tsp and it was a bit much.  Probably a level tsp would be good.  I prepared this the night before and it cooked well the morning of.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't use the thyme or basil because of family dislike and I didn't have any Romano cheese.  I also made my own whole wheat pie crust.
This was very good, we will totally make it again and again.

My girlfriend and I have been making this recipe for a couple years now, but with some slight modifications as a crustless quiche.  Increase to 9 eggs and spray the pie pan with non-stick cooking spray and pour the ingredients directly into the pan.  Without the crust, check the quiche after it has baked for 30-35 min as it should be nearly done.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as it says except I used a mix of Italian herbs instead of thyme and basil. I LOVE this dish and find myself making it over and over again.

Fantastic and very easy.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, with great results.  I can think of all kinds of things to add to this mix - bacon bits, mushrooms, broccoli, ham... but it's also perfect just the way it is.

Loved the recipe.  I sauteed the thawed spinach with turkey bacon & garlic before adding it all together. I had enough for 2 quiches so I pre-sliced them for breakfast on the go.

Amazing- a dish with spinach that the kids like!  Well, one kid, and the other admitted it wasn't poison, so that counts as a big win for us.  Now we make them two at a time, cutting to 7 eggs and sauteing the garlic with the onions.  In the second quiche, we stay with 8 eggs and add about 6-7 oz diced fresh mushrooms.

a pinch of nutmeg. Also, sauté 1 clove minced garlic
with onions.

Great base recipe!  I substituted 2 cups fresh spinach and used Parmesan instead of Pecorino b/c that's what I had.  Added 1/4 cup half and half for richness and slightly more cheese (swiss).  Used 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. thyme (as suggested by others).  Filled two 9" pie shells.  I added chopped ham to one.  Both versions came out great!

Simply delicious!  I came across this recipe while looking for healthy kid friendly meal ideas and was afraid that my fussy 3 year old would not touch it because of the visible spinach.  She loved it though and so did we.  I think anyone that likes garlic would not think it's too much.  I think I even added a 1/2 clove more than called for and to me it came out perfect.  I also added cheddar cheese which gave it more color and flavor.

This was easy to make and very good! I just altered it a tiny bit by adding 4 cloves (instead of 1?) of minced garlic near the end of the spinach/onion cooking time and we used mild cheddar instead of mozzarella because we were all out of mozz. We also used 1.5 cups of fresh chopped spinach. My vegetarian sister, meat eater hubby and veggie-phobic friend all throughly enjoyed this.

2 of my 3 kids loved it. Even asked for it on leftover night. I replaced mozzarella with Monterey Jack and used 7 eggs with a splash of milk because that's what I had. Reduced spices to about 3/4 tsp. Turned out great. 5/5 stars for quiche, 4 stars when compared to everything out there to eat.

Really good, only change was bacon instead of oil and no crust.  Oh and no salt and pepper because I forgot it.  Didn't need the salt at all because of the bacon but will add pepper next time

Chopped up 3 slices of bacon fried, removed from pan. In bacon grease fried onions, removed from pan and added to bacon. Sauteed 5oz bag of fresh spinach.
In blender mixed rest of ingredients then blended in spinach at low speed to lightly chop.
No crust, put onion/bacon mixture in pie plate then poured over egg mix.  Baked 45 minutes which was still a little long.

It was very good! Loved the spices. You definitely have to it warm, when it's cold, doesn't taste as good. The only chage I made, I used 6 eggs and about 1/2 cup of milk. Will make it again!

It's hard for me to really review this because I made a lot of the recommendations that others suggested, and I'm not sure that was the best idea in the long run. I used 7 eggs instead of 8, did 1/2 tsp of thyme and made this crustless in a lasagna pan instead of using a round pie pan.

I'm glad that I only used 1/2 tsp of thyme. Even that may have been too much! I wish that I had used that 8th egg though. It was dry and too thick with the spinach. Overall, it was ok. My 1 year old daughter LOVED it. I've never seen her eat so much food. I didn't really care for it at all. So my husband and daughter get all of the leftovers :).

If you do Weight Watchers, if you make it crustless it is 5 pointsplus a serving. Not bad.

Followed recipe pretty closely,but subbed cheddar for mozza and parmesan for peccorino.  Made it flat-tasting, bland.  Next time will try mustard spread thinly on pastry, and use cheeses reccommended.

I ended up with too much filling!  I ended up adding 4 more eggs so I could split the mixture between two pie crusts, so 6 eggs each which is what most reviewers modify to anyway.

Delicious! My three-year old also loved it. According to suggestions from others, I reduced spices to 1/2t each and did 1 1/2 C cheese (I only had mozzarella) and a little less garlic. The thyme was definitely noticeable and just the right amount. Iill be making this again soon!

DELISH!!  My husband & my parents loved the quiche.  Everyone agreed it tasted like it had a light bacon flavor??---maybe it was the combination of the seasoning?   I never really cared for quiche until I tasted this one---it's definitely a keeper!!!

This quiche was absolutely delicious but I only gave it 4 stars because I did have to modify it a bit and would probably not have been as delicious if prepared as written.  The main change I made is to not add as many eggs.  I added only 4 eggs instead of 8.  Even with 4, my deep dish pie pan was filled so with double the amount of eggs it probably wouldn't have fit.  I also substituted fresh spinach and basil for frozen and dried and omitted the pie crust.  I was going to use a frozen pie crust that I had been thawing in the fridge overnight but when I went to make the quiche it was still frozen so I just chose to make a crustless quiche.  My boyfriend who usually says that the crust and the meat are the best parts of a quiche thought that this was one of the best quiches he has ever had and didn't miss them at all!

This quiche is part of my regular rotation and is requested often by my kids.  I don't know if it's the combination of cheeses and mild spices, but this truly is a (fairly) healthy quiche with kid appeal.  Thanks for the great recipe!!
