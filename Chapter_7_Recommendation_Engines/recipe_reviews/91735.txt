This is a wonderfully easy, tasty fudge.  The previous reviewer stated that she found the amount of Condensed Milk of 6 oz. too much for the chocolate to firm up.  Eagle Brand only comes in 14 oz. cans.  The recipe calls for 1 c. to be used for the main part of the fudge.  The remainder of the milk, which is 4 TBS. (not 6 oz.) is exactly right for chocolate layer to set up.  Not sure where the 6 oz. came from but it is incorrect.

turned out well, but based on the previous review I cut WAY back on the condensed milk in the chocolate portion - I used about one ounce instead of the 6 oz called for in the recipe, & it swirled & set up really nicely.  Yummy - but cut small pieces, cause it's rich!

The chocolate did not set, it remained the gooey consistency of the condensed milk. It did not swirl. The peanut butter fudge bottom part was tasty, though!

This is good and easy. I thought that it didn't seem like enough chocolate but it turned out well. I have a hint to make it easier: measure the condensed milk in a microwave safe measuring cup. then put the remaining milk (it will be 1/4 cup) and the chocolate chips in the measuring cup warm in a microwave to melt the chocolate chips. It doesn't take long because of the high sugar content so watch it carefully.

With some adjustments, mine set AND swirled fine (and looked pretty darn cool in the end). I doubled the amount of chocolate chips (that is, 1/2 cup) and also added 1 tablespoon of butter to the chocolate mixture. It may be my imagination, but when I measured out 8 oz of condensed milk (8oz = 1 cup) to add to the peanut butter chips, there seemed like a LOT LESS than 6 oz of milk leftover (14oz can - 8oz = 6oz). But mathematically there should have been, b/c I made no adjustments to the milk measurements. Good luck!

It came out good for me. I had to heat up the chocolate chips a lot to get them runny enough to swirl, but it worked out. Also added some salt and butter to the chocolate chip mixture. 

The fudge itself came out so creamy and soft - it's the best recipe I've used this year for fudge.

Threw the whole batch away-- it never set.  I don't understand what went wrong.  Try another recipe.

This is a very easy and great recipe IF you only use 4T of that leftover 6 oz of sweetened condensed milk in the chocolate part.... sorry... no matter how you subtract it.. 14 oz - 1 cup (8 oz) = 6 ounces... NOT 4 T... so thats where they got 6 oz at... learned in math class

I make this recipe every holiday.  Since my mom's style of marshmallow fudge on the stove never worked for me I have only made eagle brand microwave fudge.  (which this recipe is great in the microwave !)  If you like extra peanut buttery taste replace the butter with creamy peanut butter.  YUM!

NEVER I repeat NEVER make fudge on a rainy or humid day.  Dry cold weather is best for fudge to set up.  It is one of those rules of thumb that you only learn from throwing away lots of fudge goop.

If you are having trouble with fudge setting up -  check to see if you used a product that says it is 'vegetable oil spread'. Goodies made with vegetable oil spread will NOT set up; The product must have the word MARGARINE which is 80% vegetable oil (by law) or BUTTER on the label/package!

As others mentioned, I could not swirl the chocolate into the peanut butter fudge.  I swirled and I swirled and I swirled, and the chocolate just sat on top.  I also did not care for the flavor of the peanut butter chips.  They just didn't have the peanut buttery taste you get when you use real peanut butter.  On the up side, they were super simple.  I'll try again someday, and use real peanut butter instead of the chips, and follow other reviewers advice on getting the chocolate to swirl.

Tried with 2 different batches, but the chocolate won't swirl like the picture. But it is sooo delicious, so I will keep trying to find a way. Super easy, new fav recipe.

Ultra simple. I doubled the batch and used half Reese's Peanut Butter chips and 1/2 actual peanut butter. It made the fudge a bit softer. If you are having issues with the chocolate spreading because it is too thick, add a little bit of shortening and it will make it thinner without taking away from the flavor.

If you follow the directions exactly, it will NOT turn out. Made 2 batches, on the 2nd one, added more condensed milk to both chips, even heated longer and no luck. It set, and tastes good, but you can't swirl it good. I had a recipe last year and it was 10x better, it was like swirling soup and it turned out gorgeous!!

This is amazing and easy, plus a lot cheaper of course then buying fudge in the store. Now I love chocolate so I did a 1.5 cup of peanut butter chips and 1.5 cup chhocolate, 6 oz each on sweetened condensed milk, with a few dashes of evap milk to smooth it out as I'm melting. Cling wrap in the 8x8 glass pan first yields thick/big pieces, cut em small and share! My office loved them and this is something I will make several more times!

@CANNONFAM_99, you said you don't know where the "6oz" is coming from. 1 cup=8oz, 14-8=6. There are better fudge recipes out there, but none this simple. Will make again and again :)

This fudge was just okay for me.  It really never got firm, and I think that I just prefer fudge made with evaporated milk and sugar cooked on the stove.  But, it was worth a try, and my kids did eat some of it.

Easy to follow recipe, but the problem with the swirling came from the firmness of the peanut butter layer - not problems with the chocolate. My husband said he preferred it in layers, so I didn't care that it didn't turn out. I used milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet, prefer the flavor.

Very nice easy recipe, turned out good. The complaint in some of these reviews with the chocolate portion not setting, is confusion between fl oz and oz. 1 cup of liquid is 8 fl oz, it is not however 8 oz (exception is water). So 1 cup of condensed milk (the can comes in oz not fl oz) is the majority of the 14 oz can leaving approximately 5 TB left for the chocolate portion.  You can not use 8 oz of condensed milk for the PB portion (then 6 oz for the chocolate) when the recipe calls for 1 cup, its not the same thing. 1 fl oz of condensed milk is approximately 1.35 oz.

Recipe worked great, nice and easy with no tweaking needed. Fudge tastes awesome. Only recommendation I would make is if you like thick fudge I would definitely double the recipe.

I used this recipe for the first time I ever made fudge.  It came out very delicious and was a hit.  It was a little sweet for my taste, but everyone seemed to love it.  I gave some out at christmas with a pretty festive tin and it looked great!

Deeeelicious.  I didn't have any peanut butter chips so I substituted white chips and used 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I read the previous reviews and so I cut back on the sweetened condensed milk too.  My family devoured it and it came out beautifully.  Will make again.

Note:  putting this fudge into one of those disposable fudge pans, not such a bright idea.  It sticks to those pans and you end up peeling away the pan just so you can eat the fudge.  Next time I'll be using wax paper.  Great recipe though.  :D

Wow, so I followed the ricipe to the "T" and no this recipe does not work. But instead of througing it away, I experimented. By adding one forth cup of evaporated milk the fudge was perfect and the chocolate could now be swirled around. This was a great tasting improvment from the fake chip taste as well.

This was a very good fudge. The peanut butter and choclate were rich but tasted great. Family and friends loved it!

The recipe is very rich.  I made a ton of it and put it in cute tins for Chirstmas.  In small doses, it is a real crowd pleaser.

Turned out awesome.  Make sure to pour fast before chocolate sets in pan.

Second time was a charm for me.  Made as described was not good; I had the same problem as others described with the chocolate not setting up.  (Rather than "spooning" the chocolate over the peanut butter fudge, I poured it--that's how thin it was. )  To fix this, I increased the chocolate from 1/4 C to 1/2 C and added a little milk for proper consistency.  Voila!  (And for those wondering about the measurement of the condensed milk--i.e., 14 oz. minus 8 oz. equals 6 oz.--the key is to realize you're dealing with weight (the can of milk) vs. volume (the quantity of milk added).  A cup of brown sugar weighs more than a cup of flour.  You can't mix metaphors!

Worst thing I've ever tried from this website. I wasted so much money and food trying to make this!  The peanut butter part comes out fine, but the chocolate burned both times j tried it. Even on the lowest setting, the sweetened condensed milk got hot enough to burn the chocolate!  I have no idea how anyone made this unless they used a double boiler. Maybe if you melt the chocolate and THEN add the sweetened condensed milk it would work, but not the way the recipe is written.  Maybe I'll try making it that way some day, but after spending 2 hours trying to make this and scraping burned chocolate off of my pots and utensils, I'm DONE!!!

I used real peanut butter, cut the salt and the vanilla extract out, and accidentally mixed it all together at once but this was the best fudge i have ever tasted. Great recipe!
