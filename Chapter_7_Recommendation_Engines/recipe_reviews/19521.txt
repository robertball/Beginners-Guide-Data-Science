Very good with a few adjustments - mixed 1/3 cup milk, 1/3rd cup sour cream, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 tsp season salt to soup; Sprinkled parmesan cheese over casserole instead of bread crumbs; Cooked for 20 minutes.  Casserole came out moist and had a great flavor - even the kids loved it (which doesn't happen that often).

This was excellent - good comfort food for a cold night. I took a few pieces of advice from the reviews and it was perfect. I added 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup light sour cream, a sprinking of salt, and a sprinkling of dried onion flakes to the original recipe. I didn't have american cheese so I substituted some sharp cheddar - SO yummy! I also mixed everything together instead of layering which distributed the flavors well. Enjoy!

You can't beat this classic, for a cheap & easy week night meal. I leave out the butter (you won't miss it) & add milk (refill the soup can & pour it in). Also, I put in just the soup, milk, noodles & tuna for the first 2/3rds of the cooking. Then take it out and give it a stir and place the cheese and breadcrumbs (or crushed potato chips) on top for the rest of the cooking. You'll never go back to Tuna Helper!!

My kids loved this. That doesn't happen unless it's fast food or pizza. I added about 1/2 cup sour cream, salt, pepper and a little garlic for taste. The second time I made it I doubled the tuna because we really like tuna. I used more bread crumbs and cooked it for 30 minutes. It makes great leftovers - which in my house is most important because that means it's my lunch for the next day.

Very easy and quick! I did substitute cream of chicken soup for the mushroom soup and it was delicious.  (Not big mushroom fans in this family)
 The hubby and kid loved it!  Great for a cold winter's night.  
I will add this to the recipe rotation!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  My Fiancé wanted a tuna Casserole for his birthday dinner.  I thought to myself "why does he have to be so difficult".  I found this website and followed the recipe using Velveeta cheese,added sour cream and milk as one of the reviews suggested.  This made it very creamy and gave it an extra flavor.  I also used bread crumbs and parmesan cheese for the topping. Great recipe and easy too

This was a nice simple. tasty dish.  Good for busy days.  The only thing I may change next time is to use less noodles.  I like sauce, and the noodles kind of sucked it all up.  But very good!

This was really good.  I added about a half cup of peas to mine.  Next time I'll use 2 cans of soup, I like mine a bit saucier.  For the cheese, I didn't have American so I shredded some Colby/Jack and it was really good.

This was so boring.  I followed other suggestions and I added 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, and used Colby Jack Cheese, doubled the tuna and it was still bland.  I mixed everything together instead of layering.  Definitely needs 2 cans of soup.  I think next time I will use extra sharp cheddar and lots of it.  Also per other reviews I will mix Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs don't toast and make a good crust on their own.

Thanks to my pals on the recipe exchange, I made this.....I had leftover buttered noodles with peas, this was nice and easy to use up my leftovers. I real shredded cheddar and added some plain bread crumbs to the top. Kid friendly. Thanks!

As suggested by other reviewers, I made some changes and came up with the following:  1 16oz package cooked rotini (similar to ziti), 1/4 c. butter, cubed, 1 1/2 c. shredded provolone/mozarella cheese, 1 12 oz can tuna drained, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 2/3 c. sour cream, 2/3 c. milk, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.  Place all ingredients in a large bowl or stock pan and mix up.  Pour into a 8"X12" casserole, sprinke with parmasean cheese.  Bake at 350F for 20 minutes.  So easy.  Everyone ate it without compaints.  Will use this on a regular basis!  Thanks to everyone for your ideas.  This is definitely a keeper.

5.31.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19521/tuna-noodle-casserole-iii/ ... This is one of those recipes you really don't need a recipe for;but since you have one, you try it - &(still) like it! :D I used two cans tuna,reserving the liquid.I added that with the soup & about half cup milk.Also added an eighth teaspoon cayenne pepper.A good amount(not spicy really, but good) for kids & adults.I also used shredded velveeta (about a cup in & half cup on.Just mixed everything together in the pasta pot.Topped with crushed (bottom of the bag) potato chips(over that half cup velveeta shreds).BOTH KIDS ATE IT. BOTH!  12&14!Yeah, really. Surprised me,too. :) Later: regular cheese was fine- & better for you.Just had velveeta in my fridge somehow before. :D Remember to hold back on the black pepper, if you're adding cayenne. 2/13Looking back to remake this since it was such a hit,I realized I didn't mention I didn't add any butter,SUBBED the shredded cheddar,& didn't use any breadcrumbs.Gee,where do I get off reviewing this anyway?!? ;D Btw,my mom used to do the breadcrumb deal&I liked it that way,too. And,put cheese directly on the casserole,not on the chow mein noodles or potato chip crumbs.On very top, it glues everything together. :(  :D Crispies on top.  :)6/13 Tried w nacho cheese soup,reserved tuna liquid&enough milk to fill soup can, 12 oz tuna, same c cheese in,1/2c on,still added the cayenne&was fine.Topped w potato chips,but maybe corn chips ... K asked if was healthy&w

Loved this recipe.  I used all the original Ingredients listed and added a 1/2 cup sour cream as suggested by Jenni from review of Aug 10, 2005. It was delicious and we had no leftovers.  My boyfriend told me that is was BETTER than his moms family recipe.  Thank you Marie & Jenn, this will be made may more times.  Oh & another thing, I was feeling lazy that day and didn't wanna add to all the dishes I already had to wash, so I didn't measure a thing. I eyeballed everything and it still came out perfect. Thanks.

Per another person's post, I added 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup milk to the soup.  I also added a couple handfuls of frozen peas and I mixed the bread crumbs with some melted butter for the topping.  It turned out delicious!!!

Great! Made a lot of changes based on other reviews. Added 1/3c milk and 1/3c sour cream, a sprinkle of seasoning salt and dried onion.  Left out the butter, melted a couple TBSP and mixed it with the bread crumbs and some parmesan.  Subbed 1/2 c shredded cheese and one slice of american. Would've added peas if I had them. Good base recipe.  Thanks.

Really good. My husband said this was good old fashioned Tuna Casserole. I didn't layer per se because I'm lazy. I just mixed in Mexican blend cheese along with the other described ingredients. And put a light layer of the grated cheese under the bread crumbs on top. Very good.

I cook this a tad differently.. the main difference is canned chicken rather than tuna. 

I double the recipe to cook in a 9''13'' pan. However, I put one can cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of chicken soup. I mix them together before layering into casserole. I also put crushed up, buttered, Ritz crackers on top. 

It is so yummy this way. Though it needs additional cooking time if you want your food hot rather than a little warm. 

Everyone loves this, every time I make it. It's in our favorites rotation!

This was very good.  I used two cans of soup, and shredded cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  I also added some cayenne pepper and paprika, too.  Just for a little kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for the family tonight. It was really yummy. The only thing I did was added a bit of cheddar cheese. The kids & I loved it. My husband is at work so he hasn't had the chance to try it yet. But everyone else thought it was a hit :o)

My family and I liked it.  I did add the milk and sour cream (garlic salt and parm. cheese on top) and mixed all the ingredients together (except for toasted bread crumbs - put those on top).  Next time I will try shredded cheese instead of the cheese slices next time.   Yum!

This was a great base to build on! I used 12oz package of noodles, 2 cans of tuna, 1 can cream of mushroom and filled empty can with milk, 1/4 cup mayo,1 cup shredded cheddar, half cup peas,pepper and garlic powder. Breadcrumbs on top.I omitted the butter. YUM! So creamy and a lot of flavor! Everyone loved it, I didn't have any leftovers!

I made this for dinner and it was great! i did make a few minor changes i buttered my backing dish and added milk and dried chopped onion to the soup. i only added a thin layer of bread crumbs on the top so it wouldn't be dry. I will for sure make this again in the future.

You can never go wrong with Tuna noodle casserole. I added peas and corn. I might add more cream of mushroom next time. It was an little on the dry side. I also just mixed everything together in a separate bowl first (no layering) and used shredded cheese instead.

It was decent. I would make a few modifications for next time:  add an additional can of tuna, add a splash or two of milk, and use shredded cheese instead of cheese slices. The bread crumbs on top give it a nice texture.

Great basic recipe!  I make two 2 Qt casseroles and freeze one but I like to substitute the cream of mushroom soup for one can of cheddar cheese and one can of cream of chicken and then cut out the rest of the cheese.  A can of cheddar cheese actually has less calories then a can of cream of mushrooms and I think it makes for a cheesier casserole

Excellant!  But I followed the advice of others.  I used the block velveta cheese and used a lot more then what 4 slices would be.  And I added 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup sour cream to the soup and mixed it in.  But the taste is great and it was nice and creamy...even the next day at work!  Thanks!

I loved this recipe, it's so easy and my kids eat it!  I use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cheddar cheese and then omit the shredded cheese, it seems creamier that way.  I do though sprinkle pepperjack cheese on top to give it some zip!  Thanks for sharing!

Could be better.  It needed a bigger dish and was somewhat dry.  It also needed to be in the oven longer than 15 minutes.  If I had heated the soup beforehand it might have been better.

Made a few additions as to previous reviews: used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken--used 12 oz of noodles & 2 cans tuna; 1 can mixed vegetables (drained); cooked 1/2 cup of sweet onion in the butter; 1/3 c sour cream; 1/3 cup milk, 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/8 tsp paprika, pinch of celery salt, 1/4 tsp regular salt, & a few grinds of fresh black pepper; I did use 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese instead of American--mixed in 3/4--mixed all together rather than layering and topped with Panko bread crumbs, the remaining 1/4 cup cheddar and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. A bit more time in prep, but worth it with the additional flavor....YUM!

I made this for lunch today, it was yummy!  I, too, used 1/2 c of sour cream mixed with the soup.  I'm not a fan of American cheese, so I used Havarti cheese instead, plus Ritz crackers for the topping!  I will definitely make it again.

This is a good basic recipe; however, I think just as is I would find it bland. I added 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp hot hungarian paprika and 1/2 tsp ground pepper to the soup mixture and the resulting flavor was very good. Per other reviews, I mixed the soup with 1/2 cup milk. I used whole wheat noodles to make it a little healthier and halved the butter. Topped it with bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese. Great cold weather comfort food!

Per other reviews, added an additional soup can of milk  and 2 TBS sour cream and i'm glad I did because it was just the right consistency. I skipped the butter. Added an extra can of tuna, 1/3 cup red onions, 1 cup of frozen peas, 3 cloves of garlic, sea salt, & course black pepper. Cooked for 10 minutes, stirred, and covered with crushed croutons and parmesan and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. This was pretty good for a basic casserole dish!

This was very easy and good.  I took other review advice.  1/3 c milk,  1/3 plain yogurt (no sour cream) and added seasoning with the cream of chicken (not a mushroom fan) soup.  mixed all ingredients together.   I also put in a handful of frozen mixed veggies.  And the last 5 min of cooking i added fresh tomatoes.  used grated cheddar.  I would probably leave off the bread crumbs next time, because i only had Italian seasoning crumbs and i think it was a bit much.  But crushed crackers would be great.  Thanks!

My husband really enjoyed this. I'm not a fan of tuna noodle casseroles but I thought it was good for a change. The only thing I changed was I added an extra can of tuna and probably added more bread crumbs. I think next time I'll add some peas to it. Will do this again.

I have two small children and make this about once a week - by demand.  My three year old can't get enough.  I like to follow the recipe exactly, but when there isn't time, I heat the remaining ingredients (less the crumbs) in a pan while the noodles cook and stir to combine when they are done.  Just as delicious!

My husband really like this and said he'd have that again, he doesn't care much for tuna noodle and I've tried other versions from this site.. good job! It's on my list for the upcoming grocery trip! Oh and we used spaghetti noodles, I followed the first reviewers suggestions with cayenne-milk-sour cream-parmesan-and-cheddar: it came out great! Update: We've made this a million times it seems! Today we made it with homemade cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup and mixed it all together prior to baking instead of layering it. So much faster and extremely tasty!

with a few adjustment's this was the best tuna and noodles I have ever had!! I took a few referal's from other comment's. I added- 2 can's of cream of mushroom soup, 2 can's of tuna, 1/2c. sour cream, about a cup of milk(I added the milk till it looked as creamy as I liked didn't really measure) sprinkled top with parmesan cheese, bread cube's, 20 min. after cooking I put french onion's over the top and baked 5 more min.

This was good! I added a canned of drained peas to it and swapped out the bread crumbs for french fried onions- that was a delicious move!  I also didn't layer like the recipe said. I just mixed everything together, grated cheese on top and pour the french fries onion on top of that.  I think however, next time I'll add two cans of tuna- but I'll definitely be making this again and again!

Had to add cayeene, salt and pepper so it would have enough flavor.  Used shredded cheddar in layers and then topped with bread crumbs and shredded parmesan.  With those additions...very tasty!

I used whole wheat noodles as that was all I had on hand.  It still came out good. Adding another can of tuna does no harm with an extra slice of cheese.  I just mixed everything (except the cheese)in a bowl, placed in baking dish and then topped with cheese and flavored bread crumbs.

This recipe gave me a lot of ideas, but what I ended up making was almost a different recipe (although a very delicious recipe!). I used rotini noodles, substituted a little milk and sour cream for the butter, stirred everything together with 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar (instead of layering with American slices), added 1/4 t. cayenne, used panko mixed with olive oil for the topping, and baked for about 2o minutes. This is a terrific base recipe that you could modify in many ways. It's definitely getting added to the weekly rotation!

A hit with the kids! I changed the recipe slightly -- I used about 1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese instead of the slices, and used 1 tsp. butter and 1/4 cup milk instead of the butter cubes. I mixed everything up, sprinkled with cracker crumbs and baked. Both my kids took seconds and my son (age 4) said he wanted to eat it again tomorrow night too!

I didnt layer the ingredients I just threw it in a big bowl and mixed it all together.  Then I pours half the mixture in a baking dish put some cheese on it and put remaining mixture on top.  I didnt want it to be too cheesey so I didnt put any cheese on top.  I have made this with just cheese slices and with the slices plus cheddar/monterey jack.  It as better with the chese mixure.  This was really good to my husband and I neither of us had ever tasted Tuna Cass before.  It has become a staple in our monthly rotation!

I mostly followed this recipe.  I used Marzetti frozen noodles instead of the egg noodles.  YUMMY! I also followed the suggestion about using milk instead of butter, and it worked fine.  I  added shredded cheddar cheese to the mix instead of sliced cheese, baked 10 minutes and then added bread crumbs to the top and broiled for a few minutes.  This was absolutely perfect.  Not too tuna-ee.

I took prior advice and added some peas and a second can of mushroom soup.  It was nice and saucy.  I didn't have bread crumbs (& didn't feel like making any) so I used crumbled ranch potato chips.  My family loved it and it didn't take much to fill you up.

I mix up the "filling" while I am cooking the egg noodles using the microwave to thaw frozen veggies (mixed veg or peas or both)so it will cook more quickly.  I eyeball the noodles and only stir in what I think I need to make sure it doesn't get too dry.  I use a handful of cheddar rather than the American.  I also use crushed ritz or corn flakes for the topping rather than boring old bread crumbs.

Not the best. Definitely add salt,  pepper, and dash of cayenne. Mixed together the butter and noodles after I drained them. Mixed together cream of mushroom, tuna and added some peas. Btw - I used two 5 oz cans of tuna. I would use more cheese to cover the whole dish as well as chips to give it some crunch instead of bread crumbs. Wasn't bad but could have been better. Good place to start.

For tuna noodle casserole, this was pretty good and even the kids ate it just fine.  
Changes are a must: 1/3 c. Sour cream, 1/3 c. Milk, sprinkle garlic salt, sprinkle bread crumbs (NOT 1/4 c.) and shredded cheese;  cook for 15 minutes in white oblong casserole dish

I took Marie's advice and experimented! I used two cans cream of mushroom, one soup can full of fat-free half & half plus a little sour cream as so many have suggested. I sautéed fresh mushrooms and onions adding minced garlic, thyme and parsley for flavor. The shredded cheeses I had on hand were a mix of Italian cheeses and some cheddar so I combined them--both a little through the noodle mixture and between the layers. My personal experience has been that using creamed soup mixes results in a pretty bland dish but I was pleasantly surprised. Thank you, Marie, for sharing--and allowing me to play with--your recipe!

Delicious with modifications. I followed the other reviews that add milk etc, but I subbed Greek yogurt vegetable dip for the sour cream. The family didn't even complain about one can of tuna which was awesome! I have picky eaters who love their tuna and one can was never enough before. I added parmesan to the breadcrumbs along with adding some Italian seasoning.

this was a good casserole, simple and good. A good base for your own favorites, I added peas and used cream of chicken, its what I had. It was a little plain so I added some spices and jalapenos for a little heat.

Very fast and simple to make!  I haven't had tuna casserole since I was a kid.  Made a couple of changes though. Since I have a family of 4 I doubled the noodles.  I also used 4 cans of tuna instead of of 2. I added 2 cans of sweet peas as well. 2 cans of cream of mushroom didn't do the trick, so I added a can of cream of chicken to the mix. Next time I might try adding some cream of celery.

Good recipe but bland... still tweaking it.  Definitely could use more cheese and tuna.

Very good. I used shredded mild cheddar cheese, and about a cup of peas. Husband loved it. Very simple to make. I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and 1/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of sour cream. and 10 oz of tuna.

We have 6 kids, so it's hard to please them all...but we did with this one.  I doubled the recipe to fit our family size, and added milk and sour cream as per other reviewers suggestions.  Mine baked in a glass 9 x 13 for about 25 minutes.  I didn't mean to omit the butter, but I did omit it by accident and it was still great.  I only had cubes of american cheese.  Since I was doubling the recipe, I cut up about a lb of the cheese, mixed 2/3 cup of milk with that and melted it in the microwave.  I mixed the tuna, soup, and 2/3 cup of sour cream into the cheese mix...then salted, peppered and onion powdered to taste.  I stirred the noodles into this mixture, then poured it all into the baking dish and covered with bread crumbs.  Two of our boys were gone for the evening, so I thought I'd have leftovers to eat for lunch today.  I was wrong....there wasn't even a spoonful left, and they are already asking to have it again next week.

This casserole was excellent! I made several changes: I used 1/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of sour cream as other reviewers mentioned. I mixed the milk, soup and sour cream together them mixed it in with the tuna and noodles. I layered the noodle mixture with cubes of velvetta. Then I topped with crushed ritz crackers and a little bit of shredded cheddar chesse. I also added some carrots and peas to the noodle mixture. IT was creamy and delicious!!

Good, simple recipe. It would have been good as-is, but to make it healthier, I used whole-wheat wide egg noodles, skipped the butter, and used fat-free cream of mushroom. It was still tasty!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I did make a few adjustments by adding 3/4 c. sour cream, 2 t.  Emeril's Essence, 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  At 350, the casserole baked for about 30 minutes.  It was very good and will become a "keeper."

very easy, throw-it-together-when-it's-late-and-there's-nothing-to-pack-for-lunch-tomorrow food!! I used leftover spiral pasta, but everything else we keep on hand (I used shredded mozzarella, much less butter, and Grape-nut like cereal as the topping). Cream of mushroom soup is always in the cabinet for a quick throw-together meal. Thanks for the idea! Edit: I have modified to recipe to add a can more or creamed soup and usually make a double portion to freeze. Everyone wants the recipe when I take it to a potluck.

My husband said this recipe was better than his mom's - that is the highest compliment I can think of because he NEVER says anything is better than his mom's cooking.    I did follow the suggestions about adding 1/4th a cup of sour cream and 1/3rd a cup of milk.  I also used 2 slices of Munster with the American Cheese.  :)

I made this and it came out wonderful! My family loved it. Only thing I changed is i added some garlic powder, black pepper, and crushed red peppers on top of the first soup layer and on top of the whole casserole since my family and I adore spicy foods. Other than that, I didn't change a thing!

We added 1/3 cup of sour cream and it turned out VERY creamy.  Maybe I'll ad some veggies next time to soak up some of the cream.   Very hearty.  Hubby and I both liked and would make again.

This was pretty good for a basic Tuna Noodle Casserole recipe!  My family didn't rave about it, but I will say my son had 3 servings and the whole dish was eaten by the time dinner was over! I added 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup cheddar cheese, simply because the ingredients sounded like it would be pretty bland without these. I also topped it with some broken up potato chips.

This recipe was amazing. I doubled it and added a can of peas, two more cans of tuna and instead of layering the ingredients, I mixed them all together in a bowl, then sprinkled the bread crumbs on top. I'm cooking for two grown men and they gobbled it up in no time.

I'm going to have to say this is my new top recipe for something to make for dinner really fast without having to go to the grocery store to buy ingredients! My husband really liked this and thought I had spent a lot of time in the kitchen making it.  I ended up using 1 1/2 cans of tuna, 1/2 cup milk as other reviewers had mentioned and added grated parmesean cheese to make it look(and taste) better.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great recipe.  I followed the other users suggestions and added peas, 1/3 cup milk, and 1/3 cup sour cream.  I also added sharp cheddar cheese and mixed this with the bread topping for a more substantial "crust".   This is very kid friendly recipe and made the perfect amount for a small family.

Following other reviewer's suggestions, I added 1/2 c milk and 1/3 c sour cream, as well as some salt & pepper. I think it was just right, turning out very creamy and good. I used cheddar instead of American, and used both bread crumbs and parmesean cheese as the topping. We're definitely adding this one to our meal rotation.

I also made a few adjustments, and the result was the first tuna casserole I actually enjoyed. I added sour cream, onion, salt & pepper, cheddar cheese (rather than slices)and I added parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs. I also mixed everything together rather than layering it.

I used Lasagna noodles because they're all I had on hand. I broke them up a bit. For the first layer I added garlic and dill cheese, and on the second layer I used marble cheddar cheese. I added corn to the tuna mixture. Overall I thought it was a quick and easy lunch. I liked it. My little one ate some of hers, so that's a plus. I would definitely make this again.

Very quick to assemble. Loved the milk and sour cream. The cayenne and seasoned salt were not overwhelming and added a nice flavor. I really enjoyed the American Cheese singles with the bread crumbs ontop. Next time I will stir the cheese in though. I just put it ontop, but it's so yummy I want it throughout!!! Thank you for a quick and delightful meal. Abbi ate buttered noodles. Bella loved the casserole!

I made this with a small can of peas (drained) and shredded Mexican Cheddar-Jack cheese.  It turned out great and made excellent leftovers!

This wasnt the best tuna casserole I have ever made.  It ended up really bland.  i had to add a lot of salt.  I also mixed everything together and added some sour cream and extra cheese.  I also did potato chips on top instead of bread crumbs.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I did use the suggestions of previous reviewers to add 1/3c milk and 8oz of sour cream to the recipe instead of the butter.  I used shredded colby jack cheese instead of the sliced cheese.  And on top I sprinkled potatoe chips.

So simple, but so comforting.  We didn't have noodles on hand, so I used 8oz of elbow macaroni.  Instead of trying to layer ingredients, I just mixed the tuna, pasta, and soup together, along with a litle dill and black pepper, then poured into a pan.  Topped with cheddar cheese and Ritz cracker crumbs, and dotted with about 2T of butter.  Baked until toasty on top.  The baked casserole was a little dry, but was perfect after mixing in a little mayo in my dish.

This is the first time I've tried making Tuna Noodle Casserole and this is a great basic recipe!  I also used a sour cream and milk instead of butter and thought it was good that way.  I added peas for something extra. I think it would have been a little boring for me without the peas. I also used whole wheat Ritz crackers for the topping and drizzled 3 Tb. butter over it instead of bread crumbs and Whole Grain spiral noodles instead of egg noodles. My husband and I both thought it was awesome with the whole grain noodles so I'll probably just use those in the future and we both LOVE Ritz cracker topping. I think next time I'll add a few spices.

I made this for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. I changed it up a little bit, I added frozen peas and I used one can of cream of celery and actually "made" the soup instead of adding milk later. (mostly because I only had one can on hand) I also used mexican cheese because it sounded like it would taste better. I used tri color pasta instead of the shells because I wanted some color! It came out wondeful and we will be having it more often!

It took me an hour to get this ready. It takes a while to bring the water to a boil etc. Also it needs to be stirred at some point. The taste was delicious.

My husband and I love this easy standard -- but we top with "Cheez-Its" instead of breadcrumbs. (I was 6 mnths. pregnant when I first tried it!) Sounds crazy but tastes oh so yummy!

This is a now a regular in our meal cycle.  I made some healthier changes to it.  I used 1 tablespoon of butter, no-fat cream of chicken soup, and a handful of shredded cheese tossed on top.  I also use whole wheat noodles.  It really tastes just as good (to me) although my husband prefers regular noodles.

Great and simple. I did make a few changes after reading reviews. I went with 1/3 cup sour cream and milk. I used 2 packages of tuna, instead of can. Cooked noodles. While that was cooking, I mixed tuna,milk, sour cream and cream of chix (my family won't eat mushrooms) put in microwave 3 mins. Once noodles were cooked, I put them in a square casserole dish, then butter cubes, tuna mixture, and  american cheese. I did that until it was all used. For the topping, I did shedded cheese, and a bit of parmesan cheese then flavored bread crumbs. For the side I used broccoli cauliflower mix, with cornbread.I think it might be good with peas or just broccoli. I have been changing from box mixes they don't have enough for our family,unless I buy 2 boxes. Since making homemade dishes my children seem to eat more and less junk food. I will suggest this to others, it's a great dish for cold and busy nights, clean up was a snap!!

This is very very good with some changes.  I didn't have my casserole dish clean, so I used my 8x8 square pan for the two of us.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, cream of chicken plus one can of milk, a can of peas, and only 2 slices of cheese.  Also added some parm on top.  Because of the size of the dish, I had to cook for more like 22 minutes.  Very yummy!

This is great! I topped the dish with fried onion straws instead of bread crumbs, which adds a bit of extra flavor. This will become a new staple in my house.

This was a good filling dish. I also added 1/3 c milk and 1/3 c sour cream, some pepper and onion pwd to the soup. I used double the amount of American cheese, and mixed italian bread crumbs with melted butter for the top. This is a lot easier than the "Tuna casserole from scratch" here on this site, although the scratch recipe is very good, too.

Good and easy, although I'd recommend doubling the sauce to make it creamier.  I also added onion and other spices to enhance the flavor, as others had suggested.

This recipe was pretty good. I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup(I would use 1 1/2 next time) and added peas which I could have done without. Instead of bread crumbs I used croutons and that worked out pretty well too.

This is the recipe my mom used to make. I add peas and onion powder for more flavor, and top with crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs because we like the crunch. Stirring the ingredients together over low heat for a few minutes before putting it in the casserole dish to bake will make sure the cheese melts and everything is cooked all the way through.

Very bland as is, remade with adjustments= excellent. Won't post as it would appear my own recipe? It definitely needs onion, I always use old bay or any type seafood spice-mix with tuna, add peas, garlic to taste,  never american cheese, I melt cheddar with the milk.

Maybe it would be better if you were mix things together first and use shredded cheese instead?   Not making this again.

Easy 'thrown together' meal in under 30mins! I had 8-9 oz leftover egg noodles and added a large can of tuna (12oz/9oz drained net wt). I also added 1/3C Milk, 1/3C Sour Cream, forgot the parmesan, salted with Herbamare (Canadian vegetable/sea salt blend) and a lot of shredded cheddar cheese.  It was really good! I prefer the greater tuna:noodle ratio! All three of my picky children ate it and rated it a 6-7.  That's a keeper for me!

My kids loved it!!!! They even asked if they can have the leftovers for dinner again, my son said that he didn’t know tuna could taste so good, my husband had seconds.... Will definitely make again. The only thing I added was a sprinkle of chili powder, garlic salt and parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs.

This turned out great. We substituted Baby Swiss for the American and I think that was what made it extra good and "creamy"! It's a little bland but some ground pepper at the table solved that.

Tasted great but the cream of mushroom did not spread, and I ended up having to mix up the layers in the end. I think a 2nd can of cream mushroom may be needed. Or even adding a larger can.

I made it with adding 1/3 sour cream and milk to the mushroom soup. Only wish I made with a large can instead of 10oz for more sauce. Very good recipe!!! Will def make again.

My son loves Tuna Helper and said this was better.  My other son who does not like Tuna Helper gobbled this up.  My husband get saying this is really good.  It was easy and quick with enough left over for my lunch today.  FYI - I did add 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar cheese as previous reviewers suggested.  Mixed everything together in a large bowl instead of layering.  Son and husband added their own salt, but I thought it was fine as is.  So good!

I was surprised how good this was considering how easy the recipe was. Did not change a thing for my first time. If you are looking for something quick and easy, yet delicious, give this one a try.

Easy to prepare.  However, next time I'm going to mix all the the ingredients together rather than layering them so that the noodles will be evenly coated and moist.  I used gluten free noodles.  It was a bit salty for me, but my man loves salt

Pretty good but slightly bland. I did go off others reviews and added some milk and sour cream but still needs something. Going to add more tuna and maybe some onions and Cheddar cheese next time. Also using just breadcrumbs didn't get toasted up. I will try with crumbled chips or Ritz crackers next time in addition to the other changes I mentioned.

I learned today my family is not a fan of Tuna casserole. I however LIKED it. I did add corn, carrots, and an extra can of tuna. I don't think I'll make it again but only cause my picky family doesn't like it.

Good if you are in a pinch and tired but not very exciting. Hubby didn't like the breadcrumbs on top. I usually just make this recipe on the stove top and omit the whole oven sections hitch saves a ton of time.

This was good, simple comfort food.  Great for a cold, drizzly night!  I did add a soup cup of milk to the soup and I didn't layer things, just put in the noodles, butter, tuna, 2 slices of cheese and poured the soup over all that.  I baked that for 10 minutes, took it out and stirred it, then added 2 more cheese slices and the breadcrumbs and baked for another 10 minutes.  Easy as can be!

Very Tasty.  Like others, I added 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup milk, sprinkling of dried onion & I personally like cheese so I doubled it.  It turned out perfect.  As written, I believe it would have been too dry for my taste.  Made the  8 serving recipe as 4 was too small and the 6 serving called for 1/2 cans and I didn't want to throw anything away and didn't have anything else planned to cook in the near future to use the soup up.

Yum! Family devoured it and my 16-year-old son said it was the best tuna casserole I've made yet. I used cream of celery soup, 1/3 cup milk and sour cream and omitted the butter. Used sharp cheddar because I prefer it and to start it off I sauteed 1/3 of an onion and two large carrots. then added everything to that. Seasoned liberally with garlic salt and seasoned salt. Used small shell pasta but would have preferred whole wheat penne. Next time ... It was so good.

YuM! ;-P
I used Cream of Chicken soup rather than mushroom, crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs, and added a little bit of milk as suggested by reviewer Mrs. Chapman. I also followed her advice of just mixing it all together...baking about 2/3 of the way, then give it a stir and top with cheese and chips and bake until done. In addition, I did not drain the tuna (in water) for added flavor and did not use butter at all.
Thanks for the recipe...was easy and good. Also, thanks to Mrs. Chapman for her helpful suggestions. Next time I might try, in addition, another reviewers suggestion of adding sour cream. Sounds even better!

I had not made a tuna casserole in years because we used Tuna Helper and weren't that crazy about it.  I thought I would try a homemade tuna casserole and this was a winner.  We won't be using Tuna Helper anymore.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and used shredded cheddar instead of the american slices and sprinkled grated parmesan over the assembled casserole before baking also I used crushed seasoned croutons for the topping and no chips.  It turned out yummy.  Will make often and have added it to my "regular" recipe arsenal.

I'm usually not a big casserole fan, but this was really good. I used homemade cream of celery soup. I added the tuna to the soup, then ladled over the hot noodles. I followed that with some American cheese, another layer of noodles and soup, then topped with shredded sharp cheddar, bread crumbs and sprinkled on some paprika for color. Thank you Marie!

Love this basic recipe!  I added sour cream and mile to the mushroom soup, with some spices and a handful of chopped celery for extra boost. I also used crushed cheese crackers mixed with a little butter as a topping.This is a "Do again" recipe the kids really liked, since it was easy for them to make and better for them than just plain pasta and cheese.

Great recipe.  My brother and his best friend both LOVED it.  I made a double batch because I knew my brother was craving tuna noodle casserole.  Between he and his friend they polished off a whole casserole dish to themselves.  I will make it again for sure !!!!
