This salad is so refreshing. It surprised me how easy it was to make but even more how tasty it is. This will be made at my house a lot during the summer.

This was pretty good - next time I'll use a homemade ranch salad dressing as the bottled one I used left a little to be desired.  I broke my cauliflower into very small pieces to make it easier to get a little of everything on one fork, and I also used Spanish pimento-stuffed olives, and the red added nice color.  Next time I think I'll add some chopped red pepper for more color, and I think KyminNM had a great idea to add edamame - that would be fabulous in this!  Still, this is a nice change-of-pace salad, particularly for us cauliflower lovers!

This was a nice combination of flavors. I mixed some edamame in with the peas, and it was a great addition. I made my own ranch with cashew butter, and instead of yogurt, I mixed it with about a tablespoon of sour cream. The cauliflower was too much texture, though--it was too hard to get everything in one bite. I'd make this again without it and add more edamame. The green olives are a must.

This recipe was pretty good.  I thought the yougurt-ranch dressing was a little thick, so I added some olive juice to it to thin it out.  I also didn't have any cashews so I used almonds instead.  They were good for crunch, but I think the cashews would have done quite a bit for the flavor.  I'd like to make again, because I thought this was different, but overall I thought it needed just a little bit more flavor.

Quite good.  I made it exactly as written.  Great way to use up extra plain yogurt.

This tastes very good.  I only had canned peas, but it worked out fine.

This was a nice salad.  Even my daughter who claimed to "not like cauliflower" enjoyed it!  The nuts & cauliflower are nicely crunchy, the peas mellow it, the olives add a salty balance. I think next time I might add some mustard to the dressing for a little bite, but we enjoyed it as is.

This recipe was a nice change. I added real bacon bits and some garlic powder. Olives are a must.

I like this very much- and particularly that it is lighter in calories than the typical mayonnaise and sour cream based recipes.  I added dill and salt, and used sunflower seeds.  Next time I might add some sweet or green onion and a little lemon zest.

Pretty good. I omitted the garlic powder bc I used my homemade ranch dressing that is made with 2 cloves of garlic. The cashews really make this, but  I also added 2 strips of crumbled bacon. I do think it helped, but isn't everything better with bacon?

Next time I would like to find a vegan version of the dressing for my friends, however I have to say this was really different and tasty. I used vanilla instead of plain yogurt, took the suggestion of breaking up the cauliflower into very small pieces and using green olives with pimento, but also added one each of the mini bell peppers in orange, red and yellow for a little color. Have already shared the recipe with a few friends! Thank you for submitting and for the suggestions!
