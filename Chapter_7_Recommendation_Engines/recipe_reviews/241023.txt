I too grind my oats to a fine powder in my Vitamix before adding the rest of the ingredients. Both my mango and banana were frozen and I used coconut Greek yogurt and Silk coconut milk since I did not have orange juice. It was pretty tasty.

I recently purchased a Vitamix blender and have been searching for smoothie recipes that my family will enjoy. This was refreshing and full of flavor. I substituted a peeled orange for the orange juice and added a half a cup of milk in order to have enough liquid. I didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla instead. I'll definitely make this again, great recipe.

I always put the oats in first on an oatmeal smoothie, grind them to a powder (simply because I like that texture better than pieces of oatmeal), and I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of plain.  My mango was not frozen, so I did add some crushed ice to reach that perfectly chilled, creamy, thick texture.  Enjoyed today as an afternoon snack.  Very nice smoothie.

Yummy! I love smoothies with oatmeal in them .The frozen mango i used had carrots in the mix, and I added a splash of cashew-almond milk to thin it out a little. Loved the flavors!

I didnt have any mango so I used strawberries.  I also used Silk vanilla milk and used a vanilla greek yogurt .  I didnt have any plain oatmeal so I used strawberries and cream oat meal.  which is why I figured I would use the Silk milk instead of orange juice.  I t was thick and delicious.  I need to have my smoothies thick as my mother has trouble swallowing due to her stroke so this was the perfect guidance for me.  Thanks

I added a bit of milk, lots of ice, 1 mango chopped up, half of a banana, orange juice with mango flavor, coconut flavored Greek yogurt, granola and a bit of water. It was the right amount of sweetness and texture was nice and smooth! Def recommend this for afternoon snack or breakfast smoothie!

Really yummy! I put about 2 cups of orange juice in so there would be enough liquid. I used fage 0% greek yogurt. I put about 1/2 cup of oats instead of 1/4, 1 cup of mango instead of 1/2 and one full small banana instead of 1/2.

Yum, this was tasty! I did the opposite, my banana was frozen but my mango was fresh and so juicy and sweet. I squeezed out as much juice from the mango as I could (I have no orange juice) and added just a splash of almond milk and some ice. I threw in some cinnamon and a few blueberries that needed to be used. It was really good.
