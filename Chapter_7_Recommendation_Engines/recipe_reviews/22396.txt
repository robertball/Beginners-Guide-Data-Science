Awesome Passover recipe - got rave reviews from my guests!  This is delicious and looks beautiful.  I shaved some bittersweet chocolate for the top and it looked like it came from a bakery.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very light dessert, even with all the chocolate!
Recommend it for any occasion.  The only tough part is beating the eggs thoroughly.

This is the best passover cake I have ever made.  It was fairly easy and looked beautiful.  I garnished the cake with a few raspberries on top and kiwi and raspberries on the corner of the plate.  Everyone was impressed and couldn't believe how light and delicious it tasted.  I would definitely make this again.  Make sure you grease the wax paper thoroughly, so the cake doesn't break apart.

This is quite possibly the greatest Passover dessert ever!!!  It's still not a macaroon, but is easy to make and tastes GREAT.  I plan on making this every year.

I may be a gentile, but when I made this for my Old Testament class they begged for more!

This recipe is delicious fun, and very moist-unlike typical Passover desserts. If the kids like it sweeter, add chocolate chips/or more sugar to the batter, or add more sugar/or chocolate chips to the filling. Parchment paper is a must! No stick, no mess, no added calories.
Enjoy!

Kind of hard to make, and not sure it was worth it.

Dynamite!  Easy to do, not overtly sweet.  Wonderfully light.  Enjoyed/savored by everyone.  Definitely a year round treat.

I made this for my siser-in-law who can't have any wheat or gluten. It is delicious. The chocolate flavor is perfect, and it looks very elegant. This is going to be a traditional dessert in our family.

WOW!  This ia an excellent addition to our Passover dinner and all the guests at my in-laws loved it!  It was a hit and I'm sure I will be making it again next year!  Also, it's great to have a recipe with clear and descriptive directions - it really helped a lot.

It was just ok.  Would like it a bit sweeter.  By the way, I used Reynold's non-stick foil, but the cake still stuck to it a bit.  Also, I found the frosting somewhat hard to spread.  I'll keep trying other recipes before going back to this one.

This torte was a little bit of work, but worth it.  Got rave reviews from family and friends at our Seder.  Definitely not your typical frowned faces from Passover baking - this could be made year long and savored!

Delicious!  Since others may not have toasted almonds before like me, here’s a recipe: To toast sliced or slivered almonds, heat oven to 350E. Spread almonds in one layer in a shallow baking pan. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until light golden brown.  Cool completely. To grind, use food processor or chopper. I used sliced almonds and the first batch went from underdone to burned within 2 minutes so watch them closely. I used a chopper to finely cut them. I wanted my torte to look like the photo so I toasted another ½-¾ cup more sliced almonds to put on the outside edge when it was done.  To affix the almonds, I put some on my hand and patted them into the cocoa whipped cream.  I thought I had a standard size jelly-roll pan but it was larger than what was stated in the recipe (mine is 11”x17”) so had to use 2 parchment sheets.  I didn’t spread the cake the full length of the pan but stopped about 2” short so it would be similar to the recipe.  The cake did not come off the parchment easily; I had to ease it off with a spatula. There was just enough cocoa whipped cream to fill and cover the torte so don’t make the filling layers too thick. This recipe served 10 (instead of 12). It took me longer to prepare this dessert than the recipe stated but it was worth every minute.  It got rave reviews.  It’s a terrific dessert for the Days of Unleavened Bread.   I am eager to make this for another friend who has a gluten-free diet.

I'm reviewing this before Pesach this year based on making it Pesach last year (I'm a little slow!).

I agree with the poster who said that this might be the best Passover desert EVER.  It's really delicious and not just "delicious for Passover". 

I also experienced issues with the cake sticking. Frankly, I kind of stuck it all back together and pasted it together with the whipped cream.  Next time I'll go heavier on greasing my parchment.

It was a bit of work, but worth it! A very nice cake to bring to someone else's seder! :)
