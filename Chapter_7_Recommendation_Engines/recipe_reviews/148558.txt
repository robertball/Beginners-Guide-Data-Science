These are very popular here in Washington. Whenever I go out, I make sure to order one of these for an after dinner drink. When I make them at home, though, I do make them a little stronger.

So good.

These were great. Even the people who do not drink martinis liked them. I served a slice of apple on the glass.

I followed the recipe exactly, and to me the butterscotch stands out a bit too much. A little tweaking helped.

Great twist on the plain Appletini.  This is my new favorite drink.

This is a great combination of flavors.  I discovered I was out of the Sour Apple when I had already started so used Apple Stoli instead.  I think as a result of that we ended up adding 1/2 of another cranberry juice.  The butterscotch was not overwhelming for us - rather gave a warmth and richness to the flavor of the drink.  By the end of the drink, however, it was losing some of its appeal.  Good, but not great for us.

***** I fell in love at the thought of it and then WOW! Nothing else will do. I little less on the butterscotch tough. In my opinion about 1/2 oz.
