Here's a tip for zesting a lemon:  Use a vegetable peeler to remove the paper thin layer of lemon peel.  Put these strips of lemon peel in a food processor along with the sugar from the recipe.  Pulse the food processor until the lemon peel is in bits.  Works great and is extremely quick.  No more grated knuckles!

I SOOO love lemons, and this is perfect for a hot Texas summer!  Just beware, mine took a little longer than the 2 hours noted to freeze (using the pan-in-the-freezer method), and you should plan to serve it all the day you make it - it became VERY firm by the next day.  I must say though - my favorite part of this recipe was the reviewer tip to peel the lemon with a vegetable peeler and then whirl the shavings with the sugar in a food processor. Genius!! My knuckles thank you. (Now I can make Lemon Pudding Cake twice a week instead of once... :) )  NOTE:  The name is a little misleading; it's more like lemon ice cream rather than an ice or sorbet.

The milk curdled when I added it to the lemon juice/sugar mix...what did I do wrong?  Help, I really want to try it!    RE-REVIEW  I'm so glad I tried it again!  I did as suggested above, and used the whisk beaters on my handheld electric mixer to first whisk the lemon juice and sugar together then while whisking, I slowly drizzled in the milk.  I used 4 cups of skim and 1 cup of 2% since I have a 4 qt. ice cream maker, and others said it was overly sweet with just 4 cups of milk.  It turned out wonderfully, not quite as creamy as a sherbet, but I would think if you used whole milk or some half & half, it would be richer, but I liked it as is.  I just wish the recipe listed a specific amount of lemon juice so I can get consistent results, as lemons can vary in their juiciness.  I actually used four smaller lemons and zested them all.  I bet it would be good with lime and orange, even raspberries as well and you could make your own rainbow ice.

Delicious with Meyer lemons. For the person who wanted to know how to prevent clotting, whisk the sugar and lemon together until smooth. Then slowly drizzle in milk a little at a time, while whisking quickly. Keep whisking and adding milk in a little at a time until it's all gone. 

I also second the person who cut the milk down to 3 cups since my ice cream machine is a 1.5 qt.

I make lots of ice cream, and this recipe's a keeper! (It's also lower fat than my other ones...but now I wonder how this would taste with half cream and half milk...) So I made this a second time wth smaller, less ripe meyer lemons (6 total), 1.5 cups of sugar, and 2.25 cups of milk - still delicious and impressive.

This is a wonderfully refreshing dessert. Since my family likes tart lemony desserts, I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and in addition to the two lemons, I added 3/4 cup of bottled lemon juice. This is a definite keeper!

I made this last night and my family loved it!
Make sure you mince the lemon zest as teeny as you can.  I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the lemon juice by quite a bit as we like things very tart.  I would suggest adding the lemon juice a tablespoon at a time until you have the tartness you like. (As the recipe is written, I think the lemon ice would be extremely sweet.)  Once processed, make sure you let the lemon ice age in the freezer in a tupperware container until it is a nice scoopable texture.  (My kids ate some straight out of the ice cream maker and loved it soft as well.)  Very nice and refreshing for a warm Southern California evening. You should try this one.

Great recipe!  Following the advice of others I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 c., (actually 1 c. sugar and 1/2 c. of Splenda), and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 c. of Meyer lemon juice.  For those who would like to know how much juice one lemon has, I measured 1/4 c. from a medium sized lemon.  It's only a general guideline. I'm sure it could vary depending on ripeness, etc.  My result was excellent.  Just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess, and I love that I don't have to feel guilty eating it.

this is a great recipe, i made it in my icecream maker and it came out great.Although at first i put too much mixture into the icecream maker so it didn't freeze and i had to pour half of the mixture out. it is a great recipe one of the best i've made so far. i reduced the sugar content to 1 1/2 cups like other paople said and it turned out wonderful! i used 1 lemon 1 orange and 1 lime and used skimmed milk for a very low fat alternative to ice cream. it goes great if you put it in a waffle cone. i left half of the mixture to make a couple days later and this batch was the best because i had kept it in the fridge which was very cold so it speeded up the freezing process and could be eaten straight out of the ice cream maker! it does go rock solid if left in the freezer so you need to thaw it for a bit so it's not as hard. i might make this again. thanx!

Having read other reviews before making this, I followed their advice and cut back on the sugar. I used 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 but it was still too sweet. I wish I had also increased the lemon as some had suggested, that may have cut the sweetness a bit more and it could have been a little more lemony. Still, it was good and easy to make (I used the lemon peel in the food processor trick that one reviewer suggested which worked great!). A good summertime dessert.

I have made this several times, both with and without the lemon zest.  It's great both ways, and is always a hit!

I made this last night and it came out great. I don't have a food processor, but I tried the trick of peeling the lemon thinly with a paring knife, putting the strips in the blender with the sugar. As you can imagine, that wasn't working very well (I'm a new cook!), but I then added the lemon juice and blended again and that did the trick...nice, fine lemon zest in the the lemon/sugar mixture. I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and upped to juice by 1/2 cup, and whisked the milk in slowly as mentioned by others. Came out perfect! Also, if you won't be able to serve it within a few hours while it's nice and scoopable, you can use the same recipe for ice pops  since it will harden quite a bit but still taste very nice.

This was really great.  It is so nice to not have to have an ice cream maker in order to make a good ice cream.  My children loved it and now want me to make orange and then lime.  I will be making this for many years to come!!!

I read the reviews and ended up creating my own recipe, which is awaiting review/acceptance here.  I had to halve the recipe because of the capacity of my ice cream machine, but I kept the full amount of lemon juice, and zested both lemons.  I used a combination of milk and heavy cream and sugar and honey.  It was really good.  This recipe was a good starting point, but I'm sure if I'd followed it I would have had a very sweet frozen confection with no tanginess at all.

Very tasty!  I halved the recipe and poured it into ice pop molds.  The pops turned out to be a little soft...but still very delicious.  Here's a few tricks I used to make this recipe really easy.  First, cut your lemons in half and juice them...THEN you can zest them very easily by tucking your fingers inside the lemon for protection.  Second, put your sugar and lemon zest in the food processor and process until fine.  Third...go ahead and add the milk and process until well blended.  I didn't cut back the sugar, but I did add extra lemon and lemon zest to taste.  Can't wait to try it again by freezing in a pan.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great and refreshing! but instead of using 2 lemons, I only juiced and zested one. Then I cut up 5 strawberries and put them in the blender, along with some bottled lemon juice. I added that to the sugar, milk, and lemon mixture. I don't have a ice cream maker, so I used the method of checking every hour and giving it a good stir. It came out deliciously sweet, like strawberry lemonade sorbet! Can't wait to try other fruits!

I have to admit that I just used bottled lemon juice, and I don't think I'd make it that way again. This was certainly different than anything else I've ever had, and _very_ sweet! Also, it took 5 hours in the freezer (stirred every hour or so) before it was even remotely scoopable, and even then it was mushy and melted almost immediately. If I try this again, I'll use more lemon, less sugar, and start it in the morning to freeze all day.

I like this recipe a lot and have made it a number of times.  Very refreshing and I love the texture of the lemon zest in it.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of lemon juice - to three lemons - and processed the zest and sugar together.  I also scalded the milk beforehand to ensure a creamy texture.

My fiance loves lemon sorbet, but I prefer the texture of ice cream, so I thought this recipe would be the perfect compromise.  It was incredibly easy to make (the hardest bit was zesting the lemons) and I used whole milk to get a nice creaminess.  I just poured everything into my ice cream maker after giving it a good whisking.  The lemon ice turned out beautifully--creamy but not heavy & not sickly sweet.  I served it with fairings (but I imagine it would be delicious with any spicy, gingery cookies) and it made a very tasty & refreshing end to a summer barbecue.  I'll definitely be making this again.  :D

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious.  I didn't use our icecream maker and I used skim milk but it turned out wonderfully anyway. It's now a regularly requested dessert!

Way to much sugar and not enough lemon. I added extra lemon and still thought it was too sweet.

Wonderfully refreshing! The one problem I had with this recipe was that it never froze completely in my Kitchenaid ice cream attachment.  I ended up having to put the very soft mixture into the freezer where it hardened completely. I would have preferred a softer consistency.  I believe this may be due to the fact that the recipe does not call for chilling the mixture before placing it into the ice cream freezer. This mixture was just cool to the touch.

I liked it... so did the kids.  Husband thought a bit sweet.  Super simple recipe.  I had no problem with curdling... adding the milk while the mixer mixed the lemon and sugar worked well.  I would go with a bit more lemon personally or maybe add some orange zest/juice for something different, but the recipe as is is a great, simple, desert!

One of my favourite aspects of this recipe is how it can be successfully still-frozen. 

Remember that ALL ice creams and sorbets are going to be sweeter before they are frozen-- the ice crystals will compensate for this--so be careful when making adjustments. The best way to do it is to of course halve the recipe and finish it and then make any adjustments to a full-sized recipe. 

For those of you concerned about sugar, it would be worth trying this recipe with sucralose (Splenda) to see if the texture and taste are comparable.

This is a great, incredibly easy recipe!  My husband and I have also substituted limes, oranges, raspberries or even strawberries in place of the lemons.  Yum!

I love this recipe! It has all the taste of ice cream without the fat (I used 1% milk). Also, try making it with red grapefruit!

This is pretty good, but it's extremely sweet.
I made the recipe as written and tasted the mix
before I froze it. I ended up adding a lot more
lemon juice to cut the sweetness.

I'm going to try and find a way to reduce the caloric count on it.

This stuff is really good!!! I made it and even though it took a bit of time since I don't have a ice cream machine, it was worth it!!! I love the taste, it's like frozen lemonade with an ice creamy taste to it! I couldn't stop my mother from eating it, very good! Also I added a bit of lime since I didn't have enough lemons, a very nice kick with the zest! Thanks

So easy!  And so good.  You only need a little to make a sweet yet refreshing treat.  I'be had nothing but compliments on this.  I've made it without the lemon zest, and it's just as good.

This is delicious!  I have made it 2x this week alone!  I have a 1 1/2 qt. sorbet maker and cut the recipe down to fit it.  3 cups milk, 1 1/2 cup sugar, and same amount lemons.  I plan on trying to make orange next.
Thanks!

Very refreshing. Seeing other reviews before making, I used less sugar than suggested. I was glad i did, even with less sugar it was a little too sweet. I served mine with fresh raspberries, a lovely light dessert to round off a meal.

This is a great recipe for the ice cream lover who happens to be on a diet.  The only thing that keeps this recipe from getting 5 stars is that I had to zest a lemon.  It's extremely easy and tastes wonderful.  My only complaint about this recipe is that I think it's a bit overly sweet.  I just added a bit more milk and lemon to cut the sweetness though.

This recipe is WAY too sweet.  2 cups of sugar is too much.  Will continue my search for lemon sherbet elsewhere.

This was ok. It took forever to freeze and it turned out wayyyy too sweet but the texture was nice and it tasted pretty good (wayyyy too sweet!) I loved the bits of frozen lemon zest. I found it to be really milky which is usually a good thing but with lemon..not. Next time I will look for a recipe for Lemon Ice without the milk...I was trying for something like Italian Ice. The recipe was great but is just not what I was hoping for. If you like Lemon Milk this is the recipe for youl

Tasted good, but not what I was looking for. Be careful when tinkering with the amounts of sugar used. The less sugar you use the more solid the resulting lemon ice will be.

Aside from the perpetual, "must eat it right away" problem all homemade icecreams seem to have, this one is tasty and very enjoyable.  I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and put in a BIT less milk.  (2% was used.)

This was okay. Very sweet...almost too sweet. Also used three lemons instead of two. Had the consistencey of frozen milk, too icy. But its cheap and easy to make.

This is pretty good!  Nice and refreshing!  I did take other people's advice and used less sugar. I used a half cup less, I really could have cut back even more.  I will try this one again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used an ice cream maker for 40 minutes.  It never got as firm as ice cream, but it held enough air that it never became a frozen rock either. 

It tasted more like sherbet than it did the Italian lemon ice I was looking for.  When I make this recipe again I'll likely use a bit more zest.
