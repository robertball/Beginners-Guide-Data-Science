My grandma made these for me all the time when I was growing up. Instead of cold milk, she used heavy cream. Talk about heaven! To this day, it's still one of my favorite things she ever made.

We've never had one of these before, so we weren't quite sure what to expect, but we LOVED them! So simple, rich and delicious, and made basically with things that we always have on hand. This was super refreshing and chocolatey and something that we will be enjoying often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe had a few problems for me, firstly the measuring system is not set correctly. It needs to be set to fluid ounces. If you want to increase the serving size, use a calculator. 

Second issue I had was the chocolate sauce plus milk and seltzer water ratio was 2 to 8, making this an incredibly watery recipe. 

I'd say the flavor combination was good though, just needed to be stronger.

Made recipe exactly to instructions. Straw stood up in middle as others suggested as a sign of making it right. Didn't much care for the taste, neither did my husband. Thank you though.

I made this my whole life and I can assure you it needs Half a glass of cold 2% or regular whole milk.  He used twice as much chocolate syrup as you would actually need.  The remaining Half of glass is seltzer water or club soda.  Trust me on this... I was responsible for serving these to my father on a daily basis in NY.

I made it using club soda and it came out tasty! I laughed after I put in my straw because of the last comment on the video "if the straw falls to the side, you did it wrong." I was laughing happily because my straw stood up straight! My daughter has name this chocolate soda lol
