I had almost 2 cups of light cream that had soured, so I looked for something to make with it. This cake was delicious! I only made 2 substitutions: brown sugar for white and pecans for walnuts in the filling. The cake was incredibly moist with a smooth texture. I made it in a bundt pan, but next time will bake it in a regular tube pan. You'll want the streusel caramelized on top! BTW, it took about 55-60 minutes in this type of pan. For the sake of your thighs, don't make this too often! It's hard to resist another slice.

I made it once with nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream - tasty, but the cake fell (probably not enough fat in the batter). I wouldnâ€™t recommend making this substitution.

There might a error in this.. It looked nice before it was ready to come out but dropped when it came out .. I think its too much sour cream or not the right mix of baking powder  not sure but did it twice same results,  most other recipes call for 1 cup 8oz  not 16  but it had a good taste but very flat..  I did follow the recipe  no alterations...

this is a very good coffee cake as is, but even better with a few changes.  I made this in a bundt pan.  I used pecans and brown sugar in the streusel.  I started with a layer of the streusel in the bundt pan and then half the batter.  Here's where I really changed it up...I put a light sprinkle of the streusel mix, then a layer of thinly sliced apple, then the rest of the streusel, then the rest of the batter.  It was exactly what I'd hoped it would be!  Cinnamony, appley, brown sugary, toasted nutty, cakey goodness!

I did try this recipe. However, I used 8oz of sour cream and I added all dry ingredients which included the baking powder, baking soda, salt and flower and sifted twice. Cake was perfect and was very moist. The topping at the end.... I sprinkled it then took a knife and cut it into the batter and smooth batter over.

This baked up beautifully, and I took it to work for everyone to try.  With one thing or another, I ended up not trying it, but pple were still eating it today, so it was probably pretty good (I brought it in Monday and today is Wednesday).  I made three layers of the topping--there's enough to do so in this recipe if you sprinkle--because I wanted a ready made topping on the actual top of the cake.  Since bundt cakes are cooked upside down, I put part of the topping on the bottom before putting the batter in.  Not sure I recommend that as a lot of the sugar caramelized and stuck to the pan.  Looked pretty, though!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with fat free Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream( I've found it works well in most things). It was wonderful! Great texture and flavour. I was a little concerned about the 16 ounces of sour cream ( yogurt in my case) after reading some of the comments but went for broke and put it all in! Beautiful!

I think this is the best sour cream coffee cake. It's so moist it practically melts in your mouth, it's not too sweet and it's very easy to make. The only coffee cake recipe I will be using.

I made this three times in one day, each time thinking I must have left out one of the leavening ingredients or used expired ones.  The third time should have been perfect.....I bought fresh baking powder and baking soda.......but all three sank into a useless mess as it cooled.  Neither myself nor my husband could account for the catastrophic failure the third time.   I was making this for my next door neighbor who had just lost her husband.......deeply disappointed after three trips to the grocery store for sour cream and all this time I have nothing to bring her!!!!

We thought this was amazing. I used brown sugar and doubled the filling because we love cinnamon. Baked about 1 hour. A true keeper

I made no changes to the basic recipe. I have made it in a Bundt pan as well as the 9 X 13 pan and it was excellent in both. I did double the Walnut mixture because I love nuts. This is by far the best coffee cake. Do moist and delicious!

good moist cake. I used a chopped peach for center filling but couldn't taste it much, decreased sugar and used both white and brown. I would try for more flavor if making this again, a little bland. Have yet to make an icing so that will help.

This is the best coffee cake I've ever made.  I did substitute brown sugar for the white sugar in the streusel only.  I used white sugar in the cake itself.  Very moist & delicious.  Worthy of Christmas morning with a cup of Christmas coffee!   Or Easter brunch in the Spring.  Make it.  You won't regret it.

Loved this cake!  Great texture...not too sweet.  Will definitely make again but I think I'll try it with a raspberry jam swirl through the center and skip the cinnamon/nuts just for something different.

I used this recipe because I couldnâ€™t find the recipe I usually use.  The cake actually collapsed when it came out of the pan. I think the sour cream could be cut back. The only change I made was using brown sugar and 3/4 cups of pecans for the topping. Everyone loved the cake.....The collapsing did nothing to harm the flavor.

3.17.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228422/sour-cream-coffee-cake/ ... Pretty disappointed.  'Not very attractive & greasy tasting.  Maybe the fullfat sour cream is to blame.  It also didn't fill the pan.  Similar to Sour Cream Coffeecake I, which uses less sour cream & more sugar.  'Haven't tried that, but I"m pairing them together with a "no repeat" stamp.

I make this every Christmas morning and for special occasions. It's moist and yummy with the added fun of spice and crunch from the cinnamon and walnut topping. One of my family's favorites.
