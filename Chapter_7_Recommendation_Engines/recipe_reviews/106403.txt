This recipe is wonderful. I baked it in a loaf pan, baked it for 60 minutes, and it turned out perfect. It was tender, moist and with a very intense banana flavor.

I wish I could rate the cake and the frosting seperately. Great cake (4/5) frosting (2/5). Overall 3/5. I think the problem here is that the cream cheese lengthens the sensation of sweetness... which unfortunately highlights the lingering Splenda aftertaste.

Banana bar part was ok, but the frosting had sort of a sweetness delay. All I could taste at first was buttery cream cheese.

These were my first Splenda baking effort. I omitted the banana extract in favor of vanilla.  I also left off the icing - it was nasty.

The banana bars by themselves were great and my daughter (21 mos) loved them.

This was very good, but not as good as the A-number-1 Banana Cake on this site. I used Xylitol instead of Splenda and it tasted great in both cake and frosting. It natural and has a much more pleasant taste than sucralose.

A little dense, but still very good.

Cake was very moist and had a gentle banana flavor.  The icing complimented the taste, yet did have a strong tart flavor.

The banana cake is good, moist texture and a sweet banana flavor.  I wasn't fond of the frosting though, wasn't very sweet and had a tart aftertaste that didn't blend well with the more mellow bananna.  Mabey something with a bit less of an edge might do better.
