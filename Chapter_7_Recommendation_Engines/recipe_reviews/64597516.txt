Maybe I'm bias but I'm not sure the point of canning since it doesn't last very long
I wrote this recipe as I had boxes and boxed of tomatoes
Stewed tomatoes done ... salsa done ... diced tomatoes ... done
Is it possible to make and can spaghetti sauce?
I couldn't find a recipe
I know about acidity levels from all the other canning I've done, I had to figure out how to balance the flavours
SO .. I did .. and I wrote a recipe

I hope you all enjoy
