This soup is addictive on a hot summer day.  Have made it a few times, and instead of seedless cucumbers I use regular ones which I deseed (split them down the middle & scoop out seeds with spoon).  I like spicy food but this is better with only 1 clove of garlic to bring out the slightly sweet taste.

This recipe has a great flavor, but the first time I made it with my overabundance of large cucumbers, seeds removed. I grated them and then pureed the soup as directed. The flavor was great, but the texture was coarse. Next time I'll make it with the smaller cukes.

i really enjoyed the soup and will make again when i need to use up some cukes!  hubby didn't like it so much so i'll be making it just for me which is why i only gave 4 stars.  would love to try the avocado next time or a dollop of sour cream.  won't bother grating the cuke or mixing it in a bowl next time - just dump all ingredients into the blender for less cleanup!

Not bad. Added freshly ground pepper and a pinch of cayenne to give it a kick. Served with baguette and fruit. Great and simple dinner for the summer.

I love this soup!  It's easy to modify but great as is.  I sometimes add celery, avocado and a tablespoon or 2 of ranch dressing.  I also like 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle seasoning in it as well.  I've made this almost weekly for months so it's safe to say, it's now a 'staple' in my diet!

Tastes amazing, especially on a hot day.  I used plain yogurt with fat.  Makes for a more filling dinner.  I didn't add the raisins.  I used my immersion blender.  For company, I would probably put very thin slices of cucumber on top of each serving.

This was good! I liked it, and I may make it again, but there was no "Wow" factor. I found it refreshing, but it was missing something. Maybe if I'd let the flavors develop instead of eating it right away?

I made this soup after trying a version at a local restaurant.  It is delicious and refreshing.  I used fresh mint and dill (which makes the flavor, I think.)  I also added cayenne pepper for an extra kick.  I do think this recipe could use something additional to round out the flavor, maybe something sweet, but I am not sure what.  The version I had the other day may have been garnished with feta.  I think I will add the avocado next time to thicken it out a little bit.  This is a great, healthy summer soup to try!

Delicious!  Since the cukes are going in the blender anyway I didn't bother grating them; I just chopped them up and the blender did the rest.  Next time I might garnish the soup with some sour cream for some extra fatty goodness.

This is a wonderful refreshing soup. Easy to make and easy to find ingredients. I substituted 3 green onions for the garlic because it does not agree with my tummy and added 3 tablespoons of sour cream. Very yummy.

I tasted Cucumber Yogurt Soup the first time this year and finally got around to trying to copy the delicious flavor!  I used 2 large cukes, seeded, deleted the mint because I'm not fond of the flavor in some foods and didn't use the raisins.  Didn't grate the cukes, but used the highest speed on my 16 speed blender and it was creamy smooth.  Absolute perfection.  I may add just a dash of freshly ground pepper at the table...am eagerly awaiting supper time!  Bravo!

Delicious. Used two large English cucumbers instead of 4 small ones, and only one clove of garlic. Gazpacho is my summer staple but this chilled soup will likely take over!

I don't know, I really wanted to like this soup, but it just didn't do it for me.  Maybe it would be good as a topping/dip like a tzatziki sauce.

This was sort of okay.  I was looking for a recipe to replicate one I had in a restaurant that included peaches.  Unfortunately the peaches I added didn't have a whole lot of flavor of their own, so didn't add the expected sweetness. I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried dill, and I'm not sure I added enough mint. Next time I would go heavier on the fresh herbs.  Also, I would leave out the salt and add more lemon.

This recipe is quick and easy to make and delicious.  It was extremely refreshing on a hot August evening served with falafel balls.  We will definitely make this again and try adding the avocados next time.

This is so good.  I put two avacadoes in,big bunch of mint and whatever bunch the store had for the dill.  Used no fat plain greek yogurt and topped with feta cheese crumbles.  I had lemon cuces and white cuces in the garden so used those.  Needs the salt, bland without it.  Will make this again.

I make this all the time in the summer.  We LOVE it.  The recipe can be altered a bit based on what you have on hand.  I don't usually use the lemon juice, olive oil, or the mint.  I only had one container of yogurt one time, so I used half sour cream, and it was so yummy that now I make it that way regularly.  It gives it just a bit of added richness which is good when you are having just this for dinner.  After it comes out of the blender, I add a little bit of cucumber minced into very small pieces to give it some texture.  YUM.

I have to say this was my first go at cucumber soup, so I followed the recipe exactly.  Perhaps with sour cream instead of yogurt it might be passable.

I used 5 small cubes from the garden.  I also added another clove of garlic.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt & that made it perfect.  I served it with scape pesto on 5-grain bread.  Perfect summer meal.

i love this recipe - its my go-to dinner when the temp hits sizzle.  i serve it with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of olive oil and chopped walnuts for texture. I also like the suggestion of a bit of cayenne pepper - i will try that next time. I use yoplait 1.5% yogurt to keep the calories down as much as possible. Instead of sour cream, creme fraiche or white cheese ("ski 5%"- i live in Israel) is also great.

I had an over abundance of large cucumbers.  I peeled & cut them but did NOT deseed them.  I used low fat plain yogurt,  I had fresh mint, fresh dill, fresh lemons & garlic.  I put some of the cukes in a large bowl with some yogurt, lemon juice & garlic & then used an immersion blender.  I gradually added more cukes, yogurt etc.  I didn't chop the mint or the dill, they were the last thing I added to the bowl.  Since I made a HUGE batch, after having 1 bowl, I put some in a jar in the refrigerator & then filled 2 freezer bags & laid it flat in the freezer.  During the week I took a bag out & left it in the refrigerator to defrost.  I had to give it a little stir in the bowl but it was YUMMY!!!  I didn't add any salt or pepper until I served & one service I did add dried pepper flakes so it was spicy & cool.  I'll  be making this again as it was so easy.

Very tasty and a good base. I like to add a small serrano or jalepeno to mine or a dash or two of hot sauce. I had a lot of dried mint and dill so i used healthy portions of those in place of fresh. After chilling a while,it's still delicious and even better the next day. Like some of the other reviews, I also add sour cream or even butter milk, depending on what is already handy in my kitchen.

I make alot of Indian and Mediterranean food and this soup is the PERFECT accompaniment to these dishes! I made it without the mint ( because I don't like mint), and fabulous is not good enough of a word to describe this! This soup is light, refreshing, healthy, and most important...YUMTASTIC! I make mine the day before so the flavors have time to marry. This is one of my favorite recipes!

I made this with regular cucumbers that I peeled and deseeded. I didn't add raisins. I garnished with feta cheese and tomatos. Everyone at the potluck really liked it. I lived another way to use the bounty of my garden. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it so much. So much. Left out the mint since I didn't have any and it was delicious.  Will try it with mint and with cayenne and fresh pepper like others suggested.

We all ate and enjoyed this soup - but I made a few modifications. I used 4 large regular cucumbers which I split and seeded. I chopped them and placed them in the food processor with fresh lemon juice, fresh mint and 3 tsp of dehydrated dill. I added 2 cups of lowfat greek yogurt and 1 heaping tsp of crushed garlic.  I also used 3/4 tsp of salt and accidentally omitted the olive oil. I pulsed the food processor until the mixture was smooth. And Voila!

Made this in July with an over abundance of cukes, it was awesome.  Froze a container without the yogurt added.  Forgot about it.  Searching my freezer for something on a snowy sub-zero February night & figured what the heck.  Defrosted, added the yogurt, a little more lemon & some green onion and it's almost July again!

The result didn't look anything like the picture (mine actually looked ten times better!!). I found no reason whatsoever to get seedless cucumbers as you grate them anyway, and the seeds don't grate with the cucumber. I used regular ones and it tasted great. To add a bit of sweetness, I used French Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt and it was delicious. Thanks a billion, it was extremely filling as well!

I enjoyed this a lot!  I did use about 6 small Persian cucumbers (and cut the seeds out), as they add quite a bit of sweetness.  I used plenty of dill and extra lemon.  Next time, I will omit the mint leaves, as they seemed unnecessary.  This soup became more flavorful 24 hours later.

This is outstanding, but you HAVE to let the flavors develop, I don't recommend serving immediately. I tasted it right after blending and thought "what's so dang special?" Then I came home 4 hours later and it was amazing. Very refreshing one a hot summer night. One note: the raw garlic really screams though, which I love, but use a bit less if you don't care for garlicy food. Only adjustment I make now is to add green onions.

I did not care for this recipe. Tried to modify it to make it better but just wasn't good!
