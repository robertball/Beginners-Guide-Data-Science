These were absolutly the best Peanut Butter Cookies I have ever made.  My husband and 2 year old son can't get enough.  They really are nice and chewy.  I did add another 1/2 cup of peanut butter because many of the reviews recommended that.  I think they have a very good peanut butter flavor.  I have made many cookies in my life and I am always looking for cookies that will actually stay soft after they have cooled.  My search is over, this is the recipe I will stick with from now on.

These cookies were awesome. I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, as suggested, and put in about a cup of chocolate chips. Thanks....

These cookies were great!!  I also doubled the peanut butter and added a 1/4 cup flour to the original one cup.  They turned out beautifully, looked like I bought them from a bakery.  They taste great too!  Thanks for the keeper recipe!

When making these cookies, I followed recommendations of previous reviewers by adding 1/2 c. peanut butter and increasing flour to 1-1/2 cups.  I also chilled for a bit and then shaped into balls and pressed w/fork before putting in the oven.  Cooked for 10 minutes, and they came out good.  Very easy and taste great!

Pretty good cookies,as for the negative comments either thier hardware is broken  or somebody forgot how to bae ;) I dont like that much peanut butter flavor on my cookies so half a cup is perfect. 15 to 17 minutes in the oven is required or untill you see the edges of the cookies lightly brown. If you take them out earlier the middle might be raw.

-*-I heard wonderful compliments for this recipe but they were quite disgusting. They lost the peanut butter flavor and really tasted like mush. Some of them fell apart. I followed the recipe 100% and  it didnt come out good. I dont recommend these at all!!! Hope this helps! -*-

I made these cookies today with my boyfriend and added an extra half-cup of peanut butter and an extra quarter-cup of flour. They are amazing! He took some to his bosses and they loved them! Would definitely reccomend for anyone looking for good cookies. They only need to be cooked until the edges of the cookies start turning slightly golden or they'll be overdone. They even stay soft after they cool!

These were great and very easy! I also used one cup peanut butter. I also alternated batches- one plain, one rolled in sugar and cinnamon, one rolled in crushed pecans. Yum.
When I first went to take them out of the oven after 10 min.  I didn't think they were done- but they were!

An excellent cookie, especially with a little extra peanut butter.  Also, you can substitute 1 cup of Splenda for the sugar and your Diabetic friends will love you forever. :)

Great Peanut Butter cookie! Better than others I've tried. I used Jiff Reduced Fat peanut butter. I cooked mine until light golden brown (about 12 minutes). They were soft and falling apart on the bottom in the middle (which made them hard to get off the sheet), but they hardned up after they cooled. Better the next day after stored overnight in a sealed container.

LOVE these cookies! First peanut butter cookies I've had that are moist and soft. I also used twice as much peanut butter and added 1/4 cup flour, also I used crunchy peanut butter. VERY good!

After reading several other reviews I knew this recipe needed some extras.  I added 1/4 c extra flour, 1/2 c extra peanut butter (I used natural peanut butter to reduce sweetness). I also decided to roll into balls for more uniform baking and do the "criss cross" sugar method with a fork prior to baking.  I  did not get 36 cookies.  My recipe made about 24, 1 1/2" cookies.  These cookies did come out soft and stayed that way.  However, they did lack a good peanut butter flavor (that may have been due to my using the natural peanut butter).

These were okay.  I choose this recipe b/c I didn't have any brown sugar.  I added more peanut butter/flour as some others suggested, but I think that made them a little greasy.  They tasted good, but the texture wasn't right, and they were really fragile.  I also had to bake them a lot longer, and my oven usually cooks faster.

If I hadnt read the reviews and adjusted accordingly (extra 1/2 c. PB, sprinkle cinammon, extra flour), they wouldntve come out as good as they did. Good and easy.

These were very good and very simple to make.  As suggested I added twice as much pb as the recipe suggested.  I made these last week and will make them again this weekend.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I was in the mood for cookies and this recipe had just a few ingredients. I replaced the margarine with butter and had to bake them for 20 minutes, not sure why. On the third batch I raised the temp a bit and it helped. I like a crispy cookie so the higher temp worked better for me. This is a keeper.

This was a great recipe.  I found the cookies sorta under cooked at the recommended time so the second time I used this recipe I used parchment paper so I could cook them a little longer without burning the bottoms.  The recipe doesn't yield a lot.. or maybe they were so popular they just went faster than normal.  I also used one cup of peanut butter and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  I also discovered a few turns on my sea salt grinder made much yummier cookies than regular table salt (i was out of regular salt at the time).

Fantastic! I added chocolate chips to 1/2 for a change, everyone loved this recipe for  the taste and  texture. Pull them from the oven before you think they are done (shouldn't be browned)for perfection!

This recipe is awesome!  I too doubled the peanut butter and added 1/4 cup more flour.  I cooled the dough so that I could roll it into balls. I then rolled it in sugar and pressed it with a potato masher. They turned out wonderful! Very soft.

I luvv this recipe! I am a teenager, and I have already made this recipe 3 times for my family and friends for the past several weeks! It is simple to make in just a short amount of time! It is also a great snack if my blood sugar is going too low, because of all the sports I do (it just perks me right up!). I however used the 1 cup of peanut butter, because thats what some of the suggestions said. This is an awesome recipe! Happy Holidays!

i've had such a hard time finding a good recipe for soft peanut butter cookies!  but i think i'll end my search with this one.  these were really easy to make and did stay soft, even once cool.  i did add nearly 1/2 cup extra peanut butter and can't imagine that they'd be too tasty without it.

I have tried several recipes on this site and was never as happy as I was with this one.  I added a bit more peanut butter and followed the rest of the recipe to the T.  They were real buttery and chewy.  Thank you for posting this recipe - these are the absolute BEST cookies!

Added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and baked nine minutes..perfect cookies, a little crunchy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. Nice peanut butter taste that isn't overpowering.  Will make again :) Thanks June

This was my first batch of PB cookies I ever made and they were awesome! I did increase PB from 1/2 cup to 1 cup as suggested and they were SOOOO good. I can't wait to try 'em with choc chips or crunchy PB. Thanks June!

maybe i did something wrong, but i didn't like these cookies-there wasn't much taste-they came out very soft(which is good) but even though i added extra peanut butter they seemed a little bland.

Just finished baking these cookies! They
definitely ROCK! I love them. I even added 1/2 cup more peanut butter than the recipe called for,and they still ROCKED! You don't even have to fork press them. Thanks June! (whomever you are)

I made this today. It was very good. I used 1 cup of flour and added 1/2 cup peanut butter. I also omitted baking powder but they turned out quite good. The baking time was around 15 minutes per batch though.

This is an outstanding recipe.  One thing though, if you live in high altitude add an extra 1/2 cup flour.  Keep an eye on them when they are baking and let them cool a bit on the cookie sheet before removing them so they don't fall apart which is what I expect happened to CheerlChick88's cookies.

These were delicious. I did change two things. I changed the sugar to 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar and I did follow the other reviewers' advice and did 1 c. of peanut butter. My daughter loved these and they were really nice and soft cookies.

I'm pretty new baking in my home, but I got to admit these were the easiest tastiest Peanut Butter cookies I've ever made. I also doubled the peanut butter as others have mentioned. On the second batch of cookies, I ran out of Vanilla extract so I used Pure Almond extract, the taste was slighty different but just as tasty. If a novice like me can make these cookies taste good, then anyone can :)

Good Recipe and simple.  Just getting back into baking.  I followed the recommendation to use 1 c pb and I don't use regular flour anymore so I used spelt.  No one was able to tell the difference!  I will definitely use this recipe again for quick and easy pb cookies!

Wow! These were truly amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, but i whipped the batter for fluffiness. And right when they came out of the oven i sprinkled some white sugar on top for an extra pizazz. I made nine of those, and kept the extra batter. With the extra batter, i simply added milk choclate chips and oatmeal. Those turned out to be delicous!

They were super easy to make and just like everyone else suggested I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. They do stay really soft but I'm not sure whether I like that or not. They are almost too soft. I like a little bit of crispness. I added mini chocolate chips. But overall, good cookie.

Just made these for my 2 year old and me. I knew I had minimal ingredients in the cupboard, so this was perfect because they are basic staples! I was weary about how they would taste but they are AWESOME! I'm saving this recipe and going to grab another cookie! YUM! Thanks!

My changes/additions: Extra 1/2c of pb and 1/3c flour (as suggested by other reviewers), half of medium sized bag of M&Ms, chocolate drizzle to finished cookie (for added pretty factor). Extra baking time to account for extra pb, 5 or so minutes per batch.  Review: Even with the extra pb, there wasn't as much peanut flavor as I expected, but that might have just been from the chocolate addition. However they were still chewy and great in texture. My rounded spoonfuls only yielded 24 cookies, not the 36 as the site says. Next time I will have to make a double batch!

I think it was okay also. I also did not have any brown sugar and that is why I choose this recipe. The cookies were very very soft. I had to cook them a little longer. I also like the way fork imprint looks on peanut butter cookies, so I also added that.

I am SO glad I was out of baking soda and had to find an alternative recipe!  I tried the recipe as submitted and using the suggested increase in peanut butter recommended by other users.  I actually prefer the original but both ways are fabulous!  And it's the absolute simplest cookie recipe I've ever used!  Only thing easier would be cookies from a log :O)  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

The reason this recipe was not spectacular was my own fault. We have no peanut butter in my house because my sister is allergic, so we used soy nut butter and they were simply disgusting. Next time, I'll try this recipe with real peanut butter.

I just made these cookies exactly like the recipes says...while they were baking I ready the reviews.  I'm not sure what everyone is talking about when they say "needs more peanut butter."  I tried one and thought they were wonderful!  I hope hubby likes them since they are for his birthday.

This cookie was just what it promised... very soft and chewy.  I did adjust the recipe a bit, I substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar and I added 1/4 cup flour.  The first batch didn't spread and I pressed down the rest with a fork, and they turned out better that way.  Very good cookie, but needs just a bit more peanut butter flavour.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I didn't add extra peanut butter as most did, and they turned out quite bland. They're still good, and I'm sure they'd be even better if they had more peanut butter.

This is yummy!  I also doubled the peanut butter, put in 1 c. instead of only 1/2.  Use crunchy peanut butter, it makes it even better.  Good soft and chewy cookie.

Great cookies!  My kids LOVED THEM...and they are super picky about cookies.  I took the advice of others and added about 1/2 cup of additional peanut butter.  Next time I might freeze them for a while, roll in sugar, and flatten before baking. Really tasty though!  And easy! My 3 year old loved making them with me!

I was looking for a quick easy peanut butter cookie recipe when i ran across this one. It doesnt call for very many ingredients and they travel well.
I wanted the cookies to take on a trip for snacks and they did wonderfully.

These are the best! I'm definitely going to make them again. Soft but not chewy, peanut butter flavor is good but not overpowering. I added agave because these are snacks, but the flavor is very noticeable so I might use honey next time, depends on what the family thinks. I also added 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum because I made them gluten free. You just have to be careful that the centres are done all the way.

meh...
doubled the pb and added an extra 1/3 c flour per reviewer recs and the result was a crumbly dough i had to knead by hand to mix completely.  baked at 400 F until edges brown.  tops and edges were crispy but bottoms were borderline uncooked so i literally flipped them over and threw them back in the still hot oven to cook them through.  final result was a mildly sweet subtle pb flavor.   
not bad, but i'm still looking for a favorite go-to pb cookie recipe...

Since I made mine with natural peanut butter, and it was a little runny, I decided to chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking. The cookies came out perfectly. Nice and chewy, with a little crispness around the edges.

They definitely needed more peanut butter, 1/2 was not enough, and it seemed like it had too much margarine.
They tasted okay, but they weren't really peanut buttery.

Ok these are the first cookies I have ever made from scratch and they came out AMAZING! They were all gone within about 45 minutes, and my husband and kids were asking for more! The recipe is super simple to follow with an accurate amount of ingredients, and even after complete cooling they stay soft and tasty! Great recipe!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe. The cookies were so soft and they stayed soft! I used 1 cup of peanut butter and I melted the margarine before puring it in the bowl and using the mixer. It will look little too liquety but don't add anything! Once it bakes it will look and taste perfect. Oh and don't bake over than 10 minutes. It would ruin it completely.

So tasty!! Definitely put that extra flour in there, the first batch was so runny and came out looking more like pancakes than cookies! (still tasty tho!) I didn't put the extra peanut butter (more peanut butter = more calories and fat!) but I thought it was perfect. More peanut butter would be too much for me!

This recipe is O-K-A-Y. It may appeal to other types of taste buds, but not really my own. If you plan to make this recipe, consider the recommedations given by other reviewers for additions to the recipe. As it stands, the recipe doesn't have a long enough baking time and the flavor leaves a weird after taste; perhaps it is the egg?  I followed this recipe exactly and pulled the cookies out after 10 minutes even though they didn't look done, because other reviewers encouraged pulling them out regardless. After cooling, the centers of my first batch were very mushy and uncooked. I accidentally left the second batch in for several minutes longer, and they turned out much better; still soft and yet thoroughly cooked.  I would add more peanut butter and flour as the others suggested...to make this to my own personal taste----but who says I should modify this recipe to fit my taste? I can find another that nails down what I am looking for. Don't be discouraged to try this one! It may be your favorite!

Delicious cookie recipe, these are soft and I followed with just the 1/2 c. peanut butter - and they came out tasting very "peanut-buttery" to me.  The only adjustments I made were: I added 1/4 c. more flour in the recipe & cooked for 13 minutes on 350 (8-10 just wasn't long enough in my oven). GREAT cookies overall.  *Also* - this recipe did not "Yield=36" as stated, it only made 26 total for me, & they weren't that big.  Next time I will double the recipe.

I really liked how moist these were! I didn't have brown sugar so I tried this one. I used a full cup of peanut butter, added a 1/4 cup of flour and 1/3 of a cup of chocolate chips.
They aren't lasting very long around here! Very Yummy.

This is really a very nice, soft cookie. I usually make and like harder peanut butter cookies, but this was a good change. We did add about a 1/2 cup more flour though. And we put some nutella between 2 layers of the cookie dough, so it took a little longer to bake, but a lovely combination.

Great peanut butter cookies, made a few changes to the recipe. Very chewy and crumbly, but very good nonetheless. I added 1 Tablespoon of Cocoa, a sprinkle of cinamon, about a 1/4 cup more flour, 1/4 cup more peanut butter. It turned out great all the same, my only complaint is they had to be baked for a longer period of time, about 13 minutes for mine, at 350 F and my oven runs quite hot.

These cookies were more like little muffins. They weren't as dense as a cookie. Not much peanut butter flavor either. We put icing on them so they weren't so bland.

These cookies were pretty good - soft in the middle, but a little crispy on the edges.  They were pretty flat and a pale color, but had a good flavor.

These needed just a little more peanut butter taste, But what was lacking was more then made up by the ease of the recipe. I needed 300 cookies for a catering job, they were quick to make and all went.

So Perfect! I added the extra 1/2cup of PB and they were the best I have tasted (better then my Moms too!) I also tried them using whole wheat flour and I found they were even better then when using white! Excellent!

These weren't so great - very bland. I used an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I wonder if the kind of peanutbutter you use makes a difference? I used the natural type - bet they are better with jif or skippy.

I didnt' read the other reviews prior to making, and followed the recipe exactly. They came out soft, but very flat. I liked that the peanut butter taste wasn't overwhelming because I added peanut butter and milk chocolate chips to it.

WOW, loved this cookie.  Although it wasn't QUITE as peanut butter-y as I usually like, the texture and overall taste more than made up for this.  I'll try adding another 1/2 cup of PB next time.

This was a great cookie recipe. I took the suggestion of the other reviewers and added one cup of peanut butter instead of just 1/2. I also added some Reese's peanut butter chips. They came out awesome.

yum! i put a cup of peanut butter in (instead of a half cup) and i chilled the dough in the fridge for about 15 minutes before rolling it up into balls and then rolling in sugar. i think i baked them a bit too long because the cookies were crumbly... but they were still chewy so it was ok... i went back for more! =P

I really liked these cookies, but they tasted a lot more like butterscotch than peanut butter to me.

Don't know why, but, when I made these, they turned out thin and crisp once completely cooled...and they melted in your mouth.  I did add a little more peanut butter.

I loved this recipe because I wanted to make some peanut butter cookies, but realized I didn't have any brown sugar on hand.  The cookies were superb and hit the spot!

I found these to be a bit too squishy, not chewy. If you can get past the gooey texture, the taste is pretty good. Okay if you have a "need it now" situation.

Good flavor, soft but not chewy. The consistancy reminded me of Bisquick sugar cookies, we'll probably finish these but I won't make them again.

Great recipe if you like squishy peanut butter cookies.  I added more peanut butter and used half brown sugar and half while sugar.  Very easy and quick to bake.

Soft and chewy cookie.  

Works really good with crunchy peanut butter.  

Needs a little extra peanut butter and sugar for me.
