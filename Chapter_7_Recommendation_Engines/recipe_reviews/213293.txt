I didn't follow this directly.  Substituted sour cream for the yogurt and added sundried tomatoes and chicken.  Needs more pepper too.  Really filling, especially if you use whole wheat pasta.

I added more tomato and just a pinch of sea salt.  Really fast and really good.

We really enjoyed this recipe! We improvised with and added some zucchini from our garden, which made it all the more yummy!

This was a hit with the family, even though I didn't have any yogurt.  Next time I will add diced cooked chicken.  I tried the other reviewers suggestion of sundried tomatoes and zucchini, was good.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

This was a good base to build upon. Instead of cream of celery, I added a package of hidden valley ranch mix, paresan, and chicken stock to a pound of ground chicken.  Then added 4 tablespoons of spicy tomato & basil pasta sauce.  Used broccoli that I chopped up instead of spinach and seasoned with tony chachere's instead of sea salt and a tablespoon of cajun foreplay (a type of chili powder). It was a hit! I will definitely be making this again.

I've made this several times and found that adding a tablespoon of garlic and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning improves the flavor.

This recipe was kinda blah for me. It was missing something, although I couldn't tell what. . .If I make it again, I will definitely be experimenting.
