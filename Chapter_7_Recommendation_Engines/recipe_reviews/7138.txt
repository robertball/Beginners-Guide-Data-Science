I had lost my favorite roll recipe and decided to try these...oh my goodness this is a keeper!  I have this one saved.  They turned out like a picture...and so fluffy and light but yet rich buttery flavor.  They were not at all heavy...feathery light.  The only modifications I made were I heated my water 105-115degrees and added butter flavor shortening to that.  I added it to the dry yeast, sugar, and 2 cups of flour.  I then added all but the last half cup of flour blended with the salt.  I had always been taught that salt can kill yeast if added directly so I never add salt until I have added some of the flour first.  I use the last half cup of flour to knead into the yeast adding a little at a time because all flours differ.  I only use bread flour with my bread making.  By heating the liquid to between 105-115, it cut down on the kneading time tremendously...cut it in half.  After the rolls came out of the oven, I immediately brushed the tops with butter using a pastry brush.  They came out of the pan with ease(I use cooking spray to coat bottom and sides of pan) and everyone raved about them.

These are GREAT!!!  I used butter instead of shortening...they are the BEST!!!! The whole family is requesting these rolls at every meal...a tip...I use 1/3 and freeze the dough in ziploc bags(2 bags with 1/3 each)...the next 2 nights I thaw the bread for 2-2-1/2 hours form into rolls and allow to rise the second time.  That way we get fresh rolls for 3 nights with one batch!!  Each batch is as good as the first.

My first attempt with this recipe wasn't all that great, but my second attempt...WOW!  I made my rolls a little bigger so I yielded 18 rolls instead of the 24 stated in the recipe.  I used butter flavored shortening, and melted it first in a saucepan, then added the cold water to it.  That made the water/shortening mixture the perfect temperature for the flour mixture.  The 18 rolls turned out large and fluffy, with a great taste that didn't need any extra butter on top.  My older daughter ate 3 of these large rolls and almost ignored the rest of the dinner!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water (I didn't use cold water, yeast works better with warm water) and sugar for ten minutes, then I added the melted butter (which I used instead of shortening) and all the dry ingredients. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or so. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll), covered them with saran wrap and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was just right for me. Decent dinner roll. NOTE: When you make this roll recipe--don't follow the instructions on letting it rise. Use warm water. Using cold water may work for others but it's never worked for me. It'll save you some wasted ingredients in the end.

What did I do wrong?  The taste of these dinners rolls was pretty good, but they were dense--not light and fluffy like grandma used to make.  I kneaded the dough for twenty minutes--I even timed it out.  Did I use the wrong kind of yeast?  What?  Again, these were absolutely delicious, but something went wrong.  The yeast must have been fresh.  It wasn't in the cupboard for a long time; I just bought it at the store the day I made the rolls.  I'm an inexperienced baker, so the outcome was probably my fault--but I don't know what I did wrong.

Oh, this is really good. Made it once with wholewheat flour and it was still very light and tasty. If you use veggie oil instead of butter - this becomes a vegan recipe.

VERY good!!!! I just added all the ingredients into my bread machine and ran the dough cycle. Then I shaped them into balls & put half on a cookie sheet and the other half in a spring form pan. Then I preheated the oven to 200, turned the oven off & put the rolls in the oven for their 45 minutes proofing. After that, I preheated to 400 and kept to regular directions. The ones in the spring form were even better we thought. Love this recipe.

This recipe isn't bad, but not memorable.  My family ate them, but didn't rave.  Baking at 400 was a little too hot and made the tops very dark while the middle rolls were still gooey on the inside.

I made these the other day and they turned out light and fluffy, and tasted so delicious! They went well with the sloppy joes I made. I only made half the recipe and shaped them into 8 rolls. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. The dough is very lovely to work with. Very soft and elastic-y. If you decide to proof the yeast, then skip the kneading for 20 minutes alltogether. The long kneading breaks down/dissolves the yeast, as heat is transfered from your hands to the dough. That's what makes this recipe so unique. If you had problems with rising, then check the expiry date on the yeast package. If it's expired then don't use it. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Maria! I'm glad to have learned a new technique for making rolls. I will definitely be making these rolls again!

What a bummer! The photos of this recipe look great, but following the directions and recipe exactly how it is written left me with non-fluffy, non-rising bread. I was skeptical adding cold water and not proofing the yeast in warm water and sugar first as most recipes require. I am not a pro bread maker, but I have made it enough so I am puzzled by this recipe's directions. :( The taste was good. :)

Made exactly as recipe states these rolls are light and airy.  Lovely golden brown tops.  Definitely will be my go-to for dinner rolls.  Will be using another reviewers idea for wheat rolls as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Love these. We did have to try three times before they turned out right. You have to proof the yeast in 105* water with a bit of sugar till it foams. When they did finally work it there wonderful. Making them tonight for thanksgiving tomorrow. Warm up great in the oven and my fiance even made chicken sandwiches with them. This time useing honey instead of sugar cant wait.

This is a great recipe and deserves five stars with the exception of the directions. I, like some of the others, proofed the yeast first, and in warm water with a tablespoon of the recommended sugar first. Other than that, the rolls came out great !! Wonderful job, Maria !  :)

These were amazing! I sub'd Earth Balance for the shortening and used organic sugar. They were an incredible addition to our vegan thanksgiving! Also, I let my bread machine handle the kneading/rising process since I was busy making other dishes that day. It worked like a dream!

I was going to only give this recipe a rating of three stars, but the taste is fantastic! It's taste is similar to the rolls at Texas Road House or an excellent quality store-brought rolls.  Characteristics: An Very soft and very thin crust. Extremely soft interior. Negatives:  I use the "scoop and level" method for measuring flour in a recipe. I DO NOT IN ANY  WAY PACK THE FLOUR. I found this dough extremely hard to knead. The remedy I used for this problem was a 15 minute "rest period" and an extra 3 tablespoons of water. Then I kneaded it for 8 minutes.  I baked this dough for 13 minutes and it was perfect. I love these rolls

Turned out perfectly.  Used warm water as it just makes sense. I also subbed softened butter for the shortening. Brushed the tops with melted butter before baking. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Made 15 nice sized rolls.

Activated the yeast in 1/2 cup of 106 degree water & 1 teaspoon of sugar for 10 minutes. Meanwhile I melted the Crisco and stirred the sugar into it. All the sugar did not melt but that was fine. Warmed up the remaining 1 cup of water to 106. Stirred all into the dry ingr, then put the yeast mixture in last. Used my hand mixer with dough hooks for 6 minutes. 1 hour later it had risen well! Half the batch went on a sheet pan. The rest went into a muffin pan. I liked the muffin pan the best. It was uniformly brown while the sheet produced browner harder bottoms. This would make perfect bread sticks!

I halved the recipe and subbed in butter for the shortening.  I made three long rolls for meatball subs.  The rolls were very good and deliciously soft.  They didn't fall apart with the meatballs, sauce, and cheese on them, although we ate our sandwiches right away.  Yum!

Sorry, but this recipe was a disappointment. I have a couple of very fine roll recipes and I have been using them for years, but on a whim, I decided to try this one. First of all, why does it ask you to add cold water to the flour and yeast mixture? Unless you were to place the bowl in a very warm place, the yeast cannot do what it needs to do in 1 hour. But, I followed the instructions.  Also, 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt is too much for that amount of flour. (in my opinion).  After shaping them into rolls and letting them rise for 45 minutes, I baked them as instructed hoping they would rise more once they where put into the oven. They didn't.  The texture was course and even though I use bread flour, the color wasn't creamy.  I will slice and make croutons of them.

Tried it for the first time on Christmas Eve. They turned out perfect! Easiest recipe for rolls that I have tried, reminds me of my grandmother's when I was a kid. I would not change a thing.

Hi, it's me again! Okay, I think I found out what the problem is with this recipe.  The ingredients list calls for active dry yeast(which they state has to be mixed with liquid first to activate and then you can add to recipe).  but in the directions it states mix in INSTANT YEAST with the dry stuff, which you cannot really do with active dry yeast if you want it to proof right.  I happened to look at the recipe again, trying to figure out what went wrong(even though it tasted like a delicious soft pretzel and not a yeast roll - so I will still do it the other way too!)and I noticed this.  So, I am going to get some instant yeast, and try again and see if it comes out differently and then I'll be back to review.  Again.

They were good. I quartered the recipe since I was just cooking for my small family and forgot that I should prolly watch the cooking time a little more closely so mine ended up a little over done. I also proofed my yeast with the sugar and warm water before adding it to the remaining ingredients which cuts down on the kneading time... cuz we all know how we would love to extend the time we knead... lol well anyways the flavors were there and I will most likely use this recipe in the future!

Perfect! Made them exactly as the recipe instructs and all 24 of them were gone in one night! They were eaten by everyone as snacks and we had them with homemade spaghetti...they probably would have eaten them for breakfast if there had been any left!

These were good, but mine didn't really rise... probably because my kitchen was too cold.  I'll try again.... I did like the flavor but I think they were too dense (again, probably because they didn't rise).

Really didn't do anything for me.  I needed a quick and fairly easy recipe to make for Christmas Eve dinner and these seemed to fit the bill but they really weren't anything spectacular.  I probably won't make them again.

These we so delicious! The Boyfriend loved them so much that he requested that these be the new staple roll recipe around the house. The only alteration I did was swapping the shortening for margarine and it still turned our great. Will be making these again.

Excellent!  Made these for Thanksgiving.  Was told these would do my granny proud.  A great traditional roll. Easy to make, delicious to eat. We buttered the tops when almost down baking for a golden crust.

These were great. The only change I made was I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. Have tried other roll recipes on this site and this one I will make again. They were light and fluffy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Fantastic! I warmed the water with the butter flavored shortening. I also used my bread machine on the dough setting for the kneading and rising. I got 15 rolls in a 9x13 pan.Very good.

VERY DELICIOUS!!! I was looking for a very simple roll recipe to throw together for dinner tonight and chose this one. Followed recipe as written, only substituting butter flavored crisco for the shortening. Rolls turned out perfectly browned, with a wonderful texture- very light and fluffy. Very simple recipe to follow! I used my Kitchenaid mixer for the kneading portion.

Tasty just after baking, though not quite sweet enough.  Do not recommend making full batch as these biscuits are not that great the next day.  Still a really easy recipe (heat the water by the way to approx. 110 degrees before using) that is hard to mess up.

I'm afraid there is a lot wrong with this recipe, starting with the instructions to add the dry yeast and COLD water to the dry ingredients. This should have been my first clue, but I hoped for the best.  The instructions to "Form rolls" didn't help this beginner bread maker and I had to look it up on You Tube. There were undissolved granules of yeast all through my dough, and it didn't rise very high. The end result was a heavy, dense roll, sadly. I will be looking for another roll recipe.

Made this with my kitchenaid and it was everything I wanted it to be! Took someone else’s advice and let the yeast sit in warm water for a while before mixing wet ingredients with dry ingredients in kitchenaid

Really nice soft n tasty rolls! I proofed my yeast in warm water with sugar. I used kitchen aid mixer to mix(dry ingredients n shortening) n knead (6 mins). I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water( proofing yeast) instead).  It took longer to rise for me(first proof took 1.5 hr/2nd proof 45 mins). I baked it for 12 mins  at 400c. nice brown tops n soft fluffy rolls all the way thru. I did finsh them off with a brush of melted butter.

Every year our family Thanksgiving dinner is complimented by a big bag of rolls from a warehouse club.  This has got to stop, but I thought I was powerless to help, since it's out of state for us and there's no kitchen space available at our destination.  On a whim I made a batch of these and hid a few in a Ziploc bag.  Of course my husband loved them when they were fresh, but I just fed him one that was about 36 hours old....and he still loved it!   In my ideal world I would be serving rolls fresh from the oven to impress the family at Thanksgiving, but since that is impossible, I believe I am going to bake these at home and bring them along.  Friends don't let friends eat dry hard bread with a holiday meal, right?   The only slight change I made was to use warm water for my yeast instead of cool water.  And I use Butter Flavored Crisco shortening.  That's my 'secret ingredient' for a lot of my baking.   Thanks for a simple and fantastic recipe!

I was afraid The rolls would not rise after following instructions with cold water. I didn't read reviews until I had already mixed the dough. I used a stand mixer for a few minutes to knead and save me some time. (I was looking for a bread roll recipe that I could use every week without a lot of fuss.) My rolls did rise and they came out good, just not great enough to make this my recipe. I think most people used substitutions. Why are they called butter rolls if they don't have butter in the roll? -just curious. I refrigerated leftovers in a freezer bag and used them for PBJ the next day. They were okay. I followed the recipe except for using the stand mixer. 
Based on my experience making tortillas, you probably use cold water because you don't want the shortening to melt. But I'd say lukewarm is ok. I used cold. Also, mixing the salt and yeast together all at once was fine since it wasn't just sitting there, you mix everything and get started kneading. I did not proof my yeast (instant) and no problem.

Dense, doughy, and totally without flavor. Followed the directions EXACTLY. During the kneeding process the dough got stiffer and flatter and more dense - they never rose at all.

I made these exactly as written.  I knew they would take longer to rise as the recipe uses cold water so I made them first thing in the morning.  A slow rise allows the dough time to develop more flavor.  They do take a long time so plan for the first rise to take several hours.  The second rise was much faster, maybe 30 to 45 minutes.  My rolls baked up golden brown, moist, light and flaky.  Just a perfect dinner roll!  I will be using this recipe again!

Super easy, super tasty! Family loved these rolls. I paired this with a butternut squash soup and salad for a delicious dinner. Will try to make with whole wheat flour and see what happens.

I tried this recipe and found it seriously needed a milk byproduct to get it to work properly...next time try a half cup of milk with the water and use warm water for the yeast...otherwise is just doesn't rise!

Absolutely wonderful, definitely a keeper! My husband loved it so much he said it made the taste of the steak pale in comparison (and it was a filet mignon) I followed the recipe to a T, they came out with the perfect consistence, texture and flavor and are sooooo easy to make.

Tried to make these on Christmas morning b/c of all of the great reviews.  They never rose I followed the directions I've never had any problem w/ yeast breads.  And since its Christmas morning nothing is open so no bread for Christmas dinner!!  You are better off to buy frozen rolls.

I would have given this recipe a 3.5 if i could. The texture of these rolls were perfect the best i have come across on allrecipies.com, but the flavor left something to be desired. Very blah! maybe if i would have used the butter flavored crisco instead of plain it would have been better, Just a thought.

These were just okay to me, not great. Wonder why they are called "Southern Butter Rolls" when there is no butter included in the recipe?

OMG these rolls are soooo delicious and "airy"!  I've been reheating them in the microwave and they are still good.  I froze half the dough and plan on making cinnamon rolls this weekend.  Don't see why that shouldn't work out.

These were the best rolls! I used butter flavor Crisco instead of plain shortening, and created a yeast "foam" separately before combining with the dry ingredients. This recipe is definitely a keeper :)

These were my first attempt at baking with yeast. I followed a friend's advice and mixed the yeast and water together first, rather than putting it in the flour, etc. 

These turned out a little dense, which might be my fault, since I'm inexperienced with bread. And, because I had a blond moment and read two "tablespoons" rather than teaspoons for the salt, they were really salty. But that's my fault, not the recipe. I'm sure they'd taste better with someone else making them. :)

I reviewed these rolls last year when I made them for thanksgiving, but at that time I made a few changes.  This time I made them as the recipe called for and they turned out even better.  The only change I stayed with was the butter flavored shortening.  I made some into regular dinner rolls and some into hamburger buns.  next I might try a loaf of bread.  This will probably be my go to recipe for bread making.


i do use this recipe for just about everything.  ESPECIALLY hamburger buns.  just shape them into rolls about 2/3 the size of what you want your buns to be and spray with water, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and let rise for another 45 min to an hour.  I had to bake mine a little longer than the recipe called for.

Like Kiss-the-Cook, I agree that these are good but not memorable. I did some procedure adjustments per the excellent suggestions of Tunisianswife, and the texture was light and chewy inside, just not quite enough flavor for me.

This is my first time making home made bread. I did proof my yeast as others suggested. I also brushed them with melted butter seasoned with oregano, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. Yummmmy! Mine are not as pretty but, they sure are light and fluffy melt in your mouth good!

Very nice, very light, almost flaky. I used the bread machine for the mixing and resting. (As with other reviewers, I used warmed water rather than cold)  I then used unsalted butter and about 1 tsp and a half salt.  Used bread machine yeast (1 TBSP plus 1 TSP) so only required rising once they were made into buns.  Baked at 375 F for 12 minutes.   Delicious results! Thank you!

I was shocked to see that there was no butter in the recipe.  I tried it anyway and had to buy shortening because I don't cook with it.  The recipe was easy to make.  The dough was easy to work with and the rolls came out great (I think this could be a good recipe for a soft bun too).  Next time I'll try a different technique for forming the rolls .  I pulled some dough and rolled it between my palms to form each roll. 
 The finished roll wasn't as smooth and pretty as I would have liked.

I could not give it 5 stars because I changed it a little. I proofed my yeast w/ 100 degree water and a tablespoon of the sugar first, to make sure it was not dead. And I substituted butter for the shortening, just because I don't like the flavor shortening leaves in your mouth. With my adjustments they came out great, even gave some to the neighbor we had so many. Tonight I am going to try to make these as buns for philly steaks. Will let you know how they come out for that!

These are exactly the kind of butter rolls I was looking for. I will make these regularly now. I'm thinking that one possible reason some people had trouble with these not coming out fluffy is that, unlike most bread recipes, the yeast in this is measured in *table*spoons, not teaspoons.

I made these for the first time today, and the whole family loved them!  I used the bread machine dough cycle- warmed the water and added yeast and sugar to the pan first, letting it sit a few minutes.  Then I added the remaining ingredients, melting the butter (which I used for the shortening).  The dough almost rose over the pan, so be cautious of that.  The dough itself worked so nicely.  I baked them on a cookie sheet- I think they would cook nicely in a 9x13 as well (to make them a little taller, and soft around the bottom half of the roll instead of crusty).  I brushed a little butter over the tops of the rolls as soon as they came out of the oven.  The result was a nice, soft, tasty dinner roll.  Following another reviewer's tip, I baked 1/2 of the rolls today and froze the other 1/2 for another night (thaw 2 to 2-1/2 hours, shape, let rise 45 minutes, bake).  We can't wait to eat them again!

I thought these were a little bit bland though any roll warm from the oven is delicious and these were no exception.  I prefer my go-to recipe, however, that calls for butter, dry milk, and an egg. And I let my bread machine do the mixing and kneading.  Also, regarding instant vs dry active yeast - I use instant for everything (so much less fussing) and adjust the directions accordingly (mix with the dry ingredients) while keeping the total volume of liquid the same.

I knew this recipe was good because it is the roll recipe my sister always uses. I had to make it twice to get it right, but the second time gave me great results. I used the amount of salt called for the first time I made them, and found them way too salty. The second time I made them, I cut back to 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I also subbed butter for the shortening (and my sister usually uses canola oil). I also used warm water instead of cold water in the recipe to save on rising time. My husband and youngest daughter really liked them (as did I)!

Made these following directions as stated. 20 minutes of kneading is defiantly a workout but it was worth it in the end. These were very delicious, light, fluffy and pleased the hubby. I will be making these again.

These are very simple to make and turn out great every time.  I mixed them in my kitchen aid stand mixer which cut down on time some.  Tried once using warm water like some other reviewers suggested and they didn't turn out as well.  Follow the directions as stated and they are delish!  Can't keep the kids out of them.  We like to sprinkle a little thyme on them before we bake them.

These were wonderful. I made the dough in my bread machine and then made them into rolls, let rise for 30 minutes and baked according to directions. My family devoured them!

This was another recipe I really wanted to like, and maybe need to give it another try, as another reviewer here suggested.  It got such fantastic reviews, and I followed the recipe to a "T", but ultimately the rolls were dry and hard.  Decent flavor, sub-par texture.  I wanted the light, fluffy texture most others were raving about!  Any suggestions would be most appreciated...

Awesome! I made mine slightly more dense because I skipped the shortening completely and subbed for 1/4 cup of canola oil... the shortening is not healthy enough for us and the canola oil worked out fine. I also baked for 12 minutes on 350 and they were completely done.. maybe my oven is just quick. I brushed the top of the rolls with margarine. Very good!

Just an ordinary dinner roll, don't see what is so specail about them.  With a little bit of extra spices and some butter on them I think they would be much better.  Maybe some italian seasonings an some parm cheese would be nice.

These rise very well, provided you warm up the water, and mix it with the yeast and sugar and then let it sit for 10mins before adding the other ingredients. I kneaded for only 15mins, since the dough was already quite springy by then. Also, I didn't need to add the required amount of flour... I used less 1/2 cup or so. 0_o I added a bit more oil, but these should be eaten in like... 3 days.

I heated my water to about 105 degrees. These tasted great and were really easy. mine weren't as fat as I would have liked, but I'm sure that's personal error, not the fault of the recipe- so I'm rating it five even though mine weren't very attractive. :)
