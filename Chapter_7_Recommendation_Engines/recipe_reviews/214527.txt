I loved this marinated flank steak! I used a different coconut rice recipe, but the steak was definitely the hit of the meal. Marinated overnight and cooked on the grill, the steak went directly from the cutting board to my mouth several times before I finished portioning it out to my family. A real winner!

Really good recipe.  The acid from the pineapple and lime juice marinade really makes the flank steak tender.  It was too cold outside to grill, so I broiled the steak for 10 minutes per side to medium doneness which was perfect.

What a great easy recipe.  I like my steak med-rare, but it always ends up too dry. This marinade was awesome!!  Also, the rice was a nice change up from the norm.  Delicious, thank you!

This was excellent. My husband thought the rice with pineapple was a bit much, though he loved the coconut & almonds. I think next time I'll leave the rice mixes on the side. I loved it so much I'm making it again this week.

Didn't want to use a store bought easoning, so I found a jerk marinate recipe for the steak and used the pinapple, cilantro, and lime, as a light salsa to top the steak

I'd give this 6 stars if I could. This recipe is fabulous, so full of flavor.  I can't wait to serve this to company and bask in the many compliments. I  made the jerk seasoning from a recipe on this site so I wouldn't have to use a commercial product.

This was very tasty & very tropical. I did everything the same but took the advice of another reviewer and broiled it because it was too cold outside for the grill. Thanks.

This came out well. I only marinated my flank steak for 5 hours but wished I'd done it overnight -- try and do yours overnight for best results. It's worth the money to buy fresh cilantro for this recipe (vs. dried) because it WILL make a big difference. However if you don't like cilantro, you can omit it and as long as you like jerk seasoning be pleased with the results. I served this with grilled bell peppers (marinated in balsamic vinegar and jerk seasoning) and jarred tropical fruit mix. Thanks for sharing!

Recipe was extremely good.. Wish I had more time to marinate the meat before we had to eat. Rice was a huge success. My first "allrecipes.com" attempt.

Very tasty, different, a great combination of flavors, and simple as can be. I made it with brown rice, and liked the nutty texture it gave. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly. Even my kids enjoyed it. The only think I would suggest is doubling the rice and pineapple. I cut the meat in half (as we were only feeding 3), but I kept the rice the same (thinking I would have leftover). Surprisingly, I had exactly enough rice! So, I would definitely double the rice if you are wanting to feed 6. Thanks for a fabulous and easy recipe!

This was an excellent, flavorful dish.  I also made this with chicken instead of steak and it was great too.  I left out the cilantro but there was still plenty of flavor.

This is one of my favorites!  It's so worth getting a fresh pineapple, limes and cilantro.

My family loved this so much.  I will be making this steak and rice over and over again.
