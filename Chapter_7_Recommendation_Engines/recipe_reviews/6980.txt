For a Professional Baker to say a Home recipe is Fantastic... is usually Just a Compliment, but I MUST say This Recipe IS Fantastic! Liquid to Dry mixture ratio is easy to adjust, if need be.The Kneading if done gently, is perfect for a fine crust and a silkin inner texture.The bake time is just right ( i use 9" X 12" X 3" pan half full of water, on the bottom rack,below the rack with the bread, for added moisture in the oven)Three Cheers to You "DINGO", Three cheers indeed.My Home Bread from now on! Thanks Again !

This recipie was delicious!  I made this recipe away from home and had no bread pans so I just tossed the entire piece of dough, which would have made 2 loaves into a large non-stick wok/skillet and it came out as a beautiful large round loaf!  I didn't need to extend cooking time at all.  I just kept my eye on it and took it out when it was brown enough.  The family loved it!  It even tasted great the next day...still very moist.  Thanks a lot for this one!!

Fabulous! I made the bread with skim milk and all purpous flour because that is what I had on hand. I also reduced the baking time to 25 minutes. Absolutely wonderful bread! My new white bread recipe, for sure.

Instead of baking this recipe in normal loaf pans I placed a ball of dough in opposite corners of a cookie sheet to get two round loaves.  One I made into a bread bowl to hold spinach dip and the other I cut into chunks to dip with.  It worked out well-- I'd do it again.

I've made this about six times now and the whole thing works perfectly. I also have added wheat germ and oat  bran, raisins, craisins and dried cherries. (no, not all at once.) When you add anything dry you need to adjust the wet ingredients as well. The dough is beautiful all the time and the bread has a lovely silky texture. I do tend to hand knead a bit longer than I might have done with a whole wheat for instance-but the dough comes out very  silky and terrific. I make this all the time and my family loves it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made half the recipe and it was EXCELLENT. Moist, nice crust, even light airy crumb and lovely flavour. I had to use about 1/4 cup more flour than called for. The dough is slightly wetter which makes the bread so moist so don't try to add more flour to make it drier. The dough also is quite spongy when shaping for loaf - that is normal so don't try and squeeze all the gas out. 
Baked for 25 mins @ 400F middle shelf.

I love this bread! I've been looking for a great loaf bread to use for toast, sandwiches, etc. I change the recipe to 12 servings for only one loaf. I also like the flavor a lot more when I use honey rather than sugar; I use about 1 tbsp. When I make one loaf, I generally use @ 3-1/2 cups flour. I bake mine for about 25 minutes and it has a nice density and chewiness that I enjoy. I brush mine with melted butter rather than mist with water. GREAT for morning toast w/ a pat of butter. Mmm!

Great recipe for the first time bread maker. This was my first attempt at baking my own bread and I have yet to have one come out anything less than perfect! Great for making smaller loaves as well. Simple and easy to follow. Thanks!

Good basic white bread. I brushed my loaves with melted butter when they came out of the oven.

Good basic white bread recipe.  Nothing fancy and the taste is rather bland so you will need to add something like jam or an herbed butter.

An absolute winner. Half of the first loaf was gone within minutes of coming out. We did bake it for 30 minutes and the timing was good. This was pretty sticky to work with so I added more flour than called for to make  it come together. I will be making this often. Thank you.

I didn't have any bread flour on hand, so I just used unbleached flour. It was yummy anyway!

I've tried many different bread recipes and most of them don't provide a nice product like this recipe.  I use this one all the time as my regular bread recipe and even as the "basis" for fancy breads like hot-cross buns.  This is an easy idiot-proof recipe that works all the time (except if your yeast is old... lol)

The only two things I do a little differently is that (1) I do all the mixing/kneading with a machine because my wrists don't have the strength, and (2) I use 1 Tablespoon of Egg-Beaters (regular eggs slightly beaten are fine as well) instead of water to baste the tops when they are ready for the oven - but be very gentle when applying the egg-wash so as to not deflate your loaf and spoil the batch.  I use a very light touch with my fingers instead of a brush because I can control the touch better.  The eggs will give the bread tops a nice glossy brown which is very eye-appealing.  I sometimes will sprinkle some dried green herbs (like parsley) on top or even Parmesan cheese while the egg-wash is still wet just for a change.

I love this bread! I now use this recipe to bake my own bread instead of buying it from the grocery store. I only have to bake mine for 20 minutes and butter the loaves right after they come out, and it has turned out perfect every time. It tastes best when fresh out of the oven with a little butter on top. :)

This recipe was super easy to follow and do, I didn't have to wait 12+ hours like other bread recipes. It turned out great, looked great and tasted great too!! 
Being as impatient as I am, I tried eating it almost right after it came out of the oven and the crust was almost too crusty, but i know that as it cools off it will get a little softer and taste even better! Great recipe!!

I made it with whole wheat flour and baked it longer at a lower temperature, it came out impecably.  It had a thick dark crust and a very tender bread, it was widely popular.

I tried this recipe and wasnt successful.  I think the weather had something to do with it. But apart from that, I think 3 cups of liquid was too much. I had to add 2 more cups of flour to get it to kneading consistency.

I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe but the mix seemed too "runny", never really forming a dough, even after adding an additional 2 cups of flour. It's still proofing right now so if it all turns out good anyway, I'll come back and re review. Maybe it was an error on my part.

Bread has so few ingredients you'd think it would be hard to mess up, but I am horrible at making it.  After reading the reviews for this recipe, I had to give it a try.  Other than cutting the recipe in 1/2 to make only one loaf, I changed nothing about the recipe and it was the most perfect loaf of bread I ever made.  I knew it was going to be a good just by the the silkiness of the dough when I was kneading it.  Even the rise times were spot on for me.  I baked at 400 and checked it at 20 minutes and it was a perfect golden brown and done baking.  I think using bread flour over plain white flour makes a huge difference.  This recipe will be "my bread recipe" from now on.

I have never baked before in my life, literally never. I picked bread as my first experiment and this recipe. I substituted honey for the sugar and reduced the salt by 1/3rd. Used all purpose flour since that is what I had on hand. And I reduced the servings to 12 (one loaf). All I can say is awesome! I am so excited that this bread turned out so well! My wife is on vacation with the girls, she will flip when she tastes this!  She whole house just smells so good when you bake bread!

For a whole year I refused to buy bread, and only made my own.  This is the only bread recipe I used and quickly commited it to memory.  This dough yields excellent rolls for bun-style sandwhiches, too.

Ok, as with other reviewers, I had to add additional flour, about 1.5 cups, but that's nothing on the recipe. Flour is very persnickety, and what was a perfect 6 cups for her one day may not have been, even the next! I really like this recipe- it reminds me of my grandmother's recipe, in taste, but somewhat of French Bread in texture. It doesn't have a pronounced flavor, but I've come to expect that of white bread, and this one has much, much more flavor than anything you buy in the store! I made this to use 2 slices in Ricotta Gnocci, but was just informed by my 7-year-old that this is a repeat recipe. Thank you! It's lovely!

I changed the recipe by adding 1 cup stone ground wheat flour and subtracted from the rest of the bread flour so the flour amounts stayed the same. I heated 1 cup of the water to proof the yeast and heated the milk and then the rest of the water. this bread rose so fast with a wet towell covering the dish. I had to punch the down down put in fridge covered with plastic wrap because I had to go to dance practice. When I got home punched down dough and put in 2 loaf pans covered with wet towell and rose and baked. So goooood. Will definiatelly make again this is a keeper. I have no bread machine so made by hand.

The thick crust and soft inside is a wonderful contrast when fresh and hot. This is a plain white bread I was surpised it was so good.

The dough was stickey. It need not raise much. And it drooped over the pans. I have never had bread turn out this way. I will never use this recipe again.

Great bread-its the only recipe I use. Would give 5 stars but the directions aren't as clear as the could be.
1. When proofing the yeast diets dissolve the sugar in the warm water then add the yeast and don't touch it. 10mins is a good guide line but it leaves a lot of variables open. The yeast is proofed when the solution developed a creamy foam and starts to smell like beer.
2. Use melted butter instead of softened. It integrates better and eliminates the risk if over working the dough because you are trying to work in butter.
Also a great tip someone gave me is to put a pan of water in the bottom of the over while baking the bread-it keeps it from getting too dry.

Very nice bread Dingo. Decided on Chicken a la King for dinner last night and realized I had no bread in the house. I make lots of bread but this was my first attempt at a regular white bread and it didn't disappoint. The  only change I"ll make next time is replace the sugar with some honey. Thank you!

I really liked this bread recipe, however it tastes just a bit bland. I think it would be better as a whole wheat bread, but that's just my opinion. I think this recipe is also a good one for people who are just begining to learn to bake bread. I have been for a while now and found this to be one of the simpler ones i've tried.

I have used this recipe about a hundred times in the last few months.  It is wonderful, and always turns out consistent, slicable loaves.  I find that I have to add at least a cup more flour though.

I didn't have a bread pan at the time so I just made a round loaf and let it do whatever it wanted.  The bread was great!  Since I did a round loaf it didn't work for sandwiches very well but it worked great for garlic bread, side bread, and I ended up dicing up one loaf and making my own stuffing out of it.  Overall great texture, browned nicely, no odd flavors.  It was pretty good and I will make this again once I have bread pans.

This is a terrific and easy recipe.  I made this recipe one evening, and let the loaves sit on racks in their pans overnite. The next morning I noticed that the loaf bottoms were a little soft and moist; so I put them on a pizza stone in the oven @ 400 for about 15 minutes to crisp up the crust.  Otherwise, don't change a thing! Thanks for a fail-safe bread recipe!

This produced a nice crust and a soft, melt in your mouth interior.  As with many others, I found I had to add more flour since it was very difficult to handle with just the 6 cups stated in the recipe.  Once I added enough, it was great to work with.  I should have taken a picture before I bagged the loaves - beautiful rise, nice and tall, perfect for sandwiches.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Did anyone else notice that the ingredients call for 3 cups of flour but the instructions say to add 4 cups to start and add 1/2 cup increments? What is the true total that should be used? This bread received raves and I would love to give it a go...anyone?? Im gonna give it 4 stars just to get this posted...I am sure it will go to 5 when I actually try it. Cant wait!

I made this recipe after trying a couple of different ones from this site. I found the measurements to be off as some others have noted. The recipe took way more flour than stated I added at least an extra 1 1/2 cups and it was still pretty sticky and hard to work with. In the end I did get bread but the crust was very tough and the bread tasted more like an english muffin. I definitely wont make this one again.

The bread comes out looking and smelling great but that is where your expectations should end. It is very heavy and dense and not at all like the light crusty artisan bread that we all have in mind when making this recipe. If you can get past the texture then you have to contend with the taste, or lack there of. It REALLY needs salt. We had to put salt on after we buttered it just to eat it. Normally I would throw something like this away, but come on, after spending all the time kneading and rising and waiting, we were eating this dang bread! I give it 2 starts just because it did come out looking pretty. This is something I wouldn't even bother modifying.

This was my first time making bread completely from scratch, and what a user-friendly recipe it is! I think I kneaded the dough for about four minutes, max... it just "felt right" at about that time. I did have to add a bit more flour while kneading to combat glueyness, but overall very simple. I added oregano and freshly minced garlic cloves to make an Italian bread, and it worked perfectly. I don't have loaf pans, so I formed two loaves in my 13x9 clear pyrex casserole dish. The loaves baked up very nicely and looked more "Italian breadlike" because they were a little flatter and wider than traditional loaves. Filled the entire pan with bread, and the loaves broke apart very easily! THis bread was light and sweetly tasty without being overwhelmingly full of sugar. Very nice!

This bread was great with just butter or jelly!  My family really liked it.  However, it only kept approx 5-6 days before it started to mold.  So eat it fast!  Next time I won't worry about "eating it all at once"!

This bread is really nice for sandwhiches!  It is soft...almost the texture of store bought.  Although I like my bread a little heavier, like the bread machine, this bread has pleased the whole family!  And it's even simple to boot!

One side of my loaf was much higher than the other. I have no idea what went wrong? Dough was really sticky compared to the "traditional white loaf" recipe on this site. Oh, & the ends were not very high either (really ugly looking! Tasted  ok, nice crusty crust!

Really great bread! I'm a first-time bread baker, and this turned out great!  The only thing I would advise would be to add up to 2 cups extra of flour (bread), until dough is slightly sticky. The 6-cups of flour yields VERY sticky dough. Also, bread is better when it has cooled a bit! :)  I cut a slice when it was still warm, and it seemed a bit underdone (approx 30 min oven time).  Later, the crumb/texture was perfect! :)

Kudos to the provider of this recipe! :)

I halved this recipe but had to add lots of flour (probably a cup or more). It was still kind of sticky when I set it to rise the first time, but it expanded splendidly. Crisp crust as promised, and very very tasty.

Glad I had experience with bread.  Dingo needs to reduce the liquid amounts to a total of 2 c.! Perhaps 1/4 c. water to dissolve the yeast, then 2 c. liquid.  Then the 6 c. flour almost works.

This recipe was wonderful. Cooked up really nice and was super easy to make. All my coworkers raved about it when I took it to work. I only had one problem it seemed really salty. I think next time I will try it with less salt. This is definitely a keeper.

Never made bread before and I was NERVOUS! But it turned out awesome. At first I thought the dough was too "wet" but I didn't add more flour or anything else..just worked thru it. I followed it exactly and it turned out SO good!!! I WILL be making these again! Some reviews said it was bland but it's white bread. Just add a little butter and enjoy! Yummm

An excellent multi-purpose dough.  I use this for making pizza pockets, pepperoni rolls, cinnamon buns, dinner rolls, and basically anything where bread is needed.

Wonderful! I prepared the recipe as listed but ended up needing to add more flour as it seemed a bit too soupy. End results were perfect regardless. I divided the dough in three parts, made a traditional loaf of bread with one, some burger buns with one third and some chinese steamed buns with the last portion. All were delicious! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Very good, very easy. This is a great recipe for a first time bread maker. I did not change anything, except I let is rise for more like an hour and a half.

I've made homemade bread only a couple of times and both times were flops filled with disappointment. This recipe, however, changed my bread making world. The rolls and loaf of bread turned out absolutely delicious. I stuck to the recipe instructions to a T and will make again and again without changing a thing. The way the rolls and loaf rose was a beautiful sight that I will never forget. Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe.

Someone please let me know if this was only for bread machines, because I used the oven and this bread came out not only hard but overly dry as well. I followed this recipe step by step, I didn't change a thing (it's bread and I'm new to making reg white loaves of bread so I'm learning what works and doesn't), and this bread came out flavorless. I'd used another white bread recipe and I was just trying this one to compare to other one I had. They were like night and day.  I'll never try this recipe again.

This is the best bread I have ever made!  I have made around 10 loaves total, but all 10 were different recipes.  I did like others on here and used 1 T honey instead of sugar, and I accidentally used butter-flavored Crisco instead of butter.  I used 2 packages of yeast as well.  It rose like crazy, as you can imagine, but the bread did not taste too yeasty. I must have kneaded in another cup or more of flour in a full 8 minutes, but the bread was still tacky when I put it in the pan.  LOVE this bread!  Kudos Dingo.

I loved this bread, although, the crust was like any other bread.  Further, six cups of flour will make two small loaves in 9x5 pans.  It takes 8 cups to make two full size loaves.  I just raised the portions accordingly.

This was my first time making bread, actually making any kind of dough!  Found this recipe to be very easy.  I made 1/2 the recipe and used regular flour and low fat milk.  I also took the advice of putting melted butter on top instead of water.  Cooked in 22 minutes. The crust is really hearty so maybe if I took it out a minute or two earlier.  Also need to work on my kneading technique.  The bread is really light and airy and the crust is as I said, crusty! I'm going to try freezing the bread to see how well it stays. Thanks for a great recipe - so easy even I could follow it!!

This recipe for this bread is a keeper.  Great crust and tender delicious crumb.  Low in fat and sugar.  My 86 year old mother who has baked bread for most of her life couldn't get enough of it.  She said her bread was never like that.

Wonderful!  This is what we've been looking for!  A light; white bread; that doesn't go stale quickly so long as it's in a bag or similar;doesn't go mouldy quickly in general; keeps it's fine flavour even past that first day or so.  Not to crunchy in the crust for the kids; but has a nice bite to it; not as soft as the interior.  Slices well; not crumbly; holds its texture; easy to spread marg or jam, etc. on it without it falling apart; easy to make; really; overall; a great white bread.  The only differene I made to the recipe is to proof the yeast in a warm milk/water/sugar mixture rather than just the water and sugar (I always do this; though); and to add half a teaspoon of bread improver; again; as per usual when I make bread.  Our staple recipe now!

I used all purpose flour (didn't have bread flour on hand) and halved the recipe, but really didn't have any problems making this bread.  Dough was a little sticky so I added some flour while kneading, but no problems.  My husband and I liked the basic taste of white bread (no frills) and I am going to make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like how my bread turned out. I am definitely a novice - this was my first attempt at making homemade bread. I ended up using over a cup of extra flour during kneeding because it was very sticky and gooey.  However, it turned out great and my five year old son enjoyed a PBJ soon after.  I think it is perfect for sandwhiches.

This recipe definitely did not meet my expectations.  The dough was extremely soft and hard to knead.  It rose fine, but after I put it in the oven it didn't rise any more and the top fell in.  I tried it to see if the taste was any better but it's pretty bland.  I think I'll stick to my old bread recipe.  Sorry!

I am not a big fan of white bread but this one came out great.  It was nice and soft on the inside and crusty on the inside.  I used it for bread pudding and it worked out well.  I will keep this recipe for further uses.

This makes wonderful white bread.  I did reduce the salt to 1/2 Tbls. and it was just right for us.  Also made it using 2c. wheat flour which was even better.  Thanks Holly for this recipe, it will be a staple at my house. maryann

I've just made this bread and I must say that I too had to use at least 1 1/2 cups additional flour as it was much to sticky to work with.  Also I used the damp cloth as instructed and when I went to punch down the dough it had stuck to my dough.  I thought possibly I hadn't dampened the cloth enough but when I went to remove it from the raised dough a second time again it stuck to the dough.  It has risen beautifully and is baking as we speak, it looks beautiful.  The critics of the family will scarf it I'm sure!

Using all purpose flour I used at least 2 extra cups, if not more. Eh, that's fine but a recipe is supposed to give exact amounts.

I think you can reduce the amount of yeast (makes it cheaper) without bad results. I used molasses instead of sugar. 
Right now I am trying this with 1/3 rye flour....

This bread was tasteless. It smelled great baking so I had my hopes up for a nice slice of homemade bread. Nothing can help this bread. The over powering taste of nothing kills out anything to put on it to make it taste good.  WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN

For a first-timer, this bread was very easy and fun to make.  It tasted amazing right out of the oven.  Like almost everyone else said, I did have to add about 2 cups more flour to the dough because it was VERY sticky.  Once that was taken care of, the dough turned out perfect!  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this bread for Thanksgiving this year and it was a total hit! I usually don't measure my ingredients to anything because I think it turns out better.  I went by the recipe on how to knead it and to add the last 2 cups 1/2 cup at a time.  That seemed to really help the consistancy. I really liked the oil based part of it.  It really does make it crispy.  It was sooooo good!

I read the reviews on this bread and decided to try it.  I make homemade bread at least once a week.  This bread was totally goopy and not like any bread dough I've made before.  I added well over 1 cup of flour to the dough to even get it to a consistency I could kneed.  I did see other reviews that had to add flour but why would someone rate a recipe 5 stars if it wasn't quite right as written?  I weigh my flour so I'm sure I added exactly the correct amount.  This one seems WAY off.

good but not what i was hoping!

I was pleased overall by how this recipe turned out.  I cut the recipe in half because I only have one loaf pan.  Like the other reviewers said, I had to add 1 cup more flour than the recipe calls for (4 cups total for my halved version).  It came out really great.  I used a bit of egg wash on the top and got a nice golden color.  It was lightly crusty on the outside, soft  on the inside and was very good as a grilled cheese sandwich!  It also took a little longer because I had some trouble getting the dough to rise at  first.  It wasn't very warm in the kitchen (about 75).  My trick was to turn the oven on and place the covered bowl on one the burners, not on the stove surface itself (too warm).  The extra heat bumped the kitchen temp up to 85 and did the  job nicely!  I did it again during the second rise when it was in the loaf pan.  Overall, a recommended recipe...just be aware that you'll need more flour and watch the rise!

Great texture, but a little bland taste wise... but seeing as that we usually put fillings in between slices... this as wonderful! UPDATE: I used 1 tbsp + 1 tsp each of sugar and salt. Used 2 cups milk and 1/2 cup water. Also 2 cups whole wheat bread flour and 4 cups white bread flour. And oil instead of margarine. Much better! More flavorful, and switching around the values of milk and water make for a fluffier, more nutritious bread. I also cut down on water, because the dough would be too sticky if I stuck to the original recipe. If you use the listed amount of liquid, you'll need an extra cup of flour or so. Brushed top of bread with milk prior to baking. Baked at 400F for 25mins. I had to cover with foil in last 10mins to prevent over-browning. And brushed with margarine after baking to soften the crust.

Mmmm... a very tasty bread with such a soft and heavenly texture! I baked for a few minutes less which produced a soft crust, rather than a crispier one, but it in no way detracted from the great taste of this simple, no-frills bread.

The dough was a bit sticky, even after adding all the flour, so I had to add a bit extra in order to knead it, but I only used enough so that my fingers just barely didn't stick to it. I was a bit worried, but after the first rise the dough puffed up big and fluffy and worked into a loaf without any problems.

This is THE bread recipe I'm using to make my "home bread" from now on! Thanks for sharing this!

I've been making Homemade Wonderful Bread from this site (because it's awesome) but I have gestational diabetes and wanted something with a lot less sugar.  I tried to put this in my bread machine for the dough cycle, but it was WAY too much and instead, I dumped it into a bowl, mixed it and kneaded it by hand (really not that much harder - just an easy extra step).  I had some just now while it was still warm, and I'm sold!  It's light and perfect on the inside and very nicely crusty on the outside.  I also got two smaller loaves instead of the one larger loaf I normally make, so it will last longer and my sandwiches won't be gargantuan!  Thanks so much for a lower-sugar alternative to my other favorite white bread recipe!

This is an excellent recipe~the loaves were beautiful! Instead of kneading the dough for 8 minutes, I put about half the flour in and let my mixer do the work. After 8 minutes of mixing, I added the rest of the flour by hand. You will get a perfectly moist/chewy/lightly dense loaf of bread. This recipe is my new tried and true!

This made two beautiful large loaves.  The crust is nice and chewy and the interior is neither too fluffy nor too dense--just right.  It makes wonderful crunchy toast, and because it isn't sweet, as another popular white bread on this site is, it's a good sandwich bread as well.

I've made this bread three times and each time I've had different consistency of dough...however it has baked up perfect.  Light and fluffy.  I almost feel like no matter what I do it's going to end up perfect.

This bread seems to really hold its shape and doesn't crumble when cutting it- no matter the temperature. I got great feedback from family/friends. The hard crust really makes it special. I put eggwash on the top before putting in the oven, it gave it a nice glazed look and was still crusty. This bread works wonderful for french toast!

This was my first time making bread from scratch.  I had never even used a bread machine before.  I don't think I ever will! I found it very easy.  It is very filling in 1 inch slices. Will go well with spaghetti or pasta dishes.   I only ended up using just under 7 cups of flour.  It reminds me of the yeast rolls you get at Luby's.  I found it too crumbly for sandwiches so I will try bread flour instead of all purpose flour next time.

Recipe required much, much more flour than listed.  I had to leave to run out to the store to buy more because I ran out.  I probably used more like 10-12 cups.  Overall, though, it was fragrant, made a lot of bread (12 cups of flour makes a lot of loaves!) and is a good basic recipe that just needed quantity tweaking.  Have lots of flour on hand!

We loved it.  I am new to bread making so. . . it was probably my best so far!  I did use a 5-day old Herman Sourdough Starter (the discard) (recipe from this website) in place of 1 cup of water.  Since I was using a Herman Starter, I only added 1 teaspoon sugar and proofed my yeast in warm milk and the sugar.   I used less flour than other reviewers--using a starter may have something to do with that.  I  pulled it from my kitchen aid mixer at 5 1/2 cups of flour and kneaded in about 3/4 of a cup more.  I proofed it in a Benetton and baked one loaf in a La Cloche and one in a cast iron loaf pan.  I had a good crumb and crust and it was not as bland as other reviewers mentioned--we really liked it.  I think when my starter is mature (very mature) this will be an absolutely fantastic go-to bread for us!  Thank you Dingo!!

It's a solid loaf of bread, great for toast and grilled sandwiches.

I halved the recipe. This was my first time making bread on my own and I undercooked it just a little as it has a few doughy bits, but it is still delicious! If cooking at a high altitude, it's alright to leave it in for a bit longer than the recipe says; next time I'll probably end up leaving it in for 25-35 minutes.

This is a lovely recipe, and it turned out great. I only wanted to make one loaf, I halved this recipe and only had to add a bit of extra flour. I substituted out the margarine for a mix of butter and olive oil. I really like to add things to plain recipes, so I added some grated cheddar and fresh thyme and rosemary!
DELIGHTFUL!

Very important to remember the salt! I made two loaves tonight and omitted the salt (as I used salted butter) the bread was light and fluffy but it was a little bland! I also used less flour and left the dough a little sticky! Amazing texture

I used all-purpose  flour.It rises well if you put it outside on warm day with a warm, damp cloth over it. You also need to let it rise until it is really golden brown, or else it will be doughy.

The whole family loved it. Shared with a friend and she makes more than I do. Her 8 person house hold goes through 2 loaves in 3 days. Works well with wheat flour too.

I made the bread as directed in the recipe, but varied it in making free form loaves and no pan, but a pie plate.  I was disappointed in the recommended baking time.  Golden brown and "hollow" sound are very subjective.  I baked my loaves for 30 minutes and thought that they were done.  Although they had a great rise and appeared to be baked with the bottom forming a nice crust,  the lower part of the loaf was not done and was soft and doughy.  I would recommend higher heat -425 or a 45 minute bake.  Also with this much flour-6 cups , this should probably make 3 loaves rather than 2.

I have tried a lot of bread recipes and this is definitely one of the best ones. I love baking and found this very easy to make however one of my loaves did spill over the side a little, which could have happened for any number of reasons. Bread can be a bit finicky, so who knows. The flavor and smell of this bread is heavenly and I highly recommend it, I'm sure I will make it again.

The problem with this recipe is the fact that both times I made it I needed to add another two cups of flour, and that was with our woodstove heating the house.  (Makes the house dry.)   I also had to adjust the bake time.   I had low expectations, but it did turn out o.k.    I will keep looking, though, for a more accurate recipe.

This was exactly the easy, moist bread I was looking for. Even a beginner like me can play with the recipe without fear. I added the rind of 2 lemons and about 2 tablespoons of minced ginger for a tasty but not-too-sweet breakfast bread. I'll definitely be making this over and over again, with as many variations as I can discover.

This is a great recipe! I use whole wheat flour and add ground flax seed. I don't know enough about baking to know if that's why it didn't take as much flour. But it's about 5 cups of flour for me but I just have to pay attention to the dough. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it always turns out great!!

made wonderful white bread. I added a tsp. of ginger to the yeast mixture. It is supposed to help the yeast give maximum volume and does not change the taste. Also because milk is a dough enhancer, I used 1 cup of water and 2 cups ofmilk.

This bread is delicious, but I didn't really like working with it; I never got that really workable dough feel from it that I like, it was so soggy and wet the entire time. Very bland, but good as toast or a sandwich bread. I'm still on a lookout for an awesome white bread that I enjoy making, though.

This was an excellent bread recipe. I added 1/2 cup more flour, added 2 tablespoons of dried rosemary, and brushed with milk instead of misting with water. It turned out absolutely delicious and the crust had the perfect texture.

This is a lot like what the supermarkets in the Northeast used to pass off (and some still do) as Italian bread, before the "artisan bread" craze took hold. Wonderful crust, with a soft, chewy inside. The dough was so moist that it was a little tricky to work with for a beginner, but well worth the effort.

I loved this bread! It was simple to make and the texture wasn't to soft. Although when I went to spray the bread I accidently got the light bulb and it burst so be careful how you spray the loaves.
