I made this pie for Christmas and it was the first pie that was gone.  My family loved it!  I made a regular pie crust and it was very good.  I was surpised to find that I had enough mix to make two pies, so I did.  I used the vanilla wafer crust for the second one and it was just as good as the regular pie crust.

The recipe turned out great. I made a homemade crust to go with it instead of the graham-cracker crust and it tastes great. Next time, though, I think I will cut way back on the almond flavor. It's pretty strong and a little too strong for my husband's liking. Otherwise, great pie!!

Delicious pie!! So good. Creamy, fluffy and coconutty. I have also made it with a chocolate cookie crumb crust and drizzled a chocolate ganache on top. A great treat for the chocolate coconut lovers.

Made this for Thanksgiving Dinner - a wonderful addition to the dinner.  I will make it again.  Love the vanilla wafer crust.   I didn't have any gelatin and used corn starch instead and it worked fine except was a little runny.  But it was tasty enough that I'll definitely make it again.

I made this for Christmas this year and everyone really liked it! I made it with regular pie crust and a little less almond extract. It was very good!

Overall this was a great pie. Just a couple of small changes I will make next time, I will change the crust up because mine came out very soft & now how I like my pie crust so maybe a different type of cookie? Also next time I will toast the coconut that goes on top for something a little extra. Overall was very good & I will make it again!
