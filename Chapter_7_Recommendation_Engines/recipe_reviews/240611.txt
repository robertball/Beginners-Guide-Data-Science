Add a dash of salt.  And toast the product after cooking cut in half under a toaster broiler and you have slightly less doughy product.  It has good flavor and when paired with a product like apple butter, sweet potato or other type spreads is particularly flavorful and still healthier than a plain muffin with butter.

I received an email highlighting this recipe and I made it right away.  It was, quick, easy and filling.  I only used 1/2 the cinnamon it called for, but next time will try a bit more.  I also only used 1 TBSP of walnuts to keep the calorie count reasonable and it was enough to add a good crunch.  I used whole oats instead of quick  oats (it was all I had) & whole flax seed & the muffin was very good.  Next time I will add some sliced apples or dried cherries.  Tip: Make sure you use a large cup; it will cook more evenly.  Mine took two minutes to cook.

I was surprised by how good this tasted!  It made a dense muffin  that was very filling.  I know everyone hates when a recipe is reviewed after the entire recipe is altered.  I do too!  That being said, I only changed 2 ingredients to make the recipe more Weight Watcher friendly.  I used 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters in place of the egg, omitted the walnuts, and used 1 packet of Splenda instead of the honey.  The original recipe was 13 Smart Points.  My version was 4 Smart Points.  I can't wait to make this again tomorrow for breakfast :)

Turned out well. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I just would like to reduce the cinnamon next time I make it.

I didn't have walnuts so used sunflower seeds. Wish either that they had been salted, or that I had added a dash of salt. Must try the toasting idea others had written about. Lovely warm with a bit of half and half over it though. Sort of a breakfast bread pudding.

Turned out very nicely. I will make these ahead of time and throw them in the freezer for a quick and healthy snack or dessert. Next time I would add a little grated carrot for a nice change.

I will make this again! I used less cinnamon, subbed hazelnut meal for flaxseed meal, pecans for walnuts and added a few mini chocolate chips. It's delicious and so quick!

Would like to have nutrition info with recipes. Found this recipe to be just okay.  Needs less cinnamon and more time (2 min. in a 1000 watt mw)

It flopped for me. Spilled over in microwave & didn't set up nicely. Flavor is nice.  I put half amount cinnamon & that was plenty. I'd cut the honey back if I were to make it again... Personal sweetness factor

I used plain non-fat greek  yogurt, added 1/2 tspn of vanilla, used xylitol instead of honey. I didn't put in walnuts . I substitued non-gluten flour for the flour.  I am trying to lose weight and be on a nutritional path where my calories,  proteins, carbs and fats are regulated properly in order to lose weight - and continue this for the last segment of my life, no more fad diets.  As my son just cured himself of Diabetes type II and lost 40 lbs following this type of regime.

I just read another review which said to add a dash of salt, that I think will make it really work-I'll try that next time - I am sharing it with many friends - perfect combo of protein and carbs.

This muffin in a cup is perfect for that, especially when one is on the go...I love it, thank you Nana...

Tasty muffin. I'll try adding some dried fruit next time. This would be good to put the dry ingredients in a Baggie and add in the wet ingredients when ready to bake in a mug.

Spray a LARGE mug with nonstick cooking spray before you begin.  I cooked it for a minute and a half on high but that wasn't quite long enough.  Next time I'll try a full two minutes. I sliced it horizontally in three pieces and put it under the broiler in my countertop oven while I fixed some bacon to go with it.  I really liked it! I love that you can make everything in one cup! It was a generous serving so you could eat half for breakfast and half for snack later on if you wanted.

Excellent recipe. I substituted almond flour for all purpose flour, agave syrup for honey, plain Greek yogurt for vanilla. I added a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and few chocolate chip, my son loved it. Great recipe, can be used for breakfast and quick and satisfying dessert. Possibilities for variations are endless. Thank you Nana for the recipe.

This was a horrible cake with great potential. This may be because I was missing many items on the list. I traded vanilla yogurt for strawberry, flax seed meal for flour, and chopped walnuts for oats. I also used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I know this is supposed to be healthy, but it was so bland that it's not worth it. what this cake needs is sugar and apple slices. I cooked my cake for 90 seconds. The top was dry and the bottom was underbaked. I am going to bake actual cinnamon muffins next time.

The muffin was quite bland and was not worth the calories. Syrup definitely improved the taste factor, but for something that is high in calories you would expect that the muffin wouldn't taste like you were on a diet. I did like the 'in a mug' idea and the original recipe cooked perfectly.

This recipe was good for a quick breakfast.  I added a pinch of salt, and substituted hazelnut meal for the flaxseed meal.  The taste was very good, but the consistency turned me off a bit.  It's more like a cross between a  souffle and a sponge cake rather than a traditional muffin.  I'll make it again because it's tasty, healthful and quick, but I'll use only half the cinnamon next time.

I made it & was disappointed.  It was a soggy mess & the taste was terrible.  That is purely subjective & I don't consider myself a chef by any means, but I have been baking for about 40 years & can generally make tasty stuff.  This won't be repeated in my house.

I will make this again.  I subbed pumpkin for the yogurt, coconut flour for the wheat flour, didn't have any flaxseed but my pecans were already ground so used them.  I liked the amount of cinnamon.  I would probably add a little coconut oil and some salt next time.

These are great for a quick breakfast or snack.  I shared this with my daughters.  Nutritious and satisfying. I did mix the ingredients in a separate bowl and very lightly sprayed the mug. To make muffin less "spongy moist", just micro a bit more, although this can make them a bit  "rubbery."  Still good.

Its wholesome and delicious breakfast alternative.  I swapped the walnuts with pecan crunchy muesli.  Its still abit too sweet and perhaps will add less honey next time.

This recipe was easy and quick, but was a bit drier and tougher than other mug cakes. If I tried it again, I would cook it for less time.

I did not make changes to this recipe. I love it just as is. I have it made several times and given it to a friend. It will be a regular at my home.

I substituted a pinch of Xanthan gum for the flax seed meal, and used King Arthur Gluten Free AP flour.  It was gluten free, light, tender, and totally yummy!

I made the muffin at work this morning and loved it. As a variation, I will change spice and nuts. It was so very easy to make.

Great! Made one for breakfast in a 16 oz mug. I only had plain yogurt so added a splash of vanilla. Will try it with whole wheat flour next time.

Sorry I didn't like this at all.  I used gluten-free flour so maybe that had something to do with the taste.

I was skeptical but this turned out perfectly.  The only changes I made were to so use plain yogurt with a few drops of vanilla   extract added and regular oats.  I spread a little maple cream on it while warm and yummmmmm!

I am pleasantly surprised at how good my muffin just came out. I used a few of the suggestions of other reviewers.... Only used 1/2 the suggested amount of cinnamon,  sprayed the mug before adding the batter and added a pinch of salt. I look forward to experimenting with some additional ingredients like raisins or chocolate chips.

I added a dash of salt, 1/4 tsp vanilla (because I did not use vanilla yogurt), substituted unsweetened low fat Greek yogurt instead of vanilla yogurt, and to make up for the lack of sugar in the yogurt, I added about 1 tablespoon Splenda, and also about 1/4 cup chopped green apple and 1/4 cup raisins. I would reduce the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. I like the idea of chocolate chips someone suggested.. or maybe coconut flakes. I will definitely try it again and slice and toast after cooking  per a recommendation. My muffin filled the coffee cup (its an Ikea coffee cup to give you an idea of the size) and went up and over the cup and dripped onto the turning plate. So a large coffee cup might be best.

I really enjoyed this muffin! It is a substantial breakfast. I halved honey and cinnamon due to other reviewers notes but next time will make exactly as described. Made in a large mug, the muffin baked perfectly in 95 seconds, but toasting at the end might be very nice . Thanks! Great recipe!

I substituted almonds for walnuts and instant apples and cinnamon oatmeal for the quick oats. Used brown rice flour and did not have flaxseed. Did not add all the cinnamon. Ate drizzled with pancake syrup. Good protein with carbs.
