Absolutely awesome. needs to be more Peanut buttery though. Here's what I did......Before pouring cheesecake mixture in, divide in 1/2. Melt 3/4 cup peanut butter (maybe thats a lot, but I like peanut butter so screw it), and mix with 1/2 cheesecake batter. Pour regular batter in, then pour peanut butter cheescake batter over that. When its baked and cut open, you can see the different layers of cheescake as well, so its a bit more attractive too. 
Will make again.  Rock.

SO rich, SO yummy, SO easy! I made this to take as dessert to a friend's house, and we all LOVED it! I took the suggestion of an earlier review and used a packaged brownie mix just to save time, and baked it about 8 minutes short of being done. Then I continued with the recipe and it turned out great. The brownie was moist, the cheesecake was fabulous... the only thing I might do differently next time is to use only half of the brownie mix- using the whole mix made a really thick brownie "crust". 
Make sure to have ice cold glasses of milk ready! YUM!

This cheesecake was really good but when making it again I will make a few changes:  First of all... you DO NOT have to bake the brownie ahead of time. I was skeptical but SO glad that I didn't bake it first because it would have come out way too overdone.  I used a regular box brownie mix and poured half into the springform pan then I layered all my other ingredients right over the uncooked brownie-- it came out perfect!  I also took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/3 cup peanut butter to half the cheesecake batter and then layered it-- i would definitely do that again.  What I didn't like was the peanut butter and chocolate chip layer above the brownie.  To me-- cheesecake is supposed to be rich and creamy and I didn't enjoy having to bite through hard chips.  What I might do next time is melt the chips first and then swirl them together, OR layer reese's peanut butter cups on top of the brownie... Another thing I did differently was melt some creamy peanut butter to drizzle over the top vs. using the chips... The peanut butter melted so much easier and tasted/looked great on top with the melted chocolate chips and was very easy to drizzle.  Overall the cheesecake had a great taste and was very attractive... just like I said-- the hard/crunchy chips on the bottom just threw me off a little as far as the texture-- try it with layering reese's peanut butter cups and let me know how it comes out!

This was an outstanding recipe.  Easy to make and well liked.  I made it for the first time to share on Christmas Day.  It was a hit.  I will make it again in the future.  The brownie was a little hard, but I will not bake it as long next time.

I always read the reviews before I make a recipe from allrecipes.com and I am really glad I did this time as well! This was a yummy cheesecake altho I do wish it had more of a chocolate and peanut butter taste to it. I tasted the filling and the brownie the most. This was probably the nicest looking cheesecake I have ever made - it had NO cracks! I now know that is from overbaking. Definitely you'll want to use the boxed brownie mix and just half of it. Also, don't cook it all the way, maybe just til firm. I think the next time I make this recipe I will chop up some of the chips and mix them in to the cheesecake mixture, or better yet, how do you think some chopped recess peanut butter cups would work in the mix? YUM!

This was a great cheesecake.  I also used a boxed brownie mix and only baked it for about 10 minutes prior to adding the chessecake filling and it came out perfect.  There was nothing left but the plate!!

My husband LOVES this cheesecake. I use a bagged brownie mix and bake it for about 10 minutes rather than the suggested time.  I also add 1 - 1 1/4 cups of creamy peanut butter to the cream cheese & sugar before I blend those together. I skip the drizzled topping simply because it doesn't need it. Bakes perfectly and tastes divine.

This was a great base recipe.  I used a box mix for the brownie bottom, and didn't bake it at all before adding the cheesecake layer.  I took about 1/3 of the cheesecake batter and mixed about 1/3 cup of peanut butter into it, and put that on first, then the regular cheesecake.  I also used peanut butter cups to decorate the top.  In addition, not that this made it healthy, but helped a little, I did use a reduced fat brownie mix, low fat cream cheese, and reduced fat peanut butter.  No one knew the difference, I got lots of compliments.

Overall, this was a very delicious and rich cheesecake. However, I had to bake the brownie part for only 15 minutes, and I wished the brownie crust was not so firm. It received rave reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner. I would like to try a different brownie bottom next time.

This one sounded so yummy, it was whipped up for Thanksgiving dessert.  I followed others by adding the peanut butter to 1/2 of the batter.  I must say, I was a bit skeptical when putting the batter in the pan, because it was so freakin' thick, but it really turned out perfect.  I used my own brownie recipe, added beautiful piped whipped cream with wedges of Reese PB cups to garnish.  I also made homemade caramel sauce to drizzle over top.  It got rave reviews from both friends and family who have sampled it.  
I will make this again, for sure!!  Awesome!

Absolutely the best cheesecake I've ever made. Not too chocolaty or peanut buttery, just right. Also pretty easy to make. My Thanksgiving guests love it. I'm making it again this week for a Christmas open house party I'm going to.

Very good! Although I didn't bake the crust before I poured the cheesecake topping on it.  Also, I would recommend not to mix the chocolate pieces with the shortening.  Just melt the chocolate and then drizzle over the cooled cake.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I followed some other advice and added 1 cup creamy peanut butter to filling.  I also added extra sugar and cocoa to the brownie bottom for a sweeter brownie.  You only need to bake brownie for 10 min before adding the chips (if you don't bake before adding the chips and filling, the chips will not melt.)  Easy to make and it will not crack!  As good as the Factory's.

This was my first time making a cheescake so I was a little skeptical that it would turn out. Afterall, it was a request from my 19 year old daughter for her birthday.  

All I can say is, a month has passed since the birthday and all her friends are still talking about it as the best cheesecake they have ever had.  Apparently it is the dessert of choice amongst young and old so I was quite pleased that they loved it so much.  Who doesn't love peanuts and chocolate!

Very good, however, the brownie bottom should be baked for a shorter period of time.  It was a little burnt tasting.

This is a great recipe. I agree that the amount of brownie mix needs to be reduced. I also decided against baking the brownie crust beforehand and it turned out great.

Tried this cheesecake twice.  First time burnt the bottom.  Then I only cooked the bottom about 10 minutes.  Much better the second time around and was well-loved by everybody I fed.

Although the taste is a delight you really have to pay attention to the details while making this cheesecake. I read the reviews as I do with every recipe, and found using a brownie mix would save much time. However you truly can screw this up if you make one mistake, as I have before, result is the brownie mix not baking fully, and that can be embarrassing if you have guests, family is okay. I did add a cup or more of peanut butter to the cheesecake mixture as suggested in the reviews, it does enhance the taste. Also I found a recipe for white chocolate brownies which I have yet to make but I am guessing with the newly white chocolate peanut butter cups available I bet the white chocolate brownies would be a added treat for those that prefer white chocolate over chocolate. Even though I have had one bad experience making this recipe, I have had several good experiences making this recipe.

This is a good cheesecake.  I made a "test" cheesecake first and the brownie part was just not very tasty.  I added some extra chocolate and a bit more salt, and it was fabulous! However, I don't recommend using the melted chips on the top as they tended to separate, I used a good quality dark chocolate instead and it was much more appealing.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I make a lot of cheesecakes, and this has been one of the most requested by friends and family (I even made it into individual cupcake sized cheesecakes for a wedding reception-it was a big hit).  I did put only the peanut butter chips over the brownie crust.  I think the crust was enough chocolate, but it tastes good either way.

This was the most delicious cheesecake i have ever made. I took the advise from several of the baker's reviews by adding a little more sugar to the brownie bottom, Thank god I tried it, it was pretty bitter. Also, I seperated the cheesecake mixture and added about a cup or so of melted peanut butter to it. And of course, since in canada we don't have the reeses chocolate chips I used crushed peanut butter cups. After, all that It was simply amazing and the birthday girl at work loved it and so did everyone else!!! Thanks for everyone's reviews!!!

Everytime I make this I get rave reviews!  Plus people never believe that I made it from Scratch!  I would recommend cooking the brownie for a shorter time than the recipe calls for plus adding a bit of oil to the brownie.  It just give you a fluffier brownie bottom!  But is also is good as is!

This tasted very good.  I followed the reviews and didn't bake the bottom (from a box) more than 10 minutes.  However, I'd like to know how the heck anyone makes the brownie into a crust doing that!  When I put the cheesecake in, it went ..sploosh.. down to the bottom of the pan and the brownie went up around the sides.  Even as thin as the remaining brownie in the center was, it didn't get done.  The cheesecake was also way too thick to make nice, neat layers with when I made 1/2 into peanut butter, it all kind of swirled together because I couldn't spread it without making the brownie mixed in even more.  I did use light cream cheese and egg beaters and maybe this had something to do with that.  Next time, I'll bake the brownie until almost completely done.  Then I'll put the cheesecake into a pastry bag and pipe it in to get a nice, even layers.  Still, my family loved it and it tasted good.  The cheesecake was very easy.  I'll definately make it again!

Decadent and super flavorful. Came out perfectly as per the recipe.  Next time, I might try replacing the peanut butter/milk chocolate chips with broken up mini reese's peanut butter cups.  Talk about decadent.  Tastes as good as anything I have had in a restaurant. Definitely a keeper!
