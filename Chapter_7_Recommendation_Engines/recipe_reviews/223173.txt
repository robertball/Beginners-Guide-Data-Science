This had a good flavor, but it certainly has a long list of ingredients.  Luckily, I had all the seasonings.  I cut it down by half, and three people had plenty, with some leftover.  We liked the flavor, but the vinegar seemed to predominate.  I will cut back on that next time.  I wondered about using two corn tacos, but after serving it on one, I understood the reason.  One corn taco kind of fell apart, so two is a good idea, and there would be a stronger presence from the tortilla.

This was yum. Cut Carne Asada into small chunks before marinating for 2 hrs. Omitted soy sauce, thyme and cloves. Added a dash of nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp chili pepper. Used juice of a lemon instead of the vinegar and used a tsp powdered onion and garlic. Stirred it up in bowl and tossed the chunks through. Saut√©ed on the stove adding a little water for sauce. Perfection on flour tortillas with cilantro, grated cabbage with a squeeze of lime and fresh tomatoes.

This was the bomb!  Made it with chicken this time but would totally use beef or pork, and the only other change was to omit the anise seed...just because I didn't have any.  Marinated my chicken over-night and then grilled it to perfection.  Served on tortillas with a spicy chipotle sauce, and an onion/cilantro blend.  Sooo yummy!

Made as written, except less vinegar.  Yes, recipe has many spices, thank heavens. While the 5 or 6 ingredient recipes have a place of honor, the recipes with complexity and depth are greatly appreciated too.. Thanks for buying and posting the recipe, it tastes like I remember from my days in Mexico DF.

For marinade: used cilantro instead of parsley, no anise, 1/4 tsp cayenne, lemon instead of lime, and a quarter size orange peel and zest (all overflowed my processor).  Marinade not a winner with family.  Think the thyme and oregano overpowered.  Also impt. to scrape off marinade or there's too much juice to brown steak.  I used baster after realization.
