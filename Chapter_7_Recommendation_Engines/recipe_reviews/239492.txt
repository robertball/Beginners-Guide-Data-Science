I made two changes--I used 2% plain Greek yogurt and for the dried fruit a mix of raisins, golden raisins, and cranberries.  I do think I would have liked a little something added to the yogurt--maybe a little lemon juice or even a touch of lemon curd.  I'll experiment a little because the salad ingredients are wonderful.  I used Costco's canned chicken, but I'm thinking I'd almost rather use a more solid form of chicken (I'm envisioning something like Trader Joe's Just Chicken).  It does get better with age, so while it made a good lunch yesterday, I think tomorrow the leftovers will make an even better one!  Thanks, pepper.

I used leftover rabbit for the chicken. I didn't have yogurt so used sour cream and subbed the pecans with walnuts. It's very tasty.

What a refreshing recipe for chicken salad. I used caned chicken breast and chopped up a pickle as I didn't have relish. Thank you for a delicious recipe.
