This was a delicious and simple dish to make.  I followed this recipe almost exactly.  Only made a few minor changes.  I only made enough for one to start.  I cooked the white grits according to the package and when they were done I put in a pat of butter and a good sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.  I also added minced garlic to the onion, green pepper mixture.  When the shrimp where done, I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth (to loosen the bits from the pan).  At the very end I added a handful of  grated cheddar and a sprinkle of Old Bay to the shrimp.  I wish I could say that my whole family loved it but alas...they dont like seafood.  I, however, thought it was wonderful!!!

Yummy!  Hit with the whole family.  I used chicken bullion and water since I didn't have broth.  Green peppers are not my friend, so they were omitted.  I used chopped green onions to replace the chopped onion and it added a lovely color.  Also added old bay to the shrimp and a bit of cayenne.  Tasted like it was a lot harder work than it was.  Love that it's good for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

LOVED this recipe!  Nice, creamy, and easy and no tomatoes :) As always, I made a few changes but they were simple.  I cooked the bacon whole and saved to sprinkle on top; added minced garlic to the pepper and onion, cooked that down and added about 2 TBSP of flour before adding the shrimp (which I increased to 2 lbs, jumbo-precooked); lastly I used water instead of chicken broth for my grits (personal preference).  This recipe is a keeper for sure-Thanks!

This shrimp and grits was so delicious and very easy to make! I added cajun seasoning to the shrimp to give it more kick!

Fantastic!  I loved this recipe.  Cheese, shrimp and bacon what's not to love about that?  I didn't have any evaporated milk so I just used extra chicken broth. I will make this again. :)

This was my first attempt at grits...and I loved it...of course, added a little Italian twist.  The changes were actually from my son's girlfriend from down South.

Excellent!  Try sprinkling your shrimp with some Tony Chachere's seasoned salt.  Gives it a little zing & more flavor - kinda like Louisiana syle. Mmmm!

This recipe was a huge hit! My only change was born out of necessity. I didn't have any bell peppers on hand but did have some jalapeños. I substituted a finely minced jalapeño for the bells and it was terrific. Everyone in my family loved it and my husband and son said they thought I should always use jalapeños instead of bells.

Good recipe - I didn't add any additional seasoning to the shrimp and for us it was a little bland.  I couldn't bring myself to add a whole cup of cheese to the grits either - so overall, if you really want a flavor punch I think the other reviewers that ramped up the shrimp seasoning had it right.  I'll do that next time, and will season the grits a little more to make up for the flavor lost by not adding a whole cup of cheese.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.  I am still trying to come close to the flavor of the shrimp and grits and I had at Pisces Rising in Mt Dora Florida.  This doesn't quite capture the lushness of that dish.

This is a great recipe. I omitted the cheese and added garlic, smoked paprika and red pepper flakes to the shrimp. I’ll make this again!  Delicious!

I’m gonna now rating the grits from this recipe at this time. This is the best recipe for grits I have ever made. For 2 of us I 1/2 the grits and add all the cheese.  Best grits with plenty left over for breakfast on another day.

Made it with black pepper thick cut bacon. Add a touch of zest with half diced jalapeno and tablespoon of red pepper flakes. Added 2 chopped garlic cloves, red and orange sweet peppers for color. Substitute heavy cream for evaporated milk. Juice from one lemon. AMAZING! The wife raves about it.

Everyone loved it. I tweaked a little. Cooked less peppers and onions and chopped them fine. Sautéed peppers and onions with a little sea salt and garlic first.  Then, added shrimp and other ingredients.  Used less cheese and served family style on large plate. Sprinkled cooked chopped bacon over top. Was delicious!  Will make this again.

lovely morning, on the veranda with a small portion and a pint is heaven. I did a wicked Alabama bayou twist using cajun conecuh sausage instead of bacon, whole cream instead Eva, red pep instead of green, Velveeta instead of cheddar (this little secret will have them screaming for how you got it so creamy), I poached the shrimp into the veggies after crushing the sausage, adding a minced habanero, sauteed spinach right at the end.

Easy to make but didn't have much of a "gravy" that I'm used to so it seemed a little "dry."  I'd probably add some stock to the pan and let it reduce next time before serving over the grits.  (Even better, maybe boil the shrimp shells and strain the liquid through a coffee filter before adding to the pan so it would be more "seafoody".)

It was really good. I added the extra spice. Next time I would not use the stock I made from instant   Too salty. My husband said the bacon overwhelmed the dish but I liked it. Made a half recipe and it worked fine. Grandma Pat

Great dish!  Turned out great and was pretty easy. I did add some old bay to the shrimp which gave it a nice flavor.

I REALLY enjoyed this! I did make a few minor adjustments - I used a mixture of red and orange bell pepper, as we don't care for green pepper. I cooked the bacon slightly, then added the peppers, onion and 1 diced portabella mushroom (the big kind). Once the veggies and bacon were cooked, I removed it to a bowl, then proceeded to cook the shrimp, adding a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. When the grits were almost done, I added the veggies back to the pan with the shrimp, and heated through. It was delicious!

This is a favorite at our house, although i have modified the recipe, i make my own cheese grits, I cook the bacon then add garlic then the shrimp, i remove the shrimp then add peppers and onions, once the are cooked down i make a rue and thin it down with homemade bone broth and bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer to thicken then add the shrimp back in.   Yummy!

I actually leave out the bacon and the bulk of the cheese to save fat and calories. It's still really, really good. It does need a little salt though.

Great base recipe. Careful with the bacon as it can make the shrimp component a little salty. Finished with a little chicken stock and milk (or cream). Added garlic, one chopped tomato, bottom of green onions. Used the tops of the onions for garnish.
