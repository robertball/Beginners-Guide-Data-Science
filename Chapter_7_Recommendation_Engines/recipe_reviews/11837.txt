I made this for my coworkers, who all raved. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage, and I think I liked it better that way. Plus, I made too much spaghetti, so I layered it in a 13 x 9 pan instead of a pie pan, and it worked great.

YUM! This recipe ROCKS! I've been making a very similar version of this one for at least 30 years now. It's such a unique twist on a way to use up spaghetti. It always comes out tasting great and as for presentation, well let's just say it gets lots of "OOhs & Aahs"... Especially when you serve it to someone who's not heard of it before. I would strongly suggest cooking it in the 10 inch glass pyrex pie plate rather than changing it up to a 9 x 13 baking pan. This was the original way it was intended and though I have tried it both ways, I think the "Pie" version makes for a better presentation. Add this one to your archives; I doubt you'll be disappointed.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great! Of course, I changed it a little. Instead of spaghetti noodles, I used angel hair pasta and made it in a 9x13 pan. I don't like the texture of cottage cheese, and didn't have any ricotta, so I put the cottage cheese in a food processor and mixed it with some dried basil, garlic powder and a pinch of salt until it was smooth. I used frozen cocktail meatballs instead of ground beef and a jar of Ragu. I cooked it for about 35 minutes. Everyone enjoyed it and it was very simple!!

I have been making this for years.  Although, i mix all of the spaghetti with the sauce and pour 1/2 of spaghetti into pan, add cheese mixture, then top with rest of spaghetti and then add cheese topping.  Makes spaghetti not so dry..

I love this recipe, but I am a low maintenance, jar of this, box of that type cook.  I use pasta, sauce, eggs, ricotta, butter, parmesan, mozzarella, and ground beef.  I used three eggs.  Be sure not to mix them too quickly with the hot pasta or they will scramble.  After making that mistake once I learned to temper the eggs first with a little pasta at a time.  The egg makes the pasta taste so hearty…yummy!  My mom used to make this all the time in her big 13 x 9 glass pan…memories.

Excellent flavor! As a second-generation Italian, I believe fervently in the virtues of ricotta in Italian dishes. After all, cottage cheese doesn't exist in Italy. Now, having made this with ricotta, as well as cottage cheese, I can assert that the cottage cheese makes for a better dish! We like the slight tang that's absent in ricotta, which is  quite bland. After all, spaghetti pie isn't a genuine Italian dish - it's an American invention, so it's best not to apply preconceived notions to it. The one objection I had to overcome is that the  cottage cheese isn't aesthetically pleasing. In the short baking time given, it can't melt enough to get rid of the curds. You know right away that cottage cheese was used when you cut it. For some, that might be off-putting. But that little problem can be overcome with one additional, simple step. Process the cottage cheese in the food processor for a minute before adding it to the recipe. This way, you'll get that intriguing, tasty result, and your plate won't be covered in unsightly curds. Additionally, I've made this as a meatless meal, as well, using only a chunky, homemade tomato sauce, and layered it with mushrooms and spinach.  I used homemade spinach pasta for that one. Great presentation! Be sure to cook your spaghetti in salted water (or add some salt when you mix it with the eggs/butter/Parmesan) to avoid blandness. Fantastic any way you choose to serve it up. But give the pureed cottage cheese a try - you won't regret it!

We loved this! I made a double recipe in a large Pyrex so we would have leftovers.  I added a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella on top and covered it with foil before baking as we are cheese lovers. I also substituted Ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I can't wait to heat up the leftovers! Served it with crusty garlic bread and fresh fruit-yum!

DH was asking for the spaghetti pie I used to make when we were first married, and I couldn’t find my recipe.  This is the closest I could find, and really good! Better than what I used to make, according to my DH.

I used lean ground turkey instead of the beef.  I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 pan, because we wanted leftovers.  I seasoned the turkey with a little seasoned salt while it was cooking with the garlic, onion and tomato to add flavor.  I used store- brand jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomatoes & paste, and added 1/2 of a 4-ounce can of tomato sauce to spaghetti sauce while it was cooking, so it wouldn't be too dry. I also seasoned it with a little oregano and crushed red pepper.  The only other thing I changed was to use 3 eggs instead of 4 (the doubled amount) in the noodle mixture, and I blended the cottage cheese in the blender so there weren't any large curds, because DH doesn't like cottage cheese.

I also cooked it for about 30 minutes before adding the cheese.  It may be because my oven doesn’t get hot enough, 

Overall, great recipe!

Tastes like lasagna with a spaghetti twist! We liked it. Great for making ahead (before kids sports games) and popping in the oven when getting home. Next time, I will use spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato paste and tomatoes to spice it up.

Oh so delicious.  This is the definition of what great comfort food should be.  Thank you Jennifer.  Can't wait until my husband returns from Iraq so I can make this for him.  He's going to be a very happy soldier.  It only gets better.  I've been eating left overs for a few days and still outstanding.  You will not be dissappointed.

So easy and convenient.  I made everything the night before and popped it in the oven fir 35 min when guests came over.  Changes I made- used a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce, added in green peppers, added a pinch or crushed red pepper in the meat saucem usd ricotta cause I think it tastes better.  But I do recommend using a casserole dish istead of two pie dishes like I did.  Froze half to reheat later.  Serve with garlic bread taken from the freezer section and some caprese salad I made at home.  Highly recommend if you want nothing too too fancy but very filling.  Just hits the spot.

Sorry - but this was more bother than it was worth.  Unless you are using up left overs this was nothing great - not horrible just ordinary.  Should have just made spaghetti or lasagna.

I also have been making this for years and using the microwave to cook it. But I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and also put a layer of ground beef or sausage meat and a layer of vegetables between the ricotta and sauce--the original recipe I had called for chopped broccoli, but thru the years I have used chopped zucchini, mushrooms, eggplant, green peppers and/or onions. If the veggies I use are "wet" ones I cook them first and drain them before I add them. Also for a treat I have added pepperoni slices to the top like a pizza. definitely make it in a deep-dish pie plate or use a square brownie pan. It freezes well if it is not too wet and sloppy.

I got this recipe from a college friend's mom from when I was in college back in the late 70's and have been making it since with just a few changes like more garlic, fresh mushrooms and I use ricotta never cottage cheese, add salt, pepper and parsley.  for 2 people I split everything in half between 2 pie plates and freeze one.  It freezes well.  and I dont measure any of the cheeses or spices..just go with eye and taste.

This recipe was in the cookbook that came with my microwave we bought when we first married nearly 30 years ago!   So I first learned to make this using the microwave.  Great idea if you don't want to heat up the kitchen.   It had you prepare the "crust" and then pop that in the microwave on 50% heat for 10 minutes and then add the filling and cook for 10 minutes on high and then add the cheese on top and cook another minute.  It was one of my husband's favorite dishes and I haven't made it in a long time.   Just forgot about it.

This recipe tastes GREAT! I call it "lazy lasagna" because it tastes even better than lasagna but it's so much quicker and easier to make. It's something I definitely make regularly!

I've been making this for 20+ years, almost identical. For a quicker fix, you can use ready made sauce & just add the meat & spices. The only main difference is in presentation. I make this in a bundt cake pan. When you invert it you have a layer of sauce on the bottom, then you can pour the remaining sauce on top of the spaghetti ring. Makes a nice presentation on the table.

Very good!  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese; spaghetti sauce for the diced tomatoes and tomato paste; and used a full cup of cheese on top.  I also left out the bell pepper.

Nothing fancy, but the grandkids loved it. I give it 5 stars because I thought for what it was, it was pretty darn good! I make two at the same time, and put one in the freezer.  Then I can just pull it out and heat it up.  We don't like bell pepper so eliminated that.  Not company type of dinner, but for the family, it's great and since I can make the mess once, freeze one, use one...that's my kind of time saving and clean up type of recipe!  And if there are left overs, it's great for lunch or dinner the next nite.  It heats up well.

This was a great recipe! I adjusted a few items as I sauteed mushrooms instead of the green peppers, added red wine to the sauce, and used whole wheat noodles. My boyfriend and I loved it and I will make it again. The only thing I might try next time is cooking the noodles prior to adding the sauce to make it more of a "crust".

We really liked this easy, quick and INEXPENSIVE dish and I will definately make again. I used plain greek yogurt drained mixed with 1 beaten egg and 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning in place of the Cottage Cheese for Lactose Intolerance reasons (as suggested by my AR Buzz Buddies), but otherwise made following the directions. Also, I want to make note that I DID NOT increase any amounts and 3 adults ate it for two meals. One pound of hamburger for 6 adult servings? Now, that's eating on the cheap! A great bargin meal.

This was so easy to make and was a big hit in our family.  There were no leftovers and I will be making this  again.  I made no changes except to leave out the green peppers only because I didn't have any on hand the day I made this.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!  I used whole wheat spaghetti, no butter, and lowfat mozzarella to make it more healthy.  I also used Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes to add more flavor.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to omit the sugar (didn't need the sweetness - just a personal preference), and add some salt to the spaghetti (maybe 1/4 tsp?) when mixing in the eggs and parmesan because the salt I left out made it need some.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this dish.  I used about 12 oz of the spaghetti with 3 eggs.  I also used a whole 16oz container of ricotta cheese and mixed in with the meat sauce to top on the spaghetti.

This is a recipe I've made for years, minus the green peppers.  I sprinkle parsley in the center of the pie and it's so pretty!  My kids love it and I often make it for neighbors, new mothers, etc.

I've been making this for years.  Often make it with left-over spaghetti sauce.  When my kids were younger they always asked for this dish.

This looked pretty interesting so I thought I would give it a go. I fiqured I would go for a lasagna type dish so I kept to layering this dish as opposed to mixing the sauce with the pasta as some reviewers suggest. To keep the pasta from being dry I added some V-8 and clamato I had on hand to at the bottom of the dish and tossed. This kept the pasta flavorful and juicy. I used ricotta and mixed in some sour cream  (I needed to stretch the recipe) and frozen chopped spinach for color and vitamins. I put spinach in everything :) I made one pie in a 9-13 pan and one in a deep dish pie pan for a friend who is just coming out of the hospital. I honestly did not see a difference. My son and his GF said it was fantastic and liked it better than my lasagna. My son said he liked it way better than he even thought he would. My hubby liked it too and had 2 plates. I think the eggs and parm with the pasta really seals the deal here. One thing though... I don't know how often I will be making this as this one was a lot of work. More pots and dishes than making a lasagna as I buy the premade fresh italian or ready to cook pasta and can skip the noodle boiling step altogether. Because of the prep I only gave 4 stars. Glad I tried it.

Knew I was going to change this recipe a lot before I started...I took pieces from a few recipes.  But this was a great base. I used whole wheat noodles and mixed with just the eggs and parm, to reduce some fat from the margarine. I also subed some sour cream for cottage cheese and it was really tasty.  My pie pan wasn't big enough, so we used a square pyrex that worked really well.  Made some focaccia bread from All Recipes to go with it, such a TASTY meal.

Over all I really liked this recipe. The family all gave it a thumbs up. I did leave out the green peppers and tomatoes because no one likes them but me. I have seven in my family so I made this in a 9X13 pan. I used a pound of spaghetti, used 3 eggs and doubled the parm and butter. I used about 1 1/2 lbs of beef. Used a large can of tomatoe sauce instead of the tomatoes and doubled everything else. I used about 2 cups of cheese on top. I really like the texture of the noodles in this recipe. The cheese and butter and egg has a binding effect on them. Very important to not over cook noodles in this recipe. I took them out even a little before al dente. Came out perfedt after baking. Thanks for Sharing your recipe.

A very fast, very easy recipe.  Even my six year old picky eater asked for seconds.  Made a few changes though, whole wheat pasta, egg whites, ultra low fat cottage cheese, extra lean ground beef combined with soy, and low fat mozzarella.  It still turned out great!

My husband LOVES this!   I usually use linguine or fettucine because I like the wider noodles.   I use a jar of Ragu or Prego rather than the tomatoes & tomato paste.  I sautee the onion and green pepper with hamburger and garlic and add a little bit of Italian Seasoning.  I top the completed pie with a little more parmesan and a little mozzarella.  Bake covered for 20 minutes.  I then uncover and add more mozzarella and bake for 5 more minutes.  Extra sauce is a must!  I usually heat up some extra to put on top after baked as we like it saucy and moist.   Excellent recipe!

Bottom-line, don't be afraid to just use what you have in your kitchen. I really liked this dish and it was relatively easy and I made a lot of modifications because...I just didn't have the ingredients! I used left-over spaghetti and a 9"x9" glass dish as I didn't have a pie dish. I didn't have the Parmesan cheese or eggs either! THEN! I didn't have ground beef so I used the left over filet mignon from a few nights and since it had been already cooked, I let didn't add it to the onion mix right away. After the onion mix was browned, I added the finely chopped filet mignon and once they were mixed nicely, I added the tomato mixture. I didn't have the green bell pepper (plus...I don't like them anyway), and, I quadrupled the garlic. I used 24oz of stewed tomatoes. AND! I didn't have the tomato paste! SO! Once everything was mixed, I followed the same rules as listed, but let the dish sit for 10 minutes before serving it so that the sauce tomato sauce had a moment to firm up. If I have time, I'll just create my own recipe. It was really good! I hope this helps.

I used left over spaghetti and left over sauce from the other night. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. It took a little longer, about 10 minutes, to bake. My PICKY 8 year old loved it. We're keeping this one!

My family loved this recipe!! I did the forbidden and tweaked a couple things HOWEVER stayed true to the recipe, which is why Im still rating it. I omitted the green peppers (kids dont like them), nd used jarred sauce (for a shortcut) and ricotta instead of cottage cheese (Im full bloodied Italian, using cottage cheese goes against my religion :) Everyone LOVED it and went back for seconds. Smelled delicous baking in the oven. This is now in my rotation of go to meals

Made this for the kids using leftover sauce from lasagna that I made earlier in the week. So I can't comment on the sauce in this recipe, but the overall idea and composition worked out really well. I only give it 4 stars bc I don't think I would ever make it for guests or an 'adult'dinner, but this is a great way to use leftover spaghetti and sauce to make a good kids meal.

Easy and good.  I used half ground beef and half sausage and substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce with a can of tomatoes thrown in.  It worked fine in a 9 x 13 pan for my big family, I did have to increase the cook time though.

I liked this a lot.  The kids really liked it as well and told me this is how they want me to make spaghetti from now on.  The reason I only gave it four stars is because I didn't like the tomato mixture on top as well as I think I would like jarred spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will make it using Prego.

I made home made spaghetti the night before and went ahead and cooked a whole package of noodles and a lot of sauce. My sauce recipe is similar to the one shown. So instead of just heating up the left overs, I took this recipe and turned my leftovers into something my two kids and I really liked. I went ahead and used cottage cheese because it just so happened that I had it on hand. I really liked the cottage cheese with it but thought it could use more than 1cup. Next time I think I'll double it. I didn't have mozzarella so used cheddar on top instead. I cooked in a 9x13 glass pan for about a hour and although the egg was cooked thoroughly, the middle didn't hold together. But no biggie. It was still really good and next time my hub tries to explain his co-workers recipe from Boston, I'll be on top of things.

My hubby is a very picky eater but said I could add this to his list(of about 2 things) he could eat every day!  Everytime I make it it's a little different depending on what I have in the house but i always put it in a 9x13 (big family) and we still have very little left over.  It will work with any combo of pasta/ jarred sauce/ meat you have on hand, thus making it very versatile for a busy mom. Thank you so much for this great easy delectible meal idea!!!

I just made this for dinner and I'm stuffed! One slice was enough for each of us so there's leftovers for tomorrow pm. This is truly amazing!!! I used Dreamfields (low carb) pasta. I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe. If you find it makes too much, call me. I will be happy to help you finish it!!!

I loved this (had it as a kid).  Made exactly per recipe which was great.  Next time though I think I'll cut the butter in half, and add a little salt to the noodles.

Fair recipe. Nothing special.
Can be a little plain / bland.

I have been making this for 20 years and it is STILL my husband's favorite pasta dish. I generally make two deep pie plates AND a 9x13 pan of it, at one time. The pan is when we serve this with guests and the " pies" go in the freezer for another day.

This recipe has been around since I was a kid, and everyone seems to have their own version/spin on it.  A great way to use up leftover spaghetti.

Delicious and easy to make. Fun twist on spaghetti, although this recipe contains very few noodles so if you are looking for a more noodle rich flavor you may want to stick with traditional spaghetti and meatballs.

The only changes I made were to just use butter to grease my pan (9x13), additional seasonings (thyme, parsley, fennel seed, basil, marjoram, chili flakes), omitting the green pepper but adding some frozen spinach and mixing everything together then baking. I had either too much liquid or too much pasta as the texture of my "pie" wasn't what I imagine it should be. The leftovers firmed up some, and tasted even better. Serve with garlic bread!

Thought this was good! Loved the texture and flavor of the "crust". I used real shredded parm, not the stuff in a can. Also used my own meat sauce (because I had it on hand already made). Also added more cheese on top, for our family's preference. This was a nice way to step away from the same ole same ole sketti!

Very tasty and fun recipe!  I made mine in a 10" pie pan and molded the spaghetti around the edges so it actually looked like a "pie".  I've uploaded a photo of the end result.  I also used ricotta cheese.

WOW.  mixed n matched the ingredients to my taste, n switched the cottage to cream cheese, but this was the best thing i've had in A LOOOOOONG TIME. i'm telling you, layering it with cream cheese makes it taste like a sin!!! my daughter asked if we could have it for every meal from now on. n she's a tough cookie to please.

Discovered when using whole wheat pasta in this recipe that all the sauce/wet ingredients get soaked up...so next time I'll use spaghetti sauce and frozen spinach for added moisture when using whole wheat pasta. Other than being a bit dry from my mistake, it's a wonderful recipe. Thank you Jennifer for sharing!

Made as written. Not popular in my household with hubby or kids. I thought it was okay but since the fam didn't like it I definitely won't be making it again. The spaghetti 'crust' was bland and the meat mix on top was nothing special.

DELICIOUS! I made it for my hard-to-please boyfriend (he is always nice, but rarely if ever raves! :)), and he loved it! Left it just as it is- full of flavor, not too rich, love love love! Try it, you won't be let down!

My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I thought it would just be a nice presentation of regular old spaghetti, but it was quite different!  The noodle mixture is great and the cottage cheese definitely adds some flavor.  I crumbled up some leftover meatballs, added a whole green pepper and forgot to add the sugar/oregano - seemingly without any consequence.

Great recipe. I think you may have meant a 16ounce package of spaghetti, as 6 oz isn't enough though.

I just use this recipe as a guideline, switching out the cottage cheese for ricotta, going heavy on the sauce, and using my leftover spaghetti sauce and noodles ... but  I love making this to use up my spaghetti leftovers from the night before.

I used whole wheat spaghetti, and changed the butter to olive oil, and reduced it to 2 tsp. I reduced the parmesan to 1/4 c. and added a little salt and pepper to it. I substituted hot Italian sausage for beef and spinach and mushrooms in place of green peppers. I didn't have garlic, so I used garlic powder. I omitted sugar and oregano. I used a jar of no sugar added pasta sauce plus a splash of beer in place of the tomatoes/tomato paste. I sprinkled the top with a quick grinding of Italian herb seasoning, and baked it in a 7" by 11" glass dish sprayed with cooking spray rather than a pie dish.

It was a hit! like everyone else I used ricotta cheese. Also, I had a jar of spaghetti sauce & a can of diced tomatoes with chilies so I used that instead of the tomatoes paste and diced tomatoes.

This was a pretty tasty dish.  It is very easy and quick to prepare and it just hit the spot.  I followed the recipe  exactly.  I will however add another clove of garlic and some crushed pepper to the sauce and season the noodles as well.  We like more flavor in our dishes. Don't be scared by the cottage cheese... my husband didn't even know what it was... this is a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe.  I had trouble getting the spaghetti to form a dense enough crust so the "pie" fell apart when serving.  But the taste was so fantastic, it's worth the effort of tweaking it. Used fresh mozzarella cheese, a jar sauce (I was feeling a bit lazy) and meatballs instead of the ground beef sauce, per my son's request.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Really great. I subbed TVP for the ground beef so it was a vegetarian meal, and my husband (who doesn't like TVP) was none the wiser. ;-)

This was wonderful!! I had to use alfredo sauce since my husband is allergic to tomatos. But we loved it. I have shared this recipe with so many others and they all loved it too.  I'm making it for my Pastor for dinner tomorrow night.

As a vegetarian, I modified this recipe to convert it to meatless.  I then found another similar recipe on this site which is vegetarian.  My family gave the recipe with my modifications rave reviews.  I think that I will use more garlic in the future and add some crushed red pepper for a "kick".  I substituted fresh mushrooms for the ground beef and sauteed them with the onion and chopped red pepper (instead of green pepper) as that was what I found in the vegetable crisper.  I doubled the recipe and used a large can of San Marzano tomatoes.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese on hand, so I sprinkled parmesan on top of the "pie".  My family awaits an encore presentation!

I made this for dinner last night, taking the advice of a few reviewers and using a jarred pasta sauce instead of the tomato paste and diced tomatoes.  This came together quickly and easily, and was very good.  We'll definitely have this again.

Very close to the one I make, except my crust isn't quite as thick as these photos show.  The crust and filling should be about the same thickness as each other.  I make this with my own leftover spaghetti sauce, and in fact my family expects spaghetti pie the next night without question.  My daughter loves the crust mixture before it's even cooked, so I have to make a little extra for snitching!

Very tasty and fast dinner-I used the ricotta cheese and I sautéed a red onion,zucchini,mushrooms,cubanelle pepper and fresh garlic and then I combined with a jar of ready made sauce and spread over the ricotta and followed the recipe-Little children ate it and proclaimed it delicious

I tried this today. Changed it a bit as I did not have all the ingredients posted. It turned out great and you can bet I will make it again and again.

I make this with 1lb. sausage instead of the beef and I don't add onions or green bell peppers.  It is a delicious recipe.

A class of 9th grade boys came up with a receipe similiar to this about 20 years ago when I challenged their Home Ec class to find something creative to do with left-over pasta from a spaghetti feed.  It was a yummy solution to the problem!

Easy-yes.  Flavor-no.  So bland!  Lots would need to be done to this for it to be 5 stars.  I was excited to use something other than the typical spaghetti sauce that is in most other recipes but this sauce has no flavor and I used name brand diced tomatoes and paste.  Worth trying but just wasn't for us.

I have made a version of this for several years and find it is so easy to adjust with pepperoni, sausage, different cheeses and even different spices in my sauce. This last time I added spinach to the sauce, used whole wheat pasta, mixed cheddar in my romano and added tuscan herbs to the cottage cheese. It is loved everytime and it really does freeze well!

This is a great recipe!  Easy to put together and good tasting with some tweaking. It fills the kitchen with an irresistible aroma that makes everybody eager to sit down and eat! I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese because that is what I had.  I rated it only 4 stars  because when I taste tested the filling, I found it to be very bland. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to spice it up a bit. I served it with garlic bread, tossed green salad and sliced peaches sprinkled with a little nutmeg for dessert. Thank you, Jennifer, for an easy, impressive, mid-week dinner!

Does indeed taste like lasagna with a spaghetti twist, as another reviewer mentioned. I used 1/2 lb hot italian sausage and 1/2 lb gr. beef as it was all I had on hand. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the cottage cheese layer tasted like it needed something. My father who is a master chef, suggested spinach. I think the spinach would have completed this dish. Will be making it again! Thanks for the recipe!

great easy dinner. never made such a thing and I must say that It was truly unique. I never thought that spagetti could form a pie crust but it held together beautifuly. And the best part was that it made two meals. Thank you

I agree that this recipe is much better the second day.  The first night I was not that impressed.  I loved it for lunch the next day.  I used angel hair pasta and had to cook it in a bigger pan.  I don't know if I used to much pasta or what.  I also substituted Romano cheese for the parmesan and used more mozzarella than the recipe called for.

This is a winner. I used some sun-dried tomato pesto sauce and I mixed ricotta  cottage cheese. 
The receipe is great as is however, next time I will add more ricotta  cottage cheese, chopped mushrooms and mix italian sausage with it, for experimentation.

OMG just made this, well my version. Uses jar if spaghetti sauce. 1/2 C cottage cheese, 1/2 C Parmesan cheese, 2 eggs for filling. Noodles made a lot so took about 4 T butter 1/3 C Parmesan cheese to noodles when done. For the comments about text turn of cottage cheese... I'm a big texture person and particularly don't eat it because of texture but I use it to substitute for ricotta ( I know not the same but when you're cooking a last minute meal what's a girl gonna do) anyways use your fork and smash the egg, parmesan and cottage cheese together. Gives more of a ricotta texture and totally omits the weird texture. BTW ... I have 5 & 6 year old boys and my 6 year old had 1/4 of the pie and my 5 year old who I have a hard time eating food ate it right up!

I enjoyed it greatly with the recommendations of ricotta, ready made sauce, and a little extra cheese on top. Make those changes and I give it 5 stars.

I love this recipe.  We grew up on spaghetti pie but it never had the cottage cheese. I didn't have that on hand so I used ricotta instead.  Still very delicious.  Make sure you salt the water really, really well to provide enough flavor to the base. I also drizzled a little bit of EVOO on top of the cheese and raised the temperature to 400 degrees for an extra ten minutes. I made a double batch and placed one in the freezer for later.

Loved it - I used pre-made sauce and skipped all those steps, but it was wonderful and a great meal on a tight timeframe.  Would probably mix precooked spinach in with the cottage cheese next time for something a little different.

For parents tired of spaghetti and looking for a kid-friendly alternative, this is a good one. I did think the spices were a little boring; I'd consider amping it up with crushed red pepper, basil, more salt and pepper.

I made this for the first time a couple of weeks ago and my husband LOVED it.  He actually got mad when he found out that I had eaten the last of it for lunch.

I changed it just a touch by using a canned spaghetti sauce and adding italian seasoning.  I also eliminated the sugar.  It came out great with the changes so use your shortcuts it does not hurt the recipe.

I am making it today for a family potluck dinner and I hope that they enjoy it as much as he did.  It should mix well with the dinner because they are frying fish and spaghetti goes well with fried fish.

Stuck to the recipe, although I think I used too much spaghetti...hubby really liked it, but we did add salt and pepper.  I think next time I will add a lot of pepper to the spaghetti and 1/2 t salt to the over all sauce...and use cream cheese instead of the ricotta...but a good base recipe to start with...

Good!!!! Made as written except used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and omitted the green pepper because we didn't have any and we don't care for green peppers.

This was ok, but seemed to be missing something to me.  I think it would have been better if I would have just used a prepared spaghetti sauce and added some mushrooms.

Yum! I have made this several times. I always use angel hair pasta, and sometimes mix the enriched pasta with whole wheat (there is no difference in taste). I don't have a pie dish, so I just use an oval-shaped Corningware-type casserone dish and it works perfectly. Heats up very well for leftovers the next day too!

Very good.  Almost didn't have enough, so I think next time I will double the recipe.  I think it yields more like 4-5 servings, not 6.  I accidentally put the cheese on top initially when I first put it in the oven, which was a mistake.  The cheese started to get very browned near the end, so I just covered with aluminum foil and that kept it from burning.  Served with garlic bread.

Great recipe - I made it for two people and there was only one slice of the pie left at the end! I took the suggestion of using ricotta cheese instead of cottage and I used a little less than a full jar of sauce.  I also improvised a vegetarian version of this using black beans instead of ground beef and using cottage cheese since I had it on hand. It was good, but I prefer the taste and texture of ricotta. But this is great recipe to start with and tweak to your liking!

Love it! I use a store bought spaghetti sauce and frozen meatballs instead of ground beef to make it even more quickly. I also use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

It was pretty good. Not quite like the recipe I remembered from my childhood, but good. Mine was a little runny. I think next time I might use ricotta instead of cottage cheese to help with that.

This would have been 5 stars if I had made it as written but I was out of parmesan and ricotta.  Used cream cheese and sour cream instead.  Also used jarred pasta sauce.  As I made it, 4 stars.  Freezes nicely so we will have leftovers for awhile.  Great recipe.  I'll make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I swapped the beef for sausage, but other than that kept everything the same. I do think the crust could use a bit of spice (maybe some oregano next time), but overall, delicious.

I saw some reviews about ratings...almost every cook (Mom) has to make adjustments.  However, my family loved this.  My son said he would have some as an after school snack when he got home today, if there was any left.  This is not just spaghetti!

My whole family loved this, and it was simple to make. Even my daughter who won"t eat spaghetti had two pieces. It came out of the pan nice an clean. I doubled the recipe and filled a 9x13 pan, so I think my crust was a little thick, but it wasn"t dry at all, even though I didn"t add sauce or anything like some suggested. I liked it as is!

A winner! Family says it tastes like a cross between lasagna and pizza. I had spaghetti and homemade meat sauce left from a family get-together, so this was a GREAT way to use leftovers. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese just because I prefer the taste of ricotta in hot dishes. My other revisions: I had some already cooked pork sausage links in the freezer which I ground up and mixed in the sauce. I used a blend of Italian cheeses (mostly mozzarella) on top, and used more than the recipe called for in order to please my cheese loving family.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This is a fun recipe. It turns out really great. I used angel hair pasta which we prefer. My husband liked it and he supposedly does not like spaghetti! I made it in the 9 x 13 pan as suggested by others It's a keeper!

great dish and easy to make! I used left over spaghetti and just warmed it up in the microwave. The only changes I made were to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, one more clove of garlic, about 3 Tbsp. of fresh basil and 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning.

Have been doing this recipe for years and about the only thing different that I use is Italian sausage instead of hamburger.  Super recipe.

Great!!  The only changes I made were: omitting the peppers (picky kids), and used Prego heart smart sauce from the jar.  The noodles stuck together well and were perfect consistency.  Everyone loved it, including the picky girl (who normally WON'T eat beef of any sort) and the 18 month old baby.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love this recipe!  On the nights I really don't want to do much of anything, I use jarred sauce and frozen meatballs.  I just microwave the meatballs for 5 minutes so they are warm.

This was really simple and delicious!  Everyone in the house gave it a thumbs up.  The only thing I changed was I used spaghetti sauce from a jar and monterey jack cheese instead of the mozzarella because that is what I had on hand.  I did also blend the cottage cheese for a smoother texture, which turned out great.

*Many months later, now, I am still making this recipe.  Tonight I did it vegetarian style.  I put some olive oil in a skillet, added red onion, broccoli, Swiss chard, mushroom, yellow pepper and spinach and cooked until just tender, then added a jar of spaghetti sauce and simmered on med-low for a few minutes.  I made the rest of the "pie" as it is in the recipe, and it turned out awesome.  Just another way to enjoy this recipe!

My family like this very much, I thought it was delicious.  I used 1 jar of Wegmans store brand Roased Garlic Pasta Sauce, a full pound of pasta, 13x9 baking dish and I used cottage cheese like the recipe said, probable used slightly more than a cup. I added a little Italian seasoning, but the jar sauce was very flavorfull and I would use it again. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 than like five min after adding the mozzeralla cheese.  It cut very nice and when tossed around on my  plate to blend, it was like eating a really really good spagheti with meat sauce, the spagetti was cooked perfect. my bottom layer was not really crust like but we liked it that way, it had a real rich flavor, it was one of the best plates of spaghetti a ever ate, the cottage cheese gave it a subtle flavor that really made the dish.  Will make again. under cook you spaghetii just before  al dente.

This was extremely good.  I found the recipe was large enough to make 2 pies.  I added celery salt to the ground beef and salt and pepper to the spaghetti.  I wouldn't change a thing:)

This recipe is easily halved if you just want one pie pan full.  This is a good basic recipe and the "crust" turns out perfectly with the egg, butter and cheese.  I did use the cottage cheese (pureed first) and thought it turned out nicely (and healthier than ricotta).  A nice meatless modification is to saute spinach instead of beef.  Warning: as many have mentioned, the recipe is very bland so spice it up according to your tastes.

This was very good!  I added a tsp. of fresh basil and cut down on the oregano.  I used stewed tomatoes and half cottage cheese and half ricotta cheese and omitted the green pepper.  I will definitely make this again!

My husband and two year old really liked this.... I thought it was OK.  I used my own sauce, and prepared the spaghetti "crust" according to the recipe.  I thought the crust needed a little more flavor, maybe some extra garlic next time.

Very tastey. I used whole grain spaghetti and made it without meat, substituting chopped zucchini and yellow squash for the ground beef.  I had no green peppers on hand so made up for it with more garlic and onion.  Also added dried basil. A keeper.

I would recommend like another member suggested to omit the tomato paste and use a pasta sauce, or maybe half the amount of paste.  It was delicious but I thought the tomato paste was alittle overpowering,  I also added minced garlic...give this recipe a try.

This was delicious! I don't like cottage cheese so I used crumbled Feta instead. I also excluded the sugar and oregano because the diced tomato and paste that I bought had flavorings already. (Basil, Oregano, Garlic, Italian Seasonings.) This is the first recipe that turned out right the first time I cooked it. Super easy! I LOVE IT!

My husband and I just LOVED this! I tweaked the recipe a bit since I didn't have all the ingredients. I changed he cottage cheese to ricotta, and used half a jar of pasta sauce in place of the tomato paste and diced tomatoes. I also had a jar of minced garlic, so i just put 2 spoonfuls in! I eliminated the green pepper, because it did not sound yummy, and I put it all in a 9in pie plate bc it's spaghetti pie, not spaghetti pan! Yum yum, there were barely leftovers!

MUCH better than regular spaghetti! I used a 9x13 pan. Ricotta worked well for cottage cheese (but I'll bet the extra tang of cottage is better). I liked the high proportion of meat to noodles, and I was very pleased with the simple sauce...much better than spaghetti sauce! Try adding pepperoni! I chopped some and topped the casserole with it (took care of my pregnancy craving anyway) =)

This gets a 4 because the original recipe is fairly bland. (Yes, i made the original recipe initially...) Fortunately, it's easy to change to suit particular tastes. This time I used sweet italian sausage, omitted the green pepper, used a jarred marinara, but added a 1/4 tsp red pepper to spice it up a bit. Also I used about 1 cup mozzarella cheese on top. To increase the flavor factor, I also added some onion powder and garlic salt to the spaghetti mixture. Hubby and son loved it!! Nice presentation if you stick it under the broiler to get the cheese all brown and bubbly.

This tasted much better the next day as a leftover than it did the first day. It was a lot like spaghetti with meat sauce only with double the work.

We loved this!  Very easy to throw together.  Perfect with a salad and breadsticks.  I made this in the 9x13 pan as others did and couldn't believe my family nearly finished it!   Will definitely put this on the keeper list.  Thanks!

My mom used to make this when I was little, always a favorite! I added diced eggplant to the ground beef and replaced the cottage cheese with a layer of shredded italian cheeses.  I used a 1 lb box of spaghetti and was able to make 2 pies, one to eat and one to freeze.

My pickiest eaters loved this and continue to ask for it.  Very simple yet different way to eat spaghetti.  It's in my semi-regular rotation now . . . Thanks!

Excellent way to use up all that extra spaghetti!  I have been wanting to make this for years.I had homemade sauce & ricotta to use up and this was perfect.  I used a colby/jack cheese blend on top and it was fine.  I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning and salt & pepper to the ricotta as well as to the noodles too.  I will cook extra spaghetti just so I can make this more often!

Everyone loved this recipe!  Here's how I made it easier:  3 jars of "four cheese" store-bought sauce.  Added 1 lb. ground beef and 1 pound italian sausage sauteed with onions and garlic to the sauce.  Prepared everything else the same way.  FROZE BEAUTIFULLY and was a great shut-in meal for some friends.  I have already made 4 of these for my freezer!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe that can be easily customized. My family loves lots of garlic and onion, but not too much sauce. Great base recipe.

Pretty bland. I agree with another poster, it has potential. Next time I will switch out the tomato paste and tomatoes for spaghetti sauce. Then I think it will be worth 5 stars.

This was Great!  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce, and it turned out wonderful.  I'll definitely make this again, and make extra to freeze. I doubled the recipe and just used one big jar of sauce and it was perfect.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.

A great way to use leftovers.  I make a double batch of sauce once a month.  We have regular spaghetti, this and I freeze the rest for later in the month.  Thanks for the recipe.

I use my own meat sauce and I add italian seasoning to the cottage cheese.  I also use 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 light sour cream.  The best part of this is the noodles with the butter, cheese and eggs.

just ok.  I must have done something wrong.  Mine did not fit in a pie pan.  I would try it again, with some adjustments.  More flavors next time.  It has potential.

this was delicious! i'm always looking for something creative to do with spaghetti and adding things in there and i had seen something like this on a cooking show so i decided to try it. it was out of sight, my husband had three servings. i made enough to fit in a 9x13 pan. i added more garlic because i love garlic, and i used ricotta cheese instead of cottage because that's what i had. it was great and i'm looking forward to the leftovers, because spaghetti is always better the next day. thanks for this, it will be used regularly.

Very good, though I strayed a bit from the ingredients called for in the recipe.  I omitted the green peppers, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and used tomato sauce instead of the paste and chopped tomatoes - simply because I didn't have the proper ingredients on hand.  Next time I make this will definitely add green peppers for a bit more flavor.

I have made this again and again. "So good" and filling. Family and friends request quite often.  Serve with salad and garlic bread.  Make sure you let it sit for about 15 minutes before serving, as that helps it to hold together better.   At times I do use a jar of Prego sauce when I am short on time.

Very yummy! I like it with the cottage cheese better than the suggested ricotta which is a little heavy for this dish.  The texture is very good. Husband requests this often.

I usually use jarred spaghetti sauce.  I have been making this since mid 1970 when I found it in a Yankee magazine.  It is delicious and everyone always loves it. Sometimes I add sliced hot sausage for a little spice.

I was happy to find this recipe. I had made a version of this years ago and no longer had recipe.  It is pretty flexible.  Short on time?  Use your preferred  jarred spaghetti sauce.  I also add fresh spinach on top of cottage cheese to add color and nutrition.

I found this recipe as inspiration for using up the spaghetti leftovers.  I'll be sure to make too much on spaghetti night again.  The addition of the egg to the "crust" makes the difference in this version.  The whole pie holds together.

Followed recipe almost exactly, just added a little extra onion and mozzarella since I had it leftover. It actually kept its "pie" shape when sliced.  Meat sauce to noodle ratio was good.

Kids liked it except the "tomato chunks"; I might use crushed tomatoes next time or just spaghetti sauce.

Was a little bland for grown-up taste, needed salt and some red pepper flakes.  But that's easy to add after the fact.

A keeper!

I've been making this for years. The family loves it. The only difference is that I like to add a little parsley and garlic to my egg and parmesan mixture when I add it to my noodles.

Quick & easy dinner! I used whole wheat pasta which worked fine. I realized at the last moment I was out of cottage cheese so I subbed in sour cream. Also, in trying to eat less meat, I used a handful of chopped mushrooms and left out the beef. Lots of changes, I know but the concept and flavors were good. I think this is a great way to use up extra veggies and ingredients in the fridge! The spaghetti crust gets a nice crispy texture. I had to increase the time by 5 minutes for the cheese to get bubbly.

Love this recipe, made a sauce from scratch with fresh herbs and spices and simmered for 2-3 hours before making the  recipe. I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese Great make ahead freezes well!

I add some sauce to the spaghetti, helps keep it moister and more flavorful. I also used Prego and used a 9x13 or 9x9 when doing a family pan doubling or tripling the recipe.

I have made this pie three times in the last two weeks! My husband is addicted! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage and find it to be smoother, creamier and more appropriate for this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe, thanks!!! I used ricotta cheese instead of  cottage cheese. My husband. Would not eat if he found out it was cottage cheese.  He thought it was a great recipe!! The only  complaint was to use good ricotta next time, he is Italian. I bought what was on sale. Oops. Thanks for a great new recipe in our rotation!

This was delicious!  I did not alter the recipe except for adding salt and pepper to the meat mixture as other reviewers suggested and used 1 tablespoon Italian mix seasoning since I did not have plain oregano.  I used 8 oz spaghetti and baked it in a 9x9 stoneware baking dish.  It was soooo good!!

I made this and it turned out yummy! I substituted rica cheese for cottage cheese because I wasn't sure cottage cheese would be very good in pasta. I also used vegetarian crumble instead of ground beef. But no one noticed!  This was quick, easy and very tasty short cut/ alternative to lasagna.

So I figured this recipe would be good in preparation for spring break - wouldn't have to mess up dishes before going out of town and I could chomp it all week. So, I made a pretty huge "pie". But this was AH-ma-zin!! Someone called this "lazy lasagna" and that's exactly how I approached it. I used an entire pound pack of spaghetti and combined it with almost all of a pound of ricotta cheese. Mixed it all in with the egg, parm and butter and added some dried parsley. Topped the pasta layer with remaining ricotta. For the meat mixture I used both beef and hot Italian sausage and seasoned it up to ensure lots of flavor! Then added tomato paste and prepared spaghetti sauce. Y'all. This was SO good.

01-10-16 ~ Had a busy day and was looking for something quick for dinner.  This fit the bill and was delicious.  I made a double batch and made 4 small pans, enough to serve 2 people per pan.  I shared with my son and DIL, parents, and in-laws.  I like that it came together quickly, and froze nicely.  Served it with a tossed salad and dinner was on the table in no time.

I wouldn't make this again. I was not impressed with the sauce. The layering of the spaghetti, cottage cheese and mozzarella were fine. I didn't find that much difference in taste between this recipe and Spaghetti Pie I by Kimberly.

Bake the crust for 5 minutes  before adding the filling. It's soggy otherwise. Also, you can use bottled spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato mixture. My daughter's favorite meal!

My 11yr old daughter surprised me with this for supper one night. She added a package of Taco Seasoning and used spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoes and tomato paste. It was Fantastic! The taco seasoning added a great twist to it.

There are two things I like the most about this recipe: 1) It's easy to follow and substitute. 2) It's tasty, tasty, tasty.

I needed something relatively quick to make for dinner the other day and came up with the spaghetti pie, which I have never made before. So I searched for an easy solution.

Since I don't like ricotta or cottage cheese in foods (regardless of whether I can see chunks or not! YUCK. LOL) I searched for a substitution and came up with nothing until I saw a comment that said soft tofu and I knew that would definitely work for me. Of course I didn't have any of that either and wanted to use what I had on hand so I just used extra grated Parmesan and shredded mozzarella. 

I seasoned everything with a bit more than I usually do to ensure the flavor was throughout the entire pie. I used dashes of salt (which I don't use a lot), pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, Old Bay seasoning and a pizza seasoning (basil, etc. all in one). I also used chopped frozen onions.

In order to get an actual pie look I place the noodles on the bottom of the pie plate then using my fingers added noodles in a circle around the edges of the dish. The meat mixture went in the center and I spread it out enough to leave about an inch of crust showing.

Overall, it was a hit because even my children enjoyed it. It's definitely a dish I will prepare again using different ingredients and in its original form.

This recipe needs more spice and seasoning. Definitely needs salt in the noodles as well as the ground beef mixture. Next time, I'd also like to use Italian tomatoes rather than plain ones.
Update 2-24-16: I made just the sauce browning Italian hot sausage, celery, garlic, and onion. Then I added the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp basil, and 1 tsp sugar.  Really good sauce. I served it over spaghetti squash and topped with mozzarella.

This recipe is a fun spin on spaghetti night.  It's a versatile recipe that's easy to adjust with what you have on hand.  I've made it from scratch and from leftovers.  I've added the cottage cheese and left it out.  It's seems to turn out tasty no matter what I do.

Love this recipe! I always make this when I have to take a meal to someone.  My hubby is not a fan of cottage cheese or ricotta, so I always use a packet of cream cheese.  Love the taste it gives the spaghetti!

Made this last night for dinner, but a reduced calorie version, using ground turkey and fat free cottage cheese. It was delicious.

I really liked this dish. I gave it 5 stars even though I had to change it. I got it started and discovered I'd used all my diced tomatoes; all I had was a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I followed directions otherwise and it was good. My picky eater did not care for it but every one else did. My son even ate seconds. I want to try this again with correct ingredients. But my improvised edition was very good.

Incredibly good! I was amazed at how the pasta settled into such a great crust. I substituted my homemade Italian pork sausage for the ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe. Cottage cheese worked just fine. Thanks so much for sharing this.

The only thing I did differently was to use a jar of ready made spaghetti. With the cottage cheese I blended it in my food processor with some mozzarella and oregano. It made a great texture. My family loved this meal! Definitely will be adding more veggies into the meat part next time.

I have loved this dish since I was a kid and this is the first time I am making it for my 5 year old daughter. I made my own gravy (sauce) with sausage instead of using the ingredients in the recipe and it was delish! My daughter doesn't like a lot of sauce, but absolutely loves pasta. This is the perfect combo for picky kids. Yum!

I was looking for a recipe that my parents made growing up and this one was similar. I followed it to the T (except added a bit more spice to the sauce -- red pepper, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper) and it turned out great. Just what I was craving!

This was easy and used up my leftover Spaghetti .  I did cheat a little and used part of a can of pasta sauce as it was already open and in the fridge.  I have also made and frozen these for a quick dinner during the week.

Very good, as is. If you're using spaghetti sauce from a jar in place of the original ingredients you're missing out. It really doesn't take that much longer to open and dump the cans of tomato paste and tomatoes and throw in the spices. SO much better than a jarred sauce imo. Also no issues here with the eggs scrambling. Just strain your pasta, add butter in first and stir, then parmesan and stir, then gradually add the eggs in a little at a time stirring, quickly. I think all the stirring with each addition cools the pasta enough to temper ok. Such a nice baked spaghetti. Thanks OP!

Good! I have never made a recipe like this and it was great! I didn't have cottage cheese so I just layered some parm cheese and the family loved it! I also made sauce from scratch. I didn't follow the recipe.

Sooooooooooo good! I made some small changes-- 8 ounces pasta, used Romano cheese since I prefer it, and went the easy route with a jar of marinara sauce. It was too much to fit in my pie plate so I used a 9x13 dish. I used 2 cups cottage cheese since it was a bigger dish, and topped with about 2 cups shredded pizza cheese blend. It was a little soupy when I first took it out of the oven (maybe because I didn't really cook the sauce with the meat ahead of time?) but it seems to have set up well, and it tasted AMAZING! The egg, cheese and butter really give the "crust" a rich and deep flavor. This couldn't have come out any better, thanks so much for a great recipe!

This recipe is pretty darn good.  I made a couple of small changes to accommodate taste and what I had on hand.  I had mini pepperonis to use up so I used those instead of the ground beef.  I added some italian spices because we like spicy food but otherwise followed the directions to a T.  It was easy and fun to make.  Thank you for posting this one we really enjoyed it.

I was trying to give it 3.5 stars. I didn't do everything as stated but it's not the recipe's fault. I WAS JUST VERY "THANKFUL" for the idea of 'baking' a spaghetti dish. Yes, I agree with the lady that says we shdn't rate w/o doing recipe exactly but I had to 'rate it' or I couldn't enter my comments. I wd like to hv it come out less dry but will never make spaghetti the 'regular' way again. TERRIFIC IDEA. I do a LOTTT of baking/cooking (I'm widowed and love to experiment..my poor 63 yr young boyfriend gets to taste my 'lessons'....ha ha.

Easy and very tasty! As simple baked pasta dish, but very attractive when it comes out of the oven.  Mine didn't really cut into wedges or anything but I wasn't really expecting it to.  I only had 1/2 pound of ground beef so I chopped up a bunch of mushrooms and added them to the saute pan, had no tomato paste so I just skipped it, and I used 1/2 cup egg substitute for the eggs.  I used leftover spaghetti that had just a little sauce on it, too. I had grated a little extra parmesan, so I sprinkled that on top before baking.  Very tasty dish - one that I will definitely make again!  Thanks Jennifer!

this recipe requires everyday ingredients and is still very good. much easier than making lasagna. i loved how dense the bottom noodle layer got. i had never heard of spaghetti pie before but i am really glad i tried it. i made it with spicy italian venison sausage

Good recipe...easy to make lighter by using 2% cheese and ground turkey.  Also, I used a jar of tomato sauce and it worked great.

Really easy and nice! I didn't add too much bell pepper and I used an orange pepper. I also used Fire Roasted diced tomatoes with garlic. It needed a little salt, in my opinion. I will make it again for sure!

Yum-o! Just what I was looking for! I also used a jar of Spaghetti sauce because I was in a big rush, and left out the cottage cheese, but the noodle "crust" was the one I had made before and lost the recipe.  Thanks!!

Very good recipe for quick nite meal. Easy clean as you go type recipe as well (hey what ever works for the week nites right?)I personally added double the amount of ricotta and it was too much (yeah, I know there is never too much cheese in something)but it did make it to soupy so next time I will follow the recipe to the T!

FABULOUS! I also made this in a 9x13 pan, I have two teenage boys so a pie plate size would never feed all four of us!  They loved this recipe, I will definitely be making it again.  I did use a jar of Prego sauce just because I didn't have the other ingredients to make my own as the recipe calls for.

I made this recipe last night for my husband, kids and Aunt.  Everyone really liked it!! I made the recipe exactly as instucted, except I added a little basil.  The best part was I was able to make it ahead of time so I just had to pop it in the oven.  I was able to enjoy my guest!

This was the first time I've made spagetti pie, it was pretty good and the family liked it. I made it with a few adjustments to make it easier. I use a jar of spagetti sauce, omited the green pepper (because family doesn't like), and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. The top of the 'pie' was very flavorful while the bottom (crust and cheese) was a little bland. Next time I will try addings some seasoning to the crust and cheese, maybe salt and pepper to the crust and some italian seasoning to the cheese layer.

This recipe is great for families, and easily adaptable to your family's special tastes.  The only change I made was using ricotta rather than cottage cheese.  My toddler ate this well (picking out the peppers) but given how hard it is for me to get her to eat protein this was wonderful!!  My husband, who hates all casserole type things on principle, graded it as okay. (Trust me this a great compliment).  I did have trouble fitting the ingredients into a pie plate though -- stuffed it in a quiche dish quite successfully.

It was really good. I sauted the onion and garlic and then add ground beef. I adedd garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and salt and curry.I couldn't imagine the meat without any seasoning!!
I added alot more mozzarela cheese into the spagetti.It tasted really good with cottage cheese.

Simmered one 15 oz can tomato sauce and once 6oz of tomato paste together with 1 1/2 TBSP spicy spaghetti seasoning (Sams club),  added cooked drained hamburger instead of diced tomatoes and I left out the onions (substituted onion powder) and green peppers as D/H doesn't like them, otherwise I followed the rest of the recipe.  This is a great addition to the meal rotation.  We both loved it.

Really liked this though it was more of a casserole and not much of a spaghetti crust.

I used ground turkey and jarred spaghetti sauce with some garlic and italian seasoning and it was awesome!!  I'll add some turkey pepperoni next time.  It was really good!!

I took a lot of others suggestions. I added more onion, green pepper, garlic, oregano, basil, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and used italian sausage instead of ground beef and still found it kind of bland. I didn't care for the ground sausage and didn't feel the ricotta added anything. My family loved it. They thought I was nuts. Next time spice, but will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! I did make a few changes - I used my own simple homemade sauce (ground turkey, Italian style crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic & Italian seasoning) and I added oregano & black pepper to the cottage cheese. I also like to cook a little extra spaghetti than what this calls for & use a 9x13 glass pan, as my family doesn't like the cottage cheese layer to be too thick. It's definitely a favorite!

This turned out perfect.  It's one of those can't-mess-it-up dishes.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I just used spaghetti sauce from a jar and omitted the green peppers.  Quick, easy, and fuss-free.  Will surely make again.

This was quite bland and a bit dry.  This might be improved with simply using Italian Sausage instead of ground beef, leave out the tomato paste and add a can of Rotel but I really think for our spicy taste buds we would need a lot more change than that.

Really great.  I used ricotta cheese, pepper jack and leftover pasta sauce.  Great way to use up leftover spaghetti (or angel hair pasta.)

I too, used a jar of spaghetti sauce and made it in a 9x13.  It was great, even my picky 4 year old liked it!  Thanks, this has now become a regular at our house!

I used my own modifications to the sauce (red wine instead of sugar, basil, etc.). Beyond that, it tasted like my own spaghetti done a little differently. The "crust" is the highlight of this recipe. The entire family like it a lot. We'll be doing this recipe again.

Very easy and quick.  A meal for the family to enjoy.  Personally, I would double the meat next time.

This was good: it's spaghetti with cheese, afterall. My husband liked it more than spaghetti, because he "didn't have to fight with the noodles"(it cuts so easily with a fork into bite size pieces.) However, we didn't like it more than baked penne, so I doubt I'd make this again.

my husband gave this a two , i gave it a four so we settled on three. wasnt flavorful enough. the spaghetti needs something more then just butter, eggs, and parm.  maybe ill try adding garlic into that mixture also and a marinara sauce. it was easy to make though on a weekday and a fun way for kids to eat pasta without making a mess.

This has become our "go-to" recipe for using up our leftover spagetti sauce and pasta!  We're not big on warmed up leftovers so this creates a new meal with the same ingredients! I have changed the recipe slightly to make it easier (and I think tastier!). Because I use my leftover meat sauce, I don't have to make that.  I use pre-made pesto that I keep in the freezer and add a large spoonful of pesto to the eggs.  This adds the seasoning and cheese all in one step, plus it adds its own unique taste. I sometimes add a pinch of italian seasonings to the cottage cheese, too. Thanks for a great encore recipe that uses up leftovers but tastes like a whole new meal.

I thought this recipe was wonderful-easy too!  I was looking for something to spice up our weekly spaghetti routine.  This worked great.  However, I did make some "adjustments."  Instead of spaghetti noodles I used small shells.  I also used mexican fiesta diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro, along with doubling the amount of tomato paste.  Of course, since I don't measure, I did have to use a casserole dish.  This was a HIT with the whole family...very rich and flavorful.

The good thing about this recipe is that you can prepare everything well in advance, and simply assemble and put it in the oven when ready. However, while the flavor was no different to my usual spagetti and meat sauce, baking it in the oven really dried it out. As I am not usually pushed for time in the kitchen, I'll stick with making spag my usual way. Thanks anyway!

I was a little unsure about this, but it turned out great.  I kicked up the seasonings as others suggested and also made it in a 9x13 (changed recipe to 9 servings).  I'm planning on making it again tonight for a potluck party.  I'm only going to reduce the amount of spaghetti noodles on the bottom.  I eyed it the first time and I think it was a bit too thick.  Thanks for the great recipe.

For taste, I would give this recipe 4-stars. However, the ease and time involved in making the recipe bumps it up to 5-stars. I replaced the ground beef with italian sausage. I also replaced the onion, pepper, tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar and oregano with a jar of Ragu. This is a recipe that will be used in our house on busy school nights.

This is pretty tasty. My very picky about "spaghetti" husband even liked it. I used extra lean ground beef, lowfat cottage cheese and used ready made sauce because this is a weeknight and I was a little lazy. Oh and no green peppers for this family! Guess that's all. It's worth a shot. Will probably make again but not often. Thanks.

All I have to say is 5+ stars since my whole family enjoyed this. I have a lot of picky eaters & it's not often that one meal makes everyone happy. I did use Ragu & riccota as suggested & also baked for 35 minutes;
broiling at 450 degrees the last 5-10 min as we like our cheese a little browned on top.  Thanks Jennifer! I will be making this again.

This was excellent.  The only thing I did differently was I used 2 cloves garlic instead of 1.  I also used less parmesan cheese since I can't stand the strong taste/smell of paremsan.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is a quick, easy, and delicious twist on traditional spaghetti.  I used angel hair pasta and I added sliced mushrooms to the beef/tomato mixture, and it tasted delicious!  I plan on making this recipe over and over again!

We loved this!  Very quick and easy recipe.  I doubled the recipe.  I substituted 1 lb andouille sausage and 1 lb of grilled chicken in place of the ground beef.  I think it should be made the night before to allow the flavoring to penetrate.  It was GREAT the following day!  Served with French bread, olive oil and parmesan cheese and fresh field greens - yum-yum!  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

This is a great recipe, so easy and very yummy!!  I always have spaghetti on hand in a Tupperware container so I wasn't sure how much 6 oz. was, 5-6 handfuls worked out about right though.
