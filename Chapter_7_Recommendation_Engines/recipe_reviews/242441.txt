This was really good. The steak was perfect. We used the really soft handmade flour tortillas from Trader Joe's, and m;y second fajita I didn't even put sour cream (aka Greek yogurt) and salsa on so that the flavor of the main ingredients could shine through.

Great way to make fajitas.  Keeps all heat outside, not in kitchen.  Season to taste.
