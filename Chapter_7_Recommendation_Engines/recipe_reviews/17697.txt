Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I checked it at 35 minutes but it wasn't quite done, so I baked it a few minutes longer. I didn't use icing, but served it slightly warmed with vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

I thought this was great - something different then the norm with a lot of different textures and tastes. Our family loved it! We did have to bake it about 7 min longer then listed. Wouldn't change it.

This is a very dense, moist, and chewy cake that almost has the consistency of a brownie.  It's delicious!  Does need an additional 5-10 minutes to fully bake.

I omitted the white sugar entirely, added some extra chocolate chips and used the coconut (toasted) on top of the cake instead of in the batter.  True to its name, this cake was surprisingly quick to make.  Since I halved the recipe, my bake time was 23 min.

My new favorite cake.  Perfect chewy texture with the burst of chocolate and subtle cinnamon flavor.  I topped this with a cream cheese frosting with mini chocolate chips mixed in, and it was absolutely fabulous!

I tried this recipe as an easier variation to chocolate chip coconut cookies, and it is good!  This cake has a nice, chewy texture, good flavor, and is simple to make.  My only issue was that I had to bake it a bit longer than the listed time; I only hope I can try to make the recipe a little healthier, too.

wonderfully easy and so good. we found it a little too sweet with cream cheese frosting but agree it would be wonderful warm from the oven with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Super easy and delicious. I made it as cupcakes and used whole wheat flour and broken up pieces of ghirardelli intense dark chocolate. I didn't add the nuts, coconut, or chocolate on top. It was really moist and sweet enough already so I didn't use frosting. My 2 year old loves them =)

If you love oats and chocolate like I do, you'll love this cake!  My only complaint: it didn't cut and serve very nicely.  But it went from fingers to mouth for the most part anyway!

This was very different.  The recipe said the cake was spicy so I only used half the cinnamon, because I have a sensitive stomach.  I added the optional nut (chopped pecans).  This tasted like a mix of an oatmeal cookies, a chocolate chip cookie, and a blonde brownie.  It is both soft and chewy, like a cake, cookie, and a brownie.  It tastes good but, I think the name is a little misleading in taste and texture. It did bake up nicely.  However, I think I will be sharing this with some kids down the street.  As this is a little too many sweets mixed together for me, with the 2 cups of sugar and full 12oz bag of chocolate chips it took to make it.  I am sure though those kids will enjoy it.

I was looking for a quick cake and this one is pretty quick; just tried a sample fresh out of the oven and it is nice and moist but I'm not sure I care for the cinnamon taste, might leave it out if I make it again. I am a chocoholic so might try adding some cocoa next time. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added some wheat germ and ground flax to make it healthier (about 1/4 cup and only 3/4 cup coconut)
