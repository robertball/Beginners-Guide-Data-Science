Wow. What a fabulous take on shrimp and grits. This is like you get in finer restaurants. The second time I prepared, I added 1/2 of a diced yellow pepper to the initial saute and a 1/2 a cup of diced ham when the shrimp went in. Used mild cheddar shredded instead of the processed cheese. The recipe is great as posted but will be fun to play around with. Thanks for posting.

This was delicious.  I added more garlic and was scant on the cayenne since I'm not crazy about hot stuff.  I used quick grits which require less water.

I had this at s party catered my a chef from Texas.  It was fabulous yet I couldn't find any recipes that seemed right.  I only made one change - I used cheddar cheese because I think it has a much better flavor.  It turned out great and the family loved it.  Next time I'll add some crumbled bacon to make it more like the recipe I had before.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good. I did cook my grits in milk, it makes a huge difference on the flavor and richness of the meal. I will add an extra green onion next time, just personal preference. The only thing I added was some old bay seasoning. This is a keeper for sure. Be great with some nice crusty bread on the side.

Overall, an OK dish. I really wish there was just a little more flavor.  I kept thinking it needed some more sauce or something to take it up notch.

Loved it! NOLAMom, my husband has requested this dish on a regular basis! He loves omlets for brunch, but he loves this more! I didn't have green onions on hand, so I subbed with vidalia onions and chives. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Followed the recipe and “OMG” it was amazing!! The Cayenne pepper added a little kick. My only adjustment was using cheddar cheese and cooking my grits in chicken broth. Kudos to the creator of this recipe. Again absolutely amazing...

I seasoned the shrimp with cajun seasoning and lemon zest, added some mixed bell peppers and shredded some sharp cheddar instead of processed cheese.  Recipe was simple, yet tasty.

Thanks for the recipe darlin'. I've been looking for a shrimp and grits recipe up here in Misery (Missouri). This was by far the best that I've found on here. Didn't change a thing (well maybe I wanted a little more heat and added a bit more Cayenne to it) other than that. I was well satisfied with the outcome.

This was very yummy and easy to make! I was able to make it spur of the moment. Unfortunately, I had to use a cheese packet (from boxed mac & cheese - dont judge me! Lol) for the grits. My fresh cheese had expired ??. But it turned out great in spite of that. So I'm sure it will be even better when I try with actual cheese.

This is the best shrimp and grits I have ever made!  So easy!  I added a few diced sweet peppers to mine.  I also use half milk in the grits - makes them so good!

Ok, I just saved and printed this recipe! So so good! My hubby raved the entire time we were eating this! I doubled the garlic, cut a tablespoon of butter from both parts, used a minced yellow onion instead of the scallions (none in the house), and used shredded cheddar instead of the Velvita (again, none in the house). This recipe is an Ash Wednesday win, and we will be making it again and again!

This is totally delicious, very rich and satisfying. The only change I made was to crumble one slice of cooked bacon into the shrimp as it cooked since I did not have any cheese sauce. I will definitely make this again.... soon!

I used Polenta instead of grits (I lived in Georgia for a while and "southern ice cream" kind of freaked me out!).   I took suggestions from all the reviews...added bacon to the shrimp, used cheddar cheese, chicken broth, milk (I guess polenta is thicker than grits?...so I needed more liquid).  By itself, I found I'm not a huge fan of polenta either...but together, the shrimp and polenta are a taste sensation!  
P.S. I did add a splash of hot sauce to give it a little more edge.  Two thumbs up from hubby and son.  Great new go-to for cold winter days!

I've made this multiple times.  The beauty of the recipe is its simplicity.  Personally, I'm not into jazzing it up with bacon, peppers, etc.  Adjust the richness with the amount of butter added.  I've tried using sharp cheddar and the flavor is good, but the creaminess of the grits suffers as it sits.  I think using the sharp Velveeta might be the perfect compromise.   A mixed green salad is the perfect accompaniment.   The key is to be get it on the table quickly in individual bowls (I use shallow European-style soup bowls).

Added some bacon before cooking the shrimp and reduced the butter to compensate. Served with steamed green beans. Great easy recipe for a weeknight meal!

This was great! The only thing I changed was to not add the extra butter to the grits, I just used what was in the saute mixture.

This was fantastic!  I must admit it was my first time making grits and I was a little concerned but they turned out great.  Using dry old fashion (not instant or quick grits), they took the full 20 minutes to cook.  I skipped the extra 1/4c.  of butter at the end and just added sliced white American cheese (8 slices).  I also added an extra green onion as suggested and stirred in a chopped tomato for a little color.  It was perfect.
