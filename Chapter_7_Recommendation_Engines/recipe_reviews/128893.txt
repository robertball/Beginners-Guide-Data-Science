I love this recipe!  The flavors are wonderful and quinoa has a great lightness and fluffiness that acts as a fabulous base to present the gingery, spicy flavors of the mixture.

I have a friend who has a restricted gluten-free diet but always loved the flavors and coziness of stuffing so this has been popular with her, but also with the rest of the potluck crowd when I have made it.

I love how versatile the dish is too - you can substitute margarine for the butter and eliminate the cheese to make it a vegan dish; you can add nuts or a dried fruit (currants for example) to the stuffing; you can experiment with other kinds of cheese (I've used goat before and it worked well).

This is not very good. It is quite sweet, not at all savory. If you do make it, I would recommend cutting the apple pieces very small, and not using as much cinnamon as the recipe suggests.

This is a great recipe, I cook my squash in the microwave and then get everything else ready. I would suggest reducing the amount of sugar a little bit, it can be slightly sweet. 

The mozarella cheese is a good complement to the flavors in the squash. Yumm!

This is very tasty. I recommend cutting back on the ginger and cinnamon a tad....I made it with the amounts called for and feel it needed less of each. I had a very small apple-so in addition to the apple I added some dried cherries which I soaked first in white wine. I used the white wine instead of vinegar called for. I also used parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella because that is what I had on hand. It turned out perfectly! I topped the dish with chopped toasted almonds before serving......so good. My hubby and I both enjoyed this dish and will make it again and again!

The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because my husband wasn't as impressed as I.  I loved the crunch of the nuts, the tang of the ginger and the sweetness of the squash.  I'll be making this again for sure!

The Calculation for 2 was enough for 4. We used 2 acorn squash (4 halves).  Served with a salad, one half per person !was plenty

This is a wonderful dish! I've served it at fall/winter dinners when we have large gatherings. Cutting each into quarters allows for a sampling of flavor rather than it being a full meal. The combination of flavors is always a pleasant surprise for guests...yum.

This dish is wonderful.  As the name implies it is full of ginger flavor.  My boyfriend thought the ginger would be overpowering (whereas I LOVE ginger).  Turns out he thought it was perfect and I think it might be a bit much.  However, the ginger is a perfect match to the apples.  

This is a very inexpensive dish.  Especially if you already have the quinoa on hand, as we did.

The quinoa comes out so fluffly.  Yes, you have extra stuffing which we are going to serve as a breakfast side dish.

I love this recipe every time I make it.  Sometimes I add more veggies, sometimes I make more quinoa.  One thing I've always found, my cup runneth over.  There's always way more filling than could possibly fit into two acorn squash halves.  In fact this time around, the squash was a little smaller than I've normally used, so I'm not stuffing them at all, just scooping all the squash I can into the pan to stir in.

This is a favourite.  Just a note, I decided I wanted it for lunch tomorrow, so I'm just finishing cooking, and it's almost midnight.  It's THAT good!

This recipe was mediocre to my tastes.  I am not a big fan of quinoa but I was hoping to find a recipe that helped me enjoy it.  Also I found that a whole piece of ginger was way too overpowering and less than half would be adequate.  If I make this again I'll substitute brown rice for the quinoa.

I only give this 4 stars because hubby wasn't crazy about it, but I thought it was fantastic.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so used powdered, but can't wait to try it again with the real stuff -maybe when he's out of town ;)

I was a bit disappointed. This is missing something- perhaps some vegetable or chicken broth (or even apple cider?) poured over the squash while it is in the oven for the last time.

I made this recipe just about as is, but I added sausage and omitted the sugar.  I thought the sausage added a heartiness to make it a complete meal.  Also, I used 3 acorn squash, filled to overflowing.  Great recipe!

Interesting recipe! Read the other reviews and held back on the sugar and spices. Used stevia (1 tsp) and Chinese 5 spice with a little cinnamon. Use raisin soaked in wine since I didn't have any apples. Think apples would have been better. Need to use more cheese - I used combination of Parmesan and mozzarella. I liked the salty vs sweet play. Will make it again as it's a healthy and quite filling meal.

filling enough for four to 6 halves (acorn squash are small). Too much quinoa (1/3 instead of 2/3 cup) and too much ginger. 1/8th the amount would still give it a touch of ginger without overpowering the other healthy ingreatients. Also it was dry. Add butter or oliver oil. We pass on this one.

i think i overestimated what 2 inches of ginger looks like - so i docked the recipe a star because i feel like it should have measured the ginger in something like tablespoons... mine came out so gingery i couldn't even eat it - and i love ginger! my husband ate it though... and i really liked the rest of it though! :)

It was just okay. This was a lot of work for what it turned out to be. There is too much quinoa and too much ginger. The ginger should have a better measurement in this recipe. I will not be making again.

Deleted celery and added instead carrot and mushroom. Didn't use any sugar and added a bit of cumin and curry. Yummy! Also, easily filled 2 squash halved (4 pieces). Topped with curried toasted cashews.

Just made this tonight. I gave it four stars because it's good but not spectacular. You can probably use half the amount of quinoa the recipe calls for. I had a lot of filling left over. I also used cheddar cheese since we didn't have any mozzarella. In the future I will mix some cheese in with the filling as well as sprinkling it on top.

On the advice of other comments, I used about half the ginger and I'm glad I did.  I think it would have been overpowering with any more.  I thought this dish was pretty good, but not great.  I baked my acorn squash for 30 minutes and it was over-baked (mushy and brown).  I'm sure this would have tasted better if the squash was not overbaked.

Will definitely make again. I substituted carrots for the celery. I agree with a couple other reviewers about cutting hack on the ginger. Other than that, I thought it was great.

I didn't measure anything out, except the quinoa, of which I only used 1/2 cup (precooked). This turned out absolutely delicious, and although it wasn't my first time eating quinoa, it was my first time eating acorn squash. And I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! :) By the way, I preroasted 4 squash halves, and with reducing the quinoa, the amount was perfect for the squash I had. Thanks for a great recip!
