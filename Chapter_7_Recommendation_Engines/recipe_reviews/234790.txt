This was my first attempt at a green bean casserole. I have to say, this recipe was incredibly easy and pretty much fool-proof. No one had seen a green bean casserole topped with mashed potatoes before, but my whole family thought it was a nice touch.

The only thing I added to the recipe was just a little bit of garlic powder in the soup (added in with the pepper), and a little bit more just mixed into the potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the instant potatoes. Also, the potatoes soaked up a bit of the soup in the casserole, which added to their flavor.

I was skeptical about making a green bean casserole for Christmas, but I'm glad I chose this one. It was a hit! Overall, I give this recipe 4 stars for being quick, easy, and tasty, but it could have used maybe a few more seasonings just to make the flavors pop a bit more. I think the garlic was a nice addition.

This was very good.  It is a step up from your "standard" green bean casserole.

This was my first green bean casserole but I changed it a lot as I don't have canned beans or instant potatoes. I cooked up some homemade mashed potatoes and chopped my green beans first. I steamed my green beans and I definitely cooked more than the recipe called for so I grabbed a 2 qt baking dish. I combined the soup, a bit more milk than what's asked, added some extra garlic powder, mixed in some shredded cheese and some pre-cooked chopped onion (fried in butter- 1 small white onion). I used French's Ranch fried onions but only mixed in about a 1/4 cup. Mixed everything up, poured in dish, and followed the rest of the recipe as suggested (but I also topped with some cheddar cheese). It was great!

This recipe was easy and family loved it. Although I don't use instant potatoes for recipes, boiling up my own and adding garlic and fresh pepper, just made it better!
