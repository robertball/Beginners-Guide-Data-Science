These cookies turned out great!!!!  I used parchment paper w/no extra greasing and were very easily removed.  I decided to wrap them around a dowel and dipped one end in semi-sweet chocolate.  The only downside is you need to do these in small batches--5 cookies at a time, but it's worth it.

I followed the recipe exactly and for some unknown reason my lace cookies did not spread to look like lace. Will not make again.
