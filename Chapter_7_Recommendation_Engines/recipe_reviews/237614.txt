Used recipe as was. Deleted celery, added red bell pepper and basil to garnish.  GREAT.

Even after adding salt and pepper it was still on the bland side. I used fresh mushrooms and added a couple of handfuls of spinach that I needed to use up. I substituted the cashews with butter drizzled panko bread crumbs. Don't think we will be craving this anytime soon.

My husband and son loved it.  I would suggest making it in an 8x8pan and not 9x13.

GREAT! 
Didn't have celery so I used celery salt and it turned out great.

Since I read the reviews, I added Old Bay Seasoning to the hamburger and I added a bayleaf to the soup mixture to give it some extra flavor. It still seemed to need something though.
