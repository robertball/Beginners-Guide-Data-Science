My Mom used to make a variation of this recipe when I was younger so I was thrilled when I found it!  I made it without the white wine and used brown sugar instead of white.  We had it for dinner and my husband ate 5 pieces of chicken!

I am on a new eating plan called Michael Thurmon's 6 Week Body Make Over.  It includes a LOT of chicken.  With a little alteration, this recipe was wonderful.  I omitted the corn syrup, used lite soy sauce, brown sugar substitute instead of the white sugar, 1 tsp. minced garlic instead of the garlic powder, and used chicken tenderloins.  I placed all this in a ziplock bag and marinated overnight.  The next morning I cooked it in my generic George Foreman grill.  It was F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S.

Ok, I tuned it up a bit, I added 1 teaspoon of minced fresh garlic, 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, extra cornsyrup, and some cornstarch (the juice from the chicken made the sauce not sticky anymore) also, I was out of white wine, so I used triple sec. everyone who ate them said they were delish, I will make again for my husband, he ate them all up.

Good but not great.  My chicken never got "sticky" and there was twice as much liquid in the end.  Will keep looking.  Thanks anyway.

These were good.  I added some grated fresh ginger to give it a little kick.  I had the same problem that others did with the sauce not getting sticky, so the second time making these I only put half the sauce on the chicken and the other half I reduced on the stove.  I then added the reduced sauce the last 1/2 of the cooking time....sticky results.  Thanks for a new recipe.

The whole family liked this chicken. I made it with chicken thighs and boneless breast pieces as this is what I had on hand. I marinated overnight before transferring to pan and baking. The chicken was so tasty and flavorful. I thickened the leftover pan juices with cornstarch and used to put over rice served with the meal. MY husband really loved it.  Will make again using the drummies sometimes!

Everyone loved my old chicken wing recipe, but I was getting tired of making it. I tried this recipe, now my family/friends are asking me to make these.  They are absolutely delicious and very easy!  A++

I make this about once a week, the only thing I change is I use a teaspoon of the jarred garlic / ginger paste from the grocery store instead of garlic powder. I usually make it with 1 pound of drumettes for the kids and a few chicken thighs for me and my husband. We all love it!

Oh my gosh! The easiest & best! I also added 1 cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and turned during cooking to get the brown color all over. My kids LOVED it!

Great flavor but I should have taken one of the reviewer's advice and just put 1/2 the sauce on the chicken and thicken the other 1/2 on the stove with some cornstarch. I also added the fresh ginger. I actually didn't have wings so used this sauce on a pan of drumsticks and everyone loved it.

I followed this recipe completely, though it never got sticky and the amount of liquid was twice as much as the chicken. I enjoy soya sauce, but I feel this was just too much soya.

This was outstanding!  Most definitely holy delicious!  Even the pickiest eaters were pleased!  I'm thrilled with the taste and plan on making it again and again!  I only had boneless chicken breasts on hand.  This worked perfectly fine with thin chicken breasts.  Everything about this dish was everything I hoped it would be! Thank you so much for sharing xoxoxoxo
