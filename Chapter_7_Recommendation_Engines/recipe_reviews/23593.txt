I made this before and this time I made a couple changes. I added 1/2 cup of water to the stuffing mixture because last time it was too dry. I also bought 3 pounds of mushrooms (but only used stems from 2 pounds of the mushrooms). It turned out to be the perfect amount of stuffing! I will definitately be making this again. My friends once again raved over this recipe.

I agree that it lacked a little "zip." Next time I will use more cheese and sausage instead of ground beef.

excellent stuffed mushrooms.  I substituted italian flavored sausage for beef to give a little extra zing.  I used very large stuffing mushrooms, so I added a little water to the casserole while baking to ensure the mushroom was cooked through and not dried out.  The cheese and bell peppers really make this recipe special.

Great recipe for stuffed mushrooms. I used half hot italian sausage and half ground beef. I ended up having lots of filling left over so we used it as a stuffing for omelette the next morning with great results.

Simple enough to make.  I thought they were very good. My husband wasn't all that excited 'bout them but his complaint was that I used the giant mushroom caps and they were "too much, too large". So that's really nothing to do with the recipe.

I used turkey sausage instead of beef.  Good recipe.  Lots of room for personalization.  They did lack a little zing.

This was a very good recipe. I only made one change and that was to add an egg. It helped bind the ingredients together. Very easy to make.

Great recipe - but margarine, erm, no! It has to be butter - it's a natural product after all. And whenever you can, use fresh herbs instead of dried for more sensational flavors - at stage 3, add them right at the end just before lifting off the heat.

I tried this recipe for a family party and it was the hit of the party!! Try it with ground sausage ( I mixed one original and one hot sausage)  and a little parm. cheese for something extra.  They are very rich however, one or two mushrooms for person is about perfect!!

These were really good right out of the oven but if you wait ANY at all to serve them they get really soggy and gross.

These were a hit!  I used turkey Italian sausage, 1-1/2 C. mozzarella cheese, 1/2 C. asiago cheese, left out the basil since the sausage is spicy, and added 2 T. white wine because the stuffing seemed rather dry.  I subbed 2 T. olive oil for the margarine and sprinkled 1/2 C. romano cheese on all last 10 min. of baking.  As a previous reviewer suggested, the pack of mushrooms from Costco was just right to use up all the stuffing.  I didn't cook the mushrooms first but had no trouble with them getting soggy from too much liquid.  As one reviewer stated, they were a bit like a meatball in a mushroom, but hey, WE LOVE MEATBALLS!

I made made these mushrooms because I had a bunch of spare ingredients lying around that I needed to get rid of. While putting everything together, I kept wondering if the mixture would need salt. I left it out because I wanted to follow the recipe exactly and it tasted fine in the end. The prep took just a little over 30 minutes for me.

worth all the effort you put into them, maybe garnish with some fresh parsley to add a little color.

I made these for a party we had this past weekend and they were wonderful!  I substituted the ground beef for chorizo sausage and then used grated Manchego cheese instead of the cheddar.  They were gobbled up in no time!  This is a great base recipe, it's fun to play around with the ingredients a little.

I made this recipe, following the directions precisely.  The mix was dry, and there was a lot of mix left over.  I should have added water to the mix and used three lbs of mushrooms, but the stems from only two, as another member suggested.

This is a keeper.  I substituted Italian sausage (hot) for the ground beef and omitted the green pepper.  Use small portabella 'shrooms ("Baby Bella") if you can find them.  This makes a lot of stuffing--party size!!!

These got many compliments at the xmas party I took them to, but were just a little strong on the garlic for me. It does make way to much stuffing and I had a hard time wasting it so I later added an egg to help hold it together for turning it into meatballs and then baked them for spaghetti. Turned out ok i guess for a leftover concoction.

This is one of the best recipies I've found in a long time. I modified it to be vegetarian and also for personal tastes (I left out the bell peppers, added onions and twice the garlic and used fake sausage(gimme lean) instead of the hamburger) I brought the mushrooms to Thanksgiving dinner, and they disapeared in about two minutes! Everyone raved about them, and were shocked to hear I used fake sausage (none of them are vegetarian and they are usually a little afraid of vegetarian type products and recipies) My friends grandmother even made me promise to send her the recipie! I think the only thing I'd change next time is to make at least 5 times as much :-)

Great recipe as a side or an appetizer!  I used lean ground turkey rather than beef and added a little seasoned greek yogurt sauce to serve.

Made these last night for the hubby and I so only madehalf of the recipe.  Made exactly as directed.  Not impressed.  They are OK.  The Italian sausage taste was predominate and overpowered the more delicate taste of the mushroom.  May try the left over stuffing ( with a little more bread crumbs, cheese and garlic) in a zucchini.

added chopped onions and green peppers and extra olives, mixed both mozzerella and sharp cheddar into the mix and other than that kept all as origanal.  BIG hit.

Recipe was ok. It had a bit too much ground beef in it though. If I made it again I would probibly cut it down to 1/2 lb of beef and up the breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs and 3/4 cup soft breadcrumbs.

I made this when trying to get rid of some ground beef, so it didn't make much sense to buy sausage. In stead I threw in some sage, marjoram, thyme and red pepper.  It still lacked flavor.  The cheese doesn't come across at all.  There are better stuffed mushroom recipes.

Really amazing meal! Unlike others we have tried, the mushrooms were nice and firm. Too much unused stuffing (2x) will be saved for another meal.

Great recipe.  I did change it a little by using half hamburger and half mild italian sausage. It did make a lot of filling but I piled it on high and used it all. All my guests loved them and asked for the recipe.

This is an excellent basic recipe! It definitely needs some zing, like others have posted. I'll make it again, but dress up the filling. (In this first attempt I added a bit of pizza sauce and some shredded mozzarella to the top. Was great!)

Btw, Costco sells a big container of mushrooms that just happen to be exactly the amount called for in the recipe. I also scraped the gills out to give a little more room for stuffing. I ended up using all the stuffing this way.

This was my first attempt at making stuffed mushrooms. Very easy to make although I used 1/2 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound sausage. There was quite a bit of the mixture left over so my husband and I made nachos with the remainder of it!

Very good filling. I used Italian sausage in place of the ground beef.  It made more filling than I could use in the mushrooms.  I put it on sliced french bread and heated those in the oven- yum!

These were absolutely awesome.  I made them for a party, and they were the first thing to disappear.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I sauted onions along with the peppers, and I added more cheddar on top.  They were great.  And I made the filling the day before, so they were a cinch to pop in the over right before I needed them!

I omitted the pepper, it didn't seem necessary. I also used 1/2lb ground beef and 1/2 lb of sweet sausage. Also added a bit of bacon. I found that if you put the mushrooms in the oven for 6 minutes without the mixture then add the mixture the mushroom itself is cooked more. The mixture make a lot! They were wonderful!

Very good!  I went with 1/2-1/2 beef/hot Italian sausage combination.  I overstuffed jumbo mushrooms and put a little water as suggested in the pan.  Check the water level to be sure not too much water is released and rise up to the stuffing.  The mushrooms were completely cooked through as well.  They were devoured at Christmas dinner.

I made these for appetizers and used portebella mushrooms. Oh my goodness! They were scrumptious, but huge and would have been great just as a meal.
We all loved them and my husband is head over heals for them.
Definitely making these again!
Thanks!

I used fresh herbs and 1/2 lb of sausage and 1/2 lb of groud beef and a bit of garlic salt. Easy to make. My picky co-workers really liked them.

I also add a little chopped onion and only added 1/2 to 3/4 lb of ground beef.  I also used 
Mozarella instead of Cheddar (I've never had a stuffed mushroom that didn't use Mozarella).
They came out great and got rave reviews at the party for which I made them.   Serve them warm 
and keep them warm though.  I'd recommend a warming plate..

I don't know if children would really like this, but i brought these mushrooms to a party and I was the hit!! Everyone just loved them.  I didn't put the mushroom stems in with the meat mixture, I thought it would be to much.  I got asked for this recipe to many times that night!!

this was good, but i think next time i'm going to reduce the amount of hamburger by at least half.  that way it'll be cheesier and easier to taste the delicious mushrooms! :-) thanks.

Instead of using cheddar cheese I used Mozzarella and it came out great.  My family raved.

Excellent appetizer.  The only changes I made were:   meat - used one third each beef, pork, and veal, red pepper (rather than green), and less breadcrumbs.

I used three different cheeses and seasoned the meat. Also added extra garlic. Everyone LOVES these and requests them every year.

I used ground turkey and used a spicy cheese. Everyone thought I used spicy sausage.  So good.  I did not add any water.  Mine were not dry at all.  Loved them!

This is a great base for so many things.  I used chicken sausage and feta instead of beef and cheddar.  There was extra stuffing, so we used it for omelets.  Will be making this often.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used both beef and Italian sausage as recommended by many others.  I also chose to add a few shallots and more butter.  They turned out excellent and extremely moist.  They only problem was forgetting to inform the vegetarians that they contained meat!

AMAZING! flavorful and moist. And pretty simple.

Ate as the entrée and it was super filling. 

I added 2 Italian sausage links (mashed up with the beef), which added a lot of flavor. Also, a little bit of chopped onion. It made a lot of mixture which I'll use the extra for omelets as someone else suggested.

I love this recipie! Very flavorful, I do aggree if you use big mushrooms you migh need to add a little water to keep from drying out, because they take longer in the oven
