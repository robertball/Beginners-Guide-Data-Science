I love this and for a twist I added 1 1/2 tsp. of a good curry powder.  Really great!

I made a double batch using a Costco Rotisserie chicken and still had chicken left.  Very easy to make although the onion was a little strong.  Next time I'm going to reduce the onion and add a diced fresh jalepeno for a little kick.

I used a rotesserie chicken from the grocery store & added a handful of chopped pecans.  This is easy & delicious.
