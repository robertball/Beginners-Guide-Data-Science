I made the " Roasting Melting Potatoes" last night for dinner. They didn't turn out like I thought they would.  First of all, I think the temperature of 500 degrees is too high (or maybe it's my oven?) but they turned out way too crisp and mostly burnt. I did the 15 minute intervals, too.  I added the low sodium vegetable stock at the end and I think, with the whole teaspoon of salt in the beginning, even the low sodium stock was too much. They were very salty.  I ate the ones that weren't burnt and threw the rest away.  I probably won't be making these again (which looked so good in the picture)!

I used baby Yukon Gold potatoes and cut them in thirds. I cooked them on 500* but I did 10 minute intervals. They were looking amazing and I was excited to eat them until the last part where I added the broth. Maybe I added too much for the potatoes that  had but they didn't come out crispy. They tasted really, really good but they were not crispy.

I made these for my fried potato loving husband and they were a hit! I have made them many times since and vary the spices every time. One of our faves is garlic powder and cumin seed, yum!  Cajun spices are great too!

These were good potatoes and I will probably make them again. I left the salt out because we are on low salt diet. They were crispy. My oven kept setting off the smoke alarm because of the high heat.

Used russets in lieu of Yukon golds, but otherwise changed nothing.  These are scrumptious!  Not a lot of effort for a very rewarding side dish.  Kudos to the recipe author.

UN-BE-LIEVABLE!! These are my go-to absolute showstopper potatoes! I add a little parsley and oregano and garlic to the melted butter. But these potatoes are AMAZING. This is my permanent favorite

These are really quite good! But I did find that the cook time was off for me. They took about 10 minutes longer than the listed cook time (and I even cut them into only 3/4" slices). Not sure if that's an issue with my oven or not. I also added a sprinkling of fresh parsley just before serving. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and liked them a lot.  However, I set the temperature at 425.
