I've been making this for years (not from this recipe) and I must say, it's a must have for my family! A few suggestions, garlic powder does not do it justice! I use the sweet corn and shuck it, then I put it on the foil (individually) and spray it down really well with spray butter (that way it is evenly distributed.) Then I take roasted minced garlic and spread it out all over the corn (not too much, about a 1/2 tsp or so, I guess) and then I add some salt and pepper, wrap it up tight and grill it. It's AWESOME! Everyone loves it!

My family and friends can't get enough of this great stuff! The one thing you should change to make it better is minced garlic instead of the powder. I actually do salt & pepper to taste along with the garlic and butter. Sometimes to save on calories I even use the spray butter. It's absolutely delicious!

I took one stick of butter (at room temperature) and added some minced garlic to it.  Then spooned a heaping tablespoon of butter on each piece of corn, smearing it so it covers the ear of corn completely.  Wrapped each piece of corn in foil, and placed on the grill for approximately 30-40 minutes.  (carcoal grill).  No need for additional butter was needed.  Delicious.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD BUT I CHANGED IT A BIT..I DID THE CORN IN THE MICROWAVE(WRAP IN A DAMP PAPER TOWEL AND MICRO 3 TO 4 MINUTES) AND TO SAVE CALORIES AND FAT I USED BUTTER BUDS INSTEAD OF REAL BUTTER...I MIXED THE BUTTER BUDS AND GARLIC POWDER IN A BOWL AND ROLLED THE CORN IN IT...QUICK AND EASY..YOU HAVE TO LOVE THAT.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I think it tastes SO much better by using fresh garlic than the powder. For 12 ears of corn I used about 4 garlic cloves. Delicous! Last night I tried it the way the recipe calls for garlic powder and it was definitely not as good. I also found that the garlic powder seemed to "dry out" the corn much faster.

Nothing signals the start of summer like grilled corn on the cob at a BBQ!  I did mine a little differently though - I left the corn in the husks vs. using foil.  I peeled the husks back a bit to remove a little of the silk, put it back then left them soak in cold water for 30 minutes.  I put the corn in husks on the grill for 30 minutes rotating it around the coals.  The corn cooks by steaming inside the husks.  I made my own garlic butter for these and all that was left to do was sprinkle with a bit of salt.

I put the corn right on the grill for the grill marks and a little caramelizing... gotta embrace the sugar in the corn!! (I parboiled the corn the day before - helped with timing it up with the meat!)

I par-boiled my corn in sugar water and then grilled it. I too used fresh garlic and then made a garlic butter sauce for brushing after they were off the heat. Very good and thanks Christine!

GREAT!  Like others, I only give this recipe 4 stars because it truly is better with fresh garlic. The garlic taste might seem odd at first coupled with corn but I promise that by your first ear, you'll be craving more! Love that the author included oven instructions!

Delicious. That is all I can say. I found it great with garlic powder, and also delicious with fresh garlic. I ended up wrapping mine in foil and then baking it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes, but it came out so delicious, that I will be making it that way over and over again!

Very good. I didn't measure the garlic powder and added some parmesan cheese to a couple of cobs. The only thing I'll do different next time is let them go longer in the oven (45-60) minutes.

This turned out very well.  I liked the way that this turned out.  I didn't absolutely wow me, but it was good enough to use again.  You will probably have to use salt after the cooking process.  Thank you for the post.

My DS liked corn on better this way than just boiling it, however, my DD likes it better boiled. I liked for something different since I had the grill on anyways. Next time I'll add a bit more butter, salt, and garlic.

We just came into the heart of our corn season, so I thought i'd give this a try. After reading the (most helpful) part of the reviews, I decided to follow Jillians advice which produced the most delicious sweetcorn imaginable. Thank you Jillian. Nothing beats fresh picked sweet corn, properly soaked in water, and then roasted on the grill in it's own husk. If it's soaked long enough, the inside kernels of corn get steamed not burned.  I also love the fact that you can use the (pulled back) husk as a handle, for eating.

Not my favorite.  I guess I'm pretty plain when it comes to corn on the cob.  Good corn on the cob should only need a little butter and nothing else.  If you want corn on the cob but live somewhere where it's hard to get good ears, this may help make up for bland corn.

This is a great way to cook corn on the cob.  I placed a shishkabob skewer in the end of each ear, makes it easy to turn and a great way to hold it while eating.  Everyone thought this was fantastic at my 4th of July party.

Very good - however, I did a bit of a variation. Instead of garlic powder which has a lot of sodium, I used crushed garlic. I also love a kick to my corn so I added some chili powder sprinkled over. I think a spray butter would also work but I love real butter myself.

Delish... However I used olive oil instead of butter and cook it about 20 min if you like your corn on the firmer side.

I've used this recipe before but instead of plain butter, I use krauterbutter with a little salt and pepper.  Krauterbutter is German and easy to make - add finely chopped chives, dill, parsely, garlic and a few drops of lemon juice to softened butter, then refrigerate until it hardens again.  The herbs add a great taste to the butter and corn.

Delicious!  Even as I was taking the first bite, I was still very unsure about garlic on corn, but it was good.  I've made it a few times, a couple times with garlic powder, and a couple times with actual garlic.  It's definitely better with fresh garlic.  I bake them instead of grilling them and still good.

This was really delicious!  I, too, used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  And I baked the corn in the oven while making a pork tenderloin.  It came out perfect!!!  I'll never make corn on the cob any other way again.  Thanks sooo much for the recipe!

As with other readers, I've made my corn this way for years However I use garlic salt rather than powder. This adds a lot more flavor and doesn't have the strange texture or aftertaste (note: I buy the garlic salt that has parsley in it).
I prefer to grill my corn straight on the grill. I melt my butter, mix in the garlic salt, then spread on the corn while it is on the grill. The corn takes 20-30 minutes to cook.

not spectacular - I don't think I will bother with all the foil wrapping etc. next time - if you are lucky enough to have good corn, it is most delicious just quickly boiled and everyone can butter their own. This was Just not our thing, I guess.

Pretty good, but my 3 year old (who loves cotc) wouldn't eat it. So, I probably won't be making it again.

Family loves it!  Cuts out the mess of having to butter and season when hot and the butter cooks down into the corn.  I will be cooking it like this from now on.

This was delicious!  I used the garlic powder, but only sprinkled a small amount on each cob.  Will definitely try again and use fresh.

An easy side dish but I don't think garlic powder is the way to go. I'll use fresh next time.

Only 4 stars because fresh garlic was SO MUCH BETTER!  I'd say don't even bother with the powdered stuff.  Also, my corn needed a bit more time in the oven (almost the full amount), though I was only making 5 ears.  No matter, it was fantastic and simple!  Yum yum, thanks! *-V.

This was a definite twist on corn on the cob!  My family loved it and fought over the leftovers the next night.  What a great way to hold the flavor in, the kids thought it was awesome they didn't have to butter the corn. :)

Awesome. My 5 year old loves this. The only bad thing is, that it is hard to find corn on the cob in the winter.

it was ok but i just really wasn't into the garlic on the corn. I tried both regular garlic and garlic powder. I liked that I could use it in the oven and it cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of crunch but next time ill probably just use regular salt and butter instead of the garlic.

I was really looking forward to this side dish for dinner, but was underwhelmed. It tasted like corn on the cob with a hint of garlic-essence. By roasting the corn on the grill it also ruined some of the juiciness I love. Not a great enough recipe to be saved, tried again, or even thought about.

I also have been doing this for years but have added salt & pepper with fresh garlic. You can add garlic powder if you are in a hurry but, you will taste the difference. To really wow your guests with this,add one or two leaves of Thyme before wrapping the corn. Wow!

We ended up adding some salt at the table, so next time I may use garlic salt or garlic powder plus seasoned salt, etc.  I was pleased that this recipe does give you a great basic, no-fail way to grill corn.

The method is great, but doesn't have to be garlic. Try sweet smoked paprika, or thyme, or other things as well.  Also, more than 20 minutes for good corn is too much.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and have to agree with others, the garlic powder doesn't do it justice.  If made with fresh garlic, I think this could easily be bumped up to 5 stars.

OMG...made this with softened butter and fresh minced garlic. Just slathered some on each ear, wrapped tightly in the foil, and grilled for about 40 min. It was amazing! Soooooooo good! A keeper for sure.

This is a good way to cook corn on the BBQ.  I recommend double wrapping the corn in foil so it doesnt burn though.

This recipe was good, but I don't see how the garlic powder makes a difference - I couldn't taste it (although I did not follow the measurements, I did sprinkle alot of garlic powder). Will try with real garlic next time... it did turn out delicious nevertheless.

Really tasty and very simple.  Even with our gas grill on low, it didn't take half an hour, so make sure you watch it.

Yummy! I took the advice of some of the other reviews I have read, and used about 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic mixed with the softened butter instead of garlic powder.

We enjoyed this. I sprayed with Pam butter spray, used garlic powder and a little minced garlic and covered in salt and pepper. I also chose the baking method. Very tender and a great flavor! ~UPDATE~ I used Pam butter spray again but this time just used garlic powder and seasoning salt. Wrapped in foil and grilled on the barbie - super!

The flavor was really good, and it was easy to make. I baked it in the oven for 25 minutes, but it wasn't quite done. I think next time I'll try 35-40 minutes instead.

I don't have a grill so I cooked this in the oven with a little fresh garlic and some garlic powder (didn't have enough fresh), salt, and pepper.  Very tasty but I needed to cook the corn a littl longer, maybe because the corn was frozen first. Of course clean up is a breeze.

I dissolved the garlic powder in melted butter and added a little onion powder...pour over corn and roast. as one other post suggested parboil corn first to save some time...this is delicious.

This was very good.  I used garlic salt and added some garlic pepper, when done, I removed them from the foil and rolled around on the grill for about a minute to get that 'grilled' look.  Thanks for posting!

My favorite way to eat corn.  I used fresh minced garlic and either bake or grill the ears of corn.  It's perfect for a corn-only dinner or as a side with meat.  I love the fact that you can prepare just the number of ears of corn that you would like.  Easy and delicious.

These were definitely good, but I think fresh garlic and more seasonings would make them better.  We cooked ours for 45 minutes, turning once, and they were perfect.  Much better than boiling... will make again, but adding to the recipe.  Thanks!

It was good. I didn't precook the corn, just put in the oven for 30 minutes. Because of a busy schedule I ended up dressing the corn a day in advance, wrapping it in foil and letting it sit in the fridge overnight and in my car for a few hours. Lacking a point of comparison, I'm not SURE, but I think the corn got nicely infused with garlic overnight.

I use this oven method of making corn on the cob every time I make it!  I do change up the seasonings a little, I use salt, a little sprinkle of black pepper, and sometimes garlic or onion powder.  When putting on the butter, I don't measure how much I'm using, but I use the spoon to spread it from end to end.  This corn comes out a little firm, so I'll sometimes leave it 5 minutes more to get the kernels softer.  (This may be related to my oven's temperature being off.)  I also turn the corn every 10 minutes.

This was good but I think next time I will use slightly less butter/garlic powder, or at least spread it around more.  Just a personal preference.

Cooked perfectly, but could use some more instruction on applying the butter/garlic powder.  Next time I'll be applying more butter and garlic powder.

Currently I do not have a grill, so I decided to use my broiler instead....  I used the jared minced garlic, salt, pepper and butter, then wrapped the husked ears in foil.  These came out really dry.  Maybe it was the corn,  Maybe it was my preperation.  But I don't think I will be trying these again till I get a grill!

I love this recipe. I now find myself only making corn on the cob this way. I add a couple extra cloves of garlic and try to limit the butter but it is great! Thank you.

Very good.  I purchase different size foil containers for my grilling needs and find them easier to use than the foil squares.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks Christie.

These turned out great! I just added a heaping spoonful of butter and a sprinkle of garlic powder then in the oven for 30 minutes and they were perfectly done! Next time I might try tony Chacheres(sp?). It was good though!

20 minutes can't possibly be enough time. It was still a little undercooked at 30 minutes, although this might be my own fault; I've never had much luck grilling corn. Perhaps it's just that my grill isn't hot enough?

What a great, simple way to make corn on the cob!  I loved not having to add butter before eating and the garlic gave it a little extra flavor.  Will make again!

This was incredibly good, but with some changes. I used fresh chopped garlic and added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese. Reduced butter to a half tbsp on each one and wrapped as directed. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes. So good!

Wow!!! Greatest corn recipe ever. I will never buy frozen again. I actually added a few pieces of minced garlic instead of the powder and had to cook a little bit longer and they came out absolutly perfect, and were a huge party hit! Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Pretty good! Taste wasn't as strong as I had hoped, but it was easy and made a plain corn on the cob taste better. I was also eating Peruvian corn, as I live in Peru, and their corn tastes like potatoe so that might have had something to do with it.

Very good, though I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. As recommended by many in this review thread, I used fresh minced garlic too, which provided good results. The corn was pretty awesome, though I will try garlic powder next time, as called for in the recipe. Take care to turn the corn regularly. Despite being wrapped in foil, the side of a few of mine were charred; not inedible, but definitely dark brown. That could have been averted by turning the corn more often. I added a little pepper too.

I had to down-size the portion amounts because I was cooking for just my fiance and myself.  I also nixed the garlic because I didn't have any powder and couldn't chop the cloves into small enough pieces.  The cooking time was just right, as well as the butter.  The corn was sweet, juicy, and had just the right amount of "crunch".  Plus, the aluminum foil made it so easy to clean up!  We loved it.

very good - it is so much better to cook it with the butter instead of putting it on right before you eat it.  Plus, garlic: need I say more.

Very good. I did not use close to the 1/4 cup listed, but the flavor was very good.

I thought this was fine, but I think I prefer grilling the corn directly on the grate rather than wrapping in foil.  I found that a lot of the butter and garlic flavor was left behind in the foil wrapper.  I think I could have achieved better results by grilling the cobs plain, and then just using a garlic butter after cooking.

these were very good i did them in the oven. the only thing is which isnt bad they just have different taste then any other corn that i have ever had and first it would shock me but then by the end it was always good. my Dad loved it though, he went and got some more corn to make even though it is .50 a cob

This recipe is very easy and very good.  I made it for my son's 4th grade class and the parents and kids just loved it.  We have made it part of our regular menu.  Thanks.

I was looking for a simple way to cook corn on the cob and this one was PERFECT. I left out the garlic on some because some of my guests don't like it. Both were perfect! Thanks!

I used garlic powder and didnt experience any weird taste/texture that some other reviewers mentioned.  I am sure that fresh garlic tastes better but I found these to be really good as the recipe is written.  We subbed margarine for the butter.

I did use granulated garlic as What'sHisFace suggested & I'm sure it worked better than garlic powder but it still left somewhat of an aftertaste....next time I'm using fresh minced garlic! I only made up four ears of corn since it was just hubby & I.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I think Fresh Garlic would have been much better.

This wasn't bad but it just really didn't have any flavor to it. I think next time I may try some garlic salt too. I do like that you can make this in the oven.
