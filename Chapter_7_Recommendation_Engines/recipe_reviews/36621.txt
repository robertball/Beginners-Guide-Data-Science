Being from Philly, and no longer living there, this recipe caught my eye.  It is however, NOT by any stretch of the imagination a "Philly Cheese Steak".  Steak must be much thinner, cheese should be provolone and mixed in with the meat, and I've never had green peppers on one, unless they were hot peppers.  Good sandwich, just keep in mind it is not what it calls itself.

Great spice/seasoning mix for the meat.  In the future I will add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and allow the meat to marinade overnight.  I used swiss cheese but next time I will use provolone.  The amount of cheese needs to be increased drastically (maybe double or triple the amount of cheese called for).  Be sure to buy large hoagie rolls as smaller ones don't hold all the ingredients.  I recommend adding a cup of sliced mushrooms to the meat mixture.

Not a Philly cheesesteak, but OK. For Philly-style cheesesteak, meat should be super thin (freeze 90% and shave across grain using thin slicing disc of food processor). Also, cheese should be american or provolone (slices laid over and stirred into meat while it's in the skillet, at end of cooking) or Cheese Whiz.

But if you're not specifically looking for a Philly cheesesteak, this is a tasty sandwich for what it is.

My husband made this YUMMMM! The things that he did differently were added red pepper, mushrooms, and used garlic in a jar. Then marinated the meat with all the seasonings adding worsteschire sauce. Toasted the roll with a light spread of butter. Instead of swiss he used provolone, melting the cheese in the pan over the meat. YUMMMMMM! Thanks Wendy.

This is the closest to a real Philly Sandwich I've ever made. I used provolone instead of swiss the second time I made it. That makes a big difference, so I stick to provolone everytime I make it. Don't let all the spices keep you from tying it, because it is well worth it and a tip for buying spices is look in the mexican food isle in grocery for little packages of all the spices needed. They are alot less expensive than some other brand names. So it's affordable on ones budget. Almost a 5 * with my boys.

Being from Nebraska, we have a limited interpretation of a Philly Steak Sandwich.  But my husband asked me to make these and they turned out great!  We have put this recipe in our favorite's, and will enjoy.  Thanks Wendy!

The flavoring for the meat is just wonderful!  I made this the first time as sandwiches.  Since then, we've been using the same seasoning mix (doubling the chili powder) and making steak fajitas with it instead.  I have used various cuts of meat (even sliced chuck roast) with great results.  Sirloin tip roast works great...just partially freeze and slice into fajita-size strips, mix with the seasoning and prepare as directed.  Perfect blend of spices!  Thank you so much, we really enjoy this one :-)

A little bit different from a traditional Philly, but it had great flavor and made an excellent sandwich.  I added some chicken broth to the meat drippings in the pan, and it made a great au jus.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow! The spiced meat was delicious! I used chewy Calabrese buns, because the store was out of hoagies, and (after reading up on the "traditional" Philly Cheesesteak) I did one batch with provolone cheese and another batch with Cheez Whiz. We preferred the provolone. Oh, and I used the garlic mayo from the other allrecipes cheesesteak, which elevated the sandwich to a whole new level. Fabulous! Will definitely add to the regular rotation!

I have made these sandwiches twice now and they were WONDERFUL!  I don't care if they are authentic or not, they are just delicious.  First time I used leftover cooked rib-eye steak that my husband sliced super thin with an electric knife.  I put the pieces in a ziploc bag with all the spices to let marinate.  2nd time I made, I used frozen steak-ums and that worked well too; however I think the rib-eye was just a little better.  Do not skimp on the bread.  I bought very nice, fresh hoagie rolls from our store's bakery and it really makes them.  The combination of spices and meat, cheese, etc just makes for a super delicious sandwich.  Oh and first time I used swiss cheese as recipe calls for and 2nd time I used provolone.  We actually liked the swiss better as it has more flavor.  I am so glad I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up a leftover steak!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Very good and easy lunch.  These are the closest recipe I have found that replicate the ones made down at a local deli. I omitted the marjoram without compromising the taste. Will make again.

tasty recipe but not a "Philly" cheesesteak, as I know it. Paper thin beef, peppers, onions and cheez wiz on a hoagie are the authentic.

Love these, and they freeze beautifully!I wait until Sirloin is on sale, then have the butcher slice it as thin as he can. (All that slicing by hand gets tough!)I cut the recipe in half, and placed all the raw ingredients for 1/2 a recipe in a 1 quart freezer bag. (1/2 recipe is the perfect size for 2 adults.) Squish the bag to get the air out, and freeze for up to 6 months. Pull from the freezer, and cook as described. You will never know they just came out of the freezer, and it makes for a super-fast meal. Provolone cheese is our favorite instead of swiss!

Loved the flavour of this one. Added the galric mayo from another recipe and it finished it off perfectly. 1 cup mayo with 2 minced cloves of garlic.

I loved all of the spices! Not your typical Philly. Next time I'm going to cook it in the Crock pot with Beef Broth and use some of the sauce for the sandwihes. Thank you!

Used rib-eye steak sliced real thin, put in the freezer for about 15 minutes to make it easy to slice. I used provolone, and husband had Swiss. I also didn't broil the buns, just toasted on the griddle. Lay the cheese on your cooked meat on the griddle and it will melt, use the spatula to slop it all on your bun, that way the cheese mixes in with the meat.

'Sgood! I really liked the spice mixture and these were excellent served with homemade baked fries. I made this exactly as written EXCEPT for the cheese. Used provolone instead of Swiss because I just couldn't see it any other way. Next time I'll hang onto the spice mix, but I prefer steak sandwiches a tad sloppier. And juicier. This was a little dry. So next time I'll probably just mix everything together and let it all cook together then throw cheese on top and cover it to melt everything together before scooping it into a bun. But there will definitely  be a next time, so thank you!

I was born and raised in Philly and it is so amusing to hear people try to duplicate our cheese steaks. This has good flavor but is NOT a Philly cheese steak. Interesting try though!

Being a Philadelphia native I have had my fair share of the "real Philly Cheese Steak" (with or without Whiz--Cheez Whiz) This recipe was delicious and easy home version.  I substitutes provolone cheese or mozarella in lieu of Swiss.

Very good but 1/2 tsp can be too much seasoning.  I season with all listed but shake it in which is definately less than what is stated.  I will use more of those I really like, ie garlic,  pepper etc.   Don't care for the swiss so we switch it up with whatever is on hand...american, mexican blend, provolone.  Save the juice from the pan and you an au jus for dipping.  Crusty bread and ciabatta work best for us.  These changes have made it a 5 star for us!

This was wonderful.  The only thing that I did different was, I combined the seasonings and a dab of olive oil and about 2 tsp of worcheshire sauce in a ziplock bag.  I added the cut up steak and allowed it to marinate for 3 hours.  This came out wonderful and flavorful.

The original Philly Steak Sandwich after WWII did not have any cheese, just very thinnly sliced tenderloin of beef, green pepper and lots of onions. No mayonaisse either. You could get it at a place in South Philly and it was delicious. Even at my "tender" age, I still remember the taste---no cheese, honesly.

This was a delicious sandwich & quick recipe by modifying it alittle. 
For the seasoning we used soy sauce to dip the 1 pack of pre-cut fajita style steak pieces. Afterwards on a plate we layed out the steak on a plate & seasoned it with grinded black pepper & used Lawrys seasoning salt instead to lightly cover only one side of the meat. 
We used fresh garlic with the bell peppers & onions together instead of the garlic salt.
As for the bread we used the big loaf of French white bread instead which ended up cutting into 4 sandwich sizes.
As for the cheese, we used provolone instead & one slice of the deli sliced provolone was enough for each sandwich size. 
So we wounded up with 4 sandwiches total.

WOW! This sandwich was AWESOME! It was exactly what I was lloking for. The only changes I made was to omit the marjoram and chili powder because I didn't have any. Also, I used mozzarella cheese. 
This sandwich is a new staple in our home. My husband was also VERY impressed.
Thank you for this recipe.

This was great, authentic or not! I take the sirloin right out of the freezer and slice it very thin with a slicer. I marinated the sliced meat with the herbs and spices plus some vegetable oil, soy sauce and worchestershire overnight the first time, but when I've made it since, I just let it defrost/marinate on the counter while prepping everything else and/or sides, and it imparts plenty of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was delicious, as good as Geno's or Pat's.  My husband and I gobbled them up, and they were sooo filling. Hours later, we still weren't hungry.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks Wendy!!! :)

Decent recipe.  Good tasting but not quite a "Philly" ... you really want thinly sliced meat.
Also .. too many ingredients to add.  I've got a good recipe to submit.

WOW!!  Need I say more.  This recipe is the best.  I have had philly sandwiches in MANY restaurants and none have tasted as good as this.  I didnt have the marjoram and it needed more salt than stated on the recipe but I guess its all in the individuals taste.  Anyway, I put is on top of a soft sweet french roll which was toasted in the broiler.  YuMmY!!
I rated it 4*'s because I think it may be a bit too spicy for kids to enjoy but for an adult, it is perfect.

Okay, tastes good BUT as a native Philadelphian, who also worked way through college in a Philluy deli making the real thing, must say NEVER green peppers, lyon,t understand  why every place Not in Philly have this in the steak..ribeye sliced on a deli slicer, paper thin, chopped onion, salt, pepper, American or cheese whiz, and for me mushrooms..only hot red peppers used..but it is a nice treat for fiends down here in TX who want the experience..good recipe..

The spices on the meat was VERY overpowering, you couldn't taste anything else on the sandwich unless you have one tiny piece of meat and pile it as high as possible with the onions & peppers. Nevermind tasting any cheese. The spice combination wasn't bad, but just not great for a sandwich.

Very mediocre. Neither my fiance or I cared for our sandwiches, but at least he liked his a little more than I did mine. I am SOOOOO disappointed.... I really thought this would be delicious and was looking forward to giving it a try. If you are in search of the "real thing" this doesn't compare (and I've had the REAL thing!). Having said that, I wasn't expecting an exact replica, but was hoping for something close enough. I pretty much followed CANDYCAT's directions to the letter except for a few changes. As suggested, I purchased beef for stir-fry (short on time), tossed the seasonings/meat in a large Zip-lock bag and marinated for about an hour. I also stir fried my meat until almost done, then added the peppers/onions and continued to cook everything until the vegetables were softened. This way, I didn't need to dirty a separate dish to "hold" the meat. I lightly brushed my sub rolls with a mixture of melted butter and garlic powder (to taste), broiled for a couple of minutes, added the meat/veggies, topped each sandwich with 2 provolone slices and finished broiling until melted. For a finishing touch, I slathered our sandwiches with garlic mayo (just eyeball it - you don't need a recipe for garlic mayo!). Served with seasoned curly fries, this was a filling meal, just not a satisfying one. Sorry, but this won't make a repeat with us. Thanks anyways, CANDYCAT :)

This was really good. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and bought pre-cut fajita meat, and it was a real timesaver. The only future change I would make is to stir some soy sauce or worc. sauce into the meat with the seasonings before stir-frying to give it a bit more flavor. I will make it again with this modification.

Delicious! My husband is from Philadelphia and he liked it.  Simple alterations, I made a paste of the listed herbs (minus powdered garlic or onion, I prefer real) with a little olive oil and smeared minute steaks (steak'um type) while still frozen, and let them unthaw during the day in the frig. After sauteeing beef, onion, garlic and pepper, I lightly wiped the pan and toasted the inside of the rolls before adding the meat and veggies.  Also substituted provolone.  So good, and with 2 packs of steak'ums had plenty for leftover lunches.

I liked this recipe.  Who cares if it's "authentic" or not I say!  I did tweak it a little to my family's taste and added mushrooms and a little garlic tomato sauce. I loved the spice mixture and overall it was a wonderful meal idea.

These were great. I sliced it as thin as I could and then let it marinate for the day. Very good flavor. I also used provolone and added worchestire and soy sauce. I've never had an 'authentic' philly sandwich but it will be hard to beat this one. I highly recommend trying this recipe.

Wonderful.  The first night I cooked these I shaved the frozen sirloin as thin as I could with a knife.  I also used provolone and added a little soy and worchestire sauce for a little wetness.  These were incredible, but it wasn't until the second night when I chopped the meat up in a food processor that my husband and I both proclaimed these tasted just like the ones from our local philly cheesesteak restaurant.

My family could have cared less if this was the "real thing" or not, all I know is that they absolutely loved it. My daughter Ashley is the Philly Steak queen and she gave it thumbs up! I sliced the steak super thin and used the famous TV chef's bottled seasoning mix, which had everything I needed. I made extra onions and peppers and Uh-Oh, went out on a limb and used sliced cheddar cheese instead of provolone. Sorry, I guess by doing that I turned it into a N.J. cheesesteak! Thanks so much Wendy as you made my gang extremely happy!:)

Seeing as I've never had a "true" Philly Steak sandwich, I thought these were awesome!!  I thought maybe all the spices the recipe called for were excessive but they mixed together wonderfully. My husband and kids all thought this was great.  I skippd the broiling part and just added the cheese (provolone, NOT swiss) at the very end and stirred until melted. Yummy!

I am really picky about Philly Steak sandwiches. I thought this was really good. I was surprised with all of the different spices involved here, but none were overpowering and they all mingled together to provide a mild, great flavor. i am really close to giving this a 5.

This was great, the seasoning on the steak is perfect!  Be sure to cut against the grain, or it will be tough.  I used red bell pepper instead of green, and did add a touch of mayo to mine as I can't live without a condiment on my bread lol!  Very good!

I looked at this recipe and had a bad feeling about it and should have moved on. I have never seen a recipe like this without a tenderizer of some sort. I added all of the spices. I did 1/4 tsp. as a couple of reviewers mentioned it being too much. I was tempted to add something acidic but left it alone. The only spice I left out was the chili powder and subbed Italian seasoning for the basil and thyme. The problem was that the meat was tough, dry, and almost just had a bloody taste. The texture, was just as I had anticipated. Since, I used so many herbs and spices already, I got the fridge condiments out to doctor it up. I added chili sauce and a little soy and worchestershire. That definitely helped. I didn't bother with the cheese in the end since it didn't at any point seem like steak sandwich meat to me. I am glad I could salvage it although I am not sure it will all get eaten which is rare in my house. To top, even if it tasted like a cheese steak sandwich, the meat was just way too thick for a sandwich of this type.

Tasty! Seasoning was very good and would make again, even using different meats. Very good with provolone and mushrooms. We also used garlic mayo as a spread (1/4 tsp garlic salt with 1/4 C. mayo), which really made it super!

DELISH!!  Ok, maybe not authentic Philly Cheese Steaks, but we think they are MUCH better!  We used american cheese, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Will use again.

I made this today for dinner and it was great. I used 1 3/4 lb of flank steak, placed it in the freezer for a bit to make it firm and sliced the beef very thin. I mixed in the seasoning with the beef and placed in the the fridge for about an hour until I was ready to cook. It only takes a few minutes to cook because the meat is so thin. I also made the devil's steak sauce that is on this site. Heated my hoagie buns and served topped with american cheese, the steak sauce and some arugula. Soooo yummy!! Everyone in the family loved it. BTW, I left out the onions and peppers b/c the kids don't like them.

Made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I added the oil to the spices, spread over my tri-tip steak and slid into a baggy over night. Sauted my onions and peppers first then seared/fried my steak in a hot skillet until almost medium, let rest and then cut into thin slices. So much easier this way and you can control how you want your steak cooked. I used a shredded Italian blend of mozz, cheddar, provolone & asiago cheese. Talk about good.

We thought this was fantastic. We're not from Philadelphia, so we don't care if it's authentic or not - thus we bit into our sandwiches lacking prejudice about the seasonings and cheeses. The seasoning mixture, in particular, is what sets this sandwich apart from others, and I especially liked the thyme and marjoram. I don't get to use marjoram enough, but here's a recipe where it's a great addition! We liked that this was much lower in fat & calories than our usual favorite, "Jeremy's Philly Steak and Cheese" from this site. I took some liberties with the type of pepper (used Anaheim) and the cheese (used light provolone) and was fully satisfied with the end product. Thanks for the recipe!

So my boyfriend just proclaimed this was the best thing I've ever made. This sandwich is really good, I have never tasted a real philly sandwich so it does not matter to me the taste that it's supposed to be. This is great the way it is. But I just needed to add some of the suggestions that I read from all the reviews, to make sure it had optimum flavour. I used top round beef. I didn't use Hoagie rolls, because I think it is a US product. So I used our local sesame rolls. Had the meat defrosting, and left it slightly frozen so that it would be easier to slice. I didn't use the exact amounts of the veggies. Added tinned mushrooms to the veggie mix. Tinned pineapple to the finished sandwich. I added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes while it marinated, which was for over 6 hours, plus a bit more while cooking the beef. Also added white pepper while the beef cooked. I added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. I used some mayonnaise and 3 cloves of garlic on the bread.  Just put the sandwiches in the oven in a 500 degree oven for 3 minutes to melt the cheddar cheese, which was grated and just a bit.

These were good. To get the steak cut thin, it helps to pop it in the freezer for a couple minutes before slicing.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I had my 'meat guy' slice two ribeyes as thin as he could. And I also used provolone instead of swiss.  This is now in the regular rotation.  thanks

This sandwich is so good and easy that my husband and I make it for special occasions.  It is so flavorful!  I've already gotten a philly steak sandwich at a restaurant and was disappointed because it was bland compared to this.  Restaurants should use this recipe.

This was super easy and devoured by all.  I cheated and used Steak-Umms this time, but I can see using steak.  The seasonings make this for sure.  We used good hoagie rolls and provolone cheese.  Instead of onions and peppers, I used my leftover Guinness St. Patrick's Day mushroom and onion gravy and then topped it with the cheese and popped it under the broiler.

Fantastically delicious!  I will make this again, many times I'm sure.  I doubled everything, as I had 5 friends, and had enough for 6 servings, not 8.  Overall, very good.  Next time I wanna try provolone cheese though, as that sounds good. :)

Added the garlic mayo from other recipe.  Also, melted in provolone and also melted a little on top under the broiler.  My husband said it was one of the best cheesesteaks he ever had!

I wasn't expecting much for a homemade sandwich but this was deli quality. I used Steakum frozen steaks broken into strips and then sprinkled the seasoning over as they cooked. This turned out great for what I did with it, but I imagine with the real steak as called for it could have 5 star potential. I will fix this again as it's the best cheesesteak sandwich I have made at home yet. Thanks!!!

This recipe is simple and easy to follow, and the results are amazing. All i swapped was i used Cathedral cheese instead of Swiss, and hoagie rolls must be a US thing as i couldn't see them in the supermarkets in Glasgow so i just used baguettes. The results are sensational, especially as a couple of my mates now think i'm a dab hand in the kitchen.

We make this recipe all the time, however we always used cubed chicken instead.  We cube the raw chicken and cook it in the pan in some olive oil.  We then add the seasonings, onions and green pepper and cook it all together.  We also use garlic mayo (minced garlic and mayo) and broil the sandwich with swiss cheese.  Great meal.  My husband asks for this constantly and we have made this for several other people and they always love it.

This was exactly what I wanted to eat last night. I used top round steak instead of sirloin and used one big loaf of French bread cut into two big sandwiches instead. I didn't have any onion powder or marjoram, but the spices were still perfect. I loved the way the onions cooked up-- almost sweet. There was an excess of the onion/pepper mixture, so my 15 month old happily ate the extra. Overall, this is a great sandwich and very easy.

Great recipe! Just a tip if you like your bread extra moist: I poured the juice left from cooking the meat over the bread and meat before I put it in the oven to seep the flavor throughout the bread.

Very good! I loved the spices on the meat (although I did not add thyme or marjoram.) I was a little disappointed in the texture of my beef, however I will cook it longer next time. It also dried out a little under the broiler. Other than that the flavor was great. Thanks for the recipe, it's been a long time since I've had a cheese steak :)

I made a few slight alterations; I had no thyme, I slow cooked beef in oven after it was browned, and I used cheddar.  It was very good.  Of course, I had to add horseradish. I love quick and easy for the family on the go.  My picky kids liked it, too!

The mixture of seasonings were just right.  Instead of the swiss cheese, I used "melted" cheese whiz - everyone loved it!  A keeper!

I added red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers and lots of onions. Also, I only had mozzarella cheese so I used that instead. It came out great EXCEPT it was pretty dry. Next time I will add a little mayo to each side of the breads.

Made as written it was ok not great. The thyme was WAY overpowering. If I were to make it again I would reduce thyme by half.

I really enjoyed these sandwiches. I used beef knuckle and sliced the meat as thin as possible, then seasoned the meat and peppers and onions with the above seasonings. I also made a spread for the bread.

The spices were perfect, add a little olive oil to make a marinating paste. Use a better cut of meat. I used fajita cut beef and it doesn't cut it.Next time I have rib eyes sliced by the butcher. Provolone was better than swiss :)Added sliced mushrooms to the veggies.It was great!
I have made this several times now. Using  top sirloin sliced into 1/4 in slices I marinate in the paste for a hour or two. Saute the meat until med rare, remove and saute veges then assemble and broil :)

I loved this recipe! I had some leftover BBQ steak and this was the perfect recipe for some leftovers.

I didn't have marjoram, so I omitted it, and it still tasted great! I used red roasted peppers instead of green because again it was what I had left over from the BBQ steak. I also used marble cheese (mozarella and cheddar mix), that's all I had and it was fantastic!

We added some hot pepper paste because we like spicy and a red roasted pepper spread because we had it.

I have to say not the greatest. COuldnt taste the meat as much as i would have liked. I would say if you are strapped for time or just looking for something quick and easy stop at walmart and in the meat section they have a cheese steak sandwich in a bag. It has the meat, the cheese, onions, and rolls all in there. It is actually pretty  good. it feeds 4 and costs 10 dollars.

This was great!  Outstanding flavors with the seasonings on the beef.   I only made minor changes such as adding mushrooms to the veggies and I used provolone instead of swiss.  I also cooked the meat and veggies in their own pans to help on time.  Overall, great stuff!

Made these last night for Monday night football. Awesome is all I can say. Everyone LOVED them. I did use provolone cheese and also sliced the meat much thinner but that does nothing to change the wonderful flavor of the meat. GREAT RECIPE !!!

OK I am no "Philly" sandwich expert and don't really care about that in the reviews. This made and excellent steak sandwich anyway. My family was more than satisfied. I added sauteed mushrooms to mine. I will be making these again.

This is a very yummy recipe!  I used beef tenderloin filets that I sliced thinly and my homegrown green peppers and onions that I sliced on a mandolin.  I omitted the marjoram and basil just because I didn't have it on hand.  I loved the spice combination, not too salty.  I used thinly sliced provolone and broiled the whole thing at the end.  It was great!

Very tasty.  The meat needs to be cut very finely and tons of cheese.  Also, make sure to mix the veggies and the meet after both have been sauteed.

Hubby made this tonight.  Quick and delish!  Used tri-tip as we already had it and artisan rolls that were a little thick so could have used a little ajus for dipping.  Flavor was great.  Next time we'll get it perfect.

I definitely give this 5 stars.  My husband and kids love this!  I add sauteed mushrooms to my husband's and omit the onions and green peppers for my kids'.  I also use provolone; my personal taste.  My husband and I think this is one of the best recipes ever!  Thanks!!!

With a couple changes, these were great.  Since it waso n sale, I bought eye of round steak.  Very tender.  I tool another reviewer's suggestion to rub the steaks with spices, then add a little olive oil and let sit for a hour.  I think it deepened the flavor.  I spread garlic spread on the split rolls and broiled, the used sharp provolone, which is a personal preference.

This recipe is so dang good!!!  We love a great philly cheese steak sandwich and this one is awsome.  I always have to add a little heat and did with a splash of hot sauce and this gets a BIG WOW!!  Used provolone because it's what I had and with the broiler on 500 degrees it browned in less than 2 minutes.  My husband was licking his fingers and looking at me in shock, he said " so we can have these anytime we want?",  it was so nice to know that we could.  I had these small New York strips that are inexpensive from the grocery store, they come in a vac. sealed pack, they aren't that great for grilling, so I cut on the bias in 2 inch strips and they were PERFECT!  Thanks soooo much for the recipe, we will most def make again.  Lisa and Mark in Virginia Beach.

Very good according to Joe.  But I melted cheese (use provolone)in the skillet with the meat and veggies.  I also poured a little bit of Hoegaarden Rosee in with the green pepper and onions as I was cooking them.

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my husband and our 2 roommates. They've asked me every week to make it again.  The seasoning for the meat is delicious.  I used red peppers instead of green peppers because I prefer the sweetness of them, and I also put a mayo/garlic mix on the bread. YUMM

Very delicious! I use 2 slices of Provolone per sandwich...which made it great and more authentic.  I also sauteed the veggies first, then the meat.  Once everything was sauteed I put the 8 bun halves on the baking pan, loaded the meat on the bottom pieces, then the veggies, then the cheese and broiled it for about 2-3 mins and they were perfect.  Will be using spice mixture for Fajitas...with a little extra chili powder... :P

As another member suggested, I made a mixture of the seasoning and I keep it in my spice cabinet. The seasoning can make "something special" out of nothing special.

I made a few small changes including no veggies, because I didn't have any on hand, and provolone cheese, because that is what I had in the fridge and my whole family loved it.  Definitely plan to mix a large amount of these seasonings together in a shaker to have on hand all of the time.

Very good, I sliced the meat as thin as I could and doubled the seasonings because I had more meat than the recipe called for and put most of it on the meat but also the left over on the peppers and onions.  I think that we will definitely be making this again.

I just made this for my family last night.  I've tried quite a few steak sandwich recipes, and this one's my favorite so far!  It was easy to make and had great flavor.  The only changes I made were to use provolone, a splash of Worchestershire on the steak, added mushrooms,and used one big loaf of french bread, then sliced it.  Definitely will make again!

Froze meat slightly, to ease slicing, added 1 TBSP olive oil and seasonings with meat in a large ziplock let marinade for a few hours.  When they were almost done cooking i added a splash of beef broth just to moisten and they were perfect.

My whole family enjoyed these, and they were very simple.  I used bison steak instead of beef.  We'll include this on our regular rotation.

My boys loved this sandwich,cut steak into small cubes and let marinate for several hours, used provolone. I dont eat red meat, but was very tempted, it smelled so good. Served it w/baked spicy fries.

Loved the seasoning in the steak. Diced up a red pepper, sweet onion, and mushrooms and sauteed them in. Layered them with american cheese and broiled them for a few minutes. The more cheese the better!

Wow..that is a good sandwich. And I don’t usually like red meat. Maybe I liked it so much because I took my time and sliced it very thinly. I then put all the seasoning, oil, and meat in a plastic bag and let it marinate for a few hours.  And because provolone is my favorite cheese, I had to use it instead of Swiss. Thanks for a very flavorful sandwich. Oh...if you like saute'ed mushrooms, make some room for them too.

My boyfriend likes this because it's so easy and fast to make. We didn't have thyme and marjoram,but it tastes great without it. Instead of using garlic powder and salt seperately, I use garlic salt. If you have a non-stick pan, no need to have oil. This is yummy. We make it pretty often.

We really enjoyed this.  I don't know about it being "Philly" but it was very good.  We used mozz as that is all I had on hand.  Using shaved beef is best.

Really good recipe.  The meat was seasoned really well, and it was very easy to make.  We also mushrooms to the veggie mix.  Who love Cheesesteaks loved it.  Alhtough, himself and other family members who have had authentic philly cheesesteaks, stated that it is very good but not at all like an authentic philly cheesesteak, which is why I gave the four stars.  Otherwise it is five on taste.

To my family these did not taste like a your typical Philly Cheesesteak sandwich but they were good. We followed the recipe exactly. We will keep this recipe but just look for another recipe for that true Cheesesteak sandwich.

I really loved these. I believe these will be a monthly staple in our house. I did make some changes. I used round steak sliced extremely thin. I marinated it for a few hours. I left out the peppers and onions because I don't like them. I did saute sliced mushrooms in butter for about 10 min over med. heat. I put the meat, mushrooms, and topped with provolone cheese on the sub roll prior to putting in the oven for 5 min.

wow, we really loved these yummy sandwiches! no changes made aside from using sirloin tip chipped steak & substituting the swiss cheese with provolone. toasting the inside of the buns ahead of time (& afterward) gave them a wonderful texture. many thanks for your great recipe wendy!

This was my first time cooking Philly steak.  Followed recipe exactly, but omitted thyme and marjoram because I didn't have any on hand.  I also omitted cooked onion and bell pepper. We served on toasted white bread with melted American cheese slices since we had no hoagie bread or swiss cheese.  Turned out great!

The flavor of these sandwiches was good, but I had to chop up the meat into tiny pieces after cooking because the beef sirloin was very chewy.  I am pretty sure I bought the correct cut of meat, and I am not sure why I seem to be the only one with this problem, but once I chopped up my cooked slices, the sandwiches were delicious.  It just took about 10 extra minutes of chopping to make the meat soft enough to chew.

This was good.  I marinated the meat in all the spices + 1 TBSP of worchestire sauce then cooked it on griddle.  Soft and less calories than frying.

I made this last night for my husband and it was a huge hit.  I have already shared the recipe with my co-workers.  
I sauted fresh mushrooms along with the onions and pepers and used Provolone cheese instead of swiss.  I then served the sandwich with steak fries and that was it.  
This will be going in my recipe book for future reference - thanks wendy!

I don't think it is a true Philly steak sandwich but the flavor is excellent.  I added mushrooms as well and had leftovers for lunch!  Definetly will make this again.

We were impressed with this recipe!  I subbed provolone because we prefer it to swiss, but any cheese would be good.  We added zesty italian dressing, which was the perfect finishing touch.

I had to fiddle around with the seasonings so it was how we like it. They were tasty enough but way too dry. If I were to make them again, I would simmer the beef/peppers/onion with some tomato sauce.

This is the biggest travesty I've seen on this site.  A REAL Philly cheesteak does not have STRIPS of meat, its slices. It doesnt have all of these seasonings either...its just meat, cheese (cheese wiz, american and sometimes provolone) and a good roll.  

While I dont doubt that the meat is good I did use it in a stir fry, it does not deserve the title of a Philly Steak Sandwich. Trust me, if you've ever been to South Philadelphia, they would laugh at you if you tried to tell them this is a Philly Steak Sandwich!

The spices in the rub were a great combination.  I didn't have swiss cheese so I used mozzerella instead.  I used wheat hoagie rolls. These were very tasty.

Overall, I think the mixture with the seasonings was good, a little spicy. My husband liked it. I sauteed mushrooms with the onions and bell pepper. I also opted for provolone instead and used hawaiin bread (buns) . I spread butter on the buns, layered the meat and veggies topped with cheese, and put in 500 degree oven for about 3 minutes. The bread makes a whole lot of difference in the taste. It milds out the spices of the meat.

Good sandwich, takes a bit of work. Much less greasy than a philly from a restaurant, which I really liked. I left out the pepper and added mushrooms, used mozzarella in stead of swiss. I will cut down on the thyme, marjoram and basil a little next time, the flavor was a little too strong for me, but will definitely be making again.

I thought the meat was still bland, had to add lots of Worcheister sauce to it.  I also cooked the onions and peppers in Worcheister sauce.  Used provolone cheese instead of Swiss.

Used this as a basis, I had to be a little creative as I didn't have everything on the list handy.. Took 2 t-bone steaks and cut them into slices, stuck it in a sealed container with soy sauce and minced garlic for a couple hours in the fridge. Sauteed mushrooms and green pepper in butter and soy sauce as well. melted some mozzy cheese on 3 hoagie buns, cooked up the steak with onion flakes, crammed it together and poured more mozeralla cheese on it. Wrapped the entire sandwhich in foil and cooked 2 min. each side... nuking the bread first helped keep it moist. Husband said it was "out of the ballpark, over the leftfield wall, into the parking lot and a smash into a windshield, cook it again anytime." He ate 2 of the sandwiches right off the bat and saved the other for lunch tomorrow. :)

Great sandwich, I made this last night using left over pieces of steak that I had cubed and frozen.  I simmered the cubes in chicken bouillon in my crock-pot for about 4 hours until the meat shredded, drained most of the bouillon, added the spices and then let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  We really enjoyed this.

We LOVED these sandwiches.  The flavor was great (we didn't have paprika or thyme- but it didn't seem to be lacking anything).  My husband found beef for stroganoff (I think it is probably similar to a stir fry beef)at the grocery, it was sliced already, so it didn't take long at all to put these sandwiches together.

These were delicious in my opinion. I have never had a true philly cheesesteak sandwich, but who cares about the name-these are yuummy! I used the seasonings and a little oil on a pound of flank steak and let it sit for about 1 1/2 hrs. Then I grilled it on high heat. I used provolone cheese. Turned out tender and delicious!

The seasonned meat is fantastic.  I used sandwich cut sirloin.  I will definately make this again, but next time I will not use swiss cheese.  I think i might use either provalone or maybe a colby-jack.

These were really good, though the seasoning was a little much for my husband and me.  We used round steak and a mozzarella/smoked provolone blend for the cheese.  Will make again with lighter seasoning.

These were sooo good...and not to mention easy! I buttered the rolls before stuffing them, and put them in the oven for about a minute to let the butter melt. I then took them out and stuffed them. This just added some moisture and flavor. I do agree that it is a different taste from a true Philly Cheesesteak - but still AWESOME - dad and boyfriend were in heaven!

I was concerned about there being no wet ingredients in the flavor mix. No need for concern. The spices blended so well together and created a great taste. We ate them on dark wheat hoagies with swiss cheese. YUM!

Sorry, folks. I'm sitting about 20 miles away from Philadelphia at this very moment, and can tell you, no one around here would recognize this as a Philly Chesse steak. Tasty,but not a Philly.

I had a little steak left over from steak night so I tried this recipe. I was a little skeptical about the spice cocktail but followed it to the T. I used a ciabatta roll because that's what I had on hand. The spices made that sandwich one of the best I've ever eaten. Thanks!

I love the flavor of the seasoning blend. I sauteed the veggies first.  I used shaved beef that I picked up from Target, tossed it in the seasoning mix, and seared it in a hot cast iron skillet until the beef was cooked through and had some crisp edges. The cook time was minimal for the beef because it's shaved so thin. 
The meat was so flavorful that my husband asked for this at least once a month!

Not the best cheese steak I've had, but not the worst. Wish I had not used my best ribeye in the freezer :(
Next time I'll leave out all the spices and just salt and pepper

Used thin provolone and butter to saute the steak and vegetables.  Marinated meat in seasoning and olive oil for 6 hours.   Rob liked it so making it again, Thanks.

The meat was seasoned well.  I added some chopped pickled jalapeno with the green pepper and onions and served on crusty rolls.  Makes for a very good soup and sandwich lunch … I had tomato.

I made the "Philly" using 80/20 ground beef, (that's what I had on hand) and served it over a bed of lettuce. I know it's not the original recipe, but the flavor was the same, without the calories and carbs associated with the bread. Update: With the leftovers, I added a diced/sauted  jalapeno pepper and about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It really kicked it up a notch!

So I was very disappointed in this sandwich I knew something was off when it said to cut the meat into 2 inch slices but I continued. The seasonings were good but maybe it was the beer I picked for the meat but right now I'm eating this sandwich and all I can taste is PBR ????. I won't make this again.

These are delicious!  Love the spice mixture - makes the meat so flavourful (had all the spices on hand except for the marjoram).  Also the key is to have super thin slices of steak.  We tried both provolone and swiss and both were good.  Next time I'll try what other reviewers have said...melt the cheese on the meat and stir together.

rubbed spice mix over roast with a little olive oil and let set overnight.  Cooked in slow cooker then shredded for sandwiches.  Allowed guests to top anyway they liked.

This was really good! My husband  and older kids loved it!  I sautéed the veggies separately from the meat and then added them together at the end for a couple minutes to make sure it didn’t come out watery.  Worked great.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The seasonings for the steak are so tasty!  My family loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use provolone cheese instead of swiss.  One of the times I made it the grocery store was out of hoagie buns so I used ciabatta rolls.  My family actually liked that even better.

Fantastic sandwich! 
Some complained that it isn't an original Philly. Fine. it's not,  but it is delicious!  I only added soy sauce to the oil. All else was the same and so freaking good! Thank you for sharing

This was a great dish for lunch. I’ve had a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich before so I cannot compare to others but this still tasted great. I made one change, Mozzarella instead of Swiss.

It was a really good sandwich, if it is a  Philly one though I think we would have to agree to disagree. I really enjoyed anyway. I would say try it out as taste is one of those very personal choices.

Great recipe.  Simple.  Delicious.  I am adding this to list of regular go-to weeknight meals.

That being said, provolone is better on a cheesesteak than swiss.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.

These were awesome! Like other reviewers, I switched from Swiss to Provolone (three slices per sandwich because I like it cheesy). The meat seasoning was awesome! I sauteed everything in butter instead of oil, because I like the flavor better. I also buttered the top bun a little before throwing them in the oven to broil. Next time I will make a roasted garlic butter spread to put on the top bun. Sooooo good!

I knew I shouldn't have added the thyme! However, I have never been a huge fan of thyme but in my opinion and the opinion of my family, the thyme overwhelmed the entire flavor of this dish. I did follow the recipe EXACTLY too! The meat came out nice and tender so that was a plus! Would make again but absolutely no thyme next time!! LOL

Tasty sandwiches and easy to make.  I was out of dried basil and onion powder and they still tasted great.  I will definitely make this again but I will double or triple the onions and green peppers.

We loved it! Wonderful recipe! Of course, I used provolone and I sauteed mushrooms. I also stuffed an Anaheim pepper with cream cheese. mozzarella, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and through it into the broiler while melting the cheese on the meat. It went along with it so well. I will make this often!!!

This was very tasty. I added mushrooms to the onion and green pepper, used provolone instead of Swiss and cut a loaf of French bread in half since I couldn't find hoagie buns. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I cooked this tonight and it was pretty good in my opinion. My husband on the other hand loved it . I tweaked it a bit and instead of just "frying it I boiled it with the ingredients  and added fresh garlic, Lea and Perrins , a little finely sliced celery and 4 table spoons of butter . Put in the veggies and saute'd them till tender and made an au jus  out of the drippings  .I used Muenster cheese just for a try and it worked for us . I'll make this for him again but don't think I'll have it . Maybe with chicken breast ? I'm ashamed to admit I'm a very picky eater  I read too much how food is made

Cut the steak into really small cubes instead of slicing the meat. After we mixed the seasonings onto the meat, we let marinate in frig for about 1/2 hour. Combination of spices gave very good flavor to the steak. Really liked this sandwich a lot!!

I made this it's an easy recipe. My only problem with it is that Basil is a strong spice so the first time I made it , I tasted to much Basil for my taste. So the next time I just cut the amount in half and worked out great. Simple , easy and doesn't take to much time to make.

I love this recipe.   The things I did different was I used NY strip steak (i had on hand,).  I sliced the meat with my food processor.  I used provolone cheese. I also added mushrooms (just a preference).  I also didn't have marjoram on hand, but the seasoning was still wonderful.  I have a son who is a picky eater and He loved this (with the steak and cheese only).  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a pretty good steak sandwich. The Swiss cheese is really all wrong for it to be a Philly though. If I make it again, I'll use Cheez Whiz or at the very least provolone.

Really good recipe. I highly recommend it, and that's coming from a picky eater. Seasoning goes great with the meat. This makes for a really good lunch or even a quick dinner. Two thumbs up!

I'm sorry, but not only did we feel the spices didn't create a balanced flavor, it smelled the opposite of delicious when cooking it. I wished I passed on this.

Very very good.  Instead of sirloin try skirt steak and cut it very thin across the grain, very tender and delicious.  I also added mushrooms and used red peppers instead if green.  Yummy

Great seasoning. I used provolone cheese instead of swiss, and subbed mushrooms for the green peppers, just for taste preference. Turned out very good. The kids especially liked it.

Fantastic seasoning and recipe. I used ribeye steak and sautéed in a cast iron skillet, which makes a big difference. To the bun I added a little mayo with crushed garlic. Also added 4 cremini mushrooms to the onion mix. Really good! Will make this regularly now. Thanks.

Great stuff... the biggest pain is probably just getting the meat sliced sufficiently small.  I find that red pepper in place of green pepper is better.  And I also added about 6 small mushrooms diced to the pepper,onion mix for topping the cheese steaks.  MMMMMM

Very good. We added some garlic, and subed the swiss cheese for cheddar. I also heated up a can of Cambells Beef Broth and used that as an au juice. Very tasty :)

Probably would give 3 1/2 stars.  Okay, the flavor of the meat was nice, but didn't really go with the philly steak theme.

This was delicious, even though I did NOT make Philly steak sandwiches.  I mixed all the spices into ground (round) beef and patted the mix into burgers that I fried in a skillet.  Topped them with the sautéed pepper and onion, and then the Swiss cheese.  I used a little more than 1 oz. of Swiss per sandwich, and it was not enough.  Next time I would use a good 1-1/2 oz. per sandwich.  I’ll bet this would make an excellent sandwich with the beef sirloin strips!!!  Very Good my way too.

We've had this several times and it is wonderful. Hubby loved it and he's very picky. Nice for a Summer Saturday lunch.

Pretty good recipe..the steak I choose was too tough though. Next time I will try a different kind of meat.

Delicious, even if they aren't a 'real' Philly steak sandwich.  I made a slight change in the seasonings and substituted summer savoury for the marjoram, and I couldn't make enough of them fast enough!

These sandwiches were good and really easy! I've made them a couple of times for my boyfriend, and he loves them :) I leave out the onion and just saute the green pepper along with the beef. Also, I use provolone cheese instead of the swiss. Thanks!

Even with the seasoning, we thought this was bland. My husband ended up putting some ketchup on his sandwich. I used provolone cheese.

Soooooo good!  I love Philly Steak Sandwiches, and this is going to become a regular with me.  Very east, and VERY tasty.  I susbstituted oregano for marjoram (couldn't find it at the store), left out the bell peppers (NOT a philly thing to do, and I personally hate them), and used provalone cheese, as most philly's use also.  Amazing, great recipie!  I will definatley use that combination of spices elsewhere and see what I can come up with :)

Yummy. I left out the marjoram and bell pepper because there wasn't any around but added mushrooms to the sauted onion. I also was low on swiss so I did a combo of swiss and mozzarella which was pretty good. I would like it to be a little on the sweet side personally. Next time I have to make sure to toast the bread before putting it to broil.

This is wonderful!! I did add a little more salt, pepper and garlic powder. I added a bunch more onion too (gots to have lots of it!). I read some where that the bread makes all the difference, so I tried the Kings Hawaiian sandwich rolls and they worked great! This recipe is a must!

This was delicious and very spicy!  I served these on a big crusty loaf of sesame seeded Italian bread and it was so good!  The only thing is that my husband thinks I may have taken roast beef out of the freezer rather than minute steak.  Either way, it was great.  Will definitely make again!

We love this recipe! The blend of spices and herbs is awesome. I find I used a little more of each to get it very spicy. My husband is always happy when I tell him we're having cheesesteaks! We usually use muenster or provolone cheese. Definitely try it.

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the advice of LVERNE1 and added worcestershire sauce along with some BBQ sauce to the beef. I also used red pepper as I prefer it over green and added fresh chopped parsley to the onion mixture. The spices are great - the chilli gives it a nice kick.

Very good...especially with all of the spices added but definitely nothing like a regular philly cheesesteak sandwich. No where near that amount of spices are added to it. Very enjoyable though and would definietly make it again.

Nice combination of spices (I don't usually cook with thyme and marjoram). The meat seems a little more authentic if you cut out the chili powder in the rub and serve with hot sauce instead, but good in either case. I added a little meat tenderiser, too, since I used sirloin and that can be a little tough cooked like this.

I have minimal experience cooking beef other than hamburger, but this recipe sounded great!  I gave it a shot.  I agree, it was quite involved and time consuming, but I enjoyed the process.  The aroma as the meat cooks...mouthwatering!  The swiss cheese was the perfect complement.  I didn't slice the meat thin enough, so it kept slipping off the buns, but the taste was delicious.  Thanks, Wendy!

I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could.  I sliced the hoagie rolls and spread butter on the rolls & broiled them until light brown.  I think it would be great w/ sauted mushrooms.  Oh, yeah, I did delete the onions and peppers (yuck! personal opinion of course)
