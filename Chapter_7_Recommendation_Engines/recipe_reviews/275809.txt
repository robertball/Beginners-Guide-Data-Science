I love these cookies! Easy recipe and I didn’t change anything. The cookies tasted a bit like banana bread because of the cinnamon. I have a recipe for a similar recipe and I have to say, these definitely rival mine. Thank you for a great recipe!!

This may seem like a simple question but your "Directions" leave out a step or something.

Do you make cookies/balls out of the 'batter' or just lay it flat on the cookie sheet and cut them after?

I added a half teaspoon of salt and baking powder the second time I made these .  The recipe way and that way are both good.  The third time I used vanilla yogurt and a tblsp of sugar. Kids liked  that the best bc it was a little sweeter. 
You can spoon them or make in a pan.
So easy and tasty.

Just like banana bread, this is a great recipe for when you've got a few over-ripe bananas!!!! I made the recipe almost as instructed (added 5 oz of vanilla yogurt instead of 1/3 cup of plain). ***Did NOT need to adjust cook time for Convection Oven.*** Rolled batter into balls, placed on parchment-paper-lined baking sheet, flattened the ball just a smidgeon, and baked as instructed for 20 minutes. VOILA!

After reading reviews, I made the following changes: added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla.  Left out cinnamon.  Used 5oz Chobani less sugar Madagascar Vanilla & Cinnamon yogurt.  My bananas were ripe, but not very ripe, so I creamed together the bananas and yogurt before adding the other ingredients. I followed the rest of the recipe, spooning teaspoons of batter onto parchment paper. Baked 20 minutes.
Loved the banana taste!  Had two with coffee and now feel full. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again.

My family found them a bit bland and I even doubled the cinnamon.  I pushed them down into a sheet pan & cut them into 12 bars 5 minutes after I took them out of the oven.  They held together very well.

I didn't get a chance to make them yet, but the way the recipe reads currently, is that you put the entire bowl of ingredients in the oven and bake it that way! Lol, thanks for the giggles! ;)

I make a cookie with the same basic ingredients but no yogurt.  I add toasted coconut, choc chips and raisins.  You can get addicted to them!  They are quite filling and make a great snack in the middle of the day.

Not enough ripe bananas, only one.  Added not quite ripe banana with some pumpkin and peanut butter and silvered almonds.  I like sweet and added 2 table spoon of brown sugar.  Will tweak it again.  Interesting base to use.  Not bad, could be better.  More peanut butter next time.

I like these for actual breakfast! I'm a big fan of oatmeal banana cookies, but most are too sweet and not substantial enough for breakfast. These are like having my morning bowl of oatmeal in handheld form. I subbed walnuts and a few chocolate chips for the raisins. I think it makes them more satiating. Will definitely make these again when I have overripe bananas.

I'm going to try dried plums instead of raisins and see if that sweetens it a bit.

I didn’t use enough raisins so the cookies could have been a little sweeter if I did.  Great healthy breakfast grab & go.

Only changes were to add 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and baking powder as suggested by a previous post. The cinnamon was very subtle, which usually is preferable not to overpower, but I may add a little more next time. Plenty of raisins; in fact if you are not crazy about raisins try adding just a half cup. They really do enhance the cookies and give it a natural sweetness. I like to have a little something with my coffee in the morning and these fit the bill perfectly. No added sugars,  no flour, and very tasty.

I made couple of changes adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla and ½ teaspoon of salt. They taste good but are too moist. I think if I make them again I will flatten them out more (as they do not spread).

I've been looking for a way to make my own granola bars, without adding marshmallow, syrup, honey etc. This recipe will be a great place to start. I'm not thinking of these as cookies, and since I've really reduced my sugar consumption, these taste sweet enough, without all those raisins, to me.  I used plain kefir instead of yogurt, and cut the raisins to 1/4c. I used large flake oatmeal. I let it sit for 30min. So the texture turned out on the wet, gummy side. I'll make these again for sure, using yogurt as listed, to dry them up a bit. A great way to eat your oatmeal while driving to work! Thank you!

I made them exactly as shown. I had a half of one. They were soggy inside (raw-like), but edible because only the Oats really need to be cooked.  I won’t eat the other half and I know my partner would not eat them. The next time I will add the 1/2 t salt and baking powder and maybe an egg.  The concept is good, no fat, not a lot of sugar, oatmeal, etc, but they have to taste good too. I think the author is missing an ingredient or two.

I'm sorry but these were terrible.  It was a waste of good oats, & raisins.  I ate one and threw the rest away.

I've made a similar version but like this one a bit more.  Super easy, super healthy and super filling for a grab and go snack and pre and post workouts.

It was dry and didn’t have much taste. I added a little more sour team and a teaspoon of honey and then they tasted worth eating.

Certainly healthy and chewy, but much more texture and flavor with berry bits, honey and wheat germ.

Very good. Quick and easy. I used chocolate chips instead of raisins and vanilla yogurt because that’s what I had on hand.

I did not make any changes... the baking time was perfect.  I took another reviewer’s suggestion and flattened them to make more of a cookie shape.  They were delicious. I found it difficult to walk away from them.

I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. They turned out so good, very moist, thought they were to be  crunchier.

Followed the recipe exactly and used Old Fashioned Oats not quick., and they came out great. I got more then 12 however. Better then banana bread, healthier and lower calorie I think, but there was no nutritional information listed.

I was frustrated since there were no directions on type of surface to bake them on--greased, ungreased, parchment paper--size of cookies and how far apart on the cookie sheet. Mine seemed a bit too bland so maybe riper bananas would have helped.

I've made these several times. Every time I try to add something new. I've used dried cranberries, honey, and chia seeds. I plan on trying to roll the top with sesame seeds or coconut. Maybe add chopped nuts or maple syrup. Staying with the recipe, they are good, but I think need a dash of sweetener, honey, brown sugar, Stevia or something. And because bananas vary in size, it's important to get the moisture right in the beginning. It will stiffen up as it sits for 20 minutes before baking so I like it to be a little mushy initially.
