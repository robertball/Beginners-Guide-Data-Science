This recipe deserves more than 5 stars! I made this for Easter for my diabetic parents and EVERYONE liked it! It can be difficult to find a GOOD diabetic recipe that tastes "normal", this didn't taste sugar free at all! I used Splenda White sugar for the cake and Splenda Brown sugar for the topping and used real butter~Absolutely WONDERFUL! Thanks for a tasty & healthy recipe :D

I love this recipe!  The only tip I would pass along is that it seems there is too much butter in the topping mix.  I have had to add flour to get the right consistancy.  I have made it both with Splenda and regular sugar and both times it was a huge hit!

I made this to take to work today and everyone loved it; it disappeared quickly! I was afraid to make it with all Splenda, fearing that articial sweetener aftertaste, so I made it with half Splenda and half regular sugar.  (For the brown sugar, I used 3/4 cup regular brown sugar, and 3/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. For those of you who are diabetic, please be aware that Splenda Brown Sugar Blend contains 1/2 regular brown sugar...it's NOT sugar free!)  I also subbed 1 cup of white whole wheat flour for one of the 3 cups of all-purpose flour. I baked it in a catering half-pan, about 9x12 inches, for 43 minutes, and it came out just right!

As a diabetic who has long searched for a good sugar-free recipe, I was encouraged by the previous reviews, but I have to say, I don't agree with them at all.  If you really can't tell that this is made with sugar substitutes, it's because you haven't had the real thing in so long.  My husband, who didn't know it was made with substitutes, took one bite and said, "There's something wrong with this."

YUM!  I can't believe this sugar free coffee cake tasted as good as it did.  I made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit!  I used Splenda brand white and brown sugars.  I used the frozen blueberries and thawed them before adding to the batter.  I baked it an additional 10 minutes longer than called for because the middle wasn't quite set.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for my diabetic father. Instead of making a cake I made muffins. It was quick and easy to make him a basket of them for a little father's day suprise. We all enjoyed them for breakfast with coffee.

I made this for friends who are diabetic, and it's the best reduced-sugar cake I have tried making so far. Splenda cakes tend to be rather dense, but this one was fluffier.  It's not as fluffy as a cake that uses regular sugar, but it's definitely fluffier than any other Splenda cake I have tried making.  I made it during the summer, so I had fresh blueberries that were in season.  For the topping, I used Splenda Brown Sugar blend (which contains some real brown sugar, so it's not sugar-free).  Instead of one full teaspoon of vanilla, I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  I know from experience that this combination works really well to bring out the taste of blueberries.  The recipe yielded two 6" round cake pans.  I would definitely make this recipe again. Thanks :)

I made this with regular sugars and it was moist and delicious. I suggest baking it 5-10 min. longer than recipe calls for. This one's a winner!

Wow!! I am Type 2 Diabetic and 9 months pregnant. I don't know why I couldn't have found this recipe sooner. It is fantastic. I feel so guilty eating it because it doesn't taste sugar free. Will make again real soon.

Loved this recipe! I mixed raspberries in with the blueberries, and left out the cake topping (mainly because I couldn't get my hands on any brown sugar substitute) and everyone who tried it loved it. Don't know what's going on with those who don't like the outcome - maybe it depends on the quality of sugar substitute used?  Also, be wary of vanilla extracts. I know it's not much, but I checked out three bottles and two of them had water and sugar as their primary ingredients -- the third, vanilla essence, had no sadded ugar, only vanilla. :)

Veerrrry delioucious!!  I'm eating eat as I'm typing this review!! I made it in 4 servings instead of shown, so there was no need to use 9/13 pan.  Instead I have used pan commonly used for baking banana loaf, but it still came out fantastic!  I gotta say, after coming on to this website to subdue my sugar craving, this recipe was quick and easy.  But I've used a real sugars(I'm non-diabitic), and I found it bit over sweet for my taste.  I guess I would LOVE to try it again with bit less sugar.  Oh, especially LOVED the crumble part.

This was very good. I added about an 1/8 of a teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg to the cake batter to give it a more traditional flavor. I also combined equal parts of splenda and dark brown sugar to give it a more complex flavor for the topping. Will definitely make again soon. YUMMY!

Yummy!!  I could not find the type of brown sugar called for so I used the splenda type.  However, it is 1/2 real sugar...so I scaled down the topping quite a bit.  I only used 1/2 cup of the splenda brown sugar and added enough flour and butter to make it crumbly, I still used 2 teaspoons cinnamon though.  For us it was plenty of topping.  This is a yummy "almost" sugar free cake made with the splenda brown sugar. Thanks for another great recipe!!

I made this in a 9-inch pan and it turned out perfectly. Be sure to reduce the amount of topping by about half if you bake the cake in a round pan to account for the smaller surface area. I've also made this with real sugars. The result is equally good.

This was wonderful! My mom was recently diagnosed as a diabetic and I was looking for diabetic friendly recipes for her and stumbled upon this one, which was perfect because she LOVES sweets. The only change made was that instead of using the malitol brown sugar we used 1 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar combined (Thanks Kelly!). This looked so beautiful once finished and it tasted even better! Seriously, you can't even tell it's sugar free! I know we'll be using this recipe often. Thanks for posting. :)

Made the Splenda version and it was great!  Used one cup of whole wheat flour also.  Added pecan pieces to the topping and it made it so much better.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Warning: Read the splenda directions. Even 30 minutes baking time was too long for mine. It says check 7-10 minutes before the suggested baking time. I added 2 cups of blueberries. Also, I added 1 teaspoon of orange extract instead of the vanilla.  Still bland. If I make this again, I'll add more splenda and maybe some cinnamon.  I did NOT make the topping. Served with sugar free cool whip.

This is great but you state that it has 44.7 grams of carbs and that is what mosst of us diabetics can have for one meal.  I can have 45 so I would have to just it that for a whole meal.  Now we know why it taste so good.

MOST DEFINITELY a 5 star recipe!!!  I made one mistake though.... I cooked it in a pan the size of a bread loaf.  The kind you cook meat loaf in or banana pudding.  I had to cook it for over an hour @ 350.  This caused it to be a little tough on the outsides, but I'm sure, when cooked in a bigger pan, it is PURRRRR-fect!

This was soo good for being very low in sugar.  I love sweets but I don't need all of the sugar I get from them.  I did use whole wheat flour for the cake and both white and brown Splenda.  I turned out great.  Still very moist even with the wheat flour.

This was delicious.  My (non-diabetic) husband gobbled up the portions I left for him, without knowing recipe used Splenda.  However, this is not a low calorie dessert, as it uses 2 1/2 sticks of butter.  Having said this, I will make it again.

easy and delicious!  one can also substitute the diabetic sweetners in this recipe with half the amount of regular sweetners and it still comes out fantastic!  i also add rolled oats to the crumb topping for extra crunch and nutrition!  thank you!

I love this recipe and make it all the time!
Today, after I had made the batter I realized I was out of blueberries. So, I chopped up frozen strawberries and used them instead. It turned out great!
I also like to substitute olive oil instead of butter, real brown sugar and add an extra egg.

This was pretty good. It definitely doesn't taste "sugar free" but it also isn't very sweet tasting, almost a tad bland for a dessert. Might try adding some spices next time, cause lack of super sweetness is usually a good thing to me. I made this pretty much exactly as written. Used some healthy subs, like egg beaters and 1% milk. Also subbed a cup of flour out for a cup of whole wheat flour. And used splenda blend brown sugar (cut in half as the bag says) for the topping. Came out great. Wouldn't change a thing except for some more spices (more cin, vanilla, nutmeg maybe?).

I made this for my father's birthday and mailed it back east. It was wonderful! Both my parents who have type 2 absolutely loved it! It ships great and stays fresh for a while. My brother, who isn't diabetic, loved it also and so did I! Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this for a diabetic friend. I found the cake to be lacking in flavor, but my friend thought they were to die for.  I definitely liked them better warmed up.  When cold they seemed to crumble a lot.

Try this recipe with a bag of frozen mixed berries.  It's great (but chop up the big berries before you put them in).  I used Splenda brown sugar blend.  In moderation, a diabetic can easily enjoy this cake.  Absolutely wonderful.

This was my first attempt at cooking with a sugar subsitute - my father-in-law is diabetic. I wasn't hoping for much, honestly, but it turned out really well! It was a little more dense than a traditional coffee cake, but the flavor was great and everyone loved it.

I was diagnosed with pre diabetes just recently and was missing dessert, and we had just gone and picked fresh blueberries, so I was looking for a sugar free recipe when I came across this one.  I am SOOO glad I found this it is absolutely AWESOME!!!! My other half is not diabetic and also thoroughly enjoyed this!!!  I used blueberries that we had frozen and had to cook it for about 10 min longer.  I will be recommending this to all people I know who are on low or no sugar diets!

I'd give this one 10 stars if I could. My husband cannot have sugar so we both went insane for this moist luscious treat. 
I used frozen blueberries and only sprayed my pan with non-stick spray. 
No extra added time used and came out, as my youngest daughter likes to say: PERFECTO!

I made this recipe with blueberries from the backyard and "regular" sugar. I had no trouble with the recipe as it was very easy to make. We all thought it was delicious, and it stayed moist for days (and then it was gone). The only bad thing I heard about it was that the topping "wasn't what I expected it to be." I thought the topping was great, but I guess if someone really didn't they could use a different one. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for the future.

This was not very good at all.  It could have been my error, but the taste and the texture were off.  I'm always looking for sugar-free recipes because my mom is diabetic.  I'll keep searching.

This recipe was delicious.  I made it for my grandpa who is diabetic but loves his sweets.  I used Splenda for baking white sugar and Splenda brown sugar mix.  The cake was amazing, I got so many compliments.

This was completely amazing! I made this for work. I work at a dialysis unit and most of the patients there are diabetic. I shared this with the patients and staff and everyone LOVED it!!! It was really easy. I used fresh blueberries. The only thing I did differently was used oil instead of melted butter for the batter. I used splenda white sugar and splenda brown sugar (but used the store brand versions) It turned out better looking than the picture here :) Everyone kept saying I can't believe this is sugar free!! GREAT!!!!

I made this cake with 1/2 splenda. It was absolutely delicious! Very moist, but held together well. The crumb topping is what kills you on calories, though, and I think it would be just as wonderful without it. It would cut a little sweetness out of the flavor, too, if you're baking for less sweet-toothed eaters.

This is the best sugar free dessert I have made.  I used closer to 2 cups, maybe more, of frozen blueberries, dusted in a little flour.  The topping if wonderful and as the recipes says, it is best served straight from the oven.

I made this for my diabetic father and everyone liked it.  I added just slightly more blueberries (not by much, I was just finishing off the bag) and cooked it for 35 minutes.  I would not suggest cooking longer because this was about the ideal moisture level.  I also might have used slightly less brown sugar substitute, which was still plenty sweet.  This was good enough that I would happily eat this even if I weren't making it for someone diabetic.

As a gastric bypass patient, I'm always looking for sugar-free or low sugar recipes to try for my sweet tooth. Unless you do a splenda-sugar free maple syrup blend for the topping (rather than the splenda brown sugar), this isn't really sugar free enough. It was delicious though, I do recommend eating it warm.  Even hubby liked it and he's usually not a fan of my sugar free treat attempts.

I was a little skeptical about these,as I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners,but my dad is a diabetic so I thought I would give them a try. They we SO good,you really couldn't even tell it wasen't made with real sugar.Kind of tasted like a cross between cake and a scone(but not as dry as a scone).For anyone looking for a sugar free recipe,this one is definitely worth making!

Way too much topping. I had enough left over for two more cakes. It was also overwhelmingly sweet compared to the cake itself. However, we ate it and enjoyed it. Maybe I will make it again; but I will definitely hold back on the topping and make sure to only use unbleached white flour. I made the mistake of substituting a cup of bread flour when I ran out. Be ye warned.

I’m always on the lookout for good diabetic recipes for my husband and this blueberry coffee cake was absolutely delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as the recipe stated.  My husband loved it - he had two pieces!  I may try it next time with a cup of wheat flour as stated by a previous reviewer.  Truly a recipe worth its weight in gold!

It was not bad ..... My son liked it. I thought it was too eggy tasting and it was definitely missing something like SALT .... Don't know if I would make it again.

Had issues with it being moist/fluffy. Used frozen blueberries and don’t know if that was the reason it didn’t seem to expand. Seemed more like bread pudding, very dense. Any suggestions for the future or try another sugar replacement recipe for diabetics?

Thank you

I used sugar in the recipe. It was very moist and delicious. My family devoured it in days!!! Definitely will make this again.

I'm a diabetic and had high hopes for this recipe based on all the reviews.  I was disappointed in the outcome-it was missing flavor/sweetness.

It turned out wonderfully!  I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and used slightly less of the  brown sugar and butter than called for to make the topping.  No other adjustments or substitutions made or needed. The whole family loved it! Will make this again for  my diabetic husband!!

My sister is hypoglycemic so I always am looking for sugar free options for her during the holidays. This was DELICIOUS! Not only did she love it, but the whole family did. I had bought a pumpkin pie that never was open because everyone enjoyed this. It's really yummy warm with sugar free vanilla ice cream and a little cool whip. MMMMMMMM

I did not end up making this. I had all of the ingredients except the Malitol. I bought a brown sugar/splenda blend for that(blend is 1 g. of sugar more per serving than malitol). With this substitution, the total carbs for 1/24th of the pan was 38 g. 
of carb! This is a lot. It is also 210 calories per same size piece.

I was initially concerned because the batter was quite doughy, but it was startlingly tasty! My diabetic father-in-law loved it, and so did my non-diabetic hubby.

Absolutely amazing sugar free dessert!! Couldn't even tell it was sugar free!   I normally DO NOT bake but this dessert was so easy.
