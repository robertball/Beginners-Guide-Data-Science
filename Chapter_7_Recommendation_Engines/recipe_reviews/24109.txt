This is like my grandmother's with the exception that the butter was missing. I put in a couple teaspoons of butter and voila! Yes, it is thick but that simply means that the pie won't crumble. I've made the filling thinner but the pie didn't hold togeather as well as this one. I've saved the recipe and will definately use again.

I added 2 tbl butter and a 1/2 c more milk and it turned out alright. I gave it 3 stars because of the confusion. But other then that it was not bad but I don't see myself making it again any time soon. tks anyway.

I have been making this pie for years. A helpful hint:
Use 3 cups milk. It works fine and still sets. You can also reduce the egg yolks to 3. Great for pudding for the kids too! Also don't forget the butter. Two tablespoons.

I was not impressed with this pie.. Just a little too thick more like a fudge pie..reducing the amount of flour may help..

I love to bake and use all recipes almost every day, this recipe does not work.  The filling is very watery and the meringue is off.  If you look at other meringue recipes you'll see that the ratio is always 4 egg whites to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 tsp cream of tarter.  I made grandma's lemon meringue pie yesterday and turned out beautiful, next time will add cornstarch, more cocoa and use standard meringue recipe.

Almost like the ones Mom makes,just a tad different,but excellant nonetheless! I don't understand what gave other reviewers problems,I made it exactly like the recipe and mine came out perfect...even my meringue was great,and it was only my second time making meringue.

Not sure why the semi-negative comments. This is absolutely yummy. Great cure for the munchies, lol.

This is a great recipe. I adjusted just 1 egg white, I did not add the yolk to the pudding. Oven is better at 400 for 8-9 min. Great recipe!

It just didn't work and the filling was very soupy.  I also believe the over temp was over-stated.  425 was too hot.  Meringue nearly burned in two minutes in my temperature accurate oven.

I have tried several chocolate pie recipes to please my husband. I finally found one! He loves it! So I will keep this one handy!
