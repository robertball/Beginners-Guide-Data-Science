After reading the reviews, I made this cake with great expectations.  The recipe itself was easy enough and the batter made up beautifully.  The problem came with the baking.  One reviewer noted that the baking time was excessive as her cake was done in 45'. I believe the problem with this recipe is not with the baking time but with the temperature. 350 degrees is too hot an oven for this delicate cake.  I plan to remake this recipe and bake it at 300 degrees. This recipe can be used in a variety of desserts, and I believe that modifying the baking conditions will resolve any problems.

This was wonderful!  I had never known of a cake that was made like this so I just had to try it.  My daughter's frineds ate the entire cake in 15 minutes and I made a second that same day for my family.  It is nice that it doesn't use as many eggs as most angel cake recipes and has an incredible texture and crust.

Delicious.  Has a great sweet taste.  It's great by itself or with fruit (strawberries, blueberries) - doesn't need icing.  I was intimidated at first by heating the sugar and water - but it wasn't a big deal and was a really easy cake to make.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

This cake is more like a sponge cake.  I think I would make it again but I would need to add some flavor to it.  I think I probably would add some vanilla and either some orange or lemon zest or juice to it and reduce the amount of water to make up for the juice I add to it.

This is the best angel food cake! Plus, there are no leftover egg yolks and you don't need to use as many eggs as in other recipes. The texture is wondrfully moist and fluffy.

My friend and I made this cake...and followed each instruction very carefully. It went in looking like an angel food cake should, but didn't come out looking like one. Sure, it looked like a cake, but it didn't look like it had the light and fluffy texture an angel food cake should. When my friend and I tried it, it tasted like a normal yellow cake, and had  that same heavy texture. It also tasted a bit like egg. I would suggest from making other angel food cakes to try it without the egg yolks. Whoever gave this recipe five stars has never had a real angel food cake.

This cake was tasty but I didn't think it had the consistancy of angel food cake. I decided to try it because I hate wasting egg yolks! My husband loved the flavor but commented it was not spongy and light like other angel food cakes. It's an easy recipe but I prefer other angel food recipes over this one.

not bad for a SPONGE cake ,,, but it is NOT angel food cake! should have read reviews first as baking time is a lot shorter than 1 hour.

Very good flavor. However I found that I had to reduce the cooking time. After 45 minutes I took it out of the over. I also found it difficult to remove from the pan neatly.

Fabulous cake and uses only 6 eggs!  Would try vanilla instead of almond flavoring next time.  Was great dipped in chocolate fondue!  YUM!

I have made many Angel Food cakes so I was excited to try this to use in my trifle......epic disappointment! Taste like eggs. Does NOT hold it's loft and actually fell. The texture is more like sponge cake.  I couldn't help but think that maybe this recipe was edited incorrectly. Thanks for sharing.

THIS CAKE IS NICE AND FLUFFY. I DID ADD SOME VARIATIONS TO THE RECIPE. I ADDED 1 TABLESPOON OF ORANGE ZEST, 1/2 TS OF ORANGE  EXTRACT AND 1/2 TS OF VANILLA. I ADDED THESE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE CAKE IS A BIT BLAND. I ALSO LOWERED THE COOK TIME TO 35 MINUTES AND LOWERED THE TEMPERATURE TO 325 DEGREES. I WORK WITH AN ELECTRIC RANGE SO I KEPT A CLOSE EYE. ALL IN ALL A FABULOUS RECIPE. I PLAN TO SERVE IT WITH A WHIPPED TOPPING AND A TROPICAL FRUIT MEDLEY. ENJOY!!!

Easy to make and I was happy with the appearance of the end product, but oh-my-goodness, it is sickly sweet. I used unsweetened raspberries to cut the sweetness, but my kids (!) still wouldn't eat it; it was THAT sweet. I don't know if cutting the sugar drastically would change the chemistry of the cake and make it fail, but that's the only way I'd try this again.

It turned out not very sweet or flavorful at all--like a bland fortune cookie. I don't claim to have made it perfectly--I made the syrup first and it started to change texture before I added it. It wasn't horrible but not great, again, maybe my fault but it seems others have had problems too.

We call this "Fortune Cookie Cake" because everyone who tastes it says it tastes like a fortune cookie!  It has an Angel Food cake consistency, and mine rose well, but fell in the middle a bit as it cooled.  Overall, it was great with strawberries and whipped cream, and I kinda like the fortune cookie taste! (I did add vanilla).  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe! The cake is delicious, moist and will please the whole family. I didn't prepare the syrup, though, I just mixed the flour and sugar together.

Though this cake was easy to make, and tastes quite good (not sweet though -- very eggy) it shouldn't be advertised as an angel food cake. Also, it took about 20 minutes in the oven, so it's a good thing I didn't leave it in there for an hour!!!

I use this recipe for angel food cake all the time. It's one of our favorites. My husband pulls it apart by hand and will eat almost the whole cake by himself if I don't watch him.

yummy!!  I followed another post and baked at 300 for 50 minutes.  I added 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. almond extracts.  I love the idea of using the entire egg and also using all purpose flour and not needing the cake flour.  I am adding this recipe to my recipe box.
