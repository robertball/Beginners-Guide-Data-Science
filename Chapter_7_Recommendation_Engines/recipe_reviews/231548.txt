Delish!  I didnâ€™t have fresh dill, so I just sprinkled the fish with what I thought was a reasonable amount of dried.   The caper sauce was simple, yet full of flavor.  The fish only needs a thin coat of sauce and I knew the amount was going to be way too much, but I figured I could save it for future use.  At least that was the plan, until hubby used it to top his baked potato and that was the end of that.  Will definitely make again, but in the future I will incorporate the dill into the sour cream sauce instead of sprinkling it directly on the fish.

I've made this recipe three times now.  It's a really good BASIC recipe, but as with all things, I made some changes.  

I add some liquid (about a teaspoon) of the liquid that the capers are in and omit the salt from the sauce.  I also add in some lemon juice to taste.   I also added some finely shopped dill (a couple sprigs).  This makes the sauce a little thinner and much more bold.

I also add a couple drops of lemon juice on top of the fish before I bake it.

This is so good served with yellow rice and a seasoned veggie on the side.

We weren't a fan of this.  The sauce had a strange taste from the capers I believe. I masked it a bit by adding Parmesan cheese, which helped some, but it still wasn't great. My husband took one bite and wrinkled his nose, and the kids scraped the sauce off.  We ate it, but I won't make it again.

Waste of good gulf flounder and caper.  Very poor directions particularly oven times.

Easy and delicious.   Only changes were of necessity - didn't have a 1/2 cup sour cream, so used 1/4 cup plus 2T plain yogurt.  No lemon zest so added 1t lemon juice.Tasted great.
