My family and I enjoyed this recipe. I did not have flat Iron steak but the porterhouse I used was a perfect vessel. The saltiness of the Gorgonzola is a wonderful contrast to the dry rub. I cant say I followed the recipe to the T but I was close. I didn't make the dry rub and apply it but, I added each ingredient to the each steak individually. Nor did I measure the Gorgonzola cheese again I treated each steak individually. Thank you for this wonderful idea of  Gorgonzola cheese and steak!

They tasted ok, but a little bit much cinnamon flavor for me. I expected them to have almost a glaze from the brown sugar, but they didn't. The cheese was good on top, but the rub didn't do anything for my boyfriend or I. Not bad, just nothing we raved about. Someone else might like it a lot though! =)

the rub was too sweet for the fam's taste. i may try this again, but with less brown sugar. i did like the gorgonzola with the wine and onion sauce.

I found this to be a very tasty steak. However, could use less of the Gorgonzola cheese
