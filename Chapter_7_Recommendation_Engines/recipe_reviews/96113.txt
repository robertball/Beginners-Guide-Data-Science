I just made the glaze portion of this recipe to put on boneless/skinless chicken breast. The chicken turned out a bit dry and the glaze had a slight bitter aftertaste. I think it was just me though so will try again on a pork loin, never have had crown roast of pork so will stick with a cut of meat I'm familiar with. will update review after trying again, may have to go from 4 stars to 5.

I thought this was good, not great. I wasn't sure the pomegranate glaze really added anything. I used pork tenderloin.

Loved this!! I didn't have a crown roast, but did have two fresh pork tenderloins and was looking for an alternative to honey Dijon which always seems to be my pork go-to glaze.  I made this glaze as instructed but added the zest of 1/2 of the lime and a splash of balsamic vinegar (only because I love the stuff so much, I'd eat it over cereal). 
I allowed it to reduce a bit on the stove until syrupy then let it cool.   
I put the tenderloins on the BBQ rotisserie and once 1/2 way through cooking I basted them every 10 minutes as instructed and OMG DELISH!! Served with a chop salad and grilled plums with balsamic (again!) glaze.  
I'm going to double this recipe next time and use it on a lamb shoulder on the BBQ rotisserie. Thanks, JAYDA.  Great recipe!
