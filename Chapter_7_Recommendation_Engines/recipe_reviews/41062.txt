This recipe was not at all what I was expecting from pumpkin bread.  It is not sweet and sort of bland.  There is not a lot of pumpking taste to it either.  It would be good as toast in the morning, but do not expect a coffee cake or gift cake type result.  This it not your typical pumpkin bread.

This bread was good but wasn't what I expected. I was hoping it would be sweeter and I even doubled the spices and it still didn't have alot of flavor. Its better than basic white bread but definately not a sweet bread.
