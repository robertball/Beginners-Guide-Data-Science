I made with a white sauce. Not a red sauce. I think a red sauce would hide the delicate flavors of the crab.

This is a delish dish.  Easy to make, great warmed up the next day.  Terrific way to eat more crab.

My husband liked this and that's what counts. I liked it, too. For just the 2 of us, that's 3 separate dinners. Next time, I will add some sliced fresh mushrooms. I will also flour the chicken strips a few at a time instead of trying to do them all at once. Get all ingredients measured out before you start because it goes pretty fast. I served it over spaghetti noodles but next time will use short egg noodles or rice.

Yum! The crab added a unique taste to this pasta dish. It is great heated up too so save the extra for leftovers!

I made this and I think that the marinara sauce is extremely overpowering to the delicately flavored crab. It was fun to make, but the taste of the crab disappeared, and it bummed me out that I had gotten the crabmeat @ $17 for the can.Personally think this would be much better as an alfredo or a wine based sauce.

Love the recipe and thinking this could easily be made a keto dish with minor modifications ...
