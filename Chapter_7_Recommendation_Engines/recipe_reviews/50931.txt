I really don't like deer. I had never even tried it until I married an avid hunter who likes to bring his game home. No matter how much I soaked the meat in salt water, buttermilk, etc etc I could never get over the gamey taste... until this recipe! It is FANTASTIC! I soaked the meat overnight in cider and in BBQ sauce all day. Half of it I used turkey bacon and the rest regular. (regular was better, turkey wasn't bad) It was delicious!! Be very careful not to overcook it or it will be tough and not as tasty. Thick sliced bacon isn't necessary. FINALLY, I have a way of making venison that we can both enjoy. Thank you!
***What's better then grilled venison wrapped in bacon? Adding a slice of onion and wrapping it up with the meat. Yum.

I'm giving it 5 stars because my ex-hubby said it was awesome!  I tried it but I made a HUGE mistake....for some reason I had apple cider VINEGAR in my head when I made the venison!  For future reference...do NOT make this using apple cider vinegar...not good :(  I will definately try this again using apple cider!!

I made this recipe exactly like it appears here.  It is one of the best venison tenderloin recipes I have seen.  I made it one night as a main course and the next night as an appetizer.  It reheated well.

Not for us!  I like sweet flavors with some meats, such as pork and chicken, but the apple cider vinegar doesnt' belong with venison.  We cooked some of our meat with seasonings/spices, and it was great.  I followed this recipe to a "T" and couldn't eat it.  It actually turned me off of venison for a while!!

I made this recipe for my hunter husband, brother and family - there was not a bit left.  At the end I deglased the pan with cider-YUM.  Will be making this again this evening for the WOW factor.

This was very good and I am not a big fan of venison.  There was no gamey taste.  My husband loved it and wants me to cook it for his friends.  I used a hickory flavored barbeque sauce.

Excellent! Excellent! This was the first time I had ever cooked venison and this recipe made me look like an old pro! I would make NO changes except I used toothpicks that were all different colors... (the blue ones left blue holes in the meat- beware!) The flavor was wonderful!! Thanks!

I didn't change any of the ingredients, however I marinated the deer backstrap overnight in the apple cider, then marinated it in BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby rays- Hickory) during the day.  When I came home from work, I wrapped it up in the bacon and baked it @ 350 degrees covered, for 45 min and it was perfectly roasted at a medium rare cooking!  It was absolutely fantastic, and boyfriend gave it great reviews too!!!  Wonderful flavor!

Wow! I mean Wow! I used apple juice and added just some salt and pepper and after I poured out the juice I wrapped the bacon with red onion and jalapeno slices and let the bacon marinade in the bbq sauce also. Grilled for 15-20 minutes and they were perfect!

We've eaten venison in just about every way, and this was by far the best. It was a lot for 3 people, but there were no leftovers. Awesome.

I didnt have apple cider, so i used olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper as my base marinade.  marinaded for 2 hours each mix, and put on the grill at 400* for 11 minutes each side.  perfectly medium rare.  This venison tasted just like filet mignon. I wish i had a steady hunter to bring me more...

Used this recipe and the venison came out GREAT.  Left the venison chunks in the apple cider & barbecue sauce for about 6 hours each.  Cooked until med-well.  Keep an eye on the bacon when cooking, really flames up.  Enjoy.

First of all venison is for me is like going into uncharted territory.  But this recipe did not disappoint, but I do believe I did overcook a wee bit. A few minor tweaks; meat was marinated in Italian dressing for most of the day, no apple cider in the house. Also since grilling was out of the question due to a snow storm, I baked them at 350 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes.  No livery or gamey taste, quite tender, but not the medium rare doneness I was hoping for.  I'd love to try this again using the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We only eat Game meat, so I am always looking for different ways to prepare it. I was very surprised that I didn't need to add any seasoning to this meat. I was going to, but decided to prepare it as stated in the recipe for the first attempt. I am glad I did. This was perfect. I marinated it in apple cider for 3 1/2 hours, then in classic BBQ sauce for 3 hours. Then I wrapped in bacon and secured with toothpick. When I placed them on the bbq, I did not leave. You wouldn't walk away from a pan of frying bacon would you? Once the bacon got crisp, I moved the meat to the other side of the grill.The side that didn't have heat and closed the lid, so that the bacon and meat could cook a little longer without burning. When I told my hubby how I cooked them, he raised his eyebrows (big time skeptic). Then he took a bite and said "MMMM make sure you write down the recipe" Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe!  I would add the tip that you may need to put foil down on the grill.  My backstrap was falling apart even tied together with the bacon.

This was incredible.  I usually start this in the morning, marinate in cider for 6 hours, then bbq for 6.  Christmas night I was outside in 10 degrees cooking this on the grill for dinner.  Nothing I would do to change this.  We use maple bacon and it is the family's new fave meal.  And the leftovers are almost better the next day - cold!

I let the venison sit overnight in the cider. That was really the only thing I did different with this recipe. 
Eventhough my wife does not eat deer meat, she ate two helpings of this. I couldn't seem to get it off the grill fast enough. I can honestly say that the entire family loves this and I will definitly make this again!

i made just 1 change to this. i cut the center out of each chunk of venison. you can use all the center pieces for kabobs. i then put either jalapenos (sp) or scallops in the centers (held in place by the toothpicks).

We loved this.  I'm always skeptical when making venison.  I would suggest good quality BBQ sauce as you do taste that.  We just used whatever bottle that I had and it wasn't our favorite kind so I think the recipe would have been even better.  This was so worth grilling in 15 degree weather.

Incredible!  I made this for Christmas dinner. It was immediately decided that this would be our traditional dinner from now on.  Since I do not care for BBQ sauce, I used A.1. Steak House Marinade - Garlic and Herb. Every mouthful was tender and delicious. Watch the cooking time carefully and remember that the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the grill -- important if you like your meat medium rare, as I do.

I made this 3 times now, I am very impressed.  I agree with KC Masterpeice Hickory sauce, but I like it with regular sliced bacon instead.   Everyone needs to try this.

A+ recipe. There's not very many ways to grill venison but this one is worth it. I threw about 1/3 bottle of Italian dressing into 2/3 bottle of BBQ and the results were excellent. The oil in the dressing helps tenderize and enhance the flavor.

Exactly as everyone says.   Venison has never been a hit in my house. I cut a half backstrap into 12 small medallions.  My wife cautiously took one, prepared to fill up entirely on green beans if she didn't like the deer.  After eating one medallion she took two more, and then she went back for seconds, eating five total.   I ate six myself, and I'm taking the one piece left over to the guy at work who gave us the backstrap.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't have a grill to use, so broiled the meat. Bacon was crisp and blackened, venison was flavorful and tender. My husband is picky, and he LOVED this! Will definitely be making this again!

THIS MAKES MY TUMMY SOOOO HAPPY!!! what a wonderfull recipe. very simple and awesome. my whole family loved it. however, it's was nearing the end of summer and there were no backstrap left in the freezer. had the taste for some venison. i had a small roast but it was summer, i didn't want to have a roast in summer. so i used it to cut up for this recipe. and BAM! it was wonderfull. i did use a little tenderizer since it wasn't as tender a cut of meat. and after the apple cider soak, i sprinkled everything with some onion salt and garlic powder before soaking in barbeque sauce. I WAS AMAZED!!

This tastes great.  I put them on skewers instead of separate toothpicks.  Since it was too cold to use the grill, I broiled the for 10 minutes on each side and they turned out wonderful.  The taste of the cider and barbeque blended very well together. (I used Sweet Baby Ray's) I will definitely be using this recipe again!

OH MY GOD!! YUM! YUM! This is the BEST recipe. Being the first time I prepare venison backstrap and actually ate it. I let it marinate overnight in the apple cider and I used smoky maple bacon.  I prepare this for my friends and my hunter husband and they could not get enough of it. It was so tender and juicy and the bacon gave it such a nice smoky flavor and NO GAMEY TASTE! It deserves more than 5 stars!!! Thank you so much Garry.  Did I mention that this recipe ROCKS!!

Wonderful!  Serve these to friend and make them about 1.5" square.  Also use thinner bacon so it gets crispy, not chewy and fatty tasting.

Great recipe. Why is it folks feel the need to marinate in saltwater? yuk! Buttermilk, maybe, but it always seems to be in an effort to "get rid of the gamey taste". Well thats what makes it venison. If you don't like the gamey taste, cook a hamburger. I love this recipe, its easy, its simple, and if you like the taste of venison, this is how to fix it.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!  I made this tonight and all I can say is OMG its excellent!!  I started it 2 days ago with the apple cider, then yesterday in the BBQ sauce, and grilled tonight.  The only thing was that the bacon didn't crisp up as I had hoped it would but I didn't want to overcook the the cubes of meat.  Thank for this GREAT recipe.  We will be making many more times.

My husband and son are avid hunters.  I've tried just about every venison recipe out there over the last 22 years and this BY FAR is the BEST!  I'd give this recipe more than five stars if possible!

I had company for dinner and served this.  No one knew that it was venison. Everyone, including my three young children (ages 5, 4 and 3) loved this. They all thought they were eating filet mignon.  Needless to say, not a morsel was left!  You could not imagine their shock when I revealed they had eaten venison.  All of my guest with hunters in the family left with this recipe.

This is a definite MUST try!

Turned out really good...I also used an A1 marinade instead of BBQ sauce.  Marinated in the apple cider for 6 hours and the A1 overnight.  I cooked mine on my broiler though, since it's November in Michigan and I didn't feel like firing up the grill.

I am not a meat eater but my husband and son are! I made these for them and they couldn't stop raving about this. My husband says that the gamey flavor is gone and he was able to really enjoy the venison. I did everything the recipe said and it turned out perfectly. This is a keeper!!!

This is a good recipe. The only thing I found was that some pieces had more of a vinegar taste than anything. It was still good but not sure that I would make it again right away. The company did like it though!!

This is a great recipe!  I did make some minor changes.  I didn't cut the meat into chunks but left it whole.  I cooked it on the Foreman Grill on high.  I sprayed with grill with Pam.  I wrapped several pieces of bacon(didn't use all that bacon) around the whole steak and cooked it for @ 10 mins until the internal temp was 145*

WOW! Was that really deer. I have never found a recipe that I can honestly say I couldn't tell it was not beef. This is a keeper. I changed a few things only because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used pineapple juice in place of apple cider for 2 hours. In place of BBQ sauce I used a sauce, I use for sweet n sour venison meatballs. One bottle chili sauce to one small jar grape jelly warmed until melted together. I know that sounds weird but I asked a friend for this sauce recipe at a picnic a long time ago  because it was sooo good ! When she told me that was all there was to it I was amazed. Try it sometime it's really good YUMM

Utterly awesome and simple.  Even people who say they don't like venison are always surprised at how good this turns out. The secret is marinating it for a long time.

This was just excellent.  I am not a fan of venison and we had gotten a package of backstrap from our brother-in-law.  I had to half the recipe because it was a small piece.  I soaked it in the apple cider overnight and then in the barbeque sauce during the day.  I did add a slice of onion before wrapping each piece in bacon.  It was the best meat that I have ever eaten.  Wish I had more!!

This was so simple and delicious.  I couldn't get my charcoal grill going so I used the gas grill.  It was still amazing!  I would recommend this one to anyone.

We enjoy the taste of venison that most people describe as "gamey" so I didn't marinate in the BBQ sauce. I just basted the meat before grilling and it came out beautifuly. Definately one of our favorite tenderloin recipes!

My husband made this for our family. Usually not the family cook, he did a great job and it was delicious. I don't like Venison and I ended up eating three pieces. He used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.

Mmmm! They just melted in the mouth! Marinated in the cider overnight and in the BBQ sauce for about 5 hours. I used regular bacon cut in half, and this was plenty to wrap around the chunks. Being winter, I baked at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes. I served these as an hors d'œuvre at Christmas, and everyone hovered around them until they were gone.

THANK YOU!!! My husband and I both agreed this is the BEST grilled venison steak I've ever fixed! I've often pounded our venison steaks flat, breaded and fried because I was never happy with them grilled but this was wonderful and we can't wait to make it for company! I had planned to follow the recipe exact but apple cider seems to be a seasonal item and not yet in our grocery stores so I ended up buying the instant spiced apple cider and used one pkt of that mixed with 6oz of water. I used KC Masterpiece Original for the bbq sauce then wrapped in thin sliced bacon and put them on metal skewers to grill. Awesome!!! I'm tempted to get some more steaks out of the freezer. :)

This recipe was wonderful!  I only give it a 5 because all game flavor was gone.  Some girls just like some game!  Anyway, my husband and I don't have a grill (apartment living) so we broiled it instead.  About 7 minutes on each side was enough to be pretty well done.  I will use this again, although next time I will simply baste the meat with the BBQ before broiling.

I didn't change a thing, and I won't in the future either.  I did a couple pieces of beef tenderloin alongside just for comparison.  They do taste different, but everyone agreed that one was just as good as the other.

As a lifelong hunter and venison consumer I can vouch that this is a pretty good recipe. I have one major qualm though. The backstrap steak is the equivalent to the "new york strip" not the filet mignon. 
At least in Georgia we refer to the loin as the backstrap and the tenderloin as the tenderloin (which is where the filet comes from).

Absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend said give it 20 stars.  We marinated the meat in apple cider overnight and then the BBQ sauce for 3 1/2 hours.  The meat was tender, and flavors blended so well.  We have e-mailed this recipe to several friends and we will make again and again.

Loved it, sweet BBQ taste.  No Gamey taste.  A spicey BBQ sauce would be better to offset the sweetness of the Apple Cider.  Over cooks easy watch it carefully.

This recipe makes deer taste amazing. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. I have had more compliments on this recipe than anything else I have ever cooked. It is very simple, but still tastes amazing. Also, I agree with every other review, the two marinades make the meat very tender and get rid of almost all of the gamey flavor. Also, if you have thin long cuts of meat (from the processor), then wrap it in two strips of bacon to fully cover it and cook it for maybe half the time, if even that long. Amazing recipe, whoever came up with it deserves an award!

Excellent! My husband has been hunting for over 20 years and I have always enjoyed dishes made with ground venison or venison stew. However, I have never liked venison steak and this was soooo yummy! It was full of flavor with out a gamey taste, and so tender. I bought apple juice by mistake, but it did not seem to make a difference in flavor or tenderness. This is a definate keeper!

This was fantastic!!  I used Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ sauce and maple flavored bacon which I think gave it a really nice flavor!  My boyfriend was very skeptical but LOVED it and claimed it his FAVORITE venison recipe!  Served it with a fresh green salad and made an amazing dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!  We loved it.....and this was our first time cooking venison.  We just used 1 lb. regular bacon and about 16 oz. barbeque sauce.....and discovered that it turned out better to use medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes per side, making sure the meat was still pink in the center.  Wasn't gamey at ALL, tasted just like beef.  Thanks for the recipe!!

HOLY COW! Er...Deer!  This is fantastic!  It's amazing how bacon can totally transform any dish!  Not a huge fan of venison, but my dad is an avid hunter so we end up with lots of meat.  I was looking for something that would cut through some of the gamey-ness and this definately did it.  It doesn't mask the flavor of the deer meat, but rather makes it WAAAY better!  This will be a standard venison recipe from now on!

I've used numerous recipes for venison over the years, and typically prefer to cook it all day in a crockpot....until now. This recipe was, by far, the best venison dish I've ever prepared. My girlfriend can't stand the taste of wild game....from dove breast to deer meat....this time she actually loved it and asked when I planned on cooking it again. The only thing I changed was the amount of time in marinating. I soaked the the chunks in the apple cider for 6 hours, then in the BBQ sauce for another 6 hours. Remember to have a couple glasses of water ready while cooking....the bacon causes flare-ups, so don't walk away from the grill!

thanks for sharing this recipe! the boys at my house are REALLY enjoying these (and even though I'm allergic to venison I have to admit that I've tried a piece or 2! they just smelled to good not to) I made them into about 1 inch pieces for more of an appetizer.  We will definitely be making these again!

Fantastic, couldn't even tell it was venison.  I didn't have apple cider available, so I just used frozen apple juice concentrate and it worked great.

I absolutely HATE venison.  I have cooked it a million ways to try to find a way I like it as we have I think 4 deer in our big freezer.  (My family loves it...)  I cooked this, and I loved it.  I could barely tell it was venison and I made sure there weren't any leftovers! Thank you for giving me a delicious way to use up some of the venison!

Let me just say that I have never eaten so much venison in one sitting! It was the best I have ever eaten. My husband is the one who has been eating venison since he was 2, and he told me that it was the best venison flavoring he has ever had!!! It blew my mind because he is a lover of venison and has had it so often throughout his life.  I did use cubed steak instead of the tenderloin because that is what I had in the freezer, and it turned out wonderfully!What a wonderful taste for such a simple recipe!

An awesome way to introduce venison to non-hunters and a good way to impress old hunters.  Everyone loved it and said it was better than beef or any other venison they have ever made.  I can't wait to get another DOE!

Very tasty!  I live in the hill country of Texas, we eat alot of venison.  Try this recipe and add a jalapeno slice before you wrap the bacon around the venison.  This gives it a little zest.

Great way to grill venison-if you want to grill it. I have always disliked venison outside of stews, chili, etc- but this was actually pretty good. I did have to dip the meat in BBQ sauce, but my 2 boys and husband went back for seconds! Told me to make sure I make it again, so it is a winner in my book!

I made this with a tenderloin that was given to me - already sliced into medallions.  I did everything else the recipe called for, but threaded the medallions onto skewers with a strip of bacon on one side.  Grilled for a few minutes each side, and it was still great!  I should've put a piece of bacon on both sides - some of the medallions were dry.  But the flavor was just sooooo good!!  We ate it all and could not leave the table, we were all wishing there was more somehow!!!

We love this venison recipe.  It even tastes pretty good cold which is unusual for venison.  We've used some other cuts of venison steak and have been equally pleased.  Great recipe and pretty good for you, too!

I tried this on some backstrap I had in my freezer for over 5 years. It had been vacuumed pack but still...I thought I'd try this recipe and if I didn't like it I'd give it to my dogs. My husband would never had let me go for it had he known...since it had been in the freezer for so long. He couldn't guess what it was until I told him. He loved it though!! I cooked the bacon 1/2 way in the microwave before wrapping the deer (someone had suggested that which I think was a great idea so the bacon got crispy and the deer didn't get overcooked). I also used Trader Joe's Sriracha BBQ sauce which is awesome with a slight kick.

Simple easy recipe. I followed it to the T, it was very tasty. Only one thing I will change next time. Just like I do with my filet mignon I will pre cook the bacon about half way so it crisps up better. I should have known but oh well.

Excellent. I recommend 10-15 minutes cooking time, as venison is best served rare to medium rare. The two inch sections result in about a six ounce serving, any less and you will risk over cooking the meat.

Best I've used so far for venison. Cooked it for many non-venison eaters including my wife and they loved it. I've cooked it multiple times. Best way to grill it is to turn grill down as low as it will go and slow cook it. 30-35 mins on my grill. Otherwise it came out tough.

This was really good! I served it at our hunting lease to four of my buddies and it was a hit. The Apple Cider was spot on!!!!!! I took KC192's idea and added a slice of sweet red onion to it on the grill, BOOM, it was great. This is my favorite dish now!

We had venison tenderloin.  I marinated it for 2 nights in balsamic vinegar, soy, worchestershire, franks hot sauce, minced garlic, pepper flakes, and paprika.  We grilled it on High for 3 minutes each side.  YUMMY!

Technically, the backstrap is the "top loin" or "t-bone" (a porterhouse cut is the backstrap with the tenderloin attached). The tenderloin/filet mignon is under the spine, inside the body cavity, the backstrap is above the spine, outside the body cavity. STILL, it is an excellent, tender cut. Nice touch with cider!

This is one awesome deer tenderloin recipe!  My mother and girlfriend never eat deer meat and they loved this recipe.  It's simple and gives the meat a great taste.  Thanks for posting this, I will continue to use this everyone time I cook venison backstraps!!!

Wow!  I made these for my husband's (work) family bbq.  I did alter the directions a little.  1-I cut the backstrap into bite size pieces 2-Marinated the venison in apple cider for 24 hours 3-Drained the apple cider and marinated the venison in a spicy bbq sauce for 12 hours (I used Funni Bonz Barbeque Sauce - Spicy) 4-Wrapped pieces with smoked bacon (you'll need to cut each slice of bacon) and stuck a toothpick through to hold it together (also makes for easy handling and eating bite sized pieces)  5-Placed on a foiled cookie sheet and baked in a 375 degree oven until done.  

It was simply out of this world!  I could not make these fast enough...Adults and children alike (even those who swear they can't stand venison) were piling these bites onto their plates.  This is going to be our staple dish that we bring and have at all bbqs.

This is a great recipe!  We used beef backstrap, because I didn't have any venison.  We were also out of apple cider and I was too lazy to run to the store. However, I've been a big fan of Austin's Own BBQ Sauce and buy it by the case at Costco.  This is what we used and it was delicious! 

Couple of side notes; you can cut your bacon in half to help make it go a little further. I also used metal skewers instead of tooth picks. I'm not suggesting a change, because this recipe stands perfectly on it's own.

We made these with elk backstrap, grilled outside, and everyone LOVED them, even those who usually wouldn't be adventurous eaters!  So tender!  I added onion chunks, lemon slices, and a splash of vegetable oil into the marinade, and let them sit all night.

This was an awesome addition to my "Deer and Beer" night for the guys. Also, as a note, I know a lot of folks use White Tail, especially if you're in Texas, but I used Axis. I like Axis soooo much more than White Tail, no gamey taste, more tender, etc... And Axis can be shot year round as they are considered exotics here in Texas. So, just FYI, for those that have a hard time serving venison to their family, for whatever reason, find some Axis and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

This is by far, the best venison recipe I have ever tried. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing! I used backstrap, and made sure to cut the silver tendons lining the meat, i think that was crucial to the meat tenderness. I soaked the hunks in apple cider over night. I marinated them in sweet baby ray's bbq for a few hours. Wrapped them in thick sliced applewood smoked bacon. Grilled over charcoal, asbolutely amazing. Tasted like beef filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Did not taste gamey at all. A MUST keep for a hunter/hunting family.

We added about 1/2 C. white wine to the BBQ sauce that the venison was marinating in and cooked it on med.high for about 10 min.  It made a nice sauce to pour over the cooked venison.

Amazing!  I did change a couple of things, though.  I didnt have venison, but a couple of Elk steaks. They tasted great, not game-y at all.  I also used an applewood smoked bacon that I have loved from my favorite grocery store.  It worked amazingly well with the apple cider.  It was delicious and tender, will certainly make again.

I hate to give a review on something that i altered.  I couldn't find apple cider so i used apple juice.  i marinated the beef in the bbq over night.  i also used deer cubes instead of a large backstrap cut up.  and i didn't use the bacon.  so is it still fair to give this 5 stars?lol.....my family loved it, we will make again.

Prepared this last night. I didn't have 2" thick pieces available, so I cut the 1" steaks into roughly 2x3" pieces and rolled them up before wrapping with the bacon. Grilled 6 minutes on high heat per side. 95% of the meat was rare to medium rare, resulting in melt in your mouth little morsels. EVERYONE agreed, BEST venison they had ever eaten!

My first time cooking venison.  I followed the advice of others and soaked in apple cider (apple juice) overnight. We used wood chips in the barbeque to give an added element of flavor.  Be careful with flare-ups in the barbeque once the bacon fat starts melting.  This was eaten by four people who had never eaten venison before and we were all nervous, but every one of us went back for seconds.  TIP: You don't need nearly as much apple cider or barbeque sauce as the recipe shows... a cup or two of cider and half a bottle of barbeque sauce is plenty.

This meal is amazing! It came out so tender and absolutely delicious! I use Bullseye BBQ sauce with Guiness; it is the best! Be careful not to overcook the venison (we did that the second time and it was really dry!)

We marinated the venison in apple cider for 24 hrs. and then in BBQ sauce for 24 hrs.  Excellent results.  Even picky/non game eaters were wanting more.

Tastes good, but the sweetness was a little strange. A good change of pace for folks who eat lots of venison I like my red meat garlicy, peppery and salty.Added a little liquid smoke, and used Sweet Baby Rays, which is pretty sweet for a BBQ sauce. The apple juice pretty much eliminated the gamey taste.

Amazing!! I made this recipe last week. I marinated the loins for 24 hrs. Then let the brown sugar, hickory smoked bbq sauce soak in the meat all day. I wrapped the in bacon and grilled using apple wood with charcoal on the grill. YUMMY! My boyfriend said it was the best venison he's had in his life.I am making it again tonight using steaks and raspberry chipotle bbq sauce.

A friend of ours gave us 1/2 a backstrap from his deer. We didn't tell our daughters it was venison, just said it was fillet minion wrapped in bacon. Each girl ate two big steaks! They never knew it was venison. If they did, they NEVER would have touched it. The look on their faces when we told them (after dinner) was priceless. We grilled 7 big steaks and only had one little guy left. I didn't have apple cider so I cut up an apple and threw it in the blender with some water and used that. Worked fine. I didn't marinade the meat in BBQ sauce. I just rubbed a little on each side after I put the bacon on. I used thick sliced bacon and it didn't cook well enough so next time I'll use regular bacon. very, very, delicious! I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

WOW, this does taste just like stake. no game taste at all. We will be using this recipe again and again. I did it JUST as it said. Unfortunately some of our meat had a lot of tendons on it and of course that was very chewy, but that had more to do with how we cut the meat off the deer. The meat was AWESOME though!

I used this recipe for my first time ever eating venison, and I can say, I am hooked! I want more....too bad deer season is over :(   Love the apple cider, I think it just takes that gamey edge off that I was afraid of. My boyfriend thought I was crazy for following this recipe, but truly loved the meat once we grilled it!

Finally....  I've been on the search for a good recipe for wild game.  I used this for elk backstrap and it turned out fantastic!!!  I made this on Valentine's and we both enjoyed it!  I marinated it in the vinegar overnight, drained it in the morning, poured the bbq sauce and let it sit all day.  You can not avoid the bacon.  Wild game needs some fat so that it doesn't taste like leather.  These nuggets were delicious!  Thanks!

Amazingly delicious! My husband and I grilled these up on a charcoal grill and were worried that they were too burned, but they still tasted fantastic.  Don't worry if they get nice and black - they'll still taste great.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I'm not a venison fan but this was absolutely amazing!  I finally found a way to cook venison that I can enjoy with my husband who is an avid hunter!  I used apple juice instead of cider and it turned out fine.  Also, I turned this into a kabob with cherry tomatoes, onion, & bell pepper.  It was fantastic and I can't wait to make it again.

I don't really care for venison, but this was pretty good to me.  I sent most of it with my husband to work, and he said I had two proposals, two offers to move me in, and a few "If your wife cooks like this all the time, no wonder you're so big!"

My husband and his family are long time hunters.  They were very skeptical about this recipe, I decided to use whitetail and they couldn't believe how delicious it turned out!  They took this recipe to share with their fellow hunters, and want to try it on other types of wild game.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This sounds wonderful, but venison is not widely available here in Australia.  Would beef be okay - some of my friends would suggest kangaroo, but I dislike the taste.

This was the first time I ever cooked venison and my hunter-husband couldn't believe that it tasted so delicious!  He has been hunting for all of his life and he never tasted venison so good.  He kept asking what the secret was.  I suppose double-marinading is the secret...no other recipe I researched required the double dose.  Kudos to a great recipe!

Made this last night for dinner...it was EXCELLENT!!  Marinated for 2hr/cider-2hrs/bbq mixed with chipolte lime marinade about half/half.  Was short on charcoal so it cooked (on skewers) for about 40 min. (very slow).
The bacon was crisp and the meat was tender and so flavorful!!  Thanks!!!

Delicious!  The meat melts in your mouth.  I marinated these in regular apple juice overnight and then all day in BBQ sauce.  We will make these again and again.  Very easy and so impressive!

This was outstanding. I'm not a venison lover and my boyfriend and I cooked this recipe exactly as it said and I loved it and so did he! We are going to invite others to cook the rest of the meat. Have to share this wonder with others!!!

Excellent venison recipe!  My husband is very picky about his venison and this was great!  It didn't have that gamey taste.

I was looking for something new and different to try with my first deer of the season.  Man am I glad I came looking here.  This is an awesome recipe!  My wife and I love venison, but the kids are always a bit iffy.  They scarfed this up and begged for seconds!

I loved this recipe! I had some backstrap that was particularly gamey and this recipe took that completely away. I also put some jalepino inside the venison before I grilled it. Amazing!!
** Also the only negative review for this recipe says they used apple cider vinegar. It is supposed to be apple cider not apple cider vinegar.

It was amazing! I did use apple cider vinegar by mistake for the first 40 minutes of marinated but I switched it out and dried the meat really well and put it in apple cider for 3 hours then BBQ sauce for 2. Amazing!!!

The very best venison recipe I've ever used.  Coming from someone's family who has eaten venison our whole lives, this is the best.  As many others have also said, this recipe satisfies even those who swear they don't like venison.

As they say, anything wrapped in bacon is great!  Well, albeit that is true, the apple cider soaking really kills any off gamey flavors.  I had year old tenderloins and I was worried about the gaminess of the meat.  I made this recipe and it was a huge hit - even for those that normally didn't like the flavor of venison.
Tips: Put a little liquid smoke and Montreal steak seasoning in along with the BBQ sauce for the 2nd marinade.  I also made them as kabobs, along with bell peppers and onion.  For added heat, I add sliced up jalapenos and/or whole spicy chili  peppers and added them to the kabobs.  Huge hit!

Bacon indeed makes everything better. But the faint hint of residual apple cider makes this out of this world! The only problem I have now is that I only have one backstrap left until next deer season.

I didn't realize I was out of cider when I started so improvised with orange juice, 1T soy sauce, and 1T apple cider vinegar instead of cider and followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out amazing. Even my daughter who wasn't sure about eating the deer I killed ending up trying it and ate 4 of the chunks and finished her brothers'. We grilled chopped sweet and regular potatoes in a foil pouch and it was a great pairing.

My husband decided to start hunting and we now have deer meat that I had no clue what to do with. I finally found a recipe that everyone loves!! I didn't change a thing and I look forward to eating this, which I never thought I would say.

No apple cider (not apple cider vinegar as some have used) so used pineapple juice.  Very tasty and not overly sweet.  In the recipe rotation.

Wonderful flavor!  Be sure to use apple cider or a natural apple juice and not apple cider vinegar.  Cooked to medium-rare or medium and this is a perfect way to cook a backstrap!

Amazing and easy!  We've never cooked venison before and didn't want to screw it up.  I could not believe how tender and delicious this was!  And if I hadn't known it was venison, I'd have thought I was eating beef.  We will definitely have this again!

Just made them a few days ago and they were a huge hit in my house! An excellent change to the same-o fried venison steaks!!! I didn't have apple cider/juice so marinated in zesty italian dressing. Used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce with a touch of brown sugar/Worcestershire sauce added. Too cold to grill and used suggestions in reviews to bake them. I like my bacon a little crispier but I have to say it just melted with the venison! Next time I'm going to try broiling them instead as someone suggested. TY for sharing this excellent recipe! It will be a regular in our house from now on!

This is the best grilled venison recipe I have ever used.  I like to cut the backstrap into 3" medallions...better the fillet minon!!  Be sure to really cover all the venison with the bacon which ultimately acts like an oven.  Great recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner... let me just say it was the best Thanksgiving dinner our entire family has ever had. And we had some pretty cruel skeptics when they found out we were having venison, and not turkey. No one remembered turkey existed after this meal. Amazing, thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was amazing and a very big hit!! We let the meat marinate in the cider from the night before we prepared it - it was like butter! So delicious & tender - we will definitely make this again. A great reason to go hunting again next year!

***** I followed the recipe except I sliced  the back strap in 1 1/2 inch steaks, wrapped them in bacon and grilled for 5 min on each side (med rare)  better than filet in no game taste.

This was absolutely the best venison I have made  and have ever eaten.  I have cooked a lot of venison in my day, and was getting bored of doing the same old recipes.  I came across this one and WOW, my family loved it and said it was even better than steak.  It was so easy to do, especially if you have extra time to marinate, the only thing I did different was marinate in the apple cider for over six hours.  This is an excellent recipe and will be a definitive in my menu planning.

I only had 1lb of venison so I adjusted accordingly. Also, I used KC Masterpiece for the bbq sauce. Really good bacon flavor on the outside with a sour flavor on the inside. Next time, I would like to use meat tenderizer because it was still difficult for me to chew because I have TMJ. Husband said it was the best venison he has ever had!

I've been eating vension since I could eat solid food and this is, hands down, one of the most delicious recipes for venison I've ever tried. My fiance (who isn't the biggest fan of venison) loved it and will definitely cook again! Only thing I'd change is will save up for some better quality bacon. A+++

If I could give this more stars, I would. This was fantastic. The meat had a sweet taste. I used Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce recipe for the sauce. Wonderful. I used 1/2 slice of bacon per because I find it easier to test the meat when it's cooking. Perfection!

I used this recipe with goat backstrap. Previously, all five members of my family did not 'like' goat meat - however, they loved it cooked like this!

this turned out perfect, no gamey taste or anything.  My uncle absolutely hates venison so we told him it was steak cubes, he loved it and ate a whole bunch, then we told him it was deer and he couldn't believe it. He said it's the first time in 53 years that he's had deer that didn't make him want to gag. good recipe and very easy. i marinated the deer in the apple cider over night, and then in the BBQ sauce for about 4 hours. i used 3 bottles, kraft original, hickory and hot because i mad a whole bunch, i just mixed all 3 sauces together. ENJOY Thanks!

I have to give this 5 stars because I was not a fan of Venison, until this recipe. My husband filled our freezer with it this year and this recipe is awesome. I used Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ sauce. Will make this over and over again. Reheats into little tasty morsels for appetizers. I nuked them and cut them in 1/2 for a quick treat.

I have cooked venison this way for years now. Everyone I have cooked this for has loved it.  suggestion: For those of you who like spicy foods. Try a small sliver of jalepeno pepper on the cubes before wrapping with bacon. This adds some great flavor to it. Always use very fatty bacon also. I don't marinate mine at all and it is great. hope you enjoy.

we have been doing this for years, just a little different twist is added. Before we wrap the bacon, we add a slice of jalapeno pepper, then wrap with bacon.And instead of bbq sauce we marinate and cook in light italian dressing.Both ways are delicous and coming from a family who loves to hunt,I like to try all kinds of ways to cook venison!

This is THE BEST venison recipe I've tried.  It is melt in your mouth tender.  The apple cider added a sweetness to the barbeque sauce.  My entire family loved it and my husband took the leftovers to work to share with his coworkers.

Excellent concept, though I can't say I followed it exactly. I didn't have apple juice, so I used pomegranate juice. And we wanted our venison a bit more rare, so we only cooked it about 10 minutes. Great combination of flavors and textures.

I love venison anytime, and I have to say everyone that has tried this agrees that this is the best way to have backstrap that they have ever had.  I have been spreading the word.

Best deer recipe I have ever tried.  We used a whole deer tenderloin and cut in into the size of filet mingon (? spelling)and wrapped in bacon.  However, I did not use the BBQ sauce for the 2nd marinade.  I used either Lawry's Herb & Lemon or Herb & Garlic for the 2nd marinade.

My boyfriend loved this and has requested it many times!
We did not have any backstrap tenderloin left so I used the backstrap roast instead and it was delicious.  
I marinaded the meat in the cider for 8 hours and then the BBQ for about 3.  I chose to skewer the meat as well to make it easier for turning on the grill.

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't follow the instructions exactly.  I marinated the venison in apple cider overnight, then the next morning marinated in Stubby’s original BBQ sauce all day. I also cut the back strap in half and wrapped them together like a roast in the bacon.  Cooked the venison at 325 until it reached an internal temperature of 132 degrees.  My husband and I were amazed at how we could actually cut the meat with a fork it was so tender.

These were pretty good.  I marinated in apple juice (no cider to be found), so maybe that is where it went wrong for me.  Still good, but not out of this world.

This is out of this world!! A great new way to cook venison. I do not know how the cider takes the wild taste out of the meat, but I am suprised. I have tried everything. My so who thinks of Bambi, when I cook venison, loved it. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I marinated in apple cider 2 hours then Lowry's garlic and herb with lemon juice for a couple of hours.  I liked it, and my husband and father-in-law LOVED it.  They raved about it all night.  Can't wait to get more backstrap to make it again.

I followed this as written. The apple cider flavor was inside the venison which was a great touch. I had a hard time with the bacon staying on the meat, but that could have been my fault. It's an awesome recipe that I will keep on hand. I went for 2 hours on each marinade process.

My husband is a hunter-I am not a fan of wild game. Being the awesome wife I am though, every now and then I’ll try to find a recipe for the venison he brings home because that makes him happy.  I usually grill a piece of chicken for me too, just in case.  Well, he took some backstrap  out of the freezer one day and asked me to find a recipe to grill it that sounded good to me.  HOLY MOSES!!! I thought this recipe sounded like it had promise so I tried it. I didn’t have time to marinate twice so I just mixed the cider and bbq sauce together and then added more sauce to the meat before wrapping in bacon.  It was delicious-I ate more venison that night than all the other nights if my life combined-and I’m 62 so that’s saying a lot!  Making it again tonight-going to take the time to marinate twice-looking forward to dinner

My family loved this.  I would recommend shooting for medium rare.  Med to well done is a little chewy.

This was great! I love venison but if you are trying to prove to your friends and family that venison is not gamey, make this for them! They will become instant fans!

The meat turned out perfect!  Had to use apple juice as that's all I could find.  Hubs was too afraid to wrap in bacon- he thought by the time the bacon would be done, the venison would be overdone so he alternated venison/bacon pieces on skewers.  Of course the bacon wasn't done so I put the  slices in the oven.  They had a little flavor from sitting in the BBQ sauce on the skewer just before going on the grill.  This made a big difference in overall taste- the venison with the cooked bacon was outstanding!  The venison alone was also outstanding but I preferred it with the bacon.  Everyone else didn't seem to think the bacon was needed.  Next time I will talk hubs into trying to wrap with bacon- thinking the bacon on the outside will keep the venison from cooking so fast.

Very good but next time I'll not use the thick cut bacon. I feel I overcooked the venison trying to get the bacon crispy.

Delicious, the whole family loved it!  I marinated in the cider overnight and the bbq sauce for 6 hours.  I didn't buy enough bacon, so I wrapped each one in half a slice.

Cut backstrap in larger medallion style pieces. Marinaded in apple cider overnight in gallon bag. Marinaded in BBQ sauce all day. Just used regular bacon cut in half. Soaked and used skewers instead of toothpicks. Grilled on med-low for 8-10 min, just until bacon was cooked, turning several times. Very good!

I followed the recipe and it was a great hit! My family said it was the best thing they have ever had grilled. I will be making this again for my wife's birthday at her request. Grilled just long enough at high heat to almost cook the bacon,wrapped around the tenderloin, too long. However, the tenderloin was perfect and still moist.  Enjoy.

I had never cooked venison before and never really liked it. I followed this recipe to the t and it was very tender and very very good. Some folks gave it a bad review but I saw that they mentioned apple cider VINEGAR when it actually calls for Apple Cider.

Delicious!! Hubby is a big dear hunter so always trying to come up with venison recipes. This may be the best yet. Ended up forgetting some on the cooling, closed charcoal grill for over an hour and even those were amazing. Whole family enjoyed. Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

Awesome recipe. I even got my wife to eat it. She liked it too. She usually doesn't like venison unless ground in a meal. I shared this with several hunting buddies who enjoy this recipe also.

Heavenly is right!  Made with venison, but Elk would be fabulous too. The bacon adds the fat flavor that the lean meat doesn't have. Used regular thickness bacon. Put two on a long skewer. Would serve to the queen of England.

Since Apple Cider is out of season, we used Angry Orchard hard cider, the bbq sauce and bacon were over powered by the taste of apple. The meat was very tender. Our meat was cut into slivers, so we had to use skewers which kept the bacon from crisping up. This recipe would be better with pork.

AMAZING! Any other word would he disrespectful. This recipe worked great. I had it soak for four (4) hours, and sat in BBQ Sauce for three (3) hours. One thing I will do next time is only use 1/2 a piece of bacon instead of a full piece.

Oh my, that was good. Can't stop eating, might explode. I've cooked a lot of venison and this recipe is by far my favorite. I marinated longer but that was due to me falling asleep. Oops. But it worked in my favor. This is amazing and simple and worth every second.

I read the recipe late in the day so I didn't have a chance to marinate it as long as I should have. The flavor was fabulous, would have been better had I done it the way it was suppose to be. I did sprinkle seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder to each filet. My kids loved it, were surprised to find out it was venison. I grew up on a game farm, am accustomed to eating wild game, none of us hunt so I am lucky enough to get some from my nephew that hunts.  This will be made again!

"FANTASTIC" & "AWESOME" are how my venison-hating husband described this recipe.  He absolutely, without exception, despises all venison & any type of game...until now.  He LOVED this dish & ate so much his stomach hurt...enough said.

Let me start by saying that I used to hate deer meat. The operative word being "used" to We used the ham part of the meat and I learned a few key things. There is a white connective tissue that runs through the meat of the deer. Take the extra twenty minutes to take all of this out. Second thing I learned, make sure you hang the deer for a whole week as long as the temperatures are at normal refrigerator settings. If you do this, all your meat will be as tender as a filet. Now back to the recipe, AMAZING! My family doesn't really like wild game meats, but my son shot a deer, and as most of you know, you need to eat what you kill in the forest. That being said, we tried the recipe, sat down, prepared to hold our noses while we ate, and we were so surprised that we called everyone we knew to share the recipe. Remember to not overcook the meat.

I am 18 and I made this recipe for my family. My family has never liked deer and this is the first time I have ever cooked it. This recipe was amazing and my whole family loved it and now I have to go kill another deer soon so I can cook it again!

This was delicious!  We did not soak the meat in the BBQ sauce as it called for. We just brushed some bbq sauce over the meat as it cooked, and some of the meat we did not use BBQ sauce on at all.  My daughter and husband ate it without BBQ sauce, which my daughter loved (who is 12, it was actually her deer that she shot), my husband dipped his in A-1 sauce and said that he liked that better!

This was amazing! Made it for football Sunday and all the guys enjoyed it -- Even asked if they could take some home with them. I made some as the recipe stated (with apple cider and smokey barbecue sauce) and half with a bottled bourbon marinade, and both were stellar. This seems like a recipe you can't go wrong on, except for everyone using apple cider vinegar instead of just plain ol apple cider :)

This was ridiculously delicious. I used apple juice instead of apple cider.(had juice on hand) there was no hint of game flavor. My young daughters even loves it.

My husbands uncle gave us some fresh venison and a marinade recipe.  I didn't have nearly all the ingredients so I came to this site looking for something simple and delicious.  I came across this simple recipe which calls for only 4 ingredients, all of which I already had, and the reviews (of those who did NOT use VINEGAR) are positive. I have the meat marinating now and plan to share it with over 20 people at dinner tonight.  I hope it is as delicious as everyone says, and I will post a review once I get everyone's feedback!

We tried this for dinner tonight, used two smaller inside tenderloins, so kept them whole instead of cutting into chunks.  I did not have any cider (wrong season) or apple juice, so used what I had which was some applesauce.  I used foil at first and did 10 min each side, then removed the foil from the grille for the last 5 min for each side.  This was good, it was tender, but we will try it again when we can get some cider. I'm sure it will be even better with the correct ingredients.

This was delicious!  Just remember it calls for apple cider, NOT apple cider vinegar.  I have never liked venison until I tried this recipe - it removes all gamey taste.  When the bacon was cooked through, the steak was perfectly cooked to our liking (medium well).  I've also tried this method with chicken and it was fabulous!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We always have a freezer full of vension and we love this recipe. If you do not like the gamey taste of venison this marinade helps.  Just remember to use Apple Cider NOT Apple Cider VINEGAR.  I read many reviews and noticed a few people that gave this 1 star used apple cider vinegar.  I also like adding a couple cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade. Yummy!

Just tried this recipe last night. It was my by first time cooking deer meat - and was actually the first deer I killed on my own!. My mom, dad and boyfriend went CRAZY over it. It was tender, full of flavor and melted in your mouth. I was short on time so I only left it in the apple cider for 1 hour and it still turned out great. There was hardly any left! I'd suggest this to anyone and will definitely make it again. :)

100% you gotta try! Check out the photo from 12/2012.. That's my version.  You need to pick a bold BBQ or something not so sweet.. The BBQ will really jump out at you so don't make a mistake using a cheap $2 BBQ from Walmart go all out and get or make the perfect BBQ for these bad boys!

This was the first time I really enjoyed Venison. I followed the recipe until time to cook, we put it in our smoker instead of grilling. We used mesquite, it turned out fantastic! That marinade made a huge difference!!

OMG! That was soo good. My husband just got a deer last week. I used the backstrap cut in 1 inch medallions and I put some onion under the bacon as another reviewer suggested.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I marinated it longer.  Fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing.

I have recently begun to enjoy cooking and finding recipes. Let me first say I am not a big game eater, but this recipe is AMAZING. My husband loves this recipe so much that we are looking for someone to buy deer off of so that we can cook it for his co-workers. They have eaten venison many times but neveer this way. Thanks so much for this FABULOUS recipe. I LOVE VENISON!

All we could taste was the cider vinegar. Had to smother the meat in extra BBQ sauce just to be able to eat it.

The bacon was extremely necessary because the venison loin is very dry, being it's so lean.  My husband was very apprehensive when I told him how I made it, but he loved it!

I had  never cooked venison before and my husband and son are hunters.. but before my time.  They got a deer this year so learning to cook it was a must!  This recipe made me look like an expert!  I handed the plate to my husband to be grilled and he said "made an aweful lot didn't you?"  They ate the entire plate.  The next day my husband told a friend it was the best venison he had ever tasted.  MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!  FABULOUS!

I used the sirloin roast and cut it up into small chunks and marinated in apple cider like the recipe called for. I marinated half in Jack Daniels' Original BBQ sauce and the other I used Allegro Hickory Smoke Marinade. The meat marinated for 24 hours.  I only wrapped the wet liquid smoke chunks in bacon because the bbq is thick that it makes it's own coating - just my preference.  The meat w/ the BBQ sauce was good, but I really liked the one I marinated with the Allegro sauce...the smokey flavor was awesome. As for the gamey taste, it was very very subtle, you can't taste it at first, it comes towards the end.  All in all, this is a great recipe and one I will keep forever. Thank you very much!!!

This is the best venison recipe I have ever had. So tender, and it does not taste like venison at all.
We marinated the meat in the cider for over 4 hours and in the barbeque sauce for only 1.5 hours. 
Will definetly make again.

Whoa! there good reason this is at the top of the list. Elegant and Simple (try not to get 'creative') and fabulously delicious. As a new hunter I have very little experience cooking game, but I have found that a deer has plenty of flavor on its own and spices just over load the palate. Also, being naturally low fat and dense, don't over cook-its easy to do. We did 2.5 inch medallions exactly as the recipe instructed (time and ingredients). 17 minutes on our grill-I never left it-and it was perfectly medium rare. One side yielded 8 medallions and we have 4 left over for later this weekend. For those that didn't like it as well; perhaps the 'feed' your deer was on was different, perhaps it was processed too slowly (Mine came off the deer the same night I killed it, went into the bottom of the fridge that night and was keeped at 34 degress till five days later. Never frozen.)
After the meal my wife, who had had deer in the past and was not optimistic, pushed away from the table and I said,"What do you think?" A woman of few words she said, "Get more deer"!

No apple cider or juice on hand, so I chopped up a couple of apples in my food processor, stirred them around with the peices of meat, then added a little water to cover.  The meat came from a smaller deer, so I had smaller peices.  Because of this, I skewered the meat and wove the bacon between the peices.  It turned out great.  My skeptical husband said he hoped I hadn't messed up the meat, but was won over at the dinner table!  He even took some over to our neighbor who is an avid hunter as soon as dinner was over.  Thumbs up from him too!  No gamey taste at all.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing different was I marinated in the cider 24 hours (wasn't able to coke it when planned) and it came out beautifully!  My husband did however have a heck of a time with the bacon on the grill!  Other then that, supurb!

Awesome recipe - I did use McCormicks Steak seasoning on this before grilling and I cooked it over and open fire with tamarack.  Best venison recipe ever.  Way to go.

AWESOME!  My husband deemed this his new favorite.  We didn't have time to marinate as long as the recipe calls for - the meat was in the cider and BBQ sauce about 30 minutes each.  I'm sure it will be even better with the longer marinade time. I also seasoned the meat with Tony's and garlic powder before putting into the cider.  Just habit - I have a hard time not seasoning my meat!  SO GOOD YOU MUST TRY THIS ONE!

I'm not a big venison fan but this was great! I will definitely make this again. I used wooden skewers and was able to put 3 pieces on each. Thanks for sharing this.

This is some seriously good stuff.  You can even skip some of the steps if you have a young animal and just wrap it with bacon and grill.
