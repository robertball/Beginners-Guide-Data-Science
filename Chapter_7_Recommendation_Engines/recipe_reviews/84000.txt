1st let me say, I am 45 and make a roast every week.  I wanted something other than the normal pot roast, brown gravy and such.  So I looked and found this recipe. I made it per the recipe without changing a thing.
  All I can say is this is the most moist, tasty roast we have ever had.  Husband was a bit worried when I told him pineapple and tomato, but after we started eating it for dinner he changed his mind. Over and over he told me to make sure I dont' loose this recipe.  It was delicious! 
  I must tell you also, that 1/2 way through the cooking process we had an emergency and had to leave for 3.5 hours.  I was then worried, but it was so tender and juicy it didn't hurt it at all.  I browned the roast and baked it in my cast iron(Le Cruset) pan and it worked beautifully.  Make this one without reservation!  A+A+A+  
Because I can't give the recipe more than 5 stars I give it several A+'s.

Wow!  Who'd of thunk it?  Pineapple?  I tried this recipe because anything with the word sicilian in it gets my attention.  I was not disappointed.  This was fabulous!  I cheated and used a can of crushed pineapple,(cause if my family saw the pineapple, they wouldn't even try it) and a can of crushed tomatoes and served it with a side of egg noodles.  Wonderfully delicious!  Thanks.

As an American living in Sicily, I HAD to try this recipe.  After reading many of the reviews here's how I cooked this recipe.  I browned the roast according the recipe and then placed it into a crock pot.  I also took the sliced onion and sauteed them in the pan I browned the roast.  As they softened, they soaked up the juices and brown bits in the pan.  I then scraped it all into the crock pot.  Adding the tomatoes and pineapple I didn't think there was enough liquid.  I then added 1 cup of a dry white wine.  Put the crock pot on low and left it for 8 hours.  I came back and the pork was just falling apart tender.  Instead of thickening the juices, I took my immersion blender  to the crock pot and whizzed up the tomatoes, pineapple and onion in the juices.  It made a  nice thick tasty sauce.  The roast was quite moist.  I served it with rice.  The sauce was great over the pork and rice.

I made it per the instructions, with the exception of using a boneless pork tenderloin instead, since they were 50% on sale!

I cooked it for a party of 11 and it was a great hit! Everybody loved it. A+ recommended!

Really delicious!  I did alter slightly by using a pork tenderloin.  After browning, I mixed all of the other ingredients together (including garlic instead of placing in roast) and poured over the top prior to putting it in the over.  I cooked it a bit longer to make sure it was tender and boy was it ever.  I served it w/rice pilaf & green beans and received rave reviews from my husband and kids!!

I have never been able to make a really tender pork roast until now.  This recipe made my pork roast so tender and tasty, I ate until I was ready to burst!  Excellent recipe.

I've made this twice now. The first time I used a pork shoulder roast and followed the recipe pretty faithfully. This time I used a pork loin and crushed pineapple. I also opted to cook it in my slow cooker and used my temperature probe to determine when it was done. This makes a very moist and tender dish. The tomato/pineapple sauce makes great gravy, too.

Delicious!  I used a 7lb bone in butt-roast (couldn't find a shoulder) and cooked it for close to 5 hours because of the size, and just doubled everything.  I loved the combination of pineapples and tomatoes, and the meat was so tender, it slid off the bone when I pulled it out of the oven.  We've been eating leftovers for a week now, and everyone's still raving about how delicious this is.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did differently was used a pork tenderloin instead of a roast. My family loved it and the whole house smelled wonderful.  Thanks!

I'm on my third batch, and just love it and so does my family. I add carrots to the pot and trim down the pineapple a bit as the carrots are sweet. I also add lots of cracked pepper, and serve it with quartered boiled potatoes to soak up the juices. Be sure to brown the roast first if you want a super tender pork roast! I've also done this in the crock pot, starting out on high for an hour, then reducing to low for 5-6 until done.

Yummy! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because it seemed a little dry compared to some others I've made. Maybe because you don't add much "wet"? The only change I made was that I used poultry seasoning in place of the fresh rosemary and sage, because that's what I had on hand. But it tasted and smelled great!

Decent.  We had a 5.5lb roast and I believe undercooked it part of it, despite the meat thermometer saying otherwise and cooking it for >2.5 hours.  The flavor works.  If you have time, take the suggestions of others and add corn starch to the sauce to thicken it & make gravy.  We omitted the sage.  I would also be sure to use the grill grate on your roasting pan, as a lot of grease is rendered from cooking.  The pineapples are tasty.  I would add potatoes on the bottom to suck up the flavor.

The roast was very moist and smelled wonderful while cooking.  My husband & I both agreed that the taste of Rosemary overpowered the other flavors.  I followed the recipe exactly and if we decide to make this again, we will definitely alter the spice measurements and add some other things as well.

This makes a great economical dinner, pork shoulder is a very inexpensive cut of meat. I got mine @ 1.49/lb which in Canada is a great price for meat. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hour longer than called for, it was delicious and so tender the meat fell off the bone. My family enjoyed it so I'll definitely be making it again, it was a snap to prepare. Just put it in the oven and forget about it. Great for busy days.

This made a nice change from the usual pork roasts. I used 1/2 of the recipe for about 2lbs of tenderloin following the directions as originally written. While not a favourite with me, it was easy and the meat was tender. Thanks for posting.

Fantastic! I had to make a few minor changes. I didn;t have any sage so I left it out. I also used a 2 lb bonless loin and cut the cooking time in half. It was SO juicy and flavorful! I will be keeping this recipe for sure!

This pork was so tender it was almost hard to cut a nice slice! I, too, added a lot of cornstarch to make the gravy thick. I prefer savory dishes to sweet, and the pineapple made this dish just sweet enough. Thanks for the recipe!

I was leary but this was really good! I did lighten up slightly on the rosemary and used fresh sage (because that is what I had). I also used 5 plum tomatoes skinned and seeded because I didn't have the canned.  I forgot to add the onion until 1 hour into the cooking but it still all melted into the sauce.  For no added liquid, this surely made a lot of juice. I also made mine in a cast iron dutch oven and thickened the sauce with a mixture of corn starch and white wine (2T each).  I will most definately make this again.

It was easy and fairly tasty! I just wish I had cut my roast in half . I ended up having to cook it for far too long at 300.

I used a regular white onion and diced tomatoes.  We enjoyed the mix of the sweet pineapple with the onion and tomatoes.

Makes a juicy and tender roast that easily shreds. I served it over rice for a more filling meal.  While it was good, I found it lacking in flavor.  Next time I won't drain the juice from the pineapple and will add more of the same seasonings to the slow cooker to help up the flavor.  Overall, its worth keeping in the rotation.

We didn't care for the combination of the pineapple and tomatoes at all..  I won't be making it again.

Great tasting, easy to make.  Took the left over meat off the bone the next day, chunked it up and made a soup.  Just as tasty!!

This recipe wasn't what I expected. Maybe it's just me but I didn't particularly think the tomatoes and the pineapples did anything special. The meat on the other hand was very tender and even better the second day.

This was very disappointing.  It tasted like a meal out of a can.  I definitely won't make it again.

I really loved this recipe. My husband thought that it needed a bit more flavor. It was moist and tender. I really recommend this one!!
