I USED THIS AS A BASE RECIPE AND IT IS VERY GOOD WITH CHICKEN STOCK USED INSTEAD OF PLAIN WATER.  I ALSO ADDED A LITTLE GARLIC AND I COOKED THE RICE SEPARATELY AND POURED THE SOUP ON TOP.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE IDEA!

Used less water and added diced green pepper and celery to make this more of a stew.  Tasty and filling, if not "wow"-ing.

2 tablespoons red pepper flakes is clearly WRONG.

1 teaspoon was a bit much.

Otherwise recipe was unremarkable and not worth repeating

it was okay but I think I did something wrong because the cook time took longer than it said
