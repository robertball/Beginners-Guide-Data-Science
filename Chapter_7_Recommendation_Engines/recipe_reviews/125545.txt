I didn't have a can of tomatoes so I added some salsa. I omitted the mac and added a bell pepper, then served over rice with a dollop of sour cream. Easy recipe, nice flavor. We loved it!

This was pretty good, my fiance gave it 10 stars. I made it just as the directions stated, but after tasting it I added some red peper flakes and hot sauce to mine as I like things spicey. But over all good, lot's of flavor for such few calories.

I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, onion powder and flakes instead of chopped onion, and the only corn I had on hand was sweet. I added some chilli powder, cumin, garlic salt, garlic powder, pepper, red pepper flakes, and a few jalapeno slices from the jar to try to even out the sweetness. I put them on wheat tortillas, heated in the oven. Followed another reviewer's tip and mixed the beans in with the rest of the mix. It tasted good and my husband and I were satisfied. I will make again. Lots of leftovers because I made portions for 4 and there are just 2 of us.

Love it! Quick, Easy, and Low-Cal? And it taste great too!!!! I added a little cayenne pepper to mine just to give it an extra kick. IT was great! If you're watching your weight like me, you can use low fat sour cream and less tortilla chips, or just nix the chips altogether. Still wonderful...

I will make this again with a few additions - salt, red pepper flakes, and topped with sliced avocado.

Not bad.  I thought I goofed up because I bought "Italian" stewed tomatoes, but that didn't matter much.  The flavor is good and it was better when I added shredded cheese.  This is a recipe you could build off of or even take ingredients and substitute.

Easy to make and great taste.  I didn't have two gravy packets so I just used one and I added a little texas gunpowder to kick it up a notch.  Hubby liked it and I would make again:)

I've never cooked with brown gravy mix
before.  It turned out a little strange. I wouldn't make it again.

I used ground beef instead of turkey and added salsa to the mixture, for flavor.  My husband was leary about macaroni in a Mexican dish but he ate it & liked it a lot.  Leftovers are for lunch.

Everyone thought this tasted weird.  Not sure exactly what is was but weird sums it up nicely.  Won't be making this again.

I'm glad I found this one. My family loves it too:) I just add pico de gallo instead of putting the separate onions and tomatoes. I add more of my own seasoning and I use sour cream and onion chips instead of tortilla chips. I skip the lettuce.  It's good:)

This recipe is amazing! My husband has insisted that I make this at least once a week from now on, and I agree with him. It was easy to make and delicious. However, I didn't use tortilla chips..I will try that next time. By itself though it was a great one dish dinner!

This turned out great. I added some cumin, lime juice to taste. I also seasoned my turkey with montreal stake seasoning (I use it for most of my meats) while it was cooking. I also added some cheese to the topping.

I came across this recipe because I had four packets of turkey gravy left-over from Thanksgiving. When I did an ingredient search this recipe came up. The noodles added to this seem strange. Kind of makes it like a Hamburger Helper meal. I went meatless and used pinto beans instead. This would be better to serve with chips if it didn't have the noodles in it. And definitely needs some cheese.

I was a little bit wary of this recipe.  But it was great and even better the next day.  I just added more corn than what it called for and used shredded cheese on top with the sour cream.
