I added a tbl of char sui sauce and a tsp of sesame oil. Over all without these additions, it was still very tasty.

We will definitely make this again! We used 2 large chicken breasts and added a can of water chestnuts in with the chicken at the end. After a taste at that point, it felt like it was light on seasoning, so we essentially doubled the seasoning (added same amounts more of soy sauce, chicken bouillon, sugar;  EXCEPT no extra salt) AND added 1 tsp of garlic powder. (Will def try some fresh garlic next time instead of powdered; and considering using snow peas in place of green pepper or even bok choy if we can't get it.) Served with white rice and optional toppings of slivered almonds and crunchy chow mein noodles. A keeper for us!
