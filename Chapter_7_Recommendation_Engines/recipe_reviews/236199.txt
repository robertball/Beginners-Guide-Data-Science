What is not to love?  Bacon, Avocado, Turkey, cheese on a Croissant!  I skipped the mustard - I spread a thin layer of mayo on the split croissant, cheese on both sides and broiled for a minute then added the turkey for another minute.  Filled with the lettuce, tomato and avocado (no oregano, just salt and a squeeze of lime or lemon) What a decadent treat!

Made as per recipe, although used smoked ham instead of the bacon.  Loved the avocado spread.  My husband and I both thought the spicey mustard a little over powering as it seemed to smothered the other flavors.  Eating this was a trial run, as I am making it for a women's luncheon.  I will serve the mustard on the side.  Definitely will make again.

I made this sandwich exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious!  I made a second sandwich with honey mustard in lieu of the spicy brown mustard and it was equally as delicious!  Thanks for sharing this great sandwich receipe, Messy Lissa!

Oh my was this good!!!  We opted to replace the deli turkey with thin sliced chicken breast we sprinkled with a bit of Goya- Adobo seasoning (consists of salt, granulated garlic, oregano & turmeric) and baked in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.   Everything else we followed.  My very picky family loved it!  Not a turkey fan, so maybe as a quicker option next time we will try Boar's Head EverRoast Deli Chicken Breast.
