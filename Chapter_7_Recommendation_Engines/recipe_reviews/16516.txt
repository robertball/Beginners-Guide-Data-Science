The whole family LOVED this unique flavor with a mild kick! My son hates peas but ate all of them when they were surrounded with this yummy rice! As a non cook it was SUPER EASY!

This was very tasty. Smells wonderful when cooking too! The only thing I did different was omit the sugar and add minced garlic. Thanks for sharing.

Didn't have a serrano but had a jalapeno in the fridge so I used that. The spices all complement each other very well but don't dominate the flavor. Nice side dish.

This needed a lot of doctoring to taste good. The flavor were so mild and I was surprised because the ingredients listed have such strong flavors! 3 stars from me on this one

Quite tasty. I think it would have done well with some garlic I'll try that next time. I would use a lot more than 2 cloves if you want to taste them--maybe 5 or 6 per cup of rice. It was pretty spicy not too much for my liking but it may not complement your other dishes. You might want to start with 1/2 of a serrano. It's tough to judge this because peppers vary quite a bit from crop to crop.

Very good! I doubled the recipe for a family dinner but the recipe as is makes plenty for a family of 4-6 if served as a side dish.

Wakes up the taste buds as this combination of spices is one I rarely use. Even my 4-year-old liked it! Great side or every-day dish.

Peas Rice Haiku: "Delicate flavor. Didn't expect so subtle with all those spices." I thought this was a lovely and light side dish that would complement just about any entree (we had it w/ meatloaf green beans and sweet potatoes.) I was very surprised at how subtle the flavor was despite the aroma being so enticingly strong. My daughter didn't like it one bit but both my husband and I did although when I make it again I would increase the peas as they were little green dots of color and didn't really provide much greeny goodness.

I would make this as a meal in itself because of the cinnamon. I would also guess that kids would like the sweetness.

I had chille peppers so I used that instead. I thought the flavor was good. Next time I'll add raisins too. It has a good flavor.

Good - I used ground cinnamon - not a good idea; stick to the stick. Cloves are nice.

This rice does have a very mild flavor but thats exactly what I was looking for. I did cheat a bit I used a packet of premade Basmati rice. I sauteed everything in the butter till it was tender then added the rice with about a 1/4c of water and let it steam. I used frozen peas as others have and they worked just fine. This is one I will keep and make when I need a nice mild rice.
