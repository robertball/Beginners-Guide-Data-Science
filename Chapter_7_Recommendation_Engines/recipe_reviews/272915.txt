I’m the author of this recipe and I do use ingredients which may not be in a beginner cooks spice cabinet. I love using tomato powder as it has a robust taste, and while tomato paste may be used, I prefer tomato powder as I don’t have to worry about leftover tomato paste. Honey powder is dehydrated honey, and while honey may be used I prefer honey powder as it is not sticky. Both may be found at the Savory spice shop, or your local grocer may carry them
