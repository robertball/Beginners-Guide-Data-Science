This is a traditional Red Velvet Cake icing, sometimes called Waldorf-Astoria Frosting. Other versions use butter in place of Crisco, or have slightly more flour. I prefer the butter variety, but this version is stable at room temperature due to the Crisco, and the flavor trade-off is worth it when space in the fridge is at a premium. This was my first time refrigerating the milk/flour mixture and I can honestly say I won't do that again -- getting it that cold makes it hard to beat in without leaving bits behind, so room temperature works best for me. When doubling this recipe, do not double the liquid. I found that 1 1/2-1 3/4 cups milk was sufficient for a doubled recipe, and use whole milk if you can, so the fats bind to the flour rapidly, and you can do less stirring. Not doubling the milk when doubling the recipe is NOT a criticism of the recipe, just a rule of thumb for doubling frosting recipes in general. Thank you Carri G. for sharing your g-grandmother's recipe with us! P.S. Shortening has no flavor, so if yours has a flavor, throw it away and buy a new one, yours is going bad. Off-brands especially do this faster than regular Crisco. If your frosting has a weird TEXTURE that's different -- you needed to beat the sugar longer.

I fully expected to not like this recipe. It just seemed odd to me but I kept hearing great things about it so I decided to give it a shot. It is fantastic! Incredibly light smooth and delicious. Thanks for opening my eyes!

I've never written a review here before, but this recipe stunned me into amazement so I had to share.  I ran out of icing sugar and needed a last minute recipe to make some cupcake frosting before running off to a pot-luck.  Looking at this recipe I was skeptical that it would work, but had little other choice.  Even as I was mixing it together, I envisioned a granular crunchy icing.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This was so silky, smooth and delicious!  It's better than my go-to icing recipe even.  I may never buy icing sugar again.  I did make a couple modifications: I used half a cup of butter and half a cup of vegetable shortening, and I didn't have any milk so I used half a cup of whipping cream and half a cup of water.  Sooooo delicious!!!!

I have to agree with another viewer that this frosting tastes too strongly of shortening. It actually has left an aftertaste in my mouth so I will have to try something else for my red velvet cupcakes. I suggest maybe using butter instead in this recipe. It is easy to make but not to my liking.

I used rice milk cooked 1/4 cup sugar with the milk and flour and added 1/4 t salt and 3 T cocoa for an amazing chocolate icing.

The frosting was easy to make and had a good texture. However the taste was disappointing. It had a strong after taste of vegetable shortening.

This recipe is similar to the filling in good old fashioned twinkies and the original filling type for Whoopie Pies(or Gobs) before the invention of Marshmallow Fluff. To tweak this recipe for flavor: add 1 cup of real butter to the existing ingredients the shortening must be the Crisco brand or it really doesn't have quite the same flavor/texture (using butter flavored crisco instead of butter AND Crisco doesn't seem to work). Change the white sugar to powdered sugar and double it to 2 cups it won't be overly sweet. The powdered sugar also has cornstarch in it that will help to thicken the mixture. The flour can be cut back to 2 Tbsp because of the powdered sugar effects. Double the vanilla to 2 tsp use clear vanilla if you would like a really white frosting. A faster way than to "cook"(Ermine or boiled milk frosting method): have all ingredients at room temperature. Using a stand mixer (helpful as the mixing process can be long)keep mixing until frosting comes together. (a hand mixer can be used just have to stand there mixing and mixing for quite some time). The mixture starts off as a runny globby mess and the longer it is mixed it magically comes together into a fluffy white frosting. Depending on the size of the cake all of the recipe ingredients could be cut in half. One reviewer made an excellent observation this frosting IS stable at room temperature.

Finally!! This is the only (and best) way to frost a Red Velvet Cake. I grew up in the South and this is the way we like our RV Cake.

I have been making this since the late 50's. I use butter (Margarine works also) instead of Crisco. Add 1/4 tsp. Rum flavoring and 1/2 tsp. Vanilla. The other trick is to add sugar a TLBS at a time mixing well after each addition. This de-solves the granules so you have a smooth texture. Give it a try this will make such a difference to the end results.

I thought I would give this a go as I had never made this type of frosting with shortening. It tasted too much of shortening for me. I added about 1.5 tbl of vanilla to try mask the flavour. I wouldn't make it again.

I have made this icing 2 times now the first time I made it with half butter and half softening. We really liked it but I was still concerned about eating so much softening. The second time I used all butter and added cocoa powder. WOW It was the best icing ever!!! This is now my go to icing. No more icing powder for me.

My mom and I have made this frosting for years. It is our frosting of choice for all cakes. It is especially good on the Hot Milk Sponge Cake. We add a teaspoon of Butternut flavoring as it enhances the taste. Also when creaming the shortening and sugar make sure the mixture is very smooth and not grainy! The longer you beat the frosting after you add the "paste" the fluffier the frosting. To Luv2cook: try using butter in place of the shortening.

I made exactly as directed (with Crisco). It's light creamy and taste marvelous. I did not taste the Crisco as had been mentioned in another post. I will use as my go to for Red Velvet Cake from now on. Thank you for sharing.
