This is SERIOUSLY delicious. It’s not the kind of combination you expect to work well, but it comes out amazing. I didn’t have scallions so I subbed onions, and it turned out great.

Devoured by whole family, including the pickiest eater!  Served with tomato soup.  Unusually delicious, and so healthy.  What more could we ask for?  Thanks, Chef John!

I definitely will be making it again. This sandwich is delicious I did however, change the bread I used sour dough, and and at first I couldn’t find the lacinato kale so I settled for regular kale and I was just going to mix that with the mustard greens and then I found lacinato or Dino kale at Whole Food Market so I just mixed all the greens together I also added shallots and bacon and I used Muenster cheese. Now that I have something to compare it with I will make the original but nonetheless mine was delicious  even my 10 year old granddaughter loved it.

This is an amazing recipe!!!! Literally turned out just like the video, so few things do that in this day and age. We are vegetarians who don’t love kale etc but this hit the spot. The seasoned greens pair amazing with Kerry cheddar.

Loved this grilled sandwich. It was so delicious and fulfilling and was definitely worth the extra time that it took to make.  I used my homemade Sour Dough bread.  I will make this sandwich over and over!

This was really yummy. Used rye bread and only made two sandwiches. Had the remainder of the greens scrambled with eggs and topped with white cheddar for breakfast. Unsure which I liked better.

We used Standard Kale and Swiss Chard for the greens.  Used Wexford Irish Cheddar.  Had it with some Fresh Tomato Cream soup.   Holy cow it was good.

Loved this recipe! The cayenne, rice vinegar, and sourdough all meshed extremely well. Will be one of my go to sandwiches.

I did end up using the green parts of the onions though since 3/4 cup is a lot. It could have been the product that I got from my store, but a small bundle (7-8 onions) only yielded about 1/4 cup of whites/light greens. Some of the green parts of the onions got overcooked, but it still came out great!
