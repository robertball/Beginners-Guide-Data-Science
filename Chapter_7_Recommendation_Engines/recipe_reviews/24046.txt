I make this dessert frequently, and everyone loves it.  Make sure you drain the pineapple very well and go ahead and use the whole packet of pudding mix.  It sets up better and besides, what are you going to do with the 1/2 packet you have left over?  I also often use banana cream flavored pudding for a whole tropical flavor.  Never lasts long at our house!!

Not bad...I was a little confused about the pudding part (do you make the pudding as directed on the box...or just add the dry pudding to the pineapple?)  My pretzels didn't stick together either....maybe I didn't break them into small enough pieces?

AWESOME!!!
I made this salad with 10 of the pickiest eaters in mind, (my grandchildren) and it was a huge hit!
The flavors blend so well together (sweet/salty).
I made this recipe (changed for 27 people) with 1 entire box of pudding and drained the pineapple juice into a measuring cup so as to have the right amount of liquid for what the instant pudding needed.  I then made the pudding with the pineapple juice as per the box directions, then folded in the pineapple into the pudding.  It was PERFECT!
I will be making this wonderful recipe forever!

This recipe is perfect for summer get-togethers!  I altered it just a tad, used "Free" whipped topping and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I also couldn't bear to put two sticks of melted butter onto the pretzels, I only used one (1/2 cup).  But the recipe was a hit!  It was a nice, light and refreshing summer dessert.  The combination of the sweet and salty was yummy!  I will definetely be making this again.  And I told my girlfriends to find it here on Allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing it.

A must have dessert!  Tried it today for the first time and it really is a keeper.  Although I do like pineapple, it is not my favorite.  The pineapple in this recipe compliments really well with the other ingredients and it does not have a really strong pineapple flavor, it really is a nice blend of ingredients.  The other thing I wanted to mention about the recipe was the fact that I was confused about the vanilla pudding mix.  You DO NOT make the pudding, you just mix in the dry mix with the pineapple.  I love the consistency!

i've been baking a lot and this is definately one of our favorites.  My husband is an honest critic and he loves this-every time i open the fridge i grab a little piece!! I cut back on the butter 1T and i added toasted coconut and slivered almonds on the top- It really dressed it up!!!! thanx so much, now a family favorite.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  It's always a big hit when I make it.  The combination of the salty pretzel crust and the sweet topping is perfect, and it is a tasty variation of the more traditional strawberry pretzel dessert.  The only thing that I did differently was to mix the melted butter and pretzels together before putting them in the pan!

This is such a light and refreshing salad/dessert! Made it to go with our Ham Easter Dinner-old and young alike loved it. I measured out 2 cups of pineapple juice to mix with the pudding and then added the drained pineapple to the mix. If I take this out to a potluck or something, I would cut the pineapple juice back to 1 cup to make it more firm for traveling!

This dessert is so excellent! Rich and refreshing! The first time I made it the pudding mix did not firm up the pineapple very well, so I added extra pudding (which made it quite sweet). The second time I drained a portion of the juice from the can and it worked perfectly. Thanks for the variation Erin.

This recipe was delicious. It is a light pineapple taste with some creaminess & a touch of saltiness. Its not overly sweet, but still suitable to be called dessert. I made it as the recipe stated, but as others was a touch confused about directions. I drained well & reserved juices from pineapple. Then I added the dry pudding mix into the well drained pineapple stirring well then adding a touch of juice back in to get a consistency that would spread but hold steady when scooping out. I will have to say, I only made this one time and took it to a gathering that I used to get raves on others dishes but got none on this. I liked it & will make it again for my family.

A friend brought this recipe to a party and my husband just RAVED about it! My friend mixed it all together though, not in layers like this recipe calls for. Also, she said she drained the pineapples because it is quite runny without doing so. Great recipe!!!

Very, very good.  I took this to the office potluck and it was a hit.  I used lowfat cream cheese and whipped topping, used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and used the Splenda/Sugar for Baking.  I drained one of the cans of pineapple and used the entire box of pudding.  Delicious!

I made this recipe for a graduation party and it was a HUGE hit!  I did use all the pudding mix instead of half and by the way you don't actually make the pudding, just use the mix.  That was a little confusing.  Everyone said how delicious it was and wanted the recipe - I will definitely make it again!  Wonderful!!!

Just made this for a gathering we are having this afternoon.  Of course, the cook has to taste test.  It was excellent.  I used a full package of sugar free pudding and substituted splenda.  Turned out great.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was well received.  I liked the combination of sweet and salty.  I mixed the pudding part and baked the pretzel mix the night before.  Broke the pretzel crust into pieces and put in a ziplock bag.  Then when we were ready to serve I mixed it all together rather than serving it in bars.

Such a great summer dessert! I was trying to be healthy and didn’t use quite a cup of butter and the crust turned out fine. Definitely cool your crust before adding cream cheese mixture! I used a little less sugar in my cream cheese and it was certainly sweet enough. Wasn’t sure what to use half a pudding box for so I used the whole thing- it held the pineapple mixture together better also. I only drained a little liquid, which worked well. Thanks for a refreshing summer treat!

This is such a unique dessert! My sister-in-law requested a pineapple dessert for her birthday & my mother-in-law couldn't find her "usual" recipe so I stepped up & offered to make something. I came directly to Allrecipes.com & found this recipe. Such great reviews, how could I go wrong?? It was FANTASTIC & everyone loved!! Thank you!

This is wonderful.  My husband likes it better than the pretzel salad with strawberries and jello on top.  I must say I do too! I accidently used 2 blocks of cream cheese, the recipe only calls for one.  But we really liked it and I will continue to make it that way.

Super Easy dessert & my crowd LOVED this!! Doubled the recipe & came home with empty bowl for a small crowd.  I ran across this recipe looking for a last minute option. I didn't want to heat kitchen due to it being so hot outside so instead of baking the pretzel crust, I ultimately mixed all ingredients together, but did so in order directions stated.  I chose to sprinkle crushed pretzels over top of dessert just before serving to keep the crunch.  Because I was not making a pretzel crust for pie/bar type dessert, I  omitted butter from recipe.  Great decision as bowl was empty and everyone expressed their love for this dessert, many requesting recipe.  Thanks for sharing recipe!  Don't be afraid to make any recipe your own!  I receive many of my recipes from this site.  My friends & family always tell me I'm such a good cook/baker.  I really owe it to this website as this is where I get all the great recipes from!  I even want to say that a few initially turned their noses up at this dessert because of it having pineapple in it, but after hearing people rave about it they gave it a try & expressed their love for it as well.

Wow, so good, everyone loved it! I have made this as written and we loved it that way too but usually I break up the pretzel crust (as another reviewer suggested) and mix everything together.  Also, I use the whole packet of pudding mix.

This was too sweet for my liking, and I followed the recipe exactly.  The sugar and whip cream and vanilla pudding mix are just sugar overload.  I'd suggest adding some lemon juice to the pineapple to make it a little more tart and prevent it from browning.  I won't be trying this again.

I made this for a potluck with some alterations that were advised and it went better than anything else I've made, It was almost completely gone before it was over, and lots of other people had to take alot of food home. It was great!

I made this last night and actually having another piece right now. It is fantastic! I misread the directions and only added one can of pineapple but it turned out fine. I did do as some of the others suggested and added the butter and less to the pretzels instead of pouring over and I am sorry I did because the pretzels did not stick together very well. Next time...I will do just as suggested but regardless....it was incredible!

I love this recipe!  I think it is soooo much better than the strawberry jello kind.  I do think that you should drain a little juice out of the pineapple before spreading though.

pretty good...I liked the salty/sweet combo. My family enjoyed it too. My uncle who did not think it sounded good went back for seconds. I think we will make the strawberry one next time.

I made this for a Church lunch that I forgot about until the last min! I didn't have pineapple on hand so I used cherry pie filling. Got a lot of requests for the recipe. I mixed it all up too instead of layering. I think its a good summer dish!

I did use the pineapple juice to make the pudding, but otherwise I did not change the recipe at all. It was very good...even my boyfriend who was very skeptical to begin with, really liked it! The best part of it all is the smell of the pretzel/butter combination when it come out of the oven. Fantastically wonderful!!!

Always a hit.  Holds up well, even on a warm day.  Does not "melt" like strawberry version.  Cool, refreshing and have always come home with an empty pan.

This was delicious! I like it better than the strawberry version. I did have to add 1/2 cup more pretzels, since the crust was saturated in butter. I would probably add a little more dry vanilla pudding to the pineapple next time, because I would have like a stronger vanilla taste. As other have said, DRAIN THE PINEAPPLE extremely well. (I will use a colander next time). Overall, though, this recipe is worth making again.

This is a good recipe. When I was supposed to bring a salad to a family gathering, I chose this one.  Hey, it says salad in the title...but it tastes more like dessert.  If all salad tasted like this, I'd eat a lot more salad!!  It all went fast and several requests for the recipe. I would make this again

Made this for a co- workers B-day luncheon. I was late getting to the room-but My dessert was already gone.Did not get to taste it-so I was told it was great!!! I used Splenda in place of the sugar & fat free Cream cheese for the calorie watchers.

Very good. I read the previous reviews and made sure the pretzels were chopped fairly small and partly powdery.  I about 2/3 cup butter instead of a whole cup, cup down on the sugar in the cream cheese and added more pudding to the pineapple.  If you get sick of the same old desserts, it's nice.  Everyone said, "It's different, it's really good." and went back for seconds!

Yum...perfect for a hot summer day.  I did use low fat cream cheese and splenda instead of sugar and it still tasted great.  I also added some sliced banana to the pudding because I only had one can of pineapple.  Oh - and I also only used about two T. of butter plus a squirt of Pam for the crust, it didn't stick together real well, but it didn't matter.  In fact, you could even try just sprinkling the crushed toasted pretzel bits on TOP of the pudding, then you wouldn't need any butter.  Great recipe!

This dish was a big hit on Thanksgiving even though I thought I had ruined it. I crushed the pretzels and poured the butter in to bake. After baking I let it cool for awhile. I whipped the sugar and cream cheese together. Here's where the issue starts. As I put on the whipped cream cheese sugar mix my pretzels are sticking to it and lifting up. I'm just about to throw in the towel. I decide to just go with it and mixed the pretzels with the cream cheese and flatten down on the bottom of the baking dish. I then proceed to apply the pineapple/vanilla pudding. I look over and see the cool whip unopened. I can't believe I forgot to put it on. So I put it on top of the pineapple instead. Set it in fridge to cool. Like I said earlier it went from a flop to the hit of the party, I think I actually like it better made this way.

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner this year.  It was delicious, everyone loved it, but it's too sweet for me.  (same with the Strawberry/Pretzel salad). That is why I didn't give it the whole 5 stars.

I always follow the directions of a recipe the first time I make it, then if I think I neeed to make changes I do that the next time.

I followed the other reviewers suggestion to "drain very well".  I think I over did it, it was so dry it was kind of flat on the top, tasted ok but I would have rather it be more loose/fluffy.

Royal pudding is in 1.85 oz box so I used that and just mixed it in dry with that oh so dry pineapple.
Next time I will not use 2 sticks of butter.  It was hard for me to do that this time with such a small amount of pretzels, of course it tasted delicious!  ;) I usually double or almost double the amount of pretzels when I make the Strawberry one, and I might do that next time too.  

I will also cut the sugar at least in half, if not more.  There is no way that needs a whole cup of sugar.
I wondered how it might be to fold the drained pineapple in with the cream cheese/sugar/cool whip mixture?  Or make up the pudding, maybe as one reviewer did with the pineapple juice, and mix the pineapple in with the pudding?  
Maybe I'll have to make it a couple more times and do the different ways.

This is soooo good.. I used lemon instant pudding, and I did use a whole package.Very quick and easy. I took this to a birthday celebration and everyone who ate it loved it. I had to send the little bit that was left home with someone or I would have eaten it all. Definitely will make this again.

I made this for a family get together. You definitely have to drain the pineapple, which should be noted in recipe. so glad I listened to other reviewers. I used some of the juice for the whole packet of pudding and also added 1/4 cup of milk. I did everything else the same as recipe. The crust was a little to salty for my taste, but maybe it was the pretzels I used.Some of my family said they would really like it with my homemade graham cracker crust. So I think I would make it that way next time.

I used a stick-and-a-half of butter; and followed the rest of the instructions carefully; the pretzles were still really googey/rubbery and didn't stick together; I then put the middle layer on; perfect taste, and then put on the pudding/pineapple mixture; this combination was not very good. We threw most of this out. Even my daughter who'll eat any dessert thought it was "okay". I wouldn't make this version again. Next time, I'll use a pre-baked sugar cookie dough and then mix strawberry jam and coolwhip combined with red food coloring for the top layer.

Easy and delicious!  My family loved it.  I mixed a little banana in with the cream cheese/whipped topping to give it even more of a tropical taste, but other than that I left it alone and it was excellent.

Delicious! My mother has been making a strawberry pretzel salad for years, but i am allergic to strawberries, so i would always just eat the pretzel crust. I was so excited to find this recipe! I made it for a cookout and everyone loved it just as much as the strawberry one. I also used the whole packet of pudding. I will definitely be making this again!

This was awesome, especially if you like pineapple.  Low and behold I was one can shy of the crushed pineapple, but I had rings that I cut up while in the can.  Still turned out great and I got great compliments at the neighbor's cookout and even a few requests for the recipe.  Super simple to make!  Definately will be made again!

Way too sweet.  I would not use as much sugar as recommended next time.  I also drained the pineapples.  Next time I will drain them completely.  I have made this with strawberries before and preferred that version.

This salad is more like a dessert - it's wonderful and very refreshing!!  My almost 2 year old liked it as well.  I've had many requests for the recipe already.  This is a recipe I will use again and again.  One simple note - I drained my cans of pineapple just slightly because I was worried about making the crust soggy.

Made it for book club group of over 20 people and they ALL loved it!  So easy to make.  You can change the type of fruit if you don't care for pineapple.  Enjoy!

I didn’t make any changes, I think next time I will mix the butter and pretzels together and then pat them in the dish.  I loved it, I used it for a pot luck.  It went over well.

Delicious flavor combinations.  I only used one can of pineapple and as another reviewer suggested, I made the pudding, full pk., with the juice, and then added the pineapple.  I really liked this consistency.  Of course, I had to add maraschino cherries on top for color  as well as for taste.   Then I added crushed walnuts.  Probably overkill, but I do like walnuts.

This was disappointing. I tried this because I like strawberry pretzel salad, but this was just... no. Mixing pineapple with pudding mix is not analogous to the strawberry / jello layer that offered some tartness and variety of texture. Canned pineapple just isn't that tart. It tastes ok because it's all tasty stuff in there, but this is not something I'll take to a barbecue to share.

This got rave reviews at our family dinner.  I made the pudding with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and then stirred in the drained pineapple which seemed to be a little juicy.  Worked perfectly.

This is good, but the recipe with strawberries is classic and it can't be beat.  I did change it a bit.  First, I always use heavy cream and whip it up myself with an egg beater.  Cool Whip is fine if you like that.  Second, I thought that was too much butter for the amount of pretzels.  My strawberry pretzel recipe uses less and I followed that recipe for the crust.  Third, I used fresh pineapple.  I chopped it up and I did not drain it.  I used the entire amount of vanilla pudding and even with undrained pineapple it was too thick to spread.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a bust.  It had very little flavor and the pretzel crust was too soggy by the time dessert time rolled around.

Made this to take to my MIL's for a cookout. Everyone liked it, but there were no 'I gotta have that recipe's. I will probably make it again because it's realitvely low fat (low fat cream cheese and cool whip), but still refreshing and tasty.

My family requests that I make this dessert at least every Thanksgiving & Christmas, it's always a huge hit! A few helpful notes: make sure to crush up the pretzels really well so you have plenty of "pretzel powder"...helps hold the crust together (but don't pulverize it, the chunkier texture is awesome!). And instead of putting the pretzels in the bottom of the dish & pouring the butter over it, I mix it all together in a bowl first & then spread it out/press it into the dish to help it stick together a little better. Definitely drain your pineapple & go ahead & use the whole box of the DRY pudding mix (don't make up the pudding first)!

It was good but I did lighten the calorie count.  I used a 9 x 9 pan and added one melted stick of butter instead of the two.  I also used fat free cream cheese and fat free whipped topping.  I omitted the sugar completely. I did use a whole box of the vanilla pudding which I added to the drained pineapple. I served it to non calorie conscious family members and they took most of the leftovers home with them. I did not tell them I shaved some fat. I will make it again.

Instructions were a little ambiguous and didn't come out as well as I hoped. I plan to play with it and possibly next time use a flavored jello instead.

I would abstain from stars if I could, only because I "tweaked" the recipe and therefore am not truly rating the recipe as presented.  My alterations: I only used a little more than 1/2 cup of butter for the crust.  Also, 1/2 cup of sugar (or in this case, Splenda) was more than enough to sweeten the cream cheese filling.  The pineapple layer was where I really was unsure of the outcome.  I used 2 cans of well drained pineapple to which I added an entire packet (six serving size) of sugar free vanilla pudding.  I actually thought it a little dry and bitter tasting.  I added a little pineapple juice which didn't help much.  I then added about 1/2 cup of milk, which seemed to improve both taste and consistency.  That became the final layer.  My guests all thought it was delicious.  I thought it was good, but not great.  About half of the pan got eaten and frankly I don't think I'll be saving the rest.

I really like the pretzel, cream cheese, fruit topping thing going here. I like the strawberry version of this recipe and was surprized I liked the pineapple version too. This could be served as a desert.

I didn't care for this. I drained the pineapple but found it was still very runny. I took it to a party but it was hardly touched.

I made this for a family get-together and everyone loved it. I like it made with pineapple much better than strawberries.
