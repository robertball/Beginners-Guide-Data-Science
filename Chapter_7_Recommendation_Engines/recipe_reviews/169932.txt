Oh bliss! I'm a definite pecan-lover so this soup sounded like something I would like. Took the advice of KymInNM and left out tomato paste and that of Nuttycat22 and roasted the pecans first and it is divine! I used sea salt on the pecans as they roasted and then used the sea salt from the pan to season the soup when it was done. Thank you for the recipe I will certainly make this again and again!!

This was very good and easy to make but it wasn't quite as interesting as I thought it would be. It tasted like tomato-chipotle soup; the pecans added more texture than flavor. I used veg broth and coconut milk (my standard sub for cream); otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I'd probably try this again and use a tomato rather than paste--or omit it altogether. A dried chipotle would add an interesting smokiness.

I haven't made it yet but am anxious too! After reading the recipe and the reviews it seemed to me that if you toast the Pecans it might add a depth of flavor that you are missing. I am going to try toasting them and see if that helps.

This was okay but it lacked something I thought. The blended pecans resembled ground beef which was deceiving. Maybe I would have liked it better with meat? I'm not sure? It wasn't bad and it was a nice change but it cost a lot to make it for not a lot of WOW factor. If you love pecans give it a try!

I got a little heavy handed on the chipotle's so I put some sour cream on the table but being from New Mexico none of my guests thought it was too hot. Tasty and different. A nice company soup.

I made this as is with about two cups of pecans instead of three when it was completed I didn't care for the taste. However later I added chicken and it tasted wonderful. I ate it as a soup however I think it would also be good served over white rice

I was quite disappointed by the lack of wow factor with this soup. I roasted the pecans and I think that did help with the flavor a little bit. I added 2 whole chipotles but I think this was too much - one would have been sufficient and we love spicy food. Overall a decent starter course but definitely not for dinner and not one I'll make the effort to make too often.

The taste was excellent but it was watery and the peacons were an odd texture with this. I am going to strain the liquid discard the pecans and add cooked chicken then reheat and serve. I only added about a cup of pecans originally and am glad as that was even too much. I think this soup has hope but in a different format.
