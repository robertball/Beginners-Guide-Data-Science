My husband liked this more than I did, but I think with a few changes it would appeal to me more.  I'm thinking that chicken thighs might be better suited to this red wine sauce for one thing.  I also would rather use a skillet on stovetop to make this instead of the oven because I have a better handle on getting it done to perfection.  There was a lot of sauce for this, and because it is quite liquid, I will thicken the leftover sauce when I serve it again.  I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Ready Rice to go with this.  Mushrooms would be a good addition, too, in my opinion.  The flavor of this sauce is really good, and I must admit to having used grated fresh ginger.  Dinner was successful, and when Hubby likes something, I feel grateful!  Thanks for the recipe!

I would use thighs with skin, because it holds more flavor, and also use white wine as the red gives chicken that odd pink tinge.  Good recipe.

Swapped pork for chicken and made it in the crock pot instead. Thickened up the sauce after with cornstarch. Would definitely make this again!
