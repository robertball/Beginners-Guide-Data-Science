I cooked the filling to avoid problems with the eggs and it worked just fine. Reminds us of a key lime pie without using key limes. Very smooth and great taste. Everyone who tasted it really enjoyed the flavor.

This is fantastic! I didn't sieve the avocado just mashed it with a fork and then blended with the other ingredients. The flavour and the colour are very nice. Do not use a metal sieve or the avocado will go dark and have an odd taste.

I used key lime juice and rolled out a crust so I could bake the pie. It tasted very much like a regular key lime pie but with a bit creamier texture. Nobody would ever guess there was avocado in it!

Fantastic! I had to use bottled key lemon juice because it was all I had on hand. Like another reviewer mentioned it's like key lime/lemon pie but even creamier. My avocados were so ripe it was easy to mash them with a spoon. I blended the first mixture before adding the avocado for awhile 5 minutes or more because I didn't know how thickened it should be and it set up beautifully overnight nice and high but dense. This was an experiment that instantly became a favorite!

The taste was quite good sweet and limey. The only problem was the filling was pretty runny (like pudding).
