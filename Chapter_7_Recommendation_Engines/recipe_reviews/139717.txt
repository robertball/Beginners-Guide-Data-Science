I used equal amounts Truvia in place of the Splenda. I think the potential for this recipe is good but as is, it's just way too sweet (even when using club soda) and the extreme honey flavor is a bit off-putting. I would like to try this again but I would cut the Truvia and the honey at least in half.

I didn't care for this at all.  TOO much honey in it, it made me think I was drinking a liquid honey cough drop.  I think it could be good but the honey needs to be reduced
