I make a variety of no-bake cheesecakes, this was a huge hit. One girl confessed to having 5 pieces. I doubled the recipe except for the cool whip, left that at 8oz. and made it in a 9x12. I offered strawberry pie filling on the side. It was devoured! Making it again this weekend.

Being an Italian purist, I have never made a no-bake cheese cake before.  That being said, I LOVE cream cheese so I decided to give it a shot.  This was such a simple recipe--I mean it's not much more complicated than peanut butter and jelly.  So of course I had to complicate it a bit.  I made my own crust and couldn't resist throwing a can of cherries on top--still a really simple recipe.  Honestly, I could have eaten the whole thing.  It was dangerously yummy.  I have read a few recipes on this site that have a similar ingredient profile, one that would call the inside of this cheese cake--"dip" and I can see why.  It's very light and fluffy--and a bit messy to cut through and serve on a plate.  I think that this is a great base recipe that you could tweak to your liking and turn into a 5.  It would be great to keep these ingredients on hand for company--it really is so simple and yummy.

Super easy to make and results in a simple, delicious pie. I used three cups freshly whipped cream instead of Cool Whip, and it turned out perfect.

I was pretty excited to try this recipe but I thought it needed a little something extra! So I added raspberry pie filling on top with a pinch fork pattern. Next I added fresh raspberries, to finish I lightly garnished the top with white chocolate chips. Everyone loved it and I was told it was better than a local cheesecake restaurant we have here in town!

as recipe is stated,  i couldn't pick up on the white chocolate as much as i would have liked.  i loved how simple it was to make and might consider making it again with a few adjustments such as adding more white chocolate chips for flavor and increasing the amount of other ingredients.  i love my pies mounding.

It's so easy to do & so many different ways you make it. Rather then go with the traditional graham cracker crust I used an Oreo cookie crust (ready made) then crushed some Oreos on top with both bigger chunks & crumbs. It turned out fantastic, at first you taste the Oreos then as you're chewing the white chocolate flavor comes in and it's a party in you're mouth. Everyone in my house loved it, but to be fair they're all big fans of the seasonal white chocolate covered Oreos that come out at Christmas.

So easy to make. Maybe added a little extra chocolate chips..& I added strawberry filling on top and some of the left over white chocolate chips. (also have tried  raspberry, blueberries too before on top and just as good)  I’ve made this a few times before and I will continue too. And since it’s so easy it’s great for those last minute parties you forgot about or potlucks. And everyone always loves it.
