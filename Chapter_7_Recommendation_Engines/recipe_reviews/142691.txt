This was a great recipe for lamp chops! I had read another review that used half soy sauce and half worchestershire sauce so I did that. We like our lamb medium rare so I cooked it 15 minutes on one side and then inserted a meat thermometer and cooked to 160 degrees. Next time I will cook it to 155 as I like it a little rarer.The flavors were great regardless.

I thought this recipe was great.  I used half soya sauce and half Worchestershire.  I also used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs.
The lamb was very tender!

I really didn't like this recipe. There was too much Worcestershire sauce taste and it took away from the dish. The cooking time also dried out the lamb...hmm. Did like the idea of using the remaining marinade & adding an egg before breading...but won't try this one again.

Excellent!!! Did it twice, and will do again. My husband love it as well. More the meat stays in marinade more tender it is. Followed exactly as written. Whoever loves lamb should try it.

I was looking for something quick and easy with ingredients I actually had home already.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and only marinated for 30-40 minutes in a ziploc bag.  It still came out tasting heavenly.  I think this is my new favorite lamb recipe.

Great recipe!  My first time making lamb, and definitely a great recipe to start with!  I didn't bread the chops as the recipe calls for, and instead used the marinade and then grilled them.  Next time I'll be more brave and try the exact recipe!

I made it exactly as it said, except I cooked it for 15 min per side and it was well done but tender. I only marinated it for 1 1/2 hr, next time I would marinate it longer so that the flavours have more time blend.

Made these tonight and they were ok.  I think the problem was the chops we had (gamey), not the recipe. Had no problem with them getting crisp, but I put the pan in the oven as it preheated, then added the chops once the oven was ready. I used half the Worcestershire as several other people suggested.

this was good but a little too strong tasting of worchestire...I guess I would try putting 1/2 and 1/2 liquid. Otherwise it came put crispy and tender.

By far the best recipe I've ever tried from this website! I'm not much of a cook yet but I try lot. When I made this my boyfriend of 7 years told me this was the best meal I've ever cooked. I agree. I tried it as is and it is good. Then I tried exchanging the soy sauce for balsamic vinegar and it made it even better.

This was quite a tasty dish but I think it would have been better fried or grilled as the breadcrumbs did not crisp up in the oven.  The flavours were great though.

This recipe was flavorful however it over powered the taste of the lamb. Our family felt that the flavor didn’t “match” with lamb. The bread crumbs didn’t crisp up and were soggy. I might use this marinade on a different kind of meat, like chicken.

Very tasty!  The breading ended up  a bit soggy though. Will probably make his again.

Interesting recipe - like the marinate, did as many other recommenders suggested and cut the Worcestershire and soy sauce in half.  Bread crumbs were fairly soggy after baking as some others had mentioned.  I will try cooking it at 400 or 425 for 10 min a side next time to see if that helps crisp the outside.  All in all, a good dinner experience.

i reduced Worcestershire sauce to 1/2 a cup and add 1/2 cup of red wine. I marinated for 8hrs in a zip lock bag turning twice. I liked using the marinade in the breading process. I cooked placed directly on oven rack with a tray on the rack underneath (to save turning) and backed for 30 minutes. They were tender and flavorful. A little over cooked (we like as medium rare). The bread crumb did crisp, but did not brown. My only criticism is not with the recipe per say, mainly that all the flavoring really overpowered the lamb. We like lamb for the lamb. I'll definitely try this marinade on some beef though.

This was my first time making anything with lamb. I liked it, but thought the Worcestershire sauce was too overpowering. I should have read the other reviews beforehand and diluted it with something else... I marinated the meat for about 2.5 hours and it turned out very tender. The crust was somewhat soggy, especially on the bottom half, but had a good flavor. I would definitely make this again!

I made this following the recipe (but I always up the garlic) and my wife who is not a lamb fan loved it!
