I followed the recipe and got 9 muffins, baking them for 22 minutes. I found the Tofutti flavor (dairy-free cream cheese) was lost among the blueberry-lemon flavors, but they were still tasty. Against my better judgement I went ahead and used white sugar in the glaze. And just as i thought, the glaze was grainy. Next time I will use powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
